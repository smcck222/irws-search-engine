LA JOLLA ACTION QUESTIONED; 
</P>
<P>
OTHER SCHOOLS SAY THEY WOULD HAVE KEPT ROGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Without evidence of an imminent safety risk to students, San Diego area 
educators say, they would not have asked the wife of Vincennes skipper Will 
Rogers III to resign her fourth-grade classroom duties simply because she was 
the target of a possible terrorist attack last week. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, educators interviewed by The Times said they would have made sure that 
the government provide extra security for Sharon Rogers' class or would have 
transferred the teacher to another assignment, where she could keep working but 
have minimal contact with students until the threat of terrorist action had 
subsided. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers resigned Thursday as a teacher at the exclusive La Jolla Country Day 
School, where she had been employed 12 years and had earned a reputation as an 
excellent teacher. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Days After Phone Threat 
</P>
<P>
The move came six days after Rogers escaped injury when a crude pipe bomb 
exploded under the van she was driving to the school -- an incident experts 
believe could have been a terrorist retaliation for the accidental downing of 
an Iranian air bus by the guided missile cruiser Vincennes last summer. It 
followed by two days a bomb threat phoned to the campus, which this week posted 
security guards to turn away strangers and search classrooms before school 
began. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the "mutual decision" for Rogers to step down, officials at the 
private school said they were concerned about the "safety of the children, the 
confidence of the parents and the integrity of the educational environment . . 
. " 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Bill Lowery (R-San Diego), a friend of the Rogerses, said Friday that he 
was deeply disappointed in the school's decision to drop Rogers from the 
faculty. He said he believes that Rogers, already victimized by the van 
explosion, was made a victim a second time by losing her job. 
</P>
<P>
"As the father of three kids, I can certainly identify with the concerns of the 
parents," he said. "But this is a case where the victim is a victim again. 
</P>
<P>
"And this is what international terrorism is all about, to put such fears into 
how we go about our daily business that we capitulate." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Uncertainty and Pressure 
</P>
<P>
An aide to Lowery has said that La Jolla Country Day administrators told him 
that, although they had no "direct information" that the school was being 
targeted for terrorism, Rogers' presence on the campus created "uncertainty" 
and "pressure" on the academic environment. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the San Diego Police Department and the Naval Investigative 
Service, which is providing security for the Rogers family in the wake of the 
bombing, said they were not involved with the decision and did not advise 
school officials about what, if any, safety risk was posed by Rogers returning 
to the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
A number of San Diego-area educators said Friday that their guidelines and 
"moral" feelings were such that unsubstantiated fears about a terrorist attack 
on campus would not be strong enough to keep Rogers out of their classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"In this day and age, we have to deal with a lot of uncertainty and ambiguity, 
and one of the things we have to do is provide some sense of direction for our 
young people on how to deal with that," said Tom Payzant, superintendent for 
117,000 students in the San Diego Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure we should give in to the ambiguity and uncertainty by running 
scared," Payzant said. "I would have thought long and hard about putting 
pressure on somebody to leave, if that in fact happened." 
</P>
<P>
Payzant said that, before taking any action in Rogers' case, he would have 
consulted with police agencies to determine the safety risks to her classroom 
and explored whether the government would be willing to provide added 
protection for the teacher and her students. 
</P>
<P>
"Most likely, we would take it head-on and deal with the security issues and 
say that things have got to get back to normal as quickly as possible," Payzant 
said. "That's the best message to send to everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Relieving Rogers of her duties, he said, could be interpreted as a victory for 
the terrorists, if indeed they were responsible for the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is something to that argument that you can't run scared," 
Payzant said. "You've got to take the necessary precautions, but we still have 
to remain in control and put forth a positive image. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't develop the kind of atmosphere where everybody feels victimized and 
is fearful," he said. "Once people adopt that attitude, it really makes it very 
difficult for a school to be a place where creativity and learning can occur." 
</P>
<P>
Lowery said he had met with the secretary of the Navy in Washington this week 
and had been assured that the Navy and San Diego police were willing to provide 
adequate security for Rogers should she be allowed to continue her fourth-grade 
teaching assignment. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, rather than firing Sharon Rogers, that strikes me as a better 
approach," Lowery said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mixed Feelings 
</P>
<P>
Rene Townsend, superintendent of the 16,000-student Vista Unified School 
District, said she had "mixed feelings" about what happened to Rogers, but 
would have tried to transfer the teacher to a different job in the district 
while the investigation of the bombing ran its course. 
</P>
<P>
"The way we operate in our district is to rally around somebody who is having a 
difficult time and help them through that," Townsend said. "Obviously, this is 
a difficult time for the Capt. and Mrs. Rogers." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if she would consider hiring Rogers for an elementary-school position in 
the wake of the bombing, Townsend said, "We would consider her application like 
everybody else's." 
</P>
<P>
Several superintendents pointed out Friday that, unlike with private school 
administrators, state law forbids them to remove a teacher from the classroom 
for reasons other than insubordination or incompetence. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the law, however, some superintendents said they would have moral 
qualms about letting Rogers go. 
</P>
<P>
"Morally, I don't think I could dismiss a teacher because something occurred 
due to her family situation," said Steven F. Speach, superintendent for the 
15,000-student Oceanside Unified School District. "Basically, we have to base 
our judgment on her performance as a teacher. As long as her performance were 
adequate, she would continue to be employed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Some Moral Problems' 
</P>
<P>
Added Terry Ryan, superintendent of the 1,011-student Bonsall Union Elementary 
School District: "I would have had some moral problems with that, dismissing a 
teacher just for the incident in which she was involved. Morally, you don't 
dismiss a teacher who is a quality teacher without just cause. 
</P>
<P>
"But, if there is an imminent danger to children, that has to come first, even 
in that situation," Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Robinson, assistant superintendent for the Poway Unified School District, 
also said he would not let Rogers go if he were headmaster of a private school. 
</P>
<P>
"My answer would be no," he said. "If that were to happen, and I were a 
headmaster for a small, private school, I would be sitting down with her and 
trying to find some remedy that would be acceptable to both parties." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for The Bishop's School, another exclusive private school in La 
Jolla, declined comment on what its administration would do if faced with 
Rogers' case. The headmaster for the private Francis W. Parker School did not 
return phone calls Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Stewart, La Jolla Country Day School development director, declined comment 
on the school's handling of the case except to refer to a statement released 
Thursday that said Rogers would not be returning to campus.

APPLES WILL REAPPEAR IN SCHOOL CAFETERIAS; STATE CALLS FRUIT SAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
School districts began taking steps Friday to restore apples and related 
products to cafeteria menus, as the state's top health and education officials 
added their voices to the chorus of government agencies declaring the fruit 
safe to eat. 
</P>
<P>
Scores of districts in California and throughout the nation hastily banned the 
fruit this week, following the lead of the nation's two largest school systems, 
Los Angeles Unified and New York City schools, which had stopped serving apples 
in any form because of fears about Alar, a growth-regulating chemical used on 
some apple crops. 
</P>
<P>
Most districts contacted Friday said they expect to begin offering the fruit 
again after students return from next week's spring break. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a relief it's over," said Joyce Pinto, supervisor of food services for 
the ABC Unified School District, which includes Cerritos, Artesia and Lakewood. 
"I think (the danger) was a bit exaggerated." 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego County, some school districts were still refusing to serve apples 
to students Friday until they received written assurances from the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture that the fruit was not tainted with a chemical called 
daminozide, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Although federal and state agencies officially discounted Thursday a report 
that apples treated with the chemical pose a health risk, most local school 
district officials said they were still playing it safe and waiting for letters 
from Department of Agriculture officials following further testing of apple 
products. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the South Bay Union Elementary school district, with 8,700 
students, said that, although the district had heard that the apples are safe, 
a decision had not been made about whether to serve apples to the students. 
</P>
<P>
In Alpine, apples are not considered "on hold' because they were never 
scheduled to be on this week's menu anyway. Next week is Spring Break, and the 
district expects to hear from USDA officials before classes begin again. 
</P>
<P>
Bonsall Union Elementary, Borrego Springs Unified, Encinitas Union Elementary, 
Fallbrook Union Elementary, Lemon Grove Elementary, Oceanside Unified, South 
Bay Union Elementary, Sweetwater Union High and Valley Center Union Elementary 
were not serving apples. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Unified school district, the state's second-largest, Cajon Valley 
Union Elementary school district and several other districts are serving the 
fruit after being informed by suppliers that their apples are not sprayed with 
the chemical. 
</P>
<P>
After a weeklong ban, Los Angeles school district Supt. Leonard Britton said 
Thursday that apples and some related products could again be served in school 
cafeterias, basing his decision on results of laboratory tests showing the 
items to be safe. The federal government also formally declared Thursday that 
it is safe to eat apples. 
</P>
<P>
By Friday morning some Los Angeles district schools began placing apple orders 
with the district's central food warehouse, where about 450,000 apples are in 
storage, a district official said. 
</P>
<P>
State Food and Agriculture Director Jack Parnell, Health Services Director 
Kenneth W. Kizer and Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig also announced 
Friday that Alar levels of only 1/400th to 1/1,000th the federal safety 
standard of 20 parts per million were found in samples of apples and apple 
products taken from Department of Education storehouses in Pomona and 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
None of the tested apples or apple products had levels of daminozide, the 
chemical from which Alar is made, of more than .055 parts per million. 
Daminozide has been linked to cancer in laboratory studies. 
</P>
<P>
Charges of Alar's dangers, particularly among young children, were made last 
month by a New York-based group called the Natural Resources Defense Council. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot more significant health problems" than apples with trace amounts 
of Alar, said Honig, who joined the other officials at a news conference in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Policy to Continue 
</P>
<P>
He said the state Department of Education, which supplies schools with apple 
products from U.S. Department of Agriculture surpluses, will continue to accept 
apples from crops treated with Alar. He added, however, that if the federal 
government bans the chemical, "it's not going to break our heart." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Kizer nor Honig said he is prepared to take the extreme step -- 
advocated by some environmentalists -- of requiring schools to serve only 
chemical-free fruits and vegetables to pupils. According to Kizer, there is 
insufficient scientific data to support such action. 
</P>
<P>
The New York City school system, which serves one million students, was the 
first district in the country to drop apples from the menu until federal 
authorities could verify the fruit's safety. An official there said Friday that 
administrators will meet Monday to decide when to resume serving apples and 
products made from them.

SERIAL TASK FORCE FOCUSES ON 3 ARRESTED FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three men arrested for the attempted murder of San Diego-area prostitutes are 
being investigated further by a special law enforcement task force to determine 
if they are responsible for a series of 3 dozen slayings in which street women 
have been killed and their bodies dumped in remote parts of the county. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Metropolitan Homicide Task Force, which this week announced its 
renewal after a six-month beginning, detailed its suspicions about the three 
men in a lengthy status report released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The report also outlines the group's method of investigation and says the task 
force is working in several key directions to gather evidence and locate what 
they now believe is more than one killer responsible for the slayings that 
began here in June, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The task force's primary emphasis appears to be in comparing cases in which 
women have been assaulted but not slain, and hoping that their stories will 
lead detectives to the killers of the other women. 
</P>
<P>
"Unlike some task force efforts in other parts of the country," the report 
says, "the San Diego Metropolitan Homicide Task Force has adopted an 
investigative practice that is more broad and, it is felt, more in line with 
the needs of the public." 
</P>
<P>
The task force is made up of investigators from the San Diego County Sheriff's 
Department, the San Diego Police Department and the county district attorney's 
office. They made clear in their report that they do not suspect there is a 
lone killer. 
</P>
<P>
"It is erroneous to conclude a single suspect committed all or even most of the 
killings," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
But, it adds, "It is likely one suspect did commit a substantial number of the 
homicides and suspected homicides." 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, the task force has been highly secretive about its work, 
declining even to say where its offices are. Within the past week, however, the 
task force has released two reports, perhaps reflecting a new approach to 
providing information to the public. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eye on Three Cases 
</P>
<P>
The three cases that detectives have focused on involve the arrests of Daniel 
Thomas Stafford, Blake Raymond Taylor and Ronald Porter. 
</P>
<P>
* Stafford was arrested in connection with the October, 1987, attack on a 
juvenile prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the attack occurred when the girl stepped into 
Stafford's car, "expecting to perform an act of prostitution." Instead, 
Stafford drove out Interstate 8 to the Pine Valley area, where he choked the 
girl and threatened her with a knife, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
The girl escaped and fled half-naked until she was rescued by a passing truck 
driver. Stafford pleaded guilty to kidnaping after his arrest, the report says. 
In September, he was placed on five years' probation and required to serve a 
year in custody. 
</P>
<P>
"All detectives regarded this case as a possible instance where a homicide was 
intended but was not completed," the report says. "Stafford remains under 
consideration for some of the subject homicides." 
</P>
<P>
* Taylor, of Lemon Grove, was arrested in the assault last June of Irene 
Quinland, whom the report describes as a "street prostitute." 
</P>
<P>
She told authorities she was working as a prostitute in the 4200 block of El 
Cajon Boulevard when she was picked up by the driver of a white Ford Bronco and 
driven to a secluded area near the San Diego River, beneath the Interstate 805 
overpass, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Produced a Shotgun 
</P>
<P>
The driver "produced a shotgun and stated he was going to kill her," the report 
says. "He ordered this victim to lie down in the floor area of the Bronco and 
cover herself with a quilt or moving pad. As he started the car, Quinland 
managed to escape." 
</P>
<P>
She told investigators that the assailant said "he had to kill her because she 
might lead the police to him, and they would find out about the other girls." 
She also said he "asked her if she was going to cry and beg like the Mexican 
girl." 
</P>
<P>
Task force detectives "made the investigative assumption" that he was talking 
about Melissa Sandoval, a Latina prostitute found dead near Black Mountain Road 
last May, less than two weeks before the attack on Quinland. The report also 
notes that "some evidence" showed that Sandoval was last seen getting into a 
"light-colored Bronco or Blazer automobile." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor was arrested in the attack on Quinland. He was tried and convicted of 
attempted murder. In January he was sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The report adds: "Investigation is continuing as to whether Taylor is 
responsible for the Sandoval homicide or any of the other subject homicides." 
</P>
<P>
* Porter was arrested in the attack last October on Annette Russell, described 
as "a prostitute working on El Cajon Boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
The report says she was driven to the Buckman Springs area, "where she was 
choked unconscious and left on the shoulder of the road." 
</P>
<P>
A sheriff's deputy patrolling nearby found her moments later. She survived, and 
Porter is scheduled to stand trial soon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Similar to Other Attacks 
</P>
<P>
"The attack on victim Russell is similar to three other attacks, in each of 
which the victim was a young female transient or prostitute, all of whom 
survived," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
"The case is also similar to a homicide of a young woman whose body was found 
July 22, 1988, in the same area of East County. Porter remains under 
consideration in those cases." 
</P>
<P>
In all, the task force has made six arrests, resulting so far in three 
convictions. Still unresolved, however, are 38 separate murder investigations 
in the string of cases. 
</P>
<P>
In other revelations from the report, the task force described many of its 
investigative techniques. These include using vice officers to solicit 
information from prostitutes, formulating a "more sophisticated" method for 
preserving evidence at homicide scenes and developing a computer base to 
analyze individual characteristics of each of the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the report says, the group has spent about $88,200, not including 
salaries and personnel benefits, during the first six months. 
</P>
<P>
The report also attempts to deflect public criticism of the task force's work, 
particularly as it compares to a five-year investigation by Seattle area 
detectives in a similar series of prostitute killings along the Green River 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"It is certainly regrettable that the series, or groups of series, of homicides 
have not been solved" in San Diego, the report concludes. "Nonetheless, 
substantial progress has been made, uninformed outside carping 
notwithstanding."

VIETNAMESE BILLED FOR UNNEEDED PHONE SERVICES GET HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Baffled that their telephone bills seemed astronomical in past months, many 
Vietnamese students enrolled in a job-training program for Southeast Asians in 
San Diego have been showing their bills to their English-speaking instructors 
in hopes of getting an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew they shouldn't have such huge phone bills," said Beverley Yip, 
director of the Union of Pan Asian Communities, a San Diego-based support group 
that provides job training. "The students were being billed for things like 
call waiting and call forwarding -- a whole package that they didn't need or 
want. Some had special rates for calling Imperial County, even though they 
didn't know anyone there." 
</P>
<P>
Since Feb. 14, however, eight Pacific Bell service representatives who speak 
English and Vietnamese have been helping Vietnamese customers decipher their 
phone bills and, in some cases, obtain refunds for those who paid for services 
they didn't need and didn't realize they had ordered. Pacific Bell's Vietnamese 
Service Center opened in Tustin in December and began serving San Diego County 
on Feb. 14. Officials plan to begin serving Los Angeles County later this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charged for Unneeded Services 
</P>
<P>
Many of San Diego County's 25,000 to 30,000 Vietnamese residents have been 
charged for the unnecessary services because of poor communication with 
English-speaking service representatives, said Yip, who sits on a Pacific Bell 
special advisory committee for the Asian market. Yip said about half of all 
Vietnamese in the county can speak English fluently. 
</P>
<P>
Many Vietnamese customers who speak English still prefer to speak Vietnamese 
"when it comes to ordering something as complicated and technological as 
telephone service," a Pacific Bell spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The representatives take orders for new service, add or change existing 
features, answer bill-related questions and help customers choose which phone 
package best meets their needs. Vietnamese customers' calls are transferred to 
the Vietnamese Service Center when they call Pacific Bell's general business 
number and indicate they speak Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
The weekday service, which Pacific Bell officials say might begin statewide 
later this year, is part of the Pacific Bell Asian Market Plan, which was 
adopted in 1987 after the company analyzed the demographics, language needs and 
life styles of Asians in California. The company also provides services for 
Spanish, Korean and Chinese-speaking customers. 
</P>
<P>
"This service makes good business sense to Pacific Bell," Yip said.

DONALD SMITH, RETIRED JUDGE, DIES AT AGE 65 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN FAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Donald W. Smith, a retired San Diego County Superior Court judge who helped 
bring national recognition to the El Cajon Municipal Court for its reforms, 
died Friday morning of a heart attack in El Cajon. He was 65. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who had been suffering from cancer, was remembered by friends and family 
as a tough judge with a soft heart, a hard worker with a healthy sense of humor 
and a devoted family man. He was among a handful of El Cajon judges who became 
known as "the El Cajon Mafia" for their influence and attempts to improve the 
efficiency of the court. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who was presiding judge of the Superior Court in 1985 and 1986, was 
appointed to the El Cajon Municipal Court on April 10, 1962, by then-Gov. 
Edmund G. Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Retired Superior Court Judge Alfred Lord on Friday recalled working with Smith 
when the two were El Cajon municipal judges. "We were conducting jury trials 
well into the night and hearing verdicts at midnight," Lord said. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Thomas Duffy, another municipal judge, they worked hard to 
streamline the administration and gain control over a court calendar that Lord 
described as then being "in very bad shape." 
</P>
<P>
Lord said Smith was instrumental in setting up rehabilitative programs such as 
an education program for drinking drivers and a drug-abuse treatment program. 
He also devised "trial by declaration," a traffic hearing in which witnesses 
submitted statements in writing, saving police officers the time and cost of 
going to court. 
</P>
<P>
Smith also helped push for state legislation that in 1977 made the El Cajon 
Municipal Court the first in the state allowed to hear Superior Court cases. 
Doris R. Rogers, who spent more than 10 years as Smith's courtroom clerk, said 
the move -- known as "The El Cajon Experiment" -- saved time and took pressure 
off the Superior Court in downtown San Diego. "They could hear all matters 
except those that carried the death penalties." 
</P>
<P>
Smith was appointed to the Superior Court in 1979 by then-Gov. Jerry Brown. As 
presiding Superior Court judge in 1985 and '86, he helped identify a need for 
expanding the downtown Superior Court and worked to help set up the county's 
first Family Court. 
</P>
<P>
Judith McConnell, assistant presiding judge of the Superior Court, said Smith 
was a dynamic, energetic judge who was "always on the move." 
</P>
<P>
"He had a very low tolerance for incompetence and a very incisive mind," 
McConnell said. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Adams, who worked with Smith on the Municipal Court and is now a 
Superior Court judge assigned to El Cajon, said Smith's reputation for being 
tough was balanced by a soft side. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't have a mean bone in his body. He looked like a real austere judge, 
but he was a pussycat. . . . He was like a rudder around here. I'm going to 
miss him desperately." 
</P>
<P>
Outside the court, Duffy said, Smith was a gregarious, easygoing and jovial 
man. "Even though his name was Smith, he was probably more Irish than I was. . 
. . It was appropriate that he died on St. Patrick's Day." 
</P>
<P>
Duffy and Smith had built up one of the county's best-regarded law practices in 
the 1950s and '60s, a firm that has changed names several times and over the 
years produced five judges. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, a native of San Francisco, served in the Navy as a petty officer first 
class at the Alameda Naval Air Base during World War II, graduated from the 
University of San Francisco law school in 1952 and started a private law 
practice in El Cajon in 1956. He served as assistant city attorney for the 
cities of El Cajon and La Mesa and was appointed to the Municipal Court in 
1962. 
</P>
<P>
Smith is survived by his wife, Elizabeth; two daughters, Suzanne Grami and Sara 
Ramirez; four sons, Geoffrey, Matthew, Peter and John; and eight grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
The Rosary will be recited at 7 p.m. Monday at Holy Trinity Catholic Church in 
El Cajon. Mass will be said at 11:30 a.m. Tuesday at the church. Interment, 
with military honors, will be held at Holy Cross Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
In lieu of flowers, friends who wish to may contribute to Nazareth House in San 
Diego or St. Vincent de Paul.

RITES OF PASSAGE, IOWA TO L.A.; 
</P>
<P>
WHEN DID TEEN-AGE PRANKS TURN TO KILLING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARLEN DEAN SNYDER, Arlen Dean Snyder is a television and film actor who 
lives in the Los Angeles community of Sun Valley. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bright purple, hand-painted Model A Ford was nothing but a slowly moving 
dark shadow in the full moonlight. Lights out, transmission growling and four 
cylinders laboring, it jolted the five teen-age boys unmercifully as it crept 
from one solid clay rut to another over the sun-baked dirt road. 
</P>
<P>
The four passengers giggled and cursed in whispers at the car and the driver 
until he turned into a field lane, backed up, headed the car in the other 
direction and stopped in the middle of the road. They all piled out, still 
giggling and cursing in good humor, and climbed up the embankment to the four 
strands of barbed wire that claimed the object of their quest: the property of 
a local farmer. They carefully crawled through the wire and, making certain 
they weren't trampling the vines, thumped their way toward a ripe, delicious, 
illicit feast. They heard the distinctive whine of a bullet just before it 
ricocheted off the metal windmill silhouetted in the middle of the field. Two 
more bullets pinged as the five boys sped at a dead run for the barbed barrier 
and the prayed-for safety of the road beyond. 
</P>
<P>
The engine complained to life and the transmission howled to the moonlit world 
as they departed with much less caution than they had employed on their 
arrival. In the back, the "town boys" shared handkerchiefs as they swabbed the 
blood oozing from cuts inflicted by the four strands of discouragement. The two 
"farm boys" in front needed no such nursing and soon began to giggle anew as 
the fear of a rifle-inflicted death faded in the distance behind them. Soon all 
five were laughing heartily as they headed for town where, over Cokes, they 
celebrated and embroidered the story of surviving their latest exploit. 
</P>
<P>
It was Watermelon Night. 
</P>
<P>
A test of courage. A test of skill. A rite of passage from summer and field 
work to fall and school work, and a rite of passage from boyhood to teenhood as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
The leaders were usually sophomores and old hands at this event. The followers 
were freshmen, eager for initiation. The event had its long-established rules: 
The knights errant must respect the property, the value of the vines and the 
farmer's livestock. The farmer must defend his property without endangering the 
boys' lives. 
</P>
<P>
And so it went, each late summer and early fall until the first killing frost 
sent the boys on to apples and cider. 
</P>
<P>
But this night, the rules had been broken. Not by the boys. The vines were 
intact, no livestock had been bothered. Only seven perfectly ripe watermelons, 
separated from still-productive vines and left behind in the haste of retreat, 
were evidence of their raid. The farmer was the one in error. He had used a 
rifle, and in that land of guns and hunting, the lethal quality of a 
ricocheting bullet was well known and properly feared. 
</P>
<P>
No need for the boys' parents to broach the subject. This farmer's neighbors 
casually dropped by the next day to inspect the evidence and examine the damage 
-- if any. And, in a style similar in message, but individual in manner, they 
all expressed their dislike of a rifle as a weapon for defending watermelons. 
</P>
<P>
While a rifle ricochet could seriously wound and easily kill, the shot from a 
shotgun won't have that same effect, if fired from a respectful distance. Of 
course, buckshot will penetrate Levis and make long hours in classrooms pretty 
painful for a day or two -- unless it's pried out with the blade of a pocket 
knife. Should the shell contain rock salt and not shot, the nose will sting and 
the tears will rise, no matter how you try to hold it back. But that's the down 
side of being a country boy cavalier, and it was all part of the rules. 
</P>
<P>
One recent night, as the Santa Anas brought a sensory memory of summer into the 
yard, I wandered outside to ponder what I'd just read in the day's paper, more 
reports of the teen-age gang wars in Los Angeles. The moon and stars were clear 
and lit small reflections in the pool, and something in the nose reminded me of 
that night and the relief I felt that I was the sophomore behind the wheel of 
the Model A and wouldn't have to go through Watermelon Night again. 
</P>
<P>
There were no gangs then. Our ritual was just a teen-age boy's duty. Some peers 
made the mistake of stealing chickens or destroying outbuildings, and the 
consequences they suffered were in proportion, but done by the rules; there was 
no cause for retribution, tears or quarantine. 
</P>
<P>
I couldn't help but wonder what had gone awry in South-Central Los Angeles and 
other parts of this seemingly progressive and productive corner of God's 
country. Of course, there's a vast difference between the sparse population of 
the hilly clay farm country of southern Iowa in 1948 and this overcrowded urban 
sprawl of 1989. But, I suspect, the rising of teen-age sap is a stronger bond 
of similarity than the disparity of southern Iowa's citizenry and the cultural 
mix that is Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Who broke the rules? Where did the rites of passage go amiss? 
</P>
<P>
The one city marshal and the one justice of the peace managed to do their jobs 
and keep the rules and ritual in place. No fear, no vindictiveness, just, 
"That's what you boys did, and here's what you must do now." They saw that we, 
too, observed the rules and respected the ritual. 
</P>
<P>
The marshal, Rusty, didn't carry a gun or wear a belt loaded with 10 pounds of 
law-enforcing accessories. He was especially tempting, fair game for a 
teen-ager's quest for acceptable notoriety. 
</P>
<P>
One night, while Rusty was having coffee or checking the back door of a local 
store, I relieved him of the fly rod on the back seat of his '36 Ford. A couple 
of weeks later, after basking in the praise of my peers, I replaced the fly 
rod, unharmed and unused (who could use something everyone recognized?), back 
where I found it, when the opportunity presented itself. 
</P>
<P>
The following morning, on the way to school, my Model A stopped for a breather. 
As I repaired it, Rusty stopped, helped me start it and, as I eased back onto 
the road, told me he was going out to the lake that day. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder if the rules still hold in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Here, they have Uzis.

REFORMERS RISK ALL IN ROMANIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM PFAFF, William Pfaff is a syndicated columnist based in Paris. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The dramatic, even hysterical, physical construction, reconstruction and 
destruction of Romania on the will or whim of Nicolae Ceausescu has conveyed an 
intimation of the end -- an end that may now be approaching. 
</P>
<P>
An open letter of protest addressed to the Romanian dictator March 10 by six 
senior figures in the Romanian Communist Party, including one of the party 
founders, 94-year-old Constantin Parvulescu, is certain to have serious backing 
elsewhere in the party and government. 
</P>
<P>
It is virtually certain, as well, to enjoy support from the Soviet Union, 
although one of the signers, Silviu Brucan, former ambassador to the United 
Nations and former editor of the Communist Party newspaper, was arrested last 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The ability of the Soviet authorities to intervene in Romania's internal 
situation or even to protect the six is by no means assured. The program of the 
Ceausescu regime is implicitly anti-Soviet, exploiting the old hostility of 
Romanians towards Russia. 
</P>
<P>
The statement by the six, that they are acting "at the risk of their liberty 
and even of their lives," is thus the exact truth. These men say that they are 
making this protest out of duty, "because the present policy of Romania 
compromises the idea of socialism for which they have struggled, and has 
isolated Romania internationally." 
</P>
<P>
Their initiative brings the internal Romanian crisis into the open; until now 
it has been stifled by police repression and obscured by Nicolae Ceausescu's 
program of false nationalism. Sumptuous boulevards and public buildings have 
been constructed for the grandeur of the Romanian nation, while the Romanian 
people groaned in cold and winter darkness, trekking from shop to market in the 
daily search for something to eat. 
</P>
<P>
The six say in their letter: "A government which for five winters has failed to 
resolve problems so vital as those of heating, the provision of electricity, 
transport and food for the population is incompetent, incapable of governing." 
Among their demands is that the export of Romania's agricultural output, "which 
threatens the biological survival of our people," be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
The charges made are those that exiled Romanians and foreign observers have 
made for years. This letter was issued the day after Romania was condemned by 
the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations in Geneva -- a vote in which 
the Soviet Union abstained, as did Bulgaria and the East German delegation. 
</P>
<P>
The emigre writer, Eugene Ionesco, told the political commission of the 
European Parliament in February that Romania's situation is one of "cultural 
genocide." Romania, he said, is "making a final departure from Europe itself." 
</P>
<P>
Infant mortality in Romania is now the highest in Europe, despite a government 
program of population increase demanding five children from every woman of 
child-bearing age and forbidding abortion as well as contraceptives. The old 
are expected to die without burdening the country's declining medical 
facilities. Male life expectancy now is only 66 years. The ration of meat for a 
worker in Brasov, Romania's second city, in 1987 was 8.5 kilos (less than 20 
pounds) for the entire year. 
</P>
<P>
The independent culture and languages of national minorities -- Hungarian, 
German and Serbian -- are cruelly repressed. More than 13,000 ethnic Hungarian 
refugees from Romania were given residence permits in Hungary last year alone, 
and it is believed that a like number are living undeclared in Hungary. 
Hungary's consulates in Bucharest and the Transylvanian city of Cluj have been 
closed by the Romanian authorities. 
</P>
<P>
In Bucharest at the beginning of March, one of the signers of the open letter 
(its existence then still unknown) made it possible for me to see another 
document he had signed. It argued that multi-party government was inappropriate 
for Romania today, but called for pluralism inside the Romanian Communist Party 
-- real and open debate among the party's members and leaders, with decisions 
taken openly as the outcome of those debates. 
</P>
<P>
I did not understand at the time what he wanted me to do about this document. 
It now seems clear that he wanted it made known internationally that the aims 
of these Communist patriarchs -- who include a former foreign minister, a 
former president of the National Assembly, the No. 2 figure in the party before 
1972 and head of the Communist unions -- are wholly consistent with 
contemporary Communist orthodoxy and reform. 
</P>
<P>
These six old men challenging Ceausescu do not ask for communism to end in 
Romania. They ask for restoration of the constitution, "virtually suspended" 
today, "constructive dialogue" and "restoration of the constitutional rights 
and individual liberties of citizens." They want to save the system, not wreck 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Theirs, no doubt, is an aim that may properly provoke bitterness; they helped 
make this system what it was when Nicolae Ceausescu took over. Nonetheless, 
today they take their lives in their hands to defy manifest injustice. They 
honor the Romanian nation; they deserve urgent support from Western governments 
and Western public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
International outrage can make a difference, even in Ceausescu's Romania.

JOHN TOWER'S REJECTION BY THE SENATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle's foot-stamping, emotional response to the Tower 
defeat, accusing the Democrats in the Senate of "using McCarthyite mud-slinging 
tactics" against Tower as part of a deliberate campaign to undermine the 
presidency (Part I, March 11) seems an odd route for him to take to screech at 
the 53 senators who voted against Tower's confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
Given Quayle's ultra-conservative views and his family's past affiliation with 
the John Birch Society, it would not be far-fetched to assume that Quayle would 
have stood up to be counted as one of Joe McCarthy's staunchest supporters.

UPROAR OVER TWO FLAG EXHIBITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The response of offended Muslims to the book "The Satanic Verses" is not unlike 
the response of Christians to the movie "The Last Temptation of Christ." The 
difference is in degree: violence or peaceful demonstration. But the basic 
issue of each is the violation of conscience and the fear of misinterpretation 
of truth in their religion. 
</P>
<P>
Now, consciences are being violated as the American flag is walked on in the 
name of art. The consciences of citizens hurt as the symbol of unity is defiled 
for the artist's individual freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Is there no end to the discounting of others' beliefs? To be effective, freedom 
always has to have limits (such as obedience to the law); but a far greater 
limit is that of not doing anything that would hurt my brother.

JOHN TOWER'S REJECTION BY THE SENATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The editorial was an outstanding summation on the culpability of a failed 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
The defense procurement scandal is one of the biggest problems the Pentagon and 
the country face. For a President to nominate and senators to vote for an 
individual with even an iota of a question as to the individual's involvement 
in such activity is real evidence of partisan politics. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest complaint put forth by Tower and his supporters seems to be the 
high level of public scrutiny which he was subjected to. I have always been 
taught that public scrutiny should be a proud moment. Can the U.S. afford to 
have a man, or a party, who adheres to any other train of thought? 
</P>
<P>
There must be an ulterior motive for the President to go out on such a limb. It 
would be very interesting to see exactly what Tower and his defense cohorts 
funneled to the Bush campaign.

If the Senate means what it says, then this important body should ban the sale

This premise logically follows from the Senate's recent majority vote which 
recognized that the nation must not be dependent upon brains clouded by 
alcohol.

As the sun sets on the political ambitions of Tower, I take pen in hand to 
express my appreciation to our Senate and its members. Although at first glance 
it appears that Towers's defeat was solely the product of partisan politics, a 
closer examination of the facts reveals that Tower simply lacked the required 
moral rectitude. Why else would Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) vote against him?

FUROR OVER BIBLE SCHOLARS ON SECOND COMING OF CHRIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Jesus Seminar scholars are fulfilling Bible prophecy they decry when they 
proclaim that Jesus did not say He would return. The Bible says, " . . . In the 
last days mockers will come with their mocking . . . saying, 'Where is the 
promise of His coming?' For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all continues 
just as it was from the beginning of creation" (II Peter 3:3,4). 
</P>
<P>
The scoffers of the academe must establish their biblical credibility by 
explaining who Jesus was. In John 14:28, Jesus said to his disciples and to the 
multitudes who would believe in him throughout the ages, "I said unto you, I go 
away, and come again unto you." If he does not return, then he is a liar and 
the entire Christian faith is based upon a falsehood. The truth of the second 
coming dominates the New Testament; it is mentioned 318 times, more often than 
any other fundamental doctrine. 
</P>
<P>
These academicians may be wise in other subjects, but they should not be called 
biblical scholars, since they would have to cut out a major portion of their 
Bibles. They would not be left with a shred of evidence for their premise. We 
are grateful to Beutner for warning us that most major universities and 
seminaries agree with the findings. It should urge open-minded people to search 
the Scriptures for themselves -- before it is too late.

JOHN TOWER'S REJECTION BY THE SENATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rejection of Tower should sound a warning to all. Tower was denied the post 
because of alcohol abuse. It is time for everyone to remember that alcohol is a 
drug and drug abuse will get you. Just because alcohol has been maintained as a 
legal drug by a well-entrenched industry does not mean that it is not a 
dangerous drug. MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) is a household word 
because alcohol abuse is fatally dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
We all look at derelicts sleeping in the streets, clutching their bottles of 
booze, and say, "That could never happen to me." Look at Tower and ask 
yourself, "Could that happen to me?" If your answer is, "Nah, I just drink to 
have fun," then you, too, have a drug problem.

JOHN TOWER'S REJECTION BY THE SENATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's obvious that you have never seen a Democrat you didn't like. Your latest 
atrocity concerns the Tower nomination "Tower's Alamo" (March 10) where you 
paper over the complete and total destruction of a man and his reputation. John 
Tower was not rejected as secretary of defense because of his ethics or 
temperament, but because Senate Democrats were going to prove to President 
George Bush, very early on, who was really in charge. 
</P>
<P>
When Bush extended his hand to the Democrats earlier this year in a spirit of 
bipartisanship, the Democrats were all smiles and friendly nods. They were 
still smiling and nodding when they used Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), the human 
butcher knife, to chop Bush's hand off. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Democrats are not interested in bipartisanship, they are interested 
in power. After destroying Tower, they have that power. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, President Bush is calling for bipartisanship, and once again those 
Democrats are smiling and nodding.

UPROAR OVER TWO FLAG EXHIBITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "3,000 Protest Chicago Exhibit of Flag on Floor," Part I, March 
13: 
</P>
<P>
The outcry over Scott Tyler's exhibit at the Art Institute of Chicago is so 
great that I had to write. He is displaying the flag on the floor with a ledger 
above the display inviting comments. People are invited or forced to walk on 
the flag in order to write their thoughts in the ledger. 
</P>
<P>
Scott maintains that he has a constitutional right of free speech, and has the 
right to display the flag in that manner. I would like to tell Scott that he is 
very much mistaken. The flag is not art. It is a symbol of our nation. It 
represents ideals, including free speech. 
</P>
<P>
When someone desecrates the symbol, then he makes a mockery of the ideals of 
that symbol. Scott is a hypocrite because he mocks the very ideal he says he 
has a right to. That ideal is free speech. 
</P>
<P>
When you value rights, you should not be so quick to desecrate the very symbol 
that gave them to you. So, Scott, swallow your pride and close your exhibit; 
you made your point, as weak as it was.

VOTES UNCHANGED;

<P>
SIMI SCHOOL BOND ISSUE LOSES AGAIN IN BALLOT RECOUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A vote recount has confirmed the defeat of a Simi Valley school bond measure, 
school officials announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The recount by Ventura County election officials showed that Measure B, which 
had to be approved by more than two-thirds of the voters to pass, garnered 
66.1%, or 6,929 votes, in the March 7 special election. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the measure would have provided $8 million to build gymnasiums and 
an auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't change a single vote," Chet Howe, a spokesman for the Simi Valley 
Unified School District, said of the recount. "But the election was so close -- 
we only needed 59 more votes to win -- that we felt we owed it to the 66% who 
voted for it to double-check the outcome." 
</P>
<P>
The district spent about $2,000 for the recount, including the salary of a San 
Francisco attorney who specializes in election law. 
</P>
<P>
Howe said officials are disappointed with the defeat of Measure B. But he noted 
that a second school bond measure, Measure A, won handily. 
</P>
<P>
Measure A, which will provide $35 million to upgrade the district's 27 schools, 
passed last week with 70.5%, or 7,410 votes. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley school officials campaigned aggressively for both bond measures. 
</P>
<P>
A citizens committee supporting the measures recruited more than 200 
volunteers, and raised more than $6,000 to hire a political consultant and pay 
for other campaign expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Howe said officials will decide later this month whether to put the $8-million 
bond measure on the November ballot.

<P>
An 18-year-old woman is dead and a 19-year-old man faces a possible 
manslaughter charge as a result of a head-on collision in Clairemont, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Angela Sue Reed, who was a passenger in a car driven by Michael Colletti, was 
pronounced dead at the scene of the collision Thursday in the 3500 block of 
Mount Abbey Avenue, police spokesman Dave Cohen said. Colletti was in fair 
condition at Sharp Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Colletti was traveling north on a curved stretch of Mt. Abbey Avenue about 4:10 
p.m. at high speed when his car crossed into traffic, hitting an oncoming motor 
home, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
The two passengers in the motor home, who complained of minor pains, were taken 
to Kaiser Permanente Hospital, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Reed nor Colletti was wearing a seat belt, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen said police will recommend to the district attorney's office that 
Colletti, a San Diego resident, be charged with misdemeanor manslaughter.

A man whom police have dubbed the "Walk-to-the-Back" bandit, robbed a beauty 
supply store Friday for an undisclosed amount of cash, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The robbery is believed to be one in a series of more than 30 similar holdups 
that began in December, San Diego police spokesman Bill Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The bandit walked into Lubey Beauty and Barber Supply in the 3600 block of 
Midway Drive just after 4 p.m., showed a handgun and ordered a female clerk to 
walk to the back of the store, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
He rifled the cash register and fled, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
He has robbed small businesses in East San Diego, La Mesa and El Cajon, usually 
selecting one where a female employee is working alone, Robinson said.

KARIC SCORES THREE AS SOCKERS GET IT RIGHT AGAINST THE BLAST 
</P>

<P>
Whew. 
</P>
<P>
That's about how Socker Coach Ron Newman felt after the Sockers' 5-4 victory 
over Baltimore Friday night at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
And he expressed it simply. "It can't go on forever." 
</P>
<P>
Now he can breath more easily. The Sockers took a pound of flesh back Friday 
night. Baltimore, now four games ahead of the second-place Sockers, had won the 
five previous meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime you play a team that has that much offensive power, you start to get 
nervous when they get within one goal," Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
And there are five reasons for that, the most recent being last Friday's loss. 
</P>
<P>
A look back: 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers were the victim of a strange, game-winning goal by Mark Mettrick. 
His shot hopped off stray feet and open carpet with 52 seconds remaining to 
give the Blast a 3-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
So the 7,859 at the Sports Arena held their breaths throughout Friday, waiting 
for something strange to take this one away from the Sockers. And waiting. But 
this time, the Sockers went all 15 rounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody said before the game, 'This game must win,' " said forward Zoran 
Karic, who led the Sockers by scoring the first three-goal hat trick of his 
MISL career. 
</P>
<P>
Twice it appeared the game might slip away. 
</P>
<P>
With 53 seconds remaining in the third quarter and the Sockers a man down, 
Blast midfielder Carl Valentine shot from the top of the penalty arch. Domenic 
Mobilio nicked the ball, which then bounced into the right corner of the Socker 
goal. That cut the Sockers' lead to 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after Karic scored his third goal to give the Sockers a 5-3 advantage, 
San Diego midfielder Paul Dougherty was whistled for a hand ball in the penalty 
box. Valentine took the shot and scored, and with 9:52 remaining, things were 
tight again. 
</P>
<P>
But this time there would be no strange goals. The crowd clapped nervously at 
first and then got louder with each minute the Sockers held Baltimore away from 
the goal. Socker goalie Victor Nogueira knocked down a rocket by David Byrne 
with 40 seconds left, and people started to believe. Most of all, the players. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a lot of close games, and they got the bounces," midfielder Branko 
Segota said. 
</P>
<P>
This time, they didn't. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers came out fast, scoring four first-half goals. It looked as if the 
would take charge easily. But in the second half, the offense faded. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't like we played them in the first half," Newman said. "We struggled a 
bit in the second half. We battled them this time, but they're a team that 
keeps coming back. In the second half, you couldn't really see that they're a 
team that has been on the road and was a yard short." 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers took a 3-1 lead, scoring as many goals in the first quarter as they 
have in the past two meetings with Baltimore. And they had scored three goals 
in the first quarter just one other time this season, Feb. 19 against Tacoma. 
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, forward Steve Zungul helped give the Sockers a 4-2 
halftime lead, scoring inside the penalty box after Segota stopped the ball and 
flicked a pass to his right. 
</P>
<P>
Karic scored two of the three first-quarter Socker goals. The first came with 
7:47 remaining off an assist from Zungul. Twelve seconds earlier, Blast 
defender Tim Wittman tied the score, 1-1, on a left-footed, unassisted shot 
that slipped underneath Nogueira. 
</P>
<P>
Karic scored again with 1:29 remaining in the first, taking a free kick from 
Gus Mokalis in the middle of the penalty box and drilling it to the top of the 
net. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers made their first score look easy against Scott Manning, a goalie 
who had melted their offense with spectacular saves in five previous meetings. 
Cacho crossed the ball into the middle from the right sideline, Karic made a 
nifty move, letting the ball graze his right foot and go through his legs, and 
Segota drilled it in. Sockers 1, Blast 0, just 1:49 into the game.

PADRE NOTEBOOK; 
</P>
<P>
CORA GETS LOOK AT POSSIBLE NEW CAREER OPTION 
</P>

<P>
Once, Joey Cora was being groomed to be the next Alan Wiggins. Now he might be 
angling to become the next Mike Brumley or Gary Green -- the player most likely 
to back up Garry Templeton at shortstop for the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
Having played second base almost exclusively since joining the Padre 
organization in 1985, Cora is now getting a look at shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
Cora played all eight innings of a 7-5 loss to San Francisco in a "B" game 
Friday afternoon at Sun Desert Stadium. It was Cora's fourth appearance at 
shortstop this spring and in some ways his shakiest. After three errorless 
games, including a 10-assist "B" game against the Angels Tuesday, Cora made two 
throwing errors against the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"Arm strength is the biggest difference," Cora said of the change. 
</P>
<P>
Cora is not unfamiliar with the position; he was a two-time All-Southeastern 
Conference shortstop at Vanderbilt. But he has played shortstop only 
occasionally since he was selected by the Padres in the first round of the June 
1985 1985 free-agent draft and asked to play second. 
</P>
<P>
Cora made a rapid rise through the Padre system, starting Opening Day at second 
in 1987. But he struggled; his usually reliable hitting failed him. He was 
batting .237 when he was demoted to triple-A Las Vegas on June 8 if 1987, then 
.276 in 81 games at Las Vegas and hit .296 last season. In the meantime, his 
role as the Padres' best young second base prospect was passed to Roberto 
Alomar. 
</P>
<P>
With 21-year-old Alomar at second, Cora, 23, might find a brighter future at 
short. The Padres are looking for someone to spell Templeton, 33. Brumley and 
Green began the spring as the most likely candidates, and while little has 
changed, Manager Jack McKeon said he wanted to give Cora an opportunity to show 
what he could do. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to give everyone who is competing for the infield position a chance," 
McKeon said. "You never known what can happen, and we want to be fair to 
everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Of the others looking to earn the final infield spot, Brumley is considered the 
stronger hitter and Green the better fielder. 
</P>
<P>
Cora said he is not sure what to make of his recent playing time at shortstop. 
He said he has not discussed the experiment with McKeon but said he doesn't 
expect it result in a permanent change. 
</P>
<P>
"I figure it's just a chance to show my versatility," Cora said. 
</P>
<P>
Left-handed pitcher Eric Nolte, who made the jump from Class A to the major 
leagues in 1987 only to be demoted early last season to triple-A Las Vegas, 
underwent surgery Thursday for a perforated ulcer, a club spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Nolte became ill during a meal Thursday and was taken to Yuma Regional Medical 
Center, where surgery was performed by Dr. Dirk Frauenfelder. Nolte is expected 
to be in the hospital for three or four days. He is expected to miss at least 
two or three weeks, McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
Nolte had pitched six innings in three games, allowing one run, striking out 
five and earning two saves. 
</P>
<P>
Nolte, 24, was called up to the Padres late in the 1987 season and won a 6-0 
decision against Houston in his major-league debut. He won only one of his next 
seven decisions but pitched well in most games, allowing two or less runs in 
eight of his 12 starts. 
</P>
<P>
Nolte made two relief appearances early last season before he was sent down to 
Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Nolte, 24, is 2-6 with a 3.33 ERA in 14 major-league games. 
</P>
<P>
Also, McKeon said that outfielder Shane Mack would miss at least a week to 10 
days with a sore right elbow. McKeon said it is not known if surgery will be 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tim Flannery walked with the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth to give 
the Padres (9-4-1) a 9-8 victory over San Francisco (5-11) in front of a 
sellout crowd of 6,332 at Sun Desert Stadium Friday night. The Giants had tied 
the game at eight with three runs off winning pitcher Pat Clements (1-0) in the 
ninth. Flannery walked against losing pitcher Doug Robertson (0-1). Left 
fielder Carmelo Martinez hit a three-run homer in the first, his fourth of the 
spring and the the Padres' 10th in the past eight games after they failed to 
hit one in their first six. They had just nine in 27 spring games last year. . 
. . It was the first sellout of a night game in Yuma in the Padres' 21 seasons 
here, and the first time they had sold out three consecutive games . . . Padre 
first baseman Rob Nelson had a walk, a single, a double and three RBIs in a 7-5 
loss in the "B" game. . . . The Padres continue their nine-game home stand 
today with their fourth game of the spring against the Giants. Game time is 
12:05 PST. Dennis Rasmussen (0-1, 1.29 ERA) will start for the Padres against 
the Giants' Don Robinson (0-0, 0.00 ERA). Rasmussen was the losing pitcher in 
an 8-6 Giant victory March 8. Mark Grant and Mark Davis also are expected to 
pitch for the Padres. Joe Price and Mike LaCoss should see relief work for the 
Giants. . . . About 1,000 general admission tickets remain for each of the 
Padres' next two games -- today against the Giants and Sunday against Seattle 
at 12:05 PST. They will go on sale 2 1/2 hours before each game. . . . The 
Padres are expected to make their first cut of the spring sometime this 
weekend. They have 43 players in camp, including 36 on the major-league roster.

EFFECT OF SIDEKICK PROBLEMS UNKNOWN

Ron Fowler, owner of the Sockers, said Friday that it is premature to speculate 
about how the financial difficulties of the Dallas Sidekicks will affect the 
remainder of the Major Indoor Soccer League season. 
</P>
<P>
Robert McGuire, a U.S. bankruptcy judge, ruled Thursday in Dallas that the 
Sidekicks must post $260,000 by 1:30 p.m. Monday or face foreclosure by their 
major creditor, Dallas Basketball LTD. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 13, the Sidekicks filed for Chapter 11 protection after learning the 
Dallas Mavericks, the team's previous owner, planned to request an order in 
state court for the Sidekicks to surrender all assets because of an outstanding 
note of $360,000 that was due in July of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Socker President Ron Cady said there is nothing at this point that would lead 
him to believe that the Sidekicks will be prevented from playing the remainder 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The MISL has requested a 72-hour postponement of Monday's deadline to give 
directors from each team an opportunity to discuss solutions. Fowler will 
participate in a conference call Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping the judge will honor the request," Fowler said. "We want to make 
sure we can look at the options in an enlightened manner without the pressure 
of Monday's deadline." DON PATTERSON

BOWLING LEAPS TO FORE IN UPSET OF KENNEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eddie Bowling of Canoga Park High made a name for himself last season in the 
high jump, winning the City Section championship. And in the early stages of 
the '89 season, he has developed into a standout in the long jump and triple 
jump as well. 
</P>
<P>
He won all three events in a Northwest Valley Conference track meet against 
Kennedy on Friday, as the Hunters upset the Golden Cougars, 66-59, at Canoga 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
Bowling, a senior, also anchored the victorious mile relay (3 minutes, 35.2 
seconds) as Canoga Park (2-1, 2-1 in league meets) won nine of 15 events, 
including both relays. 
</P>
<P>
Bowling, who leaped 6 feet, 4 inches in the high jump, 21-5 in the long jump 
and 43-10 in the triple jump, had plenty of help from his teammates, 
particularly Robin Kim. 
</P>
<P>
Kim won the 100 in 10.8 seconds, the 200 in 22.4, anchored Canoga Park's 
victorious 400 relay (44.2) and ran the third leg on the mile relay. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy (2-1) was paced by George Duran, who won the 1,600 (4:49.0) and 3,200 
(10:25.6). 
</P>
<P>
In other boys' meets: 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham 96, Poly 31 -- After missing last week's meet because of 
disciplinary reasons, the Braves' Rodney Burt returned with a vengeance in the 
Valley Pac-8 Conference meet at Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
Burt won the 100 in 11.1, the 200 in 22.7, the 400 in 49.7 and anchored the 
victorious 400 relay (44.5) as Birmingham (3-0) remained undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
Taft 95, Granada Hills 32 -- Cornell Hill won two events for Taft in the 
Northwest Valley Conference meet at home. Hill won the high jump at 6-0 and the 
long jump at 21-1 as the Toreadors (2-1) won all five field events. Teammate 
Rejesh Chauhan won the pole vault at 13-0. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando 72, Chatsworth 51 -- Ibed Aguirre and Keary Johns each won two 
events for the Tigers (2-1) in the Northwest Valley Conference meet at 
Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Aguirre won the mile (4:38.6) and two mile (10:19.0), and Johns won the 
120-yard high hurdles (15.5) and the 330-yard intermediate hurdles (43.4). 
</P>
<P>
Cornelius Edwards won the 440 (51.9) and triple jump (43-1 1/2) for Chatsworth 
(1-2). 
</P>
<P>
Monroe 82, Sylmar 33 -- Derril White won the 100 (11.3) and long jump (20-5 
1/2) for Monroe (3-0) in a Valley Pac-8 Conference meet at home. 
</P>
<P>
GIRLS 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy 76, Canoga Park 29 -- Natasha Como won the 100 (13.1) and 200 (28.0) 
meters for Kennedy in the Northwest Valley Conference meet at Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
The victory improved Kennedy's record to 3-0. The Golden Cougars have a 99-5 
dual-meet record since the girls' team was formed in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham 76 1/2, Poly 32 1/2 -- Freshman Heather Ballard won four events for 
Birmingham in the Valley Pac-8 Conference meet at home. 
</P>
<P>
Ballard ran 2:37.9 in the 800 and 52.7 in the 300 low hurdles, leaped 4-8 in 
the high jump and put the shot, 28-11. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills 58, Taft 51 -- Toreador sophomore Jane Kim won four events, but 
Granada Hills prevailed in the Northwest Valley Conference meet at Taft. 
</P>
<P>
Kim won the 220-yard dash (27.6), the 100-meter low hurdles (16.3), the 300 
hurdles (49.5) and the long jump (15-6).

BURNHAM TO FACE STATE-MEET RIVAL IN SPRINT AT CSUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Angela Burnham of Rio Mesa High and Inger Miller of Muir, first- and 
second-place finishers in the 100 meters at last year's state championships, 
will meet in that event today during the Northridge-Alemany Relays at Cal State 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham, the defending state champion in the 100 and 200 meters, won the 200 in 
24.80 seconds in the National Scholastic Indoor Championships in Annapolis, 
Md., last Sunday and ran a nation-leading 11.84 in the 100 in the Spartan 
Relays at Rio Mesa two weeks ago. Miller has run a hand-timed 11.6 this season, 
which is the equivalent of Burnham's fully automatic 11.84. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Dameworth of Agoura, Mike Williamson of Thousand Oaks and Morgan Bateman 
of Crescenta Valley will meet in the boys' 1,500. Dameworth and Williamson also 
will compete in the 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth is the two-time defending state Division I cross-country champion; 
Williamson ran second in last year's state championships. Bateman is the 
defending Southern Section 4-A Division champion in the 800 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne's Curtis Conway, the state's fastest returning sprinter, is favored 
in the boys' 100. Crespi's Russell White also will compete. 
</P>
<P>
Conway placed second and third in the 100 and 200 at last year's state meet; 
White finished eighth in the 200. White is also entered in the triple jump, an 
event in which he placed second in the 1987 state championships. JOHN ORTEGA

<P>
Heavyweight boxer John Bray of Van Nuys won a unanimous three-round decision 
over Irish national champion Sean O'Reagan on Friday at Caesars Atlantic City 
during a U.S.-Ireland amateur dual meet. 
</P>
<P>
The United States won the meet, 7-3, in the first head-to-head meeting between 
the nations since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Bray, 18, who had not fought since losing in the final of the Western Olympic 
Trials last May, said that the layoff had hurt him. He also pinned some of his 
problems on failing to maintain his prefight strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"I got away from my game plan," Bray said. "First I was going to box him, but 
then I thought I could hurt him. I thought I could have taken him out with my 
right hand, but it didn't happen." STEVEN HERBERT

<P>
The Cal State Northridge men's volleyball team has been struggling to find the 
winning combination. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night at the CSUN gym it was more of the same. The Matadors played well, 
but not well enough, and were swept by Long Beach State, 15-11, 15-8, 17-15, in 
a Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. match. 
</P>
<P>
Fifth-ranked Long Beach State (16-5, 7-4 in conference play) sailed through the 
first game, helped by CSUN's eight service faults. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers also controlled the second game before CSUN awoke to make a match of 
it in the final game. 
</P>
<P>
Setter Tom Ribarich paced the Matadors (7-15, 2-11) with 47 assists and 15 
digs. Outside hitter Bob Samuelson added 22 kills and three assists and Neil 
Coffman had 17 kills. PAUL OLSON

ABBOTT TO BUY PANCRETEC FOR $54 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, San Diego County Business Editor

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pancretec, a San Diego County-based medical equipment manufacturer that staged 
a remarkable comeback from the brink of financial ruin, will be acquired by 
Abbott Laboratories for $54 million, according to a tentative agreement 
announced by the companies Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott, a diversified health-care firm based in North Chicago, Ill., will pay 
$15 a share pending approval by Pancretec shareholders at a meeting scheduled 
tentatively for July. The $54 million includes Abbott's purchase of outstanding 
preferred shares and assumes the exercise of Pancretec stock options and stock 
purchase warrants. 
</P>
<P>
The merger is also contingent on a definitive agreement, a favorable vote by 
Abbott's and Pancretec's boards of directors and receipt by Pancretec of a 
favorable outside opinion as to the financial fairness of Abbott's offer. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Bernardo-based Pancretec makes portable drug-infusion pumps used for 
outpatients' medication. Buoyed by growth in the home health-care industry, 
Pancretec is agreeing to be acquired at a time when profits are climbing and 
its sales are growing at a nearly 100% annual rate. 
</P>
<P>
For the fiscal year ended June 30, the company reported a $302,000 profit on 
sales of $6 million, up from a loss of $932,000 on sales of $2.9 million in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott spokeswoman Cathy Babington said Pancretec's advanced technology and 
strong market position are what attracted Abbott to the relatively small San 
Diego company. 
</P>
<P>
"We also sell drug-infusion pumps, and, once the merger is complete, this will 
enhance our position," she said, declining to specify how much of Abbott's $4.9 
billion in annual sales are derived from pump sales. 
</P>
<P>
Pancretec's strong sales and earnings growth have continued so far this year, 
with net income reaching $688,000 on sales of $4.5 million for the two quarters 
ended Dec. 31, up from a loss of $89,000 on sales of $2.4 million for the 
corresponding six months in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Pancretec's performance was not always so sparkling. When the company hired Jim 
Yarter, a former C. R. Bard executive, as president in August, 1986, it was 
virtually out of cash and had a shareholder equity of negative $1 million. Its 
executive offices had become a revolving door: Yarter was the company's third 
chief executive in seven months. 
</P>
<P>
By increasing Pancretec's sales staff, improving technology and focusing on the 
market for drug pumps supplied to AIDS victims, Yarter turned Pancretec around. 
The profits have boosted Pancretec's stock price over the past 18 months from a 
low of $1.50 to Friday's close of $13.625. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Largest Shareholder 
</P>
<P>
Pancretec's largest shareholder is Ventana Growth Fund, a San Diego venture 
capital firm headed by Duwaine Townsen, which held 14.5% of Pancretec's common 
stock as of August. Ventana's initial investment of $700,000 in 1986 is now 
worth more than $5 million if its holdings have not changed. Townsen was 
unavailable for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Yarter owned 91,040 shares of Pancretec as of August, a stake that would be 
worth more than $1.3 million at the per-share price offered by Abbott. 
</P>
<P>
Pancretec employs 81 at its plant, none of whom will be laid off because of the 
merger, chief financial officer Joel Graff said Friday. Abbott employs 39,000.

SANDERLING BRINGS INSIGHTS TO SCHUMANN, TCHAIKOVSKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, Times Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Philharmonic re-examined two familiar fourth symphonies at the 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on Thursday -- Schumann's and Tchaikovsky's. Ho hum. 
</P>
<P>
The conductor was Kurt Sanderling. No ho hum. 
</P>
<P>
Sanderling is rapidly achieving cult status hereabouts. He deserves it. 
</P>
<P>
He invariably makes our orchestra play as if it were one of the finest in the 
world. The Philharmonic doesn't often rise to such heights, but he proves that 
it can. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't seem to know the meaning of routine. He takes nothing for granted, 
never relies on second-hand solutions to old problems, never confuses 
traditional Schlamperei (sloppiness, if you will) with authentic tradition. 
</P>
<P>
He actually makes audiences listen. Not one of the normally half-hearted but 
automatically demonstrative subscribers dared clap between movements on this 
occasion. Even the climactic cadence of Tchaikovsky's opening Andante was met 
with tense, attentive, ultra-appreciative silence. That means something. 
</P>
<P>
Sanderling doesn't dance on the podium, and he doesn't translate the musical 
sentiment into histrionic indulgence. There is nothing detached, however, about 
his conducting. He deals in essentials, sustains taut energy and rapt 
concentration, savors clarity and illuminating detail. 
</P>
<P>
In a day when most successful maestros tend either to be efficient technicians 
or muscular showmen, he remains a stubborn exponent of the old German school. 
He calmly analyzes the task at hand, defines the emotional content and projects 
inner meaning. The right notes in the right places are never enough. 
</P>
<P>
He does all this with degrees of warmth, clarity, dedication and intelligence 
that make even a stale ritual sound fresh. When was the last time you heard a 
tired critical churl -- amateur or professional -- get excited over the 
Tchaikovsky Fourth? 
</P>
<P>
This, indeed, was an exciting performance. It was dark and somber, for all its 
speed. It was stark and bleak, for all its dynamic sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
Sanderling gave us Tchaikovsky on a heroic, tragic scale. It was always 
soulful, never vulgar. 
</P>
<P>
He made the strings throb and the brass blare. Yet he sustained whispering 
pianissimo phrases in the Andantino, an extraordinarily gentle Scherzo and, 
wherever possible, ethereal flights of lyricism. Nothing was exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
The program magazine reprinted a rather self-conscious apologia in which the 
conductor claimed that the jubilation of the fiery finale was filtered through 
the composer's personal melancholia. The idea proved more persuasive in reading 
than in listening. Still, the performance remained a revelation on its own 
lofty aesthetic terms. 
</P>
<P>
The Schumann Fourth enjoyed comparably discerning virtues: strength without 
bombast, sentiment without gush, nuance without fuss. Romanticism lives. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes.

FACES . . .: NO TYPECASTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By JOHN M. WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He played a "nice geek" in "Real Genius." A "fresh-off-the-boat Japanese kid" 
in "Aloha Summer." Ralph Macchio's nasty nemesis in "Karate Kid II." He's a 
Korean-American gang member wrongly sent to prison in Columbia's "True 
Believer," and has just opened in a new play. 
</P>
<P>
Just becoming established as an actor at 29, Yuji Okumoto feels fortunate about 
the range of characters he's been able to portray. 
</P>
<P>
"Shu Kai Kim (his 'True Believer' character) starts out looking stereotypical 
-- all you see is this hardness," Okumoto said. "Then he starts dropping 
layers, and you finally see the sensitivity. His humanity comes through." 
</P>
<P>
Clean cut and strikingly handsome, Okumoto is relaxed and unusually affable 
during an interview. Yet he relishes the chance to play against that image. 
</P>
<P>
"I love playing bad guys. There are so many layers to them, they're so 
unpredictable. The audience doesn't know where they're going, what they're 
going to do next." 
</P>
<P>
Okumoto, who attended Hollywood High and Cal State Fullerton, spent four years 
in classes, stage productions and student films before earning a coveted Screen 
Actors Guild card six years ago for two days' work on a little-seen movie, "The 
Check Is in the Mail." 
</P>
<P>
He's now appearing in "Webster Street Blues," which opened Wednesday at 
East/West Players in East Hollywood. Written by the late Warren Kubota and 
directed by Nobu McCarthy, the play follows the lives of four friends in San 
Francisco's "Japan town" during the early 1970s. Okumoto will portray an 
insecure, sensitive man hiding behind a tough exterior. It's the first 
production at East/West since founder Mako stepped down as artistic director 
after 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
As for his film and TV career, Okumoto said, "As an actor and as an Asian 
individual, you want to avoid stereotype; you don't want to embarrass your 
race. (But) I don't even think about (ethnic) typecasting at this point. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to work and learn." JOHN M. WILSON

OPERA, WITH NO QUOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was at the March 4 performance of "Tancredi" by the Music Center Opera 
Company and I found the handling of Chris Merritt's laryngitis ingenious. I 
enjoyed seeing him perform and lip-sync the words, and I found the generosity 
of Merritt and the rest of the cast toward Stephen Gould (who did the actual 
singing) refreshing. 
</P>
<P>
If that makes me an "opera" lover rather than an opera (no quotes) lover, so be 
it. 
</P>

William Stockman (Letters, March 11) says we got what we deserved. He thinks 
someone else deserves his seat. I think he does not deserve our splendid Music 
Center Opera Company.

CRITICISM OF ARMAND HAMMER'S MUSEUM

While Armand Hammer's "museum grows in Westwood," hordes of mentally ill, 
hungry and homeless humans are growing as well. You will pardon me if I do not 
cry "Hallelujah!" at Mr. Hammer's gift to humanity and himself. 
</P>
<P>
If he wants to "build a permanent reminder of his accomplishments" let him 
build schools, hospitals and housing for the destitute instead of spending 
millions on a memorial for himself.

Hammer can play his philanthropist/humanitarian number until hell freezes over. 
The fact is he took advantage of one of the world's greatest tragedies (the 
Russian Revolution) in order to acquire priceless art objects for a pittance.

Come June 16, the fearsome foursome rides again, as Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, 
Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson don their silver suits in "Ghostbusters II." 
Explains Hudson: "We find out there's a lot of bad psycho-reactive energy in 
New York City that's threatening the universe, so we have to work very hard 
against time to save the world. It's really kind of cute." 
</P>
<P>
Then there's "Leviathan." In the just-released feature, Hudson co-stars with 
Peter Weller, Amanda Pays and Richard Crenna as a group of underwater miners 
who discover a sunken Russian ship. Unfortunately, this sunken ship comes with 
a (surprise!) monster. "It's a thriller," Hudson says, "but there's not a lot 
of gore. Really. Not too many heads get ripped off." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Michigan native is glad not to be moving around for a 
while, after a busy work schedule that's had him on the run for the last couple 
of years. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time in a while I haven't had a job lined up," Hudson 
admitted. "In 1987 I did 'Weeds' (filming in San Francisco, New York, North 
Carolina and Chicago), then 'Collision Course' (North Carolina and Detroit) 
with Jay Leno and Pat Morita. 
</P>
<P>
"Then 'The Wrong Guy' -- that kind of came and went -- with Richard Lewis, 
Franklin Ajaye and John Goodman (Wyoming), then 'The Dirty Dozen 4' 
(Yugoslavia) and 'Leviathan' (Italy). Then it was back here for 'Ghostbusters 
II.' " JANICE ARKATOV

<P>
CBS' prime-time news magazines go overseas this weekend to provide provocative 
insight into two war-ravaged lands. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight at 10 p.m. (2)(8), "West 57th" focuses on El Salvador on the eve of 
that country's presidential election. The right-wing Arena party, long 
associated with the infamous death squads, is expected to win the election just 
as leftist guerrillas are stepping up their efforts to topple the government. 
The program also includes an interview with Vice President Dan Quayle, who 
asserts that despite the Arena party's ties to military terror, the United 
States will not waver in its longtime financial and military support of the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"60 Minutes" travels Sunday to Vietnam at 7 p.m. (2)(8) and interviews North 
Vietnamese veterans of the war with the United States, whose stories, 
correspondent Morley Safer says, "hauntingly parallel" those of our own Vietnam 
veterans. "60 Minutes" also includes a report on an effective but controversial 
Los Angeles Police Department special investigation unit. 
</P>
<P>
For entertainment, meanwhile, Judy Garland and the gang make their annual 
appearance in "The Wizard of Oz," Sunday at 8 p.m. (2)(8), and Oprah Winfrey 
stars at 9 p.m. in the first installment of the two-part drama, "The Women of 
Brewster Place" (3)(7)(10)(42). STEVE WEINSTEIN

For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen: 
</P>
<P>
Now is a good time to look for dwarf citrus at nurseries. Consider using dwarf 
citrus in large containers for a decorative touch and a tasty harvest of 
full-sized fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Spring is the time to start a regular fertilizing program for all areas of the 
garden. 
</P>
<P>
This is a good time to plant star jasmine for fragrant blooms at the base of a 
fence or wall. 
</P>
<P>
Sow vegetables such as lettuce, radishes, corn and carrots in successive 
plantings to lengthen the harvest time. 
</P>
<P>
Rake up and dispose of old camellia blooms and leaves, to prevent the spread of 
petal blight. 
</P>
<P>
Watch for aphids that attack new rose growth.

PLANT OF THE WEEK: GARDENIA JASMINOIDES;

GARDENIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH SIMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Evergreen shrub with glossy, dark-green leaves and very fragrant white flowers 
</P>
<P>
Gardenias are not just pretty flowers; sensual and voluptuous, their aroma 
overwhelms and envelops. One plant can perfume a small garden, one bloom will 
drench a room with its sweet smell. 
</P>
<P>
They are quite easy to grow when conditions are right -- and conditions hardly 
ever are right in Southern California. Like azaleas, gardenias need acid soil 
and plenty of iron additives to keep their leaves from turning chlorotically 
yellow. Peat moss and iron chelate are commonly used to make gardenias more 
comfortable in our climate. 
</P>
<P>
Although gardenias need summer heat (but should be partially shaded in the 
hotter inland areas), they also require a deep mulch and sufficient water to 
keep their roots cool and moist at all times. The leaves and flowers need daily 
mistings, but they are very sensitive to salts contained in tap water. Given 
all the right care and attention, most varieties will start blooming in the 
spring and keep at it until late fall. 
</P>
<P>
But is it worth the trouble? All that expense? That depends; some people don't 
even like the smell of gardenias, perhaps basing that opinion on a whiff of a 
wretched old corsage flower, its petals turning brown. A freshly opened 
gardenia, still on the shrub, a creamy velvet beauty held over shiny green 
satin leaves, has an exhilarating fragrance, a scent that makes one long for 
the gift of poetry. 
</P>
<P>
Several varieties of gardenias are available, ranging from the 8-foot shrub, 
"Mystery" to the dainty "Radicans," a 6- to 12-inch ground cover. Depending on 
size, gardenias are useful as hedges, container plants, espaliers. Just be sure 
to plant them near the action, so to speak. Viewing them from a distance may be 
a pleasant sight, but it won't do a thing for one's nose.JUDITH SIMS

PAY ISSUE EXODUS?; 
</P>
<P>
WHY A JUDGE MAY LEAVE THE BENCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Something snapped inside Judge Jim R. Carrigan after Congress rejected a 50% 
pay raise for the judiciary and other top federal officeholders. 
</P>
<P>
During nearly 10 years on the federal bench, Carrigan, 59, a former trial 
lawyer who earned more than $300,000 annually at the peak of his career in 
private practice, had learned to accept the financial sacrifices of government 
service. 
</P>
<P>
He put six children through college and graduate school by gradually selling 
off almost all the investments he had made before his appointment to the bench 
in 1979. Learning to do without many of the luxuries he once enjoyed, he even 
traded in his Porsche for a Subaru. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enjoys Prestige 
</P>
<P>
Carrigan made these sacrifices gladly because he enjoyed the prestige and the 
intellectual challenge that comes from being a federal judge and because -- in 
the words of one of his former law partners -- he was "imbued with the desire 
for public service." 
</P>
<P>
But after the long-expected pay raise was rejected by Congress as part of its 
decision to deny itself a 50% raise on Feb. 7, Carrigan came to the conclusion 
that the intangible rewards of sitting on the federal bench were no longer 
enough to compensate for the prospect of going at least another four years 
without an increase in his $89,500-a-year salary. 
</P>
<P>
"I've decided I should leave the bench," Carrigan confided in an interview in 
his chambers in which he detailed his personal finances. "I owe it to my family 
to leave . . . . If our pay had gone to $135,000, I would have stayed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Ponder Resigning 
</P>
<P>
Carrigan, while more outspoken than most judges, is by no means the only person 
on the federal bench who is thought to be on the verge of resigning as a result 
of being denied a pay raise. In fact, the American Bar Assn. estimates that 
one-fourth of all the nation's more than 1,000 federal judges may be stepping 
down earlier than originally planned, causing an unprecedented mass exodus that 
could forever alter the character of the federal judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
"Failure to reverse the trend of resignations could cause the federal judiciary 
to be viewed as merely a stepping stone to higher paying jobs," warned U.S. 
District Judge Robert H. Hall, president of the Federal Judges Assn. 
</P>
<P>
No less a figure than Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, breaking his 
customary silence on issues of public policy, warned last Wednesday that the 
salary gap between judges and lawyers "poses the most serious threat to the 
future of the judiciary and its continued operations that I have observed 
during my lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, a federal judgeship was viewed as a lifetime occupation -- a 
juicy political plum that promised social status, independence and financial 
security all the way to the grave. 
</P>
<P>
Some financial watchdogs argue that the advantages of the federal bench remain 
so substantial that today's salary level is ample. David L. Keating, vice 
president of the National Taxpayers Union, which fought the congressional pay 
raise, says that judges should be willing to sacrifice to help trim the 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
More than that, Keating is not convinced that many judges are dissatisfied with 
their salaries. "Obviously, it's a job that many of the judges like doing, or 
more of them would be quitting," Keating said. "They are not leaving in 
droves." 
</P>
<P>
But as Carrigan's case suggests, an exodus may be beginning. At a time when 
most leading law firms offer first-year hires considerably more than $89,500, a 
federal judicial appointment is beginning to lose some of its luster. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Damage to Standards Feared 
</P>
<P>
And if judges start resigning in large numbers before their retirement, 
creating a so-called "revolving door" on the federal bench, legal experts fear 
it would jeopardize the historical independence and high ethical standards of 
the judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the pay raise was rejected, there were strong indications that the 
deteriorating salary levels -- combined with an enormous increase in the 
workload of the courts -- already were undermining the lifetime commitment of 
judicial appointees. 
</P>
<P>
Carrigan, like many of his colleagues, already was feeling disillusioned by 
what for him has become a 60- to 70-hour-a-week job with a big and complex 
workload, considerable stress and mind-numbing isolation from other people, 
including old friends who are lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody says thank you and all you get are complaints and death threats," he 
said. "If you don't have a sense of humor, you're dead." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the disappointment caused by Congress' surprise rejection of the 
50% pay raise has only succeeded in exacerbating a pervasive feeling of unrest 
that already was growing among judges serving on the federal bench. 
</P>
<P>
A number of federal judges interviewed by The Times, almost all of whom 
declined to be identified, admitted that their families were eager for the 50% 
raise and already had made plans for spending it when it was suddenly killed by 
Congress. Their initial shock quickly turned to anger, mostly directed at 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody gives a damn," complained Carrigan, one of the few judges who was 
willing to be quoted by name. "Congress has been jerking us around for years." 
</P>
<P>
For Carrigan, as for many other judges, the lost pay raise was as much a blow 
to his ego as it was to his pocketbook. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an insult aspect to this," he said. "It's a lack of appreciation. You 
are denigrated by being told that you are not worth more than a beginning 
lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Frank M. Coffin, who heads the Judicial Conference's 
committee on the judiciary, said that Carrigan's reaction to the defeated pay 
raise is typical of many judges. "They just feel demeaned, a tremendous sense 
of rejection," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Carrigan knows firsthand about the growing disparity between his salary and the 
pay earned by competent lawyers in private practice. He has watched a 
succession of young law clerks leave after putting in a year of service in the 
federal courthouse in Denver to earn as much as $103,000 in their first year. 
Moreover, he himself recently turned down a job offer of more than $250,000 as 
house counsel for a major corporation. 
</P>
<P>
According to statistics gathered by the Federal Judges Assn., experienced 
partners in law firms across the country now earn an average of $158,000 a year 
and the median rises to $250,000 for partners in larger firms. The average 
annual salary for partners with eight years' experience in Denver is $140,000. 
Even most college law professors and some state-level judges now earn 
considerably more than federal judges. 
</P>
<P>
Carrigan argues that Congress has violated "the spirit of the Constitution" by 
allowing judicial salaries to be seriously eroded by inflation over the last 
two decades. The Constitution prohibits the legislative branch from cutting the 
pay of judges. 
</P>
<P>
In recommending the 50% pay raise that was killed by Congress, both President 
Bush and former President Ronald Reagan noted that inflation has outstripped 
raises for judges and other top federal officeholders by 223% in 20 years. They 
placed the blame on Congress' failure to enact regular cost-of-living 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
The ABA's survey of judges shows that Carrigan is fairly representative of 
those federal jurists who have expressed the desire to shorten their tenure on 
the bench because of low pay and overwork. Like Carrigan, the bulk of them are 
in their late 50s or early 60s and have served between 5 and 12 years as 
judges. While these are believed to be the most productive judges in the 
system, they also have the best opportunities in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bemoans His Choice 
</P>
<P>
Carrigan, a gentle, good-humored man with a keen mind and a reputation for 
fairness in the courtroom, said he never would have sought a judgeship if he 
had known that he was not going to receive annual cost-of-living raises. "I 
would never become a judge today -- absolutely not," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While inflation has eroded his pay, he said, Congress over the last 10 years 
has heaped on additional deductions that have further reduced the take-home 
salaries of judges. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Carrigan noted, he and the others must now contribute to Social 
Security, even though federal judges are not eligible to receive benefits when 
they retire. In addition, judges, like others with relatively high incomes, no 
longer can make tax-free contributions to individual retirement accounts -- a 
change he takes personally, attributing it to "pure vindictiveness" on the part 
of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Carrigan, who opened his personal financial records to The Times in an effort 
to dramatize the financial plight of federal judges, noted that while his 
government salary exceeded $87,000 in 1987, he took home less than $45,000 
after deductions. The deductions that year were $20,077.36 in federal taxes, 
$3,603.20 for state taxes, $3,131.70 for Social Security, $4,544.04 for health 
insurance, $5,869.92 for term life insurance and $4,475.04 for an annuity that 
would provide his wife with 25% of his salary after his death. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opts for Cheaper Insurance 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, when his gross pay rose to $89,500, Carrigan canceled his life 
insurance and opted for a cheaper health insurance plan. 
</P>
<P>
He also has been economizing by canceling memberships in such organizations as 
the Rotary, the American Law Institute, the American Bar Assn. Fellows and 
other such groups he had joined for social as well as intellectual stimulation. 
Just last month, in fact, he dropped out of a prestigious discussion group 
known as the Colorado Executive Forum, that cost him $800 every six months -- a 
luxury he decided he could no longer afford. 
</P>
<P>
In private practice, he noted, such fees are paid by law firms. 
</P>
<P>
Carrigan said he was forced to limit his paycheck deductions because most of 
his investments -- some stocks and about $150,000 in municipal bonds -- already 
have been liquidated to pay college tuition for his six children, the youngest 
of whom is a junior at the University of Notre Dame. He also sold off a 
half-interest in the family's Rocky Mountain retreat to raise money for tuition 
and he recently refinanced his home in nearby Boulder -- only months before the 
original mortgage would have been paid off -- to make renovations that his wife 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the only substantial personal fund that Carrigan has not drained 
during his years on the federal bench is his profit-sharing accrued while he 
was in private practice before he was appointed to the bench. "If I spend 
that," he remarked, "I'll have nothing left." 
</P>
<P>
Although Carrigan acknowledges that his salary would be the envy of many 
Americans -- even after all the deductions -- he believes that without a big 
pay increase the only lawyers who agree to serve as judges in the future will 
be those who are independently wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
"While it's a very great honor to serve on this court, it's an honor that the 
founding fathers didn't think you ought to have to purchase," Carrigan said. 
"In a sense, every competent lawyer who serves is paying to be a federal 
judge." 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth N. Kripke, a Denver attorney and one of Carrigan's former law partners, 
predicts that his old friend will be able to command whatever salary he wants 
if he decides to leave the bench and return to private practice. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim is a very, very talented person -- nothing short of a genius," Kripke 
said. "There would be many, many law firms that would want him -- probably at 
his own price." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Teaching vs. Law Firm 
</P>
<P>
As for Carrigan, he appears to be torn between two possible alternatives -- 
teaching at a law school or opening a law firm with his son and son-in-law. 
Although he enjoys the stimulation of teaching, he adds: "I'd love to leave 
behind a law firm to my children." 
</P>
<P>
He said that he has been contacted by one law school and two national law firms 
interested in hiring him after he resigns. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he has even toyed with the idea of seeking the Democratic 
nomination to replace Sen. William L. Armstrong (R-Colo.), who recently 
announced plans to step down at the end of his current term next year. 
</P>
<P>
While money plays a big role in Carrigan's decision-making, he indicated that 
after a decade on the bench he is also longing for more rewarding work than his 
current job provides and the kind of close contact with people that he got as a 
trial lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a standoffish job," he observed. "I miss the people contact, the sense 
that you are helping people at a time of crisis. People knock lawyers, but when 
they get into trouble, they don't call bureaucrats. It's deeply satisfying." 
</P>
<P>
The isolation required of judges was particularly troubling for Carrigan not 
long ago when one of his former law partners suffered a heart attack. Carrigan 
could not go to visit his old friend in the hospital because he was also 
sitting in judgment of a case involving the ailing man. Ever since, he said, 
"I've felt guilty." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Carrigan is so overwhelmed by his current workload -- a heavy docket 
of routine trials such as drug cases combined with a number of highly complex 
legal matters, including a $5-billion hazardous waste cleanup case that is 
scheduled to go to trial soon -- that he fears he is no longer doing the kind 
of legal work of which he can be proud. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of frustration in having so much to do that you can't do it with 
excellence," he said. "It's impossible to do more than a fair job. It's hard 
for me to be the one person in the courtroom who knows the least about a case. 
I don't think this job was intended to be done in haste." 
</P>
<P>
Carrigan's wife, Beverly, also thinks that he would be happier if he resigned 
from the bench. "I think my husband is a very good judge," she said, "but the 
way he is talking about the job, there isn't much satisfaction anymore . . . . 
I hate to have him work so hard at age 60. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small Things Mean a Lot 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Carrigan said she feels some bitterness -- even a little petty, 
sometimes -- when she and her husband go out with old friends who enjoy the big 
incomes of lawyers in private practice. The feeling overwhelms her most when 
one of her friends shows up in a new fur coat or when -- as usually happens -- 
their friends offer to pick up the check at a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Although Mrs. Carrigan occasionally has considered going back to social work, 
which she did before she was married, she noted that it is a low-paying 
occupation that would do little to supplement their income. Furthermore, she 
said: "I'm a bride of the '50s and I like the traditional things -- taking care 
of the house, the kids." 
</P>
<P>
As Carrigan contemplates leaving the bench, nevertheless, he is torn by doubts 
-- a fear that his resignation would add to the workload of his colleagues on 
the court as well as a sense that as a judge he is doing some good for his 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like the idea of leaving," he said. "It's not all money. It's a sense 
of public service too. You have a sense of justice. You hate to just walk away 
after you've committed so much of your life to the justice system."

OFFICIALS DEFEND 5% SAMPLING TO DETECT POISON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Federal officials on Friday strongly defended the method they have chosen to 
ensure that fruit imported from Chile is safe, saying that a random sampling of 
5% of the grapes and berries should be enough to detect any poison. 
</P>
<P>
But many of the details of the inspection system must still be worked out and 
the fact remains that, even when the system finally is in place, 95% of the 
fruit will not be looked at by inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, with grapes as with other food items, consumers will have to take 
some responsibility for ensuring the safety of what they eat. Consumers should 
watch out for "injection marks, unusual appearance, discoloration or chemical 
or almond-like smells" that would indicate the presence of cyanide, Food and 
Drug Administration Commissioner Frank E. Young said at a press conference 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been amazed how little time we spend looking at what we consume," Young 
said. "Regretfully, we have been living possibly under the thought that 
everything is safe and wholesome without taking precautions." That, he made 
clear, is no longer possible. 
</P>
<P>
FDA tests performed over the last two weeks -- since threats of poisoning were 
first raised -- indicate that if cyanide is present in grapes, berries or other 
small acidic fruits, some signs should be apparent. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the best things to look at in berries is for soft, overly ripe, mushy 
berries," Young said. "I think most of us are in the habit of discarding 
those." 
</P>
<P>
But because the FDA does not yet know how cyanide would affect larger, less 
acidic fruits such as peaches and nectarines, those fruits will be kept out of 
the distribution system until further laboratory tests can be completed. 
</P>
<P>
Such fruits are larger and presumably could hold more cyanide. In addition, 
because tree fruits are less acidic than grapes and berries, FDA scientists 
expect that cyanide in them would maintain its potency longer. In the presence 
of acids, sodium cyanide, the solid form of the poison, breaks down to form a 
gas, hydrogen cyanide, that would evaporate from the fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly how the new inspection system is to work remained unclear Friday as FDA 
officials, who had met with industry leaders until 2 a.m. Friday, continued a 
series of discussions over details. In general, however, the system is expected 
to work this way: 
</P>
<P>
All fruit that has left Chile, whether it is currently on the high seas or 
aboard ships in ports or in customs warehouses, will be inspected on the docks 
in the United States. Inspectors will look at 5% of the crates on every 
shipment, or at least 15,000 crates per ship. If they see any 
suspicious-looking fruit in those crates, that fruit will be taken to a 
laboratory for analysis. In the meantime, the fruit will be impounded. 
</P>
<P>
Fruit still in Chile will be inspected there, also at a rate of 5% per 
shipment, with a minimum of 15,000 crates per ship. FDA personnel will be sent 
to Chile to examine the inspection system. Once the FDA is convinced that the 
Chilean system is working properly, the intensive inspections in the United 
States will cease. The FDA does not yet know how long that will take. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Maximum Level 
</P>
<P>
The 5% inspection level, Young said, is "the maximum feasible" given the 
resources available and the amount of time needed to unload fruit from a ship 
before it begins to spoil. But it also is a considerably higher rate of 
sampling, he noted, than most other consumer products get. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States," he said, "has had a substantial sampling experience," and 
FDA officials believe that 5% will be sufficient to detect any tampering with 
fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Who will do the inspections remained somewhat unclear Friday. Agriculture 
Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter said that his agency will assist the FDA and 
provide 100 to 200 inspectors. But the department has not yet determined "how 
we can assist them and when and where they want us to do this," USDA spokesman 
Bob Melland said. 
</P>
<P>
According to industry officials, the vast majority of the inspectors will be 
employees of the companies that import Chilean fruit and will be paid by them, 
not the taxpayer. The FDA will audit the work of those inspectors to ensure 
that they are doing the job properly. 
</P>
<P>
Similar cooperative inspection programs are routinely used to screen medical 
devices, drugs and other food items for safety, but their effectiveness often 
has been questioned. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, the FDA hopes to begin training the new inspectors. Once the work 
force is trained, the new, intensive inspections will begin and Chilean produce 
will start reappearing on grocers' shelves. That process could take as long as 
five to nine days, Young said.

MANAGUA FREES 1,894 SOMOZA GUARD VETERANS

<P>
Nearly 10 years after their army collapsed in defeat in the Sandinista 
revolution, 1,645 former national guardsmen walked out of a prison Friday in a 
mass pardon aimed at ending the U.S.-backed rebellion against Sandinista rule. 
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony resembling a high school commencement, the prisoners stood in 
formation on a hot, wind-swept basketball court at the Modelo Prison as their 
names were called. One by one, they stepped forward to collect certificates 
attesting to their freedom with full rights of citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Then, while loudspeakers blared recorded folk music, ropes separating the 
guardsmen from their families dropped, setting off a scramble of tearful 
reunions. Some of those freed dropped to their knees in prayer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Shout With Joy' 
</P>
<P>
"Finally, this nightmare is over," said Hazel Maraz Soto, 26, one of the 
youngest prisoners, embracing his mother. She exclaimed, "I want to shout with 
joy that my son has returned!" 
</P>
<P>
Counting 249 prisoners under house arrest or home on furlough, the pardons 
covered 1,894 people imprisoned for service in the army of the Somoza family 
that ruled Nicaragua for 43 years until the Sandinista takeover of July, 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-nine guardsmen remained behind bars, judged by the Sandinistas to be 
guilty of serious war crimes or defiant prison behavior. The pardon did not 
touch any of the 1,400 or more jailed Contra suspects, whose freedom has been 
promised when the Contras lay down their weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The prisoner release, the largest in Nicaragua in two wars spanning more than a 
decade, was the first step taken to comply with President Daniel Ortega's 
commitment under a month-old Central American peace accord, which also promises 
elections in Nicaragua by next Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
In return, the region's four other presidents agreed to help draft by mid-May a 
plan for closing the Contra military camps in Honduras, a step that would 
further cripple the idled rebel army. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega has said the Bush Administration is "acting against" the regional accord 
by saying it will seek as much as $50 million in non-military aid from Congress 
to hold the rebels together in Honduras for one more year as a potential threat 
to force Sandinistas to live up to the accord. 
</P>
<P>
To demonstrate his compliance, Ortega brought the secretary general of the 
Organization of American States, Joao Baena Soares, and foreign diplomats to 
the prison ceremony 14 miles east of Managua. 
</P>
<P>
In a later gathering in the capital, Ortega told diplomats and opposition party 
leaders that he will soon send the National Assembly a series of proposed 
changes in the electoral law and the law governing the news media, with the aim 
of assuring open and fair elections. 
</P>
<P>
He said the changes will be based on suggestions offered by 14 opposition 
parties in talks with him in recent weeks, but he gave no details. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the prisoner release "a transcendental act" that shows "the generosity 
of the revolution," Ortega appealed to Washington to limit any new Contra aid 
to the advancement of the regional peace pact -- the rebels' disarmament and 
repatriation to Nicaragua or relocation in third countries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rescheduled Date 
</P>
<P>
The prisoner release had been scheduled for Sunday but was moved forward on two 
days' notice when Sandinista officials realized that international attention 
would be distracted by Sunday's elections in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders and some former guardsmen said the government seemed more 
concerned about the public relations impact outside Nicaragua than the needs of 
those freed to feel accepted as useful members of society. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, debate over the pardons did little to heal the wounds of the Sandinista 
uprising that left an estimated 10,000 people dead in 1978 and 1979. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trepidation Voiced 
</P>
<P>
One guardsman on the pardon list, Ramon Valle Arancibia, was the object of a 
last-ditch citizens' campaign to keep him locked up. A mothers group accused 
the ailing, 59-year-old prisoner of having taking part in a June, 1979, 
massacre in a Managua neighborhood and driving the police bulldozer that 
scooped the bodies into a mass grave. 
</P>
<P>
"If I see that man on the street, I'll stone him, I assure you," declared 
Angela Hernandez de Lorio, 55, whose son died in the incident. Valle was freed 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
As they left prison Friday, most guardsmen claimed to be victims of unjust 
prosecution for guilt by association. Some expressed varying degrees of 
trepidation over returning to a society still tightly ruled by the one-time 
guerrillas who defeated them. 
</P>
<P>
Less than an hour after his release, Gustavo Mendoza, 32, looked nervously over 
his shoulder and said he was afraid that Sandinista agents were following him. 
"There is no security for us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A more typical outlook was expressed by Rodolfo Salmeron, 28, a former National 
Guard officer from the mining town of Siuna, who said he was glad to be alive. 
</P>
<P>
"This is historic," he said. "I think it's hard to find this kind of pardon in 
other countries. I never thought I would get out because first they told us 
that all the guards were going to die. But God never abandoned us, and now 
we're free. Since I never did nothing to anybody, I don't feel the slightest 
fear of going home." 
</P>
<P>
In random interviews with 20 freed guardsmen, eight said they might leave 
Nicaragua because they feel uncomfortable under Sandinista rule or want better 
job opportunities. All but one said they were interested in moving to the 
United States. The U.S. Embassy said there is no special consideration for 
freed guardsmen in its strict immigration rules, although many guardsmen who 
escaped before the Sandinista take-over or were freed later now live in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
The latest batch of guardsmen is being thrown onto a shrinking job market amid 
a severe economic crisis and sharp cutbacks in public spending. Many said they 
were worried more about finding work than about avoiding reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
"I think about leaving, but if they give me a chance to work, I would rather 
stay," said Juan de Dios Herrera, 33, who was trained in prison as a carpenter. 
"I would feel much better with a place in the new society." 
</P>
<P>
The newly freed prisoners will have several sources of assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Arevalo, an official at the Modelo Prison, said 220 of them will continue 
working there, as they did as prisoners, in such jobs as making boots for the 
Sandinista army, repairing government vehicles and building public housing. 
</P>
<P>
The International Red Cross gave every freed prisoner a modest wardrobe to go 
home in -- the first civilian clothes many had worn in a decade. It also 
arranged their bus transport home, temporary lodging for about 40 guardsmen 
with no known relatives in Nicaragua and food deliveries for four months. 
</P>
<P>
The Church of God, a Pentecostal sect active inside the prison, will offer 
former guardsmen job placement in rural cooperatives, according to the Rev. 
Pedro Pablo Castillo, a former National Guard lieutenant colonel who left the 
jail in a 1985 pardon. Seven inmates who left Friday will work for the church 
as pastors, he said.

U.S. FREES CHILE GRAPES, BERRIES; 
</P>
<P>
BUT OTHER FRUIT HELD BY MARKETS, DISTRIBUTORS MUST BE DESTROYED

<P>
The Bush Administration on Friday lifted its five-day ban on Chilean grapes and 
berries, announcing that it would release the huge, impounded stockpiles at 
U.S. ports after enhanced inspections but that most Chilean produce now held by 
markets and distributors must be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Frank E. Young, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said that a 
new system of increased inspections, coupled with stepped-up security measures 
in Chile, will ensure the "maximal layer of safety" of fruit from the South 
American nation, while stemming further economic losses to the Chilean and U.S. 
economies. 
</P>
<P>
However, he warned, "it is impossible to ensure 100% safety." He urged grocers 
and consumers to carefully examine grapes and berries for possible 
contamination and to discard fruit that is bruised, overly ripe or shows signs 
of suspicious damage. 
</P>
<P>
He estimated that Chilean fruit -- which makes up much of the fruit sold in the 
United States in winter months -- would be back on store shelves within five to 
nine days. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Threat 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials, who have been under intense pressure to end the crisis, 
announced the plan despite word that another telephone threat was received 
Friday in Santiago, warning that additional fruit exports will be poisoned. 
</P>
<P>
The fruit ban originally was ordered after two earlier telephone threats and 
the discovery of cyanide-tainted grapes in a Chilean cargo unloaded in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Young said he was advised of the new threat by the State Department about 
midday Friday, and he briefly considered postponing the announcement on ending 
the ban. But, he said, "every time a call comes in, do you stop everything 
that's going on?" 
</P>
<P>
The FDA chief said he is confident the timing of the latest call could have no 
bearing on the fruit already here. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything now will be at the new testing level, and all boats leaving from 
Chile will be subject to the new testing level," coupled with "increased 
security measures and increased inspection measures in Chile," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Young discussed the plan in a briefing after President Bush told reporters that 
the embargo had been justified, although "it has caused some economic hardship 
that I regret." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crucial Part 
</P>
<P>
The ban announced Monday emptied store shelves nationwide of all 
Chilean-produced fruit, which is a crucial part of Chile's export economy. 
Sixty-five percent of that nation's fruit crop is shipped to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Washington from 
Colorado, added: "I think when the health of the American people might be 
threatened, you've got to take prudent action." 
</P>
<P>
Chilean Foreign Minister Hernan Felipe Errazuriz, at the White House for a 
meeting with Vice President Dan Quayle, called the U.S. decision "a workable 
solution," adding: "It takes into account the interest of the U.S. citizens and 
the Chileans." 
</P>
<P>
The new system will allow the release of the bulk of the Chilean fruit now 
being held at U.S. ports. The largest component is 918,000 cases of grapes, one 
of the fruits that can be cleared after inspection. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Larger Fruits 
</P>
<P>
FDA officials said they have not decided what to do about the tons of 
larger-sized Chilean fruits that have been impounded, such as nectarines, 
peaches, apples and melons. These were not included in the new procedures 
because -- unlike small berries -- they are capable of holding much larger 
amounts of poison and if contaminated, are much more likely to cause injury or 
death. 
</P>
<P>
"These fruits have a lot longer shelf life and we want to do some more 
laboratory experiments," Young said. "We chose to do this (release the fruit), 
bit by bit." 
</P>
<P>
He said that he could not say when the larger fruits will be back on the 
market. "I would not be able to predict," he said. "I would not want to 
speculate." 
</P>
<P>
As for the fruit that left U.S. ports and is being held by grocery stores, 
distributors and other facilities, officials said that destruction probably 
would be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA said it would be the responsibility of the states to monitor the 
destruction, but indicated that the federal government may create some 
mechanism to salvage some of the produce if it can be returned for inspection. 
</P>
<P>
Officials also confirmed that the fruit, although banned from sale in the 
United States, could be shipped legally to other countries where no such 
restrictions apply. 
</P>
<P>
John McClung, a spokesman for the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Assn., 
called it "disheartening that hundreds of millions of dollars of fruit" might 
have to be destroyed, but that the members of his organization recognize that 
such action is important to restore "consumer confidence." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "It is very unclear how much product is out there between the docks 
and the retailers, in cold storage facilities and in the pipeline in between. 
We just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Considerable Confusion 
</P>
<P>
Despite the federal announcement, there was considerable confusion among all of 
the parties involved -- including the FDA -- about precisely how the new 
inspection system will work. Young himself was unable Friday to spell out the 
technical details. 
</P>
<P>
He said that inspected boxes will be stamped in some way to indicate to 
retailers and others that the products have been cleared. 
</P>
<P>
The inspection system will apply to shipments on all boats that are already 
here or en route, but not necessarily to future shipments, "unless there is a 
problem," according to FDA spokesman William Grigg. "If things go well, we can 
phase down as the Chileans convince us that what they are doing is effective," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Young said, however, that "no program can assure 100% safety unless you look at 
each and every item," which is impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he emphasized that grocers and especially consumers should be 
especially vigilant in examining their own fruit. "Cyanide promotes rapid 
spoilage," he said. "Most of us have a habit of discarding mushy berries. That 
should be done. Or you can see the site of an injection. I would urge consumers 
to look at their products carefully." 
</P>
<P>
McClung said there is considerable uncertainty within the industry about how 
liability will be resolved for the fruit that must be destroyed. Virtually all 
the parties involved have suffered severe financial hardship because of the 
ban. 
</P>
<P>
Further damage still could be done to the Chilean economy if no method of 
clearing the larger fruits is resolved soon. The peak of the grape season there 
has now passed, according to Bryan Silbermann, a spokesman for the Produce 
Marketing Assn., and over the next few weeks Chilean farmers will be harvesting 
more peaches, plums, nectarines and other tree fruits. 
</P>
<P>
Young said that U.S. health officials must make safety their paramount concern. 
</P>
<P>
"The day I start to look at health with regard to somebody's left hip pocket or 
pocketbook, then I am not focusing enough in regard to safety," he said. "I've 
got to look at safety. I can't allow economics or politics to interfere." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, investigators reported no progress in determining who poisoned the 
grapes found in the shipment last weekend. Two red seedless grapes containing 
puncture marks and minute traces of cyanide were found in a crate unloaded in 
Philadelphia from the Almeria Star. 
</P>
<P>
Young said that State Department officials told him they believed "by voice 
analysis" that the newest telephone threat received in Santiago was from 
"possibly the same person" who telephoned the embassy twice in recent weeks 
warning of produce poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
However, State Department spokesman Nancy Beck said: "We do not know whether or 
not it was from the same person who called before." 
</P>
<P>
She said the call was received at the U.S. Embassy at 9:30 a.m. Santiago time 
and threatened "Chilean fruit exports." She said the department has provided 
"all the details" to the Chilean authorities and "will continue to provide our 
fullest cooperation to their investigation of this matter."

For nearly a decade, Atter Bibi and her family refused to give in to the war 
that has driven 5 million of her countrymen from their homeland. But this week, 
the killing finally caught up with her. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old Afghan was at her uncle's wedding party in a mud hut near the 
strategic eastern city of Jalalabad four days ago when the bombing started. It 
was part of an offensive by the moujahedeen, the Afghan rebels, that has 
touched off the bloodiest fighting since the Afghan war began in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours, Atter Bibi had become part of the newest wave of refugees, adding 
to what already is the world's largest refugee population -- and at the worst 
possible time for Pakistan and the relief community to accommodate them. 
</P>
<P>
A cluster bomb scored a direct hit on the wedding party. It killed Atter's 
sister-in-law, her mother-in-law and several cousins. It sent shrapnel ripping 
through Atter's body, tearing off her right thumb, blowing a hole in her 
stomach and filling her legs with metal shards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wrapped in Gauze 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, it is all so much worse now," Atter said in a thin voice just above a 
whisper, as she lay wrapped in post-surgical gauze at a special hospital for 
war-wounded women in this Pakistani border city. "There is no one left in the 
village now. They are all either here in Pakistan or dead." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Atter is among the more than 17,000 lucky ones. They are the Afghans who 
have survived the past 11 days of rocket and artillery barrages, aerial 
bombing, mortar fire, missiles, mines, tank attacks and small-arms fire as the 
moujahedeen battle government forces to a stalemate in their controversial 
efforts to capture Jalalabad, just 30 miles from the Pakistan border. They are 
the ones who made it across that border as part of the new refugee flood. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows the number of dead and wounded in what military analysts are 
calling the decisive battle in the prolonged guerrilla war, but most reliable 
sources estimate that the total on each side may be as high as 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet-backed government of Afghan President Najibullah says that it has 
killed 2,000 of the moujahedeen guerrillas and their civilian supporters since 
the rebel offensive began. Rebel commanders concede that their death toll has 
topped 500. They claim to have killed twice that number, but Najibullah has not 
issued public figures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bloodshed, Little Gain 
</P>
<P>
For all the bloodshed, though, the rebels have gained little. A week ago, they 
captured the town of Samarkhel, which defense analysts have called "the 
linchpin to the security of Jalalabad." 
</P>
<P>
Samarkhel and its garrison fell quickly, with the government troops fleeing so 
fast that they left behind half-eaten meals, identification cards, love 
letters, pornographic playing cards, wedding rings, huge stores of ammunition, 
dozens of heavy artillery pieces and 40 Soviet tanks 
</P>
<P>
But since then, the rebel offensive has stalled. It has become a stalemate of 
long-range missiles, rockets and artillery duels, in which houses, 
neighborhoods and entire villages are being flattened and thousands of 
civilians maimed. 
</P>
<P>
The moujahedeen's supporters, among them the governments of the United States 
and Pakistan, have defended the rebels' strategy of mounting an all-out 
military offensive against Jalalabad, a steppingstone to the capital of Kabul 
and a possible site for the rebels' interim government. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources say Pakistan's military intelligence agency pushed the 
battle plan on the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted a big dramatic victory, thinking that it would have a major 
psychological impact, both on the regime and on the guerrilla forces," one 
Western diplomat said of that advice. "After the Feb. 15 Soviet troop pullout, 
the rebels achieved no major action or accomplishments, and that benefited the 
regime in Kabul. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a general realization that it's time to fish or cut bait. The regime 
in Kabul is not going to just fade away. . . . It (was) going to be a fight, 
and it (was) time the fighting started." 
</P>
<P>
Western military analysts added that the timing was critical. The rebels were 
anxious to take a major city before this week's meeting of the 46-member 
Organization of the Islamic Conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in hopes of 
impressing those governments into officially recognizing the interim 
government. The rebels have not taken a major city or town in their long 
guerrilla war. 
</P>
<P>
But that meeting has ended and the moujahedeen came away with half a victory. 
The Islamic group invited representatives of the rebels to fill Afghanistan's 
vacant seat but did not specifically recognize the interim government. 
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, which has taken in more than 3 million Afghan refugees since the war 
began, now faces the largest wave of such refugees since the early 1980s -- and 
at a time when the international relief community has been shifting its 
resources away from the refugees to development projects in Afghanistan in 
preparation for the refugees' return. 
</P>
<P>
Pakistani officials said this week that as of Thursday, 17,202 new refugees had 
arrived in the last seven days, most of them having made their way on foot, 
dodging bombs and rockets. (On Friday, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees 
in Geneva put the figure of refugees officially registered at the main frontier 
crossing point since the beginning of March at 11,661. A spokeswoman said a 
smaller number had crossed the border at other points.) 
</P>
<P>
Some fled the Jalalabad area with nothing but the clothes on their backs. A man 
who said he was headmaster of a school shook his head as he recalled seeing his 
sister blown to pieces by a rocket near the Jalalabad airport. 
</P>
<P>
"How can anything be worth this?" he muttered. "All that will be won when it's 
over is a pile of rubble." 
</P>
<P>
Abu Basir, a street vendor from Jalalabad, stepped on one of the millions of 
land mines now littering the Afghan countryside as he tried to lead his wife, 
sister and four children to refuge in Pakistan. He was dead on arrival at a 
Peshawar hospital, and his family squatted in a corner of the hospital, dazed 
and weeping. 
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government officially says all new refugees are still welcome 
here and that there is room for 100,000 more. But privately, officials concede 
that there is insufficient water and food. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Women in Line for Water 
</P>
<P>
At the old Nasir Bagh refugee camp near Peshawar, where a sprawling new tent 
city is rising, the camp's head policeman said Pakistan cannot handle the new 
wave of refugees. He pointed to a line of more than 100 Afghan women balancing 
pots on their heads, waiting to collect water from one of the camp's two water 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see the problem with water," he said. "This can only get worse. My 
personal opinion is none of these refugees will leave here for two years at 
least. And we will continue to get more and more. The world thought the war 
ended when the Soviets left. We're beginning to think it has only just begun." 
</P>
<P>
That's also how it looks to Alif Khan, 46. The white-bearded farmer was 
pitching his new tent as he explained how he had become a refugee after nine 
years of war. 
</P>
<P>
"A bomb fell on my house," he said, adding that his entire village of Dara 
Noor, adjacent to Jalalabad, has been leveled. "It was destroyed. So my wife 
and seven children finally decided to walk to Pakistan." 
</P>
<P>
Khan, like most of the refugees, cannot go home for months, even if the 
fighting stops. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a farmer. This is planting season, and I cannot plant. There will be no 
food, so how will we eat if we go back? We will stay here, maybe a year." 
</P>
<P>
None of the refugees blamed the moujahedeen for their homelessness. Most said 
they are rebel supporters who clandestinely helped the rebels inside 
Afghanistan while pretending to back Najibullah. 
</P>
<P>
"In that sense, it is another setback to the moujahedeen," said veteran 
American aid worker Anne Hurd, head of the Mercy Fund, a Peshawar-based 
international aid agency that has been funneling food and supplies into 
Afghanistan in an effort to keep would-be refugees from crossing the border. 
"From the resistance's point of view, you are drying up the pond in which the 
guerrillas swim. And that's bad. But, from a humanitarian point of view, there 
is simply nowhere here for these new refugees to go. And that's a bigger 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
Shah Zaman, director of public relations for Pakistan's refugee commission, 
said: "It is really a tragic thing that is going on. And the irony is, I fear 
there will not be a decisive victory. Both sides are now very committed." 
</P>
<P>
For 9-year-old Abu Sufian, there are no answers -- easy or otherwise. He said 
his house on the outskirts of Jalalabad had been bombed three days earlier, and 
he has shrapnel wounds in his head and hands. Everyone in his family of nine 
was injured in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Did he know who bombed his house? 
</P>
<P>
"The government, the Russians," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Did he know why? 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the fighting between the moujahedeen and the government." 
</P>
<P>
But why had his house been hit? 
</P>
<P>
Abu Sufian looked down at his bandaged hands, then he looked up and shook his 
bandaged head. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," he said. "Does anybody know?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CITY UNDER FIRE 
</P>
<P>
The Afghan city of Jalalabad has been the scene of intense fighting between 
government troops and moujahedeen rebels for the last 11 days. The fighting has 
driven at least 17,000 refugees over the border into Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
The garrison town of Samarkhel, which defense analysts call the "linchpin to 
the security of Jalalabad," was captured by the rebels last week.

<TEXT>
<P>
Here, not long ago, one blanket cost eight lives. 
</P>
<P>
A nighttime riot had convulsed the vast collection of mud huts and 
wood-and-plastic shacks erected by 200,000 refugees from civil war in the 
south. As relief workers who found the victims pieced the stories together the 
next day, the violence began when the Sudanese Red Crescent sent youths to give 
out blankets to refugees from the Dinka and Nuer tribes. 
</P>
<P>
"When the boys distributing the blankets realized they had too few, they just 
threw them into the crowd, and whoever caught one, kept it," a relief worker 
explained later. "One was caught by both a Dinka and a Nuer." 
</P>
<P>
What started as a tug of war escalated that night into a refugee camp version 
of tribal warfare, exacerbated by longstanding Dinka-Nuer grievances. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Falling Value of Life 
</P>
<P>
The eight deaths at this camp south of the capital of Khartoum underscores the 
falling value of human life in Sudan, where disintegration of conditions in the 
countryside has come home to the city. 
</P>
<P>
But eventually the dispute at Hillat Shook cost more: It became so difficult to 
keep peace here that local relief agencies had to shut several health clinics 
and cancel health training sessions. 
</P>
<P>
To many, the collapse of order in the camp is hardly remarkable, given the 
harsh conditions and the state in which people arrive, generally after cramped, 
dusty train or truck rides that take several days. Here, they are strangers in 
their own land, divorced from the village or tribal life that customarily lent 
order to their daily routines. 
</P>
<P>
"The people here are used to a tribal structure at home, and here it's gone," 
says Mohammed Ibrahim Osman, head of emergency services for the Sudanese Red 
Crescent, the local arm of the International Red Cross. "That creates tension 
between different tribes that at home was solved by the chiefs." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the estimated 20,000 children now roaming the capital's rubbled 
streets, cadging cigarettes and panhandling, come from the camps that form a 
great ring around the triple cities of Khartoum, Khartoum North and Omdurman, 
at the confluence of the Blue Nile and White Nile. Tribal chiefs who moved 
north with their own villagers complain that they can no longer keep order 
among their people. 
</P>
<P>
"The people acquire new ways of life," Osman said. "We notice that when the 
displaced persons first came to be served, they were very organized. Someone 
from the group would help. After a few weeks the people are a mob, restless -- 
they don't listen. People are not confident that if they wait they will be 
served. The chiefs say that's the effect of people coming into Khartoum." 
</P>
<P>
The refugees have placed an additional burden on local commodities and 
government services in the cities, increasing the discontent felt over the 
government's costly military, economic and religious policies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very clear that this is putting a lot of pressure on the deteriorating 
water and food of Khartoum," Osman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Symbols of Nation's Woes 
</P>
<P>
About 2 million refugees from within Sudan have reached these camps, staggering 
symbols of the nation's myriad plagues. Although most are fleeing the vicious 
civil war that has been waged in the south for five years, the other three 
corners of Sudan are also represented -- by those escaping tribal war in the 
west, famine and floods in the north and an influx of Ethiopian refugees that 
have strained resources in the east. 
</P>
<P>
Once here, they face another of Sudan's plagues: hostility from the government 
of Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi, which adheres to Islamic law. 
</P>
<P>
"The government's been very resistant," says Priscilla Joseph, a Dinka 
physician who is chief of medical services for the Sudan Council of Churches. 
"They say these are illegal residential areas and they won't extend services to 
them. In nothing does the government feel concern." 
</P>
<P>
Periodically, the government moves in and burns one of the camps to the ground, 
often after a fight or after someone has been found brewing date wine or 
merisa, another alcoholic beverage. Under Islamic law, alcohol is forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
But the most important result of this official hostility is a severe scarcity 
of water. The government charge of illegal residency prohibits the boring of 
wells that could make fresh water easily available to all residents. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the refugees are at the mercy of middlemen, who ply the camps in donkey 
carts fitted with 10-gallon water cans and make several trips a day between the 
camps and the nearest government water well. A family here might pay more than 
$10 a month for pure water -- while homeowners in Khartoum's toniest districts 
pay $4. 
</P>
<P>
"Some families can afford to pay the middlemen, but not enough of them for a 
general hygienic improvement," Joseph said. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, health in the camps is appreciably worse than in neighboring 
cities. About 23% of the children are malnourished, according to a survey by 
the Council of Churches, and disease rates are roughly twice that of the urban 
population. 
</P>
<P>
Measles and diarrhea kill hundreds of children a year, because even families 
who can afford fresh water carry the water in contaminated containers. 
</P>
<P>
The government position also left the camps adrift during disastrous floods 
that struck the Khartoum region last August. Remains of thousands of mud huts 
that dissolved in the wash can still be seen in the dusty landscape. 
</P>
<P>
"The government has nothing for us here," says Samiya Hassan, whose house and 
meager belongings were washed away in the flood and who now lives in a 
plastic-covered shed in Umm Baddah, a camp north of Omdurman. 
</P>
<P>
But the government's hand has not been invisible. Over the last few weeks, 
refugees and relief officials say, the government has been intensively pressing 
displaced men into teams to help with the spring harvest of sorghum, perhaps 
Sudan's most important grain crop. 
</P>
<P>
"This year we've heard that 15,000 men have been taken," one relief official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The forced recruitment means a further trauma for many of these families, about 
30% of which arrive without any men in the first place. "The ones that are left 
lose their men as protection," Joseph said. 
</P>
<P>
Once the men are taken away, families and officials have no way of learning 
whether they are being well treated, fed or paid their promised wage of up to 
$3.30 a day. 
</P>
<P>
The record is not encouraging. In 1986, Joseph recalled, 150 men were taken 
from one camp to an agricultural area in the central region -- and never 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
"We only heard stories about them," she said. "That they weren't paid, they 
were given rotten food, and died."

CAR BOMB EXPLODES NEAR BEIRUT BAKERY; 12 SHOPPERS DIE, 75 HURT 
</P>

<P>
Glass and shrapnel from an exploding car bomb Friday raked a crowded bakery in 
suburban Beirut. Lebanese police reported 12 shoppers were killed and at least 
75 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
The toll was the highest this year for a Beirut car bomb. Thirteen people have 
been killed in four previous explosions. 
</P>
<P>
None of Lebanon's militant factions claimed responsibility for the bombing, 
which occurred during the morning rush hour in Jal el Deeb, a suburb of 
Christian-controlled East Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
The blast shattered the relative calm of a 10-hour-old truce in the running 
artillery duels between Muslim and Christian gunners. It destroyed the bakery, 
damaged adjoining shops and set 20 cars afire in the street. Windows in the 
consulate building of the British Embassy, just 50 yards distant, were broken 
by the force of the bomb, which police estimated at more than 100 pounds of 
explosives. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the casualties, some grotesquely maimed, were children who had joined 
their parents to line up for bread during the break in the artillery shelling, 
according to reports from Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
Salim Hoss, head of the Muslim caretaker government in West Beirut, called the 
bombing a mass murder. "Civilians whether in the East or West are being 
victimized," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Michel Aoun, head of the rival Christian government in East Beirut, blamed 
the bombing on the Syrians, who support the Hoss regime and maintain security 
in the western half of the divided capital. An Aoun communique accused the 
Syrians of trying to provoke a renewal of the artillery war between his mainly 
Christian Lebanese Army troops and the Syrian-backed forces of Druze leader 
Walid Jumblatt. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides have been exchanging fire for the past nine days, triggered by 
Aoun's blockade of ports controlled by Muslim militia south of Beirut. The 
so-called War of the Ports -- harbors are prime revenue producers for both 
government and militia forces -- has taken 49 lives, and is considered the 
worst outbreak of Christian-Muslim fighting in four years. 
</P>
<P>
Another Christian force, the rightist Falangist Party, implied in a Voice of 
Lebanon radio broadcast that the car bomb was related to the controversy over 
Salman Rushdie's novel "The Satanic Verses." The author went into hiding in 
Britain late last month when the Iranian leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini, demanded his assassination for writing what Khomeini called 
blasphemies against the Muslim religion. 
</P>
<P>
"The British Embassy has received death threats," Falangist radio said, noting 
the proximity of the bombing to the embassy. 
</P>
<P>
According to press dispatches from Beirut, Lebanese guards at the embassy fired 
into the air to keep reporters from approaching the grounds. No casualties were 
reported at the embassy.

A teen-age Arab guerrilla caught by Israel after infiltrating from Egypt told 
television viewers Friday that he was sent to kill 100 Israeli soldiers with 15 
minutes of training and a promise of $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
He was one of two Palestinian gunmen Israel captured after they attacked an 
army base near the Egyptian border Wednesday, just hours before Israel handed 
back the Red Sea beach resort of Taba to Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
The guerrilla, identified as Iman Mohammed Hassan Younis, 18, described his 
mission to reporters on Israel Television, saying he was recruited by two men 
about two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"They told us that we have to attack an army base full of 100 Jews," Younis 
said. "They lured us to do this by promising us $20,000 and by showing us the 
Koran." The Koran is Islam's holiest book. 
</P>
<P>
Younis claimed he received only 15 minutes of training. 
</P>
<P>
Younis said he did it for money.

Police charged four people Thursday in the capsizing of a Brazilian tourist 
ship that killed 55 party-goers who planned to spend New Year's Eve watching 
the fireworks on Copacabana Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The charges of putting lives at risk on public transport were lodged against 
two of the ship's owners, the owner of the travel agency that arranged the trip 
and the ship's mechanic. They carry a maximum sentence of 24 years in prison 
upon conviction. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 125 people testified at an inquiry which concluded that the ship had 
been poorly maintained and was overloaded as it set out just before midnight 
last New Year's Eve.

4 HIJACKERS OF SOVIET SCHOOL BUS SENTENCED TO UP TO 15 YEARS

<P>
A team of hijackers who kidnaped a busload of schoolchildren and traded them 
for drugs, money and a flight to Israel were convicted Friday and sentenced to 
prison terms of up to 15 years, the news agency Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court of the Russian republic found four hijackers guilty of 
banditry and illegally crossing the Soviet border. It sentenced the ringleader, 
Pavel Yakshiyants, to 15 years' imprisonment and three others to 14 years each. 
</P>
<P>
One of the three, Vladimir Muravlev, "flew into hysterics" when the sentence 
was read out, Tass said. "It took a 10-minute break to restore him to a state 
of relative calm." 
</P>
<P>
A fifth defendant, found guilty of being an accomplice, was given a three-year 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
The four hijackers commandeered a bus holding 30 fourth-graders and their 
teacher as it left for a field trip to a printing plant in the Caucasus city of 
Ordzhonikidze on Dec. 1. They traded the children and teacher for drugs, a 
large amount of foreign currency and finally for an Ilyushin-76 transport plane 
and safe passage to Israel on Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Israel allowed the plane to land but deported the hijackers the next day. 
</P>
<P>
The incident led to close cooperation between Israel and the Soviet Union, 
which have had no diplomatic relations since the Soviets broke them following 
the 1967 Middle East war. Soviet officials have said most of the hijackers had 
criminal records and that the hijacking was not politically motivated.

More than 50,000 Muslims left mosques and marched throughout the capital Friday 
before gathering at the government's headquarters to demand the death of author 
Salman Rushdie. 
</P>
<P>
Marchers chanted "We will kill Rushdie!" and gathered near the Secretariat, the 
headquarters of the government. 
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, about 3,000 Muslim fundamentalists in Sudan, some shouting "Down, 
down with Britain!" demanded that Sudan break relations with the British 
government, which has defended publication of Rushdie's book "The Satanic 
Verses." 
</P>
<P>
Many Muslims find the book blasphemous because of its depiction of the Prophet 
Mohammed. 
</P>
<P>
Several countries, including Bangladesh and Malaysia, have banned the book, and 
Iran has offered $5.2 million to any Muslim who kills Rushdie, an Indian-born 
Briton of Muslim upbringing.

EGYPT'S TOP POLICE OFFICIAL LABELS KHOMEINI 'A PIG'

<P>
Egypt's top police official Friday called Iran's spiritual leader, the 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, "a pig" and criticized his death decree against 
British author Salman Rushdie. 
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Zaki Badr made the comments to foreign journalists during a 
tour of a village west of Cairo where police and Muslim extremists clashed 
recently, resulting in the brief detention of 30 people. 
</P>
<P>
Badr said he disagrees with Khomeini's death decree against Rushdie, issued 
Feb. 14 because of the Indian-born author's novel, "The Satanic Verses," which 
Muslims consider blasphemous because of its parody of the Prophet Mohammed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Face Him With Facts' 
</P>
<P>
"You know that President Hosni Mubarak has said that of course it is wrong. 
This is not the system (method) to treat him. It is not the system to kill him 
or punish him for a book. It is not like so. Confront him by other means. Face 
him with facts, with opinions and so on," Badr said, speaking in English. 
</P>
<P>
Asked for his opinion of the Iranian spiritual leader, he said: "Khomeini is a 
dog. Pardon me, no, no, he is not a dog, he is a pig, for a dog is faithful." 
</P>
<P>
Muslims are strictly forbidden to eat pork and describing someone as a pig is 
considered deeply insulting. 
</P>
<P>
Badr, who has been at the forefront of Egypt's fight against Muslim extremism, 
said that Islam's growing influence in Egypt does not reflect support for 
Khomeini.

PRISON BAN ON INDIAN SWEAT LODGES VOIDED

A federal judge ruled unconstitutional a Utah State Prison ban on the use of 
ceremonial sweat lodges by Indian inmates. 
</P>
<P>
Indians packed into the courtroom broke into applause, and some into tears; 
and, outside, members of several tribes chanted and pounded ceremonial drums to 
celebrate the Thursday order by U.S. District Judge J. Thomas Greene. 
</P>
<P>
Inmates had fought for two years to be allowed to conduct religious ceremonies 
in the small canvas- and blanket-covered structures. 
</P>
<P>
Greene said the lodges were used at other prisons and he rejected arguments 
that they posed a security risk. He said prison officials may decide how, when 
and where the sweat lodge is used and who may use it.

THREE SENATORS ALLEGE PAC THAT OPPOSED THEM IS FOREIGN AGENT

Three Democratic senators say an imported-car dealers' group that spent almost 
$1 million against them in recent elections is really a foreign agent, and they 
want the Justice Department to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the car group deny working for foreigners, and one said Friday that 
two of the senators asked for and accepted money from them. 
</P>
<P>
Sens. Harry Reid and Richard H. Bryan, both of Nevada, Bob Graham of Florida 
and David L. Boren of Oklahoma signed a letter to the Justice Department 
alleging that the group, a political action committee, is a foreign agent 
working for Japanese auto manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
Boren, who has neither been opposed by nor accepted money from the group, 
signed the letter because his colleagues asked him to and because he is opposed 
to the role political action committees in general are playing in American 
politics, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Nemet, chairman of the Auto Dealers and Drivers Free Trade PAC, a political 
action committee that last year spent nearly $2.6 million on House and Senate 
elections, and Frank Glacken, the PAC's executive director, said in a telephone 
interview from their office in New York that Reid, Bryan and Graham are trying 
to get even because the group spent large amounts of money against them. 
</P>
<P>
They said the organization's funding comes entirely from American citizens. 
</P>
<P>
About 83% of the group's expenditures went to help Republican candidates, 
Federal Election Commission figures show. But the PAC also gave $5,000 to 
Graham and $3,000 to Reid, the FEC records show. Spokesmen said the two had no 
plans to return the money. 
</P>
<P>
Under federal law, individuals or firms representing foreign governments, 
people or companies have to register with the Justice Department as foreign 
agents and report what activities they have carried out for their clients. 
</P>
<P>
Although foreign agents could still give money to political campaigns as 
individual American citizens, the law does not permit them to make such 
contributions in their role as foreign agents.

JESSE JACKSON, EVER ON THE MOVE, ENDS L.A. VISIT WITH A THUMBS-UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He hurries to his limo on Sunset Boulevard. Traffic slows, horns honk and 
admirers yell: "Hey, Jesse!" He shoots them a thumbs-up. He is driven across 
town to Burbank, hoists himself out of the car, and office workers materialize 
on the sidewalk to greet him. Up goes the thumb. 
</P>
<P>
This is the evidence in the Rev. Jesse Jackson's life that all is well. 
</P>
<P>
And to those who claim otherwise, he is ready figuratively with his thumb at 
his nose. 
</P>
<P>
To those who call him troubled, unfocused in these months since the 1988 
presidential election, Jackson replies: "No, no. My mood is up. . . . I'm in 
stride." 
</P>
<P>
To those who say he is stubbornly polarizing Democrats with his recent 
confrontation with party moderates, Jackson snaps: "I've done more to heal the 
party, build the party than anyone." 
</P>
<P>
To those who call him disloyal for supporting a third-party black candidate 
over the white Democratic Party nominee in Chicago's turbulent mayoral 
election, Jackson says the national press "has failed by reducing this thing to 
white and black." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Television Role 
</P>
<P>
Jackson was interviewed Friday during the windup of a Los Angeles visit. For 
two days he had been taping an episode of NBC's sitcom, "A Different World," in 
which he plays himself urging college students to vote. And along the way, he 
crammed in as many speeches, interviews and meetings as is humanly possible, 
for this is a man whose daily schedule still resembles that of a presidential 
contender in the autumn of an election year, not a defeated candidate in the 
spring of the year after. 
</P>
<P>
"People say: 'Jesse, you're all over the place,' " he shrugged. "But that's 
coalition building." 
</P>
<P>
In the four months since the Democratic presidential defeat, Jackson has 
traveled to Africa, is planning a trip to Japan, has flown coast-to-coast any 
number of times. He has walked the picket lines with Eastern Airlines workers 
in their strike against company chairman Frank Lorenzo. He has continued his 
crusade against drugs and gangs. He has helped mediate a potentially explosive 
student protest at mostly black Howard University. He has launched a campaign 
to replace the racial descriptive "black" with "African-American." Now he's 
doing TV. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said he finances his extensive travels by finding a sponsor for each 
trip -- in this case a TV network. "We go places by invitation, and while there 
do other things," he said. "We travel a lot of miles." 
</P>
<P>
The lion's share of national news attention has focused recently on the two 
intertwined political events which speak to the mood and future intentions of 
this man who is now America's most experienced presidential challenger: His 
maverick role in the upcoming Chicago mayor's race and his contentious 
appearance earlier this month at a Philadelphia convention of party moderates 
called the Democratic Leadership Council. 
</P>
<P>
In short, where is Jackson heading? Or leading? 
</P>
<P>
In Philadelphia last week, he warned moderates not to sacrifice the traditional 
Democratic base of minorities and have-nots in trying to win the support of 
middle-class whites. "If we are all things to all people, we become rather 
ill-defined, indecisive -- kind of like warm spit," he said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Riding down the Hollywood Freeway behind the smoked glass of an NBC limousine, 
however, Jackson said he was willing to grant that Democrats cannot win 
elections with just the have-nots, either. 
</P>
<P>
"That kind of polarization is not sound thinking," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson suggested that he is not getting credit from the party for his efforts 
to reach the middle class through their pocketbooks. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't be for Lorenzo and be for 20,000 workers at the same time. A lot of 
these pilots, these $140,000-a-year pilots, have become Republicans because 
they're settled in with prosperity. When they stand up with me and put their 
hats on my head, that's a sign they will vote Democratic. That's leadership. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
"Lorenzo doesn't represent the middle class. He represents the very rich and 
the very greedy. The middle class that we're looking for -- those quote white 
males -- they're the pilots, they're the machinists. They are the new middle 
class." 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 Democratic presidential runner-up is likewise on the spot about his 
party leadership in the racially charged April 4 Chicago mayor's election. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats chose State's Atty. Richard M. Daley, who is white, as their nominee. 
Jackson has chosen instead to support city Alderman Tim Evans, who is black. 
For Jackson to desert his party in favor of Evans, some Democrats have argued, 
is an example of racial loyality and party disloyalty. And this mix is 
something that Jackson has railed against in his own political career. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said that news accounts have not been sufficiently sophisticated in 
presenting the context of long racial struggle in Chicago's Democratic Party. 
He noted that at least twice in the 1980s, leading white figures in the party 
have bolted in favor of third-party white candidates when the Democrats chose a 
black nominee for mayor. And more personally, Jackson said, he twice endorsed 
Daley, the son of the former mayor, for state's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"He's never endorsed me. Reciprocity is a reasonable expectation. Reciprocity 
is an abiding principle with me. . . . There is something pernicious about that 
cabal in Chicago that is ugly." 
</P>
<P>
Some journalists who have watched Jackson closely through two presidential 
campaigns now are beginning to question his focus, although not his energy. 
Words like "troubled" and "adrift" creep into opinion columns and 
conversations. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson insisted this is merely because reporters are no longer traveling with 
him every day to watch him stoke the fires, whether on a network comedy stage 
or at an angry picket line. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm developing relationships that I never had access to before. . . . If one 
day I get a call from machinists, flight attendants and airline pilots, people 
who are former Democrats, and they say, Rev. Jackson will you support us? And I 
get there and they're cheering, pilots putting their hats on my head. And 
they're saying things like, where are the other Democrats now? 
</P>
<P>
"Then that is the right place for me to be," he said. 
</P>

A judge on Friday dismissed a teen-age gang-rape victim's challenge to 
Michigan's voter-approved law cutting off state-funded abortions for poor 
women. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne County Circuit Judge John H. Hausner ruled the law bars an abortion for 
the girl, since her life is not endangered by the pregnancy. He said the law 
does not violate Michigan's Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
The American Civil Liberties Union brought the suit on behalf of the girl, and 
its lawyers promised to appeal. The girl, now about nine weeks pregnant, has 
been offered money for a private abortion.

PARTY ENTERTAINER LOSES 2 FINGERS TO COPTER ROTORS

A "singing telegram" entertainer leaping out of a helicopter to greet a St. 
Patrick's Day party in Malibu lost two fingers of her left hand Friday when she 
raised her arms to wave while the copter's rotors were still turning, a 
sheriff's deputy said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, identified as Chanel Price, 31, of Venice, underwent surgery at UCLA 
Medical Center Friday night. After the freak accident, the pilot of the Hughes 
model 300 helicopter, Gerald Williams, "threw her back in the aircraft" and 
took off, landing the craft at a gas station next to a Malibu emergency clinic, 
said Sheriff's Deputy Detta Roberts. The clinic later transferred Price to 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Price had been hired as a "singing telegram messenger" for the private party, 
Roberts said, and had "stepped out and threw her hands up, and that's when it 
happened."

Charles Vernon Shank was named Friday to become the new director of the 
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, the energy and life science research center run 
by the University of California for the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
Shank, 45, now heads an AT&amp;T Bell electronics lab in New Jersey. He will 
take over Lawrence Berkeley in September, succeeding David A. Shirley, who is 
resigning after nine years as director. 
</P>
<P>
Shank earned his bachelor's, master's and Ph. D. degrees from UC Berkeley, 
where Lawrence Berkeley is located. He is an expert in the field of 
spectroscopy of ultra-fast events, the study of processes that take place in 
femtoseconds -- a millionth of a billionth of a second. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Berkeley has a staff of more than 3,000 and an annual budget of $220 
million from the U.S. Department of Energy. Unlike the other two labs that UC 
runs for the federal government, Lawrence Berkeley does not do work on nuclear 
weapons, officials said.

IRANIAN IMMIGRANTS IN SAN DIEGO COMPLAIN OF INSENSITIVITY, BIAS

When radio talk show host Stacy Taylor suggested to listeners here that they 
attach bumper stickers to their cars saying, "Islam Is Lame," it was just 
another instance of what many Iranians living in the area say is gross 
insensitivity and prejudice toward them. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who works for station KSDO, said in an interview that he has no 
apologies for broadcasting the remark recently, saying he felt "some smart 
entrepreneur" could make a million dollars on the idea. 
</P>
<P>
But Reza Ahmadi, a civil engineer who immigrated from Iran 10 years ago, 
complained bitterly that nothing would happen to vehicles carrying such bumper 
stickers, while an automobile carrying a bumper sticker extolling the virtues 
of Islam would soon be vandalized. 
</P>
<P>
"How come a Mexican-American can have a bumper sticker saying something nice 
about his people or his religion, but an Iranian they will vandalize?" Ahmadi 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Celebrate New Year 
</P>
<P>
The engineer was interviewed as hundreds of Iranian immigrants gathered on the 
beach at La Jolla one evening this week to celebrate the forthcoming Iranian 
New Year with a fire-jumping ceremony that goes back 2,500 years to 
pre-Islamic, Zoroastrian times. 
</P>
<P>
This year, there was a somber aspect to the festivities. It is not an easy time 
to be an Iranian in the United States, some in the crowd said, and, they added, 
with tensions between the United States and Iran threatening to escalate, it 
may grow worse. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to earn a living, but we don't know what we will be doing 
tomorrow," said Mehdi Moen, a teacher's aide in a local school. "I'm not 
politically active and I don't intend to be, but I can't ignore the feelings 
against us." 
</P>
<P>
Moen said he feels that the Iranian community in San Diego is "lacking strong 
leadership, some speaker for our society." 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't know if he would be listened to," he said. "I see lots of 
prejudice. Still, we ought to say we're strongly against these radical 
movements, and the proof is that we're here because we wanted a free life, and 
we're against any fanaticism." 
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Khavarinejad chimed in: "It is bad, at least as far as living here 
now. One fact they (Americans) have to realize is that this group is opposed to 
(the Ayatollah Ruholla) Khomeini." 
</P>
<P>
The next night, in another part of San Diego, an Iranian businessman, who asked 
that his name not be used, said: "The biggest problem we have in America is 
that there is always a general conclusion from a simple observation. They're 
saying now that Iranians are bad. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a nationalist, but I can say we're one of the most peaceful and 
educated communities to ever come to America," the businessman said. "Those 
general conclusions make me sick." 
</P>
<P>
He said he understands why the American news media would give a great deal of 
attention to incidents such as occurred last week when a van belonging to the 
wife of the captain of the missile cruiser Vincennes was bombed, possibly by 
terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
"But as an Iranian what I cannot understand is that it pays so little attention 
to the 12,000 executions that have taken place in Iran since last summer," he 
said. "They included three of my cousins." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Perceived Unfairness 
</P>
<P>
Often, the perceived unfairness transcends current developments and is much 
more general. 
</P>
<P>
"Islam has 1 billion followers," said Reza Rezai of the Iranian Educational, 
Cultural and Social Center here. "Hollywood has portrayed Moses and Jesus 
repeatedly, but no one has had the information or the courage to make a movie 
about the Prophet (Mohammed)." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, it seemed from interviews here this week, ordinary difficulties 
facing many Americans can be misinterpreted by Iranians as instances of 
prejudice directed at them. One person complained that, simply because he was 
seen as Iranian, he had been unable to establish a satisfactory relationship of 
confidence with an automobile dealer, or get a special, religious meal on an 
airliner. 
</P>
<P>
There was an undercurrent among many of the Iranians interviewed, however, of 
real fear that prejudice could turn to violence against them in the future, 
although some acknowledged that anti-Iranian feeling had been worse a decade 
ago, during the first days of the American hostage crisis of 1979-80. 
</P>
<P>
One member of a small faction of pro-Khomeini Iranians interviewed separately 
said, "I see a trend. Something is going to happen. Today, there is no other 
religious minority you can so freely savage and brutalize as you can the 
Muslims." He asked that his name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
Said Ahmadi, the engineer: "When Iran or Khomeini are by any means related to 
any violent events, it immediately gets tremendous (news) coverage, I would say 
basically creating negative publicity for Iranians. I wish we could get these 
issues looked at individually, and not have everything attributed to all of 
us."

UC BERKELEY GETS $15 MILLION FROM LEVI STRAUSS OWNERS FOR NEW SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the largest single personal donation ever to UC Berkeley, the Haas family, 
whose fortune began by selling blue jeans to Gold Rush miners, is donating $15 
million to help build a new business school on campus. 
</P>
<P>
The gift from the Haas family, owners of Levi Strauss &amp; Co., is the 
cornerstone gift for the planned $40-million School of Business Administration. 
The donation, announced at a meeting of UC regents here Friday, is the largest 
single gift to the Berkeley campus and equals the largest in the UC system, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The new school is to be named after the late Walter A. Haas, former president 
of the San Francisco-based clothing company. He was an alumnus of the UC 
Berkeley division that became the business school and himself a major donor to 
the campus. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Devoted to Berkeley' 
</P>
<P>
"Our family has always been devoted to Berkeley, no one more so than our late 
father," said Rhoda Haas Goldman. "He would be most pleased to know that his 
family is continuing his legacy of support to the university he so dearly 
loved." 
</P>
<P>
Goldman and her brother, Peter Haas, chairman of the Executive Committee of 
Levi Strauss, appeared at the regents meeting Friday and were loudly applauded. 
Their brother and co-donator, Walter Haas Jr., owner of the Oakland A's 
baseball team, was not present. All three siblings are alumni of UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
According to UC officials, the Haas donation equals that given two years ago by 
businessman John E. Anderson to build a new Graduate School of Management at 
UCLA. The UCLA school, to be named after Anderson, is expected to open in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complaints About Facilities 
</P>
<P>
The Berkeley business school now shares a building with other departments, and 
students and faculty complain about outdated facilities. UC Berkeley Chancellor 
Ira Michael Heyman said the school now "is as poorly housed as any major 
business school in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
The Haas school will be on the eastern edge of the campus on the site of a 
student health clinic, which will moved. Construction is expected to start in 
early 1991, with a hoped-for completion in fall, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
UC Berkeley tied for ninth place with Columbia University in a 1987 ranking of 
the best business schools in the nation by U.S. News &amp; World Report. 
Stanford placed first and UCLA 13th. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond E. Miles, dean of the Berkeley business school, said the new 
200,000-square-foot building will allow more interaction between students and 
the business community. It will include a large conference center and 
computerized research facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an investment in continued excellence," Miles said of the Haas gift. 
</P>
<P>
Levi Strauss &amp; Co. was founded by its German-Jewish patriarch who moved 
West in 1850 to sell dry goods to miners. The pants he made from tent canvas 
came to be known as Levis. 
</P>
<P>
Strauss and his heirs, now mainly the Haas family, have long been prominent in 
Northern California civic, educational and charitable efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Levi Strauss &amp; Co. is privately held and reported a net income of $111.9 
million on sales of $3.1 billion in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The new business school is to be built totally with private funds, officials 
said. The school now has 560 undergraduates, 540 graduate students and 120 
faculty members. Officials said enrollment will not grow after the new building 
is done. The school is known for its interdisciplinary programs with 
engineering, law, public health, Asian studies and environmental design. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Largest Donations 
</P>
<P>
While record amounts for UC, the Haas and Anderson gifts are far from being the 
largest private donations to higher education in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County industrialist Arnold O. Beckman and his wife, Mabel, gave $50 
million in 1987 to his alma mater, Caltech. In 1986, David Packard, co-founder 
of the Hewlett-Packard Co. electronics firm, pledged $70 million to Stanford 
University, and his partner, William Hewlett, gave Stanford $50 million the 
same year.

'SECURITY CONSULTANT' CONVICTED OF KIDNAPING ADOPTED TODDLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court jury on Friday convicted a man of kidnaping a 
13-month-old boy at gunpoint from the Pacific Palisades home of his adoptive 
parents in December, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In its second day of deliberations, the jury found Jonathan Cosby, 28, of North 
Hollywood, guilty of one count of kidnaping. Cosby is to be sentenced in April. 
He faces a maximum 15 years in state prison, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeannette 
Bernstein, who prosecuted the case. 
</P>
<P>
Cosby, a self-styled "security consultant," was hired by the child's biological 
mother, Bonnie Jean Kiefer, 41, to bring back the infant she had given up in a 
privately arranged adoption. Kiefer was placed on five years probation after 
pleading no contest to a kidnaping charge. 
</P>
<P>
Charges against her husband, Francis Kiefer, were dropped at the preliminary 
hearing, Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
An earlier trial resulted in a deadlocked jury that voted 10 to 2 to convict 
Cosby. 
</P>
<P>
The child was taken at gunpoint from a baby-sitter at the home of Kenneth and 
Barbara Smith. When the Smiths returned home about 1 1/2 hours after the 
abduction, they found the sitter bound and gagged. 
</P>
<P>
The child was found in the Kiefers' custody two days later in New Jersey, where 
they lived. Earlier, the Kiefers had lost a court battle to regain custody of 
their child.

Frances Tracy Pennoyer, 92, the last surviving child of legendary Wall Street 
financier J. P. Morgan Jr. Mrs. Pennoyer, the mother of six, grandmother of 28 
and great-grandmother of 31, was born Jan. 17, 1897, to a father and 
grandfather who were captains of American industry. At one point her father, 
who assumed leadership of the family banking house on the death of her 
grandfather, was believed to be worth $500 million. Unlike her brothers, who

SCULPTOR R. BARTHE, 88; DEPICTED ACTORS, ACTIVISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richmond Barthe, a sculptor best known for his realistic depictions of actors, 
black activists and mythical characters, has died at his Pasadena home at age 
88, it was learned this week. 
</P>
<P>
Barthe, a familiar figure in New York and Los Angeles, had numerous public 
sculptures on both coasts. He worked in marble, bronze and plaster and his 
output ranged from depictions of artist Henry O. Tanner to "The Awakening of 
Africa," in which a muscular male nude pulls himself off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Born in New Orleans to Creole parents, Barthe, who died March 6, began painting 
at age 6 and had his first exhibition at 12. He studied where he could 
(Southern art schools would not accept black students then) until a Catholic 
priest sent him to the Chicago Art Institute, where he studied painting and 
anatomy, but never sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
He took drama classes to lose his thick Southern drawl but also found in the 
theater a source of images. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he told The Times in 1979 that he considered himself an actor. "I must 
be the person I'm making in order to sculpt him. If I can feel what I want the 
art to convey, you will feel it too." 
</P>
<P>
His theatrical busts came to include Sir John Gielgud, Katharine Cornell, 
Maurice Evans and Gypsy Rose Lee. 
</P>
<P>
His other subjects ranged from farmers to children to Hindu temple dancers. His 
public sculpture was equally varied -- from an American eagle in front of the 
Social Security Building in Washington to a 40-foot equestrian statue of Jean 
Dessalines, leader of the 1804 revolution that wrested Haiti from Napoleon's 
forces. That statue stands in Port-au-Prince.

A FIGHT FOR SURVIVAL;

<P>
FRANKIE DUARTE DOESN'T WANT TO BOX ANYMORE, BUT HE HAS NO OTHER CHOICE 
</P>

"I coulda had class. I coulda been a contendah. I coulda been somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Marlon Brando as Terry Malloy in "On the Waterfront" 
</P>
<P>
Rocky Balboa is reel life. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Malloy is real life. 
</P>
<P>
All fighters start out thinking they're going to be Rocky, but too many of them 
wind up like Malloy. Even the successful ones. 
</P>
<P>
Take Frankie Duarte. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a guy who had the toughness to battle back from alcohol and drug 
addiction. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a guy who was a contender for years. 
</P>
<P>
And what's he got to show for it? 
</P>
<P>
At 34, Duarte retired. Now, he's broke and in debt. 
</P>
<P>
This is the Requiem for a bantamweight. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Duarte was boxing at the Forum, before a cheering, 
celebrity-studded crowd, fighting for a world title. Today, he's fighting for 
financial survival, trying to scrape enough money together to pay delinquent 
taxes and perhaps have enough left over to make the payments on his house and 
buy the machinery he needs to start a carpet-cleaning business. 
</P>
<P>
For now, he's dependent on occasional work in the carpet business and money 
from his mother, Lillian, with whom he lives in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Six weeks ago, Duarte had another title shot lined up, with International 
Boxing Federation champion Orlando Canizales. Duarte was in line to get 
$25,000. The fight, originally scheduled for mid-January, was postponed when 
Canizales came down with an infection. 
</P>
<P>
Before it could be rescheduled, Duarte walked out on his handlers, the Goossen 
family of North Hollywood, and announced his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't want to fight anymore," Duarte said the other day. "I wasn't a 
champion of the world, but I came as close as you can get. I take great 
satisfaction in what I accomplished, even though I don't have the money to show 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
"People remember you for your last fight. I'd rather walk out of the fight game 
than go out on my back because I've had one fight too many. Who am I kidding? 
I'm a 34-year-old man. I have a great chin, but there's always that night the 
chin turns to rust. It happens to the greatest of them. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been able to stay young for a long time, but now I've gotten old. When I 
punch the bag, my hand hurts. When I do road work, my knees hurt." 
</P>
<P>
That's understandable. Even at his peak, Duarte took as much as he gave, often 
more. He was willing to take three punches to land one. The scar tissue piled 
up over his eyes. Even in victory, his blood flowed with the champagne. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm basically broke," Duarte said. "But I at least still have my marbles, 
although who knows what will happen two years from now. Sometimes brain 
problems show up later. I want to come out standing right and talking right. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone called and offered me $150,000 to fight, I would have to turn it 
down because what I stand for is far more important than the money. Others 
might take the money, take a beating and then have their managers throw in the 
towel. I won't do that. When I get in the ring, I fight to the death. And I'm 
too young to die." 
</P>
<P>
Duarte, who grew up in Venice, began fighting in 1973 and won his first 16 
matches. The bleak days began in 1979, when drug and alcohol addiction 
temporarily cost him his career, and nearly his life. 
</P>
<P>
The postfight parties got longer and longer until, finally, he did away with 
the fighting altogether and just devoted himself to the partying. 
</P>
<P>
The drug use increased. Recreational drugs were gradually replaced with the 
hard stuff. Duarte eventually turned to heroin. 
</P>
<P>
"I was with these guys one night and I told them to make mine a good one," said 
Duarte of his worst experience with heroin. "I went into the bathroom and 
slammed it in. I turned on the water to wash off my arm and boom!" 
</P>
<P>
That's all Duarte remembers until he woke up hours later in a bathtub, huge 
blisters on his feet. 
</P>
<P>
His companions told him how he had nearly died, how they had tried to bring him 
back with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, by shooting salt into his veins, and 
finally by lighting matches to the bottoms of his bare feet to shock his system 
back to life. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so remorseful," Duarte said. "I promised myself, this was it. I was 
going to quit. I was such a screw-off. I quit -- for two weeks. Then I went 
right back on it." 
</P>
<P>
That was 1983. A year later, Duarte, who figures he overdosed two or three 
times, finally did quit. He signed with the Ten Goose Boxing Club of North 
Hollywood, the Goossen family business, and, under trainer Joe Goossen, 
underwent a rigorous conditioning program. Soon Duarte was back in the ring, 
fighting as though the previous five years had been nothing more than a bad 
dream. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, his biggest vice was sneaking away from training occasionally to get 
some Mexican food. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Duarte won the North American Boxing Federation bantamweight title. A 
year later, he finally got his long-awaited world-title shot, losing a 15-round 
decision to World Boxing Assn. champion Bernardo Pinango at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Four months later, Duarte returned to the Forum and successfully defended his 
NABF crown against Albert Davila, winning on a 10th-round TKO. 
</P>
<P>
It was nice, but it wasn't a world title. That was what Duarte felt he truly 
needed to make his career complete. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte's manager, Dan Goossen, went to work behind the scenes. A fight was 
arranged last year with Wilfredo Vasquez, the new WBA champ. Duarte was to 
receive between $40,000 and $50,000, a heavy purse for a bantamweight. But 
first Vasquez had a title defense against Kaokor Galaxy of Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte was told that would be just a formality. It wasn't. Vasquez lost. 
</P>
<P>
Goossen tried to match Duarte with Galaxy, but Galaxy was too badly cut from 
the Vasquez fight. 
</P>
<P>
Goossen talked with Kelvin Seabrooks, International Boxing Federation 
bantamweight champion, but details couldn't be agreed upon. 
</P>
<P>
A bout against Miguel Lora, the World Boxing Council bantamweight champion, was 
discussed, but Duarte wasn't ready for a fight as quickly as Lora wanted. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, when Canizales beat Seabrooks, a deal was struck. Duarte and Canizales 
would fight on Jan. 15 at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
For Duarte, it was none too soon. He was financially tapped out. His purse from 
the Pinango fight had been $15,000. Five thousand of that had gone for training 
expenses. After deducting the manager's share, Duarte walked away with just 
$7,000 before taxes. 
</P>
<P>
That may not seem like a lot for a nationally televised bout, but it's about 
scale for bantamweights. They are just not in a lucrative division. Once you 
get below the welterweights, big purses are rare. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte's share of the Davila fight was $29,000. But he fought just twice 
afterward, tune-ups to keep him sharp. His income from those two bouts, both 
last year, was $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte's parents helped him out financially. He responded in the only way he 
could, by doing chores around the house. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte said he went to Goossen, his manager, several times for money just to 
live. 
</P>
<P>
"When you go in that office to ask for a few bucks, you were made to feel like 
a pain in the . . . . I was never able to be business minded. It was not 
because of stupidity, but being a fighter takes so much concentration. You 
think boxing, boxing, boxing. I couldn't think about what was best for me. I 
hoped Dan Goossen was thinking about what was best for me. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him for a loan for $1,200 for a down payment on a house and he said he 
was broke. This is the guy who drives a fancy car and hangs with the stars." 
</P>
<P>
Said Goossen: "I'm sorry Frankie felt like that. Unfortunately, I disappointed 
him. It hurts me, because I don't ever want to disappoint anyone, especially 
someone I respect like Frankie Duarte. 
</P>
<P>
"I always felt that not only were my office doors open, but our family doors 
were open as well. Frankie was someone who always worked hard for everything. 
He may have felt uncomfortable to come in and ask me something he didn't want 
to ask. But my door is always open. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of what Frankie Duarte accomplished. I always wanted him to be a 
part of Ten Goose after his career was over. To me, he'll always be a world 
champion." 
</P>
<P>
The car Duarte is currently driving was paid for by Ten Goose, but Duarte says 
the Goossens are now trying to repossess it. 
</P>
<P>
When he wasn't fighting, Duarte helped out Joe Goossen as a corner man in 
fights involving other Ten Goose boxers, but says he never got paid for that. 
</P>
<P>
"If I owe anything to Ten Goose, I would say it would be to Joe because, as my 
trainer, he pushed me beyond what I thought I was going to be able to do," 
Duarte said. "I understand the Goossens took a chance by going with a 
29-year-old fighter on drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Duarte was to have received $25,000 for the Canizales fight. He got a $5,000 
advance, but the fight was put off by Canizales' sickness and was going to have 
to be delayed for at least a few months. 
</P>
<P>
That was too long for Duarte. He retired. 
</P>
<P>
Doesn't make sense, you say? Why would someone desperately in need of money, 
desperately chasing a world title across nearly two decades, quit just a few 
months away from his goal? 
</P>
<P>
"Every time there was a chance for a title shot, I would get in the gym and get 
all psyched," Duarte said. "Then boom, when it fell through, I would go all the 
way down mentally. I had a hard time psyching myself up again. 
</P>
<P>
"When I get excited and get that spark about fighting, it can lead to a 
towering inferno. Then I fight like the devil. But when things fall through, 
that inferno would go back to just a pilot light. The pilot light was always 
on. But when the Canizales fight fell through, the pilot light went out, and I 
just can't light it again. I can't produce an inferno anymore. The pilot light 
has died." 
</P>
<P>
Goossen said he understands. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame. I would have liked to have enjoyed the title with Frankie," 
Goossen said. "But I'm happy that someone that close to a world title fight 
makes such a decision for his peace of mind. I'm happy that if he feels in his 
mind he shouldn't fight, he is strong enough to stick to it. I'm always happy 
someone can make a decision like that. You can't lie to yourself." 
</P>
<P>
But Duarte is not happy. He is bitter. And most of his bitterness is directed 
at the Goossens. Not just because of his financial plight, either. He believes 
he was shunted aside, once Ten Goose's other major fighter, middleweight 
Michael Nunn, won the IBF title. Duarte believes that Dan Goossen turned down a 
potentially lucrative rematch with Davila to pursue a title fight that never 
materialized. 
</P>
<P>
"Dan talked me into turning down Davila," Duarte said. "You know how slick he 
is. He said I'd be better off with the title. He did it for himself. He could 
get more credibility for Ten Goose by getting a 34-year-old fighter a world 
championship. But now I don't have either the title or the money from a Davila 
fight. I could have been living in a two-story house with a swimming pool and 
have some cash flow." 
</P>
<P>
Responded Goossen: "The key was to get Frankie enough money to live off the 
rest of his life. Rather than having him make big money now and see it gone in 
a year or a year and a half, we wanted to try to keep him in the chips for the 
rest of his life. The only way he could do that was with a world title. Then he 
could do the talk shows, the movie, the book. We wanted to keep him in the 
money after boxing and we knew he did not have much time left in the ring." 
</P>
<P>
How hard did Goossen really work at getting a title shot? 
</P>
<P>
"Dan Goossen was on my tail. That is the truth," said Norm Kaplan, a Los 
Angeles attorney who has represented both Pinango and Vasquez. "It seemed like 
a daily situation on the telephone with him. He was exerting all effort to get 
his fighter a title shot. If I was in his shoes, I'd have done same thing, 
rather than go after the Davila fight." 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, however, reality for Duarte is poverty. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got back into boxing, I was just hoping to get a fight or two, and 
maybe a junk car and an apartment," he said. "Instead, I did many good things, 
the most important being getting off drugs and alcohol. I think I gained the 
respect of a lot of people. I wrote my book. It's just that the final chapter 
was never completed." 
</P>
<P>
Postscript: Some dreams die hard. 
</P>
<P>
Two days after having spoken with a reporter, Duarte changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
He would not return to the Goossens, but he would fight Canizales if a deal 
could be put together. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Hoffman, who handles Canizales, doesn't know if that is still possible. He 
wouldn't rule it out, but the date, site and TV deal have already been lost for 
this fight. 
</P>
<P>
Rocky gets sequels. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Malloy may not. 
</P>
<P>
"I would rather retire," Duarte said. "But I realize I cannot. I have to fight 
because I don't want to lose my house. It's all I have." 
</P>
<P>
The reality of bills and debts has reignited the pilot light. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm positive I could knock Canizales out because he's too small for me," 
Duarte said. "He can't take my pressure. I will not just get a payday. I will 
find a way to get motivated again. I will come out a winner. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm angry I am left with no other options. I wish I could find a way where I 
don't have to fight again. I really do. I don't have a high school diploma. I 
have no real skills. So I have to do something I don't really want to do. It's 
scary."

Now watch what happens. Roger Clemens will go 9-15 with a 4.82 earned run 
average, the Boston Red Sox will finish fifth, and his excuse will be that Orel 
Hershiser is getting more money than he is: being only the second-highest-paid 
player in baseball dulls his competitive edge. 
</P>
<P>
What we pay gifted young men for the rare privilege and the pure joy of playing 
baseball at the major league level is pathological (so is what we pay rock 
stars, featured actors on "Dallas," chief executive officers who sell out their 
own companies and certain District Court judges, but I prefer to bash one group 
at a time). My favorite pathology is the Philadelphia Phillies shortstop who 
got a raise to $250,000 after hitting .187, down from all of .232 in 1987, 
while his team finished dead last. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, baseball executives are out of their minds. For all the millions the 
Baltimore Orioles are going to shell out this year, the 1989 edition isn't 
going to be much better than if they kept Cal Ripken, Phil Bradley, Brian 
Holton and Dave Schmidt and brought in 20 other guys from Rochester and 
Charlotte at the major-league minimum ($62,500 in 1988). 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, we are raising kids who think that Australia is near the Grand 
Canyon, who will work assembling things conceived and designed in Japan, Korea, 
or Singapore, and who will vote Republican forever. The United States may be 
the first society in history to choose illiteracy deliberately. 
</P>
<P>
Small wonder, though, when a dedicated teacher can put in 40 years and never 
make in one year what a 20-year-old college dropout can get as a pinch runner. 
You have to be nuts to run a baseball team, and you have to be a saint to be a 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
What really bugs me is that every time I go out to Memorial Stadium or even 
watch a ballgame on TV I'm casting a vote for this state of affairs. You spend 
your life loving baseball and remaining faithful, while the jerks in the front 
office and the graceful young ignoramuses on the field reward your devotion 
with increasing contempt. 
</P>
<P>
As greedy as they get, they know you'll keep coming back. You'll pay the 
freight as far as the gravy train wants to go -- because the game on the 
greensward is just too beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I really can't ask anybody to join me in a baseball fans' strike. As soon 
as the weather warms up, and I hear the buttery voice of Jim Palmer or the 
leathery one of Vin Scully, my boycott is over. As far as the eternal 
perfection of baseball is concerned, I'm easy. 
</P>
<P>
But I do have this wicked idea. 
</P>
<P>
How about setting a top individual income at, say, $750,000 a year -- who will 
have the nerve to call this hardship wages? -- and tax anything over it at 90%? 
Put the money in a government fund exclusively earmarked for the doubling of 
teacher salaries. If we pay teachers twice as much, we attract the sort of able 
professional whose idealism is mixed with economic self-respect, and we begin 
to phase out the English teacher who has to go back to school herself to learn 
how to write a clear sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, this is a major monkey wrench thrown into the mysterious machinery of the 
free market. But you don't have to have a degree from the London School of 
Economics to know that there is something wrong with a free market that values 
a utility infielder more highly than a career public school teacher. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a market that is producing a kinder, gentler, fairer, more 
informed, more productive, more civic-spirited America. 
</P>
<P>
So write your congressman, your senators, your state legislators, or clip this 
column and send it to them: Nobody needs to make more than 750 grand a year. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, let's go to spring training with a clear conscience: with as much 
respect for learning as love for baseball.

RICHARDSON PROVIDES BIG ASSIST AS BRUINS BEAT CYCLONES, 84-74

<TEXT>
<P>
Summarizing a surprisingly routine 84-74 victory over Iowa State Friday night 
in the first round of the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. basketball 
tournament, UCLA Coach Jim Harrick methodically rattled off the keys to the 
Bruins' success: 
</P>
<P>
 -- They ran their fast break well. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They effectively executed their half-court offense. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They defended. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They rebounded. 
</P>
<P>
"And then we had Jerome," Harrick called out. 
</P>
<P>
That would be Jerome (Pooh) Richardson, who scored 19 points and equaled a UCLA 
record with 14 assists as the Bruins improved their record to 21-9 and advanced 
to the second round of the Southeast Regional. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA will meet second-seeded and fifth-ranked North Carolina (28-7) Sunday in a 
rematch of a December game won by the Tar Heels, 104-78. 
</P>
<P>
"It's payback time," Richardson announced on television after UCLA had polished 
off an Iowa State team that ended its season 17-12. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not the Bruins have enough to overtake the Tar Heels remains to be 
determined in the 1:50 p.m., PST, game that will be televised by CBS, but they 
won rather easily against the Cyclones, who tied Oklahoma State for fourth 
place in the Big Eight. 
</P>
<P>
The key to the victory? 
</P>
<P>
As well as Richardson played, and Harrick described him as magnificent, it may 
have been a defensive adjustment by Harrick. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Alexander, Iowa State's 6-foot 9-inch, 255-pound center, burned the 
Bruins for 22 points and 13 rebounds but didn't make a shot and scored only 
three points in the last 14 minutes 18 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, Harrick said, stopped switching defensively underneath, instead 
utilizing a single defender on the wide-bodied Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Rochelin fouled out, and Keith Owens picked up three fouls in 16 
minutes, but those two, along with Don MacLean, bottled up Alexander when the 
Cyclones needed his offensive abilities the most. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a little confused at times when we switched, which caused them to get 
some easy baskets," said UCLA's Trevor Wilson, who explained that the Bruins 
increased their defensive pressure after Alexander made two free throws with 
8:14 left to give Iowa State a 60-59 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa State, which had trailed since the early moments of the game, missed four 
shots in a row after that, and UCLA scored 10 straight points. 
</P>
<P>
A jump shot from the baseline by Darrick Martin gave UCLA the lead for good at 
61-60, and the Bruins added a layup by Richardson, two free throws by Owens, 
another layup by Richardson and a layup by Rochelin, who took a pass from 
Richardson to make it 69-60 with 6:09 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were very impatient on offense," Iowa State's Mike Born said. 
"We'd put up a shot, and they'd get the rebound and take it the other way. And 
if you're playing 10 seconds of offense and 30 or 40 seconds of defense, it can 
wear you down." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA was outrebounded by the Cyclones, 42-30, but shot 57.4% while Iowa State 
shot only 43.1%. 
</P>
<P>
MacLean led the Bruins with 23 points, making 11 of 16 shots, and Rochelin 
scored 16 points in 25 minutes off the bench. Wilson scored 14 points, 
including 10 in the second half, and led UCLA with 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Baugh had 16 points and nine rebounds for Iowa State, which played fast 
and loose with the ball and looked disorganized at times. 
</P>
<P>
"We fumbled the ball more than I've ever seen," Coach Johnny Orr said. "We 
couldn't catch it or get it going. We couldn't get coordinated. That was our 
worst performance in five or six weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Iowa State lost three of its top six players after the start of the season, 
including 6-5 forward Elmer Robinson, who was the Cyclones' No. 2 scorer when 
he was declared academically ineligible in January. 
</P>
<P>
The Cyclones, though, finished the season strong, beating seventh-ranked 
Missouri last month and losing to fourth-ranked Oklahoma on a last-second 
three-point shot last week in the semifinals of the Big Eight tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"At the end of the year, I think we were playing as well as anybody in our 
league," Orr had said Thursday. "It's very satisfying to see a team come 
together and play as well as we have played." 
</P>
<P>
Or had played, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA came into the tournament after losing to Stanford, 95-86, last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
But the Bruins started fast, using a 10-0 run to jump out to a 20-10 lead and 
later a 5-0 run to make it 31-18. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa State rallied, though, outscoring the Bruins, 13-2, to cut its deficit to 
37-35 before Rochelin, who made seven of 11 shots and scored 14 points in the 
first half, took a pass from Richardson and made an 18-foot jumper with four 
seconds left for a 39-35 UCLA lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson had nine assists in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander led Iowa State with 14 points and eight rebounds in the first 20 
minutes, making five of nine shots and four of six free throws. 
</P>
<P>
The Cyclones outrebounded the Bruins, 23-15, in the first half but made only 
41.9% of their shots while UCLA hit 54.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa State finally caught up to the Bruins, 51-51, on a shot from the key by 
Adrian Moore with 12:03 left. They tied it again, 53-53, on a layup by Moore 
and finally took the lead on Alexander's free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander, though, scored only one more point the rest of the way and was shut 
out after making a free throw with 5:55 left. 
</P>
<P>
Had the lumbering Alexander simply run out of gas? 
</P>
<P>
He's a big guy, as the UCLA band noticed, serenading Alexander with chants of 
"Tub-by, Tub-by," whenever he shot a free throw. 
</P>
<P>
"He shouldn't be fatigued," Orr said. "There's so many timeouts in these games 
that I don't know how in the hell you'd ever get tired." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander, though, looked winded at the end. 
</P>
<P>
Not so Richardson, who rarely comes out of the game for the Bruins, 
orchestrating almost everything they do. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been that way all year," Harrick said. "He's why we win." 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth time Pooh Richardson had equaled the UCLA assist record, 
which he shares with Greg Lee, Andre McCarter and Roy Hamilton. Richardson, the 
Pacific 10 Conference's all-time assist leader, last had 14 assists in a game 
Feb. 16 during a 93-86 loss to Arizona State. . . . In UCLA's last 12 games, 
Richardson has 104 assists and only 19 turnovers, better than a 5-1 ratio. A 
ratio of 3-1 is considered by Coach Jim Harrick to be outstanding. Richardson 
had only one turnover against Iowa State. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, overwhelmed by North Carolina, 104-78, last Dec. 17 at Chapel Hill, N.C., 
has been beaten worse only three times in its history, including a 107-70 loss 
to the Tar Heels at Chapel Hill in 1985 and a 102-64 pounding by Arizona last 
month at Tucson. . . . UCLA has been outrebounded in each of its last five 
games and six of its last seven. 
</P>
<P>
Harrick, on Iowa State's sophomore center, Victor Alexander: "He's as good as 
we've played. I really, really like him. In fact, he can come to UCLA if he 
wants. He's the kind of low-post guy you really like." . . . Freshman guard 
Darrick Martin had five assists and five steals for UCLA.

Evansville guard Reed Crafton ended Ralph Miller's long coaching career with a 
long shot Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Crafton made a three-pointer with 10 seconds left in overtime as Evansville 
beat Miller's Oregon State team, 94-90, in the first round of the National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. West Regional. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, who is retiring at age 70, ended his 38-year college coaching career 
with 674 victories and 370 losses. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry it's over," he said. "I'm pleased with the results of our team this 
year and I hoped we could win one more. But so be it." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, Evansville (25-5) will play Seton Hall, a 60-51 winner over Southwest 
Missouri State. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Payton put Oregon State ahead, 90-89, on a short jumper with 49 seconds 
left and was fouled on the play, but he missed the free throw. 
</P>
<P>
After Evansville retook the lead on Crafton's second three-pointer of the 
overtime, Oregon State called a timeout. Payton missed a three-pointer with 
four seconds left and fouled out two seconds later. 
</P>
<P>
Evansville made half of its 24 three-point attempts, including all four in 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to shoot the three-point shot, and if we don't hit it, we lose," 
Evansville Coach Jim Crews said. 
</P>
<P>
Payton, who finished with 31 points, had tied the game, 78-78, with 11 seconds 
left in regulation on two free throws, after the Beavers outscored Evansville, 
15-4, in the last 4 1/2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Haffner, who led Evansville with 26 points, missed a three-pointer with 
two seconds to go, forcing the overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Teo Alibegovic scored eight points in the extra session for Oregon State, which 
finished the season 22-8. 
</P>
<P>
"We had two problems," said Miller, who took the Beavers to the NCAA tournament 
eight times. "We missed too many easy shots, and we made too many fouls." 
</P>
<P>
Evansville, which won the regular-season title in the Midwestern Collegiate 
Conference, had lost its only previous NCAA tournament game in 1982 to 
Marquette. 
</P>
<P>
Evansville led, 73-64, with 4:51 remaining after Crafton, who scored 13 points, 
sank a jumper to cap an 11-point run. 
</P>
<P>
The Aces trailed, 39-37, at halftime, but Haffner hit a layup and a 
three-pointer and the lead then changed four times before Oregon State tied it, 
at 47-47, on a jumper by Payton. 
</P>
<P>
Evansville took the lead again, however, and held it until Eric Knox's 
three-pointer gave Oregon State a 64-62 lead with 8:58 left.

PERHAPS KAHN SHOULD NOT BE TOO SURPRISED AT LASORDA'S REACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Roger Kahn ought to go after the guy who wrote the Al Campanis column under his 
name in the March 14 paper. 
</P>
<P>
The writer is obviously an imposter, because the real Roger Kahn, the one who 
wrote "The Boys of Summer," the one with wit and whimsy, would never write such 
self-serving nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
If Kahn were really as defensive as this guy sounds, nobody would blame Tom 
Lasorda for giving him the cold shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Why would a person seek to justify himself two years later? Was that his last 
great claim to fame?

ZIEGLER PROVIDES A GOOD EXAMPLE IN PROBERT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NHL president John Ziegler does not rule his sport with the authority of the 
other three major sports commissioners, but at times his decisions are 
noteworthy. 
</P>
<P>
The recent expulsion of Detroit Red Wing all-star Bob Probert is a good 
example. Probert used drugs, was caught and removed from the game. Unlike other 
sports that try to work with the athletes, the NHL respects the players and 
treats them as normal people. Namely, abuse drugs and you'll be excused from 
your livelihood. 
</P>
<P>
No slaps on the wrist for three-time offenders as in the NBA and major league 
baseball.

ART OF UNDERSTATEMENT LEAVES HIM WONDERING

My ribs still ache from laughing at the Morning Briefing column (March 6) 
discussing the $1.3-million prize of this summer's Tour de France. "Not bad for 
pedaling a bike across a couple of hills" was the last line. 
</P>
<P>
By that standard: Joe Montana and Jerry Rice played "catch" in the Super Bowl; 
Kirk Gibson's game-winning shot in the World Series was "batting practice at 
the local high school," and the L.A. Marathon was a "stroll to the local 
tanning salon."

Jim Babbitt of Manhattan Beach writes (March 11) to complain, "all that 
marathon coverage and not one word about wheelchairs." 
</P>
<P>
While he may be unhappy with print coverage, he should know that during the 
course of six hours of coverage, KNX Newsradio provided: a live interview with 
the defending wheelchair division champion; live coverage of the start of the 
wheelchair race, coverage of the winner crossing the line, and minutes later, a 
live interview with the winner. 
</P>
<P>
To paraphrase Mr. Babbitt, "All that critiquing and not one word about radio."

HOLYFIELD-DOKES BOUT GIVES FANS A REASON TO TAKE HEART IN THE SPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Earl Gustkey

<TEXT>
<P>
In a way, it was awful to see. No one, no matter how much they are paid, should 
take that many hard blows to the head. 
</P>
<P>
And no one, in any lifetime, should be asked to summon that much courage, that 
much heart, short of wartime combat. 
</P>
<P>
But it was a war, last Saturday's heavyweight battle between Evander Holyfield 
and Michael Dokes in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Boxing, for all its blemishes and critics, every so often rewards its followers 
with something so special it makes it easier to put up with the frequent 
mismatches, the phony ratings and the rest of the sport's nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
As a group, boxers aren't eloquent. Few could tell you, for example, why they 
possess such courage and so many of us do not. 
</P>
<P>
But neither Holyfield nor Dokes needed to say a thing after they had assaulted 
each other for just short of 10 rounds. When Dokes finally went crashing down 
in the 10th, he had absolutely nothing left. 
</P>
<P>
You found yourself wondering in the aftermath about the nature of courage 
itself -- about how Dokes, 30, could display such heart inside a boxing ring 
and yet be so ill-equipped to handle drug addiction, which took 33 months out 
of his career. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-round battle between Holyfield and Dokes ranks as the most exciting 
heavyweight bout since Larry Holmes beat Ken Norton in 1978. On a list of most 
exciting heavyweight fights since the mid-1950s, it makes the top 10. Some 
others: 
</P>
<P>
1955 -- Rocky Marciano-Archie Moore, New York. 
</P>
<P>
1973 -- Muhammad Ali-Ken Norton II, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
1974, 1975 -- Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier II and III; New York, Manila. 
</P>
<P>
1976 -- George Foreman-Ron Lyle, Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
1978 -- Larry Holmes-Ken Norton, Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
1983 -- Michael Dokes-Mike Weaver II, Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, 1989 is already a big year for memorable boxing matches. The Roberto 
Duran-Iran Barkley bout in Atlantic City, N.J., last month also makes the 
long-remembered list. 
</P>
<P>
After he had lost a decision and his World Boxing Council middleweight 
championship to Duran, Barkley said a lot about the primal appeal his sport 
holds on so many people when he said of the 37-year-old Duran: 
</P>
<P>
"It was his heart; it just wouldn't go." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Sanders, Holyfield's manager, caught a lot of headlines with his 
$25-million, winner-take-all challenge to Mike Tyson after the Dokes fight, 
which was his intent, but don't look for it to happen. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Goossen, middleweight champion Michael Nunn's manager, was talking about 
the winner-take-all proposition the other day. 
</P>
<P>
"It's absolutely ridiculous," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Holyfield stands to make an absolute minimum $8 million fighting Tyson. You 
don't throw that away. Even if you're convinced your guy will win, what about 
if he loses on a cut in the first round? 
</P>
<P>
"Tyson-Holyfield doesn't need a gimmick to make serious money. Remember, Tyson 
brings a lot to the table." 
</P>
<P>

LIETZKE SURVIVES GOOF, LEADS BY 2 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bruce Lietzke is an easygoing person, who doesn't regard himself as a macho 
man. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Lietzke admitted Friday that he turned macho on the 16th hole of the 
Tournament Players Championship at Sawgrass. 
</P>
<P>
He was battling David Frost for the lead in the tournament at that point and 
had to decide what type of second shot he would hit on the par-five, 497-yard 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
"There was an angel on one shoulder and a devil on the other," said Lietzke, 
who dismissed the angel and went for the green with a three-iron. 
</P>
<P>
The shot went into the water, but Lietzke still managed to save par. After 
taking his drop, he hit a pitching wedge within 10 feet of the hole and made 
the putt. 
</P>
<P>
It was a pivotal hole for Lietzke, who finished with a 69 and a two-day total 
of 135, nine under par. He had a two-stroke lead over Frost, who bogeyed two of 
his final three holes. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Couples was at 138, and eight pros were grouped at 139 -- Fulton Allem, 
Chip Beck, Ben Crenshaw, Gary Koch, Tom Kite, Paul Azinger, Mark McCumber and 
Dan Pohl. 
</P>
<P>
Lietzke said he had some doubts about his club selection on No. 16 because 
there was a slight wind blowing from left to right and he's a left-to-right 
player. 
</P>
<P>
"My only other alternative was to hit a pitching wedge lay-up shot and my pride 
wouldn't let me do that, so I played the macho way and socked it into the 
water," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was probably a poor decision. But in the back of mind I knew my ball would 
be fading. And, if I hit into the water, I'd be able to drop the ball pretty 
close to the green. I could still salvage a par if I followed up that bad shot 
with two good ones. Fortunately, I did it." 
</P>
<P>
Lietzke said he would have felt bad about himself if he had pulled out a 
pitching wedge to safely lay up. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more of a personal thing," he said. "It's almost like you're backing 
down. You're trying to prove to yourself that you can hit a shot that you 
probably won't pull off. 
</P>
<P>
"Eighty or 90% of the time, I would try that (three-iron) shot instead of the 
conservative way of doing it. And I think most guys are like that these days. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got a three-iron in your hand and I kind of pride myself in my long 
irons. That big, old par-five green is sitting up there. You start licking your 
chops. And I'm thinking what an eagle would do for me (to) separate me from the 
pack a little bit. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't consider myself an egotistical person, but you are always trying to 
prove things to yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Lietzke, who had a 66 Thursday, said that the course played about two shots 
harder Friday because of sudden gusts of winds and firmer greens. 
</P>
<P>
Lietzke, 37, who lives in Dallas, had four birdies and only one bogey. 
</P>
<P>
"You had to allow for about a seven- to eight-yard bounce to your shots," 
Lietzke said. "That's how firm the greens were." 
</P>
<P>
Frost, who started on the 10th tee and was tied with Lietzke after 15 holes, 
ran into trouble on the seventh hole. He three-putted from 40 feet for a bogey 
and then had another bogey on the par-five, 582-yard ninth. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit a couple of bad shots coming in, so I immediately went to the practice 
tee," Frost said. "I like the course, but it doesn't reward the good shot. You 
can't attack it all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Keith Clearwater, the first-round leader with a 65, faded quickly. He had a 76, 
a score that was matched by Curtis Strange, the leading money-winner last year. 
</P>
<P>
Strange made the cut, though, along with 73 other players. It was at 146 and 
such prominent players as Mark Calcavecchia, Hale Irwin, Mark O'Meara, Raymond 
Floyd and Jeff Sluman didn't make it. Neither did Sam Randolph, the former USC 
star, who had a two-day total of 151. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Pate, the former Bruin, also had some problems. He was tied for second 
with Lietzke and Frost Thursday after shooting a 66. But he soared to a 78 -- 
and a 144 -- Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Norman had the best round of the day with a 67. His round put him six 
strokes behind Lietzke. 
</P>
<P>
Morning fog delayed the start of the tournament for 45 minutes and Lietzke, 
playing in the afternoon, said there was some concern that he would be able to 
finish before it got dark. 
</P>
<P>
"At 6 a.m., I wasn't even sure we could play," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The winner here gets a 10-year exemption on the tour, not to mention a first 
place check of $243,000. 
</P>
<P>
But Lietzke said the exemption is not a high priority for him. 
</P>
<P>
"If I get it, I might give it back," he said jokingly. "I have been looking for 
a way to retire. However, a few years ago I said I wouldn't be playing by 1990 
and that prediction doesn't hold much water now." 
</P>
<P>
Lietzke, who has 11 tour victories, is selective in the tournaments he plays. 
</P>
<P>
"I play a lot from January to May, but I like to have some time off during the 
summer," he said.

Texas Rangers owner Eddie Chiles said he has agreed to sell his majority shares 
to a group led by George W. Bush, the President's son. 
</P>
<P>
Chiles twice had tried to sell the team to Edward L. Gaylord, but each attempt 
was rejected by American League owners, who were concerned about his ownership 
of Gaylord Broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
Gaylord, who owns 33% of the team, must approve the sale. In addition, approval 
is needed from both leagues, but that is expected to be routine. 
</P>
<P>
No purchase price was announced, but Chiles, who will remain chairman of the 
board, said Bush had agreed to keep the team in Texas.

The 18-year-old second baseman from Manassas, Va., who failed to earn a spot on

CLIPPERS LOSE DESPITE BENJAMIN'S BEST EFFORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It would seem physically impossible for a 7-foot, 250-pound center to disappear 
right before 10,758 fans, especially one who was playing probably the best game 
of his career, but the Clippers made it happen Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The same magicians also made an 11-point lead vanish in the final 7:55 of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Of such miracles are 13-51 teams made. 
</P>
<P>
That's where the Clippers stand after a 108-105 loss to the Charlotte Hornets 
at the Sports Arena that wasted 34 points and 23 rebounds, both career highs, 
and a season-best eight blocked shots by center Benoit Benjamin. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pleased with the way I shot the ball," said Benjamin, who is averaging 
24.2 points, 13.4 rebounds and 3.6 blocks in the last four outings. "When I get 
the ball, I can do things like that." 
</P>
<P>
So how many times did Benjamin get the ball in the final two minutes? 
</P>
<P>
Once. On an offensive rebound. 
</P>
<P>
In beating the Clippers for the second straight time, Charlotte (16-48) closed 
the game with a 15-4 run that turned a 101-93 deficit into a victory. The 
Clippers, who got their last field goal with 3:12 to play, made just 17 of 30 
free throws (56.7%), missing four of their final eight attempts. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers capped it off by blowing at least a chance to tie the game. They 
got the ball back with six seconds left after Kurt Rambis missed a layup, but 
Gary Grant pushed the ball upcourt and fired a straight-away three-point shot 
as Coach Don Casey and assistant Jim Eyen were imploring their players for a 
timeout. No one on the court heard them. 
</P>
<P>
With the retirement of Norm Nixon, and Reggie Williams out with a sprained left 
thumb, Casey had only three guards at his disposal. One was Grant, who had a 
sore lower back after a hard fall in the fourth quarter of Wednesday night's 
loss to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
At the start, though, it didn't seem to hinder the Clippers much. After falling 
behind, 16-8, they led, 33-26, by the end of the first quarter, as Benjamin had 
11 points and seven rebounds, and Grant contributed 10 points and six assists.

<P>
The Hornets, who have held opponents to 100 or fewer points in only one of 
their last 40 games, closed the gap minutes into the second quarter. They then 
went ahead, 56-53, on Dell Curry's three-point basket from the left corner with 
one second left.

<P>
Benjamin made 10 of 11 shots in the first half for 22 points, and he also had 
12 rebounds and four blocked shots.

Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
The retirement of Norm Nixon was as much a happening as an occasion. In 
addition to the usual wishes from teammates at Friday morning's shoot-around, 
Little Richard, who grew up with Nixon's mother in Macon, Ga., also called. 
Later, after a news conference at CBS/MTM Studios in Studio City, Rev. Jesse 
Jackson, on the lot for a guest appearance on "A Different World," stopped by 
to acknowledge the event. Nixon's wife, Debbie Allen, is an executive with the 
comedy series. Nixon, who announced his retirement Thursday just 19 games short 
of completing his 10th year, did not rule out the possibility he will play 
again, maybe even this season with a team looking for some playoff insurance. 
"My heart is still in basketball," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although General Manager Elgin Baylor said no money deal was worked out that 
would allow Nixon to sign with another team, Nixon said he is a free agent 
after the Clippers agreed to buy out his contract for 1989-90 as well as pay 
him for the remainder of this season. Not that he has any immediate plans to 
play for another team, especially since it would mean leaving his family. "It 
was a relief (getting the matter settled), but I really haven't had the chance 
to think about the magnitude of what I've done," he said. "I'm in the middle of 
it. In about four days, I'll probably sit back and say, 'Damn, I retired from 
basketball.' " If he has for good, plans include managing his wife's music 
career and getting into other personal management and working in merchandising. 
"I'll be getting the same amount of playing time when I'm retired than when I 
played," he quipped, a joke aimed at his lack of playing time in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers shot 75% in the first quarter, hitting 15 of 20 shots. . . . Kurt 
Rambis, in his first appearance at the Sports Arena with Charlotte, got a big 
ovation during pregame introductions.

MICHIGAN GIVES NEW COACH A WIN

As a Michigan man coached Michigan Friday in the National Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. basketball tournament, a former Michigan man fidgeted in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Bill Frieder left. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very emotional," Frieder said later by phone from his hotel room, where 
he watched the end of the game on television as Michigan, coached by Steve 
Fisher, overcame a six-point deficit in the last 10 minutes to beat Xavier of 
Ohio, 92-87, in the first round of the Southeast Regional at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Until three days ago, Frieder was the coach of the 10th-ranked Wolverines, and 
Fisher was his No. 1 assistant. 
</P>
<P>
But when Frieder accepted an offer Wednesday to coach at Arizona State, 
Michigan Athletic Director Bo Schembechler decreed that Frieder would not coach 
the Wolverines in the NCAA tournament, as Frieder had planned. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want someone from Arizona State coaching the Michigan team," 
Schembechler said. "A Michigan man is going to coach Michigan." 
</P>
<P>
And so Frieder, who broke down Wednesday night in a tearful farewell to his 
players, watched Friday's game from afar. 
</P>
<P>
He sat about 10 rows behind the Michigan bench (and not far from Schembechler) 
with his wife, Janice, and their daughter, Laura, before he was besieged by 
reporters and autograph-seekers. 
</P>
<P>
Frieder wandered around the Omni for a while after that, he said, before 
heading back to his hotel room, leaving Janice and Laura behind. 
</P>
<P>
A great weight was lifted from his shoulders, Frieder said, when the 
third-seeded Wolverines (25-7) rallied to beat the scrappy Musketeers. Michigan 
will meet South Alabama (23-8) Sunday in a second-round game. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been a tough, tough situation for me to handle had they not 
won," Frieder said. "Now that they've won, I feel great about the whole 
situation because they're over the hump on what my situation did to them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's got to give them great confidence in Steve Fisher, who had to come from 
behind to win. So, I'm really excited about it all." 
</P>
<P>
How had the situation affected the Wolverines? 
</P>
<P>
Not much, apparently. 
</P>
<P>
They overpowered the overmatched Musketeers down the stretch after Xavier 
(21-12) had built a 71-65 lead with 9:45 left. 
</P>
<P>
"The game was there for us to steal," Xavier Coach Pete Gillen said, "but it 
slipped through our hands." 
</P>
<P>
Michigan, which got 23 points from Glen Rice and 23 points and eight assists 
from Rumeal Robinson, ultimately wore down the Musketeers. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like water torture," Gillen said. "Who would crack first? 
Unfortunately, we finally cracked a little bit and they just grabbed it." JERRY

CONGRESSIONAL CUP; 
</P>
<P>
UNBEATEN AT 7-0, DAVIS WINS FOR A RECORD THIRD TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rod Davis sailed his Catalina 38 into a slip at the Long Beach Yacht Club and 
checked his watch late Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just coming up about noon," he said. "Supposed to be coming home from the 
hospital about now." 
</P>
<P>
Davis' thoughts were on New Zealand time. He'll remember this as the week his 
head and his heart were oceans apart. 
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, his wife Liz gave birth to their second daughter in Auckland, and 
Friday Davis won the 25th Congressional Cup by outsailing Anaheim's John 
Bertrand and San Diego's Peter Isler to post an unbeatable 7-0 record. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Davis should lose both of his remaining races today and runner-up Peter 
Gilmour of Australia (5-2) win his two, Davis will receive the traditional 
crimson blazer by virtue of Thursday's win over Gilmour, the '88 champion. 
</P>
<P>
Several other sailors -- Gerry Driscoll, Argyle Campbell, Dennis Conner, Dick 
Deaver, Dennis Durgan and Dave Perry -- had won two Congressionals, but Davis 
is the first to break through with three victories -- in 1981, '85 and '89. 
</P>
<P>
His record of winning the Congressional for three different yacht clubs -- 
Newport Harbor, Long Beach and Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron -- and two 
different countries may never be challenged. 
</P>
<P>
And in case anyone is wondering, Davis affirmed that, legally, he intends to 
remain an American. 
</P>
<P>
"Definitely," he said. "To get New Zealand citizenship, you must be prepared to 
lose your U.S. citizenship -- and I'm not prepared to take the risk." 
</P>
<P>
Funny, but for a nation of fun-loving sportsmen, the Kiwis were remarkably 
reserved in victory. After beating Bertrand by 47 seconds, Davis wasn't sure he 
had clinched the title when he crossed the finish line one minute in front of 
Isler. 
</P>
<P>
There were no high fives, no cheering, no celebrating of any kind. 
</P>
<P>
"We were recounting whether Perry had lost three races," Davis said. "We hadn't 
got it all figured out yet. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's been our style from Day 1. We don't jump up and down and slap each 
other on the back. We don't do anything." 
</P>
<P>
The crew didn't even give Davis the traditional dunking at the dock. 
</P>
<P>
But, oh, how they can sail. Davis and his all-Kiwi crew placed third in the 
Nippon Cup last November, second in the World Cup of Match Racing at Fremantle 
in December and won the Chinatel Cup at Hong Kong in January to start the '89 
series of 10 match-racing events. 
</P>
<P>
Their starts all week have not been sharp -- first across the line only once in 
seven races -- but afterward they made few mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
Against Bertrand (4-3) they got off 15 seconds behind but passed the St. 
Francis Yacht Club entry near the first downwind mark and held on. 
</P>
<P>
Isler (4-3) was upset by Japan's Makoto Namba (2-5) in that same round, which 
took the punch out of a potential showdown match. 
</P>
<P>
Worse, Isler appeared to have a slight edge at the gun but had to perform a 
270-degree penalty turn ordered by the on-the-water judges for a port-starboard 
foul three minutes earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said, "I think what might have happened to Peter, he was so psyched up 
for us that he just let up a little, got behind the Japanese and guess what -- 
they can tack, they can jibe and they can sail a boat, thank you very much." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he doesn't intend to let up today with the chance of going 9-0, as 
he did in '81 and Perry did in '84. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, we want to do that. We're going to have a nice race against Perry, and I 
saw the Japanese beat Isler today. Whoo! I had never seen such a depressed crew 
when they crossed the finish line."

BRITISH CAR RENTER TO OPEN DOLLAR OFFICES; 
</P>
<P>
U.S. FIRM SAYS MOVE COULD DOUBLE REVENUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dollar Rent A Car Systems said Friday that a large British car rental firm has 
agreed to open Dollar franchises overseas and that the move will eventually 
double Dollar's revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Henry J. Caruso, president of Los Angeles-based Dollar, said Swan National Car 
Rental of London has agreed to convert its British rental car locations to the 
Dollar name and plans to open other Dollar locations at airports in France, 
West Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and several other European countries 
before the end of the year. Swan is the third-largest British rental car firm. 
</P>
<P>
Caruso predicted that Dollar's annual sales will increase to at least $800 
million from $400 million by 1992 as a result of the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
However, industry observers said Dollar, the fifth-largest car rental company 
in the United States, faces intense competition abroad. John S. Simmons, an 
analyst who follows the rental car industry for the Arnhold &amp; S. 
Bleichoeder investment firm in New York, said the two leading American car 
rental firms, Hertz and Avis, are well established in Europe and already have 
valuable tie-ins with airlines and tour operators there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Owns Half of Locations 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, Dollar must compete for European customers with more 
familiar local car rental firms. Dollar "has a formidable task ahead," Simmons 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Caruso, 65, founded Dollar in Los Angeles in 1966 by renting Volkswagens for $1 
a day, and he remains its sole owner. The company soon opened other locations 
around the state, and started its push to go national in 1967. The company now 
has 725 locations that are operated by 400 franchisees. In addition, Dollar 
owns and operates 25 other locations, mostly in California. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Swan National owns about half of its British locations, the firm's 
chairman, Freddie Aldous, said in a telephone interview. He said Swan National 
expects to own about half of the new locations it establishes under the Dollar 
name in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Aldous said Swan, with revenue of about $140 million last year, expects to move 
into continental Europe quickly by acquiring successful locally owned car 
rental companies. However, industry analysts said Aldous may find himself in a 
bidding war for prime local companies with Hertz and Avis, the largest firm in 
Europe with $1 billion in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Caruso and Aldous declined to discuss the terms of their franchise agreement, 
although Aldous said no money has yet changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a typical franchise agreement," Caruso said in a telephone interview. 
"They pay us royalties on the revenues that are generated, and they collect 
(money) from their franchisees." He said Dollar will spend "very substantial 
sums" on its European marketing effort, but he would not be specific.

A federal judge gave Apple Computer Inc. an important preliminary victory 
Friday in its legal battle with fellow computer giants Microsoft and 
Hewlett-Packard, clearing the way for a copyright suit over visual displays for 
Apple's Macintosh system. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge William Schwarzer issued a tentative ruling, which he 
affirmed by comments at an hour-long hearing, that a 1985 Apple-Microsoft 
licensing agreement did not entitle Microsoft to produce a display program 
called Windows 2.03, the target of the copyright suit. 
</P>
<P>
"Windows 2.03, the product as it is now being offered, is not covered by the 
license," Schwarzer said. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling means that Microsoft cannot claim permission from Apple to market a 
program with visual displays similar to those in the Macintosh, Apple's 
biggest-selling model. But the case is far from over. 
</P>
<P>
Apple still must prove that Windows 2.03 is "substantially similar" to the 
Macintosh menu screen graphics, distinctive for their use of pictorial symbols 
such as file drawers and wastebaskets, rather than written commands, to enter 
and use the computer system. 
</P>
<P>
Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, which uses the Windows display for a computer 
program called New Wave, contend that Apple's own program was not original but 
was derived from other companies' works. 
</P>
<P>
They also argue that the graphics Apple is trying to protect are no more than 
basic ideas, like the use of office equipment as symbols. Ideas cannot be 
copyrighted, only expressions of ideas; courts have also refused copyright 
protection when an idea can be expressed in only one way. 
</P>
<P>
The suit could have a large impact. Microsoft's program is compatible with 
International Business Machines Corp. equipment; a verdict that gave broad 
protections to Apple's "user-friendly" displays would keep similar systems off 
IBM computers and could slow the development of software for systems like 
Windows and New Wave. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's ruling knocked out Microsoft's first line of defense against the suit: 
that the 1985 licensing agreement with Apple, allowing an early version of the 
display program called Windows 1.0, was broad enough to cover a later version 
such as Windows 2.03. 
</P>
<P>
Schwarzer said his ruling was narrow and did not necessarily mean that any 
particular visual symbols, called "icons," could not be duplicated. But the 
judge indicated disagreement with a suggestion by Microsoft lawyer David 
McDonald that the copyright claim could be decided by comparing each individual 
symbol in the two programs.

Oil Prices Soar: Oil futures prices rocketed past the $20-a-barrel mark as the 
momentum that began building on Monday swept the market higher for the fifth 
consecutive day. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the April contract for 
West Texas Intermediate crude, the benchmark grade of U.S. oil, leaped 49 cents 
to a 19-month high of $20.33 a barrel in moderate trading. It was the highest 
level since Aug. 14, 1987, when crude prices were $20.57 a barrel, and capped a 
weeklong rally during which prices rose $1.83 a barrel from last Friday's close 
of $18.50.

Swissair to Start L.A. Service: Swissair announced that it will begin scheduled

passengers fast connections on routes to and from North America. They also plan 
to share reservation systems and airport facilities and to advertise their 
services jointly. But "we are not looking for a merger of our companies," 
Swissair's Chairman Armin Baltensweiler said.

PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: SIMPLE STEPS TO AVOID MUNICIPAL BOND SCAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many investors think investing in municipal bonds is safe. But thousands of 
investors nationwide are learning otherwise, falling prey to unscrupulous 
brokerage houses and sales people touting "safe" municipal bonds that in fact 
carry high default risks. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the elderly or retirees -- those who can least afford losses 
from bond defaults -- are among the prime victims. But there are some simple 
and straightforward steps you can take to avoid being taken. 
</P>
<P>
Aggressive salespeople -- often working out of small brokerage firms or 
so-called boiler room telemarketing operations -- are taking advantage of the 
growing popularity of municipal bonds, which generally pay interest that is 
exempt from federal tax and often state tax as well. Tax reform made munis one 
of the few remaining tax shelters, and thus individual investors are flocking 
to them. 
</P>
<P>
Individuals today account for about three-fourths of the $720 billion invested 
in municipal bonds. That is a far higher percentage than earlier this decade, 
when banks and other big institutions were the major buyers of munis. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the tax benefits, you'll see people who would never think of 
putting some money into stocks and bonds putting very substantial amounts into 
municipal bonds," says Scott Stapf, director of investor education for the 
North American Securities Administrators Assn., a group of state securities 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
The overwhelming majority of munis are considered sound investments and are 
bought by mutual funds, big institutions and sophisticated individual 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
But in recent years, the municipal bond market has become increasingly complex 
-- and risky. It used to be that munis were issued almost entirely in the form 
of "general obligation" bonds backed by state and local tax revenues. They were 
used to finance roads, bridges, sewers and other public infrastructure 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, many munis carry names of municipalities but in fact are not 
backed by those government entities at all. Instead, they are issued by private 
developers, corporations or other private parties to finance projects ranging 
from sports arenas to nursing homes to manufacturing facilities. Revenues to 
pay interest and principal on the bonds comes directly or indirectly from the 
project involved, rather than from the tax base of the municipality. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these so-called conduit bonds issued prior to 1986 nonetheless enjoyed 
tax-free status because municipalities -- hungry for added jobs and tax 
revenues -- lent their tax-exempt status to these projects. Tax reform in 1986 
restricted the ability of municipalities to grant tax-free status, but many 
private entities have gone ahead and issued munis anyway -- except now they may 
be taxable instead of tax-free. 
</P>
<P>
Whether taxable or tax-free, these bonds must offer higher yields to compensate 
for their higher risks. But because of their risks, "big, reputable brokerage 
firms and sophisticated investors won't touch this stuff," says C. Richard 
Lehmann, president of the Bond Investors Assn., a nationwide group based in 
Miami that tracks bond defaults. That leaves them to be marketed primarily to 
small investors. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, some salespeople and brokerages specializing in underwriting and 
selling these bonds -- and earning enormous fees and commissions -- fail to 
adequately disclose the risks involved. Some marketers have even been claiming 
that these bonds are as safe as Treasury bills or bank certificates of deposit 
-- when in fact investors can lose on average as much as 50 cents on the dollar 
if these bonds default. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a small Jackson, Miss., brokerage firm, Buchanan &amp; Co., 
recently shut down amid investigations by regulators from at least four states. 
Investigators found that of 137 bond issues that the firm had underwritten or 
sold since 1982, at least 64 have defaulted. More than $400 million of bonds 
were involved in the failures. But investors -- mostly elderly and retired -- 
were told these bonds were "99% safe" and "second only to government bonds in 
security," investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
Californians have not been major victims of these scams yet, but they 
nonetheless should be aware of the potential for problems, says G. William 
McDonald, enforcement chief for the state Department of Corporations, which 
regulates securities brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
Overall default rates on municipals have been rising nationwide, with some 140 
issues with a value of $1.24 billion defaulting in 1987 and a similar number 
expected for 1988 when all totals are in, says Lehmann of the Bond Investors 
Assn. The 1987 figure exceeded the total number of bond failures for the entire 
period between 1972 and 1983, the bond group says. Most of the defaults have 
been among the conduit bonds issued by private entities. 
</P>
<P>
Compounding the problem is the fact that municipal bonds are far less regulated 
than stocks or corporate bonds. Little disclosure is required of issuers; for 
many issues there is no prospectus or statement of any kind laying out 
pertinent information. Issuers also are not required to file quarterly or 
annual reports detailing the status of their projects. 
</P>
<P>
"You could be buying a defaulted bond and not even know it," Lehmann says. 
</P>
<P>
Munis "remain perhaps the single least regulated and most ill-understood 
investment instrument that is likely to end up in the portfolio of a typical 
investor," say the North American Securities Administrators Assn. and the 
Better Business Bureau in a recent statement. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very easy even for an investor with some sophistication to make a 
mistake" investing in munis, says Stapf of the state securities group. He cites 
the example of the thousands of institutions and individuals who lost money in 
the record $2.25-billion default of the Washington Public Power Supply System 
(better known at Whoops). 
</P>
<P>
The problem of inadequate disclosure has caught the eye of the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. Last year, it proposed new rules that would increase 
disclosure on municipal bond issues exceeding $10 million in total value. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, however, the riskiest bonds today are issued in blocks that fall 
below the $10-million threshold. While bond issues exceeding $10 million 
accounted for 86% of the dollar volume of all bonds issued last year, they 
accounted for only 1,743 of the 6,972 individual bond financings. It is 
precisely these smaller issues that are most likely to be promoted to small 
investors, Stapf says. 
</P>
<P>
The problem of risky bonds being sold to investors without adequate disclosure 
also extends into popular unit investment trusts, Stapf says. Unit investment 
trusts, like mutual funds, allow investors to buy a piece of a portfolio of 
bonds, earning a share of the interest payments. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of these trusts are sound investments and are marketed by 
reputable firms. But some unscrupulous marketers -- earning generous 
commissions and fees -- have been placing high-risk munis into these portfolios 
in order to boost yields and make them more attractive to investors. 
</P>
<P>
"But they go without telling investors that they are getting riskier and 
riskier bonds," Stapf says. 
</P>
<P>
Further, some of these marketers of unit trusts also underwrote the bonds -- a 
potential conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Stapf adds that unit trusts historically are promoted to elderly and retirees. 
"That magnifies the concern about the potential for damage. The investors are 
not your typical yuppies." 
</P>
<P>
How can you avoid being taken in shaky muni bond investments? Here are some 
suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
* Be wary of any investments pitched over the phone by strangers. Thanks to 
lenient regulations, Little Rock, Ark., has become a haven for many boiler room 
operations pitching high-risk munis. But they hawk their wares nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
* Get all performance-related claims in writing from a broker. Act only on 
those promises that a broker is willing to commit to paper. 
</P>
<P>
* Learn about the basics of a municipal bond before investing. Where will the 
revenues come from to service the bonds? Where will the proceeds go, and what 
portion will go to lawyers, financial consultants and developers in hefty fees? 
What is the financial condition of the issuer, and what are the economic 
prospects for its project? 
</P>
<P>
Also important to ask: Who is going to make a market in the bond if I need to 
sell it? Some smaller bond issues are so thinly traded that it may be hard to 
resell them at a price close to their face or market value. 
</P>
<P>
* If you can't tolerate losses, consider investing in bonds with insurance to 
protect against losses through default. Lehmann of the bond investors group 
says bond insurance will generally cost you about a half a percentage point of 
yield. "But for most people it's worth it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
* Consider investing in municipal bonds through reputable mutual fund 
companies. Many also offer high-yield municipal bond funds, but you can rely on 
the professional expertise of the portfolio manager to sort out the junk from 
the quality.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: IRS RULES MURKY ON OPTIONS SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: You recently discussed how the Internal Revenue Service depends on 
Form 1099 reports from stockbrokers to keep track of stock sales by taxpayers. 
My broker does file those forms for my stock sales, but he does not report my 
dealings in stock options. Does this mean that the IRS has no record of these 
trades? -- G. B. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Yes, so it would appear. But just because the IRS doesn't require 
brokers to report options trades, this doesn't relieve you of your 
responsibility to report these transactions on your income tax return. 
</P>
<P>
According to our experts, the issue you raise is one of the many murky areas -- 
one Wall Street attorney called it a "quirky quagmire" -- in the tax codes that 
has defied all attempts at clarification. And until the IRS issues new 
guidelines, most brokerage houses are not reporting stock option sales. 
</P>
<P>
Here's some background: Internal Revenue Code Section 60.45 and accompanying 
regulations 1.6045-1(a) 9, do not include options among the types of assets 
whose sale must be reported to the IRS. The reason, brokers say, is that the 
IRS recognizes that it is often next to impossible to isolate the profits and 
losses generated by a single options trade since it is often made as part of 
another transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Further, since all reporting is now handled by computer, any reporting system 
would require an easily completed form. The problem is that such a form would 
probably not accommodate the complex transactions that option sales usually 
involve. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to come up with workable reporting systems," says one 
securities attorney. But another attorney jokes: "The IRS is smart enough to 
know that no one ever really makes any money on options." 
</P>
<P>
The IRS says only that its current regulations do not cover option trades and 
that, while it is always possible that the agency will issue new regulations, 
no revisions in this area are in the works. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I think I have lost two Series EE bonds. How do I find out for sure? Can 
they be replaced? -- J. C. C. 
</P>
<P>
A: Your local branch of the Federal Reserve Bank can help you. The tracing 
service, which covers all Series E, EE and HH bonds, is free and takes about a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
The process is easiest if you have the serial numbers of the bonds that you 
believe are lost. You probably do not have these serial numbers. Don't worry. 
Help is still available. 
</P>
<P>
You must provide the name and address of the bondholder, the Social Security 
number under which the bonds are held, the denomination of the bonds and, if 
possible, the month and year of their issuance. Researchers will trace the 
bonds by the Social Security number of the holder and provide you with the 
serial numbers of the bonds that have already been redeemed and those still 
outstanding. You may also ask for photocopies of all bonds issued to you. 
</P>
<P>
To get duplicate bonds, ask your local Federal Reserve Bank for a "lost bond 
claim" form. Complete it and return it to the enclosed address. You will 
shortly receive a duplicate. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the Federal Reserve Bank is located at 950 S. Grand Ave. 
Address all correspondence to the bank to P.O. Box 2077, Terminal Annex, Los 
Angeles, Calif. 90051. Savings bond inquires should be directed to the 
"savings" office. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am 56 years old and am taking early retirement from my job. If I receive a 
lump-sum distribution from my pension plan and immediately roll it over into an 
individual retirement account, may I immediately begin drawing an annual 
disbursement without penalty, just as if I were age 59 1/2? -- W. C. 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, you may. The Internal Revenue Service will waive the 10% early 
withdrawal penalty from IRAs under one circumstance: The amount of the 
disbursements you take must be calculated according to the life expectancy 
tables for your age -- 56 in your case -- not that of a 59 1/2-year-old, the 
age at which withdrawals are otherwise allowed to begin. 
</P>
<P>
According to the latest tables, the life expectancy of a 56-year-old person is 
27.7 years; for a 59 1/2-year-old, it's 25 years. To calculate your annual 
disbursement, divide the total balance in all of your IRA accounts by your life 
expectancy -- or, if you want, your life expectancy and that of the 
beneficiary, or beneficiaries, of your IRA accounts. Once you reach age 59 1/2, 
you may withdraw more funds from your IRA accounts without penalty -- but never 
less than the life expectancy amount. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I was forced to close my 10-year-old dry cleaning and Laundromat business 
because the building where I was renting was severely damaged during the 
October, 1987, earthquake in Los Angeles. The building is still uninhabitable, 
but it may eventually be brought up to code. My equipment was not damaged by 
the quake, but best estimates are that the boiler will not function after such 
a long period of non-use. The rest of my equipment is so old that it has no 
sale value. I have virtually abandoned my business and have had to find other 
employment. Is there anything I can do on my taxes? -- J. T. W. 
</P>
<P>
A: Our experts studied the facts you provided and concluded that you have 
little, if any, recourse with the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, your ability to deduct losses stemming from the earthquake is 
limited to any actual physical losses you suffered, such as damaged or 
destroyed equipment. And your deductions are further limited by the extent to 
which you have already depreciated this equipment. By your own account, the 
equipment was not actually damaged. Further, even it it had been damaged, given 
its age, you may already have fully depreciated it. 
</P>
<P>
You might think that you would be allowed to claim the loss of the "goodwill" 
-- the value of a business above and beyond its actual assets -- that your 
business built up over the years. However, unless you bought the business from 
someone else and actually paid for this goodwill, the IRS does not recognize it 
as an asset that can be damaged. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, if you did have deductable losses, the time to claim them was last 
year. Now you would have to file an amended return for 1987, the year in which 
the earthquake occurred.

Vons Cos.: The El Monte-based grocery chain, which last fall bought the 
Southern California Safeway stores, reported a net loss for 1988 of $23.9 
million, compared with pro forma net income of $1.6 million the year before. 
The company said the loss included $11.9 million in costs associated with its 
purchase and remodeling of the Safeway locations. Sales for the year rose 21.4% 
to $3.9 million. Operating income declined to $49.4 million from a pro forma 
figure of $67.5 million a year ago, the company said, reflecting costs 
associated with the Safeway purchase, liability insurance and workers' 
compensation and implementation of a price reduction policy in the first 
quarter.

ARMORED CAR GUARD SLAIN AT MARKET; 
</P>
<P>
GUNMAN TURNS PISTOL ON HIMSELF AS DEPUTIES CLOSE IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELE FUETSCH and CHRIS WOODYARD, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An armored car guard was gunned down at a busy Lakewood supermarket Friday by a 
robber who then turned his pistol on himself as sheriff's deputies closed in. 
</P>
<P>
The scene unfolded at mid-morning as about 20 shoppers and employees of the 
Vons market looked on in horror, then ducked to the floor at the sound of the 
gunfire. As the gunman appeared in the store's glass-enclosed breezeway, the 
guard's partner -- locked safely in the armored car just outside -- frantically 
beeped the horn as a warning. 
</P>
<P>
But as his partner swung around holding a sack of cash and store receipts, the 
robber opened fire, according to a spokesman for the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Store Surrounded 
</P>
<P>
Deputies from the Lakewood station, only a block away, quickly surrounded the 
market and began to move in. But the gunman, apparently seeing there was no 
escape, shot himself in the head. 
</P>
<P>
The slain guard, John Allen Stoddart, 25, of Santa Ana, was the third employee 
of Armored Transport of California in Los Angeles to die in a holdup since 
October. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, who died shortly after being taken to the hospital, has not been 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
Stoddart, who had worked for only a year at Armored Transport, was approached 
by the robber, his gun drawn, as he was making his way out of the store about 
9:45 a.m., according to sheriff's investigators. The store in the 4000 block of 
Hardwick Street is across from the Lakewood Center Mall. 
</P>
<P>
When the shooting started, the investigators said, Stoddart managed to get off 
two shots and wound the robber before he was shot and killed. 
</P>
<P>
"Witnesses inside the store began screaming that the suspect was reloading," 
Sheriff's Deputy Sam Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Before deputies could enter the store, the suspect put his pistol to his head 
and shot himself, Jones said. "It appears the suspect acted alone," he said. 
Deputies, however, brought a canine unit into the store shortly after the 
shooting to search for other suspects. none were found. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as the shooting erupted, people started to flee outside, said Merlyn 
Haase, an electrician who was working in the back of the supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
Liz Bowden, who works at a dry cleaners next to the supermarket, heard screams 
and gunshots coming from inside and said she "thought it was an explosion. 
</P>
<P>
"I locked up the store right away," she said. "You're not safe anywhere 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Two saleswomen from a nearby dress shop also heard the shots. One of them, Kay 
Wiser, said that "there was a series of pops, like an automatic" weapon being 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
A Vons employee, who asked not to be identified, said the store, which opened 
six years ago, has been robbed twice. A Vons spokeswoman, Mary McAboy, said 
this is the first time there has been an armored car robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies found the robber's car -- a green jacket and a box of 
ammunition under the passenger's seat -- parked behind the shopping center. The 
rust-colored Cadillac had been reported stolen in Redondo Beach on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Larue Quiznell, 61, owner of the stolen Cadillac, said in a telephone interview 
that her car was taken from the parking lot of a Vons market near her home in 
Redondo Beach by a light-haired male with a "Joe College" appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Quiznell said that as she was getting into her car after grocery shopping 
Monday, the man, whom she described as about 25 years old and 6 feet tall, 
walked up to her and asked her the time. 
</P>
<P>
But while she was putting bags of groceries into the back seat of her car, the 
man pulled a pistol, pointed it at her and said, "I really need your car bad." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how long I stood there," Quiznell said. "Then he told me, 'I 
could blow your head off,' and my keys went right to him." 
</P>
<P>
She said she knew her stolen car was found before investigators had the chance 
to tell her. 
</P>
<P>
"My sister saw it on TV," Quiznell said. 
</P>
<P>
At his Placentia home, James Stoddart, the dead armored car guard's father, 
said he and his wife worried when their son took the job. 
</P>
<P>
"He really liked this job, " Stoddart said. "We were a little concerned for 
him. I expected the worst. I'm that kind of person. So I wasn't surprised (upon 
hearing of his death)." 
</P>
<P>
"His mom even suggested we buy him a bulletproof vest," Stoddart said. "I knew 
he wouldn't have worn it. We should have done it anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Guards typically work in pairs, one staying in the armored car at all times, 
while the other gets out at each of the stops, which number anywhere from 70 to 
100 a day. Guards are instructed that, no matter what happens outside the 
armored car, the guard inside is never to leave the vehicle.

 3 CHARGED IN DEATH AT DAY-CARE HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A couple who ran an unlicensed Lomita day-care home and their 19-year-old 
daughter were charged Friday with felony child endangerment and with violating 
the state's Health and Safety Code in connection with the strangulation death 
last November of a 16-month-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
Robert and Linda Zieger and their daughter Laura were arrested shortly after 
the Nov. 14 death of Michele Heasley, who was one of seven small children being 
cared for at the Zieger home. 
</P>
<P>
All three Ziegers have been free on $3,000 bail during an investigation by the 
district attorney's office and Sheriff's Department. They are scheduled to be 
arraigned Tuesday in South Bay Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Zieger, 48, and Linda Zieger, 47, were reached by phone Friday but 
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators reported that the family routinely cared for about half a dozen 
children at their home on West 262nd Street, although they were not licensed by 
the state Department of Social Services. 
</P>
<P>
Laura Zieger told paramedics that she was at home alone with the seven children 
when she found the girl not breathing, about an hour after she had left her 
napping in a bedroom. Doctors at Torrance Memorial Hospital Medical Center said 
they found abrasions on the girl's neck, indicating that she may have been 
strangled. 
</P>
<P>
The county coroner's office ruled the death a homicide, but Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Rod Leonard said Friday that there is no evidence to charge the Ziegers, or 
anyone else, with murder.

 MOLOTOV COCKTAIL STARTS FIRE, INJURES 3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gang members lobbed a Molotov cocktail into a South Los Angeles house early 
Friday, injuring three people, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A woman in her 50s and a young man and woman escaped with minor smoke 
inhalation in the attack, which occurred about 1 a.m. when a carload of 
suspected gang members threw the device through the window of a house in the 
5400 block of 2nd Avenue, police and fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects had first sprayed the house with gunfire before tossing the fire 
bomb, Sgt. Ed Wilson said. A resulting fire caused about $29,000 in damage to 
the house, City Fire spokesman Jim Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests were made, and the exact motivation in the attack was not known.

 LESBIAN LOVER WINS ROUND ON CUSTODY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman will be allowed to seek joint custody of her former female lover's 
daughter, who was born during their lesbian relationship, a Los Angeles 
Superior Court judge has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
"It's exciting that a person who is not a natural biological parent can proceed 
in a same-sex relationship case," said attorney Gloria Allred, who is 
representing the mother's former lover, Terri Sabol. 
</P>
<P>
After a closed session with attorneys for Sabol and the mother, who has not 
been identified, Superior Court Commissioner James Endman allowed the custody 
case to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
Endman ruled that if a nonparent can be ordered to pay child support, then a 
nonparent should be allowed to seek custody of a child.

 DEFENDANT ATTACKS BAILIFF, PROSECUTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minutes after being convicted of robbery Thursday, a defendant went berserk in 
a Long Beach courtroom, exchanging punches with a bailiff and a prosecutor 
before being subdued, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred shortly after a Superior Court jury found Blas Gonzalez 
Salazar, 30, guilty of armed robbery for the hold-up of a fast-food restaurant 
in Wilmington that netted $26 last October. 
</P>
<P>
As the jury was filing out of the court, "the defendant went crazy, berserk, 
nutso," said Andy Reynolds, a spokesman for the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
He said Salazar began exchanging punches with Bailiff John Krino, who was 
trying to subdue him. Deputy Dist. Atty. James Slevin entered the fray and also 
exchanged punches with the defendant, Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
Other bailiffs arrived in the court and subdued Salazar, who was then taken 
into a lockup area. Slevin and Krino both received minor injuries.

A shadowy, extreme-rightist group using a Latin name is stalking prominent 
Israelis who support dialogue with the PLO, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Sicarii, who take their name from Jewish zealots who murdered collaborators 
with the Romans in ancient times, claimed responsibility for an arson attack 
Thursday on the home of broadcaster Dan Margalit. 
</P>
<P>
They also tried to burn the home of a relative of leftist parliamentarian Yair 
Tsaban in the same building. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone call to an Israeli newspaper, a man claiming to speak for the 
group said: "We blew up the apartments of Dan Margalit and Yair Tsaban -- may 
they be wiped off the face of the Earth -- because Margalit invited Faisal 
Husseini to appear on TV and because Tsaban met with the PLO abroad." Husseini 
is a prominent Palestinian in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
The attacks caused slight damage and no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
They were the latest in a spate of arson attacks and threats against leading 
Israeli doves.

The government filed suit Friday charging Cerro Copper Products Co. of Sauget, 
Ill., with massive violations of the Clean Water Act in the discharge of toxic 
waste water that allegedly has polluted the Mississippi River. 
</P>
<P>
An Environmental Protection Agency spokeswoman said the maximum penalties 
sought exceed $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department suit also sought a court injunction to halt the 
discharges. The suit charged that the copper processing facility has flouted 
three EPA regulations, dating from 1984, requiring pre-treatment of its 
discharges of copper, chromium, lead, nickel, zinc and total toxic organics.

AMERICANS SPOKE THEIR MINDS IN 4-DAY 'SUMMIT' AT THE VATICAN;

<P>
LACK OF CLOUT IN VATICAN PUTS U.S. CHURCH AT A DISADVANTAGE 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pope John Paul II excused himself briefly from a meeting last week with 
American archbishops to accept the credentials of the new Ethiopian ambassador 
to the Holy See, and to deliver a 3,000-word speech of encouragement to six 
visiting Chilean bishops. 
</P>
<P>
During John Paul's four days with the Americans, the gigantic institution he 
heads announced a major economic reform package and proclaimed a breakthrough 
for religious freedom in Lithuania. As the American bishops headed home, the 
Pope met with 7,000 relatives of Italian missionaries and visited a Roman 
parish. While the returning American prelates prepared for a press conference 
in Washington, he was receiving bishops from Burkina Faso and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
As the papal focus shifts away from the extraordinary meeting with American 
church leaders, it is left to the Vatican bureaucracy to follow up on the 
issues. Veteran Vatican observers say that over the next few months the 
church's Curia, or administrative arm, will seek to accentuate trends already 
under way to assert greater central authority over the maverick Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Some Curia moves will be apparent and others unseen, the observers believe, but 
all will come in the context of the way the Vatican views the 
independent-minded American church. 
</P>
<P>
As seen by the European-dominated Curia, the church in the United States is 
both wealthy and important -- often lamentably so -- as an international trend 
setter. It is, to be sure, large, with 53 million members. But it is also 
small: It amounts to only 6% of the world's Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
In asserting its positions against Vatican traditions of patient jockeying and 
unwavering respect for hierarchical authority, the observers say, the American 
church will be at a disadvantage because of its disproportionately weak clout 
at the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Power 
</P>
<P>
One ailing American cardinal heads the Vatican equivalent of a ministry. Three 
American bishops direct lesser dependencies, but the most powerful among them, 
the head of the Vatican banks, is being ousted. 
</P>
<P>
The scarcity of Americans within the Curia to translate the peculiarities of 
their outspoken countrymen to the glacial Vatican bureaucracy contributes to 
the mutual cultural incomprehension that was the hallmark of the summit, the 
observers believe. 
</P>
<P>
"America is a 'marketplace society' where ideas have to sell themselves on an 
intrinsic merit. That this would conflict at times with the hierarchical nature 
of the church is not surprising," noted St. Louis Archbishop John L. May, 
president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath, issues that triggered brotherly differences of opinion at the 
meeting will likely be the focus of Vatican housekeeping initiatives, the 
observers believe. The sources, who requested anonymity, expect the Vatican to 
seek: 
</P>
<P>
* A more rigorous selection of American bishops to assure support for basic 
doctrines such as the Vatican ban on contraception. The Vatican believes that 
some of the current bishops may be better administrators than pastors. It is 
also concerned about what it considers the theological inadequacy of some of 
them. Although cardinals and bishops are expected to have advanced degrees in 
some theological sciences, many American prelates lack them. Theological 
expertise will weigh more heavily in a selection of future bishops and 
cardinals, the Vatican observers believe. 
</P>
<P>
* A tighter rein on theologians to ensure orthodoxy. Vatican critics blame 
iconoclastic Catholic theologians unchecked by their bishops for divisive 
crosscurrents within the American church. The Vatican has made clear that it 
will not tolerate theological dissent on central issues and expects the bishops 
to correct theological aberrations. In recent years, the Vatican believes, some 
American bishops have virtually ceded teaching authority to their theologians. 
The Vatican wants that stopped. The bishop, above all, says the Pope, must 
himself be a teacher and must know what he is talking about. 
</P>
<P>
* Better theological and philosophical preparation in American seminaries. 
There is no controversy on this point: Americans and Curia cardinals agree with 
professors at church universities here and in the United States that American 
seminarians are generally far behind their European peers in philosophical 
preparation. 
</P>
<P>
* A slowdown in the granting of marriage annulments. American marriage 
tribunals grant about 75% of the annulments worldwide, a figure that sticks in 
the craw of a Curia foursquare behind the indissolubility of marriage. The 
American bishops vigorously defended their tribunals at the summit but in the 
process invited greater Vatican inspection of their operations. 
</P>
<P>
If he is distressed by some of what he finds in the American church, and by the 
materialistic society in which it preaches, there is also a lot that John Paul 
admires about the dynamism of American Catholicism. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it is but one church among many churches in a global constituency of 850 
million Catholics. And, as Vatican loyalists are quick to note, John Paul has 
equal responsibility for all of the churches, and all of the people. Indeed, 
one of the most challenging parts of the Pope's job is that he must teach 
different things to different peoples with equal authority. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unyielding Preacher 
</P>
<P>
For some Americans and Europeans, John Paul may seem principally a stern 
disciplinarian, a moralist supreme and an unyielding preacher of unpopular 
doctrines. Simultaneously, though, he is an outspoken crusader, the poor man's 
friend who demands decent living standards for African peasants, social justice 
for Brazilian slum dwellers, with freedom of worship for Lithuanian 
shipbuilders, and an end to racism everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
That this Polish Pope of all the Catholics has reservations about some 
practices of the American church, so rich, so free, is more predictable than 
exceptional; so, too, that the bishop of Rome and the heir of St. Peter will 
strive relentlessly to put his house in the order he prescribes.

N.Y.'S SHANNON INVADES L.A. RADIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Westwood One's $54-million gamble in the hotly competitive Los Angeles radio 
market went on the air at 5:03 a.m. Friday. "Pirate Radio" KQLZ-FM (100.3), 
featuring a mix of classic hard rock, Top 40 and dance music, ended the 16-year 
reign of KIQQ-FM, which for the past three years had been calling itself K-LITE 
Radio. 
</P>
<P>
With KQLZ and the premium price it paid to buy the station from Outlet 
Communications, Westwood One has entered the Los Angeles ratings race in a 
bombastic way. Westwood One president Norman Pattiz hired New York's top 
morning deejay, Scott Shannon, to program and staff his new station. 
</P>
<P>
Shannon, who will act as morning drive-time deejay as well as KQLZ's programmer 
and a Westwood One vice president, denied reports that his contract with the 
company is worth $15 million initially, but did say that it could be worth that 
much if the station is successful. 
</P>
<P>
"Ladies and gentlemen, at this time K-LITE signs off the air forever," said an 
announcer who recommended that easy-listening music fans tune to four other Los 
Angeles FM stations: KTWV (94.7), KJOI (98.7), KSRF (103.1) and KOST (103.5) 
</P>
<P>
With that, K-LITE / KIQQ played its last soft hit: the 1958 chestnut "The End" 
sung by Earl Grant. 
</P>
<P>
"The staff and management of KIQQ were proud to serve you," the announcer said 
as KIQQ left the air. 
</P>
<P>
Following a two-minute sound mix featuring several of the legendary voices of 
Los Angeles pop radio (B. Mitchell Reed, the Real Don Steele, Dave Diamond), a 
dramatic voice proclaimed: 
</P>
<P>
"And now, ladies and gentlemen, the beat goes on . . . roll tape. You are about 
to witness the birth of a brand-new radio station. It's 5:03 a.m. KQLZ signs on 
the air for the very first time. Signing on the air, this is the all new 
KQLZ-FM Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Southern California, it's time to wake up. The mother ship has landed: Pirate 
Radio 100.3. Welcome to the jungle." 
</P>
<P>
Following the Guns N' Roses hit of that name, the new station's second 
selection was, appropriately, "Start Me Up" by the Rolling Stones. 
</P>
<P>
KQLZ is the second station bought by Culver City-based Westwood One, the 
nation's largest supplier of syndicated radio programming. The company also 
bought New York City's only country and Western station last year. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the "Pirate Radio" gimmick, the station is temporarily broadcasting 
from the back of a Westwood One warehouse, complete with "Pirate Radio" 
scrawled over the control console where Shannon and other KQLZ deejays do their 
announcing. In keeping with the "all-new" concept, no deejays currently on the 
air in the Los Angeles market have been hired to man the KQLZ mikes. 
</P>
<P>
Shannon will hold down the 6 to 10 a.m. slot, followed by former San Diego 
deejay Whitney Allen from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., with Shadow Steele, from New 
Orleans, taking over at 3 p.m. At 7 p.m., Atlanta deejay "Domino" takes the 
microphone, followed by former Oxnard deejay Jimmy Page at 11 p.m. The 
overnight shift from 2 to 6 a.m. features "Bubba the Love Monkey," described by 
Shannon as "an unemployed guy from Odessa, Texas." 
</P>
<P>
The station's general manager is Simon T, who comes to KQLZ from KCBQ-FM in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called "Morning Zoo" comedy repertory format that made his station in 
New York, Z-100, the most popular outlet on the East Coast, will not be 
duplicated at KQLZ, Shannon said. 
</P>
<P>
The new station was originally scheduled to go on the air in early April, but 
Pattiz and Shannon decided to surprise the competition with their new format 
Friday in order to put competing morning drive-time personalities off balance. 
Several already had taken pre-emptive measures, however. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles' top-rated rock station, KPWR-FM (105.9), recently adopted 
Shannon's "Morning Zoo" name for its morning drive-time crew, headed by 
deejay/actor Jay Thomas. Several other "Zoo" gimmicks and gags pioneered by 
Shannon in New York, such as "the juke box from hell" and a "worst-to-first" 
contest, have been implemented by rival stations, most notably the No. 2 
station in Los Angeles, KIIS-FM (102.7). 
</P>
<P>
"We're programming the two top-rated radio stations in Los Angeles and we're 
not even on the air yet," said Shannon, referring to the "Morning Zoo" gimmicks 
that he pioneered and that are now being used on KIIS and KPWR. 
</P>
<P>
KPWR's Thomas told The Times that he welcomes Shannon's competition, while KIIS 
deejay Rick Dees, the longtime morning ratings champ, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
"There's enough (audience) out there for everybody," said KLSX-FM (97.1) 
morning man Peter Tilden. 
</P>
<P>
KIQQ became the third station in as many weeks to change its call letters. Last 
week, KMPC-FM (101.9) became KEDG "The Edge," though it kept its same on-air 
personalities and album rock format. Two weeks ago, KNX-FM (93.1) dropped its 
call letters, most of its deejays and its progressive rock format in favor of 
an oldies rock format. The new station is known as KODJ-FM. 
</P>
<P>
KQLZ's "Pirate Radio" concept is taken from the renegade broadcast tradition 
dating back more than 20 years, when ships in the North Sea transmitted rock 
'n' roll into the British Isles from international waters where the British 
government had no jurisdiction over what could be broadcast. More recently, a 
pair of pirate stations popped up off Long Island in New York until the Federal 
Communications Commission tracked them down and forced them off the air. 
</P>
<P>
Westwood One's Pattiz is not so ingenuous as to try to pass off his new 
$54-million station as shoestring radio, but he does maintain that KQLZ has the 
unsafe overtones of an experimental operation. 
</P>
<P>
Pattiz said Westwood One will be using its satellite, SatCom 1R, to send the 
KQLZ signal out nationally to affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
"This thing is really going to evolve," he said. "Everybody expects us to go 
Top 40, but that's not what we're going to be. It'll have a harder edge to it. 
It hasn't been done significantly anywhere else. This will not just be 
attracting listeners from KIIS and Power (KPWR), but KLSX, KLOS and everybody 
else on the dial too." 
</P>
<P>
Ten minutes before he signed off, K-LITE overnight deejay Gary Butterworth 
wished his audience an enjoyable Friday and played the last K-LITE promotional 
insert: 
</P>
<P>
"K-LITE: The station everybody at work can agree on."

COMIC RELIEF GETS YUKS -- AND BUCKS

<P>
Four years after Band Aid, Live Aid, Hands Across America and USA for Africa 
rewrote the rules for celebrity-studded pop charity events, the causes they 
championed persist: African pestilence and famine are still claiming 4 million 
young lives a year and America's 3 million homeless remain homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the pop charities themselves, however, have vanished from the public 
spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
Except for Comic Relief. 
</P>
<P>
"Who would have ever thought that the last guys doing it would be the 
comedians?" said Bob Zmuda, president and co-founder of the organization 
sponsoring tonight's all-star comedy revue for the nation's homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Plans are already in the works for a Comic Relief show next year in New York, 
even before this year's four-hour laugh-a-thon goes on the air tonight from the 
Universal Amphitheater. It will air at 9 p.m. on HBO. 
</P>
<P>
Hosted by Billy Crystal, Robin Williams and Whoopi Goldberg, the annual event 
features many of the country's top comics in stand-up routines, sitcom skits 
and production numbers sandwiched between pleas for donations to help the 
homeless. Pledge donations and ticket proceeds are used to underwrite 19 
medical care projects throughout the country. HBO picks up the production tab. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons they're able to tell people over the air that 100% of their 
pledge will go to help the homeless is because HBO underwrites it," said 
Michael Cousineau, executive director of the Los Angeles Health Care for the 
Homeless project that has directly benefitted from Comic Relief I ($77,000) and 
II ($150,000). "HBO gets a lot in terms of publicity, but it's a tradeoff that 
works." 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the first two Comic Reliefs took in about $4.7 million and 
distributed it to the 19 medical projects, which, in turn, used the money to 
aid an estimated 150,000 homeless people in need of medical attention, 
according to Comic Relief's annual report. 
</P>
<P>
Comic Relief's careful planning has also insured its longevity, said Cousineau. 
The organization's officials have learned from the mistakes of other pop 
charities. Because Comic Relief knew before its very first show exactly how the 
proceeds would be distributed, for example, all the money raised during the 
program was paid out to health care centers within six months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Cousineau said, organizers of the 1986 pop charity event Hands 
Across America spent nearly half of every dollar contributed on overhead and 
did not get the remaining money fully distributed to the homeless until as long 
as a year after the event. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a little bit of money from Hands Across America," said Cousineau. "But 
Comic Relief has kept us going." 
</P>
<P>
At least 6,000 homeless men, women and children have received medication, care 
and counseling at the Los Angeles center as a direct result of Comic Relief, 
Cousineau said. An additional 20,000 have benefitted indirectly because the 
Comic Relief grant encouraged matching grants from other groups, such as the 
Ahmanson and Parsons Foundations in Los Angeles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Comic Relief III is sold out at the amphitheater, with all $400,000 in ticket 
revenue earmarked for the homeless, according to Comic Relief's vice president, 
Dennis Albaugh. 
</P>
<P>
The show will open with an extravagant musical dance number, according to 
Zmuda, choreographed to the tune of Comic Relief's 1989 theme song: "Don't Be a 
Greedy Bastard." 
</P>
<P>
"It's got lyrics like 'Those Yuppie days are over and gone, it's time to throw 
away the Perrier and Grey Poupon,' " Zmuda said. 
</P>
<P>
The show itself will feature between 35 and 40 acts and could last as long as 
four and a quarter hours, he said. Among the personalities who have agreed to 
appear are John Cleese, Goldie Hawn, Fred Savage, Bob Newhart, Joe Flaherty, 
Martin Short, Charlton Heston, Doc Severinson, Garry Shandling, Jamie Lee 
Curtis and Shelley Long. 
</P>
<P>
There are some notable absences from the roster, such as Eddie Murphy and Bill 
Cosby, arguably the two best-known comedians in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why they don't join in," said HBO's Chris Albrecht, who has 
overseen the show's production since the first Comic Relief in 1986. "Some of 
them can't do it but some of them just won't do it." 
</P>
<P>
Next year, when Comic Relief IV opens at Radio City Music Hall, Albrecht hopes 
to lure some of those reluctant comedians into the Comic Relief "family." He 
also hopes to land a national sponsor to help underwrite the organization.

CHORALE'S ROBERT JONES TO LEAVE POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Willoughby Jones, executive director of the Los Angeles Master Chorale, 
confirmed Friday that he is leaving his post when his contract expires June 30. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of differences in management and musical philosophy, I will be leaving 
the Los Angeles Master Chorale by mutual agreement," Jones said in a prepared 
statement. He has been chief administrator at the Master Chorale since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott Brown, president of the L.A. Master Chorale Assn., said Jones' departure 
was the result of "a number of different points of view concerning the 
direction of the chorale, which we have been discussing in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at long-range planning consistent with the long-range plans of 
the Music Center, at alternative directions for the chorale, and also at our 
organization's overall structure," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the chorale was "in sound financial condition." 
</P>
<P>
"We have had a good financial year," he said. "We are going to conclude the 
season on budget, or even better." 
</P>
<P>
John Currie, the organization's music director since 1986 -- Jones was 
instrumental in bringing the conductor here from Scotland -- was not available 
for comment. DANIEL CARIAGA

ART MAGAZINE TO TRACK TRENDS ON PACIFIC RIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN TAYLOR, Taylor is a student at USC and a Calendar intern. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reflecting a significant interest in art trends in the Pacific Rim, Artcoast, a 
new contemporary art magazine was launched this month. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine hit the stands on Monday and publisher Bob Crothers is already 
worried about running out of stock. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe it. Copies are flying off the shelves and we've had to 
reorder," Crothers said. 
</P>
<P>
Crothers attributed the success to curiosity over what Artcoast is all about. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole idea behind our coverage is to start in Los Angeles and then look 
around us -- to Japan, Australia and other Pacific Rim countries," Aaron 
Betsky, managing editor, said. 
</P>
<P>
"Artcoast recognizes the need for diversity and contradiction," said Charles 
Scheips, associate publisher of the bi-monthly magazine. (In January, 1990, it 
is scheduled to begin monthly publication.) 
</P>
<P>
"We also recognize that California is the center of changing boundaries 
affecting the art world," he added. "We are not a regional magazine and not 
about Los Angeles art. We want to expose ideas and trends in a nonconventional 
manner." 
</P>
<P>
Editor Kay Larson, longtime art writer for New York magazine, said in the new 
magazine's opening statement: "The articles and reviews will emphasize visual 
culture and also be concerned with traditional aesthetics of European and 
American art, broadly defined through paintings, sculptures, performance, 
street art, photography, books and any other kind of creative works that seem 
appealing. "In short, anything goes -- if it's good enough," said Larson. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine will feature museum and gallery reviews from Los Angeles, San 
Francisco, Seattle, Portland, Hawaii, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand and 
other countries in the Pacific Rim. It will also focus on commentaries, 
articles and interviews with artists, critics and other influential members of 
the art community. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't be reviewing exhibitions in New York and Europe, but if there is an 
important art trend in those areas, we'll cover it," said Betsky. 
</P>
<P>
The cover story of Artcoast's first issue profiles Japanese-American artist 
Masami Teraoka. Other articles include an interview with David Hockney about 
the relationship between quantum physics and visual arts, a commentary on Frank 
Gehry's winning proposal for the $65-million Walt Disney Concert Hall and an 
article by artist Robert Morris on the first international museum exhibition of 
Australian aboriginal art. 
</P>
<P>
The second issue will focus on the state of art in California, Crothers said. 
</P>
<P>
The philosophy behind Artcoast's coverage is not the only aspect setting it 
apart from other similar publications. One look at the March cover makes 
Artcoast stand out. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by graphic designer Sheila Levrant de Bretteville, who redesigned The 
Times' typography in 1981, Artcoast reverses the traditional 8 1/2-inch-wide by 
11-inch-deep magazine measurements. This publication is 11 inches wide and 8 
3/8 inches deep. 
</P>
<P>
Besides accommodating the many new properties of magazine technology, the wider 
design can symbolize the geographical view Californians have, Levrant de 
Bretteville said, adding, "Californians can look out and across mountains and 
oceans and to the Pacific Rim."

UKRAINIAN EASTER ART SHOWCASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tucked away in a down-at-the-heels 1926 vaudeville/movie house in a 
less-than-spiffy part of Melrose Avenue, about 20 women were gathered recently 
around tables painting Easter eggs. Not your average pink, blue and yellow with 
transfer designs, these eggs have ancient, intricate designs in bold colors -- 
works of art carefully placed on the brittle surface of an eggshell. They're 
special for their artistic quality, and they're special for their historical 
significance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traditional Folk Art 
</P>
<P>
Much of this activity is in preparation for Sunday's open house, where a 
selection of things Ukrainian will be on display and for sale from noon to 5 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors can view hundreds of decorated Easter eggs, ritual breads and 
watercolors of folk scenes, some by San Francisco artist Katerina Krychevsky 
Rosandich, as well as other displays, demonstrations and cold buffet foods 
traditionally served in Ukrainian homes at Easter time. The center is at 4315 
Melrose Ave., Los Angeles; (213) 668-0172. 
</P>
<P>
The front of the building says: Ukrainian Cultural Center; the upstairs rooms 
are occupied by the Ukrainian Art Center. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1980 and incorporated as a nonprofit organization in 1986, the 
center was established not only to "preserve and develop Ukrainian folk arts . 
. . but to focus on artists of Ukrainian origin -- those who have developed 
their art abroad as well as those who live, train and work in America." 
</P>
<P>
According to Daria Chaikovsky, an executive-board member, there are about 
20,000 Ukrainians in the area from Ventura County to Orange County, though only 
about 5,000 are active in Ukrainian pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
The eventual goal is to establish a permanent home for Ukrainian arts on the 
West Coast. Run completely by volunteers, the center is supported by a core 
group of 105 members. 
</P>
<P>
However, it is not just a showplace for art; it's a place for hands-on 
experience, such as creating beautiful eggs at Easter time. 
</P>
<P>
"We have four distinct programs a year," Chaikovsky explained. "The first one 
is the egg painting (pysanky), which ends with the Easter holidays. In May, we 
start the embroidery program, which ends with an exhibit. In September, we have 
the ceramics course, and in November, we begin the Christmas ornaments." There 
are future plans to have culinary classes, music and film programs and possibly 
folk dancing. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Adrianna Wrzesniewski taught the beginners in pysanky in one room and 
her mother, Zenovia, lectured in a smaller room as she kept an eye on her 
advanced egg-painting class. 
</P>
<P>
"The tiny designs have come (about) with our more sophisticated equipment. The 
kystka (which holds the wax that lies on the design) was originally a small, 
hollow bone. The original designs were simpler too -- suns, reindeers for food, 
etc. to give to the gods in spring. The colors also were simpler and more 
faded. The (symbolism on the) eggs, whose origins go back to pagan times, were 
then absorbed by the Ukrainians when they accepted Christianity in 988, and the 
pagan designs took on religious meanings." 
</P>
<P>
The eggs are done during the Lenten season and are presented during the year 
for different occasions: births, Christenings, weddings, illnesses and even 
deaths. Far from being just decorative, the eggs contain a whole message from 
decorator to receiver. Wrzesniewski explained: "They are a talisman, a wish. 
Every line means something; every color represents something different." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Painting Process 
</P>
<P>
The first design placed on an egg, from end to end, is the "everlasting line"; 
it has no beginning and no end and, according to Wrzesniewski, "It puts your 
soul and the receiver's soul into eternity." 
</P>
<P>
Flowers stand for beauty, leaves for growth, pine cones or pine needles for 
tears of love; the pine tree itself stands for health. Any part of an animal 
depicted stands for wealth (antlers or ram's horns frequently are used) and the 
more the design is repeated, the more wealth. 
</P>
<P>
As for the colors, yellow (usually the egg is dipped first in the egg-coloring 
process) represents good harvest, white is purity, red is love, green is for 
growth (spiritual, physical and mental, as well as plant growth), blue is regal 
and represents water and the sky, and black is for remembrance. 
</P>
<P>
Wrzesniewski insisted that it takes only two or three eggs to get a handle on 
this very delicate work, and a few days' steady work to finish one egg 
utilizing several colors. Of course, the bigger the egg, the longer the time, 
up to a week for intricate work on an ostrich egg. The process of coloring is 
much like batik. As the egg is dyed, brightest colors first, wax is laid over 
them to keep them from being covered over by succeeding colors, with black, of 
course, being the last color used. The dyes themselves are alkaline and 
developed especially for this process. Then the wax is melted off, and 
underneath lies the glory of a pysanka. 
</P>
<P>
Bernice Boddie of Los Angeles smiled when asked why she took up such 
painstaking work. "You do have to have patience," she said, "but this is 
different and it's fun. Anything to do with my hands, I want to do it." Martha 
Haber from Long Beach agreed: "It is fun -- and I love eggs. I've done egg 
crafts for several years."

ANCIENT FESTIVAL OF PURIM IS A JOYOUS JEWISH OCCASION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERB HAIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ancient festival of Purim, which commemorates the victory of an endangered 
Jewish community over its Persian enemies, will be observed this weekend. 
Generally, the occasion is accompanied by songs, dancing and special foods, and 
the Book of Esther, also known as the Megillah, is read in temples and 
synagogues. 
</P>
<P>
In Jewish tradition, about 2,500 years ago, a man named Haman, who had just 
become the chief adviser to Persia's King Ahasveros, was upset because 
Mordecai, a leader of the Jewish community, had refused to bow down before him, 
as decreed by the king to honor Haman's elevation. Notified of this, the king 
declared that such disobedience deserved severe punishment, and Haman made 
preparations to have all the Jews in the kingdom killed. He drew lots (Purim is 
Hebrew for lots) to determine the day the Jews should be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for the Jews in Persia, the niece of Mordecai, whose name was 
Esther, had just become the king's favorite wife. At the risk of her own life, 
she revealed her ancestry and pleaded for the lives of her countrymen. The king 
was moved, but according to law, a royal decree of that type could not be 
countermanded. So the king issued another decree, giving the Jews permission to 
defend themselves, and on the fatal day, Haman and his cohorts were defeated. 
Haman himself ended up on the very gallows that he had built for Mordecai. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Jewish girls dress up as Queen Esther, while boys take on the roles of 
Mordecai or Ahasveros -- hardly anybody ever wants to play Haman. Women bake 
Hamantaschen (Haman's Purses -- pastries filled with prunes or other fruit and 
folded over to resemble Haman's hat). Children always look forward to the 
rattling of groggers (noisemakers) whenever the name of Haman is mentioned 
during the reading of the Purim story. 
</P>
<P>

calendar, many places of worship and Jewish community centers are planning

AMNESTY TEST ALL IN A DAY'S WORK; 
</P>
<P>
EZELL PICKS UP GOOD PR POINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE EMMONS, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
The idea was Margarita Rebollal's. As an employment recruiter for the Irvine 
Marriott hotel, she has 100 employees waiting to take the illegal alien amnesty 
program's Proficiency Test for Permanent Residency. Make it more convenient and 
give them the test at work, she suggested. 
</P>
<P>
But it took Harold Ezell, Western regional commissioner of the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service, to make it play in Peoria. 
</P>
<P>
Ezell's staff alerted the news media, outfitted two meeting rooms at the hotel 
with flags and posters and Friday afternoon administered 38 tests to hotel 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a green St. Patrick's Day sport coat, Ezell gave the applicants a pep 
talk, handed out the results himself, shook hands, clapped backs, kissed 
cheeks, posed for pictures and did what he could to whip up a party atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
He urged the hotel workers not to settle for mere permanent residency under the 
program. "The goal is to be a citizen, a fully franchised citizen of the United 
States," he enthused. "Tell your friends, 'I took that test; it's not hard.' " 
</P>
<P>
Apparently it wasn't. Thirty-two of the 38 passed, correctly answering nine of 
the 15 multiple-choice questions. A passing grade means the amnesty applicant 
does not have to attend an INS-approved class and complete at least 40 hours of 
instruction in the English language and American civics and history. 
</P>
<P>
The INS is eager to administer as many such tests as possible to ease the load 
on already overburdened classes. 
</P>
<P>
Before Friday, proficiency tests had only been given in INS offices and at a 
few other approved sites. About 5,000 of the tests have been given in Ezell's 
Western region, and 96% of the test-takers have passed, said George Apkarian, 
INS test administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Now Ezell wants employers to call and set up test sessions at the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
The test, intended to be simple and easily understood, is administered by 
videotape. Each question is shown on a TV screen while a recorded narrator 
reads it twice. Then the four answers -- A through D -- are shown and read, and 
the test-taker marks the letter of the correct answer on his answer sheet. 
</P>
<P>
The sheet, designed to be read by computer, is somewhat confusing, and many 
test-takers spent more time trying to fill in their names, INS numbers and 
other information than in taking the test. 
</P>
<P>
Enrique Aldana of Santa Ana, a banquet service employee waiting for his score 
to be tabulated, said he thought it was "a good idea for us. There's no lost 
time. We can spend our break taking the test." 
</P>
<P>
Even better, the test was "pretty easy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ezell declared the day a "tremendous, tremendous experience. . . . I expect 
this to snowball." 
</P>
<P>
He said 40% of the people who have applied for amnesty work in the service 
industry, such as hotels. At the Irvine Marriott, nearly 20% of all employees 
are amnesty applicants, Rebollal said. 
</P>
<P>
Such employers have a stake in helping their employees gain permanent 
residency, Ezell said. If an applicant does not take his test or complete 
school by his deadline, he reverts back to illegal status and his employer can 
be prosecuted for continuing to employ him. 
</P>
<P>
A few employers are conducting their own schools for immigrants, but all could 
help by providing a place and time for employees to take the proficiency test, 
Ezell said. "Employers can call the INS, and we'll provide testing on-site at 
no cost to the employers. The least we can do is help." 
</P>
<P>
When Friday's tests had been graded, Ezell took charge and assumed the role of 
emcee. He called Brenda Alvarez de Burton of Santa Ana, a secretary, to come 
forward and announced she had recorded a perfect score. She smiled, accepted 
her score sheet, then gave Ezell a peck on the cheek. 
</P>

A SOFTBALL GAME, THEN TRAGEDY AT INTERSECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sue Brasington left her daughter's junior high school softball game in Brea on 
Thursday afternoon to help prepare an evening banquet at the Eastside Christian 
Church in Fullerton, where she sang in the choir and worked as a full-time 
volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
Just moments after she left Tamarack Park, an alleged drunk driver in a Ford 
pickup raced through a red light and slammed into her Chevrolet van, killing 
the Fullerton resident. 
</P>
<P>
Friends of the family said that her husband, Mitchell, who was also watching 
their 14-year-old daughter, Courtney, play for Rosary Junior High School, heard 
the sound of the collision but did not learn until later that his wife had been 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tragic," said Beverly Flick, a family friend who knew Brasington through 
Eastside Christian Church. "She was always looking out for other people. She 
loved doing things for other people." 
</P>
<P>
Police said the driver of the pickup truck, Steven Spaur, 30, of Whittier, was 
treated at Brea Community Hospital then arrested on suspicion of vehicular 
manslaughter and felony drunk driving. Spaur, who did not have a valid driver 
license, was being held in Orange County jail in lieu of $25,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
A group of Brasington's friends, many of them members of her church, gathered 
at the family's home on Skyline Drive early Friday to offer support and help in 
preparing for services. 
</P>
<P>
No one expressed anger toward Spaur, Flick said. "We've been in prayer for 
him," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Brasington was described by her friends as a woman who loved to "serve" others. 
</P>
<P>
"She was one of the sweetest people you'd want to know," said Ralph Robson 
Christian education minister at Eastside. "She was totally committed to her 
family, to the church and to the Lord." 
</P>
<P>
Brasington worked as a secretary for the church's music minister, taught a 
Bible class and sang in the choir. She worked full time on a volunteer basis 
for 4 years as a secretary, according to Tim Nuenschwander, minister of music 
at the church. 
</P>
<P>
"She never wanted to be thanked for what she did," he said. "She worked, doing 
whatever I needed done for however many hours it would take." 
</P>
<P>
When she wasn't working in the church, Brasington liked to entertain. 
</P>
<P>
"She enjoyed her friends probably more than anything," said Linda Merold, a 
friend of Brasington for 6 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Her home was always open to people who needed a meal or a place to stay," she 
said. "The house was full of her children's friends and adult friends. We 
(adults) always ended up at their house" after going out together, Merold said. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell Brasington owns a company based in El Paso and had been commuting 
between his business and the family's Fullerton home for about a year and a 
half, friends said. Brasington had picked up her husband at Ontario airport 
before their daughter's game and watched part of it with him before she left 
for church. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday afternoon, about a dozen classmates of Brasington's children -- Chad, 
16, who attends Troy High School, and Courtney -- joined family and friends at 
the home. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral services will be at 2 p.m. Monday at Eastside Christian Church, 2505 E. 
Yorba Linda Blvd., Fullerton. Burial will be in Loma Vista Memorial Park, 701 
E. Bastanchury Road, Fullerton.

BERGESON CALLS FOR 'COALITION FOR CHANGE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), who this month introduced 
statewide legislation aimed at managing problems associated with growth, 
appealed to county officials Friday to "forge a coalition for change." 
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with the Southern California Assn. of County Supervisors in 
Newport Beach, Bergeson discussed her growth legislation package and called for 
cooperation between cities and counties to manage growth in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thrust of what we're trying to get at is to get people to talk and 
work together," Bergeson said. She added that she is not trying to take power 
away from local governments but rather to develop a broad statewide policy to 
help local and regional governments act more effectively. "The problems are 
just too big for any one community to solve alone," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She cited environmental impact reports, which are required for all new 
development in the state, as an example of a state policy created to address 
the problems of growth. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson's legislation includes a provision that would encourage cities to work 
together on traffic, housing and other growth-related matters. Another, she 
said, would allow cities to share tax revenue on certain new developments, and 
another would offer priority for state bonds and grants as an incentive for 
cities to accept new developments. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of Bergeson's legislation have said that it does not address the 
problem of a lack of revenue for the infrastructure that must accompany growth. 
Bergeson said she agrees that the state's revenue shortage is a problem but 
that her proposals are "a first step" toward improving the problems growth is 
posing. 
</P>
<P>
To ensure that necessary tax legislation could be passed, she called Friday for 
a "massive public information campaign" to tell people how their money would be 
used. She also mentioned that bond sales are an alternative.

LAGUNA HILLS; 
</P>
<P>
MARCH 30 IS DEADLINE FOR CANDIDATES TO FILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of the proposed city of Laguna Hills have until March 30 to file 
petitions to run as city council candidates when the cityhood issue goes before 
voters June 6. 
</P>
<P>
Council members will run for election at the same time voters consider the 
proposed incorporation of Laguna Hills. Those interested in one of the five 
council seats must obtain nominating petitions from the county registrar of 
voters and return it with at least 20 signatures of registered voters in that 
area by March 30. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the last day to file ballot arguments for or against the 
incorporation of Laguna Hills is Monday at the registrar of voters office, 
1300-C, S. Grand Ave., Santa Ana. Any registered voter or citizens' group 
entitled to vote on the measure may submit a ballot argument of 300 words or 
less. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, Laguna Hills, wedged between Interstate 5 on the east and the 
Aliso Viejo planned community on the west, would become the county's 29th city. 
It would have about 45,000 residents on 6,000 acres. The private Leisure World 
community of 21,000 people would form the geographic core of the new city.

JURY URGES STUDY ON 24-HOUR USE OF COUNTY VEHICLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN R. CHURM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County Grand Jury, concerned about the number of county employees 
who drive county cars home at night, has recommended that the practice be 
closely monitored and, where possible, eliminated to save money and reduce 
liability. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 county employees use county cars, vans or pickup trucks to 
commute on a daily basis, according to a grand jury report released this week. 
About 12 of those employees live in Los Angeles or Riverside counties, and at 
least one employee makes a daily 100-mile round trip in a county vehicle. The 
report said the practice costs the county about $250,000 a year, too much 
considering the county's current budget troubles. 
</P>
<P>
James O. Lindberg, the grand jury foreman, said that although some use of 
county vehicles for personal commuting may be in the county's best interest, 
"it appears that, with county budgets so tight, considerable savings are 
possible by limiting the use of county vehicles." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County has a fleet of 1,300 vehicles operated by its 13,000 full-time 
employees. About 100 of the vehicles are assigned to employees on a 24-hour 
basis, 61 to Environmental Management Agency employees and 40 to Fire 
Department employees. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those who drive their vehicles home are top fire officials, public 
works employees and building inspectors who must respond to emergencies or 
drive from their homes directly to construction sites. 
</P>
<P>
But the grand jury said county officials have made no attempt to assign 
employees with take-home vehicles to jobs near their residences to reduce 
driving distances and wear and tear on county cars. 
</P>
<P>
Bill B. Wills, foreman pro tem of the grand jury who coordinated the vehicle 
review, said the county should consider establishing a maximum commute distance 
for those who drive county cars home. He also recommended that the county 
prohibit any of its vehicles from being taken outside the county except on 
official business. And he urged that the county establish an annual review of 
which employees have take-home privileges for county vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that management in various county departments needs to take a 
serious look at whether this practice is in the best interest of the taxpayer," 
Wills said. "It has been handled rather loosely, and that is of some concern to 
us." 
</P>
<P>
A county spokesman said the grand jury's report will be studied and the 
recommended action taken under consideration.

IMMIGRATION CENTER FACING PROBE MAY HAVE DEFRAUDED THOUSANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Araceli Scheel has endured much in her young life. A refugee from the political 
turmoil of El Salvador, where she lost her husband in the civil war, and the 
repression and poverty of her homeland, Guatemala, she undertook a dangerous 
journey 9 years ago hoping for a better life here. 
</P>
<P>
Her dreams have come at a cost, however. The Orange County resident is one of 
thousands of Spanish-speaking immigrants who authorities say may have been 
defrauded by one of the largest immigration legalization services in the area. 
</P>
<P>
She says she wants her story told so that others might avoid the expense and 
pain she has endured. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe others will be motivated to come forward with their stories," she said, 
speaking softly through an interpreter. "They are taking in so many people." 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County district attorney's office is investigating the owner of 
Southern California Immigration Center, which Scheel approached for help in 
handling her amnesty application, on a variety of complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Salinas, 51, an El Toro businessman who owns the Immigration Center and 
other area immigration assistance firms, was arrested March 9 at his home and 
charged with 12 felony counts of tax evasion. Those charges stem from a 
yearlong, ongoing fraud investigation and were brought because authorities were 
concerned about a potential danger to the Latino community, Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Gerald C. Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
"We proceeded with what we could for right now because of the complaints we 
have received and our concern for further harm in the community," he said. 
"These people are very vulnerable and often easily victimized." 
</P>
<P>
Salinas could not be reached for comment. His attorney, Lew Geiser, said 
Salinas has pleaded not guilty to the tax evasion charges. But he would not 
respond directly to the fraud investigation because no charges have been filed 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
"Until a formal charge is levied, and we are informed of specific cases, there 
is nothing to respond to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston would not characterize the specific practices that are being 
investigated but said they generally involve false promises of amnesty or work 
permits in exchange for a fee. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston said authorities estimate that about 2,000 people have used Salinas' 
companies to get work permits for as much as $2,500 apiece. The firms may 
represent as many as 5,000 clients altogether, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robin Blackwell, coordinator for the Santa Ana-based Coalition of Immigrant's 
Rights, said her group has been receiving complaints for months about Salinas' 
companies and that many in the Latino community are finally willing to take 
their stories to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"Many don't even realize they are being defrauded because they are strung along 
by a paper process that looks legitimate," said Blackwell, who is helping the 
district attorney's office in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Blackwell said Scheel's story is typical of others' experiences since 
immigration reform laws took effect in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Scheel, 35, contacted the Southern California Immigration Center in June, 1987, 
after hearing about its services on a Spanish language radio station. 
</P>
<P>
She had arrived in this country in 1980 from Guatemala after paying $300 to a 
professional "coyote" to be brought across the border, leaving her three 
children behind with her parents. Her Salvadoran husband had been killed the 
same year, before the couple could flee El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Scheel lived with a brother in Costa Mesa. Then for 2 years she 
worked as a live-in housekeeper for an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
She paid $2,000 for a family acquaintance to retrieve her children from 
Guatemala, and they arrived in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Scheel wanted to stay in the country and decided to apply for amnesty, but says 
she was told by an employee of the Southern California Immigration Center that 
she did not qualify because she had left the United States for a week in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
She says she was told that the company instead could obtain a work permit and a 
non-immigrant visa for her for $3,500. She signed a contract and paid $1,500, 
promising the rest in monthly payments. 
</P>
<P>
During the months that followed, the firm sent Scheel various cards and 
documents identifying her as someone who had applied for a work permit -- none 
of which carried the weight of law, Blackwell said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Scheel did qualify for amnesty, Blackwell said. 
</P>
<P>
"She was inappropriately told she did not qualify and advised to seek something 
much more expensive and paid money she didn't need to," Blackwell added. 
</P>
<P>
Scheel learned that she was eligible for amnesty when she sought a second 
opinion from advisers at St. Anne's Church in Santa Ana. She applied the day 
before amnesty expired. 
</P>
<P>
Still, she continued to send monthly payments to the Immigration Center. She 
also kept letters from them warning that whatever she read in the media about 
amnesty eligibility was false. 
</P>
<P>
Scheel said she stuck with the center when they offered to represent her at her 
amnesty interview with the Immigration and Naturalization Service. But when the 
adviser they sent didn't even speak Spanish, she stopped her payments. 
</P>
<P>
"I came to believe more and more that this place was not providing legitimate 
help," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She took her case to the Orange County Human Relations Commission after reading 
about Salinas' arrest. 
</P>
<P>
She said she still receives letters from the Immigration Center demanding that 
she pay more than the $600 they claim she owes. 
</P>
<P>
"The bad part is that I referred at least 10 people to that place," she said. 
"I know people who are still making payments to them. I thought it was a way 
for people to get" legal status.

Jurors in the trial of of Danny David Ornelas asked questions in court Friday 
afternoon that indicate they may be moving toward a manslaughter, rather than a 
murder, verdict in the case. 
</P>
<P>
About an hour and a half later, however, the jury recessed for the weekend 
without having reached a decision. The trial began three weeks ago in Orange 
County Superior Court in Westminster. Judge Luis A. Cardenas ordered the jurors 
to resume their deliberations at 9:30 a.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Ornelas, 19, of Huntington Park, is accused of second-degree murder in the 
death last Sept. 1 of Debbie Killelea, 37, of Newport Beach. Killelea was 
fatally injured when a speeding car driven by Ornelas struck her as she was 
walking with two of her children in a narrow alley behind her home on Balboa 
Peninsula. The incident was accidentally videotaped by a young man riding in 
the car Ornelas was driving. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Statewide Interest 
</P>
<P>
The videotape, along with the outrage community members expressed over her 
death, has sparked statewide interest in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Ornelas' defense attorney, Ralph Bencangey of Beverly Hills, argued during the 
trial that Ornelas should have been on trial for manslaughter, not murder. 
Bencangey said he was encouraged by the jurors' sending written questions to 
Cardenas asking about vehicular manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
The questions, which the judge read aloud in court, asked whether a jury must 
find multiple elements of guilt to convict a defendant of gross vehicular 
manslaughter. Cardenas told the jurors that only one element of guilt is 
necessary for a conviction of that crime. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors also asked Cardenas whether it is necessary to find that a defendant 
had blood-alcohol level of 0.10 or higher in order to convict him of gross 
vehicular manslaughter. Cardenas responded that such a finding was not 
necessary for a defendant to be convicted of that crime. 
</P>
<P>
According to unrebutted testimony presented during the trial, a blood test made 
Sept. 1 about an hour after Ornelas was arrested showed that he had a 
blood-alcohol level of 0.18 -- almost twice the minimum of 0.10 that state law 
says constitutes proof of drunkenness. 
</P>
<P>
A curious twist in the trial was that both the defense attorney and the 
prosecutor produced expert witnesses to argue that Ornelas was fairly sober at 
the time of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
The defense's expert witness testified that the strong rum Ornelas drank just 
before he got behind the wheel had probably not been absorbed into his 
bloodstream by the time he hit Killelea. That expert estimated that Ornelas' 
was driving with a blood-alcohol level of 0.04. 
</P>
<P>
The defense argued that Ornelas had tried to avoid hitting Killelea, and 
Bencangey has told reporters that part of his strategy was to show that Ornelas 
was sober enough to have been trying to veer away from Killelea. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Goethals, by contrast, said his intention was to show 
that Ornelas was sober enough to have "implied malice" in his hitting Killelea. 
A finding of implied malice is a necessary element for a second-degree murder 
conviction in the case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Implications of Actions 
</P>
<P>
Jurors asked Cardenas questions about the legal definition of implied malice 
Friday morning. They had told the judge on Thursday that they were "hopelessly 
deadlocked" and that the question of implied malice was among the stumbling 
blocks. 
</P>
<P>
The switch that afternoon to questions about gross vehicular manslaughter 
seemed to indicate that the jury had changed its focus on a possible murder 
conviction, according to Bencangey. 
</P>
<P>
The judge told the jurors before they began deliberating Tuesday morning that 
they had five verdict options: guilty of second-degree murder; guilty of gross 
vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated; guilty of gross vehicular 
manslaughter without intoxication; guilty of simple vehicular manslaughter, or 
not guilty of any crime. 
</P>
<P>
Ornelas, who looked despondent on Thursday, was smiling outside court late 
Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Bencangey said in an interview: "I think my client has a good chance. . . . The 
questions permitted the court, using the law properly, to make it as easy as 
possible for them (the jury) to find a verdict of manslaughter. I'm 
encouraged." 
</P>
<P>
He added that he did not think the jurors would have asked about manslaughter 
if they were still focused on a murder conviction. "I don't think so," he said, 
"but I can't predict what people are thinking. You never know. Apparently they 
really are having a deadlock, because even after the judge answered those 
questions they stayed out the rest of the afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
Goethals, in a brief interview, said he thought the jury was on the verge of 
delivering a verdict after it asked the manslaughter questions. "Since they did 
not come back with a verdict, it means they're still working," he said. "On we 
go. I'm still optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
A second-degree murder conviction carries a penalty of 15 years to life in 
prison. A conviction of gross vehicular manslaughter carries a penalty of up to 
10 years in prison.

TWO-RUN TRIPLE MAKES DIFFERENCE IN 4-3 VICTORY

<P>
John Arnold's two-run triple in the sixth inning gave Ocean View High School a 
4-3 victory over Fountain Valley in a Sunset League opener Friday at Ocean 
View. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View (6-2) and Fountain Valley (5-4) were tied, 2-2, when Baron reliever 
Steve Montgomery (1-2) walked Cory Colbert and gave up a bunt single to Scott 
Caringella to start the Ocean View sixth. 
</P>
<P>
After Kevin Mullins forced Colbert at third, Arnold, who was hitless in his 
first 13 at-bats this season, lined a pitch into right-center field to score 
Caringella and Mullins. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View sophomore pitcher Randy Karliner (4-0), who hit Bryan Kojima with a 
pitch to start the seventh, survived a scare when left fielder Caringella made 
a leaping catch against the fence to take a home run away from Matt Hallock. 
</P>
<P>
Kojima, who went to second on a wild pitch, advanced to third on Hallock's 
drive. He scored Fountain Valley's third run on Steve Grack's sacrifice fly. 
But Jon Orcher hit a fly ball to center to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
"He struggled a bit with his control today, but he's such a competitor that you 
have to leave him in the game," Ocean View Coach Steve Barrett said of 
Karliner, who allowed four hits and four walks in his third complete game of 
the season. "He doesn't strike out a lot of people, but he keeps the ball down 
and gets a lot of ground-ball outs." 
</P>
<P>
Said Fountain Valley Coach Ron LaRuffa: "I'm not happy with the way we competed 
today. We kind of sat back and waited for something to happen instead of just 
making things happen. We had a complete breakdown of fundamentals at times, and 
we can't afford to do that when we face the teams of the Sunset League." 
</P>
<P>
With one out in the third, Ocean View's Darren Ernst and Steve Hernandez 
singled off starter Jeff Hale, with Hernandez taking second on center fielder 
Grack's throw to third. After Daniel Hernandez's infield out scored Ernst, 
Hernandez, who took third on the play, scored when third baseman Jeff Higbee 
mishandled Gary Christoferson's ground ball for an error. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Mendoza, who led off the Fountain Valley fourth with an infield single, 
went to third on Karliner's high pickoff throw to first. He then scored on 
Montgomery's single to left. Two outs later, Montgomery scored on Hallock's 
double. 
</P>
<P>
In another Sunset League game: 
</P>
<P>
Edison 2, Huntington Beach 0 (8 innings) -- With two outs in the eighth, Rocky 
Balch doubled home two runs for the victory at Huntington Beach. Jay Thobe 
(1-0) gave up four hits and struck out five in seven innings for the victory.

SAVANNA PRINCIPAL WILL RECOMMEND DEPALMA AS COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Savanna High School Principal William Wong said Friday he will recommend to the 
Anaheim Union High School District Board of Trustees that Fred DePalma be hired 
as the school's football coach. 
</P>
<P>
DePalma, who led Santiago to a playoff berth in 1985, has been an assistant 
coach at Valencia since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked the fact that he was very organized and has worked in a successful 
program at Valencia," Wong said. "We're hoping he can bring some of that 
enthusiasm over here." 
</P>
<P>
Savanna is coming off a 1-9 season. Dana Coleman resigned as coach after the 
season ended. 
</P>
<P>
Wong, who received 14 applications for the job, said he interviewed six 
candidates before deciding on DePalma. Wong said DePalma will teach in the 
physical education department. If approved by the school board, DePalma would 
take over on April 14.

IRVINE FIRM SEEKS NYSE INQUIRY ON 'RUMOR CAMPAIGN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHARLES TIGHE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Friday, just one day after the unexpected resignation of its president, 
National Education Corp. asked the New York Stock Exchange to investigate what 
it says is a rumor campaign aimed at damaging the company's financial 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
Investment analysts said the rumors helped send the value of National Education 
stock down 20% on Thursday and early Friday before the Irvine-based vocational 
education and training services firm received a vote of confidence from a group 
of institutional investors. 
</P>
<P>
H. David Bright, National Education's chairman, said in a prepared statement 
Friday that company officials had received numerous requests from financial 
analysts for "verification of a variety of rumors." He said the rumors 
denigrated the firm's performance and prospects. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Comments 
</P>
<P>
New York Stock Exchange spokeswoman Martha Cid declined to comment on the 
situation and would not even say whether it is usual for companies to request 
investigations of apparent smear campaigns. She said the exchange does conduct 
investigations when there is an unusual volume of trading or an unusual 
volatility in a stock. 
</P>
<P>
National Education officials declined to comment on their request. 
</P>
<P>
The rumors, which analysts said began Monday after the release of a negative 
investment report, gathered steam with the resignation Thursday of President 
Jerome W. Cwiertnia, who said he was stepping down to pursue other career 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
National Education stock began the week badly when an investment report 
questioning an unusually large buildup in the firm's accounts receivable was 
released. Receivables totaled $96.9 million on Sept. 30, up from $51 million at 
the end of 1987 and $28.6 million at the end of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"The accounts receivable gave me uncertainties, and I downgraded the stock," 
said Bert L. Boksen, an analyst at Raymond, James &amp; Associates, a regional 
brokerage in St. Petersburg, Fla. Boksen downgraded the stock from a "buy" to a 
"hold" recommendation Monday, then issued a "sell" recommendation Friday 
because of investor uncertainty about the effect of Cwiertnia's departure. 
</P>
<P>
Other analysts said the large receivable figure is not cause for concern and 
that an increase is understandable considering that National Education has made 
two major acquisitions in the past 2 years. 
</P>
<P>
"These receivables are with either Fortune 100 or Fortune 500 companies. Jerry 
Cwiertnia told me he has no doubt they're going to receive them. Jerry 
Cwiertnia is as honest as a person can be," said David Butterworth, an analyst 
at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Connection' 
</P>
<P>
One analyst said the unexpected resignation caused some investors to connect 
the concern over receivables with Cwiertnia's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
"I see some uninformed people saying, 'Oh, here's this receivables question and 
3 days later the president is stepping down.' I've followed the company for 
years, and I know there is no connection," Butterworth said. 
</P>
<P>
Institutional investors tried to give the stock a boost Friday with buy orders. 
And the investment firm of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. arranged a conference call 
between 50 investment managers and National Education officials in a bid to 
bolster confidence in the company. 
</P>
<P>
"Among informed investors, nothing was amiss," said Ram Capoor, a Morgan 
Stanley analyst. 
</P>
<P>
Investor uncertainty over the company's short-term cash flow caused Shearson 
Lehman Hutton analyst Jeff Kessler to slightly downgrade his firm's rating for 
National Education, but Kessler said he nevertheless believes the uncertainty 
is unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Timing Is Questioned 
</P>
<P>
One industry analyst, who asked not to be identified, said the timing of 
Cwiertnia's announcement added to the uncertainty. "They could have waited 
until the market closed," he said. Cwiertnia then "could spend the afternoon 
telling people his reasons for leaving and the stock wouldn't be trading." 
</P>
<P>
National Education said it informed the stock exchange of the resignation 
before the announcement was made, and a company spokesman said that officials 
believed that they were required to announce the resignation while the market 
was open. 
</P>
<P>

WILSON FORD'S BUSINESS TACTICS SUBJECT OF PROBE; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTIGATORS CLAIM SALES STAFF TRAINED TO LIE, CHEAT AND PRESSURE CUSTOMERS

One of Southern California's largest auto dealerships conspired to defraud 
consumers, first with false advertising delivered by television pitchman Ralph 
Williams and then with sales representatives trained in deceit, a state 
investigator contends in court documents filed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The documents, examined by Orange County Superior Court Judge John J. Ryan last 
week before he authorized a warrant used to search Wilson Ford in Huntington 
Beach on Sunday, described the dealership as a business where teams of sales 
people worked to "wear down" and "manipulate" customers. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears . . . Ford is stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from car 
buyers" by "relying on the vulnerability of the car-buying public," state 
Justice Department investigator Carlos C. Martinez said in a report that was 
among the documents. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators contend that Williams' ads lured customers into the dealership by 
offering cars at below-factory-invoice prices, when Williams knew that once 
they arrived, salespeople would lie to them and get them to sign contracts with 
hidden costs and inflated prices for such things as buyer-protection plans. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Martinez report, the documents filed Friday include 
statements from former Wilson Ford managers and sales personnel, written 
complaints from customers, and reports from undercover investigators who had 
posed as car buyers while wearing hidden microphones. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, who is leading a multi-agency investigation of Wilson Ford, offered 
statements by former employees who maintain that the dealership's managers 
train sales personnel in weekly meetings to deceive and manipulate customers. 
One employee identified Williams as the person directing Wilson Ford's 
day-to-day operations. 
</P>
<P>
No one has been charged in the case. JoAnn Black, a supervisor with the 
Department of Motor Vehicles investigations office in Orange County, said that 
investigators are studying the documents they seized and had not yet decided on 
the next course of action. She said no individual, at this point, could be 
described as the major target of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who has owned car dealerships in Texas, Washington state and Canada, 
as well as in California, became well-known in the early 1960s when he began 
plugging his Orange County dealership up to 70 times a night on television. 
</P>
<P>
However, he has had occasional troubles with law enforcement authorities and 
officials who regulate car dealerships. In Washington, he still owes consumers 
millions of dollars that were awarded in a judgment against him related to a 
dealership in Seattle, according to Jay Uchida of the Washington state attorney 
general's office. 
</P>
<P>
His dealer's license has been suspended twice in California and the DMV in 1983 
refused him a salesman's license based on a contention that he had made sales 
at Wilson Ford without a license. That decision was eventually overturned, 
however, by an administrative law judge. Williams now has a valid sales 
license. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall G. Mintz, the lawyer who represents the dealership, said that Williams 
has no ownership interest in the dealership. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Williams nor the owners of Wilson Ford could be reached for comment. 
Mintz and Rock Armstrong, Wilson Ford's business manager, said they could not 
comment on Martinez's allegations because they had not read the documents. 
</P>
<P>
Mintz said the dealership has remained in compliance with a $50,000 judgment 
that the state attorney general's office obtained in 1986. That judgment 
prohibits the dealership from engaging in numerous misleading practices, 
including deceptive advertising. 
</P>
<P>
"It has never been called to Wilson Ford's attention that it was not complying 
with the judgment," Mintz said. 
</P>
<P>
During the search last Sunday, which lasted more than 5 hours, investigators 
removed from the dealership huge amounts of computer software and hardware and 
written records, some of which were retrieved from trash cans and a dumpster 
behind the dealership. The list of the seized documents filled 55 pages. 
</P>
<P>
A statement from a former employee that was included in the documents filed 
Friday said that original quotes to customers were always done on paper or on 
computer printouts that were never given to the customers. The salespeople were 
instructed, he said, to throw away the paper or printout as soon as a deal was 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
In a typical case cited by the former employees, quotes given customers were 
inflated intentionally, so that it would appear later in the negotiations that 
the dealership was making concessions. After a verbal agreement had been 
reached, the customer was presented with a written contract with different 
figures. If they questioned the discrepancies, their concerns were discounted. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, after the state judgment against the dealership, the documents said, 
salespeople were told to run credit checks even on customers who wanted to pay 
cash for their cars so that state employees or undercover law enforcement 
personnel could be detected.

SOVIET WATCHES WINNING HANDS-DOWN IN ITALY 
</P>

<BYLINE>

MILAN

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an era of high-tech electronic gadgets, the Soviet Union's old-fashioned 
mechanical watches are conquering fashion-crazy Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Genuine Soviet-made watches are selling in classy Italian jewelry shops as fast 
as the Soviets can produce them, and the rest of Europe and the United States 
are the next targets. 
</P>
<P>
Less than 5 months after the first Cyrillic-inscribed "Made in the USSR" 
timepieces crossed the border, the Soviet watch industry has received the 
highest of accolades -- thousands of fakes are appearing on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union has long been the world's third-largest producer of clocks and 
watches -- after Switzerland and the Far East -- but until last fall, exports 
were confined to selling parts and movements to Western makers. 
</P>
<P>
The chunky, 1950s-style wrist-watches, including five models previously made 
exclusively for the Red Army, are the most successful Soviet consumer products 
to reach the West under Mikhail Gorbachev's new era of reform. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Status Symbol 
</P>
<P>
Displayed in high-class Italian shops next to gold Rolexes and diamond-studded 
bracelets, the utilitarian Paketa and Red Army Boctok watches have become a 
sought-after status symbol. 
</P>
<P>
"We have convinced jewelers who sell watches worth millions of lire (thousands 
of dollars) to display side by side these simple Soviet products which cost as 
little as 100,000 lire ($75)," said Orazio Occhipinti, who last fall clinched 
the European distribution contract for Paketa. 
</P>
<P>
Occhipinti said that his entire stock of 40,000 Paketa watches was sold out in 
the 2 months before Christmas and that he that has no doubt that the 150,000 
more he plans to import to Italy in 1989 will get a similar reception. 
</P>
<P>
"They are an anti-status status symbol. . . . The Russians seem a bit 
astonished. They can't quite understand why they're in such demand," Occhipinti 
said. 
</P>
<P>
His Milan-base Mirabilia firm won the contract against competition from about 
50 Italian companies keen to capitalize on the wave of "Gorby fever" sweeping 
Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eager for Hard Currency 
</P>
<P>
Eager for hard currency, the Russians needed little persuasion to sell, and 
Italy, whose 6 million watch sales a year make it the third-largest consumer 
market in the world, was the ideal place for a test launch. 
</P>
<P>
"Once a watch was simply a watch and something you bought for a lifetime. Now 
it's a fashion accessory which also tells the time. Men change them like they 
do ties, and for women they're like earrings," said Occhipinti, whose teen-age 
daughter has a collection of "about 20" cheap and cheerful watches. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the success, we could have asked twice the price, but we decided to 
market the Paketa as a fashion item aimed at the middle and upper classes," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Following a major Italian trade fair in Moscow last October, another Italian 
company, Time Trend, won a 5-year contract to handle the first ever commercial 
sales of the legendary Boctok wristwatch. 
</P>
<P>
The five distinctive models, bearing the design of either a parachute, 
submarine or tank for the respective divisions, a plain red star for infantry 
and a special version for all commanders, are available in the Soviet Union 
only to the military, importers say. 
</P>
<P>
On sale in Italy since late January for 280,000 lire ($210), they are being 
snapped up by collectors and the ordinary public despite minimal advertising.

SOME COUNTY DRY CLEANERS PRESS THEIR CASE FOR PICKING UP AND DELIVERING CLOTHES 
TO HOMES, OFFICES, EVEN CLOSETS; 
</P>
<P>
LAUNDRY TO GO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The dry cleaning business is picking up. Literally. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of Orange County companies have discovered that they can make a tidy 
profit by going out and gathering dirty laundry, rather than letting it come to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
For a small service charge -- or for no charge at all -- half a dozen dry- 
cleaning companies will drop by your home or business, plunk your dirty clothes 
into a sack and then shuttle them back, sometimes the next day. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, Kuster's Quality Cleaners, will even hang cleaned gowns or shirts 
in your closets. Another, Rainbowman, claims to have once used a private 
airplane to please a customer who wanted same-day service. 
</P>
<P>
Sounds impossible, you say? 
</P>
<P>
Not according to the dry cleaners, who say they'll stop at nothing to keep 
customers from getting steamed. 
</P>
<P>
The trend toward home delivery is the latest step in the evolution of 
"cocooning" for affluent and young professionals. The same folks who are too 
busy to cook or go to the movies are also too busy to trek to the dry cleaners, 
business owners figure. 
</P>
<P>
"It's such an amenity. These people are so thrilled not to have to spend an 
hour out of their day," said Seth Morrell, who owns Rainbowman in Costa Mesa. 
"And they know if they give it to us on Monday, they'll have it in their hands 
by Thursday." 
</P>
<P>
Local entrepreneurs who hope to clean up in the delivery dry-cleaning business 
have opened companies such as Dress for Success in Costa Mesa, Artistic 
Cleaners in El Toro, and Wilson's "We Care" Dry Cleaning &amp; Laundry Service 
in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
What customers are they aiming for? Well-to-do, two-income families in their 
mid-20s to 50s who make upwards of $50,000 a year. Ideally, they will plunk 
down at least $60 to $85 a month for clean clothes. 
</P>
<P>
While there are more dry-cleaning vans these days, old-timers in the business 
are quick to point out that laundry delivery dates back 40 years, to days of 
milkmen and the Helms truck. 
</P>
<P>
Take Kuster's in Costa Mesa. The 42-year-old company has offered pickup 
services "since Day 1," said Lana Spurlock, vice president and manager, whose 
father started the firm. 
</P>
<P>
"Those were the good old days. Bread, milk -- everything had home delivery," 
said Jack Schwartz, the 60-year-old owner of Top Hat Cleaners &amp; Laundry in 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
When Top Hat's vans began rolling up to customers' homes about 18 years ago, 
Schwartz recalled, most people had gotten used to toting their dirty clothes to 
the cleaners, so delivery services dwindled considerably. 
</P>
<P>
But as more husbands and wives work, people have become pressed for time. So 
they're leaving everything from socks and underwear to baby clothes and purses 
on the front porch or back step for the dry cleaners. 
</P>
<P>
The pickup business, to be sure, hasn't always been smooth. There are more than 
a few examples of companies that have folded. 
</P>
<P>
The way most of the home-delivery services avoid losing their shirts these days 
is by having set routes that their vans follow on weekly schedules. 
</P>
<P>
Top Hat's Schwartz, for instance, has 300 to 400 route cards that tell him 
where to deliver and whether regular customers like heavy or medium starch on 
their shirts. "All the information's right there," he said, although after all 
his years in the business, Schwartz said the information "is in my head. I'm 
like the old horse that goes from stop to stop." 
</P>
<P>
At some homes, Schwartz is so familiar that the owners have left him keys to go 
inside and get their clothes. Others leave the laundry outside, then receive 
monthly bills in the mail. "I never see the majority of people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Dress for Success driver has a similar system. That company's driver makes 
stops in Irvine on Mondays, Wednesdays or Fridays, then returns them the next 
day. The service has become so popular that up to 60% of the cleaner's business 
comes from regular weekly stops at about 450 customers' homes, said Deborah 
Buckingham, one of the owners. 
</P>
<P>
On an average, the customers will spend about $17 each week, Buckingham said. 
That could be $4.50 to $5.50 for a blouse, $7.50 to $9.50 for a dress, or $3.25 
for a pair of men's slacks. "It's the same price or less than a lot of cleaners 
in Irvine" who don't deliver, said Buckingham. There is no extra charge for 
home delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Buckingham said the company is able to add no-cost pickup because of the weekly 
delivery schedules. "It's all a matter of your system," she said. "When someone 
calls, we don't run and pick up. With the route schedule, we know exactly how 
much we'll pick up every day . . . and it more than pays for itself." 
</P>
<P>
It works so well, in fact, that Dress for Success grosses close to $40,000 each 
month, according to Buckingham. 
</P>
<P>
At Rainbowman, Morrell agrees that "pretty tight territory management" is the 
key to delivery service. "Our trucks drive a fixed route. If they had to go all 
over hell and back, we'd really be spinning our wheels." 
</P>
<P>
The way that Rainbowman makes delivery work is by not accepting walk-in 
business. "The way we look at it, you can either have retail walk-in business 
with counter help and retail rent . . . or vans and drivers. The bottom line is 
very similar," Morrell said. 
</P>
<P>
To help the bottom line, Rainbowman won't accept the occasional laundry bag. 
"If one person hardly ever uses us, we'll cut 'em," Morrell said. 
</P>
<P>
The company apparently is one of the very few in Orange County that emphasizes 
its service to businesses, rather than to customers' homes. Morrell, who bought 
Rainbowman in November, 1987, believes that business service is more profitable 
because of the high concentration of customers. 
</P>
<P>
A single office, for instance, could provide as many as 30 customers at a 
single stop. And even at office parks, "there might be only six or seven 
people, but there are four or five offices we go to. It doesn't take a whole 
lot of time," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Rainbowman makes scheduled stops at companies such as C.J. Segerstrom and 
Pacific Savings Bank, picking up dirty garments from about 600 regular 
customers, according to Morrell. Workers who use the service bring their 
laundry to a designated area such as a closet or break room. The bags are 
tagged with labels identifying the customers and the items inside. 
</P>
<P>
When Morrell took over Rainbowman, the company was grossing about $1,900 a 
month. The service had a list of 800 business customers, but only about 100 
were active, he said. Morrell set about to improve the company's act, mainly by 
emphasizing service. Today, Rainbowman grosses about $18,000 each month and 
Morrell is hoping to franchise the operation. 
</P>
<P>
Competitors say the office pickup business is risky. Several who have tried it 
say that customers -- especially men -- just don't like to air their dirty 
laundry in public by hauling it to the office. 
</P>
<P>
And even if people are willing to bring their dirty clothes to the office, 
other problems sometimes must be ironed out. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't see the people, so it's hard to collect from them," said Schwartz, 
who tried -- and gave up on -- an office delivery service. "When people have to 
bring it to work, they forget it. . . . A lot of times, it wasn't worth going." 
</P>
<P>
But Morrell says he isn't worried. 
</P>
<P>
And conventional dry cleaners also don't appear to be threatened. "We haven't 
had any demand for pickup and delivery," said Kathy Ellis, manager of 
Continental 1 Hour Cleaners in El Toro. "They're not cutting in on us. There's 
more than enough business."

NOBLER OR NOT, 'REDUCED' BARD TO PLAY IN O.C.

<P>
To most people, doing a 40-second version of Shakespeare's "Hamlet" would be 
like traveling to New York by tricycle or bathing in a sink: You might be able 
to do it, but it wouldn't make much sense. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Shakespeare is subtlety, breadth, lyrical complexity, musical 
language -- and a lot of words. Chopping his classics to thimble size through 
hatchet editing and stage mischief is just not done -- at least not in polite 
society. 
</P>
<P>
The Reduced Shakespeare Company, which brings "The Complete Works of 
Shakespeare (Abridged)" to the Plummer Auditorium in Fullerton tonight, never 
said it was polite. Nor that everything it does makes perfect sense. 
</P>
<P>
But it does claim to be funny. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is just supposed to have a really good time -- that's what this is 
all about," said Daniel Singer, one of the Los Angeles-based troupe's three 
members. "We have respect for Shakespeare. In fact, we all started out doing 
him seriously, (but now) we're into the comic possibilities. And, you know, 
there are plenty." 
</P>
<P>
RSC finds them by starting with one inarguable point, at least to its way of 
thinking: for all the Bard's intensity and depth, he can be a real bore. From 
there, it is lampoon time as they mix goofy cut-and-paste editing (often 
running several plays together) with very physical comedy. 
</P>
<P>
Adam Long (the pretty one) plays all of Shakespeare's heroines under a 
startling floor-mop wig. Singer and Jess Borgeson take on the hero roles. They 
all move around quite a bit, and they sometimes abuse people in the front row. 
Sometimes they even make them come up on stage. 
</P>
<P>
"The Two Noble Kinsmen" has become "The Chernobyl Kinsmen." Tragedies get 
introductions such as this one for "Macbeth": "Never was there a story of more 
blood and death/Than this one of Mr. and Mrs. Macbeth." The histories are 
condensed into a football game. 
</P>
<P>
"This is like what you hated most in school about Shakespeare; we parody it all 
over the place," Singer said. "We take stuff from the Marx Brothers movies, 
even Bugs Bunny cartoons. This is acrobatic Shakespeare." 
</P>
<P>
RSC, in one form or another, has been at it since 1981, when Long, Singer and 
Borgeson brought their act to Renaissance faires, first in Northern California 
and then in the Los Angeles area. Back then, they did a 30-minute "Hamlet" that 
was pretty successful with audiences. Later, they were asked to do a half-hour 
"Romeo and Juliet" at a wedding reception. 
</P>
<P>
"We told them that if they wanted to give us the money, sure, we'd do that," 
Singer recalled. "We kept doing the 'Hamlet,' but that started to get boring, 
(and we began to change our minds) about the 30-minute format." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until RSC booked itself into Scotland's Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 
1987 that it finally came up with the current show's organization. "The 
Complete Works" was a hit, both with crowds and many of the critics, who may 
have come as skeptics but were apparently impressed by the company's verve. 
</P>
<P>
Wrote one festival reviewer: "With the energy of acrobats and the spontaneity 
of talented comedians, their riotously funny interpretation of our greatest 
poet will be one reason for getting out of bed early." 
</P>
<P>
Singer acknowledges that not all critics or scholars have been pleased -- 
"Sure, some have gone away shaking their heads" -- but he believes most 
appreciate what the company is doing because at the heart of the parodies is a 
genuine admiration for Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
"We've loved his plays for a long time, and that shows. The more people know 
about Shakespeare, the more they tend to like us. We have lots of (references 
and inside jokes) for them. We performed for MENSA (the club exclusively for 
high-IQers), and they were falling out of their chairs. 
</P>
<P>
"But we also know that Shakespeare, like all good writers, had good moments and 
bad moments. I don't think the comedies are very funny -- the tragedies are 
funnier -- and the histories can get really boring; they just weren't as 
inspired from a dramatic point of view. You find humor in that." 
</P>
<P>
Since Edinburgh, the company has played at the Los Angeles Fringe and at 
several Los Angeles-area theaters, usually to praise. The members don't have 
many illusions about making it big, however. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the New Vaudeville, a movement that includes the likes of the Flying 
Karamazov Brothers, Bill Irwin and Penn and Teller, they realize their 
audiences may be dedicated, knowledgeable and adventurous, but also that they 
tend to be relatively small. 
</P>
<P>
As Long put it in a 1987 interview: "When you eat fire or play spoons, you're 
probably never going to become a household word. You do it for the love of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Reduced Shakespeare Company performs tonight at 8 p.m. at Plummer 
Auditorium, 201 E. Chapman Ave., Fullerton. Tickets: $7.50 to $12.50.

It's tough to stake prime gallery space when you're a kid. Most of the time, 
the best exposure a young artist gets is the front of the family refrigerator 
where his work is wedged between the grocery list and mom's calorie chart. 
</P>
<P>
But Sunday through April 2, more than 500 budding artists will be treated to an 
exclusive gallery showing at the stately Muckenthaler Cultural Center in 
Fullerton. Part of the 14th annual Florence Arnold Children's Art Festival, the 
exhibit features drawings, paintings, sculpture and multimedia works by 
students from 19 Fullerton schools, grades K-8. 
</P>
<P>
Florence Arnold, 89, a longtime Fullerton resident and artist, launched the 
festival in 1976 as a way to instill an appreciation of the visual arts in 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to recognize young artists early in life," said Arnold, who is still 
active in local art circles. "We must encourage them to pursue the arts, and 
one of the best ways to do that is to give them a place to show off their 
talents." 
</P>
<P>
Open to every Fullerton schoolchild, the festival is strictly non-competitive, 
Arnold said, because "first, second and third (prize) is ridiculous for 
youngsters. They don't need that kind of competition. The fact that they 
participate is their reward." 
</P>
<P>
Every child participating in the festival receives a certificate from the 
Muckenthaler.Although there are no specific prizes awarded, Arnold and fellow 
Muckenthaler volunteerJane Engle will select one piece as the best of show, and 
a photograph of the work will be featured on announcements for next year's 
event. 
</P>
<P>
(Arnold, by the way, has been named by the Fullerton City Council as one of the 
city's "living treasures." Her work has been displayed at Newport Harbor Art 
Museum, the Muckenthaler, Laguna Art Museum and the Los Angeles Art Assn. 
gallery. Her personal history has been recorded in a book by the Cal State 
Fullerton oral history department; the biography says a collection of Arnold 
memorabilia was archived at the Smithsonian in a 1976 series on American 
artists.) 
</P>
<P>
The Florence Arnold Children's Art Festival kicks off Sunday with a free 
afternoon of student performances, crafts and games on the Muckenthaler 
grounds. Open to the public, the Mexican-themed event begins at 1 p.m. with 
ethnic craft booths, mariachis, Mexican snacks and a no-holds-barred 
pinata-smashing. At 2:30 p.m., 10 student performers will present brief musical 
recitals on an outdoor stage. The galleries will be open throughout the 
festival day. 
</P>
<P>
Children participating in the art exhibit were not restricted to any single 
theme or media. Materials they used ranged from tempera and watercolors to 
aluminum cans and clay, and artistic styles ran the gamut from mainstream to 
purely uninhibited, as in a series of wild papier-mache masks by Tai Pham, 
Hector Benavides, Steve Bradley, Jon Simard and He Nguyen, seventh-graders at 
Nicholas School. (Apparently inspired by American Indian ceremonial masks, the 
pieces feature day-glo colors and fierce expressions that would give just about 
any evil spirit the willies.) 
</P>
<P>
Realism and fantasy are displayed side by side. Ladera Vista Junior High 
student Leo Jocson paid homage to his Nikes in his true-to-life pencil sketch, 
and Golden Hill School student Angela Fisk let her imagination run wild with 
her ink drawing of a fantastic dog/bird/fish that looks like it flew nonstop 
from the pages of Greek mythology. 
</P>
<P>
Pop art makes the scene in a Warhol-esque soda can sculpture by Tracy Cadek, a 
sixth-grader at Sunset Lane School. And, as could be expected, the 
kindergartners seem to have the corner on free expression, as seen in bold 
abstracts in hot pink, azure and black by the sandbox set at Golden Hill 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14th Annual Florence Arnold Children's Art Festival runs Sunday through 
April 2 at the Muckenthaler Cultural Arts Center, 1201 W. Malvern Ave., 
Fullerton. Gallery hours are 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., Tuesday through Saturday, noon 
to 5 p.m. on Sunday. Admission is free, but donations are accepted. For 
information, call (714) 738-6595.

A new mystery dinner theater will open in Laguna Beach, its producers have 
announced. The venture, Laguna Mysteries Ltd., will debut on April 29 and is 
currently scheduled for Saturday night performances only. The first production, 
Julio Martinez's "The Laguna Baron," is about the unsolved murder of a 
millionaire Laguna Beach land developer. The audience will be guided through 
downtown Laguna by actors from the Comedy Company of Newport Beach, looking for 
clues at a bookstore, art gallery, several landmarks and Le Petit Gourmet 
restaurant, where they will dine and try to solve the crime. The three founders 
are Jules Swimmer, who owns the restaurant, and Mary Upchurch and Robert Brown, 
owners of Upchurch-Brown Booksellers store where some of the clues will be 
found. Laguna Mysteries is their first theatrical production. Audiences will be 
limited to 40 people. Tickets for the dinner and show are $48 per person. For 
information, call (714) 497-9742.

ARTS PANEL VOTES TO RESTORE $19,000 OPERA PACIFIC CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Opera Pacific stands to be $19,000 better off after the California Arts Council 
approved a new procedure Friday that would give back grant money it previously 
withheld. 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Mesa-based group won't get the money immediately because "there are 
absolutely no funds left in this year's budget," council director Robert Reid 
said Friday. But he added: "They will definitely get their grant money next 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Opera Pacific briefly had its Arts Council rating and accompanying grant amount 
reduced from $51,000 to $32,000 last year but won a reinstatement of the rating 
on appeal. It was the first time that a large-budget arts group had 
successfully appealed a council grant action. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Arts Council restored the company's rating, there was no mechanism 
for reinstating the portion of the grant that was withheld. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, at a regular meeting in Los Angeles, the council unanimously voted 
to adopt a measure that will, retroactively, allocate money to large-budget 
arts groups that successfully appeal Arts Council grant decisions. The money 
would come from any funds left in the budget at the end of the fiscal year, 
"which almost never happens," a staff member said. 
</P>
<P>
If there were no leftover funds, successful appeals would be placed in a 
priority position to have additional or reinstated monies awarded the following 
year -- contingent on the governor's approval of the council's budget. 
</P>
<P>
This would be in addition to whatever funds a group may be awarded in the 
regular course of that year through the CAC grant process. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing now standing between Opera Pacific and its $19,000 is the 
unlikely prospect that the governor would ax the Arts Council's budget 
entirely, or the entire allocation for large-budget ($1 million and over) 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
When the council took its vote, Opera Pacific managing director Martin Weil 
sighed and said, "Thank you," adding, "Hopefully, this will make it easier for 
other people in the same situation" to get grant money restored. 
</P>
<P>
"Until today, I wasn't counting on this money," said Weil, one of only about 
half a dozen members of the public who attended the meeting. "Now I'm counting 
on the money." 
</P>
<P>
The original rating and grant reduction centered on charges that the company 
used electronic amplification during opera productions. Upon appeal, Arts 
Council members decided that the charges were unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
Weil also took the opportunity to make a plea to the governor to change his 
mind about a proposed cut in the council's budget for next year. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the California Confederation of the Arts, of which he is 
a board member, Weil asked Gov. George Deukmejian to reconsider his proposed 
$3-million cut to the Arts Council's 1989-90 budget and approve, instead, an 
increase from the current $15.5 million to $17.8 million for the next budget 
year, which begins July 1.

How often have you been riding down the freeway, or a city street, and come 
upon something of strange color, shape and size? Upon closer inspection you 
realize -- yuk! -- it's a dead animal of some sort -- a real eye-opener, 
especially early in the morning. Then you drive by the same pile two or three 
consecutive days and wonder how long it will be before someone scrapes up the 
mess. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the only way anyone in a position to do something finds out about the 
problem is through a phone call. Maintenance crews are quite busy and do not 
necessarily know what remains. It's just not possible to patrol all the city 
streets, county roads and freeways in search of sail cats. 
</P>
<P>
The Caltrans maintenance office reports receiving 10-15 calls per week. Callers 
are usually women and are always very pleasant, if a little shocked at the 
sight on the road. Here's a handy reference list for when you come across a 
coyote carcass. Keep it in the glove compartment of your car. And the next time 
you see a dead animal on the road you can report it. 
</P>

Location: Northeast corner, Cal State Fullerton campus. 
</P>
<P>
Information: (714) 773-3579. 
</P>
<P>
Description: Gardens and a historical area are featured on the arboretum's 26 
acres. A waterfall, stream and ponds along the western side provide a moist 
environment for plants as well as a sanctuary for native birds, fish and pond 
turtles. There is also a small library of books and periodicals on botanical, 
horticultural and ecological subjects. 
</P>
<P>
Botanical collection: Unlike many other botanical gardens and arboreta, which 
group their plants by geographic origin, the Fullerton Arboretum has arranged 
its plantings by moisture requirements. Major areas include temperate, 
subtropical, desert, desert woodland and Mediterranean-type habitats. Other 
garden areas include the palm garden, the subtropical fruit grove, the conifer 
area, community gardens, a cactus and succulent garden, a carnivorous plant bog 
and a working apiary. 
</P>
<P>
Historical area: Heritage House, an example of Eastlake Victorian architecture, 
was built in 1894 for one of Fullerton's first physicians and was moved to the 
arboretum in 1972. It now serves as a museum of medical practice and family 
life at the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Programs: Guided tours, workshops, demonstrations, displays and seminars are 
planned throughout the year. Weekday group tours of the grounds or Heritage

Q My son found a ring in the park. We haven't had a jeweler look at it yet, but 
it appears to be valuable. Can we keep it?

A You obviously have a responsibility to return the ring to its owner if you 
know their identity. If you don't, and the value of the ring is $10 or more, 
you must turn it over to the police. If the ring is valued at $50 or more, and 
if the owner does not claim it within 90 days, the police must publish notice 
in a newspaper that it has been found. If the owner does not claim it within 7 
more days, you can have the ring if you pay the cost of publishing the notice. 
If the ring is worth less than $50, you may have the ring after 90 days without 
the published notice.

Q I have undergone a sex operation and had my name legally changed. I would 
like to change my birth certificate as well. How do I do this?

A If you have had surgery to alter your sex, you may obtain a new birth 
certificate to reflect the change and your new name. An application must be 
filed with the superior court of the county in which you live.

Q I agreed to sell my neighbor a car. I have always been worried about mixing 
money with friendship, so we wrote a contract to make sure that the sale would 
be handled as a business deal. Well, I should have listened to my instincts. My 
neighbor has not paid me. I will now have to sue him for the money. I am very 
angry and would like to sue him for as much as I can get to teach him a lesson. 
Someone told me that the law allows you to get money for that very purpose. Is 
that true?

A The type of damages to which you refer are called punitive or exemplary 
damages. They cannot be recovered on an action involving a breach of a 
contract. However, they can be recovered on other types of actions. You do not 
mention how expensive the car is or whether you plan to retain an attorney to 
represent you. If you do hire an attorney, you should discuss the possibility 
of suing on a basis under which you could ask for such damages.
