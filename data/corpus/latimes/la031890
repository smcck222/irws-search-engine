JAPAN AS NUMBER ONE...AND PULLING AWAY; 
</P>
<P>
THE END OF THE AMERICAN CENTURY BY STEVEN SCHLOSSTEIN (CONGDON &amp; WEED: 
$22.95; 537 PP.; 0-86553-201-0) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John H. Taylor, Taylor's second novel, Tribe of the Eagle, will be published 
this fall by Wynwood Press. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steven Schlosstein doesn't necessarily want a trade war with Japan, but he 
would settle for a cold war. "From now into the next century," he writes, "the 
ideological challenge to America will not be Communism . . . but a softer brand 
of authoritarianism from Japan . . . called turbocharged capitalism." 
</P>
<P>
He belongs neither to Richard Gephardt's school of losing through Japan-bashing 
(in 1988, at least) nor to the cadre of Japan-won't-change revisionists who 
oppose punishing our rivals for beating us fair and square. He does believe 
that the powerful, strategically directed, "goal-oriented" economies of Asia -- 
not only Japan but Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore -- could relegate the United 
States to the condition of a geopolitical and economic backwater in the next 
century. 
</P>
<P>
Avoiding this outcome, in his view, will require rigorous economic, political, 
educational and cultural reforms. A Sputnik-like scare, such as a recession, 
might also be needed to rouse the American people to the new international 
dangers they face even as the author of the old ones, the Soviet empire, 
finally implodes. 
</P>
<P>
The litany of national ills that Schlosstein recites, while increasingly 
familiar since Ezra F. Vogel kicked off the "Japan Is Number One" 11 years ago, 
is troubling indeed. Our eighth-graders score 12th in mathematics out of 14 
industrial nations. Our non-military Research and Development runs well behind 
Japan's, and our neglected manufacturing sector is lagging badly as well. Our 
"fiscally irresponsible Congress," paralyzed by the legal corruption of 
special-interest politics, is unable or unwilling to adopt measures to reduce 
the deficit, boost savings and provide the kind of incentives to strategic 
industries that the Japanese and Koreans do. 
</P>
<P>
Three-quarters of the education money we spend per student goes to entrenched 
bureaucrats rather than teachers. Meanwhile, American business has to spend $30 
billion a year on teaching high school graduates to read, write and add well 
enough to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
We have "the highest divorce rate in the industrialized world . . . (and) the 
largest ratio of single parents to traditional two-parent families," and our 
children are suffering greatly for it. Yes, the Reagan boom is booming away, 
but one of Schlosstein's Japanese authorities sums that up nicely: "Individual 
prosperity, national misery." 
</P>
<P>
Those most concerned with immediate social ills such as homelessness, ozone 
depletion and drug abuse will find little to inspire them here. Implicit in 
Schlosstein's analysis is that we will no longer be able to address such 
problems at all if we lose the capacity to create and preserve wealth. 
</P>
<P>
So how do we halt the ravages of our great-power malaise (what the Japanese 
call "the English disease")? He lays down brisk, confident prescriptions, as if 
writing editorials in the Economist, but there's not much about how to get from 
here to there. He concedes sotto voce that "we cannot emulate the Japanese; we 
must find our own flexible solutions to these problems." But this 
Japanese-educated writer and consultant finds so much to admire in the vibrant 
capitals of Japan and the Pacific's "Little Dragons" that one wonders whether 
in his heart of hearts he believes America is irredeemably wedded to its 
sloppy, self-indulgent ways. 
</P>
<P>
In the epilogue, basically an executive summary of the book, he waxes eloquent 
about America as "the most precious experiment in human history." And yet when 
he looks into our national petri dish he finds a disturbing amount of mold 
around the edges. For instance, he thinks the morally illegitimate American 
habit of nonchalant divorce is so damaging to the welfare of our children, 
those oft-heralded leaders of the future, that he wants to boost income-tax 
exemptions to keep Daddy at home and hit him with a penalty if he insists on 
leaving. Meanwhile, Mommy might lighten up on what one of the Bush kids once 
called "the Big A." 
</P>
<P>
In one of the author's many "We shouldn't emulate them, but dig this" passages, 
he reveals, "Asian cultures have a more tolerant view of sex. . . . Marital 
expectations are lower and the frustrations fewer, but appropriately controlled 
outlets are condoned and strictly monitored, from Turkish baths to love hotels. 
And mistresses, an established practice in old Europe, are still a favored 
tradition in Japan." 
</P>
<P>
As for the kids themselves, his investigations took him to schools all over 
Asia, and his heart went pitter-patter as the children of Singapore marched 
around in single file in their crisp cotton skirts and white shorts ("not 
shotgun-like, as one might expect of American youngsters") and the children of 
Taipei and Tokyo merrily scrubbed down their classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
No one who has stood in line behind a group of suburban American teen-agers at 
McDonald's and eavesdropped upon their tribal dialogues can help but share the 
author's concerns about the future custodians of Jefferson's covenant. Still, 
there is a grudging, even troubling admiration in Schlosstein's passages about 
Asian authoritarianism. He goes out of his way to excuse Lee Kwan Yew's limited 
tolerance of freedom of the press in Singapore, for instance, and is as 
supportive of Ferdinand Marcos' imposition of martial law in the Philippines in 
1972 as many other commentators were then (though they'd be loath to admit it 
now). 
</P>
<P>
Lee is one of the great nation-builders of our time, and Marcos at his best 
held out more hope to the Philippines than President Aquino's apparent 
capitulation to the oligarchic status quo. And yet neither offers America many 
applicable lessons, and America is the ostensible subject of Schlosstein's 
inquiry. If he did not want us to think Asian models deserved to be studied and 
even appropriated by the United States, one wonders why he devoted so much 
space to them. 
</P>
<P>
Just as none of our problems is of Asia's making, neither do Asian systems hold 
the answers. Unlike Japan and the Little Dragons, we are a sprawling, 
complicated, culturally and racially diverse nation whose principles of 
equality, justice and free enterprise never will be and need not be sacrificed 
at the altar of productivity. 
</P>
<P>
The only valuable thing the Far East can probably give us is as many of its 
people as it can spare. Already more than half our legal immigrants are Asian. 
If I were President Bush I would resolve to admit 2 million Hong Kong Chinese 
to the United States before 1997 -- when, Schlosstein believes, and diplomatic 
developments since he finished his book have seemed to confirm -- Beijing will 
smother the colony like a blanket. 
</P>
<P>
The author notes that "all eleven of New York's Westinghouse science finalists 
in 1988 were Asian-American. . . ." The operative word in that compound is 
"American," and therein must lie the solution to many of the problems he sets 
out so forcefully -- not so much in the importation of Asians, which sounds 
crass and mechanical, but the capacity for this nation to renew and redirect 
itself to address new challenges. 
</P>
<P>
The postwar boom that made America the world's most powerful and prosperous 
nation is over, and to sustain both our position and our values we must rise to 
the economic challenge being posed by our single-minded competitors in Asia. 
Those of us who have grown fat on America's postwar orgy of consumption might 
get back to fighting trim when confronted by a new wave of enthusiastic, highly 
skilled immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Schlosstein does not sit in his office and collate statistics; he travels 
widely and speaks to a broad array of authorities wherever he goes. What would 
otherwise be a dry book benefits greatly from his digressions and descriptions 
(although perhaps even George Will himself would recoil from the suggestion 
that he has a "patentable, boyish grin." 
</P>
<P>
He writes well, although in tackling everything from NATO to day care he makes 
a number of the generalist's small errors. For instance, Deng Xiaoping was many 
things but never premier of China; the United States was driven out of Vietnam 
in 1975, not 1974, and the "Soviets" didn't lose to the Japanese navy in 1905 
since Russians weren't Soviets until 1917. 
</P>
<P>
What Schlosstein knows all too well is our great new adversary. He includes a 
chilling account of a dinner he attended where some Mitsubishi executives burst 
into Imperial Japanese Navy marching songs. He even raises the specter of a 
newly militarized and even nuclearized Japan that might use its power against 
us. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many, however, he does not counsel fear, resentment or punitive 
sanctions; just discipline, so our economic health is not forever hostage to 
Japanese capital, and healthy competition. Indeed, how we handle our new 
adversary might well dictate the fortunes of our old one. Mikhail Gorbachev 
looks like a dove in Europe but a hawk in Asia, where he has been conducting a 
mighty military buildup even as he courts Japanese technology. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. protectionism could well plunge what is now the favored policy of a 
minority in Tokyo -- a turn toward Moscow for investment opportunities, 
resources, and new markets -- into the political mainstream. Gorbachev would 
like a neutral Germany, but he'd love a neutral Japan. If the protectionists 
get their way, he might get his.

TWINNING ART WITH EVIL; 
</P>
<P>
CHEKHOV'S SISTER A NOVEL BY W.D. WETHERELL (LITTLE, BROWN: $16.95; 288 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Roberta Smoodin, Smoodin is author of Inventing Ivanov. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
W.D. Wetherell's new novel, "Chekhov's Sister," is a meditation on the 
melancholy nature of the 20th Century, a time of brutality, alienation, a lack 
of human values: what the author calls the end of history. But he is not wholly 
without hope: The creation of art, and its subsequent preservation, is a record 
of mankind's soul, an expression of mankind's heart, and as long as these two 
organs remain alive, there exists a possibility of redemption from our sadness. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of the novel's action takes place in Yalta, during World War II. 
The Germans have invaded Russia, and all of the uncertainties of occupation 
prevail. Chekhov has been dead since 1904, yet, nearly 40 years later, his 
sister, Maria Pavlovna Chekhov, keeps a shrine to his life and art (a confusion 
that will put her in moral and physical jeopardy) at his home in Yalta, where 
his desk must be kept exactly as he liked it when he was alive -- his 
bookshelves undusted because this was the only way he could tell which books he 
hadn't recently read. 
</P>
<P>
Kunin, a young man with a club foot who aspires to being a writer but shows 
little talent or desire to practice his craft, helps Maria Pavlovna keep this 
sacred place along with her faithful Maid, Varka.A shadowy manservant, 
Gerassim, also helps, but without the dog-like spirit of the others: He has no 
difficulty hacking a portrait of Tolstoy to bits on the eve of the German 
occupation. 
</P>
<P>
When the Germans do arrive, Maria Pavlovna finds an ally in Nazi Minister of 
Culture Rene Diskau. Diskau had translated her brother's work into German, and 
now he seeks to stage a performance of "The Seagull" in an effort to win 
Russian minds and hearts. In her zeal to have the play once more performed, 
Maria Pavlovna does not question her seeming collaboration with the enemy; her 
devotion to one cause blinds her to the moral turpitude of her actions. 
</P>
<P>
But Diskau is not one of the faithful; instead, he represents, along with 
Gerassim (who turns out to be a Russian partisan), the world, or politics. 
These men lack human values, and live in a dangerous and deadly reality as 
separate from art as Maria Pavlovna is from political concerns. 
</P>
<P>
The play will go on after the importation of an actress to play Nina, a lovely, 
shimmering creature who has been rescued from an SS bordello for the part, who 
is dying of tuberculosis (as Chekhov himself did) and whose artistry cannot be 
questioned. She (and Chekhov) represent the third category of beings, those who 
are artists, and who, alone, have the ability to transcend base reality through 
the flights of their imaginations. They are the only ones without fierce tunnel 
vision, the ones who comprehend something broader, sadder, deeper about the 
human spirit. Of course, these three polarized groups will clash; of course, 
life will be lost, as the other "character," the 20th Century itself, propels 
them toward different types of destruction. 
</P>
<P>
The novel is beautifully, lyrically written, and in its questioning of what 
both art and reality are, its form as well as its content voices its concerns. 
Wetherell uses the play form, in four acts (like "The Seagull"), to begin 
sections of the book; he also uses dramatic monologue, remembrance and straight 
fictional narrative to clue us as to where he stands in the moral battle 
between art and reality, human values and politics. Its structure mirrors its 
themes, in a gorgeous stylistic symmetry, giving the novel more cohesion than 
most contemporary fiction. 
</P>
<P>
Art, Devotion, the World: Like a tarot deck of mysterious meaning, Wetherell's 
half-fictional realm (Chekhov really did have a sister; she really did preserve 
his final home as a museum) moves ineluctably toward its climax in a rhythmic 
river of narrative that is completely hypnotic. 
</P>
<P>
It is only at the end, when the narrative lets go, that questions arise, mostly 
about Maria Pavlovna herself, and the faithful as a group. Can collaboration 
ever be justified? Can art be twinned with pure evil and still remain an 
unsullied expression of the human spirit? Can art actually redeem the 20th 
Century? Finally, the concerns of the novel begin to seem precious and small 
when one thinks of the horrors of the time it documents; one performance of 
"The Seagull" cannot save the lives of millions in the concentration camps, 
cannot stop the inevitable cruelty of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Where Wetherell and his fine novel stand on this issue remains unclear, though 
this may be the only failing of this fascinating account of belief, 
disappointment, zealotry and the human soul.

RICHARD EDER: THE GREATEST WOMAN POET SINCE SAPPHO; 
</P>
<P>
THE COMPLETE POEMS OF ANNA AKHMATOVA TWO VOLUMES TRANSLATED BY JUDITH 
HEMSCHEMEYER, EDITED AND WITH AN INTRODUCTION BY ROBERTA REEDER (ZEPHYR PRESS: 
$85; 1,530 PP., ILLUSTRATED) 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The ship dwindles to the horizon and disappears; it is the watcher on the shore 
whose heart is shrunk by absence. The sailor, for better or worse, is where he 
is, life-size. 
</P>
<P>
The night of Stalin's repression has been told in all kinds of ways, most 
famously by Alexander Solzhenitsyn's books about the prison camps and their 
inmates. But in the literature of Soviet suffering there may be no pages more 
powerful than the cycle of poems by Anna Akhmatova entitled "Requiem." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing inside the prison walls so fiercely expresses deprivation and injustice 
-- with such a large intensity that it stands for an entire order of human loss 
-- as her chronicle of the women who stood, year after year, outside those 
walls. After the death of both hope and despair, they waited for word of the 
fate of those within, and for the chance to hand a knitted cap through, or a 
pair of shoes. Like the mothers of Argentina's Plaza de Mayo, years later, who 
turned the "disappeared" into a visible presence, the Russian women, by 
standing outside the city's jails, jailed the entire city: 
</P>
<P>
 "That was when the ones who smiled 
</P>
<P>
 Were the dead, glad to be at rest . . . 
</P>
<P>
 And like a useless appendage, Leningrad 
</P>
<P>
 Swung from its prisons." 
</P>
<P>
 It is quite reasonable to think of Akhmatova, who died in 1966 at age 76, as 
the greatest woman poet in the Western World since Sappho. In a monumental 
endeavor, seemingly poised upon the frailest of underpinnings, the tiny Zephyr 
Press of Somerville, Mass., has brought out the first complete collection of 
her poems published anywhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
With original Russian versions and a supple translation that all but turns the 
facing pages warm to the touch, the two-volume edition, more than 1,500 pages 
in length, includes more than 700 poems -- some previously unprinted -- copious 
notes, several introductions, prefaces and memoirs, and about 75 photographs 
and drawings. 
</P>
<P>
Among the introductory materials are recollections by the poet Anatoly Naiman, 
one of Akhmatova's proteges, and Sir Isaiah Berlin, whose visit to Akhmatova in 
1945 stirred up a mix of platonic and prophetic passions. Her poems reflecting 
the visit are firestorms: 
</P>
<P>
 "For a while you were my Aeneas -- 
</P>
<P>
 It was then I escaped by fire. 
</P>
<P>
 We know how to keep quiet about one another. 
</P>
<P>
 And you forgot my cursed house. 
</P>
<P>
 You forgot those hands stretched out to you 
</P>
<P>
 In horror and torment, through flame, 
</P>
<P>
 And the report of blasted dreams . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Sir Isaiah's memoir, in almost comic contrast, is a mixture of awe and 
reticence. 
</P>
<P>
Roberta Reeder, who edited the collection and the notes, contributes a 
monograph placing the poems in their historical and biographical context. 
Judith Hemschemeyer, the translator, provides additional commentary. Among her 
perceptive remarks is the point that Akhmatova's poetry, unlike that of many of 
her contemporaries, nearly always addresses a second person, explicitly or 
implicitly. The reader receives this burning gaze face to face. 
</P>
<P>
Hemschemeyer's translations are not simply a work but a pilgrimage. A poet, she 
read a few of Akhmatova's poems in translation about 25 years ago. She then 
learned Russian so that, with the help of word-by-word literal versions, she 
could translate them all. "I became convinced that Akhmatova's poems should be 
translated in their entirety and by a woman, and that I was that person," she 
writes. 
</P>
<P>
Akhmatova's imperial largeness of spirit is catching, clearly. So is a portion 
of her art. Hemschemeyer chose a very direct rendering, stressing clarity, 
intimacy and an unforced syntax over any effort to pursue the original's rhymes 
and sonorities. But she uses assonance and slant rhyme, and her seeming plain 
style is governed by a lyrical ear. In truth, her translations are not so much 
plain as transparent. If I did not know English, I would learn it to read them. 
</P>
<P>
Akhmatova's life and her poetry were brutally cut in two by history. Born to a 
well-to-do family, living a privileged childhood, she became a glittering 
figure in the Bohemian literary world of pre-revolutionary St. Petersburg. She 
was a member of the Acmeist circle of poets -- Osip Mandelstam, her lifelong 
brother in poetry and suffering, was another -- and her first husband was a 
poet. 
</P>
<P>
She was a flaming creature. Taking into account her bipolar candle-burning, and 
the long purgatory she underwent later on, one thinks of Edna St. Vincent 
Millay turned into Mother Courage. Except that the poetry of her youth, hugely 
successful, was also incomparably better. She wrote of childhood, of the 
countryside, of the city, and of all varieties of love from girlish to adult 
and adulterous. 
</P>
<P>
She had a blinding sense of place and time. She fused the richness of things 
and passions with a premonition -- and later, the memory -- of their 
transience. Thus, an early poem evokes her sumptuous childhood garden together 
with a stone bust, toppled beside the water: 
</P>
<P>
 "He has given his face to the waters of the lake/And he's listening to the 
green rustling./And bright rainwater washes/His clotted wound . . ./Cold one, 
white one, wait,/I'll become marble too." 
</P>
<P>
 There is the young girl considering her new-found sexuality: 
</P>
<P>
 "In my room lives a beautiful/Slow black snake;/It is like me, just as 
lazy,/Just as cold . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The quick desolation of an early marriage: 
</P>
<P>
 "The heart's memory of the sun grows faint./The grass is yellower./A few early 
snowflakes blow in the wind,/Barely, barely . . ./The willow spreads its 
transparent fan/Against the empty sky./Perhaps I should not have become/Your 
wife . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The excitement and insomnia of an affair: 
</P>
<P>
 "Both sides of the pillow/Are already hot./Now even the second candle/Is going 
out, and the cry of the crows/Gets louder and louder./I haven't slept all 
night/And now it's too late to think of sleep .../How unendurably white/Is the 
blind on the white window./Hello." 
</P>
<P>
 There was the pride of a woman and a poet in her prime, addressing a no doubt 
not imaginary lover: 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh it was a cold day/In Peter's miraculous city./Like a crimson fire the 
sunset lay,/And slowly the shadow thickened./Let him not desire my 
eyes,/Prophetic and fixed./He will get a whole lifetime of poems/The prayer of 
my arrogant lips." 
</P>
<P>
 The revolution came, and suddenly poverty gnawed away her life and, worse, her 
writing went out of favor. Poetry had to be hard and elevating. By 1925, the 
literary leaders were saying that she should have had the intelligence to be 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
Hardship and the impossibility of publishing; expulsion from the Writers Union. 
Worse was to come. The purges of the mid-1930s spared her, but her only son, 
Lev, was arrested. For a year-and-a-half, she joined the lines outside the 
Leningrad prison. And, in "Requiem," she found a voice again: harsh with 
knowledge, powerful with anger, yet with all the lovely particularity of her 
youth. Here, for example, comes word of the sentencing: 
</P>
<P>
 "And the stone word fell/On my still-living breast./Never mind, I was ready./I 
will manage somehow./Today I have so much to do:/I must kill memory once and 
for all,/I must turn my soul to stone/I must learn to live again -- 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless . . . Summer's ardent rustling/Is like a festival outside my 
window./For a long time I've foreseen this/Brilliant day, deserted house." 
</P>
<P>
 The introduction to this molten cycle is a paragraph of prose. 
</P>
<P>
A woman in line behind her, she writes, "woke up from the stupor to which 
everyone had succumbed and whispered in my ear (everyone spoke in whispers 
there): 
</P>
<P>
" 'Can you describe this?' 
</P>
<P>
"And I answered: 'Yes, I can.' 
</P>
<P>
"Then something that looked like a smile passed over what had once been her 
face." 
</P>
<P>
Bowed down with personal tragedy that is the tragedy of a nation, perhaps of 
the world, the poet answers: "Yes, I can." She could.

IN THE PURPLE SAGE, A TREASURE HUNT; 
</P>
<P>
SILVER LIGHT BY DAVID THOMSON (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $19.95; 328 PP.; 0-394-55622-4)

<TEXT>
<P>
Do the characters from Westerns have a life off-screen? Not just the easy ones, 
Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson, the hanging Judge Roy Bean and Billy the Kid and 
Pat Garrett -- everyone knows they really lived, before myth wrapped round them 
like kudzu. 
</P>
<P>
But how about "Red River's" Matthew Garth and "The Searchers' " Ethan Edwards; 
how about Ransom Stoddard and Tom Doniphon and Liberty Valance from "The Man 
Who Shot Liberty Valance," or James Averill and Nate Champion from "Heaven's 
Gate"? Screenwriters created them; actors inhabited them; directors browbeat or 
cajoled them into their particular vision. Did they fade away when the 
projectors stopped? 
</P>
<P>
Not for David Thomson. To him they are as real as John Wayne's sweat-stained 
Stetson, and their women are too. So for "Silver Light," Thomson's intricate, 
hypnotic history/romance about the Old West and how we have come to perceive 
it, he dips into the pool of common movie experience and into his own 
imagination equally, ladling out characters who are a brash mixture of both. 
</P>
<P>
Thus one of the pillars of his story is Susan Garth, who in the 1950s is 80 
years old, a possibly great undiscovered photographer. It is her memories that 
carry the narrative back to the 1860s. She lives in splendid isolation at 
Arizona's Canyon de Chelly, near Monument Valley, the most movie-exploited land 
in the world. And although no one will be blamed for reading a little of 
Georgia O'Keeffe into Susan Garth's character, she is actually the daughter of 
the movies' Matthew Garth, forever and indelibly Montgomery Cliff in "Red 
River," and he will become a central character on these pages as well. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is Susan Garth's lifelong friend, Bark Blaylock, wholly created by 
Thomson. He's a journalist, writer, young witness to the death of Billy the Kid 
and part-time technical adviser on Hollywood Westerns, who may have been the 
son of Wyatt Earp. Or Bat Masterson. Or the cowboy "Curly Bill" Brocius. All of 
them real enough Westerners. 
</P>
<P>
Nora Stoddard, the provocative, prescient young Santa Fe museum curator who 
discovers Susan Garth, seems to be at the book's center. Much of the 
present-day story is concerned with the attraction that springs up between the 
well-born Nora and James Averill II, the 50-year-old, casually philandering 
Eastern philanthropist who heads the Averill Foundation, to which Nora applies 
for backing of a show of Susan Garth's work. 
</P>
<P>
(And if the first James Averill was played by Kris Kristofferson in "Heaven's 
Gate," Nora carries an equally heavy movie heritage. Her father was the late 
Sen. Ransom Stoddard, a.k.a. James Stewart, who did or did not shoot Liberty 
Valance in the movie of nearly the same name.) 
</P>
<P>
To Thomson's wide-ranging, sometimes arcane cast of film characters throw in 
Charles Ives, on the occasion of the first performance of his "Three Places in 
New England"; Willa Cather; alto-sax great Wardell Grey and Erich von Stroheim, 
hard at work on "Greed" in the furnaces of the desert. 
</P>
<P>
This technique, mixing and matching real and fictional characters, has been a 
staple of E. L. Doctorow's; Gore Vidal pioneered a similar sort of legerdemain 
years ago, but Thomson's movie-critic credentials lead him to draw primarily 
from films. He played a simpler version of this game once before, with 
"Suspects." There he prowled in and out of the lives of more than 80 movie 
characters, filling in details of their lives off-screen with the fevered 
imagination of an over-the-moon movie buff. 
</P>
<P>
"Silver Light" is more ambitious than "Suspects," harder to sustain, with a 
panoramic narrative that whips us back and forth in time. For the most part 
it's done dexterously, although when one of the characters, referring to some 
mischief Wyatt Earp is up to, says, "I believe he has done for some of those 
boys. There are bodies in the corral," there is an almost irresistible impulse 
to shout, "OK!!" if only to show that we're paying attention. 
</P>
<P>
The writing, admittedly, strays into the purple and the unintentionally silly 
at moments: Averill with Nora in bed, "looking down on the closed eyes of Nora 
Stoddard, and on the hills of her, all blindly witnessing him," or 15-year-old 
Sally Averill hearing her first Charlie Parker, live, in 1950: "She cannot stop 
moving to the music, keep up, keep on, the beat, bop. She notices that her body 
keeps the bass time . . . while her fingers and her hands are playing out the 
notes of the saxophones and the vibraphone." Busy girl. 
</P>
<P>
However this is more than balanced by the book's Byzantine and eventually 
seductive design and characters, so deftly and imaginatively interwoven that 
finally there is nothing left to do but surrender to them. 
</P>
<P>
To the astringent Susan Garth, and Thomson's wonderful sequence in an abandoned 
silver mine in which her own image imprints itself on a piece of silver left 
behind by a miner -- and photography as her calling is as deeply imprinted on 
the young girl. 
</P>
<P>
To a masterly thunderstorm sequence, after which young Bark Blaylock fords the 
Pecos river on horseback. 
</P>
<P>
And to a picaresque subplot about Jack Chance, a sweet-natured young 
middleweight managed by Blaylock, who must be goaded to anger to fight, and 
Bark's scheme to get him mad by flirting with Chance's widowed mother. One can 
put up with a bit of purple, when the rewards are this good. 
</P>
<P>
Sensibly, the novel doesn't demand that we have the author's passion for its 
movies, or even know all of them. (The discovery of an index at the end of the 
book to every film character was an enormous relief.) Obviously it makes a 
novelist's job easier when a character is called Ethan Edwards, and when John 
Wayne shimmers to mind, doggedly searching through the years for a child 
carried off by Comanches. 
</P>
<P>
But if "The Searchers" isn't in our memory banks, "Silver Light" still works. 
Thomson remains true to Ethan Edwards, or to Wayne's image of him as stamped by 
John Ford, who will flicker into the story briefly too, as one of two 
curmudgeonly directors, "Jack" and "Howard" (Hawks). 
</P>
<P>
Curious, Thomson follows "The Searchers' " characters after the film leaves 
them. What would have happened to Deborah, the young woman Ethan Edwards 
rescued after more than a decade with the Comanches, half-deranged with not 
knowing what people she belonged to. The book imagines Deborah's later child, 
beautiful, headstrong and not a little spooked by her mother's history. This is 
Sharon Pawley, who will become the love of both Bark and Susan's life, a 
natural magnet for a movie camera and the star of Bark's primitive version of 
"Tess of the D'Urbervilles," shot in 1915 in Northern California, with none 
other than Susan Garth behind the camera. 
</P>
<P>
Can't remember that silent film? Ah, that's because of the chicanery of Noah 
Cross, decades before his appearance in "Chinatown," in the person of John 
Huston. It's another of the interlocking bits that makes "Silver Light" the 
treasure hunt that it is. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing predictable about the book is that it won't make a great movie. 
It already has -- about a dozen of them.

Barbara Grizzuti Harrison wants to be Gore Vidal. Her profile on him screams it 
from every pretentious line. 
</P>
<P>
I personally am not an admirer of anyone -- Vidal or Harrison -- whose ego so 
obviously exceeds his talent. Vidal's own utterances reveal him for what he is. 
Harrison's rhetoric trivializes her own intentions. 
</P>
<P>
I did, however, read to the end of the article, which tells you something about 
me.

STORYTELLERS: NEW IN APRIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON G. CAMPBELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Competence, yes. Professionalism, of course. But there's the mysterious other 
ingredient -- the flair -- that spells the real difference. This is what 
separates the writer of popular fiction who commands the high-six-figure 
advances from the rest of us. But whether the flair evolves gradually over a 
number of works or whether it bursts into full flower on the strength of one or 
two novels is the eternal fascination. And the current crop is an interesting 
balance of old hands, and relatively new ones, with the flair already firmly in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
After a six-year silence, fans of Arthur Hailey should be happy to see the 
meticulous researcher/storyteller back in harness with The Evening News 
(Doubleday: $21.95; 576 pp.). Just as "Airport," "Hotel" and "Wheels" stripped 
the mystery away from the air travel, hotel and automotive industries, so does 
Hailey's latest novel take us behind the scenes of a major television network 
news operation at a time of both internal and external crisis. 
</P>
<P>
In today's society where a network anchorman may have a greater name, and face, 
recognition than most international political leaders, the plight of cool and 
heretofore unflappable Crawford Sloane when terrorists zero in on his family 
makes for high drama. Calling upon long-time colleague and ace war 
correspondent Harry Partridge for assistance may be the most natural thing in 
the world, but it's sticky, too -- the two men are not only on-again, 
off-again, rivals for precious air time since they covered Vietnam together, 
but the terrorist attack on Sloane's family focuses on the lovely Jessica, 
Sloane's wife and Partridge's one-time lover (and still, at least with 
Partridge, a delicate and sensitive issue). 
</P>
<P>
As CBA-TV News throws its worldwide resources into the seemingly 
needle-in-a-haystack search for the terrorist-kidnapers, strains within the 
organization, newly acquired by an international conglomerate, also reach the 
breaking point as the power-hungry, hard-as-nails, president of the network, 
Margot Lloyd-Mason, weighs human lives against the parent firm's global 
financial interests and -- as is usual with her -- opts for the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
Flitting between New York and its suburbs and the steamy jungles of Peru, "The 
Evening News" is a fast-paced, hide-and-seek story as the CBA-TV news team 
finds itself fighting terrorists who are every bit as faceless as, and only 
slightly less treacherous than, the corporate villains undermining the team's 
effort from within. A few loose ends are never quite resolved, but the climax 
in "The Evening News" is a dandy. The novel is a Literary Guild Main Selection. 
</P>
<P>
What did poor old, much-maligned Hollywood do to deserve the barbed attention 
of Judith Rossner? In His Little Women (Summit Books: $19.95; 366 pp.), 
Rossner, probably best remembered for her moody exploration of self-destruction 
in "Looking for Mr. Goodbar," turns a jaundiced eye on Tinsel Town as 
exemplified by producer Sam Pearlstein and his four daughters by three 
different wives as they vie for their easily distracted father's attention. 
</P>
<P>
But the focal point is the love-hate relationship between the two oldest 
daughters, the irreverent, rowdy and talented Louisa and Nell, a lawyer and her 
father's favorite (when it occurs to him to have a favorite). At the heart of 
the matter is Louisa's best-selling novel about a Hollywood producer, a book 
that triggers a libel suit that threatens the Pearlsteins' fortunes and prompts 
Nell, via "His Little Women," to write her own version of what really happened. 
</P>
<P>
Alternately brittle and tongue-in-cheek, Rossner has many wise things to say 
about the offhandedness of love and family relationships in Hollywood; about 
the hedonism that surrounds the movie industry, and about the practice of law 
when the throats of the rich and famous are on the chopping block. Rossner's 
novel is a Literary Guild Main Selection. 
</P>
<P>
For an almost jarring change of pace -- as far away from Hollywood, 
geographically, as you can get and even further away in casting -- turn your 
attention to Ya Ding's absorbing story of life during Chairman Mao's Cultural 
Revolution, The Earth Sings, translated by Jon Rothschild (Harcourt Bruce 
Jovanovich: $21.95; 224 pp.). A best- seller in France, where the young Chinese 
novelist now lives, "The Earth Sings" is a slice of life in rural China as seen 
through the eyes of 9-year-old Liang, a bright little boy with infinite faith 
in his family and a beguiling acceptance of that family's dedication to the 
harsh Communist doctrines laid out in Mao's Little Red Book. 
</P>
<P>
Ardent Communists themselves, Liang's young parents are dispatched from Beijing 
to a primitive peasant village to "modernize" it -- a neat trick, as the "old 
ways" -- reverence for ancestors, superstitions and ceremonies -- clash with 
Mao's teachings. Rebelling, subtly, while at the same time appearing to 
conform, the villagers are hard nuts to crack and, as was apparently par for 
the course during the Cultural Revolution, Liang's father ultimately falls from 
grace with the party leadership and is jailed. 
</P>
<P>
When the father ultimately is freed, the family trudges on with even fewer 
possessions to even poorer villages, still spreading Mao's word. It is a 
touching story of old and new beliefs clashing in an exercise of what history 
later demonstrated was a political tilting at windmills that was doomed from 
the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"Sweeping" is the first adjective that comes to mind with Michael Petersons' A 
Time of War (Pocket Books Hardcover: $19.95; 580 pp.). This big novel, while 
going over ground that has become familiar -- the Vietnam War -- may have put 
that sad conflict into clearer perspective than most, if not all, of its 
predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
This is the story of Bradley Marshall, a personal "ambassador" of beleaguered 
Lyndon B. Johnson, sent to Vietnam in '67 and '68 to find some graceful way out 
of that mess. What Marshall uncovers, alas, is what most of us now concede was 
the true horror of that war: treachery rampant among political factions within 
our own government and among hangers-on from the days of French rule; the 
cynical buying and selling of information and misinformation; the numbing 
lethargy of American officers become hardened to the task of sending their 
young wards into suicidal engagements that they know are suicidal. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson's story, which some reviewers have compared -- and not inappropriately 
-- to Norman Mailer's "The Naked and the Dead" and Herman Wouk's "The Winds of 
War," is a sprawling and compelling narrative that blends fiction with such 
real-life players of the era as L.B.J. and Gen. William Westmoreland. But as 
fiction alone, "A Time of War" is a blood-chilling adventure story. 
</P>
<P>
As our protagonist, Marshall, finds himself the target of forces within Vietnam 
who know his mission and who know that only his elimination can assure 
continuation of the deadly, hypocritical, game of the no-win war. Locales range 
from the Oval Office through the jungle outposts of Khe Sanh to the squalor of 
Saigon's Chinese quarters in this brilliant second effort by the author of 
1983's "The Immortal Dragon." 
</P>
<P>
In a popular fiction field that teeters on the brink of overkill in the 
international-intrigue department, it is refreshing to pick up a new work that 
reminds us of how it should be done. Enter Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Ultimatum 
(Random House: $21.95; 640 pp.). 
</P>
<P>
What separates successful international intrigue from its imitators are the 
characters -- living and breathing heroes and villains alike, with whom we 
instantly relate. The art of the craft, as Ludlum once again demonstrates, is 
not only the step-by-step progression of many characters but the delineation of 
each, so he remains indelibly etched in our memory even as the plot speeds on. 
</P>
<P>
This, of course, is the third Bourne novel ("The Bourne Identity" and "The 
Bourne Supremacy" preceding it), and we pick up Prof. David Webb, staid and 
proper family man, comfortably ensconced in academia when, abruptly, he finds 
himself once more thrust into his old role in Vietnam and Hong Hong as the 
assassin Jason Bourne. It's a wrenching return for a middle-aged university 
professor, but since the evil apparatus, Medusa, and his archenemy Carlos are 
hell-bent on one last extermination effort, it is a matter of pure survival -- 
and are those now-aging muscles and reflexes up to the task? 
</P>
<P>
"The Bourne Ultimatum" dances from Washington to the Caribbean to Europe and 
Russia, and in the pulse-tingling style that began so many years ago with "The 
Scarlatti Inheritance," we are caught up irretrievably.Michael Peterson on the 
DMZ in 1968.ONOFRIO PACCIONE

I suspected that Vidal, based on his behavior I've witnessed over the years via 
television, was a bit pompous. 
</P>
<P>
However, Harrison is the pretentious one, with her use of obscure words 
(jejune, probity, prescient). My favorite sentence: "Surely his woulds have had 
time to heal? They suppurate." I found Harrison's article revealing and 
entertaining, yet I got tired of having to stop so often to consult my 
dictionary.

The homey odors of the Irish countryside permeate Carlo Geb-ler's coming-of-age 
story. After his mother's death, 10-year-old Paul Weissmann is sent from his 
father's home in London to his grandparents' farm. 
</P>
<P>
His gentle grandmother channels all her pent-up affection into her love for 
him; his grandfather is a hard man who treats Paul only slightly less harshly 
than he does his wife. But the grandfather's drunken binges teach Paul things 
he otherwise never would have learned, opening his eyes to the darker realities 
of life: to cheating, degradation, the dark power of alcoholism and, 
ultimately, death, when the old man's neglected cigarette burns down the family 
farmhouse. Gebler evokes the lilt of Irish speech without stooping to the 
cliches of writing in dialect.

Zheng Yi's uncompromising novel is a fascinating portrait of rural life in 
contemporary China, where ancient traditions -- including the worship of 
ancestral gods -- coexist with modern technology and bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
Although he is educated and industrious, Sun Wangquan leads a bleak existence, 
scarcely different from that of his peasant ancestors, who dug wells for their 
tiny village in the arid Taihang mountains in Shanxi province. 
</P>
<P>
The search for a reliable source of water becomes a search for meaning as 
Wangquan finds himself torn between the traditional values represented by his 
loveless arranged marriage and his passion for a restless, free-spirited modern 
girl. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the international reputation of his novels and his screenplay for the 
film of "Old Well," Zheng Yi was arrested in July, 1989, and reportedly remains 
in custody.

Languid, sultry and rum-soaked, Bob Shacochis' stories capture the heady

</P>
<P>
The title story, about the proprietor of a broken-down hotel who finds himself 
stuck with his mother's corpse in the freezer, is reminiscent of a "Fawlty 
Towers" episode. A petty grifter, who gets into trouble when he tries to go 
jogging, extricates himself through his improbably lofty connections in the 
weirder "Hot Day on the Gold Coast." The most impressive story in this mixed 
collection is "Lord Short Shoe Wants the Monkey," a cautionary tale about a 
reggae musician who slyly exploits a conniving white man's lust to achieve his 
aims.

CITIZEN KAREEM'S FIRST YEAR ON THE SIDELINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, Sam McManis covers the Lakers for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Summer had turned to fall and, while his former Laker teammates were pounding 
the court, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was digging his toes into the warm sand of 
Kauai. 
</P>
<P>
"I really had absolutely nothing to do in September and October last year," he 
says. "I was over there in Hawaii and just hung out. Geez, it's been at least 
since my freshman year at UCLA that my activities haven't been dictated by the 
schedule." 
</P>
<P>
Retired as Laker center after 20 NBA seasons, Abdul-Jabbar, 42, seems to have 
made a smooth transition from sports icon to private citizen. He has spent more 
time with his children, redecorated his Bel-Air home, added a tennis court to 
his Kauai home and learned to ski in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar shares custody of 9-year-old Amir, his younger son, every other 
month with Amir's mother, Cheryl Jenkins, who lives in Los Angeles. He shuttles 
Amir to school, helps him with his homework and works out with him. 
Abdul-Jabbar also visits his 13-year-old son, Kareem, who plays city league 
basketball, and his daughters, Habiba, 17, and Sultana, 10, who also live in 
Los Angeles with their mother, Habiba Herbert. 
</P>
<P>
But father is not the only role Abdul-Jabbar has played since retiring. Last 
month, he appeared on Fox's "21 Jump Street" as an athletic director trying to 
clean up a college athletics scandal. He intends to take acting classes and 
hopes to land more serious roles, but he acknowledges that being 7 feet 2 and 
immediately recognizable makes him prone to typecasting. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar also is taking advantage of endorsement opportunities now that he 
no longer collects his $3-million annual salary. He remains a spokesman for 
L.A. Gear, the apparel company that sponsored his farewell tour. His name soon 
will grace a line of socks and a toy replica that shoots skyhooks. 
</P>
<P>
Although he stays fit by attending yoga classes, he has no desire to make a 
comeback, even in an old-timers' game. He says he'll resurface occasionally, as 
he will Tuesday night when the Lakers retire his jersey at halftime during a 
game against the Charlotte Hornets. And, as part of a consulting agreement with 
the Lakers, he helps train Vlade Divac, the rookie center from Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar hasn't attended a Laker game this season and watches his old team 
on television only occasionally. He hasn't grown tired of the sport; he simply 
wants a break from it. "I've experienced all of the most important moments of 
the game, in college and the pros," he says. "So, I've lived the dream. There's 
no sense of discovery anymore. But it still is a great game, and I'm happy it 
was part of my life."

What Abdul-Jabbar says he misses most is the Laker players. "You're kind of 
like a family," he says. "That's a special element of playing pro ball, and you 
do miss those attachments." 
</P>
<P>
But he won't miss the travel schedule of the NBA. Later this month, when he 
embarks on an extensive tour to promote his new book, the pace will be 
leisurely in comparison. "It's going to be easy," he says. "It'll be through 
before 5 in the afternoon, and I won't have to play any basketball games."

HARD-EDGED MINIMALISM MAKES WAY FOR FURNITURE IN UNDULATING FORMS AND BAROQUE 
FABRICS -- AN ART NOUVEAU FOR THE 1990S 
</P>

TODAY'S NEWEST FURNITURE ripples and rolls with soft, undulating profiles: wavy 
sofa backs, wiggly-legged tables and crescent-shaped chairs. It's a signal that 
the hard-edged minimalism that has reigned over interior design for the past 
three decades is tentatively giving way to curvilinear forms not seen since art 
nouveau flourished at the last turn-of-the-century. 
</P>
<P>
This new furniture is emerging worldwide, but Southern California designers are 
in the vanguard of the movement. Jill Sharp-Miller's Sexy Bunny love seat, with 
its shimmering fabric and rounded silhouette, epitomizes the free-form style 
that looks to the future while borrowing heavily from the past. The recamier 
base and horn-shaped legs are retro touches, but with a lighthearted, Space Age 
twist. Says Sharp-Miller: "I want people to come home to a sofa that makes them 
smile." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Totah, whose small, visionary line has been on the market for three 
years, believes that "furniture in the '90s is warming up. The form is more 
sumptuous. People want something more romantic, more inviting to sit in." The 
undulating contours of his Cake Sofa and Jack Chair recall the work of 
Barcelona-based, art nouveau architect Antonio Gaudi. On the international 
scene, French designers Andree Putman and Philippe Starck are introducing 
baroque -- that is, curvaceous and decorative -- elements into their work. 
"It's something we would both not have done five years ago," Putman says. 
</P>
<P>
 Marie Christine Dorner, a French designer whose work is prominently displayed 
at the Massini showroom in the Pacific Design Center, decries "the tough, 
hard-shaped furniture" of the recent past and instead produces designs 
reminiscent of art nouveau. In describing her lyrical furniture, she says: 
"Nature is not geometric. When you see a tree or rock, the lines are not 
straight. I create unusual asymmetrical forms that are not easily understood; 
they are like the forms in a dream."

reds, greens and golds -- are the new vogue. Shari Rezai, owner of Mirak 
Textile, designed this new collection with French architect Jean Michel 
Wilmotte. Likewise, designer Andree Putman favors "odd colors such as saffron 
and crimson -- not bright primary colors like red and yellow. Only Mondrian 
could use those." Also fashionable are iridescent-pearl colors and fabrics that 
appear to be metallic without actually using metallic fibers. Mirak Textiles,

LOOKS: THE STAR TREATMENT; 
</P>
<P>
STYLIST LORI DAVIS GIVES FAMOUS CLIENTS HIGH-PROFILE HAIR COLOR, PERMS AND CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
HOLLY HUNTER sits in the beauty shop chair, staring into the mirror and 
contemplating several hair styles. The actress is trying to find the best look 
for her next film, "Once Around," with Richard Dreyfuss. "Lori, whaddya think?" 
she asks in her decidedly Southern drawl. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a new question to hairdresser Lori Davis, who colors, perms and 
cuts the hair of many a Hollywood star. In addition to Hunter, Davis' clients 
include Meryl Streep, who visits between films to have her natural pale-blond 
color restored; Cher, who comes in for perms, and Bette Midler, who had her 
hair dyed red for "Beaches" and blond for "Stella." 
</P>
<P>
But Davis' work isn't limited to women. Arnold Schwarzenegger has been a 
regular at Lori Davis Hair Doctor since his "Conan the Barbarian" days. Nick 
Nolte insists on having Davis flown to his film locations to match his hair 
color and style to his role. Sean Penn and Tom Cruise drop in for trims. And 
"Cheers" star Ted Danson, who gets a Davis cut and conditioning every two 
weeks, comes in for color as well when he needs it for film work. "To make his 
hair look its natural shade on the big screen," Davis says, "we have to make it 
a little darker than how he wears it on television." 
</P>
<P>
Davis may handle more superstar tresses on a regular basis than any other salon 
stylist in Southern California, yet she manages to do so without Tinseltown 
trappings. In fact, her salon is pure down-home. "They (celebrities) don't come 
here for ambiance," says Davis, her own long, blond hair framing her face. The 
16x16-foot room she rents in the Brentwood Continental salon in West Los 
Angeles is separated from the rest of the shop by a rattling, wooden sliding 
door. Paper teddy bears festoon the mirror. Davis' cosmetology licenses, 
plaques with cute sayings and a promotional photo signed "with love" from 
Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito (who, she says, met in her salon) adorn the 
walls. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the actors and actresses who come to this funky little workroom to 
entrust their hair to Davis have been referred by other actors or by studio 
hairdressers, who also depend on Davis' expertise with color and other chemical 
hair treatments. "My hair was destroyed after I did 'Miss Firecracker,' " 
Hunter recalls, "and Lori saved it." During the making of that film about three 
years ago, Hunter's hair was dyed red several times, which stripped it of its 
moisture and sheen. So Davis restored the actress's natural shade of brown and 
used deep conditioners to bring back its soft texture. "She's been with me ever 
since," Davis says. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Davis introduced her own line of hair-care products, Designers' Mane 
Collection, which uses many of the same formulas she has applied on her famous 
clients. The stars can buy her products in her workroom; the products are 
available to the public at Frends Beauty Supply Co. in North Hollywood and 
through mail-order. 
</P>
<P>
For many celebrities, Davis has found, extra conditioning is important. NBC 
news correspondent Maria Shriver gets frequent moisturizing treatments to keep 
her hair shiny under drying studio lights. "Cheers" star Rhea Perlman's hair 
requires constant care to keep it looking curly rather than out of control. 
"Now that it's shoulder length, she has versatility," Davis explains, "but 
keeping it shiny requires regular deep-conditioning." 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, stars will ask Davis for a totally new look. If they are between 
films or TV shows, she'll indulge the whim. For instance, about five years ago, 
she transformed Cher's dark mane to "a punked-out blond," Davis remembers. "We 
cut it all off into a crew cut and bleached it almost white, but that meant 
constant touch-ups. Unless you have plenty of time for upkeep, going from dark 
brown to blond is torture -- and expensive." She gave Cher the same advice she 
gives other brunettes: "Don't be a blonde unless you can afford the time and 
money to touch up every two weeks." Cher was back to her natural brown in less 
than six months. 
</P>
<P>
Davis calls herself one of a vanishing breed of hairdressers: "You know, the 
ones who do everything -- without assistants -- who shampoo and color and perm 
and cut." She does concede, though, that she doesn't do blow-dries: "After 23 
years with a hairbrush in my hand, my wrists hurt." But it doesn't seem to 
matter because Davis' cuts fall perfectly into place as clients wield their own 
hair dryers, and the color of their locks shines so naturally that one wonders 
if Davis ever, well, goofs. 
</P>
<P>
"No, honey, I don't fail," she says. "If I were to fail, I'd fail big."

Peter O'Toole joins previously-cast John Goodman in Universal's "King Ralph," 
scheduled to film in the U.K. in mid-April. The comedy's based on a novel, 
"Headlong," by the late Welsh actor-writer Emlyn Williams, which has the entire 
Royal Family wiped out in an electrical storm during the photographing of a 
family portrait. A trace of the royal bloodline leads to Goodman, a Las Vegas 
lounge pianist. O'Toole will play royal secretary to the new, improbable King 
of England. David S. Ward writes and directs. Then, in July, Goodman reunites 
with filmmakers Ethan and Joel Coen for "Barton Fink," a '40s murder mystery in 
which Goodman will play a Hollywood screenwriter from Kansas City. He last 
worked with the writing-producing-directing Coen brothers team on "Raising 
Arizona." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Isabella Rossellini has landed the lead role in Imagine Entertainment's "Closet 
Land," written and to be directed by Radha Bharadwaj, a Temple University film 
school grad with TV credits in her native India. The script, originally 
developed at the Sundance Institute, is an intense drama that takes place in 
one room with a man interviewing a female prisoner. Because of its anti-torture 
theme, Amnesty International is reportedly supporting the script in Hollywood. 
The film, produced by Janet Meyers, will start production by or before May. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Reiner has cast Kirstie Alley as a repressed housewife who embarks on her 
first extramarital affair in "Sibling Rivalry." The comedy, written by Martha 
Goldhirsch, begins filming in May for Castle Rock/Nelson Entertainment. 
Columbia will release. 
</P>
<P>
Exotic locations: Producer Jeffrey Sneller will soon find himself producing 
films virtually at opposite ends of the globe. First comes "The Ice Runner," 
rolling April 30 in Murmansk, U.S.S.R., near the Finnish border, under the 
direction of James Fargo. Timothy Bottoms stars as a CIA agent imprisoned in 
the Soviet gulag in 1986; Pat Morita plays a Mongolian trader. Negotiations are 
under way with Rod Steiger and Joanna Pacula for the other key roles. Four 
Seasons will handle U.S. distribution. . . . Then in June, Sneller and producer 
Raju Patel launch production in Africa on Sneller's own adaptation of Joseph 
Conrad's journey into colonialist depravity, "Heart of Darkness." Michael 
Wadleigh, best known for "Woodstock" and "Wolfen," will direct the Allied 
Entertainment production. Negotiations are under way with Liam Neeson to play 
the main protagonist, Marlow. Filming will take place in Kenya, Zaire, Uganda 
and Zimbabwe. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Also filming in Africa -- in Burundi, a country which has never before 
witnessed Western film making -- is "Snake Eyes." Malcolm McDowell, Sydney 
Penny, Lois Chiles, French star Philippe Leotard and Jason Cairns star in this 
modern-day fable for Jaques SandozFilm Prods. At $5.5 million, the film is said 
to be the most expensive Swiss-backed film ever. 
</P>
<P>
Writer-producer Paul Rapp and Teleview Prods. have set Joe Sirola in the title 
role of "The Commissioner." This film biography of Kenesaw Mountain Landis, 
Major League Baseball's first commissioner, goes into production this fall. No 
director has been set. 
</P>
<P>
Moshe Mizrahicq, whose directing career in Israel and France has resulted in 
three Oscar nominations for best foreign film, including the Oscar-winning 
"Madame Rosa," has come to L.A. to prepare for his first American film. 
"Paradise Man," to shoot this fall mostly in New York (with some locations in 
France), is based on a detective novel by Jerome Charyn, an American writer 
more celebrated in France than here. Casting for Rosa/Guy Prods. will get under 
way in a few weeks. KIRK HONEYCUTT

STAGEWEEK: D'AMBROSI'S 'PATHOLOGICAL' THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some of Dario D'Ambrosi's favorite audiences are mental patients. 
</P>
<P>
"I (develop and perform) my theater inside a mental hospital in Rome," said the 
Italian performance artist/playwright, whose "La Trota" (The Trout) opens 
Tuesday at Stages Trilingual Theatre. D'Ambrosi's two-character institution-set 
"Nemico Mio" (Enemy of Mine) concludes there tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"The boys (in Rome) are mostly 14 to 25, sometimes schizophrenic. Since my 
plays are about mental people, they recognize themselves. And I'm happy 'cause 
I'm helping sick people. It's also nice to come here, make a story about them." 
</P>
<P>
D'Ambrosi, a proponent of what he calls "pathological theater," originally 
played "Nemico Mio" at Stages in 1988 -- in Italian. This time he's taking a go 
at it in English. "It's very, very difficult," he admitted of the adjustment. 
"But if I want to work in this country, it's important that people understand 
(me)." 
</P>
<P>
In "La Trota," D'Ambrosi is a poor man who suffers "days and days eating 
nothing. Finally a trout comes. He doesn't have (the heart to kill it), so he 
decides to live with it. He wants to live like the fish -- without air -- but 
cannot, and he dies. He bought the fish to eat, but the fish eats him . . . 
metaphorically. It's like poetry," he concluded of his fables. "Like 
philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
THEATER BUZZ: When the Upland earthquake struck Feb. 28, some theatergoers got 
an extra sound and light show at the Pantages Theatre, where "Starlight 
Express" was in the middle of its Wednesday matinee. Fortunately for the cast, 
the temblor came during a non-skating sequence: Sean McDermott's solo, "I Am 
the Star Ride," which is accompanied by a dazzling laser effect. 
</P>
<P>
"When the earthquake started, people said it was like Sensurround," reported 
the show's publicist. "Everyone stayed through the number, but as soon as it 
was over, 300 people got up and left." The rest of the audience bravely stayed 
on, however, and the performance continued uninterrupted. The theater suffered 
no damage. 
</P>
<P>
CRITICAL CROSSFIRE: The Peter Thompson/John Kander/Fred Ebb Depression-era 
musical, "Flora, the Red Menace" (1965), is being revived at the Pasadena 
Playhouse. Scott Ellis directs. 
</P>
<P>
Said Sylvie Drake in The Times: "Ellis has brought 'Flora' a good way down the 
road to perestroika, but it still has a distance to go. If it's to be any kind 
of menace, there's more work to be done." 
</P>
<P>
From Jay Reiner in the Hollywood Reporter: "The score is mediocre. . . . The 
storyline itself unravels in an old-fashioned, overly cute style that feels 
more formulaic than daring, despite the political underpinnings." 
</P>
<P>
Said Daily Variety's Timothy Gray: "Other than 'Carrie,' it's hard to think of 
a less likely subject for a musical. The fact that the writer and producers 
were drawn to it once is surprising; that anyone felt compelled to return to 
this material passeth all understanding." 
</P>
<P>
From the Daily News' Daryl H. Miller: 'Ellis' stage images are intriguing, 
Susan Stroman's choreography is red-hot, and the cast performances are 
compelling . . . 'Flora' doesn't have to be regarded as a political show. It 
can be enjoyed as pure entertainment."

MUSIC AND DANCE NEWS: JAKOBSON BALLETS: A COPYRIGHT TEST CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ROSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego-based California Ballet and the heirs of Soviet choreographer 
Leonid Jakobson are entangled in a complex legal case that may become a model 
for others grappling with new Soviet copyright laws. 
</P>
<P>
The heirs contend that they own the Jakobson works that California Ballet plans 
to present with members of the State Ballet of Leningrad U.S.S.R. (also known 
as Choreographic Miniatures, the name Leonid Jakobson gave his company in 
1970). 
</P>
<P>
A May 12 performance is scheduled in the San Diego Civic Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The widow and son of Jakobson are seeking to block California Ballet's plans to 
acquire Jakobson's works from the Soviet company during its visit here. At 
issue is who owns the more than 100 ballets Jakobson created. 
</P>
<P>
There is more than a little irony in this situation. For the 40 years of his 
creative lifetime, Jakobson suffered artistic ignominy at the hands of Soviet 
cultural authorities, who repeatedly repressed his ballets as degenerate 
examples of anti-socialist realist art. 
</P>
<P>
Within the last year, however, in the wake of Soviet reforms, Jakobson has come 
to be celebrated as a great cultural hero, the Soviet equivalent of his 
Vaganova Institute classmate, George Balanchine. 
</P>
<P>
Since Jakobson's death in 1975, his company has been directed by Askold 
Makarov, a former leading dancer with the Kirov Ballet in the 1950s, and the 
man who negotiated with California Ballet director Maxine Mahon in 1988 to 
bring Choreographic Miniatures to America. 
</P>
<P>
Makarov for a time reportedly stopped crediting Jakobson as the choreographer 
of the company's ballets, and for several years he has actively prevented 
Jakobson's widow from staging her husband's work anywhere in the Soviet Union 
despite her claimed legal ownership of them. 
</P>
<P>
Currently holding the title of "master teacher" at San Francisco Ballet, Irina 
Jakobson has long contended that Makarov is not maintaining her husband's work 
properly. She cites this as the reason she and her son don't want California 
Ballet learning the works from Makarov and his dancers. 
</P>
<P>
"I am sure that it is better not to show my husband's work than to show them at 
all in this condition," Irina Jakobson said last week. "It would be as if I 
copied a Rembrandt painting only I put the nose on the cheek and rearranged the 
rest of the features.

"We left the U.S.S.R. to escape this kind of lawlessness," Jakobson said. "And 
now it has followed us here." 
</P>
<P>
Mahon, however, is sticking by her original plan to present Makarov and his 
company in May. "I have an arrangement with the Leningrad State Ballet to do a 
residency here and teach," Mahon said in an interview. "It had nothing to do 
with Mrs. Jakobson. . . . I think the Leningrad State Ballet can do what it 
wants." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Epstein, a lawyer with the New York firm of Proskauer, Rose Goetz &amp; 
Mendelsohn, the same firm that represents the estate of George Balanchine and 
the man the Jakobsons have retained as their legal counsel, says there is no 
question that Mrs. Jakobson is the legal owner of the works. 
</P>
<P>
"The rights issue is very clear. The Russian government has confirmed that the 
rights for these ballets passed to Mrs. Jakobson at the death of her husband," 
he said. "California Ballet simply has to find out that their best source for 
Jakobson ballets is right here, and everything will go ahead OK." 
</P>
<P>
No matter what happens between California Ballet and the Jakobsons, however, 
California will see the premiere next month of a Leonid Jakobson ballet: the 
full five duets of "Rodin," when San Francisco Ballet becomes the first 
American troupe authorized to perform this ballet.

RECORD RACK: *** GRANT HART "INTOLERANCE" SST: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF 
ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE STARS (A CLASSIC).

In sharp contrast to Bob Mould's oppressive, scowling introspection, the music 
of his former Husker Du teammate is a miraculous blend of the buoyant and the 
brooding. The unruly Hart is like a wide-eyed, open-armed, big-hearted 
prankster dancing Daffy Duck circles around the memory of a hunched-up Mould. 
</P>
<P>
The drummer-singer's first solo album is erratic -- at times he seems to lose 
interest and wander away for a while -- but his best servings of chewy, 
psychedelic-textured, folk-flavored rock are the kind that stay with you. Most 
notable are "All of My Senses," with a ? &amp; the Mysterians organ line that 
repeats like a flashing neon sign, and "2541" -- that's the address of the 
apartment where a relationship began and ended. The lyrics' detail and the 
music's intensity conspire to sanctify the commonplace, as Hart makes this 
piece of personal history seem touching and urgent. RICHARD CROMELIN

CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding "Where in the World Was Christopher Columbus?": I would like to bring 
to your attention some historical facts. Although there have been disagreements 
about where Columbus first landed, it is not true that historians are trying to 
decide which island it was in order to celebrate in October, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The first islands that Columbus arrived at did not meet the expectations that 
he had derived from Marco Polo's "Voyages" and Pierre d'Ailly's "Imago Mundi." 
The admiral was in search of treasure islands, rich in gold and all kinds of 
precious stones that were supposed to be found in the eastern part of Asia. Not 
until he arrived in Hispaniola (originally Espanola) did he believe he was 
close to his goal, mainly because he finally encountered, although in small 
scale, some gold mines, and, the natives spoke of a region of the island called 
Cibao. Columbus, eager to prove himself right -- especially in the eyes of the 
Spanish crown -- assumed that what the "Indians" were talking about was 
Cipango, an island described in the books he had consulted as one of vast 
wealth and wonders. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that Columbus did not realize his expectations in Hispaniola 
-- or in any other island that he explored -- it is this island (now a 
territory divided between the Dominican Republic and Haiti) that became the 
first cultural center of the New World. Santo Domingo, in particular, was for 
more than two decades, the place where the conquistadors maintained permanent 
residence while other expeditions were taking place. It was there that the 
first cathedral of the Americas was built and that the remains of Columbus lie. 
It is not surprising, therefore, that Santo Domingo has been chosen as the main 
site for the major celebrations of the 500th anniversary of the encounter of 
the Old and New Worlds.

CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the 500th anniversary of Columbus' discovery approaches, it also seems 
appropriate to ask, where in the world is Christopher Columbus? Celebrations 
commemorating his final landfall could prove embarrassing ("Where in the World 
Was Christopher Columbus?" by Don A. Schanche, Jan. 28). 
</P>
<P>
The last I heard, the navigator's remains are claimed by at least four cities: 
Genoa, Italy, his hometown, has claimed Columbus ever since a grave-site marker 
was erected in one of the city's squares during the 16th Century. 
</P>
<P>
In the tradition of London's Westminster Abbey, the cathedrals of Seville and 
Santo Domingo, both in Spain, each proclaim that he rests beneath their floors, 
as does a city in the Dominican Republic, beneath a fountain in the middle of a 
traffic circle. 
</P>
<P>
Bad enough the world-renowned navigator should have become lost so often during 
his life at sea; is he to become lost in death, too?

CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS

<TEXT>
<P>
Schanche missed an opportunity to enlighten your readership about the true 
landfall of Christopher Columbus. He could have based his article on 
substantive landfall knowledge from the scholarly Oct. 13 workshop at John 
Hopkins University. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he relied on three blind mice groping for rationalizations at the Pier 
66 Resort and Marina in Fort Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
Both Joseph Judge and several Samuel Eliot Morison spokesmen were invited to 
join me at the Hopkins workshop (Robert Power's reconstruction is ludicrous). 
All Morison supporters wisely declined. Judge did give his colorful slide show, 
but then immediately skedaddled to avoid probing of his flimsy evidence. If I 
had been invited to Fort Lauderdale, Schanche would have learned: 
</P>
<P>
All independent experts agree that Columbus navigated accurately by latitude 
sailing rather than blindly by dead reckoning. This places him squarely in the 
middle of North East Providence Channel next to Egg Island instead of 90 or 
more miles south. 
</P>
<P>
The 98 journal clues describing four Bahama islands on his route to Cuba give 
overwhelming support of the northern route originating at Egg Island. Even 
though this third-hand copy of the journal is "peppered with demonstrable 
mistakes," there are 20 consecutive clues that fit my third island far better 
than Morison's. 
</P>
<P>
The earliest known detailed landfall map, by the French engineer Alain Manesson 
Mallet in 1685, displays many of the unique features of Egg Island and none of 
Watlings. 
</P>
<P>
The earliest mapping of Columbus' island names into modern ones was published 
by Don Antonio de Alcedo in 1786 before the landfall controversy developed. The 
highly respected Don Antonio took it for granted that Columbus entered the New 
World through North East Providence Channel, stopping at New Providence (not 
Rum Cay!) on his way to Cuba.

I am distressed by an item in the March 11 "Pop Eye" column, particularly the

irresponsible of The Times to provide a forum for such views. If Keifer held 
similar views about blacks, I don't think his vile thoughts would be treated so 
lightly.

REMEMBERING MALCOLM FORBES: A HOLIDAY SPENT BALLOONING WAS ONE SURE WAY TO RISE 
ABOVE THE CROWD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL JACKSON, Jackson is a talk-show host on radio station KABC. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The invitation came as a surprise: Malcolm Forbes had invited my wife and 
myself to join him at his Chateau de Balleroy in Normandy, France, to go 
hot-air ballooning during his 14th-annual spring house party last June, several 
months before Forbes' death this past February. Flying from New Jersey aboard 
Forbes' private Boeing 727, which he calls "The Capitalist Tool," was like 
being ensconced in someone's comfortable condo complete with a queen-size bed, 
and a large living room and dining room. We selected reclining fauteuil and 
settled in for a journey. The comfort, the service, the cuisine and the company 
of other guests contributed to the seemingly swift passage. As it turned out, 
we were the vanguard of a group that was invited to the 1989 International 
Balloon Meet and Festival at Balleroy. 
</P>
<P>
As we left New Jersey, I found myself seated with Cap Weinberger, the former 
Secretary of Defense, and our host, the man who operates the Forbes publishing 
empire: a flamboyant capitalist, motorcycle fanatic and collector of everything 
from model boats and ships to rare Faberge eggs. The guest roster of those who 
joined us at Forbes' chateau proved to be an amazing amalgam, from Stavros 
Niarchos, the Greek shipping magnate, to young actor Matt Dillon. There were 
Madam Francois Mitterand, wife of the president of France, as well as King 
Michael and Queen Anne of Romania and broadcaster Walter Cronkite and his 
charming wife Betsy. Mark Goodson, of game-show fame was there, and joining us 
were Her Royal Highness, Princess Chantal de France, and the Baron Francois-X 
de Sambucy. 
</P>
<P>
It was dusk as the green and gold Capitalist Tool touched down at the little 
Caen-Carpiquet airport, where a convoy of cars awaited our arrival. No customs, 
no passport control, no checks of any sort. Just a handshake and a welcome 
before we drove off through the Normandy countryside. Some 20 minutes later we 
passed 200-year-old beech trees lining the main thoroughfare of the village of 
Balleroy, and ahead of us, with every room aglow, stood the chateau. We had a 
sense of being transported back centuries. 
</P>
<P>
Later, after gathering for a late-evening supper, Forbes outlined plans for the 
following five days. The weekend would feature the balloon festival, and until 
that time he invited us to avail ourselves of his chateau, to enjoy his 
hospitality, explore the countryside -- and simply enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
Forbes' chateau is a masterpiece of the early 17th Century, attributed to 
Francois Mansart, the greatest architect of his time and a major formulator of 
French classicism at the dawn of its golden age. Unity, balance, dignity -- the 
chateau has it all: A magnificent structure set in superb grounds with acres of 
lawn surrounded by forest. The stable at Balleroy has been converted into a 
permanent museum to ballooning. Since its doors opened to the public in 1975, 
the Musee des Ballons has attracted more than 20,000 visitors annually. 
</P>
<P>
We were awakened our first morning by the skirl of bagpipes somewhere off in 
the woods -- a day that began cool and misty. There was something 
Brigadoon-like about the music floating up to our room on the top floor of the 
great mansion. At breakfast, Forbes announced that he was off to the World War 
II invasion beaches, which were no more than half-an-hour away, and that if any 
of us would like to join him, he'd escort us on a guided tour. (The ballooning 
would come later -- the final episode of our superb adventure). Our host called 
for his own Harley-Davidson and along with other cyclers we traveled to the 
beaches of Normandy, passing through villages observing the 44th anniversary of 
the invasion with flags of the allied nations fluttering from their entrances. 
</P>
<P>
Above Omaha Beach we walked through a field of markers for those who died 
during the historic invasion. graves of those who served and died. It was a 
moving experience, and although our host had made the pilgrimage on more than 
one occasion, he appeared to be as touched by the moment as any of us who were 
paying our first visit. 
</P>
<P>
Returning to the Forbes chateau, the magazine magnate mentioned how during 
World War II he'd passed near the chateau with the Army and could not have 
imagined that one day he'd possess it: lock, stock, moat and forest, purchased 
from the last Comtesse de La Cour de Balleroy. 
</P>
<P>
During our odyssey we found time to further explore on our own. We drove along 
back roads, through archetypal villages of thatched-roofed black and white 
timbered farmhouses, flowering apple trees and miles of rich pastureland. We 
explored Mont-St-Michel, which Victor Hugo had described as "the pyramid of the 
seas," visiting the abbey that, in one form or another, has stood atop the 
island for more than 1,000 years. At the foot of the narrow, medieval, cobbled 
street that rises sharply toward the spire of the Abbey of Mont-Saint-Michel 
stood Mere Poulard's restaurant, which has been serving omeletes to visitors 
for well over a century. They are cooked over an oak-wood fire, rise 
souffle-like, and taste slightly smokey and wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
We motored elsewhere. I shall long remember the fish markets of Honfleur and 
Trouville in particular, with their displays of seafood, infinite in variety, 
glistening with freshness; dishes ready for the tables of the little 
restaurants and cafes that cluster alongside the port. Crabs, oysters, mussels, 
shrimp, langoustes, cockles and prawns -- here we dined on a harvest from the 
sea and followed it with the finest apple tart in the world. 
</P>
<P>
While we explored the countryside, preparations for the ballooning events were 
on-going at the chateau. A large tent for formal meals had been raised at the 
entrance to the castle, and balloonists were arriving from all over the world, 
together with crews and equipment. European royalty and celebrities, business 
tycoons and other notables were in evidence everywhere. A small symphony 
orchestra entertained on the lawn and a French military motorcycle guard of 
about 25 men maneuvered around the park. In the forest that surrounded the 
chateau, an old-fashioned fun fair appeared overnight, with bumper cars and a 
shooting range, cotton candy and carnival barkers. Days that began with the 
bagpipe ended with the sounds of laughter and the music of the carousel. During 
the final 48 hours some 20,000 locals converged on Balleroy for its major event 
of the year, the balloon festival. 
</P>
<P>
After the first formal dinner that marked the opening of the festivities, our 
host invited us to the back lawn to observe a sound-and-light show that filled 
the night sky with dazzling color, accompanied by music that seemed 
orchestrated to each detonation. 
</P>
<P>
As Saturday dawned cold and misty, Forbes was first up to greet each of 40 or 
so balloonists. Each year he prepares theme balloons. This year, as balloonists 
from the United States, Britain, Turkey, Sweden, Switzerland, Germany, Finland, 
Spain and elsewhere prepared to lift off, our host inflated 14 of his own 
balloons which he's flown on the Forbes Friendship Tours across Thailand, 
Pakistan, Switzerland, China, the Soviet Union and other nations. 
</P>
<P>
Can money buy happiness? Yes. I concluded that it could as I watched the face 
of Malcolm Forbes as his giant air-filled replica of Kyoto's Golden Temple was 
being prepared. And later as his model of the Sphinx hovered over the chateau. 
And as his balloon, Suleyman the Great, rose gently from the lawn at Chateau de 
Balleroy. 
</P>
<P>
There were others: the Faberge Egg and the Great Sky Elephant, both of which 
enthralled the audience, and the monstrous, ponderous, elephant constructed for 
his goodwill visit in Thailand -- along with the replica of the Santa Maria 
that captivated Seville. Two of the all-time favorites were the half-size 
replica of the chateau and a replica of a Harley-Davidson. (Yes, a 
Harley-Davidson of all things!) With the roar of dozens of propane burners, the 
cheer of the crowd and a fanfare from Les Echos Du Pays Auge (the men who play 
the hunting horns in full livery), each balloon lifted from the grounds to 
drift slowly across the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the other balloonists as they prepared for flight. Passengers boarded 
the baskets: royal heads, industrialists, celebrities, politicians and 
diplomats. Walter Cronkite rode with the world champion balloonist, Frank Nels, 
and I flew with Buddy Bombard, and we did justice to the Montgolfier brothers 
of Annonay, France, who set aloft in the very first hot-air balloon in 1783. 
There is no lovelier way to explore the countryside than in the company of 
dozens of other balloons, gliding over the treetops, the houses, the hedgerows, 
the church steeples, the villages, rivers and, in this case, the startled cows 
of Normandy. 
</P>

Early morning and late-afternoon proved to be the best times for ascent and we 
made every moment count; switching balloons, meeting and getting to know each 
other and discovering the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, after our final ascent, Forbes turned over the cellar of the chateau 
to the balloon crews for a barbecue featuring whole lamb roasted on a spit. 
Within the first hour, the Italians were singing arias, the Spaniards were 
dancing on the tables, the Germans were telling stories -- and each of us was 
wishing that this could simply go on forever.

<P>
It had been a busy day of sun and surf, and I was recharging with a free 
welcome cocktail on my hotel terrace in a tiny beachfront garden, a seashell's 
throw from the Hilton Hawaiian Village. 
</P>
<P>
As I idly glanced up at the resort's skyscrapers, I caught a Hilton guest 
looking down on me -- socially as well as logistically, it was clear. His eyes 
quickly dismissed the rustic two-story complex comprising my lodging, its lone 
"tower" a puny six stories. 
</P>
<P>
But my little patch of paradise -- called the Waikikian on the Beach -- had its 
charms. It was friendly and attractive, with Polynesian-style thatched-roof 
units bordering a torch-lit garden path. Though my lofty neighbor may not have 
been lured by my one small restaurant-nightspot, I liked its folksy appeal. On 
the other hand, I also regularly tapped the adjoining Hilton's handy wealth of 
shops, eateries and entertainment. And, of course, we both shared the same 
stretch of wide and wonderful Waikiki Beach. The Waikikian's biggest plus, 
however, was my daily tab: $59. 
</P>
<P>
OK, so I didn't have a TV set or air-conditioning. But who needs "Roseanne" 
when you have ukuleles and hula dancers at your doorstep? And Hawaii's brisk 
trade winds cooled my basic-level room so effectively that I never switched on 
the ceiling fan. 
</P>
<P>
The Waikikian is only one of a number of lesser-known alternatives to the major 
hotels that house most Honolulu tourists. Some of the biggies are 
budget-minded, too, but visitors who stake out one of the smaller, homier oases 
are more likely to be beguiled by a certain Hawaii magic. 
</P>
<P>
Another low-rise charmer even closer to the center of the action is the 95-room 
Hawaiiana, set in a lushly landscaped private enclave half a block from the 
beach. Its two- and three-level units -- some with terraces, or lanais, as they 
are called in the Aloha State -- snake around two swimming pools. A spacious 
double here, with color TV, air-conditioning and fully equipped kitchen, runs 
$75 to $95. The cordial Hawaiiana offers a wealth of free extras, including 
beach mats, morning coffee and juice, daily newspaper delivered to your door, 
use of a washer and dryer, plus a welcoming gift of a fresh pineapple and a 
parting remembrance of a fragrant flower lei. You'll find a lot of regulars, 
and you'll feel as if you're among old friends from the minute you check in. 
</P>
<P>
For a refuge altogether removed from the tourist fray, there's the venerable 
Manoa Valley Inn, tucked away on a residential street two miles from the beach, 
near the University of Hawaii campus. You'll feel like a wealthy landowner 
while relaxing on the wide veranda of this lovingly restored plantation house, 
which was snatched from demolition by Rick Ralston, president of trendy Crazy 
Shirts, and is now on the National Register of Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
Rates for the seven antique-furnished rooms and private cottage are $80 to $145 
and include a generous continental breakfast plus afternoon wine and cheese. 
Guests are encouraged to help themselves to decanters of sherry and bowls of 
candies on the second- and third-floor landings, and are urged to play the 
old-fashioned nickelodeon (a pile of nickels is provided) or the new-fangled TV 
and VCR in the parlor. You may hardly see another guest and half-believe the 
house is yours alone, or you may strike up friendships as you watch the lights 
of Waikiki twinkle on at dusk from the porch swing of this hillside perch. 
Visitors without a rental car can catch the No. 4 bus two blocks away and be on 
the beach in 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The Manoa Valley Inn is the showplace among the growing number of B&amp;B's in 
the Hawaiian islands. Numerous agencies -- some local, some statewide -- match 
guests and rooms, the cost of which start as low as $20 a night plus a small 
reservation fee. You may even luck into a view of your own and a private beach. 
Most B&amp;Bs, though, are a considerable distance from the bright lights of 
Waikiki, so a car is advisable. 
</P>
<P>
We found other inexpensive Waikiki lodgings. The Outrigger chain offers a score 
of possibilities, most in the budget range. And the Hawaii Visitors Bureau 
publishes a free tip sheet, Hawaii on a Budget, listing hotels, condos, 
cottages and B&amp;B's for each island, under the heading "Where to Stay for 
Under $65 per Day." 
</P>
<P>
If you stay at one of the several dozen hotels affiliated with a new local 
agency, the Hotel Exchange, which has set up shop in the Hawaiian Colony Hotel 
at 1946 Ala Moana Blvd., near the Hilton, you can save $10 to $25 on the daily 
room rate. I stumbled upon the agency through an ad in a Waikiki tourist 
magazine and shaved $10 off the already bargain price of $69 that was quoted to 
me by the Waikikian. Now the Exchange expects to sign up several major hotels 
in Waikiki, so that those who insist on traveling in style can save a few 
bucks, too. 
</P>
<P>
Following is a guide to keeping down costs in other categories. 
</P>
<P>
Air-hotel packages usually are the cheapest option for tourists who don't mind 
an if-it's-Tuesday-this-must-be-Oahu pace. Independent travelers do best if 
they can snag one of the air fare specials that crop up now and then -- 
particularly in spring and fall. 
</P>
<P>
Island-hopping is the local pastime so inter-island fares are fairly reasonable 
($49.95 one way between Honolulu and any other island). You can save $15 each 
way by taking the first and last flight of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Getting around: To get from Honolulu airport to Waikiki, hop a shuttle bus 
outside the terminal. The tab is $5 to any hotel, as opposed to $15 or $20 for 
a cab. 
</P>
<P>
I'd skip the Waikiki Trolley, which for $10 offers a cursory spiel and an 
all-day pass allowing passengers to jump on and off at pickup points around 
town. You'll do as well for less on the public buses, guidebook in hand; the 
fare is 60 cents -- whether you ride down the block or around the island. 
</P>
<P>
Rental cars are advertised at rates as low as $5 a day, although you'll 
probably spend closer to $20, since the rock-bottom models never seem to be 
available. Shop around. Most car-rental firms also offer tie-in discounts at 
various tourist attractions. 
</P>
<P>
Many hotels and restaurants advertise happy hours -- some run virtually all day 
-- featuring snacks, music and reduced drink prices (as low as $1.50 for the 
ubiquitous Mai Tai or Tropical Itch, the latter served with a 12-inch back 
scratcher as a swizzle stick). 
</P>
<P>
Shopping: Waikiki wares run the gamut from trash to treasure, and it is 
possible to find lovely fashions among the millions of mass-produced muumuus 
and aloha shirts. Before you buy anything anywhere, compare prices at the ABC 
convenience stores and at Liberty House, the Macy's of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
If you really love a bargain, take the escalator to the fifth floor of the 
Waikiki Shopping Center on main-drag Kalakaua Boulevard and browse through 
Betty's Import and Export, where for 50 cents or $1 you can find the same 
shell-and-stone jewelry you see in the International Bazaar shops for 10 or 20 
times more. Stop at the third floor, as well, and look in on Ali's Jewelry and 
Exotic leather, where prices of soft eel-skin items such as wallets start at 
$5. 
</P>
<P>
Less widely known than the popular Kodak Hula Show in Kapiolani Park, near 
Diamond Head volcano, is the Young People's Hula Show at 9:30 a.m. every Sunday 
at the opposite end of Waikiki, on Center Stage in Ala Moana mall. The 
pint-sized dancers -- boys as well as girls, some as young as 2 -- show off 
what they've learned about Hawaii's cultural traditions, and their contortions 
will tickle you more than running into Richard Chamberlain and the cast of 
"Island Son." It's one show that would be worth almost any price, but it 
underscores the fact that even in Hawaii, many of the most enjoyable things are 
free.

TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE; 
</P>
<P>
NANTUCKET SEEMS TO BE A GIANT MOVIE SET WITH EVERYTHING TOO PERFECT AND NEWLY 
PAINTED AND WHOLESOME TO BE BELIEVED. THEN YOU REALIZE THAT IT'S FOR REAL, THAT 
IT HASN'T BEEN DREAMED-UP OR RE-CREATED BUT HAS BEEN MAINTAINED OVER THE 
CENTURIES AS THE HISTORICAL TREASURE THAT IT IS.

"Goin' over to America," old-time Nantucketers like to say. Or; "Just got back 
from America." In this case, "America" is the mainland 30 miles -- and 30 light 
years -- away. In many ways their attitude is right on, for this unique island 
that's about 15 miles long by 3 to 6 miles wide is like a foreign country -- 
or, more accurately, a slice of the America of a century ago. More than 100 
years ago, famous Americans were delighted by Nantucket. In 1835, Daniel 
Webster called it "the unknown city in the ocean" and Thoreau and Emerson were 
also charmed by the island. The latter stood on a bluff in starkly beautiful 
Siasconset (pronounced Sconset) and marveled at the gusts blowing the tops off 
the waves "like the hair of a woman in the wind." Other New England resorts 
have good bathing, beaches, boating and fishing -- so what is it that inspires 
the rugged fealty of the old-timers and attracts the tourists in droves? First 
of all, the physical look of the place grabs everyone, and photographs cannot 
prepare one for the impact of the setting, natural and man-made. The clouds, 
the air, the harbor, the boats, the buildings: It is a giant movie set with 
everything too perfect and newly painted and wholesome and too Herman Melville, 
too Mark Twain and too Norman Rockwell to be believed. And then you realize 
that this isn't Disney at work -- that this is for real; the town hasn't been 
dreamed-up or recreated -- it has been maintained over the centuries as the 
historical treasure it is. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere in the United States are there so many houses like these straight from 
the 18th and 19th centuries -- more than 600 of them. Historian A.B.C. Whipple 
put it this way: "Williamsburg, Virginia can show you what America's past must 
have been like; Nantucket shows you what it actually was." 
</P>
<P>
The oldest dwelling on the island is generally conceded to be the Jethro Coffin 
House built around 1686 by pioneer Tristam Coffin for his grandson. Nantucket, 
"The Faraway Land" to Indians, was discovered in 1602 by one Bartholomew 
Gosnold, and the first white settler on the island in 1659 was Thomas Macy, 
progenitor of the department store clan. (Another distinguished, and much 
later, Nantucketer was Benjamin Franklin's mother.) 
</P>
<P>
To describe this anachronistic hamlet I promise not to use the cliches "quaint, 
colorful, and charming," but it'll be difficult, because everywhere there are 
picture post card scenes: cobbled streets lined with rows of gray and white 
shingled houses, often rose-smothered, a white lighthouse in front of a skiff 
with red sails, even a huge windmill, built in 1746, its arms still turning 
slowly in the wind. Down on the bustling wharves are boats of every size and 
hue and origin. More than a century and a half ago the world's mightiest 
whaling fleet jammed the harbor, and the dozens of shops do not let you forget 
that Nantucket's fame came from the sperm-oil trade. The whale motif is 
everywhere, from gift reproductions of harpoons to walrus-tusk carvings of 
whales to the scrimshaw disks atop the chic and greatly coveted "lightship 
purses." 
</P>
<P>
First made over a century ago by lonely lightkeepers to help pass the time, 
these tightly woven baskets of Javanese cane are now decorated on top with 
ivory carvings or nautical scrimshaw scenes and sell sometimes for more than 
$1,000. They bear little resemblance to the original open-topped original 
baskets. Jose Formoso Reyes arrived in Nantucket in 1945 from the Philippines 
looking for a job teaching Spanish and instead turned to basket-making. He 
designed a top for the basket and showed it to a maker of ship models, Charles 
Sayle, whose wife suggested the idea that launched a million baskets: "Why not 
put a little ivory whale on top?" 
</P>
<P>
Now the lightship basket has become a hallmark of chic around the world. Once 
on the far-off island of Moorea, a Tahitian native spotted my wife's basket and 
exclaimed in happy recognition: "Ah, Nantucket!" (only she pronounced it 
"naw-too-kay"). Also sold here are excellent copies of the basket made in the 
Orient that sell for about $125, but Nantucketers say you can spot the phonies. 
For one thing, the genuine article doesn't have leather hinges. 
</P>
<P>
Nantucketers are fiercely proud of their baskets, their cobbled streets, their 
pristine houses, the old White Elephant Hotel, their unsullied vistas, their 
white beaches with the unusually warm water, their unbelievably pure air, their 
heritage, and their island. They glorify the past and are fearful of the 
present. "Change" is a dirty word, a mainland word, an "off-island" word. They 
are ever vigilant and mindful that tourism is the main industry and that what 
draws people to the island is its changelessness. A great part of the allure 
lies in the island's 5,500 or so dwellings, from ancient fishermen's shacks to 
the rows of Quaker houses to austere Greek revival buildings. One cannot even 
change the color of one's house, much less alter the structure, without a 
permit. An organization called the Nantucket Conservation Foundation has 
purchased large sections of the island with the intention of preserving it in 
its natural state; the foundation is comprised of land donated by 
public-spirited and, generally, wealthy individuals. Approximately 25% of the 
island is now in the "Conservation." 
</P>
<P>
Those who watch over the interests of Nantucket must constantly remind 
themselves that the very qualities that attract the visitor are endangered by 
the visitor. Three years ago the town established a land bank into which goes 
property purchased by a 2% assessment on the buyer of any house or parcel of 
land on Nantucket. The land bank now holds about 8% of the island. Nantucket's 
selectmen and the voters of the 3,500 plus permanent population work diligently 
to keep away such mainland blandishments as parking meters, elevators, campers, 
and neon signs. 
</P>
<P>
One old Nantucketer shook his head and remarked disdainfully of Nantucket's 
arch rival, Martha's Vineyard: "I hear tell they even got stoplights over there 
now!" 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons for Nantucket's physical uniqueness is a result of the 
depression that the island experienced after the discovery of kerosene in 1838. 
This petroleum derivative soon replaced costly whale oil for lighting the lamps 
of the world. On top of that, there occurred the Great Fire of 1846 which 
eliminated a third of the town and vast stores of whale oil. Then came the 
California gold strike, and many whalers and their ships stopped off in San 
Francisco, never to return. The Civil War also took away able-bodied men -- 
some for good. 
</P>
<P>
In its economically depressed state, the island never got into the swing of the 
Victorian building craze, and so islanders rarely destroyed old homes in favor 
of new gingerbread ones so in vogue on the mainland. Instead, residents 
maintained their saltboxes with their characteristic widow's walks, many of 
which go back to the 1700s. 
</P>
<P>
"We're putting you in the new wing," said my host in the India Street house. 
The "new" wing was built in 1840. A couple of blocks away on Main Street three 
other "new" houses rose in 1836 and are the pride of the town. Known as The 
Three Bricks, they were built by Joseph Starbuck, who made millions with his 
whaling ships and spent the then-astronomical sum of $54,000 for all three 
mansions. Carolyn Amory, who lives most of the year in Santa Barbara and owns 
one of The Bricks, gave us a tour of its elegant rooms full of the best of 
Nantucket's antique furniture, marine paintings and historic scrimshaw. Like so 
many Nantucket town homes without front yards, it has a surprisingly large and 
beautiful garden in back. 
</P>
<P>
The Bricks are at the top of Main Street and walking down that inclined cobbled 
thoroughfare is one of the musts of the "trippers," as the Nantucketers refer 
to the tourists. The ancient, worn-brick sidewalks with their erratic 
convexities, dips, and swells are trod by hundreds of off-islanders daily 
during Nantucket's June till Labor Day season. Mitchell's little book store is 
the first stop for maps and books about the island and then follow the many 
stores featuring antiques, handmade woolen garments, nautical gifts, scrimshaw, 
jewelry, weather vanes, T-shirts and art galleries. Much of the art looks as 
though it had been done by a spastic Leroy Nieman, but there are a few good 
local artists. One of the best is Kenneth Layman, who sells his landscapes for 
around $5,000, but keeps his night-time job as a bartender at The Straight 
Wharf, one of the islands spiffier restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Restored by S&amp;H Green Stamp mogul Walter Beinecke, the wharf area is a 
tourist mecca not only for the constant fancy yacht show but for its attractive 
shops and restaurants. John Stobart, a celebrated marine painter, maintains a 
studio at the end of The Straight Wharf in which numbered prints of his $50,000 
paintings of Nantucket's golden era sell steadily at $300 and up. 
</P>
<P>
Near the wharf is a fascinating building dedicated to the history of whaling in 
Nantucket, first practiced by the Algonquin Indians. The museum is not to be 
missed, especially if one can time a visit to catch the learned Adam Craig's 
periodic lecture on the incredible saga of a whaler's life. 
</P>
<P>
After my visit to the museum, like most Nantucketers and "trippers", I stopped 
nearby at the Juice Bar for their famous ice cream, and another Nantucket 
reality asserted itself. "Ninety cents for the cone," the girl informed me 
pleasantly, "and with ice cream in it, two dollars extra." Such is the price of 
Nantucket's tourism industry. 
</P>
<P>
There are few bargains on Nantucket. The islanders have a scant 3 1/2-month 
season to make virtually a year's income before the summer visitors go "back to 
America," leaving the shops and hotels to either close or tough it out until 
the following June. 
</P>
<P>
It is then with all of "the foreigners" gone and the prices lowered 
accordingly, that the Nantucketer really enjoys his beautiful island, the deer, 
the rare flora, the cranberry fields, the 55 miles of pristine beaches, the 
lazy sailboating, the peace of the elegant hamlet of Sconset at the end of the 
island, the scalloping, and the bluefishing. 
</P>
<P>
The catching of bluefish appears to be the main avocation of the Nantucketer, 
along with sailing and tennis at the club or golf on the three courses. 
Fishermen go out nearly every afternoon to Great Point or Smith's Point, next 
to dozens of other enthusiasts from all walks of life and cast far out beyond 
the surf, out toward Portugal 3,000 miles away. They catch scrappy 10- to 
15-pound blues, a pugnacious and tasty fish that many surfeited islanders throw 
back or exchange for lobster at the local market. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the island are fighting progress hard. In November, 1988 the voted 
to turn down a proposal to inaugurate a high-speed catamaran service between 
the island and the mainland, which was calculated to bring even more visitors. 
How long can Nantucket continue to boast that it is "50 years behind the 
times"? 
</P>
<P>
Not long, opine many dour Nantucketers. One gentleman, a retired executive of a 
Fortune 400 corporation and longtime summer resident, grumbles: "In the past 
five years the island has experienced a land rush more intense than any on 
Martha's Vineyard or in Newport or any of those other blue chip resorts. And in 
spite of our strict codes, builders are somehow worming their way in here. Have 
you seen those terrible new condos going in? Interval ownership and condos -- 
that's what we hate and fear the most. That and drugs. Our island is a perfect 
place to make drug drops by boats and they were pretty rampant here for a 
while. But the FBI infiltrated the gangs and last year they made a huge bust 
and hopefully slowed 'em down plenty." 
</P>
<P>
As he took down his trusty old fishing rod from the rack and prepared to go out 
to the beach after blues, he shook his head sadly. "You shoulda been here in 
the old days." But to newcomers like me, Nantucket -- all of it -- still is -- 
well -- oh, to heck with promises -- Nantucket is charming! quaint! and 
colorful!

GREAT ZIMBABWE NATIONAL MONUMENT, Zimbabwe 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of all the historians, anthropologists, archeologists, tourists, mystics and 
assorted crackpots who have visited this centuries-old site in recent years, 
none seemed to impress the park rangers more than a woman from New York named 
Martha. 
</P>
<P>
Martha was an energetic middle-age woman with bright silver hair who introduced 
herself as a "research psychic" and asked to spend a night here under the 
stars. Her mission, she told the rangers, was to contact the spirits of the 
Great Zimbabwe, a mammoth collection of dry stone ruins whose man-made origins 
have been debated by experts for more than a century. 
</P>
<P>
She scaled the rocks that evening and set up shop in the old stone fortress on 
a cliff 400 feet above the valley floor. When she descended the next morning, 
bruised and breathless, she was disheveled, but her face was rosy with 
excitement. 
</P>
<P>
"The lady was very happy. She said the Queen of Sheba had come to visit. They 
apparently talked together all night," said Bernard Naborth, a veteran officer 
here who has seen his share of curious travelers. He paused. "We have so many 
visitors. I think everyone finds something of interest." 
</P>
<P>
Ever since this ancient site 200 miles south of Harare was discovered by a Boer 
hunter named Adam Renders in 1868, it has stoked the imaginations of scholars, 
scientists and visionaries, attracted gold and treasure hunters by the score 
and fired the cultural pride of Zimbabwean nationalists and people of African 
descent the world over. 
</P>
<P>
The ruins are Africa's largest and most dramatic south of the pyramids of 
Egypt, and as such, constitute proof that a rich and powerful black 
civilization once flourished in a part of the world that Westerners have 
traditionally characterized as barbaric, wild and primitive. 
</P>
<P>
American civil rights leader W.E.B. Du Bois, a founder of the National Assn. 
for the Advancement of Colored People, was one of many black leaders who have 
been inspired by this site through the years. In his 1946 book, "The World and 
Africa," Du Bois celebrated the Great Zimbabwe as emblematic of Africa's 
"extraordinary cultural past" and a symbol of pride for black Americans 
deprived of a sense of ancient heritage. 
</P>
<P>
In the language of this nation's Shona people, Zimbabwe means "venerated place" 
or "house of chiefs." Great Zimbabwe, from which the 10-year-old country 
acquired its name, consists of the hilltop fortress, a conical watchtower and a 
number of imposing walled enclosures all made from chiseled granite about 700 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 71,000 tourists visited the Great Zimbabwe, the largest of a number 
of such sites that can be found in remote parts of Zambia and Mozambique as 
well as this country. Amid a landscape of boulders and forests, the ruins, 
scattered over 100 acres, project a stark beauty whose mystery has been 
enhanced through the years by the inability of early experts to fully agree on 
who built them or why. 
</P>
<P>
The list of peoples put forward by Western archeologists and theorists as 
possible builders of the site reads like a Who's Who in ancient history: 
Chaldeans, Sabaeans, Persians, Mongolians, Babylonians, Assyrians, Phoenicians, 
Hindus and Sardinians. Several experts have attributed the site to 17th-Century 
Portuguese traders and adventurers; others conjectured that these ruins were 
none other than the site of King Solomon's mines and the true source of the 
biblical gold of Ophir. 
</P>
<P>
Priceless evidence that would have helped solve the mystery -- gold objects, 
sculpted soapstone birds, jewelry, wall paintings and other artifacts -- was 
hauled away by legions of treasure hunters and colonial profiteers who raided 
and ransacked the site until 1928, when the British colonial government passed 
laws protecting it. 
</P>
<P>
The scholarly debates about the ruins in the first half of this century had one 
thing in common: Because of racial and cultural biases, few of the Western 
experts dared to consider that the Great Zimbabwe may have been designed and 
built by the Shona people themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Of one thing I do feel satisfied," wrote an Englishman named H. Maclear Bate 
in a 1940 study of the ruins titled "Report From the Rhodesias": "No African 
built those walls except under expert foreign guidance." 
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean archeologist Peter Garlake, explaining the racial attitudes of many 
researchers and explorers, wrote, "To them, the African simply had not the 
energy, will, organization, foresight or skill to build those walls. Indeed, he 
appeared so backward that it seemed that his entire race could never have 
accomplished the task at any period." 
</P>
<P>
It was Garlake who wrote a 1973 book titled "The Great Zimbabwe," which remains 
the field's most respected and authoritative study. Using modern methods of 
radiocarbon dating and other archeological evidence showing that the Great 
Zimbabwe culture thrived between the 13th and 15th centuries, long before the 
arrival of the first European explorers, Garlake presented a strong case that 
the ruins were indeed built by the Shona people employing indigenous skills 
under the rule of a monarchy that flourished from gold trade with Arabs on the 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
At the peak of their power, these Shona rulers, known as the Mwanamutapa, 
extended their rule throughout most of what is now Zimbabwe. The empire 
crumbled rapidly at the end of the 15th Century when its lifeline, the rich 
maize-producing farmland surrounding the Great Zimbabwe, was oversown and 
severely depleted. 
</P>
<P>
This thesis is almost universally accepted by world scholars and archeologists 
today. But before Zimbabwe's independence in 1980, such notions were considered 
so heretical and politically volatile by the nation's white minority rulers 
that some scholarly manuscripts were censored and their authors harassed. "They 
see such expressions . . . as sedition against the present political 
structure," Garlake wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the idea that the Great Zimbabwe had African origins played no small 
role in galvanizing this country's nationalists in the independence struggle of 
the 1970s. It was nothing less than a patriotic symbol and a call to arms. As 
Benedict Mtshali, a leading Zimbabwean historian, once wrote, the ruins prove 
that "the African had a civilization that was not the white man's gift. . . . 
They are relics of an era of glory, splendor, power and achievement and give 
the lie to those who dismiss the African past . . . such a sense of history 
forges a people, gives them a sense of oneness and dignity." 
</P>
<P>
Today the Great Zimbabwe is to this country what Chichen Itza is to Mexico and 
the Acropolis is to Greece -- a cultural treasure whose value is measured not 
so much in entry fees from foreign tourists as in the education it nurtures and 
the national identity it sustains. 
</P>
<P>
About 60% of the site's yearly visitors are Zimbabweans, many of them 
schoolchildren. On a recent Sunday afternoon, the sun-splashed ruins were 
filled with visitors who had paid about 10 cents each to get in, among them 
students, families and a troop of white South African Boy Scouts, all strolling 
amid the silent stones. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a part of our history, but it's still very mysterious," said 
Munyaradzinngowe, 28, a Zimbabwean agronomist who, with his wife and sister, 
was enjoying a view of the valley. "I like it because it's a splendid place to 
spend the day."

A CZECH REFUGEE RETURNS, FINDING FAMILY AND HOPE ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By DENIS D. GRAY, ASSOCIATED PRESS

<DATELINE>
<P>
PILSEN, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly four decades after fleeing my homeland as a little boy, I walked past 
the house where I was born, past the 15th-Century cathedral where generations 
of my family were married. At the end of an avenue dusted by morning snow, I 
rang a doorbell. 
</P>
<P>
A lady with white hair appeared. For a few moments we looked at each other 
silently, then fell into a long embrace. "Zdenku, Zdenku," Aunt Vlasta sobbed. 
"We knew you would come back one day. We knew you would come home." 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-nine years ago I had leaped off a moving train into the darkness and run 
through frontier forests that gave cover to thousands of us -- refugees fleeing 
the Stalinist gloom into which Eastern Europe was receding. 
</P>
<P>
I knew nothing about communism or the Iron Curtain and little of what we -- me, 
my mother, my younger sister and our guide -- were doing that summer night in 
1951. 
</P>
<P>
But filtered through a child's sensitivity, the forest rustle became a sinister 
pursuer. And with the dawn -- caught exposed in a wheat field -- came palpable 
terror: Our mysterious guide was grappling with a border guard and all of us 
were running, running. . . . 
</P>
<P>
We survived, crossing the Czech-Austrian border and finally being smuggled into 
that great refugee haven of the Cold War: the sector of Vienna occupied by 
American forces. 
</P>
<P>
Ahead was a joyful reunion with my father, who had been forced to flee a year 
earlier, and freedom for me and my family. We severed our links to the past, 
gave up traditions, property, friendships, even our Czech names. 
</P>
<P>
The country and relatives we left behind went through the iron rule of the 
1950s, the dashed hopes of the 1968 Prague Spring, and last year's bloodless 
uprising that allowed me to re-establish ties without fear that my relatives 
would be jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
On the afternoon of my return, my uncle, Slava Mecir, called my father in 
California. The two brothers -- very close as boys and young men -- had not 
talked to each other since 1950 when my father, a rising young politician 
vocally opposed to Communist rule, was warned of his impending arrest and 
managed to flee with the help of a Roman Catholic priest. 
</P>
<P>
That evening, uncle and aunt, cousins and their children -- three generations 
that ideology had separated from me -- talked and talked. We planned the coming 
days together and brought out bottles of the slightly bitter beer for which 
Pilsen is renowned. 
</P>
<P>
"To a new, better Czechoslovakia," we toasted. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened last year, our 'Velvet Revolution,' was indescribably wonderful, 
although I won't live long enough to enjoy its fruits," my 76-year-old uncle 
said. "But perhaps my children or grandchildren will." 
</P>
<P>
Two of the grandchildren -- lovely and lanky Petra and Michaela -- proudly told 
how they organized protests and traveled to factories and farms to explain 
democratic demands. Petra, a molecular biology student at Prague's Charles 
University, had donned a Santa Claus outfit to deliver sacks of coal and 
potatoes to the doors of communist leaders to mock and rattle the fallen order. 
</P>
<P>
While both talked of job opportunities and perhaps scholarships in the West, 
the stories of my uncle and aunt sadly showed that they and their generation 
could have made far more of their lives and abilities. 
</P>
<P>
Well-educated and capable, Slava was running factories and other businesses 
owned by his in-laws before the 1948 Communist takeover. Then all the 
businesses were summarily nationalized without compensation and Slava spent 
seven years in forests chopping down trees. 
</P>
<P>
During the Stalinist era, many people in Pilsen disappeared. Others, less lucky 
than ourselves, were shot or captured trying to breach the Iron Curtain. Slava 
was shadowed, threatened and interrogated about my father by the STB, the 
dreaded secret police which was recently abolished. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, while I was attending Yale University and my father was 
succeeding as an executive at IBM in Paris and New York, Slava was employed as 
an administrator at an institute of physical education. Eva, one of his 
daughters with whom I played as a child, was refused admission to the college 
of her choice because of her "bourgeois-capitalist background." 
</P>
<P>
Slava retained his dignity and a sense of humor. But like most Czechs, Eva told 
me, her father made his compromises with a system he privately detested but 
felt incapable of changing. He kept a low profile and avoided the ideologues. 
He focused his life on his family's happiness and as much economic well-being 
as was possible. 
</P>
<P>
The Prague Spring brought momentary hope to my relatives, as it did to millions 
of Czechs. They began exploratory contact through letters to an aunt. Then the 
Soviet tanks came. 
</P>
<P>
"Good day," my uncle greeted a passer-by as we strolled together through 
Pilsen. "Your father knew that man," he said to me. "He was Pilsen's master 
tailor. In 1968 he took out an old American flag and flew it. For that he was 
made a furnace stoker. It happened to many." 
</P>
<P>
We walked through the streets and main square of the inner city, my uncle 
persuading me that my vague remembrance of Old World charm was not mere 
nostalgia. But grime now coated once stately residences and even historic 
buildings were dilapidated behind painted facades. Slava pointed to the 
scaffolding around the city's symbol -- the cathedral tower. 
</P>
<P>
"For each of the past six years, newspapers wrote that the tower would be 
repaired by year's end," he said with a wry smile. "But in this great workers' 
state they couldn't even organize the clearing of the meter-thick layer of 
pigeon droppings in the belfry." 
</P>
<P>
"The past 41 years have been an endless parade of stupidities; the state robbed 
the people and the people tried to rob the state," my uncle said. "Work and 
ability didn't matter. More important was turning up for the May 1 parade." 
</P>
<P>
Eva, sensitive and perceptive, described people as sleepwalking through the 
workweek; speaking one way and thinking another, even avoiding friendships for 
fear of betrayal. 
</P>
<P>
"We withdrew into ourselves and our families. We longed for the Saturdays and 
Sundays," she said. "Now let's hope that we can look beyond and treat one 
another with more kindness. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Before I left the city of my birth, I had a private reunion with someone I had 
missed most over the years, perhaps because I never got to know the full man, 
and because boys make idols of their grandfathers. 
</P>
<P>
His grave lay on the crest of a hill, watched over by pale birches and barren 
oaks bending to an icy wind. Patches of snow and flowers withered by winter 
covered the raised earth. 
</P>
<P>
"It just can't go on like this. The Communists are bound to crack soon," my 
uncle said grandfather told him before he died in 1965, full of hope until the 
end. 
</P>
<P>
In his youth, grandfather had dreamed of a Czechoslovakia independent of the 
Austro-Hungarian Empire, so he deserted the emperor's army. Alongside the 
Allies, he fought at Verdun and other murderous battlefields of World War I. 
</P>
<P>
Independence was won, but the Communists would take away grandfather's 
property, his basic freedoms and, in a sense, half his family. His son, my 
father, stood up bravely until hopeless odds drove him into exile. 
</P>
<P>
Now a third generation of our family is trying for a more decent Czech way, 
with Michaela marching on the streets of Prague and Petra playing Santa Claus 
to thumb his nose at the old Communist leaders.

'UNSEXY' CASES PASSED OVER BY STRAPPED HIGH COURT; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: LEGAL EXPERTS SAY HOLDUPS IN RESOLVING CIVIL ISSUES ARE CAUSING 
CONFUSION AND UNCERTAINTY IN THE STATE'S LOWER COURTS. 
</P>

<P>
Can school districts impose special taxes on developers? Must the Legislature 
fund abortions for the poor? Can tobacco companies be sued for smoking-related 
deaths? Do involuntary mental patients have the right to refuse anti-psychotic 
drugs? Can a hospital test new mothers for drug use and report the results to 
child-protection authorities? 
</P>
<P>
Those are some of the provocative and far-reaching legal questions the state 
Supreme Court decided not to hear during the last year. 
</P>
<P>
There may be sound reasons to deny review in any single case, but the 
collective impact of the court's inability to decide a wide-range of issues is 
causing growing concern in the legal community. No one really faults the court. 
But two years after a special study of its congested docket, it appears the 
justices are still so burdened with capital punishment cases, lawyer discipline 
reviews and other time-consuming problems that they are neglecting important 
questions -- particularly in civil law. 
</P>
<P>
Legal experts say the resulting delay in resolving civil issues is causing 
increasing confusion and uncertainty in the lower courts -- as judges, lawyers 
and litigants lack the firm and clear judicial precedents they need from the 
state's highest court. 
</P>
<P>
"The court simply is not taking a lot of cases critical to civil justice -- it 
just doesn't have the time," said attorney Barry R. Levy of Encino. "This is a 
very hard-working court and it's trying awfully hard -- but there is just so 
much seven people can do." 
</P>
<P>
"I try to keep my rose-colored glasses on when I hear that very few civil cases 
are going to get the court's attention," Beverly Hills lawyer Pamela E. Dunn 
said after the justices refused to hear her appeal of a novel sex-harassment 
decision against a Long Beach physician. "But it looks more and more like 
that's going to be the case. And that's very sad for all litigants." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Leonard Sacks of Encino noted that in such fields as personal injury, 
property loss and insurance coverage, the court has refused to hear dozens of 
appeals, while at the same time preventing the lower-court ruling in similar 
cases to be used as precedent. "This leaves everyone in a quandary," Sacks 
said. "I admit this is not a sexy area of the law, but it does affect a lot of 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, through an aide, denied that a backlog of 
capital punishment cases is having an adverse impact on the court or that 
important civil issues are suffering from neglect. 
</P>
<P>
The court may grant a review with a minimum of four votes from its seven 
members. The reason for denial is not announced -- but it may mean that the 
justices essentially agree with the lower-court ruling or that they want an 
issue to "percolate" more in the lower courts, the aide noted. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, however, did allude to the caseload problem in his State of the 
Judiciary address to the Legislature recently, when he underscored one aspect 
of the system that has remained unchanged since 1879 -- the size of the state 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
"There were seven justices then and there are seven justices now," he told the 
lawmakers. "In that time, however, the numbers of people, of lawyers, of cases 
filed and of lower court judges have increased exponentially." 
</P>
<P>
Lengthy and complex capital cases continue to flow steadily into the high court 
-- and despite a record output of 88 death-penalty decisions by the justices 
since 1987, they still face a staggering backlog of 185 such cases. That 
exceeds the capital caseload that existed in 1987 when Lucas replaced former 
Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird, who was defeated by the voters in the wake 
of an angry attack on the Bird court's reluctance to uphold death sentences. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, as the court awaits implementation of a new State Bar professional 
discipline system, the justices have been forced to hear arguments in 46 
relatively insignificant lawyer disbarment and suspension proceedings 
representing a disproportionate 50% of their calendar over the last year. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the problem are the inherent delays caused by recent changes in the 
court's membership and the justices' implementation of new internal operating 
procedures. And all that was further complicated by the devastating Oct. 17 
earthquake that forced the court into cramped, makeshift quarters and forced 
postponement of a month's slate of cases to be argued. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, California's population continues to surge upward -- and with it, 
the number of cases working their way through the state's vast court system. 
Last year, total case filings reached nearly 18 million -- almost double the 
number 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, in defending the court, points to a series of changes in internal 
procedures that promise long-term results. 
</P>
<P>
"The Supreme Court is in the process of assimilating a number of major changes, 
both in its internal operations and membership," he said in a statement in 
response to questions from The Times. "It has no immediate plans for additional 
modifications. Nonetheless, as has long been the case, the court remains 
receptive to changes that will help it fairly and expeditiously handle its 
workload." 
</P>
<P>
Legal experts say such changes are needed but see little prospect of immediate 
reform. For one thing, a major revision in the way death-penalty cases are 
reviewed -- such as routing them through the Courts of Appeal for much-needed 
refinement of the issues before they get to the high court -- would require an 
amendment to the state Constitution. Making any such change in the law is 
arduous in itself, and the task would be doubly complicated by the volatile 
nature of capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
"The court cannot be expected to involve itself in a political controversy," 
said Shirley M. Hufstedler, a Los Angeles attorney and former federal appeals 
court judge who served on the study commission. "There has to be some 
leadership shown here . . . by the bar, the Legislature and the public. But we 
all know the death penalty is such a hot topic emotionally and politically that 
nobody wants to tackle it." 
</P>
<P>
Other authorities say the justices should take the lead and ask for changes in 
death-penalty procedures that would streamline the process. "Nothing will 
happen until the court itself gets on the bandwagon," said Gerald F. Uelmen, 
law dean at Santa Clara University. 
</P>
<P>
There are warnings that without additional reforms, the capital caseload by 
itself will discourage aspirants to the high court. Justices John A. Arguelles 
and Marcus M. Kaufman have chosen to retire despite serving on the court less 
than three years. Although neither publicly cited the caseload as the reason 
for stepping down, both acknowledged that the load was a difficult one for the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
"The burden is very, very heavy at the Supreme Court," says State Court of 
Appeal Justice Harry Low of San Francisco, another commission member. "Five 
years from now, 10 years from now, will anyone want to subject themselves to 
that huge volume of work all the time? Some new methods have to be looked at. . 
. . If you spend all your energy on death cases, civil cases have to be 
neglected." 
</P>
<P>
Soon after he became chief justice, Lucas appointed the 10-member commission of 
judges and lawyers to study court procedures and recommend steps to speed the 
work of the justices. 
</P>
<P>
The panel came back with 17 recommendations for change -- most of them 
technical and undramatic but welcomed by the court nonetheless. Since then, in 
line with commission suggestions, the court has adopted new internal procedural 
deadlines, installed additional computer technology and bolstered its staff of 
research attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Since January, 1989, the court at its own initiative has followed a new system 
in which it issues decisions within 90 days after cases are argued. The aim is 
to give the justices more time to distill the issues in a case before argument 
-- and then to provide a reasonably prompt decision. "The court believes the 
new procedures may ultimately result in a speedier disposition of cases," said 
Lynn Holton, the court's public information officer. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the innovations, there is little indication that the court's 
burdens are becoming significantly lighter. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Lucas became chief justice and three new appointees of Gov. 
George Deukmejian joined the court in early 1987, the justices began a 
ferocious attack on the backlog of capital punishment cases they receive on 
automatic appeals from the state's trial courts. 
</P>
<P>
In full swing by 1988, the Lucas Court decided a record 56 death-penalty cases. 
In 1989, the pace slackened, but the court still turned out 27 death-penalty 
decisions. Nonetheless, as death verdicts continue to stream in from the trial 
courts, the backlog of such cases reached 185 at the end of January -- a net 
increase of 14 from the 171 that were pending when Lucas took over from Bird 
nearly three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
There has been some progress in reducing the backlog of civil and non-capital 
criminal cases. In February, 1987, there were 211 such cases awaiting 
decisions; currently there are 142. But cases continue to stream into the court 
at the rate of up to 180 a week -- triple the load of 25 years ago. And the 
justices must spend up to 50% of their time simply determining which of these 
cases to review. 
</P>
<P>
By mid-1989, the revamped court was turning out decisions at generally the same 
rate of the court under Bird. But a study by law dean Uelmen, published in the 
California Lawyer, showed a significant change in the nature of those 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
In Bird's final year, 50% of the court's opinions came in civil cases. In the 
following two years under Lucas, that percentage dropped sharply to 33%, and 
then 29%, Uelmen's research showed. 
</P>
<P>
By the same token, Uelmen's study revealed that the Lucas Court has made far 
greater use of the process known as "depublication," in which the justices 
allow an appeals court decision to stand for the parties in a particular case 
but bar the ruling from being used as precedent. 
</P>
<P>
The process allows the high court to effectively erase a decision from the 
lawbooks without having to grant review, hear arguments and write its own 
decision. While the Bird court depublished 114 cases in its final year, the 
Lucas Court raised that number to 126 and 142 in the next two years, Uelmen's 
study showed. 
</P>
<P>
Depublication is defended as a necessary tool for a high court that cannot 
possibly grant a review in every case it would want to hear from the state's 
far-flung, 88-member state Court of Appeal. But many legal experts say heavy 
use of the device is bound to create uncertainty in the lower courts. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not the way to run a railroad," said attorney Hufstedler. "But the 
court can't take on enough of these cases in order to harmonize the law. The 
capacity just isn't there to do it." 
</P>
<P>
On another front, the current court finds itself still saddled with 
professional discipline cases in which lawyers are contesting recommendations 
by the State Bar for their suspension or disbarment. Critics have long urged 
that such relatively routine cases be handled in a different process. 
</P>
<P>
The special commission, chaired by retired state Supreme Court Justice Frank K. 
Richardson, recommended that instead of sending bar-discipline cases directly 
to the high court, such cases be transferred for review by the state Court of 
Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature responded by changing the law to permit such transfer. But the 
State Bar asked the high court to maintain its jurisdiction while the bar 
implements a new disciplinary system -- including a recently organized State 
Bar Court that ultimately will issue decisions the high court can let stand 
without conducting its own review. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the justices are still hearing and deciding an inordinately 
high number of lawyer-discipline cases that, although of importance to the 
parties and profession, have little broad impact. By unofficial count, of the 
149 rulings issued by the state Supreme Court since January, 1989, 46 have 
involved lawyer suspensions and disbarment. 
</P>
<P>
Holton, the chief justice's spokeswoman, said that before relinquishing 
jurisdiction in such cases, the high court wants to monitor the progress of the 
new State Bar Court, which began operation only last fall. Holton noted that 
the State Bar asked the justices to retain jurisdiction, at least for now, to 
ensure consistency in the law governing lawyer discipline. 
</P>
<P>
Necessary or not, there is little indication the justices relish spending time 
reviewing appeals by lawyers who want to avoid professional punishment. "I 
don't know why they need a State Bar Court," one court member recently remarked 
ruefully. "They've got one right here at the Supreme Court."

Horticultural geneticists and plant enzymologists seldom talk to each other. 
The two branches of botany use the same language but their dialects are so 
different they rarely translate works to compare notes. 
</P>
<P>
But at Texas Tech's Plant Stress and Water Conservation Lab, scientists from a 
number of disciplines have learned to speak a common language: drought. 
</P>
<P>
"Most enzymologists talk only with enzymologists," said James Mahan, a plant 
physiologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. "But here, I talk to all 
sorts of different people. That's why this interdisciplinary approach is so 
important." 
</P>
<P>
The lab's goal is to find varieties of wheat, corn, cotton, onions and other 
plants that can survive the harsh weather of the Great Plains stretching from 
Canada to Texas, with its frequent drought, bitter cold and stifling heat. 
</P>
<P>
The results include drought-resistant cotton and wheat, a sorghum resistant to 
insects called midges, and grapevines with tougher leaves to withstand hail. 
</P>
<P>
Although it focuses on U.S. crops and conditions, the research has 
international implications, said Robert Albin, associate dean of research at 
Texas Tech's College of Agricultural Sciences. "In Lubbock, we're 
representative of the arid and semiarid areas of the world, such as central and 
western Africa. A large part of the world's land surface is semiarid." 
</P>
<P>
John Burke, another USDA scientist studying plant enzymes, said almost all the 
research has international applications: "These crops are grown throughout the 
world. This research holds true no matter where you are." 
</P>
<P>
Burke works with Ellen Peffley, a Texas Tech assistant professor of 
horticulture specializing in onion genetics. She is trying to develop onions 
that can withstand extreme cold. Burke identifies enzymes that make onions more 
cold-hardy, and Peffley tries to get the onions to make those enzymes. 
</P>
<P>
"As we discover the basic mechanics, this can be applied to all crop species," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 scientists and graduate students from Texas Tech, the USDA and 
Texas A&amp;M participate in the research at various labs and agriculture 
stations; there is no centralized lab -- a major shortcoming that Texas Tech is 
moving to counter with a $500,000 federal grant toward planning a $17-million 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets to be quite complicated and we have to keep people together and 
coordinated," Albin said. "We're in such a specialized area of research. You 
might have a molecular scientist discover something important, but he doesn't 
know how to grow the plant, so you have the A&amp;M research station for that. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to keep coordination in mind. A geneticist might get caught up 
transferring gene A into plant B and lose sight of what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
Congress formally created the Plant Stress and Water Conservation Lab in 1988, 
but the research had been going on at Texas Tech since the late 1950s. The USDA 
picked Lubbock as the center of the research because of the university, the 
lack of rain, and temperatures that drop below zero in winter and soar above 
100 in summer. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists affiliated with the lab are enthusiastic, although they sometimes 
are at a loss for words to explain their research in lay terms -- or in those 
of scientists from other fields. 
</P>
<P>
"We have some sort of common goal in mind," said Henry Nguyen, a Tech associate 
professor who specializes in finding drought-resistant cereals. "We see how we 
can mutually benefit each other with our kinds of techniques. 
</P>
<P>
"It just takes a lot of patience talking, until we understand what each other 
is doing."

THREATENED COLOMBIANS DEAL WITH ANXIETY, ISOLATION

<TEXT>
<P>
For Colombians battling the drug establishment, life is lived in a sealed, 
guarded box. Breaking out can mean death at the hands of terrorists waiting 
patiently outside. 
</P>
<P>
Jaime Pardo Leal, the leftist Union Patriotic Party leader, ventured out in 
1987, only to be assassinated as he drove near his farm west of Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
So stifling had his box become that Pardo "said that life was ending for him," 
said a friend, Bogota criminal court Judge Consuelo Herrera. 
</P>
<P>
"He couldn't go to public places. He felt his intimacy with his family was 
being destroyed by the presence of bodyguards and security measures. Finally he 
couldn't take it anymore and broke out." 
</P>
<P>
A normal reaction, psychologists say, for the politicians, journalists, judges 
and others living under death threats from the cocaine cartels. 
</P>
<P>
Often, a deadly one. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera said Pardo had begun to drive with his family to their farm without 
first telling the national intelligence police, who had been providing 
bodyguards for him. 
</P>
<P>
"He was killed because he did not have the necessary protection. He always said 
that he was not important enough for anyone to try to kill him," Herrera said 
in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
So alarmed is the nation over death threats -- and the threat of threats -- 
that executives have become accustomed to traveling with bodyguards carrying 
submachine guns. Private guards wearing bulletproof vests and dark glasses can 
often be seen standing outside chic restaurants while their charges dine. 
</P>
<P>
Although Herrera said she has not been threatened, other judges have. 
Thirty-six have been assassinated over the last 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
"The first response by many people who have received a threat is to try to put 
it out of their mind," Bogota psychologist Leonidas Castro said in a recent 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
"It is most important that people at risk take an active role in protecting 
themselves, that they avoid the image of themselves as helpless targets," said 
Castro, who specializes in treating the stress and anxiety of high-risk 
officials. "That feeling of helplessness is the source for anxiety that can be 
as bad or worse than the threat itself." 
</P>
<P>
Many threatened Colombians, Herrera said, "feel alone and won't talk about the 
problem, but I've seen their worry and fear affect their families like a 
poison." 
</P>
<P>
One journalist who received several threats said that, at first, he felt the 
problem was not "radical enough" to cause him to change his life style. 
</P>
<P>
Later, though, he relayed the threats to the intelligence police, who said they 
had evidence that a contract had been put out on his life. He left the country. 
</P>
<P>
Judges do not usually have that option. 
</P>
<P>
"For judges, leaving the country or installing a home security system is rarely 
an option," said Herrera, "We will often have to fight a major battle just to 
get an extra government bodyguard for a threatened judge." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, even affording psychological help can be difficult for judges, who earn 
an average of $380 a month but who would have to pay $25 to $100 an hour, by 
Castro's estimate, to see a psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
Although judges handling drug cases should take threats seriously, Colombians 
not directly involved with the cartels need not live in fear, Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
"A Colombian bank president who has not received any specific threat can lead a 
perfectly normal life," the psychologist said.

KABUL, Afghanistan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rev. Angelo Panigati stood directly under a crucifix when a bomb landed 
nearby, gutting the Italian Embassy and sending the Roman Catholic priest 
scurrying for cover. 
</P>
<P>
Following his two dogs through a broken pane of glass into his chapel, Panigati 
took refuge with his pups in a corner. More bombs came, shaking the embassy 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday -- his first since the recent bloody coup attempt -- the 
65-year-old ruddy-faced Italian prayed for the Afghan people. He appeared to 
give no thought to his own brush with death. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe in miracles," said Panigati, who's been in Afghanistan since 
he was 40. "But I'm about to." 
</P>
<P>
His congregation, a gathering of 12, laughed. Last Sunday services were moved 
to Panigati's living room while the bomb-damaged chapel underwent repairs. 
</P>
<P>
The Italian Embassy and surrounding buildings were just several of scores of 
structures around Kabul destroyed by bombs dropped by renegade fighter pilots. 
At least 95 civilians were killed and 197 injured in the failed coup. No 
military casualties have been released. 
</P>
<P>
No one was in the embassy at the time of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Western missions left Afghanistan a little more than a year ago as Soviet 
troops withdrew after a 10-year intervention, wrongly expecting the swift 
collapse of President Najibullah's government at the hands of Muslim 
guerrillas. Kabul now has just 21 functioning foreign embassies. 
</P>
<P>
The coup appears to have put on hold plans by some Western countries to return. 
Planned low-level diplomatic visits from Italy, Austria, France and Britain 
have been postponed, diplomats say. 
</P>
<P>
At the Italian compound, the bomb blew out windows in the embassy, bending the 
reinforced steel on the windows like rubber. Windows were knocked out in the 
chapel 300 feet away and in Panigati's house next door. 
</P>
<P>
A crater 10 feet deep and 20 feet wide yawned opposite the embassy. 
</P>
<P>
The father's beloved greenhouse was also gutted. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll just have to start it all over again," he said as he surveyed the damage, 
dressed in an Afghan sweater and an apron decorated with blue ducks. 
</P>
<P>
It won't be the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Since the civil war began in the late 1970s, Panigati has experienced rocket 
attacks and raining flares, which Soviet planes drop to confuse heat-seeking 
missiles as they circle Kabul. 
</P>
<P>
Everything seems to hit the greenhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"Flares are the fruit of Kabul," he said with a chuckle. "Instead of cherries 
or apples we get these." 
</P>
<P>
The priest opened a drawer in his living room revealing a collection of 
hundreds of spent flares. 
</P>
<P>
Panigati belongs to the Barnabites, a Catholic order founded in 1533. The 
Barnabites opened their mission in Afghanistan on Jan. 1, 1933, after an 
agreement between the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, the Vatican and the 
Afghan government. 
</P>
<P>
Fascist Italy was the second government after the Soviet Union to recognize 
King Amanullah Khan, so the Afghan government welcomed Italian priests. 
</P>
<P>
Panigati's mission has been limited to serving the foreign community. No 
missionary work is allowed. But the priest, who speaks 10 languages, has been 
allowed to teach. 
</P>
<P>
All of Kabul's secondary schools are closed now -- the war -- so he has private 
students. 
</P>
<P>
Panigati said his close call with the bomb didn't frighten him. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been through all of this before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
During World War II, a German soldier was shot in Panigati's town and Germans 
decided to take revenge by killing some civilians. Panigati was one of those 
chosen to die. 
</P>
<P>
"They put me against the wall to shoot me but then bombings began and I ran 
off." 
</P>
<P>
Later, he was on his way to the Dachau concentration camp when another bombing 
attack derailed the train. Panigati said he escaped into a corn field. 
</P>
<P>
The other day, after the fighting ended, Panigati said he awoke to a "beautiful 
symphony." 
</P>
<P>
"It was a symphony of sweeping glass," he said. "Everywhere around me, I heard 
the sound and I thought, 'Lord, how good it is for us to be here.' "

'OFFICIAL ENGLISH' STATUTES IN SOME STATES BREED HOT WORDS AND MISUNDERSTANDING

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sign said "No Ingles, No Travato" -- a mangled attempt at the Spanish for 
"No English, No Work." 
</P>
<P>
But even if it had been spelled right -- "No Ingles, No Trabajo" -- the placard 
posted outside a construction site near Greeley probably would have been 
illegal, state and federal officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Jorge Amaya, state director of the League of United Latin American Citizens, 
said he confronted the construction foreman at the Sand Livestock Systems 
construction trailer earlier last month, the day he spotted the sign. 
</P>
<P>
"That sign was telling a whole group of people to get lost, and that's 
discrimination," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's exactly the kind of thing we feared when the official English amendment 
passed (in a 1988 referendum). I'll tell you, if we put up a sign saying: 'No 
more white people,' we'd get nailed in seconds." 
</P>
<P>
The posting marks the latest shot fired in the battle over "Official English" 
statutes, which have been enacted in dozens of states in the last few years. 
They are intended to discourage bilingual education and other concessions to 
non-English-speaking immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier last month, a federal judge in Phoenix tossed out Arizona's Official 
English law, saying it violated the right to free speech. That law required 
state and county governments in Arizona to conduct most of their business in 
English only. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado's constitutional amendment is less specific -- it simply declares 
English to be the official state language, without describing what that means. 
</P>
<P>
To officials at a hog farm under construction for National Farms in Kersey, 
about 10 miles east of Greeley in north-central Colorado, the amendment meant 
that Spanish-speakers could be discouraged from applying for work. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some pretty poor communications around here," said project 
superintendent Al Benson. "We were getting so many people who couldn't speak 
English. For example, I have a cement finisher I can't even talk to." 
</P>
<P>
The sign was posted last summer, Benson said. He insisted that it was legal. 
</P>
<P>
"We checked," he said. "Because of the English-only bill we know it's legal." 
</P>
<P>
But state and federal officials disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Gibbs, regional officer for the Colorado Civil Rights Commission in Greeley, 
said the sign was "definitely illegal." 
</P>
<P>
No one had filed a complaint with his office, but Gibbs said he would 
investigate the incident and the company could be ordered to pay damages to 
anyone who could prove that they were discriminated against because of the 
sign. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Esquibel of the U.S. Labor Department said the sign is "probably illegal" 
because the construction business isn't one that requires English to be spoken. 
</P>
<P>
Another Labor Department official, Loren Gilbert, said that unless English is 
an occupational qualification -- as, for example, for a disc jockey -- it is 
illegal to refuse to hire people because they don't speak the language. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't tell me that English is a requirement for digging post holes," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Amaya of the League of United Latin American Citizens said he intends to file 
complaints with the Labor Department and the state civil rights commission. 
</P>
<P>
The local manager for National Farms, Bill O'Hare, said he had been unaware of 
the subcontractor's sign. He said National Farms allows "all people to apply 
for jobs and we do not discriminate in any manner."

IF A BELL TOLLS IN ITALY, IT'S LIKELY A MARINELLI 
</P>

</BYLINE>

AGNONE, Italy 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You may wonder for whom the bell tolls, but if you hear it ringing in Italy, 
the chances are it was forged by the Marinellis of Agnone. 
</P>
<P>
The Marinelli family was making bells in this mountaintop town near Naples 
before the Black Death ravaged Europe, before Gutenberg invented movable type, 
before Columbus discovered America. 
</P>
<P>
By 1624, when English poet John Donne wrote the immortal line: " . . . Never 
send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee," the Marinelli's were 
nearing their fourth century in business. 
</P>
<P>
For the last 651 years they have been making bells, huge and small, pretty much 
the same way Nicodemus Marinelli first forged them here in 1339, founding what 
is perhaps Italy's oldest business dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
They are still jealous custodians of a world where technology is suspect and 
tradition is gospel. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, if Nicodemus were to walk into the dark and cavernous earthen-floored 
foundry today, he would probably feel comfortable enough to sit right down and 
get to work. 
</P>
<P>
Oak from nearby forests still fires up the coal to melt bronze. Bricks, clay 
and wax are still used the same way to make casts and molds. The molten bronze 
is still hand-poured by workers using pots on long poles. 
</P>
<P>
The only concessions to the 20th Century are an air compressor replacing 
bellows to help heat bronze to 2,200 degrees and a motor to help lift big 
bells, which can weigh as much as five tons, out of the casting pit. 
</P>
<P>
"High technology leads us to products that are repetitive," Pasquale Marinelli, 
69, the current family patriarch, said. 
</P>
<P>
The procedure begins with a solid, bell-shaped brick core covered by a thin 
layer of clay to create a smooth surface. 
</P>
<P>
A "false bell" is created with a second layer of clay molded in the exact shape 
of the intended finished product. Wax decorations in relief, such as saints' 
images or commemorative lettering, are applied. 
</P>
<P>
This is covered by another, much thicker, layer of clay called a mantle. After 
it has dried -- and has assumed the negative impressions of the decorations on 
its inside -- the mantle is lifted intact. 
</P>
<P>
The "false bell" layer is chipped away and the mantle is lowered over the 
original inner core. Everything is buried in a sand pit and molten bronze is 
poured into the space once occupied by the "false bell." The whole thing is 
then allowed to cool for days. 
</P>
<P>
To help everything go just right, the workers recite a litany to the Madonna as 
they pour the blinding bronze. They laud her with 50 different titles, starting 
with "Holy Mary" and ending with "Queen of Peace." 
</P>
<P>
Thus were born some of Italy's great bells, such as those of the Abbey at 
Montecassino, Rome's Basilica of St. Paul, the Sanctuary of Pompeii and Orvieto 
Cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
Countless smaller ones have called Italians to baptisms, marriages and funerals 
in medieval and modern churches throughout the country. As Shakespeare put it 
in Macbeth, the sound of a bell "is a knell that summons thee to heaven or to 
hell." 
</P>
<P>
To reward them for service to the Church, Pope Pius XI in 1924 decreed that the 
Marinellis, who have exported bells to five continents, could call their 
business a pontifical foundry. 
</P>
<P>
The standard-bearers of all this tradition, who will take the Marinelli name 
into the next millennium, are Pasquale's nephews, Armando, 29, and Pasqualino, 
19. 
</P>
<P>
"We are born with this in our blood. It's almost supernatural. It's bigger than 
you," said Armando. 
</P>
<P>
"One person does not have a right to interrupt a tradition that has been going 
on for so many centuries," he mused while supervising the casting of several 
small bells in the foundry, which has a dozen workers. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, foreman Antonio Delli Quadri, 52, represents the fourth generation 
of his family to work for the business, a tradition within a tradition. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s and 1970s many newly-constructed churches opted for tape 
recordings and speakers. But this backfired, Armando said, when parishioners 
demanded real bells. The backlash resulted in a mini-boom for his business. 
</P>
<P>
"What's a church without a bell," he said, wrinkling his nose.

CZECH CASTLE A MYSTERY TO NEW OCCUPANTS

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prague's Hradcany Castle, an imposing and remote seat of power -- first for 
Bohemian kings, then for hard-line Communists -- is still something of a 
mystery to its latest occupants. 
</P>
<P>
Vaclav Havel's election as president of Czechoslovakia on Dec. 29 put a dozen 
dissident writers and artists into the massive baroque edifice, which dominates 
the city from a hilltop high above the Moldau River. 
</P>
<P>
Eda Kriseova, one of Havel's 12 advisers, described how after his election 
Havel went through the castle's endless corridors saying: "What's behind this 
door? It's locked." 
</P>
<P>
"We're exploring from the center outwards. I don't think we've found all the 
rooms yet," said Havel's press secretary, Michael Zantovsky. 
</P>
<P>
There has been a fortress on the site for 1,000 years. Until 1526 it was the 
seat of the kings of Bohemia. Then the region became part of the 
Austro-Hungarian Empire and the capital moved to Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
The castle has been the presidential residence since the Czechoslovak republic 
was declared in 1918. 
</P>
<P>
Postwar Stalinist leader Klement Gottwald had a villa built in the grounds. 
Havel's hard-line predecessor, Gustav Husak, also lived there, although he 
worked mostly from the Communist Party Central Committee building. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like moving into a haunted castle," Zantovsky said. "There were cobwebs 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"We found huge numbers of people working here. Some must have routine jobs like 
gardening and cleaning. Some must have other jobs but I don't know what they 
are," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you at times we laugh a lot." 
</P>
<P>
The new team has been in the castle only a few weeks and their brightly-lit 
offices still have a rather temporary air. 
</P>
<P>
The walls are lined with still-empty shelves and there are cardboard boxes 
scattered around. 
</P>
<P>
Telephones ring constantly and are often left unanswered. Young, 
casually-dressed assistants scurry from room to room. 
</P>
<P>
There are even rumors in Prague that under the new, informal occupancy, staff 
use scooters to get around the building. 
</P>
<P>
The castle's views of Prague are fantastic, but the staff are not so delighted 
with the socialist-realist paintings inherited from Husak. 
</P>
<P>
A painter friend of Havel went around galleries and studios borrowing paintings 
before a visit by French Culture Minister Jack Lang, an admirer of modern art. 
</P>
<P>
Havel has his own bodyguards but the rest of the security staff are left over 
from the old regime. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the 'bugs' are still here but we have the advantage that we don't 
have too many secrets to keep," Zantovsky said. 
</P>
<P>
The advisers are old friends of Havel. "He wants to have people he knows next 
to him. He wants to work with people he trusts. We can't abandon him and leave 
him on his own," Kriseova said.

There is hardly a wall in Prague these days that does not have a poster of 
Havel, the dissident-turned-president who has become an international symbol of 
the country's upheavals. 
</P>
<P>
One of Zantovsky's main tasks is to keep people away from Havel so he can get 
on with his work. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that the president is a very kind man and when a journalist 
speaks to him at the theater or at a meeting and asks for an interview, he says 
yes and they come to me asking for the interview. 
</P>
<P>
"But he is also a very busy man and tells me not to grant any interviews. I 
think we have just cleared the backlog of requests from during the revolution." 
</P>
<P>
The country's first non-Communist president in more than 40 years faces a 
daunting task. 
</P>
<P>
"He is president for only six months and in that time he must radically alter 
the political system," Zantovsky said. 
</P>
<P>
Havel has pledged to lead the country to free elections scheduled for June and 
then step down, although he has not ruled out running again. 
</P>
<P>
"His main task is to build a new presidency," Kriseova said. "He wants to make 
a new image, create a new role as president."

FOSTER MOMS GET OFF WELFARE, ON SALARY 
</P>

Fourteen women who were once on welfare have found jobs doing what they know 
best -- being moms. 
</P>
<P>
They have been taken off government assistance and are earning $21,000 a year 
as foster mothers to disabled youngsters under a state program called LIFE 
(Living in Family Environments). 
</P>
<P>
"These women are capable of doing something, but for the most part, they're 
best at being moms and they're happy being moms," said state Rep. Shirley 
Johnson, who helped to get funds allocated for the program. 
</P>
<P>
"I was scared to death at the beginning. How would you match the right mom with 
the right child? But it has worked beautifully." 
</P>
<P>
The 3-year-old program, which operates primarily on a $200,000 grant from the 
state Department of Mental Health, was the idea of Mounir Sharobeem, president 
of the Judson Center in this Detroit suburb. The center helps abused and 
neglected children and disabled adults. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of stereotyping welfare recipients as lazy, let's train the families, 
let them select a developmentally disabled child and use their time and energy 
more effectively," Sharobeem said. 
</P>
<P>
"People said we would be endangering handicapped children by putting them with 
welfare families, but these families have been doing a great job with them, and 
it's not easy." 
</P>
<P>
Sharobeem said that keeping one child in an institution costs the state mental 
health agency $45,000 a year, and keeping a family of four on welfare costs the 
state $16,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The children also get more personal attention in a private home than in an 
institution, even though there is no father in most of the foster homes, 
Sharobeem said. 
</P>
<P>
The foster mothers are screened and licensed by the Judson Center and receive 
training in the care of disabled children, said Diane Devine-Abdullah, program 
director. 
</P>
<P>
"They go through a seven-day, 28-hour training, then 20 hours of home training 
in a current foster home," she said. "We have four more families ready and 
waiting for placement." 
</P>
<P>
The trained women are matched with children living in Michigan institutions. 
The average age of the youngsters is between 15 and 16, Devine-Abdullah said. 
</P>
<P>
C. Patrick Babcock, state social services director, said that officials want to 
expand the program, but Johnson said that budget constraints won't allow a 
full-scale program. 
</P>
<P>
One mother, Darlene Gisel of Warren, cares for 11-month-old William, who was 
born with tuberculosis of the brain. His condition has been stabilized, but 
could leave him retarded or with a learning disability. 
</P>
<P>
"He was in the hospital six months before I took him," Gisel said. "He didn't 
respond at all. He's gotten farther than they ever thought he would. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of joy in watching them grow. These are kids who probably 
wouldn't have had a chance in life." 
</P>
<P>
Gisel said that her mother also was a foster mom who worked with handicapped 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I wanted to deal with handicapped kids," she said. "They need a little 
more of a chance. I think we can show that they can learn and they can live a 
normal life with a disability." 
</P>
<P>
Mothers in the program also find that the salary allows them to provide for 
their own children better. 
</P>
<P>
Bertha Crawford is foster mother to Dorothy, 17, who cannot dress herself or 
talk. Crawford also has two teen-agers of her own. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good about helping someone else," Crawford said. "It also gave me the 
chance to send my daughter on her senior trip. I couldn't have afforded it 
without the program."

EL SALVADOR CHURCH WORKERS FACE DAILY PERIL

<P>
Their lives are in daily peril, these men and women of various religious orders 
who work among the poor and disenfranchised on the fringes of El Salvador's 
10-year civil war. 
</P>
<P>
They are viewed as subversives, at best, by the military Establishment and the 
conservative government. 
</P>
<P>
To the extremists of the far-right, they are mortal enemies. 
</P>
<P>
"Our only sin is opting for the poor, serving the poor, helping poor 
communities," Lutheran Bishop Medardo Gomez said in January upon his return to 
El Salvador. Gomez, whose church works extensively with refugees and in 
shantytowns, left the country in November as a huge guerrilla offensive by the 
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front convulsed the capital. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez, whose offices have been bombed twice during the last 18 months, received 
repeated death threats before his flight. The rightist government of President 
Alfredo Cristiani deplored the threats. But it also said it could not guarantee 
Gomez's safety. 
</P>
<P>
El Salvador, the size of Massachusetts with 5 million inhabitants, is 
overwhelmingly Roman Catholic. Protestant denominations have established 
congregations in recent decades, and some churches -- including the Lutheran, 
Baptist and Episcopal -- administer programs on behalf of victims of the civil 
war. 
</P>
<P>
The world was shocked on Nov. 16 by the massacre of six Jesuit priests and 
educators -- the leadership of the prestigious Central American University and 
the nucleus of El Salvador's intellectual life. The priests' cook and her 
15-year-old daughter also were slain. 
</P>
<P>
Cristiani announced in January that government soldiers committed the murders, 
perhaps the most heinous politically motivated crime of a civil war infamous 
for its heinous political crimes. He identified four officers, including a 
colonel, and five soldiers as the alleged culprits. Eight of the nine were 
charged with premeditated murder and jailed. One, a soldier, is a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
"It is claimed that what happened was that a small group of members of the 
armed forces have stained the honor of the military institution," Msgr. 
Gregorio Rosa Chavez, auxiliary bishop of San Salvador, said in a recent 
interview. "We find that difficult to accept. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not think these are isolated cases of people who stray from the path of 
an institution. Rather, we think they are the product of a way of thinking, an 
education that views as subversive the work of people like the slain Jesuits, 
the work of church people committed to helping resolve the problems of the 
poor, work on behalf of human rights. 
</P>
<P>
"This education, in the final analysis, teaches that we are the enemy," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The far-right considers the Jesuits to be Marxist ideologues. Throughout the 
civil war, the Jesuits at Central American University have maintained that the 
conflict arose from gross social injustice and that only by addressing its 
causes could it be resolved. This angered the armed forces and the elite, who 
contended that the revolution was the result of international communist 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
The slaying of the Jesuits was not the first murderous attack on a voice from 
the church. 
</P>
<P>
A sniper killed Catholic Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero as he said Mass on 
March 24, 1980, the day after he issued an impassioned plea to army troops to 
disobey orders to kidnap, torture or summarily execute suspected leftists. 
</P>
<P>
The Christian Democratic government that handed power to Cristiani last June 
said it had proof that top figures in Arena, Cristiani's party, plotted the 
murder. But the case became terminally bogged down in a judiciary notorious for 
its inefficiency. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecution of Romero's killers is considered highly unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 2, 1980, national guardsmen kidnaped and killed three U.S. nuns and a 
lay woman church worker. Five soldiers were convicted of the murders, but 
officers implicated in the crime were never prosecuted. The convicted guardsmen 
said they had been told the women were involved in subversive activity. 
</P>
<P>
All four women helped people displaced by the war. Two of them, Sister Dorothy 
Kazel and Jean Donovan, worked with an orphanage 10 miles south of San 
Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
The orphanage -- the Oscar Arnulfo Romero Community -- is home to 154 boys and 
girls whose parents were killed in the war. It represents in microcosm the 
often strained relations between the government and armed forces, on one side, 
and a church that considers its mission more than purely pastoral. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Ken Myers, a diocesan priest and native of Norwalk, Ohio, founded the 
center in August, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The project began "with a dozen real sick orphan children from the refugee 
centers," he said in an interview in his office at the orphanage, just outside 
the small town of Zaragoza. "Within four months we had a hundred, and were 
beyond the capacity of the couple buildings we had in the parish." 
</P>
<P>
With money from the San Salvador archdiocese and donations from the United 
States, the church bought land to augment a donation of several acres by the 
district's biggest landowners. The community now covers 90 acres and has a 
dairy, a chicken coop that produces 2,400 eggs a day, corn, bean and vegetable 
fields and workshops for carpentry, welding, tailoring and sewing. 
</P>
<P>
The school comprises grades one through nine and is the best in the area. 
Besides the orphans, about 650 children from Zaragoza and surrounding villages 
attend, paying a minimal and flexible tuition. 
</P>
<P>
A clinic staffed by a full-time nurse -- a nun from the Houston-based Sisters 
of the Immaculate Word -- treats about 40 poor area residents a day. The number 
rises to about 60 on Tuesdays and Thursdays, when a physician is present. 
</P>
<P>
The orphanage has been the object of official suspicion since its founding, 
Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
"Just the name, Romero, makes it suspicious for some people," he said. Army 
search parties have entered the grounds several times, though the commanding 
officers have been generally polite and the installations have never been 
ransacked, the priest said. 
</P>
<P>
He told how in 1982, an army colonel telephoned him and said authorities had 
received reports that Myers had 500 teen-agers, all boys, at the orphanage. The 
colonel implied it was a guerrilla training camp. 
</P>
<P>
"We had about 150 kids, boys and girls, and nobody over 12," Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
In December, the driver of an orphanage pickup truck taking medicine to the 
countryside was detained for four days on suspicion of abetting the rebels. For 
two weeks after the incident, soldiers checked vehicles entering and leaving 
the compound. 
</P>
<P>
The Catholic Establishment in El Salvador is subject to the ideological debate 
and division that has affected the church in Latin America since the evolution 
of a "theology of liberation" in the 1960s. The doctrine champions the poor and 
oppressed and has placed its exponents in direct confrontation with the 
privileged and powerful in countries where widespread poverty coexists with the 
opulence of a tiny minority. 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen priests and dozens of lay workers identified with liberation theology 
have been slain in El Salvador since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Rosa Chavez and his boss, Archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas, are outspoken critics 
of what they see as repression and injustice, though they likewise strongly 
condemn abuses by the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front. 
</P>
<P>
Government and military officers refer to the two bishops in private as, at 
best, "naive pawns" of leftist rebels or, at worst, outright communist 
militants. 
</P>
<P>
Msgr. Romeo Tobar Astorga, bishop of Zacatecoluca and head of the Salvadoran 
Bishops Conference, is the most visible representative of the conservative, 
virulently anti-socialist sector of the Salvadoran church. 
</P>
<P>
Late last year, in the wake of the guerrilla offensive, Rivera Damas and Rosa 
Chavez denounced what they perceived to be official persecution of church 
workers. Several churches and church dependencies had been raided by troops, 
and dozens of church workers were arrested under state-of-siege emergency 
powers and about 20 foreigners working with church-related organizations were 
expelled. 
</P>
<P>
Rebutting Rivera Damas, Tobar Astorga spoke on the government and armed forces 
radio network, which all stations were obliged to carry. "There is no 
persecution of the church," he said. "The problem is that there are people who 
use the church as a cover for subversive activities." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the armed forces press office included the Catholic Legal Aid office 
in a list of what it considers guerrilla front groups. 
</P>
<P>
It accused the office of saturating the U.S. Congress and the North American 
public with criticism and false human rights violations by the Salvadoran army 
in an effort to provoke a cutoff of U.S. aid. 
</P>
<P>
Washington provides El Salvador more than $1 million a day in economic and 
military assistance. U.S. military analysts say the liberation front would have 
won the civil war by the mid-1980s were it not for U.S. aid. 
</P>
<P>
One of the major church-state rubs has resulted from support provided by 
religious groups for the repatriation from Honduran camps of more than 10,000 
Salvadoran refugees since October, 1987. The refugees fled their homes in the 
north after scorched-earth army sweeps and aerial bombardments in the early 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The government contends that the Honduran camps were little more than 
recruiting and resting places for the guerrilla forces. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 1, Vice President Francisco Merino visited Leanguera, in the war-torn 
northeast, where more than 3,000 refugees have returned in recent weeks under 
the auspices of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and with the 
aid of Catholic and Protestant relief organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Merino sat down at a rustic table in an adobe house -- one of the few 
structures not a bamboo pole and plastic shack -- across from representatives 
of the refugees. He said the visit was a step toward overcoming mutual 
suspicion between the government and church-supported returnees. 
</P>
<P>
"El Salvador is different today from the way it was nine years ago," he said. 
"I'm here to express our goodwill. You may doubt our intentions, and we may 
still have doubts about yours, but with better communication, we can progress 
beyond that."

BRAWNY YANK'S SONGS WIN HEARTS, MINDS IN VIETNAMESE CLUBS

At the Caravelle, in the shadow of Disneyland, singer Rick Murphy's head almost 
touches the ceiling, a problem no one else has in this smoky nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
To many, the 6-foot-3, 225-pound Irish-American from San Diego might seem out 
of place at a club he calls the Copacabana of Southeast Asian entertainment. 
But to the refugees hunched at dimly lit tables, Murphy is nothing less than a 
hero -- a man whose fluent Vietnamese lyrics have won him an international 
following and, along the way, generated pride and admiration among his 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
"Rick is a real phenomenon," said Nam Nguyen, a mechanical engineer from Del 
Cerro. "To those of us who have children, he is the best of both worlds -- an 
American who shows the younger generation what's important about our culture, 
our heritage, our struggle." 
</P>
<P>
Among the 40,000 Vietnamese in San Diego, where he has lived since 1974, Murphy 
is a household name. A frequent performer at Vietnamese clubs throughout 
Southern California, the 35-year-old has, for the past seven years, appeared in 
cafes and restaurants around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen Kim Long, the owner of the Caravelle, said that, to an intensely 
nationalistic people, Murphy is evocative of all that is good about being 
Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
"We are so proud of him," added Nguyen, the mechanical engineer. "To have a 
young man like him, who has worked so hard to learn our culture, our language, 
our customs . . . it is very flattering." 
</P>
<P>
Murpny, a native of Salem, Ore., grew up in Orange County, graduated from 
Katella High School and later received both bachelor's and master's degree from 
UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy began studying Vietnamese in 1982, drawn to the language and by the 
culture's quiet grace and respect for traditional values -- a welcome contrast 
with the chaos and instability in his own life at the time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The following year, he started singing in Vietnamese when a Southern Baptist 
minister, who is Vietnamese, asked him to prepare a song for a Christmas 
service. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in traditional Vietnamese garb, Murphy typically sings somewhere every 
weekend, making occasional appearances at one of San Diego's three Vietnamese 
clubs. He travels out of the country twice a year for a total of about 2 1/2 
months, and every two to three months makes weekend trips to other American 
cities. His fee is usually several hundred dollars per appearance, although he 
often sings for free at Vietnamese benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Although his career is prospering -- he has not yet made an album, but will 
soon travel to Paris to tape a video of a live performance -- Murphy said he 
eventually would like to work as a diplomat or missionary. His country of 
choice is one that he has never been to -- Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
He says his embrace of Vietnamese culture is not a rejection of his own 
background. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not turning my back on American culture," said Murphy, who lives in the 
Linda Vista area, where many of the city's Hmong and Vietnamese refugees 
reside. "I'm not rejecting my family, my country, my race. 
</P>
<P>
"To some extent, what I'm doing is very American. It's so individualistic. But 
worship of individualism is, in part, the problem I had with American culture. 
. . . It's just that so much happened to me at one time in my life. You drive 
your car and nothing goes wrong for months, then all of a sudden, everything 
goes wrong. It's like that with life. And around 1978, everything just went 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
During that period, Murphy's parents divorced, and although he was in his 20s, 
he and three younger sisters were devastated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, he was a sociology major at UC San Diego, "studying some 
heavy-duty theory, all of these neo-Marxist, Freudian thinkers. They were 
writing a lot about the Holocaust. It was around that time that I became reborn 
as a Christian. Within two years of being reborn, I got involved with the 
Vietnamese." 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I was looking for a new kind of family," he said. "You know, like a 
traditional family in society, where authority is respected. Maybe where things 
were not so in question. All of this happened when I was 22, 23, and I was so 
idealistic. I thought I could learn anything, do anything, comprehend anything. 
I found out I couldn't." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said the evolution in his life is not as dramatic as it might appear. 
His father, a former editor at The Times, now works for a newspaper in Texas. 
But both his paternal grandfather and great-grandfather were Mormon 
missionaries. Murphy remembers going to his grandfather's house in Hawaii and 
feeling entranced by his Asian artifacts, the genesis of a curiosity that 
continued into high school, where he made his first Asian friends. They were 
outsiders and, to some extent, so was he. 
</P>
<P>
Among his Vietnamese fans, Murphy has been warmly embraced and, in the process, 
inspired introspection among his followers. 
</P>
<P>
Suzanne Pham, a Vietnamese refugee living in Garden Grove, said Murphy is 
important because some Vietnamese parents, in their haste to be accepted in 
this country, have forgotten their roots and the dignity of who they were. The 
fact that he wears traditional Vietnamese clothing and sings songs many 
refugees have not heard for years is, she said, especially pleasing. 
</P>
<P>
"Vietnamese is one of the hardest languages to learn, and he has learned it 
flawlessly," Pham said. "We are truly proud to have him represent us. He 
reminds the younger generation of the pride and wonder of Vietnamese music." 
</P>
<P>
Ruben Rumbaut, a professor of sociology at San Diego State University, said 
Murphy's mastery of Vietnamese is no idle accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not an Indo-European language," Rumbaut said. "It's not like Spanish, 
French or German. By and large, those languages contain similarities in grammar 
and syntax and even vocabulary. In Vietnamese, there are several different 
tones, so that the same word, spelled the same way, can have many different 
meanings depending on the way it's intoned." 
</P>
<P>
The warmth the Vietnamese display toward Murphy is genuine, Rumbaut said. 
</P>
<P>
"They're impressed not so much by the novelty of what he's done but by the 
underlying sincerity and genuineness expressed in the mastery of the language," 
Rumbaut said. "In the case of Vietnamese, that's a double achievement. I have 
been advised by Vietnamese friends that it's better to speak in English than it 
is to converse in Vietnamese in a rough or imperfect way. So what Rick did 
involved an element of risk. 
</P>
<P>
"He's gone beyond the point of speaking fluently enough and well enough that 
what the Vietnamese do in relation to him is reciprocate the considerable 
respect he's shown toward them by learning the language." 
</P>
<P>
Rumbaut said that Murphy, who was one his students when he taught at UCSD 
before 1985, has become totally immersed in Vietnamese culture. 
</P>
<P>
"He is one of those very rare people who get involved in research through 
active involvement and participation in the community he's studying," Rumbaut 
said. Murphy has "grown quite attached" to the Hmong children who live in his 
neighborhood, taking some to the zoo or Sea World on weekends, Rumbaut said. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy dates primarily, but not exclusively, Vietnamese women, and says he 
would one day like to marry a Vietnamese woman. But, pointing to the wrinkles 
in his rugged hands, he adds, "The Vietnamese say I have an unlucky love line." 
</P>
<P>
At his home in San Diego, which he shares with three other men -- two 
Vietnamese, one Chinese -- Murphy is surrounded by Vietnamese artifacts and 
mementoes. 
</P>
<P>
He says he values Vietnamese culture for its serenity, its grace, its respect 
for authority and reverence for family. With the Vietnamese, he said, he feels 
a sense of belonging. 
</P>
<P>
When he started to learn Vietnamese, "a tonal, musical language," he found it 
suited his mood and sense of discovery. But even in his wildest fantasies, 
Murphy never dreamed he would someday become a singer. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I'd get married pretty young and do something," he said. "But never 
this." 
</P>
<P>
His repertoire includes "The Star-Spangled Banner," three Chinese songs and 
more than 50 Vietnamese songs. The music ranges from opera to country to 
comedy, all in Vietnamese. On a recent Saturday night at the Caravelle, Murphy 
emceed, told jokes, sang and ran the light show. 
</P>
<P>
While many of the Vietnamese singers appear to be trying to be American ("very 
hip, very L.A.," as one singer put it), Murphy's look is unmistakably 
Vietnamese. They wore leather jackets and evening dresses, bedecked with 
jewelry and chains; he wore a Vietnamese gown. Ngoc Minh, like Murphy a regular 
at the Caravelle, sang, in English, "You Don't Have to Say You Love Me." Murphy 
sang "Hat Boi." 
</P>
<P>
Thuy Nguyen, a teacher in a San Diego preschool, said Murphy's decision to wear 
traditional dress and speak in Vietnamese gives refugees not only a feeling of 
pride but also a fondness for the good things left behind. 
</P>
<P>
As Murphy's peer group has grown increasingly Vietnamese, he has come to 
reflect many of the refugees' views. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate the stereotypes we've stuck them with," he said. "So much of what we 
see portrays South Vietnam as an evil, corrupt society and nothing more. If 
Vietnamese women are portrayed at all, it's as a madam or hooker. There's a 
general notion that Asians are a homogeneous people. Well, certainly, that's 
been shattered. There's a notion that Asians are a quiet and compliant people. 
The Vietnamese are, in fact, an intensely patriotic people. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a love of freedom and an understanding of freedom that many 
Americans have lost. Phrases like, 'Give me liberty or give me death' apply to 
these people directly." 
</P>

COUNTING HOMELESS A TOUGH JOB FOR CENSUS; 
</P>
<P>
MIGRANTS: ADVOCATES FOR THE HOMELESS SAY THE GOVERNMENT UNDERESTIMATES THE 
DIFFICULTY OF REACHING ILLEGAL ALIENS TO GET AN ACCURATE COUNT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The nationwide barriers to counting the homeless in the 1990 census are even 
more daunting in San Diego County, advocates for the homeless complain, putting 
the county in danger of a big financial loss. 
</P>
<P>
"The Census Bureau is coming from another locale, and they are simply not aware 
of the situation, especially in North County," said Andrea Mintz of the 
Regional Task Force on the Homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Counting migrant workers who live in camps among the canyons of North County 
represents different problems and requires different methods from counting the 
more typical homeless populations in urbanized areas, said Mintz, who chairs 
the task force's census committee. 
</P>
<P>
"When I found out about their methodology for counting the homeless, I was just 
kind of shocked," she said. "That's really not going to work." 
</P>
<P>
The task force issued a report in mid-February expressing concerns that the 
homeless population will be drastically undercounted in the survey this year 
because the Census Bureau does not understand the dynamics involved in counting 
the homeless in San Diego. Illegal immigrants, whether on urban streets or 
rural encampments, fear government officials and will avoid census workers, 
they say, while the large numbers of non-English speakers present other 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
At least in urban areas, the advocates say, most of the hangouts of the 
homeless are well known -- shelters, cheap hotels and parks. But there is no 
easy way to identify the tent communities that have sprung up in North County. 
The migrant workers live in hundreds of small encampments in the hills of 
Escondido, Carlsbad, Oceanside and other communities. 
</P>
<P>
"They're geographically scattered," said Connie Saldana of the North County 
Interfaith Center. "Although there are a few large camps, most live in smaller 
ones. There are so many people living in small camps of just two or three." 
</P>
<P>
The outcome could make a major dollar difference to the county. Dan Conway, a 
spokesman for the Census Bureau, said that for every homeless person not 
counted -- whether in the country legally or not -- the county loses $150 in 
federal funds annually for the next 10 years. This decade's census-taking of 
the homeless, the second ever, would be more extensive than in 1980, Conway 
said, with more interaction with community groups and agencies. 
</P>
<P>
But simply finding where the migrant workers sleep at night is a problem. Local 
homeless advocates, who are responsible for compiling a list of migrant camp 
locations, said they have been given too little time to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
"We're short on time with an enormous task to perform," Saldana said. "We know 
it's not going to be accurate because the odds are so much against it. The 
point is that we have to make an attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had a lot more people that could dedicate time, we could come up with a 
pretty accurate list," Saldana said. "It is very likely that we will miss a few 
camps. At this point, we're missing most of them." 
</P>
<P>
To date, Saldana has found 78 migrant camps in North County. 
</P>
<P>
"There's still lots out there that we haven't identified. For instance, we 
haven't identified any in Ramona, and I know there are some there," Saldana 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Millie Gordon, who helped in the 1980 census of North County migrant workers, 
called this year's one-night count a farce and "a waste of time and energy." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon and 14 others counted the North County homeless from April to mid-August 
in 1980 and found about 18,000 migrants. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's possible to get anywhere near a correct count with this new 
method," Gordon said. "The people who are spread out in the hooches and spider 
holes and aren't in a big group, who's going to count them? They're going to do 
it in a one-day period, that's not possible. There's not enough time and its 
not being done very realistically." 
</P>
<P>
Conway defended the bureau, saying that it contacted agencies that help the 
homeless in 1988 and again in 1989 to help them prepare for the upcoming count. 
But the agencies only started recently to compile their lists, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another barrier to counting the migrant population is the shortage of bilingual 
census takers. To help, the Census Bureau expects to hire bilingual noncitizens 
with legal residency in the United States. Previously, federal policy did not 
allow the bureau to hire noncitizens. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there is the task of getting undocumented people to cooperate with 
census takers. Although people will not be asked their residential status and 
all census information is confidential, undocumented persons tend to shy from 
interaction with government representatives for fear of deportation. 
</P>
<P>
"People that have a pattern of fleeing from strangers might not want to be 
counted, especially not having been educated ahead of time about the purpose of 
the count," Saldana said. 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau launched an advertising campaign to educate the migrant 
homeless on the census, particularly its confidentiality, with spots on 
Spanish-language radio stations and flyers in Spanish. While the campaign is a 
good idea, Mintz said the amount of resources being put into the effort is "not 
sufficient." 
</P>
<P>
Mintz also expressed concern over the count of the general homeless population. 
Most homeless people have no interest in the census and they make it a point to 
conceal where they spend the night, Mintz said. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't a priority for the homeless, they're not interested, and they're 
reluctant to talk to anyone that smells like government," Mintz said. "Chances 
are, they're not going to be too cooperative." 
</P>
<P>
But Conway said that the most important part of the homeless count will be the 
head count, and the questions being asked are few and simple. The five 
questions being asked the homeless concern the person's race, sex, age, marital 
status and whether they are of Hispanic origin. 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau plans to take its count of all the homeless on the night of 
March 20 through the early morning of March 21. Census takers will go to 
shelters, cheap hotels and street locations that have been identified by local 
homeless advocates as congregating places for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The count of those in migrant camps will take place from 6 a.m. to 8 a.m. on 
March 21. 
</P>
<P>
Families that are doubled up in single-family dwellings, people in shelters for 
abused women, and homeless people living in tents at commercial campgrounds 
will be counted as part of the regular census operations. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can find out where the homeless are, we have the resources to go to 
those locations in one night," Conway said. "It's not a matter of people 
power." 
</P>
<P>
But homeless advocates say enumerators won't find out where the homeless are 
because they don't want to be found. 
</P>
<P>
"If the homeless are in Balboa Park, they're in trees and bushes and hard to 
find, and you really don't want to go there anyway," Mintz said. She estimates 
that only 10% of the homeless population sleep in shelters while up to 90% may 
live on the street, "but you can't find them." 
</P>
<P>
Conway admitted that the count will be "conservative," but that they are doing 
what they can. Concerning Balboa Park, the Census Bureau plans a sweep of the 
area with enumerators going in groups up to four, armed with flashlights and 
highly visible vests identifying them as census takers. 
</P>
<P>
One of the points of contention between census officials and homeless advocates 
has been whether to count the homeless in soup kitchens. Homeless advocates 
think that counting people while they are gathered in one place would provide a 
more accurate count and would be easier to do. Census officials, however, are 
afraid of counting people twice -- where they eat and where they sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Conway said the bureau's policy is to count people where they sleep, and that 
policy applies to the homeless also. 
</P>
<P>
"The formal official position of the bureau is that we will not count people 
standing in line at soup kitchens," Conway said. But since many soup kitchens 
also provide shelter to a small number of their patrons, the bureau will count 
some people at the soup kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
"The plan is only to count those people that reside at the shelter," Conway 
said. 
</P>
<P>
To help in the count, the county board of supervisors recently decided to open 
the cold weather shelters to the homeless normally used only under winter 
conditions. By gathering many of the homeless in one place, they hope to not 
only get a more accurate count but also to get more extensive demographic 
information, said Nancy Allen, chief of staff at Supervisor John MacDonald's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
But the effect of not counting at soup kitchens could drastically hurt the 
results of the count, workers with the homeless contend. 
</P>
<P>
"It probably takes a third off of those out of the group that would have been 
counted," said Frank Landerville of the Regional Task Force, which is financed 
by San Diego city and county and the United Way. "I think the chances of being 
able to find those people after they leave the soup kitchens are very poor, 
especially those that are mentally alert enough to find secure and safe places 
to sleep, because if they are secure and safe, they aren't going to be found. 
</P>
<P>
"Homeless advocates and social workers couldn't find all the homeless in one 
evening. I just don't believe that census enumerators can find them when others 
cannot."

ARTS FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beeb Salzer makes many important points in his commentary ("Budget Blade Poised 
Again to Slice Arts Funding," March 4) defending city funds for the arts. I 
agree that artists and artwork help make San Diego a better place to live and 
work, with benefits far beyond mere bolstering of the city's image. 
</P>
<P>
But in urging arts leaders to lobby against any cuts, Professor Salzer 
contributes to the posturing that has polarized the budget shortfall facing the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, Professor Salzer lumps my moderate proposal for mild tax and fee 
increases and carefully planned budget cuts with the more Draconian series of 
cuts likely unless the City Council changes course. 
</P>
<P>
My package of nearly $8 million in budget cuts would reduce arts and 
promotional spending by $4.3 million. That would cause a direct cut to the arts 
of $3 million -- $2.2 million for future arts festivals and $800,000 from 
programs. But I also propose $41 million in new fees and taxes to keep whole 
many services, from police and fire to libraries and recreation programs. 
</P>
<P>
My proposal would provide about $5 million in continued funding for the arts -- 
not as much as I would like, but as much as the city can afford at this 
difficult time. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a council majority, in overruling my objections March 7, instructed 
City Manager John Lockwood to prepare a budget with no revenue increases, 
meaning the budget would have to be balanced solely by cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary reports from Mr. Lockwood indicate that under this scenario, few 
programs would escape the ax. Police service would be trimmed back from current 
levels. Social services funding would be eliminated from the general fund. 
Mission Bay improvements would be deferred. All city recreation centers and 
pools would be closed. Library hours would be drastically reduced, and arts and 
promotional funding would drop by $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
In such an event, it is unlikely there would be much support for any arts 
funding at all, and certainly not the $5 million I would have the city provide. 
</P>
<P>
How can Professor Salzer direct equal ire at my proposal and this course the 
council has taken? 
</P>
<P>
It is time for those now taking extreme approaches to lower the volume. 
</P>
<P>
Those who now say "No cuts" should say what cuts they can live with. And those 
who say "No taxes" should step forward and say where they would produce the 
revenue needed to keep our streets safe, our libraries and parks open and our 
streets and roads from slowly crumbling.

'COMING OUT' A RISK THAT'S WORTH TAKING; 
</P>
<P>
HOMOSEXUALITY: GAYS AND LESBIANS AREN'T THE ONLY ONES WHO FEAR OSTRACISM FROM 
SOCIETY. THEIR PARENTS DO, TOO. 
</P>

<P>
In the next few weeks, the San Diego City Council will consider a "human 
dignity ordinance" to prohibit discrimination against gays and lesbians in 
housing and employment. If the council acts positively, as so many of us hope 
it will, some of our daughters and sons will breathe a small sigh of relief. 
</P>
<P>
But is that all there is? What about the rest of society? 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, I tiptoed out of the closet with our gay son. Twenty years of 
subsequent experience as the parent of a gay child have whitened my hair and 
strengthened my purpose. 
</P>
<P>
A psychiatrist friend said recently that " 'coming out' is a lifetime job . . . 
" I can attest to that. It is an ongoing process for all of us -- gays and 
lesbians, their parents and their friends. 
</P>
<P>
I went public five years ago with an article that was published in a national 
magazine. Sharing this way with so many strangers, however, did not mean that 
acceptance was waiting in the wings, that family and friends were lining up to 
pat me on the head and say, "We understand." 
</P>
<P>
And it surely did not mean that all of my conflicts were resolved. The 
confusing emotions of anger and grief, denial and disappointment, rejection and 
mourning continued their assault for a long time before they gave way to peace 
and comfort. But sharing did allow me to take an additional step away from the 
closet. 
</P>
<P>
Not every parent needs to write an article to face their child's truth; each of 
us must handle that in her or his own way. But each does need to turn to others 
for support. Coping alone in privacy might save pride, but it does not build 
family happiness or emotional well-being. "Coming out" is not easy; it is a 
gamble, a risk we must take. It can pay off; trust me, I know. I found support 
out there. 
</P>
<P>
At the outset, I was reluctant to talk about Jeff to family and friends. Would 
they reject both of us? When I finally dared speak out, I found, to my 
surprise, a number of open arms and willing listeners. Most seemed to have been 
waiting for us to inform them. 
</P>
<P>
Good friends berated us for not allowing them early on to share our grief, our 
disappointment and our recovery. Did we not trust their affection for us? Had 
we no confidence in their understanding? How could we keep such a matter to 
ourselves when we shared so many confidences? Several revealed that they, too, 
had gay children. Such intimacy and sharing eased our pain and helped erase our 
fears. 
</P>
<P>
Most relatives were neither surprised nor shocked. I was certain that when my 
mother-in-law heard about Jeff's homosexuality, it would affirm her own worst 
fears (about me): what a terrible mother her son had chosen for his children. 
One day we were both rather mellow, feeling kindly to one another. I told her 
about Jeff. Her comment was a shrug that clearly conveyed, "That's life!" I am 
sure she was disappointed, but Jeff was a member of the family and she would 
not amputate him. 
</P>
<P>
Other relatives continued to care about our son, loving him and, as before, 
including him within the family circle. Even on the day he appeared at a family 
party with freshly peroxided hair and outrageous clothing, he was embraced and 
warmly welcomed (although I was infuriated by his demeanor). He never needed to 
be flamboyant again; he had found acceptance and was no longer compelled to 
challenge his family. 
</P>
<P>
One relative, however, was different from the rest. She responded with silence. 
I had expected support from her; she had been my friend, my confidante during 
my growing up. I confronted her discomfort; she said she could not "handle it." 
She was a disappointment, but there was no time for tears over one lost 
friendship. In our family she is alone, even today, in her bigotry. 
</P>
<P>
As the years roll by, I become more and more comfortable in the light outside 
the closet. Now, when new friends ask about our children and wonder if our son 
is married, I find it increasingly easy to answer: "No. You see, he is gay." 
Responses usually are, "How wonderful that you say it with such ease. . . . Was 
it difficult to get to this place?" or "Thank you for sharing a personal 
confidence." One neighbor wept; she was deeply moved. 
</P>
<P>
No one has turned away in disdain. Some folks are unable to comment; 
occasionally, another will speak up when silence would be better. I recall the 
woman who rose at a meeting and asked, "Are you still able to tell your son 
that you love him?" 
</P>
<P>
Sharing the fact of Jeff's homosexuality with his sister was difficult for all 
of us. Judi was 19 at the time and newly married. She and Jeff, only 18 months 
apart, were close. They trusted one another. Her copious tears at the telling 
came from shock, disappointment and compassion. She and Jeff have remained warm 
friends. When a neighbor recently asked Judi if she allowed Jeff to play with 
her young son, his nephew, she was furious and prepared to do battle. Our 
children travel in different social circles, but they are integral parts of the 
family circle. 
</P>
<P>
Acquaintances are often more difficult to confront and bear than friends and 
family. A closet bigot is hard to spot in the warm glow of the neighborhood 
cocktail party. I have been burned, nevertheless, and I come away with more 
confidence each time. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, at such a gathering, a relative stranger said, "I never go to San 
Francisco; there are too many of them up there." I challenged her directly, 
even as I do those who dare tell anti-gay jokes. I identified myself as the 
parent of a gay son, and I grabbed the opportunity to educate her to the myths 
and misconceptions surrounding homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
Support and understanding often come from the least expected sources. After the 
party, my hostess called to apologize for her rude guest and to express her 
personal concern for me. We had a long talk about people and homosexuality. The 
evening was not lost. 
</P>
<P>
We parents of gays and lesbians should speak up, openly and confidently; if we 
hesitate, the listener hesitates; if we are doubtful, we enforce the listener's 
doubts. If, however, we believe that our gay children deserve our support, then 
we can, by our personal attitudes, evoke the support of others. 
</P>
<P>
Gay people are often fearful of both rejection and ostracism. We parents are, 
too. We worry that the "good-parent" stamp of approval will be denied us when 
loved ones discover that our child is gay. 
</P>
<P>
I believe with all my heart that most of our parents, siblings and friends love 
us too much to withhold their support. Besides, folks generally "know" by the 
time we "confess"; they merely wait for us to prove that we trust them, by 
confiding. As one friend explained, "Oh, I knew that Jeff was gay; I wondered 
if you did!"

ELDERLY WARNED OF ROBBERS POSING AS DWP WORKERS

<P>
Sheriff's deputies are warning South Bay residents to be on the lookout for two 
men who have posed as Los Angeles city employees to enter homes and steal money 
from elderly residents. 
</P>
<P>
The two men, who reportedly wear hard hats and drive a brown, late-model van, 
have gained the confidence of their victims by posing as employees of the Los 
Angeles Department of Water and Power and offering a cash rebate of about $20, 
Sheriff's Deputy Stacy Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
Both suspects are described as Latino. One is about 5-feet-4, the other is 
about 6-feet tall and husky, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
She said that once the men have offered the cash rebate, they ask to check the 
water pressure in the house. Once inside, Lee said, the men ask victims if they 
can provide change for a $100 bill. The two men then snatch all of the victim's 
money and flee in the van, she said. Lee could not say how much money the men 
have taken. 
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of February, the men have used the same scheme twice in 
Lawndale and once each in Lennox and Pasadena, Lee said. None of the victims 
were physically harmed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Jensen, a spokeswoman for the Department of Water and Power, said the 
utility only provides services to residents within the city of Los Angeles. She 
said all employees wear uniforms and carry a photo identification card. 
</P>
<P>
"(Residents) shouldn't let people into the house if they can't identify 
themselves with proper ID," she said. Lee agreed, saying residents who suspect 
they are the target of such a scheme should call the police and refuse to allow 
the men to enter. HUGO MARTIN

Census workers in the South Bay are gearing up for their part in a 12-hour 
nationwide search for the homeless Tuesday night that will take them to 
shelters, street corners and abandoned buildings. 
</P>
<P>
But there is widespread concern among homeless advocates about whether the 
herculean head count can succeed. They say the homeless are often loners who 
distrust the government and whose makeshift living quarters are difficult to 
find. Some are even advocating a boycott of the census. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay regional census manager Carl Bailey, a former Marine who likens his 
job to a military field operation, admits that the all-night count will be 
difficult, but he says not pursuing it wholeheartedly would be tantamount to 
surrender. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems unfortunate to me that people who profess to serve and take care of 
this disenfranchised people are attempting to deny them the ability to be 
counted as human beings," Bailey grumbled. "I want to count people." 
</P>
<P>
Enumerators, as the census counters are known, will hit the streets Tuesday 
night with clipboards, flashlights and strict instructions to keep all the 
information they gather confidential. 
</P>
<P>
The event has been dubbed "S Night" -- the "S" stands for streets and shelters 
-- and is considered the government's most extensive effort ever to document a 
national homeless population that is estimated to be somewhere between 250,000 
and 3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing special white vests with CENSUS TAKER emblazoned on the back, 
enumerators are scheduled to visit emergency shelters, all-night theaters and 
cut-rate hotels throughout the United States from 6 p.m. to midnight. 
</P>
<P>
After a two-hour break, they will walk the streets from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. 
Wednesday counting anyone they find. When the enumerators come upon someone who 
is asleep or incoherent, they will estimate their age, sex and race and move 
on. From 4 a.m. to 8 a.m. they will stand in front of abandoned buildings and 
interview anyone who comes out. 
</P>
<P>
Though census officials maintain that most social service agencies have 
cooperated with them, there are pockets of resistance as Tuesday's count nears. 
</P>
<P>
Mitch Snyder, perhaps the nation's best-known homeless advocate, burned census 
information forms last month in Washington, D.C., and urged homeless people 
across the nation to boycott the decennial head count. He argued that the 
process is guaranteed to vastly undercount the homeless and play into the hands 
of politicians seeking to minimize the problem. 
</P>
<P>
David Christiansen, director of the Harbor Interfaith Shelter in San Pedro, 
says he will not lift a hand for the census workers when they stop by his 
shelter because he does not want to add legitimacy to the count. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a classic example of the road to hell being paved with good intentions," 
said Christiansen, who is also director of the Greater Los Angeles Homeless 
Steering Committee. "The only way they can possibly come up with some sensible 
approximation is to have some method of extrapolation, to admit that they only 
hit 10% of the problem on March 20." 
</P>
<P>
The fear among even those homeless advocates who are cooperating with census 
workers is that whatever figure the census yields will become the basis for 
government aid to charities and social service organizations through the year 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
"It is going to be a massive undercount, and for the next 10 years politicians 
and administrators will be pointing to it as 'The Statistic,' when in fact, it 
is flawed from the outset," said John Suggs, executive director of the Los 
Angeles Countywide Homeless Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Amid all the skepticism, there are glimmers of hope. 
</P>
<P>
One homeless man said he will participate to show society that homelessness is 
a bigger problem than many believe. 
</P>
<P>
"It might open everyone's eyes," said Frank Rivera, 51, who has lived in 
Alondra Park in Torrance since August. "There's a lot more people out here than 
people think." 
</P>
<P>
Some advocates for the homeless have had trouble convincing the homeless that 
being counted may mean more services and more awareness of their plight. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the homeless people are taking this very seriously. They are 
sort of laughing about it, saying, 'You want to count us? Ha, ha, ha,' " said 
the Rev. Gary Erb, director of Christian Outreach Appeal in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to explain what the alleged principle of the census is," said 
Nelda Trent, a volunteer at the House of Yahweh in Lawndale. "Their first 
question is, 'What's in it for me?' " 
</P>
<P>
Trent says that even as she attempts to convince the homeless that 
participation is key, doubts linger in her own mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know philosophically whether they should be counted," she said. "They 
are not considered part of the Establishment any other time. My personal 
concern is that if we turn up a paltry amount, the number will be used against 
them." 
</P>
<P>
To gear up for the intensive search, census workers have been contacting social 
service agencies and homeless advocates for months, mapping out places where 
the homeless are known to congregate. 
</P>
<P>
In Gardena, census workers will stop by the Alondra Park Methodist Church. In 
Torrance, they will hit the alley behind Ralph's Market in the Del Amo Fashion 
Center. In Inglewood, it will be the National Guard Armory. 
</P>
<P>
There will be many stops in between. 
</P>
<P>
"We plan to go to them," explained Brenda August, the Census Bureau's director 
of homeless outreach for California. "We know we won't count them all, but 
we'll count many of them." 
</P>
<P>
The safety of the enumerators is a big concern among census officials, who have 
told workers to keep walking if they witness any drug sales and to call a 
supervisor if any confrontation develops. Homeless people themselves were 
originally going to join enumerators on the job, but as of last week none in 
the South Bay had passed the required employment test. 
</P>
<P>
Area homeless advocates plan to gather homeless people Tuesday night into eight 
"clustering sites" in six South Bay cities for easy counting. Flyers announcing 
those plans have been distributed to homeless hangouts throughout the area; 
voter registration tables also will be set up. 
</P>
<P>
But even those plans have tactical problems. 
</P>
<P>
The homeless who arrive for counting will have to move on when midnight hits 
because most of the sites close at that time and do not have overnight 
accommodations. Homeless advocates wonder whether civic duty is enough to make 
people spend hours gathered in a location that cannot offer them a bed when the 
clock strikes midnight. 
</P>
<P>
There's also concern among homeless advocates in Torrance, Redondo Beach and 
Lawndale that Inglewood will receive credit for all the homeless that spend the 
evening in the Inglewood-based Armory, a cold-weather site for the homeless 
that is scheduled to be opened Tuesday night. If this occurs, the homeless 
providers fear, Inglewood would receive more than its fair share of funding for 
homeless programs. 
</P>
<P>
Amanda Aldrich, head of the census team for the South Bay Homeless Coalition, 
has been working for four months to organize the count of the South Bay's 
homeless. But she says the task seems overwhelming at times, and the coalition 
plans to lodge a formal protest of whatever number the Census Bureau comes up 
with. 
</P>
<P>
"The number we're going to get is going to be minuscule compared to the total 
homeless population," she said last week. "The numbers will be ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
But she and others in the coalition trudge on because they do not want to miss 
a chance to prove to area municipalities that there is a homeless problem. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a strong denial of the homeless in the South Bay," Aldrich said. "If 
we don't count homeless, city officials will continue to say they don't have 
homeless in their cities. That's why we jumped into this. I don't know how many 
people we're going to get, but it's better than nothing."

DEMOCRATS HOPE TO GAIN FROM ROHRABACHER'S DRILLING STAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE HATCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two days after the tanker American Trader began hemorrhaging off Huntington 
Beach, U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher appeared at the oil spill scene and said the 
accident underscored the need for more offshore oil drilling in California. 
</P>
<P>
"I watched it on TV," said Republican Bob Ryan, a member of the Rancho Palos 
Verdes City Council. "I thought, 'No, Dana, stay out of this, this is not the 
time to discuss that issue.' " 
</P>
<P>
Democrats working to dislodge Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) from his 42nd 
Congressional District seat hope Ryan's fears were well-founded. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a district in which Republicans hold a decisive 53% share of 
registered voters, Democrats are trying to turn public concern about oil spills 
-- and Rohrabacher's advocacy of offshore drilling -- to their advantage. 
</P>
<P>
An early sign of that strategy is expected Wednesday, when Guy Kimbrough, one 
of three Democrats running for Rohrabacher's seat, plans to draw attention to 
the oil issue by announcing his candidacy on Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a wedge issue," said Steve Beale, a Democratic organizer in Torrance. 
"It's the kind of issue that can set Republicans against Republicans." 
</P>
<P>
GOP strategists say the Democrats are clutching at straws. Said Steve Johnson, 
director of the Los Angeles County GOP: "When the Democrats park their cars and 
walk, maybe they'll have an issue." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher, a former Reagan speech writer elected to Congress in 1988, does 
not support offshore drilling across the board. He says he opposes sinking new 
wells within sight of shore in areas that have not yet had any drilling, unless 
the affected coastal communities support it. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, however, he is working on a bill that would require the federal 
government to share royalties from new offshore oil production with the 
nation's coastal cities affected by the drilling. 
</P>
<P>
He clearly hopes that such a measure would soften opposition to drilling in his 
largely coastal district, which snakes south from Torrance and the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula all the way to Huntington Beach. So far the local response has been 
hostile, however. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher argues that extracting crude with oil platforms and piping it 
ashore is sounder strategically and safer environmentally than receiving it 
from distant states or foreign countries by ship. 
</P>
<P>
He points to the safety record of oil platforms in his district off Long Beach, 
Seal Beach and Huntington Beach. "A few gallons here, a few gallons there, 
(but) there has never been a spill," he said in an interview Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
And Rohrabacher, who does not have a primary opponent, says he doubts that his 
position will hurt him in the Nov. 6 general election. 
</P>
<P>
"It's totally defensible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats say Rohrabacher's drilling advocacy could hurt him more than he 
thinks, particularly in light of events that might give Californians reason to 
fear oil spills. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent, of course, was last month's 394,000-gallon American Trader 
spill, which killed more than 700 birds and closed 20 miles of Orange County 
beaches, many of them for more than a month. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats also point to the Bush Administration's consideration of a plan to 
sell federal drilling leases in three offshore areas believed to be rich in oil 
and gas: Lease Sale 95 off the Southern California coast, Lease Sale 91 off 
Northern California and Lease Sale 116 off Southwest Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Lease Sale 95 would encompass 6.7 million acres of ocean bottom stretching from 
the Mexican border to the northern border of San Luis Obispo County. Lease Sale 
91 would cover 1.1 million acres off Mendocino and Humboldt counties. 
</P>
<P>
In his latest campaign mailer, Democrat challenger Kimbrough juxtaposed his own 
public statements in opposition to Lease Sale 95 with the pro-drilling comments 
Rohrabacher made to reporters last month at Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrough, a political science instructor, thinks Rohrabacher's support for oil 
drilling can be tied to his anti-abortion activism as proof that the 
congressman, formerly a Libertarian, is out of step with the GOP rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
The other Democrats in the race agree. Like Kimbrough, Jim Cavuoto, the owner 
of a small publishing business in Torrance, and Bryan Stevens, former president 
of the California Teachers Assn., oppose offshore drilling and government 
prohibitions on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"Rohrabacher's views don't fit in with those of the average Republican voter 
sitting at home," Cavuoto said. "If Republicans can see the clear alternative, 
and that's our challenge, I believe that in this race, in this district and in 
this year, many Republican voters will vote for a Democrat." 
</P>
<P>
Republican politicians have a range of opinions on whether Cavuoto's analysis 
is correct. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Palos Verdes City Councilman John McTaggart said that on the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula, Republicans are extremely concerned about Rohrabacher's stand 
on oil drilling. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very important issue. Here, we have conservative people who are 
environmentally minded," McTaggart said. "I've got to tell you, I think (GOP 
strategists) are wrong if they don't think this is an issue." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Walker, a Torrance City Council member, disagrees: "Republicans aren't 
going to vote for a Democrat because of any single issue."

TEMPLE ATTENDANCE DROPS AS PEOPLE DODGE SPRAYING 
</P>

Malathion spraying in the East Valley on the Jewish Sabbath cut attendance at 
Friday night services by as much as half and forced synagogues to shorten 
services so members could return home before the application began, rabbis said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Just a trickle showed up," said Cantor Walter Flexo of the Valley Beth Israel 
in Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Despite rabbis' pleas Friday to postpone the malathion application, the 
Department of Food and Agriculture went ahead with spraying, but started it an 
hour later. 
</P>
<P>
"It was decided it would not be detrimental to the program to extend it another 
hour to give people a chance to get off the streets," said Fred Meyer, deputy 
director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Medfly Project. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Joel Wachs, who represents the area, joined the rabbis at a Friday 
news conference in North Hollywood. Wachs said the refusal to cancel the 
spraying was particularly insensitive because religious tradition calls on Jews 
to walk to services. 
</P>
<P>
"Thus, every Friday, thousands of men, women and children throughout the area 
will be faced with the choice of either exposing themselves to direct malathion 
spraying or being unable to practice their religion," Wachs said. 
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Natalie Bosecker from the Department of Food and Agriculture said 
spraying will begin at 10 p.m. whenever it is scheduled for Fridays. The Jewish 
Sabbath begins at sunset on Fridays and ends at sundown Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbis fear Friday sprayings will cause a replay of what happened this weekend. 
About 250,000 Jews live in the San Fernando Valley, according to the Jewish 
Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles. Friday's spraying covered a 
47-square-mile area of Studio City, Sylmar, Panorama City, North Hollywood and 
Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
At the Valley Beth Israel, only about 40 of the usual 85 worshipers showed up 
for the service, which the rabbi changed to reflect how "disgraceful" he 
thought the spraying was, Flexo said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were rushing through the service with the idea in mind of not relaxing and 
enjoying a religious service -- but to get home quick," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Flexo said the attendance at Saturday morning's service also was low, which is 
unusual because the synagogue's members, most of whom are elderly, usually come 
out in good weather. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Meier Schimmel of Congregation Beth Meier in Studio City called the low 
attendance "heartbreaking." 
</P>
<P>
No children attended, he said, and the worshipers were impatient to get home. 
"There was tension." 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Moshe Rothblum of Adat Ari El in North Hollywood called the later start 
for the spraying an improvement but said, "The only problem is there are times 
when services don't end that early." 
</P>
<P>
The decision to push back Friday's malathion application by one hour has 
sparked a campaign by one anti-spraying activist to bring religious leaders 
into the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"You start getting religious people involved, and suddenly, things get a little 
more powerful," said Susan Spector, a founder of Mothers and Others Opposed to 
Malathion Spraying in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"They have clout. People respect their opinions," Spector said. "The clergy 
generally are supposed to look out and take care of those who don't have, the 
homeless and the poor. I would like the clergy and the rabbis to stand side by 
side, saying 'Stop this.' Gov. George Deukmejian is not listening to anyone 
else, maybe he'll listen to God's people." 
</P>
<P>
Spector called the 10 p.m. Friday sprayings a way for the government to appease 
the public and discourage phone calls protesting the malathion program.

REFLECTIONS: 'PATIENCE IS CRITICAL, BECAUSE YOU DON'T GO FROM THE BAEMENT TO

San Diego State women's basketball coach Beth Burns recently completed her 
first season as head coach with the Aztecs. But just a few years ago, when the 
31-year-old from Chatham, N.J., competed in college, women's sports were almost 
an afterthought. She was a four-year starting forward for Ohio Wesleyan 
basketball team who was named the most outstanding female athlete. Burns 
participated when women athletes still competed in the Assn. of Intercollegiate 
Athletics for Women and full athletic scholarships were virtually unheard of. 
Working her way through school while playing basketball and attending class 
full time, she earned her bachelor's degree in physical and health education in 
1979 and a master's in physical education and psychology in 1981 from Ohio 
State, while she was an assistant coach there. Burns went on to become an 
assistant coach at University of Colorado and North Carolina State before 
coming to SDSU. Burns spoke with Times staff writer Terry Rather in her SDSU 
office and was photographed by Vince Compagnone. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1975 there were just the rumblings, the beginnings of scholarships for 
women. I'd like to think I'm not that old at 31, but it's incredible and 
rewarding to me to see the strides we have made in terms of full scholarships 
for women. At the time I went to college, I got up, went to school, went to 
practice and worked in the kitchen. And I took out loans to go to college. So I 
do appreciate the value of an education. 
</P>
<P>
And I've always been interested in athletics. I grew up in a family that was 
always athletic. I was surrounded by sports as far as I remember. There's 
pictures of dad and me with a whiffle ball when I was 4 years old. If there was 
a tree, I'd climb it. If there was a ball, I'd throw it. Growing up, athletics 
was everything. We played kickball, soccer, field hockey, volleyball, anything 
that was there we did. 
</P>
<P>
My parents really inspired me. My dad, who still lives in Chatham, has been 
from the start very supportive, open-minded and encouraging for my sister and 
me. When they wouldn't let us play Little League, he'd get out there and start 
a league and help us get involved. He never said, only girls can do that, or 
only boys can do that. He said, you can do whatever you want to do. My mother 
was a source of strength for me. She died when I was 18, which really affected 
me. If anyone was to ask me what was the most devastating thing that ever 
happened in my life, that would be it. Both of my parents encouraged me to be 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
When I went to grade school, we didn't have any organized teams for girls, so I 
didn't really play anything competitively until high school. We just played. 
There really was nothing organized until they started a local fast-pitch 
softball league. 
</P>
<P>
When I started playing organized basketball in high school, it was just 
beginning for girls at my high school. They had just started giving you someone 
who was a coach and not someone who just sat on the side of the gym and kept it 
open from 3 to 4 p.m. and on game day give you a penny and you'd play. This was 
frustrating. I didn't have any coaching. I wanted to be good, I wanted to learn 
and I wanted my team to be good because I was so competitive. We'd practice for 
a half-hour and no one knew what they were doing. We were kind of like the "Bad 
News Bears." We lived through those losing seasons, but I think, if anything, 
it made me want to be a coach. 
</P>
<P>
When I first got to college, I wanted to be a high school coach. But as soon as 
I got there, I wanted to be a college coach. I think it was because I didn't 
have people who were really coaches until the fast-pitch softball league. A 
couple of the firemen started up a fast-pitch softball team and they were real 
coaches. They yelled at us and they made us do what we had to do. 
</P>
<P>
If you zigged instead of zagged, they told you about it. It was never, "It's OK 
because you're girls and it doesn't matter." I loved it, there was someone who 
was coaching us, pushing us. You would have thought we were playing for a 
national championship. 
</P>
<P>
I found that the biggest transition from player to coach was you're used to 
doing things physically. When you see a problem, you go out and do something 
about it, you go out and play. The hardest thing is to stop doing it with your 
body and start with your brain. When I first got out of college, I needed a 
seat belt on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
I'm thrilled with this opportunity at SDSU. I think it will take hard work and 
the bricks are already starting to be laid. Patience is critical, because you 
don't go from the basement to the penthouse without climbing up a whole lot of 
stairs. I want to build a program here. I don't want to have a good team 
1990-91. I want to have a good program for the rest of the time I'm here.

MAN WORKING UNDER CAR INJURED IN HIT-AND-RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A suspected drunk driver ended up doing the wrong thing at the wrong time 
Saturday morning when he slammed into a parked car, injuring a man working 
underneath it, then drove away as a Hawthorne police detective was driving 
past. 
</P>
<P>
The detective, who witnessed the incident at about 9:30 a.m., gave chase as the 
suspect drove away from the scene on Crenshaw Boulevard just south of Manhattan 
Beach Boulevard. 
</P>

Two Gardena police units helped stop the 1976 Pontiac Ventura several blocks 
away, Gardena Sgt. Tom Monson said. 
</P>
<P>
Gardena police arrested the driver, Christopher Russell, 24, of Redondo Beach, 
and booked him on suspicion of felony drunk driving and felony hit-and-run, 
Monson said. 
</P>
<P>
The injured man could not be identified, Monson said, because a police report 
that would provide that information had not yet been filed. Monson said the man 
was taken to Harbor General Hospital, where he was listed in satisfactory 
condition.

DEFT NEW LEADER PAVES THE WAY FOR TOLL ROADS; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: WILLIAM C. (WILD BILL) WOOLLETT JR. IS RIDING HERD OVER THE 
FIRST EFFORT TO BRING MAJOR USER-FEE HIGHWAYS TO CALIFORNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, TIMES URBAN AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His friends call him Wild Bill. Some weekends he can be found roaming rustic 
Bommer Canyon in Irvine, or sailing a 16-foot catamaran off the coast, or river 
rafting in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
But at age 61, William C. Woollett Jr. says he has met his biggest challenge: 
serving as executive director of Orange County's Transportation Corridor 
Agencies, which plan to build a 70-mile, $2-billion network of three tollways 
by mid-decade. 
</P>
<P>
"I like this job because it involves something that's never been done before," 
Woollett said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Woollett presides over the first effort to bring major, publicly owned 
user-fee highways to California. 
</P>
<P>
Although Woollett may not be well known outside of Irvine, where he served for 
17 years as the city's first city manager, he is one of Orange County's 
highest-paid public officials, receiving $118,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
It's a pressure-filled job. John Meyer, Woollett's predecessor, quit last 
summer, citing job burnout. Developers and politicians clamor to have the roads 
built "yesterday"; environmentalists threaten to file lawsuits at every turn, 
and engineers spend the agencies' money for design work faster than developer 
fees can pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
Woollett has been at the tollway post less than five months, but agency board 
members, transportation officials and developers already give him high marks 
for boosting morale and gaining control of what was an understaffed, unfocused 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been tremendously impressed by him," said San Juan Capistrano Mayor 
Gary L. Hausdorfer, who chairs the Foothill-Eastern Transportation Corridor 
Agency board. "He is a very quiet and competent leader. He's a good organizer. 
He is a quick learner who very quickly grasps very complicated transportation 
issues." 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Hausdorfer said, Woollett hired a financial expert -- Wallace D. 
Kreutzen -- as a deputy director to bring board members much better cost- and 
cash-flow analyses than they had before. Also, Woollett has been giving board 
members written, weekly updates on financial, environmental and construction 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, final design contracts have been signed for portions of the 
tollways, with construction expected to begin later this year or in early 1991. 
</P>
<P>
But Woollett still faces major hurdles, including: 
</P>
<P>
Foothill-area opposition to federal legislation that would permit Orange 
County's tollways to pass through parkland, and an almost-certain environmental 
lawsuit aimed at blocking the planned San Joaquin Hills tollway bridge across 
Laguna Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing criticism from some public officials and developers who complain 
that the San Joaquin Hills tollway project is already two years behind 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Pending final tollway financing plans, with tollway officials still negotiating 
developer fees and offsetting credits for donated rights of way and grading. 
</P>
<P>
Even Hausdorfer has acknowledged that tollway financing will be "very tight" 
and critically dependent, perhaps, on projections that motorists will be 
willing to pay tolls higher than the $2 to $3 maximums previously anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to be easy," Hausdorfer said. "But I'm confident the roads will 
be built." 
</P>
<P>
Said Woollett: "I didn't come here to fail." 
</P>
<P>
Seeking to head off potential financial problems, Woollett has discussed with 
some officials the possibility of borrowing money from the state or other local 
transportation agencies, who would be repaid when tolls are collected. 
</P>
<P>
Tollway employees say Woollett is best at bringing people of opposing views 
together and then quickly deciding what needs to be done. 
</P>
<P>
But there are some people who remain unconvinced. 
</P>
<P>
When the Tustin Hills Homeowners Assn. recently alleged that tollway officials 
were white-washing projected tollway noise levels in their community, Woollett 
promised to respond with the best scientific data available, even if it hurts 
his cause. 
</P>
<P>
Said Jeffrey Katz, president of the homeowners' group: "We'll see. He listens 
to us, but it's clear that he knows who he works for. . . . He wants to get 
the" tollways "done." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, developers such as the Mission Viejo Co., which had griped last year 
that the tollways were taking too long to build, have been mostly quiet after a 
series of private briefings begun by Woollett's predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
During such sessions, Woollett has developed a reputation for saying exactly 
what's on his mind, even to the influential Irvine Co., one of the agency's 
staunchest defenders and a major donor of rights of way. 
</P>
<P>
"I was attending a meeting with him and several others recently, when we got 
into an argument and he turned to me and said simply, 'Hugh, you're full of 
crap,' " said Irvine Co. transportation planner Hugh Fitzpatrick. 
</P>
<P>
Still, critics point out that the tollway agency has spent about $54 million 
since its inception in 1986, without any concrete poured. Much of the money, 
though, has gone for environmental and route alignment studies, legal advice 
and legislative lobbying in Sacramento, and costly design contracts. 
</P>
<P>
And while Woollett is under pressure in some quarters to quickly appoint a 
respected transportation engineering expert to an unfilled, second deputy's 
position on his staff, he has bided his time, saying it's not easy to attract 
the best people at a salary the agency can afford. 
</P>
<P>
Woollett, the father of a son, 29, and a daughter, 27, reads historical novels 
and admits to a certain fascination both with futurism and management 
expertise. 
</P>
<P>
No stranger to issues such as growth control and land-use planning, Woollett 
once worked privately on the development of Hollister Ranch north of Santa 
Barbara, which is not unlike the Irvine Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
While he was Irvine's city manager, his office discovered an error by the 
city's Community Development Department that had led to too many development 
permits being issued for the tightly controlled Irvine Business Complex. 
</P>
<P>
And although urban planners have criticized Irvine's reliance on mostly 
pro-automobile, anti-pedestrian development, Woollett has a jaundiced view of 
the car. 
</P>
<P>
"During World War II, we were forced to look at alternatives," Woollett said. 
"But now it just isn't as high a priority for us -- at least not yet. 
</P>
<P>
"Front porches allowed people to see what was going on around them, to 
communicate face to face with their neighbors and children playing in the 
neighborhood. Now nobody builds them anymore. We've lost that source of 
communication. Similarly, cars have cut us off from each other. We're wrapped 
in steel, chrome and glass." 
</P>
<P>
But in a county where some government officials drive Cadillacs, Mercedeses and 
BMWs, Woollett wheels around town in a 1969 El Camino that was so much in need 
of a face lift that his former Irvine co-workers sprang for a bright red, 
$2,000 paint job. 
</P>
<P>
"He's basically a cowboy at heart," said Paul Brady Jr., who succeeded Woollett 
as Irvine's city manager. "The El Camino fits right in."

OAKLAND -- NAME SUITS THE RAIDERS; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: CITY AND TEAM REGAIN THAT FAMILIAR RING WHEN AL DAVIS RETURNS 
CLUB TO ITS ROOTS AND A LEGION OF LOYAL FANS.

<P>
The day before the Los Angeles (nee Oakland) Raiders were to play a crucial 
game against Denver two years ago, a group of about 100 black-and-silver clad 
fans were at Oakland Airport for the hour flight south. 
</P>
<P>
"We are," said one of them, "the real Raider fans." 
</P>
<P>
For the eight years the Raiders have played at the Los Angeles Coliseum, much 
of the country has shared that sentiment. It still slips off the tongue: "the 
Oakland . . . er, Los Angeles . . . Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
When Al Davis announced Monday that he was moving his team back north, he 
insisted he had nothing against the Los Angeles fans, only against the folks 
who run the Los Angeles Coliseum, who he claims reneged on promises to improve 
the facility. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles has always been blase unless you're the Dodgers or the Lakers, 
perennial winners who have made it a habit to accumulate superstars. 
</P>
<P>
Stars are big in Tinseltown: 
</P>
<P>
Hey, let's go see Jerry-Elgin-Wilt-Kareem-Magic or 
Sandy-Don-Maury-Fernando-Orel-Kirk. And watch Pat coach and Tommy manage. We 
can even get to see Jack Nicholson at courtside. 
</P>
<P>
Hockey? What's that? The Kings just got Wayne Gretzky? Let's go to a hockey 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what I like about this place," says a transplanted New Yorker with a 
Los Angeles attitude. "When you go to a game, you get to see celebrities. In 
New York, the celebrities are inconspicuous." 
</P>
<P>
That was the Los Angeles Raiders -- inconspicuous, a team on the decline 
playing in a declining area near what passes for downtown in an area where 12 
million people are spread out 60 miles north and south and 50 miles east. The 
Oakland Raiders, that bunch of misfits and outcasts who appeal to the lunchpail 
guys like those who took the plane south eight times a year. 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, they'd fit in Pittsburgh or Cleveland or Boston, but not LA -- not enough 
stars, except for Bo and he only shows up for half a season. 
</P>
<P>
"As a sports town, Los Angeles has always been a hard sell," NFL Commissioner 
Paul Tagliabue said Monday after the Raiders announced their move. "That's what 
a lot of owners tried to tell Al when he decided to move." 
</P>
<P>
Davis acknowledges some of that. 
</P>
<P>
But his oft-stated theory is that the Raiders' attendance problem -- they 
barely sold out half the 90,000-seat Coliseum for most of their games last 
season -- is due to the team's decline on the field. They were 8-1 in the 
strike-shortened first season in Los Angeles; won the Super Bowl their second 
year and were 11-5 and 12-4 their third and fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Since then they've been 28-33. 
</P>
<P>
"We just didn't get the caliber of players we had been getting," says Tom 
Flores, who played for the Raiders in Oakland, coached them to Super Bowl 
titles in Oakland and Los Angeles and is now the president of the Seattle 
Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
There's more. 
</P>
<P>
The USFL, for example, put a team in Los Angeles and did so poorly that a 
couple of times reporters actually counted the house in the Coliseum. The 
Express played their final game at a junior college. 
</P>
<P>
League officials finally came up with a theory -- the weather is too good, 
there are race tracks, beaches, other things to do. 
</P>
<P>
"It just wasn't the same," says Matt Millen, who played for the Raiders in both 
cities and is now with San Francisco. "In the Coliseum, you could be tied 17-17 
in the third quarter with one team driving for the go-ahead score. Then someone 
would yell 'Surf's up!' and everyone would head for the beach." 
</P>
<P>
Millen's not the only one who thinks the Raider mystique literally went south 
with the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Art Shell, the current coach, is the quintessential Raider -- an offensive 
tackle who played for the team in Oakland for 15 years, then became an 
assistant coach before taking over when Mike Shanahan was fired four games into 
last season. Shanahan was a Los Angeles aberration, the only Raider coach who 
hadn't been a Raider, a guy who grew up in the organization. 
</P>
<P>
Shell's reaction to the move was a Raider reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going home," he said, "I'm going home."

DAVIS GETS HIS WAY ONCE AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE HAMELIN, MCCLATCHY NEWS SERVICES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The story is legend, and I've told it before, about Charger Coach Harland 
Svare, after a game played in Oakland in 1972, shaking his fist at the ceiling 
fixture in the visitors' locker room and bellowing, "Damn you, Al Davis!" -- on 
the assumption that the Raiders boss had the place bugged. 
</P>
<P>
It is not an apocryphal story. Dr. Arnold Mandell, the Chargers' team 
psychiatrist, was a witness and wrote of it in his book, "The Nightmare 
Season." And it was not necessarily a crazy assumption, although few teams need 
psychotherapy badly enough to employ their own shrink. It just speaks to the 
impact Davis had on opponents. 
</P>
<P>
When asked, some years later, Davis merely smiled his mysterious smile. "The 
thing wasn't in the light fixture" is all he'd admit. 
</P>
<P>
Davis is cunning, and tough, and occasionally devious. Former Charger owner 
Gene Klein, who by way of incredible coincidence died on Monday, once sued him, 
claiming that Davis' little intrigues had contributed to an earlier heart 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Murphy, the San Diego sports writer for whom the town named its stadium, 
once wrote of Davis: 
</P>
<P>
"He is often portrayed as a sinister figure . . . a paranoid genius who shields 
the Raiders' practice field with 20-foot walls, guard towers and Doberman 
pinschers straining and barking at the end of their leashes; who flies U-2 
sorties to spy on the enemy, a white scarf trailing from his neck; who hires 
bartenders to eavesdrop on the conversations of his athletes; who floods the 
playing surface in Oakland because the Raiders, with their mastery of the 
forward pass, have an edge on a muddy field." Murphy wrote this in one of his 
books. He entitled it "Damn You, Al Davis!" 
</P>
<P>
It is reasonable to assume that Al found this in no way offensive. 
</P>
<P>
When Jack died, it was Al who stood up in the church and delivered the eulogy. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, Al Davis came home. Eight years after whisking the Raiders away to Los 
Angeles, he delivered them back. Everyone should have expected it, I suppose. 
</P>
<P>
Of his three choices -- staying, or moving to Sacramento, or to Oakland -- it 
seemed the least likely choice. 
</P>
<P>
That's our Al. 
</P>
<P>
He fought a lengthy court battle with the National Football League to establish 
it was his right to move his team where he wanted . . . and that club owners 
own teams, not the townsfolk . . . and that NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle was 
not, contrary to popular assumption, God. 
</P>
<P>
Some called this crusade of his noble (I was one), and others called it 
mercenary, and now everyone will sit down and wonder what it all proved, since 
he appears to be back where he started. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, he has come out ahead dollar-wise. The city of Oakland has deeded over 
the town. The 15-year deal city officials proposed should be worth $600 
million. Officials there, in the wake of the October earthquake, see landing 
the Raiders as the start of a renaissance. 
</P>
<P>
People here argue that Al would have done better in the North Natomas area of 
Sacramento, with a piece of the stadium. And maybe it would have been different 
if this city's stadium were something more than a hole in the ground, two years 
shy of reality. We never will know now. Al will never know, either. 
</P>
<P>
Unless, of course, the fans in Oakland have long enough memories and, in the 
long run, reject Al and his team. 
</P>
<P>
He will be 75 when the lease there runs out. Who can say if he will have 
outlived his wanderlust? 
</P>
<P>
Has all this diminished the Al Davis aura? Todd Christensen, the old Raider 
tight end-turned-announcer, said on ESPN Monday that "no doubt his mystique has 
been broken." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe so, maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the Raiders won one Super Bowl and three division titles in 
their first four years there. Yet it wasn't enough to build much of a fan base. 
</P>
<P>
In Year Five, the club slipped to 8-8, and the next year 5-10, and attendance 
plunged by 17,000 a game. In six of those seasons, Raiders attendance averaged 
50,000-odd, not two-thirds of capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Who was it that failed, then? Al? Or Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
It seems to me L.A. is the poorer for all this, and Al sure as hell isn't. The 
last thing anyone could accuse Al of being these days is poor. 
</P>
<P>
As for Sacramento, where people are paying a sales tax that was supposed to 
help rebuild Oakland, it's hard understanding how that city can turn around and 
spend all the dough to steal the team out from under us. 
</P>
<P>
Angelenos can make the same gripe, only they didn't hike their hotel tax and 
agree to an entertainment tax to raise dough for a team -- dough that now will 
be spent at the politicos' whim. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, Davis' move to Oakland probably kills any chance of Sacramento 
getting an NFL team for as long as he's there. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento took its best shot, and got it right in the chops. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's one more team within driving distance for capital residents. And 
the focus now is on getting a baseball team, where it probably should have been 
all along. There's that on the plus side . . . and yet the question persists: 
did Al use us? Was Sacramento a bargaining chip, nothing more? 
</P>
<P>
Did he have all our ceiling lights bugged? 
</P>
<P>
Do you really have any doubts now? 
</P>
<P>
Lift your eyes, Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Raise your fists. 
</P>
<P>
And repeat after me, at the top of your lungs, those immortal words of Harland 
Svare . . .

CHAPMAN TAKES 2 OF 3 FROM STRUGGLING TOROS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A third of the way through the season, the Cal State Dominguez Hills baseball 
team still lacks consistency. 
</P>
<P>
That was the assessment of second-year Coach George Wing after the Toros 
dropped two of three California Collegiate Athletic Assn. games to Chapman 
College, including a 9-4 loss Saturday at Hart Park in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
"Early on we had good hitting and our pitching was struggling," Wing said. 
"This weekend we got pitching, but our bats went into the tank and (Friday) so 
did our gloves." 
</P>
<P>
The Toros (5-6, 9-10-1 overall) fell to the .500 mark Friday by committing four 
errors in a 5-4 loss. Visiting Chapman's winning run scored in the top of the 
ninth inning on a passed ball. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's loss was the first for pitcher Armando Gomez (4-1), who has been a 
standout for the Toros. 
</P>
<P>
"We make a couple of easy ground balls and I'm 5-0," Gomez told a group of 
well-wishers at Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
Explained Wing: "We had three chances to turn double plays, and we didn't get 
them." 
</P>
<P>
The Toros opened the series with a 5-3 victory at Chapman on Thursday and 
appeared to stay within striking range of idle UC Riverside, which leads the 
CCAA with a 7-2 record. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Gilbert Diaz (1-1) picked up the victory by scattering eight hits and 
striking out six. He walked only one. Darrell Connor, who has a 13-game hitting 
streak, and Miguel Medina each picked up his second home run of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Hits in all three games of the series also gave the league's leading hitter, 
Fred Camarena, an eight-game streak. Camarena went two for four Saturday, 
raising his batting average to .460. 
</P>
<P>
But there were few other offensive highlights for the Toros. George Scott saw 
his hitting streak snapped at eight games Saturday when he fouled a ball off 
his foot in the first inning and had to leave the contest. 
</P>
<P>
The Toros entered the three-game set tied with Cal Poly San Luis Obispo for 
third place in the CCAA, just a couple of games off the pace set by Riverside 
and second-place Cal State Northridge (7-5). Chapman was only a half-game 
behind Dominguez Hills, however. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the Toros figured to light up the scoreboard. In their three previous 
games, including a wild 20-19 victory over San Luis Obispo on March 9, they had 
scored 43 runs. 
</P>
<P>
But the bats suddenly went quiet, especially on Saturday. The Toros stung the 
ball often, but mostly for hard outs, especially in the late innings when they 
tried to come from behind. 
</P>
<P>
A three-run homer by Chapman's Doug Yates broke the game open in the bottom of 
the seventh. Yates' blast came off a hanging curve delivered by losing pitcher 
Willie Navarette (1-2) on a 1-1 count. 
</P>
<P>
"The little things are eating us up right now," said Wing, who indicated that 
he was generally pleased by his pitching staff in the series. "We know what we 
are up against, and we are digging ourselves a hole." 
</P>
<P>
The series with Chapman returns to Hart Park this Friday at 2:30 p.m. and 
concludes Saturday at 1 p.m. at Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Wing wouldn't admit that the Toros need to win both games, saying: "We are 
still right there in the pack" in the CCAA race. "There's really nobody that is 
going to run away with this thing."

Morningside High School girls basketball Coach Frank Scott didn't need to give 
his team a pep talk before Saturday's State Division I title game. 
</P>
<P>
Berkeley Coach Gene Nakamura already had seen to that. 
</P>
<P>
Inspired by remarks made by Nakamura in a Times' South Bay section story, the 
Lady Monarchs successfully defended their Division I title with a 67-56 victory 
over Berkeley at the Oakland Coliseum Arena. 
</P>
<P>
In the article, which ran Thursday, Nakamura said that Berkeley was "not awed" 
by Morningside and boasted that Berkeley center Jualeah Woods had "outplayed" 
Morningside's 6-foot-5 Lisa Leslie in a game last year. He also said the 
Yellowjackets planned to play Leslie "head up," without the benefit of a 
special defense. 
</P>
<P>
Scott said he showed the article to his players and brought a copy to Oakland. 
He pulled it out of his clipboard after the game. 
</P>
<P>
"It gave us a little extra motivation," Scott said. "I was shocked that he 
would make those kind of remarks in the newspaper. I showed it to Lisa, and she 
just went into deep meditation right then." 
</P>
<P>
Leslie responded with one of the finest games of her illustrious high school 
career. Despite playing with an undetermined illness, she had 35 points, 12 
rebounds and seven blocked shots. She scored 13 of the Lady Monarchs' last 15 
points after Berkeley had drawn within 52-49 with 4:45 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
"(Nakamura) did a lot of talking," Leslie said. "I think he wanted the 
publicity. It's kind of embarrassing when you start talking before you play." 
</P>
<P>
Nakamura said he didn't regret making his comments. However, he did give Leslie 
credit for making his defensive strategy look inadequate. As it turned out, 
Berkeley didn't have anyone capable of playing the All-American "head up." 
</P>
<P>
"Not too many people can guard that 6-5 girl," he said. "I think she's matured. 
I've seen her when she gets too emotional and gets in foul trouble. She did a 
hell of a job staying under control tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Leslie, who had been plagued by foul trouble in several playoff games, stayed 
out of trouble this time. She didn't pick up her third foul until late in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"She wasn't as aggressive as usual because she wasn't feeling well," Scott 
said. "Maybe that was a blessing in disguise." 
</P>
<P>
Leslie was taken to a hospital after the game as a precautionary measure, 
according to officials at the state championships. Scott said she may be 
suffering from an early case of the chicken pox. Leslie's younger sister had 
the chicken pox two or three weeks ago, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie's illness was reflected in the lack of emotion she showed during the 
game, but it didn't detract from her performance. After Berkeley cut 
Morningside's lead to three points in the fourth quarter, Leslie scored four 
straight baskets to ice the game. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was worried when Berkeley made its move behind point guard Tanda 
Rucker (25 points, including three three-point shots), Scott replied: "We still 
had Lisa in the game. Anytime we have her in the game, I feel confident." 
</P>
<P>
Leslie was able to stay out of foul trouble, but Berkeley wasn't as fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
Woods, the Yellowjackets' 6-foot center, picked up her third foul early in the 
second quarter and her fourth with 5:08 left in the third period. Both times, 
she was benched for several minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"The calls were not going our way," Nakamura said. "If they had gone the 
opposite way, you might have seen a different outcome." 
</P>
<P>
Morningside also received a strong inside game from 6-4 sophomore forward Janet 
Davis, who had 14 points and seven rebounds, and from forward Akiba Flanagan, 
who had a game-high 15 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Monarchs never trailed after reeling off 15 unanswered points to take 
a 23-12 lead early in the second quarter. Davis had six points during the run 
and Leslie scored five. 
</P>
<P>
Berkeley had little success shooting over Morningside's 2-3 zone, making only 
24 of 87 field-goal attempts for 27.6%.

STATE TITLE MARKS SUCCESSFUL END TO TARVER'S QUEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Shon Tarver, Santa Clara High's consummate guard, his mission is complete. 
</P>
<P>
When Santa Clara defeated Fairfield Vanden, 56-38, to win its second 
consecutive boys' state Division IV title Friday, Tarver fulfilled a promise he 
made to himself at the end of last season. 
</P>
<P>
The final game also meant the breaking of silence from Tarver, who had not 
spoken to the media all season under Coach Lou Cvijanovich's team interview 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
"I was on a mission all season," Tarver said after establishing a Division IV 
title-game scoring record of 35 points. "I was dedicated to get better and help 
prove (this) team is as good as last year's team." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara entered the state final undefeated (27-0) and riding a 44-game 
winning streak. After scoring only three points in the opening quarter, Tarver 
took control of the game in the second period, scoring 14 points as the Saints 
took a 28-17 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really missing early on," said Tarver, who averaged 36 points a game in 
the state playoffs. "No one can be on all of the time, but scoring is not the 
biggest thing for me." 
</P>
<P>
Cvijanovich agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"(Tarver) is as good a ballplayer that there is in the country," he said. "If 
there is anyone better, I want to see him." 
</P>
<P>
Even though Tarver had a hand in more than 80% of Santa Clara's scoring -- he 
dished out a championship-game record five assists to go with his 35 points -- 
his final numbers show that he is more than a scorer. 
</P>
<P>
On a night when point guard Bruce Howarth got into foul trouble early and 
finished with only two points, Tarver also became the Saints' defensive leader. 
He led the team with seven rebounds, four blocked shots and two steals. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense has been our cup of tea all season," Cvijanovich said. "When 
Howarth went out with his third foul (with 5 minutes 49 seconds left in the 
first half) we had to pick up our defensive intensity." 
</P>
<P>
Tarver did just that, quickly forcing a pair of turnovers and connecting on a 
pair of three-point shots before assisting on three-point play by Chris Cole. 
</P>
<P>
It was anticlimactic from there as the Saints turned the game into a blowout, 
something that has become as common as the red socks Cvijanovich wears with his 
blue suits each game. 
</P>
<P>
"It is something that I started 38 years ago when I first began coaching," 
Cvijanovich said. "It has become a tradition around here." 
</P>
<P>
Winning also has become a tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"Winning two state titles in a row is something special," Tarver said, "but it 
is something that I expected."

Luggage in hand, Jussi Hamalainen of Agoura Hills runs 12 miles to a bus stop 
in Woodland Hills because: 
</P>
<P>
a) He wants to break in his new Nikes. 
</P>
<P>
b) A large animal is chasing him. 
</P>
<P>
c) It's faster than driving on the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
d) The airport shuttle is cheaper in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The answer is d. Hamalainen would have to spend an additional $4 to take the 
shuttle from Agoura, which seems to make him an extremist when it comes to 
saving a buck. But while Hamalainen has to be careful about money, he's really 
only extreme about his running. A 12-mile jaunt hardly makes him break a sweat, 
much to the relief of his fellow shuttle passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Hamalainen, 43, is a professional running extremist. A transplanted Finn who 
moved here 2 1/2 years ago for the sole purpose of running under sunny skies, 
he runs 100 miles a week, enters ultra-marathons (50- and 100-mile road races) 
and often does a marathon before breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
"Jussi (pronounced U-C) enters 10Ks just for fun," says Thom Bancroft, who's 
letting Hamalainen live in a trailer behind his house. "He'll run the race and 
then run home with the trophy." 
</P>
<P>
Hamalainen ran the recent Los Angeles Marathon in 2 hours 32 minutes 36 seconds 
-- roughly four minutes off his personal best -- and finished 52nd. "The 
marathon is really a short race for him," Bancroft says. 
</P>
<P>
Rain and cool weather at the L. A. Marathon reminded Hamalainen of Finland in 
the spring, and the snow on distant mountains reminded him of the Finnish 
winter, which was the reason he left the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it here," he says in halting English. "It's no cold." 
</P>
<P>
Hamalainen was introduced to Bancroft by Bancroft's daughter, who had met 
Hamalainen through a Finnish-born track coach at Cal Lutheran. Living on a 
small sponsorship from a Finnish furniture store in Beverly Hills, Hamalainen 
hangs out with other runners and socializes at a Finnish community center in 
North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
While Hamalainen suffered no side effects from the L. A. Marathon, Laura Burns 
of Camarillo was a tad creaky in the knees the day after the race. And no 
wonder: She has undergone five knee operations for injuries sustained playing 
volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
"My knees were pretty sore," says Burns, who finished 33rd among women with a 
time of 3:05:42. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Burns' problem was playing volleyball so far from a beach -- at the 
University of Idaho. She didn't take up running until after college, about four 
years ago. This was her third L. A. Marathon and her best finish. A year ago, 
she staggered in at 3:42 with aching feet caused by tight shoes. 
</P>
<P>
This year, she tried a prerace diet recommended in a book her brother gave her. 
"But I didn't feel any difference as far as energy," she says. In fact, she 
blamed the diet for causing her to bottom out at 18 miles when she was on a 
2:52 pace. 
</P>
<P>
"But I was really encouraged with my finish this year," says Burns, a 
26-year-old chemist. "After the race I remember saying to myself, 'Gosh, I 
should take running more seriously.' So now I'm doing the Big Sur Marathon next 
month." 
</P>
<P>
Burns says she would run "twice a day" if she wasn't such a workaholic. "I have 
to force myself to get out of the office and run. But I have to do it. I get 
pretty wound up at work and running is the only thing I can find that relaxes 
me." 
</P>
<P>
To avoid strain on her knees, Burns trains in the dirt fields behind her house 
with Kali, her 11-year-old Lab mix. 
</P>
<P>
While runners usually have aching legs after the marathon, wheelchair 
competitor Don Caron of West Hills felt sore in the upper body. Caron rolled 
across the line in 2:12:08 to finish 20th in the wheelchair division. 
</P>
<P>
"After the race, runners always come up to us and say how much they admire what 
we've done," Caron says. "But we admire them. It's a lot harder to run than to 
wheel." 
</P>
<P>
Caron has been in four L. A. Marathons and found the going tougher than usual 
this year because of the rain. "Us Californians are sort of soft and weren't 
prepared for the rain," he says. The moisture "made your hands slip on the rim" 
of the wheelchair. In last year's race, Caron clocked 2:06 and was hoping for a 
sub-two-hour performance this year. 
</P>
<P>
A spinal injury in 1963 put Caron in a wheelchair and he got into road racing 
during rehabilitation. Today, he works out with a regular group of wheelchair 
racers, usually at Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
"The harder you work, the better you get," says Caron, a purchasing agent for a 
construction company. "There's not a lot of secrets to doing well."

MOORPARK DEFEATS VALLEY, REMAINS IN FIRST-PLACE TIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
After spending 20 years coaching at the high school level, it has taken less 
than a season for Ken Wagner to notice a difference in his first year at 
Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no safe lead in junior college," said Wagner, who coached Camarillo 
High for the past eight seasons. "Anything can happen. Everybody has the 
potential to hit. It's kind of scary. Leads just don't last." 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Moorpark erased a 5-2 third-inning deficit, scoring eight runs 
over the next four innings, en route to a 13-9 Western State Conference victory 
over Valley at Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders (12-6, 7-1 in conference) maintained a share of the WSC lead with 
Cuesta, a 10-5 winner over Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark collected 18 hits off four pitchers, including seven for extra bases. 
Darin Furlong (two runs batted in) and Terry Hill each had four hits. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is hitting right now," Furlong said. "We have tremendous confidence. 
We can depend on anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark belted three doubles and sent 10 batters to the plate in a four-run 
fifth inning that gave the Raiders an 11-5 lead. Two runs scored on Furlong's 
double and Jason Jones and Ken Knight doubled to score two more. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark reliever John Dickinson (1-0) allowed a run in the third inning but 
held the Monarchs scoreless until the eighth when he was tagged for three runs. 
</P>
<P>
Valley (6-14-2, 2-5), the recipient of seven walks in the first three innings, 
scored two runs in each of the first two innings and a run in the third. But 
the Monarchs left the bases loaded in the second and third and stranded eight 
runners in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good about the way we played today," said Valley Coach Chris Johnson, 
whose team lost, 11-3, to Pierce on Thursday and suffered its third conference 
loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"After the pounding we took against Pierce, we could have gone into the tank. 
We battled back and didn't give up. I'm proud of us. We just had some problems 
with our pitching." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Caveretta was three for four and E. J. Pape had two doubles to lead 
Valley's 14-hit attack.

HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
CULVER CITY'S DUNLAP HITS FOUR HOMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Troy Dunlap of Culver City High liked what he saw Saturday as he dug into the 
batter's box at Faith Baptist: a left-field fence only 230 feet from home 
plate. 
</P>
<P>
Dunlap, a 6-foot, 185-pound senior outfielder, hit four home runs -- all over 
the left-field fence -- as Culver City routed Faith Baptist, 23-1, in the first 
round of the Redondo-Palos Verdes tournament. The four homers tied a Southern 
Section single-game record set by Carey Windes of St. John Bosco against St. 
Anthony in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Dunlap blasted solo home runs in the first and fifth innings, launched a 
two-run shot in the sixth and added a grand slam to highlight a nine-run 
seventh. All told, Dunlap was six for eight with eight runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
"And his hardest hit ball was an out," Culver City Coach Bill Coates said. "The 
left fielder made a tremendous catch at the wall." 
</P>
<P>
Faith Baptist Coach Harry Morgan said that it wouldn't have mattered if the 
wall were moved back. 
</P>
<P>
"They were all hard-hit balls," Morgan said. "I don't want to take anything 
away from him." 
</P>
<P>
Senior left-hander Mauricio Estavil (3-0) pitched five innings to earn the win. 
Freshman David Tibor and Lawrence Kennedy each singled for Faith Baptist (1-3). 
</P>
<P>
In other games: 
</P>
<P>
Royal 6, West Torrance 5 (nine innings) -- Will Egan was three for four and 
Royal (4-2) rallied with two runs in the bottom of the ninth inning in a 
first-round game of the Redondo-Palos Verdes tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi 12, North Torrance 2 -- Rick Marino was two for four with four RBIs and 
Scott Barton was two for three with two RBIs as the Celts (6-2-1) coasted in a 
first-round game of the Redondo-Palos Verdes tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Alemany 3, La Serna 2 -- Joey Rosselli struck out two in the seventh inning to 
preserve the Indians' victory in the first-round game of the Redondo-Palos 
Verdes tournament. Leo Tejada drove in two runs and Greg Thompson drove in one 
for Alemany (4-4). 
</P>
<P>
Village Christian 16-6, Murphy 0-1 -- Matt Bates and Matt Smay pitched complete 
games in leading Village Christian (7-0) to a doubleheader sweep at Cal State 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In the first game, Bates (2-0), a left-hander, struck out seven, surrendered 
just three hits and walked one in notching the shutout. Teammates Matt Henzie 
and Geoff Agnor each drove in two runs. In the second game, Smay (2-0) fired a 
one-hitter, struck out 12 and walked three. Herbie Gonzalez, Mark Vail and 
Panos Panay each had two hits for Village Christian (7-0). 
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands 13-12, Ventura 5-8 -- Jacob Cruz went five for seven on the day 
to lead host Channel Islands (6-3) to a sweep of a nonleague doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
In the opener, winner Angel Aragon (1-1) surrendered just one hit through four 
innings and teammates Richard Tepezano and Manuel Padilla hit home runs. 
</P>
<P>
In the second game, paced by two-run doubles from Cruz and winner Jose Gastelum 
(1-0) in the bottom of the sixth inning, Channel Islands notched a 
come-from-behind win. Also in the six-run sixth inning, Tepezano drove in his 
15th run of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard 8-15, Brentwood 3-2 -- Harvard (3-6) collected 19 hits in the nonleague 
doubleheader at Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
Jono Pivo was three for three and scored three runs in the first game. Mike 
Wolf was two for three, including a run-scoring double. 
</P>
<P>
In the second game, Bobby Mason was two for two with six RBIs. Mason hit a 
three-run home run and a three-run triple. Junior right-hander Joel Saxton 
yielded one hit and one walk while striking out three in four innings. 
</P>
<P>
St. Genevieve 6, Oak Park 5 -- Winning pitcher Carlos Concha (3-0) scored on an 
errant relay throw after a single by Mike Hoffman in the bottom of the seventh 
to propel St. Genevieve in the Highland Hall tournament championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Highland Hall 5, Providence 4 -- Robert Ramirez (3-1) pitched the first four 
innings and had two hits to lead Highland Hall, the second-ranked school in 
Small Schools, in the third-place game in the Highland Hall tournament.

CLAYTON MAKES GOOD ON 2 FRONTS FOR CSUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pitchers are not supposed to be good hitters, but Northridge's Craig Clayton is 
certainly an exception. 
</P>
<P>
In the eight games he has started on the mound, the sophomore is batting .515 
(17 for 33). 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Clayton ranks among the top five in the California Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. with a batting average of .398, which is about his average (.400, eight 
for 20) during the five games in which he has been the winning pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Losing apparently stokes an even more competitive fire at the plate. In his 
three losses, Clayton has nine hits in 13 at-bats, a .692 average. 
</P>
<P>
Grand theft, guard: Oregon State plucked Gary Payton out of Skyline High in 
Oakland five years ago and he went on to grace the cover of national magazines 
and become an All-American. 
</P>
<P>
Beaver coaches were combing the Bay Area again last week in search of new 
talent. 
</P>
<P>
And again, they found it in a Skyline game. Only this time it was a player from 
the opposing team. 
</P>
<P>
His name: Dorian Manigo from San Francisco Riordan High. 
</P>
<P>
However, recruiters left disappointed when they learned Manigo was already 
taken. Last November, the 6-foot guard committed to Cal State Northridge during 
the NCAA's early signing period. 
</P>
<P>
Manigo, the most valuable player in the West Catholic Athletic League, scored 
25 points Saturday night as Riordan (29-3) fell to Mater Dei, 62-60, in the 
Division I state championship game in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"He plays the game to the theme of Jaws," said Vern Harris, veteran high school 
reporter for the San Francisco Examiner. "He sort of cruises around the court 
and then pounces like the shark, whether it be on a steal, or making a pass or 
scoring." 
</P>
<P>
Manigo is a good enough ballhandler to play point guard, but Harris believes 
his future is at off-guard. 
</P>
<P>
Manigo is the second Riordan player in two years to sign with Northridge. Percy 
Fisher, a 6-7 frontcourt reserve, showed great potential for the Matadors 
during the past season. 
</P>
<P>
On the flip side: Well, one out of two isn't bad. The other basketball player 
Northridge signed early, Mark Wilkinson of Foothill High in Santa Ana, appears 
headed for junior college. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Reames, Wilkinson's coach, said the 6-4 standout is going to night school 
in an attempt to raise his grades to NCAA Division I entrance standards. But 
the odds of him succeeding don't look good. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Wilkinson, the Century League's most valuable player, meets core 
curriculum requirements, he still must pass the Scholastic Aptitude Test to be 
eligible. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkinson, a great leaper with major-college quickness, averaged 20.1 points 
and 6.9 rebounds and shot 56%. 
</P>
<P>
Two-liners: Tom Parada, a former basketball standout at St. Francis High, was a 
hit during a halftime segment on ESPN last week. Parada, a 5-foot-1 guard who 
made Cal State Fullerton's team as a freshman walk-on this season, did a 
commendable Dick Vitale impression. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Pete Cassidy, Northridge basketball coach, and Pete Accardy, CSUN's swimming 
coach, were college teammates in 1959-60 on the basketball team of what was 
then known as San Fernando Valley State. Asked which was the better basketball 
player, Cassidy diplomatically replied, "(Accardy) was a better swimmer than I 
was." 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA Division II swimming and diving championships had been over for two 
days, but Northridge on Monday was still protesting (to no avail) its 
disqualification in the women's 400-yard medley relay. A violation during the 
race cost the Lady Matadors a chance to win their fourth consecutive 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
Rally of Kingsmen: When Rich Hill, Cal Lutheran's baseball coach, says, "We 
don't ever feel like we're out of a ballgame," he speaks from experience. 
</P>
<P>
Seven of the Kingsmen's 11 wins this season are of the come-from-behind 
variety. 
</P>
<P>
The all-region team: The frontcourt would include Don MacLean and Trevor Wilson 
of UCLA and Gary Gray of UC Santa Barbara. In the backcourt would be Adonis 
Jordan of Kansas and Mitchell Butler of UCLA. Off the bench would come Harvey 
Mason of Arizona, Mark Robinson of Indiana, Stacey Cvijanovich and Travis Bice 
of Nevada Las Vegas, Keith Owens of UCLA and Richard Branham of Cal. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA Division I basketball tournament included 11 players from high schools 
in the region, including three from Cleveland (Wilson, Jordan and Branham) and 
Simi Valley (MacLean, Robinson and Bice). 
</P>
<P>
Gray went to Granada Hills, Butler to Oakwood, Mason to Crescenta Valley, 
Cvijanovich to Santa Clara and Owens to Birmingham.

WALL STREET / JOHN CRUDELE: TRASH ISSUES LIKELY TO BE AT TOP OF HEAP FOR 
INVESTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CRUDELE, JOHN CRUDELE is a financial columnist for the New York Post. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few years ago when the ITT Corp. was planning to close a plant in Georgia 
that made creosote-soaked railroad ties and telephone poles, its accountants 
recommended that the company face financial reality. 
</P>
<P>
The plant had damaged the land on which it stood and the mess would have to be 
cleaned up. To its credit, ITT didn't stall. It took a $30-million charge 
against earnings so that the money would be available to get the job done. 
</P>
<P>
Just about every expert agrees that the 1990s will become known as the decade 
when environmental issues truly came into their own. And trash, you might say, 
will be at the top of the heap for investors. 
</P>
<P>
Debating the theoretical merits of cleaning up the environment (as happened in 
the '80s), and actually going ahead and scrubbing the sky and earth, of course, 
are two very different things. And one factor that could turn the theoretical 
into the actual, the experts contend, are pencil pushers like ITT's 
accountants. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be the accountants who could be the catalysts that get 
industries to recognize their true liability," says Kenneth Ch'uan-kai Leung, 
environmental analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
While companies and legislators in the 1980s first debated the need for 
cleaning up the environment, then moved on to debating ways to accomplish the 
task, Leung figures that the time is about right for the companies to replace 
talk with action. 
</P>
<P>
This premise is causing a lot of investors to wage some mighty big bets on 
environmental stocks. And in 1989, those investments paid off. Smith Barney's 
index of stocks involved in the solid waste business rose 59% last year, while 
its index of hazardous waste stocks jumped more than 42%. The overall stock 
market rose about 27% in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Does this mean that pollution control stocks have already discounted -- as they 
say on Wall Street -- the strides that the industry is likely to make in the 
1990s? 
</P>
<P>
"Expectations could get ahead of reality," says Marc H. Sulam, the environment 
control analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. He thinks that this may have 
happened already in the case of hazardous waste stocks. He believes that shares 
of solid waste companies might be a better bet right now than hazardous waste 
stocks. Among the stocks he likes are Waste Management, Laidlaw Industries and 
Browning-Ferris. 
</P>
<P>
There isn't anything mysterious about why analysts are attracted to the shares 
of solid waste companies such as these. There is a well-publicized scarcity of 
landfill in parts of the country. And experts don't think that major cities 
such as New York are going to be able to come up with alternative ways to get 
rid of their everyday garbage any time in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a crisis of capacity, mostly on the East Coast of the United States." 
says Aldo Mazzaferro, an analyst with C. J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc., 
about the landfill situation. 
</P>
<P>
Companies that own land on which garbage can be dumped might reasonably be 
expected to make a pile of money from their ability to pile trash. But 
landfills aren't the only things getting investors in garbage excited. During 
the next decade, both the Departments of Energy and Defense are expected to 
launch stepped-up campaigns to clean up the mess they've made around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
And when the government starts spending, the experts believe that everyone 
could get rich. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Next Earnings Period Bears Close Watching 
</P>
<P>
It's nearly time to worry once again about that old stock market nemesis -- 
corporate earnings. And for the third straight quarter, there could be a lot to 
worry about. 
</P>
<P>
The stock market reacted badly to weakening profits in the last two quarters. 
Stock prices fell sharply in October, when many companies were reporting their 
third-quarter earnings. Then the market turned in another bad performance in 
January and February, when corporations were reporting that their after-tax 
profits fell an estimated 1.4% during the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Profits for the first quarter, which ends March 31 for most companies, probably 
won't start rolling in until around mid-April. But that doesn't mean that Wall 
Street will wait until the last minute to start trembling. 
</P>
<P>
This month Monsanto Co. decided to give the world a peak at its first-quarter 
numbers. The St. Louis-based chemical company said its profit will be on track 
with what it had expected internally but probably would be below Wall Street's 
expectations. Wall Street would have none of that. It promptly pulled the value 
of Monsanto's stock down a hefty 5%. 
</P>
<P>
The profits that corporations report could be especially important this time 
around because government statistics on the economy have not given investors a 
clear indication of business conditions. Some stats have been pointing to a 
very slow economy; others to a moderately improving business outlook. 
</P>
<P>
Yet while economic statistics are always open to a variety of interpretations, 
the earnings that corporations report are, more often, taken at their face 
value. 
</P>
<P>
Companies could report a modest 2.5% improvement in their first-quarter 
profits, according to Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Wall Street analysts have generally been trimming their earnings 
estimates for the rest of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Why Houghton Mifflin Stock Is Climbing 
</P>
<P>
Almost a year ago, Robert M. Bass, the Texas investor and sometime corporate 
raider, bought a large stake in Houghton Mifflin Co. The stock soared (more 
than $10 in one day alone) as Wall Street smelled a takeover attempt in the 
making. 
</P>
<P>
But neither Bass nor anyone else tried to acquire the Boston-based textbook 
publisher in 1989, and the speculation (as well as Houghton's stock) soon 
withered. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street doesn't give up on its dreams easily and, now, more than one year 
later, Houghton Mifflin's is hot again. The publisher's stock was up more than 
$5 a share over the last two weeks even though trading volume was painfully 
low. 
</P>
<P>
Is the "Second Annual Houghton Mifflin Raid" under way? 
</P>
<P>
Speculators think that it might be. But a Wall Street source close to Houghton 
Mifflin says the speculators are all wrong -- they're making book, if you will, 
on the wrong outcome. 
</P>
<P>
First, here's the speculators' side. 
</P>
<P>
Bass was in the media period of his investment career last year when he 
purchased over 5% of Houghton Mifflin's stock. At about the same time the Texan 
had purchased shares of a number of other communications companies and was also 
rumored to have taken a large position in Tribune Co., owner of the New York 
Daily News and Chicago Tribune newspaper, and Time Inc., the magazine 
publisher. 
</P>
<P>
Bass has long since forgotten about Houghton Mifflin and most of the other 
publishers. After peaking at $49.50 a share, Houghton Mifflin's stock -- until 
recently -- was mired in the $20s. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street isn't sentimental, but it figures that the one-year anniversary of 
Bass' disclosure could be significant for Houghton Mifflin. 
</P>
<P>
The speculators argue that when Bass disclosed late last January that he owned 
the Houghton Mifflin stock, it probably sent the company to its longtime 
investment adviser, Rothschild Inc., for advice and alternatives. That, the 
speculators say, was a logical thing to do when someone of Bass' stature is 
making threats. 
</P>
<P>
What an investment banker will typically do is go to several potential buyers 
of the company and ask, "If we need someone to come to our rescue, will you be 
available?" If so, they'll have to sign a confidentiality agreement and swear 
not to harass the company for a specific period of time. 
</P>
<P>
Often, these confidentiality agreements last for a year. That's why the 
anniversary could be significant. 
</P>
<P>
If this theory is correct, that would mean that any cease-fire that Houghton 
Mifflin might have signed with potential buyers would soon be coming to an end. 
And the publisher could, therefore, be very vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
Speculators figure that other publishing companies -- such as Paramount 
Communications, McGraw-Hill, Bertelsmann and Hachette -- might like to own 
Houghton Mifflin, especially if the price isn't much higher than what the stock 
is now trading at. 
</P>
<P>
What really has the speculators excited is the fact that much of the buying of 
Houghton Mifflin's stock these past few weeks seems to be coming from just two 
investment firms -- First Boston Corp. and Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. And 
concentrated buying like that could mean that a corporate raider is on the 
prowl. 
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street source who is close to Houghton Mifflin thinks that the 
speculators who have concocted this scenario might do well as Hollywood 
scriptwriters but not in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
"The company is not for sale," he says, adding that Houghton Mifflin did not 
search for a "white knight" because of Bass. So, there would have been no 
standstill agreements that are now expiring. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody perceived (Bass) as a threat, and he wasn't a threat. He took his 
profits and went his merry way. It was never seen as unfriendly," said the 
source, who asked to remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
The "first SOB" who tries to threaten Houghton Mifflin, the source added, will 
be "eviscerated." For those who don't have a dictionary handy, that's what you 
do to the insides of a fish before cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Why has the stock been climbing? This source thinks that Houghton Mifflin is 
becoming attractive to some money managers. 
</P>
<P>
J. Kendrick Noble, publishing analyst for Paine Webber Inc., recently started 
recommending Houghton Mifflin again after a long layoff. He thinks that the 
stock is now attractively priced, and that the publishing business in general 
is turning itself around. "Most analysts are more cautious on the industry than 
I am," admits Noble. 
</P>
<P>
Noble is not basing his new assessment of Houghton Mifflin on the possibility 
of a takeover. But speculators -- who have had their rumor mill come to a 
grinding halt in recent months -- clearly are. 
</P>
<P>
There's no way of knowing whether Hilton Hotels was ever serious about the 
threat to become a private company after acquisition offers didn't come in as 
high as it liked. Hilton took itself off the market two weeks ago, and Hilton's 
stock promptly collapsed in price. But curiously heavy trading in Hilton's 
shares kept speculators hopes alive. A source close to Hilton says it was the 
company buying all that stock. . . .

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / GEORGE L. PERRY: MANAGING ECONOMIC REUNIFICATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE L. PERRY, GEORGE L. PERRY is a senior fellow at the Brookings 
Institution research organization in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the 1960s, the world marveled at the German "economic miracle" as the West 
German economy came back from the rubble of World War II to become the economic 
superpower of Europe. Now, with the end of the Cold War and the promise of 
German reunification, the world looks for an encore as East Germany is pulled 
up to parity with its brother to the west. 
</P>
<P>
East German workers are virtually as skilled, trained and educated as their 
West German brethren, yet they earn lower rel wages as corresponding to their 
lower productivity working in the centrally planned and state-run East German 
economy. West German firms have everything needed to improve that productivity: 
capital, technical skills and business experience. For them, East Germany 
represents the opportunity for highly profitable new investments, both in new 
plants and equipment in the private sector and in the national infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
Given these conditions, interest rates in Germany will need to rise to attract 
investment funds. Similarly, the West German mark will need to appreciate 
against other currencies so as to reduce the German current account surplus and 
shift the export of West German capital from Western Europe, where it now goes, 
to East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Because new investment promises to be so profitable, the stock prices of German 
firms that figure to be involved in the modernization of East Germany shuld 
rise. The effect on the overall stock market will be tempered by the fact that 
some of Germany's traditional export industries, such as chemicals, will suffer 
from the expected appreciation of the West German mark. But because the return 
to investment in East Germany promises to be so great, the German stock market 
ought to rise, on balance, even as its bond market falls and the West German 
mark appreciates. As investment and the efficiencies induced by market 
incentives act on the East German economy, productivity will rise and, with it, 
real wages and living standards of East German workers. 
</P>
<P>
Is it inevitable that all this will work out neatly? If not, what are the 
likely complications? For starters, there is the range of micro-management 
problems associated with converting to a market economy. This conversion will 
lead to largely uncharted territory for all the formerly state-run economies. 
They will surely have problems with both the economic transitions and the 
political and social issues that are part of the change. One would expect East 
Germany to manage these problems comparatively well, thanks to the guidance and 
material aid that will be available from West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the ethnic ties between the Germanys also create a problem that is 
distinctly their own -- the massive migration of workers from East to West. 
Rather than wait for new capital to come to him and raise his living standard 
tomorrow, the East German worker with freedom to relocate has been coming to 
the West where the existing capital and market system raises his living 
standard today. 
</P>
<P>
Motivated largely by the desire to stem this tide of migration, the West 
Germans have proposed imminent full economic union. The idea seems to be that 
if Germany were all one big economy, there would be little incentive to leave 
the East. In this spirit, what exchange rate to use in forging the monetary 
union has been a central issue. Although some of what is being discussed 
publicly may be motivated by today's East German elections, the desire to set 
an exchange rate generous to the East Germans is clear. The black market rate 
has been near one West German mark to 10 East German marks. Estimates based on 
comparative manufacturing productivity have been near one to three. But 
proposals for conversion with unification have gravitated to one to one, which 
is the rate that West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl supported last week. 
</P>
<P>
Such a generous exchange rate would provide a substantial transfer from West to 
East. It is estimated that 180 billion East German marks are waiting to be 
converted, roughly 150 billion in savings and 30 billion in circulation. At an 
even conversion, 180 billion West German marks (about $105 billion) would 
amount to nearly 15% of annual consumption in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Because much of this liquid wealth represents retirement savings of East 
Germans, it would not all be suddenly spent. Nonetheless, if a generous 
exchange rate is provided, it would have to be accompanied by some combination 
of a plan for partially freezing the converted East German assets so that they 
would be spent only gradually over a period of years, and higher taxes to 
suppress West German purchasing power. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever else it does, a generous exchange rate will not stop emigration, 
because the movement of labor mainly depends on the opportunity to increase 
real earnings -- to buy more with a week's pay. Providing parity in exchange 
rates, so that one East German mark trades for one West German mark, cannot 
produce parity in earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the exchange rate -- or when eventually there is a common currency -- 
in a market economy, wages in East Germany will have to adjust to reflect the 
lower productivity of its workers. Thus, the migration incentive will be as 
great as ever, diminishing only gradually as productivity and living standards 
improve in the East. 
</P>
<P>
The dilemma is that encouraging employment and investment in the East requires 
a realistic low wage, while suppressing migration from the East requires an 
unrealistic high wage. To achieve both goals, the West would have to subsidize 
employment in East Germany. Only then could firms in the East have net costs 
low enough to maintain employment at the same time their employees received net 
wages high enough to keep them from leaving. 
</P>
<P>
Although, in principle, they can resolve the dilemma, introducing subsidies is 
risky. Finding the right level of subsidy would not be simple, and the right 
level would not be the same for all industries. Furthermore, subsidies should 
be phased out as new investment and the incentives of a free market raise the 
productivity of East German workers. But even if they could be well designed 
and temporary, introducing a system of subsidies could undermine the broad aim 
of moving East Germany to a market economy. 
</P>
<P>
Excessive migration could be stopped more directly, perhaps by requiring that 
workers have a place to stay and a job to which to go before they relocate. 
Such a direct approach would minimize the economic hazards that would go with 
trying to dampen migration by manipulating wages. But that might not do 
politically. 
</P>
<P>
The fall of the Wall was such a powerful symbol of freedom that to impose even 
sensible restraints on relocation may now be difficult. If so, and if 
policy-makers do not face up to the need to temporarily subsidize employment in 
the East, Germany could face difficult transitional problems, however promising 
the medium run prospects for its economy may be.

BOARD OF ECONOMIST MEMBER DIDN'T REFUTE ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE REAGAN 'BOOM' YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The attack by Board of Economists member David M. Gordon ("Reagan 'Boom' Just a 
Lot of Noise," Feb. 25) on my recent essay in the New York Times is quite 
extraordinary. Professor Gordon never refuted my main point: The 
seven-year-plus economic expansion in the United States since November, 1982, 
is -- using the normal criteria of GNP produced, jobs created, successive 
months of continuous growth and changes in the value of the stock market -- the 
greatest economic expansion we have ever had. 
</P>
<P>
Any beginning graduate student of economics can tell you that the way to 
compare economic expansions or contractions is to apply the same multiple 
criteria to each. Gordon, in an orgy of selective misrepresentation, compares 
jobs and GNP from a number of wildly different time periods. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon is a committed, self-acknowledged Marxist of almost 20 years standing 
and I can understand how he might be personally upset reading a piece by the 
former domestic and economic policy adviser to President Reagan describing 
factually how powerful the U.S. economy is. 
</P>
<P>
By definition, one of America's economic expansions has to be our greatest one; 
perhaps someday Professor Gordon will let us all know which one he thinks is 
the greatest.

COMMENT ON PENSIONS HAS A FAMILIAR RING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the March 4 article "First Executive Casts a Shadow Over Pensions," an 
officer of First Executive states: "The company is in very robust financial 
health. Even suggesting we won't perform on (pension) obligations is 
far-fetched." This parallels the statements from their allies and 
partners-in-junk at Drexel Burnham Lambert who denied the filing-for-bankruptcy 
rumors the day before the actual occurrence.

'NEW WAVE' ECONOMIST A BRIGHT LIGHT ON OFTEN-GLOOMY WALL ST.; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTMENT: ALTHOUGH PRUDENTIAL-BACHE'S EDWARD YARDENI HAS BEGUN SOUNDING 
CAUTIOUS, HE STILL HAS A CORE OF OPTIMISM.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Economists are reputed to be a gloomy lot. The standard economic essay today is 
more than likely to mention America's fatal (fill in the blank: 
competitiveness, inflation, savings rates, cost of capital, etc.). 
</P>
<P>
A notable exception has been Prudential-Bache's Edward Yardeni, who has spent 
three years churning out one essay after another on "New Wave economics" -- 
economics based on a premise that the business cycle, with its inevitable 
downturn, is no longer relevant. 
</P>
<P>
And during the past three years, he has been right. America's economy has 
shrugged off natural disasters, market meltdowns and government fiscal deceit 
without falling off a cliff. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, though, Yardeni began sounding cautious. "I guess I'm more balanced 
now than I have been for the past two years," he said during an interview at 
his office in lower Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
America's messy financial system has become one major problem, he said, in an 
opinion shared widely by others. Another concern is the growing U.S. dependence 
on foreign oil. Energy anxiety has commonly been relegated to the storeroom of 
1970s nightmares, along with discos and leisure suits. But Yardeni said that 
may be premature. 
</P>
<P>
Domestic petroleum production has collapsed in the past five years, from almost 
9 million barrels a day in 1985 to just above 1 million barrels a day 
currently, Yardeni said. That leaves the United States increasingly dependent 
on Middle East countries willing to ignore rational laws of economics and free 
trade in favor of political intrigue. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these worries, Yardeni retains a core optimism. It is based on the 
premise that most of the world has become increasingly rational about economic 
demands. Markets have become more efficient and forced government to be more 
responsive. Even before the Berlin Wall came tumbling down, Yardeni had 
concluded that capitalism had won and, as a result, that self-repairing, 
growing economies were more likely both here and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
His confidence stands out on Wall Street, where an optimistic forecast may 
cover the next few minutes or hours, but seldom years or decades. "Right now we 
are in the process of people giving up on the long term," Yardeni said. But he 
has not. A 5,000 Dow Jones industrial index (it's now just under 2,700) and 
30-year Treasury bond yielding 5% (now about 8.6%) are feasible by 1993, he 
said. "I think the 1990s will be as good for investors as the 1980s were." 
</P>
<P>
In a report issued in late 1988 summing up many of his broader ideas, Yardeni 
wrote the "New Wave Manifesto," a thesis based on the premise that certain 
trends in the economy were fundamentally both positive and powerful. He 
concluded that the harvest-drought theory of economic cycles dating back to 
Biblical times, along with the more modern corollaries like 50-year Kondratieff 
models and Elliott waves, are overly rigid and simplistic. They forecast 
predetermined time frames for success and failure, ignoring changes in the 
economy itself. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he dismisses forecasts of American decline based on more fundamental 
problems, such as a shrinking industrial base, vast debt and unsustainable 
military obligations. 
</P>
<P>
"The hysterics," he said, are based "on backward-looking stuff. There are 
problems, but they are exaggerated." 
</P>
<P>
Of greater consequence, Yardeni asserted, are emerging demographic and 
sociological factors, including an aging population, diversifying economy and 
converging, market-oriented world. He was one the originators, if not the 
originator, of the rolling-recession theory, which contends that instead of a 
broad, 1930s-style Depression, different sectors of the economy decline and 
rise at different times. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, for instance, Wall Street and Detroit are skidding -- an occurrence 
that in prior years would signal a general slowdown. But this time, a 
resurgence in agriculture and energy, the depressed sectors of the mid-1980s, 
have rebounded, helping to push the overall U.S. economy toward modest growth. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone on Wall Street believes that problems in one area or sector of the 
country will be offset by another. Said economist and unrepentant bear A. Gary 
Shilling: "Some believe that we will have a rolling recession. . . .But the 
many problems may now be rolling downhill into one big snowball." 
</P>
<P>
Even in acknowledged disasters, Yardeni has tended to discern elements of 
promise. For instance, although the deregulation of the financial markets has 
caused vexing problems, he contends that it has also done some good. In the 
past, recessions would often be preceded by a credit crunch, as rising rates 
would draw deposits outside of the banking system. That ceased to be true in 
1980, with the elimination of interest caps. Recent problems notwithstanding, 
credit continues to be available to high-quality borrowers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, American demographics have begun to change, transforming a 
population of young spenders to older savers. That will likely reduce the rate 
of growth in debt, as well as improve funding of existing obligations. Evidence 
of this idea, articulated by Yardeni several years ago, has finally emerged. 
Aggregate U.S. savings began rising in late 1987, reversing a decade's decline. 
</P>
<P>
Industrial management has spread internationally, diluting any one country's 
advantage. The U.S. auto industry is losing market share, but the successful 
Japanese companies are building plants here, and have already begun exporting 
back to Japan, helping the trade deficit. Congress may fight to protect U.S. 
aerospace interests by limiting a cooperative Japanese-American fighter jet 
program, but at the same time Boeing and other foreign companies are striking 
deals to jointly develop new-model planes. 
</P>
<P>
The result, Yardeni said, is that the next century will not belong to any 
country, as eras did in the past. Some countries will begin to save more, 
others spend more, depending on what they require. Trade will expand worldwide, 
and with it worldwide affluence, he said. Adam Smith, from whom Yardeni openly 
borrows, will finally come into his own as global self-interest stimulates a 
pervasive wealth of nations. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be the New Wave century," Yardeni asserted in 1988, and continues to 
believe today. "There won't be one pre-eminent economic superpower. Rather, the 
world will include many highly competitive capitalist economies, all prospering 
together."

ALZHEIMER'S STRUCK MOLLIE KAPLAN WHEN SHE WAS JUST 59 YEARS OLD. IT IS A

Don't sugarcoat this. It ain't easy for any of us. -- Samuel Kaplan 
</P>
<P>
Mollie Kaplan can remember half a century ago when she was 12 and met her 
husband, Samuel, at a Halloween party in the Bronx. She can remember elementary 
school penmanship classes, when she changed her name from the Molly on her 
birth certificate to Mollie because she had a bad habit of writing the "y" 
below the line. 
</P>
<P>
What she can't remember is whether she had breakfast, so sometimes she eats it 
twice. She doesn't cook much anymore, because if the recipe calls for salt, she 
can't remember whether she added it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so frustrating," she said. "I can't read a book anymore, because if I 
stop and put a bookmark where I leave off, when I pick the book up again, I 
don't know what I have read." 
</P>
<P>
Mollie Kaplan is a victim of Alzheimer's disease. But whereas its sufferers 
overwhelmingly are age 65 or older, she was just 59 when she was informed she 
had it. 
</P>
<P>
And as medical science searches for a cure -- or even a method of diagnosis 
other than the exclusion of other possibilities -- more and more attention is 
being paid to those instances where Alzheimer's strikes before 65, especially 
since heredity is believed to play a significant role in such cases. 
</P>
<P>
This disease, which somehow affects the brain cells and produces intellectual 
impairment, is, according to the Alzheimer's Assn., the fourth leading cause of 
death among adults, behind heart disease, cancer and strokes. It takes more 
than 100,000 lives annually in America. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the statistics: 
</P>
<P>
* About 4 million Americans are afflicted with Alzheimer's (actress Rita 
Hayworth was a prominent victim). 
</P>
<P>
* More than 47% of seniors age 85 or older have the illness. 
</P>
<P>
* More than 50% of all nursing home patients are victims of Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
* The financing of care for Alzheimer's patients -- including cost of 
diagnosis, treatment, nursing home care, informal care and lost wages -- is 
estimated to be more than $80 billion per year. 
</P>
<P>
* Finally, from onset of symptoms, the life span of an Alzheimer's victim can 
range from three to 20 or more years. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Braun, executive director of the Los Angeles chapter of 
</P>
<P>
the Alzheimer's Assn., said there are an estimated 650,000 cases of Alzheimer's 
disease in California, probably more than 150,000 of them in Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Only 10% of Alzheimer's patients, according to the national association, are 
classified as early onset (diagnosed before age 65) -- small comfort to someone 
who finds herself in that percentage. 
</P>
<P>
Mollie Kaplan was found to have the ailment three years ago. "I wish it were 
cancer, because cancer you can fight," she said. "I can't do anything about 
this." 
</P>
<P>
For about 30 years, Mollie Kaplan had been a bookkeeper, most recently for a 
certified public accounting firm in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Then about three years ago, strange things began to happen. "Sam and I had 
separate checking accounts. I had my own account so I could buy groceries and 
such. When my monthly statements arrived from the bank, I found I couldn't 
reconcile them. Here I had spent my career keeping books for companies, and now 
I couldn't figure out my own statement." 
</P>
<P>
She said that although her bosses exerted no pressure, she resigned. "I was in 
charge of books for clients, and I was afraid I would start making boo-boos. 
You can't do that with clients." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, her husband recalled, he began to notice small but unusual 
things. There was the afternoon Mollie took a short walk from their Agoura 
Hills home: 
</P>
<P>
"She had taken the garage door opener with her, but didn't remember it. When 
she got back, she thought she had locked herself out. She panicked and phoned 
me at work from a neighbor's house, and I came right home." 
</P>
<P>
Mollie: "If there had been pain -- any degree of it -- it would be so easy to 
tell you. But I felt nothing." 
</P>
<P>
It was about that time that Mollie Kaplan went to a local hospital for 
treatment of an angina attack. While there, she mentioned her increasing 
forgetfulness to her family doctor. "He said that they would do a brain scan. 
It didn't prove anything, except that there were no signs of clots or tumors." 
</P>
<P>
Since Alzheimer's was suspected, there were other tests, although Mollie said 
she doesn't remember them. Sam Kaplan -- while emphasizing that such testing 
shouldn't be done on a person's own -- said one test involved showing Mollie a 
chain, a light and a doorknob, and later asking her to recall what she had been 
shown. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor's conclusion was that she had signs of Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
Sam took his wife to another hospital, where extensive psychiatric, 
neurological and radiological testing -- a full medical workup -- was done. The 
conclusion again: Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted another opinion, and it was suggested that we go to Century City 
Hospital," Sam said. "Not only did they do the other tests, they did Magnetic 
Resonance Imaging. They reached the same conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
From here, the Kaplans don't know where to turn. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing can be done for her," Sam said, staring out the kitchen window. "We 
are learning to live with it." 
</P>
<P>
Mollie said she has no other medical problems, and there has been no recurrence 
of angina. She is on no drug regimen, although she previously participated in a 
pharmaceutical company's experiment with a memory drug. 
</P>
<P>
She is aware of her increasing mental impairment and can recall some instances: 
"I put water in a pot on the stove to boil so Sam would have hot water for 
breakfast. Then I went into the bedroom to make the bed. I got so busy with the 
bed, I completely forgot about the water boiling." 
</P>
<P>
Mollie had given up smoking, but has taken it up again. As she spoke, she went 
around searching for her cigarette lighter, but, unable to remember where it 
was, accepted a match from her husband. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an old Yiddish saying," she began. Then a pause. She had already 
forgotten what she had intended to say. 
</P>
<P>
Alzheimer's always claims two victims -- the other one being the care-giver. "I 
never thought this would happen to me," Sam said, not without emotion. He later 
admitted: "I find myself edgy all the time. I was in the express lane at the 
supermarket. A guy started writing a check, and I almost decked him. 
</P>
<P>
"People say to me, 'join a support group.' I say fine. But what is Mollie 
supposed to do while I am at the group?" 
</P>
<P>
He said he once drove with his wife to such a support group in Thousand Oaks, 
but was told that only he would be permitted in. She said she would drive 
around for an hour and a half, then pick him up. When that time came, she 
couldn't remember the location and had to phone to get specific directions. 
</P>
<P>
Sam said he checked out a day-care center in Thousand Oaks for Alzheimer's 
victims. He found both the appearance and the cost to be satisfactory, and made 
arrangements at the paint store where he is a salesman to cut his workday to 
five hours so he could drop his wife off in the morning and pick her up after 
he finished work. 
</P>
<P>
But so far the point is moot. He drove Mollie over to see the place, he said, 
but she said she didn't like it. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, Mollie retains a disarming sense of humor. When asked about 
anything in the recent past, she often replies, "Who remembers? You are talking 
with an Alzheimer's." 
</P>
<P>
It isn't much of a humorous matter to Sam, now 64, who still loves the woman he 
met half a century ago but wearily confesses: "You don't know what this is like 
until you get there." 
</P>
<P>
Since he worries about her while he is at work (and phones whenever he can find 
the time), he has considered another approach -- an adult live-in. "We went to 
the temples and passed the word around, but it is very difficult to find 
someone." 
</P>
<P>
The Kaplans have an extra bedroom, and they are seeking an older woman who 
would agree to be on the premises without charge in exchange for free housing. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, all Mollie has for daytime companionship is Mandy, a frisky terrier 
the Kaplans rescued from an animal shelter, who likes to chase rubber balls. 
Mollie spends time staring at the photos of her grandchildren, held by magnets 
to the refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
And wondering how this happened. In her case, the illness isn't hereditary; she 
said no one in her family has ever been diagnosed with Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
"My fear for Babe (their pet name for each other) is depression," her husband 
said. "I look for things for her to do. I got her a jigsaw puzzle. I hope 
she'll do it." 
</P>
<P>
Although she didn't in the past, Mollie now watches game shows on television. 
"I feel it is good for my concentration. It helps me psychologically. If I can 
get the answer before the contestant does, I feel I did something good." 
</P>
<P>
Both said the illness has been difficult on their grown daughter and son. On a 
visit to their daughter's house, one of the grandchildren poignantly asked: 
"Grandma, do you still remember us?" 
</P>
<P>
Sam said: "During a visit, it's not the same family discussion it used to be." 
</P>
<P>
If having a sense of humor can cure, there is hope for Mollie. When her husband 
paused to remember their vacation plans, she quipped: "It's catching!" 
</P>
<P>
Since a 100% accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's is possible only by brain 
autopsy, Mollie carries an organ donor card in her purse, hoping that some 
worthwhile research could result from her death. 
</P>
<P>
"Take my head, please," she said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
In an office at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute, geropsychiatrist and 
assistant professor of psychiatry Dr. Gary Small was discussing the $1-million 
study he is overseeing, funded by the national Alzheimer's Assn., the state of 
California and the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
It will focus on people who have or had a parent or sibling diagnosed with 
Alzheimer's and who have anxiety because they themselves are experiencing 
memory changes. 
</P>
<P>
"One part of the puzzle we have an answer to," Small said, "is that if you have 
a close relative with Alzheimer's, your risk for developing the illness is at 
least twice that of the general population." 
</P>
<P>
The psychiatrist said he has some participants already but needs about 100 -- 
including those at risk and having memory changes, and some who aren't -- to 
use as a control group. Participants will get free medical evaluations, MRI 
scan, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan, neurological assessment and 
annual follow-ups to check their progress. 
</P>
<P>
Small said the PET scan, fairly new, is being used in this Alzheimer's research 
because "it has been found to show characteristic patterns of decreased 
metabolism in certain brain regions. . . . This may lead to a positive test for 
the disease." 
</P>
<P>
These characteristic defects, he said, are more striking in early-onset cases 
than in later ones. A PET scan, he continued, may pick up what an MRI scan or 
CT(computerized tomographic) scan shows otherwise to be a normal brain. 
</P>
<P>
"Early-onset cases are more likely to be familial," he explained, "and such 
cases may be more likely to have rapid progression. Research has identified a 
small number of families where there is a high density of Alzheimer's." 
</P>
<P>
Also, he said, researchers are looking into the possibility that Alzheimer's is 
caused by a virus. 
</P>
<P>
Typical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (named after Dr. Alois Alzheimer, a 
German neurologist who described it in 1906) include gradual progression of 
memory loss or other cognitive losses (language problems, motor skills), 
personality change and eventually loss of function. 
</P>
<P>
Personality changes may include hostility, withdrawal, inappropriate laughing, 
agitation and paranoia. 
</P>
<P>
Functionally, Small said, one may forget how to eat, how to use the toilet, how 
to take care of personal hygiene. 
</P>
<P>
But not all signs of forgetfulness mean Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
Small: "As people reach, say, age 50, there may be age-associated memory 
impairment. They will misplace glasses or keys, or have trouble remembering 
names. 
</P>
<P>
"But, generally, they will retrieve that information with effort and over time. 
An Alzheimer's victim may have identical things happen, but as the disease 
progresses, such information can't be retrieved." 
</P>
<P>
What aren't signs? "If you notice mild changes that don't worsen over time, 
then don't worry," Small said. 
</P>
<P>
But when testing is indicated, the process of exclusion is what doctors have to 
work with. Alzheimer's is usually ruled out if there are signs of blood clots 
on the brain; stroke; thyroid, liver or kidney disease; reaction from 
medication, or depression. 
</P>
<P>
Brain autopsies after the death of Alzheimer's victims, Small said, show that 
current clinical diagnosis has an accuracy rate of 90% at the best research 
centers. Such autopsies, he said, show a high concentration of plaques and 
tangles in the brain, instead of normal cells. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Kent, 64, a retired attorney from Southern California, is one of the 
participants in the Small study. Her 71-year-old brother is in a nursing home 
with Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are happening to me that do disturb me," she admitted. "I was recently 
in a Los Angeles courthouse, and in the corridor I ran into a lawyer I have 
known for years. I couldn't remember his name. I thought about it the rest of 
the day, and I still couldn't remember his name. And I still can't. 
</P>
<P>
"I am hoping this has no relationship to Alzheimer's." 
</P>
<P>
Kent said her recent memory changes are something like what her brother, a 
former chemical engineer, went through: "If somebody asks what I did yesterday, 
I have to look at my calendar. 
</P>
<P>
"It weighs on my mind, because as an attorney (she retired four years ago), my 
memory was absolutely fabulous. My mind was like a steel trap." 
</P>
<P>
Kent said she doesn't see her Alzheimer-stricken brother often because he no 
longer recognizes her. When she does visit him, it is because there is always a 
glimmer of hope -- but she winds up seeing it dashed. 
</P>
<P>
There is something else she finds disturbing: "Years ago, my brother would 
stumble over words. I find myself doing that -- like when I might be trying to 
say 'crumb,' I might come up with something such as 'brump.' I mispronounce 
entire words." 
</P>
<P>
Various approaches are being used to deal with the baffling malady. Just two 
months ago, a new Dementia Evaluation Clinic was established here to enable 
geriatricians at two campuses of the Jewish Homes for the Aging of Greater Los 
Angeles to better diagnose the disorder. 
</P>
<P>
Jewish Homes has 875 residents, including those in the 120-bed Amado Foundation 
Alzheimer's Disease Special Care Unit. 
</P>
<P>
"Age-associated memory impairment is neither progressive nor disabling, whereas 
some dementias are both," says a publication of the Alzheimer's Assn. "Dementia 
is not a normal part of aging." 
</P>
<P>
Another association publication advises: "Coping with AD means getting ready 
for a lot of changes. The person you have known as a breadwinner or homemaker, 
as parent or spouse, slowly will lose the ability to fill those roles. At 
times, you may find it hard to recognize that he or she is still the same 
person." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the length of the illness, the association points out, "the effects 
on family finances are likely to be felt for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Another point: "Although it is difficult to think about, you may eventually 
have to place your loved one in a nursing home." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, inside her home in Agoura Hills, Mollie Kaplan can remember way back 
when Sam had to go off and serve in the Navy during World War II, and how he 
gave her an engagement ring before shipping overseas -- "he wanted to make sure 
I wouldn't date other guys." 
</P>
<P>
But if she puts a grocery bag down after returning from the market, she can't 
remember where it is. 
</P>
<P>
"They better hurry up with a cure," she mused. "The clock's running out on me."

QUIGLEY'S REIGN AS QUEEN OF CHARTS; 
</P>
<P>
BOOKS: THE REAGANS' ASTROLOGER CLAIMS SHE WAS THE GREAT PROGNOSTICATOR TO THE 
GREAT COMMUNICATOR.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joan Quigley cuts a handsome figure as she nibbles on fruit salad in a 
restaurant at the stately Fairmont Hotel, but if anyone else recognizes her as 
the person who claims to have put the Teflon in the "Teflon Presidency," they 
are keeping it to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The other diners are unaware of the celebrity in their midst, the woman who 
says she made the Great Communicator great and single-handedly made a lovable 
First Lady out of a Dragon Lady. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps they have forgotten her. Since she entered the limelight in 1988, when 
former White House chief of staff Donald T. Regan broke the news that Nancy 
Reagan employed an astrologer, Quigley herself has had little to say. 
</P>
<P>
But now, after all those tasteful, loyal years of silence, Quigley has dashed 
off a book in which she details her job as court astrologer in the Reagan White 
House -- an unusual form of civil service that Quigley says made her as 
important to Ronald Reagan as his wife Nancy when it came to making the 40th 
President a diplomatic dynamo. 
</P>
<P>
"In a different way," she explains modestly. "Each person did their own job and 
own function. Nancy knew what she had in me. I don't think she ever wanted to 
admit it. I think she would have preferred for me never to be heard from 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Just out from Birch Lane Press, "What Does Joan Say?" in its title refers to 
the plea Quigley says the President put to his wife during the depths of the 
Iran-Contra affair -- a nasty scandal, by the way, that Quigley asserts she 
foresaw, but could not forestall. 
</P>
<P>
Quigley wrote the book in six weeks, two weeks in a suite at the Fairmont, 
which is less than a block from the Nob Hill apartment she shares with her 
sister, and four more weeks in the home of an unnamed friend. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not angry," she says. "I just wanted to give my version of what happened 
and explain what astrology really was. It was really very hurtful when I 
realized (after Regan's revelations ignited such an uproar) in 1988 -- maybe I 
was living in an ivory tower -- that it was perceived as being on the edge of 
the lunatic fringe." 
</P>
<P>
In her book, the matronly San Francisco astrologer writes that in the Reagan 
White House, she decided when it was time to talk to the public, when to talk 
to the press and when not to talk at all. 
</P>
<P>
According to Quigley, she told the President through his wife when to take off 
in Air Force One and when to land; when to name a Supreme Court justice and 
when to lobby Congress; when to campaign and when to debate. 
</P>
<P>
She writes that she said when the President should undergo surgery and when the 
First Lady should go in for a checkup; when superpower summits took place and 
even what issues they should cover. 
</P>
<P>
She said the time was ripe for world peace. 
</P>
<P>
And that is just the first chapter. 
</P>
<P>
Contemporary news accounts do not always match her versions of events. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Reagan has flatly said that astrology played no role in negotiating the 
Intermediate-range Nuclear Force Treaty, as Quigley claims, and he has said 
that "no changes were ever made" in his schedule because of astrology. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Reagan, in her book "My Turn," dismissed speculation about the political 
role that may have been played by her personal astrologer. "Joan's 
recommendations had nothing to do with policy or politics -- ever," she wrote, 
italicizing the passage for emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
Even Regan, after he first revealed the presence of a presidential astrologer 
in his book "For the Record," said that the stargazer's role was limited to 
scheduling some events to ease Nancy's fear of a second assassination attempt 
against her husband. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm simply telling what happened from my point of view," Quigley responds in a 
matter-of-fact tone. "I have told the truth. I can't be tripped up (with the 
contrary recollections of others) because I told the truth." 
</P>
<P>
Quigley asserts that she began casting and interpreting astrological charts for 
both Reagans in 1973. Nancy Reagan, in her memoirs, said only that "Merv 
(Griffin) had apparently introduced us (sometime after Quigley began appearing 
on his show), although I don't remember meeting her." 
</P>
<P>
Quigley also writes that she worked on Reagan's unsuccessful 1976 effort to win 
the Republican presidential nomination, although she concedes over lunch that, 
"I can't remember quite what I did." 
</P>
<P>
She does recall returning as a volunteer astrologer for Reagan's triumphant 
1980 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Reagan began to pay Quigley for her services in 1981, after President 
Reagan was shot. In a phone conversation with Griffin, Nancy Reagan was told 
that Quigley had predicted such a calamity. Mrs. Reagan then renewed her 
relationship with the astrologer, asking her to predict the safety of future 
presidential excursions. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Quigley profferred advice only on the safest time to schedule a 
presidential trip. Quickly, however, Quigley claims, her cosmic counsel was 
solicited for an astounding number of subjects, from the First Lady's public 
image (Quigley says she made it better) to Walter Mondale's election hopes 
(Quigley says she made them worse). 
</P>
<P>
Quigley says that she remade Nancy Reagan's public image during the Reagans' 
early years in the White House, that she defused the controversy when the 
Reagans toured a German cemetery with Nazi SS graves, that she paved the way 
for political reform in Eastern Europe by getting "Ronnie," as she calls the 
President, to ease up on Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev (whose charts she also 
cast). 
</P>
<P>
Quigley adds -- contrary to Nancy Reagan's book and news reports at the time -- 
that she persuaded the Reagans to delay the President's 1985 cancer surgery 
because the stars were not right. 
</P>
<P>
"I would participate (in the Reagan Administration) in a more intimate way than 
the publicly recognized insiders of greatest importance," Quigley writes, 
adding in another chapter that "I was the Teflon in what came to be known for 
the better part of six years as the 'Teflon Presidency.' " 
</P>
<P>
According to her book, Quigley never "suggested," "recommended" or even 
"advised" the timing of presidential appointments. No, the book tells us, she 
"allowed" the President and First Lady to go places, see people or say things. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Reagan made the relationship sound significantly less vital. "While 
astrology was a factor in determining Ronnie's schedule," she wrote in her 
book, "it was never the only one, and no political decision was ever based on 
it." 
</P>
<P>
It was Nancy Reagan's book, apparently not giving Quigley the credit she 
thought she deserved, that prompted her to write her own version of events and 
also to defend astrology. Quigley says she refused pleas to do so after Regan's 
book came out in May, 1988. "I did not want to damage a sitting President or 
the next Republican to run for office," she explains. "I'm only doing it now 
because I feel it's appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
And, she adds, because Nancy's book "reads like fiction." 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Reagan declines to comment on Quigley's book. Everything she has to say 
about Joan Quigley is in her own book, Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
In "My Turn," Nancy Reagan described Quigley in various passages as warm, 
sympathetic and compassionate. Quigley does not return the warmth. 
</P>
<P>
"Once I had succeeded in reforming her image, she basked in the glow for a 
time," Quigley writes of Nancy Reagan. "Then further ambition took over. She 
realized that she was a power in her own right. She devoted herself tirelessly 
to promoting her own interests. . . . Gradually, her desire to back Ronnie from 
behind the scenes diminished. She wished to be a political power openly." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Quigley says that she and Nancy haven't swapped pleasantries 
or predictions for more than a year and a half. Their last conversation was in 
June, 1988, shortly after Quigley's chart casting made news. 
</P>
<P>
Does it bother her that she and Nancy are no longer close? 
</P>
<P>
"I think she has lost out, because when I was controlling her image it was a 
great deal better," Quigley says without hesitation. "I really frankly feel it 
has deteriorated terribly in the last couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
Quigley's book never spells out her relationship to the President. How much of 
her advice was actually passed on to him by his wife? How much, if any, did he 
listen to? Perhaps she does not know herself. She has met him only once, 
briefly, in the receiving line at a state dinner. 
</P>
<P>
She writes throughout the book of Reagan's "tremendous vitality and almost 
superhuman strength," of his "perfect integrity" and "utmost will power," of 
his "almost magical inner will," of how he is "fearless" and of how his 
horoscope "makes a person feel his sexual powers . . . come from God." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's horoscope, she writes, preordained him as a leader and peacemaker, 
just as the stars made a legend of another notable Aquarian, Abraham Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Now that he is out of office, will President Reagan acknowledge a belief in 
astrology in his memoirs? 
</P>
<P>
"I think he probably won't because he's denied it," Quigley says. "I can see 
why he would want to deny it when they were in office because of the public 
perception of astrology being so negative. Although I must say that if I had 
been handling it for the Reagans, people would have been coming out saying, 'If 
the President doesn't have an astrologer, why doesn't he?' Really, I would have 
handled it differently from the way they handled it. I feel they handled it 
very badly, and they still are." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HERE'S WHAT JOAN QUIGLEY SAYS 
</P>
<P>
On becoming the first White House astrologer: "I knew that if I decided to take 
the Reagans on, I would be giving up my time and effort like all those who take 
part in any administration, sacrificing the rewards they command in the private 
sector in order to serve their country." 
</P>
<P>
On working with Nancy: "She trusted me completely and followed my advice 
absolutely. Yet, as we worked, she combined her areas of knowledge and her 
usually excellent political judgment with my astrological expertise. The 
combination was for a time unbeatable." 
</P>
<P>
On presidential travel: "My control over the departure times of Air Force One 
was absolute." 
</P>
<P>
On presidential surgery: "It is because of me that the operation was successful 
and that there was no recurrence of cancer between July, 1985, and President 
Reagan's departure from office." 
</P>
<P>
On the President's staff: "In the beginning, Nancy would relay the information 
I gave her to Mike Deaver, who was very good about seeing to it that what I 
wanted was done. Later, she relayed my instructions concerning the President's 
schedule to Donald Regan, who, while he cooperated, resented what Mike Deaver 
had always expedited routinely without question. Howard Baker had no problem 
with astrology, and I was never told that he objected to anything Nancy and I 
had planned." 
</P>
<P>
On Gorbachev: "What I saw in his chart turned out to be glasnost and 
perestroika." 
</P>
<P>
On the Geneva Summit: "I briefed the President through Nancy for every meeting 
with Gorbachev in Geneva. I also tried to brief her for her teas alone with 
Raisa which I knew in advance would not be harmonious." 
</P>
<P>
On the Rekjavik Summit: "The President had asked Nancy to ask me about going to 
Rekjavik; he and (Secretary of State George) Schultz followed my advice to 
negotiate there as long and hard as possible, and, following my advice, they 
stayed longer than planned." 
</P>
<P>
On presidential oratory: "Everyone, even the smoothest, silver-tongued orator 
has off-moments. . . . Until I took over the task of guarding President 
Reagan's tongue by astrology, he had a tendency to come out not unfrequently 
with real bloopers and other remarks better left unsaid." 
</P>
<P>
On Nancy's image: "I recreated Nancy's image. . . . I was amused to learn when 
I was watching the 1988 Republican Convention on television that someone had 
been putting about the rumor that Michael Deaver had been the architect of 
Nancy's image. That her image had had to have an architect was, of course, 
obvious to everyone." 
</P>
<P>
On Congress: "If a member of Congress occupied a pivotal position and could 
swing a vote or add his vote or persuade others to pass a bill the President 
wanted, I was called upon." 
</P>
<P>
On visiting Nazi graves: "I planned that the visit to the Bitburg cemetery 
would be as inconspicuous as possible. . . . The only difficulty was that 
someone had planned for the Reagans to have an hourlong picnic with the 
villagers at Bitburg, which I said was absolutely out of the question as it 
made Bitburg far too important and called attention to something I thought 
should be glossed over rapidly." 
</P>
<P>
On presidential knowledge: "There is no doubt whatsoever in my mind that the 
President was fully aware of the contribution I made, the scheduling, my ideas, 
the problems I solved and the advice I gave." 
</P>
<P>
The last advice I ever gave Nancy: "Go to Moscow if you will . . . but for 
God's sake don't sign anything of importance at 2 p.m. on June 1 in Moscow. I'm 
warning you, signing anything of importance at that time is 'Roosevelt at 
Yalta' stuff."

ALICE KAHN: WHAT'S YUP? READING ALL ABOUT SAVING THE EARTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICE KAHN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Earth Day's a-comin', and I can hardly wait. Scratch a yuppie these days and 
you'll find a greenie. 
</P>
<P>
I'm greening as fast as I can. I've read -- this is for real -- "100 Ways to 
Save the Earth," "750 Everyday Ways You Can Help Clean Up the Earth" and "The 
Solution to Pollution: 101 Things You Can Do to Clean Up Your Environment." Not 
to mention the by-now classic "50 Simple Things You Can Do to Save the Earth," 
</P>
<P>
I've already started drinking out of a mug instead of a plastic cup. That 
leaves me with only another 1,000 things to do. 
</P>
<P>
My husband read that you can help save Earth by snipping the plastic rings that 
come with six-packs of beer. He's trying to drink at least one six-pack a day 
to help save the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
But he's developed a bad case of Ecologist's Thumb from trying to rip the 
plastic rings apart. 
</P>
<P>
When Earth Day comes, I'm going to send him to the store to shop for a better 
world. I think I'll just stay in bed with a pint of Ben and Jerry's Rainforest 
Crunch and a good book. 
</P>
<P>
But what to choose from with so many good books from so many good authors 
pointing to so many good deeds? With 70-plus new titles coming out in time for 
Earth Day, even best-selling authors are becoming greenies. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a rundown on new fiction to save the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Danielle Steel has a new line of children's ecology books. A sample from 
"Melissa Pitches In": 
</P>
<P>
 Melissa came skipping up the steps of the mansion. "Mama, mama, did I get into 
Miss Giles'?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No," I told her, "but there are lots of good kindergartens. Now, tell Nanny 
to start your shower. But don't let it run for more than five minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Anne Rice, the gal with the ghouls, has a new book with an ecology theme, 
"Vegetarian Vampire." I love the opening line: 
</P>
<P>
 She started to eat so low on the food chain that she began sucking blood from 
a turnip. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone's talking about Philip Roth's new eco-love story written in the form 
of a dialogue between two people: 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the way you make love to me." 
</P>
<P>
 "Paper or plastic?" 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband saw your wife today with your wife's lover." 
</P>
<P>
 "Paper or plastic?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Philip, are we talking condoms?" 
</P>
<P>
 The best-selling team that writes under the pseudonym Judith Michael is just 
out with "A Ruling Passion to Save Our Planet." It's about a poor girl who's 
jealous of her friend's rich husband, so she steals him away and moves into his 
estate. Then he leaves her. She has to start over again with nothing but her 
hair spray, which she discards, vowing: 
</P>
<P>
 "As God as my witness, I'll never deplete the ozone again." 
</P>
<P>
Amy Tan is due out with another book of tales of a girl growing up in modern 
Chinatown: 
</P>
<P>
 Once a week the women would meet to play mah-jongg and talk of their joy, 
their sorrow and how putting a displacement bag in the tank can save you one to 
two gallons per flush. 
</P>
<P>
 And young Tama Janowitz is on the comeback trail with another coming-of-age 
novel. In it, she describes the lifestyle that seems to characterize urban 
youth in the '90s: 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone at the party was doing Coke. But they were recycling the cans. 
</P>
<P>
 It's wonderful that people are starting to sense the urgency of the need to 
read about how to save the planet. So many books, so little time.

'DETOX CENTERS' FOR 'ELECTRICAL ABUSE'? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article on use of electrical stimulation to relax seemed too good to be 
true. Maybe it is ("Getting Wired for Relaxation," March 6). 
</P>
<P>
A couple of questions come to mind. What does electrical stimulation 
chronically do to the body? Will we be developing a generation of electrical 
junkies who require a 20-minute zap to feel their best? Already, one week after 
Cloris Leachman purchased an Alpha-Stim unit, she "won't leave home without" 
it. Will there be a rebound loss in one's normal alpha state when the 
artificial stimulation is discontinued? 
</P>
<P>
Please note that the units are FDA approved for pain relief, not relaxation. 
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, these questions will be answered before usage becomes commonplace. I 
can already envision commercials for detox centers to treat electrical abuse.

I absolutely hate that narrow-minded men such as Roger Simon totally 
misunderstand the reasons why Elizabeth Morgan chose to protect her child from 
the child's father even to the lengths that she was willing to spend two years 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Please, Mr. Simon, open your mind to the fact that there are fathers who 
sexually abuse their daughters, and there are judges, prosecutors and 
editorialists who simply can't believe this horror is happening. God help the 
children of this country who aren't being protected.

"Clean, simple and pure?" Well, they are as simple as a flour sack with a hole

And people will pay hundreds of dollars for a back and front that I would whip

I used to model, and I would not be caught dead in one of these. Methinks the

clothes that are more graceful, more colorful and (made of) more interesting 
material than we do. But few more expensive.

Roger Simon assumes that because a court cannot prove child molestation that 
none existed. 
</P>
<P>
We all have heard of our imperfect court system. Known murderers are walking 
our streets due to plea-bargaining or suppression of sufficient evidence to win 
a prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Child-molesters are released to continue to molest our children. 
</P>
<P>
It is the parent's moral duty to protect the child. That this could be at odds 
with a court decision is unfortunate and, yes, could cause illegal acts. 
</P>
<P>
Simon does not address the dilemma our courts and society are debating 
regarding the child-molestation problem. He chose to malign the tragic 
characters and thus does us all a disservice.

ONLY 3 MENTIONS IN THE BIBLE, BUT SUCH AN INFLUENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The word kosher, meaning fit or proper, appears in the Bible only three times, 
and then not in connection with food. 
</P>
<P>
But it has come to stand for a complex of Jewish law and tradition that governs 
the eating habits of as many as 50,000 Jews in Los Angeles and 1.5 million Jews 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Encyclopedia Judaica, the rules allow for consumption of all 
fruits and vegetables. This is based on a verse in Genesis 1:29: "Behold, I 
have given you every herb yielding seed which is upon the face of the earth, 
and every tree." 
</P>
<P>
Then it gets complicated. 
</P>
<P>
Although fruits and vegetables may be eaten with meat or milk, meat must not be 
mixed with milk or other dairy products. Only the meat of animals that chew 
their cud and have cloven hoofs may be eaten. 
</P>
<P>
Acceptable birds are generally limited to pigeon, dove, chicken, quail, 
partridge, peacock, pheasant, house sparrow, and domestic goose and duck. 
</P>
<P>
Fish with fins and scales are acceptable. Shark, catfish and eel are out, but 
swordfish and sturgeon are a matter of debate. 
</P>
<P>
Insects are banned, but honey is OK. 
</P>
<P>
No one but a specially trained shokhet can actually slaughter cattle and birds. 
The shokhet uses a knife to kill the animal, then checks to make sure the 
animal does not exhibit any of eight categories of defects that would otherwise 
have led to its death within one year. 
</P>
<P>
The meat is hung up and salted to remove as much blood is possible. 
</P>
<P>
Certain portions of clean animals are also forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
Strictly observant Jews will wait up to six hours after a meat meal before they 
will eat dairy products. Kosher homes have separate sets of dishes and 
silverware for milk and meat foods. 
</P>
<P>
The Bible implies that the dietary laws have to do with holiness, but it gives 
no real explanation of them. 
</P>
<P>
Ancient sages and modern scholars have advanced various reasons for the laws. 
These include their moral effect and hygienic explanations. 
</P>
<P>
"These ordinances seek to train us in the mastery of our appetites," wrote 
Maimonides, a 12th-Century rabbi, physician and philosopher. 
</P>
<P>
"They accustom us to restrain both the growth of desire and the disposition to 
consider the pleasure of eating as the end of man's existence." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Maimonides argued that the forbidden foods are also 
unhealthy. MATHIS CHAZANOV

individually, each of these foods are kosher, and fruit and vegetables may be 
eaten with anything. But milk can never be served with chicken.

BIG SPENDER IN CERRITOS CAMPAIGN DRAWS CRITICISM;

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A candidate for City Council, who moved to Cerritos within the last year, has 
raised $96,000 -- almost double the total raised by the other 12 contenders in 
the April 10 election. 
</P>
<P>
Charles J. Kim, 34, a newspaper columnist and political consultant, opened a 
campaign office last July, shortly after moving from neighboring Artesia. He 
has at least one full-time campaign staffer and a direct-mail consultant on his 
payroll. 
</P>
<P>
Kim, who said he would be the only Korean-American city councilman in the state 
if elected, also has made extensive use of computers to identify Korean voters 
in the city.

"When I decided to run I decided to run to win," he said. "I didn't decide to 
run to have fun." 
</P>
<P>
His fund-raising prowess, combined with his arrival in the city just last year, 
has raised the hackles of most of the other candidates and generated charges 
that he is a carpetbagger. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you can buy an election from the people of Cerritos, you have to 
earn it," said Sherman Kappe, a planning commissioner who is making his second 
bid for a council seat. Kappe has raised $7,346. Mayor Diana Needham, who is 
not seeking reelection, described Kim's fund-raising effort as overkill. 
</P>
<P>
The most any other candidate in the current campaign has raised is about 
$16,300. Officials said the most successful fund-raising effort in previous 
council elections generated about $32,000. 
</P>
<P>
Kim said those complaining about the size of his campaign treasury are jealous. 
"They want to raise the money but they can't," he said. He pointed out that 
some candidates lent their own money to their campaigns, indicating that they 
do not enjoy the same degree of support he does. 
</P>
<P>
Kim acknowledged that his campaign support comes largely from the Southland's 
Korean community, which he said is anxious to become more involved in politics. 
</P>
<P>
The stakes in the Cerritos City Council election are particularly high this 
year because three of the five seats are open, and two veteran incumbents -- 
Mayor Needham and Councilman Barry Rabbitt -- are barred from running. Rabbitt 
and Needham had to bow out after a court ruling upheld Proposition H -- the 
referendum voters adopted two years ago to limit council members to two 
consecutive terms. Needham served 12 years on the council, and Rabbitt served 
20 years. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the council makeup could change dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
Kim said he considers Cerritos the perfect place to launch a political career. 
With an Asian population of at least 30% and a black population of about 10%, 
Cerritos is known as one of the most ethnically diverse cities in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign funding reports filed with the city clerk show that the overwhelming 
majority of Kim's contributors are Koreans who do not live in Cerritos -- 
adding further fuel to the charge that he is a carpetbagger. 
</P>
<P>
During the most recent reporting period -- Jan. 1 to Feb. 24 -- Kim raised 
$48,345 from 179 people who contributed $100 or more. Only nine of the 
contributors have Cerritos addresses. 
</P>
<P>
Kim pointed out, however, that he has been active in Cerritos. His mother and 
his two brothers live here, he said, and he has been a Sunday school teacher 
and a choir leader at the local Presbyterian Church for years. 
</P>
<P>
"I've spent a lot of money," said Kim, "on reaching out to potential 
Korean-American voters (not registered to vote)." He said about 500 new voters 
have been registered through his efforts. Cerritos has about 24,500 voters and 
27.3%, or 6,711 voters, went to the polls in the 1988 City Council election. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to sell my ideas and programs to the voters in Cerritos," Kim 
said, listing a number of issues he thinks are important -- crime, gangs, 
senior citizen programs, earthquake preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
Kim, former executive director of the Korean American Coalition in Los Angeles, 
came to the United States with his family in 1976. He served in the U.S. Army, 
earned a degree in political science from USC, worked with Korean community 
groups and helped run various political campaigns, including one unsuccessful 
campaign for Los Angeles City Council. He writes a column for a Korean daily 
newspaper and hosts a Korean radio talk show. 
</P>
<P>
Council candidate Marshall H. Story, referring to Kim's campaign treasury, said 
Kim "apparently doesn't understand the system. If he's got that kind of 
fund-raising mechanism, he ought to run for Congress or the state Legislature." 
Story is a 53-year-old lead mechanic for Trans World Airlines and an active 
Democrat who has twice tried to win a seat in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Kim's campaign signs have begun to spring up throughout the city, prompting 
opponent Kappe to complain: "He's littering chain-link fences. They're at gas 
stations." 
</P>
<P>
Another candidate, George Marsh, said: "It's way too much for a candidate to 
spend on a City Council election." Marsh is a real estate manager and former 
Bellflower councilman who now lives in Cerritos and is making his second bid 
for a council seat here. 
</P>
<P>
"You can almost send everybody money in the mail for that," said candidate 
Faith Peckham, a small-business owner who ran unsuccessfully for a council seat 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Former City Councilman Alex Beanum said Kim's fund-raising "changes the whole 
scheme of the local election, that's the thing that bothers me. It takes on the 
aura of being big-time politics rather than local grass-roots type of 
representation." Beanum, an engineer, is trying to recapture the seat he lost 
four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ann B. Joynt, the only incumbent up for reelection, said she does 
not want to say anything negative about Kim's spending. However, Joynt, like 
several other candidates, questioned whether big spending in a local election 
can win it for a newcomer. 
</P>
<P>
Joynt, for example, taught in local high schools for years before she ran for 
office. Perry N. Barit, a 52-year-old Cerritos architect making his second bid 
for a council seat, is on the city's Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"To be electable you must have paid your dues in the community," said Barit, a 
past president of the Optimist Club. 
</P>
<P>
The other planning commissioner in the race, Kappe, who has owned and managed 
property in the city for years, said: "It's how you interact with people over a 
long period of time that determines who wins elections in Cerritos." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Rabbitt, also barred from seeking another term, said: "I believe the 
people of Cerritos will be outraged at that . . . amount of dollars being 
raised by people outside the community in order to influence the outcome of an 
election." 
</P>
<P>
Rabbitt is supporting John Crawley, a candidate with the kind of credentials 
that usually prove impeccable in Cerritos elections. Crawley is president of 
the Optimist Club, a member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, a senior financial 
analyst for the Atlantic Richfield Corp., and has coached youth baseball and 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Kim, on the other hand, belongs to the new Cerritos, which council candidate 
Story says is "getting to be the south Monterey Park," a reference to the 
increasing Asian population in Cerritos. South Monterey Park is more than 50% 
Asian. 
</P>
<P>
Other candidates seeking City Council seats are Michael C. Cosgrove, who owns a 
dry-cleaning business; Michael Kerr, a hospital administrator; Mansour Meisami, 
who works for the federal government, and Jim Hsieh, 52, who owns a machine 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
Hsieh, who has raised the second-highest campaign treasury -- about $16,300 -- 
declined to comment on Kim's spending. "I condemn anyone who runs a negative 
campaign," Hsieh said.

TOXIC WASTE COULD COST FIRM $162,000

<P>
A national construction company was ordered Thursday by a Los Angeles Superior 
Court judge to pay cleanup costs and fines that could top $162,000 for burying 
up to 50 barrels containing toxic residue at its former branch in Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
Kiewit Pacific Co. pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of unlawful 
disposal of hazardous waste and must pay for removal and cleanup costs at the 
five-acre site, Deputy Dist. Atty. Bill Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
Judge William Klausner fined the Nebraska-based company $50,000 plus $12,000 in 
restitution to the property's current owner, the Arcadia Redevelopment Agency, 
and placed Kiewit on a year's probation. 
</P>
<P>
The agency bought the parcel at 301 E. Santa Clara St. in September, 1986, when 
Kiewit moved its offices to Santa Fe Springs. The flattened drums with traces 
of a cement curing compound were discovered last March, when the agency began 
excavating the site for development. The slurry-like material, used to set 
cement, is mildly toxic and contains flammable solvents, Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of disposing of the barrels and removing the contaminated soil that 
surrounded them will exceed $100,000, said Shahin Nourishad, the county Health 
Services Department's hazardous materials specialist who is supervising the 
cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the firm's first run-in with the department. 
</P>
<P>
Employees buried between 35 to 50 barrels of the same compound and waste oil in 
1981, Carter said. Workers in an office across the street reported the activity 
and the health department ordered the company to dig up the barrels. 
</P>
<P>
The second burial -- in 1985 -- occurred before dawn, Carter said. Using 
bulldozers already on the site, "they dug a huge hole in the same location, 
pushed the barrels in and covered them with dirt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The employee responsible had probably misunderstood an order to clean up the 
yard, Kiewit attorney Stephen Sadowsky said. "He was acting without company 
knowledge and approval," Sadowsky said.

SOUTH EL MONTE SHOWING SIGNS OF ELECTION ACTIVITY;

TIME IN THIS TINY CITY MEANS LAWN SIGNS, TIGHT BUDGETS AND DOOR-TO-DOOR

<P>
It's blossom time in South El Monte. From the mobile homes on Rush Street to 
stucco cottages along Cogswell Road and Merced Avenue, front lawns are blooming 
with bright new colors. Mostly the colors are red or psychedelic orange or 
bright blue. Eye-catching colors. Colors to broadcast the name of a political 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing is to get your name out there," says Ignacio (Slim) Gracia, a 
city councilman running for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
He's talking about lawn signs, of course. On Michael Hunt Drive, he pulls his 
car over to the curb and frowns at some of his own signs. They have been 
stapled to pickets and pounded into the grass, and they appear warped and 
faded. "The rain didn't do much good to our signs," he says. 
</P>
<P>
It's happening all over the San Gabriel Valley. The volunteers are out, 
knocking on doors, talking up the candidates, planting their colorful lawn 
signs. They're getting the names out. Twenty San Gabriel Valley cities will 
hold City Council elections April 10, with 137 candidates vying for 56 council 
or mayoral seats. 
</P>
<P>
"This is where politics starts," says Chuck Bush, a house painter to whom 
Gracia has just appealed for support. 
</P>
<P>
Bush means his own living room, where he and his wife, Judy, have been 
interrupted in the middle of their dinner by the arrival of Gracia, a reporter 
and a photographer. 
</P>
<P>
Big city candidates can have their media consultants, polling experts and 
television campaigns, suggests Bush, straightening his paint-spattered T-shirt 
and settling into a straight-backed chair. In towns like South El Monte, 
campaigns are conducted on front lawns and in people's living rooms. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever goes on in a big city, the little person doesn't get to know about 
it," says Bush, who is active in South El Monte's civic affairs. "Here, 
everybody knows." 
</P>
<P>
The buzz these days in South El Monte, a tiny industrial city of 19,000 wedged 
between the San Gabriel River and the Rio Hondo, is about redevelopment and a 
trash-hauling franchise. 
</P>
<P>
As with most of the region's cities, the political temperament is volcanic. 
There are long periods of dormancy, with a drop-off in voter interest, then 
something explodes. Suddenly, the voters are fretting about the way their tax 
dollars are being spent or about rapid changes in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
People start talking about recall campaigns or grass-roots ballot initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been 10 full years without a recall," marvels Jim Kelly, a 12-year 
council veteran who is running for reelection. "I can remember two periods when 
there were just three of us on the council because the other two had been 
recalled." 
</P>
<P>
The voter turnout for municipal elections in South El Monte has been falling 
precipitously in recent years, from 38% in 1984 to 31% in 1986 to less than 25% 
in 1988. There are 4,843 registered voters in the city. Its council members are 
paid $375 a month, plus expenses. 
</P>
<P>
But South El Monte is showing signs that it's coming out of its dormancy. As 
four candidates go after two council seats, a dissident group is revving up a 
parallel campaign. The critics want to recall Mayor Albert Perez, Vice Mayor 
Stanley Quintana and Councilman Art Olmos, charging them with a broad array of 
abuses, from "cronyism" in granting an exclusive franchise to a local trash 
hauler to "wastefulness" in giving the city manager a raise. 
</P>
<P>
The three have responded with annoyance. Perez, for example, dismisses the 
charges as "frivolous" and "trumped up." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the council campaign -- in which a retired salesman, a truck driver, a 
drug program coordinator and a Caltrans maintenance worker are vying for two 
council seats -- has been relatively tame. 
</P>
<P>
But for the incumbents, the issues raised in the recall campaign seem to loom 
menacingly. 
</P>
<P>
Both Kelly and Gracia say that they were against the widely criticized trash 
franchise granted to Modern Service Co. (both abstained in the council vote), 
and they are taking pains to distance themselves from a controversial 
redevelopment program, with an eminent domain provision, approved by the 
council last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'I'll look into it,' " says Kelly, 59, a dairy trucker, about the 
redevelopment project, which he voted for. "Then I said I'd support it. But 
after I studied and learned about it, I finally made up my mind. Last October, 
I decided this is not what the city of South El Monte needs." 
</P>
<P>
Gracia is also giving "serious thought" to the project. "I voted for the 
concept," says Gracia, 71, a former salesman who recently came out of 
retirement to help a friend reorganize his law practice. "Since then, I've had 
second thoughts." 
</P>
<P>
The challengers, Arthur Jimenez and Raul Pardo, have been circling 
respectfully, exploiting a vague feeling of malaise that seems to permeate the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
South El Monte is a largely Latino city -- about 80% of its residents have 
Spanish surnames -- that has been indelibly marked by an unusual laissez-faire 
fiscal structure. With no city property taxes, utility taxes or business 
license fees, large numbers of businesses have settled in the city. In fact, 
there is one business for every 15 residents, city statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
But the policies have also strapped the city for operating funds, while 
bringing in an impoverished immigrant population of entry-level workers. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a Chicago urbanologist ranked the city as the 15th poorest suburb in 
the United States. Cities such as South El Monte, with its per capita income of 
$7,100, represent "the American nightmare," said Roosevelt University professor 
Pierre deVise. 
</P>
<P>
City officials responded bitterly that they were being maligned, pointing to 
South El Monte's ample middle-class neighborhoods with neat, attractive homes. 
</P>
<P>
But some residents see worrisome signs of deterioration, like graffiti and gang 
incidents. "This has never been one of the nicer areas," says Mike Dieguez, 
standing at the door of his house on Durfee Avenue. "But we never had problems 
with people." 
</P>
<P>
After some break-ins on his block and the appearance of graffiti, the area 
"seems to be getting a little worse," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates have had to answer such challenges by carrying their messages 
directly to the voters, addressing them in doorways or meeting rooms. 
</P>
<P>
The record for spending on a council campaign in the San Gabriel Valley was, by 
most accounts, the $85,000 dished out in 1985 by Margaret Sedenquist in an 
unsuccessful run for the Pasadena Board of Directors. None of the South El 
Monte candidates plan to spend more than $5,000, giving them barely enough for 
signs, pamphlets and a mailer. 
</P>
<P>
That means a lot of knocking on doors and pumping hands. 
</P>
<P>
Pardo, 30, a drug program coordinator at UC Irvine, seems especially energetic. 
A short, earnest man with a neatly clipped beard, he draws people out of their 
houses with his direct approach. "I grew up here, right down the street," he 
tells one woman through a screen door, "and I understand some of the pressures 
that people are feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Pardo contends that no one on the council is "looking at the bigger picture." 
He proposes, among other things, to involve the business community in social 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Business is getting involved at the level of supporting Little League, but 
that's not enough," says Pardo, who has been circulating mail ballot 
applications to ensure that his supporters' votes will be registered. 
</P>
<P>
Jimenez, 57, a Caltrans worker who has long been active on city commissions, 
stresses the need for "a new face" on the council. A friendly man with muscular 
shoulders and a broad forehead, Jimenez proposes that the city finance another 
sheriff's radio car to patrol city streets. Where will the money come from? 
"Once I get into office, I'll be able to tell you," he says. 
</P>
<P>
After years of helping neighbors solve such problems as flooded drains and 
neighborhood intruders, Jimenez is at ease approaching them for support. "It's 
just myself, running on my own," he says, emphasizing his freedom from "cliques 
and special interests." 
</P>
<P>
The two incumbents, each with three successful campaigns behind him, appear 
more relaxed than the challengers. But appearances can be deceptive, they both 
say. "You always worry" about an election, says Gracia, 71, a fatherly, 
white-haired man who is no longer as slim as he was when he acquired the 
nickname. "People know me out here, but you can't let down your guard." 
</P>
<P>
Gracia talks often about his long association with the city -- "This was all 
strawberries and onions right here," he reminisces, driving through a housing 
tract -- and his big family. He has 12 grown children, including two sons who 
are sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly, the only non-Latino on the council, boasts of his fiscal conservatism 
and his involvement in philanthropic activities. "I'm the watchdog of the 
city's finances," says Kelly, 59, a fast-talking, bustling man ("He spends half 
his life on the phone," says his wife, Margaret) with swept-back white hair. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he also wants to squeeze another sheriff's "black-and-white" out 
of the city budget. "We definitely need a lot more law enforcement," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The voters tend to view South El Monte's politics with good-natured skepticism, 
particularly when they note that the recall campaign is starting in the midst 
of an election drive. 
</P>
<P>
"It's vote 'em in and throw 'em out," says Robert Garcia, an air-conditioning 
repairman who has stepped out of his house on a cul-de-sac near the Pomona 
Freeway to chat with Jimenez. 
</P>
<P>
His wife comes out to bring him a jacket, and he chats for a while in the 
chilly evening air about how South El Monte has changed. "This used to be a 
hell of a place for business," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Then Garcia shakes hands with Jimenez. "Good luck," he says amiably. "Don't get 
impeached." 
</P>

COASTAL PANEL JOINS MARINA PLACE BATTLE; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: THE COASTAL COMMISSION AGREES TO FILE A FRIEND-OF-THE-COURT BRIEF 
IN A LAWSUIT TO STOP THE $159-MILLION MALL PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
A struggle between Los Angeles and Culver City over the plans for the massive 
Marina Place regional shopping center has escalated into a full-scale battle, 
with the California Coastal Commission joining the fray. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Marina Place property at the western edge of Culver City lies just 
outside the state's coastal zone, the commission last week agreed to file a 
friend-of-the-court brief in a lawsuit against the $159-million project. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, meeting in nearby Marina del Rey, acted after Venice Town 
Council attorney Debra L. Bowen warned that the 1-million-square-foot mall, 
half again as large as the Westside Pavilion, would choke the Venice area with 
traffic and restrict public access to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
The Venice Town Council and the city of Los Angeles are expected to go to court 
soon to challenge Culver City's recent approval of the project. 
</P>
<P>
The Mediterranean-style mall, with two major department stores, 150 other 
shops, restaurants and a six-screen movie theater, will generate an estimated 
31,000 vehicle trips on a typical weekday and 40,030 on Saturdays. The traffic 
volumes are estimated to be 42% greater during the Christmas shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
An environmental impact report predicts that, despite extensive roadway and 
signal improvements, the addition of Marina Place traffic to the area's already 
congested streets would clog intersections as far away as Santa Monica and 
damage air quality in the vicinity of the mall. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter welcomed the coastal commission's 
involvement. "It is a sign they are taking seriously their responsibility to 
protect coastal access," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter said the shopping center will worsen traffic congestion along crowded 
Lincoln Boulevard, damage the surrounding neighborhood and, ultimately, create 
a competition between shoppers and beach visitors. 
</P>
<P>
"Marina Place means the intersection of Lincoln and Washington (boulevards) 
will be virtually gridlocked," Galanter said. "That means anyone trying to go 
up and down the coast route along Lincoln or west to the beach is going to have 
a very difficult time, far more difficult than now." 
</P>
<P>
The Culver City Council voted 3 to 2 in favor of the project on March 6, even 
though some of its environmental effects could not be corrected. 
</P>
<P>
The California Environmental Quality Act requires that all harmful 
environmental effects of large developments be offset or corrected. But the law 
also provides an escape hatch, allowing local governments to declare that 
overriding considerations exist to justify proceeding with development despite 
adverse environmental results. In Culver City's case, the council said the 
overriding considerations included Marina Place's economic and other benefits, 
including enhancing the city's image. 
</P>
<P>
A sense of urgency surrounds the project these days. One of the three council 
members supporting it will retire next month, and a second member of the 
pro-mall majority is up for reelection on April 10. 
</P>
<P>
Aware that the election could give the council an anti-mall majority, the 
Marina Place developers and their allies on the council are scrambling to 
guarantee the project a legal right to proceed. Tomorrow night, the council is 
expected to approve a formal development agreement with the developers, 
Prudential Insurance Co. and Melvin Simon Associates. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter accused the Culver City Council of rushing to judgment. "What they are 
trying to do is make sure the citizens of Culver City will not have an 
opportunity to determine the future of that property," she said in an interview 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Culver City Mayor Jozelle Smith, a supporter of the project, acknowledged in an 
interview that it is "fairly obvious" that Culver City is rushing to give final 
approvals to Marina Place before next month's election. "I'm prepared to help 
battle it to the wire," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said it would be "a real possible blow to the project" if slow-growth 
forces win control of the council. Another threat to Marina Place on the same 
ballot is a citizens initiative that would limit the height of buildings in 
commercial areas, including the 18.3-acre Marina Place site along Washington 
Boulevard, just east of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor said she was very disappointed that the Coastal Commission agreed to 
enter the legal fight over the mall by filing a brief. But Smith said she does 
not believe that the opponents' argument about coastal access will stand up in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
Smith also said it was puzzling that the Coastal Commission is choosing to 
enter the fray over development in the Venice-Marina area at this point, after 
declining to challenge many other recent development projects closer to the 
ocean. "Where was the Coastal Commission when the Marina Marketplace (in Los 
Angeles) was put up and many other developments much more closely situated to 
the coast?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Atty. Gen. Steven Kaufmann, representing the Coastal Commission, said 
the friend-of-the-court brief will deal with "the limited question of whether 
Culver City met the requirements in the Coastal Act." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Pannone, special counsel to Culver City, said the law requires a city 
outside the coastal zone to consider whether a development will have a direct 
effect on coastal resources. 
</P>
<P>
Pannone said Culver City had "taken into consideration everything that needed 
to be taken into consideration." He said the city analyzed the project's 
possible effects and mitigated them to the maximum extent possible. 
</P>
<P>
He said the city's rapid-fire actions to approve the Marina Place project, 
adopt the statement of overriding consideration and consider a development 
agreement within a two-week period are "not out of the ordinary." 
</P>
<P>
Prudential has promised Culver City $2.75 million for low- and moderate-income 
housing, water conservation, and a child-care center, if the development 
agreement is approved. Altogether, Pannone said Marina Place is expected to 
contribute $15 million in revenue to the city over a 10-year period.

PASADENA LOSES OUT IN L.A. CITY PANEL'S RAIL LINE PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The three-member Los Angeles City Council Transportation Committee last week 
passed over a Pasadena light-rail line in favor of a San Fernando Valley line. 
</P>
<P>
The three council members, each of whom had previously declared their support 
for extending the downtown Metro Rail subway 5.6 miles west from North 
Hollywood, voted to recommend that the full council adopt the same position 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the downtown-to-Pasadena route, a northward extension of the Century 
Freeway light-rail line from El Segundo to Marina del Rey also was considered. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Councilman Nate Holden, the committee chairman, predicted the full 
council would "easily pass" the San Fernando Valley endorsement and send it on 
to the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, which has the final say. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, which is building two rail lines and co-financing the first 
segment of the downtown-to-North Hollywood Metro Rail subway, is scheduled to 
decide March 28 which of the three rival projects to build next. 
</P>
<P>
Competition for the next project has intensified in recent weeks with the 
realization that the commission, which is building the railway with the extra 
half-cent sales tax that voters approved in 1980, probably will have only 
enough money to build one more line in this century. 
</P>
<P>
The commission has estimated that the San Fernando Valley project would cost 
$1.1 billion, considerably more than the estimated $925 million for the 
downtown-to-Pasadena line and $329 million for the El Segundo-to-Marina del Rey 
line. 
</P>
<P>
In predicting that the San Fernando Valley line would win the council's 
endorsement, Holden noted that eight of the 15 council members have districts 
that extend into the valley and all support the Metro Rail extension. Joining 
him in the Transportation Committee vote Wednesday were San Fernando Valley 
Councilmen Michael Woo and Hal Bernson. 
</P>
<P>
The only declared supporters of the Pasadena line on the council are Gloria 
Molina and Richard Alatorre, who together represent Highland Park, through 
which the line would pass. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, only Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who represents the Westchester area 
through which the proposed Century Freeway line extension would pass, and 
Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who represents the Harbor area, have supported 
the Century Freeway extension. 
</P>
<P>
The council officially has no say in determining which route gets built, but 
its vote is expected to carry some weight with the commission, because the city 
is paying a share of the $4-billion cost of the downtown-to-North Hollywood 
segment of Metro Rail.

HELP STUDENTS PAY FOR TRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Talolo and Joann Lepale, 16-year-old twins, students attending Bassett High 
School in La Puente, were selected as two of the 2,000 nationwide delegates to 
the Student Ambassador program (Times, March 4). 
</P>
<P>
Their 30-day tour of East Berlin, Poland, Holland, Russia, England is just 
another step towards peace and understanding in this ever shrinking world. 
</P>
<P>
These twins are fine examples of future potential community leaders. They are 
required to raise $8,000 between them, for air fare and housing, all within the 
next month or so! 
</P>
<P>
The citizens of our San Gabriel Valley are encouraged to support such positive 
and constructive youth programs. All financial contributions to the twins are 
an investment in the future of this nation. 
</P>
<P>
Please mail donations to: Robert F. Nero (principal), Bassett High School, 755 
N. Ardilla Ave., La Puente, Calif. 91746. 
</P>
<P>
The American Legion has long been a supporter of such worthwhile youth 
projects. The administrators at Bassett are to be commended for producing such 
fine representatives!

WESTWOOD BACKS HER GROUP, LAKE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Liscio's recent letter attacking Friends of Westwood demonstrates that he 
is out of touch with his neighbors. Mr. Liscio claims to be a "loyal resident 
of Westwood." Where has he been the last six years? Certainly not testifying at 
any public hearing! Perhaps if he had even attended a local Town Meeting, he 
would be aware of the interest and support most Westwood families have in 
seeing that their community is developed with care and vision. 
</P>
<P>
Friends of Westwood's positions are supported by the long-established homeowner 
associations of Westwood. In addition, Friends of Westwood belongs to and works 
closely with the Westwood Village Merchants' Assn. 
</P>
<P>
In a pluralistic society, no one group speaks for all interests. Friends of 
Westwood speaks for about 1,000 Westwood families who are concerned with 
environmental protection and public safety. These are not petty concerns for 
those of us raising families here. 
</P>
<P>
Friends of Westwood has been on the cutting edge of land-use in this city for 
five years and is proud of its record in seeing that environmental laws are 
obeyed by both private developers and UCLA. Perhaps Mr. Liscio has a problem 
with these laws. 
</P>
<P>
By any reasonable standard, Friends of Westwood and I have the support of 
Westwood families. We appreciate that trust and support, and promise to 
continue to monitor land-use development in our community.

East Los Angeles College in Monterey Park is raising funds for its Student 
Park, a site just east of the college swim stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The site has remained largely undeveloped since it was set aside for a park in 
1981. Plans call for grass and trees to be planted around a modern fast-food 
restaurant, with a fountain in an outdoor eating area and development of an 
outdoor amphitheater.

L.A. SCHOOLS WEIGH FITNESS PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bending and stretching, fifth-graders at Hancock Park Elementary School 
recently demonstrated a simple new exercise program for children that may be 
distributed throughout the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
The program, Kidfit, consists of a colorful wall poster that depicts kids doing 
the Kneet Stretch, the Skywalker and other stretching exercises, calisthenics 
and walking exercises, said Gail Weldon, a former Olympic trainer who developed 
the poster. 
</P>
<P>
The messages are: "Look, you don't have to be good at basketball to be fit," 
and "You don't need to push to the point of incredible pain to be fit," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The exercises take about 20 minutes and should be done three times a week, said 
Weldon, director of Fitness TRACC, a Mar Vista sports medicine and fitness 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
Weldon, who has degrees in physical education and elementary education, has 
printed 3,000 posters, which she is offering for $3 each. 
</P>
<P>
She noted that most Los Angeles elementary schools don't have physical 
education teachers, and that regular classroom teachers are responsible for 
fitness activities. She said the Kidfit regimen is easy and requires no 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
State test results released in November showed that most California children 
are out of shape. Statewide, only 15% of fifth-graders met at least four of the 
five fitness standards. Students in the Los Angeles Unified School District 
scored even lower, with only 6% of fifth-graders meeting four of the five 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
Board of Education member Mark Slavkin is working on gauging teachers' 
receptivity to the poster and on ways to distribute it, said Slavkin aide Jeff 
Crain. "We know that we're doing too little in terms of physical activities . . 
. of our students," Crain said. 
</P>
<P>
The Kidfit poster is available through Fitness TRACC, 12216 Venice Blvd., Los 
Angeles 90066.

BROWN MAKES APPEARANCE FOR STATE SENATE CANDIDATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No less a political potentate than former governor and current state Democratic 
Party Chairman Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. visited Laguna Hills last week on 
behalf of Janice Graham, the party's candidate for the seat vacated by former 
state Sen. William Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
In urging the Leisure World crowd of 350 to support Graham, Brown compared her 
candidacy in the heavily Republican 31st District to the movements for 
democracy in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"Get Jan Graham elected," he said. "That will so shock Orange County that maybe 
things might change." 
</P>
<P>
Much of Brown's 20-minute speech was devoted to criticism of the past decade's 
Republican administrations in Sacramento and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no crack cocaine in this state when I was governor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Graham, a former schoolteacher, unsuccessfully challenged Campbell in 1988. She 
was the top vote-getter among the Democratic candidates in a special election 
last month. She finished fifth out of eight candidates overall, with 14.1% of 
the vote. 
</P>
<P>
In the April 10 runoff election will be Graham, Assemblyman Frank Hill 
(R-Whittier), the top GOP vote-getter, and Robert Lewis of the American 
Independent Party. 
</P>
<P>
The 31st District includes the Southeast communities of Whittier, La Mirada and 
La Habra Heights. 
</P>
<P>
In a development related to the race, the California Abortion Rights Action 
League last week asked the state attorney general, the district attorneys of 
Los Angeles and Orange counties and the state Fair Political Practices 
Commission to investigate a letter sent out by a conservative Republican group 
during the February primary. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, sent by the Sacramento-based Voter Information League, praises 
Graham as "a pro-choice Democratic woman" who could make history by being 
elected to the state Senate, and urges Democrats to vote for her rather than 
for any Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the letter, the group's treasurer, Allison Turner, admitted was 
to "preserve the sanctity of the two-party system" by keeping Democrats from 
affecting the Republican race. 
</P>
<P>
Political officials, however, have speculated that the letter's intent was to 
keep Democrats from voting for Republican pro-choice candidate Ron Isles, who 
came in third in the race.

SUIT CITES ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city failed to conduct proper environmental reviews of a developer's 
application to subdivide parcels of foothill land flanking her single-family 
home, a homeowner charged in a lawsuit filed last week in Pomona Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Everett Hughes submitted separate applications for the subdivisions: 
one in 1987 to create a 32-lot subdivision on 72 acres, and the other in 1989 
to subdivide a 2.7-acre lot into five residential lots. 
</P>
<P>
The city approved both requests but scaled down the larger proposal to 26 lots. 
</P>
<P>
In her suit, filed March 12, Lone Hill Avenue homeowner Diane Michelsen asked 
the court to order the city to rescind its decisions, and to require a new 
environmental impact report considering both subdivisions as a single proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Michelsen's attorney, Ronald Ballard, said the city's approvals are invalid 
under the California Environmental Quality Act because the previous 
environmental review considered the proposals separately. No date has been set 
for the case, but it must be heard within 90 days, he said. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Cheryl Kane and developer Hughes did not return phone calls seeking 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Michelsen is a co-founder of the slow-growth group Glendora Pride. She said she 
helped establish the group two years ago in response to the impending 
development around her home.

HOT PROPERTY: 'JEOPARDY' HOST BUYS MOUNTAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Game-show host ALEX TREBEK has purchased a mountain in the Hollywood Hills 
where he plans to build a dream home for his bride and himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know yet what style house I will build," CBS-TV's "Jeopardy" star 
said. "We both like modern architecture and French chateaus, so who knows? But 
it will be a collaborative effort with my fiancee, Jean Currivan . . . and it 
will be a monster." 
</P>
<P>
He paid $1.5 million for more than 35 acres just north of the Sunset Strip, 
including 21 lots that he plans to sell for from $100,000 to $480,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
"He got a steal," said Dan Kristo of Realty People Inc., who represented Trebek 
in the acquisition and has the listings. 
</P>
<P>
"It will still cost a lot to develop," Trebek said, "but maybe I got a good 
deal, because the owner had a special place in his heart for the property. He 
wanted to build a home there for himself and his wife but didn't, so now he'd 
like to see another young couple build (on the site)." 
</P>
<P>
The seller was Paul Sutro. "He did a lot of land development in the Hollywood 
Hills and downtown with his brothers during the '40s and '50s," Trebek said. 
</P>
<P>
"This was one of the (Sutro) family's last large holdings," Kristo added. "Alex 
will resell the lots, which rim the bottom of the property, and he'll still 
have 35 acres for his own estate. The drive to his front door will be almost a 
mile long." 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to cut off the top of the mountain to make a pad, but that's the 
kind of thing I enjoy doing," Trebek said. "I built my chalet in Canada and 
renovated three or four houses, so I can do a lot of the work myself, but we'll 
have to wait until after the rainy season to start grading. We'll probably 
start about the time we get married." 
</P>
<P>
He and Currivan expect to get married in April. "We're supposed to get married 
then," he said, "but we're both so busy, we may have to wait until fall." 
Currivan works for a company that develops shopping plazas and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
They will live, he said, in his present home on Mulholland Drive until their 
new home is completed. 
</P>
<P>
Actor KIRK CAMERON is settling into his first house. 
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old, who plays Mike Seaver on ABC-TV's "Growing Pains," paid 
$500,000 for the two-bedroom, two-bath house on a hill in the suburbs of Simi 
Valley, near his family's home in West Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The trilevel house, on more than an acre, was built by the former owner and has 
no interior doors, a spokesman for Mike Glickman Realty said. The home also has 
a guest house and a garage with a bedroom and an exercise room. 
</P>
<P>
Laverne Ferraro of Glickman's Encino office handled the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Ex-heavyweight champ MIKE TYSON and Tyson's promoter DON KING have put a 
Wilshire Corridor condo they have jointly owned for a couple of years on the 
market at $660,000, including furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no punching bags in the townhouse," said Kathy Villa, who has the 
listing at Asher Dann &amp; Associates, "but the building has a gym, swimming 
pool and tennis court." 
</P>
<P>
The 2,100-square-foot unit, on the third floor of a high-rise, has two bedrooms 
and a den, all filled with what Villa termed "very oversized furniture." 
Neither King nor Tyson owns any other homes in the Los Angeles area at this 
time, she added. 
</P>
<P>
A lake-front home in Toluca Lake, owned for four decades by the ROY DISNEY 
family, has been sold for $3.75 million, a record price for the area, sources 
say. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Disney Sr., brother of entertainment mogul Walt Disney, lived in the house 
for years before his son, Roy Disney Jr., took occupancy. The family sold the 
property in the late '70s. 
</P>
<P>
The Art Deco, 8,000-square-foot mansion has a disco, projection room, 
glass-walled music conservatory, gym, two boat docks and 18-foot-tall, bronze 
front doors with wrought-iron gates. 
</P>
<P>
"From the street, people see it and say 'Who lives there?' " an industry source 
observed. Ron Howard, Bob Hope, Rick Dees and Henry Winkler are some of the 
celebs who live in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The new owner was identified as Hal Lederman, a commercial real estate investor 
who heads the large new cosmetic company that just introduced actor George 
Hamilton's Skincare System. The sellers, three investors, bought the property 
about a year ago from Joe Payne, a Texas industrialist involved in oil and real 
estate, and his wife, Dorothy. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Payne lived there by herself for several years, and she was 
responsible, sources say, for turning the Monterey Colonial-style house into a 
home with an Art Deco museum-quality look. The investors, two brothers and a 
sister headed by designer Richard Helfrich, completed the job. 
</P>
<P>
Realtors involved in the deal wouldn't comment, but they are Andrew Manning of 
Fred Sands Realtors, who represented the buyer, and Margie Oswald and Vida 
Monify of Rodeo Realty, who represented the sellers. 
</P>
<P>
HARVEY and MARILYN DIAMOND, authors of the best-selling "Fit for Life" diet 
book, are planning to move from the five-bedroom, five-bath home they built 
three years ago in Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
They've put the Tudor-style house on the market at $2.1 million and are 
negotiating to buy in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
"The Diamonds really practice what they preach," said Brian Panella, who listed 
the authors' house through Jon Douglas Co.'s Malibu offices. "They planted 
thousands of dollars worth of fruit trees, raspberries, strawberries and 
blackberries that they use in their everyday diet." 
</P>
<P>
The Diamonds' 6-acre site consists of three contiguous parcels, including the 
one with the 7,000-square-foot house. 
</P>
<P>
Gary L. Wilson, former chief financial officer of Walt Disney Co. who is now a 
company director and consultant, is said to be buying the Holmby Hills mansion 
known as the GOETZ ESTATE from the family of the late Edie Goetz, daughter of 
movie mogul Louis B. Mayer. 
</P>
<P>
The 17,000-square-foot Georgian-style mansion, built in 1934, fell out of a 
5-month-long escrow late last fall. Christopher Skase, head of Qintex Australia 
Ltd., dropped plans then to buy it, reportedly for a bit more than $8 million, 
after his company failed to acquire MGM/UA film studios. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-acre property was first listed last spring at $12 million. Real estate 
sources say Wilson is paying about $7.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
An 8,100-square-foot country English estate, owned by late producer GARY 
HENDLER, has been sold in probate court for more than its $3.75-million asking 
price. 
</P>
<P>
Shopping center developer Elliot Megdal and his wife, Alana, paid $4 million 
for the 1 3/4-acre, 52-year-old home in the Beverly Hills Post Office Area. The 
buyers were represented by Judi Schryro of Alvarez, Hyland &amp; Young.

AT HOME: L.A.'S NEWEST CITY GREW UP IN HURRY; 
</P>
<P>
DIAMOND BAR: WHERE CATTLE ROAMED ONLY A FEW YEARS AGO, HOUSES AND CONDOS NOW 
STAND. TOWN'S BIGGEST PROBLEM: TRAFFIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sixteen years ago, Diamond Bar wasn't Joseph Gruner's idea of the best place to 
buy a home. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife, Pamela, wanted to live near the coast, preferably in Orange 
County. They shopped around for an affordable three-bedroom home, but the 
prices were too expensive for the one-income family: $45,000 for a 20-year-old 
house in Westminster or Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
So they settled in a new, 1,400-square-foot tract house in northern Diamond Bar 
-- 30 miles away from the nearest beach, 30 miles from the mountains and 30 
miles from downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Gruners bought the house on Red Cloud Drive for $30,000, with a $500 down 
payment and a monthly mortgage of $330. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Diamond Bar was a sparsely developed, unincorporated bedroom 
community on the eastern edge of the San Gabriel Valley. Clusters of 
wood-shingled tract homes were nestled among 8,000 acres of rolling hills. Oak 
and walnut trees dotted the landscape, and herds of cattle and buffalo roamed 
freely. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife used to tell me, 'You stuck me out here in the weeds,' " Gruner, 42, 
recalled. "But now, Diamond Bar has grabbed hold of us both." 
</P>
<P>
Incorporated just one year ago in March, 1989, as Los Angeles County's newest 
city, Diamond Bar, with a population of 60,000, is one of the fastest growing 
cities in Los Angeles County, along with neighboring Walnut, and the northern 
county cities of Lancaster and Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
Low crime rates and highly rated public schools combine to make the area 
especially attractive to young families. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, schools were what enticed the Gruners, with three sons, to their 
second home in the southern part of Diamond Bar in 1987, where they found a 
$190,000 four-bedroom house in the Walnut Valley Unified School District, a 
name recognized statewide and displayed prominently in real estate 
advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
The Gruners' old neighborhood was part of the lower-ranked Pomona district. 
</P>
<P>
"So I drive 45 minutes every day to get to work," said Joseph Gruner, who is 
employed by a Gardena neon sign company. "I don't feel we compromised. We 
wanted the new. We wanted the chance to grow with the community." 
</P>
<P>
Diamond Bar's quiet, bucolic atmosphere is being replaced as clusters of retail 
establishments and restaurants sprout up along Grand Avenue, Golden Springs 
Drive and Diamond Bar Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Larger, more expensive homes are being built alongside condominiums and 
apartment complexes. 
</P>
<P>
Single-family homes in Diamond Bar start at $200,000, but new houses cost at 
least $400,000, said Gwen Henry, a broker at Richard A. Sowers Realtor Inc. in 
Diamond Bar. The median price for homes is $325,000. Condominiums start at 
$100,000 and top out at $300,000, Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
The new development and rise in home prices, is "the evolution of the city," 
said John Patrick Newe, president of Century 21 E-N Realty in Diamond Bar and 
one of the founders of the Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Along with unprecedented growth have come severe growing pains. Ask any 
resident, old or new, to name the largest single problem facing Diamond Bar, 
and chances are they'll give the same answer. 
</P>
<P>
"Traffic," Granville Wilson, 73, said emphatically. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't go anywhere anymore," groaned his wife, Ruby, 75. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilsons moved to Diamond Bar's first housing tract in 1960, when there were 
more deer than cars in the area. They paid $18,000 for a three-bedroom 
wood-shingle and stucco house on La Bonita Road, then only a 20-minute drive to 
Anaheim, where Granville Wilson worked as a mechanical engineer. 
</P>
<P>
Today, that drive would take twice as long "at least," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond Bar is serviced by a few major streets that easily clog up during a 
typical rush-hour period. The 2.5-mile junction of the Orange (57) and 
Pomona(60) freeways, where 226,000 cars pass daily to and from Orange and San 
Bernardino counties, is one of the most congested spots in the state, said 
California Highway Patrol Lt. Donald Pitt. 
</P>
<P>
It is notorious for bottlenecked traffic and fatal automobile accidents. Cars 
paralyzed in the late-afternoon gridlock take Diamond Bar off-ramps, using city 
streets as detours. 
</P>
<P>
When the newly installed City Council first met last year, traffic was one of 
the first items on the agenda. Diamond Bar was being sued by San Bernardino 
County over a chain-link fence and barricades erected across the east end of 
Grand Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Before Diamond Bar's incorporation, Los Angeles County officials had erected 
the barriers to block cars from the rapidly growing community of Chino Hills, 
fearing a recently completed extension of Grand Avenue through Diamond Bar 
would exacerbate traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
The solution was only temporary. Late last year, Diamond Bar officials agreed 
to remove the barriers by next September, in exchange for $1.2 million in road 
improvements from San Bernardino. Both sides agreed to cooperate in building 
more roads to siphon off Grand Avenue traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Wilsons don't plan on leaving their quiet, tree-lined street. 
</P>
<P>
"We enjoy the neighbors so much," Ruby Wilson said, adding that five of their 
original neighbors still live there. "You get to the point where you're 
rooted." 
</P>
<P>
The tract housing boom that lured first-time home buyers to Diamond Bar in the 
1970s and kept them there through the '80s has driven up prices considerably, 
making it harder for middle-income earners to break into the city's housing 
market. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988 alone, the median price of a single-family house surged 27%, Newe said. 
The increase reflects an overall trend that year in the Greater Los Angeles 
Area, where housing prices grew 30.6%, according to the Los Angeles Board of 
Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
Prices slowed down in 1989 in Diamond Bar as elsewhere, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighborhoods are in transition. A recent influx of immigrants, mostly from 
Pacific Rim countries, is gradually changing the ethnic makeup of Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
Families from Taiwan and Hong Kong, once concentrated in the western San 
Gabriel Valley cities of Alhambra, Arcadia and Monterey Park, are drifting 
eastward to Hacienda Heights, Walnut and Diamond Bar, where schools are 
considered better, land is cheaper and houses are newer. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the changing demographics, real estate firms in Diamond Bar are 
scrambling to find multilingual salespersons. 
</P>
<P>
The firms also are adapting their sales tactics to a Chinese method of 
divination called feng shui, which some Asian clients use to determine if a 
site and floor plan are in harmony with nature, thus bringing health and 
happiness to the buyer. 
</P>
<P>
Residential development in Diamond Bar began in 1956, when Transamerica Corp. 
bought the Diamond Bar Ranch to develop as Southern California's first planned 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Transamerica paid $10 million for the ranch, envisioning rows and clusters of 
spacious suburban dwellings that would eventually become home to 75,000 people. 
Over the years, the land was sold off to other builders. 
</P>
<P>
Today, tract development covers the hillsides, leaving little vacant land. 
Newer, more expensive custom homes are located in Diamond Bar Country Estates 
("The Country"), the city's only gated community, with an impressive view of 
the Walnut and Pomona valleys and access to private equestrian trails. 
</P>
<P>
Prices there range from a low of $600,000 to $8 million, said Gwendolyn Henry, 
a broker at Richard A. Sowers Realtor Inc., which handles most sales in The 
Country. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Hamendra Rana and his wife, Shachi, are building their dream house in The 
Country: a 13,000-square-foot mansion atop 1.2-acres of prime real estate on 
Ridgeline Road. Complete with dance floor, billiard and card rooms, and a Hindu 
shrine, it will be four times bigger than the Ranas' current home in Diamond 
Bar. 
</P>
<P>
"I always was fascinated by these big houses as I drove down Diamond Bar 
Boulevard and looked up," said Shachi Rana, 31. The Ranas purchased two lots 
for $350,000 in 1987. Today, the land would be worth $1.3 million, Hamendra 
Rana said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ranas, originally from Bombay, had another reason for choosing Diamond Bar. 
Of 700 families in The Country, 80 are Indian, Shachi Rana said. 
</P>
<P>
"Location-wise, it's perfect," she said. "The kids have their friends here. I'm 
close to a group here. And after all this energy and sweat I don't want to move 
anymore. I want to pass (the house) on to my kids." 
</P>
<P>
The Ranas are not the only family with big plans. Houses in The Country have 
grown to Gargantuan sizes, several more than 12,000 square feet. At first, some 
residents complained the gated community was losing its equestrian, rural 
flavor to Hollywood glitz and flash. 
</P>
<P>
"They would say, 'What the hell are you building a home like that for? Go to 
Beverly Hills,' " said Magdy Seif, 45, whose 15,000-square-foot French Normandy 
mansion has become something of a tourist attraction for passers-by on 
Wagontrain Lane. 
</P>
<P>
"They resented us very much in the beginning. But once they realized it 
increased the value of their home, they didn't mind," Seif said. 
</P>
<P>
The upscale reputation of Diamond Bar also is drawing people with more moderate 
incomes who like the city's slower-paced atmosphere, said Newe of Century 21. 
</P>
<P>
Developers are meeting an increasing demand for condominiums and apartments, 
from newly completed $750-a-month rentals on Temple Avenue and Mission 
Boulevard to the luxury Montefino condominiums, which sell for $190,000 to 
250,000. In the last decade, the number of apartments and condominiums tripled 
to about 3,900 units, 37% of all housing in Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
And that may be increasing: "In January, 60% of our sales were condos," Newe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But while city officials welcome growth, they don't want an army of bulldozers 
and construction cranes to invade Diamond Bar and turn it into a city of 
high-rises and cramped living spaces. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1989 incorporation election, cityhood proponents campaigned largely 
on a slow-growth platform, blaming the county for allowing development to 
continue unchecked. Residents voted overwhelmingly in favor of incorporation, 
by a margin of 3 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
Still, vestiges of the old Diamond Bar Ranch remain. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Gruner occasionally sees road runners scamper past his window. Cattle 
graze on golden slopes near the junction of the 57 and 60 freeways, oblivious 
to the late-afternoon traffic merging dangerously. And deer feed from pools of 
water near City Hall, across the street from the future site of the South Coast 
Air Quality Management District's new headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
But Gruner said he's ready for the day houses will displace the last of the 
jack rabbits and coyotes. He's erected a concrete statue of a deer in his back 
yard.

SAM HALL KAPLAN: WESTWEEK'S SMILING FACES, EMPTY SPACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM HALL KAPLAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Westweek is here again, a time for the diverse design community from around the 
world to gather at the Pacific Design Center and check out what's hot, what's 
not and what's happening in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But despite all the smiling faces, trays of wine and cheese and comments to the 
contrary, all is not good news at the PDC and scattered design showrooms, 
offices and studios beyond. 
</P>
<P>
The cutbacks and back stabbings that the industry is experiencing nationwide 
are also being felt here, our location on the Pacific Rim notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
The reality for design in Los Angeles is that the tide is low and the surf 
rough, except, of course, for a few freestylists drifting along on 
hot-air-filled inner tubes. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the view of the surf from the sun-bleached beaches looks good, 
especially to the visitor escaping the mud slinging and cold of the industry's 
trenches in New York and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Attending the annual design show and accompanying symposiums and social events 
this week will be about 30,000 interior designers and decorators, artisans and 
architects, facility managers, furnishing manufacturers, product 
representatives and others who compose the design trade and profession. 
</P>
<P>
Although Westweek is closed to the public, the week's events do affect us. 
</P>
<P>
Design has become a $31-billion-a-year international industry, and much of what 
will be previewed and talked about in the coming week most likely will be on 
display in showrooms next year, and in residences, offices, hotels and 
restaurants the year after. 
</P>
<P>
Making Westweek perhaps a little more pertinent to Los Angeles this year, if 
not somewhat self-serving, is the theme of its symposiums: "L.A. 20/21: Design. 
Business. The Next Century." 
</P>
<P>
The implication of the advance press releases is that if you want to get a 
sense of the direction design is taking you have to tune into L.A. 
</P>
<P>
"Outsiders have called it the City of Tomorrow, meaning that Los Angeles is 
today what other cities will be like in the future," declares architect Cesar 
Pelli, whose worldwide practice was jump-started in Los Angeles with the design 
of the distinctly skinned and styled PDC. 
</P>
<P>
Explored by a variety of panels and personalities will be the "new 
international culture" that is Los Angeles, with particular emphasis on those 
"who are currently creating works and projects which are influencing creative 
communities and various audiences around the world," states Judi Skalsky in the 
introduction of the Westweek program. 
</P>
<P>
According to the program I received last month, Skalsky is identified as the 
senior vice president, marketing and design for the center, and is given credit 
for the Westweek '90 concept. 
</P>
<P>
But that program has since been amended, with Skalsky's name omitted. Since 
writing those optimistic words and shaping the optimistic-toned events, she has 
been let go, a victim of the cutbacks now being felt throughout the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the happy face being put out at the PDC, for some this year's Westweek 
will be more a wake than a celebration. 
</P>
<P>
No one wants to go on the record about the problems there or elsewhere, but to 
see them, all you have to do is walk the echoing floors of the 
1.2-million-square-foot PDC, drive up and down Robertson Boulevard, and talk to 
salespersons, account executives, manufacturers and designers. 
</P>
<P>
Empty showrooms are everywhere, persevering dealers are being circumvented by 
manufacturers giving deep discounts directly to major customers, ad lineage in 
most of the trade publications is down sharply (33% in the last three years), 
and work scarce, with design offices undercutting each other. 
</P>
<P>
As for the unleased space, that in part, is a result of the recent mergers and 
bankruptcies, particularly in the contract furniture field, where in the boom 
years of the 1980s there had been unbridled expansion. This has included 
Steelcase Corp. acquiring a variety of smaller companies, CorryHiebert 
liquidating and SunarHauserman going bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, rents have skyrocketed at the PDC from $10 or so a square 
foot a year 10 years ago, to about $40 today, plus hefty operating costs making 
it the highest in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"To meet their rent they (manufacturers and showrooms) are cutting ads," 
complained an editor of a prominent trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
And while the ads are down, the number of shelter magazines are up, having 
proliferated in response to the expanding industry of the 1980s. Now they are 
being hung out to dry, prompting desperate attempts to get a piece of the 
dwindling advertsing pie. 
</P>
<P>
Making major format and/or editorial changes within the last year to strengthen 
their appeal have been Architecture, Architectural Record, Progressive 
Architecture, HG (House &amp; Garden), Interior Design, The Designer and 
Contract magazines. 
</P>
<P>
Others are reaching out further and further for new markets, witness the entry 
of Metropolis into California and Metropolitan Home becoming sort of the MTV of 
shelter magazines. 
</P>
<P>
A result is that out of fear of offending advertisers or subscribers, almost 
all have given up any critical commentary in favor of purposeless pap. 
Increasingly, it is becoming harder to tell the ads from the articles; indeed, 
many appear to be just warmed-over press releases. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the business of design professionals is becoming more mature and 
demanding, which some feel is not necessarily bad. 
</P>
<P>
"Frivolity is no longer 'in,' " confided a facilities executive. "Given the 
cutbacks, we are not prone to indulge some ego expression of one of your (Los 
Angeles') shining lights. Besides, we have found they tend not be able to 
produce products or projects that work, beyond generating some publicity." 
</P>
<P>
Still, as the Westweek program indicates, L.A.'s image is hot, and it's the 
place most designers want to be these days. 
</P>
<P>
"They are parachuting in, willing to work at the foot of a master for minimal 
wages," observes architect Jack Hillbrand, who has practiced on both coasts and 
is now in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"The result is that the market is flooded at a tight time, bringing down 
everyone's salary. It takes new arrivals about a year to find out they are 
being had, but by then there is a new crop of graduates eager to sacrifice 
themselves, at $6 to $10 an hour." 
</P>
<P>
Making the situation even tougher is that, besides the flood of young 
architects, Los Angeles also is attracting an increasing number of 
world-renowned designers, who, to the dismay of local firms, have snared some 
major commissions here. 
</P>
<P>
"It's become wild and woolly, and fiercely competitive," said Barbara Casey, 
whose public relations firm has represented a variety of designers and 
architects. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe beyond all the usual platitudes offered at Westweek, there will be some 
honest, open discussion of the tough issues facing the design industry and Los 
Angeles today. It is time the industry stop trying to dazzle itself and others.

REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: SELLERS SHOULD HONOR CONTRACT WITH FINE PRINT THEY 
FAILED TO READ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: We listed our home for sale with an excellent real estate agent who 
put our home into the local multiple listing system. While our agent was on 
vacation, an agent from another brokerage office obtained an offer to buy our 
house. It was a full price, all-cash offer so we were very pleased. 
</P>
<P>
I guess we were a little excited and we didn't read the fine print in the 
offer. It says we, the sellers, are to pay the buyer's closing costs, including 
loan fee. When our agent got back from vacation she was livid with rage at the 
other agent who failed to explain to us that the closing costs, in addition to 
the sales commission, will be about $6,500, which we weren't expecting to pay. 
Must we honor this contract we didn't fully understand? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: If it had been a mutual mistake by both parties to the contract, 
contract law would allow you to rescind the agreement. However, it appears this 
was a unilateral mistake by just you and not by the buyer. Under contract law, 
a unilateral mistake is usually not grounds to cancel a contract unless the 
other party knew or should have known about the mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Although most real estate agents go over the details of a sales contract with 
the sellers and buyers, it is not a requirement that every detail be explained. 
If your agent had been present, she surely would have pointed out the unusual 
clause asking you to pay all the buyer's closing costs. 
</P>
<P>
But considering that you will be selling your home for the full asking price 
and will receive all-cash without having to carry back any mortgage financing 
for the buyer, if I were in your situation, I would go ahead with the sale. 
</P>
<P>
If you try to back out, the buyer might sue you for specific performance of the 
sales contract and tie up your home by recording a lis pendens, (which means 
anyone buying the home takes it subject to the litigation results) to 
effectively prevent you from selling it. Next time, read the fine print before 
signing a contract. 
</P>
<P>
Why Co-op Apartment Is Difficult to Sell 
</P>
<P>
Q: I recently inherited a cooperative apartment in San Francisco from my late 
aunt. I talked with several realty agents there and they tell me it can be very 
difficult to sell a cooperative apartment, except at a much lower price than a 
comparable condominium. 
</P>
<P>
These agents tell me it is virtually impossible to finance a co-op apartment 
sale unless I am willing to help finance it for the buyer because few banks 
will make loans on co-ops. If this is true, what should I do? 
</P>
<P>
A: The real estate agents gave you accurate information about cooperative 
apartments. Because of the lack of financing, except in New York City and a few 
other areas with large numbers of co-ops, many cooperatives have converted into 
condominiums which can be financed with mortgages like single-family houses. To 
sell your co-op you will probably have to finance the buyer's purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Most cooperatives have one large mortgage on the entire building. As the 
mortgage gets paid down, each owner's equity grows. The larger the equity, the 
more difficult it can be to sell a co-op apartment because few prospective 
buyers have enough cash to buy out the seller's entire equity. Since most banks 
and S&amp;Ls won't loan on co-ops, the most practical alternative is for the 
seller to finance the sale, secured by the co-op stock. 
</P>
<P>
Another major drawback of co-ops is prospective buyers must be approved by the 
board of directors. They can be very difficult and need not give any reason for 
rejecting an applicant. Perhaps you recall a few years ago ex-President Nixon 
was rejected when he applied to buy a New York City co-op. 
</P>
<P>
Potential Pitfalls of a Land Contract 
</P>
<P>
Q: Nineteen years ago we signed a land contract to buy our home and have been 
faithfully making monthly payments to the bank which collects the payments for 
the seller. Since we only have a few payments left, I stopped by the bank to 
check on the exact balance owed and to find out how we will get the deed to our 
house. 
</P>
<P>
The collection officer said our monthly payments have been deposited to a 
seller's savings account at the bank. He said the bank does not know the 
whereabouts of our seller since her mail from the bank has been returned for 
the last four years and there haven't been any withdrawals from the savings 
account in over six years. How will we get the deed to our home when we make 
our final payment? 
</P>
<P>
A: Your situation is not unusual. Many property buyers faithfully make their 
land contract payments, only to learn the seller is unable to deliver 
marketable title. 
</P>
<P>
For readers not familiar with land contracts, they also are called contracts 
for deed, contracts of sale, agreements for deed, installment land sale 
contracts and various other names in different states. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is the seller retains the title until the buyer makes all or an agreed 
number of payments. This method is often used when the buyer has little or no 
cash for a down payment. 
</P>
<P>
After you make your final land contract payment, if the bank which has been 
collecting the payments is still unable to locate the seller, your legal 
alternative is to bring a quiet-title lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The seller can be served by publication of a notice in a local legal newspaper. 
At the hearing the court can order title quieted in your name and the court 
will issue a deed to you. Please consult a real estate attorney for details. 
</P>
<P>
What Costs Can Home Seller Anticipate? 
</P>
<P>
Q: We are selling our home without a real estate agent to a relative. Our 
attorney will be handling the closing. Please give us a list of the sales costs 
we can expect. 
</P>
<P>
A: The major closing costs you may encounter include mortgage loan payoff 
(unless the buyer assumes your existing mortgage), mortgage prepayment penalty, 
legal or escrow fees. (By custom, in some communities these costs are split 
between buyer and seller or paid by the buyer. Who pays these charges is 
negotiable.) 
</P>
<P>
Also, transfer tax, property tax and utility pro-rations, loan points if the 
buyer is getting a new VA mortgage, title insurance fee (customarily paid by 
the buyer in some areas) and miscellaneous charges, such as recording fee and 
document preparation fee. To avoid surprises, a few days before the scheduled 
closing date, ask for an itemized list of the charges you will be expected to 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
Why Does Board Make It Hard to Find Agent? 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am preparing to put my house on the market and want three agents, as you 
often suggest. Since I don't know any agents here, I called the local Board of 
Realtors to get the names of their three most successful sales agents. The 
nasty lady who answered the phone said that is confidential information. 
</P>
<P>
Then I asked for the names of the three largest local brokerages and again she 
refused to give me this information. Since realtors don't have the best 
reputation to begin with, why does their organization go out of their way to be 
uncooperative with home sellers? 
</P>
<P>
A: The answer you received from your local Board of Realtors, unfortunately, is 
typical of most local boards. You were wise to want to interview the most 
successful agents in your community, but it is a shame the local board was so 
uncooperative. 
</P>
<P>
Such information is not confidential and there is no reason you should not have 
been given the names of the top agents. If you watch the newspaper, you will 
often find the top agents honored for their sales success, so there is no 
reason not to give that information to prospective home sellers. 
</P>
<P>
I fully agree sometimes the realtors are their own worst enemies. For an 
industry that depends on favorable public relations, refusal to answer 
reasonable requests from consumers does far more harm than good. 
</P>
<P>
Reader Says Cancel Property Tax Impound 
</P>
<P>
Q: For 12 years I had been paying one-twelfth of my property taxes each month 
into an impound escrow account held by my lender. Last year my loan servicing 
was transferred to an out-of-state lender who said I was short by about $600 in 
my escrow impound account. 
</P>
<P>
But I figured my monthly payment was about right. I got into a big hassle with 
the lender over the correct amount to be paid each month. Then I got out my 
loan papers and found out there was no requirement for me to have an impound 
escrow account, so I canceled it. 
</P>
<P>
The lender tried to tell me I couldn't cancel, but when I pointed out the 
mortgage doesn't require it they reluctantly sent me a check for the balance in 
my impound escrow account. Perhaps other readers who are having similar loan 
service hassles can use this technique. 
</P>
<P>
A: Lenders often try to over-collect on property tax and insurance impounds 
because then the lenders have the cost-free use of that money until the 
payments must be made to the tax collector and insurance agent. The only loans 
which usually require escrow impounds are VA, FHA and PMI (private mortgage 
insurance) loans. Most other conventional loan borrowers are not required to 
have escrow impounds, but many have them for convenience. 
</P>
<P>
Rent Value Formula No Longer Applies 
</P>
<P>
Q: We are moving away for about two years and plan to rent our home to tenants 
while we are gone. A friend told me we should ask for monthly rent about 1% of 
our home's market value. We estimate our home is worth around $175,000. But 
$1,750 monthly rent seems pretty high. Is there a formula for home rentals? 
</P>
<P>
A: The formula used to be that single-family houses should rent for 1% per 
month of their fair market value. However, this formula is outdated because in 
most towns it is not possible to get that much rent for all except the 
lowest-priced homes. 
</P>
<P>
A better alternative is to check the newspaper classified ads of houses for 
rent in your neighborhood. Phone a few advertisers to learn if the features of 
their homes are comparable to yours. You will soon have a feel for how much 
rent you can get for your home. 
</P>
<P>
Earnest Money Shows Buyer Is Serious 
</P>
<P>
Q: I went to a real estate lecture about buying a home. The speaker, an 
attorney, said it really isn't necessary to make a large earnest money deposit 
to buy a home. He said all that is necessary is for the buyer and seller to 
sign the sales contract. I recall when we sold our home many years ago the 
buyers made a $500 earnest money deposit. Has this custom changed? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. But the attorney is correct. Legally, no earnest money deposit is 
required to form a binding real estate sales contract. All that is needed for 
consideration are the signatures of the buyer and seller on the sales contract. 
Those signatures obligate both parties to perform the sales contract. 
</P>
<P>
However, in the real world, very few home sellers will accept a buyer's 
purchase offer without an earnest money deposit. The larger the earnest money 
deposit, the less chance the buyer will default and not complete the home 
purchase as agreed. If the buyer isn't willing to put up an earnest money 
deposit, that buyer probably isn't serious. 
</P>
<P>
Charity Can Provide Housing for Donor 
</P>
<P>
Q: A friend told me she recently gave her home to a charity in return for a 
monthly payment as long as she lives. She can continue living in her home too. 
Does this sound like a good deal? 
</P>
<P>
A: Many colleges, churches and other charitable groups such as the Salvation 
Army welcome real estate donations in return for lifetime income paid to the 
donor. The monthly payment depends on the property's appraised market value and 
the life expectancy of the donor. 
</P>
<P>
Although many charities have lifetime annuity plans, most prefer cash 
donations. Only a few accept property donations and allow the donor to retain a 
life estate in the property. If such an arrangement meets the donors needs, it 
is probably a "good deal." 
</P>
<P>
Unrecorded Deed May Be Perfectly Valid 
</P>
<P>
Q: Recently my husband died. He handled all our financial affairs. When I went 
to our safe deposit box to see what was in it I found the deed to our home. The 
attorney says it has never been recorded. 
</P>
<P>
We bought the house about 14 years ago. I don't understand how this could have 
happened. We bought the house from a friend who carried the mortgage. The 
friend died a few years ago and we make the mortgage payments to his daughter. 
Do you think this deed is good? 
</P>
<P>
A: An unrecorded deed may be perfectly valid. Although recording gives 
constructive notice of the document's contents, an unrecorded deed is effective 
between the grantor and the grantee. Your attorney should be able to advise you 
how to have the title status checked and how to obtain title insurance, which 
would be a very good idea.

NEW ZEALAND SHRUB FEELS AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SMAUS, TIMES GARDEN EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arriving at nurseries right about now are the many varieties of one of Southern 
California's best shrubs, the leptospermums, also known as New Zealand tea 
trees, because the leaves were apparently used to prevent scurvy on sailing 
ships a long way from home. 
</P>
<P>
Though they grow almost like native plants here, they originally came from 
those islands, where they are known as manukas. They are fast-growing, drought 
resistant, pest-free and flower in winter and early spring. 
</P>
<P>
Though some never seem to stop flowering (but this has to do with pruning), 
they generally begin in the late fall and peak now. March is their month, when 
they finally come into full, fat flower, which is why nurseries stock up on 
leptospermums at this time of the year. 
</P>
<P>
This is definitely the only way to buy them -- in full flower -- because the 
names are much confused and the colors distinct enough to require seeing in 
person before any decision is made. In flower you can see that those called 
"pink" are quite rosy, and usually not a clear pink, and that the reds are 
ruby-like or burgundy and nothing like a fire engine. 
</P>
<P>
Like most plants from the Southern Hemisphere, their colors are a bit different 
than those of us on this half of the globe are accustomed to, and they don't 
always blend harmoniously without a little effort on the planter's part. 
</P>
<P>
The double-white varieties are certainly safe in any color scheme, and are 
probably the prettiest of all since they look remarkably like fruit tree 
blossoms. The best known of the hybrid leptospermums is the one named 'Ruby 
Glow,' which has deep ruby-red or oxblood blossoms that are also double. They 
look all the more handsome because the slender, sliver-like leaves are also 
tinged with red. This was one of the first to be introduced by pioneer plant 
breeder Walter E. Lammerts, who hybridized a number of leptospermums while at 
UCLA in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
(A remarkable man, he also hybridized eastern lilacs ('Lavender lady') for 
Descanso Gardens; California lilacs, or ceanothus ('Sierra Blue'); peach trees 
(the 'Daily News' series), plus a number of roses and camellias.) 
</P>
<P>
In New Zealand and Australia there are many kinds of leptospermums and quite a 
few have found their way to our shores, but the best known, including 'Ruby 
Glow,' are hybrids of Leptospermum scoparium. These are the ones with the 
prettiest flowers, and they fall into roughly two groups. 
</P>
<P>
There are those with reddish foliage and dark-red flowers. 'Ruby Glow' is one 
of these. Others include 'Red Damask,' 'Winter Cheer' and 'Crimson Glory,' 
which along with 'Ruby Queen' grow to about 10 feet, though they can be kept 
around 6 feet with pruning. Two other red-flowered, red-foliaged cultivars get 
a few feet taller -- 'Burgundy Queen' and 'Atlantis,' which has perhaps the 
reddest foliage. 
</P>
<P>
The other group grows taller, to 12 feet given the opportunity. These have 
green foliage and include 'Blossom' with blush-pink double flowers; 'Pink 
Pearl,' with its pink buds and white double flowers; 'Martinii' with single 
white and rose flowers; 'Helene Strybing' with single, deep-pink flowers, and 
'Sunyasia' a rose pink with large flowers. 
</P>
<P>
'Fascination,' a double pink, is the shortest of this lot, growing to only 8 or 
10 feet, though there is one named 'Nanum Tui' that supposedly grows to only 3 
feet, though New Zealand books put it at closer to 6. 
</P>
<P>
The shortest is probably 'Pink Cascade,' a low, spreading variant that would 
make a fine bank cover, growing about 2 feet tall by 10 feet wide, but most of 
the common leptospermums are big shrubs. Even with regular pruning it is 
difficult to keep them under a window at 6 feet tall, and it is not too hard to 
spot examples of leptospermums that their owners are having a hard time keeping 
in bounds. 
</P>
<P>
Because they flower profusely when only a foot tall, and because their branches 
and leaves are so light and airy, many gardeners must assume that what they've 
bought is going to be a small shrub. But, figure 10 feet tall, and as big 
around, for most. A few will even assume small tree proportions in time. 
</P>
<P>
This is no reason not to plant them, just give them room to grow. They are 
particularly attractive against the walls of a house, which shows off their 
delicate structure, but don't put them in front of windows or too close to 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
They are also handsome in front of taller, dark-green shrubs with larger 
leaves, and in front of dark fences. They are not much of a screen since they 
are not dense. 
</P>
<P>
In most gardens, they should be pruned every year after flowering. Pruning 
helps slow them down and it encourages a second round of flowers (which is why 
some appear to bloom all year). 
</P>
<P>
The flowers come on new growth, so if you cut them back, they immediately make 
new growth and then flower a few months later. 
</P>
<P>
Don't prune with a hedge shear, however. Prune by taking out entire branches 
back to a secondary branch, thereby removing enough growth to make the plant 
smaller without destroying its natural grace. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, find one branch, follow it down past two or three side branches 
and then make your cut just above another side branch that faces up or out from 
the plant. Do this to each branch until the desired effect is achieved. 
</P>
<P>
The flowering branches, incidentally, are excellent cut, lasting several days 
in a vase. 
</P>
<P>
Other than pruning, there is little to do. Leptospermums can take being watered 
along with everything else, or they can be left to fend for themselves, with 
only an occasional irrigation inland where the summers get really hot. 
</P>
<P>
The best time to plant is in the fall, or right away, so the plants are 
established by summer. Even then, they will need frequent watering the first 
summer since they do not have their roots deep in the soil yet. 
</P>
<P>
They do like a location with full sun. They are not fussy about soil, and 
require no special soil preparation, and no fertilizer in most situations. 
</P>
<P>
They just grow happily (and rapidly) and flower. And, in the middle of winter 
and in early spring, those flowers are a delight.

HOW TO CONTROL INSECTS ON ORCHIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOC ABRAHAM and KATY ABRAHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I'm growing orchids in my home and notice scale insects on the 
leaves. Is there a safe control for these? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: You can buy some Safer's Soap in your garden center and apply it 
according to label directions. Or you can mix a teaspoon of liquid dish washing 
detergent to 1 quart of water. Add 1 cup of rubbing alcohol and wash the leaves 
with the mixture. 
</P>
<P>
Use either a sponge or a soft toothbrush. The secret is to dislodge the 
insects. Periodic washing of foliage does a great job preventing infestation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ideal Dwarf Squash for Mideast Cooking 
</P>
<P>
Q: We don't have a large back yard for vegetables, but would like to grow some 
dwarf summer squash, used in Mideast cooking. Is that possible? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, anyone interested in Lebanese or Middle Eastern cooking should grow a 
summer squash known as cousa or Lebanese zucchini, ideal for stuffing. 
</P>
<P>
This variety produces heavy yields of zucchini 3 to 5 inches long -- greenish 
white fruits on compact, bushy plants. 
</P>
<P>
For just a few cents you can buy a packet of cousa squash and have enough to 
supply you all summer. You can grow the vines in a container or on a trellis, 
as well as in the ground. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fruiting Plants That Thrive Under Lights 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is there any fruiting plant in the form of either a dwarf tree or shrub that 
can be grown reasonably well in a living room under fluorescent light? 
</P>
<P>
A: There are several species of citrus that can be grown indoors if given 
sufficient artificial light. Calamondin (a cross between kumquat and sour 
mandarin orange), limequat, orangequat and kumquat itself, are good choices. 
</P>
<P>
You may want to ask for catalogues from suppliers of dwarf citrus. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trying to Find Plant That Repels Gophers 
</P>
<P>
Q: A friend told me there is a plant that repels moles and gophers. I have had 
critters in my garden and would like to try it. She cannot remember the name, 
but I thought you might have heard of it. 
</P>
<P>
A: Probably the plant you are referring to is caper spruge or Euphorbia 
lathyrus. A source for seeds is J.L. Hudson Co., Box 1058, Redwood City, Calif. 
94064. It has an irritating sap in the roots and this is believed to be the 
clue to its repellent qualities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Name That Flower That Bloomed Long 
</P>
<P>
Q: I cannot remember the name of a long-lasting cut flower that I grew in my 
garden last summer. It opened like a rosebud, changed to tulip-shaped blooms 
and finally opened fully like a poppy. Blooms came in blue, purple, pink or 
white with silvery green foliage. The label was something like "estomia" but I 
cannot find it in catalogues nor can garden store clerks help. 
</P>
<P>
A: You had a plant listed either as eustoma or lisianthus which was developed 
from wild prairie gentian. Initially, botanists listed it under Eustoma 
russellainum and also Lisianthus russelainus, so you may find it under either 
first name. As cut flowers, they can last as long as two weeks, or more.

TWO AVOCADO TREES THAT PRODUCE SUPERB FRUIT; 
</P>
<P>
FRUIT: THE NEW GWEN IS ESPECIALLY GOOD FOR SMALL GARDENS, WHILE THE REED HAS 
BEEN AROUND FOR YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SIDNAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two little-known, but marvelous avocado trees for Southland yards, the Gwen and 
the Reed, have one thing in common: They produce fruit of superb flavor and 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
The trees are quite different. The Gwen is small and well-suited to small 
yards, while the Reed, although slender, may grow up to 35 feet and requires at 
least a medium-sized yard. 
</P>
<P>
The size and shape of the fruit from the two trees is also quite different. The 
Gwen produces fruit about the size and shape of the typical Hass avocado, while 
the Reed produces huge, rounded fruit weighing more than a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Both varieties are not yet popular in the area, but a good choice for Southern 
Californians. 
</P>
<P>
The Gwen, with its small size, is more practical for most Southern California 
yards. A fairly recent introduction, it was developed by Berthold O. Bergh of 
UC Riverside. Although not yet well known, those who have planted it rave about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The tree is only about one-third of the size of a typical avocado tree, yet it 
produces huge quantities of fruit that have a magnificent rich, nutty flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Most people consider the Hass (the leading commercial variety) to be the flavor 
standard from which other avocados are judged. The Gwen produces fruit whose 
flavor equals or exceeds that of the Hass -- perhaps because the Gwen is a 
grandchild of the Hass. 
</P>
<P>
The fruit resembles that of the Hass, with its thick, pebbly skin, but unlike 
the Hass, the skin does not turn black when it ripens. 
</P>
<P>
The Gwen tree naturally grows to about 15 feet in height, but it can be kept 
even smaller because the tree has small limbs and is easy to prune. 
</P>
<P>
Production is another attribute of the Gwen, it produces huge clusters of 
fruit. Its total production is usually superior to other avocado varieties 
whose trees are much larger. The Gwen bears fruit over a long period, usually 
from April through September. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Gwen avocado is fairly new, the trees can be difficult to locate. 
</P>
<P>
Four nurseries usually stock the Gwen trees: Palos Verdes Begonia Farm in 
Torrance, (213) 378-2228; Atkins Nursery in Fallbrook, (619) 728-1610; C.P. 
Teague Nursery in Corona, (714) 735-2300, and Pacific Tree Farms in Chula Vista 
(619) 422-2400. 
</P>
<P>
A nursery can also order one from a wholesale grower such as La Verne Nursery 
in San Dimas. 
</P>
<P>
While the Gwen is new, the Reed has been around a long time. Indeed, there are 
some magnificent old specimens in Riverside yards. The tall, slim trees are 
excellent producers of softball-size fruit with an incredibly rich, buttery 
flavor. It is probably the richest flavored avocado in existence. 
</P>
<P>
Reeds take a longer time to bear than Gwen, but once established, the trees are 
reliable producers. The harvest period for Reed generally runs from July to 
September. 
</P>
<P>
Reed trees can also be difficult to locate; try the sources for Gwen trees 
listed above. 
</P>
<P>
Both Gwen and Reed are fairly frost-sensitive. Check with your local nursery 
about the climatic conditions in your particular area. If you live in the 
colder sections of the Southland's inland valleys, you should select a more 
frost-tolerant avocado variety. 
</P>
<P>
An avocado tree needs a sunny planting site that drains well. If allowed to 
stand in water, the tree will not survive. It should be kept moist, but never 
soggy. Older, mature trees will get along on a less frequent watering schedule 
than young trees. However, every fourth or fifth irrigation should be a deep 
one to wash away accumulated salt in the soil. 
</P>
<P>
In most Southern California soils the avocado tree will thrive with very little 
fertilizer. A light application of an avocado fertilizer containing chelated 
iron in the spring on a yearly basis will suffice. Always water thoroughly 
after fertilizing. 
</P>
<P>
The avocado tree requires very little pruning, other than for shape and size. 
</P>
<P>
The fruit of the avocado is harvested when it is full-sized and mature, but 
still hard. Green-skinned varieties such as the Gwen and Reed are usually 
picked when the fruit loses its shine. 
</P>
<P>
A few more tips in harvesting avocados, don't pull them from the tree by the 
stem, but use clippers and cut them off as close to the fruit as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Also, never leave the harvested fruit out in the sun because it sunburns 
easily. Allow the fruit to ripen at room temperature; this usually takes about 
a week.

For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions on what to do in the garden this 
week from the California Assn. of Nurserymen: 
</P>
<P>
Thin out the vegetable plants you may have started from seeds already to 
prevent overcrowding or stunted plants. 
</P>
<P>
Do this when they are 2 to 3 inches high. 
</P>
<P>
Give your lawn a boost this spring by starting a regular feeding program. 
</P>
<P>
"Pinch" annuals at planting time to produce bigger and better blooms later. 
</P>
<P>
Cut down on weeding time by applying mulch around plants.

CUSTOM HOUSE COST DEPENDS ON HOW FANCY YOU WANT IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Carla Lazzareschi 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What will it cost to build a custom house? There's no simple answer to this 
most-asked question. 
</P>
<P>
Your costs will be determined by a variety of factors, most notably the price 
of your lot, which experts say can account for anywhere between 25% and 40% of 
your total expense, and the level of luxury you decide to give your new digs. 
</P>
<P>
Other variables include building fees assessed by local governments, which can 
add at least 5% to the cost of a house, material costs and prevailing local 
wage scales for laborers and craft workers. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, say experts from the National Assn. of Home Builders, you can 
expect to pay a minimum of between $55 to $90 per square foot to build a new 
home today. The figure, which does not include the price of the lot or 
landscaping costs, varies according to area. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles region, the association's research chief Gopal Ahluwalia 
says, the average minimum hovers in the $75 per-square-foot range. It is lower 
in the eastern and northern stretches of the basin and higher along the 
coastline. 
</P>
<P>
The L.A. figure is roughly equal to that for Chicago and suburban New York. In 
San Francisco and New York City, the average minimum, Ahluwalia says, is nearly 
$90 per square foot, largely because higher labor costs and local fees. By 
comparison, the average minimum is $55 per square foot in Kansas City and St. 
Louis, $60 in Phoenix and $70 in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
Is there a maximum? 
</P>
<P>
Don't be silly! Of course not. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Ashley, a custom home builder in Hidden Hills is completing a nearly 
9,000-square-foot house with a 3,000-square-foot guest "cottage" in that 
community, complete with an underground racquetball court, swimming pool, 
waterfall and spa, lavish marble flooring and other luxurious touches. 
</P>
<P>
The cost? About $300 a square foot.Carla Lazzareschi

STOCK OF UNSOLD NEW HOMES RISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In another sign that the once-sizzling new-home market has cooled, the number 
of available new tract homes in the six-county Southland area rose 89% from the 
middle of 1989 to the end of the year, according to a new survey. 
</P>
<P>
The semi-annual report by the Real Estate Research Council of Southern 
California shows that there were 2,348 completed new homes that were sitting 
empty at the end of the year, up 85% from six months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Another 10,089 homes were under construction, up 90% from the midyear level. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside County accounted for 29% of the unsold homes -- both completed and 
under construction -- while Los Angeles had 20%. Orange County accounted for 
17%; San Diego County, 16%; San Bernardino, 11% and Ventura County, 7%.

SOME READINGS HELPFUL TO PROSPECTIVE HOME BUILDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are several books, pamphlets and other easily available resources 
available to anyone considering a home building project. Among there are: 
</P>
<P>
"A Consumer's Guide to Hiring an Architect": The California Board of 
Architectural Examiners, the state agency that licenses architects, offers this 
free pamphlet. The publication explains how to select and draw up a contract 
with an architect and what administrative and legal recourse you have if you 
believe that contract is broken. For a copy write to the California Board of 
Architectural Examiners, 1021 O St., Room A102, Sacramento, Calif. 94244-2580. 
</P>
<P>
"What You Should Know Before You Hire a Contractor": The California Contractors 
State License Board offers this free pamphlet. This booklet explains how to 
hire and direct a contractor. Special attention is given to how to schedule 
payments and oversee completion of the project. The pamphlet also details how 
to file complaints if the project is not completed to your satisfaction. For a 
copy, send a self-addressed mailing label to the California Contractors State 
License Board, P.O. Box 2600, Sacramento, Calif. 95826. 
</P>
<P>
The Owner Builder Center: This nonprofit educational group in Berkeley offers 
40 different classes covering home building, remodeling and maintenance. In 
addition, the center periodically sponsors a special daylong, $75 seminar in 
the San Francisco Bay Area that outlines how to contract to build a house for 
yourself. If you cannot attend the seminar, the course materials, including a 
detailed syllabus and audio tape are available for $30. For more information, 
write to the Owner Builder Center, 1250 Addison St., Berkeley, Calif. 94702, or 
call (415) 848-6860. 
</P>
<P>
"House" by Tracy Kidder (Houghton, Mifflin Co., Boston, Mass.). Kidder, a 
Pulitzer-prize winning writer, traces the construction of an actual house in 
New England from abstract concept to completion. Kidder, who sat in on meetings 
among the owners, contractor and architect, offers an insightful look at the 
often conflicting forces at play during the construction process. 
</P>
<P>
"How to Live Through Remodeling," Sunset Magazine, May, 1981. Although this 
article deals with remodeling, much of the information and advice is applicable 
to a home building project. Your local library should be able to help you 
locate the article.

RELIVING L.A.'S PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re: Sam Hall Kaplan's "To See L.A.'s Past, Visit Florida" (Feb. 25): 
</P>
<P>
I came to L.A. in February, 1961. I enjoyed breakfast at Dupars on North Vine 
Street (remember?), visited the Pantages (still standing, amazing!), viewed the 
Brown Derby (gone), and started my walk west on Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
A rainstorm the night before had transformed the skies above to a clear blue 
and white canopy but, unknown to me, had also made the "Walk of Fame" 
treacherous, and I slipped and fell somewhere near Musso &amp; Frank's (hooray 
for Hollywood, still standing). I thought then, and still do, their 
installation was a disastrous idea. 
</P>
<P>
I fell in love with the area, even though I easily detected signs of decay. But 
I reassured myself that surely the city of Los Angeles realized its economic 
and historical importance, and assistance to improve the area was on its way. 
</P>
<P>
Today I realize fully how young and naive I was on that day I first met the 
middle-aged and tawdry Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
I share Kaplan's heartsick feelings (and outrage) to the extent I deliberately 
go out of my way to avoid looking at it and thinking what might have been. 
</P>
<P>
I am not speaking exclusively of the Hollywood area. 
</P>
<P>
This city of ours, because of its comparative youth and climate, scads of 
creative people and great wealth should have evolved into one of the great 
beauties of the world. Alas, she has not grown old gracefully. 
</P>
<P>
To start some reconstructive surgery, couldn't we begin by removing all of the 
cancerous billboards?

ROBERT BRUSS REPLIES: 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the March 4 Letters, Todd P. Silverstein and Dorothy E. Fiering wrote to 
disagree with my article and that of Benny L. Kass on Feb. 11 in which we said 
that loan fee points paid to obtain a refinanced mortgage must be amortized 
(deducted) over the life of the mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
Silverstein said loan fees paid to obtain refinancing are deductible if paid by 
separate check. 
</P>
<P>
His information disagrees with IRS Revenue Rulings 86-68, 87-15 and 87-22, 
which say that the IRS does not allow a current deduction for points on a 
refinanced mortgage, and such loan fees can only be deducted over the life of 
the loan. 
</P>
<P>
Fiering correctly emphasized that if the purpose of the refinanced home loan is 
to pay for home improvements, then the portion of the points allocable to the 
improvement cost is deductible.

FIELD OF DREAMS; 
</P>
<P>
SAVORING THE HEARTLAND IN IOWA'S GREAT AMERICAN BIKE RIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. LOVETT, Richard A. Lovett is a free-lance writer living in 
Corvallis, Ore. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A hot, muggy day in late July, pedaling with 7,500 other bicyclists, is not the 
best time to come face to face with one of the little-known facts about the 
Hawkeye State: Iowa is not flat. 
</P>
<P>
Portions of it are decidedly hilly -- a roller coaster endlessly undulating 
eastward from the Missouri River, 50 to 100 feet up and down. Over and over 
again. 
</P>
<P>
As if the topography isn't bumpy enough, the people who built the roads 
undoubtedly had cyclist torture in mind when they carved a path in straight 
lines across every bounce and wrinkle. 
</P>
<P>
From each hilltop, all that is visible is more hills, with the next town 
sitting atop the highest one in sight, a beacon shimmering in a mid-afternoon 
field of dreams. 
</P>
<P>
So why would any reasonably well-adjusted adult want to go on such an 
excursion? For the honor of taking part in the annual bicycling pilgrimage 
across Iowa: an exercise in pain, heat exhaustion and camaraderie known 
affectionately as "RAGBRAI." 
</P>
<P>
The journey runs for seven days during the last full week in July, beginning on 
Sunday with a ceremonial dunking of rear wheels in the Missouri River, and 
ending a week later with another ceremonial dunking, this time of front wheels 
in the Mississippi River. It is so wildly popular that admission is by lottery 
and the entry cut-off date is set months ahead at April 1. 
</P>
<P>
The not particularly poetic term RAGBRAI (pronounced rag-bry) stands for (The 
Des Moines) Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Now in its 18th year, the ride is an Iowa institution that has put the state on 
the map for cyclists throughout the nation, and has spawned dozens of 
imitations from Oregon to Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
It began unpretentiously when one columnist for the Register challenged another 
to get back in touch with the "real" Iowa by bicycling across the state. The 
challenge was accepted, and the two writers invited their readers to join in. 
</P>
<P>
Much to their surprise, 300 people showed up. The next year the number was more 
than 2,500. Within a few years, participation was limited to 7,500. 
</P>
<P>
The concept is simple. For a nominal fee -- this year it's $50 -- riders get 
maps, emergency services, traffic control, free camping and baggage trucks. 
Because the goal is to see the "real" Iowa, overnight stops are generally in 
towns so small that the arrival of the army-size caravan of cyclists, armed 
with accompanying support personnel, often doubles or triples their 
populations. 
</P>
<P>
Motels become scarce, but there are bumper crops of county fairgrounds, high 
school lawns and front yards of courageous residents that spring into mammoth 
tent cities overnight, then melt away with the dawn. 
</P>
<P>
Some cyclists even have family or friends accompany them in RVs, so that they 
can rough it by day without having to suffer the indignities of camping by 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Each day, dozens of vans carrying spare parts and bike mechanics comb the 
course, ready to perform bicycle surgery ranging from fixing flats to 
rebuilding bearings. 
</P>
<P>
Padded seat covers sell like bottled water after an earthquake. Corn fields 
double as restrooms. A comedian farmer marks one side of the road "His," the 
other side "Hers." On occasion, a truly generous community will offer free beer 
to everybody. 
</P>
<P>
The entire state loves RAGBRAI. The route changes each year, so many towns get 
to share in the fun. Farmers quit work to sit on their lawns, watching the 
endless stream of cyclists flow by on the quiet county roads that make Iowa 
perfect for this event. 
</P>
<P>
The route for each year's RAGBRAI is a closely guarded secret until it is 
announced in February. This year, cyclists are lucky. The 495-mile route is 
relatively flat. 
</P>
<P>
At the overnight stops, community groups and churches compete to offer the most 
tasty dinners, which average about $5, while other groups turn each day's route 
into a succession of food stops, from bake sales to homemade ice cream to pork 
burgers to watermelon. 
</P>
<P>
It is no surprise that RAGBRAI has been referred to as "The Thing That Ate 
Iowa." Hungry riders can easily eat up $10 to $20 a day, munching their way 
across the state. 
</P>
<P>
Many participants have noted that it is difficult to lose weight on an outing 
that by all logic should leave them Jane Fonda fit. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it is more than mere money that motivates such fanfare, although there 
is enough monetary reward that small towns begin competing a year ahead for the 
privilege of being overnight stops. 
</P>
<P>
More than that, the statewide interest in RAGBRAI seems to stem from a desire 
to be part of a spectacle of thousands of people in motion. 
</P>
<P>
For cyclists, the drawing card is likewise being part of the event. It doesn't 
matter where they are heading, but simply that they are going. 
</P>
<P>
In many respects, RAGBRAI is a reflection of our mobile society. Fifteen miles 
into a day, for example, you might meet someone you like. 
</P>
<P>
You chat for five miles, then, by conscious choice or an eddy in the pack, you 
separate. You are alone again. You put down new roots, talking to the next 
rider of suitably matched ability. 
</P>
<P>
Again, you separate. As in life, people who meet on the road seldom ride a 
dozen miles together. 
</P>
<P>
Put that way, it sounds a bit depressing. But RAGBRAI is, for a short time, a 
small universe. Even with 7,500 participants, after a few days you begin to 
repeat people. 
</P>
<P>
Someone you haven't seen for three days will shout your name with enthusiasm. 
Another will invite you to join him for dinner. "Small-world" stories abound. 
</P>
<P>
This is RAGBRAI at its best: a free-form existence with friendships that ebb 
and flow in surprising patterns until eventually you develop a kinship with the 
entire group that may be nearly as strong as your kinship with specific 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
It is also a refreshingly simple life. All you need to worry about is keeping 
the body and the machine running. 
</P>
<P>
There is no need for route planning, no need to worry about food or water. 
There are few cars. (The Register publishes the route each day and warns 
drivers away. A contingent of state troopers polices the route to aid in 
traffic control.) 
</P>
<P>
If your body is up to it, it is relaxing and simple -- life from the road 
shoulder rather than life in the fast lane. 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly, there can be a tendency toward rowdiness, though ride organizers 
have done much to control this in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
But if you want a quiet night's sleep, the best bet is to pack your gear into a 
small bag -- something you can carry on your bicycle -- so that without 
unnecessary sweat you can put distance between your campsite and the densest 
crowd, which tends to huddle timidly within a few hundred yards of the baggage 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Eating also can be a challenge. Restaurants and cafes are usually packed with 
cyclists who line up out the door. Food lines for church and service-club 
dinners can mean one-hour waits. Some try to beat the lines by assembling for 
dinner absurdly early; others wait until nearly dark, hoping that there will be 
at least a few crumbs left to nibble. 
</P>
<P>
But the greatest test may be to gain a place among the cyclists. It is highly 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
To obtain an application, call Lois Peterson, the Register's special-events 
coordinator, at (515) 284-8282 or send a business-size, self-addressed, stamped 
envelope to RAGBRAI, P.O. Box 622, Des Moines, Iowa 50303. Applications must be 
returned postmarked no later than April 1 to be eligible for the lottery that 
will select the 7,500 people for this year's ride. 
</P>
<P>
Riders wishing to be accompanied by personal support vehicles, such as RVs, 
must obtain vehicle passes. The application package will explain the procedure 
for obtaining them. In previous treks, passes have been limited to 500 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
So if you picture Iowa as nothing but boring flatland and cornfields -- no 
place to take a vacation -- here's your opportunity to discover the truth of 
the state in those fields of dreams.

HOTELS: BIG WINNERS OF THE AMENITY WARS ARE GUESTS, WHO CAN BE TREATED TO

THE SITUATION HAS GOTTEN TRULY OUT OF HAND.

<TEXT>
<P>
Recently, when I checked into a hotel room, I was confronted with nothing less 
than a combination drug and fashion store. 
</P>
<P>
On the bed was a large bathrobe. Near it were terry-cloth slippers. A note 
advised me that jogging shoes were available in my size if I needed them. 
</P>
<P>
On the bathroom counter was a virtual pharmacy: three kinds of soap, bath oil, 
shampoo, conditioner, a hair dryer, suntan oil, hand lotion. There were also 
bath beads, Q-tips, toothpaste, mouthwash, soap flakes and even a shower mitt. 
</P>
<P>
And to think I had bothered to pack! 
</P>
<P>
About the only thing missing was the inevitable plastic shoe horn. (Later, I 
found it -- an expensive brass model, hanging in the guest closet, next to the 
flannel shoe bags.) 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the one-upmanship world of hotel amenity wars, as hotels throughout 
the world try to gain your loyalty by showering you (sometimes literally) with 
goodies. There seems to be no middle ground when it comes to amenities. Most 
hotels either provide too many items . . . or too few. 
</P>
<P>
Many mid-priced hotel bathrooms contain the bare minimum -- a glass wrapped in 
plastic, an ice bucket, two small bath towels, two hand towels and, instead of 
designer soaps, small cakes of generic soap. 
</P>
<P>
But some upper-scale hotels provide everything from bath beads and cotton balls 
to bottles of cologne. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just too much," said Nicholas Rettie, general manager of the Athenaeum 
Hotel in London. "The biggest mistake many hotels make is that they lose 
perspective when it comes to amenities. We're in the service business, not the 
amenities business. 
</P>
<P>
"And certainly we're not in the perfume and cosmetics business. People come to 
a hotel for service, not to take home giveaway items." 
</P>
<P>
However, there are hotel amenities that do make sense. 
</P>
<P>
Budgetel Inns offers free continental-breakfast room service to guests at each 
of its 72 locations. 
</P>
<P>
Some hotels, like the Four Seasons in Los Angeles, put fax machines in guest 
rooms. Others lend guests free videotapes. 
</P>
<P>
The Heathman Hotel in Portland, Ore., gives guests sweatproof jogging maps and 
ID holders that can be laced into running shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Other hotels keep a full supply of amenities for women travelers. The Mandarin 
Oriental in Hong Kong offers an amenity kit that includes a nightgown, sewing 
kit, panties, panty hose, hairbrush and extra tissue paper. The hotel also 
provides heated hair rollers on request, and has a full-time seamstress 
available. 
</P>
<P>
Some amenities can only be defined as special touches: In Australia, the Regent 
of Melbourne gives each guest a little bottle of Australian champagne every 
night. 
</P>
<P>
In Honolulu, the Halekulani gives each guest a different sea shell every night 
upon turndown. And a host of hotels have replaced the traditional mint on the 
pillow with chocolate chip cookies and milk. 
</P>
<P>
There have also been some failed amenities. "Wall-mounted hair dryers are a 
disaster," said Raymond Bickson, general manager of The Mark in New York City. 
"You can never control their speed, and they always seem to be placed in the 
most awkward positions, so you have to be Houdini to dry your hair. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, any amenity that's mounted is a failed amenity. If you need to mount 
or bolt a night table lamp, remote control for a TV -- I've even seen a 
corkscrew that was chained to the wall -- then it doesn't belong in a guest 
room. It's an insulting amenity." 
</P>
<P>
Still, an amenities debate is raging within the hotel industry. To what extent 
do amenities provide a necessary service or that special added touch, or to 
what extent are amenities a needless and overly expensive exercise in waste? 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly share the blame," Darryl Hartley-Leonard, president of Hyatt 
Hotels, said in a recent speech. "We started an amenities war in 1967, when we 
bought the Hyatt Regency Atlanta, and that has culminated in amenity packages 
that cost up to $20 per room for commercial hotels and up to $60 per room for 
resorts. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, soaps, shampoos, conditioners, bath gels and bathrobes aren't extras 
anymore. They are expected by our guests." 
</P>
<P>
But what else is now expected? Beyond the obvious items, a hotel amenity 
package often includes items guests can take home with them, products they 
would normally bring from home anyway, and items that they actually use while 
at the hotel which they might otherwise buy. 
</P>
<P>
"Amenities have truly gotten out of hand," said Rudolf Greiner, president of 
Regent Hotels. "So much of it is just garbage, or it simply insults the guest. 
Then there are some hotels that give guests a bathrobe, which is displayed 
proudly on each bed. 
</P>
<P>
"Why? Would you put a bathrobe on a bed, with a note in the pocket telling 
guests that they can buy it? Are you supposed to boast that your hotel has 
bathrobes? Are you in the business of selling bathrobes? 
</P>
<P>
"No. Guests expect to find bathrobes in the bathroom. We look at bathrobes as . 
. . standard operating equipment these days." 
</P>
<P>
Stan Bromley, regional vice president and general manager of the Four Season 
Hotel in Washington, agrees. "Amenities that are obviously wasteful may get a 
guest's attention, but ultimately not in a positive way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should a hotel put an expensive bottle of cologne in a guest room when you 
already know the guest will be bringing his own? Chances are he won't even like 
your choice." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, this new soap opera can be expensive for both hotels and guests. Each 
hotel does extensive price breakdowns and cost projections on guest amenities, 
and the figures can be staggering. 
</P>
<P>
The number of amenity items in a regular hotel room might surprise you, ranging 
from matchbooks and pens, notepads and tissues to soap and bathrobes. 
</P>
<P>
At The Mark in New York City, the amenities package includes plastic newspaper 
holders (so guests won't get their hands dirty when picking up the paper in the 
morning), mineral water, granola, bathroom scales, shoe trees, garment bags, 
bottle openers, bath salts, an array of soaps, gels, Q-tips, cotton balls and 
umbrellas, just to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
"But we don't get crazy with the amenities," said the Mark's Bickson. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no point in overdoing it," the Athenaeum's Rettie said, "because if 
you do, it might give the impression to guests that you're overcompensating on 
amenities to hide bad service." 
</P>
<P>
Location can also be a factor when a hotel selects its amenities. The 
Halekulani, for example, is on the beach at Waikiki. Therefore, the guests are 
not only supplied with the standard amenities, they also receive suntan lotion, 
washing suds to rinse out their swimsuit and plastic bags to put the wet suit 
in. Hair dryers -- another important feature for a beach hotel's guests -- are 
also in the bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Hilton developed its amenities package by studying focus groups of business 
travelers. (Added to the package: extra-gentle shampoo and mouthwash.) 
</P>
<P>
All of the amenities, bathroom goodies and conveniences may indeed be tempting, 
but remember, you're paying for it. And, at some hotels, room rates are so 
expensive that no amount of soap or chocolate is really worth the extra tariff.

ADVENTURE TRAVEL: SEEING THE REAL NEPAL THROUGH CLOUDS AND FOG 
</P>

BIRATNAGER, Nepal 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was February, and Katmandu was filled with sturdy-legged trekkers. "When you 
get to San Diego we'll show you a good time," I overheard one American tell a 
Sherpa during breakfast at Mike's, the charming garden restaurant where 
Westerners gather daily for a $2 omelet-and-muffin feast. 
</P>
<P>
It was my final city meal before starting an eight-day trek. I didn't know it 
then, but those trekkers were the last I would see until my return to Katmandu. 
Despite the surging popularity of hiking in the Himalayas, 50,000 of the 54,000 
trekkers in Nepal in 1988 headed for just two destinations -- the Everest or 
Annapurna regions. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid the hordes, six writers were joining Steve Conlon, head of Above The 
Clouds, a Massachusetts-based adventure travel company, to try a new route 
along a ridge called Milke Danda in eastern Nepal, a region just recently 
opened to trekkers by the government. 
</P>
<P>
As we flew to the city of Biratnager, from which a bus was to drive us six 
hours north to our starting point, I could not take my eyes off the thrilling 
view from the airplane window. Cho-Oyu, Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Kanchenjunga 
-- the snowy tips of some of the highest peaks on the planet poked through the 
cloud bank below us. 
</P>
<P>
I had waited 12 years to see these majestic mountains again. In 1978 I had done 
an exhausting trek. Now my excitement at returning to the Himalayas was tinged 
with nervousness. Had I trained hard enough? Would I be able to enjoy the 
views, rather than slog along, panting, my eyes staring down at my boots as I 
had the time before? 
</P>
<P>
It was night when our bus dropped us off at the end of the paved road. We had 
climbed from near sea level to 7,000 feet -- still the "hills" by Himalayan 
standards. A row of green tents beckoned. We ate a quick traditional dinner 
(including daal bhat, the rice dish that is the staple of the Nepalese diet) 
inside a candle-lit dining tent and crawled into our sleeping bags. 
</P>
<P>
Morning dawned clear and cold. Far in the distance, across row after row of 
brown hills, we could just make out the tops of Makalu and Everest. I peeked at 
the itinerary: This day would be "an easy one," Steve had written, "gentle 
uphill along the ridge . . . with the Himalayas always before us. . . ." I was 
so eager for a closer look at the mountains that I hardly noticed how steep the 
"gentle uphill" was. 
</P>
<P>
But for Nepal it was fairly easy. That's because the Himalayas are so vertical 
that they make hiking in the Sierra or Rockies seem like a stroll in Central 
Park. Nevertheless, my physical fears were unfounded. Smart companies realize 
that not everyone wants to emulate Sir Edmund Hillary; a growing number of 
treks require less than two weeks of walking and skirt the vertical climbs via 
ridge trails. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the burgeoning number of adventure travel outfits are competing to 
lure the experienced trekker back for a second or third Himalayan experience. 
Thus, unusual routes in out-of-the-way places such as Milke Danda, the 
primitive Dolpo region and the neighboring country of Bhutan, are showing up in 
more and more trekking catalogs. 
</P>
<P>
We climbed a rocky but well-worn path bordered by strands of huge rhododendron 
trees. "In the spring the whole place is red with their blossoms," remarked 
Maitalal, a Nepalese friend of Steve's. But it was not yet spring. Well before 
our lunch stop, an ominous, clammy fog rolled in, obscuring everything more 
than three feet in front of us. 
</P>
<P>
And so began what we dubbed our "In the Clouds" trek. For the next eight days 
the fog, unusual for February, enveloped the east Nepal Himalayas. It was just 
our bad luck. October through April is considered prime time, weatherwise. But 
the January "mini-monsoon," which causes fog and rain for a few days throughout 
the country in mid-winter, had arrived late. It seemed as if the mountain gods 
were pouring pea soup from the heavens. "Now I know why the book about 
Shangri-La was called 'Lost Horizon'," I wrote morosely in my diary. 
</P>
<P>
Each morning I would unzip my tent flap and see only mist, not Makalu. Frost 
carpeted the trail in the morning. The bushes were coated with rime. Wind-blown 
ice particles turned tree branches into eerie frozen feathers. At times I felt 
I could well be in North Dakota, except for the herds of yaks that wandered 
through our camp at night, the bells around their necks announcing their 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
For a mountain lover like me it was by turns depressing, surreal and comic. 
When we got to our campsite, a broad meadow, on Day 4, Steve pointed east, 
saying, "If it were clear you would see Kanchenjunga (the world's third-highest 
mountain) right over there." We dutifully stared into the blankness. 
</P>
<P>
Then at precisely 2:51 p.m. a patch of blue appeared in the sky. Something 
white was on the horizon! Was it Kanchenjunga or merely an illusion? 
</P>
<P>
I scurried up the nearest ridge for a better look. Within a minute the fog 
pulled down the curtain again. Determined to catch whatever tiny glimpses 
Mother Nature decided to offer me, I perched on a rock, scanning the void. For 
two solid hours I sat there in a trance, imagining that at any moment 
Kanchenjunga might appear through the shifting vapors. Perhaps, I thought, I 
could become a Buddhist and see the mountains with my inner eye. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, my meditation cheered me up. And as the days passed I learned that 
visiting an untrekked, unspoiled area could mean more than views. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, we were not surrounded by other tourists. One friend who had 
made an Annapurna trek told me that some campsites looked like tent cities. 
Writer Jeremy Bernstein came across a Mexican restaurant in that area, and he 
described a town in the Everest region as "crawling with trekkers of every 
size, shape and nationality." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe east Nepal soon will be overrun, too. But during our eight days we did 
not see any other trekking party. Indeed, the only Westerners we met were two 
anthropologists who were living there. 
</P>
<P>
Because I could not see the scenery I paid attention to the people. And they 
returned the favor. 
</P>
<P>
Some villages were desperately poor. (Nepal is one of the world's most 
poverty-stricken countries.) Barefoot, begrimed, coughing children huddled 
around smoky fires inside tiny wood shacks, yet their parents were consistently 
welcoming, always ready to pour us cups of tea. Not a single child tugged at 
our skirts begging for rupees, as many apparently do in areas more frequented 
by tourists. 
</P>
<P>
As we descended the ridge we saw classic scenes: water buffaloes pulling crude 
plows through terraced planting fields, women washing their beautiful long 
black hair at public water spigots. 
</P>
<P>
We saw bizarre ones, too, such as a barefoot prisoner (we were told he had 
murdered his mother) shackled to a policeman, being led on foot to the nearest 
town. At one schoolhouse we visited tiny classrooms where elementary grades 
children were learning to read. Then classes came to a halt as Steve spoke to 
the youngsters in Nepali. At another, scores of children gathered around while 
he pulled a paperback atlas from his pack and showed them where "America" is. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the village of Chainpur we strolled through the weekly market. Rural 
people, many of them women with elaborate gold rings through their noses, set 
up shop in an open-air square selling all kinds of goods: huge cakes of brown 
sugar, tasty tangerines, plastic bracelets. I bought what looked like a 
grapefruit for 2 rupees (a fraction of a penny), sliced it with my knife and 
took a bite. Surprise! It was a gigantic, very tart lemon. 
</P>
<P>
At the final campsite our Sherpa cook baked a farewell cake. In whipped egg 
whites on top was a message: "See you again." There's a good chance of that. 
The most rewarding aspect of the journey was the one I did not train for. 
Despite the fog this trek gave me a fascinating glimpse into a poor but proud 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
I had come to see the Himalayas; instead, I saw Nepal. 
</P>
<P>
Getting Here: I flew Lufthansa from New York via Frankfurt to Katmandu, a trip 
that happily avoids a night layover in the New Delhi airport. Lufthansa, 
Singapore and Thai International are among the airlines that fly from the West 
Coast to Katmandu. It is also possible to fly to Bangkok or Hong Kong and make 
connections to Katmandu. 
</P>
<P>
Documents: U.S. citizens must have a passport plus entry visa ($10), available 
from the Nepal Embassy. Call (202) 667-4550 for details. Trekkers must have a 
permit; major trekking companies will obtain one for you. 
</P>

There are numerous others companies in the United States and Katmandu. It is 
wise to comparison shop and to get personal recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Cost: Land costs of treks vary widely, as does length, level of difficulty, 
amount of luxury provided and other factors. In general, a trip with one of the 
best-known, American-based outfits runs $50 to $100 a day. Some Katmandu-based 
outfits charge considerably less. You can also bring your own gear, hire your 
own porters and guide through small Katmandu agencies, and do an independent 
trek for as little as $25 a day.

HER WORLD: THE COMMON COLD REQUIRES SPECIAL DRESSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MORGAN, Morgan is a magazine and newspaper writer living in La Jolla. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As my doctor packed for a conference in Belgium she remembered the common cold. 
Europe, after all, rides north of the United States; Brussels is on a line with 
Calgary. And this was March. 
</P>
<P>
She borrowed a heavy, hooded coat from her daughter and added woolen gloves, 
boots and muffler. 
</P>
<P>
After a few bland seasons in Southern California she had to remind herself of 
vital cold-weather accessories. 
</P>
<P>
March is a tricky month. It can be spritzy with daffodils and crocus, or leaden 
gray with clouds that chill the earth. Or both. It is a shoulder season, and 
wise travelers keep theirs covered. 
</P>
<P>
The coldest I have ever been was not in Lapland one January nor in Antarctica 
at Christmastime. In those cases I was prepared. The places where I was 
miserable enough for frozen tears were London and Hamburg. 
</P>
<P>
True, it was a winter of European gales. Also true, I had not packed for such 
intense and numbing cold -- most of it outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
In London one February night, after a performance of Verdi's "Requiem" at the 
Royal Festival Hall, a friend and I decided to walk across the dark footbridge 
over the Thames. The wind was fierce, but we figured that we could catch a taxi 
more easily on the north bank, away from the concert crowd. 
</P>
<P>
We had decided to take a cab, instead of the Waterloo tube, to go directly to 
the door of the Mayfair restaurant, where we had late-dinner reservations. 
</P>
<P>
That turned out to be foolish. Every cab that passed us had passengers. On the 
far side of the bridge we turned toward the Strand and Trafalgar Square. The 
wind whipped our faces and unwrapped my wraparound coat. 
</P>
<P>
We paused at empty bus stops and squinted at the list of routes. It would be a 
long, cold wait because of the hour and the lean Bank Holiday schedule. 
Theaters, by then, were dark. We were in a black hole between tube stations. 
</P>
<P>
I remembered a line from a London guidebook: "All buses cover the routes in 
both directions -- a fact one may well forget in the heat of the moment." 
</P>
<P>
Or in the cold of the night. 
</P>
<P>
And so we kept trudging. There was no recrimination as to who's idea it was to 
jump out of the queue back at the warmly lit concert hall. There was also 
little mirth. 
</P>
<P>
We ended up walking to the Mayfair. I never measured the distance. I do know 
that the Greenhouse restaurant in Hays Mews was about to close when we arrived. 
And that the proprietress had to untie the belt of my camel coat because my 
fingers would not work. And that my red hands clashed with the linen napkin in 
my lap. And that my face burned. 
</P>
<P>
Hamburg, by the river Elbe, was a similar tale: a walk too far on a night too 
cold in shoes too thin. There are times, often city times, when good sense 
should prevail over one's innate sense of adventure. 
</P>
<P>
To ward off deep chills I now travel with a cashmere muffler, wool gloves, long 
underwear and an Icelandic wool cap that pulls over your ears and stays on in 
the wind. 
</P>
<P>
None of these items weighs much. Each has saved my skin. 
</P>
<P>
I have a bureau drawer, however, which is proof that I have been caught short 
on the road. 
</P>
<P>
There are pebbly-tan wool gloves from a New Zealand farm outlet on South Island 
and fuzzy-red mittens knitted by blanket maker Lena Rewell in Helsinki. There 
is a pair of dove-gray and black gloves designed by Sonia Rykiel. Maybe it 
wasn't cold in Paris, but I couldn't be sure. 
</P>
<P>
The oddest pair is from the Falkland Islands Co. store in Port Stanley, the 
last clothing emporium I would see on the way to the Antarctic peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
I had packed Gore-Tex ski mittens for that bottom-of-the-world expedition but I 
wanted another pair of wool liners. The only gloves being sold in Stanley that 
December day did not have full fingers, just knuckle-length stubs of wool. 
</P>
<P>
"You wear them for fishing," a clerk said when I asked. "Or for gardening or 
any work outdoors." 
</P>
<P>
When I shifted in my parka and protested that my fingers would freeze, she 
smiled and shook her head: 
</P>
<P>
"You must remember, dear, that this is summertime."

TRIP OF THE WEEK: VISITORS, BIRDS FLOCK TO MONO LAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

writers/photographers and authors of the updated Away for a Weekend.

<P>
MONO LAKE, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has been politically controversial for quite some time. But that is only one 
reason why every year nearly as many visitors flock here as birds. 
</P>
<P>
Mono Lake also attracts sightseers who want a close look at its curious calcium 
carbonate formations called tufa (pronounced too-fah) that were made when 
freshwater springs forced themselves up through the salty lake water to create 
white limestone towers. 
</P>
<P>
 While the oddly-shaped towers once were underwater, some now are on dry land 
and others peek above the lake's shrinking water level. They have been revealed 
as the lake's water level drops; something that has been occurring at an 
alarming rate since 1941, when the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power 
began diverting streams that feed the lake to Southern California to quench Los 
Angeles' increasing thirst. 
</P>
<P>
The first of about 50,000 California gulls have begun winging their way from 
the coast over the Sierra Nevada to nest at Mono Lake near the 
California-Nevada border. In spring and summer it becomes the state's largest 
rookery for sea gulls, one of more than 70 bird species that visit the lake. 
</P>
<P>
Yet that charming characteristic of Mono Lake also is in danger as changes in 
the ecosystem threaten the habitat that for centuries has been a nesting ground 
for birds. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 700,000 years salt and other minerals flowed into the lake 
through the freshwater streams, but since the streams began being diverted in 
the 1940s the lake level has dropped as much as 50 feet and its salinity has 
increased greatly. This increasing salinity is threatening the food chain that 
feeds the birds and thus the survival of the migrating birds. 
</P>
<P>
This has given ammunition to the long-standing battle between DWP and 
environmentalists over water rights versus preservation of the lake and its 
delicate ecological balance. 
</P>
<P>
And Mono Lake's future continues to be debated in the courts. Most recently, in 
1989 the courts ordered DWP to raise the level of the water in the lake by 
restoring water flow from four streams that feed it. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982 the Mono Lake Tufa State Reserve was established to protect the lake 
shore's natural features. Soon after that Congress designated the area the 
first National Forest Scenic Area in an effort to protect Mono Basin's natural 
and scenic resources. 
</P>
<P>
To find out more about the lake's endangered ecosystem, take a 1 1/2-hour 
weekend walk led by a ranger/naturalist from the U.S. Forest Service. Wear 
comfortable shoes and take binoculars. During summer it is a good idea to also 
take drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
Walks begin at 1 p.m. every Saturday and Sunday at the South Tufa Area of the 
reserve. You also can tour the area on your own with a 50-cent guide map 
available in a box at the site. 
</P>
<P>
Or follow the signs along the one-mile Mark Twain Scenic Tufa Trail nature 
walk. The signs also carry quotes from Twain's popular book, "Roughing It," 
which included his observations about Mono Lake when he explored its shores in 
1863. 
</P>
<P>
Make your headquarters the friendly roadside hamlet of Lee Vining. 
</P>
<P>
Drive there from Los Angeles by heading north on Interstate 5 and California 
14, or east and north on Interstates 10 and 15, to join U.S. 395 flanking the 
eastern Sierra range. About 20 miles beyond the turnoff to Mammoth Lakes, turn 
right on California 120 and follow signs to the South Tufa Area at the edge of 
Mono Lake. 
</P>
<P>
While no fish live in salty Mono Lake, the lake is teeming with life. 
</P>
<P>
In winter, blooming algae color the lake a vibrant green and feed tiny brine 
shrimp and brine flies which, in turn, attract thousands of birds including 
gulls and snowy plovers that arrive to nest around the shore. 
</P>
<P>
Even more spectacular is the midsummer migration of about 150,000 red-necked 
and Wilson's phalaropes, followed by the arrival of 800,000 eared grebes, who 
dive for the brine shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
The lake also is popular with swimmers who enjoy the buoyant lake water that is 
2 1/2 times saltier than the oceans. 
</P>
<P>
Don't forget to visit Panum Crater, one of 21 volcanic cones at the south edge 
of Mono Lake that form the youngest mountain range in North America. 
</P>
<P>
Panum Crater, one of the most accessible of the craters, offers a spectacular 
view of the chain of other Mono craters, as well as of Mono Lake, the 
third-largest lake in the state. 
</P>
<P>
If traveling from the South Tufa Area to Lee Vining, detour off California 120 
at the sign to Panum Crater. 
</P>
<P>
A trail leads up to the rim of this volcano, which erupted 600 years ago and 
left a layer of dark-gray pumice around its cone. 
</P>
<P>
Get to the visitor center, a mini-museum and office of the Mono Lake committee 
to save the ancient inland sea, by returning to U.S. 395 and continuing north 
about five miles to Lee Vining. The center is two doors beyond Nicely's 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors can see a 20-minute slide show about the Mono Basin. An aquarium 
contains live brine shrimp and birds of the area are on display. 
</P>
<P>
The center also has an excellent selection of nature posters and books, 
including guides to birds, animals, trees and other plants and trails. 
</P>
<P>
And Mono Lake brochures and guidebooks describe other tufa areas. One is only a 
few miles north of town on a side road from U.S. 395 to Mono Lake County Park, 
where a boardwalk leads through a marsh to tufas on the north shore. 
</P>
<P>
The visitor center/tourist office is open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. The telephone 
is (619) 647-3686. They can provide information about restaurants and lodgings. 
</P>
<P>
Nicely's serves hearty fare every day (except Wednesday in winter), and 
Yosemite Trails is only open for breakfast and lunch. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-room Gateway Motel offers views of the lake. Rates for a double are from 
$35. Call (619) 647-6467 for reservations. 
</P>
<P>
The Best Western Lake View Lodge has lake views from eight of its 44 rooms. Its 
doubles are from $40, $52 after April 22. For reservations call (619) 647-6543. 
</P>
<P>
For more information about the guided tufa walks, call the U.S. Forest Service, 
(619) 647-6525. The Tufa State Reserve office is in Lee Vining, but its lone 
ranger is frequently out. 
</P>
<P>
The main USFS ranger office for Mono Lake is about two miles south of Lee 
Vining along the road to the Tioga Pass (California 120). 
</P>
<P>
Round trip from Los Angeles to Mono Lake is 666 miles.

THE TIMES SHOPPER: SWISS TRADING PLACE VENDS QUALITY 
</P>

BASEL, Switzerland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This center of intellectual achievement and cultural refinement has a history 
of progressive thought and free enterprise. It has been a trade center since 
Roman times. 
</P>
<P>
Because of this, Basel merchants have traditionally had access to the finest 
material goods from throughout Europe; a situation that continues to this day. 
This characteristic gives Basel shopping a quality unlike other cities around 
the world. While the items for sale aren't necessarily inexpensive, quality is 
the standard and it is applied to one-of-a-kind items that make excellent 
gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Situated at the intersection of Switzerland, France and Germany, Switzerland's 
second-largest city and among its richest, borrows the best from all three 
cultures. 
</P>
<P>
Further, Basel's position straddling the Rhine River, makes it Switzerland's 
only major port. 
</P>
<P>
The Spalenberg area, a reflection of the city's character, features unusual 
merchandise in an ambience of superb and subtle charm. 
</P>
<P>
Located near the Mittlere Rheinbrucke, a bridge that has spanned the Rhine 
since 1225, and the Marktplatz, a town market since the Middle Ages, the 
Spalenberg is a winding, hilly, little street with a unique selection of 
specialty shops occupying the ground floors of centuries-old buildings. Many of 
those shops specialize in gifts for the home. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some of the highlights: 
</P>
<P>
Atelier Baumgartner (No. 8) is a home decorating shop filled with contemporary 
furniture, rugs and lamps, many of which are handmade and produced either in 
limited editions or as one-of-a-kind pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Of particular interest are the easy-to-pack gift items, especially the 
collection of glass objects, including etched Swiss-made perfume bottles (from 
$35). 
</P>
<P>
Equally attractive are glass carafes in simple modern shapes (from $20) and a 
variety of vases and drinking glasses designed to suggest the smoky look of 
antique Etruscan glass (from $20 to $50 each). There are also vases that have 
been carved out of solid rock (from $23) and matching napkin rings (about $6 
each). 
</P>
<P>
Henri Robert (No. 10) rounds out the home furnishings scene with top 
luxury-label crystal, porcelain and silver. The range of merchandise includes 
French-made table settings by Bernardaud, silver platters and flatware from 
Cristofle and Lalique vases and goblets. 
</P>
<P>
Several stores can help you shop for kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
Stocklin Basel (No. 15) specializes in copper and pewter pots, pitchers, 
platters and other objects from around the world. Included are Swiss-made 
copper cooking vessels (from about $70) and Holland-made pewter platters made 
in rectangular or oval shapes and priced from about $400. 
</P>
<P>
Wohnshop Bazar (No. 25) is an outlet filled with kitchen gadgets. A wide 
variety of plastic containers (from $3), plates and platters (from $4 each), 
and bathroom and desk accessories (from $4) come in coordinated colors. 
</P>
<P>
Looking for cutlery of distinction? Toni Ottenburg Messerschmeid (No. 33) is a 
cutlery shop that was founded about 150 years ago and has been at this location 
since 1950. The shop features a wide range of distinctive table service. There 
are reproductions of antique patterns (about $8 and up per piece), including 
delicate bone-handled spoons. 
</P>
<P>
Inexpensive and easy-to-carry kitchen gifts are found at London Tea Company 
(No. 26), which stocks more than 80 types of tea, from high-grade Sumatra or 
Darjeeling to exotic China Rose or Anis. Priced from about $2 and up per 100 
grams, they are stored in huge, red, antique tins with gold lettering. Aromas 
inspire shoppers to sample a little of everything, and afterward re-order 
favorites by mail. 
</P>
<P>
For antiques, look in Bum unteren Wildenstein Antiquitaten (No. 18). There you 
will find rustic, antique Swiss farm furniture and home accessories. Everything 
in the store is at least 100 years old. Stock includes a hand-hewn chest (about 
$2,765) made in Central Switzerland during the 1650s to vintage coffee grinders 
(about $80) and pewter pitchers from the 1850s (about $125). 
</P>
<P>
It also has wooden rocking horses ($1,250 to $3,970) and huge multicompartment 
sideboards (from about $6,000). The shop offers a glimpse at life in peaceful 
Switzerland in decades past. 
</P>
<P>
Johann Wanner (No. 14) outfits customers for two seasons only: Easter and 
Christmas. For the first several months of each year, the Wanner shop 
celebrates Easter with stuffed bunnies (from $10) and straw baskets (from $6). 
</P>
<P>
The shop is then transformed into a bower of Christmas decorations and other 
delights, displayed in theme arrangements. Wanner's chocolates and Christmas 
tree ornaments ($2 and up) are made specially for the shop. The ornaments are 
hand-blown and hand-painted glass fashioned into a variety of shapes. 
</P>
<P>
While books may not furnish a house they do help make a house a home. 
</P>
<P>
Buch &amp; Kunstantiquariat (No. 29) is a tiny gallery that's crammed full of 
old prints and rare books, dating from the 14th Century to the end of the 19th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
The owners rely on extensive catalogues to help patrons locate and buy any 
title on any subject. A sale box is filled with 19th-Century decorative prints 
of landscapes, town scenes and historical events and maps, many of which are of 
old Basel, and which cost as little as $12.

ANNOYED ADVENTURER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have been what most people would call an adventure traveler for about five 
years. I've slept on a frozen river in Japan, trekked throughout Nepal and have 
been all through Europe and North America with little more than a backpack. 
</P>
<P>
So I was more than a little annoyed by Pat Halty's description of typical 
adventure travelers ("Anyone Can Go Anywhere for Outdoor Thrills," by Frank 
Riley, March 4) as adult professionals who enjoy outdoor activities but who 
want and can afford the comforts and amenities of home. 
</P>
<P>
This makes it sound as if the only people who go on these trips are Park Avenue 
yuppies who wander around the Annapurnas in Banana Republic chinos and designer 
parkas by day and hold up in Conde Nast-approved hotels by night. They want to 
play Indiana Jones for a week and then brag about it to their corporate buddies 
during happy hour at the Red Onion. Halty sounds as if she's fishing for some 
new customers with more dollers than sense. This is exactly what we don't need. 
</P>
<P>
One need only look at the terrible situation that has arisen in Katmandu in 
recent years. With more and more tourists flocking to Nepal to see Mt. Everest, 
the town has become a veritable Himalayan drugstore.

MAINLAND NOT ISLAND

<P>
More accuracy is needed in the Travel Section. Your Feb. 25 edition contained a 
photograph whose caption stated that Livorno is on the island of Elba. 
</P>
<P>
The town is, in fact, on the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
In the same edition, John Haase's article on New Zealand ("Nature Supreme in 
Bay of Islands") claims the Bay of Islands was discovered by Capt. Cook in 
1796. Not easy: the good captain died in 1779. The discovery was made, in fact, 
in 1769.

BARGAIN CORNER: DISCOUNT PASSES GOOD FOR FINNISH

<P>
Finland is offering several transportation and hotel discounts this year. 
</P>
<P>
A two-week "coach holiday ticket" entitles you to travel 1,000 kilometers (625 
miles) by motor coach. The kit includes two coupons worth 250 kilometers, four 
coupons worth 50 kilometers, two coupons valued at 100 kilometers each and 10 
coupons worth 10 kilometers. 
</P>
<P>
Using the coupons, you could, for example, make a Helsinki-Turku round-trip 
excursion, plus take a one-way ride from Helsinki to Rovaniemi, capital of 
Finnish Lapland. 
</P>
<P>
The ticket costs about $57 and has to be bought in Finland. 
</P>
<P>
If you prefer rail travel, the eight-day Finnrailpass offers unlimited travel 
on all trains for $135 first-class and $90 second-class. A 15-day pass costs 
$218 first-class and $145 second-class, while a 22-day pass is $272 and $189. 
</P>
<P>
The Eurailpass is valid in Finland, while the Scanrailpass provides unlimited 
rail travel in Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Norway. 
</P>
<P>
For air travel, you can get a 15-day Finnair "holiday ticket" that offers 
unlimited flights within Finland for $250. This pass, only available in June, 
July and August, can be bought in the United States or Finland. 
</P>
<P>
Finncheques, vouchers for accommodations at 200 hotels in 105 cities throughout 
Finland, are available during the same June-August period. The vouchers, which 
cost $36 per person, also include breakfast. The Finncheques have to be bought 
before you leave the United States.

Best Western Hotel Cheque Scandinavia vouchers also have to be bought in the 
United States for use at 10 Best Western hotels in Finland. The vouchers, valid 
from June 1 to Sept. 1, cost $32 per person and include breakfast. 
</P>

The Scandinavian Bonus Pass, good June 1 to Sept. 1, costs $24 per person and 
entitles holders to 15%-40% discounts at 32 Arctia Hotel Partners hotels in 
Finland, as well as hotels in Norway, Denmark and Sweden. The pass has to be 
bought in the United States. Because discounts are offered on a space-available 
basis, the sooner you make a reservation the better. 
</P>
<P>
While staying in the capital, Helsinki, consider getting the Helsinki Card, 
which offers unlimited transportation on city buses and trams, plus admissions 
to more than 120 attractions. The card costs $16 for one day, $21 for two days

CYCLE TOURS TAKE PRACTICE AND BRAGGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Richard A. Lovett

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A weeklong bicycle tour can either be a relaxing and joyous experience or a 
test of patience and endurance. In large measure, it depends on how you 
prepare. 
</P>
<P>
Physical training is essential. If you are planning a weeklong, 500-mile tour, 
you ought to be capable of riding close to a 100-mile day through the type of 
terrain you expect to encounter. Do not train exclusively on flats if you 
intend to ride mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there is more to preparation than simply logging miles. If you must ship 
your bike in a box, for example, it's smart to learn the art of packing it 
before 3 a.m. the night before you leave. 
</P>
<P>
Also, on a large ride, don't take luggage that looks like everyone else's. 
There are few things worse than completing a grueling day only to spend an hour 
searching for a green duffel bag that bears an inconvenient resemblance to 
7,000 other green duffels being offloaded from the transport truck. 
</P>
<P>
If food service isn't catered, take plenty of money. You'll eat more than you 
plan, and you might want to treat yourself to special dinners. 
</P>
<P>
Ride defensively and wear a helmet while you're touring. Most tour directors 
work hard to keep as far away from traffic as possible, but riding with a large 
pack of other riders can itself be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
RAGBRAI, for example, has experienced innumerable crashes, with injuries 
ranging from scrapes (in macho-cyclist terms: "road rash") to broken bones. One 
crash was fatal. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic can also be an issue. A few years ago, a rider was killed by a logging 
truck on an Arizona ride. Some rides -- particularly those in the West -- spend 
much of their time on highways. If you aren't comfortable with traffic, ask the 
tour director about route conditions before committing yourself to the event. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean, however, that bicycle touring is necessarily dangerous. 
Because of its massive size, RAGBRAI probably provides useful statistical 
information. It has had five fatalities in 17 years. Two were heart attacks. 
Two were drownings. Only one was a cycling accident. 
</P>
<P>
This means that the RAGBRAI death rate is considerably lower than the national 
average for a randomly chosen group of 7,500 people. 
</P>
<P>
So if you go, have fun. Whatever tour you take, you can be assured of three 
things: camaraderie, the enthusiasm of the local populace and, perhaps most 
importantly, an experience you can brag about. What more could you ask? Richard

RAISING THE IRON CURTAIN MEANS A CONTINENTAL SHIFT; 
</P>
<P>
GEOPOLITICS: THE FOCUS OF THE CONTINENT MOVES EAST, FROM BONN TO BERLIN, FROM 
BRUSSELS TO VIENNA. THE NEW EUROPE REGAINS BALANCE, RECLAIMS SOUL.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
German reunification and the rejection of communism by the East European 
countries will produce a shift of interest -- economic and political -- from 
the west toward the center of Europe: from Bonn to Berlin, from Brussels to 
Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
The perception of this phenomenon is growing in Western Europe; its 
repercussions could deeply change the geopolitical configuration of the 
Continent. 
</P>
<P>
From Bonn to Berlin. How can a unified Germany renounce the national, historic 
role of Berlin? This question is repeated again and again, almost obsessively, 
by my interlocutors in Bonn. Chancellor Konrad Adenauer chose Bonn as the 
capital of the Federal Republic against the wishes of many politicians who 
preferred Frankfurt. Adenauer said that the choice of a small provincial town 
would better underline the provisional character of the new capital. 
Provisional indeed, as the market quickly recognized: Real-estate prices have 
suddenly crumbled by nearly 40% in the last weeks. 
</P>
<P>
From Brussels to Vienna. If Bonn is unsure of its future as the 
politico-administrative center of Germany, then Brussels, provisional capital 
of the European Community, watches the rise of Vienna as a competitor in the 
very heart of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Liberated from communism, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, once part of the 
Austro-Hungarian Empire, look almost naturally to Vienna. Yugoslavia could 
disintegrate in the near future or considerably loosen ties between the states 
of the federation. In the meantime, Austria has again become the pole of 
attraction for Slovenia and Croatia, as it was when Vienna was the capital of 
the empire. 
</P>
<P>
Perceiving this trend, the foreign ministers of four states of the region -- 
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia and Italy -- have met routinely in recent 
months to discuss problems specific to their area. Poland, wary of a reunited 
Germany, has shown an interest in joining the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
And Vienna -- already the seat of several important international agencies and 
currently host of both the NATO-Warsaw Pact negotiations and the Helsinki 
accords talks -- is also a candidate for hosting the organization that will 
verify compliance of arms-reduction treaties. 
</P>
<P>
In time, the European Community might find that its Brussels base is so near 
the English Channel and so far from the center that at least some of its 
institutions should move eastward. 
</P>
<P>
All of this, of course, presupposes a Europe not haunted by the specter of 
German reunification, nor by a fear of Germany's hegemony -- and an upsurge of 
territorial claims. This supposes a Europe of political harmony, some degree of 
economic integration and of resolved border anxieties and ethnic tensions. At 
present no one can predict such an idyllic evolution. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the immediate concern on this side of the Atlantic is for the aftermath 
of today's elections in East Germany. Since reunification now seems likely to 
happen sooner than anyone could have predicted, the pan-European summit planned 
for later this year has been devised not to prevent the inevitable, but to slow 
reunification until the elements of a new political settlement for the two 
Germanys -- and simultaneously for Europe as a whole -- have been assembled. 
</P>
<P>
The trend is to favor a pan-European solution for the problems created by the 
collapse of the communist regimes. If the biggest of these problems -- the 
surprisingly quick pace of Germany's reunification -- can be solved in a 
pan-European framework, the Continent will regain its geographical balance, 
long subverted by the Iron Curtain. It would gravitate more toward the center, 
to the heart of Europe, thus repairing half a century's distortion. 
</P>
<P>
Two generations of Europeans, brought up in two antagonistic parts of our 
Continent, have faint knowledge of a formidable patrimony the intelligentsia of 
Prague, Budapest, Warsaw and Moscow contributed to Europe. The Russian writers, 
from Turgenev to Pushkin to Dostoevski, interpreted the desires, the anxieties, 
the deep sense of the infinite of the men and women of the entire Continent. 
</P>
<P>
They were half of our soul. 
</P>
<P>
We might recover it.

U.S., ISRAEL: IS THE PARTY ABOUT OVER? 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Three years ago I asked a colleague who worked in network television why the 
American media was so fascinated with Israel. Even then, the Israeli Cabinet 
was on the brink of collapse. Television news, along with major and minor 
newspapers, were saturated with stories and commentary about the unfolding 
events. "Israel is always a good story for us," my friend explained, "because 
you are a democracy, our strategic ally, sharing our values and have a dynamic 
political system." 
</P>
<P>
Today, another Israeli Cabinet has disintegrated and Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Shamir has lost a vote of confidence in Israel's Parliament, plunging the 
country into a search for a new government. The crisis, set off by a Bush 
Administration plan for Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, marks a historic 
watershed: Will Israel embark on the road to peace or will the countdown for a 
new war begin? 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the past, these events are not dominating U.S. air waves or receiving 
much more than perfunctory coverage in America's newspapers. This shift 
reflects a waning American interest in Israel, in particular, and in the Middle 
East, in general. The Tyndall Report, which monitors the amount of time network 
news devotes to stories, ranked the Israeli-Palestinian conflict 10th in 1989. 
The previous year it was in the top five. 
</P>
<P>
Even militarily significant defections fail to attract much media attention in 
the United States. Five months ago, the three major networks each devoted 
roughly 15 seconds of their nightly newscasts to the defection of a Syrian air 
force pilot and his MIG-23 fighter to Israel. When an Iraqi pilot landed his 
MIG-21 in Israel in August, 1966, the American media's appetite seemed 
insatiable. This shift in treatment cannot be explained by differences in the 
military-intelligence value of the defections, since there were none. 
</P>
<P>
Although signs of Americans' fading interest in Israeli affairs could be 
detected in the early 1970s, the turning point came in December, 1987, when the 
Palestinian uprising began. Israel was unrelentingly depicted in the U.S. media 
as an uninspired, oppressive force with a government that adamantly refused to 
talk peace with the Palestinians. Many Americans were shocked by the Israeli 
security forces' treatment of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
Israeli disregard for Palestinian human rights undermines the values that are 
the moral basis of Americans' attraction to Israel, the only democracy in the 
Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Talking to American friends and officials of the Reagan Administration in late 
1988, I detected a deep sense of disappointment in Israel's unwillingness to 
reciprocate for the newly moderate declarations of the Palestine Liberation 
Organization. I also sensed a growing American fatigue with the indecisiveness 
of Israeli domestic politics. Those impressions linger to this day. 
</P>
<P>
The sensational events unfolding in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, South 
Africa and Nicaragua rightly captivate the world's and America's attention. But 
sudden reconciliations in some countries also reinforce the frustration many 
Americans feel toward Israeli reactions to various Middle East peace proposals. 
Israel is seen by the U.S. media and increasingly by its most loyal American 
friend -- Congress -- as sinking deeper and deeper into its own political heart 
of darkness, most of its leaders as unmovable objects. 
</P>
<P>
Even the attitude of American Jewry, always a constant source of sympathy and 
staunch support for Israel, has undergone a major change. A recent public 
survey of Jewish leaders in the United States not only showed a sharp decrease 
in support but also a readiness (80%) to criticize Israel in public. 
</P>
<P>
Yet most Israelis are unaware of these shifting attitudes. They think and 
behave as if Ronald Reagan were still in the White House. The former President 
went farther than any predecessor to make Israelis feel secure. His 
Administration never fully protested Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982. 
Although his State Department railed against the construction of Jewish 
settlements in the occupied territories, it took no diplomatic action. The 
White House enthusiastically blessed a joint American-Israeli memorandum on 
strategic cooperation. And in the 1980s, Israel received close to $40 billion 
in economic and military aid from the United States. That kind of generosity 
and kid-glove treatment understandably leads Israelis to believe they can do no 
wrong in American eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Abundant writing is on the wall, however. President Bush and his secretary of 
state, James A. Baker III, lack their predecessors' emotional and ideological 
commitment to Israel, the heart of the alliance. Their language and deeds 
depart from past practice. 
</P>
<P>
Over Israeli protests, the Bush Administration is continuing a dialogue with 
the 
</P>
<P>
PLO. In a recent visit to Los Angeles, the President said that no new Jewish 
settlements should be built in the West Bank or in East Jerusalem. His 
inclusion of East Jerusalem was unprecedented, raising serious doubts about 
Israel's claims to sovereignty there. Earlier, Baker suggested that building 
new Jewish settlements or expanding old ones in the occupied territories must 
stop before the United States would consider guaranteeing an additional $400 
million in loans to pay for housing newly arrived Soviet Jews. 
</P>
<P>
In Congress, the movement away from Israel is no less discernible. The proposal 
by Minority Leader Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) -- to cut foreign aid for five 
countries, including Israel, by 5% -- is a case in point. I have little doubt 
that Dole's suggestion was coordinated with Baker and Bush. The senator's words 
were carefully chosen to remind Israel to get more serious about peace 
negotiations with the Palestinians. Additionally, they were an indication of 
Administration impatience with Israeli leaders. 
</P>
<P>
If my fellow Israelis do not soon recognize the gravity of this situation -- 
that unquestioning American support can no longer be assumed -- they will wake 
up one day in horror to discover what I have already detected: The party may be 
over for Israel in the United States.

Delegates to the 17th annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) 
this month were urged to support a constitutional amendment by Rep. Bill 
McCollum (R-Fla.) that would limit congressmen to six terms and senators to two 
terms. McCollum himself, now serving his fifth term, wouldn't say whether he 
would seek a seventh -- an irony that should not be allowed to obscure deeper 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
A case can surely be made for ensuring greater competitiveness in political 
campaigns and removing some of the built-in advantages enjoyed by incumbents. 
That said, it is still distressing to see so-called conservatives -- who pride 
themselves on devotion to the documents on which the republic was founded -- 
seeking to rewrite the Constitution to achieve this goal. 
</P>
<P>
It is more distressing to realize that the push to limit terms is part of a 
larger assault by right-of-center forces on the Congress itself, including 
support for a presidential line-item veto. A good chunk of the agenda at this 
year's Washington CPAC, the most significant gathering of conservative leaders 
and grass-roots activists in the nation, was devoted to lambasting what they 
have taken to call "the imperial Congress." 
</P>
<P>
After a decade of Republican Presidents and largely Democratic Congresses, 
perhaps it is understandable for Reagan-Bush Republicans to show some 
impatience with the legislative branch and a greater identification with the 
executive. It would be a serious mistake, however, to let such impulses harden 
into dogma. 
</P>
<P>
Conservatives need to remember that throughout most of our history, Congress 
was the predominant force in American government -- and this was certainly the 
case during those periods of national development that conservatives view with 
the most affection. The great change took place with the New Deal and World War 
II -- at precisely the time, in other words, when the expansion of federal 
power traditionally deplored by conservatives began to accelerate. Presidential 
power increased along with federal power; the role of Congress correspondingly 
shrunk. 
</P>
<P>
This was a development that conservatives at the time, like Sen. Robert A. Taft 
(R-Ohio), noted, denounced and struggled against. Today's conservatives, oddly, 
seem to celebrate it and resist all efforts by Congress to reassert itself. 
</P>
<P>
Angered by Democratic legislatures that have refused to bow to the will of 
Republican Presidents, conservatives -- shortsightedly -- have turned an attack 
on specific Congresses and congressmen into an attack on Congress itself. 
</P>
<P>
One example: The dispute over aid to the Nicaraguan resistence -- which led to 
the Iran-Contra affair -- was the result of a President's determination to take 
action, however strongly opposed by the House of Representatives. Conservatives 
lined up obediently behind executive power. 
</P>
<P>
The goal, ultimately, is to by-pass Congress by forging a more plebiscitary 
relationship between the presidency and the voters. 
</P>
<P>
And by dislodging incumbents, they hope to seat a Congress more immediately 
responsive to presidential direction. Yet they need look no further than one of 
their own genuine prophets, the late James Burnham, to see the danger of any 
such undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five years ago, when Congress was more powerful than it is today, 
Burnham wondered whether it would survive at all as an "active political entity 
with some measure of real power, not merely as a rubber stamp, a name and a 
ritual, or an echo of real powers lodged elsewhere." If it did not, Burnham 
warned, political liberty itself would perish. 
</P>
<P>
The trend of our time, at least in this country, is toward greater 
centralization of power in the executive branch. This trend has continued under 
Presidents of both parties, all of whom have, consciously or otherwise, worked 
toward one common aim: to transform the "people," an independent, 
self-governing community of adults, into the "masses," whose unfiltered desires 
these Presidents can embody. 
</P>
<P>
The Founders, who feared "despotism," "tyranny" and "monarchy," took pains to 
make sure it couldn't happen here. They made the separation of powers central 
to the new republic and invested the vast majority of governmental power in the 
legislative branch. 
</P>
<P>
Until fairly recently, any number of other institutions at state and local 
levels helped restrain the executive. These institutions have for the most part 
ceased to so restrain, leaving only Congress (and, at times, the courts) to 
filter the popular will and militate against expansion of presidential power. 
</P>
<P>
Conservatives -- who also pride themselves on taking the long view of things -- 
need, finally, to bear in mind that there is no guarantee that future 
Presidents will be as conservative as those elected in recent years. Someday 
the liberal Democrats will return to power, and when they do the conservatives 
will surely rue the day they began to wage war on the "imperial Congress."

China seems headed for a springtime of sensitive anniversaries and bad 
memories. At the same time, relations between the United States and the Chinese 
regime of Deng Xiaoping head for the deep freeze, as Bush Administration 
officials belatedly realize they must wait for far-reaching changes in China's 
leadership before they can even hope to restore once-close ties. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, President Bush's overtures to the Chinese leadership last year 
-- particularly his decision to dispatch National Security Adviser Brent 
Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger twice on secret 
missions to Beijing -- were a failure. They did not bring about an end to 
Chinese repression. They did not assure safe release for Chinese leading 
dissident, Fang Lizhi, now in refuge at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
And they did not set in motion a process enabling Congress and the American 
public, on one side, or the old guard in China's leadership, on the other, to 
become more accommodating. On the contrary: It can be argued that the secret 
missions served merely to accentuate fundamental disagreements between the two 
governments. In its very eagerness to prevent change, the Bush Administration 
managed to accelerate it. 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, Bush was boasting that, in the wake of Scowcroft's December 
meeting with Deng, China had toned down hard-line rhetoric against the United 
States. But in recent weeks China's rhetoric has taken on a hard edge, just as 
it did last fall. Chinese leaders continue to suggest that the United States 
has been plotting to overthrow Chinese communism through a strategy of 
"peaceful evolution." The official Chinese press has heaped abuse on U.S. 
intervention in the world, citing Bush's invasion of Panama as most recent 
example. "What right does a hegemonist that wantonly infringes on other 
countries' rights and bullies the weak by force have in prating about human 
rights?" asked one publication. 
</P>
<P>
There has been a continuation of cultural and educational exchanges, but at 
reduced levels. After months of wrangling, the two countries agreed to continue 
the Fulbright scholars' exchange program next year, but the number of people 
has been cut back by one-third. China has refused to send students abroad for 
some exchange programs, including one run by Johns Hopkins University. The 
United States is considering a possible phase-out of the once-touted program 
run by the State University of New York to teach business management to Chinese 
students in the city of Dalian. The Bush Administration was particularly 
embarrassed when the Chinese imposed new rules making it harder for students to 
study abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Now, seeking to limit the political damage, Administration officials gradually 
modify their public statements on China. Back in January, Bush and Vice 
President Dan Quayle repeatedly assured the nation that the Scowcroft mission 
had brought about important concrete results. But two weeks ago, in an 
interview with NBC's Tom Brokaw, the President admitted that "there hasn't been 
much give" from the Chinese leadership yet, and "I wish there would be more." 
</P>
<P>
In a separate TV interview, Quayle responded to a question about the 
Administration overture to China, "I will not say it's been a failure. It's 
been a disappointment . . . . China refuses to recognize reality, and that's 
freedom and democracy eventually." Those last words were probably more 
irritating and threatening to the Chinese leadership than anything said on 
Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
In private, some of the principal American architects of the once-close U.S. 
ties with China put out the word that the Chinese leadership should not hope 
for further unilateral U.S. concessions. Last month, Chinese Ambassador to the 
United States Zhu Qizhen travelled to the New Jersey home of Richard M. Nixon 
for a small dinner with the former President and some prominent American 
leaders in politics and business. According to one participant, the ambassador 
argued that now was the time for the Bush Administration to take a major new 
step in improving relations; Zhu wanted the United States to open the way for 
more and speedier World Bank loans to China. But former Democratic Party 
Chairman Robert Strauss told the ambassador that Bush had already gone as far 
as he could go without major changes in Beijing; when it comes to China, 
Strauss said, Bush has no political running room left. Nixon said he agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next few weeks, the young and disaffected in China will have a number 
of opportunities to demonstrate displeasure. Qing Ming festival occurs in early 
April, the annual Chinese commemoration of the dead -- including the hundreds, 
if not thousands, killed in the vicinity of Tian An Men Square last June. 
Throughout the spring, China will mark the anniversary of key moments in last 
year's tumultuous pro-democracy demonstrations. The leading organization of 
Chinese dissidents in France and the United States, the Federation for 
Democracy in China, has purchased a 1,140-ton ship and outfitted it with a 
radio transmitter, hoping to broadcast to the mainland from international 
waters off the Chinese coastline. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese regime will probably be able to prevent or shut down any new 
trouble in the streets. Yet new, publicized confrontations will deter any 
Chinese efforts to restore ties with the United States and other Western 
nations. The next possible battle in Congress over Administration overtures 
toward Beijing may come later this spring, when China comes up for annual 
renewal of its most-favored nation status, the trade classification assuring 
the lowest possible tariffs on exports to the United States. A change in 
China's trade status would be the most severe economic blow the United States 
could impose, short of something no one wants -- a return to the old days of a 
trade embargo. 
</P>
<P>
As it sought to defend and bolster its China policy, the Bush Administration 
has often found itself ensnarled in a series of seeming contradictions. 
Sometimes U.S. officials have insisted that Deng, now 85 and in frail health, 
is in command and still committed to reforming China. On other occasions, they 
have mourned that the Chinese leadership is so beset by divisions that no bold 
action is possible. Sometimes Administration officials have argued that China 
is as strategically important to the United States as it ever was. On other 
occasions, they acknowledge that, given the dramatic changes in Eastern Europe 
and the Soviet Union, China's strategic significance has changed. 
</P>
<P>
Coming up with a new foreign-policy rationale for the old, close ties with 
China -- a relationship forged in the Nixon era and based on shared opposition 
to the Soviet Union -- is not easy. Recently, on Capitol Hill, Eagleburger 
maintained that China is important to the United States because of the 
proliferation of missiles, nuclear weapons and chemical weapons around the 
world. That strange argument suggested that the more missiles and weapons China 
sells, the more important to the United States it will become. Meanwhile, Nixon 
himself has been pressing the argument that the United States needs China's 
help to prevent Japan from becoming a political and military superpower. Such 
talk does nothing to help U.S. ties with Japan, currently America's closest 
ally in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, Bush and the Chinese were essentially trying to see whether they 
could could repair relationships after Tian An Men. Now, it seems less 
possible. In the United States, public attitudes toward China have changed. 
Within the Chinese leadership, opinions about the United States seem to have 
changed. Both countries find it difficult to return to business as usual in a 
changing world.

SWEEPING OUT THE SWEATSHOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sweatshops may seem inevitable in a region where many immigrants need work and 
a huge garment industry needs cheap labor. But places that rob workers of their 
right to decent wages and working conditions should not be allowed to exist 
without at least some effort being made to control the abuses that occur. 
</P>
<P>
While there are many legitimate garment manufacturers and contractors, there is 
an underside to the industry that preys on workers who are either ignorant of 
their rights or afraid to speak up. If caught, some unscrupulous contractors 
consider fines merely the cost of doing business. Others simply close up shop 
and disappear, leaving workers with meaningless IOU's for back wages. And even 
though commercial home sewing is prohibited by state and federal law, there 
also are home sewers who work for a pittance. 
</P>
<P>
Even under the best of circumstances, it would be difficult to police the 
industry. A lack of money, which slows many labor investigations, won't be 
cured with a new law. Still, added tools of enforcement may be needed. In the 
wake of a series of raids on sweatshops in Los Angeles and Orange counties, 
Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) has proposed legislation that would 
make manufacturers liable for sweatshop abuses. Not surprisingly, the 
manufacturers say that would be unfair. They claim they're being dragged in 
only as "deep pockets" to pay for a bad situation they can't control, taking 
the rap for a few bad-apple contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe. But there is a lot of winking and nodding going on in the garment 
industry. It is not uncommon for manufacturers to bid one contractor against 
another, for example, ending up with a price that everyone knows can't cover 
basic wages. Joint liability would at least put them on notice that they must 
build into their own costs a fair wage for sewers. 
</P>
<P>
If manufacturers and contractors think they have better solutions than 
Hayden's, let them come to the table to present them. The proposed legislation 
at least started the discussion about new ways to address an old problem that 
will only grow worse with neglect.

ROSTENKOWSKI'S DEFICIT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "No Reason to Laugh at Rosty's Plan," editorial, March 13: 
</P>
<P>
Apparently The Times supports Rep. Dan Rostenkowski's (D-Ill.) plan to cut the 
federal deficit to zero in four years. The Times and Rostenkowski also 
supported the way our government tried to finance the (now defunct Medicare) 
catastrophic health care plan. 
</P>
<P>
God knows something has to be done about our awful national debt but why 
involve seniors and Social Security? It is a well-known fact that our 
government continually "dips" into our Social Security fund in order to support 
this debt but this doesn't seem to be enough. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Rostenkowski's proposal have merit, i.e., eliminate the "tax bubble" so 
the wealthy would pay at least as much as families who have a taxable income of 
$78,000 to $185,000. Also Rostenkowski's proposal of cutting military spending 
by 3%. But this is far too little. Because of the drastic changes in the world 
it would seem there should be far less spent for defense and a lot more made 
available for the great many domestic problems -- and without disturbing or 
involving Social Security or its recipients! 
</P>
<P>
The Times is in a splendid position to "champion" these causes but seemingly 
you feel it is in your best interest to "party" with the "better half"! How 
sad!

YUPPIE HOBOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your Jan. 24 article "It's a Jungle Out There" refers to the well-heeled Los 
Angeles "Hobo Club" members who like to hop trains. Your report omitted the 
other side of the story. 
</P>
<P>
While these yuppie hobos coming from well-heeled backgrounds may be lucky 
enough to experience what you describe as a "genuinely American form of 
folklore" without getting hurt, not everyone can say the same. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, for example, 444 people were killed while trespassing on railroad 
property. More than 1,000 others were injured -- with many suffering the loss 
of a foot or a hand or ending up in a wheelchair as a paraplegic. 
</P>
<P>
In the article, reporter Bob Pool described "the danger of jumping aboard a 
moving train, the joy of watching the scenery slide past an open boxcar door 
and the thrill of outsmarting railroad police."

MALCOLM FORBES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For all those critics of the late Malcolm Forbes' birthday bash of last year: 
He celebrated his life on his last birthday in the grand fashion that he 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
Who said that he was going to deduct his expenses anyway? He'd only have been 
following the legal guidelines set by our Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Forbes at least got twice the monetary value from the publicity throughout the 
world for his celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Forbes will be sorely missed by those who realize that he did what everyone 
with or without a lot of money wishes he could do. He did what he loved. 
</P>
<P>
Don't let anyone speak against those who know that life is for living and not 
just working.

ROSTENKOWSKI'S DEFICIT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here we go again! Rostenkowski's proposal to "freeze" Social Security benefits 
in 1991 (i.e., cancel the cost of living adjustment due that year) continues 
the shameful deception of the public that has been going on for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Society Security Trust funds are running healthy surpluses at this time, 
and the effect of the congressman's proposal will be to make them even larger. 
Then, under the phony bookkeeping used by the government, this huge sum will be 
subtracted from the budget deficit to make it appear to be smaller than it 
actually is!

TAX TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's that horrible time of year we all know as tax time again. And, as usual, I 
begin scurrying around looking for every conceivable and even a few 
inconceivable deductions. 
</P>
<P>
If only the IRS and our congressional representatives would think about the 
absurdity of the situation. Why, when a taxpayer claims on his/her W-2 form 
submitted to the employer what he/she is in fact entitled to, should that 
person then have to dig, scrounge and scrape for deductions in order to 
compensate for the government's failure to deduct the appropriate revenue from 
the beginning? 
</P>
<P>
If the IRS could just say, "OK, you claimed X dependents which you are entitled 
to and we took Y dollars from your paycheck. Thank you, we're even." 
</P>
<P>
No. It probably makes too much sense.

ROSTENKOWSKI'S DEFICIT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rostenkowski is to be commended for his courageous proposal to reduce our 
horrendous federal deficit. The key feature of his proposal is the elimination 
of the "tax bubble" raising the rate for the very wealthy from 28% to 33%. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Kuttner, writing in The Times (Op-Ed Page, Nov. 13, 1989) pointed out 
that so much red ink in our federal government comes from under-taxing our 
nation's rich. "Simply collecting the taxes that the richest 1% paid back in 
1977 would solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1988 . . . the wealthiest 1% of Americans received a record 12.5% of the 
national income, or about $450 billion. The average household in this group 
enjoyed an income of about $452,000. Simply collecting the taxes that the 
richest 1% paid way back in 1977 would wipe out half of the budget deficit." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush and former President Reagan argue that allowing our nation's 
rich to become disproportionately richer is good for our economy. 
Industrialists need the capital to expand. 
</P>
<P>
But proponents of that view have yet to explain the great boom of the 1940s, 
1950s, and 1960s when the economy enjoyed record growth and the distribution of 
income was more equal. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush is correct when he promised no new taxes. The issue isn't new 
taxes. The issue is a fair tax program. We must return to the tax program of 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
All of us must pay our fair share, the wealthy as well as the middle class and 
the poor.

COLD WAR: GORBACHEV'S RUSSIA MAY STRUGGLE TO LOOK MORE LIKE THE AMERICA OF ITS 
LINCOLNESQUE OR ROOSEVELTIAN DREAMS; GEORGE BUSH'S AMERICA RESEMBLES MORE AND 
MORE CZARIST RUSSIA.

By ROGER MORRIS, Roger Morris is the author of Richard Milhouse Nixon: The Rise 
of an American Politician, 1913-1952, (Henry Holt &amp; Co.), the first of a 
three-volume biography. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Crossing Poland with the first U.S. diplomatic mission to the Soviet Union in 
the winter of 1933, a young American diplomat named George Kennan was somewhat 
astonished to hear their Soviet escort, Foreign Minister Maxim Litvinov, 
reminisce about growing up in a village nearby, about the books he had read and 
his dreams as a small boy of being a librarian. 
</P>
<P>
"We suddenly realized, or at least I did, that these people we were dealing 
with were human beings like ourselves," Kennan wrote, "that they had been born 
somewhere, that they had their childhood ambitions as we had." 
</P>
<P>
It was a fleeting moment in the long ordeal of the two nations' great rivalry. 
By postwar 1946-47, Kennan was to provide an already hardening American policy 
its permanent principle of "containment," to confront "at every point" what was 
seen as the implacable expansion of the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
If Kennan himself later fretted about the overzealous adoption, even abuse of 
his views, about his own "careless and indiscriminate language," no one seemed 
to notice. A U.S. arsenal of 13 atomic bombs in 1947 grew ineluctably over the 
next four decades into thousands of nuclear warheads, a $300-billion military 
budget, a secret Pentagon "slush fund" bigger than national expenditures for 
transportation or food and nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
It is a still half-hidden record worth pondering as President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev careens through his end-of-century revolution in Soviet and world 
politics -- a sweep of change like no other in history. 
</P>
<P>
The Cold War is over and we have won, our politicians now tell us. But at what 
price, with what sort of victory? 
</P>
<P>
It turns out that the "dent in the problem" came far less from anything 
Washington did -- including a crushing arms race in which Moscow contorted 
itself to keep pace -- than from what happened inside the Soviet Union itself. 
Ironically, it was something of the worst and the best of the Soviets' poisoned 
experiment with Marxism that finally triggered the upheaval -- in part the 
aftershock of their own military-political folly in Afghanistan, in part the 
irrepressible force of a vast nation sent to school as well as suppressed, 
educated in ancient ideals amid a too hypocritical reality. 
</P>
<P>
That we did not see earlier and more clearly the inner politics of the revolt, 
the roiling within the Soviet elite that began as far back as the 1960s, was a 
major failure of U.S. intelligence and journalism and something of an emblem of 
our deeply vested interest in the old enemy, the old game. 
</P>
<P>
The result, in any case, is going to be a far more complex, intricate world. A 
powerful new Europe and Asian rim, with their resurgent Germany and Japan, 
their erupting nationalisms just beneath the multinational surface, may 
challenge our statesmanship in ways that will make us envy George Kennan and 
his Cold Warriors. For the United States, the premium will be on precisely the 
kind of diplomacy and intelligence that has been most rare in the last 45 years 
-- genuine knowledge and sensibility about foreign cultures without cant, 
reckonings of national interest before bureaucratic advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in the end, upheaval or no, the old, enduring problem of both the American 
and Russian revolutions will remain: How to nurture and sustain a free society? 
Here the cost and paradox of victory are most bitter. If we only are left 
standing in the ring, we are also equally alone among the wealthy developed 
societies in our relative failure of social responsibility, with so many in 
want, so many without adequate health care, education, security. The winner of 
the Cold War trails Botswana and Albania in inoculations of its children, has 
millions more homeless than when it broke the Berlin blockade, suffers as much 
of its population in poverty and despair as in 1947, ends the contest with the 
top 1% of its rich owning more of the national wealth than at any moment since 
1917. Gorbachev's Russia may struggle to look more like the America of its 
Lincolnesque or Rooseveltian dreams; George Bush's America resembles more and 
more czarist Russia. 
</P>
<P>
Glasnost has yet to come to a White House unwilling to face the undemocratic 
concentration of power in American life, the pervasive corruption of money in 
our politics, the loss of the ethical Cold War to greed. It may yet take 
another Soviet menace to turn the tide, the specter of a fundamentally wealthy, 
gifted Russia whose true might is freed by a democratic process, while keeping 
its most humane legacies. The crowds in Red Square and at the Berlin Wall are 
deploring totalitarianism, after all, not universal education, the right to 
health services, child care, reasonable rents, affordable culture, the absence 
of Donald Trump or Lee Atwater. 
</P>
<P>
More severe than any foreign threat, the adversary in that confrontation would 
be our own ideals. At the close of the Cold War, as at the beginning, we are in 
danger of losing the peace.

show. Paul Coury, 38, of Mt. 
</P>
<P>
Lebanon, Pa., was arrested Friday at his electronics rental business in 
Riverside, police said. He is a suspect in Pittsburgh-area robberies in 1986 
and 1987. Pittsburgh Detective James Holliday said the break in the case came 
last weekend when the nationally syndicated program "Crimestoppers" ran a 
feature on Coury and showed a picture of his face. The program airs in 
Pittsburgh and dozens of viewers called Holliday. One man identified Coury as a 
man at the rental business using an alias of Steve Pierce. Coury also is wanted 
for robbery in West Virginia, authorities said, and was a suspect in an arson 
that destroyed a pizza shop he owned.

Skippy, a 7-year-old red kangaroo from the San Francisco Zoo that received a 
pacemaker during a first-of-its-kind operation earlier this month, has died. 
</P>
<P>
Zoo officials said the animal died Wednesday at UC Davis Veterinary Hospital, 
where she had been transferred after the March 5 surgery. A team of 
cardiologists led by Dr. John Langbert of the UC San Francisco Medical School 
performed the operation. "We had done everything we could here," said San 
Francisco Zoo Director Phil Arnold, "but Skippy's energy had not returned and 
she was not responding to medical care, so we asked for help." Arnold said that 
even with the pacemaker, Skippy's heart contractions weren't strong enough to 
move blood through her body.

INVENTOR HAD WARNED TASER UNSAFE FOR CARDIAC PATIENTS; 
</P>
<P>
WEAPONS: CORONERS IN LOS ANGELES AND SANTA CLARA COUNTIES SAY THE STUN GUN 
CONTRIBUTED TO OR CAUSED THREE DEATHS. TWO OF THE VICTIMS HAD HEART DISEASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Distributors of the Taser stun gun used by hundreds of police agencies, 
including the Ventura Police Department, for years have marketed the weapon as 
a non-lethal alternative to nightsticks and firearms that is safe for use on 
cardiac patients. 
</P>
<P>
However, a document filed 15 years ago with a federal agency by the weapon's 
inventor says that the 50,000-volt Taser poses a special threat to people with 
heart ailments. 
</P>
<P>
And, according to coroners in Los Angeles and Santa Clara counties, the weapon 
has either caused or contributed to the deaths of three people, two of whom had 
heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
The question of whether Taser guns should be used on people with heart problems 
was raised last month when a cardiac patient at Ventura County Medical Center 
died after being shocked by Ventura police with Taser and Nova stun guns. 
</P>
<P>
Police say they responded when 24-year-old Duane Johnson, who had a history of 
psychiatric problems, began throwing himself into windows and walls after being 
told that he would be transferred to a nearby mental health facility. 
</P>
<P>
Police acknowledge jolting Johnson four times -- once with the Nova gun during 
the initial struggle -- and three times later, with the Taser, to stop him from 
grabbing at people and to force him to submit to handcuffing. 
</P>
<P>
Two mental-health workers who witnessed the incident have told county 
investigators that Johnson, a muscular former athlete, was shocked seven to 11 
times, including several times after he was subdued and posed no threat to 
others, according to a coroner's report. 
</P>
<P>
Coroner F. Warren Lovell has not yet determined the cause of Johnson's death, 
but the circumstances surrounding the Feb. 13 incident have prompted Lovell to 
say that police training is an issue in the case. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say these weapons aren't safe," Lovell said. Police officers should "use 
them to protect life and to reduce injury, but be careful. I think these 
officers read the manual that's given out, and they think these things are 
entirely safe." 
</P>
<P>
Randall Feltman, county mental health director, said in an interview that the 
use of stun guns on Johnson raises "a question about the instruction police 
officers get in relation to these weapons. If they think there's no risk, they 
will use them more liberally." 
</P>
<P>
A Ventura police spokesman said that Taser and Nova training manuals given to 
the Ventura Police Department contain no warning about the weapons' use on 
heart patients or on anyone else. The only admonition is not to apply them to 
the face, head or genitals, Lt. Michael Tracy said. 
</P>
<P>
Department policy allows officers to use the weapons to control people who pose 
a threat to officers or to the public, Tracy said. They also can be used to 
force people to comply with officers' instructions, such as in the Johnson 
case, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But warnings may not have made a difference for Johnson anyway, since Tracy 
said officers were not aware that he had a heart problem, despite his presence 
in a ward occupied mostly by cardiac patients. 
</P>
<P>
The Taser -- a flashlight-size device that shoots darts and trailing electrical 
wires up to 14 feet or can shock with two long antenna pressed to the skin -- 
is used by Ventura police about once a month, Tracy estimated. The same is true 
of the smaller Nova weapon, whose two tiny exposed points are applied to the 
skin, he said. 
</P>
<P>
None of the other law enforcement agencies in Ventura County use the Taser, 
though Oxnard and Port Hueneme have supplied Nova guns to their police. A 
spokesman for the Taser's manufacturer said 267 police agencies nationwide use 
the weapon. Nova Technologies Inc. of Austin, Tex., supplies about 450 police 
departments in this country and 800 worldwide, spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
The Nova can also be purchased for less than $100 over the counter at gun 
shops. A number of other stun guns similar to the Nova are also available to 
the public. But the Taser, which costs about $300, is sold only to police. 
</P>
<P>
Taser and Nova weapons have similar power and circuitry, and the manufacturers 
of both weapons are licensed by inventor Jack Cover, whose patented technology 
they use, Cover said. The weapons, he said, produce about three watts of power, 
enough to light a Christmas tree bulb. 
</P>
<P>
It was Cover, manufacturer of the Taser for more than a decade, whose summary 
of the weapon was submitted to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission in 
1975. Cover stated in that report that years of studies and tests had shown 
that the Taser "is non-lethal . . . to normally healthy people." 
</P>
<P>
"However, it must be emphasized that neither this feature nor the noninjury or 
no-harmful-after-effect aspect can ever be guaranteed," Cover wrote. "There is 
no weapon, technique or procedure for subduing, constraining or dispersing that 
does not involve some risk of injury to healthy persons or of death, especially 
if the individual has a heart ailment." 
</P>
<P>
Based partly on this analysis by Cover, the product safety commission's deputy 
medical director, Dr. Leo T. Duffy, declared the Taser non-lethal when "used as 
directed on the average, healthy adult." He described the gun as a "dangerous 
weapon," but said it had only a fraction of the power necessary to shock the 
heart into losing its rhythm and causing death. 
</P>
<P>
"This safety margin would be diminished in a person who has existing 
cardiovascular disease," Duffy noted. And it would be decreased even more, he 
said, if the Taser were applied to a person for a prolonged period. Children 
and the elderly, along with heart patients, would be especially susceptible to 
the adverse effects of the Taser, Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
Cover, in an interview last week, said his summary of his product's potential 
negative effects "were wise words." He said, however, that he was very cautious 
in his analysis for legal reasons and that he still believes that electrical 
shocks from a Taser present no more threat to cardiac patients than the shock 
they would get if someone said "boo" to them. 
</P>
<P>
He said he emphasized the weapon's safety, even with heart patients, while 
training officers at the Los Angeles Police Department, which in 1981 became 
the first major police agency in the country to use of the weapon. 
</P>
<P>
The current primary distributor of the Taser, Adamson Uniform and Equipment of 
Costa Mesa, has been similarly aggressive in stressing the safety of the stun 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
The second page of a promotional packet Adamson has sent to potential customers 
says the weapon is "medically safe, even for individuals with heart disease or 
those using pacemakers." The 15th page of the same packet includes a summary of 
Duffy's findings for the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which incorporates 
Cover's warning about special risks to heart patients. 
</P>
<P>
Adamson, which has sold about 90% of the 1,000 Tasers built since 1987 by the 
current manufacturer, EID Laboratory of Temple City, has trained 
representatives of numerous law enforcement agencies that have purchased the 
weapon, said Jim Fraser, the distributor's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Adamson's 37-page training manual makes no mention of cardiac patients. It 
states that there is no evidence of "adverse physiological or neurological 
effects stemming purely from the electric current charge of a Taser. . . " 
Spokesmen for the manufacturers of the Taser and the Nova weapons said in 
interviews that no deaths or serious injuries have been caused by their 
weapons, and that they are safe for police officers to use on anyone. 
</P>
<P>
In situations where coroners have found that the Taser has caused or 
contributed to death, the medical examiners have not had the technical 
expertise required to make an accurate analysis, said James McNulty, president 
and owner of EID Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
Those who have died after being shocked with Tasers "have overexerted 
themselves battling with police or have taken enough PCP to cause them to die," 
McNulty said. 
</P>
<P>
The drugs and exertion are "a thousand times more likely" to have caused the 
deaths than the Taser, he said. He cited university studies that have found 
that the small amount of electricity produced by stun guns has little effect on 
the heart, even when directly applied to it. 
</P>
<P>
McNulty also said that Tasers manufactured by his firm are slightly less 
powerful than their predecessors, and that none has been used in a fatal 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
County medical examiners in Los Angeles have concluded that two men died in 
1985 and 1986 either as a direct result of being shot with Taser darts, or in 
part because of them. A coroner in San Jose also found last summer that a 
37-year-old jail inmate with a mild heart problem died when his heart failed 
because of Taser shocks he received during a struggle with officers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, use of Nova stun guns has been declared a contributing factor in 
the deaths of two people, including a Port Hueneme man who died of heart 
failure while intoxicated with cocaine in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen people in Los Angeles County have died since 1983 after being shocked 
with Tasers, according to the coroner's office, including the two cases in 
which the weapons at least contributed to death. 
</P>
<P>
Cornelius Garland Smith, who was shot twice with Taser darts in 1985, is one of 
10 people who died in instances where Los Angeles Police Department officers 
used the weapon during the 1980s, according to Cmdr. William Booth. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 35, was shocked after officers found him writhing and screaming on the 
ground in South-Central Los Angeles. He died from a combination of the Taser, 
PCP and a congenital heart problem for which he was taking medicine, the 
coroner found. 
</P>
<P>
Tasers were the cause of the death of Anthony M. Williams III, a 35-year-old 
Upland man, who died after being subdued by Pomona police in May, 1986, the 
coroner reported. The cause of death was reported as heart failure "due to 
multiple Taser use." Williams was also under the influence of cocaine, the 
coroner reported. 
</P>
<P>
"Because the individual developed cardiac arrest immediately following shooting 
with the electrode rifle, and in the absence of other significant injuries . . 
. , it is assumed that death was caused" by the Taser, a deputy coroner found. 
At least one other Los Angeles County death has involved the Taser and a victim 
with a heart problem. The coroner ruled that Raul Guevara Jr., 30, of San 
Fernando died in January, 1984, of a heart problem aggravated by the effort 
Guevara exerted during a struggle with a jailer. 
</P>
<P>
In response, Taser and Nova spokesmen cite studies that they say show their 
weapons cannot cause a death. 
</P>
<P>
They cited the studies of Dr. Theodore Bernstein, whom the product safety 
commission selected to analyze the Taser in 1975. He found in a 1985 study that 
the heart rhythm of healthy volunteers who were shocked with the Nova stun gun 
did not change significantly. 
</P>
<P>
Also in 1985, Dr. Robert A. Stratbucker of the University of Nebraska Medical 
Center, Omaha, concluded that the Nova weapon, when used on animals, had no 
effect on heart rhythm or pumping and only a mild effect on blood pressure, 
even when it was applied directly to the heart. When Stratbucker simulated 
heart disease in animals, the shocks caused no irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
In the first large-scale medical review of the effects of the Taser on crime 
suspects, doctors at Martin Luther King Jr. Medical Center in Los Angeles found 
that during 1980-85, all but three of the 218 people treated there after Taser 
shocks survived. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors reported that those three had high drug or alcohol levels that alone 
could have caused their deaths. By comparison, 11 of 22 people shot by police 
over a two-year period died, the doctors noted. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Eric Koscove, an emergency physician at L.A. County-USC Medical Center, who 
has written extensively on the Taser, said that it may be impossible to say for 
sure that the weapon is safe for use on heart patients because tests on people 
with such problems probably never will be conducted. 
</P>
<P>
"I think generally speaking, the Taser is a relatively safe weapon for what 
it's supposed to do," Koscove said. "As a physician, I would prefer they use 
the Taser than just beat people down with the baton or choke them down. If my 
brother or sister were involved, I'd rather see them Tasered. We see a lot more 
deaths from chokeholds and batons than from the Taser." 
</P>
<P>
Even critics who cite cases where police officers have tortured crime suspects 
with stun guns -- including one settled for more than $300,000 by the city of 
Huntington Park in 1988 -- say the weapons should be used more frequently 
instead of lethal weapons such as firearms. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Coroner Lovell said he supports the cautious use of stun guns. 
The problem is not the weapon, he said. "The problem is that police really 
believe these things are completely safe."

SLAIN YOUTH'S FATHER FACES TRIAL IN THREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Newbury Park man has been ordered by a Municipal Court judge to stand trial 
for allegedly threatening to murder a Ventura County deputy district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Flores, 48, believed that Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Holmes botched 
cases against three men charged with beating to death his 19-year-old son at a 
party in January, 1989, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Ronald C. Janes, supervisor in charge of the major crimes 
and narcotics division, testified in a preliminary hearing last week that 
Flores' threats took place during two telephone calls on Feb. 6. 
</P>
<P>
During the first conversation, Janes testified, Flores said: "I'm at my wit's 
end. I've had enough of you people. I'm coming after you." 
</P>
<P>
Janes testified that Flores then told him that the evening before he had taken 
his gun to a parking lot and waited for Holmes to come out of a building. 
</P>
<P>
"He sounded dead serious," Janes said. "I was very concerned. I believed he 
might try to murder Mr. Holmes." 
</P>
<P>
During the preliminary hearing, a 15-minute tape-recording was played of the 
second telephone conversation, in which Flores said he intended to seek 
retribution against the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care how long it takes. I'm going to put you down," Flores told Janes, 
according to the tape. "If it's through politics, the media, I don't care if I 
have to hire someone to blow the building to Santa Barbara." 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge Thomas Hutchins ordered Flores to stand trial in two weeks on a 
felony count of threatening great bodily injury or death and a misdemeanor 
count of making a telephone call with the intent to annoy or threaten or 
inflict injury. 
</P>
<P>
The felony count is punishable by a year in jail or a state prison term of 16 
months to three years. The misdemeanor is punishable with a maximum of one year 
in jail. 
</P>
<P>
John Flores, 19, was killed on Jan. 20, 1989, after he arrived uninvited at a 
party in Newbury Park. He was asked to leave three times but refused, 
authorities said. A witness said another party-goer grabbed Flores by the hair 
and slammed his head against the pavement. Flores died that night as a result 
of brain injuries. 
</P>
<P>
It was determined that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute one man. A 
jury acquitted another man of manslaughter charges. And another man was 
convicted of aggravated assault, spent 90 days in the Ventura County Jail and 
received five years' probation.

WEEK IN REVIEW: SUPERVISORIAL CANDIDATE DENIES DEBTS; 
</P>
<P>
AUTHORITIES SAY VENTURA COLLEGE TRUSTEE OWES $40,000 TO SEVERAL NEVADA CASINOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County Community College District Trustee Tom Ely has incurred about 
$40,000 in gambling debts at more than half a dozen Nevada casinos, law 
enforcement sources told The Times last week. 
</P>
<P>
Ely, 54, who is running for the Ventura County Board of Supervisors, owes money 
to some of the best known casinos and hotels in Las Vegas, the law enforcement 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas Police Detective Ned Brodeur on Wednesday confirmed that there is 
such a list, of Ely's alleged gambling debts, but he declined to provide 
details. 
</P>
<P>
This disclosure of alleged gambling debts by Ely follows a report last week 
that he owed $3,000 to the Edgewater Hotel and Casino in Laughlin, Nev., and a 
subsequent revelation that he is being sued by the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas 
over $8,000 in alleged debts. 
</P>
<P>
Brodeur said Wednesday that only the Edgewater has filed a complaint with the 
police. He added that the complaint was dropped this week after the debt was 
settled. 
</P>
<P>
Most casinos allow indebted gamblers a grace period before seeking police 
intervention, Brodeur said, although the debts would be listed with the State 
Gaming Control Board of Nevada during periodic casino audits. 
</P>
<P>
Ely denied that he had incurred the gambling debts, and said his attorney has 
advised him not to comment because "there's all kinds of legal action coming." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the college board of trustees met over the weekend to discuss the 
situation and said they are looking into Ely's use of an office telephone to 
make calls to Nevada. They said the question of whether or not to censure Ely 
for his activities will be referred to attorneys for the county. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the trustees, Ely admitted that he had accrued some gambling 
debts in Las Vegas while under "heavy medication" last summer as the result of 
a traffic accident in January, but said his losses were not in the $40,000 
range. He said he is taking steps to pay off his gambling debts. 
</P>
<P>
Ely said he will remain in the supervisor's race to represent the 4th District, 
which includes Simi Valley, Moorpark, Somis and the Santa Rosa Valley. Ely has 
been an elected community college trustee -- a job that pays $400 a month -- 
since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The state Gaming Control Board of Nevada refused to comment on Ely's alleged 
indebtedness. None of the casinos would comment publicly either, citing 
policies guaranteeing confidentiality for clients.

LAW LIMITING WATER USE BRINGS DROUGHT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The effect of the statewide water shortage hit home last week. The Ventura City 
Council adopted an ordinance that limits residents' water use, and the county's 
eastern cities braced for possible cutbacks of state-supplied water. 
</P>
<P>
Cutbacks in the supply of state water to the major cities of eastern Ventura 
County -- including Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley -- may be considered as early 
as next month because of the drought, a regional water official said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Metropolitan Water District asked member 
agencies-including the county's eastern cities-to prepare ordinances that would 
require reductions in residential and commercial water use because of the 
worsening drought. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Simi Valley, Moorpark, Thousand Oaks, Camarillo and Oxnard said 
they will comply with the request. 
</P>
<P>
In the city of Ventura, which depends largely on local water sources such as 
Lake Casitas, the City Council adopted an ordinance Monday that limits water 
use by residents, cuts back non-residential users by 15% to 20% and creates a 
moratorium on hookups for new construction. 
</P>
<P>
The law, passed in the third year of a drought, is designed to reduce the 
city's water use by 30%. It will take effect April 13 -- 30 days after adoption 
-- but users will not be penalized for excess use until June. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning then, with the second billing period after the ordinance goes into 
effect, users may be penalized up to 10 times the normal rate for excess use. 
</P>
<P>
Single-family residences will be limited to 296 gallons a day. Apartments, 
condominiums, townhouses and mobile homes will be limited to 196 gallons. 
Houses get more because of lawn watering. 
</P>
<P>
Public Works Director Shelley Jones said about 45% of the city's residents 
already use less water than the new limits allow. 
</P>
<P>
A family may get permission to use more water if it can show it has exceeded 
the allocation for the past three years. Officials said that would typically be 
for a house with a big yard. Also, the amount will be increased by 49 gallons 
per day per person if more than three people live in a multifamily residence or 
more than four inhabit a single-family dwelling. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance provides for exceptions for medical needs, agriculture and 
businesses that prove that "all reasonable conservation measures are being 
used." 
</P>
<P>
The city will mail brochures explaining the ordinance and giving water-saving 
tips to Ventura's 22,400 customers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to rationing, the city is seeking additional supplies. 
</P>
<P>
In eastern Ventura County, cutbacks may be required if, as expected, the state 
Department of Water Resources, which operates the state water project, 
determines that not enough rain has fallen this year to meet the demands of its 
customers, said Jay Malinowski, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Water 
District. 
</P>
<P>
Malinowski said he could not estimate the amount of the cutback, saying only 
that he does not expect it to be as large as 20%.

CEREMONY MARKS A LONG-DELAYED RITE OF PASSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN O'SHAUGHNESSY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Molly Wasserman walked into Temple Ramat Zion in Northridge Saturday, her 
61-year wait was over. 
</P>
<P>
"I did a lot of crying," said the 74-year-old grandmother, dressed in some of 
her finest clothes for the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-nine other women joined Wasserman in shedding tears of joy. As 800 proud 
friends and family members watched, the women celebrated their bat mitzvahs, 
which usually mark a 13-year-old girl's passage into Jewish adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
For most of these women, the bat mitzvah did not exist when they were young 
because Jewish tradition called for only men to celebrate the rite of passage. 
Unlike their fathers, brothers and even sons who had observed their bar 
mitzvahs, the women never learned to read Hebrew or immerse themselves in a 
rigorous study of Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
It was only in the past 25 to 30 years that Jewish girls in Reform and 
Conservative synagogues routinely began having bat mitzvahs. 
</P>
<P>
Without the formal training, Wasserman said, "I sat through the services and 
looked like a dummy." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the women said they were motivated to attend classes by a need for a 
sense of belonging and a desire to reaffirm the importance of Judaism in their 
lives. As each took her turn to stand and talk to the congregation, many choked 
back tears and took a few moments to regain their voices. 
</P>
<P>
"It was something I always wanted to do," Julie Steinschriber, 39, said. "I 
always felt uncomfortable in the synagogue. By learning a little Hebrew and 
some prayers it made me feel like I belong. It gave me permission to belong." 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Solomon Rothstein congratulated the group, which included four men who 
had postponed their bar mitzvahs, for persevering and completing "unfinished 
business." 
</P>
<P>
"I know there is a lot in your hearts," he said. "Three words sum it up: pride, 
joy and excitement. That's what we all feel." 
</P>
<P>
The class met once a week for almost a year. The students learned Hebrew and 
became familiar with Jewish customs and holidays. During Saturday's service, 
one woman observed that while many 13-year-olds can absorb Hebrew like a 
sponge, for her the experience was more like trying to absorb it with a brick. 
</P>
<P>
Emma Cohen, the mother of four boys, said she studied every day and even took 
her homework along on her Thanksgiving vacation. After the service ended, she 
was still so excited that her hands were ice cold. 
</P>
<P>
"It really was an accomplishment," Cohen said. "I feel so close to God." 
</P>
<P>
Howard Langfus, the president of the congregation, said he knows of no other 
synagogue in Los Angeles that had so many people participating in its adult 
"b'nai mitzvah" class. 
</P>
<P>
What's happening at Ramat Zion is part of a growing trend, said Rabbi Paul 
Dubin, executive vice president of the Southern California Board of Rabbis. 
More women are taking advantage of opportunities they didn't have in the past, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rothstein predicted that the next class would be twice as big and jokingly 
remarked that the service would have to be held in the Dorothy Chandler 
Pavilion to accommodate the crowd of well-wishers. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Sabbath celebration fell on March 17, Rothstein said, "The 
world may have St. Patrick's Day, but we have the b'nai mitzvah class of 1990, 
and we don't need Schnapps to feel happy."

SOS NEEDS A 'YES' VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Costa Mesa City Council faces an important decision Tuesday: whether to 
grant a conditional use permit to the Share Our Selves charity to relocate in 
an industrial building in the southwest area of town. The Planning Commission 
has already approved the permit, but some local business owners and nearby 
residents objected, sending the final decision to the council. 
</P>
<P>
The council should grant the permit without further delay. 
</P>
<P>
SOS is being evicted by the council from its present location at Rea Community 
Center on Hamilton Street in response to concerns from neighbors, who 
complained about the thousands of homeless and poor who come to the center 
every month for financial assistance, clothing and food. 
</P>
<P>
The eviction had its silver lining, however. It generated $300,000 in 
contributions, enough to allow SOS to begin purchasing its own building. Now, 
SOS has been pledged another $200,000 in matching donations by two Orange 
County companies, Fieldstone Co. of Newport Beach and Fieldstead &amp; Co. of 
Irvine. That should help SOS come up with much of the $1.4 million needed to 
buy the Superior Avenue building, thus securing its future. 
</P>
<P>
As SOS executive director Jean Forbath has pointed out continually, there is 
almost nowhere the charity could relocate where there would be no opposition. 
That's true for the Superior Avenue location. But, all in all, the new building 
is appropriately situated in a mostly industrial area. In addition, SOS has 
promised to do more to make sure its clients conduct themselves in a manner 
fitting to the neighborhood. The City Council has said all along that it wants 
the charity to relocate in just such an area. It is time to back words with 
action. Give SOS the permits it needs to move to new quarters.

DID WOMEN REALLY WIN COURT RULING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You condemn Johnson Controls Inc. for allowing only non-sterile women to work 
in certain areas. You cry, "How dare they deny women high-paying jobs?" 
</P>
<P>
I am sure that their executives and lawyers are all smiling and patting 
themselves on the back for being so astute as to create a situation wherein 
they were taken to court and lost, but actually came out a winner. 
</P>
<P>
They won! They set a precedent! They can never be involved in a 
multimillion-dollar lawsuit by a woman who bears a child with problems. 
</P>
<P>
There are celebrations going on the boardrooms all across the country. How many 
other companies are now free from that type of worry? How many women will be 
victims of the take-the-job, take-your-chances court decision? 
</P>
<P>
We all know a good company lawyer can create a reasonable-doubt situation and 
get a favorable decision even where some abuse of the law is shown. 
</P>
<P>
Did Queen E. Foster really do women a favor? 
</P>
<P>
Think about it.

CITY MIGHT TONE DOWN COLOR CODE

<P>
I can't believe it (the two-toned Dana Point Inn)! I worked so hard for 
cityhood, and now I have somebody telling me what colors I have to like! 
</P>
<P>
Poor Dana Point Inn! When I first saw the new paint job, I thought, "Hooray! 
That dreadful drab, ugly grayish-blue is going to become an upbeat, soft, 
Mediterranean peach" . . . which reminds me of Capri and southern France. 
</P>
<P>
How nice!

But not so! Who are these people we hired who orchestrate every nuance of our 
lives? Hey guys . . . power going to your collective heads? Next thing they'll 
be painting the Ritz-Carlton grayish blue! 
</P>
<P>
Think a minute. . . . We are not a whale-killing, blubber-processing New 
England seacoast village. Like it or not -- and I like it -- our heritage is

makes sense ecologically.

JUDGES' HUMAN SIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re: Meet Your Judges Week. Your article "Judges Show Human Side to Public" 
(March 7), extolling Meet the Judges Week, also reported that only about 100 
people showed up to meet 17 judges. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently the low turnout was disappointing. What did they expect when the 
judges' association did such a poor job publicizing the meeting? 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the better way for judges to show their "human side" to the public 
is to be fair from the bench and to crack down hard on any one of their number 
who fails in his duty to rule fairly, and violates or denies a citizen's lawful 
rights. All it takes is for one member to show arrogance, and it can tarnish 
the image as a whole for hard-working and sincere judges. 
</P>
<P>
The Times is also to blame for its poor coverage of legal matters concerning 
the public. If The Times would devote a fraction of its pulp to civil rights, 
as it does to the slam-dunk details of a high school basketball game, it would 
be serving the public better.

UCI HOUSING FOR MARRIED STUDENTS FILLS KEY NEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re UCI Protesters (March 8): I have a question: Do students nowadays believe 
that their primary function in school is to learn or is it to protest something 
they don't like? 
</P>
<P>
More and more it seems to be the latter, especially at our tax-supported 
colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
I am beginning to resent it mightily. 
</P>
<P>
The current flap over UCI not permitting homosexual couples to live in campus 
family housing facilities is an example. The law says that persons of the same 
sex cannot marry. The University of California Board of Regents says that only 
married couples are allowed to live in the family housing complex. Period. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't seem difficult to understand. So why do the "protesters" expect 
the chancellor to break the law and to violate university policy because they 
don't agree with the law or the policy? 
</P>
<P>
Like spoiled children, these so-called students block building entrances, build 
shantytowns on public property and waste valuable police resources in order to 
get lots of press coverage. 
</P>
<P>
What they should be doing, if they truly believe in their cause, is to invest 
their time and talents in getting the laws and the policies changed. This would 
allow the serious students (who, thankfully, are in the vast majority) to 
pursue the education for which they (and their parents) are paying a lot of 
money.

Rather than uselessly attempting to force Chancellor Jack Peltason to break 
away from the UC system's policy of allowing only married students to reside in 
the family housing complex, why don't they address the basis of the problem and 
lobby the state Legislature to legalize the marriage of gays and lesbians?

INVOCATIONS AT MEETINGS REFLECT NATION'S TOLERANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to Walter Adams (March 11) of Orange who suggested that all who 
love the Constitution should offer full support to Mayor Richard B. Edgar of 
Tustin in his effort to "keep religion out of city government": If you really 
love the Constitution, then sacrifice a little of your time to learn of its 
background and why the Supreme Court has consistently upheld the practice of 
legislative bodies opening their sessions with prayer. 
</P>
<P>
You will be surprised to find that this practice has continued (without 
interruption) for almost 200 years since Madison, Franklin and other men 
drafted the Bill of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
The Constitution makes room for a variety of beliefs/non-beliefs and sponsors 
an attitude that shows no partiality to any one group but lets each flourish 
according to the spiritual needs its members deem necessary. So don't try to 
impose your personal unbeliefs on others by hiding behind your agnosticism. 
Take the mayor's advice when he says it is prudent to be informed about the 
law. If the members of the Tustin City Council feel the need for invocations, 
they have that right.

UCI HOUSING FOR MARRIED STUDENTS FILLS KEY NEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UC Irvine protesters who insist on placing gays in married student housing may 
jeopardize their credibility and lose sympathy with their cause. The insistence 
on placing gays in housing designed for married people because they are 
declared lovers seems self-serving. 
</P>
<P>
Should heterosexuals who wish to date or "go steady" also have this right? 
</P>
<P>
The social construct of marriage exists primarily to provide for shared and 
defined responsibility in raising children. That the construct provides for 
social approval of cohabitation is a secondary result. 
</P>
<P>
Married student housing at universities has evolved to meet the special needs 
of those who have made a legal commitment to live together and raise children. 
Provisions are made for children, including playgrounds, schooling and 
segregation away from single students who might object to their noise level. By 
providing for married student housing, universities acknowledge the coexistence 
of study with societal commitment to raise families. 
</P>
<P>
Single parents with children are usually placed in married student housing. 
Where they choose to date or have live-ins, it has often been tacitly allowed 
by universities. Those gays who are rearing children and are legally 
responsible for their upbringing presumably should be granted the same rights. 
</P>
<P>
Focus on the actual needs and desires of gay students in housing would seem 
more appropriate than civil disobedience. 
</P>
<P>
Do some gays wish to be segregated from heterosexuals? Do they find it 
frustrating or an affront to be assigned to live with a member of the same sex 
who is not a lover? 
</P>
<P>
Administrators need to be sensitive to the needs of gays, and the assignment of 
an ombudsman is the first step in this direction. Since the door is open to 
meeting actual needs at UC Irvine, one would hope that gays and their advocates 
would not block the door for others to pass through.

SPRAYING SHOULDN'T BE DONE WITHOUT ADVANCE WARNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to the only notice we have received from the state Department of 
Agriculture, our neighborhood was to be sprayed with malathion on Monday, Jan. 
22. 
</P>
<P>
We heard on the radio and television that our area would be sprayed every three 
weeks on a Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Our area was not sprayed due to high winds. Then, without any warning, we were 
hit -- no time to find the cat, cover the car or bring in the patio furniture. 
</P>
<P>
It is bad enough to be sprayed against our will with a toxic chemical whose 
impact on human health is hotly disputed and whose effectiveness in actually 
eradicating the Medfly is still unknown. 
</P>
<P>
However, it is far worse to be sprayed in the dead of night (12:15 a.m.) with 
no advance notice whatsoever. Such utter lack of responsibility on the part of 
our government is appalling.

RETIREE'S MYSTERY JAUNT; 
</P>
<P>
VANISHED: A RETIRED ACCOUNTANT WHOSE DREAM WAS TO TRAVEL DISAPPEARS IN OREGON. 
A COUPLE IS CHARGED WITH USING HIS BANK ACCOUNT AND VEHICLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gordy Johnson had looked forward for years to his retirement. Every detail was 
carefully planned, meticulously researched. 
</P>
<P>
A bachelor, the former Glendale banking accountant would sell his home of 27 
years and the old, beat-up green Volkswagen that he had driven to work, day in 
and day out. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from his life's labor would be invested in a $219,000 luxury motor 
home with a new four-wheel-drive Suzuki towed behind. After a career marked by 
punctuality, Johnson looked forward to a nomadic life without a timetable. 
</P>
<P>
When he retired last April, just after his 62nd birthday, his co-workers at a 
Glendale Federal Bank subsidiary presented him with a mixed black and brown 
Labrador-shepherd puppy to keep him company in his travels. He named the pup 
Rocky. 
</P>
<P>
After making several short treks in his new rig, Johnson telephoned relatives 
on Oct. 14 from Bend, Ore., saying that he was headed south to visit a friend 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the last anyone ever saw of him or heard from him again," said Sgt. 
Robert Cosner of the Deschutes County Sheriff's Department in Oregon. "He has 
disappeared from the face of the Earth." 
</P>
<P>
A month after relatives notified authorities, Gordon Theodore Johnson -- born 
April 15, 1927; 5-foot-9; 170 pounds; fair complexion; balding black hair; blue 
eyes -- officially became a missing person. 
</P>
<P>
He is among 21,996 missing adults on the computerized nationwide list 
maintained by the National Crime Information Center of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation in Washington. Since the list was established in 1975, 9,244 
adults -- less than 30% -- have been found, dead or alive. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson's is not a typical missing-person case. A couple has been arrested 
in Las Vegas in the possession of Johnson's vehicles and most of the missing 
man's savings account -- partly spent on a trip to Tahiti, lavish clothes and 
gambling in Las Vegas, according to court papers filed by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
Because no body has been found, authorities are not openly calling the Johnson 
case a slaying. But they also do not speak optimistically of locating Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"I have grave concerns about whether we will ever find Mr. Johnson," said Dick 
Whitaker, supervising special FBI agent in Las Vegas, where the couple was 
arrested March 1. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-foot-long motor home was found Jan. 29 parked in a trailer vacation 
resort in Surprise, Ariz., just five miles outside Phoenix. Investigators said 
Johnson's bank account is virtually depleted. The Suzuki was recovered when FBI 
agents arrested the couple. Authorities have no clue to the whereabouts of 
Johnson and Rocky. 
</P>
<P>
The couple being held without bail in a Clark County, Nev., jail, are Stanley 
Alan Hershey, 46, and his companion, Jan Vicki Fine, 37, who had used a Santa 
Monica address, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Hershey and Fine reportedly have denied knowing Johnson and have refused to 
talk to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
They have been charged in U.S. District Court in Nevada with relatively minor 
crimes -- illegal use of a banking card and transportation of a stolen vehicle 
across state lines. 
</P>
<P>
However, Assistant U.S. Atty. Gregory Damm charged that the suspects 
"definitely had something to do with the disappearance of the victim." A 
federal magistrate ordered them held without bail after Damm argued that the 
pair pose a danger because of the potential seriousness of the crime and may 
flee prosecution if released. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Those familiar with the case admit privately that they suspect Johnson was 
killed. But they have no clues as to when or where Johnson may have met foul 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Cosner, the Oregon sheriff who took the missing-person report, is still 
pursuing the case. He said he has drawn his own conclusions. "A man doesn't 
save all his money to retire, then just give away a $220,000 coach, his motor 
vehicle and his bank account. Everybody who has ever looked at this case knows 
what we're talking about." 
</P>
<P>
However, because there is no body, Cosner says, his department must treat the 
case as a missing-persons investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's relatives -- including his sister, brother and sister-in-law in 
Minneapolis and a close-knit family of nieces, nephews and their children -- 
are trying to remain optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't help but be apprehensive, but we have to keep our hopes up," said Del 
Johnson, 51, Johnson's brother. "Until we learn differently, we believe he is 
somewhere and not able to contact us. We just keep praying." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, investigations into Johnson's disappearance are complicated by 
jurisdictional problems. Federal and local authorities in a half-dozen states 
-- where checks were issued on Johnson's bank funds or cash withdrawn from his 
account on automated-teller machines -- are involved in the Johnson case. 
Officials are tight-lipped about details because investigations are continuing. 
</P>
<P>
Whitaker, of the FBI in Las Vegas, said: "We are not conducting a murder 
investigation. One of the main problems is, who would have jurisdiction? Bend, 
Ore., is still conducting a missing-persons investigation." 
</P>
<P>
But Cosner said his Oregon-based investigation is limited by a tight county 
budget in the economically depressed region. "We can't just fly here and there 
to chase a case," he said. "We have to rely on help from other agencies. It 
takes time to put it all together." 
</P>
<P>
He credited the Las Vegas FBI office as being "very helpful and cooperative. 
Somebody had to take the ball and run with it. Not all agencies are willing to 
do that." 
</P>
<P>
Murder is not a federal offense unless kidnaping is involved. Because no body 
has been found in the Johnson case and there is no evidence of a kidnaping, 
such an investigation is outside the official jurisdiction of the FBI, Whitaker 
said. However, he said, agents are retracing the trails of suspects in the 
hopes of finding Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's relatives said they were concerned but not alarmed when the retired 
accountant failed to call them from Los Angeles. They still set aside their 
concerns when they didn't hear from Johnson at Thanksgiving, when the nomadic 
bachelor had considered visiting friends in South Carolina. "He just wanted go 
hither, there and yon," Del Johnson said. "That was his thing. Gordy said he 
wanted to be 'just like a turtle, with my home on my back.' " 
</P>
<P>
By early December, Johnson's relatives said, they could no longer suppress 
their anxieties. They opened Johnson's November banking statement that had been 
sent to his sister and discovered, among other things, a canceled check for 
$6,100 to a Louisiana travel agency, dated Oct. 15, one day after Johnson's 
disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
They found that the check had been issued to pay for tickets to Tahiti for a 
man identified as Hershey. Relatives contacted sheriff's deputies in Bend, 
where Johnson was last seen, and an investigation began. 
</P>
<P>
Cosner said he learned that the tickets, sent to an address in Surprise were 
used by Hershey and Fine. Further investigation indicated that other checks had 
been issued to pay bills not owed by Johnson and that cash was being withdrawn 
from Johnson's bank account from automated-teller machines, Cosner said. 
</P>
<P>
In all, up to $160,000 -- Johnson's entire cash nest egg -- is believed to have 
been embezzled from his account, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
According to family and friends, Johnson is a kind and considerate man who kept 
in touch with his Midwestern family and went out of his way to brighten the 
office for co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a very careful and meticulous worker," said Rochelle Gnatz, Johnson's 
last supervisor at Glenfed Development in Encino, where he worked as an 
accounts payable assistant. His career had involved accounting jobs at various 
Los Angeles firms, including Glenfed during the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson frequently marked holidays by bestowing gifts on co-workers. One Easter 
he gave giant stuffed lions taller than a desk to each of the women in his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
He distributed Christmas towels and potholders and remembered birthdays. "He 
was the only one who did it," said Mary Anne Paul, a former Glenfed employee 
who was Johnson's supervisor. "He was just a saint, a very warm and loving and 
friendly and outgoing and generous man." 
</P>
<P>
He was generous at home, too. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson had allowed an acquaintance, a Vietnam veteran, to stay at his home, 
even though the man was prone to nightmares that prompted him to punch holes in 
most of the interior doors of the house, friends and neighbors said. He also 
had provided shelter recently for a woman who he said had fallen on hard times, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors described Johnson as a loner who never caused complaints or hosted 
loud parties. 
</P>
<P>
He had done little to maintain his house since he purchased it new in 1962. The 
elaborate fireplace was never used, the drab brown paint had faded and the 
wooden shingles were deteriorated when Gay Faylor purchased the property last 
August at a "fixer-upper" price of $385,000. The white carpeting was clean but 
badly worn, Faylor said. 
</P>
<P>
Friends and co-workers said Johnson was an avid backgammon player and often 
traveled to Las Vegas, Reno and Lake Tahoe to participate in tournaments, 
frequently winning large sums of money. 
</P>
<P>
He also occasionally worked as a dealer for gaming night parties, said Al Bond, 
owner of Big Al's Game Rental in South Pasadena, who described Johnson as "a 
very quiet individual who didn't drink or smoke." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson kept all of his personal and financial papers neatly packed in one 
place -- in a camera-bag-like satchel that he always carried with him, friends 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a sweet, kind, loving guy," one business associate said. "He trusted 
people."

POSTAL SERVICE APARTMENT PLAN IS GREED, PICUS SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joy Picus accused the U.S. Postal Service of 
"unabashed greed" for a sketchy proposal to build an apartment complex on land 
it owns in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
Picus, echoing the concerns of Encino residents, said on Thursday that the 
proposed 112-unit complex is incompatible with the single-family homes and 
small businesses that surround the site next to the Encino post office branch 
on White Oak Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"All they want is money, money, money," said Picus, who described the Postal 
Service as an "uncaring, faceless bureaucracy" for its plan to lease the land 
to a developer despite objections from neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
She has introduced a motion that would prevent the complex from being built. 
</P>
<P>
The Postal Service announced last year that it was looking for developers 
interested in building on the property. It entered exclusive negotiations with 
Tutor-Saliba in January. 
</P>
<P>
The project is still in its infancy, according to Bob Vincent, director of 
marketing and development for Tutor-Saliba Properties, the San Fernando Valley 
development company that has been working with the Postal Service on the 
project. No project plans have been developed, and Tutor-Saliba and the Postal 
Service have yet to begin serious discussions on the proposal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't really have anything in the works as yet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent said his firm's initial proposal for the project was a 112-unit complex 
on 54,000 square feet of land, where the vacant Encino Municipal Court building 
now sits. He said if Tutor-Saliba were able to acquire additional land now used 
for parking by Postal Service employees, the project could grow to as many as 
160 units. 
</P>
<P>
Picus and residents said a complex of that size would destroy the "stable 
neighborhood" of 1950s tract homes and small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"The massive apartment complex proposed for this site threatens to shatter the 
neighborhood's peace and privacy," Picus said in a prepared statement. "It is 
totally out of scale both in size and density. The building would tower . . . 
over modest homes and would house a population a dozen times more dense than 
the neighborhood around it." 
</P>
<P>
Rob Glushon, president of the Encino Property Owners Assn., said the proposed 
project was "ill-conceived and makes no sense, except to those who would profit 
from this stupid idea." 
</P>
<P>
Picus introduced a motion last week that would prohibit the construction of 
apartments and condominiums on the property by changing the zoning. Her motion, 
submitted to the Planning and Land-Use Management Committee, would also require 
the approval of Picus and the property owners association on any development on 
the property.

Baseball's labor impasse appeared to have reached a critical juncture Saturday, 
as former Major League Players Association director Marvin Miller took part in 
a lengthy meeting of players and union officials. 
</P>
<P>
But like so many other times during the negotiations, hope was false, meetings 
ending without an agreement and the two sides still divided over the issue of 
salary arbitration for two-year players. 
</P>
<P>
Another session is scheduled for 10:30 EST today. 
</P>
<P>
The National and American leagues seemed close to announcing that opening day 
games would be canceled or postponed but still were withholding comment. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he was invited by union director Donald Fehr to provide "historical 
perspective," but it seemed apparent Miller had been brought in to remind the 
union's older members of their previous labor struggles and promote unity at a 
time when the players appear to be choosing sides over the issue of 
salary-arbitration eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not here to give a pep talk," Miller said. "I'm here to give perspective 
and answer questions." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it probably is no coincidence that he has arrived just as some of the 
union's old guard seem willing to accept ownership's most recent proposal, 
which still includes a three-year service requirement for salary arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
One veteran player, who asked not to be identified, said Saturday that the 
union's executive board had agreed before the negotiations began that the 
majority of the players would be happy with the three-years service-time 
arrangement if all the other issues were addressed satisfactorily. Somewhere 
along the line, he said, emotion had gotten in the way of a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the consensus is that if all the other issues are taken care of, 
then the arbitration will not be a major factor," he said. "I think what it 
comes down to is seeing how all the players react -- not just the executive 
board -- to the latest proposal and take a vote on that." 
</P>
<P>
According to the same source, a player referendum was begun earlier this week 
by Kansas City Royals catcher Bob Boone and California Angels pitcher Bert 
Blyleven. Boone, who was a union hard-liner during the 50-day strike of 1981, 
appears to be leading a faction that would be willing to accept a continuance 
of the three-year service requirement. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Miller, who held the union together through the grueling 1981 strike. He 
insisted he didn't come to give a pep talk, but his presence didn't seem to be 
an accident. 
</P>
<P>
Miller emerged from the meeting nearly three hours later, saying that he sensed 
no cracks in the union's resolve. 
</P>
<P>
"They are totaling up the impact of how long a stoppage the owners are going to 
impose on them," he said. "They are figuring out the dollars. There's no panic 
there at all." 
</P>
<P>
Miller said there were "no cracks" in the union solidarity but admitted 
"apparently there are some players raising questions out in the hinterlands." 
</P>
<P>
Ownership also has shown signs of disunity during the 31-day lockout, but chief 
negotiator Chuck O'Connor said early Saturday morning that management was not 
likely to go much further than the proposal he sent to the union Friday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't call it a take-it-or-leave-it offer," he said. "That's a pejorative 
term. What (Milwaukee Brewers owner and Player Relations Committee member) Bud 
Selig did tell the union is that in a labor negotiation, you stretch as far as 
you can. As far as the economic package, we've stretched it as far as we can." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal Friday called for a minimum major-league salary of $100,000 and a 
minimum minor-league salary of $25,000, and the annual benefits contribution 
was pumped up to $55 million. But it removed the $4 million bonus pool for 
two-year players, which made the overall value of the deal virtually the same 
as management's previous proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press reported that the players proposed binding arbitration on 
the key issue of arbitration eligibility, and while owners did not immediately 
reject it, their chief negotiator, Chuck O'Connor, said it would be a "tough 
sell."

OWNERS HINT OF NEW IDEA;

<P>
BASEBALL: O'CONNOR TALKS OF DIFFERENT MATH IN FIGURING ARBITRATION ELIGIBILITY. 
MILLER ADDRESSES UNION. 
</P>

<P>
Baseball's Major League Players Assn., publicly displaying solidarity amid 
rumored divisiveness, voted support of its leadership Saturday and rejected the 
owners' "deal making" proposal because it fails to address the issue of 
arbitration eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
An appearance by former executive director Marvin Miller might have helped Don 
Fehr, the union's current executive director, hold his constituency together 
during a four-hour review of the proposal by more than 50 players, including 
representatives of all 26 clubs, at the union's New York offices Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
According to a source, some of those present felt a settlement should be made 
on a proposal that basically leaves only the arbitration issue unresolved. 
However, they were shouted down by the majority. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he was asked by Fehr to provide historical perspective regarding 
the owners' previous attempts to divide the union. 
</P>
<P>
"Arbitration has been an issue in every negotiation for the last 17 years, and 
solidarity has been the key to all of our progress," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently some players out in the hinterlands have been raising questions. I 
reminded them that they have to stay together on this. The mood is good. I 
don't see any cracks." 
</P>
<P>
On Day 31 of the owners' lockout, despite one player's contention that union 
leadership was allowing the emotion of arbitration to cloud common sense in 
regard to the current proposal, Fehr said there was a unanimous vote of 
confidence in the union's negotiating committee. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting followed a morning negotiating session during which the owners' 
Player Relations Committee rejected Fehr's call for binding arbitration on the 
eligibility question, and the two sides failed again to resolve the issue. 
</P>
<P>
However, Charles O'Connor, the PRC's general counsel, said later Saturday that 
he and Fehr "may have identified a narrow piece of turf" on which a bridge over 
the arbitration gap might be built. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor said they will pursue that in another negotiating session today in New 
York. He acknowledged a "certain urgency" in negotiations after investment of 
this much time and energy, not to mention the scheduled April 2 start of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Fay Vincent told CBS Saturday that starting the season on time has 
become "a pipe dream." 
</P>
<P>
He is expected to announce details of the cancellation and/or postponement 
today, having delayed it in hope a weekend settlement would allow the schedule 
to remain intact, with clubs carrying 30 players for the first month as 
compensation for a two-week training camp. 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear now how much training the clubs will receive, but it is generally 
agreed that the entire April and May schedule could be jeopardized if an 
agreement is not reached soon. 
</P>
<P>
While some players said Saturday that several issues remain to be resolved, 
O'Connor said the "working assessment" is that it comes down to arbitration 
eligibility. The owners want to keep it at three years. The players want it 
rolled back to two. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor would not be specific about the new turf that has been identified, but 
he suggested that it has to do with redefinition of service time and the claims 
of the union that some young players have been manipulated by clubs, their 
roster time "arbitrarily held down" so that they require longer to become 
eligible for arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
If that could be resolved, O'Connor said, the owners would be making more 
players eligible under the three-year standard but wouldn't be changing the 
economic system. 
</P>
<P>
Said O'Connor: "I don't want to get anyone's expectations up or think the 
clubs' position has changed, because it hasn't, but the manipulation issue is 
one the clubs certainly can't ignore. And the union has a legitimate reason for 
bringing it up -- and we're going to try and deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Fehr, on this new attempt to resolve the problem: "I don't suggest that I 
see an end to these discussions, but at least they're still taking place." 
</P>
<P>
Some players seem to feel they shouldn't be, that the owners have fulfilled 
enough of the union's demands, and that arbitration isn't worth a continued 
struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Reportedly among those players are Bob Boone, Kansas City Royal catcher, and 
Bert Blyleven, Angel pitcher, who apparently attempted this week to organize 
players in support of the proposal as it now is. Neither Boone nor Blyleven 
could be reached Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Publicly, however, the picture was one of solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
Said Paul Molitor of the Milwaukee Brewers: 
</P>
<P>
"I don't look down on the fact that the owners have made significant offers in 
other areas, but with no change on 'two-three' this (rejection) was not a 
difficult decision. We're solidly behind our negotiating committee." 
</P>
<P>
Said the Dodgers' Orel Hershiser: "I was one of the players who benefited from 
two-year salary arbitration in 1985. I went from a salary of $200,000 up to a 
million, so how can I stare those players in the face who might go through that 
same window and say, 'I had that, but you can't?' 
</P>
<P>
"If people spoke out today it might have been the result of the frustration of 
being locked out." 
</P>
<P>
Added Fehr of the often fractious meeting that led to the show of solidarity: 
"We never tell anyone to shut up. Everybody says whatever they want. It makes 
for a less efficient meeting, but I think it has redeeming virtues."

MORNING BRIEFING: A CASE OF CABIN FERVOR HELPED TO PRODUCE THESE NFL COACHES

<P>
Jerry Glanville, new coach of the Atlanta Falcons, and Joe Bugel, new coach of 
the Phoenix Cardinals, were roommates while working as assistant coaches at 
Western Kentucky. They shared a log cabin that had only one bed and no heating. 
</P>
<P>
"We flipped a coin to see who got the bed, and he won," Glanville told the 
Pittsburgh Press. "I had to sleep on the floor on newspapers. He could roll me 
over on Sundays and read the funnies off my back." 
</P>
<P>
Said Bugel: "The only things we ever ate were pizza and doughnuts. And after 
dinner we'd sit and talk and draw up plays on those pizza boxes. Jerry doesn't 
know it, but I kept some of those pizza boxes. We play him this year, and I 
know what blitzes he is going to use." 
</P>
<P>
Add roommates: Said Glanville: "Joe was my hero because he had a car. He had a 
big, old Ford Thunderbird and I had to walk to work. And he was more handsome 
than me. He got all the girls." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Illinois State basketball Coach Bob Bender is the answer to what 
trivia question? 
</P>
<P>
Low profile: On the course, you would call him gregarious, but Lee Trevino told 
the Orlando Sentinel: "I'm really kind of a loner, not a partier anymore at 
all. Room service, putting on the carpet of my hotel room, a little TV, then 
bed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't socialize with other golfers. Orville Moody's maybe my best friend out 
here, but I've never had dinner with him. Tom Watson, a couple of times. 
</P>
<P>
"But I wake up happy every morning when I know I'm going to play golf. That's 
all I know; that's all I want to do." 
</P>
<P>
For what it's worth: For 14 years, Tom Harmon held the Ram record for longest 
punt return in a game. In 1947, he set a mark of 88 yards. In 1961, Dick Bass 
broke it with a 90-yard return, a record that still stands. 
</P>
<P>
Whew!: Said Oklahoma Coach Billy Tubbs after the Sooners escaped with a 77-68 
victory over Towson State in the first round of the NCAA playoffs: "Late in the 
game, I was confused as to who was No. 1 and who was No. 64." 
</P>
<P>
Timber!: Former Philadelphia 76er trainer Al Domenico, still marveling at the 
all-around prowess of Wilt Chamberlain, told the Philadelphia Daily News: "I 
remember one time he bet a guy he could bowl an entire game without using the 
finger holes. He palmed the bowling ball and still bowled over 100." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: He is the only man to play in NCAA championship games for two 
different schools. He played for Indiana in its 86-68 victory over Michigan in 
1975-76, and for Duke in its 94-88 loss to Kentucky in 1977-78. 
</P>

Quotebook San Francisco Chronicle columnist C.W. Nevius, saying reaction to his 
suggestion that the Giants trade Kevin Mitchell was split 50-50: "Half of them 
thought it was a terrible idea. The other half thought I had lost my mind."

LAKERS FIND SOMETHING TO SHOUT ABOUT; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: THEY HOLD OFF TIMBERWOLVES, 101-99, BEFORE 43,606 IN METRODOME 
AND END TWO-GAME LOSING STREAK.

<P>
You would not expect the Lakers to react gleefully after a 101-99 victory over 
an expansion team, even a competitive one such as the Minnesota Timberwolves. 
But these are stressful times for the Lakers, chasing the Detroit Pistons for 
the NBA's best record and being chased by three Western Conference rivals. 
</P>
<P>
A few of the problems that developed during the Lakers' two-game losing streak 
surfaced again Saturday. They had defensive lapses, at times lacked offensive 
movement and lost several leads. 
</P>
<P>
But thanks to defensive plays by Magic Johnson and Byron Scott in the final 37 
seconds, the Lakers improved to 48-16. They remain one game behind the Pistons 
for the league's best record. 
</P>
<P>
"We got out by the skin of our teeth," said Laker Coach Pat Riley, who benched 
guard Larry Drew and went with an eight-man rotation for the first time this 
season. "But we ended up getting the win, and that's all that matters. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to keep it in proper perspective. We won three of five road games, 
and our two losses were to teams (the Philadelphia 76ers and Cleveland 
Cavaliers) that were desperate for wins. We didn't lose those games as much as 
got beat." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers almost lost -- or got beat -- again Saturday. They have not lost 
three in a row this season, and it took strong defensive measures at the end to 
salvage it. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota (17-46) has victories this season over the New York Knicks, Boston 
Celtics and Philadelphia in their first season, and the Timberwolves were not 
about to acquiesce at the first flex of Laker strength. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers had a nine-point second-quarter lead, then nearly lost it by 
halftime. They led by eight with 6:50 left in the fourth quarter, then lost it. 
They rebuilt it to five, then saw it whittled to one. 
</P>
<P>
But when seriously challenged, the Lakers responded with big plays. 
</P>
<P>
The first came with 37 seconds left and the Lakers leading, 98-97. Tyrone 
Corbin turned for a 12-foot jump shot in the lane, but Scott left Tony Campbell 
and blocked the shot. Johnson rebounded the ball, was fouled and made both free 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
The second play came on the Timberwolves' last chance to tie the score. Johnson 
had made one free throw with eight seconds left, giving the Lakers a 101-99 
lead. The Timberwolves, coached by assistant Bob Zuffelato after Bill Musselman 
was ejected late in the second quarter, called a timeout to set up the play. 
</P>
<P>
When Pooh Richardson tried to pass to Tod Murphy cutting to the basket with 
three seconds left, there were several Lakers in the area. Johnson stepped in 
and batted the ball away as the buzzer sounded. 
</P>
<P>
Game over, the Lakers were especially animated leaving the court, exchanging 
high-fives and waving at the Metrodome crowd of 43,606 -- largest in the NBA 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
They were a relieved and happy group, even Drew. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good win, especially here," said Johnson, who had 37 points and 13 
assists. "We played hard, and that's the important thing. We finished this road 
trip with a win, and we're going to have a good week. We're home and got some 
time for a couple of practices. We're going to get back to what we had been 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
James Worthy, who had 24 points, took a different approach and credited the 
Timberwolves, who were led by 24 points each by Campbell, a former Laker, and 
Murphy, a former UC Irvine standout. 
</P>
<P>
"People who understand basketball pretty much understand what a two-point 
victory over this team is," Worthy said. "They play harder than anyone in this 
league. I don't know of any team that has blown them out." 
</P>
<P>
Scott was the only Laker to express concern that the Lakers were not their 
robust selves, even in victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've still got a long way to go," Scott said. "We still got things to 
work on. This was just about trying to head back in the right direction. We've 
got to work on defense, individually and as a team. The communication gap still 
has to be worked on. We don't talk to one another enough on defense. We had 
them by nine, and lost our defensive intensity and let them back in. If we can 
keep our defensive intensity, we'd be scary." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Laker Coach Pat Riley said he did not plan to bench backup point guard Larry 
Drew before Saturday's game. But Drew did not play for the first time this 
season, Riley choosing instead to play Magic Johnson 45 minutes and Byron Scott 
40. "I'm not saying this is going to be continuous," Riley said. "It wasn't 
planned. I just decided to stay with Magic and give Byron some more time. 
Sometimes, when Byron sits too long, he gets (out of sync)." Said Drew: "It was 
just the flow of this game. Plus, we lost two in a row. The most important 
thing is we won the game.". . . . The Lakers were out-rebounded, 46-33. They 
gave up 21 offensive rebounds. Eight of Tod Murphy's nine rebounds were on the 
offensive end.

EAST GERMAN ATHLETES LOOK FOR MOTIVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
East German athletes are sharing their long-guarded secrets with the West. They 
also are searching for fresh motivation, now that the perks of sports stardom 
are gone in their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the clearest examples of the impact on sports of the political 
changes sweeping Eastern Europe, two sprinters from East Germany have just 
completed a 12-day training course in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
While Western athletes regularly train overseas, the visit of Frank Emmelmann 
and Steffan Gormer marks the first time runners from East Germany have been 
allowed to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a very valuable experience studying training methods of another 
country," said Juergen Ludewig, coach of the two sprinters. "Back home, we do 
much more weight training, here they do more jumping. At home, we train longer 
hours, but here everything is so much more intensive." 
</P>
<P>
The most important difference, he said, was the motivation factor. 
</P>
<P>
"I've found it amazing that people here do a hard day's work and then go to the 
track in the evening," Ludewig said. "There seems to be more commitment." 
</P>
<P>
With attitudes changing and authorities in Eastern Europe no longer treating 
successful athletes as special cases, Ludewig said the will to win was being 
eroded. 
</P>
<P>
At the European Indoor Track and Field Championships this month, not a single 
East German made the men's 200-meter final, a statistic experts said was 
unprecedented in the event. 
</P>
<P>
"Motivation is going to be very difficult," Ludewig said. "Before, there was 
the possibility of social status and of traveling to compete abroad. Now, 
everyone can travel. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have to emphasize the ideals of the sport much more and also teach 
them about professionalism, the ability to make money from track and field." 
</P>
<P>
Competition from new sports also has created a problem, Ludewig said. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, only certain sports, like track and field, were paid for by the 
state. Water polo, for instance, used to be supressed for the sake of 
swimming," he said. "But now, sportsmen can go into a whole range of other 
leisure pursuits that will find sponsorship. The talent will be spread around 
much more." 
</P>
<P>
Emmelmann, 1982 European 100-meter champion and three-time European Cup gold 
medalist, said he was coming to terms with popular resentment in East Germany 
toward privileged athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"Until the revolution, I was one of the blue-eyed boys, a great sporting hero," 
he said through an interpreter at a news conference last week. "Now suddenly, 
there is antagonism and I find that depressing." 
</P>
<P>
Ludewig said public feelings toward sports would "settle down" once the 
country's future was mapped out. But, he said, much of the aggression was 
unjustified. 
</P>
<P>
"What people don't realize is that the athletes worked extremely hard for what 
they achieved, probably harder than in any other country," the coach said. 
"They weren't just sponsored by the state regardless." 
</P>
<P>
During their stay in London, Emmelmann and Gormer worked with British sprinters 
Marcus Adam and John Regis, and their coach, John Isaacs. 
</P>
<P>
A recipricol arrangement will take place next month when British runners Diane 
Edwards and Ann Williams, Commonwealth Games 800-meter gold and silver 
medalists, travel with their coach to Neubrandenburg, East Germany. They will 
train with Olympic and world 800 champion Sigrun Wodars and Christine Wachtel, 
runner-up to Wodars in both events. 
</P>
<P>
For Frank Dick, the British national track coach who conceived the British-East 
German exchange, the visit of Emmelmann and Gormer marks the realization of a 
decade-long ambition. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a dream that has taken rather a long time to come true," Dick said. "When 
I took over director of British coaching in 1979, I said I wanted to create a 
situation where experts could work together at international training camps. 
But only now have we managed to get the right climate to do the swaps." 
</P>
<P>
Dick said he hoped similar exchanges could be made in the future with the 
Soviet Union, and other Eastern European nations, to the benefit of all 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"All coaches use different methods," Dick said. "People use the same principles 
in their own way to meet the needs of specific athletes. In the end, the 
results are not too dissimilar. What is important is that we see more varieties 
of interpretation." 
</P>
<P>
The East Germans were due back in their country Friday. Ludewig said a longer 
stay than 12 days would have been more constructive. 
</P>
<P>
"But we have to get home," he said. "There's a rather important day in our 
history on Sunday (the East German elections) and we want to be there."

CONNECTICUT'S DEFENSE TOO TOUGH FOR CALIFORNIA

<TEXT>
<P>
Connecticut advanced to the NCAA tournament's round of 16 because of the press, 
if not the place. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies, seeded first in the East Regional at Hartford, Conn., rattled 
California and excited their home-state crowd with a press that produced a 17-0 
run in the first five minutes and 16 steals overall and routed the Golden 
Bears, 74-54, in the second-round game. 
</P>
<P>
California was never really in the game. The Connecticut press, which led to 19 
steals and a 21-1 run in Thursday night's first-round victory over Boston 
University, was so effective that it seemed as if the Huskies had more players 
on the court than Cal. Virtually every pass was challenged, if not stolen. Even 
trying to dribble through it became an adventure and often resulted in a 
turnover. 
</P>
<P>
The press was the big difference, but the crowd didn't hurt the third-ranked 
Huskies, either. 
</P>
<P>
By being in Hartford, the Huskies (30-5) played the first two rounds only 28 
miles from their campus in Storrs and where they went 9-1 this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Being at home is a tremendous advantage," Cal Coach Lou Campanelli said. 
"Whether the press would be as effective on a neutral floor in a neutral 
setting is another thing." 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies' press, their trademark as they tied for the Big East 
regular-season title and won the conference tournament, was effective on nearly 
every possession for the game's first five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
If a Connecticut player didn't get a steal -- the Huskies had four in the run 
-- he tipped a ball that led to a turnover. 
</P>
<P>
California (22-10) averaged 13 turnovers per game this season. The Golden Bears 
had nine in the run alone. They had 16 by halftime and 28 for the game. 
</P>
<P>
Junior forward Roy Fisher had nine turnovers at halftime. As the player 
assigned to take the ball out of bounds, he was called for one five-second 
violation, avoided two others with timeouts and just beat the count several 
other times. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had an experience like that. It was a learning experience," said 
Fisher, who finished with 17 points, six rebounds and 10 turnovers. "It was 
kind of a panic reaction. I'm thinking, 'There's a guy. He's open,' and I 
didn't see the UConn guy hiding behind him." 
</P>
<P>
Connecticut led, 42-26, at halftime, and the closest that ninth-seeded 
California, which beat Indiana, 65-63, in the first round, could get in the 
second half was at 44-32 with 17:46 to play. Nadav Henefeld then scored on a 
drive, Campanelli was charged with a technical and the free throws by Chris 
Smith made it 48-32. 
</P>
<P>
California, which was making its first NCAA tournament appearance since 1960, 
outshot the Huskies from the field, 48.7% to 38.1%.

DUKE LOOKING FOR TRADITIONAL VICTORY OVER ST. JOHN'S TODAY

<TEXT>
<P>
Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski, fresh off a milestone 300th coaching victory, 
talked of tradition in schoolboy tones. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteenth-ranked Duke (25-8) against St. John's (24-9), and UCLA (21-10) 
against fifth-ranked Kansas (30-4). 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-one Final Four appearances represented today in the East Regional in 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"It sends chills through you as far as tradition goes," Krzyzewski said 
Saturday. "I think it will be a special afternoon. We're proud to be a part of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
St. John's Coach Lou Carnesecca is more concerned about the here and now. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a very poor student of history," Carnesecca said. "I don't know if history 
has anything to do with this tournament." 
</P>
<P>
He was more concerned with Duke's defense than Duke's tradition. Carnesecca has 
his own description of the Blue Devils' pressure defense. 
</P>
<P>
"First, they're in your pocket," he said. "Second, if you try to take out 
change, they're in the way. And, if you try to deposit it at the bank, they 
meet you at the vault."

GAUCHOS DON'T HAVE A SHOT AGAINST MICHIGAN STATE; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTHEAST REGIONAL: UC SANTA BARBARA CAN'T FIND THE BASKET IN A 62-58 LOSS TO 
SPARTANS THAT ISN'T THAT CLOSE.

<TEXT>
<P>
Unfortunately for lovers of long shots, beach basketball, bald centers and 
players named Carrick, Idris and Ulysses, the UCSB stripped across the chests 
of the underdogs stood for something else Saturday evening. 
</P>
<P>
UC Shoots Bricks. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, it has stood for UC Santa Barbara, which no longer stands in the 
NCAA tournament after the Gauchos' 62-58 loss to Michigan State in the second 
round of the Southeast Regionals. 
</P>
<P>
The final score is a deceit, for it gives the impression Santa Barbara actually 
had a shot at upending the No. 4-ranked Spartans (28-5). 
</P>
<P>
No, the only shot the Gauchos had kicked off the heel of the rim. 
</P>
<P>
Again and again and again. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara scored just 20 points in the first half and trailed by five at 
the break because it made 33% (nine of 27) of its shots. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara also shot 33% in the second half (12 of 36), but had to hustle to 
get there. The Gauchos opened the half by missing 13 of their first 16 shots, 
clanking away while a lethargic Michigan State offense used the time to slowly 
regain its bearings. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Santa Barbara hit its fourth basket of the second half, the 
Spartans led, 41-27. 
</P>
<P>
With 3:12 remaining, it was 51-34. With 1:10 left, it was 59-48. 
</P>
<P>
Two three-pointers and two free throws by the Gauchos closed the gap to four, 
which will make this game look a lot better in next season's Santa Barbara 
media guide than it did on the University of Tennessee basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm elated about two things," Michigan State Coach Jud Heathcote said 
afterward. "One, that we won the game and, two, that the game finally ended. 
</P>
<P>
"When the game was over and the score was close, believe it or not, I was 
pleased. (Santa Barbara Coach) Jerry Pimm is a longtime friend. Let's make it 
look like a close game instead of a blowout." 
</P>
<P>
But beneath the cosmetics, this game was, as Heathcote succinctly put it, 
"ugly. It was not a classic to watch." 
</P>
<P>
No kidding. Before entering the postgame interview room, Heathcote was grabbed 
by a reporter who told him, "Boy, for a No. 1 seed and a Big Ten champion, your 
team sure didn't look good." 
</P>
<P>
Heathcote couldn't argue. 
</P>
<P>
"You're right," he replied. "But we're not trying to look good. We're just 
trying to win." 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State won despite shooting 39% in the first half, going scoreless (on 
five shots) from three-point range and committing 16 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
This is known as playing down to the competition. If the Gauchos couldn't 
succeed in putting the ball in the basket, they succeeded at least in dragging 
the Spartans down with them. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, shooting isn't a problem for Santa Barbara (21-9). The Gauchos took a 
team field-goal percentage of 46.1 into Saturday's game, with center Eric 
McArthur (50.5%) and forward Gary Gray (54.8%) both above 50%. 
</P>
<P>
Against Michigan State, McArthur was three for eight, Gray three for 12 and, 
off the bench, Idris Jones chipped in with a chipper one-for-seven. 
</P>
<P>
Asked for an explanation, Pimm singled out the Michigan State defense. 
</P>
<P>
"We made a third of our shots," Pimm said. "You have to attribute it to the way 
they play. They play good, solid, aggressive defense and they're very physical. 
They got the best of the 'physicalness.' 
</P>
<P>
"We're not that physical. When you play a Jud Heathcote team, you better strap 
it on." 
</P>
<P>
Pimm had a point, which was more than could be said for some of his players. 
Spartan forward Ken Redfield dogged McArthur, who finished with eight points, 
and Michigan State's 6-10 center, Mike Peplowski, was able to alter more than a 
few Santa Barbara shots. 
</P>
<P>
But Carrick DeHart, who scored 23 points, saw circumstances a little 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
"We just missed 'em," DeHart said. "I really was not affected by their defense 
at all. We just haven't shot well lately, even against (first-round opponent) 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it's the fatigue factor after a long season. Who knows, really? Maybe it 
was the foul trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe. McArthur, whose 20 points carried Santa Barbara past Houston, picked up 
two quick fouls and was benched by Pimm with 14:30 left in the first half. Pimm 
kept him out 10 minutes, which may have proved a tactical error. 
</P>
<P>
While the Spartans struggled, the Gauchos' smaller lineup was unable to take 
advantage. The game was tied when McArthur departed. His replacement, Ulysses 
Akins, had a most treacherous journey. By the time McArthur returned, Michigan 
State had a 22-15 lead and was on the verge of pulling away. 
</P>
<P>
"That hurt us," DeHart said. "Without our big man, we couldn't control the 
boards. We had no intimidator inside. They came right down our throats." 
</P>
<P>
And McArthur was so pumped for this game. He even had his head shaved in 
anticipation of the event, a superstition apparently predicated on the belief 
that a clean head is a cool head. 
</P>
<P>
"I do that before big games," McArthur said with a smile. "Before a couple of 
the Vegas games, I go bald." 
</P>
<P>
He stopped smiling. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it didn't work today." 
</P>
<P>
For Santa Barbara, not much did. Trying to play David to Michigan State's 
Goliath, the Gauchos, taking their lead from their center, ended up more like 
Samson.

WEST REGIONAL: REBELS MAKE UNUSUAL SWITCH TO ZONE AFTER FAST START BY THE

<P>
On a day when second-ranked Nevada Las Vegas was beatable, the Rebels were not 
beaten. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they moved into the NCAA tournament's Sweet 16 for the fourth time in 
five years with a 76-65 West Regional victory over Ohio State before 12,896 at 
the Huntsman Center Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Buckeyes, with a starting lineup of one freshman, three sophomores and a 
junior, started fast and kept coming, fighting back after a 9-0 UNLV run erased 
their four-point lead in the first half and again after a 14-1 run put them 
behind by 13 with eight minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
But after Ohio State pulled to within 67-62 on Perry Carter's inside shot with 
2:07 left, UNLV finally shut the door. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels went to a spread offense with about two minutes remaining, and Greg 
Anthony made a three-point shot to give the Rebels an eight-point lead with 
1:23 to play. Anthony finished with 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
"Great teams have a way of winning ball games down the stretch," Ohio State 
Coach Randy Ayers said. "That's what UNLV did today." 
</P>
<P>
Anthony, playing despite a broken jaw, left the game earlier in the second half 
after suffering a cut that later required stitches when he dived for the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"We still had a chance until Anthony hit the three," Ayers said. "Good players 
step forward, and that's what Anthony did." 
</P>
<P>
It was a game in which UNLV needed people to step forward, one that started 
with Ohio State sophomore guard Mark Baker and freshman forward Jimmy Jackson 
making UNLV's man-to-man defense look slow-footed. 
</P>
<P>
"They just blew right by us," Rebel Coach Jerry Tarkanian said. "We were 
terrible. I couldn't get a timeout fast enough." 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian then made an unusual move: After the first five minutes, he switched 
to a zone defense for most of the game, playing less man defense than the 
Rebels had all year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Coach Tark made a great move when he switched to the zone," Ayers 
said. "It slowed us down quite a bit." 
</P>
<P>
UNLV (31-5) had to overcome several problems. Anderson Hunt missed all seven of 
his three-point attempts. Forward Larry Johnson and center David Butler both 
said they were feeling the effects of colds and the high altitude. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson still finished with 23 points and 16 rebounds, seven of them offensive, 
in only 28 minutes. Butler had 14 points and seven rebounds in 29 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Larry and David did a great job inside for us," Tarkanian said. 
"Overall, I thought when the game got tight we kept getting the ball inside, 
because we couldn't hit from the outside." 
</P>
<P>
Carter led the Buckeyes (17-13) with 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
For UNLV, it was a victory that gave the team confidence going into the West 
Regional at Oakland, where they will play Ball State Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest thing is (we didn't play that well and) we still won," Anthony 
said. "The only way we feel we can lose is if we don't play hard."

CS LONG BEACH SPUTTERS BADLY, LOSES, 78-62

It wasn't happy being placed in this regional in the first place, but Cal State 
Long Beach did nothing Saturday night to prove it deserved any breaks from the 
NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers came to this small college town and were defeated by the Ladyjacks of 
Stephen F. Austin, 78-62, in the second round of the West Regional before a 
noisy crowd of 4,675. 
</P>
<P>
"They out-executed and out-hustled us, and we never found our offensive 
rhythm," Long Beach Coach Joan Bonvicini said. 
</P>
<P>
Seniors Portia Hill and Connie Cole supplied most of the Ladyjacks' scoring, 
combining for 27 points in the first half, then finishing with 21 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
When Hill, the 6-foot-3 center, wasn't posting up to perfection and beating 
Angelique Lee to the basket, the 6-0 Cole was making short jump shots or 
grabbing one of her 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers committed 28 turnovers. They also communicated poorly throughout the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The only Long Beach player in double figures was Penny Moore, who had 26 
points, including 20 of the team's 36 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Guards Dana Wilkerson and Trise Jackson were a combined seven for 25 from the 
field and seemed unable to penetrate. 
</P>
<P>
Lee, playing her last game as a 49er, fouled out with 7:24 to play and was 
never a factor. 
</P>
<P>
"When somebody's faster than you, you've got to be a little bit smarter and 
hopefully play a containment type of game, and that's all we did," said 
Ladyjack Coach Gary Blair, whose 28-2 team will travel to Palo Alto for a 
semifinal Thursday against the winner of tonight's Georgia-Arkansas game. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers (25-9) will return to Long Beach today after being knocked out of the 
NCAA tournament at their earliest point ever. 
</P>
<P>
"Early in the year we had a very good team, we beat some very fine teams both 
at home and on the road," Bonvicini said. "And then, since about the first of 
the year, we've been pretty much an up and down team, and that's 
uncharacteristic of all the teams I've had."

Upsets in the NCAA basketball tournament Saturday weren't limited to the men's 
division. There were some in the women's field, too. And none was more of a 
surprise than Mississippi's 66-62 victory over fifth-ranked Nevada Las Vegas at 
Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Martin and Kimsey O'Neal each scored 17 points to lead the No. 24 Lady 
Rebels (22-9) in the second round of the West Regional. Mississippi will play 
Stanford in the regional semifinals Thursday night at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
Martin made six of eight shots, including three of four from three-point range. 
Pauline Jordan led UNLV (28-3), which led at halftime, 35-34, with 14 points 
and nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
No. 2 Stanford 106, No. 16 Hawaii 76 -- Trisha Stevens equaled her career high 
with 35 points as the Cardinal routed the Rainbows at Stanford in another West 
Regional second-round game. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens made a basket to open the second half and put Stanford ahead, 52-39. 
The Cardinal (28-1) scored 26 of the next 31 points over a 10-minute span and 
led, 78-44. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Mosley led Hawaii (26-4) with 28 points. 
</P>
<P>
No. 1 Louisiana Tech 89, No. 20 Southern Mississippi 70 -- Venus Lacy scored 32 
points to lead the unbeaten Lady Techsters in the second round of the Midwest 
Regional at Ruston, La. 
</P>
<P>
Lacy made 13 of 20 shots, blocked five shots and had two steals to help give 
the Lady Techsters (30-0) their fourth consecutive season with at least 30 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Mississippi (27-5) finished with a 27-5 record. 
</P>
<P>
No. 3 Washington 77, DePaul 68 -- Karen Deden scored eight points during a 22-2 
run in the final 7:10 of the first half to give the Huskies (27-2) a 43-24 
halftime lead and they went on to beat the Blue Demons (22-10) in the 
second-round game of the Mideast Regional at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderbilt 61, No. 10 Iowa 56 -- The Hawkeyes (23-6) scored seven consecutive 
points for a 50-45 lead with 6:11 left, but the Lady Commodores (23-10) used 
their height advantage to score 11 consecutive points for a 56-50 lead with 
2:06 remaining and went on to get the upset win in the second round of the 
Mideast Regional at Iowa City.

EQUUS MINI SETS PACE LIKE NONE OTHER AT LOS ALAMITOS TRACK

<P>
Her name, literally, means "little horse." And no four-footed performer on the 
Los Alamitos backstretch is so aptly titled. 
</P>
<P>
Rarely has one so small accomplished so much in as short a period of time as 
Equus Mini, a pony-sized pacing mare who regularly has put the screws to her 
bigger, stronger opponents the past several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
At less than 14 hands in height and weighing a bit more than 700 pounds, Equus 
Mini doesn't figure to command respect when on the track versus horses of 
"normal" dimensions, to whom she spots several inches and hundreds of pounds. 
</P>
<P>
But this four-year-old mare--yes, she's full grown--is no 97 pound weakling of 
the horsey set. In fact, when it comes to kicking dirt into faces, Equus Mini 
has been doing the kicking recently. 
</P>
<P>
Enroute to winning, that is. 
</P>
<P>
Equus Mini is not the most talented pacer on the grounds, but logic requires 
admission that none try harder. Certainly, contrasting her size with that of 
the hundreds of other pacers and trotters populating the Los Alamitos barn 
area, her vital organ figures to be a greater percentage of body weight than 
anyone else's. 
</P>
<P>
The cliche of a racehorse being all heart is entirely appropriate this time. 
Overseeing the little one during her season of big performances is 
owner-trainer Don Koenig, who thanks to "Mini's" efforts has a phenomenal 
training percentage this season with less than a month to go in the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Hoenig, 36, has nine horses on the Los Alamitos backside, and has had good ones 
in the past ll years of training. "I've had better horses," he confirms when 
speaking of Equus Mini. "But none that have been more fun." 
</P>
<P>
As is often the case in racing, the enjoyment wasn't planned. Koenig privately 
purchased the then-filly last summer, then took her and several other horses to 
Cloverdale, a track in British Columbia just across the Washington state 
border. 
</P>
<P>
Did he take them to race for good purses? To try a new track surface or a 
softer circuit? 
</P>
<P>
"I took horses up there to sell them," he says. "Our business wasn't much good 
down here and I hoped to turn over some horses up there before coming back down 
for the next season." 
</P>
<P>
Koenig succeeded in selling two horses, but one of those with a price on its 
head that went wanting was Equus Mini. At $8,000, none of the Cloverdale 
horsemen wanted this tiny pacer taking up a fuIl stall. 
</P>
<P>
"She didn't race real well up there, either," Koenig recalls, "The track is 
much deeper up there and it rains a lot, and she came down with a heel 
infection. It was nothing serious, and she could race, but she was a little run 
down and it showed in her races." 
</P>
<P>
So back to California came Koenig and "Mini". A California-bred, she was 
eligible to the restricted California Platinum Series late in 1989 at Los 
Alamitos. But an episode of breaking stride before the start of one race 
required her to re-qualify, and she missed the $20,000 series final. 
</P>
<P>
Such opportunities for big money are limited out West for standardbreds, but 
Hoenig remains philosophical. "She didn't like the bit I had on her, and that's 
all there was to it, Some horses are like that." 
</P>
<P>
Her growth already stunted, Equus Mini now had to be re-schooled. "I 
experimented some in training, and finally found the right combination." Koenig 
says. She was ready to begin her 1990 season in earnest January 23. 
</P>
<P>
The magic wasn't immediate. "Mini" raced herself into shape with a third and 
pair of fourths, going off at 222-1 on one occasion. More promising was her 
final quarter mile time of under 30 seconds each start. But February 9 found a 
diminutive mare in the Los Alamitos winners' circle after polishing off the 
final 440 yards in a brisk 29 seconds. She came back a week later to win again, 
this time in a career-best 1:58 1/5 for the mile. Seven nights later, again 
using a strong late kick, her little body pulled the bike and driver James 
Lackey from well off the lead to another triumph. After a late bid produced a 
second-place finish in her next race, Equus Mini and Lackey combined for yet 
another tally March 9 to complete a four-win cycle that began 28 nights 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
She has earned more than $12,000 already this year. 
</P>
<P>
Her March 9 triumph was significant in that she raced for an extended time on 
the outside "without cover," that is, there was no horse immediately in front 
of her to take the wind as the field moved around the track. Few horses win 
with such a journey, but Equus Mini refused to fold in the final eighth of a 
mile and kept her short legs moving until she posed for a winners' circle 
snapshot. 
</P>
<P>
Racing without cover? To fans at the track that night, she certainly was 
covered. She was, in fact, completely hidden. When Equus Mini races on the 
outside of a rival -- any rival -- on the backstretch, she cannot be seen from 
the grandstand. Not until she takes the lead is she in plain sight. 
</P>
<P>
And she has been stepping out on her own, in front, quite a bit lately, as if 
doing it for all the undersized competitors in the equine world.

STEINBRENNER WAS BLACKMAILED BY LAWSUIT INFORMANT, PAPER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
George Steinbrenner, owner of the New York Yankees, was blackmailed by an 
unemployed gambler who was involved in Steinbrenner's legal battle with 
outfielder Dave Winfield, according to the New York Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's editions, the News said Steinbrenner acknowledged paying $40,000 
Jan. 8 to Howard Spira of the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
Spira gave Steinbrenner information to use in his lawsuit against Winfield, but 
Steinbrenner said that was not the reason for the payoff. 
</P>
<P>
The paper said Spira signed an agreement promising never to disclose the payoff 
but threatened to make it public, along with their tape-recorded conversations, 
unless Steinbrenner gave him an additional $110,000 and a job at Steinbrenner's 
American Shipbuilding Co. in Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner has accused Spira of extortion and Spira is under investigation by 
the FBI, which raided the apartment where he lives with his parents, the paper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"If it was stupidity on my part, then it was," the News quoted Steinbrenner as 
saying in an interview Saturday. "But I honest to God felt that I could help 
this young man to get his life straight." 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner and Winfield came at odds when the owner learned that the 
outfielder's contract included a cost-of-living clause that made it worth 
several million dollars more than Steinbrenner thought. Steinbrenner also was 
required to make annual contributions to Winfield's foundation and the two 
wound up in a bitter lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Based on information from Spira, Steinbrenner charged that Winfield's agent, 
the late Al Frohman, had concocted a death-threat letter against Winfield 
during the 1981 World Series to provide an excuse for the outfielder's 
one-for-22 slump. The Yankees later reported to the baseball commissioner's 
office that Winfield made a usurious loan to a gambler; Spira says Winfield 
loaned him $15,000 and demanded $18,500 in repayment.

AGASSI, CONTROVERSY SEEM TO GO TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There were two upsets in men's tennis last week at Indian Wells. In one, Andre 
Agassi defeated Boris Becker. In the other, an entire day passed before Agassi 
caused a controversy. Hey, what took him so long? 
</P>
<P>
Agassi, who absolutely vacuums up trouble, managed to prove once again that he 
is the most perplexing figure in men's tennis. 
</P>
<P>
Although he studiously avoids taking it to grass, Agassi's game keeps 
improving. At 19, there may be no one better at returning serve or taking the 
ball early -- hitting ground strokes while the ball is on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
Yet at the same time, Agassi's penchant for stirring up controversy has never 
been more pronounced. Usually, Davis Cup is involved. 
</P>
<P>
If it isn't catching a ball served in a match in Argentina, then he's claiming 
in Ft. Myers, Fla., that he doesn't even "know how to spell coup," when there 
has been one that very day in Paraguay. If Agassi isn't calling his match with 
West German Carl-Uwe Steeb "a gimme" then he's losing that same match with an 
effort so poor, some say he gave up. 
</P>
<P>
But as brilliant as Agassi's tennis can be is how dreadful his behavior often 
is, and he plummeted to new depths last week in yet another Davis Cup 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi accepted U.S. captain Tom Gorman's invitation to play against 
Czechoslovakia. The team was announced. Then Agassi pulled out, saying he 
changed his mind. Gorman said he questioned Agassi's commitment to Davis Cup. 
Agassi criticized Gorman as weak and ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Krickstein, named by Gorman as a replacement, reflected on Agassi's 
change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people think what he did was pretty gutless," Krickstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Agassi's complaints about Gorman were sort of hard to follow, although 
a couple of his gripes were that Gorman wouldn't allow Agassi to go to the 
movies with his friends or have dinner with them. Few may have realized Gorman 
could be so cruel. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi also complained that Gorman was unfairly separating him from his 
entourage, which includes brother Phil, coach Nick Bollettieri, agent Bill 
Shelton, a hitting partner, a bodyguard and assorted buddies from Las Vegas. 
There is a growing number of people who believe Agassi would be better served 
if he did not rely so heavily on the advice of others. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he should make more of his own decisions," said Brad Gilbert, who 
joins Krickstein, Rick Leach and Jim Pugh for the match against Czechoslovakia. 
"And as for everything he said about Tom, just remember Agassi's still just 19 
and he's going to say some things." 
</P>
<P>
Gorman, who said during the turmoil that he wanted to open the lines of 
communication to Agassi, still has not spoken to him. 
</P>
<P>
More Andre: When he reneged on his agreement to play Davis Cup, Agassi cited 
his schedule, saying he needed three weeks off after playing at Key Biscayne, 
Fla. By contrast, Krickstein and Gilbert are playing at Key Biscayne, Prague, 
Orlando and then Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Agent Shelton said Agassi would play "special events" during his three weeks 
off. In one of them, on April 7 at the Forum, he will play Andrei Chesnokov as 
part of the Forum Tennis Challenge series. 
</P>
<P>
Grass root movement: At Wimbledon, the All England Club is thinking the 
unthinkable. John Curry, club chairman for only three months, is considering 
changing the dates of Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
Being pondered is delaying the start of the tournament for a week, leaving 
three weeks between the French Open and Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
Players have long maintained that there is not enough time to adjust from 
playing on slow clay courts to the fast grass courts of Wimbledon. This year's 
All England Championships begin June 25. The French Open ends June 11 in Paris. 
Both Grand Slam events last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Curry told the Associated Press that Wimbledon's playing dates could be altered 
only if the Assn. of Tennis Professionals and the Women's International Tennis 
Assn. propose such a change. The soonest there could be new dates for Wimbledon 
is 1992, Curry said. 
</P>
<P>
Mats' spot: Mats Wilander pulled out of the Lipton International Players 
Championship in Key Biscayne and is taking at least a month off from tennis. 
</P>
<P>
After winning three of the four Grand Slam tournaments and taking over the No. 
1 ranking in 1988, Wilander did not win a tournament last year and has dropped 
out to No. 11. He lost his last match, a first-rounder at Indian Wells, when he 
was upset by Swedish countryman Jan Gunnarsson, 7-6 (7-4), 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
"I was only physically present on the court," Wilander told Per Yng of the 
Goteborgs Posten, who is writing a book about Wilander. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I believe I give up without giving my best," Wilander said. "But if 
I don't give a 100% effort, I won't know how really bad I am." 
</P>
<P>
Hired hand: Krickstein, who will receive an appearance fee, has agreed to 
defend his Volvo/Los Angeles title July 30-Aug. 5 at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
The event, downgraded on the IBM/ATP tour, has no top 10 players designated to 
play it, so under the rules, promoter Bob Kramer and sponsor Volvo can legally 
offer appearance fees to attract big-name players, such as Krickstein. 
</P>
<P>
Kramer said the Volvo/Los Angeles tournament has decided upon ground rules for 
offering appearance fees -- to the defending champion, U.S. Davis Cup players 
and Grand Slam winners.

IS VACHON A PRETENDER TO THE THRONE?; 
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY: GRETZKY'S RELATIONSHIP WITH OWNER BRUCE MCNALL CASTS THE IMPRESSION 
THAT KING GENERAL MANAGER HAS LITTLE MORE THAN A TITLE.

According to other NHL general managers, the power behind the Kings' throne is 
not Rogie Vachon. 
</P>
<P>
Vachon's peers see owner Bruce McNall and center Wayne Gretzky as the men to 
deal with in trades and other matters of substance. Vachon may do the drudge 
work and have the title, they say, but the major moves are suggested by Gretzky 
and no deal is made without his approval. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically it's looked at as Wayne runs the show," one said. "Obviously, people 
think Rogie has his input, but there are situations that happen that he can't 
control because of the relationship Wayne has with the owner. The line (after 
the trading deadline passed) was that LA didn't make any trades because they 
couldn't get hold of Wayne." 
</P>
<P>
Said another general manager of Vachon: "He's looked on by the rest of the 
league as basically a puppet. He's a nice person and he does the best he can 
under tough circumstances. He's a guy with little to no background to have that 
job and he just rolls with the punches. People look at McNall as running the 
whole thing. Gretzky says what he thinks to McNall, and McNall tells Rogie to 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
Vachon has heard such comments before, and he listened to this latest round 
with a patient smile. He acknowledges that "everything goes around 99," when 
the team makes a move, but he said Gretzky does not have absolute power. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't run the team," Vachon said. "He doesn't make the decisions and the 
trades. For everything he's brought this franchise, when he has something to 
say, we have to listen. We'd be crazy not to ask his opinion. But if there's a 
final decision to be made, I make it. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't say to me, 'Do this and do that.' We listen if he has something to 
say because he's Wayne Gretzky. I can live with that." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever power Vachon has or doesn't have, he has earned ample sympathy from 
his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"Rogie is a nice guy. He's hired by Jerry Buss and then a new owner (McNall) 
comes in and he wants to have a high profile. What's poor Rogie supposed to 
do?" a third general manager said. "He either adjusts or loses his job. I think 
he's done the right thing. These jobs pay $150,000 and up and there's only 21 
of us. . . . I hate to knock the guy. He's adjusted to the circumstances 
involving his franchise." 
</P>
<P>
Rivals seem less sympathetic toward McNall. More than a few are rejoicing in 
the Kings' struggles, glad that McNall's millions and Gretzky's expertise 
haven't brought a winning season. 
</P>
<P>
"Other GMs can sort of laugh at him because he spent all that money for Gretzky 
and the other guys (such as Larry Robinson and Barry Beck) for nothing because 
the team's doing so badly," the general manager of an Eastern team said of 
McNall. "He's well liked. He's a nice guy. But had they been leading the Smythe 
Division, people might resent him because of his money." 
</P>
<P>
Much as they resent McNall's assets, they welcome his willingness to spend and 
the attention he has brought to a franchise in a major media center. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to give him credit for going out and getting the biggest player in 
the game and turning the team around, from a fiscal standpoint, and creating 
interest on the West Coast for expansion," the general manager of a Campbell 
Conference team said. "You can't overlook that they've certainly filled the 
building and made the franchise more valuable."

MATER DEI KEEPS TITLE IN SOUTH

<P>
After dominating the boys' State Division I final for three quarters, Santa Ana 
Mater Dei had to make several free throws in the final seconds to hold off San 
Francisco Riordan, 62-60, Saturday night before 14,629 at the Oakland Coliseum 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California teams have won all nine Division I titles since the 
state-wide playoff format began in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei (34-1) played nearly perfect basketball for the first 24 minutes, 
building a 46-36 lead heading into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Riordan, behind the three-point shooting of guards Dorion Manigo and Jaime 
Edwards, made things close at the end. The Monarchs needed all of Andy Karich's 
seven fourth-quarter free throws. 
</P>
<P>
"We were looking more at the clock in anticipation for the game to end and that 
cost us," Mater Dei guard Jason Quinn said. "We were just trying to get the 
game over after opening up that big lead." 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei seemed unstoppable in the first half, with Karich scoring seven first 
quarter points and Dan O'Neil coming off the bench to score 10 in the second. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs' defense made 6-foot-4 Dwayne Fontana, Riordan's leading scorer, a 
non-factor. 
</P>
<P>
With 6-8 Derek Stone, 6-7 Charlie Andres, 6-6 Karich and 6-5 David Boyle 
clogging the middle, Fontana scored three points in the first half and made 
three of 13 shots in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"They played really good defense in preventing us from getting into our 
offense," Fontana said. "Their size underneath made it tough on our inside 
passing game." 
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, Riordan gave a preview of its fourth quarter rally with 
two brief scoring bursts. Mater Dei was able to keep control of the game with 
individual efforts from Boyle and O'Neil. 
</P>
<P>
The Crusaders made it close on a three-pointer at the final buzzer by Manigo, 
who had 25 points and eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to give them credit because they did a great job shooting in the 
second half," said O'Neill, who scored 25 points. "But, we have a team where 
everyone has their nights. Tonight, just happened to be my night." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, it was just another close finish for a Northern California 
champion. In five of the last six Southern California wins, its teams have won 
by seven points or fewer.

Senior center Lisa Leslie shook off the effects of an undetermined illness 
Saturday night to lead Inglewood Morningside High School to its second 
consecutive State Division I girls basketball championship. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-5 Leslie, who was taken to a hospital after the game as a 
precautionary measure, had 35 points, 12 rebounds and seven blocked shots as 
Morningside held off Berkeley, 67-56, at the Oakland Coliseum Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"She was feeling bad enough where we thought about not letting her play," 
Morningside Coach Frank Scott said. "I kind of left it up to her. She wanted to 
do well in her last game." 
</P>
<P>
Leslie, who said she felt weak, nevertheless was at her best late in the game 
after Berkeley cut a 17-point, third-quarter deficit to 52-49 on a three-point 
shot by guard Vikki Horne with 4:45 left. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie responded with four consecutive baskets to build Morningside's lead to 
60-51 with 1:45 left. She scored 13 of the Lady Monarchs' final 15 points, 
mostly from close range against the Yellowjackets' smaller front line. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside (32-3) was the only Southern California team to win one of the five 
girls state finals. 
</P>
<P>
Tanda Rucker scored 25 points for Berkeley (31-2). Janet Davis added 14 points 
for Morningside.

IT WAS DEFINITELY JOCKEY'S DAY AT GULFSTREAM

<P>
A jockey looking for his first Kentucky Derby victory couldn't have had more 
encouragement than the rider astride the winner of the Florida Derby and the 
second-place finisher in the Swale Stakes at Gulfstream Park Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
After he had won the $500,000 Florida Derby with Unbridled and finished second 
to Housebuster with Summer Squall in the $57,250 Swale, Pat Day stood at his 
locker and flashed his best I-knew-it-all-the-time look. 
</P>
<P>
"This is St. Pat's day, isn't it?" Day said. 
</P>
<P>
Day, winner of three Eclipse Awards and eight races worth $1-million or more, 
has failed with seven mounts in the Kentucky Derby. But the two horses he rode 
Saturday in preps for the May 5 Derby would make other jockeys green with envy, 
on St. Patrick's or any other day. 
</P>
<P>
"It (a Derby victory) will come in God's good time," said Day. "If it's meant 
to be, it will come. I think I'm in an enviable position with these two 
horses." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Summer Squall's race -- the first defeat of his career -- boosted his 
Kentucky Derby prospects more than the Florida Derby did for Unbridled, who 
beat a mediocre field and ran 1 1/8 miles in a pokey 1:52, the stake's slowest 
running since 1955. The track record is 1:46 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall, who won five consecutive races while sprinting as a 2-year-old, 
made his first start since last August. The Storm Bird colt suffered a hairline 
fracture of a cannon bone last year, and then had his first race as a 
3-year-old postponed after he bled from the lungs during a workout. 
</P>
<P>
Running Saturday with an anti-bleeding medication, Summer Squall was beaten by 
a length in the seven-furlong Swale, losing to Housebuster, a sprinter who won 
his fifth consecutive race and third in a row this season at Gulfstream. 
Housebuster's time was an excellent 1:22 1/5, more than two seconds faster than 
his winning clocking in the Hutcheson five weeks ago, and three seconds better 
than 3-year-old colts who ran an allowance race an hour before. 
</P>
<P>
Unbridled, a son of Fappiano and Gana Facil, finished four lengths ahead of 
Slavic, the 2-1 favorite, who beat Run Turn by a neck. Run Turn was a length 
ahead of Top Snob, who was Unbridled's stablemate, both from trainer Carl 
Nafzger's barn. Country Day ran fifth, followed by Southland-based Single Dawn, 
Roanoke, Sunny Serve and Ross's Warning. 
</P>
<P>
Unbridled, earning $300,000 for his 92-year-old owner, Frances Genter of 
Minneapolis, was co-second choice with Roanoke and paid $7, $3.60 and $3.20. 
Slavic paid $3.60 and $3.40 and Run Turn returned $4.80. Unbridled carried 122 
pounds, the same weight as the second- and third-place horses. 
</P>
<P>
Unbridled was sold as a yearling for $75,000 by Tartan Farms, when the Florida 
breeding outfit was phasing itself out of the racing business. Unbridled won 
his first race at Arlington Park last August and won only one of his next seven 
starts, a minor stake at Calder Race Course Dec. 24. This year, Unbridled ran 
fifth in the Tropical Park Derby at Calder and was third in the Fountain of 
Youth at Gulfstream two weeks ago, finishing only a half-length behind the 
winner, Shot Gun Scott. 
</P>
<P>
"He should have won the Fountain of Youth," Day said. "We got behind horses 
with three-sixteenths of a mile left, and we had nowhere to go." 
</P>
<P>
Both Day and Nafzger said the slow time was unimportant. Nafzger, who used to 
ride bulls on the rodeo circuit, retrieved a racing cliche -- "Time is only 
important when you're in jail" -- to address the matter, and Day said: "The 
track was dead. Summer Squall, though, ran a very big race against the clock." 
</P>
<P>
Nafzger said Unbridled should like 1 1/4 miles, the Kentucky Derby distance. 
"The distance will be no problem," the trainer said. "We knew after his third 
race that he wasn't a sprinter. And he proved something else today. He likes 
people (the crowd was 28,470). That's a great attribute for a horse going into 
the Kentucky Derby." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall was examined after his race and showed no sign of bleeding. . . . 
Trainer Scotty Schulhofer started three 3-year-olds on the card, and won with 
the one that had gotten the least attention. Cardoba, an English-raced horse 
making his first American start, won by 1 1/2 lengths going seven furlongs.

SANTA ANITA;

<P>
HAIL ATLANTIS MIGHT GET DERBY SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Running a filly in the Santa Anita Derby and coming back a month later in the 
Kentucky Derby worked once for Wayne Lukas, so will he try it again? 
</P>
<P>
Hail Atlantis' seven-length victory in the $212,800 Santa Anita Oaks Saturday 
had Lukas thinking about another Winning Colors parlay. 
</P>
<P>
"I might have to take a hard look at supplementing her to the Santa Anita 
Derby," Lukas said. Such a move would cost $20,000, which would be due three 
days before the April 7 race. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm definitely going to call Tom Meeker (Churchill Downs president) and put in 
her name (for the Triple Crown series for a $3,000 fee). She's on her way to 
the Kentucky Oaks, but I would like to be sitting there (the) Friday (before 
the Derby) with the option." 
</P>
<P>
To mention any derby or the Kentucky Oaks in connection with Hail Atlantis 
would have been ludicrous last year. 
</P>
<P>
She was beaten 21 lengths in her debut in July at Hollywood Park. A couple of 
weeks later, she finished fifth, 20 1/4 lengths behind. Stretching out 15 days 
later, she showed brief speed, then was eased when she bled. 
</P>
<P>
Since returning Jan. 6, the 3-year-old Seattle Slew filly hasn't been worse 
than second in five starts. 
</P>
<P>
Making her stakes debut in the Grade I Oaks, Hail Atlantis easily took the lead 
with a :22 4/5 first quarter, then simply extended it under Gary Stevens. She 
was timed in 1:43 flat for 1 1/16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Her stablemate, Bright Candles was second, 1 1/2 lengths in front of 13-10 
favorite Fit To Scout, who never fired after her much-troubled trip in the Las 
Virgenes three weeks earlier. She was a neck better than Cheval Volant, whose 
stakes-winning streak ended at three. 
</P>
<P>
In winning for the third time in eight career appearances, Hail Atlantis 
provided Lukas with his third consecutive victory in the Santa Anita Oaks and 
Stevens with his fourth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"What a stride this filly's got," said Stevens, whose other triumphs came 
aboard Timely Assertion, Winning Colors and Imaginary Lady. "She reminds me a 
lot of (Kentucky Derby winner) Winning Colors. She has the same kind of action. 
</P>
<P>
"She was just loping out there. She's a long-skipping thing, rates herself and 
still reserves something for the stretch. I've noticed dramatic improvement in 
each of her last four races. 
</P>
<P>
"She knows where the quarter-pole is. When she drops her right lead, she goes 
to running." 
</P>
<P>
Stylish King's 1990 debut was over before it really started. 
</P>
<P>
The highly-regarded son of Roberto, who had been training superbly for his 
first race as a 3-year-old, was eliminated at the start. He finished sixth at 
7-10 odds. 
</P>
<P>
On the sidelines since he finished fourth at 4-5 in the Hollywood Prevue Dec. 6 
at Hollywood Park, Stylish King veered out at the break, bumped solidly with 
Blue Gum, and that was basically it for those two in a race won by 11-1 shot 
Hawaiian Pass. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I could see was that his left hind leg wasn't set under him," 
Eddie Delahoussaye said. "He felt fine to me because his front legs were 
straight. When he broke, he lost that foot and fell to his right." 
</P>
<P>
Delahoussaye added that Stylish King, who was considered a Santa Anita Derby 
possibility, seemed fine coming back afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kent Desormeaux, who has made his way into the top 10 locally, won't be at 
Santa Anita two days next week. He will be in Baltimore Wednesday for a hearing 
regarding a disputed purse and, on Sunday, will ride Passing Ships in a race in 
Saudi Arabia. . . . Prepping for the San Bernardino Handicap April 1, Santa 
Anita Handicap winner Ruhlmann worked five furlongs in :58 4/5 Saturday 
morning. Olympic Prospect, who disappointed when heavily favored in the Phoenix 
Gold Cup, went the same distance in 1:00 2/5. He is scheduled to return in the 
Potrero Grande Handicap April 4.

Appliances Can Often Be Fixed Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
If you're having a problem with a major appliance, you may be tempted to throw 
it out and buy a new one. 
</P>
<P>
Don't be hasty, advises the Major Appliance Consumer Action Panel. 
</P>
<P>
If you contact an authorized service agency or the customer relations office of 
the manufacturer, you may save money and hassle, and in some cases even have 
the appliance replaced. 
</P>
<P>
The panel suggests that you first reread the use and care booklet and check the 
appliance's plug, fuses, pilots and controls. You may discover the problem 
yourself. 
</P>
<P>
Once you're sure the problem is with the appliance, contact an authorized 
service agency for a written diagnosis of the problem, a list of parts required 
for repair, and an estimate of costs for both parts and labor. 
</P>
<P>
Then write to the manufacturer's customer relations office, usually listed in 
the use and care booklet which comes with the appliance. 
</P>
<P>
Describe the complaint clearly and include copies of the service agency's 
diagnosis, along with proof of purchase, and model and serial numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Tell the manufacturer what you think is a reasonable solution. Be sure to 
include your address and a daytime telephone number, along with copies of 
service receipts and correspondence relating to the repair. 
</P>
<P>
If you're still not satisfied, contact MACAP, a volunteer mediation group made 
up of industry professionals. It is sponsored by the Assn. of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
The panel will review your complaint, contact the manufacturer again and 
recommend a nonbinding solution, when appropriate. The panel is at 20 N. Wacker 
Drive, Chicago, Ill. 60606.

COMMERCIAL SCENE: FIRMS SELL HEADQUARTERS, STAY ON AS RENTERS; 
</P>
<P>
LEASE-BACKS: SOME COMPANIES FIND THAT SELLING THEIR REAL ESTATE IS THEIR BEST 
STRATEGY FOR RAISING CASH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON GALPERIN, Galperin is a Los Angeles-based free-lance writer who has 
covered the commercial real estate scene for several years. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: What do companies such as Northrop, Blue Cross, Dataproducts and 
Products Research &amp; Chemical Corp. have in common? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Sale-lease-backs. Each of these companies has sold a chunk of its real 
estate holdings, yet continues to operate at the same locations -- but as 
tenants. 
</P>
<P>
One advantage to becoming a big company is that the business can stop paying 
rent and buy its own building instead. Within the last several years, however, 
a long list of businesses have been reversing this pattern by selling off their 
real estate and opting for a lease. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to happen a lot more," predicts Daniel E. Powell, president of 
CityPacific Commercial Real Estate Services. 
</P>
<P>
"Especially with the demise of junk bonds," Powell reasoned, "companies will 
need to look at alternative ways to raise capital." And, he added, what better 
source of cash is there for a company than selling off a piece of real estate 
that has accelerated in value? 
</P>
<P>
For most public companies, simply taking out a loan on the property doesn't 
make sense. 
</P>
<P>
For tax and accounting reasons, only the purchase price of a property is listed 
on a company's balance sheet. So, if a property was bought for $1 million and 
is worth $10 million today, its still gets listed as a $1 million asset. 
</P>
<P>
A $10 million loan on the property, however, shows up as a $10 million 
liability -- so the company may look like it has more liabilities than assets 
if it takes out a mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
A direct sale with no lease-back often requires a company to pay capital gains 
taxes that can eat up a third of the property's appreciation. But with a 
sale-lease-back, said accountant Ron Silver, the seller can skirt such taxes. 
</P>
<P>
This strategy has been most popular with single-tenant industrial buildings, 
added Silver, who is director of entrepreneurial services at Ernst &amp; Young 
in Century City. 
</P>
<P>
Managers and corporate raiders trying to facilitate a leveraged buyout of their 
company have also used the strategy to raise cash for their acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
A prime example is Dataproducts Corp. in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, DPC Acquisition Partners tried to finance a takeover of Dataproducts 
by agreeing in advance to sell the company's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The buyout fell though, but Dataproducts' executives cut a deal to sell their 
land to Trizec Properties Inc. and use the money to rebuild the company while 
fighting off any unfriendly suitors. Trizec, in turn, secured a well-located 
property suitable for development in several years. In the meantime, the buyer 
gets a stable tenant too. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers Paul Locker and Tony Maniscalchi of The Prudential Stevenson Real 
Estate completed the sale and lease-back of 14 small buildings in Glendale that 
serve as home to Products Research &amp; Chemical Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done quite a few of these transactions in the last year," Locker said. 
In his most recent deal, the sellers get to stay on as tenants for the next 
five years. The buyers -- 17 of them to be exact -- buy not only the property, 
but time to negotiate alternative uses for the property when the lease expires. 
</P>
<P>
Not everybody is convinced that sale-lease-backs have a bright future, though. 
Eventually, companies will realize they've sold out and have no place to go, 
said Tony Yocham, president of the Reichman Group in Newport Beach. "What 
happens at the end of the lease?" 
</P>
<P>
"It is as if you've sold you're birthright," Yocham said. Initial lease 
payments may be low -- but eventually a rent escalation clause cames to haunt 
the lessee. 
</P>
<P>
As American businesses are forced to think about long-term versus merely 
short-term profits, he predicted, the sale-lease-back phenomenon will lose its 
current popularity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leases 
</P>
<P>
 -- Three new tenants have signed leases with JMB/Urban Development at the 
soon-to-be-completed 1999 Avenue of the Stars office tower in Century City. Law 
firm O'Melveny &amp; Myers has committed itself to 60,000 square feet on three 
floors; Act III Communications, an entertainment firm founded by Norman Lear, 
will occupy 41,000 square feet on two floors; and merchant bankers Wasserstein 
Perella Group will fill 10,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, First Los Angeles Bank has expanded its planned occupancy to 
nearly 33,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
These most recent leases have an aggregate value of more than $70 million, with 
terms ranging from 10 to 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Consumer electronics retailer Silo has leased 318,000 square feet of 
distribution space in Fontana's Lincoln Industrial Center. The Staubach Co. 
represented Silo in its 10-year, $9.3-million lease. Coldwell Banker 
represented the lessor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Developments 
</P>
<P>
 -- Trammell Crow is nearing completion of renovation and addition work at 
Parkway La Mirada, a $41 million business park fronting Valley View Boulevard 
in La Mirada. The 24-acre site has 402,000 square feet of office, service 
center and retail space, including The Atrium -- a four-story office building 
that formerly was headquarters of Denny's International. 
</P>
<P>
Trammell Crow and joint-venture partner Copley Real Estate Advisors are set to 
open a 51,000-square-foot office building called The Landmark in June. 
</P>
<P>
In Westlake Village, Trammell Crow has bought the Olive Grove Shopping Center 
from Mitsui Manufacturers and is planning to convert the 8-acre site to an 
office center to be known as The Watercourt. The developer and joint-venture 
partner New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. are scheduled to reopen the 
center in September, after completing a $10-million rehab. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Construction work started recently on Bentall Executive Centre -- a 
two-phase office project at 1551 Tustin Ave. in Santa Ana. Phase I includes a 
10-story, 205,000-square-foot office building and a seven-level parking 
structure valued at $35 million. The project is owned by Bentall/Westminister 
Partners, a general partnership made up of Bentall Properties Inc. of Orange 
and Tanasana Properties Inc., a unit of United Kingdom-based Yattendon 
Investment Trust. Financing is being provided by The Royal Bank of Canada.

YEAR AFTER SPILL AT VALDEZ: 'HOW CLEAN IS CLEAN?' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
KNIGHT ISLAND, Alaska 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bryan Trimm crouched in his awkward survival suit and dipped a finger in the 
iridescent gray liquid. "Oil," said the geologist, holding up his lubricated 
digit for inspection. 
</P>
<P>
To get to the goo, he had punched a hole through rock-crusted asphalt 
blanketing a nameless beach on the east coast of this uninhabited island in 
Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
Farther up the shore, other workers dug more holes, shoveling 8, 10, 12 inches 
deep before coming to the bottom of the tarry oil layer. Over a rise, a marsh 
lay so heavily matted with oil that it reminded one viewer of a toxic dump. 
</P>
<P>
People and nature have had a year to cope with the worst oil spill in U.S. 
history. Some areas now show few signs of the oil that soaked them, but others 
still bear gooey scars from the night last March 24 when the supertanker Exxon 
Valdez strayed out of normal shipping lanes and ripped open its hull on rocky 
Bligh Reef. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Exxon's $2-billion, 12,000-person cleanup and harsh winter storms that 
scrubbed some dirty beaches clean, fishermen say dead sea otters still 
sometimes wash onto beaches. And just last week, state regulators said the 
waters around Eleanor Island -- recently cited by Exxon as one of its cleanup 
success stories -- are too dirty to fish for shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
With the weather letting up, Alaskans await resumption of cleanup efforts. 
Exxon Corp. President Lee R. Raymond last week promised to spend whatever is 
"reasonably" needed to make the state whole again, but for the most part 
Alaskans themselves believe their ruggedly beautiful state will never be the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
Cleanup aside, they continue to deal with the social and political fallout from 
the spill, from the disruption of Native American villages that subsisted for 
centuries on fishing to fundamental reforms in the way tankers are run and 
regulated. 
</P>
<P>
And as far as the environment is concerned, they have to see if they can agree 
on what to settle for. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still all of these tough questions: How clean is clean?" said Jim 
Butler, special assistant to the Kenai Peninsula Borough mayor. "Things will 
never be as clean as they were, so we have to decide how clean we can make 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Such decisions are made more difficult by a tense, adversarial atmosphere. 
Hundreds of lawsuits, led by state and federal criminal complaints against 
Exxon, have prompted lawyers to gag scientists. Data on wildlife damage and 
lingering environmental woes are made public only if lawyers decide they do not 
hinder potential legal strategies. 
</P>
<P>
On the most controversial issues, such as the observed impact on bald eagle 
nesting or the recovery rate of intertidal organisms, little detailed 
information is made public. 
</P>
<P>
When research is released, it often is treated cynically, even when all parties 
agree. Assurances from state, federal and Exxon scientists of the safety of 
eating locally caught fish, for example, was met with skepticism in native 
villages that have no choice but to eat what they catch in the waters at their 
door. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been burned," Butler said with resignation. "If you tell them an area 
has been cleaned, they just don't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
The secrecy and information control has soured some of the goodwill Exxon has 
engendered with its lavish cleanup effort, which pumped an estimated 
$53-million worth of purchases and salaries into Valdez alone -- an isolated 
port town with only 3,500 residents on the day before the spill. 
</P>
<P>
So, too, do the complicated formulas Exxon is using to compensate fishermen who 
were hurt when the spill forced the state to shut down lucrative salmon and 
other fishing seasons from Cordova to Kodiak, 350 miles to the west. 
</P>
<P>
"Exxon keeps playing the float game with us," said Chip Treinen, a Kodiak 
fisherman. "They keep saying, any week now, any week now, we'll pay. I've been 
hearing that since last July." 
</P>
<P>
Such delays are due in part to the difficulty inherent in applying strict 
mathematical formulas to the vagaries of the seas. Exxon wants to base its 
compensation on past catches; fishermen prefer calculating an average share of 
available catch, a formula that might double payments. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Meacham of the state Fish and Game Department said that even with a 
spill-interrupted salmon season last year, fishermen hauled in 23.8 million 
salmon from Prince William Sound. That is more than the 10-year average of 20 
million, he said, but less than half of the 48 million fish state officials 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
The oil may have played some part in the disappointing catch, he said, but 
nobody knows how much -- or at least no one will say until hundreds of lawsuits 
filed by fishermen against Exxon are heard in court. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all extremely frustrating for us," Treinen said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there is evidence that the worst may be over for fishermen. Tests show 
that fin fish show no sign of oil contamination at all, and only a small number 
of shellfish have been found to be contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
Otters, meanwhile, have returned in large numbers off the fishing town of 
Cordova, and bald eagles still can be seen in numbers on the uninhabited 
islands that dot the sound. Porpoises playfully swim alongside fishing boats as 
they plow through the notoriously rough winter seas in the area. 
</P>
<P>
But conservationists and others fear lasting effects. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious to us that the full extent of the damage will not be known for 
several years," said Eric Jorgensen, a lawyer for the Sierra Club Legal Defense 
Fund in Anchorage. "For example, the small (salmon) fry that left the area in 
the middle of the spill will not be back for several years. Until they come 
back, we won't know how they are affected. 
</P>
<P>
"The same is true with intertidal life, the starfish and all the other 
organisms that live on the shoreline. I think we'll have to wait several years 
to see any chronic effects from living in areas with lingering pollution." 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear what effect the spill will have on the region's bird population. 
More than 30,000 dead sea birds -- mostly varieties of ducks and diving birds 
-- were found last year, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has suggested 
that as many as 90,000 to 270,000 birds may actually have died, with the bulk 
swept out to sea or eaten by other animals. But it cautioned that "whether bird 
losses from the spill represent biologically significant losses in Alaska . . . 
remains to be seen." 
</P>
<P>
"The sound may be very resilient in some ways and not so in others," said Greg 
Erickson, director of the Oil Spill Impact Assessment and Restoration Division 
of the state Department of Fish and Game. "We need more science to know which 
is which. I don't, however, think we're ever going to take the sound back to 
the way that it was before the spill. Nature is not like a movie projector you 
can just run backwards." 
</P>
<P>
Exxon President Reynolds concedes that scientists may be able to detect 
evidence of the spill even after his company finishes its cleanup. But he said 
tourists and other recreational users of the area should be challenged to 
detect evidence of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
"I think in not too long a time . . . we will not be able to tell what 
happened," he said after announcing Exxon's plans to resume the cleanup effort 
that was suspended last Sept. 15 because of harsh winter weather in the Gulf of 
Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Otto Harrison, Exxon's Alaska Operations Manager, said the oil giant hopes to 
resume cleanup work in May, after a detailed work plan is reviewed and approved 
by the U.S. Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
That plan will be developed after 20 teams of five state, federal and Exxon 
scientists inspect shoreline identified last fall as still moderately to 
heavily oiled. The detailed shoreline assessment was conducted by the Alaska 
Department of Environmental Conservation. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary plans released last week by Exxon indicated that the oil company 
intends to abandon two controversial, labor-intensive cleanup processes used 
last summer -- the hand-polishing of individual rocks and steam cleaning of 
whole beaches. Polishing was criticized as ineffective while steam cleaning was 
seen as too effective -- it was blamed for sterilizing the beaches of valuable 
intertidal organisms while it cleaned oil from cobbles. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison said Exxon will focus on "less intrusive" methods this year. One such 
method is to have small crews with pickaxes and shovels dig up tar mats -- 
asphalt-like crusts of weather-dried oil. Another is to spray nitrogen and 
phosphorous fertilizers on oiled beaches to promote the rapid growth of 
microorganisms that naturally break down oil. 
</P>
<P>
"Exxon's general portrayal of the way work will proceed -- small groups working 
selected areas, an emphasis on techniques that minimize environmental 
disruption -- are consistent with the state's view of the season ahead," said 
Dennis Kelso, commissioner of the Alaska Department of Environmental 
Conservation. 
</P>
<P>
How many of those small groups will be needed will not be known until after 
completion of the spring beach survey, which is scheduled to begin March 28. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, state and federal lawmakers both are moving ahead with 
legislation to tighten up regulation of the oil industry and improve the 
state's ability to respond to future spills. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper introduced four bills last month that would authorize 
the state to conduct its own inspections of tankers operating in state waters, 
let state inspectors examine the Alyeska pipeline terminal in Valdez without 
prior consent, impose stricter spill-response requirements on shippers and 
increase civil penalties for certain spills by 500%. 
</P>
<P>
Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., the joint entity that operates the Trans Alaska 
Pipeline and the Valdez oil terminal, already has bolstered safety and spill 
response. Escort vessels packed with emergency spill-containment gear now 
accompany each tanker as they steam through the area, tankers that have not 
filed emergency plans are not permitted to dock, and a fully staffed 
skimmer-barge is on constant standby in a cove on Naked Island in the middle of 
the sound. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard, meanwhile, has modified its radar to improve coverage of 
Prince William Sound, and it has established a permanent new, round-the-clock 
position of watch supervisor to improve oversight of tanker traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"We're none of us any longer as naive as we were," Chrystal said. "We will 
never again be as complacent as we were on March 23 last year." 
</P>
<P>
Change has also come to the people of Alaska, especially those in the fishing 
villages hit hardest by the oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
In the months after the spill, a staff member for Cowper's Oil Spill 
Coordinating Office recalled comforting a fisherman found sobbing in a Cordova 
street. Police in Valdez said their jail filled to overflowing with arrests, 
primarily of transient cleanup workers who killed some of their rare idle hours 
in one of the town's five saloons before driving to the temporary camps that 
had mushroomed around town. 
</P>
<P>
Such camps were essential during the height of the cleanup last summer, when an 
estimated 10,000 temporary residents briefly overwhelmed the town. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be like dumping a million people into Los Angeles," said Valdez Mayor 
Lynn Chrystal. "Crime skyrocketed, and we had problems with everything down to 
sewage treatment, as anybody who lives out near the sewage treatment plant can 
attest." 
</P>
<P>
Grants from Exxon ameliorated these problems and permanently expanded the 
city's sewage plant. Exxon gave more than $9 million to local governments in 
the spill area to help them cope with the influx of workers. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those transients were well-paid -- Exxon paid $16.69 an hour in a jobs 
market where many people earned as little as one-fourth that rate or were 
unemployed. Meanwhile, state officials said people who normally would be hired 
by fishing boats or canneries could not work at all because many fisheries were 
canceled, often at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
These problems were reflected in a sharp increase in the demand for social 
services. The number of clients at the rural mental health clinics in Valdez 
and Homer doubled after the spill and increased by 50% in Kodiak. Alcohol and 
drug abuse tripled in Homer and rose by 28% in Cordova. 
</P>
<P>
To the surprise of some social workers, life seemed to ease up over the winter 
and people started to regain their sense of humor. During the recent Valdez 
Winter Carnival, people flocked to a musical play, "Tanker on the Rocks," that 
satirized all aspects of the accident, including Exxon, regulators and pipeline 
workers themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are finally just now beginning to be able to laugh about it and 
have fun with it," said Terry Wilson, a reporter at the weekly Valdez Vanguard 
newspaper. "Three months ago, I don't think we could have (laughed)."

B-2 BOMBER A VISIBLE TARGET FOR BUDGET AX; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS: SUPPORT FOR STEALTH PLANE IS ERODING FAST. LAWMAKERS LOOK TO 
$75-BILLION PROJECT TO CUT THE DEFICIT.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The B-2 Stealth bomber, the sleek, sinister-looking Air Force strike plane that 
is designed to elude enemy radar, is about to run into heavy -- and possibly 
fatal -- flak in the 101st Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Anxious to find money to divert to domestic programs, both liberal and 
conservative lawmakers are setting their sights on the $75-billion B-2 project 
as the most obvious target for making the military cuts that will be needed to 
reduce the deficit or finance new spending elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
If its critics prevail, the prized but controversial bomber program could be 
scaled back sharply from the 132 planes that the Air Force wants to build. Some 
lawmakers want to stop the B-2 just as it is lifting off the runway, refusing 
to authorize any more than the 16 bombers that either already have been built 
or are in the production pipeline. Right now, they seem unlikely to prevail, 
but momentum for such a "cap" is building steadily. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Congress seems almost certain to deal the B-2 program a serious blow, 
possibly laying the groundwork for years of guerrilla warfare on Capitol Hill, 
as happened with the equally controversial MX missile. In the end, it is 
unlikely that more than two wings of the aircraft -- about 60 B-2s in all -- 
could survive what one Capitol Hill aide called a "dribbling to death" at 
Congress' hands. 
</P>
<P>
Even the B-2's longtime backers have begun to lose heart -- and conviction. 
"The merits of the program have been lost long ago in the frenzy of defense 
budget cutting," said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). "I'm very skeptical about its 
future as a program at all." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the result could be to drive the prorated cost of each B-2 far 
above the current $570-million-per-aircraft price tag, jeopardize ratification 
of the Administration's strategic arms reduction treaty, known informally as 
START, and plunge the Northrop Corp. -- the prime contractor for the 
beleaguered plane -- into serious financial trouble. 
</P>
<P>
For Southern California, where the B-2 program could spawn more than 17,000 
jobs under current plans for peak production, the crippling of the bomber 
program could mean visible economic disruption. 
</P>
<P>
The political maelstrom surrounding the B-2 is fast becoming a nightmare for 
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who has been publicly touting the program as one 
of the Pentagon's highest priorities, despite what some defense officials say 
are some personal misgivings. Although Cheney has ordered an internal review of 
the B-2 effort, due later this month, he is expected to continue to support the 
program, though possibly at a slightly lower production level. 
</P>
<P>
But the program is facing fierce head winds on Capitol Hill. To some lawmakers, 
the lessening of tensions with the Soviet Union is threatening to make the B-2 
a bomber without a mission. Others fear that spending on the program is going 
too fast, outstripping the pace of testing that is needed to make sure the 
revolutionary design will work. 
</P>
<P>
Most, however, are daunted by the $75-billion price tag. Congress already has 
approved some $26.8 billion of the total, most of it for research and 
development. 
</P>
<P>
With those factors now in play, the B-2 program is solidly locked on 
congressional radar screens as this year's easiest target for would-be military 
budget slashers. "Something's got to give somewhere in the strategic program, 
and the B-2 is vulnerable on a lot of fronts," Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) said. 
"It'll be a big fight." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the Bush Administration, which has not begun its most intensive 
lobbying for the B-2, may yet salvage the program on the strength of the 
plane's revolutionary design and its pivotal future role in the nation's 
nuclear deterrent force. 
</P>
<P>
But the list of defectors seems to be widening almost daily. Even conservative 
Republicans, who previously have been the program's staunchest supporters, seem 
to be abandoning the program in droves. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to tell you, I have to take a look at (the B-2)," Sen. Trent Lott 
(R-Miss.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, recently told an 
Air Force general. "The world climate is different. The cost is astronomical. I 
just have to ask myself, do we have to have the B-2?" 
</P>
<P>
Rep. John R. Kasich (R-Ohio), who is leading a fight in the House to halt 
production of the B-2 immediately, counts some 30 GOP House members in support 
of his plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had calls from Republicans that stunned me -- conservative, pro-defense 
guys who call and tell me they're thinking of switching," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Even lawmakers whose districts include contractors for the B-2 -- another 
once-formidable lobbying group for the program -- appear to be switching sides, 
a factor that has eroded the support the Pentagon could have expected to 
command for a program whose contracts have been spread over 46 states and 383 
congressional districts. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most prominent is Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.). Although the Golden 
State's 49 B-2 contractors could expect to reap some $32.1 billion -- almost 
half the funds allocated for the B-2 program -- Cranston is now a leader in the 
move to cap the program where it is, contending that the democratization in 
Central Europe has created "a totally different situation." 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't conceive of costs getting this high," Cranston added. "When we're 
looking for a badly needed peace dividend, this is the most likely place to 
start," he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
But the opposition in Congress is not only over the B-2's cost. To many 
lawmakers, the bomber program has become a larger battle over which branch of 
government will set the parameters for U.S. arms control policy -- Congress or 
the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The B-2's role in the larger skirmish comes because of a loophole in the START 
agreement that the two superpowers are negotiating. Although the accord 
technically limits the United States and the Soviet Union to 6,000 long-range 
nuclear warheads apiece, it also contains a fine-print clause that counts some 
strategic bombers, such as the B-2, as single warheads -- even if they are 
chock-full of nuclear bombs. If all 132 B-2s were built, that would give the 
United States about 2,500 "free" warheads that otherwise would not be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the White House has contended that the B-2 will become the 
centerpiece of the American strategic nuclear deterrent once the START 
agreement finally is signed. Gen. John T. Chain, head of the Strategic Air 
Command, has warned that the United States will not be able to threaten vital 
Soviet targets if the B-2 program is not continued. And a senior Administration 
official declared recently that if Congress cancels the B-2, the Administration 
will have to "go back to the drawing board" on the entire START agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"The B-2 is the most important element of the START agreement," Chain said in 
recent testimony. 
</P>
<P>
But the Administration's arguments have drawn hostile fire in Congress, where 
the B-2's critics charge that the Administration is trying to hold the START 
agreement hostage to force congressional approval of the plane. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of our arms control positions is to enhance deterrence and 
stability, not to protect a weapons system," said Rep. Howard L. Berman 
(D-Panorama City), chairman of the House Arms Control Caucus, who also has 
joined the fight to cancel further production of the B-2. "The Administration 
will use the START agreement to justify every single part of their strategic 
modernization program. . . . I just don't think many people are going to be 
swayed." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of going "back to the drawing board," Berman and other Democrats have 
urged the Bush Administration to go back to the negotiating table -- and 
persuade the Soviets to change the bomber counting rule. Some lawmakers have 
warned that if it doesn't, Congress would force the change itself, using its 
power of the purse to alter presidential decisions on what kinds of weapons -- 
and how many -- the U.S. nuclear arsenal must include. 
</P>
<P>
"The bomber counting rule is driving this issue, and we ought to be seizing the 
opportunity to negotiate major new changes in (it)," said Rep. Dave McCurdy of 
Oklahoma, a moderate Democrat who is trying to work out a compromise. "Our 
frustration as Democrats is we don't have the White House, and (therefore) we 
don't issue the guidance from on high." 
</P>
<P>
But one Democrat, Rep. Norm Dicks of Washington, has become an unlikely ally to 
the Bush Administration. Dicks, the B-2 program's leading congressional 
proponent, has urged that Bush threaten to veto any defense bill that does not 
call for the eventual production of at least 80 to 100 B-2 bombers, on the 
grounds that the START treaty will not win critical military backing unless the 
airplane is built. 
</P>
<P>
Given such rising tensions, the best hope for B-2 supporters this year may be 
to put off any serious confrontation until the two sides have a chance to cool 
off. Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, 
has proposed a "pause" in B-2 production that would give the Administration 
time to refine its arms control positions and to weigh the need for the bomber 
in light of changes in the Soviet military threat. 
</P>
<P>
It also would allow the Air Force to complete critical flight tests before 
production resumes. The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of 
Congress, recently cited serious problems in the 
</P>
<P>
plane's development and early production phases. A final series of flight 
tests, designed to check the B-2's ability to penetrate Soviet air defenses 
without detection, could prove to be the most decisive factor in determining 
whether the B-2 will pass congressional muster. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, even a temporary "pause" in production would hurt defense 
contractors -- and, ultimately, drive the B-2's costs up further. If production 
were halted at 16 aircraft, for instance, the prorated cost of each airplane 
will hover close to $1.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Shelving the B-2 this year would mean the loss of some $5.5 billion in 
appropriations that would benefit Northrop and some 155 other B-2 firms around 
the country. Northrop figures a year's delay will add $4.5 billion to the 
program's costs -- nudging it still closer to extinction. The firm has told 
lawmakers that until it begins building 16 B-2s per year -- a production rate 
that the Air Force hopes to achieve only by 1994 -- it cannot begin to make any 
profit on the B-2 program. 
</P>
<P>
With opposition to the bomber mounting, advocates have charted a new mission 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only element of the strategic triad that can be used in conventional 
conflicts with Third World nations and terrorist adversaries," said Rep. Duncan 
L. Hunter (R-Coronado), one of the B-2's most ardent supporters. 
</P>
<P>
But Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley) scoffs at this. "Once you point out the 
plane doesn't have a strategic mission, they start talking about flying it over 
Libya -- but a $70-billion bomber program to fly over Third World countries is 
lunacy at best," said Dellums, a fiery liberal who has joined with the 
conservative Kasich to try to halt B-2 production. 
</P>
<P>
But to the Air Force, all of the maneuvering and political posturing has 
sidetracked the very serious discussion of the plane's unique mission, which is 
to penetrate overlapping rings of Soviet air defenses and search out and bomb 
hard-to-reach mobile missiles and command posts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sticker-shock reaction and it's awful hard to keep the dialogue on the 
mission and the requirement," conceded Chain, who has emerged as the Air 
Force's chief pitchman for the bomber. "It always comes back to the 
sticker-shock."

SAN QUENTIN'S NEIGHBORS FEAR PROTESTS 
</P>

SAN QUENTIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The small residential community of clapboard houses and condominiums flanks a 
narrow street that dead-ends right at the swinging iron gates of San Quentin 
Prison. 
</P>
<P>
Most residents of San Quentin Village don't mind living in the shadow of the 
prison because it is one of the few spots left in the Bay Area with waterfront 
property at affordable prices. Security at the prison is excellent, residents 
say, and they rarely worry about having 5,000 assorted rapists, murderers and 
burglars as neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
But now, for the first time, they live in fear, in fear of the thousands of 
demonstrators who are expected to descend on the village before next month's 
scheduled execution of Robert Alton Harris. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't mind the prison . . . it's the demonstrators who are going to destroy 
this village," said Pat Orr, president of the San Quentin Village Assn., who 
lives about 100 yards from the prison entrance. "These mobs will be trampling 
our lawns and keeping us awake three or four nights in a row. This little 
street is going to bear the brunt of the whole damn death penalty issue in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
Some Marin County officials say they will soon ask the state to build a gas 
chamber at a state prison in a more remote location. San Quentin is 
particularly ill-suited as the site for the state's only gas chamber, officials 
say, because the prison is next to the village and is less than a mile from 
three other Marin County cities. 
</P>
<P>
With 278 men on death row, county residents fear that the Harris execution will 
usher in a wave of executions. Frequent executions could create chronic 
problems in Marin County and subject the area to much unwanted attention. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants to live in the execution capital of the state," said Ann Cymerys, 
who lives down the street from the prison. "Instead of hot tubs, pretty soon 
the symbol of Marin County is going to be the gas chamber." 
</P>
<P>
Up to 3,000 demonstrators are expected at next month's execution, according to 
Sheriff's Department estimates, and the cost for law enforcement alone will be 
several hundred thousand dollars. Preparing for the Harris execution has been a 
burden on the county; preparing for dozens of others, officials said, would be 
intolerable. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not talking about a few hundred people singing 'We Shall Overcome'. . . 
. Tremendous crowds are expected," said Marin County Supervisor Gary Giacomini. 
"We're simply not going to go through this 278 times in Marin County. . . . If 
we have to file litigation to have the gas chamber moved, we will." 
</P>
<P>
In San Quentin Village, the turn-of-the-century houses, Victorians and a small 
condominium project line Main Street, which is only about half a mile long and 
extremely narrow. The street will be overflowing before the execution, law 
enforcement officials predicted, with demonstrators spilling onto the front 
yards of residents. Giacomini characterized the upcoming demonstration as "a 
disaster in a cul-de-sac." 
</P>
<P>
Ann Cymerys has grown accustomed to living in the shadow of San Quentin. On a 
warm, crystalline day, she stood on the deck of her home, on a bluff above Main 
Street, and enjoyed the sweeping view. The bay lapped against the shore beneath 
her house, and in the distance she could see a blue and white ferry steaming 
toward San Francisco, the graceful arch of the Bay Bridge, and to her right, 
only a few hundred yards away, the pale-yellow granite walls and gun towers of 
San Quentin Prison. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the time the prison is quiet, Cymerys said, and she forgets it's there. 
But she is jolted back to reality when she sees a man, smiling broadly, 
carrying a Manila folder, jauntily walking away from the prison after his 
release; or when she hears the 4 p.m. prison bell for the daily count, or when 
she sees a Sheriff's Department bus filled with prisoners rumbling down Main 
Street toward the front gate. 
</P>
<P>
She felt threatened for the first time about six months ago when the prison 
sounded an alarm, guards searched the shore with guns drawn and helicopters 
with searchlights buzzed the neighborhood. She later discovered that no 
convicts had escaped from the prison, but two burglars mistakenly had broken 
into the prison. They had been caught breaking into cars at the nearby Larkspur 
Ferry parking lot and, attempting to elude police, scaled a fence at a 
minimum-security section of the prison. 
</P>
<P>
"With all the guards and security, I feel safe here," said Cymerys, who lives 
in a renovated Victorian with her husband and small son. "The one thing that 
really concerns all of us is the prospect of having to endure demonstrations 
over and over again. We're not saying we don't want any executions in our back 
yard; we're saying we don't want every execution in our back yard. Why can't 
some of those prisons in more remote areas share some of the burden." 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the village might be disturbed by the demonstrators, but at least 
they won't have to worry about the gas chamber polluting their neighborhood. An 
environmental impact report prepared for San Quentin by a consulting firm 
concluded that the lethal vapors created by cyanide pellets dropped in acid 
wouldn't endanger nearby residents. The report concluded that the gas 
dissipates to a harmless level by the time it is released into the atmosphere 
through a copper stack that rises 18 feet above death row. 
</P>
<P>
As in other communities across the state, residents of the village have varied 
views on capital punishment. Some say Harris deserves to be executed but don't 
think it is equitable that their community bear the brunt of this execution and 
every other execution that follows. 
</P>
<P>
The communities of San Rafael, Larkspur and Corte Madera, which are less than a 
mile from the prison, also are worried about large-scale demonstrations. Some 
city officials say that if the demonstration becomes unruly, highways and 
heavily traveled roads could be closed, creating massive traffic problems. 
Interstate 580, a major commuter route from Marin County to the East Bay, is 
only a mile from the main gate, and a busy city street runs beside the back 
entrance to the prison. 
</P>
<P>
Prison officials set the execution time at 3 a.m. to avoid commuter gridlock, 
but there is concern that demonstrators might linger several hours after the 
execution and disrupt rush-hour traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"If 2,000 people show up, they'll be packed all the way from the main gate to 
580," said Marin County Sheriff's Lt. Bill Donovan. "We hope it doesn't come to 
that, but we have contingency plans set up in case 580 and other roads are 
closed." 
</P>
<P>
Executions at prisons in more remote areas such as Avenal State Prison in the 
San Joaquin Valley or Pelican Bay State Prison in Crescent City would be less 
disruptive, Marin residents say. In 1987, the state Department of Corrections 
discussed holding executions at other sites, but then decided not to make any 
changes, spokeswoman Christine May said. The department didn't want to bear the 
cost of building another gas chamber or relocating Death Row, she said. And 
because the prison is near San Francisco, inmates have easier access to legal 
counsel and the courts than they would in a rural area. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Mitchell, mayor of Sausalito, which is 12 miles from San Quentin, is 
concerned about the psychological impact of frequent executions in Marin 
County. Even though the crowds may diminish after the first execution, Mitchell 
said, the other executions will still attract some demonstrators and coverage 
in the local media. 
</P>
<P>
"Repeated, ongoing executions is not something you want your kids exposed to," 
Mitchell said. "You worry about violence on television desensitizing kids to 
violence. Wholesale executions in your county could have the same effect." 
</P>
<P>
The last execution in the state was in 1967 when Aaron Mitchell, who killed a 
Sacramento policeman, died in San Quentin's gas chamber. The night before, 
about 300 people crowded into San Quentin Village to demonstrate. Ten times 
that amount are expected for next month's execution, according to Sheriff's 
Department estimates. 
</P>
<P>
"The street seemed crowded with protesters -- a real mess -- during the last 
execution. . . . I hate to see what this one's going to be like," said Mignon 
Detmayer, who has lived near the prison's main gate for 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators were "well-behaved" and spent the night before the 10 a.m. 
execution singing and praying during a candlelight vigil, recalled Lt. Donovan, 
who as a young deputy worked crowd control that night. But then American Nazi 
Party chief George Lincoln Rockwell and a few of his followers arrived, 
carrying racist placards. 
</P>
<P>
"A little disturbance broke out, but we got him out of there before it got out 
of control," Donovan said. "Besides the Rockwell thing, it was very peaceful 
and an hour after the execution everyone was gone. But it's a different world 
today. There's more anti-death penalty groups now and they're better organized. 
We're anticipating something much bigger this time."

POLAND'S 'BIG BANG' PLAN SHAKES UP POOR ECONOMY 
</P>

WARSAW 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mikolaj Miszczak, better known to his admirers as Hamburger Mike, has been glum 
lately. He has been stalled, stymied and forced to wait -- a process, if it can 
be called that, that is antithetical to his fast-track nature. For the moment, 
about all he can do is watch the money roll in. It's driving him nuts. 
</P>
<P>
A little over a year ago, Miszczak, a 28-year-old law school dropout, opened 
Warsaw's first private Western-style hamburger joint in a hole-in-the-wall shop 
in a residential neighborhood, using money he had saved working abroad, washing 
dishes and sweeping out restaurants in Sweden and West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
For months, it was a frantic, two-person operation -- he and his wife and lots 
of 18-hour days. Now he runs a second, much larger hamburger emporium at 
Warsaw's airport. 
</P>
<P>
Six weeks ago, he opened a spiffy pizza parlor in downtown Warsaw, an 
enterprise that would not look out of place in Beverly Hills, all done in 
soothing pink, with soft rock on the hi-fi and the best pizza in town -- thin 
crust, thick with cheese -- popping out of his ovens at the rate of 200 a day. 
</P>
<P>
Miszczak now has 28 employees, not counting a bakery that works virtually full 
time supplying him with hamburger buns and a farmer whose sole activity is 
slaughtering beef for his hamburgers. Hamburger Mike, in the words of a friend, 
is a "maszynka do piniedzy" -- a money machine. 
</P>
<P>
But the money, he said, is nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just a game," he explained. "I want to make something. I want to make 
something for Poland, to show the world Poland can be something, something 
good. But now" -- he waved at the outside world, beyond the windows of his 
pizza parlor -- "everything is too slow." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone here would agree with Miszczak that things are moving too slowly. 
But the impatience of this young entrepreneur, who is probably well on his way 
to becoming a millionaire by his 30th birthday, is symbolic of the economic 
change -- and the bottled-up energy -- that has come in the early stages of 
what the government hopes will be a genuine economic revolution in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
The revolution is a long way from being over, and economists are in some 
disagreement about the problems that may lurk down the road. But the Solidarity 
government, led by Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and his chief economic 
architect, Leszek Balcerowicz, has scored a major achievement in curbing 
runaway prices and rallying public support behind its radical "big bang" plan 
to blast the economy out of 40 years of Communist concrete. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 1, Balcerowicz and company brought the hammer down. The national 
currency, the zloty, was devalued and made convertible. State subsidies were 
wiped out on all but a few essential items, taxes were raised, easy credit cut. 
Prices were raised and wages held down. Overnight, Poles learned a hard first 
lesson in market economics. 
</P>
<P>
Now, for the first time in modern memory, supplies of goods actually exceed 
demand. The markets are full of meat. Furniture stores are full of furniture. 
The lines at gasoline pumps have vanished. 
</P>
<P>
Inflation, which was running at a staggering 50% a month in the closing months 
of last year, has been trimmed. In February the rate was 6%, and by the end of 
the year Polish economic managers hope to eliminate it altogether. 
</P>
<P>
The downside of this economic revolution is that the price of everything has 
gone up, in some cases to Western market levels, a distinct shock to consumers. 
One reason the stores are full of merchandise is that goods are no longer 
within reach of every shopper on the street. The real world has begun to 
appear, along with real-world realities such as growing unemployment and a more 
evident gap between the haves and have-nots. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the continuing shock of higher prices, the Polish government finds 
itself strongly backed by a population as determined as officials to weather 
the transition. A recent public opinion poll showed that Mazowiecki had 
surpassed the Polish primate, Cardinal Jozef Glemp, in popularity, a notable 
achievement in heavily Roman Catholic Poland. No Communist leader here ever 
came close. 
</P>
<P>
Communists tried raising prices, too, and were met with universal outrage and 
hostility. Now the standard Polish reaction to prices is a kind of continuing 
surprise -- but the difference is important: The old fury is gone. 
</P>
<P>
"The prices are terrible," said Teresa Wasowska, a Warsaw secretary. "But this 
is the reality." 
</P>
<P>
As do most other Poles, she agrees with the government that there was little 
point in easing the shock by taking a more gradual approach to economic reform. 
</P>
<P>
"Why prolong it?" she said. "Let's get it over with -- if we can -- and go on." 
</P>
<P>
The adjustments, personal and general, are continuing daily, and economists 
warn that it will be some months yet before the program can be judged a 
success. 
</P>
<P>
"They are doing things according to the textbook," one Western economist said, 
"and so far they are getting the textbook response. Inflation has been 
radically contained. On the other hand, there is some evidence of recession as 
a result. Goods are on the shelves not because production is up, but because 
high prices hold down demand." 
</P>
<P>
Government figures show that production fell in January and February, and the 
specter of unemployment concerns some observers. Officially, unemployment is 
about 150,000 out of a work force of 18 million -- only about 0.8% but up 
sharply in just two months. And the World Bank has warned that restructuring of 
Polish industries could lead to unemployment of 1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Helena Goralska, deputy minister of labor, said that so far, the government is 
not worried. 
</P>
<P>
"According to our figures, only about 7,500 of the unemployed have lost their 
jobs because of factory closings or restructurings," she said. "The West is 
more worried about our unemployment than we are." 
</P>
<P>
Some manufacturers of consumer goods have shut down temporarily, sending their 
workers on early holidays for three to six weeks. Some of the plants may be 
forced to extend those holidays even longer. 
</P>
<P>
These fears have brought about a new aggressiveness in merchandising, quickly 
evident in a visit to Warsaw's largest state-run furniture store, where a year 
ago there was almost nothing to buy. Now all three floors are fully stocked. 
Beds, kitchen tables, couches and chairs are marked down as managers do their 
best to keep the goods moving. But as for customers, there are more lookers 
than buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, trucks are backed up to the curbs as factory salespeople, in the chill 
winds of a newly competitive marketplace, try to undercut the goods being sold 
inside. For factory managers, faced with debts they cannot pay and a government 
that is refusing all the once-successful entreaties to bail them out, these are 
extreme measures, fueled by panic. 
</P>
<P>
"Our factory is on 'holiday,' " one of the tailgate sellers said. "We have to 
sell this stuff if we are going to go back to work. We can sell it 15% cheaper 
than you can get it inside." 
</P>
<P>
Why are these goods, so scarce a year ago, now so available? 
</P>
<P>
"Price," a floor manager in the store explained. "A year ago, things were so 
cheap that they were sold before they got to the showroom floor." 
</P>
<P>
It was a pattern that held throughout the economy under the Communist system. 
The state-run economy held prices so low that the goods themselves were, in 
effect, free. Most consumers, however, paid some kind of premium just to get 
their hands on the goods. Often the premium, paid to a "stander" in a store who 
watched for the arrival of a shipment of bedroom furniture, amounted to twice 
the price-tag value. 
</P>
<P>
The whole process, to most consumers, was irritating and time-consuming. In a 
sense, it was a part of the industrial wastage of the Communist system. 
</P>
<P>
"If you wanted to get something, you had to know someone," Magda Weglinska, a 
Warsaw bookkeeper, said. "You had to spend days looking. You had to work all 
the angles." 
</P>
<P>
One notable change, Poles say, is that people no longer absent themselves from 
work for half a day to run errands and go shopping. This is partly because 
goods are more available and partly because jobs are more valuable. 
</P>
<P>
"People realize now that they can get fired if they're not at work," a 
newspaper columnist observed recently. "Employers say that absenteeism has 
dropped and that sick leaves have been sharply reduced." 
</P>
<P>
There is also a visible difference on the streets, a more evident energy and 
enterprise. Even though prices may have quadrupled in the last six months or a 
year, business seems as brisk as it might on any shopping street in a Western 
city. Driven by competition, shopkeepers are dressing up their windows and 
trying out new gimmicks and new products. 
</P>
<P>
"The pace of life has accelerated," said Piotr Kowalski, a recent university 
graduate. "Under communism, time stopped. Now it is as though it were moving at 
the speed of light." 
</P>
<P>
Some Polish economists fear that Poland is speeding into a brick wall. Prof. 
Leszek Zienkowski worries that state-run factories cannot adopt free-market 
rules overnight and that the impact of their accelerating bankruptcies cannot 
be absorbed by privatization, a slow and cumbersome process. 
</P>
<P>
But the government is determined to stay the course. 
</P>
<P>
"We must stick to our program," Marek Dabrowski, undersecretary for finance, 
said in a recent interview. "We must make it clear that we are determined." 
</P>
<P>
A few bankruptcies, he added, could have a salutary effect on the economy. 
</P>
<P>
"We would welcome this in the next weeks, because it would show to the other 
economic enterprises that this is a serious business," Dabrowski said. "This is 
not just a passing idea in economic policy." 
</P>
<P>
Dabrowski has told Poles they are on a road "through purgatory," and 
acknowledges that a recession "might last half a year, but it is also possible 
that it will continue for two or three years." It sounds stern, but Dabrowski 
says he sees no other way. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the heart is not a good adviser in economic policy," he said, 
"especially in such a country as Poland, where during many years ideology and 
wishful thinking prevailed over the economic reality." 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, the Polish government's economic team is at least cautiously 
pleased with its progress. It has had lots of advice along the way, but 
Dabrowski and others hasten to point out that Poland's economic plan was 
conceived and executed by Poles. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard University economist Jeffrey Sachs, a supply-side enthusiast who argues 
for a rapid transformation of the system, was speaking to the converted when he 
met Balcerowicz and his squad of young economic wizards recently. 
</P>
<P>
They rapidly put Sachs to work last fall, using what Dabrowski called "Jeffrey 
Sachs' powers of persuasion and clear thinking" to help persuade a skeptical 
Polish public, economic journalists, the Solidarity brain trust and a worried 
Parliament that "a market economy was the only way out." 
</P>
<P>
"It is not so important now, but then it was very helpful -- and Sachs has been 
a constant promoter of the Polish cause, helping gain the support of Western 
governments and the Western public," Dabrowski said. "But from the beginning, 
our philosophies met." 
</P>
<P>
It is not likely that the failure of a factory employing 1,000 workers will be 
offset by Hamburger Mike's scheme to open a new hamburger palace -- if he could 
just get things moving. On the other hand, perhaps, it's a start. Certainly 
it's in keeping with the new spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Miszczak's plan is to open up smack in the center of Warsaw, in a place now 
occupied by a huge, grim cafeteria operated by Poland's large state-run and 
notoriously inefficient food cooperative, Spolem. The cafeteria, Miszczak 
pointed out as he stalked through the place the other day, has the approximate 
charm of a prison mess hall, and the odors from the kitchen would discourage 
any appetite. Despite its prime location, the operation has lost money for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Miszczak can't get a decision out of City Hall, which owns the building, 
on leasing him the facilities. His petition is bottled up in the bureaucracy, 
which, from his point of view, is as sluggish as the management of any moribund 
state-owned factory. But sooner or later, he figures, he will win. The tide is 
moving with him. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a fantastic place," he said, already envisioning bright lights and 
gleaming chrome and legions of hungry Poles. "A place like this, you could go 
through a ton of French fries a day."

FLORIDA DEA OFFICE GUTTED BY FIREBOMB;

<P>
CRIME: PAST DRUG INDICTMENTS ARE BEING REVIEWED IN A SEARCH FOR SUSPECTS. 
AUTHORITIES SAY THE 'ACT OF DESPERATION' WILL NOT BE A SETBACK.

A federal Drug Enforcement Administration office in Ft. Myers, Fla., was 
destroyed by a firebomb Saturday, and authorities said they were studying 
recent drug-related indictments in an effort to identify suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Shultz, a spokesman at DEA headquarters in Washington, said a pipe bomb 
was thrown through a window of the Ft. Myers field office shortly after 2 a.m., 
gutting the one-story structure. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
The bombing marked the first time a DEA facility has been attacked since the 
federal government stepped up its war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
A car bombing was reported three hours earlier in a residential area 10 miles 
from the DEA office, according to Sheri Peterson of the Lee County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities did not know if the two incidents were related, but a DEA official 
said the first blast could have been "a diversion." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas V. Cash, special agent in charge of the Miami DEA office, flew to Ft. 
Myers to inspect the bombed-out office, located in a shopping mall in the 
resort community northwest of Miami on the Gulf Coast. The agency was the only 
tenant in the building. Damage was estimated at $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
A special team of FBI explosives experts from Washington was sent to the scene 
along with technicians from the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms, according to Allen McCreight, head of the FBI field 
office in Tampa, Fla.. 
</P>
<P>
John Fernandez, a DEA official in Miami, said agents were examining a number of 
possibilities in an effort to determine who carried out the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
ABC News reported that a man indicted last week in a drug case had threatened 
to destroy the office. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be one of many individuals," Fernandez said, noting that the Ft. 
Myers office has developed numerous drug cases. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at the productivity of this office, we've been knocking them dead 
lately," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A drug-related indictment was returned Thursday in Ft. Myers, and two of the 
four defendants are still at large. But federal officials cautioned that they 
were not yet linking that case to the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
DEA agents planned to issue a nationwide alert for suspects and were showing 
mug shots from the drug conspiracy case, NBC News reported. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an act of desperation," Fernandez said. "It they think this is a 
setback for us, it's not. This shows we're on the right track." 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez speculated that the perpetrators might have believed they could 
destroy important DEA evidence or paper work through the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
"But a lot of what you think we would lose, we have duplicate copies of," 
Fernandez said. "We also have a lot of information in computer banks."

STUNNING COMEBACK SEEN FOR PERES; 
</P>
<P>
ISRAEL: THE LABOR PARTY'S UNPOPULAR LEADER EMERGES AS THE PRIME CANDIDATE TO 
FORM A NEW GOVERNMENT. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Shimon Peres is widely believed to be Israel's least popular major politician. 
He has failed to lead his Labor Party to victory in four straight elections, 
and yet, by way of a laborious process that begins today, he stands a good 
chance of becoming the country's next prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
If Peres succeeds, his would be one of the most extraordinary comebacks in 
Israeli political history. A few months ago, Peres was considered to be a 
washed-up, somewhat pompous figure clinging to leadership of the Labor Party 
only until the next elections, when someone else would lead Labor out of the 
wilderness. Now, he is not only poised to rule but eager to take Israel into 
historic peace talks with Palestinian adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
To reach that point, Peres must first be nominated by President Chaim Herzog as 
the candidate most capable of lining up a majority of votes in the Knesset, or 
Parliament, to support a government. Herzog will begin to canvass an array of 
party leaders today to see who enjoys widest support. 
</P>
<P>
If it is Peres, he must then forge a coalition from diverse political forces: 
his own center-left Labor Party, secular and socialist groups that are further 
to the left, religious parties and parties representing Israel's Arab 
population. Most are barely on speaking terms. 
</P>
<P>
He might invite the Likud Party of caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir into 
a renewed role. 
</P>
<P>
The mathematics are simple, even if the process is not: Peres must find parties 
with a total of 22 seats to add to Labor's own 39 and gain a majority in the 
120-member Parliament. Ministries and money will be offered to parties and 
causes in a wide-open marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to be Shimon Peres. He should be able to put together a coalition of 
65 or 66 votes. That's the best bet at this point," said Daniel Ben-Elizar, a 
political analyst in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Peres' chance came with the fall of the 15-month-old coalition government led 
by Shamir, the tottering head of rightist Likud. The government, an uneasy 
Likud-Labor partnership, fell over its inability to act on peace proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Peres served as prime minister from 1984 to 1986 in a rotation agreement with 
Shamir when Labor and Likud first joined in a unity government in the wake of 
the Lebanon war. He won a measure of praise for bringing inflation under 
control, but he also earned a certain image as being evasive and untrustworthy 
-- something of an "Israeli Nixon." 
</P>
<P>
In popularity polls taken since the 1988 general elections, when Labor came in 
second to Likud, Peres has always run far behind not only Shamir but also Labor 
Party rival Yitzhak Rabin, lately the defense minister. 
</P>
<P>
Labor's junior status in the recently fallen coalition had forced Peres, 66, 
off center stage into the role of finance minister. Only frequent trips to 
world capitals and his expressed interest in peace talks reminded the public of 
Peres' larger ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
He used his position in the Finance Ministry to maintain his strength in Labor 
and bolster his cause with religious parties, whose black-clad leaders made 
frequent visits to the Finance Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
Peres funneled money into deteriorating Labor strongholds in industrial unions 
and on communal kibbutz farms. For the religious, he provided funds for 
education -- including a $50-million aid supplement approved just last month 
and a $2.5-million check signed just before Shamir fell. 
</P>
<P>
"The finance minister has been preparing well for setting up the next 
government," a Foreign Ministry official commented dryly. 
</P>
<P>
For the past several weeks, Peres carried on openly secret negotiations with 
religious party leaders to try to persuade them to join a Labor government if 
Shamir fell. To the Sephardic Shas party, which controls six seats, he offered 
movement on peace talks, a growing concern in the religious group. 
</P>
<P>
At least one other religious party, Agudat Israel, has shown interest in a 
Peres government, more out of spite than conviction. Agudat is angry at Shamir 
for having reneged on an agreement to let Orthodox Jewish rabbis set standards 
for determining an individual's Jewishness. Shamir dropped the pledge when, 
having enticed Labor to join the government that recently collapsed, he no 
longer needed Agudat's help to form a coalition.

IRAQIS PROTEST BRITISH REACTION TO 'SPY' HANGING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Iraqi protesters marched in the capital and other cities 
Saturday to express anger at the British measures taken to censure Iraq for 
hanging a London-based journalist accused of spying. 
</P>
<P>
Also Saturday, President Saddam Hussein flew to Saudi Arabia for consultations 
with King Fahd. The official Saudi Press Agency said Fahd invited Hussein after 
the international uproar over the execution of Farzad Bazoft. The 31-year-old 
Iranian-born journalist worked for the Observer, a British newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
No details of their talks were released. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators swept through the streets of all major Iraqi cities chanting 
support for Hussein's decision, state-run Baghdad Radio said. Bazoft was hanged 
Thursday, four days after a closed-door revolutionary security court sentenced 
him to death. He denied the charges of spying for Israel and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
After the execution, Britain withdrew its ambassador, expelled six Iraqi 
military students and canceled all ministerial visits. But it resisted demands 
to break off relations and impose economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the ruling Arab Baath Socialist Party estimated that 100,000 
people turned out in Baghdad. No violence was reported. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators sent a cable to Hussein urging him to take a tougher position 
against Britain. 
</P>
<P>
"Chop off the heads of all spies and silence their dirty tongues," said the 
cable, broadcast on the state-run radio. 
</P>
<P>
Radio reports also said the protesters handed a letter of protest to the 
British Embassy press officer expressing outrage over London's denunciation of 
the execution. 
</P>
<P>
The embassy was ringed by police officers and plainclothes security agents. No 
embassy personnel were seen in the compound. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi newspapers focused on Bazoft's criminal record in Britain. He served a 
year in prison in 1981-82 for robbing a savings and loan office of $764 while 
he was a student living in central England. 
</P>
<P>
Bazoft was arrested in September along with British nurse Daphne Parish while 
he was investigating reports of a major explosion at a secret Iraqi military 
research complex south of Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Parish was sentenced to 15 years in prison.

About 25,000 Lithuanians rallied next to the Parliament building here Saturday 
in a nationalist demonstration intended to show the Kremlin that this republic 
will not be pressured into backing down on its declaration of independence. 
</P>
<P>
"The goal of our work has been so our children can live in a free and clean 
Lithuania. We have interrupted our work to come to you, to rejoice with you 
that our work is proceeding well," President Vytautas Landsbergis told the 
crowd, which began to chant, "Thank you, thank you," in Lithuanian. 
</P>
<P>
"Let all of Lithuania support us, even if they have to rise to the defense of 
Lithuania," Landsbergis added, speaking from the steps of the library in this 
capital city of 500,000. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, some standing on rooftops or balconies overlooking the 
Square of the Soviets where the rally was held, sang Lithuanian nationalist 
songs and hoisted signs like one held by a 4-year-old girl: "I'm Going Toward a 
Free Lithuania." 
</P>
<P>
Also Saturday, the Lithuanian Parliament decided to send a delegation of seven 
deputies to Moscow on Monday. The delegation, headed by Lithuanian lawmaker 
Vydutis Antonaitis, who also is a member of the Congress of People's Deputies, 
hopes to hold talks with Soviet leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Landsbergis nor any of the other speakers at the rally mentioned a 
telegram received late Friday from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev giving the 
republic three days to respond to a resolution of the Congress that invalidated 
Lithuania's declaration of independence. 
</P>
<P>
But there appeared to be no question of retreating among those gathered here on 
a balmy afternoon in the Square of the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not afraid," said Vladas Sceponas, a 45-year-old wrestling trainer. "We 
are ready to work. Our workers are diligent. We have an army of intellectuals 
that can solve any problem, and the economy is a mess now anyway; it can't get 
any worse in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Small nationalist rallies also were reported in the other Baltic republics -- 
Latvia and Estonia -- where elections are scheduled today for each republic's 
parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, Lithuania, which was forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union 
in 1940 along with Latvia and Estonia, became the first republic in the country 
to adopt a resolution declaring its sovereignty and holding that the Soviet 
constitution is no longer applicable on Lithuanian soil. 
</P>
<P>
In sessions last week, Lithuanian lawmakers took initial steps to clarify how 
they hope to achieve independence, ruling for instance that all ports and 
factories must report to Lithuanian ministries instead of to Moscow and that 
all Red Army recruiting offices in the republic must be closed. 
</P>
<P>
Landsbergis, commenting to the Lithuanian Parliament on Gorbachev's telegram, 
said it "sounds very much like pressure is being applied to us." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he added, the words could be interpreted as a signal that 
Gorbachev, who said he wants to have a respectful dialogue with Lithuania, is 
ready for the dialogue to begin. 
</P>
<P>
Landsbergis also rejected an earlier Gorbachev proposal that the republic hold 
a referendum on the independence issue. He said that to do so would be "a 
political mistake, as if we were admitting that the will of the people had not 
yet been expressed." Besides, he added, "we have other things to do." 
</P>
<P>
Landsbergis concluded: "It can only be remarked that it (the telegram) was sent 
to the wrong address because we are no longer the Supreme Soviet of the 
Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic." 
</P>
<P>
Also in Saturday's parliamentary session, the former Communist Party boss of 
Lithuania, Algirdas Brazauskas, was elected deputy prime minister under Prime 
Minister Kazimira Prunskiene. Brazauskas had initially turned down an offer to 
be Landsbergis' deputy.

MANDELA PLEDGES ANC ACTION ON UNREST IN TOWNSHIPS 
</P>

Nelson R. Mandela, facing pressure to end the growing black unrest in South 
Africa's townships, returned home Saturday after a three-week foreign journey 
and promised that his organization would devise a strategy to deal with the 
problem and "go into action" soon. 
</P>
<P>
But Mandela, 71-year-old deputy president of the African National Congress, 
blamed the government for the escalating unrest, which has broken out 
sporadically over a variety of issues and claimed 300 lives in the past month 
in nominally independent ethnic homelands as well as in South African urban 
townships. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who are worried about violence must talk to the government (and urge it) 
to create conditions where peaceful forms of agitation are possible," Mandela, 
flanked by his wife, Winnie, and colleague, Walter Sisulu, told a news 
conference. He added that the trouble "indicates the rejection by the masses of 
the people" of the government's policy of apartheid and its system of so-called 
independent homelands for blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Since Mandela left the country Feb. 27 for a trip to Zambia, Zimbabwe, 
Tanzania, Ethiopia and Sweden, the autocratic leader of the Ciskei homeland has 
been toppled by a popular military coup that prompted celebrations and two days 
of rioting. A few days later, rioting in the homeland of Bophuthatswana erupted 
during a march calling for the territory to be reintegrated into South Africa 
in time for Bophuthatswanans to participate in the talks for a new South 
African constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Violence also has rocked black townships near Johannesburg. Warring black taxi 
drivers in Katlehong have caused thousands to flee that township, and three 
people died Thursday night when rumors swept the township of Sebokeng that 
armed black attackers were poised to invade. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who was appointed deputy president of the ANC during his stop in 
Zambia, returned to South Africa from Sweden, where he spent a week thanking 
the Stockholm government, the ANC's most generous overseas supporter, and 
meeting with ailing ANC President Oliver R. Tambo. He was escorted from his 
airport news conference here to a daylong concert by South African artists held 
in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
This week, Mandela is scheduled to attend independence celebrations in Namibia, 
which formally ends 75 years of South African colonial rule Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
During the week, Secretary of State James A. Baker III is scheduled to meet 
Mandela in Namibia and then call on South Africa President Frederik W. de Klerk 
in Cape Town. Mandela acknowledged that the ANC had tried to discourage Baker 
from visiting South Africa and that Mandela had refused to see him here. 
</P>
<P>
"If the secretary of state wants to see me, of course I'll see him," Mandela 
said Saturday. "But I will not see him in South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
"A high-profile visit" to South Africa "can result in a lot of confusion," 
Mandela said. "It would suggest that President De Klerk has done something 
positive, something fundamental that requires the world to review sanctions." 
The ANC has welcomed De Klerk's initiatives but says they fall short of 
creating a climate for negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela also said Saturday that the ANC has chosen him to lead its delegation 
for the first official meetings with De Klerk and his white minority-led 
government in Cape Town on April 11. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to discuss what might be on the agenda. But he reiterated the ANC's 
position that its preconditions for negotiation -- amnesty for returning 
exiles, release of political prisoners and ending the state of emergency -- 
"are the minimum conditions" for ANC participation in government-sponsored 
talks on a new constitution that would give the black majority a vote in 
national affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The escalating unrest has complicated those talks by giving the government a 
reason to retain its powers to quell violence under the state of emergency. 
That violence, in which a white motorist was killed Thursday night near 
Sebokeng township, also has hampered the ANC's attempts to reassure whites that 
a black majority government would be orderly and fair.

Running down Talcott Street in this Chicago suburb the other day, a female 
jogger paused just long enough to flash an obscene gesture as she passed the 
reelection headquarters of Republican State Rep. Penny Pullen. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, not far away, a group of about 50 demonstrators were singing 
Pullen's praises as they held their weekly vigil outside a hospital that 
performs abortions. 
</P>
<P>
"Of all the candidates I've ever known, she's the one glowing light who hasn't 
run from the issue," said swimwear salesman Jim Finnegan, cradling in his arms 
a full-color poster depicting a human fetus alongside a red rose. 
</P>
<P>
Pullen, the Illinois Legislature's most vocal abortion foe, fires the passions 
of partisans on both sides of the controversial issue like few others in this 
state. Opponents of abortion see her as an unwavering hero in their crusade to 
ban a procedure they consider repugnant. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion rights advocates view her as nothing less than a moralizing 
Neanderthal and have staked Rosemary Mulligan, Pullen's Republican challenger 
in Tuesday's Illinois primary, to thousands of dollars worth of cash and 
campaign assistance. 
</P>
<P>
It is a scenario likely to be played over and over this year as the firestorm 
unleashed by a 1989 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that weakened abortion rights 
ripples through legislative halls and into the polling booths. 
</P>
<P>
The Pullen-Mulligan contest is just the first in a growing list of local, state 
and federal electoral battles across the nation in the 1990 campaign season 
that could turn on the explosive issue of abortion. Activists on both sides are 
targeting key races for special attention. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington-based National Abortion Rights Action League tossed down the 
gauntlet months ago when it publicly unveiled a roster of prominent political 
figures whose grasp on power was either shaky or whose demise, the group 
claimed, could cripple the anti-abortion movement. 
</P>
<P>
The NARAL hit list ranges from Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) to Florida's 
Republican Gov. Bob Martinez to Curt Pringle, a staunch abortion foe from 
Garden Grove elected to his Orange County Assembly seat by a razor-thin margin 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Our major focuses in 1990 are the election battles across the country," said 
Kate Michelman, NARAL's executive director. "We must solidify the strength of 
the pro-choice constituency and prove that politicians are going to be held 
accountable. They can no longer duck the issue." 
</P>
<P>
Abortion rights forces claimed some early victories last year, tossing hundreds 
of thousands of dollars the way of sympathetic candidates who won off-year 
governor's races in New Jersey and Virginia as well as a pair of highly 
publicized contests to fill state legislative vacancies in the San Diego area. 
</P>
<P>
And under the gun of impending campaigns, some high-profile office seekers 
softened or reversed long-held anti-abortion positions. Among them, Neil 
Hartigan, the likely Democratic nominee in the Illinois governor's race and 
Anthony J. Celebrezze, the top Democratic contender for the same job in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion opponents insist the hemorrhaging is beginning to stop as politicians 
who flip-flop take more and more flak for their lack of resolve. "I think they 
(abortion rights forces) succeeded in sucker-punching some candidates through 
making noise, but I think that's pretty much run its course," said David 
O'Steen, executive director of the National Right to Life Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders on both sides of the issue agree that the majority of voters in most 
races are not going to cast ballots solely because of abortion. But each side 
can boast dedicated cadres of activists who could make the difference in close 
contests. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere are the stakes higher than in races that could tip the balance of power 
or send strong warning signals to state lawmakers, who were given broad new 
powers to regulate abortions by last year's Supreme Court ruling. The decision 
sparked a flood of restrictive legislative proposals across the nation. But, 
with an eye on the election calendar, lawmakers in most states have so far 
shied from dealing with most of the bills. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion rights strategists think the defeat of a handful of outspoken abortion 
foes this year could scare cautious politicians out of backing restrictive 
bills in the future. On the other hand, the failure of such efforts could push 
fence-straddlers into the anti-abortion camp. 
</P>
<P>
One key battleground is sure to be Pennsylvania, the only state since the 
Supreme Court decision to enact new legal controls to discourage abortion. A 
federal judge has at least temporarily blocked enforcement of the law, which 
among other things would require women to inform their spouses before aborting 
a pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of abortion rights say they are putting together a $1-million war 
chest to use against at least seven influential anti-abortion political 
candidates including Gov. Robert P. Casey, a Democrat. Chief among those 
targeted is State Rep. Stephen Freind, a Republican from the Philadelphia 
suburbs who was the legislative architect of the abortion control bill. 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Fisher, the 32-year-old political newcomer who is challenging Freind in 
the May 15 Republican primary, said Freind's preoccupation with outlawing 
abortion shortchanged his constituents and violated traditional GOP dogma "to 
get government out of our lives." 
</P>
<P>
"This community deserves to talk about a lot more than abortion issues," Fisher 
said. " . . . Abortion is a major issue in this community mostly because he's 
made it one." 
</P>
<P>
Denise Neary, director of development for the Pennsylvania Pro-Life Federation, 
predicted that heavy spending by abortion rights groups could create a 
backlash. "The question is can they buy an election?" Neary asked rhetorically. 
"I think that could have an adverse effect. I think there will be people who 
will be turned off by that." 
</P>
<P>
Abortion opponents would rely more on volunteer efforts to help their 
candidates and planned to spend far less than the other side, Neary said. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Illinois, the next state to hold a major primary this year, abortion 
also has become an important factor in several legislative races. Thanks to 
Pullen's notoriety, however, most of the public attention has focused on her 
battle with Mulligan, a 48-year-old paralegal who has never run for public 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Both Pullen, 43, a 14-year veteran of the Illinois House, and Mulligan insist 
they are not one-issue candidates and agree that abortion takes a back seat in 
the minds of most voters in the heavily Republican 55th legislative district to 
more pressing local problems such as soaring property taxes, flood protection 
and excessive noise from nearby O'Hare airport. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Pullen's campaign literature barely mentions her role as the 
legislative leader in the fight to stop abortion. "She realizes the issue is a 
loser and she's trying to low-key it," Mulligan charges. 
</P>
<P>
Pullen, on the other hand, says she's not trying to run from her reputation but 
rather emphasize the broad range of her legislative interests. "I'm not running 
for national office, I'm running for state representative in this district," 
she explained. " . . . I'm into a lot more than many legislators. . . . I don't 
think a single issue candidate can sell anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Disclaimers aside, abortion is never very far from the surface. Pullen hasn't 
had a primary challenge in 10 years. Part of the House minority leadership 
team, Pullen has raised more than $100,000 in contributions from a wide variety 
of business and individual sources. But many of the largest contributions have 
come from conservative groups and people closely associated with anti-abortion 
causes. 
</P>
<P>
And if it weren't for support from abortion rights forces, Mulligan wouldn't 
have much of a campaign at all. As of last week, Personal PAC, a political 
action committee backing Illinois candidates who support abortion rights, had 
bankrolled more than $25,000 worth of campaign services for Mulligan, a figure 
representing more than half of all her campaign expenditures.

MARYLAND TRIES TO END ABORTION BILL FILIBUSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
ANNAPOLIS, Md. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Senate leaders held hourly quorum calls Saturday in an effort to break a 
filibuster against legislation that would guarantee abortions remain widely 
available in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
By requiring the entire 47-member Senate to check in each hour beginning at 
noon for a quorum call, Senate President Thomas V. (Mike) Miller turned what 
one senator had called a "limousine filibuster" into a far more uncomfortable 
experience for lawmakers on both sides of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Senate's minority of anti-abortion members began "extended debate" 
Thursday in an effort to weaken or kill the abortion bill, the leadership had 
spread out required appearances in the Senate chamber and allowed senators to 
leave the Statehouse to sleep or take care of other business. 
</P>
<P>
The hourly quorum calls Saturday forced senators to loiter near the chamber, 
raising the pressure for a settlement allowing the senators to go home. 
</P>
<P>
It would require 32 votes, or two-thirds of the Senate membership, to invoke 
cloture, end the debate and allow passage of the bill on majority vote. 
Abortion rights senators had 29 votes by Saturday, but acknowledged the next 
three would be the hardest to get. 
</P>
<P>
The debate, which had recessed early Saturday after an all-evening session 
Friday, resumed Saturday morning and the first quorum call was held at noon. 
</P>
<P>
"The longer it goes on, the more likely something will happen," said Sen. 
Howard Denis, a Republican from suburban Washington who was among the senators 
switching sides and voting to end debate. "There's a lot of psychological 
forces at work."

KOREAN TABANG COMES TO L.A. WITH A CURE FOR THE HOMESICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN H. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At least once a week, Han Oak Soon and her friend, Lee Kyung Jun, catch buses 
on opposite sides of the city and meet in a little tabang tucked away on the 
second-story of a Koreatown mini-mall. 
</P>
<P>
Seated at low-slung tables in the Korean-style tearoom, Han has coffee, Lee 
takes milk, and they drink in the atmosphere of home. 
</P>
<P>
"We chat about family and old school friends and hometowns and food and, well, 
Korea," 80-year-old Han, who immigrated in 1980, said in Korean. "You see, at 
our age, we have a lot of memories." 
</P>
<P>
The two grandmothers come to Olympic Tabang on Olympic Boulevard to relax and 
talk about how life in the United States stacks up to the lives they left back 
in Korea. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles is so big," Han said. "But meet a friend in a tabang and suddenly 
being away from home isn't as unsettling." 
</P>
<P>
In some neighborhoods in Seoul, where Han and Lee are from, hundreds of tabangs 
can be crowded into 10 small city blocks. There, locals linger behind coffee 
cups and talk for hours. "Everywhere you turn in Korea, they are there," said 
Su Cha An, owner of Olympic Tabang. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are more than 300,000 Korean Americans in Los Angeles, Olympic 
is one of only two tabangs here. An said that reflects the all-business 
attitude of many Koreans who arrive in Los Angeles with hopes of bettering 
themselves financially. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people here are in business for themselves," she said. "When they come to 
the tabang, who will watch their shops? In Korea, restaurants serve you meals, 
afterward you go to the tabang for a cup of coffee and to talk. Here, people 
who want to drink coffee order it at the restaurants." 
</P>
<P>
Though they serve beverages and snacks at tabangs here and in Korea, the 
commodity for sale is really the pooneeggi, or ambience. In Los Angeles, 
however, tabang decor has a decidedly Western twist. 
</P>
<P>
At Ye Wang Bong, Koreatown's first tabang, the windows are hung with pale 
orange curtains and translucent drapes. Paper bees are suspended from the 
ceiling (Ye Wang Bong means queen bee). But at the end of the counter, a 
traditional ink painting of Korea's mythical white horse is partially obscured 
by a four-foot-tall inflatable bottle of Miller Genuine Draft. 
</P>
<P>
To compete with nearby restaurants, food has been added to a menu that in Korea 
would be limited to high-priced beverages, said owner Young Yun Choi. "Here, 
you can't make a living serving an expensive cup of coffee," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the adaptations to Los Angeles, regulars say their visits to a 
tabang provide a brief escape to a kinder, idealized Korean life. 
</P>
<P>
At Ye Wang Bong, cigarette smoke casts a misty blanket over the room. The quiet 
swishing of the 300-gallon fish tank is soothing. 
</P>
<P>
Then, suddenly, the reality of life in Los Angeles intrudes. 
</P>
<P>
At one table, a man is overhead talking about the need to earn more money. 
Somewhere in the room, a muffled pager sounds. A man reluctantly reaches for 
his belt and stops the beeping. A few seconds later, he pays the check and 
leaves. 
</P>
<P>
"Even when friends get together, they talk about business," Duk Sung Kang, a 
marketing manager for Los Angeles-based Radio Korea, said as he slurped a 
microwaved bowl of sweet red bean gruel. He was reading a Korean paperback book 
titled "Professional Salesmanship -- How to Increase Your Selling Power." 
</P>
<P>
"It's very popular . . . among salesmen," Kang said, as he showed the book to a 
companion. Like a high school senior cramming for the college entrance exams in 
Korea, Kang resumed reading, stopping occasionally to rub his forehead, 
underline a passage, or make notes in the margins of the book. 
</P>
<P>
Another group animatedly discussed the finer points of speeding up the 
application process for a liquor license. 
</P>
<P>
"How do I go about doing this better?" asked one man. "I don't know what route 
to take. I have to find someone who knows what's what." 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 opening of Ye Wang Bong Tabang in Hobart Plaza on 8th Street was a 
small milestone in the community, said Kyong Ja Kim, owner of In That Empty 
Space, a late-night cafe on 6th Street and Kenmore Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"The feeling I had when a tabang opened was, 'We now have a tabang. If this 
doesn't mean we are here to stay, I don't know what does,' " Kim said. Three 
years later, tabang-like restaurants that cater to younger people are beginning 
to proliferate, said Douglas Jee, 25, an electronics salesman who is planning 
to open his own establishment in Koreatown. But there, customers will not be 
encouraged to linger and the atmosphere will be decidedly contemporary. "An 
L.A. style tabang," Jee explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Chul Nan Jung, owner of Nandarang Cafe, on 6th Street near Serrano Avenue, 
said the tabang has become a refuge in a city that sometimes seems hostile or 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
"For some Koreans, no matter how long they stay here, certain parts of American 
society will never be open," said Jung, who came to the United States 15 years 
ago. "Sometimes it's language problems, but more importantly is because of the 
differences in life style. That's why we need the tabang and cafes." 
</P>
<P>
Back at Ye Wang Bong, a man trying to place a call on a pay phone struggled to 
make himself understood through his heavily accented English. 
</P>
<P>
He asked first for a Mr. Yang. "Oh . . . then, Mr. Kim?" he continued, 
stumbling a bit. "Oh. . . . This is Mr. Park. I am trying to . . . no, it's 
Park." In Korean, Park is pronounced more like "Bak." He was asked to spell the 
name. 
</P>
<P>
That frustrating experience over, Park shuffled back to his table, took a 
perfunctory sip of coffee and sighed. In the background, a wistful song was 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
The song, "In a Place So Far Away," is a familiar tune on the airwaves in 
Seoul.

ROOMMATES' DISPUTE ENDS IN 2 DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Norwalk men were slain and a third was wounded when a dispute among four 
roommates who lived in a garage erupted in gunfire early Saturday, sheriff's 
deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said they were seeking Angel Velasquez, 33, for questioning in 
connection with the 12:40 a.m. shootings. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred in a converted garage behind a Barnwall Street house. One 
of the slain men was shot in the head and the other was shot in the upper 
torso, said Sheriff's Lt. Dale Goss. The men's identities were being withheld 
pending notification of next of kin. 
</P>
<P>
The unidentified wounded man went to the door of the front house and the 
landlord called for help. The man was listed in critical condition at UC Irvine 
Medical Center in Orange County.

WORKER AT SHELL OIL'S CARSON SUBSTATION IS ELECTROCUTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An employee of an electrical contractor working on a substation at the Shell 
Oil refinery in Carson was electrocuted when he came in contact with a live 
circuit Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Grant, 31, collapsed about 12:40 p.m. while working on a substation panel 
that carries 15,000 volts, said Deputy Dean Scoville. 
</P>
<P>
Before losing consciousness. Grant, a Colorado resident, told colleagues at the 
Wilmington Avenue facility that he had received a shock. 
</P>
<P>
Workers began trying to revive him with cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and 
county paramedics were called to the scene. Grant was taken to Harbor General 
Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 1:31 p.m. of cardiac arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide detectives were assigned to investigate the incident, but "initial 
indications are that it looks to be an accident," Scoville said. 
</P>
<P>
Grant was part of a team from Asea Brown Boveri, a Philadelphia-based 
electrical contractor hired by Shell to conduct tests on the substation. The 
facility has been out of service for routine maintenance since March 3, said 
Shell spokesman Gene Munger. 
</P>
<P>
Although the substation supplies energy to the refinery's alkylation unit, 
where a flash fire on Thursday caused minor injuries to two workers, Munger 
said the two accidents were not related. 
</P>
<P>
"The circuits were being energized selectively with test equipment at the time 
of the incident," Munger said. "He obviously came in contact with something 
somehow with very, very unfortunate results."

INS AGENTS ARREST 38 ILLEGAL ALIEN SUSPECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. immigration agents, making what they described as a routine sweep of Los 
Angeles International Airport, apprehended 38 suspected illegal aliens bound 
for cities in the Eastern United States, authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-four of those arrested Friday night at the airport were from Mexico, 
according to officials of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. The 
remaining four suspects were from El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests came after a two-day crackdown on alien smuggling that detained 153 
suspected illegal immigrants and two alleged smugglers.

NO BOZO JAM ON MONDAYS AT THE WHISKY GIVES NEWCOMERS A SHOT AT STARDOM

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"And now from New York . . . Hazel," says master of ceremonies Sam Mann at the 
Whisky on the Sunset Strip as a band mopes on stage, fluffy long hair and 
stickers from the Brooklyn heavy-metal club L'Amour on their guitar cases. 
</P>
<P>
"Dude, they've changed their name to Jewel," someone shouts up to Mann. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh," the emcee says into the microphone. "Then I guess this is . . . Jewel." 
</P>
<P>
The band starts to play in a way that suggests somebody had flicked on a 
switch. Waist-length hair whips about, pointy shoes kick at the air and leaping 
musicians plummet from the drum riser. 
</P>
<P>
A bare-chested guitarist, his back arced to meet that of the singer, fingers a 
cascading swirl of notes, only some of which are in the wrong key. The bass 
player dashes across the stage at a full run, stopping just before he careens 
onto the empty dance floor below. Then as suddenly as they start, they stop. 
There is polite applause. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you," the singer says. "We haven't played out in a while, but we're 
ready to get rockin' now. Rockin'." 
</P>
<P>
The band begins another two-chord strut, tuneless, but tight and clean and 
full, and then a full-on, lighters-in-the-air anthem. They think they're 
playing the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
These days, when even second- and third-rate bands can go triple platinum, a 
life in rock 'n' roll can seem more like a responsible career decision than 
like a life of penniless debauchery. 
</P>
<P>
That's why the Whisky's No Bozo Jam -- a Monday night tradition since 1988 -- 
sometimes resembles nothing so much as an extremely loud job interview. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of business suits, the aspirants wear black vests and tights, instead 
of power ties, gauzy scarfs. They all use the same Whisky-provided amps and 
drums, which are on the good side of adequate: Marshall stacks for the 
guitarists and scads of Zildjian cymbals for the drummers. 
</P>
<P>
They all get paid in free Budweiser and Rainbow pizza -- and pay two bucks per 
band member to get into the club. (Compared to the several hundred bucks they'd 
have to shell out for a pay-to-play weekend gig here, it's cheap.) 
</P>
<P>
For rock fans, No Bozo Jam offers the chance to see 15 bands every Monday for 
$3; user-friendly sets of three or four songs each. Every hot new L.A. band 
swings through here at least once. Chart-toppers Warrant played No Bozo in the 
band's early days -- so did Bang Tango, Kingdom Come and the Zeros. There's a 
chance hard-rock heroes will stop in when they're in town: Ozzy Osbourne's 
guitarist Zakk Wylde did a spontaneous 90-minute jam here six months ago that 
still has Whisky regulars shaking their heads in amazement. 
</P>
<P>
No Bozo also seems tailor-made for record companies' street scouts, whose job 
it is to hear everything. Columbia's West Coast A&amp;R VP Ron Oberman 
explains: "There's good energy in the room, which can be sparse in a showcase. 
The times I've been, there's generally been something worthwhile -- maybe not 
to sign, but entertaining. And if I hear about something, the Whisky is a good 
place to go." 
</P>
<P>
Oberman signed Love/Hate, a hot underground band he hopes will make you forget 
Guns N' Roses, after a No Bozo night. Label executives from Warner Bros. 
chairman Mo Ostin to MCA metal czar Bret Hartman have been through, looking for 
rock's next big thing. 
</P>
<P>
The band after Jewel on this night, Dirt Merchants, has the sort of mod-cat 
look and untuned Stonesy blues sound you associate with sexploitation flicks 
filmed at the Whisky during the Summer of Love; Rude Awakening, the one after 
that, goes from a chromatic Black Sabbath guitar moan to the unmistakable 
chunk-a-chunk-a-chunk-a of speed-metal; Bark in the Dark sounds as if they've 
been listening to too many Night Ranger records. 
</P>
<P>
The surprise isn't that these bands are a little boring -- they are -- but that 
they're every bit as polished and presentable as most of the hard-rockers you 
pay $17.50 to see at the Palace. You can see each of them as somebody's 
favorite band; exemplary of their type. The club is suddenly packed, more 
crowded than you've ever seen it. And there are still something like 10 job 
applicants to go. 
</P>
<P>
Upstairs, Stevie, who drums for the Wanted, is eager to tell a reporter about 
his band. 
</P>

"Hey, we got a real good slot: 10:45. I'm from Cleveland -- you know that 
Cleveland thing, whew! -- so you know I wouldn't be here if these guys weren't 
great. How would I describe our sound? Commercial. Straight-ahead hard rock. . 
. . Not like Guns N' Roses, but we're solid." 
</P>
<P>
The Wanted play their set: Stevie was right on the money. Master of ceremonies 
Mann explains the appeal of No Bozo Night to the crowd: "If you've never been 
here before, Monday nights are a very special time here at the Whisky a Go Go. 
It gets crowded, there's a lot of bands, you have the opportunity to go home 
with someone you've never met before . . . a great deal for three bucks." 
</P>
<P>
Cherri, 19, from Hollywood, agrees: "I can't afford to go to clubs any other 
night. And usually if you hate a band, they're done before you can really get 
mad at them." 
</P>
<P>
The bands are booked by Vikki MacKenzie, a former Rainbow waitress with a firm 
set of rules: "If bands go over their time-slots, break equipment on purpose or 
start fights, they're not invited back. Our neighbors hate the punk-rock and 
speed-metal crowds, so none of those bands. Not too much of the real 
heavy-metal stuff either, though I don't really censor out the garage-y tapes. 
</P>
<P>
"The bands between 8:30 and 10:20 usually haven't played out much -- no regular 
here will show up until 10:30 -- so they're basically playing to show the staff 
that they're willing to work with us. I usually book about 10 weeks ahead. I'm 
usually able to book between five and six real headliners: They're the ones 
with the names on the marquee. And no pyro." 
</P>
<P>
"Remember," Mann says from the stage, "you can do anything you want as long as 
you do what we want." 
</P>
<P>
Current regular headliners include the Mimes, a horn-driven blues band who are 
a big draw on the Strip; Imagine World Peace, sort of a lipstick-era GN'R with 
a tribal-drum inflection; Mecca, droning rockers who sound like they listen to 
a lot of Killing Joke; Young Gunns, who play a brand of generic KNAC hard rock; 
Stikkitty, Journey-esque; and Sam Mann &amp; the Apes, the emcee's band. It 
wouldn't be unusual to see all of these on one bill here. 
</P>
<P>
One No Bozo night featured a band -- "From New Jersey . . . Belgium" -- a White 
Lion-type ensemble whose singer had the crotch ripped out of his jeans as if a 
large dog had grabbed him the wrong way. "I'd like to dedicate this next song 
to the band," he said, " 'cause we've been together for five years, and we 
ain't goin' nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
The same night, Clyde, a young, white-noise funk band in the mode of the Red 
Hot Chili Peppers, demonstrated a No Bozo faux pas: they brought their own 
smoke machine to the showcase and accidentally filled the entire club with a 
dense chemical fog. 
</P>
<P>
But the scene tonight is more likely to remind you of "The Idolmaker" than 
"Spinal Tap." 
</P>
<P>
Midnight Express, scarfed and ready, would probably be immensely popular if 
there weren't already a Faster Pussycat; White Boy Stomp has a tough AC/DC 
groove and a singer with a great Bon Scott edge, the most appealing band of the 
night. Friction Addiction is accomplished enough to be totally banal, as if 
they were afflicted with second-album syndrome before their fame had spread 
much beyond readers of the Rock City News. Cyanide Kick, dressed head to toe in 
Lip Service gear, attempts the Motley ingenue thing, and gets nearly up to a 
Poison level. Lost Angels and Young Gunns and Mecca play. 
</P>
<P>
And during the last couple of sets, Guns N' Roses bassist Duff McKagan sits 
grinning on the stairs below the dressing room, hoping that somebody will 
invite him to jam. The show finishes early, McKagan and his friends leap onto 
the stage and none of the 50 or so musicians in the house will lend him their 
equipment. Welcome to the jungle, indeed.

PARAMOUNT'S BIG SPIN; 
</P>
<P>
A LOOK INSIDE THE CHANGING STUDIO, THE PEOPLE WHO RUN IT AND THE 1990 
HIGH-PROFILE, BIG-MONEY MOVIE STRATEGY

<P>
Paramount Pictures, the studio's executives never tire of telling you, is 
really a family. But so were the Corleones. And, as fans of Paramount's 
proudest property and signature movie, "The Godfather," will recall, that 
didn't stop things from getting a bit tense between the film's Don Michael and 
his errant brother, Fredo, at times. 
</P>
<P>
In the Paramount clan, fortunately, no one gets shot. But the feuds can leave 
scars. 
</P>
<P>
Sometime in the hazy past, producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson -- 
charter members of the family, bound to the studio by an exclusive contract -- 
decided they wanted to make a movie called "Top Gun" with Tom Cruise, a hot 
young star who had gotten less than $150,000 for "Risky Business" at Warner 
Bros. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount wanted to pay Cruise $575,000, but he wanted about twice that, and 
the producers offered him $1 million, according to one source. Studio 
executives fumed, then paid, and eventually got a huge hit. 
</P>
<P>
But things didn't get easier. Even before the "Top Gun" box-office tally was 
in, Cruise told Paramount's then-film president, Ned Tanen, that he wanted to 
make a movie about race cars. Tanen -- like Cruise, a car buff -- signed the 
actor to produce and star in the picture and got a script rolling. 
</P>
<P>
Cruise, meanwhile, racked up back-to-back hits -- Disney/Touchstone's 
"Cocktail" and MGM/UA's "Rain Man" -- and suddenly wanted a lot more money for 
his race-car movie than his contract provided. Paramount's film group co-chief, 
Sidney Ganis, said no, and studio chairman Frank Mancuso, with corporate boss 
Martin Davis looking over his shoulder from New York, stood behind him. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson and Bruckheimer, who had been brought in to produce the movie along 
with Cruise, blew up at Paramount for the low offer, and the actor threatened 
to quit. Cruise's longtime agent, Paula Wagner, Creative Artists Agency 
President Michael Ovitz and Cruise's lawyer, Barry Hirsch, came on strong. 
Finally, Tanen, who was by then semi-retired but consulting for the studio, 
helped patch things up and the studio made Cruise an offer he couldn't refuse: 
close to $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
The film, "Days of Thunder," is now emerging as Paramount's big hope for the 
summer. But not before the incident raised enough hackles to diminish the 
prospects for "Top Gun II," a potentially lucrative sequel that Paramount has 
talked about for years. Net result: The studio drew a line on cost, wound up 
paying anyway and still got stuck with hard feelings in the family. 
</P>
<P>
In Hollywood, of course, everybody fights everybody sooner or later, and family 
feuds haven't stopped Paramount from rolling out what some observers believe is 
this year's most potent slate of box-office attractions. 
</P>
<P>
Having perfected what it calls the "tent-pole movie" -- outsized event films 
like "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "Beverly Hills Cop" that spawn sequels 
strong enough to support a studio's less-certain bets -- Paramount has loaded 
its 1990 release schedule with an unusual number of high-visibility, high-cost 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
If they take off, those movies could return the studio to its premiere position 
at the box office. Despite some rough spots, Paramount has been on a hot streak 
since the late 1970s and ranks first among studios in cumulative ticket sales 
since 1986, when the Mancuso regime's films first appeared. But such recent 
disappointments as "We're No Angels" and "Harlem Nights" helped drop Paramount 
into fifth place among major film companies, with 13.8% market-share last year. 
The success of those movies could also establish the credibility of Paramount's 
peculiar management arrangement, which places the film operation under two 
co-presidents -- Ganis and marketing chief Barry London. 
</P>
<P>
If the films fail, they could deliver a bad jolt to Paramount Communications. 
Since selling its financial-services divisions to Ford Motor Co. in a daring 
divestiture last year, the company depends on its entertainment division for 
fully 61% of its $3-billion-plus annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
A series of flops or disappointments may also validate the growing belief in 
Hollywood that Paramount has been losing its grip ever since control of the 
studio's movie operation began shifting from executives with creative 
backgrounds to those grounded in marketing. Ganis, London, Mancuso, even 
company chief Davis, are all rooted in sales or publicity. In the studio 
hierarchy, production head Gary Lucchesi, a former William Morris agent, is the 
highest-ranked executive who came from the creative side. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews with The Times, several major film producers said they view 
Paramount's current management set-up with deep suspicion. When Barry Diller 
was the company's chairman and Michael Eisner ran its film division, the 
producers say, creative decisions were being made by executives with long years 
of experience working with producers, directors, writers and others involved on 
the production end. The heavy reliance on product from outside producers has, 
these critics maintain, impaired Paramount's ability to control its own 
destiny. 
</P>
<P>
"Paramount has become more corporate, more faceless," snaps one film executive 
who has dealt closely with the company. "The residual personality cult from the 
Diller days is wearing thin. Those guys were story tellers who would call each 
</P>
<P>
other in the middle of the night with ideas. The new guys are just worried 
about making deals." 
</P>
<P>
Some of Hollywood's top producers disagree. "Its the easiest thing in the world 
to criticize when a few months go by without success. . . . They've 
consistently been strong, and they're completely supportive of film makers," 
says Art Linson, who produced "The Untouchables," "We're No Angels" and other 
films for Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
One big bet is panning out nicely right now. Despite the threat of world peace, 
the studio's Cold War thriller "The Hunt for Red October" is a major hit, 
having taken in more than $40 million in its first two weeks in release. 
</P>
<P>
Another, Simpson and Bruckheimer's "Days of Thunder," which reunites the 
producers with Cruise and "Top Gun" director Tony Scott, is shooting in South 
Carolina with a June 8 release scheduled. The film will be closely followed by 
"Another 48 HRS.," in which Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte reprise their famous 
buddy roles for director Walter Hill, and by John Milius' "Flight of the 
Intruder," a Vietnam-era techno-thriller that actually promises more military 
hardware than "Red October." 
</P>
<P>
Later in the year, Paramount will release long-awaited sequels to hits of the 
early '70s. "The Two Jakes," the Jack Nicholson-directed sequel to "Chinatown," 
is scheduled for August but has been moved back twice and may not open until 
fall -- nearly a year after its original release date. Then Francis Ford 
Coppola's "The Godfather, Part III," the studio's obvious pride, will follow at 
Christmas. Studio executives say all is well with the third installment of a 
series that has won two best-picture Oscars, even though it is weeks behind 
schedule in Sicily. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, the person who may have the most at stake on those and the 10 
other movies on Paramount's 1990 schedule appears to be neither Ganis nor 
Mancuso but 62-year-old Martin Davis. Bronx-born and schooled in movie 
publicity at the old Samuel Goldwyn Co., Davis took charge of Paramount 
Communications, then known as Gulf + Western Industries, when founder Charles 
Bluhdorn died in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' early days were, according to many published accounts, marked by bitter 
feuds with Eisner and Diller, the upshot of which was Diller's departure from 
the studio. When Davis then bypassed Eisner for longtime marketing and 
distribution chief Frank Mancuso as Diller's replacement, Eisner left too. 
Diller ended up running 20th Century Fox, and Eisner took over at struggling 
Disney, where he was soon joined by his Paramount production head, Jeffrey 
Katzenberg. 
</P>
<P>
Mancuso, with a boost from assets he inherited -- the studio's Eddie Murphy 
connection, the "Star Trek" and "Raiders of the Lost Ark" "tent poles" -- led 
the studio through a phenomenal mid-'80s winning streak. But, in the minds of 
some of his detractors, Mancuso used up those franchises without developing 
many new ones. By stripping away the last of the conglomerate's non-media 
businesses last year, Davis focused attention on Paramount Pictures precisely 
as the studio's historically strong performance was hitting a roadblock. 
</P>
<P>
In its fiscal year that ended Oct. 31, Paramount, which doesn't separate movie 
and television results, reported $252.2 million in operating income from its 
entertainment division, which was about even with 1988, and down from a record 
$297.3 million in 1987. Davis has publicly predicted that entertainment results 
will be flat or down again this year, despite the big films and solid TV 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
Some Paramount executives say he was simply striking a conservative stance with 
the prediction. But the fiscal year got off to a bad start when the Robert De 
Niro-Sean Penn comedy "We're No Angels" flopped and Eddie Murphy's "Harlem 
Nights" petered out far short of expected grosses, pushing entertainment 
results down sharply. At the same time, Paramount's publishing operations 
posted some unusual quarterly losses thanks in part to tougher accounting 
standards. Eliminating interest income from its huge, $2.5-billion bankroll, 
which is earmarked for acquisitions, the parent company had an embarrassing 
$3.7-million loss for the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Besides making rich producer deals (just added to the Paramount family: 
"Driving Miss Daisy" producers Richard and Lili Zanuck and Jerry Perenchio), 
management has raised the studio's pool of development scripts by a third to 
approximately 200 in a push to produce as many as 25 films annually within 
three years. According to studio financial reports, the aggregate spent on 
upcoming movies and TV shows has shot up to about $750 million, nearly twice 
what was spent in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
While studio officers decline to discuss budgets, individuals with close ties 
to Paramount say the company is investing about $200 million on four films -- 
"The Hunt for Red October," "Days of Thunder," "Another 48 HRS." and "Godfather 
III." Throw in the costs of "The Two Jakes" and "The Flight of the Intruder" 
and the studio may have close to a quarter of a billion dollars riding on just 
six horses. 
</P>
<P>
"Godfather III" was originally budgeted at about $45 million and appears 
certain to go over, despite the 20 pages that Coppola and Paramount production 
president Gary Lucchesi recently cut from the script. "Red October" cost more 
than $35 million -- its budget upped partly by an 11th-hour scramble to reshoot 
special effects at Industrial Light &amp; Magic after another company delivered 
submarine shots that looked, according to one Paramount insider, like a "cigar 
in a bathtub." 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts point out that big budgets, in and of themselves, aren't 
necessarily bad business. A sequel, after all, has to look and perform even 
better than the original to counteract public skepticism. And big-name stars do 
cushion the risk of a film falling on its face. The problem is more 
profitability -- which can be diminished in the face of huge salaries and 
commitments to the stars for shares of gross receipts. An unexpected hit such 
as 1984's "Flashdance," which cost about $10 million to make and grossed $175 
million worldwide, can generate far more over the long haul than a more 
expensive "sure-shot." 
</P>
<P>
"With everyone taking a participation, the films become more marginally 
profitable even though market share goes up," warns an executive who left 
Paramount's movie operation in recent years. "When I measure the health of a 
company, I look not to the franchises but to the surprise successes a regime 
can create. You look at Disney's ability to come up with a 'Dead Poets Society' 
or 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,' or Universal's consistency with 'Field of 
Dreams,' 'Parenthood' and 'Sea of Love.' " 
</P>
<P>
Mancuso argues that expanding foreign markets, from which Paramount now gets 
nearly 50% of its revenue, make it easier to gamble on big films -- as long as 
the stars or stories have obvious global appeal. But Mancuso has also spent 
heavier than ever simply to get his traditional "tent poles" this year. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question, our slate this year is more expensive than previous 
years," says the 56-year-old Mancuso. "But my perception of that is, it's also 
the greatest opportunity we've had." 
</P>
<P>
The executive most responsible for finding surprise hits and keeping the 
well-worn "franchises" fresh at Paramount is Sid Ganis. 
</P>
<P>
Taut and trim with an impeccably groomed beard, Ganis looks younger than his 49 
years. Having spent seven years in Marin County as marketing director and 
aide-de-camp for George Lucas, he is still a bit of an outsider in Hollywood. 
He keeps a second home not in Malibu but Bolinas, a foggy Northern California 
coastal town, and he cruised Los Angeles theaters on "Red October's" opening 
night not in a BMW or Mercedes but in a Honda Civic. 
</P>
<P>
The Brooklyn-born son of a taxi driver, Ganis landed his first show-business 
job as an office boy for Broadway publicist Lee Solters, who was then handling 
such stage luminaries as Barbra Streisand and David Merrick. Ganis quickly 
moved on to 20th Century Fox and Columbia, then went to work for Seven Arts 
just as that company was purchasing Warner Bros. Ganis transferred to Los 
Angeles with Warner and spent the early '70s working as a movie publicist and 
advertising manager for both Warner and CBS' film division, but he also earned 
a film credit -- as assistant to producer-director Joseph L. Mankiewicz on 
"There Was a Crooked Man." 
</P>
<P>
Ganis turned north in 1978 and joined Lucas, whose fledgling film company was 
explicitly designed to resist money-driven Hollywood values. "I was his 
sidekick," Ganis says of his close ties to Lucas during the years when the 
director-producer used profits from "Star Wars" and "Raiders of the Lost Ark" 
to build his secluded movie ranch. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, when Lucas was becoming more interested in his technology businesses 
than in his film making, Ganis left to join Paramount as marketing chief. Even 
as Ganis passed through the Paramount arch on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood, Ned 
Tanen -- a film industry veteran who had put in 29 years at MCA-Universal 
before Mancuso brought him over -- was alerting everyone that he planned to 
retire. As it happened, Tanen stayed for two more years -- two wildly 
successful years when Paramount outperformed the Diller-Eisner regime with such 
hits as "The Untouchables," "Fatal Attraction" and "Coming to America." 
</P>
<P>
With Tanen about to leave, Mancuso surveyed the Paramount family and found two 
people he considered worthy successors. So he gave the job to both. He split 
the studio's film presidency between Ganis and 42-year-old Barry London, whose 
rise through show business mirrored Mancuso's. A theater usher while attending 
UCLA, London joined Paramount as Los Angeles-area film booker in 1971 and 
climbed to the top of the studio's distribution and marketing operations. 
</P>
<P>
Mancuso says he structured the split of the presidency to avoid the kind of 
conflicts between marketing and production departments that were rampant at 
Paramount during the early '80s. The dual presidency has apparently made life 
calmer behind the studio arches, but it has given some key industry players 
outside the impression that no one's in charge. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no leadership there," said a talent agent who represents some of the 
industry's biggest stars. "You talk to three different people and get three 
different answers." 
</P>
<P>
A producer under contract agreed, adding: "No one takes responsibility for 
anything. And you don't make a lot of friends without decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Paramount executives strongly defend their system as collaborative but not 
dilutive. "This is not rule by committee," says Mancuso. 
</P>
<P>
London is in charge of marketing and Ganis oversees production, but each has 
input into the other's area. When it comes to giving the go-ahead to projects, 
they meet with Mancuso, who makes the final decision. Ganis and London together 
oversee the casting of the films, production details and marketing strategies. 
</P>
<P>
"(Ganis) puts something in development. He talks about a concept, and I say, 
'Gee, I think that's a terrific idea,' or 'No, I don't like it,' " explains 
London, who contributes his opinions again when it's time to cast a film. 
</P>
<P>
The system's real test will have less to do with its handling of the big 
sequels, an area in which it has long excelled, or even with some of the event 
films such as "The Hunt for Red October" and "Days of Thunder," in which Tanen 
has remained heavily involved, than with some fresh pictures that will tell 
whether Ganis has a million-dollar gut instinct and can assert it in tandem 
with London. 
</P>
<P>
Critics aside, Ganis has one major player -- George Lucas -- betting that he 
can. "He has strong feelings about the creative side of this business. He knows 
how to treat film makers," Lucas says of his protege. 
</P>
<P>
One such film is "Crazy People" (coming out April 11), a comedy about 
advertising that pairs Dudley Moore with Daryl Hannah and director Tony Bill. 
</P>
<P>
Another is "Ghost," a suspense film with Patrick Swayze, Whoopi Goldberg and 
Demi Moore that will test the ability of director Jerry Zucker ("Airplane!," 
co-writer of "The Naked Gun") to do something other than broad comedy. 
</P>
<P>
However these films perform, it seems clear that they will begin pushing 
Paramount away from what one of the studio's producers has called the 
"mean-spirited" edge of "Beverly Hills Cop" or a "Fatal Attraction" and toward 
the warmer kind of themes -- "Field of Dreams," "Dead Poets Society," "Driving 
Miss Daisy" -- that are paying off for other studios. 
</P>
<P>
"Can we find a film that has the emotional quality of 'Shane' to make here? 
Boy, we are looking for it," says Ganis. "Can we find the comedy that's going 
to be even more hilarious than we think 'Crazy People' is? Yeah, we are 
looking." 
</P>
<P>
Another peculiar element in the architecture of Frank Mancuso's Paramount 
family is its heavy reliance on some very strong producers. While Disney and 
Warner, for instance, have worked a wide field in Hollywood, Paramount has 
turned inward, preferring to cultivate exclusive, long-term relationships with 
Simpson and Bruckheimer ("Beverly Hills Cop," "Top Gun"), Stanley Jaffe and 
Sherry Lansing ("Fatal Attraction," "Black Rain"), Art Linson ("The 
Untouchables," "Scrooged"), Eddie Murphy ("Coming to America," "Harlem 
Nights"), Mace Neufeld and Bob Rehme ("Red October," "Flight of the Intruder"), 
Paul Hogan ("Crocodile Dundee") and the Zanuck Co. 
</P>
<P>
The system locks in on the outside what some think Paramount doesn't have on 
the inside -- vast experience and creative force. Simpson, Jaffe, Lansing, 
Richard Zanuck and Howard W. Koch ("Airplane," "Ghost"), for instance, have all 
run major studio production units. But critics say the system also diffuses 
power and threatens to create its own inflationary spiral. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Murphy has two pictures remaining on a five-picture deal that reportedly 
guarantees him $10 million or more a picture. Still, he recently told Playboy 
magazine that it was "the worst deal in town" and -- family feelings 
notwithstanding -- appears to be putting himself out for bids as soon as his 
contract expires. It's a reality the studio seems to be sidestepping. "No 
matter what you read in the papers, I believe Eddie secretly loves the studio," 
says Ganis. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, and Donald loves Ivana," retorts one Murphy friend. "It's like a 
marriage. You don't just give your wife money for food and clothing. You send 
flowers from time to time to keep the romance and the allure alive. Sometimes 
the studio comes around, but every inch of the way is like pulling teeth." 
</P>
<P>
By several accounts, Murphy, Art Linson and the Jaffe-Lansing team voiced 
resentment over the unusually rich and exceedingly public Simpson-Bruckheimer 
deal announced by Mancuso in January, a bit of family largess that Paramount 
then trumpeted in full-page ads in The Los Angeles Times, the Wall Street 
Journal, the New York Times and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Linson denies the talk of resentment and speaks admiringly of Mancuso's 
willingness to ride with producers through both their hits and their misses. 
But he adds: "This deal is going to cause everybody else's deal to go up or 
people are going to leave -- as long as the market will support them." 
</P>
<P>
Jaffe also denies any resentment. "I don't care if somebody pays them a lot of 
money, as long as they don't take it out of my pocket," he says. Jaffe-Lansing 
managed to enhance their own deal with the studio recently under an agreement 
to increase production to two films a year. The producers made only five movies 
for Paramount in the last seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Neither studio executives nor Simpson and Bruckheimer would discuss details of 
their pact, which requires Paramount to finance and distribute a minimum of 
five films for the pair over the next five years. Privately, however, studio 
insiders describe the deal, and the dickering that led to it, as an 
extraordinary exercise in power politics. 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, the deal gives Simpson and Bruckheimer the right to "put" up to 
five films to Paramount. That means the studio is compelled to make whatever 
film the producers want to make, without approval over script and casting, as 
long as they stay under prescribed budget ceilings. They also get a percentage 
of the studio's revenues from the very first dollar taken in, a concession 
given to top stars and a handful of directors but seldom to producers. 
</P>
<P>
The studio plugged the deal in newspaper ads as a "visionary alliance" -- after 
all, the producers' movies have grossed more than $2 billion worldwide, 
including ancillary markets. But some studio executives privately talked the 
deal down to reporters, claiming the budget ceilings are too low for the 
producers' style of film. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the budgets start at $20 million and escalate to about $25 million, 
film by film, and are calculated without including studio charges and 
development costs. That puts them at about the major studio average of $23 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson and Bruckheimer haven't delivered a movie in three years, at least 
partly because of the time involved in negotiating their deal. They may also 
have been slowed by a bitter legal squabble with Simpson's former secretary, 
who sued him and Paramount, charging that Simpson behaved abusively and used 
drugs on the lot. Simpson has denied the allegations and countersued. The cases 
are pending. Asked if he investigated the claims independently, Mancuso said 
"yes," but he declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the deal was signed, there were again hard feelings at the studio, 
where some executives felt they had been forced to feed the egos of a duo 
resentful of the media attention heaped on producers Jon Peters and Peter 
Guber, Larry Gordon and others. One Paramount executive was particularly struck 
by Simpson's printed statement that Paramount from now on would simply put up 
cash, and "we meet at the theater." 
</P>
<P>
It was, said the executive, "an insult." 
</P>
<P>
The other Mancuso on Paramount's lot is the chairman's 31-year-old son, a movie 
producer who followed in his father's footsteps by booking short subjects into 
Canadian theaters for Paramount during the summer when he was just 14. 
</P>
<P>
Mancuso Jr. is best-known for producing two of Paramount's gory "Friday the 
13th" movies and helping the studio keep the eight-film series on track. "I 
became a kind of adopted godfather to the movies," he says of his role. 
</P>
<P>
Eager to get beyond the hack-'em-up exploitation genre, the younger Mancuso was 
executive producer of an ill-fated attempt to make "The Two Jakes" in 1985. On 
the very day shooting was to begin, his company pulled the plug amid squabbling 
over issues that included producer Robert Evans' insistence on acting in the 
film. 
</P>
<P>
The producer had a bit more success with "Internal Affairs," a police thriller 
that grossed $26 million for Paramount in the United States but ran into 
problems when, according to published reports, a union pension fund threatened 
to sue Paramount. The charge: that Mancuso Jr.'s Out of Town Films was set up 
as a sham corporation designed to avoid labor contracts. 
</P>
<P>
As Mancuso Jr. sees it, the union is trying to renege on its own agreement to 
let independent companies film for the studios under certain conditions. "The 
reason this became so celebrated is that we had the audacity to shoot in Los 
Angeles, and because of my name," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Mancuso Sr. says he doesn't interfere with his son's work, despite Mancuso 
Jr.'s close association with the movie operation. 
</P>
<P>
"My son's career is his career. I have nothing to do with his career. He makes 
his choices," he says. The father adds: "I want you also to be very careful 
here, because it's my family, and I'm very sensitive to that." 
</P>
<P>
It shouldn't be surprising that Mancuso identifies himself more closely with 
"Godfather III" than any other Paramount film, given the intensity of feeling 
that binds his own, familial studio together -- and sometimes tears it apart. 
</P>
<P>
Bluhdorn, before he died, had been passionate in his quest for another 
"Godfather," and he relied on Mancuso -- who then worked in New York, in daily 
contact with the corporate chief -- to cultivate the studio's relationship with 
Coppola and keep delicate pressure on the director for a third film. 
</P>
<P>
Mancuso feels pride of authorship about the movie, having worked for years to 
persuade an unwilling Coppola to make it. He speaks of the saga in reverential 
terms, calling it not a "sequel" but "a literary work, with Chapters 1, 2 and 
3." 
</P>
<P>
The script, co-written by Mario Puzo, another Mancuso friend, portrays a 
graying but still potent Michael Corleone (a role reprised by Al Pacino) as he 
moves to sever his family's Las Vegas ties in favor of an alliance with the 
Vatican. A glimpse of footage promises no shortage of blood. But the very 
closest clans, and companies, sometimes work that way. 
</P>
<P>
"I see it as the continuing story of an American family," Mancuso says of the 
film. "A story of power, what power does, the corruption of power, and the 
positive aspects of power." 
</P>
<P>
Not unlike Hollywood.

THE REDEFINING OF A DANCER'S BODY; 
</P>
<P>
MANY ARE PUMPING IRON TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF MODERN CHOREOGRAPHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GIGI BERARDI, Berardi, a free-lance writer, is the author of Finding Your 
Balance, a health and fitness book for dancers, due this year from Princeton. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before each of his San Francisco Ballet company classes, Lawrence Pech works 
out in the gym with Nautilus machines and a physical and mental conditioning 
program known as Pilates. Dancer/bodybuilder Lawrence Leritz is at Gold's Gym, 
L.A.'s weightlifting mecca, six days a week. Kathryn Karipides is in her studio 
every day and just by using her body weight for resistance, has built up 
strength and maintained a highly visible muscle definition at the age of 53. 
</P>
<P>
Today more and more dancers are trying to dance longer and look stronger. While 
performances and rehearsals have always been demanding, modern choreography 
increasingly calls for dancers to execute repetitive power moves or difficult 
off-center balances. And contemporary works are getting longer -- requiring 
dancers to have much more stamina. 
</P>
<P>
The men have an especially rough time. They are expected to lift their partners 
and to dance. But even the women are finding a need for upper body strength and 
body symmetry to prevent injuries. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, many dancers have turned to pumping iron and working out to define 
and strengthen their muscles, to remain healthy and maybe to prolong their 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't long ago that only a few men in the top ballet companies had the 
strength to execute a sustained lift. The men in the companies were divided 
into two types -- smaller men capable of dancing the virtuoso variations and 
bigger men who carried the ballerinas. 
</P>
<P>
This is changing, according to choreographer and former Royal Ballet principal 
David Drew. Artistic directors and choreographers are now defining a whole new 
generation of superdancers with muscle definition and stamina. For example, 
Drew says that at his school all the males receive weight training and recent 
graduates are performing overhead lifts with ease. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Marks, artistic director of the Boston Ballet, says: "We're getting away 
from that lithe, elongated look in ballet. Now audiences want to see people 
working hard in a performance. So not only do dancers have to dance 
differently, they have to look different." 
</P>
<P>
Most ballet companies today perform contemporary works as well as the classics. 
"If the ballet companies just did 19th-Century repertory, the dancers wouldn't 
need any extra strength training," explains Marks, a former principal dancer 
with American Ballet Theatre. "In Bournonville choreography, there's hardly any 
lifting at all. But now companies perform complicated contemporary lifts. 
Dancers have to look strong and be strong." 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Duell, artistic director of Ballet Chicago and a former New York City 
Ballet principal, agrees. "As long as the strength training doesn't interfere 
with the line or grace of movement, it can be an asset -- especially in 
partnering." 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Wilde, artistic director of Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre and one of 
NYCB's best-known former principals, adds: "For 'Theme and Variations,' you 
need a certain amount of muscle for the elevation. I have one very big and 
muscular soloist and I wouldn't hesitate to cast him in 'Theme.' And that's a 
ballet that also requires a very soft, cat-like quality. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as the proper line is there and I have the partners for the big 
dancers, I'll cast them in major roles. That's the problem, though, finding the 
partners matched in weight and size -- aesthetically and physically." 
</P>
<P>
Artistic directors -- many of whom were dancers themselves -- know that having 
a safe technique and a strong body is the only way to safely perform lifts. The 
strength usually means having more muscle mass or definition. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at Peter Martins. He's beautifully defined," Duell says. "Eddy Villella 
too. Perhaps some people thought he was overly muscular; but he was still 
graceful when he danced. 
</P>
<P>
"As an artistic director, the muscle definition is one of many considerations 
in casting. Right now I have a very thin but toned dancer. He still needs more 
muscle mass. What can I do with him in 'Apollo?' The muscular definition is 
part of the presence." 
</P>
<P>
Dancers, too, are searching for a new image. They want "real muscles, not pads" 
in their costumes. "Sometimes it's just vanity," says Christine Redpath, NYCB 
assistant ballet master. Not every person in the company lifts weights, but 
Redpath says several dancers are "really serious" about it. "They use machines 
and other gym equipment. They work on press lifting especially, others work on 
leg exercises. There are some who should do it and don't." 
</P>
<P>
"Some boys from New York City Ballet lift weights," says Adam Luders, principal 
dancer at the company. "This really isn't necessary if you are a principal. It 
depends on your priorities. I would rather think about the part than its 
physicality. You should spend time in the studio and think more about what you 
are doing." 
</P>
<P>
Pech, principal dancer in his fourth season with the San Francisco Ballet, says 
he tries to be systematic with his weight training, although it is sometimes 
difficult on tour. He reports that more hotels are providing a gym service, and 
suggests that dancers take advantage of this. 
</P>
<P>
"The facilities are there," says Pech, who was with ABT for six years. "But few 
dancers seriously train. The dancers may work out one day, they're sore the 
next, then they leave it. Yet as soon as they are injured, they're in the gym 
again. Usually, for the men, it's a back injury or tendinitis that brings them 
back to training." 
</P>
<P>
That, and ego, Pech adds, "After a hard pas de deux, you can't stop the music 
and apologize to the audience that you're too tired to go on." 
</P>
<P>
Such concerns prompted Elizabeth Henry and Marika Molnar, physical therapists 
for NYCB, to coordinate an education and strengthening program for the back. It 
is targeted specifically for male dancers in the company. 
</P>
<P>
Using only body weights for resistance, the physical therapists work with 
dancers on strengthening their abdominal musculature. They apply the movement 
and strengthening principles when practicing vertical and low traveling lifts. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that much greater upper body symmetry and strength is needed 
in order to protect the dancer from injuries," says dance kinesiologist Judithe 
Gantz. 
</P>
<P>
This is especially important for professional female dancers who, according to 
Gantz, rarely work their upper body muscles as much as male dancers. Most of 
the arm movements typical of female ballet and modern dancers require little 
upper body strength. 
</P>
<P>
Duell encourages lifting of free weights among the dancers he directs in Ballet 
Chicago. He's an advocate of a system of strength training called "perpetual 
gyrotonics" that uses free-standing exercise machines. 
</P>
<P>
"The machines are ideal since you can vary the resistance with both springs and 
weights," Duell says. "Dancers love it -- to have separate exercises that 
address specific weaknesses. Every dance studio ideally should have accessory 
exercises and systems." Duell also incorporates alignment, strength and 
breathing exercises based on yoga principles into the company's training 
regimen. 
</P>
<P>
At Boston Ballet, Marks specifically asks his male dancers to weight train. 
"Sure, they need to work on upper body strength, but lifts are actually done 
with the explosive power in the legs." He wants his dancers to weight train 
with light weights and multiple repetitions, to build muscular endurance rather 
than excessive bulk. 
</P>
<P>
Most of his dancers use the Pilates system, which was used by dance pioneers 
such as Ruth St. Denis, Ted Shawn, Martha Graham, Pearl Primus and George 
Balanchine. It is one of the most common methods of strength training used by 
professional dancers today. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the conditioning work consisted of a series of exercises performed 
on a mat. Later, Joseph Pilates designed the Universal Reformer, a sliding, 
horizontal bed on which the dancer may pull or push against a metal bar or 
leather straps. The resistance is provided by detachable springs. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Leslie, physical therapist at SFB says: "Very few dancers are 
interested in training three to five days a week -- until they're injured. 
That's changing, though, as dancers realize the importance of strength training 
to improve their fitness levels." 
</P>
<P>
According to Leslie, up to one-third of the SFB dancers use some resistance for 
strength training, whether it be large rubber bands, machines or free weights. 
Leslie advises all of the dancers about their strengthening programs, giving 
repetition and weight-load guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Interviews with dancers indicate they are interested in something more than 
increasing their muscular endurance. They could be prolonging their performing 
careers. More and more are commiting to strength training. But then so are the 
artistic directors. 
</P>
<P>
As Marks says: "Strength training and lifting weights is not a trend. It's an 
everyday occurrence in dance now. Artistic directors have to realize that it's 
not the exception, it's the norm."

TAKING THE PULSE OF NEW LATIN BEAT IN SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Poncho Sanchez is really into it. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting behind his three black conga drums at the Vine Street Bar &amp; Grill 
in Hollywood on a recent Thursday, Sanchez is knocking out a solo on the tune 
Latin/jazz tune, "Half and Half." 
</P>
<P>
The charismatic, full-bearded Sanchez attacks his drums with feverish thumps 
from his palms, stinging slaps from his fingers and furious palm-and-finger 
dances that make the drums seem to purr. 
</P>
<P>
On the same Thursday, Johnny Martinez, 60, fronts his 10-piece Hollywood Salsa 
Machine at Excess, a huge disco with two dance floors in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
As the band soars through such tunes as "Anything for You," colorfully 
decked-out couples fill the dance floor in front of the ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
Poncho Sanchez is the local king of Latin/jazz, and Johnny Martinez is his 
salsa counterpart. The pair are the most visible members of a scene that is a 
rich, vital part of the Los Angeles musical horizon that includes such other 
major players as Bobby Matos and Heritage Ensemble, Costa Azul, Susie Hansen, 
Bongo Logic, Francisco Aguabella, Eric Bobo and Rudy Regalado and Chevere. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the action takes place at Miami Spice in Venice, El Floridita in 
Hollywood, Stevens Steak House in the City of Commerce and the Quiet Cannon in 
Montebello -- arguably the major rooms. But these clubs, and others like Vine 
Street and Pedro's Grill in Hollywood, don't sport Latin/jazz or salsa nightly, 
though they do feature it with increasing regularity. 
</P>
<P>
The live action is only one part of a growing fascination with Latin music in 
Southern California. And while this fascination has not yet blossomed into a 
boom, Latin/jazz and salsa are being heard more and more in the clubs, on the 
radio stations, in dance studios and in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Latin/jazz and salsa are similar but distinctive; generally speaking, both are 
of Afro-Cuban origin and based on the son rhythmic form that originated in 
Cuba. While salsa emphasizes vocals, utilizes traditional Latin material and 
focuses on danceable rhythms, Latin/jazz draws on the mainstream jazz 
tradition, features fewer vocals and is less danceable. Both musics delve into 
such well-known rhythmic forms as the cha-cha mambo and rumba. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, since most Latinos grew up with these styles of music, the interest 
in them increases as the number of immigrants from Latin countries climbs and 
Latinos become the majority here. 
</P>
<P>
"What's happening is that Latin/jazz, salsa and the related musics are becoming 
the emotional heartbeat music of Latinos here, no matter where they're from," 
says percussionist Matos, a former New Yorker who moved to Los Angeles in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
While Latinos dominate the culture that follows Latin-based music, they are not 
the only ones who listen, dance to it or play it. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of people like me, non-Hispanics who speak the language, know 
the dance steps and enjoy Latin cuisine," says Holly Barnhill, public relations 
manager of the Biltmore Hotel and a self-described salsero, or salsa fanatic. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the primary component in the ongoing interest in salsa and, to some 
extent, Latin jazz, is that it's designed for dancing. 
</P>
<P>
"These are such wonderful rhythmic forms that it's hard to not move to them," 
says Susie Hansen, a former Chicago-based violinist. "You go to a club like 
Miami Spice, and look at the people who are dancing, they have this light in 
their faces, they're smiling." 
</P>
<P>
Radio is helping expose Latin/jazz and salsa to the general public in a major 
way. The invigorating, pulsing sounds are heard on a dozen Los Angeles-area 
stations, from all-Spanish language KLVE-FM to diverse KCRW-FM to all-jazz 
KLON-FM, but only intermittently or on specialty shows. And while little 
exposure doesn't engender growth by leaps and bounds, it does help. 
</P>
<P>
"I play Latin music every day, in one shape or another," says Tom Schnabel, 
music director of KCRW-FM and host of that station's well-received "Morning 
Becomes Eclectic" program which airs Mon.-Fri., 9 a.m.-noon. 
</P>
<P>
Matos was one of many artists who insisted that radio was crucial to continued 
awareness and interest in Latin music. "Shows like 'Canto Tropical' (airing on 
KPFK (90.7FM), Saturdays 7-10 p.m.) and 'Alma del Barrio' (which airs on KXLU 
(88.9 FM), 6 a.m.-6 p.m., Saturdays and Sundays) are among the only places you 
can hear the new hits," he says. "They have supported us through the years." 
</P>
<P>
Records by local Latin bands are becoming more plentiful, though not too many 
Los Angeles Latin/jazz and salsa bands have "a hip record company behind them," 
as Sanchez says, referring to his longtime association with the Concord Picante 
label, which has just released his sixth album, "Chile Con Soul." 
</P>
<P>
Other bands recording these days include Matos, who is currently in the studio 
following up his "Bobby Matos and Heritage Ensemble" Enclave label debut; 
keyboardist/composer Clare Fischer, who has recorded for both Discovery and 
Concord Picante; and Brent Gollin's Bongo Logic, percussionist Luis Conte and 
Ed Jones and La Familia. 
</P>
<P>
Clubs that book Latin/jazz and salsa, however irregularly, are most often quite 
happy with the results. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing really well," says Lali Lugassy, booking agent for Miami Spice, 
which features such groups as Costa Azul, Susie Hansen and Papo Conga four 
nights a week. "Weekends are good and Tuesdays, when we have our musicians' 
jam, though a little slow, are picking up." 
</P>
<P>
But if Latin/jazz and salsa are so appealing and so much fun to dance to, why 
haven't they had the more across-the-board acceptance of, say, the lambada, or 
Latin/rock bands like the Miami Sound Machine? Answer: They are not yet part of 
the day-in, day-out musical diet of mainstream America. 
</P>
<P>
"When there are waves of interest in this music, especially when films like 
"Dirty Dancing" and "Salsa" are hot, we think, 'This is it! It's going to make 
the big time,' but it really hasn't happened," Barnhill says. "It just hasn't 
panned out a the big way." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Latin scene in Los Angeles has always been alive, though some 
periods have definitely been more healthy than others. And there's plenty of 
optimism for continued growth. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very joyous, celebratory type of music," says musician and producer Tom 
Regis. "Once it hooks you, you're in. It has the potential to reach a much 
larger audience." 
</P>

PLAN OUTLINED FOR POMONA'S REVITALIZATION; 
</P>
<P>
CITY PLANNING: CONSULTANTS FIND CRIME AND EDUCATION PROBLEMS. BUT THEIR REPORT 
SAYS POMONA COULD BECOME 'THE CULTURAL CENTER OF THE EAST SAN GABRIEL VALLEY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
POMONA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city should turn its fading downtown into a lively, Latin-flavored cultural 
and shopping hub, establish magnet schools and pare down its management-heavy 
city work force, a consultants' report recommended last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Pomona is the only real city in this area," said Trevor A. Campbell, who 
coordinated the city-commissioned strategic planning study by the Center for 
Leadership Resources in Granada Hills. "Most of the adjoining cities tend to be 
largely bedroom communities. Pomona goes beyond a bedroom community . . . 
Pomona can be the cultural center of the east San Gabriel Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell conducted the seven-month, $60,000 study along with Eduardo M. Ochoa, 
associate professor of economics at Cal State Los Angeles, and Lukman Clarke, a 
management expert. 
</P>
<P>
The team surveyed public opinion, interviewed community leaders and examined 
the city's social and economic conditions to devise a five-year strategy for 
economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the researchers' findings were expected. They noted, for example, that 
Pomona, with a population of about 120,000, lags behind neighboring cities in 
education and income levels and leads in violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
But there were some surprises too. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone survey of 434 households in Pomona, the consultants found that 
most residents said they feel safe in their neighborhoods. Only 9% said crime 
was out of control. Nearly three-fourths said crime was either a small problem 
or no problem at all. 
</P>
<P>
However, Ochoa said the response may reflect the way the question was phrased. 
If residents had been asked whether crime was a serious problem in Pomona, he 
said, most would probably have said yes, but not in their own neighborhoods. 
The city had 44 murders last year, the highest total ever reported in the San 
Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that most residents pay little attention to city 
government. Half of those surveyed said they never follow the activities of the 
often-contentious City Council, and 80% said they have had no occasion to deal 
with City Hall in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council commissioned the study to develop a strategy for promoting 
economic development and making government more effective. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the recommendations -- such as magnet high schools, job training for 
residents and programs to help small businesses -- would entail substantial 
costs. The report does not attempt to calculate costs or explore in depth how 
the money might be raised. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Tomas Ursua, who proposed the study, said many approaches could be 
taken. Substantial state and federal grants exist for job training and cultural 
programs, he said. But some of the money could come from a shift in priorities. 
</P>
<P>
He said the City Council has thought nothing in the past of giving hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in redevelopment funds to subsidize the purchase of 
property for developers. He said this report suggests that the city might gain 
more by putting that money into job-training and other purposes instead of 
giving it to developers. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have here is the beginning of a new way of thinking," Ursua said, "and 
it's going to take time for it to become a reality." 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the consultants suggested that Pomona look to Santa Ana as a 
model of self-improvement. Both cities have high Latino populations and 
residents with similar education levels. And both have large numbers of old 
commercial buildings, the consultants said. But Santa Ana has revitalized its 
economy, whereas Pomona has fallen behind. 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa said Santa Ana has adopted a Mexican theme for its downtown area "with 
small quaint shops, restaurants and so forth, and they have managed to tap into 
a market that is right there. I think that strategy could work here." 
</P>
<P>
Downtown Pomona was the region's retail center years ago, but it now houses a 
single department store, Buffums, and an odd mixture of other establishments, 
including antique shops, an osteopathic college, storefront churches, furniture 
stores and thrift outlets, along with a significant number of empty buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The consultants said the city also should promote the arts in its downtown 
area. They suggested sponsorship of outdoor music festivals and art shows, 
establishment of a playhouse theater in cooperation with local schools and 
colleges, and the development of a multiplex movie theater that would show 
art-house films. 
</P>
<P>
The report also recommended that the city promote construction of condominiums 
instead of apartments near the downtown area, and encourage the use of downtown 
buildings as artists' lofts. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Dahms, president of the Central Business District in Pomona, said downtown 
already has a little-noticed but growing artists' colony. He said he has not 
read the consultants' entire report but agrees with portions he has seen. 
</P>
<P>
On the education front, the consultants recommended that the city work with the 
school district in establishing an arts magnet program at Garey High School 
because it is near downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The report also proposed a health sciences magnet at Pomona High School to tie 
in with the growth of Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center and other medical 
facilities. Finally, it suggested establishment of a business magnet at Ganesha 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
Such magnet schools offer intensive training in specialized areas. 
</P>
<P>
Irv Moskowitz, superintendent of the Pomona Unified School District, said he 
has not seen the report, but he said district staff members have recently begun 
assembling information for a new long-range plan for the district. Moskowitz 
said magnet schools are one of many options. 
</P>
<P>
In their analysis of city government, the consultants concluded that the city 
is overstaffed with managers and has been hampered by weak executive 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
The consultants found that one-fourth of Pomona's municipal work force is 
classified as management, compared to 10% in most cities. The report says that 
some workers were probably promoted to management classifications because there 
was no other way of rewarding employee performance. 
</P>
<P>
The consultants suggested that the city reorganize its classifications so 
workers can advance monetarily without being promoted to a management-level 
salary. The city could save $500,000 to $600,000 by reducing the number of 
managerial positions, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
City Administrator Julio Fuentes said he has not examined the staffing claim. 
"I'm always open-minded and will look at that," he said, "but I don't have 
anything to say about it at this point." 
</P>
<P>
The consultants said the city has many strong individual managers and 
employees, but "they are frustrated by a system that undercuts innovativeness 
and teamwork." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the consultants' report also suggests raising residents' job skill 
levels. They noted that while Pomona has more jobs than neighboring cities, 
many of these jobs are held by people who live outside the city. Pomona 
residents have trouble competing for jobs in their own city because of low 
education and skill levels, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The consultants recommended that the city, schools and colleges cooperate on 
programs to upgrade job skills, and that the city adopt a policy of requiring 
any business with city contracts to first interview Pomona residents when 
hiring. 
</P>

The House failed to override President Bush's veto of a bill (HR 1231)

Help for U.S. Foundries 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 382 to 27, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 1243) setting 
up three government research centers to help the faltering metal casting 
industry become more competitive. The new federal program would cost the 
Treasury $15 million over three years, and foundries also would fund it. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Ben Erdreich (D-Ala.) said "over half of U.S. foundries have closed 
since 1971, putting tens of thousands of Americans out of work." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Bill Frenzel (R-Minn.) asked: "Why should the government finance

By his own admission, that homespun storyteller, Garrison Keillor, loathed 
going on holidays -- until marrying his Danish sweetheart and discovering "what 
a true vacation means," a revelation he describes with warmth in this issue of 
Traveling in Style. Keillor is my kind of fellow. 
</P>
<P>
His idea of roughing it is a "warm shower and a comfortable bed." Forget 
mountain climbing. Forget river rafting. He enjoys sitting in a park in 
Copenhagen and marveling at the blue sky. 
</P>
<P>
 Keillor is best known for his book, "Lake Wobegon Days," and his 
enormously-popular radio show, "A Prairie Home Companion," that for years was 
beamed to millions of Americans, with Keillor describing life in a fictional 
Minnesota burg and the goings-on at Ralph's Pretty Good Grocery, Bob's Bank, 
Bertha's Kitty Boutique, the Chatterbox Cafe and Skoglund's Five &amp; Dime. It 
is with the same simple style that he entertains us today. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk-show host Michael Jackson regales us with his tale of ballooning in 
France as the guest of magazine magnate Malcomb Forbes. On other pages we're 
entertained by Times columnist Al Martinez, author-artist Barnaby Conrad, chef 
Paul Prudhomme, Sylvia Porter, Charles Ehret, Charles N. Barnard and Patricia 
Wells. Finally, I invite you to join me on a visit to a Swiss hideaway that 
caters to sybarites and celebrities. JERRY HULSE

NEW ORLEANS A LA CARTE: A NOTED NATIVE CONDUCTS A TOUR OF THE MANY CHARMS OF 
THE CRESCENT CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL PRUDHOMME, Prudhomme is a noted chef and New Orleans native. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW ORLEANS IS MY CITY, and the closer I get to the real New Orleans, the more 
I begin to feel its mystery. 
</P>
<P>
I start to feel it as I drive past the city's cemeteries. The water table in 
New Orleans is very high and people must be buried above ground. Thus the 
cemeteries, with their expanses of granite and marble tombs, are themselves 
like cities, extraordinary works that are especially beautiful and mystical. 
</P>
<P>
Since much of New Orleans is below sea level, huge pumps constantly remove 
water from under the city -- and that, again, is part of its mystery. Should 
the pumps stop working, parts of New Orleans would simply disappear. 
</P>
<P>
As I drive into the city, I like to take the Canal Street exit off I-10 to get 
into the downtown area. Canal is the main street and its history is 
fascinating. Many years ago, the intention was to make this route a 
50-foot-wide canal with boats for transportation. But the waterway was never 
dug and today Canal Street is a huge avenue that separates what I consider to 
be the two main areas of New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
To get a good look at one part, you can take an old-fashioned streetcar that 
rumbles up St. Charles Avenue, beyond Canal Street and into the Garden District 
where the homes are beautiful and historic. 
</P>
<P>
I love the Garden District's beveled-glass doors and its enormous oak trees, 
which in sunlight cast cool and inviting shadows and in evening twilight throw 
off shadows filled with mystery. The grandness of the magnificent houses is a 
reminder of the past, since many of them have been here for more than a 
century. I love to ride up the avenue and imagine how it must have been 100 
years ago on a Sunday afternoon . . . the men in formal dress on horseback and 
women in their finery riding in their buggies. If you take the streetcar 
farther up St. Charles Avenue to where the river bends, you'll see an abundance 
of homes with huge windows and wrap-around porches and wonderful gardens where 
people held hands, where marriage was proposed and fabulous parties were given. 
It's a glimpse of a past of gracious living. 
</P>
<P>
The other side of Canal Street, the side I live in and love the most, begins 
with one of the most historic areas in America -- the French Quarter, or, as we 
say, Vieux Carre. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as you enter the French Quarter, your senses are steeped in the past. 
The buildings differ architecturally and are very beautiful to look at, but 
they're mysterious, too. They're so close together, they seem to screen you 
out, keeping their secrets locked inside themselves. Yet if you peer through 
the cracks of some of the gateways, you'll glimpse beautiful gardens behind the 
buildings and quarters where slaves used to live and work. And everywhere are 
graceful wrought-iron balconies hung with plants and flowers, filling your eyes 
with their beauty. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the old bars in the French Quarter have been home to great jazz for 
years; now as you walk past, you'll hear a variety of music -- from jazz and 
soul to rock, Cajun and zydeco -- and most of it is terrific. 
</P>
<P>
When you pass some of the restaurants in the French Quarter, the tantalizing 
aromas will just knock you over: wafts of onions frying, of steaks blackening, 
of huge pots of crawfish and shrimp boiling in their spicy seasonings. 
</P>
<P>
I love Jackson Square, where local artists will paint your picture and street 
performers will amuse you. In the middle of the square is a statue of Gen. 
Andrew Jackson on horseback, and behind the statue, St. Louis Cathedral. The 
cathedral is splendid by daylight, but my favorite time to see it is at night 
when, sitting on a bench, I watch the fog roll in off the river and over the 
city, shrouding the top of the steeples of the church in its mystery. 
</P>
<P>
Across tthe square, I can smell the biegnets frying as I drive down Decatur 
Street in my truck on my way to work. Beignets are our doughnuts -- puffy 
pillows covered with clouds of powdered sugar -- which are served with cups of 
thick New Orleans coffee and chicory. This beignet shop, Cafe du Monde, has 
been here for years, and I know I can drop by any time -- whether at noon or 3 
o'clock in the morning -- because it never closes. The smell of the beignets 
and their taste are overwhelmingly wonderful, and whenever I'm there I remember 
how when I was a kid I used to go there with my buddies and we'd blow the 
powdered sugar at each other. 
</P>
<P>
Mixed in with the old, there's a lot of the new. The Jackson Brewery, which was 
built around the turn of the century, closed in the '70s and was renovated, 
filled with trendy stores and boutiques and reopened a few years ago. Along the 
riverfront, just on the other side of Jackson Brewery, is a streetcar line that 
runs along the river. The streetcar is old, but it will take you to the 
aquarium that's being built -- an exciting step for the future -- so you feel 
the old and the new together. And when I watch the beautiful Mississippi River 
roll by with its river boats and cargo ships, I always think about the people 
so many years ago, taking the ferries back and forth across the river. 
</P>
<P>
Just a little farther down Decatur Street are two stores side by side -- 
Progress Grocery and Central Grocery. Each has been run by its own family for 
many years and both have marvelous products -- imported cheeses, dried fish, 
cold cuts, herbs and spices, and sandwiches such as the muffaletta. The 
muffaletta , originally created by Central Grocery, is one of our most famous 
sandwiches: a gigantic delight loaded with cold cuts and cheese and olive 
salad. The top bread is very thick, so I always ask them to leave that part 
off, cut the rest in half and put the two halves together. That way I get a 
muffaletta that's almost solid cheese and meat and crunchy pickled vegetables . 
. . and delicious. 
</P>
<P>
A block or two from here there's a wonderful jazz club called Storyville and 
when you walk by, it's like walking into history. Listening to the sounds that 
roll through its doors, you can't help but envision great musicians from the 
past, such as Louis Armstrong, Professor Longhair and others who have helped 
raise the pulse of this city with their emotional musical beat. And today you 
might go by and hear an artist like Dr. John or Alan Toussaint playing there. 
</P>
<P>
Right across from Storyville is the French Market where you can buy fresh 
fruits and vegetables, and its flea market, where you can get all sorts of 
trinkets and leather goods. 
</P>
<P>
All this can be found in one small part of one street: Decatur Street. But the 
French Quarter -- and New Orleans -- is so much more. You can find wonderful 
shops selling antiques and all kinds of beautiful jewelry and exciting things 
that are unique to the area, like Mardi Gras headdresses and masks made of 
beautiful feathers and sparkles, old plantation dolls and -- more mystery -- 
voodoo dolls. 
</P>
<P>
As I'm sure you know, New Orleans is really noted for its food, and the variety 
and quantity is endless. We have wonderful neighborhood restaurants where you 
can still get a great meal for $5 or $6, and we have great world-class 
restaurants, which have produced some of the top cooks and chefs in the world, 
and where you'll pay $30 or $40 for a meal. And then there are so many 
restaurants in between -- some that do jazz brunches and others in quiet 
corners of hotels. 
</P>
<P>
The hotels themselves tell all about the city once more, because although we 
have some of the best and highest-ranked hotels in the world -- class and 
comfortable hotels with good art on the walls and spacious rooms -- we also 
have some of the country's oldest hotels, whose buildings are a part of the 
rich history of the city. These hotels are usually filled with priceless 
antiques and have beautiful gardens and old brick courtyards, balconies and 
fountains. 
</P>
<P>
I could go on and on, it's so exciting for me to be able to tell you about my 
city. I guess you can tell by the way I've described it that I'm in love with 
it. And what's so wonderful is that New Orleans has a unique way of giving love 
back to you. There's no other city that I've ever been to that fulfills the 
promise of what it offers so gracefully and with such abundance, with its music 
and its food; with sights and sounds that are bound to make you happy.

<P>
THAT POEM OUT OF CHILDHOOD swirled into mind when I first saw Malaysia, 
slipping down from the sky upon the island of Penang. Instant tropics; instant 
poetry; all the cliches of palm-fringed beaches, sapphire seas, and the natives 
are friendly: I fell in love. 
</P>
<P>
There's something antic about Malaysia, from Sarawak and Sabah, the lands below 
the wind on Borneo, to the northern tip of the peninsula in Perlis--a paradise 
(in my mind), a land similar in size to New Mexico, nudging Thailand on the 
north, looking across the Straits of Malacca and the Java Sea to Indonesia on 
the south. The capital is Kuala Lampur; the people are mainly Malay, then 
Chinese, then Indian. And this, I should add, has been declared Visit Malaysia 
Year. 
</P>
<P>
The real Malaysia is a kaleidoscope, shifting in color, in meaning. Now see the 
fresh, almost 21st-century face of K.L., surely the most architecturally 
stunning city in Asia. Sun, shadow: Ponder the green depths, the oldest jungles 
on the planet, where lemurs still leap and gibbons chatter in the trees. Sip 
gins-and-tonic at ye olde English E&amp;O Hotel in Georgetown, Penang; play 
squash at the Hyatt Kuantan; feast on satay and nasi padang or hold your nose 
and bite the odiferous, addictive durian. 
</P>
<P>
Buy batiks or Selangor pewter or Kelantan silver. Watch Wayang Kulit, the 
ancient shadow-puppet theater; shoot the rapids in a longboat on Sarawak's 
Skrang River; hike to the summit of Mt. Kinabalu in Sabah, loftiest peak in 
Southeast Asia, and ogle the world's largest plant, the Rafflesia; slip down 
through multi-hued, warm waters at Pulau Tioman. 
</P>
<P>
But Malaysia is only one tile in the vast mosaic of Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
In Singapore: Visit the new-old Empress Place Museum; pray for the Raffles 
Hotel to reopen soon; dine (eat, actually) at Banana Leaf Apollo and Newton 
Circus carpark; dine at the Shang Palace at the Shangri-La; skip Tiger Balm 
Gardens but not Jurong Bird Park; shop. 
</P>
<P>
In Bangkok: Take an expansive dinner outdoors at Chit Pochana downtown and 
lunch at the Oriental Hotel's more expensive version across the Chao Phrya 
river after a visit to the legendary Jim Thompson's House (now a Museum). If 
you can see only one temple complex, make it the Royal Palace at the Wat Phra 
Keo. 
</P>
<P>
In Manila: Don't miss the Bayanihan dinner show in the Maynila Room of the 
Manila Hotel; visit Intreamuros, the beautifully-restored Spanish walled city; 
shop for all your summer clothing at Tesoro's or one of its branches. 
</P>
<P>
In Jakarta: Inspect the National Museum and then leave for Jogjakarta; have 
nasi goreng for breakfast at the Ambarrukmo Palace; detour to Borobudur, the 
largest, most amazing Buddhist temple in the world. 
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong: Take salmon and champagne in the lobby of the Peninsula; 
breakfast in your room at the Regent; ride the new tram to Victoria Peak and 
lunch at new Peak Restaurant. Then a ride on the Star Ferry sets a mood of 
romance. 
</P>
<P>
Wherever you wander, breathe in the magic that is Asia, which old hands insist 
should include a journey by hydrofoil between Hong Kong and Macao -- that 
ancient Portuguese enclave where intrigue is rife along busy streets and in 
acient temples and fortunes are exchanged in casinos with a roll of the dice 
and the spin of the roulette wheel, day and night.

A ROLLS-ROYCE IS EARL GREY TEA AND WEEKENDS AT ASCOT AND ALL THINGS BY ROYAL

ONLY ON THE HIGHWAYS, BYWAYS AND MOTOR WAYS OF ENGLAND.

o realize that a car has a soul is to accept that it is a creature of habitat. 
Thereupon, there really is no other highway for stretching a Porsche to its 
tiptoes than 200 kilometers of mostly Bavarian autobahn between bookbinding 
Stuttgart and beer-drinking Munich. The throat of a V-12 Ferrari -- a tame 
tenor on the Hollywood Freeway -- somehow, inexplicably, maybe as a trick of 
its heritage, rises to a ripping alto when shaking off Milan and driving the 
Alpine foothills in search of Lago di Como. And a Rolls-Royce . . . well, it's 
forever Earl Grey tea and weekends at Ascot and all things By Royal Appointment 
and a legend that is at its haughtiest and mightiest only on the highways, 
byways and motor ways of England. Not in Scotland, mind you, where England 
continues to be blamed for Emperor Hadrian and his wall. Nor Wales, of course, 
where the Plaid Cymru party still seeks home rule. But in emerald, tweedy, 
fabled, Conservative, drafty, thatched, humorous and unhurried England, where 
the Rolls-Royce was born in 1905 as "the new all-British motor car" of C. S. 
Rolls &amp; Co. and where this rolling thing of steel and walnut, rubber and 
leather remains an icon. 
</P>
<P>
"I would endorse that," agrees Gillian Hepworth, speaking for Guy Salmon Car 
Rentals, firmly established renter of Rolls-Royce to visiting Americans. "A 
Rolls-Royce is so very English. It is not a car you race down the autobahn. You 
drive it in stately fashion, and there is no statelier country for doing that, 
than England." 
</P>
<P>
A Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit rented from Guy Salmon of London costs $800 a day. 
Or about $4,900 a week. Or $19,000 a month. Plus insurance and an enormous 
Value Added Tax of 15%. 
</P>
<P>
Avis also rents the Silver Spirit for a mere $700 a day -- or $24,900 for a 
29-day rental which includes, bless 'em, comprehensive insurance and unlimited 
mileage. 
</P>
<P>
In its 1905 catalogue, the 11-car Rolls-Royce line (entry level then being a 
two-cylinder Tonneau for $600) was introduced as "a model of accurate and 
scientific construction . . . the most perfect and luxurious car . . . fast, 
silent, vibrationless." 
</P>
<P>
It still is. 
</P>
<P>
In 1905, the company's showroom was at 14-15 Conduit Street near fashionable 
New Bond Street in London's West End. 
</P>
<P>
It still is. 
</P>
<P>
In 1933, Sir Henry Royce died, the color of the famed and entwined RR emblem 
went from red to black in mourning, and a young delivery driver and factotum 
named Roger Cra'ster started working for the company. 
</P>
<P>
He still does. 
</P>
<P>
"The classic truth of the Rolls-Royce is that it is the magic of a name," 
Cra'ster says. "And it still is." 
</P>
<P>
We were in his office above that first showroom on Conduit Street. He produced 
tea in bone-china cups. We exchanged schools, spoke an update on the Los 
Angeles Cra'ster had known as a Rolls-Royce representative in the '50s, and 
then explored that mystique of his marque. 
</P>
<P>
It has to do with aristocracy implied. "The inference is that if you are in a 
Rolls-Royce, you are at least influential," Cra'ster explains. "Of course, if 
you're worthy of a Rolls-Royce it's an entirely different matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember once driving around a Royal Air Force station. The guards on the 
gate saluted me. I drove around this highly secret station and nobody stopped 
me. And I couldn't have done that in any other car." 
</P>
<P>
To a bred-in-the-bone motorist, such challenges are irresistible. I proposed a 
trial marriage. Rolls-Royce accepted. For seven days, it was agreed, my charge 
would be a Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit, all Wedgwood blue, all magnolia-cream 
leather, all snootiness. 
</P>
<P>
We drove its world; from the Dorchester to the Savoy, from chic pubs in 
Belgravia's mews to the empty Cotswolds and antique stores of Regency 
Cheltenham. 
</P>
<P>
Cra'ster was correct. At the wheel of a Rolls-Royce, the unworthy assume 
influence. It's like marrying old money. If you admired it in the first place, 
you quickly want to become it. So the actor in all of us starts to dress the 
Rolls-Royce part (gabardine blazer and a Burberry raincoat are excellent form 
when driving the car during daylight hours; but no tank tops and Andy Capp 
cloth hats, old boy, and act the part (one searches for full-service stations 
because no Rolls-Royce owner pumps his own four-star petrol) and eventually, 
inevitably, totally, one becomes swallowed by the game. 
</P>
<P>
Do both sides play? Of course. 
</P>
<P>
At the Savoy, in a pouring rain, in a car-clogged forecourt, at lunchtime, the 
doorman waved Lady Wedgwood and me through irritable traffic to his front door. 
Cabdrivers said nothing. Fords and Vauxhalls moved over. They knew their place. 
You feel like a lord. Or a pit bull. 
</P>
<P>
"Just leave her with me, sir," he said. "She'll be here when you get out." 
</P>
<P>
She was -- with a fresh newspaper on the front seat. 
</P>
<P>
At Harrods, with the rain now a metropolitan monsoon, we were allowed to triple 
park. A green-and-gold commissionaire holding a green-and-gold umbrella opened 
our door. He was our cover and interference to the green and gold store. "About 
an hour, sir?" "Yes, about an hour." Exactly 60 minutes later, the car slid 
from nowhere to the store doorway where we had been waiting for nine seconds. 
</P>
<P>
It is said that the Denver Boot -- that impregnable clamp and imported 
conqueror of red-zone and parking ticket scofflaws -- was not designed to 
imprison a Rolls-Royce tire. Or tyre . I did not challenge that. But in sedate 
Cheltenham, the premise of one law for the poor, one law for the Rolls-Royce 
owner, was fully tested. The curb was clearly marked. No parking. But I stopped 
there anyway, directly behind an Austin Mini. The traffic warden eyed the 
Rolls-Royce. 
</P>
<P>
"Going to be long, sir?" 
</P>
<P>
"About 30 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
"Don't be much longer, sir." 
</P>
<P>
He continued writing a ticket for the Mini. 
</P>
<P>
But this was fluff. I was allowing Cra'ster's Theory that a Rolls-Royce will 
rise above its driver. Not only that, I was groveling before this vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Enough. We would see if this product of the late and Honorable Charles S. 
Rolls, MA, once a racer of cars, former holder of world speed records and flier 
of airplanes, had evolved as thoroughbred automobile or Mayfair fop. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, no Silver Spirit is a Corvette. Too heavy and not aerodynamic enough. 
Its broad track and long wheelbase preclude nimbleness. Too much of everything 
at slow speeds in tight quarters make any maneuver an end result of calculating 
all the options. But as a cruiser of motor ways . . . ah, even in this age of 
shaky superlatives, the Rolls-Royce motorcar is consummate. At 80 m.p.h. she's 
only flexing. At 100 her legs are ready. At 130, its indicated apogee on a 
deserted stretch of the M1 nearing Leicester at dawn, the Rolls speeds flat and 
stable. Wind and engine noise are a subdued second to Count Basie and "April in 
Paris" on the tape deck. Whether a Rolls-Royce simply holds its own or munches 
BMWs, Jaguars or Mercedes is a matter of choice. The car can do it. Can you? 
</P>
<P>
Lady Wedgwood and I finally found each other on an innocent secondary road 
leading from Marlborough to the Wiltshire village of Aldbourne. It was a dark, 
clear night on an empty road of stern macadam, and there was a full, earned 
respect between car and driver. A string of red lights ahead formed into a road 
construction site abandoned for the day. Fluorescent cones formed a detour, and 
a driver's mental computer took it all in: Two lanes wide, a fast, flat, 
sweeping left-hander followed by a straight, full-bore exit. 
</P>
<P>
No sweat. Balance the car with a touch of brake and a feather of throttle. 
Enter the left-hander fast, looking for the apex and exit as one. There they 
are. I clipped the apex, dove for the exit and had it made . . . when a rumble 
and a jink said that everything, suddenly, was very wrong. The curve, dammit, 
had been set with a negative camber, a banking sloping down from the apex of 
the turn. In a microsecond, the weight of the Rolls-Royce, more than two tons, 
had shifted to the outside of the car and the turn. The geometry was a tangle. 
She was ready to slide. 
</P>
<P>
Only one thing to do. Drive the Rolls like a Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
I flicked the steering a notch to shake the center of gravity loose from 
somewhere over the rear passenger door handle. Felt the weight settle. 
Straightened up the front end. Quick, ease on power and hope there's enough 
torque in this duchess to restore balance, direction and control. It worked. We 
came out from the cones like Emerson Fittipaldi. A Rolls-Royce had behaved like 
a real car. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, at London Airport, I turned the car back to a genial, polite, Tom 
Murphy, the car's venerable handler and silent sufferer of all those who drive 
her. I stared a goodby at the car. I'd beaten it. For one moment on a dark back 
road in Wiltshire, I had been the absolute master of this Rolls-Royce. I swear 
the car sneered. But then it had seen my final clumsiness and knew. 
</P>
<P>
I hadn't yet learned to step out of a Rolls-Royce as if I owned it.

Strange story. CBS cancels "Beauty and the Beast," the greatest show on TV. 
</P>
<P>
Then it puts on an extremely lame show called "Grand Slam," which had worse 
ratings than "Beauty." Then the network cancels "Grand Slam" and decides to air 
half-hour comedy shows in its place. Will they ever learn?

Billy Wilder's 1959 classic may just be the funniest movie since the advent of

The great 1954 Akira Kurosawa classic stars Toshiro Mifune as one of seven

THIS 'SOUTH' WON'T RISE AGAIN

<TEXT>
<P>
One of the biggest disappointments for so many of us was to discover that the 
miniseries "North and South" was not being continued. The potential for an 
immensely romantic and historically significant series created around the Civil 
War era and the nation's recovery would have advertisers beating down the 
network's doors!

 Actually, a sitcom based on "A Family for Joe" is in production. Look for the 
show under that title or "Regular Joe" on NBC sometime this spring.

MEASURING A GOOD SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Writers Guild of America appreciates good writing, whether or not it 
surfaces on a major network. Proof is the WGA nomination of "Measure of a Man," 
a beautiful script by Melinda M. Snodgrass for "Star Trek: The Next 
Generation." Now perhaps those behind the Emmy nominations will recognize the 
simply exquisite acting of Patrick Stewart, as well as the talents of the other 
people responsible for this fine series, one which consistently presents 
entertaining drama with comedic touches.

'DR. CALIGARI' IS OUT OF CABINET AND ON ITS WAY; 
</P>
<P>
LOW-BUDGET, LIMITED-RELEASE FILM MADE IN A FULLERTON WAREHOUSE IS ESTABLISHING 
A LOYAL FOLLOWING ALONG THE CULT-MOVIE CIRCUIT

<TEXT>
<P>
In the world of big-budget Hollywood movies, success or failure usually is 
defined in millions of dollars, and pronounced within days of release. 
</P>
<P>
"The Hunt for Red October," the Cold War submarine thriller, filled seats in 
more than 1,600 theaters and did upwards of $37 million in business during its 
first two weeks. Conversely, the cop flick "The Last of the Finest" sold less 
than $600,000 in tickets its first weekend, and quickly was branded a bomb. 
</P>
<P>
Cult movies reside at the opposite end of the film spectrum. Usually made for 
less than it costs to advertise an average Hollywood release, these films 
depend on word of mouth, limited art-house release and, in the best scenario, 
extended runs as midnight movies. Success depends on attracting a loyal core of 
fans, and builds slowly. 
</P>
<P>
It is at this level of the film biz that the Fullerton-based makers of "Dr. 
Caligari" believe they have found their niche. Having garnered some glowing 
reviews at festivals and in a limited release in Orange County theaters (The 
Times' Kevin Thomas called it "the work of true visionaries"), the movie has 
started open-ended runs as a midnight movie in Los Angeles, Sacramento, Phoenix 
and now Corona del Mar, as it gradually makes its way to art houses across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"Word of mouth is great. I would say it's reached the stage of being a cult 
film already," says the movie's producer, Joseph Robertson, maker of such '60s 
B-movie camp classics as "The Slime People" and "The Crawling Hand." 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Caligari," completed last year, is a kinky updating of the silent German 
classic "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari." It stars Madeleine Reynal, a top 
Argentine model in her American film debut, as the granddaughter of the asylum 
owner in the 1919 original. The new Dr. Caligari runs the asylum now and 
conducts bizarre hormonal experiments on her patients, who range from a 
nymphomaniac housewife to a mass murderer who gets a sexual charge out of 
electroshock therapy. 
</P>
<P>
The movie is the brainchild of Gerald Steiner, an Anaheim Hills resident who 
owns a Fullerton video duplication business. Deciding to make a movie of his 
own, he financed the project out of his own pocket to the tune of $750,000, and 
converted an empty warehouse at his business, next to the Fullerton Airport, 
into a sound stage where the entire movie was filmed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a horror buff," Steiner explains. "I've always loved the old films." One 
of those old films was "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari," and Steiner says he got 
to wondering: "What if they made it today, with color?" 
</P>
<P>
After connecting with Robertson, he approached Stephen Sayadian with an offer 
to write and direct. Sayadian made his mark in cult-movie circles with "Cafe 
Flesh," which mixed scenes of hard-core pornography with an offbeat premise 
about a post-nuclear society where most of the survivors cannot enjoy intimacy 
without becoming violently ill. So instead, they gather at the Cafe Flesh to 
watch staged sex acts by the few remaining "sex-positives." 
</P>
<P>
Made in 1982 for $90,000, the film foreshadowed the then-nascent AIDS epidemic 
and was a big hit on the midnight-movie circuit, playing at the Nuart in Los 
Angeles for three years. Sayadian, a Los Angeles resident, admits some surprise 
at the Orange County connections in the evolution of his new film: "When I 
think of Orange County," he says, "I think of the Meese Commission." 
</P>
<P>
Sayadian says he was particularly taken aback by Steiner's decision to test 
market the movie in Orange County malls. "To me, that was like handing out 
vintage Motown records at a Klan rally," the director says with a laugh. "When 
this movie doesn't work for an audience, it's painful to watch." He recalls 
some screenings for studio executives that were met with stony silence: "It was 
so quiet you could hear a career drop." 
</P>
<P>
Steiner explains that he figured malls would help bolster the word-of-mouth 
campaign -- and he claims that the movie didn't do badly. But its natural home, 
he admits, is elsewhere: "It is a specialty film. It has to go to art houses. 
It's not really a mall film." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, while the mall crowd has been conditioned by the splatter-flick likes 
of the "Fridaythe 13th" and "Halloween" series, "Dr. Caligari" is a different 
beast altogether. Its minimal sets, highly stylized dialogue and acting, 
eccentric sexual fixations and overall outre approach probably would put off 
hormone-driven teens in search of a good old-fashioned bloodletting. And the 
older "Driving Miss Daisy" crowd would likely be totally baffled if not 
offended. 
</P>
<P>
When Sayadian got the "Dr. Caligari" assignment, he brought along Jerry Stahl, 
his writing partner from "Cafe Flesh" and the stage play "Jackie Charge!," a 
tale of voyeurism. Sayadian "does the pictures and I put the words to them," 
Stahl says. "It's like working with Salvador Dali." 
</P>
<P>
Stahl's often obtuse dialogue helps give the film a clipped, angular rhythm 
that matches its minimalist visual style. "When you have all interior (shots), 
the only place you can go outside is in the dialogue," Stahl says. 
</P>
<P>
Working on such projects as "Cafe Flesh" and "Dr. Caligari" gives Stahl an 
opportunity to break with his "day job" -- television work on such shows as 
"Moonlighting" (where he was a staff writer),"thirtysomething" and "ALF." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real chance to be schizophrenic, if you're writing 'Moonlighting' with 
one hand and 'Dr. Caligari' with the other," says Stahl. "As far as I'm 
concerned, writing 'Moonlighting' is surreal. Writing 'Caligari' is normal." 
</P>
<P>
The "Caligari" script required intricate and fast-paced staging, triggered by 
verbal cues. Rather than smooth, naturalistic acting, it called for an 
exaggerated style -- and Sayadian came up with a series of distinct, rigid 
poses. To save money (Sayadian had $300,000 of the total budget to actually 
make the movie) the writer and director drew up detailed storyboards of each 
scene before going into production. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sayadian says, Steiner and Robertson were kept largely in the dark. 
"I don't know if they knew exactly what they were getting until they got to the 
set," he says. But Steiner "never stopped writing the checks, so I figured we 
were still in business." 
</P>
<P>
"We gave them carte blanche to do what they wanted to do," Steiner agrees. 
</P>
<P>
While Sayadian selected his crew largely from past projects -- Mitchell Froom, 
who did the music for "Cafe Flesh," repeated his role for "Dr. Caligari" -- the 
casting was done through open auditions. Then there was a month of intense 
rehearsal before the cameras started to roll. The film was shot in another 
month -- August, 1988 -- entirely within Steiner's warehouse-turned-sound 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
After eight months of editing and other post-production tasks, the film was 
ready for release but, Steiner admits, he wasn't sure how to go about that. One 
studio expressed interest in the film, he says, but finally he decided to 
distribute it himself. 
</P>
<P>
While a wide release may have gained more money in a shorter time, opening the 
film slowly in specialty houses has its advantages. Advertising costs are 
minimized, and a limited number of prints is needed -- only a dozen copies of 
"Dr. Caligari" exist. 
</P>
<P>
The movie -- which landed a 13-page spread in the underground magazine Film 
Threat -- already has been shown in a number of western cities and is set for 
openings soon in San Francisco, Providence, R.I., Minneapolis, Chicago and 
Washington. Scheduling a New York run is next on Steiner's list of priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Steiner says he is close to completing a video distribution deal, with release 
scheduled for Halloween. He says the film's limited theater release will help 
recoup the film's costs; the video sale will account for any profits. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the film makers are moving on to new, separate projects. 
</P>
<P>
"I think 'Caligari' is just scratching the surface," Sayadian says of what he 
and Stahl want to do. They already have written their next movie and are 
working to arrange the financing. The script is based loosely on their play, 
"Jackie Charge!" Sayadian is hoping for a bigger budget this time around. "It 
was fun doing this picture," he said of "Dr. Caligari," "but films of this low 
budget, I don't think I have the stamina to do this anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Steiner, who quotes even the few bad reviews of "Dr. Caligari" with glee, has 
enjoyed his first taste of film making and is ready for his next one. He and 
Robertson, too, have written a new film together and are nearing a deal to 
finance it, with Robertson directing. 
</P>
<P>
The project, to be done on Steiner's sound stage and on location in Anaheim, is 
called "Auntie Lee's Meat Pies." Its dark humor is more than suggested by the 
title. "I could never be part of a film that's lukewarm," says Steiner, whose 
office is hung with props from his first film foray. "It has to be striking." 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. Caligari" is shown Saturdays at midnight at the Port Theater, 2905 E. 
Coast Highway, Corona del Mar. Information: (714) 673-6260.

AGAINST BIG-BUDGET-FILM GLUT, THE ROAD TO CULT STATUS IS ROCKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"It's not the norm to get pictures of this budget released, not to mention 
reviewed in the mainstream press," says Stephen Sayadian, director and 
co-writer of "Dr. Caligari." 
</P>
<P>
Lots of movies are made for low budgets -- $750,000 in the case of "Caligari" 
-- but most go straight to video, if they are seen at all. The glut of 
big-budget Hollywood releases keeps most others out of the theaters. 
</P>
<P>
"To get a 'Caligari' out there and noticed in a world of 'K-9' and 'Turner and 
Hooch' is an uphill battle all the way," Sayadian says. 
</P>
<P>
Sayadian made an earlier cult-movie splash with "Cafe Flesh." That first 
success, he now admits, was largely an accident. This time, he knew how to 
connect with the midnight-movie crowd. 
</P>
<P>
The trick, he said, is to make a movie stand out. People who call "Dr. 
Caligari" non-commercial miss the point, according to Sayadian. "That fact that 
it's so off the wall is what makes it commercial. It actually, for a film of 
that budget, is quite commercial and quite visible." 
</P>
<P>
"Rocky Horror Picture Show," still playing as a midnight movie almost 15 years 
after its release, has long since proved that there is an audience for films 
outside the Hollywood mainstream. "People appreciate film makers who put 
themselves on the line, and they can sort of detect when they care about their 
work and they don't go for the straight commercial hit," says Danny Peary, the 
New York-based author of a series of cult movie compendiums. 
</P>
<P>
Cult movies, says Peary, are "different from the crowd. They break from the 
Hollywood assembly line, and audiences appreciate that." 
</P>
<P>
Peary's definition of cult movies takes in everything from such studio releases 
as "Harold and Maude" or even "It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World" to offbeat 
low-budget offerings such as David Lynch's "Eraserhead" and Sayadian's own 
"Cafe Flesh." 
</P>
<P>
"These are the films people have emotional attachments to. They are 
word-of-mouth films," Peary says. "People will not only see the films again and 
again, but they'll bring new people with them." 
</P>
<P>
While it can be difficult to predict which movies will become cult favorites, 
Peary says many are controversial when released. "It's when there's 
indifference that you realize there won't be a cult for the movie." 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Caligari," as it happens, can cite noble lineage in its quest for cult 
success. Peary's nomination for the first cult movie ever is the original "The 
Cabinet of Dr. Caligari," which played in one Paris theater for seven 
consecutive years. RICK VANDERKNYFF

RANDY LEWIS: APPLAUSE FOR DANCERS' ATHLETIC TURNS DENIES GREAT BALLET A 
SPORTING CHANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Randy Lewis 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Let's do a little brainstorming about art and sports. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, I think we could get a lot more out of theatergoing if we treated 
a play more like a baseball game: If the lead actor was turning in a hollow, 
unconvincing portrayal of, say, Hamlet, we could hoot and holler abusively 
until the director phoned down to the bullpen for a reliever. On the other 
hand, if the actor was doing a particularly great job, we could cheer at each 
line, and even launch "The Wave" to rally emotion. 
</P>
<P>
Or . . . 
</P>
<P>
Think how much more entertaining an evening of chamber music could be if a 
string quartet was treated like a mixed-doubles tennis match, complete with 
play-by-play announcer: 
</P>
<P>
"Kicking off today's Brahms Quartet Invitational, violinist Imogene 
Daintydigits serves up the declamatory theme of Opus 51 No. 1 with a smash to 
violist Carl Slackjaw! Slackjaw parries nicely, adding a wicked topspin to the 
theme before rifling it back to second violinist Gunther Gutplucker! His shot 
sends Gutplucker reeling back to base line. . . . He's stumbling, seems to be 
in trouble. . . . Wait -- Ho-ly Toledo! -- Gutplucker's grabbed it and sends it 
back to cellist Marta Kniesaparte as a countermelody -- brilliant move!" 
</P>
<P>
Too unsophisticated? Probably. So why is it that audiences always seem to 
respond to ballet as if it were an ice-skating or gymnastics competition? 
</P>
<P>
Watch what happens every time a ballerina does a series of pirouettes circling 
the stage. As sure as a chorus line of leg kicks in a musical brings the house 
to its feet, you'll hear a cheery ovation. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to fault ballet-watchers for wanting to demonstrate appreciation for 
a dancer's skills -- but only up to the point where that demonstration 
interferes with the work itself. Too often, when applause breaks out in the 
middle of a section or scene, instead of at the end, it does interfere. 
</P>
<P>
It's an irritation that is not restricted to Orange County, though I suspect 
that it's more exaggerated here because of our status as relative neophytes, 
and sometimes we're guilty of overzealousness in trying to stake out a place in 
the world of High Culture (consider our faux pas of applauding between 
movements of a symphony). But these nasty habits may subside with a little more 
time and experience. 
</P>
<P>
TV shares a large part of the blame. With prime-time Olympic competitions 
constantly telling us how "balletic" a certain ice skater is, or how 
"artistically" Irina Gymnastovich jumps over the parallel bars, today's 
audiences become conditioned to look for nothing more from ballet than supermen 
and women who are able to leap tall partners with a single bound. 
</P>
<P>
The great ballets deserve more consideration. 
</P>
<P>
In sports, the dazzling physical feat is an end to itself. The criteria for 
selecting music that accompanies ice skating and gymnastics routines rarely 
extend beyond finding a song with a rhythmic pulse that suits the athlete, or 
something from the latest hit show by Andrew Lloyd Webber. 
</P>
<P>
In ballet, especially in the works of the master choreographers, it's the 
opposite: The dancers' athletic prowess is merely a tool, as most big-name 
choreographers design ballets to illustrate, reflect, interpret or enhance the 
music they have chosen. 
</P>
<P>
Take a work like Balanchine's "Theme and Variations," which American Ballet 
Theatre performed last week at the Orange County Performing Arts Center: This 
isn't a simple compendium of applause-seeking leaps, spins and lifts, all tied 
together with a hummable Tchaikovsky soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
As he did so often, Balanchine "saw" the music in physical terms. With the 
flick of a wrist, the straightening of a leg or the turn of a dancer's head, he 
translates the spirit of Tchaikovsky's melodies, countermelodies, harmonies and 
rhythms into visible relationships, providing each component of the music with 
its own physical personality. A great ballet like this lets the audience 
understand the music even better -- if they're not so busy applauding the trees 
that they miss the forest. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the moves, of course, are quite breathtaking, as when one of the male 
principals crosses the stage diagonally with a series of long, bold leaps. But 
the problem with random applause through a piece like this is that it obscures 
the music and, worse, obliterates (for the rest of the audience, anyway) the 
umbilical connection between dancer and music for the next several idolatrous 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Such interruptions mute the cumulative emotional impact we might feel if the 
scene could continue to develop, instead of disintegrating into a series of 
hoop tricks. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe instead of seeking sports-type thrills and chills when we go to the 
ballet, we could truly get more out of it by stopping first to think about 
what's happening behind the calisthenics. Or better yet, stop and dare to 
feel.DR, Steve Lopez

QUICK TRIP ON FRENCH TGV HAS O.C. PANEL UP TO SPEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Racing through the verdant French countryside toward Rennes Saturday, Orange 
County Supervisor Don R. Roth got to fulfill a fantasy -- announcing the 
blistering speed of 186 m.p.h. to several hundred passengers aboard France's 
TGV, the high-speed Train a Grande Vitesse. 
</P>
<P>
He was thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the greatest experiences of my life," Roth announced over the 
train's intercom. 
</P>
<P>
The French National Railroad, which wants to build and operate a similar rail 
line between Las Vegas and Anaheim, had found a way to top its competition, the 
West Germans. It let Roth sit in the cab next to the engineer. 
</P>
<P>
And Roth is a key person to impress because he is the vice chairman of the 
California-Nevada Super Speed Train Commission, the panel that hopes to make a 
final decision later this year about which kind of train to pick. 
</P>
<P>
Roth and eight other members of the 16-person commission rode the French train 
in shifts Friday and Saturday as part of a 10-day "technology tour" aimed at 
examining the French and German competitors up close. On Wednesday, they rode 
West Germany's magnetically levitated high-speed train. 
</P>
<P>
The commission is paying $20,000 for members' expenses on the tour, but spouses 
and an entourage of 25 Orange County business executives and their spouses have 
paid their own way. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's 233-mile jaunt took only two hours and four minutes. According to 
the Orange County passengers, the experience made Amtrak look like a throwback 
to the age of steam locomotives. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there were mixed reactions. 
</P>
<P>
"It just glides out," said Brian Pearson, manager of planning and projects 
development for the Orange County Transit District. "It was the most pleasant 
train ride I've ever had by a long shot." 
</P>
<P>
"It's smoother than a limo," said Robert Carley, senior vice president of 
Robert Bein, Wm. Frost &amp; Associates, an Irvine engineering firm. 
</P>
<P>
While the train was proceeding on new tracks designed for high-speed service, 
there were lots of oohs and ahs among the American visitors. But then the train 
hit a large section of old track, and swaying increased dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting queasy," said Jim Erickson, a lawyer from San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
"On the maglev I felt more secure," said Aram Keith, president of Costa 
Mesa-based Keith Engineering, referring to the German train. 
</P>
<P>
The French train's coaches are narrower than those used for the maglev vehicle 
in Germany but they are much heavier. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to compare the two," said Buck Johns, a Newport Beach real estate 
investor who has purchased land near the proposed Las Vegas-Anaheim train 
route. "Maglev was on a test track and this is in the real world . . . but I 
think I prefer the maglev ride because it was smoother." 
</P>
<P>
"Both of them are state-of-the-art as far as moving people is concerned," Roth 
added. "On the new track, the French train gives maglev a very good run for the 
money." 
</P>
<P>
That's what French National Railroad officials wanted to hear him say, because 
until then Roth had been leaning strongly toward the maglev. 
</P>
<P>
After a separate trip on Friday, commission members Nick Horn of Nevada and 
Angie Papadakis of California also praised the French train. 
</P>
<P>
But Horn said he was concerned about a briefing that he attended with other 
commission members during which French railroad officials failed to answer some 
key questions to his satisfaction. He raised such issues as the French train's 
inability to handle steep grades in mountainous terrain, financing difficulties 
and the lack of a specific manufacturing schedule if France wins the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked them where we were on their priority list, and I never did get a 
straight answer," Horn said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Papadakis praised the French train as "very luxurious" and said it 
provided a "wonderful" ride. 
</P>
<P>
"I can just see that if everyone in America could experience this ride, they 
would love trains. I think there is room for both the French and German 
technologies in America," she said. 
</P>
<P>
French officials argue that their train has a proven record of carrying 
millions of passengers each year at a profit while the West Germans still have 
their maglev confined to a test track. 
</P>
<P>
They also have statistics showing that their train has reduced the growth in 
automobile traffic on parallel French highways and has cut in half the number 
of passengers using airlines along the same corridors, thus reducing the need 
for service at crowded airports. 
</P>
<P>
There are 105 French high-speed trains in service on several routes, all built 
on time and on budget, according to French officials. 
</P>
<P>
But such success does not come easily. French wine makers continue to object to 
high-speed trains cutting across their fields, with some arguing that the 
trains' vibrations harm their vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
French officials have studied the vibration problem and have even tunneled 
under one vineyard, but the farmer involved is still not satisfied, officials 
said. Also, France's activist Green Party, which concerns itself with the 
environment, has become more worrisome and bothersome, said Claude Constant, 
director of international cooperation for the French National Railroad. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, for example, the Green Party forced the railroad to relocate a 
pond to protect frogs. 
</P>
<P>
And the Green Party, along with a group of homeowners near St. Arnoult 
Enyvelines, outside Paris, forced officials to construct a concrete sound wall 
next to the tracks even though they had never objected to a much noisier, 
heavily congested highway closer to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wants the train service," Constant said, "but they say, 'Not in my 
garden.' " 
</P>
<P>
French officials say their high-speed model is quieter at 270 m.p.h. than a 
conventional train is at 100 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
But there are some who are skeptical, possibly including Roth. 
</P>
<P>
"It remains to be seen," he said Saturday, "whether the French train can 
survive the environmental problems it is likely to encounter in California." 
</P>
<P>
While the French train ride is more comfortable than that of a conventional 
train, some passengers -- even Parisians interviewed Saturday -- said they 
object to their ears "popping" every time the train goes through a tunnel at 
high speed. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that the speeding train compresses the tunnel's air in front of 
it, changing the pressure in the inner ear. But others said it was no worse 
than the same popping experienced on an airplane. 
</P>
<P>
"I take the train to Rennes almost every weekend," said Jean Amburgey, a banker 
whose fiance lives in Rennes, about 250 miles from Paris. "I much prefer the 
train because it is so convenient." 
</P>
<P>
The fare is about $100 for a round trip. 
</P>
<P>
The French, however, are used to using trains. Within the Paris area, for 
example, about half the commuters use public transit, mostly trains, including 
the Paris Metro. The commuter rail service is so cheap -- less than $1 per day 
for unlimited use -- it is virtually free by American standards. 
</P>
<P>
Said Paris transit spokesman Cyrille de La Faye: "In Paris, a politician who 
doesn't work for better public transport will lose his job." 
</P>
<P>

Facts About The TGV 
</P>
<P>
The TGV is a high-speed train made by the French firm GEM Alsthom. It can reach 
speeds of nearly 300 m.p.h. and has carried more than 100 million passengers 
since entering service n 1981. The main TGV line runs between Paris and Lyon. 
Additional lines in other parts of France are now being added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pros 
</P>
<P>
-The TGV has a proven track record in commerical service. 
</P>
<P>
-It is non-polluting. 
</P>
<P>
-Capital costs are less than West German's experimental magnetic-levitation 
train system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cons 
</P>
<P>
-TGV cannot take steep grades. 
</P>
<P>
-It uses more energy than the maglev train. 
</P>
<P>
-It requires extensive earth removal for tracks to be laid. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The steel-wheel train, which runs on electicity, can travel on conventional 
railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
TGV stands for Train a Grande Vitesse, or high-speed train. 
</P>
<P>
In order to keep the train stable at high rates of speed, the traction motors 
are suspended from the chassis, reducing strain on the tracks. TGV is also 
equipped with three different brake systems that allow the train to stop at 
high speeds.

CELEBRATION: THOUSANDS OF IRISH AND NON-IRISH ALIKE MARK THE SAINT'S DAY WITH 
STEP DANCERS, BAGPIPERS, A PARADE AND PLENTY OF IRISH BEER.

<P>
At an Irish pub in Seal Beach, they celebrated St. Patrick's Day with an 
old-fashioned wake of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
An open casket was laid out across the bar's pool table, and dozens of people 
stopped in to sneak a peek at the coffin. Inside was a stuffed doll wearing a 
bumper sticker that said, "Kiss me, I'm Irish." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a comic thing. It's not meant to be morbid," Irisher Pub owner Robert 
Campregher said of the ghoulish St. Patrick's Day tradition. "I had to stick a 
bolt through his neck, though, because last year some people stole the head and 
wouldn't give it back." 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in Orange County, thousands of Irish and non-Irish alike donned 
bright green and pinned shamrocks to their lapels Saturday to celebrate St. 
Patrick's Day with step dancers, bagpipers, a parade and plenty of Irish beer. 
</P>
<P>
It was the most popular day of the year to be Irish. If you weren't, it was 
good day to fake it. 
</P>
<P>
Several leprechauns -- or at least small children dressed up as Irish imps -- 
were spotted on floats inching along Olympiad Road in Mission Viejo. There, 
high school bands and homecoming queens, clowns, equestrians, baton twirlers, 
politicians, youth groups, floats and motorcades of classic cars -- even 
Irish-made Deloreans -- paraded for two hours before enthusiastic green-clad 
onlookers. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, revelers flocked to area pubs to party. The Guinness and Budweiser 
were flowing, sometimes dyed green just for the occasion. After a few beers, 
jolly strangers became instant buddies, old-timers reminisced about the old 
days back in Ireland and dancers clicked their heels and twirled each other 
about in reels. 
</P>
<P>
On this particular day, Kay Grimm, 58, was not answering to anything but Kay 
Fitzgerald McMillen, a combination of both her Irish parents' surnames. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the one time of the year when I can go out and find my roots," said 
Grimm, a real estate appraiser, flashing a sticker that read, "Whiskey makes me 
frisky." 
</P>
<P>
She added: "I like to come out and appreciate being Irish." 
</P>
<P>
Grimm was among hundreds of celebrators who poured into the Harp Inn, a popular 
Irish pub in Costa Mesa. There, regulars swapped tall tales, delighting 
first-timers and those who simply came out to rub elbows with the Irish. Irish 
patrons basked in their glory, thickening their brogues to spin yarns between 
mouthfuls of corned beef hash and cabbage. A few Irish immigrants huddled 
together at the bar and tried to persuade one of their buddies to say a few 
words in Gaelic. 
</P>
<P>
A few snickered when they caught wind of the words of a song that Annie Murphy, 
an Irish-American, was belting above the roar of the crowd: It was a woman's 
lament that her husband had changed for the worse after their marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Niland, 44, had apparently done his share of kissing the Blarney stone. 
Niland, a cabinetmaker from western Ireland, was full of the gift of gab, 
entertaining a small crowd with a steady stream of ghoulish jokes. 
</P>
<P>
"In Ireland, whenever someone dies we get together to celebrate the poor 
devil's death," said Niland of Huntington Beach. "We always say, a good wake is 
better than a bad wedding." 
</P>
<P>
Others raised their glasses to an old Irish toast: "May you be in heaven an 
hour before the devil knows you are dead." 
</P>
<P>
The revelers came from Oregon, New York and as far away as London to celebrate 
St. Patrick's Day with friends in Orange County. Many weren't even Irish. "I 
come here every St. Patrick's Day because they just don't celebrate it in 
England and Ireland like they do here," said Clive Collins, 29, of London. 
</P>
<P>
"Even in Ireland, they'll have a couple of drinks, but it's not as 
commercialized as it is here."

<P>
Moving On -- The first wave of the spring bird migration is under way in Orange 
County, with swallows, swifts, hummingbirds and hawks at the vanguard of the 
huge avian movement. 
</P>
<P>
Five species of swallow and two species of swift were seen last week during an 
Audubon field trip to Yorba Regional Park in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Three types of swallow -- cliff, northern rough-winged and barn -- nest 
locally, but their numbers have been augmented by birds migrating from points 
farther south. Also spotted were large numbers of migrating violet green and 
tree swallows. 
</P>
<P>
Shore birds and ducks that have wintered in local estuaries, meanwhile, are 
getting ready to head north to their breeding grounds. Endangered California 
least terns, which breed locally, are expected to arrive in April. 
</P>
<P>
Land birds that spent the winter in the county are starting to move around. So, 
according to Sylvia Gallagher of the local Sea &amp; Sage Audubon Society, 
birds that spent the last few months in a yard across town "might turn up in 
your yard now."

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: WHADDYAMEAN, 'AWESOME'? GIVE HER BRONX CHEER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY MARCANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like a lot of reporters, I sometimes have this image of myself as one of those 
thick-skinned sorts who isn't fazed by anything. But on a visit to Mater Dei 
High School on Tuesday, a student said something that left me flabbergasted. 
</P>
<P>
My next-to-last stop in my daylong series of interviews was in Tanya 
Reminiskey's seventh-period journalism class. I asked students about Mater Dei, 
and I invited them to question me. One student asked where I attended high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Bronx," I replied. 
</P>
<P>
Olivia, a student in the front row, blurted out, "That would be so awesome!" 
</P>
<P>
I was aghast. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you say going to school in the Bronx would be awesome?" I had to ask the 
question to make sure I hadn't been struck deaf or possessed by demons. 
</P>
<P>
Olivia must have been taken aback by the tone in my voice, because she didn't 
say anything. A student seated behind her, a guy named Tyson, came to her 
defense. "Well, maybe for a day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For the sake of Tyson, Olivia and every other student and alumnus of Orange 
County schools, let me set the record straight -- there are many words in the 
king's English to describe going to school in the Bronx. "Awesome" is not one 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
Consider this: When I left New York City four months ago, students at many high 
schools were being let into school one at a time. That's because it's tough to 
squeeze two kids through a metal detector at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Things weren't quite that bad when I attended Harry S. Truman High School in 
the mid-'70s. In fact, Truman was considered one of the more attractive schools 
in the Bronx. It was new, a seven-story testament to learning, with air 
conditioning, state-of-the-art facilities and even a swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
It was also two bus rides away from where I lived. But that wasn't so bad. I 
remember a couple of my friends from the neighborhood who had to ride a bus and 
two trains to go to school. 
</P>
<P>
The bus trips were long, but they could be thrilling at times. I remember 
transferring to the QBX-1 bus at Tremont Avenue and Bruckner Boulevard one 
morning and seeing my science teacher slumped down in his seat. I thought he 
was dead. Turned out he was just hung over. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the afternoon when about 500 homeward-bound students tried to 
board a bus made for 80. Fearing for his life, the driver climbed out the 
window and fled. A student jumped into his seat, intent on ferrying the 
passengers home. I don't know what happened next. I had fled too. 
</P>
<P>
Think about that the next time you're car-pooling. 
</P>
<P>
Now I suppose there are some similarities between schools in the Bronx and in 
Orange County. The kids are about the same age. And maybe lunchroom shakedowns 
of loose change and Scooter Pies happen here too. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the California traditions of alfresco lunchrooms and junior varsity 
baseball in February, students in the Bronx did, and still continue to, 
experience a boundless joy that Orange County kids will never know. 
</P>
<P>
Snow days. 
</P>
<P>
They were a veritable heaven on Earth. For kids, it was nirvana -- impassable 
roads, few cars and padlocked school gates. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, Orange County kids will never know the feeling of anticipation that 
descends on 8-year-olds as they huddle before the radio at 6:30 a.m. listening 
to the school-closing announcements. On one such morning, my glee was unbridled 
when the announcer intoned, " . . . in District 8, P.S. 100 . . . " 
</P>
<P>
After the announcements, two sorts of cheers went up in New York households -- 
kids' cheers, and Bronx cheers. The kids' cheers would arise, obviously, from 
kids. The Bronx cheers would arise from parents. 
</P>
<P>
For those of you who don't know what a Bronx cheer is, stick out your tongue 
and blow real hard. You've just heard a Bronx cheer. 
</P>
<P>
On snow days, my mother, like multitudes of others in New York, would promptly 
wrap me, my brothers and my sister in 18 layers of clothing and dispatch us to 
the snowbound streets. I hate to gloat, but playing in the snow is something no 
kid should miss. 
</P>
<P>
On my block, where there was a large hill, and in parks throughout the city, 
snow days meant trash-can-lid sleds and cardboard-box toboggans. The best ones 
were refrigerator cartons -- you could get about 14 kids on them. Problem was, 
the maniac kid on the block always wanted to steer. 
</P>
<P>
So with Maniac Kid at the helm, we'd go plummeting down the hill, shrieking -- 
usually something to the effect of, LOOK OUT FOR THE TREE! Looking back, I 
imagine the sight of 14 kids crashing into a tree and flying through the air, 
arms and legs wriggling, must have been pretty funny. 
</P>
<P>
Hurt, you say? Fuhgeddaboudit, as they say back home. Snow is soft. It's also 
cold and wet. And nothing felt better than going home, soaked to the skin and 
chilled to the bone, and warming up with a mug of hot chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
So I guess I should apologize to Olivia. She was right. On snow days in the 
Bronx, going to school -- or not going to school -- was indeed awesome.

RULING REVIVES RANCH DEVELOPMENT ISSUE;

CITY ELECTION: A VICTORY AT THE POLLS BY PROJECT OPPONENTS MIGHT ENDANGER THE 
PROPOSED 329-HOME HELLMAN PLAN IN SEAL BEACH.

<P>
A court ruling may make the proposed Hellman Ranch housing development the No. 
1 issue in the March 27 election to fill two City Council seats. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday a Superior Court commissioner, ruling that the city's housing plan 
was outdated, sent the controversial proposal back to the City Council for 
rehearing and a new vote. 
</P>
<P>
The council approved the hotly contested plan last October. It remained 
uncertain whether a second vote can be taken before two new council members 
take office. Incumbents Victor Grgas and Joyce Risner, who voted for the 
proposal, are not seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
An election victory by development foes could threaten the proposed 329-home 
development, which critics charge would harm the environment and quality of 
life in the beach community. 
</P>
<P>
Half of the eight candidates vying for the two council seats said they are 
dissatisfied with the development plan, and another, a project supporter, said 
Saturday that if elected he would take another look at it. 
</P>
<P>
Current council members who backed the Mola Development Corp. proposal insisted 
Saturday that they intend to approve the project again. They said they were 
certain that the matter will come to the council before the end of their terms 
May 15. 
</P>
<P>
The long-running Hellman Ranch issue appeared settled before Friday, but Orange 
County Superior Court Commissioner Ronald L. Bauer invalidated the development 
plan, saying permits were issued using a section of the city's general plan 
that had not been undated as required by law. 
</P>
<P>
"When it comes back to the council, it's going to be a whole new show," said 
candidate Joe Rullo, who believes that the Hellman plan will be amended before 
being resubmitted. 
</P>
<P>
Rullo, a supporter of the development, is one of five candidates running for 
the District 1 seat held by Grgas. He has served two terms, the maximum allowed 
by the city's charter. 
</P>
<P>
Three candidates are vying for the District 3 seat held by Risner, another 
two-term lame duck. 
</P>
<P>
Both Grgas and Risner were part of the 4-1 majority that approved the project. 
The two open council seats make possible a shift to a 3-2 majority against the 
development. 
</P>
<P>
"The plan now is to win enough council seats so that when the Mola proposal 
comes back through town, we can take a fresh look at it," said Galen Ambrose, a 
candidate in District 1 and the co-founder of the Wetlands Restoration Society, 
the Seal Beach-based environmental group that won its suit in court Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Growth has traditionally been a hot issue in Seal Beach, where some residents 
make the maintenance of a village atmosphere a high priority. The city was the 
site of a bitter 1988 campaign over a strict slow-growth measure that 
ultimately lost at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the development plan insist that it does not properly address 
environmental concerns and that it will increase traffic, pollution and even 
crime in the town of 26,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Ambrose -- and to a lesser degree, other candidates in the race -- have 
centered their campaigns around the issue of growth and the detrimental effects 
that they see it having on Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Seal Beach is in a crisis and needs strong leadership as massive developments 
go through that will change our city," said Ambrose during a recent candidates' 
forum. "Is the city of Seal Beach going to sell itself like a whore to the 
first person who comes in with a checkbook?" 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the Mola development say the plan adopted by the council is far 
better than the original proposal. The original plan for 773 dwelling units was 
reduced to a plan for 329; and 41.4 acres -- roughly a third of the site -- are 
set aside for wetlands restoration. 
</P>
<P>
But at an election forum last week, the most common reason candidates gave for 
supporting the Mola plan was that it was "a done deal." 
</P>
<P>
"There will be some kind of a development there. People have property rights," 
said Grgas, who is backing Rullo in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"If the (new council) votes 3-2 to close it off . . . the taxpayers are being 
exposed to a great risk of liability." 
</P>
<P>
But Dennis Pollman, a District 1 candidate who supported the Mola plan, said 
Saturday that if elected, he would reopen discussion of development to gain 
more public input. 
</P>
<P>
"The only question left is how the public feels," Pollman said.

COUNTY STUDENTS MISS THE CUT IN JUNIOR HIGH MATH COMPETITION

The pencils were down, the tests collected and eighth-grader Laura Dietz sat 
recovering Saturday afternoon from Mathcounts, an all-day mathematics 
competition for California junior high school students. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I'm doing so well so far," said Laura, who attends Serrano 
Intermediate School in El Toro. "It's like, two things in a question and if you 
mess up on one, you're dead. They're real hard." 
</P>
<P>
She and 146 other junior high students from Southern California took several 
tests Saturday at Cal State Fullerton to find the top math student in the 
state. An identical competition was held simultaneously at St. Mary's College 
in Moraga for Northern Californians. 
</P>
<P>
When the winners were announced later in the afternoon, none of the 13 Orange 
County entrants had placed in the top four to garner a place on the state team. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Shih, 12, from Malaga Cove Intermediate School in Palos Verdes, placed 
No. 2 in the statewide competition, making him the only student from Southern 
California to qualify for the team that will go to the nationals. The three 
other top scorers were all from Northern California schools -- first-place 
winner Sean Trekhler from Palo Alto, E. Frey from Oakland (tied with Shih for 
second) and Arthur Shek from Carmichael (third place). The California team will 
go on to compete May 18 in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Mathcounts, sponsored by the National Society of Professional Engineers, is 
aimed at showing students that math can be fun, said Cliff Ishii, a Cypress 
engineer and state director of the competition. The sponsors hope that by 
getting junior high students interested in math, they will continue taking math 
and science in high school and college and become engineers. 
</P>
<P>
Before the final scores were announced, Eric Weiss, an eighth-grader from 
Rancho San Joaquin Middle School in Irvine, said he hoped he wouldn't score in 
the top 10. Top scorers had to go one-on-one in a videotaped quiz round with 
the other top students. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting sick thinking about it," he said, shortly after eating a 
hamburger. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County students competing Saturday qualified for the statewide event 
after winning a countywide contest in February. Four-member teams from Serrano, 
Rancho San Joaquin and La Paz Intermediate in Mission Viejo outscored all other 
county schools. 
</P>
<P>
An eighth-grader from Los Alisos Intermediate School in Mission Viejo, Jae Lee, 
14, participated Saturday as an individual because he was the top-scoring 
student in the county. 
</P>
<P>
During the competition, students received questions in a series of rounds. The 
first round hit them with 30 questions that had to be completed in 40 minutes. 
The second round subjected them to questions given in pairs with eight minutes 
to solve them. 
</P>
<P>
The questions were designed to test knowledge that junior high math students 
would typically be exposed to, said Joan Gell, a math teacher at Palos Verdes 
High School who helped write the test, which is being used by all students 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
A sample question: Jack and Jill are siblings. Jill has twice as many brothers 
as sisters. Jack has the same number of brothers as sisters. How many children 
are in the family? 
</P>
<P>
As each round began, competitors flipped over test booklets at speeds 
approaching Mach 1. Then brows furrowed and erasers were chewed as the 
basketball game timer on the wall ticked away the seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"One careless error and you get a handshake instead of a trophy," said Beverly 
Mairs, the coach from Malaga Cove Intermediate School. 
</P>
<P>
The contest is meant to be competitive, Ishii said. But the real goal of the 
event, besides having fun, is to increase the number of engineers in the 
country, he said. 
</P>
<P>
His company recruits about half of its engineers from outside the United 
States, he said, mostly from Korea. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not seeing the kids (in the United States) take the math at the level 
they need," he said. "We need to encourage them because we need more home-grown 
talent." 
</P>
<P>
After the contest was over, Michael D. Cowan, chairman of the Orange County 
chapter of Mathcounts, posed a final math question to all those within earshot: 
</P>
<P>
"How do 147 kids go through 200 hamburgers and 236 candy bars when they were 
allowed only one each?" 
</P>
<P>
Carole Jackson, the math coach for Irvine's team, beat him to the punch line. 
</P>
<P>
"They have two hands," she said. "That's an easy one. Ask any junior high 
school teacher."

MOTORIST DODGES ERRANT DRIVER, RAMS CHP CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Oceanside man swerving to miss a car that cut in front of him Saturday night 
rammed the back of a California Highway Patrol car parked on the side of 
Interstate 5 near the Camino de Estrella exit in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
CHP Sgt. William Kelly said both the officer and the driver were taken to a 
local hospital, but neither was seriously injured and would probably be 
released. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly said the unidentified officer was stopped by the side of the road doing 
paper work when he was struck from behind. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, Ronald W. Radkovich, 45, said he was on his way home to Oceanside 
at 8:30 p.m. when he tried to evade a car that swerved into a lane in front of 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to get away from the other car. . . ," Radkovich said. "I hit my 
brakes, and I didn't see the (CHP car)." 
</P>
<P>
Radkovich's Cadillac was a total wreck and the rear of the CHP car was 
destroyed, Kelly said.

DIVISION III: MARUSICH, STAPLETON LEAD FRIARS PAST HAYWARD MT. EDEN, 67-51, FOR 
THEIR FIRST STATE BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP.

<P>
Servite High School's new-found shooting touch gave the Friars their first 
state basketball title Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Friars, shooting barely 50% in the playoffs, shot 71.4% from the field (25 
of 35) in a 67-51 victory over Hayward Mt. Eden in the State Division III boys' 
basketball championship game at the Oakland Coliseum Arena. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first state basketball title for the Friars, who won eight of their 
last nine games to finish 21-11. Mt. Eden ended the year 28-8. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Marusich, Servite's 6-foot-7 center, scored 21 points, but it was the 
three-point shooting of guard Paul Stapleton that helped the Friars pull away 
in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot senior scored 12 of his 20 points on four consecutive three-point 
baskets in the second quarter. Servite led, 36-29, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Marusich was nine of nine from the field and Stapleton made seven of 13 shots, 
including six of 10 three-pointers. Jamie Rosenkranz added 12 for Servite and 
Mike Singleton led Mt. Eden with 11. 
</P>
<P>
Stapleton's six three-pointers broke the Division III championship game record 
of four set last year by Trabuco Hills' Randy Kriech. 
</P>
<P>
The record came as a surprise to Stapleton. He was shooting only 33% from the 
field for the season, and in several games he didn't even attempt a 
three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been such a bad shooting year for me, so it's hard to believe doing 
this in the finals," Stapleton said. "In warm-ups, I couldn't get a rebound so 
I took only four shots. I made one of them." 
</P>
<P>
Said Servite Coach Richard Smith: "Paul sacrificed some games this year. He 
didn't get to shoot at all in some games when we went inside. That's been our 
theme all season, to keep pounding it inside." 
</P>
<P>
Servite didn't stray from its game plan early. Marusich scored 10 points, on 
layups and short jumpers, as Servite built a 19-18 first-quarter lead. 
</P>
<P>
"Marusich killed them inside in the first quarter," Smith said. "We made them 
adjust and we came back with Paul. With that combination going, I don't know 
what any team can do to stop them." 
</P>
<P>
Servite spread its offense in the second quarter in an attempt to keep 
Marusich, who had two fouls, in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to take some time off the clock," Smith said. "We wanted Steve back 
in the locker room with only two fouls." 
</P>
<P>
Marusich picked up his third foul 40 seconds before halftime and was whistled 
for his fourth with 5:51 remaining. He scored nine points in the second half, 
when Servite led by as many as 19. 
</P>
<P>
Before the game, Smith said Marusich "should score 40" against Mt. Eden, which 
doesn't have a player taller than 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised they didn't try to muscle me more," said Marusich, who faced man 
coverage most of the game. "I just kept posting up inside. They played in front 
of me a little in the beginning, then I started hitting a lot of turnaround 
(shots). 
</P>
<P>
"Once they shut us down inside, Paul went to work." 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Eden Coach Ron Benevides said Marusich and Stapleton "were tough to stop." 
</P>
<P>
"Once we adjusted to their inside game then they came back with the other guy 
(Stapleton outside). 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't play well, but a lot of that had to do with Servite. They're a 
well-disciplined team." 
</P>
<P>
And Saturday, the Friars were a good shooting team, too.

THE IDEA FOR a soap-opera boutique bubbled from the brain of 
writer-producer-promoter Dick McInnes, whose soap involvement is legendary: 
He's arranged sea cruises that bring together soap stars and their fans; he 
heads a soap-star softball team, and he hosts his own show, "S.O.A.P.," for 
local radio and public-access television. 
</P>
<P>
The Bubble Boutique has amassed merchandise for the large and avid group of 
soap fans, people of all ages and from all walks of life who find themselves 
addicted to daytime TV serials. 
</P>
<P>
TK-months old, the boutique is the first store in Los Angeles, and possibly on 
the planet, to cater exclusively to the desires and whims of the TV-romance 
audience. All Bubble stock is soap-opera-related -- some of it generic 
(sweaters, T-shirts and mugs inscribed with such heartfelt messages as, "I 
Can't Cope Without My Soap") and some pertaining to specific soaps. A bumper 
sticker reads: "Genoa City, Wisconsin. Population: Young &amp; Restless." And 
"Days of Our Lives" devotees can find the latest book of poetry by MacDonald 
Carey, a cast member since the show's inception more than two decades ago. 
McInnes also promises a continuing lineup of personal appearances by soap 
stars. A bulletin board for soap-opera fan clubs worldwide publicizes events 
and gatherings.

Mix in an outrageous assortment of authentic Polynesian artifacts and a

you got? Silver Lake's Tiki-Ti. Four nights a week, Ray and Mike (the heralded 
father-and-son team) tend bar, creating unique tropical drinks (no beer or 
wine) with names as colorful as the decor. Order a Ray's Mistake (named after 
Ray, of course, who started the bar in 1961 and created most of the recipes) or 
a coconutty Bayanihan -- a popular selection that's the closest thing to 
paradise east of Tahiti.

VDE IS A word-processing program for people who like their programs lean, mean 
and simple, and that includes people who simply appreciate a clean, 
well-written program as well as those who write on laptop computers that have 
limited disk-storage space. VDE executes all the standard operations necessary 
for writing articles, books or screenplays but uses only 43K of disk space 
(compared to the 500K or more required by many commercial programs). 
</P>
<P>
In spite of VDE's small size (or perhaps in part because of it), VDE is 
blazingly fast. It keeps the entire file in RAM; therefore searches, re-formats 
and block moves are instantaneous. Even the loading and storing of files is 
speedy. And VDE is simple to learn (it mimics WordStar commands but comes with 
an installation program that allows you to program the function keys any way 
you want to. Under VDE, any one file is limited to 80K (12,000 words), though 
you can load as many as eight files in RAM simultaneously and bounce back and 
forth between them as fast as you can tap a key. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike some best-selling commercial programs that cost up to $500, there is no 
charge for VDE if you download it via modem from a bulletin board, and only a 
nominal charge if you get it from a commercial-software library. VDE author 
Eric Meyer of Norman, Okla., issues periodic fixes and updates. A manual on 
disk with the applications file (merely print it out on your printer) is 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 VDE (and Eric Meyer) can be reached via the Glendale Litera bulletin board, 
(818) 956-6164. To download, follow instructions on the bulletin board (VDE is 
stored as a compacted file called VDE15.ARC). Or VDE can be obtained by mail 
from various software libraries, including the Public Software Library, P.O. 
Box 35705, Houston, Tex. 77235.

DIVISION I: O'NEIL'S FREE THROWS IN THE FINAL SECONDS GIVE THE MONARCHS A 62-60 
VICTORY OVER SAN FRANCISCO RIORDAN AND THEIR SECOND STATE CHAMPIONSHIP.

Mater Dei High School capped a banner season with a 62-60 victory over San 
Francisco Riordan Saturday night, winning the State Division I boys' basketball 
championship before 14,629 at the Oakland Coliseum Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Dan O'Neil made two free throws with eight seconds remaining, clinching 
Mater Dei's 26th consecutive victory and its second state title. Mater Dei also 
won the 1987 Division I championship. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't feel good until O'Neil made those free throws," said Gary McKnight, 
Mater Dei's coach. "They're a nasty team that wouldn't let us put them away." 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei (34-1) made 12 of 17 free throws in the fourth quarter to hold off a 
frantic rally by Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neil, playing his final basketball game before embarking on a football career 
at the University of Oregon, finished with 19 points. Andy Karich added 16 
points, including seven key free throws in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the defensive play of forward Charlie Andres on Riordan's 
high-scoring forward, Dwayne Fontana, that was the difference. Fontana, 
averaging 20 points a game, was limited to eight, making only three of 13 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a super defensive effort," McKnight said. "Charlie did a good job of 
denying him the ball. And when Fontana got it, he pushed him out farther, 
forcing Fontana to come up short on his shots." 
</P>
<P>
Fontana, a 6-foot-4 senior who will attend Arizona State, said at times he felt 
as if he was being guarded by all five of Mater Dei's starters as they 
repeatedly helped Andres whenever the ball went inside. 
</P>
<P>
"They shut down the passing lanes, and it was hard for us to get into our 
offense," Fontana said. "Everything I shot wouldn't go in. That's only the 
third time in my career I haven't scored in double figures." 
</P>
<P>
Riordan (29-3) faced an uphill battle most of the game after falling behind by 
as many as 13 points in the first half. Riordan's Dorian Manigo missed his 
opening 13 shots but scored 21 of his game-high 25 points in the second half, 
including a three-point shot with two seconds remaining. The final score was 
the closest Riordan came in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"They did an excellent job defensively," said Ron Isola, Riordan's coach. "We 
usually get 20 points out of Dwayne, and tonight we got eight. They took Dwayne 
away and said go ahead and shoot outside. 
</P>
<P>
"We had two or three chances in the fourth quarter, but over-aggressiveness 
hurt us. We weren't patient at critical times and that really hurt." 
</P>
<P>
McKnight, savoring his 227th victory in eight seasons, said the state 
championship was a tribute to a team that was destined to win it all. 
</P>
<P>
"You know (assistant) Phil Bellomo said before the first day of practice that 
our goal this season should be to go undefeated," McKnight said. "I told him he 
was crazy. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't playing well at the beginning of the year, but when we won the 
Orange tournament, I didn't think we'd lose again. It's a real tribute to win 
nine post-season games, beating nine caliber teams, and win the state title."

Mater Dei High School overcame an early deficit to defeat Servite, 7-4, in the 
Angelus League baseball opener for both teams Saturday at Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei (7-2 and the county's top-ranked team) took the lead for good in the 
fifth inning when Ryan Andersen singled with two outs and took second when the 
right fielder couldn't come up with the ball cleanly. 
</P>
<P>
Jim McCarthy drove in Andersen with a single. "We think we're a good team and 
they think they're a good team and this was the game to show it," Mater Dei 
Coach Bob Ickes said. "Both teams just came out tight and flat." 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 3-1, Mater Dei scored three runs in the third. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth, Servite (5-3), the fourth-ranked team in the county, tried to 
start a rally, but Mater Dei got a double play after Steve Sandoval opened the 
inning with a single. The Friars only had three baserunners after that and none 
advanced past second base. 
</P>
<P>
Servite's Eddie Crippen hit a home run in the fifth to tie the score, 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei's Jason Dietrich gave up two runs in the first inning but settled 
down to get the victory. Dietrich (3-1) pitched five innings, giving up four 
runs, striking out five and walking one. Lionel Hastings struck out two in two 
shutout innings of relief. DENNIS KAISER

Benny Rodriguez, Fullerton's leadoff batter, hit a ground ball to second 
baseman Ted Savage. But Savage's throw to first was wide, and Rodriguez was 
safe on the error. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback went on to commit nine more errors. The 10 errors, all by 
infielders, led to 11 unearned Fullerton runs. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton didn't get its first earned run until Jim Short hit a home run over 
the left-field fence to put the Hornets ahead, 11-1, in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
In the first inning, Fullerton scored five unearned runs. After Rodriguez 
reached base on an error, Willy Speakman singled. Gary Mota hit into a force 
play, but Saddleback shortstop Rob Nye's relay to first base was wild and 
Rodriguez scored. Tom Wilson had an RBI double, Jim Vlcek and Kevin Monson 
added RBI singles, and Fullerton scored another run on a throwing error by 
catcher Ralph Grajeda. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton turned the 5-0 lead over to starter Steve Trachsel, a sophomore 
right-hander. He allowed five hits, striking out four and walking two in seven 
innings to improve to 6-1. Brian Behnke pitched the final two innings. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Savage had two hits, including an RBI double, for Saddleback (7-10, 2-6). 
Saddleback's Eric Cedarstaff (0-6) lasted two-thirds of an inning, allowing 
five unearned runs. 
</P>
<P>
In other Orange Empire Conference games: 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago 12, Cypress 11 -- Tom Acuna hit a two-run home run in the ninth 
inning to pull Cypress within 12-11, but Matt Lackie came in to get the final 
out for host Rancho Santiago (15-5, 6-3). Acuna had two home runs and five 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Floth, Greg Martineau, Steve Grack and Marty Neff hit home runs for 
Rancho Santiago. Neff's homer was his conference-leading 11th and Grack hit his 
seventh. It was Martineau's second and Floth's first. Cypress falls to 12-11, 
1-7. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside 10, Golden West 2 -- Gerad Cawhorn hit a home run for visiting Golden 
West (15-4, 6-3). James Patterson (3-2) got the victory for Riverside (17-6, 
6-3). James Marquez (3-2) took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
In the Golden West softball tournament: 
</P>
<P>
Golden West 4, Pasadena 3 (9 innings) -- Gretchen Bock had a two-out two-run 
single in the ninth for Golden West (20-8). 
</P>
<P>
In the Cuesta swiming invitational: 
</P>
<P>
Mike McNeff won the 200-yard backstroke in 2:01.53 and Bob Bently (2:03.35) was 
second to help clinch the title for the OCC men, who finished with 607 1/2 
points. Diablo Valley (602) was second and Golden West (520) was third. Tony 
Harris won the 500 and 1,650 freestyle also for OCC. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Stansfield won one- and three-meter diving events and Karen Paulitschek won 
the 100 and the 500 butterfly to lead the OCC women with 644 points. It was the 
fifth consecutive time OCC has won the meet.

Two errors in the third inning helped Mater Dei High School defeat Cypress, 
5-1, in the championship game of the Cypress girls' softball tournament 
Saturday night at Arnold Cypress Park. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei's Theresa Conway led off the third inning with a double and, with one 
out, advanced to third on Sandy Mosqueda's infield pop fly. Amy Moeller hit a 
pop fly, but was safe when first baseman Holly Pittenger dropped the ball. 
Conway scored on the error. Jennifer Cline tripled home Moeller, then scored 
when Tracy Rice's single to center was bobbled. 
</P>
<P>
"We made some errors that opened the flood gate for them," Cypress Coach Jim 
Pittenger said. "Take away that one bad inning and it would have been a 2-1 
game." 
</P>
<P>
In the fifth inning, Moeller scored from third on a wild pitch by Beth Howard 
(6-2). In the sixth, Rose Imbuano reached base on an error, advanced to second 
on Conway's infield pop fly and scored on Moeller's single to right-center. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei Coach Kathy Quesnell was pleased with her team's hitting (seven 
hits). "Our girls were cranking the ball over their heads, and Conway, Moeller 
and Cline all hit boomers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Quesnell also praised pitcher Teri Kobata, who maintained her composure despite 
throwing 11 illegal pitches. Kobata had a no-hitter through six innings. 
</P>
<P>
Holly Pittenger led off the seventh inning with a single to break up Kobata's 
no-hit bid. Pittenger advanced to third on an illegal pitch, stole third and 
scored on Liz Moore's fly to right. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei is 5-0. Cypress is 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
In the third-place game: 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove 1, Woodbridge 0 -- Stephanie Smith pitched a one-hitter with 10 
strikeouts for Garden Grove (6-2). Nikia Houston singled, stole second and 
third and scored on a sacrifice fly by Brandie Novack in the second inning. BOB

MAKING SIGHTS FOR SOUNDS: THE ART OF KOSH; 
</P>
<P>
IT ALL STARTED WITH 'ABBEY ROAD.' IN 20 YEARS SINCE, JOHN KOSH HAS BECOME A 
LIVING LEGEND WITH INNOVATIVE ALBUM COVERS FOR POP SUPERSTARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
No, Paul McCartney wasn't dead. Yes, Pete Townshend did urinate in public. 
</P>
<P>
Recollections of a lifetime in rock 'n' roll. . . . John Kosh sits in his 
Hollywood studio on a warm Tuesday morning, speaking in a working-class English 
accent, reminiscing. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the late '60s, Kosh was a young Londoner fresh out of art studies at 
Hornsey College. He was working for the Royal Opera, designing advertisements 
and looking for something better. 
</P>
<P>
"I got this phone call one afternoon and the voice said, 'Hello, this is John 
Lennon,' " Kosh said. "I thought, 'Oh yeah, sure.' I figured it was one of my 
friends talking with a Liverpool accent." 
</P>
<P>
But it really was Lennon, and Kosh found himself enlisted to design a cover for 
the Beatles' "Abbey Road" album. The resulting artwork -- a simple photograph 
of John, Paul, George and Ringo walking across the street -- has survived as 
one of pop music's most memorable images. 
</P>
<P>
In the 20 years since, Kosh has designed covers for Rod Stewart, the Eagles, 
Jimmy Buffett and 10,000 Maniacs. He made The Who look infamously mischievous. 
He made Randy Newman look young again. Linda Ronstadt uses him for all her 
albums, three of which have won Grammys for their artwork. 
</P>
<P>
"He's amazing," Ronstadt said. "An album is real personal and so the cover has 
to be real personal. He understands that. Whatever my fantasy is, he's good at 
making it fit into a design." 
</P>
<P>
At 44, with graying hair and beard, Kosh talks about his job as if it were 
play, as if he'd crashed some party that won't seem to end. He never intended 
to do this sort of work but he's still at it, having moved from England in 1973 
to set up shop amid Los Angeles' record companies. Kosh talks about his career 
like a man who won the lottery. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a whirlwind," he said. "I don't really know how it started or how it 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
It started with "Abbey Road" and the rumor that Paul McCartney was dead. 
</P>
<P>
Lennon called on Kosh because he had seen the young artist's work at the opera. 
The two men met several times. Yoko Ono was keeping Lennon on a macrobiotic 
diet and Kosh used to sneak him cookies. Kosh was soon hired by the Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports of McCartney's demise -- which dated to 1966 -- were 
continuing to circulate. People said he was killed in a car accident and 
replaced by a look-alike. The band, reportedly guilty over concealing the 
death, offered clues on subsequent albums. When the song "I'm So Tired" is 
played at slow speed, Lennon can be heard mumbling "Paul is dead, miss him, 
miss him." At the end of "Strawberry Fields Forever" come words that sound like 
"I buried Paul." 
</P>
<P>
The "Abbey Road" cover fueled more rumors. The band was pictured in a 
funeral-like procession. McCartney was out of step, dressed in black and 
barefoot. A nearby car bore the license plate "28 IF," supposedly meaning that 
he would have been 28 had he survived the 1966 crash. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a series of coincidences," Kosh said. "The photo session didn't 
take more than an hour or two. We paraded them back and forth across the street 
and the photographer kept shooting. At what stage Paul lost his shoes, I don't 
know. He just took them off at some point." 
</P>
<P>
Such coincidences may have been staged by the band as part of a running gag. 
Kosh pleads ignorance to any such plot, though he admits that Apple Records was 
deliberately vague on the matter and instructed him not to deny any McCartney 
death rumors. 
</P>
<P>
Fact or fiction, the album sold millions of copies and the commotion brought 
particular attention to its cover. 
</P>
<P>
By 1971, Kosh followed up with "Let It Be" and The Who's infamous "Who's Next." 
Again he produced a simple picture -- the band standing around a giant concrete 
block they appeared to have urinated on. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid they did," Kosh said. "You know how Englishmen drink beer. We were 
all drinking a lot that day so there was constant urination going on. 
</P>
<P>
"The joke was that the movie '2001' had just come out with that obelisk and we 
found an obelisk out in the middle of nowhere. It was a piling for a freeway 
overpass they were building. What better thing to do than go and (urinate) on 
it?" 
</P>
<P>
Such images linger. They elevated Kosh to lofty status among rock 'n' roll 
musicians and artists. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a legend, a living legend," said Tommy Steele, art director for Capitol 
Records. "He's one of the guys that, well, we all saw his work as we were 
coming up." 
</P>
<P>
Kosh demurs. He says his early photo sessions were guided by whimsy, his 
technique no more than "wonderful naivete, trying anything and everything." It 
was a time, he recalls, when the unpredictable likes of Lennon, Jagger and Moon 
ruled London's music scene. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just being outrageous. Everything was going so fast that you didn't 
have time to sit back and take notice of what you were doing." 
</P>
<P>
Beer and naivete notwithstanding, certain formulas govern album design. There 
are four basic categories: a simple photograph like Carly Simon's "Playing 
Possum"; an elaborate set like "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"; an 
illustration such as Led Zepplin's first album; or a logo, as on every Chicago 
album. 
</P>
<P>
Or, these elements may be combined. 
</P>
<P>
Certain marketing strategies come into play. Some musicians need their faces on 
the cover to forge an identity with the buying public. 
</P>
<P>
"ELO, for instance, wasn't a particularly photogenic band," Kosh said. "They 
needed a logo." 
</P>
<P>
The image is the key, and the image must be strong because an average shopper 
browsing through the racks will glance at a cover for two seconds, industry 
executives say. 
</P>
<P>
"The record cover should draw the eye," said Jeff Adamoff, vice president of 
creative services at MCA Records. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is creating an image," said Steele, of Capitol Records. "We're 
image makers." 
</P>
<P>
Images are Kosh's forte, and his reputation has grown steadily with three 
Grammys and three more nominations. He now works with the help of artists Larry 
Brooks and Amy Dakos. They have settled in a small studio in Crossroads of the 
World, an odd office complex on Sunset Boulevard fashioned like a ship. 
</P>
<P>
Musicians and record companies seek out this place, wanting to commission a 
Kosh cover. The record companies have market-related ideas for the artwork; 
musicians have their own vision. 
</P>
<P>
"You get very vain musicians who only want their picture on the cover," Kosh 
says. "I was hired to do Rod Stewart's 'Blondes Have More Fun.' He wanted to 
dress up in full Nazi regalia. I didn't want to do that, so I got my marching 
orders." 
</P>
<P>
Ronstadt asks for specific colors on her covers. For the "Get Closer" album, 
which won a Grammy, she wanted polka-dots and Kosh's wife, Marjory, found a 
polka-dot dress for her to wear. Randy Newman brought in childhood photographs 
to sift through for his "Land of Dreams" album. 
</P>
<P>
Next comes the music. Kosh visits the studio to hear the band. If he can get a 
tape, he drives with the car stereo playing. 
</P>
<P>
All this preparation leads to brainstorming sessions between Kosh and his 
co-workers. They may come up with an illustration. They may decide to use the 
band's existing logo. 
</P>
<P>
Adamoff recalled the time he was a free-lance artist competing against Kosh for 
Chicago's 16th album. He was agonizing over how to use the band's familiar logo 
in a fresh way. Kosh -- facing the same dilemma -- decided to print the logo on 
a microchip. He then photographed a magnifying glass being held over the chip. 
</P>
<P>
Kosh got the job. 
</P>
<P>
"It was off-the-wall, brilliant," Adamoff said. "I said, 'This guy is great.' " 
</P>
<P>
Even the simplest cover -- a photograph of the band -- can be agonizing. Photo 
sessions drag on for hours. Some musicians are difficult. Others loathe the 
camera. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather dig a ditch," Ronstadt says. 
</P>
<P>
Kosh has tricks. He sets the studio clock back an hour so the musicians don't 
think they have been there so long. With Ronstadt, he plays her favorite 
Neville Brothers album. With Jimmy Buffett, he keeps up a banter of jokes and a 
long-running argument over who is younger. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always used him because he's such a pleasure to work with," Buffett said, 
"and he's older than me." 
</P>
<P>
"Sgt. Pepper's," as one of the first high-cost, concept album covers, is 
credited with acting as a springboard for much of what came after. Suddenly, 
record companies were willing to spend freely to decorate their products. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles' "Hotel California" -- designed by Kosh -- cost $27,000 for 
photography alone. For Rod Stewart's "Foot Loose &amp; Fancy Free," Kosh built 
a life-size, watertight hotel room and flooded it. 
</P>
<P>
"We were going to put him on the bed with a pair of shoes floating in the water 
and masses of steam floating out the bathroom door," Kosh said. "So the first 
day, he didn't show up. The second day, he didn't show up. The third day, he 
showed up and said 'Nah, I don't like that idea.' He left me sitting on $10,000 
worth of set." 
</P>
<P>
The cover ended up as a simple photograph of Stewart walking along Mulholland 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
A reputation for expense follows Kosh. Set construction and photography for his 
covers cost anywhere from $5,000 to $15,000 or, on occasion, much more. That is 
not unusual in the record industry. But, as one of the top names in town, he 
commands an additional design fee of $5,000 to $15,000 per cover. 
</P>
<P>
Such expenditures are crucial to record companies. Compact discs and cassette 
tapes, which rule the market, are smaller than albums. Design must compensate 
for lack of space. In the old days, Kosh might have opted for shock value. 
</P>
<P>
"That law of upsetting mothers -- if the mother hates the cover, the kids will 
buy the album," he said. "But I'm getting too old to go out and be deliberately 
offensive anymore." 
</P>
<P>
He'd rather use an artistic approach. And it occurs to Kosh that he has been 
pretty successful as an artist. Just about anyone who owns a stereo has some of 
his work. There are Kosh prints in millions of homes around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all been by accident," he said. "I'm just a cockney kid who came around 
at the right time when London street kids were turning the world upside down."

ART NOTEBOOK: ANCIENT, ARCHITECTURAL, CONTEMPORARY TRIO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The triptych, it seems, is ubiquitous in art these days, so it's about time 
someone staged an art exhibition that is itself a kind of triptych. The trio of 
exhibitions currently on view at the art galleries of Cal State Northridge is 
such an event. It juxtaposes a show of some 60 ancient Greek vases from the 
local collection of Hanita and Aaron Decter with an utterly contemporary neon 
and adobe rumination on Ulysses by the Pasadena artist Jan Sanchez. "Odyssey" 
travels by way of earthen constellations lit with electric stars, past a temple 
of Zeus with crumbling adobe columns and a neon core -- and through a colorful, 
pulsating Hades, as gaily surreal as a miniature golf course. At one point in 
the journey, a doorway opens to the third element in the triple-header: Steven 
Appleton's provocatively hung architectural fragments from demolished Los 
Angeles industrial buildings, which take on an almost archeological antiquity 
next to the other two shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Three exhibitions at CSUN Art Galleries, 18111 Nordhoff St., Northridge. (818) 
885-2226. Through March 30. Open noon to 4 p.m. Monday; 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
Tuesday through Friday; special Saturday hours March 24, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
</P>

 MULTIPLE MOSES: Welcoming accident, chance and "magic" in his work, Ed Moses 
has long been an artist whose hallmark is experimentation. An intimate glimpse 
into that process, in all its revealing trial and error, is provided by a show 
of some 30 artist's proofs and trial prints by Moses at the Santa Monica 
Heritage Museum -- which alternates exhibitions of contemporary art with more 
historical themes. Honored as the museum's artist of the year, Moses opened his 
personal archives to the institution. Moses, who does not routinely venture 
into printmaking, calls the work -- which spans the 1980s -- the "fall-out" 
from his experiments with that medium; but with a few exceptions, it's hard to 
peg any of these as mistakes. Explorations is more like it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ed Moses: Works on Paper" through April 1 at Santa Monica Heritage Museum, 
2612 Main St., Santa Monica. (213)392-8537. Open 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Thursday 
through Saturday, noon to 4 p.m. Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 SPANISH EYE: A show of work by the Catalan artist Perejaume at the 
Meyers/Bloom Gallery has turned into a preview glimpse of the 1990 Venice 
Biennale, which takes place in Italy this June. At the gallery opening of the 
Perejaume show, the artist had just learned he has been selected as one of 
Spain's three representatives to the "Aperto," the prestigious invitational 
division of the summer-long international contemporary art fair. 
</P>
<P>
A poetic foreigner whose work looks refreshingly different from that at the 
forefront of current U.S. art dialogues, Perejaume produces clean-cut, 
mixed-media paintings, photographs and installations that often draw on 
classical artists' frames to literally explore the "framing" of perceptions and 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Perejaume, through March 31 at the Meyers/Bloom Gallery, 2112 Broadway, Santa 
Monica. (213) 829-0062. Open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 ARTIST BOOKWORMS: Ever since the 1970s, when artists including Ed Ruscha and 
Claes Oldenburg seized upon the handmade book as a fresh way to produce 
accessible art that was literally off the wall, artist's books have been a 
sideline interest of many art aficionados. Now UCLA is showing a traveling 
retrospective of the Southern California bookmaking arts of the 1980s, 
sponsored by the Los Angeles-based Alliance for Contemporary Book Arts. The 
show includes both artists' books and books made according to vanishing -- or 
emerging -- bookbinding and papermaking arts, with a generous emphasis on 
student work. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Southern California Decade: An Exhibition of Contemporary Books" through 
March 31 in the lobby and special collections department of the University 
Research Library at UCLA. 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Saturday.

CATHERINE WHEEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his review of "Harry and Catherine" (Book Review, Feb. 25), Richard Eder 
writes: "The message -- that if you are truly your own woman, even a manly, 
tender, utterly respectful man with such extras as passion, wit, originality 
and a small but huggable potbelly may not fit -- is not really anti-feminist. 
But it is very mournful." 
</P>
<P>
Human development is distinguished by the quest for autonomy. Men have 
throughout history sought autonomy, and sought it through power-over. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the 20th-Century feminist transformation, women are now seeking 
autonomy, but generally not through power-over. They are seeking it through 
radical independence and generative solitude. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge for Catherine -- of "Harry and Catherine" -- is to affirm the 
"manly," tender, utterly respectful person that is Catherine, with such extras 
as passion, wit, originality and a small but huggable potbelly thrown in. This 
historic venture is not -- from a woman's standpoint -- "very mournful". It is 
deeply celebratory.

NAUTICAL NIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a writer, nothing fazes me more than nit-picking by an editor, or, even 
worse, a reader. 
</P>
<P>
However, as a reader, finding some error usually can make my non-Clint 
Eastwoodian day. 
</P>
<P>
And so, I hasten to submit an error of truly micro-monumental proportions in 
Charles Champlin's front-page review (of P.D. James' "Devices and Desires," 
Book Review, Feb. 25). 
</P>
<P>
He mentions it was Greyhound, the bus company, that had the slogan, "Getting 
there is half the fun." While people generally leave the driving to Greyhound, 
it was the British steamship company Cunard -- proprietor of the Queens, among 
other vessels -- who used that slogan for many years. In fact, they may still 
do so on some of their promotional literature. 
</P>
<P>
I suppose the above only goes to show that there are a number of us who do 
peruse the reviews, to be enlightened, yes; but also to hope to find some 
erratum, or better yet, errata, which can prompt letters like this one.

CROSS EXAMINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his review of "World Almanac Crossword Puzzles From the 1920s" (Book Review, 
Feb. 11) Charles Solomon writes: "No one knows when or where the first 
crossword puzzle was developed. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
It's a well-documented fact that the first modern crossword puzzle was compiled 
by Arthur Wynn for the Fun section of the New York World. The puzzle appeared 
in the Dec. 21, 1913, issue of the paper and was called a word-cross. 
</P>
<P>
The term crossword developed much later. 
</P>
<P>
Crossword puzzles became an immediate fad with readers of the World, but it was 
10 years before other newspapers took advantage of their popularity as 
circulation builders. And it wasn't until 1924 that Simon &amp; Schuster 
published the first book of crossword puzzles, a runaway best seller. 
</P>
<P>
Today, about 50 million Americans are cruciverbalists -- crossword puzzle fans. 
Latin students will recognize the word as a derivation of the words crux and 
verbum, meaning, respectively, cross and word.

has the familiarity of a legendary creature -- the sort you might glimpse 
tangled in ivy leaves on an ancient oak tree, or reflected in a silty black 
pond of unplumbed depths. 
</P>
<P>
She wore a perfectly ordinary blue jumper with a striped cotton shirt and 
gallery-going black lace-up shoes with sturdy soles as she walked across the 
lobby of New York's Regency Hotel. Still, she has a fey air about her, 
suggesting she might wear a cap with tassels and shoes with peaks and bells to 
dance on the green on Midsummer's Night. 
</P>
<P>
The British writer would likely reject, huffily, the suggestion that she is in 
any way related to the Wee People -- she makes a big thing about having left 
her Dublin birthplace for London when she was 9. 
</P>
<P>
Still, at 70, the resemblance is there -- in the short, generous stature, 
heart-shaped face with deeply dimpled chin and hair swirling around her face 
like blond Spanish moss. Certainly those dark blue eyes peer out warily, like 
those of some wild creature of the forest, full of knowledge of burrows and 
barrows and arcane methods of eluding capture. 
</P>
<P>
Hers are not at all like the fox eyes she describes in "The Philosopher's 
Pupil": "cold pale eyes, which were somber and ruthless and sad, awful eyes 
which knew not of the human world." 
</P>
<P>
Or like those of the Philosopher himself, whose "stare was startled and 
disconcerting as if, when he looked at someone, he simultaneously recalled 
something awful which had nothing to do with the person looked at." 
</P>
<P>
The oft-honored novelist was in New York recently: to see the pictures at the 
museums and collections; to receive the National Arts Club's Medal of Honor for 
Literature at a gala in its historic house on Gramercy Park; and to talk about 
her new book, her 24th, "The Message to the Planet" (Viking). 
</P>
<P>
To the black-tie dinner, she went willingly enough. Her speech she wrote in her 
customary precise longhand, crossed out and inserted. 
</P>
<P>
She spoke pleasantly to those who claimed to have read all 24 books and wanted 
her to autograph even their paperback copies. She listened without grimacing to 
master of ceremonies Timothy S. Healy, now president of the New York Public 
Library. And upon receipt of the medal itself, she admired it enthusiastically. 
</P>
<P>
As for being interviewed, well, she's very polite, using the disarming 
technique of questioning the questioner as a way of providing answers of her 
own. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who's read Murdoch would approach her diffidently, worrying about acting 
like one of the pupils or disciples who harass her guru, her holy man, her 
philosopher. 
</P>
<P>
In novel after novel, the seekers hunt him (her divine courier is never a 
woman, nor are her narrators) down. In the new book, the philosopher is Marcus; 
he is "taken for a god," and comes to "symbolize perfect goodness." But Marcus 
is more troubled than enthralled by the exercise of his powers. 
</P>
<P>
"He had discovered that he had magical powers, paranormal powers," she writes. 
"There's a lot of paranormal about," Dame Murdoch said, defending a willed 
death, faith healing and other remarkable events in her new book. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the problems of life is to distinguish between demons, magic and God," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
And then, in her customary defense of turning the questions on the questioner, 
she demanded: "Have you ever met a saint?" 
</P>
<P>
The stunned interviewer racked her memory for a saint but couldn't find one. 
Neither, apparently, could Murdoch. "I have never met a saint. I have met very 
good people, very unselfish -- but the word saint suggests something elevated, 
superhuman. I have met many demons, some beneficent, but still demonic. And I 
have known many very great people in my life, even geniuses -- but never felt 
it a religious matter." 
</P>
<P>
Murdoch believes, she said, in "puzzling things." 
</P>
<P>
But she distinguishes between the "paranormal, poltergeists or furniture flying 
around" -- she thinks such things may well have more to do with powers or 
forces that may be "scientific" -- than the powers obtainable from a spiritual 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to live in Tibet, you can live in South Kensington and still 
undertake religious disciplines to acquire unusual powers. To die by your own 
will, I don't know -- these things always seem to happen more in Tibet than in 
California -- but you never know what goes on in California. 
</P>
<P>
"I have known people who practice Buddhist technique or devotion. I was taught 
Buddhist meditation -- I even once thought of becoming a Buddhist. But 
Christian meditation can lead to unusual forms of life. Being selfless or 
detached from the world is unusual enough -- unusual perhaps because ordinary 
life is so usual." 
</P>
<P>
She still meditates regularly, using a Christian form of a mantra, "but not as 
much as I once did or should. But from the fact that I did it ardently for a 
very long time, something remains. I wish the technique were taught to 
children. It does what prayer used to do. It helps remove oneself to another 
kind of being. You relax; it's not a matter of thought, but you find the things 
that are worrying you, vanities, desires, and you are liberated. It's a kind of 
escape. It does sound pompous, but you soon return to normal." 
</P>
<P>
Murdoch, for all her glimpses of the unknowable (Hier ist Kein Warum -- she 
quotes the saying, "Here is no why"), her aphorisms, her epigrams, her Minoan 
maze plots. 
</P>
<P>
But as high-flown as her prose is, she paces it with the prosaic. She uses 
food, for instance, as she said, "to give a pattern to the day. One of the 
problems of the novel is to make the ordinary life of the character proceed. 
</P>
<P>
"I like reading in books about people eating," she said. 
</P>
<P>
And a reader is always told what people are eating. 
</P>
<P>
"The Message to the Planet" begins with a group of male friends eating "fish 
cakes and boiled potatoes followed by bread and cheese, followed by chocolate 
biscuits." 
</P>
<P>
And they drink so much whiskey and talk about Marcus Vallar so long that they 
have to have brown bread and Cheddar cheese as well. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sea, the Sea," is full of almost-recipes for food -- provided by Murdoch's 
husband, Oxford professor, writer, critic and chef John Bayley. Dame Iris does 
not cook. 
</P>
<P>
"I cooked for a short while after I was married. But I didn't like to cook. 
When my husband saw what an awful cook I was, he took over. He's a creative 
cook -- he could write an interesting cookbook." 
</P>
<P>
She uses other devices to bring her characters to earth. The writer points out 
that Tolstoy, in "Anna Karenina," curses her lover with a toothache while he's 
walking up and down in the cold on the train platform. "It makes you think: 
human life, how awful. The world has collapsed around you -- and you have a 
toothache." She herself has asthma and occasionally plagues her characters with 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Murdoch carefully describes rooms, houses (notably the one in "The Sea, the 
Sea" where eerie faces peered through windows of interior rooms. Her character 
decides, "It was not exactly a sinister or menacing effect, but as if the house 
were a sensitized plate which intermittently registered things which had 
happened in the past -- or, as it now occurred to me for the first time, were 
going to happen in the future"). 
</P>
<P>
She writes every day "all day," when she's not in New York, or California, 
France or Belgium, or running the house or doing the shopping -- "there are 
intrusions, though I'm fortunate enough not to have many." 
</P>
<P>
As you might expect from one who has written 24 books and three plays in less 
than 40 years, she's quite settled -- some might say "sot in her ways" about 
writing. 
</P>
<P>
Amazingly enough, her manuscripts -- pages and pages of her small, neat 
handwriting -- go to her agent or publisher in fat, heavy blue laundry bags. 
</P>
<P>
She always uses the same sort of paper and instruments -- which may sound a bit 
superstitious to non-practitioners of the trade but is common enough among 
writers. She uses the same sort of notebooks to write all her novels, using one 
side of the page so as to leave room on the other for second thoughts. And she 
always "writes with a real fountain pen. It seems to me to be the way to think. 
I can't imagine thinking with a machine between me and the screen. Of course, a 
pen is a machine. But I've never touched a typewriter. 
</P>
<P>
"I had always used blue-black ink, as my father did. I was very much attached 
to my father, a bookish man, a civil servant who was very precise about 
writing. Not long ago, I changed to blue. I'm not sure what it signifies." 
</P>
<P>
Her change of ink is obviously no rejection of her childhood. "I had marvelous 
parents. It's rather an advantage to being an only child. Only in later life 
did I learn that children don't always get along with parents." 
</P>
<P>
To those who speak of the ease of a computer, she says frostily, "I rather do 
my own writing, not let my computer do it. I like to keep my sentences more 
closely on a rein." And indeed, every Murdoch word reads as though 
premeditated. "I have it all in my mind before I begin," she has said. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps this prewriting is the reason she doesn't report the feeling many 
writers (as well as artists, actors and athletes) sometimes have of "going with 
the flow" -- automatic writing or plugging in to the universal muse. 
</P>
<P>
"There are moments," she concedes, "when you feel your heart beats faster. You 
feel something. There is an energy -- days when you can do nothing and days 
when you can do everything -- days when it goes and days when it doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
Her work is her pleasure. "I'm firmly addicted to writing. I do read a good 
deal, the great novels in English, Russian -- and of course French for Proust. 
I know these novels by heart. The element of surprise is no longer there."

ENERGY: UNLIKE HIS PREDECESSORS, OCCIDENTAL'S RAY IRANI HAS STAYED IN CHAIRMAN 
ARMAND HAMMER'S GOOD GRACES. BUT HE'S NOT A HAMMER CLONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The president's office at Occidental Petroleum Corp. has had so many occupants 
that the joke had been that it should have a revolving door. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, several ambitious executives arrived and were touted as heirs 
to Armand Hammer, the globe-trotting millionaire, Russophile, art collector and 
strong-willed chairman of Occidental. But each would eventually lose favor and 
depart, generally after public disagreements with the 91-year-old "Doctor." 
</P>
<P>
That is, until Ray R. Irani. 
</P>
<P>
Irani, 55, the company's president and chief operating officer, last month 
became the first man ever to be approved by the board to replace Hammer, should 
the chairman either die or retire. 
</P>
<P>
How has Irani -- described by acquaintances as brilliant, ambitious and 
plain-speaking -- hung on where similar officers have failed? 
</P>
<P>
"He was the type of person who recognized the problem some of us had with Dr. 
Hammer, and he just made up his mind, come hell or high water, to put up with 
him," said one former executive who asked not to be named. "Ambition only goes 
so far, but Irani was willing to do it. I admire the guy's patience; he lets 
Dr. Hammer take all the credit for everything." 
</P>
<P>
But that's not the whole story, observers said. Dissident shareholders and 
others speculate that Irani is merely biding his time until he can assume 
control. They hope that he will redress what they argue have been excesses by 
Hammer that have hurt Occidental's stock value and return to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
"Irani has his own mind on where the company should be going. That was my sense 
after meeting with him" in November, said Dale M. Hanson, chief executive of 
the California Public Employees' Retirement System, a major Occidental 
shareholder. "But Dr. Hammer casts a long shadow, and I think (Irani) has to 
function as a lord in waiting." 
</P>
<P>
Publicly, Irani dismisses such characterizations. He has nothing but praise for 
his mentor and adds that he plans to continue in Hammer's footsteps even after 
he takes charge. 
</P>
<P>
"To speculate on what I might or might not do is very strange, particularly 
since Dr. Hammer and I work together very closely," he said in an interview 
recently. "But to say there will be a dramatic change is incorrect." 
</P>
<P>
Irani is already managing the company's day-to-day operations, while Hammer 
increasingly acts as the big thinker, charity worker and ambassador of 
goodwill, analysts and observers said. Recent visitors described the chairman 
as frail and thin, though the company maintains that he has been in excellent 
health since he had a pacemaker implanted in November. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's any work being done there, constructive work and something that 
brings the bacon back home, it's being done by Irani," the former executive 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer declined to be interviewed for this story. 
</P>
<P>
Once Irani takes over, how much will he depart from Hammer's lead? Analysts 
doubt that he will veer sharply from current strategies. But institutional 
shareholders confide that, even now, Irani does not always act on some of 
Hammer's ideas for the company, though he listens to them. 
</P>
<P>
Once he takes over, Irani may have to take a hard look at some of Occidental's 
longtime holdings and policies, including its traditional dividend payout and 
high corporate debt level. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts speculate, for example, that Irani may be tempted to sell Occidental's 
remaining 51% share of IBP Inc., the Nebraska-based meatpacker and a company 
that appears to have little in common with Occidental's core chemical and oil 
and gas businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Irani said he has already turned down several offers for IBP and denied that he 
is thinking of selling, though analysts credit him with the idea of selling 49% 
of IBP to the public in 1988 in an offering that raised $960 million. 
</P>
<P>
One of Irani's major tasks once he takes over will be mollifying shareholders 
angered by Occidental's involvement with the Armand Hammer Museum of Art and 
Cultural Center, intended to house Hammer's art collection. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental has committed $85 million to build and endow the museum, which is 
being built next to Occidental's Westwood headquarters -- a commitment that has 
generated shareholder lawsuits and spurred a proposal to form a shareholders' 
rights committee under Occidental's board at the company's annual meeting in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
One shareholders group called it the "20th Century equivalent of the pyramids 
for Dr. Hammer." 
</P>
<P>
The subject is so touchy that Irani refused to discuss it at all, except to 
say, "We're comfortable with what we're doing." But Irani has shown a 
willingness to meet with Hanson, head of the California public employee group, 
and other shareholders to discuss the company in general terms. 
</P>
<P>
Attending to Details 
</P>
<P>
Irani stands to inherit a company that analysts have speculated is ripe for a 
takeover. The unusual announcement of Irani's future succession was meant in 
part to calm a stock market that sent Occidental's stock up sharply each time 
Hammer became ill, speculating that a corporate raider could step in should 
there be management turmoil in the event of Hammer's death. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever his plans, Irani has won praise for being more concerned with company 
operations and attending more to the details of running Occidental than was 
Hammer. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts have said they also find him more down to earth than Hammer, who is 
known to favor the company of presidents and kings. Irani canceled a January 
visit with New York analysts so that he could be in Los Angeles when his 
30-year-old daughter gave birth to a son, Irani's first grandchild. (As it 
turned out, the baby was born a couple of days early, so Irani just missed the 
birth.) 
</P>
<P>
Irani's ultimate succession would complete a meteoric ascent that began in 
1953, when he graduated with honors from American University in his home town 
of Beirut. He went on to earn a doctorate in physical chemistry from USC in 
1957 at the age of 22, his official biography says. 
</P>
<P>
In the next three decades, he rose quickly through the corporate hierarchies of 
such chemical companies as Monsanto Co., Diamond Shamrock Corp. and Olin Corp., 
ending up as president of Olin in 1980. Along the way, he racked up 50 U.S. and 
more than 100 foreign patents, published more than 50 technical articles and 
wrote a chemistry text. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he was recognized as a young opportunist," said Edward P. Lyons, who 
was Olin's chief financial officer and vice chairman during Irani's tenure. "He 
would either get to the top at Olin or get to the top somewhere else. He was 
destined by his ability, by his background and by his drive to achieve the 
top." 
</P>
<P>
Irani did not immediately respond to overtures from Hammer that he run 
Occidental's chemical unit -- not until Occidental's board agreed to his salary 
demands. Irani had cash compensation of $2.125 million in 1988, according to 
the company's 1989 proxy statement. 
</P>
<P>
Irani's abrupt departure from Olin in 1983 ruffled feathers there, Lyons said. 
When former Olin Chairman John M. Henske died recently, Irani did not attend 
the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
"The chairman resented to a degree when Ray left and people left with him, so I 
would have been surprised if he had come," Lyons said. 
</P>
<P>
But co-workers recalled that Irani was a strong motivator of his staff, 
engendering such loyalty that several Olin managers, including Dale R. 
Laurance, followed him to Occidental. Laurance is now Occidental's executive 
vice president for operations. 
</P>
<P>
Close Relationship 
</P>
<P>
At Occidental, Irani found himself in a position that had been previously 
occupied by other hard-driving, ambitious executives. After a honeymoon period, 
each had fallen out of favor with Hammer. 
</P>
<P>
Former President Joseph Baird left after getting the blame for Occidental's 
failure to acquire Mead Corp. Former President A. Robert Abboud departed after 
being caught in a battle for power between Hammer and director David Murdock. 
Former Vice Chairman Zoltan Merszei left after being passed over first by 
Abboud, then by Irani. All three men declined to comment for this story on 
their conflicts with Hammer. 
</P>
<P>
Irani's official designation as Hammer's successor may result from Hammer's 
recognition that he is getting on in years. But it may also be due in part to 
an unusually close working relationship between the two. "Dr. Hammer trusts him 
a great deal," Laurance said. 
</P>
<P>
Irani will inherit a company sculpted almost single-handedly by Hammer into an 
unorthodox combination of oil and gas assets, natural gas pipelines, chemical 
operations, coal and meatpacking. Unlike most large oil companies, Occidental 
chose not to get into refining and marketing, instead concentrating on 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental's net income has not broken records. It fell in 1989 to $285 million 
from $302 million the year before. Earnings would have been even lower if not 
for profitable asset sales and acquisitions, including after-tax gains from 
asset dispositions of about $49 million in 1989 and a gain of $190 million from 
a stock offering and asset sales in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Operating earnings were slightly up in 1989, to $1.39 billion from $1.38 
billion. But that came mainly from chemicals. Earnings fell in every other 
operation, including oil and gas, natural gas pipelines, meatpacking and coal. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the company has maintained a high annual dividend since 1974. In 1989, 
it was $2.50, even though net income has not covered the dividend since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Irani and other Occidental officials defend the dividend, saying it is pegged 
to Occidental's healthy cash flow. Irani said he has no plans to change the 
dividend policy, which wins the loyalty of the company's shareholders, 64% of 
whom are small investors. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental also maintains a high level of long-term debt, in part to dissuade 
raiders and in part reflecting Hammer's willingness to pursue any deal that 
promises a good return. Irani admitted that reducing debt is a priority, but 
added -- echoing Hammer -- that Occidental will not be deterred from a 
profitable acquisition merely to avoid incurring more debt. 
</P>
<P>
Still, in 1989 Occidental restructured its long-term debt, which stood at 
$8.153 billion at the end of last year, or more than half of total capital, 
which includes total debt, preferred stock and shareholders' equity. The 
pay-back period was lengthened to take advantage of rising oil prices, and 
interest rates were lowered. 
</P>
<P>
A problem for Occidental's stock is that the company regularly issues new 
shares to generate cash, analysts said. In January, a successful offering of 23 
million new shares raised $586 million to help reduce debt, but it swelled the 
number of outstanding shares to 293 million from about 100 million in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ambitious Plans 
</P>
<P>
Irani has ambitious plans to increase revenue and income in 1990. The company 
will boost capital spending by 7%, to $1.3 billion, with the greatest increases 
going to oil and gas exploration. That includes aggressive drilling programs in 
South America, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan and China, as well as major 
redevelopment of the Piper Field in the North Sea off the coast of the United 
Kingdom, which the British government approved late last year. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental has a 36.5% interest there. Production was halted by the June, 1988, 
explosion that destroyed the Piper Alpha platform. 
</P>
<P>
Piper production is expected to resume in 1992. The company also plans to 
develop satellite fields near existing production facilities. A total of 275 
million barrels of oil and condensate should be recovered from these North Sea 
fields, of which Occidental's share will be about 100 million barrels, Irani 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental stands to profit as crude oil prices rise and because of certain tax 
breaks on new production from the North Sea. In 1989, Occidental said it 
replaced about 130% of its total worldwide production of oil and gas through 
new finds and acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, Occidental completed a major restructuring of its 
domestic oil and gas operations, cutting 900 jobs and saving about $100 million 
a year. Occidental already has among the lowest costs of production in the oil 
industry, an average of about $3.15 per barrel in 1984-88, in contrast with an 
industry average of $5.58, according to John S. Herold Inc., an oil industry 
research firm in Greenwich, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
On the chemical side, analysts expect earnings to fall in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Irani, a chemical engineer by training, gets credit for taking Occidental's 
moribund chemical operation and transforming it into the company's most 
profitable unit and the source of 76% of Occidental's operating income. 
</P>
<P>
"What Oxy had before was a checkerboard, a hodgepodge," said Andrew Gray III, 
an industry analyst with the Pershing division of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; 
Jenrette Securities Corp. in Jersey City, N.J. "He got them to the starting 
point, which was the ethylene business, and filled in the gaps they had moving 
down the pipeline . . . integrating the company," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Irani's experience as a chemical researcher and executive enabled him to 
recognize the value in unwanted chemical properties and to snap them up at 
bargain prices. He oversaw a series of canny acquisitions of chemical plants, 
assets and companies, culminating with the 1988 purchase of Cain Chemical for 
$2.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Oxychem is now a leading U.S. producer of several high-value 
chemicals used to make everything from plastic pipe to antifreeze to garbage 
bags to wire coatings. Gray estimates the total worth of Occidental's chemical 
operations at about $7.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
More important, Irani integrated Occidental's chemical business, increasing its 
flexibility and enabling it to withstand the ups and downs of the market a 
little better than its competitors. When prices are bad, Occidental can use 
chemicals that it produces in its own plants; when prices are good, it can sell 
them on the open market. Many chemicals can be made with natural gas liquids 
from Occidental's own oil and gas unit. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental thus seems well positioned to ride out an expected slump in the 
chemical business in 1990, analysts said. Irani said capital spending in 
chemicals will remain flat at $330 million this year, which will go toward 
achieving an internal goal of reducing annual production costs by $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the company's plans, Irani -- perhaps mindful of his predecessors' 
fates -- refused to compare himself to Hammer or take credit for the company's 
accomplishments. "I have a very close relationship with him; he values my 
opinion and I value his, greatly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And with modesty uncharacteristic of Hammer, he added: "You have a successful 
operation by having a number of people contribute."

JOHN WESLEY HARDING'S LYRICS POINT TO THE BRASH BRITISH ROCKER'S ROOTS

<TEXT>
<P>
What do you say to an Englishman bold enough to drop out of a Ph.D program at 
Cambridge University to pursue his rock 'n' roll dreams, and one daring enough 
to take his stage name from the title of an old Bob Dylan album and then write 
his own '90s version of a Rolling Stones classic? 
</P>
<P>
The man is John Wesley Harding and the thing you say to him is, "How about a 
recording contract?" At least if you're Seymour Stein, the Sire Records chief 
whose discoveries include Talking Heads, Madonna, k.d. lang and the Pretenders. 
</P>
<P>
"My manager went into Seymour's office ahead of me and said, 'Here's the future 
of rock 'n' roll' or whatever it is managers say," Harding said good-naturedly 
when recounting his audition early last year at the Sire office in London. 
</P>
<P>
"I played two songs and he said, 'Fine. . . . Do you want the contract before 
or after lunch?' " 
</P>
<P>
When asked in a separate interview to confirm the account, Stein, president of 
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and a stickler for accuracy, paused when the 
story was repeated to him. Something didn't seem right. 
</P>
<P>
"No . . . no," he said finally, quite seriously. "It was after dinner -- not 
after lunch. It was dinner, I'm sure." 
</P>
<P>
But what about the two-song part? Was that really all that it took to get the 
contract? 
</P>
<P>
"I always respond quickly," Stein said. "When I hear something, I know it. I 
remember the time I stood outside of CBGB in New York waiting to see the 
Ramones and all of a sudden I heard David Byrne singing (with Talking Heads) 
and I was swooped up. 
</P>
<P>
"The same with Wes. He was just sitting in our conference room, but I was 
swooped up again. I could picture what the record would sound like and I could 
picture him in front of an audience. He's got a great future. He's young, he's 
prolific and he wants to be a success." 
</P>
<P>
Once you meet Harding, the new brash young man of British rock, it's easy to 
see why the compact-disc version of his first U.S. album contains 65 minutes of 
music, almost 50% more than the average album. 
</P>
<P>
Harding, 24, is a such a waterfall of energy, ideas and ambition that it's a 
wonder his U.S. debut collection, "Here Comes the Groom," didn't end up a 
three-record set. 
</P>
<P>
Harding has the good looks and confident aura of a campus leader, speaks with a 
sprinter's speed and ricochets between subjects so often during interviews that 
you wonder if he has disciplined enough to be a meaningful artist. 
</P>
<P>
Born Wesley Harding Stace, Harding claims to have written more than 140 songs 
in the two years since he dropped out of Cambridge, where he was pursuing a 
doctorate in social and political science. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the 15 songs on the new album are too wordy and some images collide 
rather than reinforce each other, but the best songs -- including "The Devil in 
Me," his lively update of the Stones' "Sympathy for the Devil" -- add up to an 
exceptionally promising U.S. debut. 
</P>
<P>
"With half an eye on history / and half an ounce of hope," Harding sings in the 
album's opening tune, and it summarizes nicely the evocative blend of innocence 
and savvy in what is the most appealing blend of lyric invention and emotional 
grace since Peter Case's "The Man With the Blue Postmodern Fragmented 
Neo-Traditionalist Guitar" album last year. 
</P>
<P>
In songs such as "Spaced Cowgirl," a reflection on a woman being consumed by 
her misplaced dreams, Harding asserts the dazzling wordplay and verbal sting 
associated with another Englishman, Elvis Costello: 
</P>
<P>
 You can be a good lover 
</P>
<P>
 Hammer nails into hearts 
</P>
<P>
 You can be a big loser 
</P>
<P>
 When the real horror starts 
</P>
<P>
 One of the complaints raised about the album, in fact, is that Harding sounds 
too much like Costello, both in the lyrics' irony and wit and in his vocal 
phrasing. But the comparisons don't seem to bother Harding. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was worried about being accused of (copying) Costello, I would never have 
used two members of Elvis' backing band because that draws even more attention 
to the Elvis issue," Harding said, sipping coffee at a fast-food restaurant 
around the corner from the Palace in Hollywood, where he would later perform an 
acoustic set on a tour with two other young attractions, the Mighty Lemon Drops 
and Ocean Blue. 
</P>
<P>
"Elvis is a great songwriter and he has been an influence on me, but not as 
much as Nick Lowe and Graham Parker, who were both influences on Elvis. I'm not 
in the same generation as Elvis, but we both heard a lot of the same music 
growing up." 
</P>
<P>
The "Groom" album hasn't broken into the national pop charts, but it is already 
a Top 20 favorite in the CMJ New Music Report, which surveys playlists of 
college and alternative rock radio stations and often spotlights artists of 
commercial and/or critical significance long before the formal pop charts. 
Harding's "The Devil in Me" video is also being shown on MTV. 
</P>
<P>
"The Devil in Me," which has been released as a single, and "Cathy's New 
Clown," a play on the Everly Brothers' old hit "Cathy's Clown," show how 
Harding uses the literature of rock to his advantage. Elsewhere on the album, 
he offers a virtual resume of his own musical influences and intentions in a 
song titled "Bastard Son." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Dylan is my father 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Baez is my mother 
</P>
<P>
 And I'm their bastard son ... 
</P>
<P>
 Though my roots show through 
</P>
<P>
 I'm just 22 ... 
</P>
<P>
 And I don't belong to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 What about the frequent references to rock history in his songs? 
</P>
<P>
"I happen to believe that rock has a history just as literature does and it's 
good to use that history," Harding said. "Some of the best literature reflects 
on other literature. Some of the best films are responses to other films. So 
rock should have those same liberties. 'Cathy's New Clown' is a 1990 version of 
the Everly Brothers tune. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were to sing the original 'Cathy's Clown,' I would 
</P>
<P>
be accused of trying to be Jonathan Richman, someone who was very naive or 
whatever. So this is trying to express the same emotion, but within the context 
of today's musical attitudes." 
</P>
<P>
Harding grew up in Hastings, a town south of London, in a musical family -- his 
mother sang opera and his schoolteacher father played piano. The highly 
opinionated Harding cites the Beatles as early rock heroes. 
</P>
<P>
He was heavily into Dylan during his early teens, but Harding didn't begin 
thinking about songwriting himself until much later. 
</P>
<P>
"Dylan was too intimidating," he said. "He was like a genius and he still is to 
me. How could you imagine ever writing a song as great as 'It's Alright, Ma 
(I'm Only Bleeding)'?" 
</P>
<P>
Through his interest in Dylan, however, Harding began listening to other 
folk-oriented songwriters, including Phil Ochs, Steve Goodman, David Blue, John 
Prine and Eric Andersen -- and those records eventually made him think about 
writing songs himself. 
</P>
<P>
After earning his degree in English literature from Cambridge and then spending 
a few months in the Ph.D program, Harding gave in to his rising passion for 
music and dropped out of school in 1988. Within a few months, he landed the 
opening slot on a tour by the then largely unknown Irish group Hothouse 
Flowers. 
</P>
<P>
The tour turned the Flowers into stars in Europe and attracted enough attention 
for Harding that he put out a hastily recorded album on Demon Records, an 
independent label in England. 
</P>
<P>
But Harding -- a name he had adopted playfully in the tradition of Dylan's and 
Costello's appropriation of their heroes' names -- was already looking beyond 
the cultish, independent record scene. He wanted the exposure and promotion 
muscle found only on major labels. Thus, the Sire audition. 
</P>
<P>
After the Lemon Drops/Ocean Blue tour ends, Harding hits the road again in the 
U.S., opening this time for singer Michelle Shocked. That tour is expected to 
reach Southern California early in June. Then he goes on the road in Europe for 
the first time with a rock band. 
</P>
<P>
Harding's themes, laced with humor and commentary, mostly revolve around 
questions of integrity and values, but he often treats those issues in ways 
that encompass both personal and social agendas. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of my material is autobiographical, though I try to write them in a way 
that doesn't focus on that," he said. "A lot of my songs make leaps from a 
political situation to a personal situation. That's because it is as important 
to be nice to your mother as to vote labor." 
</P>
<P>
As feisty as his most biting lyrics, Harding feels alienated from much of 
modern pop-rock, which he dismisses as lacking in passion and purpose. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a fan of pop music, but I hate what it has become," he said. "It's so rank 
at the moment, so terrible, the most grotesque thing. There are dozens of 
artists I love, from Peter Case to John Hiatt. But there are hundreds who are 
disgraceful and they're the ones who always seem to be on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wrote a song called 'The People's Drug.' I got the title from a 
pharmacy chain in Washington. It's about how religion used to be called the 
opium of the people, but now it's pop music. It is music without ideas or charm 
. . . music that has been filtered through synthesizers to remove the humanity 
and the heart. I just think it's time to go back to what made rock 'n' roll 
important in the first place."
