<TEXT>
<P>
Set in Vienna in the mid-'80s, "The Dreamers" is a brilliant and unsettling 
first novel that reverberates after its conclusion, suggesting the lives of the 
central characters beyond the final pages of the book. 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, it may appear that author Brian Hall attempts too much: AIDS, 
interracial relationships, anti-Semitism, suicide, Hitler's influence on 
Austria -- but all this is woven into the lives of the characters and becomes 
the fabric of their experience. Hall is a remarkable young writer who has the 
skill to explore significant issues without turning them into propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
He portrays his male and female characters with equal conviction. At the core 
of "The Dreamers" is the volatile relationship between Eric, a Harvard graduate 
student on a Rudolph Wiederholt Memorial Fellowship, and Jutta, an Austrian 
student at the University of Vienna and mother of a black child. 
</P>
<P>
Reared by unloving grandparents who never touched her, Jutta has been attracted 
to men who mistreat her and leave her. Eric doesn't fit into that category: He 
accepts her and her 5-year-old son, Timo; he even does most of the housework in 
the cluttered apartment on Lazarettgasse that she shares with two other women 
and their small children. 
</P>
<P>
Eric is very good at accepting -- after all, he's been conditioned since 
childhood to adapt himself to the needs of others: research assistant to his 
German-born father, "utterly truthful son" to his mother. "I only lied about 
those things that no one could check, such as my feelings and desires." 
</P>
<P>
He is in Vienna because he felt obligated to accept the fellowship that is 
named after his dead father and based on his study on the "role of the common 
German soldier during the years of Nazi rule," a story that concluded that 
"Nazi Germany could have happened anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Nauseated by the recognition that now it has become his work, Eric drifts and 
postpones his research on Austrian Nazi Party members from 1934 to 1938; he 
feels like a fraud as he writes his monthly progress reports to the Brigham 
Fellowship Committee. He is haunted by the disappearance of Jews in Vienna -- 
180,000 before the war, 600 at the end of the war -- and by the city's amnesia 
when it comes to the war. 
</P>
<P>
Having attempted suicide eight times, Jutta isn't frightened that Eric has 
tested positive for exposure to AIDS and possibly is a carrier. She tells him, 
"A danger like AIDS doesn't mean anything to me. It's too far in the future." 
She sees his condition as "something romantic. . . . Perhaps she even hopes 
that it is our condition now . . . a Liebestod." 
</P>
<P>
What makes the sex scenes in "The Dreamers" disturbing, are not the graphic 
details but Timo's presence. He "had seen us make love before and he had always 
known his mother did this. . . . He never came to lie between us until it was 
over. . . . He "undressed and crawled in naked with us, and I let him have his 
mother to himself while I went out. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
While Eric's relationship with Jutta becomes increasingly unhealthy, he 
develops a strong, caring bond with Timo who, for the first time, lets himself 
trust a man. Eric has long talks with him, listens to him, feeds birds with 
him. In a moving resolution, Eric pulls free from the vortex of Jutta's 
self-destruction and creates a safe place for Timo and himself. 
</P>
<P>
Hall's writing is sure, swift and vibrant. Throughout "The Dreamers," his vivid 
descriptions evoke the essence of Vienna: Schonbrunn Palace and other 
historical buildings, the prostitutes who have to register and work legal 
hours, guards carrying Uzi machine guns, and transvestites who "bum a light 
from out of the evening shadows." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the older Austrians are shown as provincial and prejudiced -- not the 
best environment for Timo or for Eric's Jewish friend, Josh, a French horn 
player from Georgia who stays in Vienna despite his contempt for the Austrians 
and plays in the "Tonkunstler Orchestra, the same orchestra that Mozart used to 
conduct." His wife Jun, a Japanese musician, can't find work in Vienna where 
the orchestras are composed primarily of white males; she spends her days 
"listening to the tapes of herself from old Japanese concerts." 
</P>
<P>
"The Dreamers" is a complex novel about boundaries: a child in bed with his 
mother and her lover, Jutta and Eric's struggle against co-dependency, four 
adults and three children in the cramped apartment, Eric's lies to his mother 
and the fellowship committee, even the boundaries Hitler violated in the 
Anschluss when he annexed his homeland because of the enthusiastic welcome in 
1938.

RICHARD EDER: LOVE IN GOGMAGOGSVILLE; 
</P>
<P>
A THEFT BY SAUL BELLOW (PENGUIN: $6.95; 124 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why did the gods and goddesses of antiquity choose mortals for their love 
affairs? Obviously, because no dalliance can accommodate more than one divinity 
at a time. 
</P>
<P>
This will do as a theme of sorts in Saul Bellow's "Theft," a miscellany of 
plot-bits, a couple of human sketches, an assortment of caricatures and various 
personal objections to what's going on nowadays. 
</P>
<P>
The author calls it a novella. Its length fits, and it contains a novella-like 
story about the chastening of a larger-than-life New Yorker at the hands of her 
Austrian au pair. It is a complex kind of chastening, involving the return of 
an emerald ring stolen by the au pair's Haitian lover; it also fits in loosely 
with other things that are going on. 
</P>
<P>
But the book's approximate center is the duel between Clara, the 
above-mentioned New Yorker, and Ithiel, the love of her life. It resembles one 
of those tempestuous amatory battles on Mt. Olympus; Jupiter and Juno, or Mars 
and Venus. 
</P>
<P>
Ithiel is a modern kind of Magus, an expert in the higher arcana of 
geo-strategy, and continually sought by presidents and prime ministers and 
Henry Kissinger. He is also, to all appearances, an alter-ego for Bellow, whose 
formidable writing career has its own Magus-like qualities. 
</P>
<P>
Clara's super-human aura is signaled by the size of her head, which is large. 
"She needed that head," Bellow writes. "A mind like hers demanded space." Even 
her migraines take up extra room -- everyone present catches them. She comes 
from a rich Midwestern family and speaks "as plain as cornmeal mush"; 
nonetheless, she's the terrifically successful fashion editor of a big New York 
magazine group. 
</P>
<P>
But the most outsized thing about Clara is her passion for Ithiel, also known 
as Teddy. "It's conceivable that the world spirit gets into mere girls and 
makes them its demon interpreters," she reflects, intent upon placing these 
demons at her lover's service. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Ithiel shares the grand passion but only, so to speak, Tuesdays, 
Thursdays and Saturdays. Other times, a god needs peace and quiet -- Bellow's 
hint as to how a Great Man is to be loved -- and the company of docile and 
well-fleshed young things who fit cozily into a trip to Venezuela to advise the 
President. 
</P>
<P>
Olympic-sized battles ensue, the kind that once would submerge an island or 
turn a perfectly nice young woman into a tree. Ithiel's and Clara's passion 
eventually works its way out through mortal surrogates. 
</P>
<P>
Ithiel takes on three wives, none of whom work out. Clara takes four husbands, 
among them a presidential candidate and an Italian super-millionaire. Her 
latest is a sexpot who fancies himself as the Rolls-Royce of partners. Clara 
feels that he's more of a Lincoln Continental. "No woman wants her bedroom to 
be a garage, least of all for a boring car." But she keeps him; her demons have 
cooled; she and Ithiel settle, more or less, for being the best of friends. 
</P>
<P>
The Ithiel-Clara show has an entertaining extravagance and a trace of comic 
ruefulness. Bellow, we are certain, is saying more than he is telling. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, like the rest of the book, it is slapdash. There is an 
irritatingly pointless use of a woman named Wong to serve as Clara's 
confidante. Ithiel's and Clara's mates are barely sketched or barely listed; 
and Bellow's writing lacks the airiness for such gossamer dismissals. 
</P>
<P>
In Clara, we have notes for what might become a memorable character; but Bellow 
has not bothered to develop them. In the last part, the confrontations between 
Clara and Gina, her au pair, have a well-wrought tension and pathos, and 
Clara's gradual discovery of the graceful dignity of someone she had taken for 
a misguided simpleton is suddenly touching. 
</P>
<P>
The episode seems unanchored, though. Nothing in the book is very well 
attached. It remains for Ithiel, a comic abstraction, to provide a voice for 
Bellow's irritabilities. 
</P>
<P>
He is withering about glasnost. He and others regularly refer to New York as 
Gogmagogsville .But his principal target is psychiatry. Of Clara's 
psychiatrist, Ithiel remarks that "If a millipede came into his office he'd 
leave with a tiny crutch for each leg." 
</P>
<P>
He detests the fashion of using childhood damage to justify adult weakness. He 
himself was beaten by his father, and he hated it; yet he loved his father. 
</P>
<P>
"The real Teddy, however, rejects this grudge against a dead man whom he 
perhaps hopes to see in the land of the dead. Besides, after age 40, a 
moratorium has to be declared -- earlier, if possible. You can't afford to be a 
damaged child forever." And he adds: "Now the heart of this whole country aches 
for itself." 
</P>
<P>
"Theft" is scrappy -- in both senses -- amiable, an amiable mess, and sometimes 
just a mess. You get the impression that Bellow enjoyed writing it and spared 
himself excessive pains. His wit and pugnacity are as penetrating as ever, and 
as welcome, but they seem to strike into a narrowing space.

ALICIA 
</P>
<P>
My Story 
</P>
<P>
by Alicia Appleman-Jurman 
</P>
<P>
(Bantam: $18.95; 356 pp.) 
</P>
<P>
Those of us well aware of the human capacity to do harm might wonder what we 
have to gain from reading another Holocaust account, one especially tragic even 
for this grim body of literature. Alicia Appleman-Jurman, who now lives in 
Orange County, saw her father and three brothers disappear in 1941, one by one, 
when the Germans invaded her town in southeastern Poland. She watched Nazis 
shoot infants in the mouth, gun down her mother and force wizened men to dig 
their own graves. At one point Appleman herself was presumed dead after she 
passed out in prison; the Nazis dumped her body among hundreds of others, but a 
Jewish gravedigger, noticing that she was still warm, nursed her to health 
after staging a mock burial for the Nazis' benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Appleman's story is far from dispiriting, however, for while lacking Elie 
Wiesel's density of narrative or Primo Levi's tangled introspection, it is not 
a simple chronicle of horrors. Appleman tells this story partly for her own 
benefit -- the calm and measured style belies an attempt to tame turbulent 
memories with prose -- but she doesn't weigh readers' shoulders with her burden 
of injustice. "Alicia: My Story" above all inspires, for it chronicles a young 
woman's ultimately successful struggle to hold on to her identity when 
everything in her environment is trying to break that grasp. Appleman could not 
take stock of herself in German mirrors, for they projected the image of "dirty 
Jew." The reflection she saw in the faces of her own people was no more 
reassuring: pale, gaunt, near death. Often, Appleman had no frame of reference 
at all, forced to hide for months in a void of fields, cabins and forests. 
</P>
<P>
Appleman eventually overcame her need for reassurance by giving form to her 
strongest feeling: hatred. Anger became her identity and strength, giving her 
the courage to engineer daring escapes, such as squeezing out of a hole in a 
train heading toward a concentration camp. In her anger, Appleman doesn't 
always explain her enemy's motivations thoroughly enough; we wonder, for 
example, why a group of British frigates repeatedly rammed her leaky old cargo 
ship of emaciated Holocaust survivors. Most of Appleman's story is revelatory, 
however, illustrating how anger was the only way out of the Holocaust, for 
feelings of inner peace could lead to surrender. 
</P>
<P>
Tellingly, the only truly "peaceful" scene in these pages takes place in a 
snowy cemetery, where Appleman lies down on the grave of a boy she loved who 
had been killed by the Nazis. "Now the snowflakes came down thickly and piled 
up on top of one another, while still keeping their identity as individual 
delicate and beautiful stars . . . . Covered with a soft blanket, . . . I 
closed my eyes and lay there peacefully in the whiteness of the Earth."

<P>
PEACEMAKING 
</P>
<P>
AMONG PRIMATES 
</P>
<P>
by Frans de Waal 
</P>
<P>
(Harvard: $29.95; 271 pp.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The Utopian type of peace is achieved at two places only -- at the typewriter 
and in the grave." This observation, not from one of the biologists and 
ethologists discussed here but from former President Richard Nixon, epitomizes 
Frans de Waal's central point: "There isn't, and likely never will be, a garden 
in which the proverbial wolves and lambs cheerfully play together or where, for 
that matter, Russian and American soldiers exchange bouquets of flowers." 
</P>
<P>
But while Nixon's next best alternative, the negotiations of Henry Kissinger, 
took months or years to reach agreement, primatologist Frans de Waal points 
proudly to chimp negotiators such as Mama, who resolve sharp conflicts in their 
colonies within minutes. When Nikkie and Yeroen, the two superpowers in the 
Arnhem, Netherlands chimp colony, started screaming at each other (a highly 
disruptive event, for it encourages other males to claim colony leadership, 
thus magnifying the tumult), Mama approached Nikkie and put a finger in his 
mouth, a common gesture of reassurance among chimpanzees. "While doing this," 
de Waal writes, "she impatiently nodded her head to Yeroen and held out her 
other hand to him. Yeroen came over and gave Mama a long kiss on the mouth. 
When she withdrew from between them, Yeroen embraced the still-screaming 
Nikkie." Side by side, the two males then chased off a rival, who had begun to 
strut around, hair on end. 
</P>
<P>
Ruffling the feathers of biologists who have tended to look at life as the 
"continuous free fight" or "gladiators' show" that Charles Darwin proclaimed it 
to be, de Waal argues that primates are uniquely talented among animals at 
resolving conflict through tolerance and reconciliation. While rats will devour 
each other when kept close together, monkeys go out of their way to avoid 
social conflict when their living space is reduced, avoiding eye contact like a 
passenger in a crowded subway car. Reconciliation, in turn, is a major fete for 
many primates; after a battle, chimps at the Arnhem zoo play metal drums while 
their friends kiss and embrace. 
</P>
<P>
De Waal's most important and original point, however, is that conflict isn't an 
inevitable tragedy we should dread, but a necessary means of clarifying social 
hierarchies and resolving differing needs among animals who have developed 
distinct individual identities. There is no need for conflict, de Waal points 
out, in a school of herrings. 
</P>
<P>
Our confusion about the role conflict plays in culture, de Waal believes, is 
exemplified by the fact that the Norwegian Nobel Committee gave its peace prize 
to Lech Walesa in 1983, even though Walesa's "Solidarity Movement, rather than 
promoting harmony, was threatening the status quo in Poland." Peace is not 
always a desired condition, de Waal explains. "The Pax Romana must have been a 
blessing for the Romans, but could the same be said for all the subjects of 
their empire?" 
</P>
<P>
"Peacemaking Among Primates" is an engrossing and irreverent work, challenging 
not only the Nobel Committee, but a host of assumptions; studying primate 
reconciliation, for instance, de Waal shows that sex has many values in the 
animal community besides reproduction, and that homosexuality is as common as 
heterosexuality.

DEMOCRACY 
</P>
<P>
WITHOUT CITIZENS 
</P>
<P>
Media and the Decay 
</P>
<P>
of American Politics 
</P>
<P>
by Robert M. Entman 
</P>
<P>
(Oxford: $22.50; 221 pp.) 
</P>
<P>
While polls show that Americans are skeptical of much reporting, few Americans 
feel as much ire against the media as political interest groups do. 
Undoubtedly, critics claiming that reportage is too liberal or conservative are 
seen as canceling each other out, while those who deem it too superficial seem 
to favor the kind of long and lumbering coverage that most Americans avoid at 
all costs. 
</P>
<P>
In "Democracy Without Citizens," however, Duke University political science 
professor Robert Entman contributes some original criticism to the old debate, 
constructing arguments that will be more difficult to dismiss, for they avoid 
simplistically scapegoating politicians as cynical, media managers as greedy or 
readers and viewers as apathetic. Journalists cannot easily triumph over the 
trend toward instant reporting, Entman writes, for ironically, they would be 
seen as "out of touch" if they stopped superficially reporting the hour's news 
in order to cover issues affecting the public more profoundly, such as the 
deal-making that leads to important policy decisions. Politicians, in turn, 
cannot help but take advantage of the instant media's dependency on official 
statements, for if they fail to do so, as Jimmy Carter and Michael Dukakis 
often did, their opponents will, oversimplifying their issues and stereotyping 
their positions. 
</P>
<P>
While understanding, Entman is not forgiving, contending that "instant 
journalism" is a danger to democracy. Its reporting, he writes, is both too 
passive, failing to serve as a watchdog for the public interest, and too 
bellicose, more interested in uncovering scandalous behavior after the fact 
than in scrutinizing decisions as they are being made. 
</P>
<P>
"Democracy Without Citizens" is weakened by a tendency to blur print and 
broadcast journalism (most of Entman's criticisms pertain to the latter) and by 
an abundance of wishful thinking ("The public must begin craving better 
journalism"). On the whole, though, this is an unusual departure from an often 
partisan and predictable body of literature. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS AND THE THIRD WORLD 
</P>
<P>
by the Panos Institute 
</P>
<P>
(New Society: $12.95 paper; 200 pp.) 
</P>
<P>
 Predictions that AIDS could cripple the Third World inevitably seem alarmist, 
for even in the countries hardest hit by the virus, the official numbers of 
deaths due to AIDS (1,250 in the Congo, 2,369 in Uganda) pale beside figures 
for deaths due to the much older problem of malnutrition. "AIDS in the Third 
World" suggests that these figures dramatically understate the problem, 
however: Random tests of 13,000 Congolese showed 7.4% of the population to be 
HIV-positive (this means 133,000 Congolese could have the disease), while 12.2% 
of adults in Kampala, Uganda, tested HIV-positive (while urban areas have a 
higher incidence of AIDS, 750,000 Ugandans would be infected if the figure were 
only 5%). 
</P>
<P>
Also striking in these pages are several precariously steep charts diagramming 
the rapid rise in the number of official AIDS cases: from 300 to 2,700 between 
1984 and '88 in the Caribbean; 60 to nearly 3,000 between 1986 and '88 in 
Brazil; and 1,700 to 11,000 between 1986 and '88 in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
More than a compendium of grim statistics, "AIDS in the Third World" is the 
clearest account to date of the way African leaders have combatted the disease 
despite highly limited resources: While in Western Europe there is one doctor 
for every 470 patients, in Uganda there is one for every 21,000. The editors 
generally praise the nations' strategies, illustrating, for example, how 
leaders in Guinea-Bissau staged a contest in a packed stadium to find the 
catchiest song about not catching AIDS; the winning musician described "the 
girl with the beautiful body . . . who said yes to all men . . . after 1,2,3 
years she became so thin. . . ."

In the 1983 Return of the Jedi (NBC Sunday at 8:30 p.m.) there is a sense of 
the closing of the circle in this thoroughly satisfying last installment of the 
"Star Wars" cycle. While we press on with the business of the Jedi knighthood 
and Rebel battles and with the question of Luke Skywalker's parentage and his 
confrontation with the dark side of his own nature, director Richard Marquand 
and writer Lawrence Kasdan, who share the screenplay credit with 
producer/series creator George Lucas, see to it that the screen is filled to 
the gunwales with the galaxy's best inventions yet. Mark Hamill stars as Luke. 
</P>
<P>
It's once again time for Judy Garland's Dorothy and her dog Toto to trek down 
that Yellow Brick Road in The Wizard of Oz (CBS Sunday at 8 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
"Miami Vice's" executive producer Michael Mann made a splashy 1981 directorial 
debut with the high-style, hard-edged Thief (Channel 5 Monday at 8 p.m.), in 
which James Caan (in top form) plays a professional criminal eager to break 
away and live a normal life. 
</P>
<P>
Crude and sensational yet urgent and pertinent, Billy Jack (Channel 13 Monday 
at 8 p.m.), in its unique, awkward way became a key film of the early '70s. Tom 
Laughlin starred as well as directed and co-authored (with his wife and co-star 
Delores Taylor) this uneven yet powerful film about a half-breed casting his 
lot with the Indian side of his ancestry and coming to the aid of a progressive 
schoolteacher (Taylor), whose do-your-own-thing policies and hippie students 
clash with the conservative, bigoted town folk nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Desperado: Avalanche at Devil's Ridge (NBC Monday at 9 p.m.) is a 1988 TV movie 
Western starring Alex McArthur as roving cowboy Duell McCall, who is framed for 
murder. Rod Steiger co-stars. 
</P>
<P>
James Toback's 1983 Exposed (Channel 5 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is a drenchingly 
romantic thriller lots stronger in style than credibility and inspired by the 
view that the redeeming maiden of Goethe's "The Sorrows of Young Werther" is an 
angel of death -- that for Werther death is redemption, his only salvation. 
Toback's ambiguous angel is Nastassia Kinski, a beauty who captivates Rudolf 
Nureyev's concert violinist and also Harvey Keitel's Paris-based terrorist. Not 
wholly convincing but admirable for its wit, passion and bravura. 
</P>
<P>
The 1984 Purple Hearts (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.) seems a deliberate (but pale) 
carbon of "An Officer and a Gentleman," an old-fashioned, all-stops-out romance 
between a Marine Corps doctor (Ken Wahl) and a Navy nurse (Cheryl Ladd) played 
out against the Vietnam war. 
</P>
<P>
Francis of Assisi (Channel 11 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is a so-so 1961 religious 
epic, directed by Michael Curtiz and starring Bradford Dillman in the title 
role and Dolores Hart (who soon thereafter gave up her career for the convent). 
</P>
<P>
Samson and Delilah (Channel 11 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is the lurid, spectacular -- 
and often entertaining -- De Mille Biblical saga starring Victor Mature and 
Hedy Lamarr in the title roles. 
</P>
<P>
Alan J. Pakula's 1971 Klute (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a stylish 
thriller that is also a love story, involving Oscar-winning Jane Fonda's 
Manhattan call girl and Donald Sutherland (in the title role) as a small-city 
Pennsylvania cop in pursuit of her tormentor, a dangerously disturbed client. 
</P>
<P>
A Long Way Home (Channel 2 Thursday at 9 p.m.) is a worthy 1981 TV movie in 
which Timothy Hutton stars as a young man obsessed with locating his brother 
and sister, from whom he was separated in childhood when all three were 
abandoned by their parents. 
</P>
<P>
In Coal Miner's Daughter (Channel 13 Friday at 8 p.m.) Sissy Spacek is luminous 
portraying country music star Loretta Lynn -- the poor Kentucky girl who 
married at 14 and had four children before she discovered her musical talents. 
The heart of the 1980 movie is Lynn's relationship with her husband (played 
with strength and humor by Tommy Lee Jones). 
</P>
<P>
The 1981 Hell Night (Channel 9 Saturday at 9 p.m.) more than lives up to its 
title. Director Tom De Simone and writer Randolph Feldman show us there are 
still plenty of scares to be found in the old haunted house with its creaks, 
squeaks, groans and things that go bump in the night. Linda Blair and Vincent 
Van Patten star.

</P>
<P>
GORBACHEV'S RUSSIA BY BASILE KERBLAY TRANSLATED BY RUPERT SWYER (PANTHEON 
BOOKS: $9.95,PAPER; 175 PP.) 
</P>

By Robert Scheer, Scheer's most recent book is Thinking Tuna Fish, Talking 
Death: Essays on the Pornography of Power (Hill &amp; Wang).

<TEXT>
<P>
Change in Gorbachev's Soviet Union has come so rapidly and openly that one can 
only sympathize with the efforts of professional Sovietologists to write books 
that keep pace with events and also say something more interesting than that 
which is available in the mass media. These fellows used to have an easy time 
of it during the old stagnant pre-Gorbachev days when change came sluggishly 
and information was tightly guarded. Then, their tea-leaf reading seemed an 
indispensable exercise. Now, it may be simply beside the point. 
</P>
<P>
This book is an effort to jump on the express of Soviet reform, describe the 
obstacles and predict the ultimate destination, all without pausing for the 
author to catch his breath. The galleys sent out for review were finished in 
June of last year and what with translation and other delays will reach stores 
almost a year later. 
</P>
<P>
Much has happened in the interval to make this brief and hastily thrown 
together book seem dated. For example, the power of Yegor Ligachev, described 
in this book as almost an equal in power to Gorbachev, has declined 
considerably in the last year. By concentrating on breaking events rather than 
on the sources of change, the author has guaranteed his book a short shelf 
life. 
</P>
<P>
The result is not so much a book as a it is a collection of notes for a book. 
Important notes, by an important author, but sketchy and therefore unsatisfying 
nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
Most interesting is the assertion by Kerblay, a distinguished Sorbonne 
professor, that his fellow Kremlinologists, in evaluating Gorbachev's reforms, 
tend to get it exactly wrong. They ignore the complexity and energy of the mass 
social base of Soviet society and its impact on events. Kerblay chides that 
"Sovietologists generally focus on the political regime or the workings of the 
economy . . . for the well-bred scholar holds that society has no leverage on 
so rigid a system." 
</P>
<P>
He stresses instead the obvious, often missed by the experts, that Gorbachev's 
policies have already profoundly altered the mores of the society on a 
grass-roots level and that uncontrollable and unexpected responses are now 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
Which means that the reform drive no longer fully depends on Gorbachev's 
survival. The genie of freedom, Kerblay seems to argue, is now out of the 
bottle "making a reversion to the status quo ante highly unlikely." 
</P>
<P>
One consequence "is the emergence of public opinion, which is visible in the 
eagerness with which people devour newspapers and follow TV discussions, and 
even more so in the influence that certain movements are coming to exert in 
sensitive areas such as ecology, the preservation of the national heritage, and 
the building of nuclear power stations, to the point where they are starting to 
affect decisions." As proof of his point only last week four Soviet Asian port 
city governments, on their own authority, refused to allow a nuclear-propelled 
container ship to dock. This was an action of municipal independence not likely 
to be tolerated in any Western democracy. 
</P>
<P>
The other basic shift in grass-roots thinking derives from the massive 
condemnation of Stalin that has provoked a far more serious debate on "the 
problem of morality in public life." Meaning that everything that is important 
is up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
Having established all that, the author inexplicably plunges into a lengthy 
dirge on the ills of Soviet society from alcoholism to the inefficiency of 
agriculture. None of this seems fresh or revealing compared to a typical 
Gorbachev speech. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a lot of other stuff that we know or could easily pick up 
elsewhere: long lists of names, citation of past scandals, and familiar 
biographical detail without point, like Gorbachev's place of birth, education 
and route of ascension to power. It reads like filler intended to pad an 
already too-thin effort. 
</P>
<P>
To make this padding seem portentous, there is the inevitable lapse into 
know-it-all Kremlinology. For example, the assertion that Gorbachev's 
"originality lies less in his ideas, which he borrows frequently from his 
advisers, than in his courage . . . ." Sounds plausible enough, but how does 
the author know this? He doesn't. This sort of statement, authoritative but 
undocumented, just lies there in the text every five pages or so as if ordered 
up by a cynical editor to hold the reader's respect. 
</P>
<P>
Even more offensive is the headlining of the obvious as if it were fresh. A 
chapter on "The Broad Outlines of Gorbachev's Policies," begins with the news 
that "Gorbachev's chief foreign-policy aims are to resume dialogue with the 
United States in order to achieve nuclear arms cuts . . . ." Hot stuff, no? 
</P>
<P>
But tailing the flood of daily news accounts from the Soviet Union is the least 
of this book's problems. More serious is the tendency of its summary thoughts 
to have been called into question by the fast pace of events. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in a discussion on the limits of glasnost, the statement that 
"there never has been any discussion of Soviet foreign policy" in the media was 
disproved in the aftermath of Afghanistan. Or the flat assertion that "the 
Party has no intention of relinquishing either its ideological monopoly or its 
control over all aspects of social life," which, this season, is no longer so 
obvious. 
</P>
<P>
Even the solid passages often tell us what we already know. There is a good 
discussion of the problems inherent in restructuring the Soviet economy, but it 
relies heavily on already published and widely noticed works by Soviet 
economists, led by Abel Aganbegyan. One does not need a Kremlinologist 
interlocutor, as in the old days, to get Aganbegyan's story. The writings of 
this top Gorbachev adviser, who is a frequent American television guest, were 
not smuggled out of his homeland. The man himself is signing them out there in 
the mall. 
</P>
<P>
That is the problem with this thin work. There was a time when a hurried look 
into the Kremlinologists' crystal ball could provide the illusion of insight. 
We were at the mercy of Soviet experts who had access to secret data or who 
were particularly skilled at inferring far too much from a single snapshot of 
the leadership at the Kremlin wall. A book like this one with its dull listing 
of names and events distilled from endless hours of perusing purloined 
documents and reading between the lines of party documents and Pravda accounts 
might have been worth the effort then. But now the latest Gorbachev or Sakharov 
speech or indeed the latest report in The Times will tell us far more.

YOU ONLY GET ONE BLOW ON THAT WHISTLE;

<P>
EXPOSING CORRUPTION IN GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY BY PENINA MIGDAL GLAZER AND 
MYRON PERETZ GLAZER (BASIC BOOKS: $19.95; 286 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Col. Harry G. Summers Jr., Summers, a nationally syndicated columnist, is 
the author of On Strategy (Presidio/Dell), the Vietnam War Almanac and the 
forthcoming Korean War Almanac (Facts On File). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ernest Fitzgerald, the original Pentagon whistle-blower, has written an 
important new book, "The Pentagonists." But its importance does not lie in the 
"exposes" that it contains. Instead it lies in the fact that it unintentionally 
provides valuable insights into how unreliable a guide former whistle-blowers 
can be to events beyond their initial revelations. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is simple: Whistle-blowing is the modern equivalent of the ancient 
custom of falling on one's sword, and, like that ancient custom, it is a 
one-shot operation. Common sense tells us that once an employee goes public and 
embarrasses his superiors with exposes of wrongdoing, he has committed 
institutional suicide. No matter what the courts or whistle-blower protection 
laws say, you can count on it that a whistle-blower will never again be given 
access to insider information. That's true no less in private industry, 
newspapers, television or even public service organizations than in the 
Pentagon. In fact, government institutions may provide the most benign 
whistle-blower climate of all. 
</P>
<P>
As Smith College Prof. Myron Peretz Glazer and Hampshire College Dean Penina 
Migdal Glazer point out in their new book, "The Whistle-Blowers: Exposing 
Corruption in Government &amp; Industry," "of the sixty-four whistle-blowers 
studied, twenty were able to hold on to their positions; of these, all worked 
in the public sector." 
</P>
<P>
All this by way of introduction to Fitzgerald's "insider" view of "waste, 
mismanagement and fraud in defense spending." Fitzgerald may be many things, 
but he has not been a Pentagon insider for at least 20 years. Hired in 1965 
during the Johnson Administration as a civilian cost accountant for the Air 
Force, Fitzgerald's enduring claim to fame is that in testimony before Sen. 
William Proxmire's Joint Economic Committee in 1968 and 1969 he "blew the 
whistle" on the cost overruns of Lockheed's C-5A military transport plane. 
</P>
<P>
What really enshrined him as whistle-blower supreme, however, was the fact that 
in 1970 then-President Richard Nixon personally ordered him fired. As 
Fitzgerald details in the first third of his book, after a long court battle he 
was reinstated in 1973 but demoted to a lesser job. After another long court 
battle he settled the suit in 1982 in return for "full reinstatement" and 
payment of legal fees. The effect of this long battle, Fitzgerald admits, is 
that he had lost his objectivity: "I had come to view the opposition as 
incredibly powerful, corrupt and dishonest," he writes. And a touch of paranoia 
crept in as well. He uncovered something "that most Americans are scarcely 
aware of." 
</P>
<P>
Like those who explain all of the ills of American society as the fault of the 
evil Trilateralists or of the Council on Foreign Relations, Fitzgerald 
discovered the even more insidious "Pentagonists." "In other banana republics," 
he writes, "the military comes to power with a sudden coup and the installation 
of a junta. Here it is different. Power in America is not a matter of 
controlling the police forces and the media. America runs on money. And the 
military has quietly come to vast economic power by taking vast amounts of the 
federal income for itself." 
</P>
<P>
Wow! It's common knowledge that America's gold reserve (what there is left of 
it) is stored at Ft. Knox, Ky., but one assumed that it was still under the 
control of the Treasury Department. If the military is indeed "taking vast 
amounts of the federal income for itself," Fitzgerald is offering an expose of 
the first magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
But, having raised this issue, Fitzgerald then abandons it. Instead, for the 
next three chapters he turns to a subject he evidently considers even more 
crucial . . . how he was personally savaged, not only by "Richard the Wicked" 
and "Gerald the Banal" but also by "Jimmy the Good." As he puts it, "The Jimmy 
Carter debacle seduced, corrupted and destroyed the ethical authority of the 
liberal Establishment" (that is, it refused to listen to Fitzgerald). He 
doesn't give Reagan (who also refused to listen to him) any higher marks, 
especially after his campaign to be appointed comptroller of the United States 
went down the tube. And, not surprisingly, as the former president of the 
National Taxpayer's Union from 1971 to 1973, Fitzgerald was not happy with the 
defense spending of the Reagan years. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of the second half of his book is devoted to second-hand reporting 
on that spending -- familiar tales of overpriced hammers, toilet seats, plastic 
stool caps, coffee pots, etc. Lacking from his accounts, however, is an 
explanation of the defective procurement and pricing regulations that allowed 
these scandals to occur. 
</P>
<P>
After an attack on the Packard Commission (he sees it as a White House plot 
orchestrated by Adm. John Poindexter) and an attack on Administration efforts 
to plug leaks (according to the Glazers he won the Cavallo award in May 1988 
for, among other things, refusing to sign the new security form pledging not to 
reveal classified or classifiable information), as well as an obviously 
tacked-on chapter on the unfolding Pentagon procurement scandal, Fitzgerald 
concludes with a simple-minded account of a conspiracy by the "Pentagonists" 
and the "Corporate State" to take over the country. 
</P>
<P>
Like many so-called insider accounts, Fitzgerald's gets so carried away with 
its author's own vendetta that it misses the complexities of the real world. In 
"Wild Blue Yonder," a hard-hitting Defense Department expose reviewed in these 
pages last April, Nick Kotz emphasized that "the military-industrial complex is 
not a conspiracy imposed on this country, but a community of interests, 
backgrounds, professions and ideologies." That is a problem that Fitzgerald's 
rancorous and self-serving analysis does not begin to address.

BABY BOOMERS GETTING THEIR MTV WITH VH-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By James Endrst, The Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Baby boomers are used to having it their way. 
</P>
<P>
They wanted their MTV. They got their MTV. 
</P>
<P>
Now, says MTV Networks President and Chief Executive Officer Tom Freston, 
they've got their VH-1. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, when Video Hits One was launched in January 1985, nobody really 
wanted it. 
</P>
<P>
And, says Freston, with good reason. 
</P>
<P>
Originally a video dumping ground for MTV rejects, VH-1 offered a confusing and 
far from satisfying array of "all other" artists -- including Barry Manilow, 
Willie Nelson, Melissa Manchester and Julio Iglesias. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody said, 'If we play Julio Iglesias, it will repel all teen-agers,' " 
Freston recalls. 
</P>
<P>
It did. And it repelled a lot of other potential viewers, as well. 
</P>
<P>
"It was totally wrong," Freston said during an interview at the company's 
headquarters here. In an effort to avoid competing with itself, he explained, 
MTV Networks turned its successful formula on its head and found it to be a 
profound failure. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't want to take one viewer away from MTV," Freston said. (The network 
owns kiddie-cable channel Nickelodeon as well as MTV and VH-1). 
</P>
<P>
Now they are singing a different tune at VH-1. 
</P>
<P>
Viewer-listeners of the 24-hour music channel get a far more palatable musical 
diet consisting of mainstream acts such as Anita Baker, Kenny G, Carly Simon, 
Luther Vandross and MTV crossover acts such as Michael Jackson, Phil Collins 
and George Michael. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the cable network has come up with some eye-catching programming: 
VH-1 "A Go-Go," for example, is a weekend party-music block that has a 
different super-model host each week (such as Elle Macpherson, Christie 
Brinkley and Iman; "New Visions" plays to jazz and New Age music fans; "Watch 
Bobby Rivers" is a talk show with an up-and-coming host; and "Flix," a weekly 
half-hour magazine show, focuses on movies for adults. 
</P>
<P>
"We've already been through trying to make VH-1 not hip, not fun, not 
irreverent," said the 43-year-old Freston. "When you become 35 years old, you 
don't become a drag. You don't all of a sudden say, 'Man, I'm 35. Let's run out 
and buy some Julio Iglesias records.' " 
</P>
<P>
In fact, as the big three networks have already discovered with shows such as 
ABC's "thirtysomething" and "The Wonder Years," it is hip to be square. 
</P>
<P>
Families are in, for instance, so VH-1 has a "million dollar baby" contest 
sponsored by Downy Fabric Softener and Gerber Products Co., through which some 
child 2 years old or younger will get a Treasury bill for $1 million through a 
random drawing. 
</P>
<P>
Coming off its most successful year and now reaching about 32 million homes -- 
up 21 percent since 1987 (compared with MTV's 45 million) -- VH-1 has redefined 
itself from the ground up. 
</P>
<P>
Freston said the new VH-1 has four major thrusts. The first order of business, 
certainly, is music, which consists of 60 percent to 70 percent of the 
channel's programming, including oldies from the '60s and '70s (as opposed to 
MTV, which thinks of oldies more in terms of the early '80s). 
</P>
<P>
Nostalgia is also big with boomers and, therefore, VH-1. As a result, there are 
plenty of whatever-happened-to and then-and-now pieces called "Milestones," 
featuring a moment in video history relevant to baby boomers, ranging from 
sports highlights to the assassination of President Kennedy. Freston said that 
such features are appealing to boomers, a somewhat self-interested lot who 
"have gone through a lot together, or at least think they have." 
</P>
<P>
A third spoke in the VH-1 programming wheel is comedy. Dennis Miller of NBC's 
"Saturday Night Live" is a favorite, as are Jay Leno and George Carlin, with 
short routines dropped in between videos. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, knowing that baby boomers' interests are greater than the time 
they have to devote to them, VH-1 is broadening its focus from "Entertainment 
Tonight" type of news updates to include life style news, with features on 
home, travel and education. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most significant to VH-1, however, is its impact on the music industry. 
</P>
<P>
Like MTV before it, Freston said, VH-1 has effectively launched the careers -- 
not to mention the record sales -- of many new artists, such as Grammy winner 
Tracy Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Schnur, national director of video promotion at Elektra Records, is 
certainly sold. 
</P>
<P>
"I think VH-1 has proven itself as important as MTV," he said, confirming that 
Elektra Records artists such as Chapman, Anita Baker, the Gipsy Kings and 
10,000 Maniacs owe much, if not most, of their success to VH-1. 
</P>
<P>
"They took 10,000 Maniacs from a band that had an under-50,000 album base to a 
band that's now a platinum act," Schnur said. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of years ago," added Schnur, "it was, 'Let's get this on VH-1 because 
MTV won't play it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Now, he said, his company targets videos specifically for the channel. "They've 
proven they can sell records. Lots of records." 
</P>
<P>
Not that everything is running perfectly at VH-1. 
</P>
<P>
There is a decided lack of personality among the on-air personalities at VH-1 
-- especially in contrast to MTV. 
</P>
<P>
And that, Freston admitted, is certainly not by design. 
</P>
<P>
(The channel has only one personality to speak of in talk-show host Bobby 
Rivers, for whom Freston says VH-1 has big plans, though he's hardly a 
household name.) 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, many of the people the music network is so avidly pursuing have 
never heard of VH-1, or, if they have, remember the Julio days. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's still an identity problem," said Jim Boyle, director of public 
affairs for the National Cable Television Assn. in Washington. But, Boyle 
added, VH-1's task will be made considerably easier in light of its MTV 
association, which gives it "a reservoir of confidence" in the eyes of 
advertisers and cable operators. 
</P>
<P>
"It has to be perceived as the new, improved VH-1," Freston said. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, in dropping some MTV-ish elements, such as rap, heavy metal and 
some cutting-edge rock, VH-1 has an almost wall-to-wall look of white bread. 
</P>
<P>
That, however, is more a choice of format than of color, say the people at 
VH-1. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, "the other MTV" appears finally to be on the right marketing sound 
track. 
</P>
<P>
And Freston does not worry about the MTV crowd's crashing the party at VH-1. 
</P>
<P>
"We win either way," he said.

LIVES ON THE BOUNDARY; 
</P>
<P>
THE STRUGGLES AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF AMERICA'S UNDERPREPARED BY MIKE ROSE (THE 
FREE PRESS: $22.95; 254 PP.; 0-02926821-4) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Barbara Neder, Neder is the administrator for the Los Angeles Times Reading 
Lab, a computer-based literacy project. She is also a volunteer literacy tutor 
and serves on several literacy task forces. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unlike those who rebuke without offering solutions, Mike Rose produces a 
statement of hope in "Lives on the Boundary." Rose weaves a tapestry, gleaning 
from his own learning experiences and those of other's whose lives have 
intersected his. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, associate director of the UCLA writing program, describes his book as 
"vignette and commentary, reflection and analysis." It is an "engagement with 
language," an examination of people who have been labeled failures, an 
exploration of the process becoming literate, and a rite of passage for Rose 
himself into the academic world. 
</P>
<P>
Rose immediately confronts the "back to basics" cry for a return to drills on 
parts of speech, grammar rules, spelling and diagraming sentences. The 
landscapes of Rose's education intermingle with scenes of people and places in 
his response to education fundamentalists. There are scenes of the deprived, of 
"information poverty," of struggles and anger, and finally, of great hope. 
</P>
<P>
Rose came to Los Angeles with his Italian immigrant parents in the early '50s. 
He moved into an impoverished neighborhood in South- Central Los Angeles. Woven 
into this tapestry are vivid, yet dreary, scenes of the neighborhood and Roses' 
family life. His education was as bleak as the neighborhood. He was stuck in a 
vocational track throughout his parochial school until an insightful teacher 
recognized potential where others had only seen deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
Rose chronicles his discovery of classic literature and critical/analytical 
communication which lead him from the grim boundaries of his neighborhood to 
Loyola University. His journey continued to UCLA graduate school and then on to 
the Teacher Corps in the housing projects of east Los Angeles County. Along the 
journey are encounters with professors, master teachers and students -- 
children of migrant farm workers, Vietnamese veterans, and underprepared 
college freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
With these students Rose shares harbored feelings of being out of his league 
and of "dreary impotence." Yet, throughout his story, the evidence of 
deficiency is not that of the students, but of the American education system. 
According to Rose, in an effort to tailor instruction and guarantee the 
democratic right of education for all, educators "frequently slot rather than 
shape, categorize rather than foster," a judgment of ability which, accurate or 
not, has affected the curriculum these students have received. Hope is evident 
in the lives of the students, such as the veterans who wanted to change their 
lives. Rose recognized that despite their earlier failures, they still held 
onto an American dream: "Education held the power to equalize things." 
</P>
<P>
As for the solution, Rose immersed his students in talking, reading and writing 
toward the development of critical thinking. Through these case studies, Rose 
continually challenges "the assumption that error can be eradicated by zeroing 
in on the particulars of language . . . and that grammatical error signals some 
fundamental mental barrier." 
</P>
<P>
Rose re-entered the university "with some responsibility for making it work . . 
. to see beyond failure . . . (and) develop perception." He challenges the 
politics of academia and presents a "forceful call" to those who teach to 
encourage performance; to "engage books and ideas thought to be beyond (the) 
grasp (of students)"; to recognize that "error marks the place where education 
begins," rather than diagnosing the error as an illness and attempting to 
provide a remedy with corrective teaching. Rose cautions all, "How much we 
don't see when we look only for deficiency, when we tally up all that people 
can't do." 
</P>
<P>
As I began reading "Lives," I wondered who was the intended audience. Then as I 
traveled along with Rose on his journeys, my own doubts of ability as an 
undergraduate college student and my love for the "masters" in literature were 
resurrected. I felt concerns for my children's education and recognized my 
parental responsibility toward their learning. I was inspired as a "teacher" to 
tap the dreams of the "functionally illiterate" with whom my life intersects 
daily. And like Rose, I was reminded that as we teach, so we learn.

As a personal rite of passage, "Lives" is a vindication from the 
"powerlessness" of Rose's childhood to his right to cross those boundaries into 
the academic world. He is critical of the "publish or perish" attitude within 
the university. Ironically, his driving force to publish this book signifies a 
rite of passage within the university system. He champions this right for 
others, and he challenges universities to recognize the potential of the 
"so-called" educationally impoverished. "Lives" is a mirror to the many lacking 
perfect grammar and spelling, who may see their dreams translated into reality 
after all.

<TEXT>
<P>
Never mind what a young man's fancy lightly turns to as the spring flowers 
nudge to the surface, the bumper crop this spring is not so much in affairs of 
the heart but in the many faces of the evil that surrounds them. 
</P>
<P>
Catherine Gaskin's brooding The Charmed Circle centers on the handsomely 
endowed Seymour sisters -- Julia, Constance and Alex -- the beautiful, talented 
offspring of renowned actor Sir Michael and concert pianist Ginette Maslova. 
The setting: wartime England and Scotland and the immediate postwar years. 
While this is overwhelmingly Julia's story and a traditional one of her romance 
with -- and marriage to -- James Sinclair, a young flight lieutenant in the 
RAF, there is a sense of foreboding from the first moment the young lovers 
enter the gloomy, down-at-the-heels Scottish castle to which James is the heir. 
</P>
<P>
In their disparate ways, however, the three Seymour sisters thrive -- Julia 
following in her famous actor-father's footsteps and progressing to Hollywood 
as a young widow, Alex cutting a journalistic swath in Washington, and 
Constance finding contentment closer to home with a somewhat lackluster, but 
loving, English civil servant with a bright future. 
</P>
<P>
But the haunting and magnetic pull of the brooding Sinclair Castle that she and 
her young, now-fatherless, son have inherited is the albatross around Julia's 
neck. Salvation in restoring the crumbling-apart castle seems to come in the 
unlikely form of Rod McCallum, the swashbuckling, popular Hollywood movie star 
who not only sweeps Julia off her feet but seems equally as dedicated as she in 
restoring the place. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the roots of McCallum's twisted fascination with the restoration 
become apparent, though, any evil that the castle itself may have radiated has 
been dwarfed by his own. And the nightmare for Julia begins. 
</P>
<P>
"The Charmed Circle" is peopled by characters directed by forces beyond their 
own control who are being drawn down a path of Stygian darkness. This novel by 
the best-selling author of "The Ambassador's Women" is spellbinding, but it's 
also as heavy as a double serving of haggis. "The Charmed Circle" is a 
Doubleday Book Club selection. 
</P>
<P>
Considerably more upbeat is Coral Lansbury's The Grotto, a sprawling novel that 
flits from Sicily to Australia and chronicles the adventures of Gwen Harcourt 
de Marineo in the years immediately preceding World War II. But, even though 
Gwen's early indiscretions -- including an unwanted pregnancy and being married 
off, by proxy, to a drunken lout in Australia (to save the honor of her 
Sicilian family) -- end well when her natural talents bring her success down 
under, there's an evil shadow hanging over this heroine as well. Much of it is 
in the centuries-old Sicilian obsession with honor and grim retribution, as 
personified by the grotto of the novel's title -- the dark place at the edge of 
the sea where Sicilian mothers took daughters who had dishonored them and 
quietly drowned them. Evil, too, in the form of a paternal grandfather with 
sinister Mafia connections and in the form of a fleeting fascination on Gwen's 
part with Dolfi, the amoral "child of the devil," who resurfaces in her life in 
Australia. Suddenly, World War II erupts and Gwen's new, better life is on the 
line. 
</P>
<P>
Lansbury, graduate dean at Rutgers who has published, in addition to three 
previous novels, a book on Victorian literature and history, has an imagination 
equipped with after-burners. This thoroughly engrossing and entertaining story 
should never have worked -- the plot is too multilayered and involved. Instead, 
it works like a beautifully crafted watch, and Gwen Harcourt de Marineo emerges 
as the definitive "Unsinkable Molly Brown." 
</P>
<P>
But are you ready for this? Not only does it work for a novel about UFOs 
staffed by funny-looking little people, but by funny-looking little people who 
realize that their own genetic makeup needs a bit of patchwork and, as a 
result, are engaged in the wholesale abduction of earthlings! 
</P>
<P>
In Nighteyes, author Garfield Reeves-Stevens (he of "Children of the Shroud," 
"Dreamland" and "Bloodshift") advances the thesis that, for decades, UFOs have 
been quietly snatching innocent humans off the streets of the United States, 
running genetic experiments on them to iron out bugs in their own progeny and 
then -- just as quietly -- depositing their guinea pigs back on Earth. The few 
who recall, even vaguely, that they have been snatched are a figure of fun at 
the periodical rack of the supermarket check-out line. Until, of course, our 
friends from Outer Space get sloppy and stage one of their abductions right in 
the middle of an FBI surveillance of a Malibu fellow-agent suspected of a 
tie-in with Russian agents and which -- on top of everything else -- is also 
being photographed by an enterprising journalist. From superior intellects, we 
somehow expect tactics a little less reminiscent of a bunch of Army trainees 
staging their first night maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
But the evil in "Nighteyes" is not so much with our visitors from space -- who, 
actually, are pretty likable -- but with the FBI and the CIA, both of whom see 
the Malibu fiasco as an interdepartmental double-cross. And the ensuing body 
count (awesome) is racked up not by the space visitor but by the two agencies, 
both trying to protect their respective turf. 
</P>
<P>
It's a credit to novelist Reeves-Stevens' craftsmanship that all of this 
skulking about -- this flitting back and forth from FBI "safe" houses in places 
such as Burbank to dreamlike sequences aboard the UFO -- comes off quite 
plausibly and that we really care that the lovers, Beth and Merril, find the 
contentment for which they hunger, and that teen-ager Wendy Gilmour's unborn 
baby isn't really as unplanned as we had thought. 
</P>
<P>
It's the old power-struggle-among-the-rich-and-pretty that captivates British 
novelist Jilly Cooper in Players as a covey of television personalities jockey 
for dominance in a battle to strip a prosperous British television company of 
its franchise with the Independent Broadcasting Authority. Prosperous or not, 
Corinium Television is on shaky ground with the IBA, so management, in the form 
of ruthless Tony Bullingham, throws everything but the kitchen sink into the 
battle to retain the franchise -- up to, and including, the recruitment of a 
beautiful, and equally ruthless, American network executive, Cameron Cook. It's 
difficult to envision anyone in his right mind inviting any of the central 
characters in "Players" into his home if a minor child is within gunshot of the 
place because the name of the game here is s-e-x and the concern is not, as in 
"Nighteyes," with body-count but with bed-count. Who's doing what with whom for 
the glory of, or the destruction of, good old Corinium Television? Cooper, who 
hit the best-seller list with her previous "Riders," has a deft touch with the 
heavy panting and artfully shedded negligee routine that is essential to this 
sort of plotting, and "Players" will undoubtedly do extremely well in the 
predictable libidinous circles. On a likability scale, however, the television 
types in this bodice-ripper fall somewhere between Gen. Grant in "Gone With the 
Wind" and the seed pods inhabiting "The Invasion of the Body Snatchers."

HESTER'S LIBERATED DAUGHTER; 
</P>
<P>
PEARL BY TABITHA KING (NEW AMERICAN LIBRARY: $18.95; 336 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Remember Pearl? The sunny, winsome daughter of Hawthorne's outcast heroine, 
Hester Prynne? She's grown up now, and novelists of many persuasions are 
considering her fate. Just recently John Updike brought her to life in his 
fictional "S." Now Tabitha King, the author of "Small World," "Caretakers" and 
"The Trap," finds a place for her in the modern world -- in her new novel, 
"Pearl." 
</P>
<P>
This Pearl, too, is the daughter of an outcast. Her mother, Elizabeth, born and 
bred in a small town in Maine, fled from her family for reasons we are not told 
and had an affair with a black man. Pearl was the result of that liaison, and 
Elizabeth raised her alone, in Key West, as far from Maine as she was able to 
get. Only when she was dying did Elizabeth seek a reconciliation with her 
mother, and there seemed to be no animosity on the older woman's part. "Did you 
forget that I love you?" she asked Elizabeth, puzzling Pearl a bit. 
</P>
<P>
Pearl, despite her being racially mixed and illegitimate, seems to have had a 
relatively charmed life. Her mother remarried, and Norris Dickenson is 
everything Pearl might have hoped for in a father. She was sent away to college 
and earned a degree as a librarian. She did have a bad marriage, which she 
endured for seven years but managed to emerge stronger and wiser. 
</P>
<P>
We meet her when she is 35, newly arrived in Maine to claim her inheritance 
from her maternal grandmother: a house, some money and -- at last -- roots. She 
easily buys out the owner of a diner and, superb southern cook that she is, 
makes an instant success of her new enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
It seems to make no difference that she is half-black, and one wonders, now and 
then, why King bothered with this device. King is surely not commenting on 
encounters between black and white culture; Pearl is the only black for miles 
around and her neighbors take to her with enthusiasm. King does give Pearl a 
black half-brother, Dickenson's son Bobby, but even Pearl notices that he is a 
stereotype, and his troubles (he is a Vietnam veteran with physical and 
emotional scars) do not enter into the plot. In fact, nothing much enters into 
this plot except an improbably sexual set-up that keeps Pearl occupied day and 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Although King takes pains to let us know that Pearl is a liberated woman (Pearl 
calls God "She"), she decides to present her with a choice of two 
stock-character lovers: David, the erratic, bisexual, urbane and oh-so-handsome 
poet; and Reuben, the down-to-earth, solid auto mechanic. Whom will Pearl 
choose? 
</P>
<P>
She doesn't. For much of the book, Pearl carries on with both. First David, at 
his place; then Reuben, at hers. Or first Reuben, in a berry patch; and then 
David again. Although everyone knows everything about everyone in this small 
town, Pearl manages to keep the quality of her relationships a mystery to most 
of the town folk, and surely to David and Reuben (who both think she is merely 
befriending the other) until almost the end of the book. And even then, the 
choice is taken out of her hands by King. 
</P>
<P>
King creates the inhabitants of the Maine town with considerable affection. She 
likes gossipy old Walter; she even feels sympathy for his timid, nervous 
daughter, Jean. She understands what drives Karen, Reuben's nubile teen-aged 
daughter, to sex and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Pearl is an endearing character, but King has chosen to immerse her in romance 
rather than reality. When she is not sexually aroused, she is exhausted, as we 
can well understand. She is never called upon to make any difficult decisions 
or to encounter painful consequences. Even when her two lovers realize what has 
been going on, they end up embracing each other. David's descent into madness, 
we realize, is nothing of Pearl's doing; it had its seeds in events that 
occurred long before. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Pearl is a predictable tale of a gutsy woman who finds the 
complications of her life wonderfully untangled, so that she can find love and 
live happily ever after. If you believe in happily ever after, then this is a 
book for you.

TALK SHOW TRAGEDY WITH A HOLLYWOOD ENDING;

BABY DREAMS BY MAXINE PAETRO (SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER: $17.95; 337 PP.)

By Kristiana Gregory, Gregory is the author of Jenny of the Tetons (Harcourt

<TEXT>
<P>
There is nothing fun about pacing the floors in the middle of the night with a 
wailing infant on your shoulder. Particularly if you have to go to work the 
next morning. Particularly if you're a woman, unmarried, and you have one of 
the hottest, most glamorous jobs in New York where you must look fabulously 
alert in front of 10 million TV viewers. 
</P>
<P>
This is precisely why Stephanie "Stevie" Weinberger decides to forgo motherhood 
for career despite her approaching 39th birthday. A talk show host can't risk 
sleepless nights, gushy emotions or silk blouses splashed with baby vomit. 
Besides, her handsome tweed-and-leather lover, Philip, is vehemently against 
babies. They cramp his style. He's already pen pals with his teen-age son and 
daughter in California; since fatherhood didn't work the first time, why try 
for a second? 
</P>
<P>
So life perks along for Stevie and Philip. Vacations in France, a Victorian 
house in the country, candlelight dinners and separate, exquisite apartments in 
the city. That is until Carol Wilder reappears in Stevie's well-ordered life 
and a tragedy from her past comes rolling forward. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years earlier, Stevie aborted a love-child conceived with her college 
sweetheart, Andy. Due to some twisted circumstances, Andy and Carol married, 
only to divorce shortly after their daughter, Lisa, was born. Now Lisa becomes 
an assistant at the network and Stevie is filled with pangs of regret. This 
could have been her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
During a tense ride in the back seat of a limo, Carol tells Stevie what she's 
missing. "Having a child is an unimaginable experience. It links you to every 
other person who has had a child. It enlarges you, increases your capacity for 
love. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want to be childless in this big lonesome world." 
</P>
<P>
Stevie shrugs. Yeah, but. The job. She's worked so hard. Then there's Philip, 
the man of her dreams even though the topic of marriage is on the bottom of 
their discussion list, right around the topic of babies. 
</P>
<P>
The more she evaluates her life, the more Stevie realizes she never stopped 
grieving for her lost pregnancy. When a colleague admits she doesn't want to 
have the baby she's carrying, Stevie gets livid. "It's not like getting a tooth 
pulled. Dammit it! If you have an abortion, this person . . . will no longer 
exist." 
</P>
<P>
Her relationship with Philip becomes strained, her demeanor in front of the 
camera falters, and she's told to take a week off. Unfortunately, she admits, 
her job allows no margin for goof-ups. 
</P>
<P>
". . . If you're going to act stupid, you're better off acting stupid without 
10 million people watching." 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, Andy swoops in, ready to pick up with Stevie where they'd left off 
so long ago. And, he'd love to have a baby with her. Talk about pressure! He 
forecasts a "Hollywood ending," which there is. But it's kinda nice seeing a 
couple you've grown attached to, walk through an orchard in the countryside, 
"arms wound tightly around each other." What the heck. 
</P>
<P>
This is "Baby Boom," "thirtysomething" and "Broadcast News" rolled into one. 
It's hip, it's thought-provoking, and it's great reading all the way through.

THE ATHLETE OF THE FUTURE;

HOW SPORTS SCIENTISTS ARE HARNESSING THE MECHANICS OF MOTION, THE CHEMISTRY OF 
STRENGTH AND THE POWER OF THE MIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA LOVEROCK, Patricia Loverock was a member of Canada's 1976 Olympic 
Track and field team.

<P>
A RESEARCH SUBJECT NAMED Orel Hershiser appears on a movie screen in an 
Inglewood laboratory. Hershiser is pitching the ball for the sake of science, 
so rather than Dodger Blue he wears only a baseball glove, shorts, socks, shoes 
and an array of electrodes and wires. As he throws, the upper body that looks 
slightly skinny on the mound is remarkably muscular and fluid. He uncoils and 
explodes across the screen in slow motion -- frame by frame -- hands, wrists, 
arms, trunks, hips and legs flowing together in perfect synchronization as he 
winds up and lets the baseball go. 
</P>
<P>
Three 16-millimeter move cameras are filming front, side and overhead views of 
the pitch at 500 frames per second. On an 8-foot-high console, 2,000-foot reels 
of 1/4-inch magnetic tape record microprocessed signals from every twitch of 
Hershiser's muscles. An oscilloscope's electrical wave traces his muscular 
activity, and a printer simultaneously spews out a copy of the image appearing 
on the scope. An electronics technician intently monitors the performance of 
these data-collection devices. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser's cooperation with the scientists at Centinela Hospital Medical 
Center is helping define the path of athletic excellence to come. On film and 
on an electrical-energy graph, Hershiser is part of a study of human movement 
that seeks to enable doctors to understand how muscles function -- and 
malfunction. The information they're gaining could allow them to diagnose and 
treat injuries without surgery, and ultimately help prevent sports injuries. 
It's just one of the experiments being conducted in biochemistry, biomechanics, 
psychology and even genetics that may change the way American athletes are 
trained, treated and expected to perform in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, in this country, "the whole idea that science has something to do 
with the performance of athletes is new," says Dr. Harmon Brown, chairman of 
sports medicine and science for the Athletic Congress, the governing body for 
track and field in the United States. Americans, he says, have been slow to 
accept the idea of sports as a legitimate focus for research. The Soviets 
pioneered the field before the 1952 Olympics, traveling around the world to 
film outstanding athletes and study their training programs. Then, in 1952, 
instead of copying what they had seen, they began designing their own research. 
The results were dramatically apparent in the 1972 Summer Olympic Games, when 
Soviet athletes, who just four years before had won 29 gold medals to the 
United States' 45, came away with 50 gold medals, besting the Americans' 33. 
Equally striking was the improvement of the East German team, which won nine 
gold medals in 1968 but took home 20 in 1972 and 40 in 1976. That showing 
helped jolt Congress into passing the Amateur Sports Act of 1978, giving the 
U.S. Olympic Committee the authority to fund research and create an 
organization to raise money for scientific support programs and research 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
As the fledgling U.S. sports-research program begins to bear fruit, it is 
changing the shape and psyches of American athletes, who are feeling increasing 
pressure to turn to sports science not for the quick fix of steroids and 
illegal performance enhancers but for safe, sophisticated ways to reach their 
potential. What follows is a sampling of the ideas and experiments that could 
help create the American sports superstars of the next generation. 
</P>
<P>
The Mechanics of Motion 
</P>
<P>
THE SCIENCE of biomechanics is based on observation. Watch the body perform a 
movement, analyze that motion and use the findings to adjust the next 
performance. Increasingly, scientists and coaches are using advanced technology 
to observe activity that is not readily visible to the eye, breaking a single 
motion into finer and finer parts and, theoretically, perfecting it. In coming 
decades, experts say, they'll be watching athletes move from the inside out. 
</P>
<P>
Biomechanical computer analysis established its place in sports training when 
the United States women's volleyball team won its first Olympic medal, a 
silver, in 1984. Head coach Arie Selinger gave much of the credit to Gideon 
Ariel, a Coto de Caza biomechanics expert and computer specialist. Using 
computer technology he developed in 1968 when he "married WordStar to 'Rocky,' 
" Ariel converted videotape images into colored stick-figure-type drawings that 
move in three dimensions. The simple images on the computer screen allowed 
Selinger and Ariel to see what a trained human eye missed: the precise angle of 
the players' joints as they jumped, served, blocked and spiked. Movement of the 
joints is a clue to the workings of the muscles, showing which muscles are 
working the hardest and pinpointing possible weaknesses. Selinger and Ariel 
used the computer data to adjust the team's training programs and, Ariel says, 
to make medalists of what might have been a 15th-place team. 
</P>
<P>
Such computer models are being used to answer specific questions -- for 
example, how far do a competitor's hips move above the hurdles during a race? 
That information might tell a coach that the athlete needed to lower his lead 
leg to clear the barrier more efficiently. It cannot, however, reveal exactly 
what is happening in the body. Providing that internal view is the next phase 
of sports biomechanics. The Hershiser study, which analyzes and compares the 
movements of seven professional and six amateur pitchers, is part of the 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
The Centinela scientists record not only a slow-motion visual image of 
Hershiser but also a map of the electrical impulses produced by his shoulder 
muscles from windup to follow-through. An active muscle will "fire" -- transmit 
an impulse -- frequently. A muscle that is working less hard, perhaps because 
of weakness or injury, fires less frequently. Once scientists know how the 
muscles fire when one of the best pitchers in baseball history throws a ball -- 
and exactly which muscles are used in pitching -- they can use that model to 
help treat pitchers who are injured or in pain. By contrasting Hershiser's 
graph and those of other healthy pitchers with one produced when an injured 
pitcher throws, they can pinpoint the site of an injury by spotting muscles 
that aren't firing as a healthy muscle would. This will allow them to spot an 
injury long before surgery is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The no-pain, no-gain maxim applies in the lab as well as in the gym: Before the 
film is shot, a lab technician uses long, hollow needles as thick as toothpicks 
to inject fine nickel-chromium wires into eight sites in the pitcher's 
shoulder. At each site, a 22-inch-long wire is carried by the needle directly 
into the belly of the muscle, as far as an inch deep. (There is a cot in a 
corner of the room for those who faint during the process.) The technician 
gently pulls out the needles, but the wires remain. For a few seconds, the 
muscle aches -- "it feels like a charley horse," says lab director Marilyn Pink 
-- until the wires find a comfortable place to lodge. Once they do, they act as 
antennae, conducting signals to a radio transmitter Hershiser wears on a belt. 
The transmitter amplifies the signals and broadcasts them to an antenna across 
the room, which relays them to a receiver on the computer console. Every muscle 
twitch is recorded on tape, then appears as a glowing green jagged line on the 
oscilloscope screen. High, frequent peaks on the screen show the firing of the 
most active muscles; smoother sections with lower, less frequent peaks show 
when muscle activity is winding down or impaired. 
</P>
<P>
"If you combine the patterns we get from the computer screen with the 
high-speed film, you can see how the muscles are interacting with each other," 
says Robert Gregor, an associate professor of kinesiology at UCLA who conducts 
high-speed film research on college athletes. "We can slow it down 
tremendously, and this allows you to go through the parts of the movement, 
quantify it and provide any analysis that might be helpful in strengthening and 
rehabilitating." The goal: to be able to give athletes a kind of "instant 
replay" analysis so that they can make immediate adjustments in technique and 
training. The Dodgers are using the results of the recently completed pitching 
study to tailor injury-preventing conditioning programs, says Bill Buhler, 
Dodger head trainer. 
</P>
<P>
Ariel hopes to give added scope to movement analysis by using holograms, 
three-dimensional laser images. Sitting in his office, he envisions a scenario 
from the 1990s: "If I want to see Carl Lewis jumping right on this table now, 
using laser technology, I could push a button and he will jump. I will look at 
it again and again. I will stop him in the air. Then I will take my jumper and 
I will superimpose him and I will see where there is a difference." Ariel adds 
that while his two holographic jumpers are leaping across a table-top, a 
computer will analyze information such as the strength of each jumper's takeoff 
leg; how high each raises his arms and legs, and how altering technique would 
change the performance. He may discover that if his jumper improved his leg 
strength by 10% he could outjump the champion. Combined with electrical data on 
muscle functioning, such 3-D analysis could take the guesswork out of training.

AS ARIEL AND HIS PEERS search for ways to quantify and perfect the movements of 
tomorrow's high-performance athletes, biochemists are tracking the chemical 
mechanisms that underlie strength and motion. For some athletes, the chemical 
key to improved performance has been anabolic steroids. But the Ben Johnson 
scandal -- which blew the lid off a system in which coaches look the other way 
or help athletes break the law -- along with new evidence of harmful side 
effects casts some doubt on how long that will continue. Michael Yessis, an 
exercise physiologist and a professor of physical education at Cal State 
Fullerton who edits and publishes Soviet Sports Review, a quarterly magazine 
that publishes translations of Soviet sports medicine, says the Soviets already 
have reduced their use of steroids, not because of drug testing but because 
they have found that the drugs cause injuries. "They found out that, yes, 
steroids are effective for getting bigger and stronger muscles, but the muscle 
grows so fast the ligament and tendon can't keep up with it," he says. The 
muscle stresses connective tissues to the breaking point. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have a high-level athlete, you don't want to expose him to something 
that could ruin his career very quickly," Yessis says. For that reason, it's 
likely that athletes of the future will be seeking strength on very different 
chemical pathways. Doctors at the USOC are particularly interested in the 
question of how to fuel a super-athlete. "We see nutrition as probably the main 
area of performance enhancement," says Dr. Robert D. Voy, former chief medical 
officer of the USOC.. 
</P>
<P>
Although training tables and special diets long have been part of many American 
athletes' regimens, basic nutrition for the athlete is one of the least 
understood areas of sports science. "We continue to use nutritional research 
that was done in the '40s," says Ann Grandjean, director of the International 
Center for Sports Nutrition at the University of Nebraska Medical Center and 
chief nutritional consultant to the USOC. "That basically told us that if you 
have a person who is deficient, you can enhance his performance through proper 
nutrition." But once the deficiency has been treated, pumping nutrients into an 
athlete won't boost performance and may actually be harmful. 
</P>
<P>
So instead of striving to find a single superstar-producing supplement, 
researchers are concentrating on the basics: determining the precise 
nutritional needs of individual athletes. "We know that iron, say, is very 
important," says TAC's Brown, who acts as a sort of clearinghouse for research 
that affects track-and-field athletes. "But what about trace elements like 
copper and cadmium. What role do they play? What kind of deficiencies occur as 
a result of athletic training?" 
</P>
<P>
At the Beltsville Human Nutrition Research Center in Maryland, Helene N. 
Guttman, associate director of research, is overseeing experiments to find out. 
"We're working on projects that have to do with athletics and stress," she 
says. One recent study: "We did some experiments in which we saw the effect of 
copper deficiency on heart disease. Not enough copper in males would 
effectively make the heart explode if it was under any kind of stress. That's 
interesting in itself. But we've found that the relationship between two 
minerals that athletes sometimes take as supplements, zinc and copper, is 
critical. Pill pushers advise taking zinc supplements, but an excess of zinc 
interferes with the body's utilization of copper." And too little copper, added 
to the stress of an athletic event, could lead to dangerous -- even deadly -- 
copper deficiency. 
</P>
<P>
With such studies feeding into the nutrition research base, by 2000 it should 
be possible to determine exactly what each athlete needs in relation to the 
workout he or she is doing, Yessis says. One can envision a small computer set 
up at the training site. Once blood tests have established typical before- and 
after-workout levels of trace elements and other factors, such as hormones, 
amino acids and white and red blood cell counts, depleted during a typical 
workout the computer can calculate an athlete's needs and deficiencies can be 
instantly balanced. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, computer models will work from data bases begun in infancy and will 
track the normal nutrient levels in the healthy athlete's body through his 
life, Guttman says. She envisions supplements that look more like food than 
pills -- a chromium-fortified apple, for example -- to help ensure that "what 
enters the mouth enters the metabolism in a usable form." 
</P>
<P>
Voy is certain that within the next decade, advances in nutrition "will have 
convinced (athletes) that a peak performance in sport can be gotten without the 
use of drugs. And it will be a lot safer and a lot longer lasting." Those who 
cling to a reliance on illegal substances as performance enhancers will be 
dissuaded from using them, Voy predicts, because "by the year 2000 I think we 
will have more sophisticated laboratory technology than we have now and it will 
be very easy for us to test athletes and control their use." 
</P>
<P>
Steroids may become passe for another reason: Researchers are zeroing in on the 
chemical processes that determine how much force muscles can produce. 
Eventually, they may be able to create steroidlike effects safely and legally 
with training alone. 
</P>
<P>
The key to muscle-building is a protein called myosin, which affects the 
muscle's ability to contract slowly or quickly, explains V. Reggie Edgerton, 
chairman of the UCLA kinesiology department. When a muscle has more of what is 
called slow myosin, it burns its fuel slower and contracts slowly. This type of 
myosin is associated with muscles involved in endurance events. Fast myosin 
creates powerful contractions that result in explosive movements needed for a 
floor routine in gymnastics or a 100-meter sprint. Currently, it is possible to 
increase the amount of slow myosin through training, but not the fast myosin. 
Gymnasts, it seems, are born, but long-distance cyclists can be made. And 
researchers such as Edgerton are trying to find out exactly what activity is 
needed to signal muscle cells to produce the kinds of myosin that will enable 
them to contract in ways that will enhance performance. 
</P>
<P>
"What we don't know is the specific chemical event that causes a gene to 
synthesize a given protein," Edgerton says. "Is it one type of exercise? 
Somehow, the (muscle activity) has to trigger a chemical to send a messenger to 
the cell to have it create the certain types of myosin. There is some 
mechanical /chemical link. If we knew what triggered certain types (of myosin), 
then we could design training programs." 
</P>
<P>
The Genetics of Champions 
</P>
<P>
IN NURSERIES of the next century, a young athlete's potential may be clear long 
before he can demonstrate it by hurling a block across the room or mastering 
motor skills more quickly than his peers. The process of spotting future 
champions, says Claude Bouchard, an exercise physiologist and anthropological 
geneticist at Laval University in Quebec, Canada, could begin with genetic 
testing at birth. "What we are doing is trying to find the genetic determinants 
that allow someone to adapt well to exercise," Bouchard says. "We are not 
talking about selective breeding, we are talking about identifying those who 
have the gene combination that shows a gifted athlete." 
</P>
<P>
Bouchard's ground-breaking research is focusing on the genes associated with 
the transformation of energy in the muscle, particularly the genes that are 
involved in replenishing adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. This substance is to 
the body what gasoline is to a car. It's the fuel that keeps humans running. 
The more effectively ATP is replenished, the more efficiently the human 
operates. In his labs, Bouchard and others have trained hundreds of what he 
refers to as "truly sedentary persons." His subjects have never taken part in 
sports or fitness activities. In fact, they rarely attended physical education 
classes in school. Bouchard put these individuals on a standardized, carefully 
monitored training program for several weeks. At the end of that time, he 
measured their maximum oxygen uptake, one way to determine how efficiently a 
person can replenish ATP. "We have found people who did not improve at all -- 
zero gain after 15 to 20 weeks of training. Others would improve by 100%," 
Bouchard says. 
</P>
<P>
Bouchard and his team call the zero-gain group "non-responders" and the others 
"high responders." "High responders are those very few, apparently very 
fortunate, who with exercise adapt very well, very rapidly, and they adapt a 
lot." These days, Bouchard is trying to discover the genetic markers that make 
a person a high responder, and he believes that in 20 years his team will have 
narrowed its focus to 10 to 20 genes. Not bad, he says, considering that it 
takes 50,000 genes to create a human. Individuals with these 10 to 20 genes 
have a much better chance of becoming good, even great, athletes, Bouchard 
says. "When you think about athletic performance, if when you train you improve 
your initial maximal oxygen uptake by 70% or 80%, it is going to have a lot to 
do with your interest in the sport and your desire to keep training. . . . 
Chances are the top athletes in the world are high responders," he says. "It 
will be impossible for us to tell that somebody will definitely achieve the 
elite status, but all the elite athletes will come from individuals who have 
these characteristics." 
</P>
<P>
The application of this research "is far down the line," he cautions. "Within 
10 years, we hope to have a battery of gene probes that will identify the genes 
associated with the gifted athlete. The probes are used to identify, but now 
only for a limited number of genes, the ones that we know are useful in certain 
movement. With that research, we can get the selected (children) into early 
training programs. I will not be involved with that, but it will take the form 
of channeling the motivation and the interest of the children so we have more 
chances to succeed." 
</P>
<P>
The Power of the Mind 
</P>
<P>
WITH ADVANCES in biology, chemistry and technology narrowing the differences 
among the bodies of athletes, increasing attention is being focused on their 
minds. "There is a world of muscular talent out there," says Ron Kendis, a UCLA 
sports psychologist, "but if the mental aspect is lacking, they don't perform 
to their highest level. It comes down to the mental toughness. Look at all the 
people who dove against (Olympic gold medalist Greg) Louganis. They were the 
best divers in the world. But he had not only the physical but the mental 
wherewithal to win over and over again, even after a setback. He has mastered 
the mental preparation. He could see himself at every phase of the dive from 
the takeoff to the splash. The mental aspect is the cutting edge." 
</P>
<P>
Sports psychology has only been around the United States as a gradu ate-level 
study for about 15 years, says Dorothy Harris, a pioneer in the field. She says 
research going on now will finally convince American coaches that this field is 
important. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the research is being done on developing the ability to concentrate 
more effectively -- mental skills training," says David Yukelson, a sports 
psychologist for the athletic department at Pennsylvania State University and 
one of the few applied sports psychologists in the country. Right now, he says, 
"We can teach athletes how to refocus: not so much how to mentally prepare for 
competition, but how to stay composed during a game. If a pitcher has just 
thrown a perfect sinker that was hit over the fence for a grand slam, he needs 
to know how to let go of that. His next pitch has to be as relaxed and focused. 
That's building and maintaining the concentration skill." 
</P>
<P>
Researchers are also trying to understand visualization. In one study, Olympic 
skiers are connected to biofeedback equipment and trained to imagine traveling 
over a course. "They actually can get muscle activity as they take the course 
in their heads," Yukelson says. Eventually, mind and muscles know exactly what 
to expect at every turn and when to use certain energies. "They can plug into 
automatic pilot and move in the exact way we know will make them perform the 
best." 
</P>
<P>
Most intriguing, Yukelson says, is psychobiology: the body-mind connection. 
"It's the thing we know the least about and that can be the most helpful," he 
says. "If you look at champions in the Olympics, they report on being in a zone 
within a zone. Physiologically, the muscles are relaxed and fluid. Mentally, 
they are in a highly concentrative state; they are optimistic -- they are in a 
cocoon. But where are their brain waves at this state? We are working with 
getting an athlete into the alpha state. We don't know what that can mean to 
athletes, but that's what research is for. We'd like to know more about the 
brain waves of an athlete, and what gets them to that state, chemically and 
physically." 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, sports psychology will become as much a part of coaching as teaching 
new play patterns, Harris says. "A sport psychologist's time would be well 
spent working with coaches, who in turn could reach a lot more athletes." 
</P>
<P>
Putting It All Together 
</P>
<P>
DEVISING THE STUDIES, carrying them out and analyzing the data are just the 
first part of building the athlete of the future. Even when science 
concentrates on application -- such as Ariel's holograms or mapping the 
electrical firing of Hershiser's muscles -- there has to be a way to make the 
leap from research results to competition results. In this country, the liaison 
between scientists and athletes is first a coach and then, possibly, a team 
organization that also takes its cues from a coach. 
</P>
<P>
It's a system that often creates standout athletes, but it isn't a system that 
scientists think can create cutting-edge performances with any certainty or in 
any quantity, or make the best use of their research. "(Coaches) are scared of 
science and most of them shy away from it. They don't feel comfortable with it. 
And because of that they ignore what is going on in the labs," says geneticist 
Bouchard. Ariel and Yessis, as well as Bouchard, point to the fact that there 
are no standardized requirements for coaching, no assurance that coaches will 
even be marginally aware of sport sciences. "More than 80% of the coaches here 
have no training," Yessis says. "Look at the coaches in Little League and AYSO: 
It's parents." Virtually anyone with enthusiasm can get some sort of coaching 
job. "At the high school level, the coaches are English teachers and history 
teachers who might have a little background, but who need some extra money. 
College coaches are also mostly former players, but with no background in 
training and conditioning. Take (former UCLA basketball coach) John Wooden. 
What made him great? He was able to handle eight or 10 wild egos at one time. 
He focused on psyching the guys up for the big game and had them practice the 
best plays over and over. But it was all just based on his own experience. On 
the pro level, again many coaches come from the ranks of former players." 
</P>
<P>
It is a system, sports scientists say, that must be changed. "For (my) research 
to have any kind of effect on the field of sport performance, we are going to 
have to have almost a revolution in the people involved in the coaching field," 
Bouchard says. Ariel agrees. "(Coaches) cannot be just physical educators," 
says the man who has worked with U.S. Olympic coaches of track and field, 
handball and volleyball. "They have to have knowledge of physics, psychology, 
physiology." 
</P>
<P>
Ariel sees the computer as an antidote to the lack of scientifically trained 
coaches. He is beginning to collect information for his own sports data base, 
and he envisions extensive computer files crammed with the latest information. 
A coach will enter an athlete's age, weight, bone density, leg strength and 
recent sport performances, and the computer will tell the coach how the athlete 
should train to maximize his or her potential. This training plan will be based 
on data from similar athletes around the world. 
</P>
<P>
When scientists think about combining science and sports, however, they think 
in grander terms than simply improving the knowledge of the coaches. They talk 
longingly of the system of the Eastern Bloc nations. Nutrition specialist 
Grandjean remembers a conversation with an Eastern Bloc coach. "He told me that 
the U.S. has more information -- more computers, more scientists, more 
researchers than they do in his country. 'What you do not have,' he said, 'is a 
system to distribute that information. If I was told that my athletes had to 
eat peas to win, they would be eating peas in three days.' " 
</P>
<P>
Yessis says his surveys of Soviet research show that much of what the current 
U.S. research foreshadows is already reality in the Soviet Union. The Soviet 
and Eastern Bloc countries, Yessis says, train their coaches at government 
sports institutes with an emphasis on sports science. Coaches working with 
elite Soviet athletes must have been ranked athletes themselves and have 
completed postgraduate instruction in sports sciences. Many top researchers are 
former athletes. Nutrition evaluation, including frequent blood and urine 
testing, is as much a part of a Soviet athlete's routine as a warm-up jog. 
</P>
<P>
But most important, according to Yessis, the Soviets begin their 
athletictraining process by evaluating children psychologically and physically 
at a young age, and enrolling promising candidates in state schools where 
general education is combined with athletic training and where sports sciences 
can be applied and furthered. 
</P>
<P>
Yessis points to recent papers published in the Soviet Union about the use of 
high-intensity field currents to measure muscle fatigue. (The study was 
conducted on Olympic athletes and hopefuls.) The Soviets' system will allow any 
applications gleaned from the study to be easily disseminated. In this country, 
not only would athletes and coaches be unlikely to hear about the study and its 
results, but it also would be difficult to get athletes to interrupt their 
training to participate in this kind of experimentation. Robert Voy says what 
the Soviets have that the Americans don't is the "full attention of (the) 
athletes." 
</P>
<P>
None of the scientists think the Soviet system could or even should translate 
directly to the United States, where the tradition of individual effort is the 
norm, but all would like to apply some of the Soviet training techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Gideon Ariel is participating in a program started last year in Israel that he 
thinks shows the direction that would make U.S. athletics most successful. 
Ariel and a group of sports scientists he's chosen from a variety of East Bloc 
countries have identified sports in which Israeli athletes can be world 
dominant by 2000. One of those chosen was women's field hockey, Ariel says. 
Today in Israel, young girls who have excelled in sports such as volleyball are 
being tested for the movement skills needed for field hockey. "You begin with 
children who are 5 or 6 years old. You don't just play field hockey. You let 
them have gymnastics, swimming, resistance (weight) training and hockey. You 
teach them the mathematics of hockey-stick moves. All their lives they are 
learning everything from the point of view of field hockey." The team members 
will be well cared for, earning an education and financial security as 
repayment for the sacrifice required to be able to compete at the elite level. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried something like that in Colorado Springs for many years starting in 
1976," Ariel says. "But it didn't work, there was too much politics. And the 
results of the Olympics speak for themselves. For something like that to work 
here, it would have to be organized tightly -- the same way NASA would put 
someone on the moon." 
</P>
<P>
Yessis sees at least an evolution and expansion of privately run sports schools 
in this country, noting, for example, plans to build a large sports-training 
complex in Orange County in the next five years. Yessis predicts that these 
institutions will have individuals from all areas of sports science working 
with physically gifted children and their coaches. Children will combine their 
sports training with the rest of their education, as is done in the Soviet 
Union. The institutions will be expensive and probably elitist, but could point 
the way to making advanced training more available. 
</P>
<P>
Without such in-at-the-ground-floor programs, however, the trick to getting the 
full attention of the athlete may be through money. In 1981, the United States 
began to open its national teams to sponsorship and to allow athletes to earn 
money -- placed in a trust fund while they competed as "amateurs" -- from 
individual endorsements and even prize money. The leader in the process was the 
Athletic Congress, the governing body of track and field events. 
</P>
<P>
Although he sees an increasing centralization in the United States, Yessis 
believes that the way superstars are created here will be much the same way 
they have always been created: through the individual desire to win. That will 
bring coaches and athletes to science, as it does from time to time now, in 
search of the better techniques and the latest info. And their success will in 
turn propel the United States toward more and more centralized options that he 
sees as necessary to high performance. 
</P>
<P>
Already, he says, he is approached by parents asking him whether he can test 
their children to find out which sport is best for them. And in one case, 
Yessis is working with a coach and an athlete, trying to provide the sports 
science element in a training regimen. 
</P>
<P>
He has worked for five years with USC sophomore quarterback Todd Marinovich. 
Yessis met Marinovich and his father, former Oakland Raiders player and Los 
Angeles Rams scout Marv Marinovich, when Todd was 13. They have worked together 
since, applying Yessis' knowledge of biomechanics, exercise physiology and 
Soviet sports research to Todd's training. As a high school student at 
Capistrano Valley High School, Todd passed the football for 9,194 yards, more 
than any other high school quarterback in history. If he stays healthy and 
continues his march through the record books as a college quarterback, Yessis 
predicts that there's going to be greater interest from athletes, coaches and 
parents in what it takes to build a talent like Todd. 
</P>
<P>
"There are going to be coaches coming through, like a Marv Marinovich, who are 
going to be having outstanding athletes. Others will ask, 'Where did they come 
from? How come he's winning?' and then they will say to themselves, 'Maybe I 
have something to learn,' " Yessis says.

ATWOOD'S HUMOR

I hope readers won't be put off by the emphasis on pain and poetry in your 
recent review of Margaret Atwood's "Cat's Eye" (Book Review, Feb. 19). Perhaps 
it takes a woman to see that Atwood's is a very funny novel, as well as a 
painful one. I for one am tired of reading about how grim her work is; if you 
like intellectual black humor, no one catches girls growing up and women 
growing older better than she. But then male wrinkles and dewlaps can still be 
termed "distinguished" in this culture. Female readers know otherwise.

THE ELIOT DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One need only observe what "T. S. Eliot" backward (very nearly) spells to 
realize in what waters Wendy Martin is fishing in her diatribe against genius. 
Although an "acknowledged master of modern poetry," the bank clerk from St. 
Louis truly belongs on the bottom of the waste heap of literature with 
countless other Great Second Raters. 
</P>
<P>
That Eliot was a misogynist and anti-Semite is indeed unfortunate, especially 
for his victims, but it has no bearing on the quality of his work. His oeuvre 
will creep along just fine, on weak spindly legs, down into oblivion, with or 
without the shove of gruesome gossip. Likewise, the personal life of a real 
genius, say a Tolstoy or a Shakespeare, lies far beyond the inspired words and 
recorded epiphanies that compose his masterworks. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Martin believes that with her panegyric she has bolted shut the pearly 
gates of Parnassus. All she has really done is confuse mediocrity with talent 
and thereby get her foot stuck in the murky mixture. 
</P>
<P>
Genius does exist. Just ask the good reader of "Ulysses," "Pale Fire," "Bleak 
House," "Moby Dick," or "Mansfield Park." To paraphrase Dickinson: Genius is 
like that morning light cast upon a solitary hill, that no "ism" can overtake, 
but that the human spine feels -- the tingling purr of poetry.

OUTTAKES: WAITING FOR TRAVOLTA

<TEXT>

"The Experts" -- John Travolta's first film since the 1985 bomb, "Perfect" -- 
won't be coming soon to a theater near you. After brief playdates in Texas and 
Oklahoma last month, the Paramount pic is headed for video -- due on shelves in 
early June, according to Paramount Home Video. 
</P>
<P>
That news took co-producer Jonathan Krane by surprise. Krane -- also Travolta's 
personal manager -- thought that "The Experts" was merely on hold, until after 
the late summer release of Tri-Star's "Daddy's Home," a romantic comedy with 
Travolta opposite Kirstie Alley. 
</P>
<P>
Krane, who produced the latter pic, told us "it would make good marketing sense 
for Paramount to release 'The Experts' after 'Daddy's Home' generates 
attention. . . "

Studios are reportedly bidding hard for the right to finance the filming of 
"Body Politic," based on a political satire published by St. Martin's Press in 
1987. The authors, Lynne Cheney and Victor Gold, ought to know how to lampoon 
D.C. mores -- Cheney, chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities, is 
the wife of Wyoming Rep. Richard Cheney, the nominee for secretary of defense. 
</P>
<P>
The plot: During a President's re-election campaign, his vice-president has a 
fatal heart attack while engaged in a "delicate act" with a female news 
anchorwoman. The press secretary's assignment: Keep the veep "alive" in as long 
as possible. 
</P>
<P>
A screenplay has already been written by John Warren, with Frank Oz attached as 
director. The indie producers developing the project are John Davis, Katherine 
Knowlton and David Kennerly. From Leonard Klady

Stephen J. Cannell and co-producers are getting ready to shoot a 
"docu-re-creation" of the personal story of director Peter Bogdanovich and his 
wife, Louise Stratten -- over their objections. It will be one of five segments 
of an ABC reality-TV special, "Scandals," in the works for May sweeps. The 
couple has let it be known "they consider it an invasion of privacy," said 
Bogdanovich's attorney, Bill Peiffer. 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Hefner and the late Dorothy Stratten will be also be depicted in scenes 
re-creating moments from their lives; casting for look-alikes is under way, 
with production to begin this week. 
</P>
<P>
Bogdanovich, 49, who was romantically involved with and wrote a book about 
murdered Playboy centerfold Dorothy Stratten, recently married the late 
actress' younger sister, Louise, 20. 
</P>
<P>
Peiffer said he has informed the "Scandals" producers -- Loreen Arbus and 
Meredith MacRae in association with Cannell -- that "neither Mr. Bogdanovich 
nor his wife will be cooperating or participating in this project." He added 
that no legal action will be considered until his clients have viewed the 
special. 
</P>
<P>
Arbus told us: "Everything we're doing is a matter of public record." 
</P>
<P>
She said that the segment relies on interviews with persons close to the 
couple, including Louise's closest friend. "Every statement made, every scene 
re-enacted is validated by a first-hand or credible published source." 
</P>
<P>
Arbus further insisted: "By no stretch of the imagination can this be 
associated with tabloid or -- God forbid -- trash TV. Stephen Cannell would 
never be associated with anything that was not legitimate and neither would I. 
For one thing, my parents would disown me." 
</P>
<P>
Arbus' dad is the legendary Leonard H. Goldenson, founding father of ABC. From

Sources tell us that Bruce Willis will play the mercurial waiter-con man when 
playwright Lanford Wilson's volatile play, "Burn This," is transformed into a 
film this summer. A hit locally and on Broadway, Willis' part was originated by 
John Malkovich (who earned rave reviews), with Scott Glenn and Eric Roberts 
earning praise when they replaced Malkovich in the showy role.

Producer Ray Stark and director Herbert Ross -- who collaborated on another 
Broadway-success-turned-movie, "Steel Magnolias," due out in September --

WOVEN CLOTH IS everywhere -- on bodies, beds, tables, walls and floors. And all 
the different kinds and textures of cloth, from twill to tapestry, start with a 
loom and fiber put together in one basic arrangement: The vertical threads, 
attached to the loom, are the warp, and the horizontal threads, or weft, are 
laced in and out, over and under the warp. 
</P>
<P>
That's only the beginning. Of the three basic weaves, the simplest is the 
plain, or tabby, pattern, with the weft threads going over one warp thread and 
under the next -- as in gingham, percale and muslin. Pass the weft over two or 
more threads at a time, and it's the basket weave variation. Twill, a sturdy 
and distinctive cloth, is acheived by weaving the weft over two, three or four 
warp threads at a time in a diagonal pattern -- as with gabardine, flannel and 
serge. Satin weave -- damask, sateen and satin -- only looks simple; the weft 
threads can cross as many as 12 warp threads at a time. There are also a number 
of fancy types: pile, double, gauze and so on. 
</P>
<P>
Table and floor looms are the most common hand-weaving looms -- but there are 
hundreds of variations of the two, some with daunting prices. The table loom 
makes cloth about 18 inches wide; the floor loom, at least twice that. Harness 
looms, attached to a post or wall at one end and the weaver at the other, are 
less stable but portable. It's possible to weave a small object, such as a 
place mat, using a frame loom made from a picture frame or artist's canvas 
stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
Clothes from hand-loomed cloth are very popular, judging from the number of 
jewel-toned garments on sale at last fall's arts and crafts show at the Santa 
Monica Civic Auditorium. Clothes from hand-woven fabric are usually very simple 
in design; the cloth itself is the work of art and the finished garment merely 
a method of display. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaving supplies and instruction are available at Casa de las Tejedores in 
Santa Ana; Weaving West in Santa Monica; Weave 'n Knit Depot in Torrance; 
Piecemakers Country Store in Costa Mesa, and Studio of Handcrafts in Tarzana. 
Weaving courses are frequently offered by Everywoman's Village in Van Nuys. 
Publications include Shuttle, Spindle &amp; Dyepot, 120 Mountain Ave., 
Bloomfield, Conn. 06002; Handwoven, 306 N. Washington Ave., Loveland, Colo. 
80537 (offers weaving patterns), and Fiberarts, 50 College St., Asheville, N.C. 
28801 (often features weavers and their work).

WINE: A FRENCH ACCENT; 
</P>
<P>
CHATEAU POTELLE: NEW CALIFORNIA WINES WITH A GALLIC TASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LAWRENCE BALZER

<TEXT>
<P>
WHILE MANY new wineries in California are joint ventures with famous French 
houses, Chateau Potelle's joint venture is between a French husband and wife. 
Jean-Noel and Marketta Fourmeaux du Sartel advertise their wines as "California 
wines with a French accent." And they are just that. 
</P>
<P>
The 1986 Chateau Potelle Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc ($7.95) is softened with 
15% Semillon. Hints of its aging in French oak ovals are present in the 
bouquet. But the wine's subtle finesse has varietal integrity without any trace 
of grassiness. It's a wonderful beginning to a meal, best with seafood, creamy 
pasta dishes, quiches and poultry. 
</P>
<P>
The 1986 Chateau Potelle Napa Valley Chardonnay ($12) comes from 60% Carneros 
grapes and 40% Napa Valley. About 20% of the blending undergoes malolactic 
fermentation and 40% is barrel-fermented. In Jean-Noel's words: "This wine is 
not an assault but rather a caress." Aged in French oak, it's a wine with melon 
gentleness, poetic in Meursault style. Brilliant, silvery, the Chardonnay can 
be drunk now. But it will become richer with a year of two of cellar-aging. Buy 
it now; it's bound to improve in both value and taste. 
</P>
<P>
The 1984 Chateau Potelle Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon ($12) is a blend 
of 87% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Cabernet Franc and 8% Merlot. The enchanting 
bouquet suggests berries, plums and a hint of spices. The taste is appealing, 
with no tannic astringency. The wine, Bordeaux-French in style, has fine aging 
potential and has already won six medals. 
</P>
<P>
Jean-Noel and Marketta first came to California in 1980 to evaluate the 
marketing threat of California wines for France's Institute National des 
Appellations d'Origine. 
</P>
<P>
After tasting more than 2,000 California wines in six months, they recognized 
the potential for California premium quality wine making. In 1983, they moved 
with their two young daughters to California, making plans to produce their 
wines under the Chateau Potelle label. (Chateau Potelle, the medieval, 
twin-towered castle illustrated on their label, is the 900-year-old castle 
owned by Jean-Noel's family, which also owns the noted Bordeaux wine estate, 
Chateau Leoville-Poyferre.) 
</P>
<P>
The couple's search for premium grapes concluded with long-term contracts with 
growers in the Napa Valley and the Alexander Valley. Last year, they purchased 
90 acres of mature vines for their Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay in the Napa 
Valley. And after a lengthy negotiation, they concluded the purchase of 202 
acres of the Hamilton Vose vineyards on Mt. Veeder in Napa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
At last the couple could build their own winery. (Their first wines were made 
in leased, custom-crush locations with the couple overseeing every step: 
harvesting, fermenting, cask-aging, bottling and labeling.) 
</P>
<P>
Jean-Noel and Marketta have been in the California wine business only briefly, 
but already they're producing winners: Last year, their wines came home with 
top medals from eight national and international wine competitions. And Chateau 
Potelle was one of 63 wineries featured at President Bush's inauguration.

FOOD: GOAT-CHEESE FLAN;

MABE'S CHEF OFFERS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA A FIRST COURSE THAT'S SOUTHERN FRANCE

<P>
GOAT-CHEESE FLAN is definitely Southern France," says Claude Segal, Paris-born 
executive chef at Mabe restaurant and a chef who's been around some: Ciboulet, 
Maxim's and L'Archestrat in Paris; Ma Maison, Bistango and The Four Oaks in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
By definition, flan is a molded custard that's made with eggs and cream or 
milk. It is customarily served cold. When cheese, meat, fish or vegetables are 
introduced into the custard base, flan can also be served warm. Segal, however, 
likes the idea of a cold flan because it can be made days ahead. "In fact," he 
says, "the flan tastes better if flavors are allowed to mellow for a day or 
two." 
</P>
<P>
Segal's Goat-Cheese Flan can be served as a first course over baby greens, as 
prepared at Mabe, or, because of its dense texture, can be formed into finger 
or roll shapes as appetizers. Segal recommends a Chardonnay wine, California or 
French, to accompany Goat-Cheese Flan as a first course. For an entree to 
follow he suggests "a strong-flavored meat, perhaps roast lamb."

Back in the '60s Ashford &amp; Simpson wrote hot-natured, flat-out declarations 
of passion like "Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing" and "Ain't No Mountain High 
Enough." Now traveling the more cautious road, the couple offer the 
oh-so-conservative theme of the title cut, and the fairly defiant, 
take-it-or-leave-it "Comes With the Package." On the other hand, the Bruce 
Roberts-Edgar Bronfman composition "In Your Arms" is the loveliest and most 
genuinely sensual ballad this husband-and-wife duo has recorded in a long time, 
while "Something to You" is also freshly appealing. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, this record is as classy an effort as you'd expect from such a 
tasteful, upscale pair. It just isn't combustive enough. Its best feature is 
the Roberts/Bronfman songwriting team, and David Frank and Mic Murphy's 
production on "Comes With the Package," one of the album's most stylishly 
arranged cuts. That kind of outside spice and perspective give Ashford &amp; 
Simpson the chance to throw caution to the winds and burn a little bit.CONNIE

POP EYE: TONE LOC: TOO 'WILD' TO BE NO. 1? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just how many records do you have to sell to go No. 1 in Billboard magazine? 
</P>
<P>
Ask Tone Loc. The local rapper's raucous hit, "Wild Thing," sold 2.5 million 
copies, making it the best-selling single since "We Are the World." (It's also 
the cheapest mega-platinum single in years -- it cost $500 to make.) 
</P>
<P>
But despite easily outselling its chart rivals -- some weeks by nearly 3-to-1 
-- "Wild Thing" never made it past No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. 
</P>
<P>
This odd milestone has caused a mini-uproar in the record industry. The loudest 
complaints have come from the Loc people, who are now publicly criticizing the 
respected industry trade publication's formula for determining its singles 
chart rankings. 
</P>
<P>
"When you sell 2.5 million singles -- more records, times two, than any single 
in years -- how can you not call that a No. 1 record?" said Marty Schwartz, 
Loc's manager and an Island Pictures consultant who helped bring Loc's label, 
Delicious Vinyl, to Island Records. "We were beating our heads against the wall 
-- I've gotten calls from people everywhere who can't believe we didn't make 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz's complaint focuses on Billboard's chart methodology. Unlike the 
magazine's album charts, which are based solely on sales figures, the Hot 100 
rankings are determined by a combination of record-store sales rankings and 
airplay reports from 240 pop stations. 
</P>
<P>
According to Billboard chart director Michael Ellis, 40 to 50 stations -- 
nearly 1/6 of all reporting radio outlets -- never played "Wild Thing," either 
because the program directors dislike rap music or found the song sexually 
suggestive. The song also suffered because Billboard's reporting record stores 
only tally sales rankings, not actual sales figures. So while "Wild Thing" may 
have clearly outsold its rivals, its sales ranking didn't necessarily reflect 
the width of the margin. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz says Billboard needs to update its system. "I have nothing against the 
chart guys, who've been very understanding," he said. "But 'Wild Thing' was a 
genuine pop phenomenon -- and the system just didn't reflect the buying choices 
of a new generation of pop fans. If Billboard's reporting stations won't play 
such an enormous hit, then maybe Billboard shouldn't be using them as 
indicators of what makes a No. 1 single." 
</P>
<P>
Ellis responded: "I don't feel we're off base. Our charts simply showed we had 
an outstanding selling record that wasn't as widespread a radio hit as other 
songs it competed against. Call it a matter of regional differences in musical 
tastes or whatever, but the single simply didn't get played in a lot of Midwest 
and Bible Belt areas. Maybe some radio programmers are being stubborn or 
prejudiced. But our job isn't to tell them what to play. We just report on the 
tastes of the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
Ellis did acknowledge that it was "unusual" for a song with such phenomenal 
sales to stop short of No. 1. "I would call it an aberration -- an odd 
occurrence. But it isn't unprecedented. George Michael's 'I Want Your Sex' was 
a huge seller -- and never went No. 1 either. A lot of stations in the South 
never played it. Listen, we have stations that won't play Barbra Streisand 
records. That doesn't mean they're bad reporting outlets." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Ellis says Billboard is undergoing a "major re-evaluation" of its 
charts. By next January, the publication will adopt a computerized system that 
will allow it to monitor radio play in major markets and collect actual sales 
figures from local stores. 
</P>
<P>
"We do take these occurrences into account when we plan for the future," he 
said. "It's still just a possibility, but with our new precise computer 
information we could someday divide things up into a Hot 100 airplay chart and 
a Hot 100 sales chart. We're always looking for ways to make our system more 
responsive -- and more accurate."

HART OF GOLD: Who's the world's youngest popster? Our money's on Taro Hart, son 
of Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart, who is the co-star of Hart's new album, 
"Music to Be Born By," the perfect gift for your crystal-worshiping New Age 
chums. Due out from Rykodisc in March, the record features Taro's heartbeat in 
the womb accompanied by Hart's performance on drums, bass and wooden flute. 
According to Hart, the music is designed to provide child-bearing women with a 
"soundscape of comforting patterns to assist in the birthing process." . . . 
Are you ready for a video magazine devoted to (gasp) heavy metal? It's called 
"Hard 'N Heavy," with a premiere hourlong issue devoted to uncensored videos 
from Ozzy Osbourne and Anthrax, an Alice Cooper career retrospective, scenes 
from Motley Crue mainstay Vince Neil's feature film debut (in "Police Academy 
VI") and other headbanger highlights. The video, which is due out every two 
months, will retail for $20. . . . Sandra Bernhard's notorious one-woman 
Off-Broadway show, "Without You I'm Nothing," will be immortalized on vinyl in 
May, thanks to Enigma Records. The two-album sound track includes the 
acid-tongued comedienne's renditions of Prince's "Little Red Corvette" and 
Billy Paul's "Me and Mrs. Jones." Of Enigma, Bernhard said: "It's the home of 
Poison and Stryper, so I couldn't be happier." . . . Speaking of Enigma -- it's 
launching an Enigma Retro label that will feature classic out-of-print releases 
(though only on CD or cassette). The label debuts with very early Alice Cooper 
("Pretties for You"), the GTO's ("Permanent Damage") with releases from Ted 
Nugent, Lord Buckley and Lenny Bruce to follow.

100 POUNDS OF CLAY: Each year Bam Magazine offers a special "Bam 100" issue, 
where the music mag rates the industry's heaviest 100 hitters (and not-so-heavy 
hitters -- even Pop Eye made last year's list). In its March 24 issue, Bam pays 
tribute to the class of 1989. All the expected top moguls are on hand, but we 
were more intrigued by the mag's more obscure choices. They included: 
</P>
<P>
* Pink Floyd tour lighting director and set designer Mark Brickman &amp; Paul 
Staples. 
</P>
<P>
* Los Angeles ticket broker tycoon Brian Harlig. 
</P>
<P>
* Phoenix deejay J.J. Morgan (the first deejay to resurrect a five-year-old 
UB40 flop -- "Red Red Wine" -- which went on to become a hit). 
</P>
<P>
* Hot black producer Teddy Riley (who's produced everyone from Bobby Brown and 
Al B. Sure! to Kool Moe Dee and Heavy D &amp; the Boyz). 
</P>
<P>
* Reviled pop biographer Albert Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
* Pop archivist Hal Willner (who compiled "Stay Awake," last year's critically 
beloved Disney compilation). 
</P>
<P>
* Adventuresome San Francisco club booker Harry Duncan. 
</P>
<P>
* Grateful Dead business manager Jon McIntire. 
</P>
<P>
* John Morey, whose Narda Records was the year's hottest New Age label.

I suspect that Brown has spent the past years doing fundamental social research 
and, like many of us who have taken a good, long look at where the United 
States is going, has found that the 1990s will see a strong return to values, 
ethics, the family and productivity. And so, Brown is back with a new image of 
values, ethics, the family and productivity. 
</P>
<P>
It is all an act, and if we are not willing to see through it, we'll have to 
put up with his same old weaknesses and phony social programs.

Contrary to the statement in the section titled "When Reality Intrudes," 
"Electricity-generating windmills have become symbols of flakiness," the 
California wind-farm developments have become a major worldwide symbol of 
dramatic, efficient use of alternative energy. The wind turbine industry is a 
multibillion-dollar industry that is no longer esoteric, nor has anything to do 
with tax shelters. It creates jobs, pays taxes and is part of the solution to 
the growing environmental problems.

Regarding "Backstage at 'Jeopardy!' " (by Patricia Ward Biederman, Jan. 29): I 
was a one-time champion on "Jeopardy!" last March, winning $12,801, a 
consolation-prize armoire and color TV, and a headful of golden memories. 
People ask me all the time what the experience was like, and rather than talk 
myself hoarse, I may just lend them your article, because you really captured 
it beautifully.

L.A. BEAT: TRULIO DISGRACIAS SEEKS UNITY IN ROCK 'N' ROLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Looking for the next big thing in the L.A. rock scene? 
</P>
<P>
They don't come much bigger than Trulio Disgracias -- an amalgamation of local 
rockers, funksters, rappers and jazzbos that at last count reached 23 members. 
</P>
<P>
Among the throng are most of Fishbone, a couple of Parliament/Funkadelic 
veterans, one Red Hot Chili Pepper. Depending on who shows up, there are as 
many as five lead guitarists, five bassists and four lead singers. The band has 
become a hot item in local clubs, gaining attention through recent opening 
slots at shows headlined by Living Colour and Public Enemy. 
</P>
<P>
The method to this madness? 
</P>
<P>
"It's a statement that there is a music scene in L.A. besides heavy metal," 
said Kendall Jones, Trulio and Fishbone guitarist. "We're not putting metal 
down. We're going to do metal songs in our sets. The thing is we can prove it 
comes from a diverse group of people. The whole thing is to unify the music 
scene as opposed to just give attention to one thing at a time. We've got 
people from jazz backgrounds, rap, metal, funk, punk." 
</P>
<P>
The group's sound is not as chaotic as you might think -- or at least the chaos 
is channeled. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing people think is, 'Oh no! It's going to be total disaster,' " 
said John Bigham, who plays guitar with Miles Davis when not gigging with 
Trulio. "We rehearse well, and everybody has a job to do in the band." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Jones admits that there's another purpose to the band: to 
party. 
</P>
<P>
"It can't help being fun," he said of the band's wild shows. "We try to 
infiltrate the party into the audience so the band and audience are one. It's a 
beautiful thing." 
</P>
<P>
With Fishbone about to embark on tours of England, Europe and the eastern 
United States, Trulio Disgracias will be on hiatus for a couple of months. But 
Jones said they will try to squeeze in some dates between tour legs, and once 
Fishbone is back home in the summer the band will resume active duty around 
town. 
</P>
<P>
END OF AN ERA: The Club With No Name gets a name this weekend, with the winner 
of a christening contest scheduled to have been announced Saturday night. With 
that will come the official end of the Scream. That name -- a fixture on the 
underground night-life scene since 1985 -- was relinquished when the club's 
founders Dayle Gloria and Michael Stewart recently went their separate ways. 
Gloria continues to oversee the newly monikered club at the Scream's old 
locations (Mondays and Fridays at the Probe in Hollywood, Saturdays at the Park 
Plaza Hotel), but says the club will reflect the changes in local tastes rather 
than be the headquarters for the late-night gloom set. 
</P>
<P>
"I want it to be a more universal club," she said. "A lot of people are really 
getting into alternative music now. The crowds are integrating more. You used 
to have to be totally into it, with black hair and white face. But now 
everybody wants to have fun and see bands." 
</P>
<P>
Gloria said she plans to start shows earlier -- though not too early. 
Headliners will go on starting about 12:30 a.m. Upcoming shows include the 
Miracle Workers at the Hollywood site on Friday, and Fetchin' Bones on Saturday 
and the Lyres on March 31 at the Park Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
ONCE UPON A TIME: While waiting for the release of Peter Case's second solo 
album next month, fans may want to seek out "One Night in America," a 
newly-released live recording from a 1981 show by Case's old band, the 
Plimsouls, issued through the French New Rose label. Steven Soles (who also 
produced the new Case LP) did a terrific job remixing the session, giving the 
album the forceful presence of what sounds like a particularly good night for 
the excellent band. Among the highlights are versions of the demi-hit "A 
Million Miles Away" (with Case flubbing the words on one verse), plus outside 
material including the Outsiders' "Time Won't Let Me" and the Kinks' "Come On 
Now." 
</P>
<P>
METALLURGY: A potential bidding war for the Lostboys came to a screeching halt 
when Atlantic Records snatched up the band sight unseen recently. The group's 
hard-rock sound contains a psychotic bent and fierce vocals, courtesy of Randy 
O, former singer for the Sunset Strip band Odin (featured in the film "Decline 
of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years"). 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Vicky Hamilton manages the band adds to its credibility. Her 
association with platinum acts Poison, Stryper and Guns N' Roses is well known. 
Oh, yes, Atlantic representatives finally saw the group and were pleased with 
what they got. . . . 
</P>
<P>
What has three guitarists, two bassists, a drummer, a couple of floor tom-tom 
pounders and a singer who portrays "the Cow God" and "Satan's ham"? A group 
called Green Jello, which made a rare appearance at the Coconut Teaszer 
recently. Among the crowd-pleasing tunes were "Welcome to the Giant" -- a 
supermarket send-up of Guns N' Roses' "Welcome to the Jungle" -- and a 
rip-roaring version of "Free Bird." . . . 
</P>
<P>
On a scarier note, there's Haunted Garage. This band is a rock 'n' roll version 
of a campy horror flick, down to the severed body parts, blood and gore. The 
songs have titles like "Incredible Two-Headed Transplant," and are punked-up, 
cranked-out, three-minute descents into electrified insanity. This hard-working 
band is earning its growing infamy with frequent gigs around town. 
</P>
<P>
WHAT'S IN A NAME?: The group is Dread Zeppelin, and if you know your Rasta 
lingo and your British rock, you can figure out what it does: As the band's 
poster says, "Zeppelin Music, Reggae Style." If that's not enough, there's lead 
singer Tortelvis -- an Elvis (rotund Vegas-era) impersonator -- and a lineup 
with the names of Ja Paul Jo, Carl Ja, Cheese, Put-Mon and Ed Zeppelin. And 
while the band likes to let on that it's from Memphis, it's actually based in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
After playing a few shows at the Cage in Pasadena and a couple of colleges, 
Dread Zeppelin is making its Hollywood debut on Tuesday at Club Lingerie. The 
Sierra Madre-based independent Birdcage Records is gearing up to record a 
single of "Immigrant Song" and "Hey Hey What Can I Do," the only Zeppelin 
B-side that wasn't an album cut. 
</P>
<P>
BUZZWORDS: Heidi Rodewald and David Nolte, both formerly of Wednesday Week, 
have started a new band called Viewmaster. Nolte, who was also a member of the 
Last, says the new band sounds "a lot darker, with more of a hard edge" than 
the band they left. Viewmaster -- which also includes former Zippers bassist 
Danielle Faye -- will perform at Be Bop Records in Reseda on April 7. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Swamp Zombies are starting an "anti-mall" tour (take that, Tiffany) to 
promote their new album "Fink." The band will perform on March 30 at Peer 
Records in the Campus Shopping Center in Irvine, April 1 at Digital Ear at the 
Lafayette Plaza in Tustin and April 2 at Moby Disc in Westminster. . . .

With the term world music used to death these days, Rotondi has come up with a 
new word to describe its mix of polka and everything else: amalgapop.

ART NEWS: A DIFFERENT SPIN ON INTERNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They smiled a lot and giggled, did the jitterbug and sang in choirs, tended 
garden, had haircuts and read the newspaper. No one would have known they were 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
That's the way American government films portrayed the Japanese-Americans 
interned during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, the films were staged to show that life in the camps was normal, 
like life outside of the camps," said Bruce Yonemoto, who has collaborated on a 
video installation with his brother Norman that uses uncut, original footage 
from these propaganda films but puts an entirely different spin on what they 
depict. 
</P>
<P>
"Framed: A Video Installation by Bruce and Norman Yonemoto" runs today through 
April 23 at the Long Beach Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
The governmental footage, along with internee Toya Miyatake and Ansel Adams' 
photographs of the Relocation Center at Manzanar, Calif., are believed to be 
the only existing photographic record of life in the camps. The interned 
Japanese-Americans were barred from owning or using cameras. 
</P>
<P>
"We're presenting the footage as is, as a record, but also manipulating it and 
trying to reverse the meaning of the material" by superimposing reframed still 
photographs taken from the films over the screen on which the film is 
projected, Yonemoto said. 
</P>
<P>
By reframing a photo of a woman's face, for instance, a seemingly contented 
soul looks like a concentration camp victim, Yonemoto said. Another reframed 
photo crops off the the top of the head and eyes of a little girl standing on a 
stage. Instead of enjoying a moment in the limelight, she seems to be loathing 
an experience she was forced into. 
</P>
<P>
The installation attempts an examination of perception based in part on the 
philosophy of Henri Bergson, Yonemoto said. He read a statement inspired by the 
early 20th-Century thinker's writing: "What we are left with in the film 
documentation of the camps is clearly incomplete. It is broken. As in our own 
incomplete perception of the world around us, the government consciously chose 
only to perceive those parts of the experience that were useful, that satisfied 
a personal, social need." 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we see things the way we want to," he elaborated, "according to 
what is useful." 
</P>
<P>
The work makes a statement about contemporary propaganda, added the artist, who 
has been collaborating on video projects with his brother since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Along one wall of the dark, corridor-like installation is a scenic backdrop of 
sky and clouds actually used in television commercials for McDonald's, Hills 
Brothers coffee and other commodities. 
</P>
<P>
"The material about the concentration camps was contrived, it was a commercial. 
Our TV commercials are like propaganda." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
NEW MUSEUM GALLERY: On Saturday the Santa Barbara Museum of Art will reopen its 
Sterling Morton Gallery as the new home of its Asian collection. The 
reinstallation follows months of renovation involving extensive architectural 
changes and features more than 100 objects from China, Japan, India, Tibet, 
Cambodia and Thailand, among them paintings and prints on silk and paper, 
sculpture in wood, stone and bronze and ceramics. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the objects now on view have not been seen for several years due to 
space limitations; others are returning after extensive conservation. 
</P>
<P>
CHATTING IT UP: ARTS Inc., the local arts service organization, has formed a 
new program called Patrons of the ARTS. The program is designed to provide a 
forum for arts supporters and art organization officials to discuss issues 
critical to the management of arts organizations. Such topics as the need for 
cultural diversity; the role of major cultural institutions and public agencies 
in the arts community; and the future of (public and private) support for the 
arts will be discussed. The first program session was held last month and 
Dennis A. Collins, president of the James Irvine Foundation, a leading 
California arts funding institution, was guest. The next meeting will be held 
in mid-April. Information: (213) 627-9276.

ADVENTURES IN LAULAU LAND;

THESE HAWAIIAN RESTAURANTS STAND OUT LIKE ISLANDS IN THE SEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
At the turn of the century, waves of Portuguese and Asian immigrants came to 
Hawaii to work the sugar cane fields. And when the islands became a military 
gateway to the South Pacific, millions of American service personnel moved 
there. At first, each group kept to its own national cooking habits. But over 
the years a lot of culinary borrowing has gone on. The result is what islanders 
today call "local" food -- a Polynesian, pan-Asian mix with elements from 
Portugal and New England. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Los Angeles, a number of Hawaiian-owned restaurants offer "local" 
Hawaiian food. You won't find leis or palm fronds decorating the walls of these 
simple, no-nonsense cafes -- most concentrate on take-out business. These are 
restaurants patronized largely by Los Angeles County's sizable Hawaiian 
population and some, like Harry's Aloha Chop Suey, have been known in the 
community for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the Hawaiian restaurants I've tried, the following offer the best 
cooking and the widest selection of local Hawaiian foods. 
</P>
<P>
In Hawaii, opening a lunch stand was one way Portuguese and Asian immigrants 
escaped working in the cane fields and pineapple canneries. Noodle shops and 
palm-thatched barbecue huts selling grilled skewers of teriyaki beef, thrived. 
And stands known as okazu-ya (in Japanese okazu means things to go with rice), 
offered rice-plate lunches. Gardena Okazu-Ya is such a place. You make your 
selections of three or more rice accompaniments from a list that includes 
braised beef ribs, pork tofu, beef curry, Chinese char siu pork, Hawaiian meat 
loaf and assorted vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
From the a la carte side of the menu, you can select laulau -- a Polynesian 
dish of pork and butterfish wrapped in taro leaves then again in ti leaves 
before being steamed. You eat the taro-wrapped bundle with plenty of rice or 
fresh poi and a little cup of lomi lomi salmon. It's a perfect balance. The 
lomi, resembling a fresh salsa of chopped tomato with white and green onion and 
flecks of salt-cured salmon, livens the meat and rice. Gardena Okazu-Ya, 14902 
S. Western Ave., Gardena, (213) 323-2379. Open Wed.-Sun. 11 a.m.-7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous owner of the nondescript Paradise Okazu-Ya was Mr. Hopama, a chef 
who had gained a local following for his Hawaiian Portuguese sausage -- not too 
sweet with plenty of peppery bite. The new owner is Bill Tsukamoto who, with 
Hopama's recipes (including terrific lomi lomi salmon), is keeping the 
traditional foods of Paradise alive. 
</P>
<P>
For breakfast, the Portuguese sausage comes with eggs and either rice and 
tsukemono (Japanese pickles) or hash browns and toast. Laulau here is wrapped 
in spinach leaves which many people prefer to the more bitter, but authentic, 
taro. And if you've never tried Hawaii's national noodle dish, saimin, Paradise 
can give you a delectable introduction. In saimin, Chinese-style chewy wheat 
noodles come floating in a Japanese-inspired broth, garnished with Chinese char 
siu pork and Japanese fishcake. Other topping choices can include Spam, tempura 
or Portuguese sausage. Also, try Paradise's won ton min; it's similar to 
saimin, but with won tons added. 
</P>
<P>
 Paradise Okazu-Ya, 1631 W. Carson St., Torrance, (213) 328-5345. Open 
Tues.-Thurs. 8 a.m.-7 p.m.; Sat. 7 a.m.-4 p.m.; Sun. 7 a.m.-2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 A common feature in Hawaiian cafes is a large steam table. You would think 
that such a fixture of school cafeterias would mean soggy vegetables and tired 
meat. But the steam table is part of the Hawaiian okazu tradition, and at Aloha 
Delights the food rarely languishes. Here, the vegetables are crisp and the 
meats still moist. And customers enjoy pondering their selections with the food 
in full view. There might be stewed chicken in a soy-based sauce, Filipino 
longaniza (rich, thumb-sized sausages), Chinese-style vegetables and pinakbet, 
a Filipino vegetable dish. There are also well-crafted laulau, lomi lomi and 
kalua pig (baked pork). No national chain can match the made-from-scratch 
quality of these dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Aloha Delights, W. 1648 Carson St. Unit F, (Carson-Western Shopping Center) 
Torrance, (213) 328-9553. Open Mon.-Sat. 11 a.m.-7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Seats are precious on weekends at Harry's Aloha Chop Suey, which among Los 
Angeles' Hawaiians, is an institution. On Saturday afternoons, patrons line up 
for one of Harry's six tables, but few mind the wait -- Harry's customers use 
the time to exchange jokes and gossip. 
</P>
<P>
As the restaurant name might suggest, Harry's food has a certain nostalgic 
quality -- chop suey has long gone out of fashion. Harry's also is the only 
place I know that serves Hawaiian fried chicken. Each piece has a fresh, 
crunchy exterior, is moist inside, and has a flavor reminiscent of sweet soy 
sauce. Saimin and won ton min come steaming in huge bowls with Harry's fine 
char siu pork. Besides the usual Hawaiian dishes, you can get Chinese-style 
braised pigs feet, kau yuke (pot roast pork), or pork and cabbage braised with 
shrimp sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry's Aloha Chop Suey, 1721 W. Redondo Beach Blvd., Gardena (213) 324-4231. 
Open Wed.-Sun. 11 a.m.-8 p.m.; Mon. 11 a.m.-2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 On its menu, Maui Boy claims to serve the biggest laulau in town. I can't 
confirm this, but the laulau is large and freshly made. Maui Boy wraps its pork 
and fish bundles with the traditional taro leaves. Hawaiians eat this with 
plenty of rice to cut the taro's sharp taste. With your laulau and rice you can 
select poi, a scoop of macaroni salad or little dish of lomi lomi salmon. Poi 
and lomi are also sold separately by the half pint. 
</P>
<P>
Kalua pork, another specialty, is salted and baked (as though in a pit oven) 
until it falls apart before you can lift your fork. On alternating weekends, 
Maui Boy serves beef curry stew or Yankee beef stew -- it's the New England 
influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Maui Boy, 16208 Crenshaw Blvd. Gardena (213) 327-8566. Open Tues.-Sat. 11 
a.m.-8 p.m.; Sun. noon-6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Japanese introduced teriyaki to the islands it was a plain, sweetened 
soy sauce used as a grilling glaze. Hawaiian teriyaki today is a cross-cultural 
marinade that includes Chinese and Korean touches, and Aloha Teriyaki has the 
one of best I've found. It's a robust sauce made right in the shop with fresh 
garlic, ginger and sesame oil. Then it's brushed on the meats, either 
good-quality lean beef or skinless chicken. As the meat grills, the sauce 
caramelizes. You can also get kalua pork, taro-wrapped laulau, lomi lomi, 
saimin and bountiful bowls of won ton min garnished with vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 Aloha Teriyaki, 4834 Rosecrans Ave., Hawthorne, (213) 644-2330. Open Mon.-Fri. 
10:30 a.m.-8:30 p.m.; Sat. 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the pizza and cookie stands at the gargantuan Del Amo Fashion Center, 
Aloha Chicken serves authentic Hawaiian foods and shaved ice cones. Lomi lomi 
at this modest shop is fresh and clean tasting. The teriyaki chicken is no 
slouch either. The rendition of laulau is fine, and Aloha Chicken offering a 
wonderful array of fresh fruit salads and fresh fruit blender drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 Aloha Chicken, 216-B Del Amo Fashion Center, Torrance, (213) 542-8052. Open 
Mon.-Fri. 9:30 a.m.-9:30 p.m.; Sat. 9:30 a.m.-7 p.m.; Sun. 10 a.m.-6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Ishigo, a tiny Japanese-Hawaiian bakery, specializes in delicate layer cakes. 
The best are passion fruit, guava or haupia (coconut). The cakes' whispery 
light layers are filled with a mixture of fresh whipped cream, butter cream and 
mashed fruit. They come in various sizes, from a simple round to sheets 
measuring 16-by-24 inches. Another good choice is the orange chiffon with 
macadamia nut cake. 
</P>
<P>
 Ishigo Bakery, 15934 S. Western Ave., Gardena, (213) 327-6388. Open Tues.-Sat. 
7 a.m.-6 p.m.; Sun. 8:30 a.m.-4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most famous name in Hawaiian foods on the mainland is King's, 
manufacturer of the Hawaiian-Portugese sweetbread sold in supermarkets. King's 
recently opened a branch of its famous Hawaiian Bakery Restaurant in Torrance. 
The large family-style establishment has the feeling of a mid-range hotel 
coffee shop. The food does, too; most dishes are Hawaiian in name only. 
Breakfast is the most Hawaiian meal here. There is a decent Portuguese sausage 
omelet with Hawaiian potatoes, teriyaki steak and eggs, or Hawaiian-French 
toast made with the Portuguese bread and coconut syrup on the side. 
</P>
<P>
In King's huge bakery, sparkling cases are filled with exotica: macadamia nut 
cream pie with real whipped cream, and hukilau cake, an elaborate fruit and nut 
concoction rimmed with swirls of jelly-filled sponge cake. But like many items, 
the mandarin orange mousse had a commercially-manufactured quality. And while 
the Hawaiian guava and passion fruit cakes were passable, they didn't live up 
to the ones at Ishigo bakery. 
</P>
<P>
 King's Hawaiian Bakery Restaurant, 2808 W. Sepulveda Blvd., Torrance, (213) 
530-0050. Open Sun.-Thurs. 5:30 a.m.-10 p.m.; Fri.-Sat. 5:30 a.m.-11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Nouvelle-Hawaiian is the desired effect at the Paradise Beach Club in the 
Century City Marketplace. Saimin comes in a light, tart broth topped with enoki 
mushrooms and a julienne of fresh vegetables. Teriyaki steak is briefly 
grilled, then fanned out on a bed of baby lettuce sauced with black sesame seed 
dressing. Huli huli chicken comes on a plater with roasted yams and crunchy 
vegetables. Maui onion rings are crisp. And there's Lappert's sorbet and ice 
cream, including the popular passion fruit flavor, flown in from Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Paradise Beach Club, 10250 Santa Monica Blvd., Century City, (213) 203-0841. 
Open 11 a.m.-midnight, daily.

AT BAHOOKA: TIKI DREAMS AND DEMON RUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Of course, Polynesian cuisine, as we know it, has nothing to do with laulau, 
poi or lomi lomi salmon. Think instead of plastic parrots glowing in the dim 
light of a hundred hurricane lanterns, or the reeling sensation caused by too 
many Flaming Puku-Puku Bowls bought on a forged ID. Think rumaki and flagstone 
waterfalls, fried shrimp and bamboo. If you grew up on Virgin Zombies and 
candy-sweet spareribs, you know what I mean. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty years ago, every neighborhood had at least one tiki-bar, built, I think, 
to slake the tropical thirsts of men who had served in the far-Pacific theaters 
of W.W. II. James Michener and Thor Heyerdahl cleaned up on '50s tikimania; so 
did Trader Vic and Don the Beachcomber. The most elaborate bars featured hula 
shows or giant volcanoes that erupted every hour or so; the food, when it 
existed, tended toward the coco shrimp and the pu pu platter. Lengthy drink 
menus described, in florid pre-AA prose, exactly how a Suffering Bastard or a 
Head Shrinker would anesthetize your date, and the drinks in question were 
invariably served in a coconut or something, with two straws, a parasol and a 
flaming crouton. 
</P>
<P>
But like drive-ins and Art Deco office buildings, most local tiki-bars were 
demolished or retooled in the '70s and '80s, followed too late by hip 
nostalgia. (If everybody who collected Martin Denny records or Hawaiian shirts 
had gone out for a Missionaries' Downfall every so often, the places would've 
survived.) Countless Kelbos and Don the Beachcombers closed, the Torches was 
razed for condos, the Islander became the briefly tony 385 North, and the Luau 
on Rodeo Drive, where three generations of Beverly Hills High School students 
purchased their first illicit drink, was replaced by the world's most expensive 
mini-mall. Even Trader Vic's had its funky soul remodeled right out of it a 
couple of years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Upscale tiki-revival restaurants might be right around the corner -- I've heard 
of one opening soon in Beverly Hills -- maybe serving kiawe-grilled ono or 
lychee-macadamia creme brulee. But the most interesting tiki-bars were never 
all that wholesome, and it's that scintilla of tawdriness, of otherness from 
home, that makes the experience a bit of an adventure. That's why I take my 
cravings for demon rum to Bahooka, though the drive from Rosemead seems halfway 
to Samoa some nights. 
</P>
<P>
Bahooka is the kind of place you'd expect to find near a scruffy tropical 
seaport, all rusted nautical gear, stolen street signs, and scarred dark wood, 
lit like a Navy-base bar and with more bobbing tropical fish than you'd find in 
a Jacques Cousteau special. Lifeboats hang out back -- after the bar closes on 
a weekend night, you'll always find a giggling kid or two waving from inside of 
one -- and a mysterious board engraved "Joyce Kilmer" is nailed to the rear 
wall: "I think that I shall never see/A tiki lovely as a tree," I guess. A sign 
inside the front door reads "2 IDs Required -- No Swapmeet IDs." There are fish 
in the foyer, fish tanks surrounding three sides of each booth, and fish 
swimming inside the glass-topped bar, but not much fish on the menu, unless you 
count some cod that seems to have swum all the way from Iceland through a sea 
of old oil. 
</P>
<P>
Fish puffs go with a Monsoon or a Jet Pilot or a Flaming Honey Bowl better than 
you could possibly imagine, though the leaden deep-fried balls of food aren't 
anything you'd want to look at by the light of day, and onion rings aren't half 
bad. (Shy away from the "wingettes," by the way) There is no rumaki. Sorry. 
</P>
<P>
When the steel-guitar lowings on the P.A. start to sound good, it's time for a 
Shark's Tooth or a Cobra's Strike. Halfway into one of those, a sticky order of 
Exotic Ribs seems just the thing, because the ribs are moist and kind of tasty 
and soak up a lot of alcohol, and come with fries, sweet baked yams or 
cobbettes. The cobbettes, definitely the cobbettes. You can also get teriyaki 
chicken breast, which is sort of dry, ham with sweet 'n' sour sauce, roast beef 
or fried golf balls of shrimp, but you won't. What will happen is that your 
date will suck up the last of his or her Jolly Roger Bowl and carve your 
initials in the booth. Don't worry, it's happened before. 
</P>
<P>
 Bahooka, 4501 N. Rosemead Blvd., Rosemead, (818) 285-1241. Lunch and dinner 
daily. American Express, MasterCard, Visa accepted. Full bar. Reservations not 
necessary.

As for Rakolta's complaints about gratuitous sex, women in garter belts, no

ding-dongs. TV is not just going down the tubes . . . it is dropping into the 
outhouse hole!

Kudos to Rakolta for her stand against "Married" and other offensive television 
programming. I don't know how she watched the show for seven weeks (according 
to a Times article). I have seen one episode of "Married," and that was enough 
for me. Inane, repulsive and downright boring.

WRONGHEADED OSCAR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jack Mathews' article on the motion picture academy's documentary committee was 
too kind (" 'The Thin Blue Line': Justice for All?," March 12). Everybody finds 
fault with one or another of the academy's choices from time to time, but only 
in the documentary area are the choices so wrongheaded year after year. 
</P>
<P>
The committee members don't understand rock 'n' roll, so they make no 
distinction between run-of-the-mill "rockumentaries" and remarkable work like 
"Bring on the Night" and "Stop Making Sense," both ignored. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of nurturing the form they hold sway over, they exhibit a snobbery that 
guarantees that the vast Oscar-night audience will almost never have heard of 
any of the nominated documentaries. Any film with a theatrical release -- such 
as "28 Up," "Shoah" or the George Stevens bio -- seems automatically denied a 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
And, finally, they make the mistake of confusing subject with quality. If a 
film maker is on the "correct" side of an important issue he can be nominated 
no matter how botched or bland his picture's execution. 
</P>
<P>
If the academy can't find some members who can do a better job of judging 
documentaries, it would almost do the genre a favor to discontinue the award.

NAVAJO JEWELRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM BURCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE COLORS OF the desert sky and the magic landscape of the Southwest are 
reflected in the Navajo jewelry made of silver and turquoise. Because Navajo 
artisans made it primarily for their own and their family's adornment and for 
religious ceremonies, each piece is unique. 
</P>
<P>
From earliest days, the jewelry was fashioned with primitive tools. The 
artisans used a hand drill for turquoise, and silversmiths worked with the 
simplest of equipment. Today, techniques are much the same. The forge was a 
square structure of stones and adobe mud; the bellows were of sheepskin, and 
the anvil was simply a hard stone, later a piece of scrap metal from a plow or 
wagon. The mold for making casts was often a piece of volcanic tuff, a light 
pumice-like stone found on the reservation, and molds were greased with mutton 
tallow. Charcoal came from local pinon and juniper branches. 
</P>
<P>
The art of making silver began in earnest soon after the tribe started life on 
the reservation, though it is probable that the Navajo had worked in metal as 
early as the 18th Century. By the 1880s, tribal artisans were mounting 
turquoise (found in mines near Santa Fe) in silver, often with the Spanish 
flair they had learned from the Mexicans. At first, the silver in dimes and 
quarters was used. When this was prohibited, the Mexican peso was used; later 
traders provided silver slugs and sheets of silver. The metal was hammered by 
hand, the silversmith singing as he worked. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the designs were of Spanish origin, such as the squash blossom, which 
in reality is the pomegranate blossom. Typical artifacts include the naja (a 
crescent pendant hung from bridles), the ketoh (a wrist guard to protect from 
the snap of a bow string), buckles, bracelets, "squash-blossom" necklaces, 
rings, pins, earrings (worn by both men and women), buttons and special jewelry 
such as "mother-in-law" bells, powder horns and tobacco canteens and, of 
course, the popular concha belt discs. 
</P>
<P>
All together this jewelry forms a Native American heritage of exquisite design, 
and it is sought after by collectors all over the country. United States 
cavalry officers in the 19th Century brought an enormous amount of Native 
American artifacts to the East, including Navajo blankets and jewelry. Today it 
is sometimes easier to find antique pieces in Massachusetts than in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the best sources for the finest in antique and contemporary Navajo 
jewelry is the Fairmont Trading Co. in South Pasadena, by appointment: (818) 
796-3609. Some examples of Navajo work in its many forms may be found at the 
following: Silver Man Gallery West in Brentwood; Taos Indian Trading Co. and 
Hemisphere, both in Santa Monica; Native American Art Gallery in Venice; 
Ortega's Capistrano Trading Post in San Juan Capistrano; Hopitu Indian Arts in 
La Jolla Shores, and American Indian Store and Apache Trading Post, both in San 
Diego.

CITY SLICKERS HAVE always yearned to return to nature: not to rough it on roots 
and berries, mind you, but to indulge in romantic fantasy. Marie Antoinette and 
her attendants, for example, fled the formality of Versailles by play-acting as 
milkmaids and shepherdesses at Le Hameau (the Hamlet) -- a sanitized, 
Disneyland version of a farm village on the palace grounds. And in New York, a 
century ago, when the Vanderbilts, Whitneys and Rockefellers weren't summering 
at Newport, R.I., "cottages," they'd migrate to sprawling great camps in the 
Adirondack Mountains. Inspired by the primeval pine forests, the camps boasted 
log walls, porch railings and gables fashioned from branches, fireplaces made 
of rough stones pulled from nearby brooks and even spiral staircases winding 
around a tree trunk. 
</P>
<P>
The style trickled down in the first decades of this century; soon even 
families of modest means set up summer housekeeping in bungalows in the 
Catskills. Old-timers in Old Forge, N.Y., writes Craig Gilborn in "Nineteenth 
Century Furniture," recall hickory furniture arriving by the boxcar, bound for 
hotels and places with alliterative names like Camp Kill Kare. To meet this 
demand, factories such as the Indiana-based Old Hickory Furniture Co. produced 
tables, settees and rockers by the thousands. There, men bent immature saplings 
into shape on metal frames. Using the company's 1901-patented bark-splitting 
machine, women and children cut the bark into strips, soaked it to make it 
pliable and weaved it into chair bottoms and backs. (Old Hickory's 1922 
catalogue lists 120 items, from a $4.25 dining chair to a $300 summerhouse 12 
feet in diameter with floor and shingled roof.) 
</P>
<P>
Intellectuals in the arts and crafts movement (exemplified by Greene &amp; 
Greene's Gamble House in Pasadena) were won over by the product's "personality 
and air of definite sincerity," as the Craftsman magazine put it. Today, we too 
cherish Adirondack furniture for its "look of the hand" -- the perfect foil to 
our otherwise high-tech houses, filled with CDs, VCRs and PCs. (This is not the 
Adirondack chair commonly recalled and so widely popular and available now in 
stores and catalogues.) The woodsy pieces still wistfully conjure that 
delightful, incongruous moment in America's history when robber barons, attired 
in white tie and tails, sat at tables set with linen, silver and crystal, 
amidst knotty, log-finished walls. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Mack offers a light, lacy collection of rustic twig furniture updating 
the klunky, massive pieces made for the Adirondack great camps 100 years ago. 
Mack's prices range from $600, for a bark chair, to the peeled and polished 
chair auctioned last year at the American Crafts Museum for $4,000. A 
self-styled "twigmeister," he eschews nails, instead fastening the old-country 
way with mortise and tenon, drilling with an antique hand auger. He culls the 
saplings himself from Sterling Forest in Upstate New York or from clients' 
land. More than just the grain markings of ordinary milled-wood furniture, his 
twig creations bear the imprint of a grazing deer, a curious woodpecker or a 
hail of hunter's buckshot. 
</P>
<P>
Authenic Adirondack pieces show up only occasionally in Southern California 
antiques stores. La Lune manufactures bent-willow furniture similar to this 
type of Adirondack furniture. It is available through designers and architects 
from JANUS et Cie in the Pacific Design Center, Los Angeles. Catalogues of 
Daniel Mack's rustic furnishings can be seen at Nomad in West Hollywood and at 
Couturier Gallery in Los Angeles.

ITALY'S LUSH "GARDEN rooms," copied by the 16th-Century British, brought 
year-round summer to drafty castles. Their popularity grew for 300 years, and 
even the humblest Victorian cottages had conservatories filled with ferns and 
flowers. During the Depression, America's sun parlors -- costly to cool and 
heat -- were boarded up. Ironically, the 1970s energy crisis redeemed them. New 
glass windows were leakproof, airtight, insulated, glare-free, energy 
efficient. Because solar-heated indoor gardens increase property values and 
look terrific, sales have been booming ever since. 
</P>
<P>
England's prestigious, cedar-framed, fully vented and guttered Amdega 
Conservatories in octagonal and gabled Victorian styles are now available 
locally with high-vaulting, circle-top or Gothic-arch windows, leaded panes, 
double doors, sunscreen blinds, ornamental crests and finials. Four Seasons 
Greenhouses makes bowed Georgian enclosures, Tudor arches and adjustable-pitch 
sun rooms but is best known for curving glass atriums ranging in size from 
bump-out herb-garden windows to block-long storefronts. Special features: 
environmental heat-control glass, heating/cooling fans, self-cleaning interior 
and exterior drainage, power-track shades and half-round sashes. 
</P>
<P>
C-Thru Industries' curved glass and acrylic atriums fit beneath most eaves 
without roof remodeling. Patented extras include continuous electric-socket 
baseboards, screened sliding windows and adjustable roof shutters. 
</P>
<P>
California Solariums come in many styles and colors, single and double heights, 
with varied venting, draining, lighting and shading systems, adjustable 
barrel-vault frames and sun-screen films. Solarium Systems builds greenhouse 
additions and ultramodern free-standing glass gazebos. 
</P>

VACATIONING WITHOUT YOUR SPOUSE: PLEASING FOR A FEW; PERILOUS FOR THE MANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARVEY L. RUBEN MD, Dr. Ruben, an associate professor of psychiatry at Yale 
University, is the author of Super Marriage (Bantam Books). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your marriage isn't doomed if you take separate vacations, but the practice may 
signal rough sledding ahead -- not for everyone, but for the majority. 
</P>
<P>
Let me explain, because counseling couples is my job. Immediately there comes 
to mind a couple named Ed and Leigh who take separate vacations several times a 
year (he's a busy orthopedic surgeon, and she's an involved mother of two 
daughters who also operates an epicurean shop). Leigh isn't into salmon fishing 
and ocean sailing, Ed's favorite activities. Ed gets bored visiting boutiques 
in Paris or Rome or browsing through antique shops in New Orleans' French 
Quarter. So for the past 10 years they have vacationed separately several times 
each year. Yet their marriage still thrives despite these risky separations. Ed 
and Leigh are able to weather the potential perils because they have so much 
more going for them. (They are good friends, even though they have these 
differing interests). 
</P>
<P>
So have Chip and Tess, who -- after 24 years of marriage and three daughters -- 
find themselves locked into separate vacations because of differing interests 
and Chip's being a workaholic. Tess, a high school arts teacher, thrives on 
Manhattan junkets several times a year. She takes one or two of the girls and 
overdoses for several days on theater, museums and galleries -- not Chip's 
favorite pastimes. An accountant, Chip enjoys wheeling and dealing, putting 
together joint ventures, limited partnerships and buying and selling property. 
He enjoys Tess's absences because he can stay at the office, working until the 
wee hours, and no one complains. Chip rarely takes a vacation, and when he 
does, it's usually a trip to attend a family function. This isn't ideal, but it 
works for them and their marriage is surviving. 
</P>
<P>
For Sue and Ned, the situation is slightly different. Their separate vacations 
occur because of his penchant for golf and poker and her love of health spas. 
Ned is a jeweler, and Sue is an interior designer. Twice a year, throughout 
their 35 years together, Ned has traveled to Florida for a week of golf and 
poker while Sue goes off to a plush beauty farm. Still, they occasionally fly 
together to Europe and take Caribbean cruises, and they visit family in New 
England every year. 
</P>
<P>
What's common to these couples is that they all had different interests before 
they married -- interests that they continued to pursue. When they return to 
each other after these mutual absences, they are invigorated. They miss each 
other during their separations. They call frequently. They think of each other 
often while they're apart. Their love is intensified by the experience. 
</P>
<P>
However that's not true for many couples. Divorce rates have soared in this 
country during the last two decades. After 22 years of psychiatric practice in 
working with couples experiencing troubled marriages, I'm here to testify to 
the dangers of such solo jaunts. 
</P>
<P>
One problem is that the desire for a separate holiday often is a harbinger of 
turbulent seas ahead, a sign that the marriage is teetering precariously. A 
good love relationship is like a three-legged stool: One leg is the erotic or 
sexual-physical aspect; the second leg represents the psychological aspects of 
romance and affection; the third leg should be the mutual intellectual sharing 
of friendship. Separate vacations may weaken the stool or even cause it to 
topple. 
</P>
<P>
Couples take separate vacations for any number of reasons. They may have 
different interests, such as Ed and Leigh or Chip and Tess. Or it may be that 
their friendship has simply dissolved and with it has gone their sex life. But 
not always. Indeed not. Curiously, I know couples who, though they share little 
affection, nevertheless still enjoy a torrid sex life. Figure that one out. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of a busy week, especially in the lives of today's typical 
two-career family, couples find easy excuses to avoid spending much time 
together and even more ways to avoid sexual intimacy. A week or two of 
togetherness may be more than either partner can tolerate. So they use separate 
vacations as a safety valve to avoid confronting the inevitable. They 
rationalize their behavior by claiming a difference of interests that requires 
solitary forays. Unfortunately, they don't miss one another. They don't call or 
write often. Their love is not intensified when their vacations are over. At 
times, they'd prefer not to return, period. These differing interests are, of 
course, serious signs of growing rapidly apart. 
</P>
<P>
This occurred with Mike and Ellen. After five years of marriage, Mike, a social 
worker in a state mental health center, developed an interest in Far Eastern 
philosophies and meditation. Ellen, an emergency-room nurse, found Mike's 
pastime boring. So when Mike began to use his vacations to attend conferences 
and visit different ashrams, she didn't object. Regretfully, the more involved 
Mike became, the less they had in common and the less they did together. 
Ultimately, because of the separate trips and different interests, their 
relationship ended in divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Boredom is another factor that can lead to marital holiday solitude. You don't 
enjoy being with your spouse. You're bored. You need some excitement in your 
life, and you think you'll find it on the beach, on the ski slopes or on the 
golf course -- by yourself. But you learn that being by yourself isn't enough. 
In order to find the excitement lacking in your marriage, you may team up on 
holiday with single or divorced friends or even other married partners who are 
vacationing without their spouses and who are as interested as you are in new 
companionships. And therein lies the danger. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph, circulation manager of a small newspaper, no longer felt challenged by 
his job, and after seven years with his wife, Claire, a legal secretary, he was 
bored with his marriage. They didn't have fun anymore. When he suggested they 
learn to ski as a means of developing a new interest, Claire wasn't interested. 
As a result, Mike went skiing alone and literally ran head-on (while skiing) 
into a woman from the same city who was having similar problems with her 
marriage. Returning home, they began running in the park together. You guessed 
it. Eventually they got divorces. The last I heard they were jogging several 
miles a day together and loving every step of it. 
</P>
<P>
Even if you are 100% faithful on your separate holiday, the potential for 
damaging your marital relationship is great. If your spouse grudgingly allows 
you to go, his or her trust and faith in you may be severely shaken. Separate 
vacations are high on the list of activities that promote jealousy. Even with 
nothing more on your mind than touring churches and cathedrals, the possibility 
that your partner will be envious or jealous is very great, particularly if 
your spouse is home hassling with children, dealing with a leaking roof and 
paying bills while you go gallivanting. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most destructive forces in a marriage is jealousy. Once it occurs, 
it is insidious. It grows and expands unless successfully put to rest. It has 
the ability to destroy a relationship more rapidly than any other factor. 
Living with a jealous person is the pits. You are constantly scrutinized. 
Everything you do is subject to misinterpretation. The trouble with jealousy is 
that once you have been tried and found guilty of a crime you didn't commit, 
you feel as though you might as well commit it. That leads to what we 
psychiatrists call the self-fulfilling prophecy. Our spouse's accusations 
promote the exact behavior that he or she fears. 
</P>
<P>
That's what happened to Jack and Millie. During the 15 years of their marriage, 
Jack had always gone hunting and fishing with his buddies while Millie stayed 
home with their children. Finally Millie began to comment about what Jack and 
his friends probably did in the evenings. She started believing her own 
suspicions and, unable to convince Millie of his innocence, Jack became 
increasingly frustrated. Finally, during one of his hunting-and-fishing trips, 
he pulled off a one-night stand. Consumed by guilt, he confessed to Millie -- 
not a very wise move, perhaps, but it led them to recognize their problems and 
to seek the therapy that saved their marriage. 
</P>
<P>
To repeat, the most obvious peril of separate vacations is that infidelity will 
more than likely occur. In other words, if you're bored or unhappy with your 
partner and spend a restful week on the beach or at a resort with others, it is 
far, far easier to stray from the marital bed. The fact is, it's almost an 
invitation. 
</P>
<P>
Guilt, I must repeat, enters the picture when you begin experiencing qualms, 
even while you're enjoying your separate vacation. You begin to experience less 
joy. Then animosity sets in when you return home. I can recall case after case 
in which this occurs. In other words, you're locked onto a shattering collision 
course. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is that a first-rate marriage, a super-marriage, is based on 
love, respect, trust, commitment, mature intimacy, friendship, communication, 
flexibility and tolerance, a sense of humor and the ability to resolve your 
differences. Although a marriage may survive, separate vacations rarely (if 
ever) improve a relationship. It's better to recognize the problem and try to 
deal with it than to flee on separate holidays.

A PRIMAL PIECE OF PARADISE

<TEXT>
<P>
Few places on earth match the awesome beauty of Kauai's Na Pali coast with its 
thunderous waves and precipitous cliffs that fall away to the Pacific -- to 
deserted beaches and hidden coves. A special place on a special island. Beyond 
its shores appears the other face of Hawaii, with condominiums and high-rise 
resorts. Na Pali, though, is blessed with a serenity these islands knew only in 
the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Bathed by trade winds, Na Pali is a world unchanged through the centuries, a 
world that remains silent save for the voice of the wind and the explosion of 
waves against lava that rose from the ocean floor, eons ago, to form the 
islands of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Aloft in a helicopter, vacationers study Kauai's valleys and jungles that 
reach to the very shores of Na Pali. The copters cruise above jungles without a 
single trail -- jungles that have never known the footstep of man. Waterfalls 
spill furiously. This is only a few miles from Hanalei and that magnificent 
white strand, Lumahai Beach, where Hollywood came to film "South Pacific." 
Precisely where Lumahai ends, the earth turns green with taro patches and rice 
paddies, and shortly thereafter the Na Pali coast begins, blue and green waters 
slamming against ancient cliffs, leaving behind white trails of foam. Coves dug 
by millions of years of ocean anger remain peaceful, untouched. All this is 
woven into the tapestry of Kauai's Na Pali coast. JERRY HULSE

RIDING THE RAILS FROM KHABAROVSK TO IRKUTSK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRIS SCHNEIDER, Schneider is a staff photographer of The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's been more than a year since I traveled on the Trans-Siberian Express, but 
I can still picture the faces of the people I encountered and feel the rhythm 
of the train as it bumped and swayed its way west through the mountains and 
meadows of summertime Siberia. In many ways, this was no ordinary vacation. It 
was my first time in the Soviet Union and Mongolia and it was a constant series 
of surprises. We flew from Moscow to Tashkent to Khabarovsk via Aeroflot before 
boarding the train for a three-day trip to Irkutsk (known as the Paris of 
Siberia). After that, we traveled Air Mongolia on a trip to Ulan Bator that 
included almost a week in the capital during Mongolia's independence day 
festivities and two days in the Gobi Desert sleeping in a yurt. We flew back to 
Irkutsk for a few more days and then on to Leningrad, where we ended our stay. 
</P>
<P>
But for me the train ride was the most memorable and satisfying part of all. It 
was like being invited to dinner at somebody's home after you've been warned 
that the food will be good but your hosts will probably be crotchety and you'd 
better be on your best behavior. Then you get there and discover that if you 
simply show a little enthusiasm, you can be yourself, overstay your welcome and 
even get dessert. 
</P>
<P>
The warnings I had gotten -- from books or articles or people who had been 
there -- said that photography on the train was strictly forbidden and the 
Soviets didn't want to be disturbed. The articles advised leaving any cameras 
in your compartment whenever you ventured out in order to avoid the wrath of 
the ruling conductresses or the reluctant passengers. To a photographer, that's 
hearing: "Feel free to go anywhere on the train, but you have to keep your eyes 
closed." 
</P>
<P>
After my first walk through a few of the railroad cars I knew that would never 
work. First, there were the faces: warm and interesting, peasant faces with 
eyes that betrayed their curiosity of strangers, especially a stranger wearing 
funky Western clothes, carrying cameras and grinning like a fool (Soviets 
exchange smiles with strangers with about the same ease as New Yorkers trapped 
in the subway at rush hour). 
</P>
<P>
What I could see of the compartments, which slept four (unlike our car, which 
was the only first or "soft class" car -- with two beds per compartment), 
revealed little "homes," with each one taking on the warmth of a living room or 
bedroom for the duration of the trip. Flowers brought from home were set on the 
window-side tables that were also laden with homemade food and drink. Most 
Soviets didn't eat in the diner as we did, but stayed in their cars or 
compartments. Many wore their pajamas as they sat and ate, read, knitted or 
played chess. 
</P>
<P>
I seemed to be the only one constantly roaming up and down the aisles, but I 
felt as if I was in a small town and only had three days to explore it. 
</P>
<P>
I was hoping to be invited in. It took some persistence, and many walks through 
the train with my cameras so people could get used to me. But eventually, armed 
with a few phonetically written Russian phrases, some lipsticks I could give 
away to soften the sometimes ornery conductresses, and a lot of motivation, the 
compartment doors started to open. 
</P>
<P>
These photographs are the treasured results. 
</P>
<P>
We never spoke much. I didn't know their names, but the warmth was genuine, in 
both directions. So meet my friends. Their photographs prove my most important 
travel advice: Never listen to anybody's warnings of doom or gloom. Discover on 
your own where welcome mats await you.

MAPPING THE ROUTES TO SYBARITIC SHOPS THAT SPARE NO EXPENSE IN QUENCHING THE 
WORLD-CLASS SHOPPER'S THIRST FOR TREASURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER MERIN, Sydicated columnist Merin writes about shopping around the 
world and has authored books on the subject.

<TEXT>

Glimmering gold, shimmering silk, dazzling diamonds, fabulous furs and other 
luxuries have inspired travelers since the time of Marco Polo. Today's 
world-class shoppers know that top purveyors of first-class fineries, the likes 
of Hermes, Patek Philippe and Fendi, sell magnificent one-of-a-kind and /or 
exclusive items and offer their latest styles in their opulent flagship shops. 
Patrons of the world's haute salons have the satisfaction of being surrounded 
by glamour and luxury beyond compare. Pay a king's ransom for fineries and 
expect to be treated like royalty. That's part of the luxury of buying luxury 
goods. Such shoppers view the world as a treasure hunt. The map outlines 
merchandise rather than nations, and stars locate splendid emporiums rather 
than capital cities. Personal preferences determine individual itineraries of 
acquisition, but luxury-shopping sprees require a spirit of adventure and 
substantial globe-trotting. On any world-class shopper's map a cluster of 
starred shops centers on Paris, especially on Rue du Faubourg Saint Honore. As 
playwright Jean Giraudoux said, "Faubourg Saint Honore is 1,500 meters of 
sidewalks, 200 boutiques, with not one single lapse in good taste." A list of 
this street's designer boutiques is a Who's Who of high-ticket fashion: Lanvin, 
Lapidus, Jitrois, Cardin, Saint Laurent, Chloe, Lagerfeld, Feraud, Perris, 
Rykiel, Carven, Scherrer. 
</P>
<P>
Faubourg Saint Honore fashion moguls dress boutique windows to kill, but the 
street's most splendid and opulent showcases belong to Hermes (No. 24), 
purveyor of the world's most prestigious leather goods and of haute snob style. 
</P>
<P>
Hermes offers Kelly and Constance bags, glorious silk scarfs that frame famous 
faces or are framed to fill walls of palatial homes, gloves to grace any 
outfit, a herd of saddles and equestrian equipage, organizers costing enough to 
make all dates precious events, street and home attire almost too posh to put 
on mere mortals' backs, plus attache cases, belts, wallets, dog leashes and cat 
collars, super-sized steamer trunks (costing five figures and up) or diminutive 
chewing gum cases (merely $125 and up). There are sumptuous silk ties, robes 
and pajamas, cashmere shawls, jewelry, scents and mink-lined raincoats. Hermes 
has elevated humble umbrellas to the level of objets d'art, with prices that 
might feed a family of eight. 
</P>
<P>
Not open to the general public, Hermes' top-floor museum has fitted leather 
chests, saddles, and other accessories that belonged to the rich, famous and 
influential of yesteryear. Use your influence to get a tour of this treasury 
for a priceless treat that's free. 
</P>
<P>
Faubourg Saint Honore's deluxe shoe sellers include Jourdan, Steiger, Kelian 
and Fratelli Rossetti, but most luxurious of all is John Lobb-Hermes, a 
magnificent leather-scented salon on Hermes' second floor. This custom 
shoemaker, previously affiliated with the London Lobb, supports the feet of men 
whose stand on issues influences world events, along with presidents of 
republics, chairmen of conglomerates, monarchs, magnates and movie stars. 
Custom-shoe prices at John Lobb-Hermes start at $2,000 and soar with added 
tassels or trim. Nevertheless, the shoes are in such demand that it takes about 
a year to fill a first order, and longstanding clients are limited to one pair 
per month. Nothing beats the quality or comfort. Each element is sewn, rather 
than glued, into place. Classic and conservative styles are customized with 
color and material ranging from calf to ostrich, shark, kangaroo and other 
exotica. 
</P>
<P>
Women's riding boots and walking shoes are made at John Lobb-Hermes, but a full 
range of women's custom-made styles is found at Michel, 12 Avenue Montaigne. 
Michel's shop is simple; the luxury is in perfect shoes and accommodating 
service, not the surroundings. Each season, Michel features 80 handsomely 
conservative shoe styles, including women's sturdy but feminine pumps and men's 
oxfords, with the finest leathers in a rich palette of colors, priced at $1,200 
and up. Michel will copy your favorite old shoes, and Michel files your last 
for future purchases.

Ritzy Avenue Montaigne and environs are where Ungaro, Mori, Dior, Laroche, 
Ricci, Chanel, Givenchy, Balenciaga, Balmain and other designers of note have 
haute couture salons, with tickets on clothes beginning at about $5,000 and 
soaring from there. Have your concierge telephone to make an appointment for 
you at these salons; otherwise you won't get the full show. 
</P>

The last word in ultra-refined, conservative, made-to-order suits for men (and 
women) is Charvet (2 Place Vendome). This splendid haberdashery has outfitted 
distinguished businessmen since 1838. Sales personnel are sophisticated and 
personable -- a rare but appealing combination. The ground floor's colorful 
carrousels display thousands of magnificent silk ties arranged by hue, with a 
dizzying variety of stripes and dots. The women's silk squares and 
cashmere-silk shawls designed by Raoul Dufy and other famous artists are 
fabulous, and Charvet's colognes sealed in Champagne bottles are delightful. 
The second, third and fourth floors have exquisite ready-to-wear suits, shirts 
and lounge wear. The fifth floor is the bastion of the made-to-measure 
customer. Here, amid dozens of bolts of cotton in solid colors or striped, and 
rolls of exquisite cashmeres and woolens in conservative colors, you are fitted 
for perfect shirts and suits. After your first order, if measurements don't 
change drastically, Charvet will be your personal mail-order tailor for life. 
Patterns are filed and put to use whenever you need a new supply of shirts or 
suits.

Jewelry shops around Place Vendome rival Versailles in opulence. The glitter of 
gemstones in fabulous tiaras, rings, bracelets, necklaces and objets d'art is 
overwhelming. Cartier has its fabulous "les musts" collection, Van Cleef &amp; 
Arpels offers bejeweled golden chains and Alderbert displays gem-encrusted 
timepieces. 
</P>
<P>
The Paris showcase of Italian jeweler Gianmaria Buccellati (No. 4), a lavishly 
appointed boutique with brocade-covered walls and gilded mirrors, is decorated 
with a menagerie of solid-silver peacocks, pheasants, birds of paradise, cupids 
and other fabulous creatures covered with colorful gems, astonishingly ornate, 
but much too finely detailed to be considered gaudy. Some of these silver 
objects are purely decorative, others hold candles or canapes, or contain punch 
or tea. Silver flatware is similarly ornate, as is gold and silver jewelry set 
with spectacular gems. 
</P>
<P>
Mauboussin (No. 20) has been making unique jewelry since 1827. Three artists 
currently design exquisite pieces combining flawless diamonds with rare, black 
mother-of-pearl in elegant gold settings. Brilliant tear-shaped diamond 
"droplets" are encased in gold and suspended from gold chains. Ornately 
sculpted, gem-encrusted clocks belong on grand marble mantels such as the ones 
on which they are displayed. 
</P>
<P>
Boucheron (No. 26), founded in 1856, offers magnificent hand-fashioned gold 
chains; top-quality gemstones in ornate rings, brooches and pendants, and 
unusual pieces made of leopard wood (rare hardwood with fascinating spot-like 
patterning). Boucheron's real specialty is rock crystal work, including huge, 
smooth, translucent, perfectly shaped bowls accented with inlaid gold and agate 
or lapis designs and finely detailed sculptures of birds or other animals, 
presented in lovely leather boxes. Production is limited to one edition of 
three or four pieces annually. 
</P>
<P>
Chaumet (No. 12), the venerable Parisian joaillier, founded in 1775 and now 
operated by Jean Baptiste (10th generation), has made jewelry and crowns for 
many of Europe's royal families (maquettes are displayed in the museum, call 
for an appointment). The grand salon is for important clients who study jewels 
under the watchful eyes of an 1812 portrait of Marie Louise. Other customers 
are received in adjacent boutiques, one for gold with small gems, the other for 
extraordinary stones, especially pearls and emeralds. Settings are unusual, 
ornate, unique. Chaumet recently acquired Brequet, which produces 1,200 
timepieces per year. Along with atelier and patent came an outstanding 
collection of jewel-encrusted antique clocks and watches, now on display. 
</P>
<P>
But for the best collection of luxury timepieces, head for Geneva. Exclusive 
and probably beyond the budgets of most mortals are investment-quality watches 
by Piaget (40 Rue du Rhone). Production is limited to 15,000 watches a year; 
models with onyx faces and diamond-studded bands cost $287,000 and up; 
18-karat-gold models begin at $9,500. 
</P>
<P>
Vacheron-Constantine, at 1 Rue des Moulins, has made exclusive timepieces since 
1755. Limited-edition contemporary models feature the world's thinnest 
automatic movement, ranging from an understated numberless face with leather 
band ($3,000) to dazzling diamond-faced watches with diamond bands (from 
$130,000). 
</P>
<P>
Patek Philippe (22 Quai du General-Guisan) makes exquisite classics as well as 
"complicated" watches. The most complicated watch, first made to order in 1928, 
features strike gongs to sound the hour, an elapsed-time totalizer, perpetual 
calendar with moon-phase display, split-second chronograph, alarm, sunrise and 
sunset indication, celestial chart for the Northern Hemisphere, equation of 
time, sidereal time and more. All in one watch! Calibre '89, a complicated 
watch debuting this year to mark Patek Philippe's 150th anniversary, has 1,728 
parts, 24 hands, and adjusts itself to leap years. The price is expected to 
exceed $3 million at an upcoming auction. 
</P>
<P>
If you're still working on Rolex, Rado or Baume et Mercier time, go to Bucherer 
(26 Quai du General-Guisan), an elegant wood-paneled shop with sweeping 
stairways and gleaming glass cases filled with fabulous watches and glittering 
jewels. 
</P>
<P>
Milan and Rome compete as the most-starred cities on the shopper's map of 
Italy. Milan's pricey Via Montenapoleone district boasts the flagship boutiques 
of Armani, Versace, Krizia, Missoni, Gigli, Ferre, Soprani and other trendy 
alta moda moguls. Rome has Valentino, Biagiotti and other classics, and the 
fabulous Fendi empire of boutiques on Via Borgognona, where the prestigious 
initial F logo reigns supreme. Fendi stocks leather goods and clothes, shoes 
are sensational, but the firm began and still excels with excellent 
ready-to-wear and made-to-measure furs. Fendi's high-fashion fantasy furs 
(shown at Via Borgognona 39) mix major- and minor-league pelts, such as mink 
with mole or sable with squirrel. The effect is dramatic and so are the prices. 
</P>
<P>
Some luxury shoppers object to wearing fur, but fur fanciers' treasure maps 
highlight Helsinki's fabulous furriers who offer luxurious classic coats in 
finest quality mink, sable, blue and silver fox, muskrat and other pelts, but 
also emphasize innovative design, unusual detailing and playful use of color in 
ready-to-wear or special-order wraps. Tarya Niskanen (Unioninkatu 30) makes 
marvelous mink trench coats with belts and epaulets, stunning ankle-length mink 
coats with detachable patchwork mink shawls fringed with mink tails, and 
exciting mink coats and jackets with brightly colored geometric patterning. 
Peachy-pink full-length fox coat-and-hat ensembles are attention-getters, and 
the mink, fox and muskrat hats and muffs, and ankle-length shearling coats are 
superb. 
</P>
<P>
The Grunstein Boutique (Unioninkatu 27) features fantastic reversible fur and 
leather coats with detachable sleeves and vests, for a layered look and 
versatile wear. Peach, coral, green, blue, gray and lilac patchwork mink, 
raccoon, lamb suede and leather are used to create bold patterns that classify 
these coats as wearable art. 
</P>
<P>
Tua Rahikainen (Kasarmikatu 48) uses sheared muskrat or mink for remarkably 
supple, lightweight and warm coats styled with broad shoulders in bottle green, 
burgundy and other unusual colors. Some models are accented with geometric 
patches of fur in contrasting colors and all are lined with sumptuous silk. 
</P>
<P>
For fabulous silk garments, head for Bangkok. Thai silk's special luminous 
sheen is unsurpassed. The Thai Silk Co., otherwise known as Jim Thompson's, is 
a spacious, gracious emporium in a splendid mansion at 9 Surawong Road. On the 
ground floor, bolts of silk resemble a rainbow of about 200 exotic colors in 
single-ply for clothing, four-ply for draperies and six-ply for upholstery or 
covering walls. There are shimmering ties, pillow covers, place mats, napkins, 
tablecloths, picture frames, handbags, wallets and silk-covered boxes. A 
sweeping teak staircase leads to the fashion floor, with day and evening 
attire: quilted and kimono jackets, blouses, shirts with mother-of-pearl 
buttons, elegant gowns, robes, dresses, pant suits, and "pretzel belts" of 
twisted-silk rope. But best of all, have favorite garments or new designs 
made-to-measure. For the perfect fit, fabulous fabric and excellent 
workmanship, the $500 to $700 ticket for a dress qualifies this as a very 
reasonably priced luxury. 
</P>
<P>
Bangkok's legendary lapidaries sell gemstones by the handful, but rarely offer 
the public exceptional stones or settings. The Orient's most famous jewelry 
designer is in Hong Kong (famous for bargains, but a mecca for luxury shoppers, 
too). Kai-Yin Lo (4-6 On Lan Street or Mezzanine, Peninsula Hotel, Kowloon) 
makes exclusive and exotic-looking jewel-encrusted collars for British royalty, 
Natalia Makarova, Hanae Mori and other famous necks. Kai-Yin uses extraordinary 
semiprecious stones, and her collars are priced at $60,000 and up. She also 
makes opulent hand-beaded or sequined capes, belts and handbags. 
</P>
<P>
First-class, star-sized, show-off hunks of rubies, sapphires, emeralds, 
diamonds and semiprecious stones, set in lavish 18-karat Swiss gold brooches, 
rings, bracelets and necklaces, are available at Trio Pearl Co. (Mezzanine, 
Peninsula Hotel, Kowloon). Trio also has magnificent jade beads for about 
$400,000 or more per strand, as well as high-quality pearls. 
</P>
<P>
The gentle glow of nacre is particularly luminous at Mikimoto (4-5-5 Ginza, 
Chuo-ku) in Tokyo. The great Japanese pearl purveyor sells around the world, 
but keeps a reserve of exceptional pearls and pearl jewelry at this elegant 
Tokyo salon. State-of-the-art single pearls, perfectly rounded, perfectly 
smooth and measuring 8 millimeters and larger, 16-inch strings of 
perfectly-matched 8-millimeter or larger pearls with exquisite gem-encrusted 
clasps, and brooches or pendants with extraordinary pearls in delicate floral 
settings, or clustered with diamonds and other gemstones, are spectacular. 
Gleaming Ma Be pearls come in drop-dead sizes, unusual shapes and magnificent 
settings. Mikimoto's accommodating staff demonstrates how pearls are seeded and 
processed. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo's other luxury goods range from one-of-a-kind traditional lacquerware 
creations to the latest innovations in high-tech electronics. For lacquerware, 
exclusive and expensive Heiando (3-10-11 Nihombashi, Chuo-ku) has collectible 
pieces from all regions of Japan, with antiques and rare works of art on the 
second floor, and bushy (Axis Building, 5-17-1 Roppongi, Minato-ku) sells 
lacquerware furniture and accessories made with old-fashioned methods but 
ultra-contemporary designs, including great red lacquer lounge chairs and 
stunning black lacquer chests of drawers. 
</P>
<P>
For futuristic high-resolution televisions, compact discs, computers, stereo 
and video equipment, games and gadgets, portables, miniatures, super-sized 
screens and other luxury electronics not yet available in the United States, 
visit Sony, Hitachi, Toshiba, Technics, Mitsubishi and other top manufacturer 
showcases on the Ginza. These high-tech havens are high-ticket gamerooms that 
keep you entertained for hours. Or head for the Akihabara district where dozens 
of multistory electronics shops have special sections for export goods and 
guarantee purchases with plugs, electric current and variable settings 
compatible with or adaptable to systems back home.

WOMEN AT WORK: A NEW DEBATE IS BORN; 
</P>
<P>
THE 'MOMMY TRACK' HAS AUTHORITIES ARGUING ABOUT WOMEN'S ROLES AT WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

A recent Harvard Business Review article suggested that there are two basic 
types of women managers -- those who put career first and those who need a 
flexible schedule to take care of their children. The article, written by 
Felice N. Schwartz, stirred controversy by recommending that companies should 
accommodate women with these differing goals by establishing separate 
"career-primary" and "career-and-family" tracks for women. But would such a 
system really help women meet their career and personal goals? Or would it 
pigeonhole women and institutionalize unequal treatment on the job? Free-lance 
writer Meredith Chen raised these questions with a variety of authorities, and 
excerpts from her interviews follow: 
</P>
<P>
 Felice N. Schwartz, founder and president of the researcher organization 
Catalyst: 
</P>
<P>
"The article I wrote for the Harvard Business Review is an essay that is my 
commentary as an informed, concerned person who has headed a research 
organization for over 27 years. We have probably done more research at Catalyst 
than any other group or research organization on the subject of women. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The vast majority of women need to work out of economic necessity. I think 
also that a vast majority of women would like to have the opportunity to 
participate more actively in the lives of their children than they can within 
the present structure. I think that because of the new demographic realities 
and because women are so prepared to make a contribution to corporate 
management, companies now are going to enable women to have the flexibility 
that they need. 
</P>
<P>
"I predict companies will enable women to work on whatever schedule works for 
them and to come back part-time. . . . The thing that I think is great about 
that is that women will be able to be fully productive during those hours that 
they do work and they will be able to take the time for parenting that they 
want to take. Even poor women will be able to afford to cut back somewhat and 
have prorated pay and not be deprived of the opportunity to be with their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that corporations aren't ready yet to respond to men. I think what 
they condone for women they condemn, or at least look at as a lack of 
commitment, from men. But . . . there is no question in my mind that the single 
most significant, cost-effective thing that companies can do to release the 
productivity of women is to legitimize and facilitate the role that men want 
increasingly to take in family life. I think that what they do in response to 
women, vis-a-vis flexibility, will be a model for what they do with men." 
</P>
<P>
Jerome M. Rosow, president of the Work in America Institute research group: 
</P>
<P>
"The criticism of Felice Schwartz's piece is a little bit of an over-reaction. 
I think to some extent, she was defining the reality of what's happening. What 
we see here is the leading edge of a trend of women with professional careers 
who are becoming a predominant part of the American labor force, trying to 
adjust the conflicts between work and family. Part of what we see in her 
definition of the two-track phenomenon is an expression of the fact that women 
need wider choices than men in their professional careers because they are not 
relieved of the child-rearing responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not a question of being derailed from a career, but rather going on a 
slower pace. What we are seeing is an elaboration of choice. 
</P>
<P>
"The article demonstrates the tremendous impact of the feminization of American 
workers. Large employers have been slow to adapt to the changing fact of women 
in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see the mommy track as a permanent track. I see it as a temporary 
sidetrack for a large number of women who are highly motivated. Women who are 
not allowed by the corporation to get back on track will be apt to leave and go 
elsewhere where they are not treated like second-class citizens. The point is 
that if you are going to get this track, it has to be by choice and 
administered with equity." 
</P>
<P>
Ann Morrison, co-author of "Breaking the Glass Ceiling" and director of the 
Center for Creative Leadership: 
</P>
<P>
"I think what Felice has done is to assume some givens. Instead of trying to 
change the way some things are done, she has accepted that and proposed some 
solutions that fall into existing givens. Those givens are not entirely 
acceptable, and I think that is where the flak has come from. People are saying 
that women shouldn't have to be solely responsible for parenting. The bulk of 
her article assumes that women are going to continue to assume the 
responsibility for child-rearing as well as child-bearing. A way to help women 
out is to share the responsibility more fairly between two parents so that 
there doesn't have to be a mommy track. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Lewis, chairman of Corporate Annual Reports: 
</P>
<P>
"I think that what Felice Schwartz was really saying was that you should 
identify the fast-track people, the fast-track women who, in fact, don't want 
to drop out and have children, and make sure that you don't have any false 
barriers in their way. There is almost an assumption in business that these 
bright women are going to drop out after 10 years and have children. If you 
have some who are identified as not going to drop out, you can give them more 
responsibility and training and keep them going up. It is a positive if you can 
identify those few that will go straight up. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is a landmark subject, and it has not been talked about publicly 
before. I think the reason is that on the one hand the feminist point of view 
had been that women and men essentially are equal and there should be no 
discussion of differentiation. In big business, there is a great concern over 
being labeled anti-feminist. Men just don't want to do that, they'd rather just 
duck the issue. Consequently, it really took a prominent woman with impeccable 
credentials to bring the subject to the table. 
</P>
<P>
"There may be men who want to go on a daddy track, but there is a real world to 
consider here. Men accept the idea that a woman might take time off to take 
care of a baby. At the same time, they would not understand why another man 
would take time off, and men know that. They know that it would be out of step 
and that is just the cultural bias. That is just the reality. It may be a good 
idea, but I don't think at this point in time many men would do it." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.): 
</P>
<P>
"When you have something in a journal as prestigious as the Harvard Business 
Review citing two studies that they won't name or tell the methodology -- but 
that says that women that have families cost (businesses) more than men and 
therefore it is OK to have a second track -- I think we should jump on them. 
</P>
<P>
"The new government statistics say that young girls in school are five times 
more likely to be the sole support of their families as young boys. What 
happens is that women know that and they are terribly conscientious about their 
jobs, be they military or anything else. The way I read Schwartz's article is 
that she is saying that we professional women are just tired of being held back 
by you ladies who insist on having children. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The amazing thing to me is that (Schwartz) is getting back to the thing I 
thought we buried years ago and that is you can't have a family and a career. 
She is polarizing women and everybody loves it. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very confusing and the most surprising thing is that Harvard would print 
something like this." 
</P>
<P>
Kirk O. Hanson, a corporate ethics consultant who teaches a business ethics 
course at Stanford University that considers the trade-offs between work and 
family: 
</P>
<P>
"Many companies are structured in a way that makes it difficult for women to be 
on the fast track. The clearest indicator of that is the marital status of 
top-level executives. Some 95% of top-level male executives are married. Only 
50% of top-level women executives are married. 
</P>
<P>
"The dual track makes me uncomfortable if it is available only to women. In 
fairness, it needs to be available to both men and women. One reason that it 
should be available to men is so that it doesn't stigmatize women, and so that 
it serves as encouragement for men to take on more of the child-rearing 
responsibilities. It is inevitable that it will be primarily a vehicle for 
women to manage the conflicting pressures of family life and work. 
</P>
<P>
"In many companies a peculiar brand of macho has taken over where an 
unnecessary standard of work is the norm. Many women who object to the mommy 
track want to be more macho than the macho males who have run business over the 
last hundred years. 
</P>
<P>
"I teach a lot of MBAs who exhibit a peculiar brand of macho that leads them to 
believe they can do it all, have a happy family life, work 70 hours a week and 
achieve unlimited corporate success. There are trade-offs, and this is a 
fundamental ethical decision that every business person makes whether male or 
female. 
</P>
<P>
"Current evidence is that women are voting with their feet when it comes to 
making work and family trade-offs. Even among our most professionally oriented 
women, there is strong evidence that they chose to modify their working hours 
in order to put family priorities ahead at certain times in their careers. Few 
of them see and have the opportunity to reintegrate onto the fast track, and 
their talents, at the peak period of their careers, are lost to the companies 
that might have taken advantage of them. 
</P>
<P>
R. Gordon McGovern, chief executive of Campbell Soup Co. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to try to relieve some of the tension and pressures that keep you 
from getting at some of the talent that is in the female and male work force. 
There are specific cases where people have come here because we had a 
child-care center or have stayed because we had it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that job sharing is something we have to get accustomed to. There is 
not resistance to it philosophically. It is the problem of putting the time and 
energy into organizing it to make it work. 
</P>
<P>
"I agree with Felice Schwartz that maternity should not be the thing that cuts 
women off from getting to the top. . . . In the United States, 45% of our 
company's total work force is women, and 23% of our management positions are 
women. . . . I don't think it is enough."

TWO SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT ON EASTERN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH STRIKING WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent machinists strike and subsequent bankruptcy filing by Eastern 
Airlines is not another traditional labor-management conflict. It simply shows 
very poor leadership by senior management. Frank Lorenzo may be a financial 
whiz-bang but he does not know how to run an airline. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, Lorenzo gives business and management a bad name. He uses the "us 
against them" approach to labor relations that was common during the first half 
of this century. The best companies today, those that successfully compete 
against imports, those that are growing the fastest, those that are leading 
America to become strong again, all have one thing in common. They see all 
their employees from the janitor to the chief executive as partners working 
together toward a common goal. 
</P>
<P>
They respect the intelligence and contributions of their people. When 
management tries to protect the company from labor and labor tries to protect 
themselves from management, nothing gets accomplished. In today's best 
companies, everyone walks to the same drummer. 
</P>
<P>
You cannot successfully run a top-quality, customer-driven company by only 
focusing on dollars, equipment and technology. The first priority must always 
be the commitment and initiative of all employees who work for the company. 
Without that, you cannot survive. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Lorenzo has failed to get that commitment from his people. In my 
professional opinion, that means he has failed as a business executive and 
leader. Other airlines such as Delta and American remain profitable even with 
higher labor rates because of their employees' commitment. 
</P>
<P>
Put aside the past. Maybe you were pro-business and anti-labor. Or you were 
pro-labor and anti-management. We need to bury these differences in history. 
For the sake of the country's competitive future and everyone's jobs, let us 
focus on partnerships and teamwork between everyone who makes the economy spin 
around. The Frank Lorenzos of this world have no place in that future.

REDUCE FATS IN DIET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those in the medical profession have failed to point out the most significant 
fact concerning the specious campaign by the Omaha millionaire and his friends 
in the soybean industry to pressure food processors into switching from 
saturated to unsaturated fats ("Health Crusader Targets Nabisco in Latest 
Battle Over Use of Tropical Oils," March 2), so I shall do so. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous studies, dating back to the 1961 Wadsworth Veterans' Administration 
Hospital study, have shown that substituting unsaturated fats for saturated 
fats in the diet does indeed reduce mortality from heart disease but raises 
mortality from cancer, so that the total death rate remains about the same. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most prudent course would be to reduce consumption of fats of all 
types, as recommended by the National Research Council ("Council Urges Major 
Changes for U.S. Diet") in the same issue of the newspaper.

NUNN, JACKSON: DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS PUSH DEMOCRATS APART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Keith Love, Keith Love, a Times political writer, covered the Democrats in 
the 1988 presidential race. 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
PHILADELPHIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Democrats, shredded for the fifth time in six presidential elections, are 
soul-searching again and the regrouping for 1992 has suddenly come down to 
this: How to close the gap between Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn and the Rev. Jesse 
Jackson? 
</P>
<P>
Nunn has risen dramatically in the party pantheon by leading the Senate's 
rejection of John Tower for defense secretary. He is a founder of the 
Democratic Leadership Council, a group of Southerners and others who are trying 
to move the Democrats toward a pragmatic agenda that does not abandon its 
historic commitment to civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
And Nunn's Senate record and Southern base give him credibility with the 
moderate middle class, the group the Democrats must win over if they are to 
regain the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Whether he runs for President or simply helps shape the party's agenda, Nunn is 
now a force to contend with. You could see signs of it everywhere when he and 
other members of the Democratic Leadership Council met two weeks ago in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Just in from winning his duel with President Bush over the Tower nomination, 
Nunn got a standing ovation when he rose to convene the conference. Lobbyists 
who finance DLC gatherings fawned over him, pulling his chair back before he 
sat down, pushing and shoving for the chance to bring him a glass of water. 
</P>
<P>
The DLC members who have already run for President -- and no doubt will again 
-- Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. and Missouri Rep. Richard A. Gephardt, also 
treated Nunn deferentially. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, of course, has been a force to reckon with for some time. He is the 
unofficial head of the party's most loyal constituency; when he runs in 1992 he 
will have more national campaign experience than any of his rivals. 
</P>
<P>
He is also the party's most exciting messenger and, after the Michael S. 
Dukakis debacle last year, Jackson is understandably impatient with Democrats 
who urge him to step aside so that a less controversial (and non-black) 
candidate can win the big prize. 
</P>
<P>
But as Jackson took advantage of the DLC invitation to participate at 
Philadelphia, it was clear that he and council chairman Nunn are far apart -- 
on what the party agenda ought to be and on what voters it should target in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland Prof. William Galston rolled out some polling and other data for the 
members and told them that the Democratic Party has lost "virtually all 
credibility" with the middle class and "must regain competitiveness among the 
kinds of voters it has lost in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Those voters, Galston said, are of moderate income, probably property owners. 
Some are Southern Protestants, others are northern and Midwestern Roman 
Catholics. All are concerned about personal security, economic progress and 
middle-class values. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn couldn't agree more. "We need to articulate new themes and ideas that 
mainstream Americans can both understand and support," he said in the keynote 
address. "We are losing the working- and middle-class voters who used to be the 
mainstays of the party's governing coalition." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who pointedly avoided mentioning the Galston paper, acknowledged that 
the party needs middle-class voters but he sees party salvation in another 
group: the disadvantaged, many of them minorities, some of them union members 
who are victims of corporate merger wars. "Politics is not just who leads us 
but also who needs us," he lectured. 
</P>
<P>
Then, turning to Nunn, Jackson said sharply, "And Sen. Nunn, there are 97,000 
unregistered African-Americans with 90% Democratic propensity in Atlanta alone. 
They could provide a cushion for Sam Nunn or some other Democrat." 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Sen. Charles S. Robb, who sat beside Jackson, at one point told the 
group, "If we had more messengers with the extraordinary ability to deliver a 
message of Jesse Jackson, there is no question we would carry the day." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson was beaming until Robb added, "Now, if we could just help Jesse get 
that message straight . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to Jackson's interest in expanding the party's low-income base 
and to Jackson's desire for greatly reduced defense spending in favor of 
spending much more on social programs -- not exactly the agenda the DLC 
believes will attract middle-class whites. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Robb told reporters that Jackson could make the Democrats' job difficult 
by creating "a perception that we are bringing together all who have a greater 
need and pitting them in some way against those who are currently successful." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson responded testily, "We have to determine which side of history we are 
on. If we are all things to all people, we become rather ill-defined, 
indecisive -- kind of like warm spit." 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, Nunn, Robb and Jackson are all Southerners by birth -- and that 
may be crucial to the Democrats' prospects. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, who risked his life in the civil-rights movement 30 
years ago, said at a DLC reception that if the party is to pull itself together 
and start winning presidential elections, "the Southerners are going to have to 
solve it." 
</P>
<P>
What he means is that Nunn, Robb and other conservative Southern Democrats can 
break the Republican lock on white voters while Jackson -- a native of 
Greenville, S.C. -- and other Southern black leaders make sure the party sticks 
to its guns on race. 
</P>
<P>
In conference remarks, Jackson said, "Race is the No. 1 moral issue in a 
presidential campaign" and warned Southerners not to back away from it. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn has no problem with that but he is concerned that Jackson represents the 
liberal, McGovern wing of the party. Nunn watched intently during a Ben J. 
Wattenberg film that contends Democrats lost the white middle class during 
their raucous conventions in 1968 and 1972. 
</P>
<P>
At one point in the film, a young Chicago activist named Jesse Jackson is shown 
in a triumphant moment right after he and others unseated boss Richard J. Daley 
at the 1968 convention. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he thought the gap between himself and Jackson could ever be closed, 
Nunn replied, "I hope so, but we've got a ways to go. At least we're talking." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson revealed at the conference that Nunn and Robb had recently invited him 
to a private discussion of party problems. 
</P>
<P>
In Jackson's estimation, the invitation was long overdue. "That's the longest 
amount of time we've spent together in our lives," Jackson said, referring to 
the two-hour meeting in Nunn's Senate office. "Here we are in the same boat 
looking for the same votes and we haven't been talking to each other." 
</P>
<P>
But as Jackson, Nunn and Robb all privately consider their presidential 
prospects in 1992, Jackson is convinced of something that many members of the 
DLC are not -- that he would attract significant white support in the South. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, he talked about having just stood with striking Eastern 
Airlines workers in several Southern cities. "I've been all over the South in 
the last two weeks," Jackson said. "Everywhere I went it was 'Jesse, Jesse, 
Jesse.' Mostly white people." 
</P>
<P>
Pointing to Nunn, who was standing nearby, Jackson added, "And if I know how to 
get the white people in the South then these white leaders ought to know how to 
get white people in the South. You understand me? I know how to do it." 
</P>
<P>
As Jackson said it, Nunn moved on into the crowd, the gap between them growing 
by the minute.

.. . AND ANOTHER'S ADVANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There probably are lessons in management techniques to be learned from the 
debacle at Eastern Air Lines. But the real lessons would come not from an 
airline that is failing but from one that works, America West being a smoothly 
functioning example of one that hums. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Lorenzo, president of Texas Air Corp., which owns Eastern and Continental 
Airline is at war with his employees in a style that has the mark of strike, 
bankruptcy and fire sale written all over it. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern's troubles have even prompted calls for reforms in the reforms of 
regulation of the airlines, as though that had helped cause the problem. But 
America West is a child of those same deregulation reforms, and it is doing 
very nicely, thank you, with a very different management style. 
</P>
<P>
It helps that America West started at Phoenix, a growing metropolitan area but 
with a sort of air-service vacuum that was easy to fill. The rest it has done 
on its own. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern's pilots make less than the industry average. The pilots at American 
West, and all other employees, make more. All own stock in the company, a 
condition of employment. Sick leave policy is flexible enough to meet the needs 
of the ill employee rather than the needs of some rule. 
</P>
<P>
Management doctrine seems to start with a broad understanding that flying 
machines are not flown by machines -- or maintained, repaired, scheduled or 
booked by machines. "Management'sbasic premise is that employees are 
individuals," a company spokesman said, "and that kind and thoughtful treatment 
of employees will lead to kind and thoughtful treatment of our passengers." 
</P>
<P>
As one way of demonstrating that, America West operates a child-care center 
around the clock and seven days a week. Among other ways that help relieve the 
stress of parenthood is that aircrews, taking off on runs that will keep them 
away from home for two or three days,leave knowing that their children will be 
well cared for. 
</P>
<P>
There is not enough covered parking space at America West's corporate 
headquarters, so every payday there is a lottery to see who gets the available 
space. As one official noted, he has seen Chairman Edward R. Beauvais' car in 
the outdoor lot for about three weeks, which means that he did not draw a 
winning number the last time. 
</P>
<P>
America West started up in 1983 with three second-hand airplanes. It now flies 
70 planes on routes as far east as New York City and Baltimore-Washington and 
has 42 more planes on order. Because it is so young, the planes in its fleet 
have the lowest average age in the industry. It makes money. It ranks first 
among the nation's airlines in leaving and arriving on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
It is doing something right. And treating people with respect, whether they are 
paying customers or employees, has something to do with it. That's a lesson 
worth learning and remembering.

EASTERN'S DECLINE . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eastern Air Lines, battered by years of brawling between management and labor, 
is on its own for at least two more weeks as it looks for a place to land. 
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly last week to force President 
Bush to order striking machinists back to work, with federal mediators spending 
60 days trying to bring order out of Eastern's internal chaos. But the Senate 
recessed for two weeks without acting on the bill, so government will be out of 
the picture at least that long. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, as The Wall Street Journal reported Friday, the anger among Eastern 
workers, pilots as well as machinists, is so intense that "the instincts for 
self-preservation that normally propel labor disputes toward resolution seem 
notably missing." Sixty days are not likely to dampen the anger or undo 
antagonisms that have been building for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Eastern finds a place to land depends partly on what Frank Lorenzo, 
president of Texas Air Corp., which owns Eastern and Continental airlines, 
wants to do and partly on what a bankruptcy judge will let him do. Lorenzo has 
talked about selling off Eastern's fleet, its ownership of landing slots at 
major airports and other assets piecemeal. He also has talked of keeping the 
airline going as is or selling it. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern must not be allowed to fold. It is needed in the nation's network as 
part of the competitive structure that keeps prices down, a structure in which, 
ironically, Lorenzo once was a pioneer. But today's labor/management chemistry 
is so toxic that new ownership is Eastern's best hope for a place to land. And 
time is running out.

WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rt. Rev. Dinis Sengulane, Anglican bishop of Lebombo, Mozambique, found 
clearing customs at Los Angeles International Airport unexpectedly difficult 
last Sunday even though he was wearing the clothing appropriate to his office, 
and his passport bore confirmation of his religious office and visa stamps 
showing two previous U.S. visits. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was subjected to intense interrogation by four customs agents who 
appeared skeptical that he was indeed a bishop. He offered to show them a 
letter of invitation from three Episcopal churches in Pasadena, San Marino and 
San Gabriel, where he was to address a Lenten series, but they were not 
interested. Apparently dissatisfied with his responses, despite fluent English 
learned when he trained for the ministry in England, and a thorough check of 
his baggage, the customs agents took him to a small interrogation room, had him 
remove shoes and coat, spread-eagled him in a corner and subjected him to what 
he described as"a search all over my body." He was released after signing a 
declaration that nothing had been taken from him. 
</P>
<P>
"Do I have the face of a criminal?" he asked. "Perhaps they were influenced by 
movies on TV of smugglers dressed as clergy. Or was it my country, Mozambique, 
because the government is Marxist? Or was it racism?" 
</P>
<P>
But then he paused with a new concern. "I would be badly hurt to know that, as 
a result of my speaking of this, the agents might lose their jobs or not be 
promoted. That is not my intention." He had yet another concern about the 
agents. "It does damage to the person doing it if he thinks it is the normal 
way of doing things, when you do something that is worse than what you are 
trying to prevent." 
</P>
<P>
A public affairs officer at U.S. Customs said body search is "very common," 
adding that "only those with a diplomatic visa are exempt."

'MEANING OF ROE VS. WADE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In your editorial "Meaning of Roe vs. Wade" (March 10), you wrote " . . . What 
is at stake in the case: American women may no longer be protected by law if 
they decide, for whatever reason, to end a pregnancy by having an abortion." 
This statement needs clarification: 
</P>
<P>
 -- They decide, i.e., choice. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Whatever reason, i.e., don't want the baby. 
</P>
<P>
 -- End a pregnancy, i.e., destroy a child. 
</P>
<P>
What the woman chooses to abort is not a part of her own body. Biologically the 
zygote is a separate entity from the mother. It has a different blood supply, 
and may have a different blood type. It has a different heredity, only partly 
derived from its mother. 
</P>
<P>
Pushing back to the earliest state of this development in the womb, an expert 
biologist can distinguish a human embryo from that of any other animal by its 
anatomical features. All biologists know that each species has its own DNA, 
(the collection of genetic molecules in the zygote), which determines the 
details of the heredity of the individual. 
</P>
<P>
We know it is human from the moment of conception. 
</P>
<P>
The embryo is alive and it is human. Therefore, it has human life. Human life 
has to be in a human body, as tiny as it is in its beginning. This alive human 
body must have a human spirit, i.e., a human soul. It is a human being.

'MEANING OF ROE VS. WADE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By now we're all familiar with the arguments, pro and con, concerning abortion. 
But I think it behooves us to keep the debate within the realm of civility and 
truth. 
</P>
<P>
(Operation Rescue organizer) Joseph Foreman, whose comments were quoted in 
"Anti-Abortionists Get Setback" (Metro, March 3), exceeds the bounds of 
legitimate public debate when he says Judge Terry Hatter's order says " . . . 
It's right to protect baby killers." That is arrant, hysterical nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
And when Foreman cites Susan B. Anthony as a model for his protest movement, 
that's downright chutzpah. If there was one thing that appalled Anthony it was 
the plight of women burdened with too many children, living in poverty, and 
doomed to an early, worn-out death. 
</P>
<P>
She was even irked by the fact that her closest friend and ally, Elizabeth Cady 
Stanton, had so many children. She felt that Stanton's time and energies were 
depleted by the necessity of caring for them when she could have been working 
for women's rights. (Stanton, by the way, managed quite nicely -- but then, she 
could afford her progeny.) If Anthony were alive today, I'm sure she would be 
an ardent supporter of Planned Parenthood and militantly pro-choice. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, has anyone else besides me noticed that the majority of Operation 
Rescue's demonstrators are men? Is it the "barefoot and pregnant" philosophy 
reasserting itself, or just the prehistoric male desire to perpetuate his 
genes, run amok?

WHAT ISRAEL NEEDS NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three months ago Israel's government said it was working on a new "peace plan" 
in response to the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories and to 
Yasser Arafat's statement that the Palestine Liberation Organization was at 
last renouncing terrorism and accepting Israel's existence. Since then, and 
most noticeably in the last few weeks, it has become steadily clearer that the 
approaches Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has in mind aren't new, won't advance 
the peace process and could only by the most charitable of interpretations be 
regarded as constituting a "plan." 
</P>
<P>
What the government has been vaguely talking about is reviving the autonomy 
provisions of the 1978 Camp David agreement and bringing Jordan's King Hussein 
into negotiations about the West Bank's future. These approaches made sense in 
their time. Now, Shamir's suggestion that he finds virtues in them is only 
ironic. When the Camp David accords were put before the Knesset a decade ago, 
Shamir voted to reject them as unacceptable. And Shamir's Likud Party in the 
past has been unsparing in its scorn for the Labor Party's notion of invoking a 
"Jordanian option" to try to bring about a West Bank settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Too little and too late will not produce the required directional shift in a 
dead-end policy. Shamir's second thoughts about a new peace plan seem to 
reflect an assessment that, despite earlier concerns, the Bush Administration 
isn't about to lean on Israel to begin planning for an eventual withdrawal from 
most of the West Bank. Washington's attitude in turn appears to be conditioned 
by its own disappointment with the course of the U.S.-PLO talks that have been 
going on since January in Tunisia, with some officials complaining that the PLO 
has so far shown itself incapable of moving beyond slogans to deal with 
substance. 
</P>
<P>
Even Secretary of State James A. Baker's comment -- anathema to Israel -- that 
direct PLO-Israel talks might one day be needed doesn't seem to have affected 
Shamir's perception that he can coast with the status quo. To conclude that, 
though, is of course again to evade facing the basic challenge: Palestinian 
nationalism as exemplified by the 16-month-old intifada isn't going to falter 
or disappear, and the burdens on Israel of maintaining a repressive occupation 
aren't going to become more bearable. Israel needs a change in policy not to 
appease Washington or accommodate the PLO, but because it has become painfully 
clear that its own political, economic, security and moral interests urgently 
demand it.

'MEANING OF ROE VS. WADE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By complaining of the Los Angeles Police Department's handling of recent 
abortion protests relative to its actions against homeless people and Hispanic 
day laborers, Councilwoman Gloria Molina seems to be assuming some sort of 
political motives on the part of the department (Metro, March 9). I am not an 
official apologist for the department, but as a seven-year veteran I feel 
qualified to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Be they protesters or day laborers, those who block sidewalks and entrances to 
businesses are committing a misdemeanor, a fact which limits our authority to 
take action. Put simply, we can only enforce the laws in these situations after 
a complaint from a victim. In the case of the day laborers, the LAPD responded 
to complaints from merchants and residents who found the day laborers littering 
and urinating on their property. Any citizen has the right to ask the police to 
prevent such activity. 
</P>
<P>
The abortion protesters, however, were seeking a confrontation with the police 
as a means to gain public attention for their cause. The operators of the 
clinics realized this and chose not to have the police intervene and generate 
publicity for the protesters. If they choose to request assistance in the 
future, the LAPD will enforce the laws without regard to the ideology of either 
side.

A Docent With Great Insight 
</P>
<P>
As far as they know out at the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum in Griffith 
Park, Betty Pember is the only docent in California who is legally blind. Not 
that anyone cares, or even notices after a while. What Pember lacks in visual 
acuity, they figure, she makes up in insight, verve and humor. 
</P>
<P>
Fascinated by California history since childhood -- her grandparents settled in 
Newhall in 1893 -- Pember had long been "docenting in the area, out here near 
where Gene Autry had his Melody Ranch," when she and a friend "drove down (to 
the new Autry Museum) to see if we could help out." Indeed they could. Pember 
took -- and passed -- the docent course, and now reports for duty most Friday 
mornings. 
</P>
<P>
She specializes in youth tours, demonstrating toys of yesteryear, "making the 
period come alive for the youngsters. It's quite delightful." The toys are 
simple, virtually without cost: a little wooden wheel one whirls on a string to 
make a hum and a whistle; a notched stick surmounted by a propeller that turns 
when the stick is rubbed; clothespin dolls. "I tell them stories. They can play 
with the toys -- make them too, if they'd like." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if The Times could take a picture of her docenting, Pember hesitates -- 
"I don't photograph well" -- then reconsiders. "Oh well," she says, "how much 
of it can I see anyway?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CSUN Grads Will See Sunrise 
</P>
<P>
You have to get up pretty early in the morning to graduate from Cal State 
Northridge. At least you do this year. 
</P>
<P>
With campus construction temporarily bumping graduation ceremonies from 
traditional sites, May commencement will be in the Hollywood Bowl -- starting 
at 7 a.m.! Unique time, unique place, but in the end, an eminently sensible and 
truly Californian solution. 
</P>
<P>
Edmund Peckham, dean of students, defends the ungodly hour as "relatively 
traffic-free" and notes that it affords time enough after the ceremony for "an 
all-day series of events on campus: open houses, receptions, exhibitions. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
Ann Salisbury, one of a three-person CSUN search committee that had to buck the 
Beach Boys for Bowl time, allows as "we wanted to do something original. 
Californians, conditioned by the Eastern media, think that for a ceremony to be 
legitimate we have to emulate the Ivy League. Hence the absurdity of grads in 
black robes over suits and dresses, perspiring under a hot Southern California 
sun." 
</P>
<P>
Another departure, Dean Peckham says, will be "a program stressing the 
multicultural nature of our school," including music by the Pan-African Studies 
Rebirth Gospel Choir and the Conjunto Heuyapan, a family of six performing 
centuries-old Mexican music on nearly extinct instruments. 
</P>
<P>
With 4,600 due to graduate, and families and friends filling the Bowl, it 
promises to be memorable, if early. "After all," Salisbury says, "CSUN is 
pronounced 'See Sun.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High-Schooler On the Air 
</P>
<P>
His name is Hadrian Lesser and he has been in the radio biz for the last eight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Not too many Hadrians around. Plenty of radio types with eight years in the 
medium, to be sure. But at the age of 16? 
</P>
<P>
Lesser has his own spot -- "Youth and the Health Issues" -- sometime between 8 
and 10 a.m. on KGIL. The two-hour program proper, "The Health Connection," is 
run by Hadrian's father, Gershon, a doctor. The spot is researched, written and 
delivered by Hadrian, though: "Dad only edits it." The spot even has its own 
sponsor; has had for years, dating back to when Hadrian was barely into double 
digits, agewise. 
</P>
<P>
Hadrian, now a junior at Beverly Hills High, started going to the station when 
he was 8. "I just hung around," Hadrian says from the ripe perspective of 16. 
"I watched the engineers, saw what everyone was up to, started learning how to 
operate the equipment. Pretty soon I wanted to talk on the air. I started out 
doing a commercial for one of Dad's sponsors." 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-second spots grew to three minutes: "Health-related information, from 
pediatrics up to high-school issues. I just did a series on accident-prevention 
-- traffic accidents, sunburn, drowning -- and got a lot of response. Right now 
I'm working on a comparison between Japanese and American teens." 
</P>
<P>
By now, Hadrian is a lot more comfortable with radio than TV; his goal is to be 
a talk-show host, a job for which he has a terrific jump on his contemporaries. 
</P>
<P>
Just one more thing: How did the young broadcaster inherit the handle Hadrian? 
"We wanted a name starting with 'H,' " mother Michelle says. "The rest were so 
old-fashioned: Henry, Harold. Herman; ugh. So we named him after the Roman 
emperor. Anyway, he's the only Hadrian I ever met." Us too. DICK RORABACK

ERMA BOMBECK: OFFICE WORK ALWAYS WAS A PIECE OF CAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Erma Bombeck 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Occasionally, when the boredom of working from my home gets to me, I think of 
the good old days when I went to an office. 
</P>
<P>
I remember the excitement of a day when I had something new to wear. There was 
the stimulation of being around other people and the luxury of having a 
restroom with a key. And then I remember the down side of working in an office: 
Seven hours of snacking with an hour off for lunch! 
</P>
<P>
That workplace was like a giant cookie. I didn't work at a desk; I worked at a 
buffet table. The filing cabinets were china closets. The desk lamps were 
warming lights. I grew at a faster rate than the company. 
</P>
<P>
Every morning when I arrived, I had to run the course between two rows of desks 
that groaned under the load of doughnuts, sweet rolls and coffee cakes. The 
out-baskets were lined with Danish. It was worse than facing the Notre Dame 
backfield. I knew if I made it to my desk, I was safe until coffee break. 
</P>
<P>
Deep breath. First, I had to make it past Mother Mildred, who couldn't stand to 
see anyone miss breakfast. Breakfast was her answer to irregularity, a bad 
marriage, deep depression, early menopause, bad skin or a dead car battery. If 
you refused juice and coffee, she spread rumors about your sexual preference. 
</P>
<P>
Next, there was Shirley, who weighed 85 pounds (30 of that was hair). I dubbed 
her Meal on Heels. She never ate anything herself, but insisted you "just 
taste" some new, exotic dish she made the night before in her experimental 
kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Every office has a Cake Queen. Ours was Charlotte, who baked, decorated and 
torched a cake not only on everyone's birthday, but also for every other 
occasion you could imagine. I once refused a slice of cake in honor of the 
first anniversary of her dog's hysterectomy, and she was cool to me for two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
You had to admire the adventurous spirit of Wanda the Wonder Worker, who turned 
office cooking into an Outward Bound exercise. She begged for challenges. If 
you had two raw potatoes that needed baking for lunch, Wanda made a solar oven 
on the windowsill out of the tray that held paper in the copier and foil from a 
thousand packs of chewing gum. She once served lamb shish kebabs on a letter 
opener over a fire set in the wastebasket. You don't want to know where she 
chilled the wine for Lois' baby shower. 
</P>
<P>
One day I took stock of the giant tins of popcorn, boxes of candy bars, 
crackers, jars of peanut butter and cheeses. Our whole office building could 
have been under siege for three months, and we still would have gained weight. 
</P>
<P>
I work from my home now, where the only distractions are a microwave, two 
ovens, a full refrigerator, freezer and pantry of fast foods. 
</P>
<P>
To this day, I cannot answer a phone without automatically shaking the cookie 
crumbs out of the mouthpiece before I say "hello."

ZAN THOMPSON: OH, TO BE IN IRELAND ON ST. PADDY'S DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Zan Thompson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Uncle Dennis O'Brien, brother of my grandmother, Bridget O'Brien Joyce, was 
walking down Burnside Street in Portland, Ore. He was 6-feet-4, and had just 
come out of the woods where he worked as a lumberjack nine months a year. 
</P>
<P>
Grandma always said he was the largest Irishman since Finn McCool, a legendary 
Fenian born 300 years before the birth of Christ, and educated in the forest by 
a poet. 
</P>
<P>
Uncle Dennis was like a great bear come to town in his boots and his 
red-and-black Mackinaw and his lion's mane of red hair. He knew Shakespeare 
like the rest of us know "Mary Had a Little Lamb," reading the plays by 
kerosene lamplight in the logging camp. 
</P>
<P>
A smaller man came up to Uncle Dennis and asked him if he would like to be in a 
motion picture, so perfect did he look for a role requiring him to stand around 
and lend believability to some Method actor who was trying to play the part of 
a woodsman. 
</P>
<P>
It pains me to tell you that Uncle Dennis knocked the small man to the 
sidewalk, right there on Burnside near the bridge. He said, "Don't be insulting 
your betters," and strode into the next saloon. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Uncle Dennis meant nothing unfriendly in flattening the man. He was just 
looking to save a bit of time for both of them. He was not an actor. He was a 
logger. And he didn't intend to make himself a mockery, for so he judged the 
man's work to be. 
</P>
<P>
Uncle Dennis came out of the woods for the last time at 86, went to Grandma 
Joyce's house across from St. Francis Church, walked upstairs, crawled into the 
high brass bed and died. 
</P>
<P>
Grandma used to warn my father, "Do y'see, now, Johnny, what I'm telling you 
about the drink? Look at the way the drink took Dennis." And so it did. The 
drink and 65 years in the woods. But surely, it was not a bad way to live and 
then, to die. After he left Clifden in Connemara in the west of Ireland for the 
tall forests of the Cascade Range, he spent his life in the scent of moss and 
fir and the sounds of creeks and small animals. He had Shakespeare for company 
and his memories of Gaelic stories that were old when poor Caesar came to 
Ireland. Poor Italian gentleman, off on a fool's war. 
</P>
<P>
Once a Catholic priest, new to the United States from the south of Ireland, a 
softer place than the rocky mountains of the west, came to our house to make a 
parish call. He introduced himself and Mama said her name was Mrs. John Michael 
Joyce. 
</P>
<P>
The poor, round-faced young man almost fell off the porch and said, "Ah, but 
they're a terrible people. They throw their enemies into the sea." 
</P>
<P>
And they probably did. Anyone who had traveled that far through those steep 
mountains was probably too tired to fight back. 
</P>
<P>
In Clifden in the heart of the Joyce country, there is a pub called Humanity 
Dick's. It is named after the man who founded the Royal Society for the 
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and built the pub, which is reputed to have 
the best lunch anywhere in Ireland. You can see straight through it, from the 
sidewalk out the vast window, which looks out over the Bay of Clifden to the 
wild, gray Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
Daddy said the Joyces are the only people in Ireland who have never bowed the 
knee to any English monarch. Poor, handsome Essex, sitting by an outpost fire 
and cursing his queen who sent him to Ireland as a rite of bravery, must have 
hated it. Even bloody Cromwell never got as far as Connemara. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe they didn't even want to. It's a man-eating country. It is still Celtic, 
one of the few places where that ancient people has survived unchanged. 
Connemara, Wales, Brittany, the Highlands of Scotland and the Ring of Kerry. 
</P>
<P>
Merle Severy says, "The Celts have left us haunting love tales, wondrous sagas, 
poetic bardic lore, not to mention the mesmerizing imagery of Yeats, Synge, 
Joyce, Dylan Thomas." 
</P>
<P>
All this from a people who introduced iron for weapons about the time Romulus 
and Remus were ready for solid food. 
</P>
<P>
I wish I had been in Ireland on St. Patrick's Day or any day at all, leaning on 
the seawall at Youghal where the sea is soft on the sands. 
</P>
<P>
Or with my friend Audrey Ann Marie Boyle having a glass of stout in Humanity 
Dick's and looking out the window to the sea hoping to catch a glimpse of a 
Galway fishing boat making the breakwater with its triangle sail shaped like an 
angel's wing, low in the water with the weight of fish in the hold. 
</P>
<P>
This year again, I give you: 
</P>
<P>
Wishing you always 
</P>
<P>
Walls for the wind 
</P>
<P>
And a roof for the rain 
</P>
<P>
A tankard by the fire 
</P>
<P>
Laughter to cheer you 
</P>
<P>
And those you love near you 
</P>
<P>
And all that your life might desire.

CIRCUMCISION DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The March 6 article on circumcision ("Circumcision: Clear Benefits, Some Risks" 
by Allan Parachini) ignores a major issue -- the cost, and cost effectiveness, 
of performing a routine surgical procedure on all male newborns. 
</P>
<P>
The current average cost of circumcision in California is probably $100 per 
operation. Cost of complications aside, circumcising all male newborns each 
year in California would easily be several million dollars. Is this cost 
justified in order to prevent less than 1% of males getting serious urinary 
tract infections? 
</P>
<P>
This matter needs to be clearly addressed, especially because MediCal currently 
classifies circumcision as a cosmetic surgery, which is not covered. However, 
if the Academy of Pediatrics says that the procedure is medically justified, 
then MediCal will have to pay for the surgery. Hence it is the taxpayers who 
are going to have to foot much of the increased medical bill that will result 
if we return to the 80%-90% circumcision rate existing in many areas of the 
urban and suburban United States in the late '50s and early '60s.

VICTORIA FALLS; 
</P>
<P>
THE SMOKE THAT THUNDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, Jones is a free-lance writer living in Norco, Calif. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
VICTORIA FALLS, Zimbabwe 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shortly after 2:30 one sunny December afternoon I met the button man. 
</P>
<P>
He stepped forward to take my luggage as I climbed from the bus that brought me 
from the airport, a half-hour ride away through the cracklingly dry bush 
country of northern Matabeleland. 
</P>
<P>
I forget his name, perhaps because I was so intrigued by his coat and hat, 
which were covered in buttons and badges of every sort and color. He was the 
doorman at the Victoria Falls Hotel, and his grin of welcome was warm and 
friendly. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel itself is a splendid structure, worthy of its long-held reputation as 
one of Africa's finest. 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1904 when the projected Cape-to-Cairo railway line finally reached the 
Zambesi River, it started life as little more than a wood and corrugated-iron 
building. 
</P>
<P>
Less than half a century later it was playing host to England's Royal Family 
when King George VI and Queen Elizabeth and Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret 
stayed there. Today, it and the equally famed Meikles Hotel in Harare are known 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
But the Victoria Falls Hotel has the edge in location, sited a few hundred 
yards from one of the world's great natural wonders. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors have been coming to Victoria Falls ever since Scottish explorer and 
missionary David Livingstone came across them on Nov. 16, 1855, and named them 
in honor of his queen. Before that the natives knew them by a more colorful 
name, Mosi-oa-Tunya, the Smoke That Thunders. 
</P>
<P>
I quickly unpacked and intended to walk immediately down to the falls, but 
three things delayed me. 
</P>
<P>
First were the mango trees that surround the hotel. Their branches seemed alive 
and, on closer inspection, I found a colony of vervet monkeys, some clutching 
young to their breasts, gathering mangoes. Apparently they were regular 
visitors at this time of year when the fruit begins to ripen. 
</P>
<P>
Next it was the swimming pool that stopped me or, more specifically, the sight 
of a pool attendant furiously chasing a troop of baboons off the surrounding 
lawn and back into the nearby bush. This, they said later, happens almost every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Lastly, stepping out onto the hotel's broad terrace, where an African marimba 
band entertains beneath 200-year-old mahogany trees, I was brought to a 
standstill by the view. 
</P>
<P>
The sight, in the afternoon light, with clouds gathering on the horizon and the 
sun at just the right angle, was spectacular. In the foreground, shaded lawns 
and flawless gardens gave way to unspoiled bush in hues of green and yellow. In 
its midst stood the iron railway bridge, completed a year after the hotel and 
spanning the river-carved chasm of red-brown rock that separates Zimbabwe from 
Zambia. 
</P>
<P>
One 1952 handbook mentions a story, apparently well authenticated, that when 
the bridge was officially opened in 1905, one party member tried to determine 
the depth of the gorge below. 
</P>
<P>
"For this purpose," said the handbook, "he picked up a stone and took out his 
watch to note the time taken by the stone to reach the water. Absent-mindedly, 
he dropped his watch into the gorge and found himself timing its descent by the 
stone in his hand." 
</P>
<P>
I didn't want to lose any time, either, and set out to walk to the curtain of 
rising mist and the distant roar that signaled the waterfall, the Smoke That 
Thunders. 
</P>
<P>
A winding path of sand zigzags down to the river, and along this path curio 
sellers had set up shop on the ground every 50 feet or so, displaying carved 
wooden animals, tribal masks of every size and native jewelry in assorted 
styles and colors. 
</P>
<P>
Getting past them without succumbing to their pleas -- "Buy a happy hippo, sir. 
Very cheap." -- was an art itself. Finally I reached the entrance to Victoria 
Falls National Park, its area fenced to protect it from both human and animal 
deprivation. 
</P>
<P>
Which way to go? Left or right? By then the clouds had built up overhead and 
rain seemed a distinct possibility. I chose to head left, toward what my map 
said was a statue honoring Livingstone. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't make it. Having climbed down the 73 forest-canopied steps leading to a 
view of the Western or Devil's Cataract, I was taking photographs when I felt 
the first drop of rain on my arm. 
</P>
<P>
In Africa, storms arrive with a startling suddenness. At first I hoped the 
trees would keep me dry. They didn't. I hurried back up the steps that were 
already becoming slippery, retraced my way and sought shelter with some equally 
soaked but broadly smiling Africans beneath a sort of thatched roof structure 
of unknown purpose. 
</P>
<P>
We waited. The rain, like the air, was warm, and I was not cold. The downpour 
increased, the thatch leaked, the floor of the shelter flooded and what had 
been a path a few moments before was a swiftly moving stream. 
</P>
<P>
Standing there, drenched to the skin, I thought back to the news story I read 
in the Bulletin just a few hours earlier during the drive from the airport. 
</P>
<P>
"The continuing drought throughout Matabeleland has reached crisis proportions, 
according to highly placed officials who view with alarm the worsening 
conditions among the human and animal populations," the story said. 
</P>
<P>
"Thousands of head of cattle have already died in the rural areas, and even if 
rain falls this month, thousands more will perish from starvation and lack of 
water during the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Weak, emaciated and starving cattle are now a common sight, trying desperately 
to find nourishment on road verges throughout the two provinces. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hazard to Motorists 
</P>
<P>
"These are posing a hazard to passing motorists, some of whom have been 
unfortunate enough to hit beasts lying in the road after dark." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the drought was at an end and the long-awaited summer rains had 
arrived. That was why the Africans were smiling. 
</P>
<P>
After waiting for an hour or so and seeing the downpour intensify rather than 
slacken, I left the shelter and, in a stooping half-walk, half-run, trying all 
the while to protect my camera, stumbled back up the path to the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The curio sellers, too, had abandoned their posts and the return trip was 
uneventful, although not without some loss of face at its conclusion. Guests 
and staff alike stared and smiled as I left a trail of sodden footprints across 
the hotel's plush carpets en route to my room. 
</P>
<P>
A shower, a change of clothes and a whiskey or two at the I Presume bar were 
enough to dispel any negative thoughts, however, and the storm became enjoyable 
as evening turned to night. 
</P>
<P>
There was, for instance, the dramatic sight of the lightning over the darkened 
bush, each jagged spear accompanied by thunder of such ferocity that the walls 
seemed to tremble. And there was the ludicrous moment when the power failed, 
the hotel was plunged into inky darkness and a frantic search ensued behind the 
bar for candles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Skies Cleared 
</P>
<P>
One candle-lit dinner later, I went to bed. The first day had been a memorable 
one, but I had yet to see the full grandeur of the falls and I had only two 
days left. 
</P>
<P>
By the next morning the skies had cleared. I learned later that 4 1/2 inches of 
rain had fallen in four hours the night before. After grabbing a quick 
breakfast of paw-paw (a larger version of papaya), sliced cheese and orange 
juice on the terrace, I set off through the bush, bypassing the 
tourist-trappers already setting out their wares along the pathway. 
</P>
<P>
Choosing to cut through the bush was perhaps not the wisest decision. One of my 
guidebooks had warned: " . . . keep to clearly marked footpaths when walking in 
the bush, or, if this is not possible, wear protective socks and boots." 
</P>
<P>
I was wearing thongs and a pair of shorts, and hoped that the guidebook's 
author was correct when she said: "Bites from animals other than insects are so 
rare as to be hardly worthy of mention." 
</P>
<P>
I took my time, stayed silent and kept my eyes open. My reward was the close-up 
sight of a large bushbuck doe that I startled when rounding an outcrop of rock; 
the view of a bristly group of wart hogs rooting in a mudhole, and, in a moment 
of near panic, something tawny that I fervently hoped was not a lion, hyena or 
any other kind of cat, breaking through the brush 100 feet to my right. 
</P>
<P>
The guidebook was not encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
"Occasionally, leopard and even lion have been seen, and elephant and buffalo 
often wander into the outskirts of the town during the dry season," it said. 
</P>
<P>
Wonderful. I hadn't seen another soul in almost an hour, was God-knows-where in 
the middle of the bush, and something was out there. Perhaps the rain the day 
before meant that this was now the wet season and the lions would be elsewhere. 
Anywhere elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
I quickened my pace, saw a wooden building that turned out to be a Zimbabwe 
border post, then crossed the railway line that leads from Victoria Falls to 
the town of Livingstone on the Zambian side of the border. Within minutes I was 
back at the falls. 
</P>
<P>
Writers, artists and photographers have tried for more than a century to do the 
waterfall justice. A few, like English artist Thomas Baines, have succeeded. 
Reproductions of Baines' superb oil paintings (the originals are in the South 
African Library in Cape Town) line the hotel walls, but the real thing is even 
more eye-opening. 
</P>
<P>
"On sights as beautiful as this, angels in their flight must have gazed," was 
the rather soppy phrase Livingstone used. Well, he was a missionary, not a 
writer, and he did do slightly better later: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sheet of Driven Snow' 
</P>
<P>
"Into this chasm, of twice the depth of Niagara Falls, the river, a full mile 
wide, rolls with a deafening roar. . . . The whole body of water rolls clear 
over, quite unbroken. But after a descent of 10 or more feet, the entire mass 
suddenly becomes like a huge sheet of driven snow. Pieces of water leap off it 
in the form of comets with tails streaming behind, till the whole snowy sheet 
becomes myriads of rushing, leaping, aqueous comets." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best aspect of Victoria Falls today is that more than 133 years 
after Livingstone's visit the area remains virtually unspoiled. Bush, river and 
waterfall are much as they have always been. Certainly, the animals are fewer 
and farther between, but no hideous commercialism has encroached. There are not 
even any guardrails to protect the unwary from a 400-foot plunge to the rocks 
below. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, however, the superstitions that once surrounded Mosi-oa-Tunya seem to 
have disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
French missionary Francois Coillard, who visited the falls 20 years after 
Livingstone, said that the natives "believe it is haunted by a malevolent and 
cruel divinity and they make offerings to conciliate its favor -- bead 
necklaces, a bracelet or some other object which they fling into the abyss, 
bursting into lugubrious incantations, quite in harmony with their dread and 
horror." 
</P>
<P>
No malevolent spirit was hanging about this morning. The sky was a deep blue, 
the sun hot on my back as I walked the length of the falls and back again. Each 
bend in the path offered something new: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Livingstone Memorial with its inscription that history has since made 
obsolete: "On the occasion of the centenary of David Livingstone's discovery of 
the Victoria Falls, men and women of all races in and from all parts of the 
federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland assembled solemnly to dedicate themselves 
and their country to carry on the high Christian aims and ideals which inspired 
David Livingstone in his mission here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
150 Million Years 
</P>
<P>
Rhodesia and Nyasaland are long gone, but as the Zimbabwe Tourist Board 
advertisement so effectively states, Victoria Falls remains, "Now in Its 150 
Millionth Fantastic Year. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Rain Forest, where an umbrella is the best defense, no matter how 
cloudless the sky, against the unending showers of spray that rise and then 
rain down from the adjacent falls. 
</P>
<P>
"The morning sun gilds these columns of watery smoke with all the glowing 
colors of double or treble rainbows," Livingstone wrote. "The evening sun, from 
a hot yellow sky, imparts a sulfurous hue and gives one the impression that the 
yawning gulf might resemble the mouth of the bottomless pit. No bird sits and 
sings on the branches of the grove of perpetual showers, or ever builds its 
nest there." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The succession of views that defy description: the Devil's Cataract, the 
Main Falls, Horseshoe Falls, Rainbow Falls, Livingstone Island, Danger Point, 
the Knife Edge, Boiling Pot Gorge, the Whirlpool. Each name carries with it a 
lasting image. 
</P>
<P>
The drought, which had lasted eight months, had left the Zambesi low. Rock 
showed everywhere along the fall line, and I even noticed some youngsters, 
carrying what looked like handmade fishing poles, wading from island to island 
on what seemed the very lip of the falls. 
</P>
<P>
It still flowed with an impressive volume of water, though, enough for several 
teams of white-water fans to be launching their rafts near the Boiling Pot 
after scrambling down a cliff face on the Zambian side. From 400 feet above, 
they looked like toy figures as they went through their preparations before 
being swept out of view through the gorges. 
</P>
<P>
The Zambesi flows for 800 miles before reaching the falls, then has another 900 
miles to go before emptying into the Indian Ocean. In a few months the river 
would be at flood stage, with an unimaginable average of 120 million gallons of 
water pouring over the falls each minute. Then the spray reaches 1,200 feet 
high and one can hear the crash and roar of the plunging water 20 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
Like other visitors before and since, I stood entranced, caught in the grip of 
the river's spell. Before I knew it, the day had gone. 
</P>
<P>
Back at the hotel, I celebrated with dinner in the Livingstone Room. Even then, 
the river would not let go. I ordered crocodile. 
</P>
<P>
"From the Zambesi?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"From the Zambesi," the waiter replied. 
</P>
<P>
Like Victoria Falls, it was indescribable.

THE SAVVY TRAVELER: OTHER AIRLINES MAY HONOR EASTERN TICKETS YOU BOUGHT BEFORE 
BANKRUPTCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The scene at New York's La Guardia Airport was quietly chaotic. At 7 on a 
Monday morning, dozens of would-be passengers, tickets in hand, waited in line 
at the Eastern Airlines counter, hoping to get on flights bound for Atlanta, 
Miami and other destinations. 
</P>
<P>
On the departure screen, 12 Eastern flights were listed: Seven had been 
canceled; the other five were "on time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Far More Damaging 
</P>
<P>
But by 7:15 the other five flights had been canceled too. The strike against 
Eastern by its machinists union had been far more damaging to the airline than 
anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern's pilots and flight attendants also supported the strikers, and as a 
result, not enough crews reported to work. The airline had, in effect, been 
reduced to operating its shuttle service between New York and Boston, and New 
York and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
And the passengers waiting in that ticket line -- as well as in similar lines 
at dozens of airports Eastern serves throughout the United States, Canada, the 
Caribbean and South America -- were sent to other airlines to try their luck. 
</P>
<P>
It is a sad scene that has repeated itself often in recent history. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1982, thousands of travelers in the United States and South America 
were caught by surprise when Braniff ceased operations. 
</P>
<P>
The same thing happened when Hawaii Express went out of business. In Hawaii, 
South Pacific Island Airways and Mid-Pacific Airlines have gone under. In 1987 
the bankruptcy of two regional carriers resulted in $50 million of unsecured 
debt in the form of unused tickets held by frustrated ticket holders. 
</P>
<P>
In the 10 years since deregulation there have been dozens of airline mergers, 
failures and consolidations. And thousands of passengers have been left holding 
their tickets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Questions to Ask 
</P>
<P>
If you're holding a ticket on Eastern Airlines, what can you do? And, because 
the airline subsequently declared bankruptcy, what real protection do you have? 
Does your ticket have any value? Can you get a refund? Will other airlines fly 
you? And at what additional cost? 
</P>
<P>
In almost all cases where airline service has been suspended because of labor 
or safety problems, bankruptcy or even liquidation, many competing airlines 
have agreed to honor the tickets of the troubled carrier on a standby, or 
space-available, basis. 
</P>
<P>
No law requires the airlines to do this, but for each airline that does, it 
makes good business sense. It ultimately gets the revenue from the original 
ticket, and fills a seat that otherwise might have gone unsold. 
</P>
<P>
Some airlines that have been accepting Eastern tickets have also stamped the 
back of the tickets with the following statement: 
</P>
<P>
"In exchange for consideration received, I hereby assign to (airline) all my 
rights and claims against the carrier issuing and arising under or related to 
the coupon upon which the assignment is stamped." 
</P>
<P>
What this means is that if another airline accepts an Eastern ticket, it is, in 
effect, taking you off the hook as an unsecured creditor. 
</P>
<P>
But there are some notable exceptions to this mutual aid behavior. 
</P>
<P>
First, look at the type of airline ticket you are holding. What fare have you 
paid? Is it a full coach (Y), first-class (F) or any one of a dozen discount 
fares (with fare designations such as M, B, YE70 or XE70)? 
</P>
<P>
The fare basis, or designation, may often determine which airline will honor 
your ticket, and in what order. Full Y or F tickets are usually honored with 
few hassles. Discount fares, especially those that carry restrictions, may be 
honored selectively by certain airlines, if the tickets are first endorsed by 
Eastern to the new carrier. 
</P>
<P>
Some airlines -- if seats are available -- will honor them without imposing any 
new restrictions on a space-available basis. And yet other airlines may only 
honor the discount tickets up to the printed value of the discount fare, and 
may impose an additional cost, representing the difference between the full 
coach fare and the discount fare you paid on the troubled airline. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Exceptions 
</P>
<P>
There are some tickets that no other airline will honor. If you are flying on a 
frequent-flier certificate, a free or a discounted ticket that is considered 
promotional, a voucher issued for travel as a result of an airline promotion, 
or any ticket that is endorsed "Good on Eastern only," you're out of luck until 
the airline resumes service. 
</P>
<P>
If the airline does not resume service, then your ticket is, in effect, 
worthless. 
</P>
<P>
Second, how much did you pay for your ticket? 
</P>
<P>
If you paid cash and an airline fails, you might end up as just another 
creditor in their bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
However, you do have some recourse if you paid for your ticket through a travel 
agent and/or used a credit card. Many travel agents sell insurance policies 
that protect passengers in cases of airline defaults or bankruptcies. 
</P>
<P>
But if you buy one of the many trip cancellation or interruption insurance 
policies, be sure to check it carefully. There are specific provisions and time 
periods under which some companies will cover you. 
</P>
<P>
For example, under the policy offered by Travelers Insurance, the company will 
refund your money if an airline fails "and stops all service completely 15 or 
more days after you have purchased coverage or while you are on the trip." 
</P>
<P>
Another company, Access America, offers a policy with few restrictions that 
covers "lost payment due to default or bankruptcy of any airline, tour operator 
or cruise line." 
</P>
<P>
But in most cases, trip cancellation insurance is only a worthwhile extra 
expense if you foresee other factors disrupting or canceling your trip -- 
illness, for example. You won't need extra insurance if you paid for your 
airline ticket with a credit card. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dispute the Charge 
</P>
<P>
If the airline suspends service or fails completely, you can easily dispute the 
charge with the credit card company. The company will then issue an interim 
credit on your account for the amount of the disputed ticket; after all, you 
paid for a service you did not receive. 
</P>
<P>
Some other words of caution: If an airline says it will only honor your ticket 
partially, shop around. These decisions tend to be discretionary, and are often 
left up to local airline station managers and ticket/gate agents. Some will 
honor the tickets, others won't. 
</P>
<P>
Comparison shopping won't cost you any more money, and may get your ticket 
honored elsewhere without incurring additional cost. 
</P>
<P>
A recent memo sent by American Airlines to each of its sales representatives 
and ticket offices outlined specific procedures relating to the types of 
Eastern tickets it would -- and would not -- accept. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, at the end of the memo, American also said "although ticket acceptance 
procedures are described above, there may be instances when good judgment 
dictates the acceptance of an Eastern Airlines ticket." 
</P>
<P>
What this means, of course, is that many of the decisions of ticket acceptance 
are left up to the discretion of individual airline personnel. 
</P>
<P>
These ticket acceptance policies tend to change almost as rapidly as most air 
fares. In the case of Eastern, some airlines that insisted they would not honor 
Eastern tickets on March 3, the day before the Eastern strike, did honor them 
on March 6.

HOTEL ADVENTURES OF A SINGLE-SUPPLEMENT TRAVELER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By POLK DuBOSE, DuBose is a Las Vegas free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Single supplement" is a familiar term to readers of tour brochures. In the 
most basic terms it means that if one prefers to sleep alone on a tour, paying 
the single supplement is the only way to go, the specified number of extra 
dollars guaranteeing private accommodations sans roommate. 
</P>
<P>
That's what it means but, as my old psychology teacher used to say: "There's 
more to it than that." At least that was the case with the tour I took four 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Having lived and traveled abroad extensively and independently but always with 
a companion, I hadn't a clue about the lot of the solo traveler on a group 
tour. The only thing I had heard was that many single rooms were small. 
</P>
<P>
Were they ever! But no one had mentioned that the lone tourist also could draw 
some strange quarters even on a tour promising all first-class hotels. The 
hotels may be first-class, but that doesn't mean every room is. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hefty Extra Charge 
</P>
<P>
My introduction to tourmanship was a 15-day Western Europe trip for which I 
paid a $425 single supplement in addition to the other per-person charges. The 
tour, arranged by a respected American travel agency and sponsored by a noted 
national organization, turned out to be a good choice for women traveling 
alone, and there were several in the group. No lone men, alas. 
</P>
<P>
We were greeted, guided, directed, counseled and even counted after returning 
from a sightseeing jaunt. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the conscientious tour guide traveling with us had nothing to do 
with room assignments, although it was obvious that there was a prearranged 
routine. On arrival at each hotel on the itinerary the tour guide went to the 
front desk to get a list of the assigned accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
When she called them out, the people sharing double rooms usually received 
their room numbers first, the singles last. 
</P>
<P>
On a tour one bunks where one is put, and it didn't take long to discover that 
solo travelers get the leftovers. Considering the length of the tour, 14 nights 
in hotels in five countries, uncomfortable rooms and/or rooms in undesirable 
locations were in the minority, but of course those were the ones remembered 
most vividly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Austere Rooms 
</P>
<P>
I can scarcely recall the adequate rooms nor picture the austere, closet-size 
rooms that reminded me of a ship's lowest-cost cabin. My journal does remind me 
of my frustration when billed in a really minuscule room in a European chain 
hotel in Wiesbaden, West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"Frugal room with tiny single bed," I reported. "No place to put anything in 
bathroom. Now I know what they mean by 'small.' " I didn't know how good I was 
having it; the worst was yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
The next afternoon, while we were driving through the spectacular Black Forest, 
our motor coach turned off the Autobahn onto a side road and there -- in the 
middle of nowhere -- was a beautiful chalet-style hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1936, new for the Old World, it had balconies with filigreed wooden 
railings, planter boxes brimming with spring flowers and a colorful mural 
painted on the front wall. I was enchanted and could hardly wait to see my 
room. 
</P>
<P>
As usual the doubles were given their room numbers first, and then some of the 
singles were given theirs, but I wasn't among them. It seemed that three of the 
solo travelers, another woman and I and the tour guide, weren't staying in the 
chalet with the others. Our rooms were in the original old hotel across the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
How old was it? "1879" was carved above the entrance but a brass plaque 
commemorated a visit from Goethe, the great German poet, in 1759. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Historic Figures 
</P>
<P>
I also learned that young Marie Antoinette had stayed there in 1770, en route 
to her wedding to the French Dauphin who later became Louis XVI. Perhaps the 
"1879" referred to the year the hotel had last been modernized. The interior 
looked as if that date would be about right. 
</P>
<P>
The original hotel was not a chalet but a bleak, stuccoed building with no 
exterior decoration. About 10 worn stone steps, divided by an iron railing, led 
to the front entrance and ground-floor guest rooms inside. 
</P>
<P>
A wide, winding, carpeted stairway led to the first floor, what we call the 
second floor in the United States, the larger windows indicating the grander 
guest rooms were on that level. Our single-supplement rooms weren't on that 
deck either. 
</P>
<P>
They were on the floor above, reached by a narrow, very steep, uncarpeted 
staircase. The way the risers were constructed one could climb upstairs with 
the full foot on each step, toes under the step above, but descending it was 
necessary to sidle down cautiously, hanging onto the railing. 
</P>
<P>
I was amused, sort of, at the obligatory fire instructions posted at the top -- 
a drawing of a little man running toward that precipitous stairway. Lots of 
luck! There were no fire stairs, of course. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Up Steep Steps 
</P>
<P>
After clambering up those steep steps, burdened by my carry-ons, I was greeted 
at the summit by the affable hotel proprietor. He seemed glad to see me as he 
ushered me to my room, remarking jovially that it had been waiting for me for 
eight weeks. I could see why. 
</P>
<P>
In the late-afternoon light from the small dormer window I saw a room best 
described as "rustic." It looked as if it had been furnished from items stored 
in the attic. 
</P>
<P>
It had a narrow wooden single bed, the mattress covered by a sheet, with a bed 
pillow but no top sheet or blanket. The only covering was a feather-filled 
quilt that slipped off the bed a lot during the night, I discovered later. 
</P>
<P>
Other furnishings included a worn wooden table with an embroidered cloth, a 
wooden wardrobe, and -- the modern piece de resistance -- a telephone, on which 
I never succeeded in getting an outside line. 
</P>
<P>
Between the bedroom and a primitive bathroom, obviously not in the original 
hotel, was a tricky, raised wooden doorsill one had to step over carefully or 
trip and fall headlong. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Didn't Complain 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect I wonder why I didn't have enough sense to protest at being put 
in such a place and in such a room. I'm sure our affable host expected me to, 
which may be why he had come up all those stairs to welcome me. Had I 
complained vociferously enough he might have found me more comfortable 
lodgings. As I didn't, he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
That's one bit of advice I would relay to other solo tourists: Complain if you 
are given an unsuitable room. It just might get you a better one. 
</P>
<P>
The people who assign tour rooms have no way of knowing the needs or physical 
condition of the travelers who will occupy them. Fortunately, I was in good 
enough shape to cope with all those stairs, but there were others who were not. 
</P>
<P>
I met one of them as I was leaving the building for a hike in the Black Forest. 
An elderly heavy-set woman who walked with a cane was painfully climbing those 
10 stone steps to the front entrance of the antique hotel. A member of another 
tour following the same route as ours, she too was a single-supplement traveler 
who had been banished to the old building. 
</P>
<P>
"Didn't they know you walk with a cane?" I asked. "These steps are difficult." 
</P>
<P>
"Our tour guide does," she said, but the crafty hotel proprietor had assured 
her she would be occupying Goethe's room. I wondered who had been conned into 
thinking she had Marie Antoinette's. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Lake Views 
</P>
<P>
The next night we were in Lucerne, Switzerland, in a hotel boasting that 80% of 
its rooms overlooked the lake. Guess what? 
</P>
<P>
My immaculate little room, which reminded me of a hospital room I had once 
occupied, overlooked villas and flats behind the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
However, a compassionate couple invited me in to see the glorious lake view 
from their room. I knew better than to complain about my room, sensing that not 
having a view was one of the solo tourist penalties, but in England I finally 
did complain. 
</P>
<P>
The weather was cool and the room assigned me, in a charming hotel in Kent, was 
spacious and attractive. I glimpsed it only right after checking in, because we 
had arrived so late, due to heavy traffic, so our tour guide told us not to 
change, just to leave our things in our rooms and come right down to dinner. 
</P>
<P>
So it wasn't until after a post-dinner walk enjoying the English countryside 
that I returned to my pretty room to get ready for bed. It was then I realized 
it was suffocatingly hot in there. The window was open but the cool outside air 
was having no effect on the temperature inside. I felt the radiator -- cold -- 
and seeing no other source of heat I called the front desk to explain the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
The clerk promised to send a maintenance man immediately, and minutes later he 
arrived. I told him I had checked everything I could think of, and that the 
window was open but it was still hot. Would he show me what I had overlooked? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Right Over the Pool 
</P>
<P>
The maintenance man nodded solemnly as he too felt the cold radiator. 
</P>
<P>
"It really is sweltering in here," he confirmed, "but I'm afraid it can't be 
helped. You see your room is over the swimming pool, and it's heated 24 hours a 
day." 
</P>
<P>
By then it was too late to ask if another room were available, and as I had to 
get some sleep before another early departure it was a hot night in cool Kent. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, well, if I had only two really uncomfortable rooms, plus a couple that were 
disappointing, in the nine hotels in which I stayed, those aren't bad odds. 
</P>
<P>
Would I pay the single supplement if I take another tour? You betcha! Having a 
private room and bath, no matter how small, after a long day of sightseeing is 
worth every extra dollar. 
</P>
<P>
As for those frequent early a.m. departures, I'll never know how people 
traveling in tandem manage to get bathed, dressed and packed while sharing 
accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
I do have one tip for a woman traveling alone: Don't take anything with a back 
zipper you can't reach by yourself.

YOUTH BEAT: BICYCLING IN BRITAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON, Izon is a Canadian travel journalist covering youth budget 
routes. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bicyclists who are considering a visit to Great Britain but don't know how to 
begin planning a route can get helpful information and suggestions in a free 
publication produced by the British Tourist Authority. 
</P>
<P>
The 35-page "Britain Cycling 1989-90" includes suggestions for 12 routes that 
steer cyclists through the countryside of England, Scotland and Wales. 
</P>
<P>
For each route you'll find a basic map that shows where you can find low-cost 
youth hostel accommodations. Beside each map are notes on sights along the 
route and the locations of tourist information offices. 
</P>
<P>
The booklet also includes information on where you can make reservations for 
bed and breakfast accommodations or camping facilities, plus bicycle rental 
locations, basic traffic laws, tour operators and helpful groups such as the 
Cyclist Touring Club. 
</P>
<P>
The CTC is a membership organization, but does provides some information for 
nonmembers. I visited its office during a day trip, by train from London, and 
found it a good source for more detailed information on British and European 
cycle routes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Avoiding Traffic 
</P>
<P>
For example, the CTC can provide information on the Byway Network, a collection 
of bicycle routes covering Britain that are designed to avoid heavy motor 
traffic. The organization also has a handbook that lists recommended B&amp;Bs 
near cycling routes. 
</P>
<P>
For information on memberships and CTC cycling publications, contact CTC, 
Cottereil House, 69 Meadrow, Godalming, Surrey GU7 3HS, England. 
</P>
<P>
Free copies of "Britain Cycling 1989-90" are available from the British Tourist 
Authority, World Travel Center, 350 S. Figueroa St., Suite 450, Los Angeles 
90071.

New Zealand is one of the most attractive destinations in the world for hikers. 
It has a variety of popular trails, but the most famous is the South Island's 
Milford Track. 
</P>
<P>
The 33-mile trail runs from the top of Lake Te Anau through lush rain forests 
and over an alpine pass to Milford Sound. It takes four days to complete the 
journey. 
</P>
<P>
You can't just go to Te Anau and expect to begin when you choose. The number of 
hikers allowed to set out on the trail each day is limited; your best bet is to 
make reservations well ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Of the two ways you can hike, one is as a member of a group arranged by the 
Tourist Hotel Corp. of New Zealand, the other as an independent walker. THC 
hikers pay $775 N.Z. (about $527 U.S.), plus 10% tax. The fee includes guide 
services and hot meals waiting at warm huts (with men's and women's dormitory 
rooms). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Packs Provided 
</P>
<P>
You have to worry only about carrying your own clothing and sheets, and the THC 
provides simple packs. The group also spends a night at the THC hotel in 
Milford Sound and takes a boat trip out to view the sound area. 
</P>
<P>
Independent walkers must carry their own food and bedding, stay in more Spartan 
huts and make their own arrangements for accommodations in Milford Sound if 
they want a day of rest after the walk. 
</P>
<P>
On a more positive note, independent walkers pay only $122.50 N.Z., tax 
included. Although the accommodations in the Fiordland National Park Huts are 
much simpler, the huts are spaced so you cover more ground the first day and 
have an easier time when you need the energy for hiking up to the mountain 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, seasons south of the Equator are the reverse of ours. The Milford 
Track stays open only until mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
The hiking fees include transportation between the trail and Te Anau. You can 
make reservations to walk with a THC group, or independently, by contacting 
Walshes World at (800) 663-1141. 
</P>
<P>
Correction: An item in last week's column listed an incorrect telephone number. 
To obtain information from outside California on a new 22-day tour of China for 
18- to 30-year-olds, call STI Travel, a Northridge-based youth tour operator, 
toll-free at (800) 225-2780. The in-state number is (800) 637-7687.

NORWAY'S 'SECOND CITY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BERGEN, Norway 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is a city that many travelers put on their "skip" lists. You know, skip it 
this time but maybe get back to it in a millennium or two. 
</P>
<P>
Even more humbling, sometimes Bergen doesn't even make the skip list. Many 
novice travelers have never heard of it. So what if Bergen is the 
second-largest city in Norway? How many people can name the second-largest city 
in, say, the United States? (You can stop worrying about that one -- it's Los 
Angeles.) 
</P>
<P>
But visitors to Norway who stop in Oslo and skip Bergen, intentionally or not, 
are making the same mistake as foreigners who visit New York City but skip Los 
Angeles, yet think they've seen America. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to compare Bergen to Los Angeles. If anything, Bergen looks 
something like San Francisco ought to look. Sort of a mini-San Francisco 
without the tackiness. Instead of Carol Doda's flashing 50-foot silhouette on 
Bergen's main street, Torgalmenningen, there are quiet cafes lit mostly by 
moonlight. 
</P>
<P>
And at the city's delightful wharf area, no fisherman worth his salt will try 
to peddle you yesterday's shrimp stuffed into a cardboard carton with a couple 
of saltines on the side. No, the fish sold here is so fresh it's still 
swallowing the bait. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, though, Bergen is an honest city. 
</P>
<P>
It does not claim to have an Eiffel Tower, a Leaning Tower or, for that matter, 
a Tower Records. And that is what makes it so special. You don't come to Bergen 
to impress your relatives, but to impress yourself. 
</P>
<P>
And it is getting to Bergen that can be the most fun of all. For heaven's sake, 
don't even consider flying here. From Oslo, catch the six-hour Bergen Railway 
train; and take it during the day. Over the last several hours of the ride 
you'll find yourself running from side to side of the coach, trying to look out 
both sides at once. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Picture Post Card Views 
</P>
<P>
Norway is fiord country. It is waterfall country. It is 
yellow-flowers-that-look-like-a-painting country. 
</P>
<P>
On the train ride to Bergen you'll pass through about 200 tunnels, over 300 
bridges and repeat "Look at that . . . " about 400 times. 
</P>
<P>
When you arrive at the train station, don't expect a taxi to be waiting outside 
to whisk you to the nearest Sheraton. Nor a Hilton, Hyatt or Ramada Inn. 
</P>
<P>
Hotels here have names that sound like Baskin-Robbins ice cream flavors. If you 
want a hotel room on the water -- and central -- try Hotel Admiral at 9 C. 
Sundtsgate. There is also the rather fancy Grand Hotel Terminus near the 
railway station. 
</P>
<P>
But if you want to not only see Bergen but also feel it, the place to stay is 
at a guest house. 
</P>
<P>
And one of the nicest of all is Hotel Park Pension, at 35 Harald Harfagres 
Gate. It's in a residential area just a few minutes from town, across from a 
tiny park where swans swim virtually outside your window. This family-run 
pension has just 14 double rooms. Make sure to ask for a room facing the park, 
for which you'll pay about $70 U.S., and that includes breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for a city where a roll of film costs $7 and a mug of beer goes for $6. 
If you drink wine instead of beer and bring your own film, you're fine. 
</P>
<P>
After you check into your guest room the first thing to do in Bergen is head 
for the funicular, a tram that will carry you high above the city to the top of 
Mt. Floyen, from where you can count the six other mountains around Bergen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hiking Trails 
</P>
<P>
And be sure to take a picnic with you. Wooded hiking trails abound at the top 
of Floyen. When you look down at Bergen you will realize that what you're 
seeing is an overgrown village that only thinks it's a city. 
</P>
<P>
Its 220,000 residents are scattered over more than 250 square miles. And if 
Bergen strikes you as more impressive than Oslo, keep in mind that folks back 
in the 13th Century must have thought the same thing. After all, Bergen was the 
first capital of Norway and the country's largest city until the 1830s. 
</P>
<P>
Big cities tend to attract culture, and while Bergen is only big by Norway 
standards, it is no slouch when it comes to music and theater. The Bergen 
Philharmonic Orchestra was started in 1765 and Norway's first permanent theater 
was founded here in 1850. 
</P>
<P>
Nor have its residents forgotten their cultural roots. Each year in late May 
the city hosts a two-week music, drama and dance festival -- the Bergen 
International Festival -- which attracts visitors from around the world. But 
because of the crowds, the best time to visit Bergen is early May, when the 
city is just recovering from its long winter and tourists have yet to arrive in 
Scandinavia. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest industry in Bergen is fishing. If you look one of the 
elephant-skinned fishermen in the eye too long, he might even walk over and say 
hello. 
</P>
<P>
The time to visit fishermen at the inner harbor, the Vagen, is in the morning. 
The Vagen doubles as the setting for the town's flower market. A good sign that 
the prices -- and merchandise -- are OK is that the place is often jammed with 
locals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Let's Go Shopping 
</P>
<P>
Near the harbor are the two busiest shopping streets, Torgalmenningen and 
Torvalm. If you want to buy all your gifts in one stop, try Sundt &amp; Co. at 
14 Torgalmenning, the largest department store. 
</P>
<P>
Wind your way past the entrance, where many tourists grab the overpriced and 
not-very-attractive troll dolls. The best buys in this store are the Norwegian 
knitwear, especially sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
But some of the best high-fashion clothing in Norway, if not in all 
Scandinavia, is at a pricey but imaginatively stocked store, Rene, at 10 
Torgalmenning. You may pay $100 for a pair of slacks or $60 for a sweat shirt, 
but the designs and styles are so unusual that it's worth the splurge. 
</P>
<P>
Of course you didn't come to the fiord capital of Norway to shop. You came to 
see fiords, and the area has more fiords than London has bridges. And it does 
not require days or weeks of sightseeing to get a good look at them. 
</P>
<P>
If your time in Bergen is limited to several days, you can get an excellent 
flavor of fiord country in a one-day excursion. Best of all, this combination 
train, boat and bus will cost you less than $50. And you don't even need a tour 
guide. 
</P>
<P>
Stop in at the tourist information center on Torgalmenning (it's in the square 
of the same name). Tell them you want to take the "Norway in a Nutshell" tour. 
</P>
<P>
They will hand you a one-day itinerary that, at first, appears to be written 
for a rocket scientist. But this 12-hour tour only looks complex because of all 
the transportation involved. It really is simple. And delightful. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Train Ride 
</P>
<P>
You will catch a morning train from Bergen and get off two hours later at a 
tiny town called Myrdal. There you will hop aboard another train, the Flam 
Line, guaranteed to be one of the most memorable 40-minute train rides of your 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Slowly, the five-car train winds down the colorful Flam Valley, dotted with 
dozens of waterfalls. The conductor stops the train frequently just so 
passengers can hop off and take a few pictures. 
</P>
<P>
When the train finally reaches Flam there's time for a quick lunch, then guests 
take a two-hour ferry ride that glides past two fiords, Aurlandesfjord and 
Naeroyfjord, one of the narrowest but most beautiful in Norway. 
</P>
<P>
When the ferry docks in Gudvangen, buses are waiting to take tourists back to 
the train to Bergen, but not without a short stop at the Hotel Stalheim, 5715 
Stalheim in Stalheim. 
</P>
<P>
But don't just stop there. Stay there. 
</P>
<P>
Although this hotel is about 50 miles east of Bergen, it is well worth an 
overnight stay. The views of waterfalls and snowcapped mountains from most of 
its 130 guest rooms are spectacular. Make sure to ask for a room with a 
balcony; it will cost about $130 a night. This hotel is also known for its fine 
food, something of a rarity in Norway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looking for Seafood 
</P>
<P>
For a harbor town, Bergen has a surprising lack of good seafood restaurants. 
One of the few is Enjorningen (Unicorn), in the heart of the city in a building 
that has been restored in the decor of the 1700s. 
</P>
<P>
If you just want a light snack but want to see what little night life there is 
in Bergen, try a spot called Dickens at 8 Ole Bulls Place. 
</P>
<P>
For a cup of coffee and a taste of the Bohemian side of Bergen, stop in at Cafe 
Opera at 24 Engen. The place is packed with students, many of whom wear sweat 
shirts bearing names of American football teams, though few know a Green Bay 
Packer from a Minnesota Viking. 
</P>
<P>
Bergen is not a city to make the focal point of a European vacation. Paris or 
Rome it is not, but perhaps that is what makes it so inviting. After touring 
the European capitals for a few weeks, why not settle back for several days of 
rest among the fiords? 
</P>
<P>
And perhaps even some romance. A woman from the Denver area recently traveled 
to Bergen to attend the wedding of her best friend, who was marrying a 
Norwegian. The Denver woman took her boyfriend along. 
</P>
<P>
Less than a year later this same Denver couple returned to Bergen for their own 
wedding. They were married atop Mt. Floyen, 1,050 feet above the city. And the 
entire wedding party had to ride the funicular to the top of the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
"The man who drove the tram up wouldn't accept the ($3) fare from any of us," 
said the bride. "In fact, on the ride back down, he gave us a bottle of wine." 
</P>

THEIR WALK DOWN THE AISLE BEGINS IN IRISH CASTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY FLORMAN, Florman is a Santa Ana free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CONG, Ireland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 60 years Aunt Betty rued the day her mother-in-law tagged along on her 
honeymoon. Imagine her reaction if not only both mothers had shown up, but 70 
others too. 
</P>
<P>
But that's exactly what happened last fall when Jeannette Tirico Bean traveled 
6,000 miles to walk down the aisle, accompanied by guests who bought a tour 
package for an odyssey of lodging in Irish castles, sing-alongs in pubs, 
medieval dinners with pageants and touring in jaunting carts, culminating in a 
wedding at a 13th-Century castle. 
</P>
<P>
In a creative fervor, the groom turned a marriage celebration into a travel 
adventure and a happening for a little town called Cong. The wedding 
invitation, designed as a travel brochure, promised "A Wedding Happening in 
Ireland" that was "unmatched in the annals of Irish wakes and weddings." A 
postscript declared: "No gifts, but it will cost you!" 
</P>
<P>
The embryo of the trip began seven years before when Allan Armstrong, a 
widower, became captivated by the lush majestic grounds of Ashford Castle in 
Cong. He and his brother had just returned from a round of golf, skirting sand 
traps shaped into four-leaf clovers. Allan said, "I don't plan to marry again, 
but if I do, here's where I want the ceremony." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
He Pops the Question 
</P>
<P>
Seven years later, when he popped the question to Bean, he also laid the ground 
rules for the ceremony: "We can either spend $20,000 feeding 200 fat people who 
don't need to eat, or we can take the family to Ireland." 
</P>
<P>
The guest list ballooned to include extended family and friends, with requests 
(not granted) from such varied characters as a chief of police across the state 
who heard reports of the impending happening. 
</P>
<P>
The odyssey began at Shannon Airport, where we boarded buses for the ride past 
enchanting scenes of silence: swans gliding in meandering rivers visited by 
swallows and water hens; lazy sheep grazing on rocky green hillsides; heather 
and lichen clinging to granite boulders, and meadows crisscrossed by rows of 
gray rocks gathered from the surrounding hillsides and stacked neatly into low 
walls. From crevices between rocks sprouted lacy yellow and pink flowers. 
</P>
<P>
The groom-to-be belted a continuous rendition of "Get Me to the Church on 
Time," with the wedding enclave chiming in with the chorus as we traveled in 
dual motor coaches from Shannon to Limerick, to the Lakes of Killarney, along 
the rugged Cliffs of Moher to Galway, and ending on the shores of Lough Corrib 
at romantic Ashford Castle. 
</P>
<P>
There, on the eve of the festivities in the castle's Dungeon Bar, rousing 
choruses of "Rose of Tralee," "When Irish Eyes Are Smiling" and "My Wild Irish 
Rose" were climaxed by a final and perfected bravura cantata of "Get Me . . . " 
by the ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
The arrival at the castle the next day proved almost as stirring as the 
ceremony at the little abbey. 
</P>
<P>
Entering the grounds through the 15-foot walled massive gate, our buses 
meandered over a narrow driveway winding over soft hills shaded by immense 
gnarled elms. Ashford Castle, with its castellated battlements, loomed ahead at 
the crest of the hill. 
</P>
<P>
In castle-like protocol, we received a royal greeting by footmen attired in 
livery who attended to the luggage. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, thick carpets, chirping birds and colorful modern paintings helped 
create the ambiance of a family home, dispelling the cold draftiness of most 
stone castles. Antique furniture and objets d'art reflected the castle's early 
history as Ashford House. Armor from the early days of the castle stood guard. 
</P>
<P>
The grand foyer/reception hall, where we were received by the staff, was built 
by the Arthur G. Guinness family of the famous black stout and "Book of World 
Records." From the hall, where welcoming scones were served on an elaborate 
silver tea set, we viewed the majestic manicured emerald lawns that stretch 
down to a tranquil lake. 
</P>
<P>
A hunting and fishing preserve, Ashford lies in 700 acres of forest and golfing 
greens, 45 minutes north of Galway along the banks of Lough Corrib, the second 
largest lake in Ireland with its hundreds of islands, bays and coves. 
</P>
<P>
Built in French chateau style with battlements carved by ancient stonemasons, 
the castle traces its beginnings to the 13th-Century de Burgo Castle. 
Downstairs in the dungeon, which was transformed into the bar where the wedding 
revelers would sing that evening, was the site of the original lounge built for 
the king's private entertainment of a few honored guests. 
</P>
<P>
Though most of its reconstruction occurred over 30 years in the 19th Century by 
Lord Ardiluan, Ashford's sleeping accommodations have recently been modernized. 
</P>
<P>
The grandest room of all, the Presidential Suite, named for the stay of Ronald 
and Nancy Reagan, was reserved for the bridal couple. The suite is decorated in 
yellow and white French antique furniture replete with a living room and 
fireplace, king-sized bed on a pedastle atop a sitting area, and a separate 
dressing room with closet 30 feet long. A bay window overlooks flaming gardens 
of hydrangeas and roses extending to Lough Corrib. 
</P>
<P>
While the bride and groom finalized the next day's plans, we strolled through 
the formal gardens and across stone bridges along the banks of the Cong River. 
</P>
<P>
On the grounds sits a tiny village of houses enveloped in climbing vines, built 
for the filming of the movie "The Quiet Man." The cottage where John Wayne once 
swept the raven-tressed Maureen O'Hara off her feet, and where he fought 
raucously with Victor McLaglen, is a gift store. The other bungalows are homes 
for groundskeepers. 
</P>
<P>
The next afternoon, with an air of merriment, our wedding party filed into St. 
Mary's Church in Cong through a subterranean door in a wall of a medieval 
abbey. On the outside the small stone chapel, sheathed in gray stone, blended 
with the ancient wall. Inside, the chapel was startlingly modern, with stark 
white walls, angled glass and skylight. 
</P>
<P>
Father Brian Kavanagh, a retired university professor filling in for the ailing 
rector of the parish, officiated. While the groom cried, the priest regaled the 
congregation with jokes until the bride and groom composed themselves. "We 
don't want Allan to claim duress later," he warned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Phenomenon for the Town 
</P>
<P>
The wedding turned into a phenomenon for the little town of Cong as well. The 
villagers looked forward to this momentous American event. The groom, with 
typical Irish devilment, had hoodwinked the newspapers into reporting that 
there were "six millionaires who (had) jetted into Ireland to wish the couple 
well." The town folk made ready. 
</P>
<P>
Following the ceremony they came rushing out of their homes to join the 
merrymaking, waving dish towels and children in their arms. One man dashed from 
his dinner table with a napkin still tucked under his chin. A matron, arms 
filled with sacks of rice and not sure which of the two buses held the bridal 
couple, pelted both. 
</P>
<P>
Back at the castle, as part of the wedding banquet, we were feted to a 25-pound 
challah bread baked earlier that day by a member of the wedding party. 
</P>
<P>
The California champagne, toasted at the dinner, had been toted into the 
country by our group. Acceptance of the wedding invitation included an 
agreement to carry one bottle of champagne supplied by the wedding couple. 
Since Ireland levies an exorbitant duty on imported champagnes, champagne at 
weddings is unheard of in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Though this area of Ireland normally experiences "soft weather" (Irish for 
rain), even the elements celebrated the American union with a two-week gift of 
sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Irish castles offer fanciful nuptial settings. Ireland has a three-week 
residency requirement, so it is recommended that couples arrange a civil 
ceremony before leaving the United States, followed by religious rites at the 
castle of choice. 
</P>
<P>
Reservations are more difficult to get at Ashford Castle. When Jeanette Bean 
made her reservations only one date was open, and that was a year later. 
</P>
<P>
Arrangements should be made at least a year in advance, taking into 
consideration that April, May and October are generally the driest months. For 
more information about the castle, write to Mary O'Donovan, Sales and 
Promotions, Ashford Castle, Cong, Country Mayo, Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Bean-Armstrong nuptials were Catholic, the castle often hosts other 
denominations. A stately Gothic wooden chapel on the grounds accommodates 
Protestant weddings. Inquiries should be directed to O'Donovan. Jewish couples 
may contact the head rabbi in Dublin for assistance: Rabbi E. Mirvis, Stratford 
Schools, 1 Zion Road, 6 Dublin. 
</P>
<P>
Wedding requests to St. Mary's Church, as well as other Catholic churches, must 
be accompanied by a letter from an American parish priest certifying the "good 
standing" of the applicants. 
</P>
<P>
Men's formal attire may be rented and reserved by writing to Patrick Ryan 
Haberdashery, Galway, Ireland. Renting a complete cutaway package, including 
top hat and gloves, is about $20 U.S. 
</P>
<P>
Travel arrangements may be made through a travel agent or by calling an Aer 
Lingus sales manager. CIE TOURS International, the tour company of the Irish 
government, can arrange seven-day-plus package tours. 
</P>

THE MATURE TRAVELER: SENIORS HAVE CHANCE AT HORSE PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HUGHES, Hughes is a 30-year veteran travel writer living in Sherman 
Oaks. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FITS Equestrian, a Solvang-based agency that has specialized in horse-riding 
tours around the world for six years, is looking to corral some mature 
travelers. 
</P>
<P>
These tours are not for travelers whose experience is limited to the carrousel 
at Santa Monica Pier or an occasional canter through Griffith Park. The trips 
will appeal to people who really know -- and enjoy -- riding on a regular 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
"The typical one- to two-week tour we offer now is shared by riders of all 
ages, including some in their 80s," said Peggy Hallauer, who runs the agency 
with her husband, Wolfgang, a retired Los Angeles surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
"Once at the destination, be it Ireland, Egypt or Southern California, all 
travel is by horseback, four to six hours a day. Overnights are spent in a 
comfortable inn or hotel, maybe a castle or two in Europe, or, on more rugged 
tours, in tents." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Open to All Types 
</P>
<P>
But travel is not limited to the more adventurous kind. 
</P>
<P>
"We've found that older riders often prefer a more leisurely paced riding tour, 
with comfortable accommodations and the companionship of riders of similar age 
and interests," Peggy said. "So Wolfgang has decided to form the 60+ Club, with 
tours specifically planned for their age and riding level." 
</P>
<P>
The 60+ Club is in its formative stage right now, though FITS Equestrian sells 
riding tours to many seniors on an individual basis. 
</P>
<P>
Their "Riding Vacations Around the World" brochure lists horseback trips to 
such exotic destinations as the Pyramids of Egypt, deserts of Morocco, the game 
plains of Kenya and Tanzania, and the jungles of Belize. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different Levels of Skill 
</P>
<P>
All rides note the amount of daily time in the saddle and the pace to be 
expected, from slow to fast. Having been on all the tours they offer, the 
Hallauers know that not all are for the average mature traveler with only 
modest riding experience. 
</P>
<P>
The Hallauers hope to have some 60+ Club senior riding tours ready by 
midsummer. 
</P>
<P>
"These could be anything from a three-day 'Gourmet Ride' in Southern 
California, with easy-gaited horses and 'luxury camping,' to tours of one week 
or longer (about 12 riders) to the Ardennes Forest in Belgium, Alsace in France 
or around Siena, Italy, escorted by a horseback-riding art professor," said 
Peggy, who along with Wolfgang has checked out all the trips they offer. 
</P>
<P>
"Seniors might also be interested in leisurely paced riding trips in Jamaica. 
Or, during the winter, maybe the Outback in Australia, perhaps New Zealand, or 
down to South America with the gauchos of Argentina." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special Dates Arranged 
</P>
<P>
Special dates are arranged just for the senior groups. Tour members will be 
matched with horses according to their riding ability. 
</P>
<P>
The cost per tour ranges from about $600 to $1,200, depending on destination 
and length of tour. This does not include air fare, which the Hallauers can 
arrange, from the most economical to first-class. 
</P>
<P>
Tour prices include all accommodations, most meals, horse and gear, plus 
escort-guide and transfers of baggage from stop to stop. 
</P>
<P>
For more information on either the 60+ Club or one of the more than 50 tours 
already set for all age levels, contact FITS Equestrian, 2011 Alamo Pintado 
Road, Solvang, Calif. 93463, (805) 688-9494. 
</P>
<P>
Correction: In a recent column an error made it appear that Great Western 
Travel in Pasadena operated tours to East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland, 
Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. Great Western has just one inclusive 
tour to Eastern Europe; this includes all those countries and is set for Aug. 
27 to Sept. 17, for $3,495 per person, based on double occupancy. For 
information: (818) 578-1161.

The article "Making a Pilgrimage to Colorful, Remote China" (Feb. 12) was

CASTING SPELLS

I am surprised that in these days of consumer (subscriber) protection you have 
failed to warn readers that Judith Morgan can be a "trouble maker." I have 
enjoyed her many and varied trips second-hand through her articles, but it was 
not until February, 1988, and her series on Antarctica that I became aware of 
the power of bewitchment. What gives her the right to cast her spells on us 
innocent, routine encumbered readers, or the right to rekindle old dreams. 
</P>
<P>
I have thought of her encroachment into my life many times since that series, 
especially last January when I, too, experienced (firsthand this time) 
pepper-and-salt ridges of penguins, incredible icebergs (though not as large as 
Rhode Island), pink skies and the indescribable beauty of the Antarctic. Thanks 
for sharing her travels and literary skill with us.

I would like to add another voice about the negative treatment afforded 
international passengers from abroad using the Tom Bradley terminal at Los 
Angeles International Airport. Jeane M. Nutt of Pasadena in her letter, "First 
Impressions" (Jan. 15), commented that there is no free luggage-cart service or 
currency-change facilities in the luggage area. Just as important is the lack 
of restrooms, telephones or benches for the elderly while waiting for customs 
and immigration clearance.

EVEN THE 'ELITE' CAN'T BUY IN 'FANTASYLAND'; 
</P>
<P>
ANNUAL SALARY OF $75,000 ISN'T ENOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH J. GARCIA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You're a member of Los Angeles County's elite, among the 11% of households that 
earned at least $75,000 in 1988. Your career is on the rise and you're ready to 
buy your first home. You're looking for a prestige location, a good 
neighborhood, clean air and a relatively short commute to work. You're looking 
on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
But unless you get a raise soon, you're living in Fantasyland. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Repeat-Buyer Market 
</P>
<P>
Economists and real estate brokers say the area is almost completely closed now 
to first-time buyers. They refer to the Westside almost exclusively as a 
repeat-buyer market, a place where only those who have built up enough equity 
in another home can afford to shop, although mortgage payments are high enough 
to discourage some homeowners from trading up. 
</P>
<P>
A family with $100,000 in equity in their home shopping for a modest 
three-bedroom Santa Monica house could easily spend $450,000. The estimated 
$3,300 monthly mortgage, tax and insurance payments would require an annual 
income of nearly $120,000. 
</P>
<P>
"What you're really talking about on the Westside is an extremely exclusive 
real estate market," said Joel Singer, the chief economist for the California 
Assn. of Realtors. "The main access point into that market for most people is 
previous gains in real estate. The prices today are just too high for most 
others." 
</P>
<P>
The others include people like Jim and Michael Padden, brothers in Santa Monica 
who have been looking to buy a house or a duplex on the Westside. Between the 
brothers and Jim's wife, they earn nearly $150,000 a year, but since they began 
looking in 1988, they've seen prices rise more than $100,000 for properties 
"you wouldn't even consider renting," Jim Padden said. 
</P>
<P>
Their house-hunting tale is typical of people who have looked at Westside real 
estate. The Paddens started looking in Santa Monica, their first choice, and 
quickly realized that it was out of their reach. Then they moved their house 
hunt to neighboring communities, and were amazed at prices in once-affordable 
areas like Westchester and Mar Vista. Then they began looking in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
Today, their search is on hold. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's Crazy' 
</P>
<P>
"It's like running on a treadmill," Jim Padden said. "The prices are moving so 
fast that you can't catch up. We'd see places and I'd say to myself, they want 
$350,000 for that! And then six months pass and you find out that the same 
place sold for $400,000. It's crazy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's depressing because you end up thinking that you'll never be able to make 
enough money to afford one of these places. It's not like we're trying to buy a 
place in Beverly Hills." 
</P>
<P>
Although they realize that they can afford nice homes in nearby communities in 
the South Bay and in parts of the San Fernando Valley, the Paddens have been 
holding out for a Westside property because of its central location and easy 
access to their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"We're from here and after living on the Westside, with the weather, nice 
neighborhoods, the shops, the restaurants and the ease of getting to work, it's 
hard to give it up," Michael said. "I'm willing to pay a lot more money to get 
a lot less house to live where I want to live." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Very Small House 
</P>
<P>
Households earning $90,000, three times the median income in Los Angeles 
County, are now often limited to a very small house, a condo, a major 
fixer-upper, a probate sale or "something nestled under the freeway," according 
to one Westside real estate agent. 
</P>
<P>
Prospective Westside home buyers are helpless onlookers in the endless battle 
between supply and demand. According to economists, the limited amount of land 
available for new home construction in the Westside has increased the number of 
buyers bidding on available housing. 
</P>
<P>
For people like the Paddens, who grew up in West Los Angeles, the surging home 
prices are particularly disappointing. They say that they are being priced out 
of the neighborhoods where they were raised. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Were Dumps' 
</P>
<P>
"The most frustrating thing is the realization that you may never be able to do 
it," Michael Padden said. "Some of the places we could afford, but they were 
dumps. And the longer you wait, the more the prices go up." 
</P>
<P>
His brother said that after a while, soaring prices "reach a point of 
diminishing return" where house shoppers wonder whether it's worth spending in 
excess of $400,000 for a place that they don't really want. 
</P>
<P>
Both brothers live in rent-controlled apartments in Santa Monica. Today they're 
wondering whether they are going to have to stay in them. 
</P>
<P>
"You end up saving all of your money and all you can afford is a 
900-square-foot house with one bathroom," Jim Padden said. "You just wake up 
one day and you realize that you've been squeezed out of your neighborhood."

PROGRAM GIVES STUDENTS EARLY START IN COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MITCHELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year's worth of college credit and the guarantee of admission to West Los 
Angeles College and UCLA are being offered to a select group of Hamilton High 
School minority and low-income students as an incentive to continue their 
education. 
</P>
<P>
This year, about 160 Hamilton students will participate in the "supergraduate 
program." Students in the program can take college courses to earn up to 32 
units of credit while working on their high school diplomas. After graduation, 
they will attend West Los Angeles College for one year to earn an associate 
degree. They can then transfer to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which is financed by a $15,000 grant from the Sears-Roebuck 
Foundation, will begin this summer with 10th- and 11th-graders, school 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Win-Win Situation' 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Schools Supt. Leonard Britton said the program will encourage 
students to stay in school. 
</P>
<P>
"It will broaden their experience. . . . It's a win-win situation for students, 
teachers, schools, for everyone," said Britton who spoke at a press conference 
attended by officials from Los Angeles schools, West Los Angeles College and 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Phelps, chancellor of the Los Angeles Community College District that 
includes West Los Angeles College, said the program is designed to attract 
students who might be intimidated by a college setting. "I want to see them 
early on. They need to feel that you don't have to be 18 years old to go to a 
college," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Students will be given additional training in study skills, essay writing and 
library use, school official said. They also will be helped with the transition 
from high school to college with tutoring and special guidance programs. A 
parents group will be organized to provide additional support, school officials 
said. "It's not just a matter of recruiting kids, it's making sure that they 
have the tools to be successful," said Eva Baker, associate dean of UCLA's 
Graduate School of Education. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Academic Requirements 
</P>
<P>
Students in the program are required to remain in good academic standing, 
maintaining at least a B-minus average each semester at Hamilton and at West 
Los Angeles Community College. Those who fail to do so will be placed on 
academic probation for two semesters. Students who remain on probation for more 
than two semesters will be dropped from the program. 
</P>
<P>
School officials said other high schools are considering similar programs. 
</P>
<P>
School board member Alan Gershman, whose district includes Hamilton High 
School, called the program an "exciting example of a new educational 
partnership." 
</P>
<P>
All three institutions will benefit from the program, school officials said. 
Hamilton will increase the number of college-bound students; West Los Angeles 
College will receive students motivated to complete their courses, and UCLA 
will increase the number of minority transfer students. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton is accepting applications for admission to the program. A committee of 
teachers from Hamilton, West Los Angeles College and UCLA will select the 
participants.

W. HOLLYWOOD CHAMBER WON'T BACK BOND ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opponents of a $7.6-million bond issue to build a new library and fire station 
in West Hollywood last week gained an ally in the West Hollywood Chamber of 
Commerce, which announced it will not support the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the measure burdensome, chamber President Mark Lehman said the group is 
concerned "with the prospect of having tax proposals presented in a piecemeal 
fashion without adequate consideration of the cumulative impact" on businesses. 
</P>
<P>
But he and other officials were careful to point out that the chamber's 
opposition is unrelated to the city's plans to build a civic center in West 
Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Civic center opponents have sought to make the bond measure -- to be decided by 
voters on April 11 -- a referendum on the center. They view the measure as a 
backhanded attempt to squeeze more money for the center, since both the library 
and fire station were originally part of the center's design. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chamber's Stand 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Lehman said that the chamber "isn't coming out against the 
bond measure. . . . All we're saying is that we aren't going to support it. 
We're not going to get involved." 
</P>
<P>
However, in a message mailed to 450 chamber members outlining the position of 
the group's six-member executive committee, Lehman sounded a negative note. 
</P>
<P>
"We must address and develop compensating strategies to improve parking and 
other business concerns before we burden our city businesses that are already 
suffering from increasing competition from neighboring communities," the 
message said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a leading opponent of the civic center whose group is campaigning 
against the bond measure said he was pleased with the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
"They (chamber officials) don't want to rattle cages any more than they have 
to, because they don't want to lose any friends on the City Council, but their 
position is favorable to us, so we've got to be happy," said Tom Larkin, 
chairman of the Save Our Parks Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the five City Council members are on record as supporting the project, 
with Councilman Steve Schulte opposed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reserve Fund 
</P>
<P>
Angered by plans to use scarce park space for the civic center, opponents have 
argued that the city should dip into its $14-million reserve fund to pay for 
the fire station and library and then let voters decide whether the center 
should be built. 
</P>
<P>
Larkin's group hopes to place an initiative on the April, 1990, ballot aimed at 
preventing the civic center from being built in the park. 
</P>
<P>
The group last week submitted 3,358 signatures to the city clerk's office. Only 
2,182 valid signatures are needed to qualify the measure for the 1990 ballot. 
The validation process is expected to take a month. 
</P>
<P>
However, city officials have hinted they may try to challenge the legality of 
the initiative, should it qualify for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Paul Brotzman said there was some question as to whether such an 
initiative could be used to restrict the City Council's powers in deciding how 
park space is used. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two-Thirds Vote 
</P>
<P>
He and other officials have insisted that the prospect of a ballot initiative 
would not interfere with West Hollywood's ability to finance the project. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have budgeted $1.5 million for civic center planning for the 
current fiscal year, which ends June 30. In addition to the architects, a 
project engineer has been on the job for several months, and preliminary design 
work and site surveying continues. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the center's opponents have focused their attention on defeating the 
bond measure, which requires a two-thirds vote for passage. 
</P>
<P>
The 61-member West Hollywood Community Alliance, which consists mostly of 
owners of small businesses on the city's east side, is expected to make known 
its position on the bond issue this week. 
</P>
<P>
The group has scheduled a community forum on Wednesday featuring Schulte, who 
has been prominent in opposing the bond issue along with the civic center, and 
Councilman John Heilman, an outspoken supporter of placing the center in the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the bond issue would increase property taxes by up to $33.47 per 
$100,000 of assessed valuation over the next 20 years to pay for the new fire 
station and quadruple the size of the county branch library that serves West 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't met a business person yet who supports the bond issue, and my 
feeling is that most of the people in the business community don't favor the 
park being used for the civic center," said Mike Radcliffe, who is on the West 
Hollywood Community Alliance board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
However, Lehman offered a different view. 
</P>
<P>
"My understanding is that the bulk of chamber members are supportive of the 
civic center. I think the perception is that we've been through a long haul, 
it's an expensive process, and we ought to go forward with it."

<P>
A FRENZIED MARKET BREEDS STAGGERING SELLING PRICES AS BUYERS WRESTLE FOR ACCESS 
TO LIFE STYLE, PRESTIGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Each year, the traffic gets more congested. New commercial construction blots 
out residential views. Developers and environmentalists battle for every 
remaining piece of open space. Parking becomes increasingly scarce. Homeowner 
groups raise their voices in protest. 
</P>
<P>
And real estate prices in the Westside continue to soar to new heights. 
</P>
<P>
Forget the complaints about the crumbling quality of life on the Westside. 
Hordes of affluent home buyers are lining up, sometimes with millions in cash, 
to grab a chunk of land as close as they can to the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outpacing the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
The prices are staggering. Middle- and upper-income families are being frozen 
out of the modest Westside neighborhoods. Former blue-collar communities are 
becoming havens for starch-collared corporate executives. And in a city as 
celebrity-conscious as Los Angeles, real estate agents are becoming stars, 
sought after by the rich and famous. 
</P>
<P>
Economists predict that real estate prices in the section of Los Angeles County 
bordered on the north by the Santa Monica Mountains, on the south by Los 
Angeles International Airport and on the east by Western Avenue, will continue 
to outpace all but a few communities in the United States during the next few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The average sale price of single-family homes jumped more than $100,000 in at 
least 10 Westside areas over the past year, according to sales reported through 
multiple listing services. The average sale price in several other communities 
jumped more than $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
In the sharpest increase reported, the average sale price of a single-family 
home in Playa del Rey rose 63% in 1988, leaping to a new high of $603,000. And 
that's with airport noise. The listing prices were even higher. 
</P>
<P>
And the homes for sale on the Westside were on the market only half as long as 
they were a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Although the real estate boom engulfed numerous areas of the Southland, 
particularly such hot spots as Pasadena, Glendale, and the West San Fernando 
Valley, the surge pumped up the already-steep prices in numerous Westside 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
The average sale price of single-family homes in Beverly Hills and Bel-Air 
already top the $1 million mark. Next year, Brentwood probably will join that 
list. Malibu and Pacific Palisades are only a few years away. 
</P>
<P>
Why the house-buying frenzy? What is driving up the asking and selling prices 
of Westside bungalows to mansion levels? 
</P>
<P>
Industry experts say it's a simple imbalance between supply and demand. 
Available Westside land is almost used up, and with a booming regional economy 
luring people from around the country to Los Angeles, more and more people are 
lining up to try to buy the best properties. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the only thing that would make the escalation stop would be if the 
financial services community doesn't make as much money available to home 
buyers," said Michael Salkin, an economist and senior vice president at First 
Interstate Bank. "But I don't think the trend will reverse until the state of 
California no longer attracts households for economic reasons." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little New Housing 
</P>
<P>
Although population growth on the Westside has lagged behind the rest of Los 
Angeles County -- rising only 8% since 1980, compared with 12% countywide -- 
the fixed housing supply has dramatically lifted sale prices. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same phenomenon that occurs in San Francisco, where even if the 
population rises only slightly, there is still very little new housing being 
built," said Salkin. 
</P>
<P>
"Prices won't stop increasing until the population drops or the economic 
strength shifts to other parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental fact is that you've got a lot more people chasing houses than 
there are houses available." 
</P>
<P>
In the past 12 months, while the demand for housing surged throughout Southern 
California, the Westside was targeted by a huge influx of home buyers. Industry 
analysts say that the already limited inventory of housing previously has been 
sold in only three months. In the last few years, it would have taken eight to 
12 months to exhaust the supply of single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
"The price pressures on the Westside are reflective of much of coastal 
California," said Joel Singer, chief economist for the California Assn. of 
Realtors. "You will continue to have rising prices on the Westside because of 
the scarcity of land. As the job market on the Westside continues to grow, it 
will promote a further demand for housing, but it's not going to generate new 
housing." 
</P>
<P>
The result will be a continuing trend of what real estate agents call multiple 
bid offers, where groups of prospective buyers try to outspend each other for 
newly listed properties. Singer and other economists say they haven't seen 
anything like it since a similar housing boom in the late '70s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few New Homes 
</P>
<P>
Ben Bartolotto, director of the Construction Industry Research Board, said the 
small supply of new homes on the Westside will continue to drive existing home 
prices up. 
</P>
<P>
"Of all the construction in Los Angeles County, the Westside accounts for less 
than 10%," he said. "The only things that are being built are either condos or 
very large and prestigious single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
"When you combine that with the already high land prices, you're talking about 
a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
Real estate market watchdogs point to foreign investment in Westside properties 
as another reason house prices are jumping off the charts. 
</P>
<P>
"The increase of foreign capital is the wild card," Singer said. "Clearly it 
increases the demand and pushes the prices even higher. But there's no way to 
quantify it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Last Year Was Crazy' 
</P>
<P>
However, industry experts say that although they expect Westside real estate 
prices to continue to rise, they will rise at a much slower rate than they did 
in 1988, when home prices rose an average of 23%. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year was crazy," said Jon Douglas, president of the real estate company 
which bears his name. "I've never seen anything like it." 
</P>
<P>
Some industry analysts are concerned that the rising price of homes throughout 
the Westside may begin to change the character of the community. They say that 
the elements that make the area so desirable -- good weather, lots of cultural 
offerings, new jobs and overall panache -- are shifting the base of the 
community from just very expensive to nearly exclusive. 
</P>
<P>
"What the numbers mask is that you've got a different population in the 
Westside now, more affluent," said Salkin. "In a situation like that, the 
cultural, the ethnic and the employment characteristics will change, but it 
doesn't happen overnight." 
</P>
<P>
The overall effect of the decrease in moderate housing could be a reassessment 
-- and ultimate rejection -- of Westside properties by prospective home buyers, 
according to some real estate experts. But even they predict it will be years 
before there is any significant drop in the price of housing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drop in Value? 
</P>
<P>
"The future housing situation depends on a lot of different scenarios such as 
the increasing traffic problem and the effect that has on new (commercial) 
building in the area," said Kathleen M. Connell, chair of the Center for 
Finance and Real Estate at UCLA's Graduate School of Management. "If there 
continues to be a lack of affordable rental housing and people can no longer 
afford to work on the Westside, then I do think you will see a revaluation of 
what has been a substantial premium of living on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't anticipate a great drop in value, but whether it increases as rapidly 
as in the past is doubtful," she said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Douglas said the factors that make Westside housing so expensive are 
not likely to change. He said that in the last decade, the price of detached 
single-family homes there has risen an average of 16% each year. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the rent-control atmosphere that exists in places like Santa 
Monica, you're not going to see much new development," Douglas said. "So the 
existing base price of residences in the area will continue to go up. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the last 20 years, with the exception of a couple of recessions, Westside 
real estate values have never gone down. I think that will continue to happen 
as long as people can continue to afford those properties on the Westside." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Highly Affordable 
</P>
<P>
If that's the case, Westside properties will sell at at escalating rates for a 
long time. First Interstate's Salkin said, however, that by world standards, 
the Westside is highly affordable. 
</P>
<P>
"When you compare it to places like Tokyo and Hong Kong, it's not expensive," 
he said. "America is still fairly underpriced compared to the rest of the 
industrial countries. We're a bargain basement society when it comes to 
houses." 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, the median sales price of a home rose from $150,000 in January, 
1988, to $177,000 in December, 1988, and $185,000 in January, 1989, according 
the the California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 850,000 California homes were sold, 250,000 of them new. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Fairly Unique' Market 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at whether housing is overpriced in California, all you have to 
see is that nearly 1 million people bought homes at these prices," Salkin said. 
"So are housing payments exaggerated here? It's tough . . . to say yes." 
</P>
<P>
Although Singer said the Westside was a "fairly unique" market, he said a few 
other areas in the country are comparable, such as Stamford, Conn., 
Westchester, N.Y., and the Peninsula communities outside San Francisco, such as 
Hillsborough, Palo Alto and Atherton. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at the prices in the Westside, it really is incredible," Singer 
said. "But there doesn't appear to be any shortage of people here who can 
afford it." 
</P>

PAROLE OFFICE CRITICS TO SPEAK OUT;

HASTINGS RANCH HOMEOWNERS FEAR CRIME WILL INCREASE IN NEIGHBORHOOD

<P>
Two homeowners' groups fighting a proposal to locate a parole office near their 
homes are planning to meet with state officials Monday night to voice their 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Residents near the proposed site at 468 N. Rosemead Blvd., fear that crime will 
increase in their neighborhood if the office is allowed to open there, said 
Harold Britton, president of Lower Hastings Ranch Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"People are appalled because children walk past there every day to go to 
school," Britton said. His group has joined forces with the Upper Hastings 
Ranch Homeowners Assn. to fight the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners' groups are collecting signatures on a petition opposing the 
site, Britton said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed site is one of five locations in Pasadena that state officials had 
been studying. 
</P>
<P>
"The one that right now we're considering is the one on Rosemead," said Joseph 
Garcia, an assistant unit supervisor for the state Department of Corrections. 
"It's the one that's more logically located. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meets State Criteria 
</P>
<P>
"It's a commercial street and it met the criteria when our people were looking 
for office space," Garcia said. He said it is difficult to find parole office 
sites that are not close to residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
The five possible locations are all within one to three blocks of residential 
areas, he said. He would not disclose the other locations being studied. 
</P>
<P>
Britton said 12 members of the homeowners' associations are real estate agents 
and all are willing to help find other sites in Pasadena that they believe will 
be more appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said there is no evidence to support residents' concerns about increased 
crime should a parole office open near their homes. "I just can't buy into 
that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police in Monterey Park and Alhambra said that crime in the area increased 
after a parole office was opened last year near the border between the two 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
Community opposition to that office, 1723 W. Garvey Ave., Alhambra, prompted 
state officials to agree to close it by Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The Monday night meeting with parole officials is scheduled for 7:30 at 
Nazarene Church, 3700 Sierra Madre Blvd.

TV COMMERCIALS IN THE CLASSROOM ARE NO BIG DEAL TO GAHR STUDENTS

Students at Gahr High School wonder what all the fuss is about. 
</P>
<P>
Every school-day morning since March 6, Gahr students have been watching a new 
teen-oriented TV news broadcast called Channel One, produced by Whittle 
Communications of Knoxville, Tenn. Each 12-minute program, being aired on an 
experimental basis in classrooms at six high schools throughout the United 
States, includes two minutes of commercials for jeans, chewing gum and other 
products young people buy. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for showing the current-events program, Gahr and each of the other 
schools received $50,000 worth of electronic equipment, including 25-inch color 
televisions for every classroom, two videocassette recorders and a satellite 
dish. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the commercials on Channel One, however, the program has been 
condemned by the National Education Assn., the American Federation of Teachers 
and both the California and the National Parent-Teachers Assns., among others. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, National PTA President Manya Ungar of Chicago said the 
group's leaders "applaud efforts to bring new technology into our schools. 
However, we are opposed to making the availability of that technology and 
programming contingent upon subjecting a captive student audience to the 
promotion of commercial products or services." 
</P>
<P>
But at Gahr, the only school in the West taking part in the pilot program, 
students and staff seem surprised at what many see as much ado about Whittle. 
</P>
<P>
Gahr Principal Nadine Barreto, who accepted the firm's invitation to take part 
in the pilot program, acknowledged that she had some initial concerns. 
"Commercials were an issue for me when it first got started," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Whittle promised Barreto and the other participating principals that all 
Channel One commercials would be appropriate for classroom viewing. No ads 
would be accepted for alcoholic beverages, tobacco, contraceptives or feminine 
hygiene products. Principals have the option of screening each program in 
advance and pulling the plug if they find it objectionable. Gahr students have 
seen all the programs to date, including the commercial messages. 
</P>
<P>
Barreto said her misgivings were also allayed by the quality of the programming 
and the fact that Gahr teachers are using the show as an occasion to analyze 
the techniques advertisers use to sway audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, she noted, $50,000 worth of equipment is not easy to come by in an 
era of spartan school budgets. "If we lived in a perfect world, we wouldn't 
have commercials," she said. "And education would be the country's highest 
priority." 
</P>
<P>
Barreto said she believes high school students are smarter, more sophisticated 
consumers than critics of the program give them credit for. Gahr teacher Roger 
Hughes agrees. His students, Hughes said, "are not going to run out and buy 
Juicy Fruit just because they've seen it on TV." 
</P>
<P>
Several Gahr students said they are more likely to be influenced by peer 
pressure than by advertising in deciding what to buy. 
</P>
<P>
Gahr senior Susan De Jesus noted that commercial messages were a fact of life 
for American teen-agers long before Whittle began broadcasting them into the 
schools. "They are making a big deal out of the commercials," the 18-year-old 
said. "They're not such a big deal. We go home and watch commercials." 
</P>
<P>
"These kids are walking commercials," Hughes said, alluding to the brand names 
prominently displayed on their T-shirts, jeans and running shoes. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning the Channel One broadcast featured stories on the national 
ban on fruit from Chile and the growing concern about the safety of apples 
treated with the pesticide Alar. 
</P>
<P>
A segment on air pollution touched on everything from acid rain to a Channel 
One reporter's observation that "every time a cow belches it sends out methane 
gas." 
</P>
<P>
Hughes' students laughed at the notion of bovine pollution, but not as hard as 
they laughed at a deodorant commercial that showed a classroom of students with 
dry underarms waving their hands in the air as a voice urged them to "Raise 
your hand if you're Sure!" 
</P>
<P>
Most of the students said they like the show, citing such pluses as a youthful 
reporting staff, informative maps and other graphics and the reporting of more 
than one side of an issue. Several said they have begun reading newspapers and 
watching television news at home because Channel One piqued their interest in a 
particular topic. "We want more information," one student said. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the national PTA's position, Jeanetta Inge, president of the Gahr 
PTA, said she and her board members are "elated" about the project. She praised 
the content of the programs so far and the ethnic diversity of the on-camera 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Teacher Hughes said the show "is terrific even though we have to put up with 
commercials." But Hughes said the biggest benefit to the school is the 
electronic equipment it received. "I see a tremendous opportunity to use these 
same screens when Whittle isn't on there," he said. Among possible uses: 
televising student activities and beaming otherwise unavailable courses into 
classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chosen for Ethnic Diversity 
</P>
<P>
Channel One is being shown to 10,000 students in California, Kansas, 
Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee. According to Gahr officials, 
Whittle approached the Cerritos school for the five-week pilot program because 
of its ethnic diversity. Forty-nine ethnic groups are represented among Gahr's 
2,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
Whittle spokesman David Jarrard said the firm has spent $5 million on the 
project so far. If the firm deems it a success, Whittle will offer the program 
next year to about 8,000 schools nationwide, which would give Channel One 
advertisers unique access to the country's lucrative teen market. 
</P>
<P>
Jarrard said Channel One will be off the air during the upcoming spring break 
while the company evaluates feedback from the participating schools and other 
sources. The experiment will continue for three more weeks beginning April 1.

ZONING PLAN SPARKS HOMEOWNER FURY IN MONTEREY PARK

MONTEREY PARK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Condominiums surround the two-bedroom, stucco house with brown trim where Tina 
Martin lives. 
</P>
<P>
Hers is one of the last, single-family houses on a street of condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
If she sold the modest house today, along with the small, two-bedroom apartment 
that occupies most of her back yard, she estimates the sale could easily bring 
her more than $200,000, about 10 times the amount she originally paid in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
And if the property were developed as a condominium site, she says that the 
land might be worth close to $1 million. "What we want is top value for our 
property," said the 58-year-old teacher of practical nursing. "I don't think 
that's unreasonable." 
</P>
<P>
But, contrary to the view of a real estate consultant hired by the city, Martin 
fears that implementation of widespread, controversial zoning changes in 
Monterey Park will end any grand dreams of turning the property into a gold 
mine for her retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Now zoned for multifamily housing, Martin's property on Orange Avenue would be 
restricted for use as single-family housing under a proposal being considered 
by city officials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Congested Areas 
</P>
<P>
The possible scaling-down of the zoning is being studied for more than 400 
acres scattered across the city's most congested areas, principally in the 
northeast sector of the 7 1/2-square-mile city. Sixty percent of the city is 
now zoned for single-family housing and another 19% for apartments and 
condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
A temporary ban already exists on construction of apartments and condominiums, 
under rules unanimously enacted last May by the City Council. The council's 
five members continue to reiterate their pledges to correct problems with 
sewers, schools and streets overburdened from rapid growth in the last decade. 
The building moratorium was imposed while city planners and officials study 
whether it would help reduce the zoning on individual residential properties in 
the northeast neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, angry residents such as Martin have come out against down-zoning, 
saying it will create economic havoc for homeowners. Their view is supported by 
two former mayors, Cam Briglio and Howard Fry, whose own residences could be 
zoned single-family. 
</P>
<P>
"I have agonized over the zoning problems, day after day," said Fry, who was 
politically active for 17 years. "But this down-grading . . . will cost me or 
my sons and daughters upwards of $20,000," if his house is sold. 
</P>
<P>
Briglio, addressing the Planning Commission recently, said: "I hope the city 
has got a lot of money, because I'll take (it) to court." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Strike a Balance' 
</P>
<P>
No one, not even Mayor Barry L. Hatch, who initially tried to push for 
revamping the residential zoning for the entire city, seems to believe the 
zoning density will be lowered on all the properties under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to strike a balance," said Councilwoman Judy Chu. 
</P>
<P>
Still, she and other city leaders say there is a mandate to curb growth in the 
city of 63,500 residents. "We know for a fact that traffic is a bear," Hatch 
says. "So are sewers and problems with water. Our schools are packed." 
Eventually, residents will be able to vote on any zoning changes the council 
may decide to enact. A referendum approved in 1987 required that changing the 
zoning on more than one acre necessitates a vote by the community. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lengthy Review 
</P>
<P>
The vote probably will occur in June or July, city officials say, but only 
after the council holds a hearing on the issue either later this month or next. 
The Planning Commission has made a review, including two full days of visits by 
commissioners looking at the properties and three public meetings on the 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
Indicative of the sweeping nature of the land areas involved, three of the 
planning commissioners -- Ken Fong, Joseph Rubin and Verne Heitman -- and two 
council members -- Hatch and Patricia Reichenberger, are disqualified from 
voting on any changes. 
</P>
<P>
The California Fair Political Practices Commission, after an inquiry last year 
by city officials, ruled that these city leaders' residences fell within areas 
under consideration or are in close proximity. 
</P>
<P>
Two planning commissioners and three council members are the only ones who can 
vote in public meetings on any possible changes. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing has been a strange experience," said Planning Commission 
Chairwoman Patricia Chin, who, along with commissioner Stephen Tan, last month 
made the decisions on what to recommend to the council. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Intense Debate 
</P>
<P>
They could agree only on reducing the zoning on 13.3 acres. The two disagreed 
on whether the council should consider scaling-down another 54 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the city officials who can't vote aren't barred from making their views 
heard, and last month's Planning Commission meeting reflected the intensity of 
the debate. 
</P>
<P>
Although disqualified from voting, Fong addressed the meeting from the floor, 
saying, "The quality of life has gone down." 
</P>
<P>
Fong said that because of a job change he is moving to Sacramento. But he said 
that down-zoning will solve problems of congestion. "Families are tired of 
condos," he said. "They want to live in a residential community. That's the 
future trend in Monterey Park: more single-family residences." 
</P>
<P>
But in the meeting that didn't end until 3:30 a.m., most of the more than 30 
speakers spoke against proposals that would have permitted only single-family 
residences on properties where now condominiums and apartments could be built. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Depleted Nest Eggs 
</P>
<P>
Young adults who still live with their parents worried about what would happen 
if they lived in a duplex on property that eventually would be restricted to 
only single-family housing. 
</P>
<P>
Widows and widowers complained that their real estate nest egg might be 
depleted if their properties were zoned single-family instead of 
multiple-family. 
</P>
<P>
People who own triplexes worried over what would happen in the case of a fire. 
If the city rezoned the property to single-family and there was a fire, they 
asked, what would happen if an insurance company were to limit the settlement 
to replace a single-family unit? 
</P>
<P>
And one man complained that permitting only a single-family residence on his 
property would destroy his plans to sell the land as a condominium site and use 
the profits to retire to Montana, where he wants to set up a bee colony. 
</P>
<P>
"I stand to lose over $200,000," said Michael Agnew, who has the bee colony 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
"It's strictly economic," said another resident. "You're taking money out of my 
pocket, and I don't like it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Apartment Limits 
</P>
<P>
Yet Los Angeles real estate consultants from Kotin, Regan &amp; Mouchly Inc. 
said that residential property values wouldn't decline if the zoning were 
changed from multiple-family to single-family. 
</P>
<P>
The main conclusion, still being hotly debated, is that in most cases land 
zoned as single-family "appears to be the highest-valued" use, according to the 
consultants' report. This situation exists, the consultants said, because of 
the limits on the number of units that can now be placed on land zoned for 
apartments or condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
So a house on a 7,000- to 12,000-square-foot lot might be worth about $200,000, 
the consultants said, regardless of whether it is zoned for single-family or 
multiple units. The value of the land alone on lots that size, if the property 
were zoned R-3 (the rating that allows for the highest density of apartment 
units), probably would range between $124,000 to $210,000, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The report generally supports the theory of Hatch and others who say the 
single-family house will be the king of real estate in a residential community 
like Monterey Park, with little undeveloped land so close to downtown Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Hatch and other city leaders have not focused on the issue of affordability for 
first-time home buyers who might be able to buy condominiums rather than a 
house. Nonetheless, he believes the city has no shortage of condominiums. And, 
he said, developers want to build more. "We've got developers and the saliva is 
foaming on the sides of their mouths." 
</P>
<P>
But residents at the Planning Commission hearing said they were worried about 
what would happen to property with, for example, duplexes, triples or 
four-plexes that might be zoned for single-family property. "People are going 
to let that land rot and go downhill," said William Henry Hutchinson of East 
Mabel Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
One issue troubling residents such as Tina Martin centers on what will happen 
if their property is rezoned and the apartments on their property become 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Planning Director M. Margo Wheeler said the city has the right to order 
property owners to demolish any additional units on property zoned as 
single-family. She noted there would be a 20- to 25-year grace period.

LAWSUITS AGAINST NINTENDO GO TO HEART OF THE WAY JAPAN COMPETES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Its business is games, and its primary customers are adolescent boys. But don't 
be fooled. Nintendo is treating its market as seriously as NASA orchestrated 
the first lunar landing. 
</P>
<P>
No detail is too small, no issue too trivial. Nothing is left to chance. 
</P>
<P>
New games, for example, are evaluated on a scale of zero to 40 long before they 
are selected for publication. All games developed by outside authors are 
manufactured, along with the in-house titles, at Nintendo headquarters in 
Japan. Toy store shelves are checked weekly to monitor sales, and new products 
are introduced deliberately and in limited supplies to keep business flowing 
smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
"Nintendo is very paternalistic toward the industry . . . and without that 
protection, the video game business would already have gone through the same 
spike and fall that ruined it in the mid-1980s," said Gregory Fischbach, chief 
executive of Acclaim, a Long Island, N.Y., video game maker. "If Nintendo 
hadn't provided this marketing control, there would be no business today." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Nintendo successfully resuscitated the collapsed market for video games 
in 1985 and patiently nurtured it into a business expected to generate sales of 
more than $3 billion this year. But now the Japanese game maker, which controls 
as much as 80% of the market, has been slapped by disgruntled California 
competitors with two multimillion-dollar antitrust lawsuits that strike at the 
heart of Nintendo's approach to reviving the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled to go to trial later this year, the suits have potentially broad 
implications for personal computer software publishers and other technology 
concerns. Many technology and legal experts also say the suits challenge some 
of the basic business tactics Japanese companies have employed to build -- and, 
in many cases, dominate -- markets in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The suits, filed separately by Atari Games and an unrelated company, Atari 
Corp., over the last three months, accuse Nintendo of monopolistic practices. 
</P>
<P>
Atari Games, which has developed three video games for Nintendo, maintains that 
the Japanese company has competed unfairly in the game market by doing two 
things: insisting on manufacturing every cassette intended for its players and 
unilaterally deciding how many cassettes each of its outside licensees will 
get. Taken together, the suit says, those actions essentially dictate the size 
of the video game market and leave other game and player developers at the 
mercy of Nintendo. 
</P>
<P>
In the other suit, Atari Corp., the video game maker that dominated the market 
in the early 1980s, accused Nintendo of monopolizing both the video game and 
player market by preventing game developers from writing versions of 
Nintendo-authorized games for rival player makers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Into Monopolies' 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say Nintendo's approach to the video game market is tantamount to a 
computer maker preventing software developers from writing versions of a 
computer program for competitors' machines. But some U.S. experts also say the 
company's overall strategy is characteristic of the aggressive yet methodical 
approach often taken by Japanese concerns to build their businesses, though 
perhaps taken to an extreme. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese are into monopolies," said Jeffrey Tarter, publisher of Soft* 
Letter, a software market report. "They really believe you can have orderly 
markets, and they believe the best way to have these orderly markets is to 
minimize competition." 
</P>
<P>
The notion, accepted in Japan, where the economy is tightly monitored by the 
government, flies in the face of the free market system, argues Trip Hawkins, 
founder of Electronic Arts, a San Mateo personal computer game publisher. 
</P>
<P>
Nintendo's response has been that the suits are nothing more than "sour grapes" 
from the companies that let the original video game craze collapse and then 
failed to jump back quickly enough when it rebounded several years later. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd hide under the American flag, too, if I were in their shoes," said William 
White, advertising and marketing director of Nintendo of America, Nintendo 
Co.'s Redmond, Wash., U.S. subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Still, White acknowledges that the Japanese do business differently from their 
American competitors. "American companies don't play hardball like this," he 
said. "There's more of a sharing of the pie by American companies. In Japan, 
it's different: Winners win big and losers lose." 
</P>
<P>
But, as White added, in the United States, the losers also are more than 
willing to take their case to court. 
</P>
<P>
The suit by Atari Games, considered the more far-reaching of the two cases, 
seeks $100 million based on the claim that Nintendo's insistence on 
manufacturing all cassettes intended for its players has restricted Atari 
Games' market. 
</P>
<P>
At the crux of the suit is the "lockout" chip that Nintendo installs in each 
game cassette it manufactures. The special chip allows the games to operate in 
the Nintendo game players and is designed to prevent all but 
Nintendo-authorized and manufactured games from playing on the system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ample Precedent 
</P>
<P>
Nintendo has steadfastly claimed that the security chip is needed to prevent 
inferior, low-quality games from damaging the market, as they did in 1982. 
Further, it argues that by manufacturing all games with these chips, it ensures 
that supply does not exceed demand, creating a glut of the sort that also 
occurred in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
But critics charge that the maneuvers are little more than monopolistic 
practices to prevent a proliferation of copycat games that would cut into 
Nintendo's chokehold on the market. 
</P>
<P>
There is ample predecent for technology firms, such as personal computer 
makers, to protect their patented and copyrighted inventions and materials from 
would-be copiers. But Nintendo is the only company in recent years to try to 
assert control over both the basic machine as well as the material developed by 
outsiders that is played or run on it. 
</P>
<P>
(Record company executives, however, recall that more than three decades ago, 
rival phonograph makers RCA and CBS tried something similar. RCA made players 
with a fat hole and 45 r.p.m. records to match it; CBS' players had tiny holes 
and records made by its in-house manufacturing arm matched that size. 
Phonograph owners who wanted to use both kinds of records were forced to buy 
plastic inserts for records or fat tubes for record spindles as standard 
accessories.) 
</P>
<P>
Nintendo, critics charge, leaves little room for choice by game developers. 
"Nintendo is trying to advance the principle that they must control the 
software that is played on their hardware, and that's patently ridiculous," 
said Kenneth Wasch, executive director of the Software Publishers Assn., a 
trade group supporting the lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a manufacturer of compact disc players saying that they must judge 
the quality of the recording artists. Suddenly we would have one company saying 
that Madonna was OK, but Prince was out. No one does business that way," Wasch 
added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Security Chip Used 
</P>
<P>
If Nintendo's practices are upheld in court, Wasch and others fear that 
personal computer software publishers could be left without much protection 
from huge computer makers. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Reback, a Silicon Valley attorney specializing in patent and copyright 
protection, says Nintendo's use of a security chip to lock out unauthorized 
software could be copied by computer makers, as well, to prevent unauthorized 
software from playing in their machines. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a much more important issue to the personal computer business than the 
game business," Reback said. 
</P>
<P>
Wasch added, "Computer software publishers would fight like hell if any 
hardware manufacturer would even try do do this. I can't imagine a computer 
maker trying this now, but stranger things have happened." 
</P>
<P>
Although the practices may offend some Americans, Yoshihiro Sano, president of 
the US Japan Business News, a weekly Japanese-language newspaper published in 
Los Angeles, says they are quite common in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese are very calculated and planning oriented. That Nintendo wants to 
control the entire manufacturing process for their products is typical for 
Japan," he said. "The approach they have taken to the U.S. market is a very 
Japanese way of doing business. It's just extreme for Americans." 
</P>
<P>
The key to Nintendo's success in the United States stems from its accurate 
assessment of what went wrong with the business in the early 1980s. According 
to Peter Main, marketing vice president for Nintendo of America, the company 
dissected the first craze and concluded that it died out because of shoddy 
games that confused and angered buyers -- not because buyers suddenly lost 
interest in the pastime. 
</P>
<P>
Next, the U.S. subsidiary carefully followed the path blazed nearly three years 
earlier by its Japanese parent, a 99-year-old company that got started making 
cards for the popular Japanese game Hanafuda. Since introducing the Famicom in 
Japan in 1982, Nintendo has sold about 13 million systems there, the equivalent 
of about one for every three households. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, Nintendo has sold about 11 million systems and projects 
sales of another 8 million units this year alone. Sales of Nintendo-authorized 
and manufactured game cassettes are expected to reach 50 million this year, 
about 50% higher than last year's record high. 
</P>
<P>
Although growth has been spectacular, Main contends that the key is ensuring 
the growth rate remains manageable and customers are carefully led through the 
buying cycle already established in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Main says, the company is preparing to introduce a new, more 
sophisticated and more powerful version of its game player, possibly later this 
year. The machine could be brought to market sooner, he acknowledged, but "we 
need to get all we can out of our current product" before introducing its 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
The company takes the same approach with video games themselves. For example, 
one of the hottest games on the Japanese market is Super Mario Brothers III. 
But in the Unites States, the company only recently introduced its immediate 
predecessor, Super Mario Brothers II. 
</P>
<P>
Although the game could easily be exported to the United States, Main says it 
is important to take players through each version in proper order to make sure 
that the players enjoy their experience and stay in the fold. Further, he 
argues, the progression from one version to its successor shouldn't be hurried, 
because the market could become glutted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unique Approach 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, during the last video craze, manufacturers made millions of copies 
of popular titles in an attempt to satisfy the hyper-inflated demand. The 
result was a glut, thousands of inferior products -- and the market's almost 
overnight collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Nintendo's approach to quality control also is novel. Rather than enter into 
multi-year licensing agreements with game developers for a number of products, 
Nintendo signs agreements covering only a single game. If a developer has a 
sequel or new product, it must negotiate a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
"The name of the business is selling games, of course. The second sale is based 
on customers getting satisfaction from the first," said Main. "We're not 
controlling the market, but we are saying that you can't enjoy some games 
without having first played earlier versions. It's understanding that kind of 
progression that makes sense." 
</P>
<P>
To Nintendo allies such as Acclaim's Fischbach, Nintendo's approach is nothing 
other than prudent managing for the long term. "Unless it's grown slowly, the 
market won't last any longer than it did the first time," he said, adding that 
he's happy to accept lower sales now in exchange for a more lasting business.

RISING RATES BRING CABLE FIRMS STATIC FROM PUBLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taking a cue from the protagonist in the anti-television movie "Network," Santa 
Ana resident Joe J. T. Good Sr. wants to appear on the city's Comcast cable 
access channel to declare that he's mad as hell at rising cable fees and he's 
not going to take it anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Good, 73, is upset about Comcast's decision last March to charge subscribers an 
extra $4.45 a month to finance the system's public access channel and other 
services that Santa Ana's previous cable owner -- Group W -- had provided free. 
Good, who says "there is no justification whatsoever for this increase," has 
refused to pay the charge and wants to air his grievances on Comcast's public 
access Channel 26. 
</P>
<P>
"That's his privilege," said James W. Bequette, Western regional manager for 
Comcast. "But our costs have gone up; somebody has to pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hikes as High as 291% 
</P>
<P>
Like Good, consumers across the country are finding that the cost of cable 
services is rising dramatically as the recently deregulated industry takes 
advantage of its freedom to set rates. Since a federal law freed cable 
television operators to raise fees starting in 1987, the national average 
monthly cost of basic cable service has increased 32% to $14.60. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, all of the 14 cable systems regulated by the city's 
Telecommunications Department have raised rates during the period, some by as 
much as 291%. And although at least one cable system -- Choice TV in Pasadena 
-- hasn't raised rates in four years, the vast majority of cable operators have 
imposed substantial increases, much to the consternation of city cable 
television regulators. 
</P>

"We've been getting a record number of complaints from subscribers," said 
Warren S. Carter, cable television administrator for Torrance. "But we tell 
them there is nothing we can do and that they should write their congressman. 
The (law) has really tied our hands. . . . Congress has to do something; the 
cable companies are acting with complete arrogance with the public." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Derick, president of Choice Television and president of the Southern 
California Cable Assn., the industry's local trade group, disputed that claim: 
"There has been an enormous improvement in the quality of programming," Derick 
said, adding that regulation "has been terribly bad for this business and worse 
for the consumer" because officials kept rates so low that systems 
deteriorated. "Now we are getting back to an even playing field," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under a federal law passed in 1984, cable television companies, starting in 
1987, were permitted to charge their subscribers any monthly fee so long as 
there was "effective competition" in the community. The Federal Communications 
Commission has said a cable company has effective competition if at least three 
over-the-air television signals serve the same area. 
</P>
<P>
Some 18 independent and network-affiliated broadcast stations operate in Los 
Angeles and Orange counties, making Southern California one of the nation's 
most competitive cable markets. But unlike the deregulation of some other 
industries -- among them, banks, the airlines and the telephone industry -- the 
over-the-air TV competition appears to have done little to prod cable companies 
into providing better service or moderating prices, experts agree. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Competition Lacking 
</P>
<P>
The latest report on the consumer price index, for example, showed that the 
nationwide cost of cable television rose 10.6% in 1988, a period when the 
overall index rose 4.4% nationally and 4.8% in Los Angeles. By comparison, 
average domestic airline fares per mile for the same 12-month period increased 
6.7%, according to the Air Transport Assn. in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic rationale for deregulation made some sense," said David L. Fishman, 
a senior staff telecommunications consultant with the Arthur D. Little Inc. 
research firm in Cambridge, Mass. "It was thought that the whole video 
revolution would be a third force that would provide a whole lot of competition 
for cable. But I'm not sure that's true now. The video store provides 
competition for the premium (movie channel) services like HBO and Cinemax, but 
they don't provide competition for the news junkie that (watches) CNN or the 
sports junkie that (watches) ESPN." 
</P>
<P>
The concern over the cost of cable television has surfaced just as the industry 
has become a nearly essential part of home entertainment. Not only are slightly 
more than half of the nation's households now subscribers, but cable is 
challenging the commercial networks' video hegemony by producing original 
programming and increasing coverage of local sports and news. 
</P>
<P>
But Cynthia Pols, general counsel for the National League of Cities in 
Washington, contends that programming improvements aren't causing higher 
subscription fees. Rather, she says, it's the steep prices that buyers are 
paying for cable systems, which have sold recently for as much as $2,700 a 
subscriber. That's nearly triple the average price of $946 per subscriber in 
1984, according to Sharon Armbrust, a senior analyst at Paul Kagan Associates, 
a media research firm in Carmel. 
</P>
<P>
The high prices, Pols said, are "loading new buyers with extraordinary debt, 
which they then pass on to consumers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still Relatively Cheap 
</P>
<P>
Industry officials dispute that claim, saying that until 1987 cable fees were 
held artificially low by cable regulation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to keep in mind that, even today, the cable subscriber's 
average (monthly) cable rate is $14.60," said Lynn McReynolds, a spokeswoman 
for the National Cable Television Assn. in Washington. "That's a little less 
than 50 cents a day, and you get 35 channels of programming for that. I spend 
50 cents a day here just to buy a Coke." 
</P>
<P>
Cable subscribers could quench a lot of thirsty throats on the profits being 
rung up by the cable industry. Fees paid by the nation's 47 million cable 
subscribers generated nearly $14 billion in gross revenue last year and $6 
billion in pretax profits before interest and such expenses as depreciation, 
according to Armbrust. The industry's pretax profits last year were more than 
double the $2.5 billion earned when deregulation began in 1984, Armbrust said. 
</P>
<P>
Although some owners have plowed the money back into their operations by laying 
new cable and adding more channels and programming, overall cable service does 
not appear to have improved as fast as cable profits have increased. Complaints 
about picture quality, billing and blackouts are still widely heard, according 
to interviews with local cable regulators, consumers and industry experts. 
</P>
<P>
A Century Cable television subscriber in Pacific Palisades, for example, wrote 
to the Los Angeles Telecommunications Department last year complaining that "we 
were advised of an increase in rates in September, 1988. This is ridiculous. If 
anything, the (Century Cable) company should issue a month's credit to all of 
its Pacific Palisades customers . . . for the total lack of service." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Unimpressed 
</P>
<P>
William J. Rosendahl, vice president for Century Communications Corp., argued 
that it is impossible to provide perfect service since Century cable operates a 
1,700-mile-long cable system with 150,000 subscribers from Marina del Rey to 
Encino. Although Century's $18.59 basic monthly rate is higher than all but one 
of the 14 cable systems regulated by Los Angeles, Rosendahl said his company's 
recent rate hike is "not out of line with other systems" and is helping to 
finance an overhaul of the aging Century system. 
</P>
<P>
Yet some other viewers are unimpressed with the addition of new channels that 
often duplicate existing choices rather than provide innovative programming. 
They feel that cable television is no longer worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
Patrice Johnston, a hospital administrative assistant who lives in Torrance, 
canceled her cable service last year after the company imposed two increases in 
16 months. 
</P>
<P>
"They were telling me that for the service and number of channels they were 
offering you couldn't beat the price, but I felt the increase was a bit 
exorbitant compared to other things I was buying," Johnston, 33, explained. 
"Basically, I felt that cable was something I could live without." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Derick of Choice Television argues that if more cable operators would 
improve service to consumers, complaints about rates would subside. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the cable industry has a lot to do to improve the quality of service . 
. . but you have to put it in context," said Derick. "If I put on 'Rocky' and I 
lose the last minute, people are going to remember that and be mad as hell. But 
if your telephone goes out for a while, you probably don't complain." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Study Launched 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, enough complaints have been raised to prompt Congress to ask its 
investigatory arm, the General Accounting Office, to conduct a comprehensive 
survey of cable television fees to determine the effects of deregulation. The 
GAO expects to report its findings to Congress next fall. 
</P>
<P>
But some legislators are already itching for change. 
</P>
<P>
"As for those rates, much of the blame for this situation rests right here -- 
with the Congress," Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) told a January meeting 
in Washington of the National Assn. of Broadcasters. Metzenbaum, who has 
promised to introduce legislation that will increase competition in the cable 
industry, said by deregulating the cable industry Congress "took the lock off 
the chicken coop, and the FCC practically invited the foxes in."

An admired book of photographs by Walker Evans, one of America's most admired 
photographers, received its fourth edition recently in conjunction with an 
Evans exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. "American Photographs" 
was first published in 1938 when perhaps its greatest impact came less as art 
than as journalism: It was a stark, deeply moving but utterly unsentimental 
presentation of rural poverty during the Great Depression. While the 
documentary importance of "American Photographs" remains, the editions of 1962 
(a MOMA edition, like that of 1938) and 1975 (East River Press) bespoke that 
importance less than they did the steadily growing stature of Evans as a 
photographic artist. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln Kirstein characterized Evans' art as follows: 
</P>
<P>
"The most characteristic single feature of Evans' work is its purity, or even 
its puritanism. It is 'straight' photography not only in technique but in the 
rigorous directness of its way of looking. All through the pictures in this 
book you will search in vain for an angle-shot. Every object is regarded 
head-on (see above and Page 1) with the unsparing frankness of a Russian icon 
or a Flemish portrait. The facts pile up with the prints. 
</P>
<P>
"This is neither a baroque nor a decorative, but a purely protestant attitude: 
meager, stripped, cold, and, on occasion, humorous. It is also the naked, 
difficult, solitary attitude of a member revolting from his own class, who 
knows best what in it must be uncovered, cauterized and why. The view is 
clinical. Evans is a visual doctor, diagnostician rather than specialist. But 
he is also the family physician, quiet and dispassionate, before whom even very 
old or very sick people are no longer ashamed to reveal themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been no need for Evans to dramatize his material with photographic 
tricks, because the material is already, in itself, intensely dramatic. Even 
the inanimate things, bureau drawers, pots, tires, bricks, signs, seem waiting 
in their own patient dignity, posing for their picture. The pictures of men and 
portraits of houses have only that 'expression' which the experience of their 
society and times has imposed on them. The faces, even those tired, vicious or 
content, are past reflecting accidental emotions. They are isolated and 
essentialized. The power of Evans' work lies in the fact that he so details the 
effect of circumstances on familiar specimens that the single face, the single 
house, the single street, strikes with the strength of overwhelming numbers, 
the terrible cumulative force of thousands of faces, houses and streets." 
</P>
<P>
It is worth noting that MOMA made every effort to secure original negatives for 
its anniversary edition and that the negative for the photograph reproduced on 
Page 1 of Book Review comes from the photography collection of the J. Paul 
Getty Museum.

HOW 1 HOSPICE EASES PAIN OF FINAL GOODBYS

The smiling faces of healthy young children help soften the pain of terminally 
ill patients at the Connecticut Hospice, a way station on the journey to death. 
</P>
<P>
A preschool for town kids is separated from the patients' rooms by only a 
picture window and a hallway. 
</P>
<P>
The hospice founders planned it that way. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to say to the world that death is very much a part of life and 
children are very much a part of life," says Rosemary Johnson-Hurzeler, 
president of the Connecticut Hospice, which opened in July, 1980, the first of 
its kind in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
For the terminally ill -- among them a few weeks ago an artist, a woman who 
worked at Woolworth's, a plumber -- the children are among their last remaining 
connections to life. 
</P>
<P>
And so now, this gathering of the old generation -- the artist, the 
five-and-dime clerk, the plumber -- watch the new generation make faces in the 
window and play on the patio. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen girls and boys, 3- and 4-year-olds, attend the preschool, some of them 
children of staff members. 
</P>
<P>
to make ends meet -- 95% of them are nonprofit, Bates said. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia O'Neil, a liaison nurse at the Merrimack Valley Hospice in Andover, 
Mass., said that 90% of patients in that program die at home. "I think that's 
really important, because in order for that to happen, you need a lot of 
support and intensive visits." 
</P>
<P>
Hospice patients range from the very young to the very old. At Merrimack Valley 
Hospice, many patients are in the program only a few days. It is a step people 
are naturally reluctant to take, since it means "a real acknowledgment that 
you're finished with looking for a cure," O'Neil said. 
</P>
<P>
"We can be very low key," she said, "but there has to be some understanding, at 
least from someone in the family, that the prognosis is limited." 
</P>
<P>
Patients, she said, may not be afraid of death, but of the process of dying, 
and a hospice program can comfort them about that.

Fresno United Way Executive Director Tony Folcarelli will take over the top 
staff job of the statewide volunteer organization, it has been disclosed. As 
United Way of California executive director, the 54-year-old Folcarelli will 
assist the state's 41 United Ways in management, training and other phases of 
charity fund-raising. Folcarelli, who was associate regional manager of United 
Way in the West Los Angeles area from 1971 to 1974, was credited with 
revitalizing the Fresno operation by insisting that traditional agencies 
document the effectiveness of their programs. This opened the door to some 
community groups previously denied allocations. Folcarelli will assume the post 
May 1.

Two teams of Soviet officials concluded their short-notice or "quota" 
inspections of two U.S. missile facilities, bringing the number of such Soviet 
tours of facilities cited in the INF Treaty to nine. On-Site Inspection Agency 
Cmdr. Kendell Pease said one team toured the Martin Marietta facility in Middle 
River, Md., and a second was dispatched to Ft. Sill at Lawton, Okla. Both teams 
were accompanied by U.S. escorts. The inspection program was one of the terms 
of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty signed in December, 1987, by 
the Soviet Union and the United States. In the first three years of the treaty, 
inspectors are allowed 20 quota visits a year.

Progress for women academics is slow, even at the prestigious UC Berkeley, 
according to the first study of its kind at the school. The report of the 
Coordinating Committee on the Status of Women, launched in 1987 by a 15-member 
committee, said women still face significant barriers to advancement and equal 
opportunities at the school. Progress in faculty hiring and promotion has been 
"almost non-existent" for minority women while the record has been uneven for 
white women, the report said. The report cited lack of progress in hiring and 
promoting women, particularly minority women, on the faculty and among 
non-tenure track academics and staff, and in recruiting and retaining women 
students in general.

Christian-led army troops and pro-Syrian Muslim militia members battled with 
tanks and artillery on the fifth consecutive day of sectarian fighting in 
Lebanon, security sources said. At least 50 people have been killed and 155 
wounded. The latest flare-up came a day after a car bomb exploded in front of a 
crowded East Beirut bakery near the British Consulate, killing 15 people. Each 
side blamed the other for the renewed violence, which followed four days of 
fighting along the line that divides the capital city of Beirut and its suburbs 
into Muslim and Christian sectors.

Spring break rituals in Palm Springs began under sunny skies and 80-degree 
desert temperatures, but the first influx of party-seeking students seemed to 
be aware of the watchful eye of the police, officers said. Police made 54 
arrests between Friday night and early Saturday, mostly for public drunkenness 
and disturbing the peace, and issued 411 citations, Lt. Lee Weigel said. Last 
year after the first day of spring break, police had arrested 60 young people. 
About 50,000 to 100,000 visitors, mostly high school and college students, are 
expected to converge on the city by the end of the week. As usual, nearly every 
hotel and motel room was booked.

The Soviet Union shut down Armenia's only nuclear power plant because of an 
outcry over its safety sparked by last December's earthquake, the official Tass 
news agency said. The 13-year-old plant, 24 miles from the Armenian capital of 
Yerevan, is the first operating nuclear station to be decommissioned in the 
Soviet Union. The plant, built in the heart of a major earthquake zone, had 
been expected to operate 30 years. It was designed to withstand earthquakes 
measuring up to a magnitude of 9.0. The government has insisted the plant 
suffered no serious damage in the Dec. 7 temblor that registered a magnitude of 
6.9. The quake leveled several towns in Armenia and left 25,000 people dead.

NEWSMAKERS: PRINCIPAL JOE CLARK A DROPOUT?

 -- Joe Clark, the bat-carrying principal portrayed in the film "Lean on Me," 
said through personal manager Vincent Fusco that he will take a leave of 
absence when the school year ends and has had discussions with drug control 
director William J. Bennett about a possible post in President Bush's 
Administration. " . . . I doubt I'll ever come back. My soul is tired and 
fatigued from fighting an educational system that is rotten to the core," he 
said. Clark, whose tough tactics as principal of Eastside High School in 
Paterson, N.J., have brought praise and criticism, said he will take the leave 
even if the government job does not pan out. He told the New York Daily News: 
"My blood pressure is up and my doctor says I'm headed for an early grave if I 
don't slow down." City officials have been trying to get the controversial 
principal fired. Clark, 50, just finished a five-day suspension ordered by 
Supt. Frank Napier after a school assembly last month that featured a female 
dancer who stripped three male partners down to G-strings. Clark said he did 
not know about the performers' plans and was out of town during the assembly.

Verses," which Muslims view as blasphemous. Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini has called for the death of the book's British author, Salman Rushdie, 
and Iran has called the prince's visit to the Persian Gulf an insult to Islam. 
A British diplomat said no specific threat against the prince had been 
received. But Dubai has a large community of Iranians, and British officials 
said the request that Charles skip the match originated in the office of Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher. The Prince, who has been traveling with his wife, 
went on to Saudi Arabia, but Princess Diana flew home to attend a wedding.

 -- Donna Rice rose to notoriety after her romantic liaison with former 
Colorado Sen. Gary Hart was disclosed during his bid for the 1988 Democratic 
presidential nomination. But nowadays, notoriety is the last thing on her mind. 
She says she's had to wear false buck teeth and sunglasses to avoid being 
recognized in public. Rice, a model, said in a speech at the 15th annual 
Institute on the Ethics of Journalism at Washington &amp; Lee University in 
Lexington, Va., that she had "lost everything I had worked for all of my life" 
-- her reputation and credibility as well as her livelihood. "Imagine the kind 
of person you most dislike and think of people thinking of you as that kind of 
person," she said. DAVE JOHNSON

An offer by IBM Corp. to pump millions of gallons of water with low levels of 
industrial solvents to Santa Clara Valley households has been met with 
skepticism by environmentalists and water district officials. IBM says the 
treated water from its South San Jose property, now being dumped, contains low 
levels of chemical solvents but is well within the state limits for drinking 
water supplies. Under the proposal, IBM would pump from 600 to 1,300 acre feet 
a year into the Snell Pipeline, which carries water for the Santa Clara Valley 
Water District. "I am not comfortable with the citizens of Santa Clara County 
drinking that water," said Joe Judge, chairman of the Santa Clara Valley Water 
District. But Steve Morse of the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality 
Control Board said, "As far as we can see, there's little or no health risks."

NEW ITALY PROBE OF CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Italian air force has been ordered to investigate the 1980 crash of a 
domestic airliner after new reports that it was downed by a missile, the 
Defense Ministry said. The announcement appeared to be a victory for relatives 
of the 81 victims aboard the DC-9 who have long alleged that the military 
conspired to hide evidence about the crash. A 1982 probe concluded that an 
explosion caused the plane to crash into the sea near Sicily but did not 
establish the reason for the blast. Now, an investigative team says evidence 
indicates the airliner was brought down by a missile of undetermined origin. 
Two television documentaries recently charged that the plane was shot down in 
error by an Atlantic Alliance fighter.

New security orders have been issued to all of Britain's major airports, a 
Manchester airport spokesman said. The orders came amid controversy over 
warnings received before the December bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. According 
to British media, the new directive requires passengers to remove all electric 
and electronic equipment from luggage before check-in and to pack such items in 
hand luggage for inspection at boarding gates. Investigators have said the bomb 
that blew up Flight 103 on Dec. 21 over Lockerbie, Scotland -- killing all 259 
people aboard and 11 on the ground -- had been concealed in a radio-cassette 
player.

CHENEY QUICKLY SWORN IN TO DEFENSE POST; 
</P>
<P>
IN WAKE OF TOWER EPISODE, HE TAKES OATH AFTER 92-0 SENATE VOTE

<P>
Dick Cheney was swiftly sworn in as defense secretary Friday after sailing 
without dissent through the Senate that only a week earlier had climaxed a 
brutal battle by rejecting President Bush's first choice for the job. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, winning Senate confirmation by 92 to 0 and resigning as Wyoming's lone 
representative in the House, became the nation's 17th Pentagon chief, taking 
the oath of office at an informal ceremony that completed the formation of 
Bush's Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
Former Sen. John Tower of Texas, Bush's first nominee for secretary of defense, 
was rejected by the Senate, 53 to 47, on March 9. 
</P>
<P>
"I am proud to have the opportunity to serve the President of the United States 
and the nation as secretary of defense," Cheney said as he was sworn in to 
office. 
</P>
<P>
"But at the same time, I will miss the House. And more than anything, I regret 
that I must step down after representing the state of Wyoming for 10 years," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
The action on Cheney capped a nearly two-month Senate struggle over filling the 
Pentagon job. The rancor surrounding the Tower nomination was largely absent as 
the Senate moved quickly last week on Cheney, although some bitterness 
remained. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) complained that the Senate had "rushed to judgment" 
on Cheney after the dispute over Tower and with a two-week recess looming. 
</P>
<P>
"There's hardly been a chance for people to find out about Congressman Cheney's 
nomination in the press, media, to sit down and write a letter and have it 
delivered," Specter said. "I think we're correct, and I'm prepared to vote for 
Congressman Cheney, but I do think this timetable ought not set a precedent." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John Warner of Virginia, top Republican on the Senate Armed Services 
Committee, denied that Cheney was put on a fast track, noting that because 
Cheney was a congressman, his financial records were already on file. In 
addition, Warner said, the FBI expedited its background check. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) the committee chairman, later responded more pointedly, 
saying: "I gather what he (Specter) wanted us to do was to wait for the rumor 
and innuendo to come in." 
</P>
<P>
Nunn led the fight to kill the Tower nomination and came under harsh criticism 
for his handling of the proceedings. The Georgia Democrat used his time on the 
Senate floor to defend the committee's process. 
</P>
<P>
Word of praise for a friend and colleague were then left to Wyoming's two 
Republican senators. 
</P>
<P>
"I trust Dick Cheney, I trust how he behaves in life, I trust his intelligence, 
I trust his integrity, I trust his friendship," said Sen. Malcolm Wallop of 
Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
And Wyoming Sen. Alan Simpson said he and Wallop felt a mixture of pride and 
sadness because their state's congressional delegation was losing a man of 
"distinction and honor and rare political savvy." 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to miss our friend," Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
Alluding to the furor involving allegations of excessive drinking by Tower, 
both Wallop and Simpson said they at times had a beer with Cheney. 
</P>
<P>
"I even had a suds or two with him," Simpson told his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.) said Cheney was a "man of great moderation with 
the suds." 
</P>
<P>
Senators had cited allegations of drinking and womanizing against Tower as well 
as conflict of interest concerns from his past ties to defense contractors. 
</P>
<P>
The Tower turmoil has not been easily forgotten. On Thursday, Sen. Ernest 
Hollings (D-S.C.) released an unclassified FBI report that said an 
investigation of Tower had turned up "a prior pattern of alcohol abuse." 
</P>
<P>
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), without mentioning names, used his 
time on the Senate floor Friday to criticize Hollings for releasing the report. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of my colleagues aren't content even with the John Tower defeat," Dole 
said. "They're still out trying to assassinate the character of an honorable 
man." 
</P>
<P>
Hollings, however, said the FBI finding of a pattern of alcohol abuse should 
lay to rest claims that Tower was simply a victim of rumor. The FBI memorandum 
directly addressed the rumor issue, saying the bureau reported its findings 
only after an investigation marked by "complete thoroughness." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney was sworn into office by David Cooke, director of administration and 
management in the office of the defense secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Present were Cheney's wife, Lynne, their two daughters, Elizabeth and Mary, and 
the new Pentagon chief's parents, Richard and Marge. A formal oath-taking 
ceremony is scheduled for Tuesday at the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
A special election will be held in Wyoming to fill the House seat vacated by 
Cheney.

BURMA IS SLOWLY REOPENING ITS DOOR TO FOREIGN TOURISTS AFTER PROTESTS

PAGAN, Burma 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The souvenir shop owner took the bank note in his hands, held it up to the 
light and then kissed the grimy paper three times. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first money I've earned since August," he explained. "It's like 
I've opened up a new shop." 
</P>
<P>
Just down the main road of Pagan, another shopkeeper excitedly dusted off 
lacquerware boxes, teak elephants, tin gongs and gems of questionable quality. 
</P>
<P>
"You are a good omen -- first tourist for six months," he whispered. "We have 
been selling our gold to buy food. Now business will be back soon. Buy 
something, please." 
</P>
<P>
Pagan, Burma's royal capital between 1057 and 1287 but now a dusty town 
surrounded by hundreds of crumbling Buddhist temples and pagodas, still feels 
the effect of anti-government protests that brought the country to a halt last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
Almost totally dependent on tourism, it suffered a body blow when Rangoon 
decided in early August to stop all visits because of violent clashes between 
troops and marchers. Diplomats said 1,000 people were killed in the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nobody Came to Buy 
</P>
<P>
Although there was no unrest in Pagan, hotels and guest houses emptied in this 
sleepy town on the Irrawaddy River in central Burma. Nobody came to buy the 
town's distinctive black lacquer ware or enjoy its fish curries and 
mustard-leaf soup. 
</P>
<P>
The ban on foreign visits idled tour guides and drivers who were accustomed to 
shuttling sightseers around the brick and stone ruins scattered over 16 square 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Pagan's 5,000 residents became so desperate they dug holes in the 
fields and panned under the hot sun for specks of gold left over from its 
glittering heyday. 
</P>
<P>
A good day's panning among the temples, cactus trees and thorn bushes could 
yield up to a dollar's worth of gold flecks washed off gilded Stupa shrines or 
left from gold-threaded cloth the Burmese royalty used to wear, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
Craft sellers could normally make up to $300 a month from the tourist trade, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tight Restrictions 
</P>
<P>
The army, which crushed the democracy movement last September, began 
readmitting foreign tourists in mid-December but the tight restrictions it 
imposed hardly made the visit a leisurely holiday. 
</P>
<P>
A trail-blazing group of West German tourists were free to explore deserted 
temples and pagodas which, in English writer Somerset Maugham's words, "loom 
huge, remote and mysterious, like the vague recollections of a fantastic 
dream." 
</P>
<P>
But they were followed by plainclothes police and barred from leaving their bus 
to shop. They were the ones who seemed remote and mysterious to the few people 
who saw them. 
</P>
<P>
"They looked like prisoners," one resident commented. 
</P>
<P>
Glancing repeatedly over his shoulder, a visitor to an annual temple fair said 
officials drove through the bamboo hut town before the tourists' arrival with 
loudspeakers telling residents not to talk to the rare visitors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Visit by Correspondents 
</P>
<P>
A group of 46 foreign correspondents brought from Bangkok on an unprecedented 
official tour in mid-January also passed through the town almost unnoticed 
except at the river side Thiripyitsaya Hotel where they stayed. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't hear anything about them," said one shop owner, who seemed 
disappointed over the lost opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Controls eased a bit by late January, when some West German and American 
tourists were allowed to roam the dusty main road and the narrow lanes of the 
market set up for an annual fair at the white-washed Ananda Temple in the 
center of Pagan. 
</P>
<P>
But at least a dozen soldiers, barefoot out of respect for Buddhist tradition, 
patrolled the temple grounds as more than 200 monks and novices lined up for 
bowls of rice, bananas and other food donated by the faithful. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, among the stalls selling used spectacles, repaired umbrellas and oil 
cans cut out of beer tins, young boys struggled to practice their shaky English 
with phrases like "Hello. What is your name? We want democracy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Underdeveloped Industry 
</P>
<P>
Although more acute, Pagan's problems mirror the difficulties of the 
underdeveloped tourist industry in all of Burma since August. 
</P>
<P>
During January, usually the height of the season because of its mild weather, 
only 200 visitors came to Burma this year instead of 4,675 in 1988, tourist 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Tourist Burma, which used to fill two Fokker F-27 planes with tourists on the 
Rangoon-Pagan-Mandalay-Heho-Rangoon circuit every day, now has only three 
flights a week on that run. 
</P>
<P>
To add to its problems, Burma Airways' safety record is so poor that several 
Western embassies urge their nationals not to take its flights. A Fokker F-27 
crash in Rangoon on Feb. 3, the fourth in 18 months, killed 26 passengers, all 
Burmese. 
</P>
<P>
As a result the cash-strapped government, which lost all foreign aid after its 
bloody suppression of the democracy movement, has forfeited most of the $4 
million it would normally have earned during the winter season. 
</P>
<P>
Foreigners watching a golden sunset across the Irrawaddy atop the steep 
Thatbyinnyu Temple -- Pagan's highest vantage point -- may enjoy the lack of 
other tourists, but shopkeepers eagerly await the return of packed tour buses. 
</P>
<P>
Told more tourists should be coming now that the standard seven-day visas were 
available again, their common refrain was: "When? How many? Where are they 
now?"

GUATEMALAN PRIEST BATTLING FOR LAND REFORM

TIQUISATE, Guatemala 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His role models are the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Bishop Oscar Arnulfo 
Romero of El Salvador, two assassinated civil rights activists. 
</P>
<P>
He nearly followed them full circle in September when attackers opened fire on 
his car, killing his bodyguard-driver and wounding his adopted son. 
</P>
<P>
Father Andres Giron, a 42-year-old Roman Catholic priest, hasn't stopped what 
he has been doing -- pressing for land reform and seeking permission from the 
Vatican to run for president of this Central American country. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't mean that he is fearless. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid," he said. "Sometimes I think it's better to be a live burro than a 
dead thoroughbred." 
</P>
<P>
Giron, a U.S.-educated cleric who taught in the slums of Memphis, Tenn., in the 
1960s and marched with King in the city's garbage workers' strike, continues to 
pursue land reform even though it can be mortally dangerous to do so. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slaughter Quelled 
</P>
<P>
His father and four other relatives were among the estimated 100,000 people 
killed in political violence during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Local and 
international human rights groups blame government security forces for the vast 
majority of the killings. The slaughter of suspected leftists quelled a 
stubborn, decades-old insurgency, though pockets of guerrilla activity remain. 
</P>
<P>
Giron spent 1981-83 in the United States because of threats on his life here. 
</P>
<P>
"In Guatemala, land is the source of power. No land, no power," he said in an 
interview beneath an almond tree next to his church in Tiquisate, 55 miles 
southwest of Guatemala City. 
</P>
<P>
Two bodyguards, one with a submachine gun and the other cradling a shotgun, 
leaned against the priest's car nearby. Giron had just said Mass for about 200 
parishioners, among them eight adolescent girls dressed in white lace and 
finery for their First Communion. 
</P>
<P>
He told them in the homily that his Christian duty, and theirs, included 
"denouncing the terrible things going on in this country; that officials are 
stealing, that the army is killing people." 
</P>
<P>
He exhorted them to act as yeast in the figurative bread of society, to 
contribute to a rising up. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Focusing on Election 
</P>
<P>
Giron has enlivened a political scene already focused on 1990 presidential 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
He said he intends to use the National Campesino Assn. he formed in 1986 as the 
base for a political party. The party will challenge the centrist Christian 
Democrats and rightists who have dominated partisan politics since the return 
to civilian government in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The peasant organization represents 120,000 people, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ultraconservatives, who with the armed forces ran the country throughout its 
modern history, consider Giron a subversive. Some have called for his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"This country needs a spark to ignite a revolution, and I want to be part of 
that revolution," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The priest calculates that 71% of Guatemala's arable land is owned by 1% of its 
population. Others dispute that figure. But there is agreement that land 
distribution is among the most skewed in the hemisphere, favoring a small group 
at the expense of Indian peasants, who make up nearly 60% of the population. 
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID), enough 
uncultivated land is available on big estates to provide five-acre plots to 
each of the estimated 500,000 heads of peasant households with no land at all. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dangerous Challenge 
</P>
<P>
Challenging the gentry's hold on land has always been dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
President Jacobo Arbenz began the country's first and only land reform in the 
early 1950s and his initiative galvanized rightist opposition. Military 
officers supported by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency overthrew Arbenz in 
1954 and returned all expropriated holdings to their previous owners, among 
them the U.S.-based United Fruit Co. 
</P>
<P>
AID subsequently described Arbenz's reform plan as "moderate and progressive" 
</P>
<P>
Giron does not have a detailed plan yet for redistributing land. But he 
describes his philosophy as radical. He envisions a Guatemala with no landless 
peasants, a place where country people have enough land to grow the food they 
need. 
</P>
<P>
"It can't be done in one year, or even two, because people have to be educated. 
But I would make a real revolution here, and they (the landholders) know it," 
said Giron. 
</P>
<P>
Giron, who supported the successful presidential candidacy of Vinicio Cerezo 
Arevalo in the 1985 election, said he has letters from the president in which 
the Christian Democrat committed himself to land reform. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Public Commitment 
</P>
<P>
Cerezo has made no such commitment publicly, but he has supported programs to 
aid small farmers. He also has used government funds to buy about 11,000 acres 
of land to divide among about 3,000 peasant families. 
</P>
<P>
"All that has been done has been done very timidly," said Giron, who with some 
followers invaded and occupied fallow farmland in 1986. The government bought 
the parcel and sold it to the peasants at subsidized prices. 
</P>
<P>
Giron's campesino association runs three cooperative farms on such land bought 
cheaply from the government. 
</P>
<P>
He said Cerezo probably would have pursued small-scale redistribution had it 
not been for a coup attempt last May. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More, More Dependent 
</P>
<P>
The military high command backed Cerezo's government and put the rebellion 
down. But the civilian administration, which had been barely able to assert 
authority against the military in the best of times, became even more 
conditioned by and dependent upon military tutelage. 
</P>
<P>
"May was it for Vinicio," said Giron. 
</P>
<P>
Rightists contend that breaking up large holdings would hurt production of hard 
currency-earning mainstays of the economy -- coffee, sugar, bananas and cotton. 
</P>
<P>
"Even in good export years, people are dying of hunger," Giron said. "I'm not 
in favor of destroying the productive apparatus. I'm smart enough to know we 
can't live without dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"But I can't go along with a system under which a small group of the privileged 
live like kings while most people live like beggars."

ON THE A-1 MOTORWAY, Netherlands 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's 8:30 a.m., and traffic is bumper to bumper on this eight-lane 
Amsterdam-area highway. A few yards away, commuter trains pass every 10 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The government wants to unclog the roads to improve the economy. But 
environmentalists worry about the ecosystem, and motorists worry about their 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the 20-year plan to upgrade mass transit and build more highways is 
a plan to plant electronic sensors that would track motorists at rush hour and 
periodically bill them for their use of the highways. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic jams cost the Dutch economy an estimated $350 million a year in the 
68-mile urban crescent that stretches from Rotterdam to Amsterdam to Utrecht in 
the central Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
The $15.5 billion transport plan, which must be approved by Parliament, 
reflects government concern that a faltering transportation system could 
irreversibly damage the Netherlands' position as Europe's major port of entry 
via Rotterdam. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lost Time, Production Delays 
</P>
<P>
Transport Minister Neelie Smit-Kroes says a 30% growth in highway traffic in 
the last five years has cost about $1.75 billion in lost working time and 
production delays. 
</P>
<P>
The government forecasts that its car-curbing measures would lead to a slower 
growth of traffic -- 55% more in 2010 instead of 70%. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists welcome mass transit improvements. But they contend that they 
will be neutralized by a highway expansion that could harm the already fragile 
ecosystem of this tiny nation of 14.6 million living in an area the size of 
Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island combined. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been shown time and again that improved roads attract more traffic, which 
in turn necessitates more roads -- it's a vicious circle," says Willem-Jan van 
Grondelle of the Dutch Nature and Environment Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
"To counter the colossal environmental problems ahead," he says, "the use of 
private cars must be drastically cut." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Influential Environmental Group 
</P>
<P>
Van Grondelle's privately-financed organization is the nation's most 
influential environmental research group. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, a spokesman for the Dutch motorists' lobby, Henk Langeweg, 
says his group, with 2 million members, opposes the plan because it "limits our 
constituency in what it prizes most -- its liberty." 
</P>
<P>
This is a car-oriented culture, with its 5 million private automobiles that 
provide freedom of movement in this crowded nation. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Transport Minister Smit-Kroes says that in the 
Rotterdam-Amsterdam area -- an urban conglomerate of 3.5 million people -- five 
new highway tunnels would be dug under major waterways. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, about 620 miles of existing highways would be widened to increase 
their capacity about 40% and the electronic sensors would be installed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Road Pricing' System 
</P>
<P>
The system known as "road pricing" is still in development. But it has already 
stirred considerable controversy because of it would be a means of registering 
the movements of a citizenry traditionally sensitive to any potential 
infringement of its liberties. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the huge scope of the government's gridlock remedy, both the automobile 
lobbyists and the environmentalists see little chance of ending the Dutch 
driver's love for the open road. 
</P>
<P>
"Huge traffic jams will be part of life here for quite a while," says Langeweg. 
"Especially since most of the Dutch will only leave their car home on pain of 
death."

PLANTATION COUNTY SOON TO GET FIRST TASTE OF 'INSTANT SUBURBIA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
CHARLES CITY COUNTY, Va. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is a county named for a city that does not exist. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, this county along the James River also has no town, no bank, no video 
store or movie theater, no pharmacy, no liquor store, no newspaper, no shopping 
center, no fast food restaurant, no 7-Eleven, no library, no jail, no motel, no 
red light and no Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Nor has there been a homicide here since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
In this county only 30 miles from Richmond but seemingly lost in time, there 
are also no apartments, townhouses or suburban subdivisions. 
</P>
<P>
What Charles City County, organized in 1634 and named for Charles I of England, 
does have in its 201 mostly forested square miles are 7,000 people, 80% of them 
nonwhite, and a row of riverfront plantations inhabited largely by descendants 
of the early white planters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Subdivision on Way 
</P>
<P>
And, if things go as planned, the county's first full-scale subdivision will 
soon sprout along historic Route 5, the scenic John Tyler Memorial Highway that 
courses down the peninsula toward Williamsburg and Jamestown. 
</P>
<P>
Now, 58 houses on lots averaging 1 1/2 acres may not sound like much to most 
city dwellers, but to many of the riverfront people here -- a Who's Who of 
Southern aristocracy -- it's the worst thing to happen since the Union Army 
invaded in 1862. 
</P>
<P>
"What scares us is growing . . . out of control," said Lisa Ruffin Harrison, 
mistress of her family's Evelynton Plantation, whose Confederate ancestor, 
Edmund Ruffin, fired the first shot at Ft. Sumter. 
</P>
<P>
The Burkeshire subdivision, she said, "looks very urban in nature on a rural 
road," despite the developer's promise to hide the houses behind a buffer of 
trees. "Your view west will be nothing but a sea of houses," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison and others say they're all for more housing in the county -- 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees Nothing Good 
</P>
<P>
"Instant suburbia" is how Frederick S. Fisher, owner of Westover Plantation, 
described the subdivision. Other property owners call it a "high-density 
subdivision" that "offers nothing good for the county." 
</P>
<P>
But if the landed gentry feels vulnerable to a pincer movement from the 
expanding areas of Williamsburg to the east and Richmond to the west, most of 
the residents here either are apathetic about the new houses or want more. 
</P>
<P>
"Our kids graduate high school, they go straight to Richmond or Williamsburg 
for an apartment because nobody will sell them any land," said Darlene Smith, a 
dispatcher in the sheriff's office. 
</P>
<P>
Houses and land are passed down through the generations, and many younger 
people go elsewhere not only to live but also to work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Commute 
</P>
<P>
About 80% of the work force commutes to jobs outside the county. 
</P>
<P>
"Charles City County would make 'The Color Purple' look pink," or mild by 
comparison, said Barbara Lewis, who left Charles City to attend Norfolk State 
College in 1967 and now lives in Alexandria, Va. "There was absolutely zero 
opportunity as far as jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Even today, the county's largest employer is the school system, with 184 on its 
payroll. The largest private company, which makes cabinets, employs 100; the 
county government, 79. The plantations employ an estimated 50 people full time 
as guides, groundskeepers and gift shop workers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a whole different world here," said David L. Kleppinger, director of the 
county's Department of Economic Development and a native of New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
"You can go back almost 300 years, there's not been too much change 
physically," said Richard Bowman, the first black person to head the county 
Board of Supervisors and a man who has traced his roots here to 1786. The 
subdivision, he noted with some detachment, "has caused some concern among the 
landed gentry who've so long occupied that sacred area." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Home of Two Presidents 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally agrarian, Charles City County dates its first plantation, 
Shirley, back to 1613. The first Thanksgiving was celebrated in 1619 at 
Berkeley Plantation. The county boasts two presidents, William Henry Harrison 
and John Tyler, one signer of the Declaration of Independence and three 
governors. 
</P>
<P>
After the Civil War, blacks held some elected positions in the county until a 
state convention in 1901 imposed a poll tax, effectively disenfranchising 
nonwhites. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the first black supervisor was elected, in 1947, but it wasn't 
until 1972 that blacks gained a majority on the three-member county board. With 
Bowman's retirement in 1987, the board reverted to a white majority. 
</P>
<P>
School integration also came late to the county, with the consolidation in 1969 
of separate white, black and Indian schools. With the white gentry and a few 
middle-class blacks sending their children to private schools outside the 
county, public school enrollment has been declining in recent years, to a 
current low of 1,125, and the school buildings have deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Revenue From Landfill 
</P>
<P>
To build new schools, county officials cut a deal recently with a Pittsburgh 
company to operate a regional landfill in Charles City in return for revenue of 
$2.5 million a year. In November, residents voted by a 6-to-1 ratio to float a 
$10-million school bond issue, to be repaid with landfill revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Good schools, officials say, are the key to attracting the kind of industry and 
jobs that will make residents of new subdivisions such as Burkeshire more than 
commuters and Charles City more than a bedroom community. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the long list of things their county lacks, residents are choosy about 
change. They overwhelmingly opposed a new state prison here. They also objected 
to a federally subsidized 40-unit apartment building proposed for a site near 
the courthouse, in use since 1730. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, they voted in liquor by the drink, a change sought by two 
young men, one a Ruffin, for their new Indian Fields Tavern, one of only two 
restaurants in the county. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Finance Repairs 
</P>
<P>
Four bed-and-breakfast establishments, including two in plantation houses, are 
other recent indicators of a county slowly yielding to change. In at least one 
case, it was also a way for George and Ridgely Copland, owners of North Bend, 
to finance repairs on the ancestral home. 
</P>
<P>
"We're right rural, but that's gonna change," said George Copland, a farmer who 
is the great-great-grandson of Edmund Ruffin and the great-great-grandnephew of 
William Henry Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
"Gosh, I'd like to have a bank in the county; that would make my life more 
convenient," said Lisa Harrison, Copland's cousin. "Also a dry cleaners and a 
Laundromat. I recognize there is (also) a desperate need for adequate housing 
in the county. But these (Burkeshire homes) are too expensive (for most 
residents) and will just bring in people who need a lot of services the county 
can't provide." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Developer Defends Project 
</P>
<P>
Richmond developer Mitchell Kambis said his Colonial-style houses, priced from 
about $80,000 to $150,000, are aimed at local residents ready to move up, 
newcomers who may commute and workers ready to retire. He notes that current 
zoning allows higher density development than he proposes, and that Burkeshire, 
with a single entrance on Route 5, will maintain the scenic and historic 
character of the area. 
</P>
<P>
The landowners don't agree. 
</P>
<P>
"Read my lips: I have strong reservations," said Helle Carter, whose husband, 
Hill, is the senior county supervisor and a member of the Planning Commission. 
Hill Carter, the ninth generation of his family to live at Shirley Plantation, 
opposed Burkeshire when it came before the Planning Commission but said he may 
support it when it comes before the supervisors in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Favors Moratorium 
</P>
<P>
Carter also said he is inclined to support a moratorium on subdivisions while 
an overdue county comprehensive plan is completed. But Burkeshire, with some 
modifications, may be built in any case, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have young folks in the county who need inexpensive housing. We want to 
take care of them, but we can be choosy and not just please developers," he 
said. "The county can't stay the way it is. It's got to progress, but. . . . "

LACK OF CLEAN WATER, SEWERS BREED DISEASE IN BORDER SETTLEMENTS 
</P>

EL PASO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eleazar and Maria Morales say they detest hauling water, a daily chore in the 
rural West Texas slum where they live without indoor plumbing or proper sewage 
disposal. 
</P>
<P>
Their home is in Sparks Addition, a hodgepodge of substandard housing in the 
desert near here. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood is a colonia, the Spanish term for subdivision that has become 
synonymous with the predominantly Latino rural slums that have grown up along 
the U.S.-Mexico border over the last 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
In El Paso County, about 28,000 people live without running water, and 53,000 
have no sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
Along the U.S. side of the Rio Grande, a further 150,000 people live in 
colonias where septic tanks overflow every time it rains and the contaminated 
mud breeds illnesses that are rare elsewhere in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
There are colonias all along the border, from San Diego to Brownsville, Tex., 
but social workers say the problem is worst in Texas, where counties have no 
zoning powers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refugees From Cities 
</P>
<P>
Many colonia dwellers are refugees from city slums and housing projects, and 
most are American citizens or legal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
"I was desperate for a place to live," Morales said. "Rents in El Paso 
tenements were too high, and the living conditions in the city are not good for 
raising children." 
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old unemployed construction worker said he had always dreamed of 
owning a home. He said he bought his small piece of desert land from a 
developer who promised that water and sewers would soon be available. 
</P>
<P>
Morales and his wife, Maria, 45, built their house, a cinder-block building 
with three bedrooms, living room, kitchen and two baths -- and a huge septic 
tank out back. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't gotten sick from the water yet," Morales said, and quickly added: 
"Thank God." 
</P>
<P>
Like the others in the colonias, the Morales family relies on friends and 
relatives for drinking water, which they store in drums outside the house. 
</P>
<P>
A community well supplies brackish water not fit for drinking but useful for 
bathing and washing. Residents line up at the well to fill barrels and tanks 
with the salty water and haul it back home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Just Need Water' 
</P>
<P>
"We stay here now because it's home," Maria Morales said. "We're here in the 
desert where there's no smog and no crime. We just need water." 
</P>
<P>
Armando Esquivel, 48, also an unemployed construction worker, said he doesn't 
have a steady job and could not afford to hook up to water and sewage lines 
even if they were available. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the colonias has been championed by El Paso Interreligious 
Sponsoring Organization, an Industrial Areas Foundation community group 
organized to help the poor to help themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Ed Rodan, a spokesman for the group, said the colonias have sprouted 
as economic conditions in the city grew worse, suitable public housing became 
scarce and families sought a better life style for themselves and their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sorry we live here," Esquivel said. "I'm just sorry we don't have any 
water yet." 
</P>
<P>
Rodan blames the land developers. He calls them "greedy liars, looking for 
quick and easy money at the expense of unsuspecting buyers." 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the people of the colonias moved out of El Paso housing projects that 
are riddled with violence, crime and drugs," he said. "Others can't find public 
housing, since El Paso has only a 1% housing vacancy for low-income families 
and a frozen waiting list." 
</P>
<P>
For many in the colonias, he said, moving from the city to the country to get 
away from crime has brought an encounter with a different kind of crime, that 
of "uncaring and dishonest developers." 
</P>
<P>
There have been no deaths reported from the unsanitary living conditions, but 
public health officials say life in the colonias means illnesses usually not 
associated with life in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Laurance Nickey, director of the El Paso City-County Health Unit, said the 
rates of dysentery, hepatitis and lice infestation around El Paso are twice the 
regional average. 
</P>
<P>
He said that in 1987, the last year for which statistics were available, El 
Paso County had almost four times the national rate of salmonella dysentery and 
almost twice the rate of shigella dysentery. 
</P>
<P>
The incidence of infectious hepatitis A in the county was more than five times 
the national rate, Nickey said. El Paso County had more cases of hepatitis A in 
1987 than 24 states, more cases of hepatitis B than 11 states, more shigella 
dysentery than 20 states and more tuberculosis cases than 19 states. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Children Sick 
</P>
<P>
Nickey said that 85% of the children in the Sparks Addition, one of the 
county's worst colonias, suffered from skin rashes, yeast infections, diarrhea 
or vomiting. 
</P>
<P>
The Sparks Addition is not the only colonia with problems. A recent study found 
that water from 98% of 100 wells tested in the San Elizario was unfit even for 
bathing or washing dishes because it was being contaminated by sewage. 
</P>
<P>
Antonio Parra, public relations director for the San Elizario Independent 
School District, said the study proved that the people are bathing in their own 
sewage. He said many households have placed septic tanks too close to the 
shallow wells, or use open pits that leak into the ground water. 
</P>
<P>
While water is a problem around El Paso and in some rural areas of New Mexico, 
Arizona and California, the biggest residential problem in the Rio Grande 
Valley of Texas is a lack of proper sewer systems. 
</P>
<P>
Cameron, Hidalgo, Willacy and Starr counties have about 500 colonias with a 
combined population of about 150,000, said Sister Christine Stephens of Valley 
Interfaith, the Industrial Areas Foundation organization working in South 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"People are building on very small lots," she said. "Each family builds a 
septic tank, but the soil is not able to percolate the sewage. When it rains, 
the tanks overflow." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nation's Poorest Counties 
</P>
<P>
Then the contaminated mud causes serious sanitation problems, she said, and 
poverty in South Texas complicates the the problem. The four counties are the 
poorest in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The colonias of the Rio Grande Valley are larger than those in West Texas, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The 34 small towns in the area are operating on slim budgets and unable to 
assume the cost of extending sewer systems to outlying areas. 
</P>
<P>
Since national news reports have called attention to the area, Texas 
politicians have made proposals that may eventually lead to correction of the 
squalid conditions. 
</P>
<P>
State Comptroller Bob Bullock has suggested a $500-million bond issue to set 
aside aid money for the 25 poorest counties. 
</P>
<P>
Bullock said the bond money could be matched with equal federal funds. His 
proposal was developed in cooperation with the Texas Water Development Board 
and the lieutenant governor's and state treasurer's offices. 
</P>
<P>
It would take about $6,700 per household to supply the colonias with drinking 
water and install sewers, the comptroller said. 
</P>
<P>
A similar measure introduced in the Texas Senate by state Sen. Tati 
Santiesteban, Democrat of El Paso, has the backing of senators from the border 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Border Panel Proposed 
</P>
<P>
U. S. Rep. Ron Coleman (D-Tex.) in the last session of Congress proposed a 
Border Commission to enlist federal resources in solving the problem. His bill 
passed the House but died in the Senate, and Coleman said he would try again. 
</P>
<P>
State Atty. Gen. Jim Mattox has initiated a vigorous program of lawsuits 
against the developers, applying the state's Deceptive Trade Practices Law to 
the advertising used to attract land buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys said the county governments cannot force developers to provide water 
and sewers because Texas counties do not have ordinance-making power. 
</P>
<P>
Mattox has filed about 20 suits during the last two years, citing developers 
for not giving buyers essential information on access roads, septic tank 
requirements and regulations on the proper installation of water, electricity 
and telephone lines.

CAFE AN OASIS OF QUIET IN NOISY MANILA

<TEXT>
<P>
In a cozy corner of Manila's sprawling seaside Rizal Park, visitors can cool 
off at an open-air coffee shop where the loudest sound is the ticking of the 
cash register. 
</P>
<P>
"I like this place. It's so quiet and peaceful," said Frenchman Henry Laborde, 
sipping his morning coffee. "The waiters are deaf and mute but they are nice," 
said the 75-year-old retiree from Paris. 
</P>
<P>
The canteen was established in 1969 by the privately run Philippine Assn. of 
the Deaf (PAD). Association officials said they believe it is the only coffee 
shop in the world run solely by hearing-impaired persons. 
</P>
<P>
Simply named the PAD Coffee Shop, it has 50 employees -- a manager, cooks, 
waiters, waitresses and janitors. All of them communicate through the quick 
hand gestures of sign language. 
</P>
<P>
Only Rodolfo Soriao, PAD director for food services, and a security guard are 
not hearing handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by acacia trees in the expansive park at the edge of sparkling 
Manila Bay, the 250-seat open-air coffee shop is a favorite of foreigners and 
Filipinos who yearn for some peace and quiet in crowded Manila. 
</P>
<P>
Soriao said hearing-impaired from other countries also love to visit the place, 
which is open 24 hours, because "they know that the sign language is universal 
and they can communicate with each other." 
</P>
<P>
Roofed with galvanized iron, the coffee shop has no walls. Breezes from the bay 
keep it free of pollution from smoke-belching buses plying the crowded tourist 
district and from smoke from a nearby oil-fired power plant. 
</P>
<P>
Small gardens surrounding the restaurant filter noise from the traffic and from 
a nearby business district. Steel chairs and tables are neatly lined in rows on 
the concrete pavement. 
</P>
<P>
Within full view is the park's huge fountain in front of the restaurant and the 
elegant Manila Hotel across the grassy expanse. 
</P>
<P>
As a client finds a table, he signals the waiter. Sometimes it takes more than 
one signal because the waiter may be involved in joking or gossiping with 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
The waiter hands over a menu on which the customer is advised in bold letters: 
"You are being served by the deaf." With the menu is a ballpoint pen and a 
blank receipt where the customer jots down his order. 
</P>
<P>
Soriao said the waiters know how to read and count. Most of them have completed 
an elementary and high school education at an institution also run by the 
association and partially paid for by the coffee shop. Employees also have been 
given professional training. 
</P>
<P>
"They are very industrious," Soriao said. "They have to be because they know 
that they cannot easily find jobs outside this place. They're enjoyable to be 
with and there is less intrigue here." 
</P>
<P>
But Soriao said their handicaps sometimes hamper their work. For example, he 
said, when they engage in conversation while washing the dishes, they waste 
time because they have to stop and use their hands to communicate. 
</P>
<P>
Bound by the common silence of their world, the employees find the canteen to 
be as comfortable as home. 
</P>
<P>
"When we go out we feel inferior because we become the butt of jokes," head 
waiter Mises Castro said through an interpreter. "This is our small world." 
</P>
<P>
But hard times have caught up with the business, Soriao said. Profit is barely 
enough to subsidize the school, which offers free education to poor students. 
</P>
<P>
Donations from private institutions in other countries such as Japan, West 
Germany and even China have been of great help to the organization, Soriao 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Work in the canteen also has been rewarding to its employees. 
</P>
<P>
Lila del Rosario, 57, the cheerful chief cook, and her husband, Ernesto, have 
been working in the restaurant since 1971 and have been able to see their three 
children through college as a result. 
</P>
<P>
Soriao said most of the married employees have met their spouses in the 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Children of the coffee shop employees who have inherited their parents' 
handicap also often end up working in the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"The anti-nepotism law cannot be applied here," Soriao said.

MIDWEST COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN BATTLE SPORTS ANGLERS TO MAKE A LIVING

Milford Johnson stoked the Caterpillar engine in his 30-ton fishing tug and 
blasted through half a mile of ice to the churning open waters of Lake 
Superior. It's as rugged a commute as you're likely to find. 
</P>
<P>
"It's got the steel hull so you can really rap it," Johnson yelled. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the wheel of the A. E. Clifford, in his winter overalls and wool cap, 
the 60-year-old Johnson is a relic. When he and about 15 other aging commercial 
fishermen call it quits, the Minnesota waters of Lake Superior will be nearly 
barren of men who make a living off gill nets. 
</P>
<P>
"This type of fishing is really getting choked off," said Johnson, who has 
weathered the industry's steady decline since its heyday in the 1940s. "There's 
no incentive. You can't build boats like this anymore and go out and pay for 
them. They're going to eliminate you with the economy." 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota's 1.4 million acres of Lake Superior, once dominated by rugged 
professional fishermen of Scandinavian descent, are now ruled by sports anglers 
from all over the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Fragile 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota's commercial fishery is smaller and more fragile than its 
counterparts in Wisconsin, Michigan and Ontario. But the trend is the same, 
said Jeff Gunderson of the University of Minnesota Sea Grant Extension Program. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a national trend that's moving toward sports fishing," Gunderson said. "I 
guess the problem is trying to work it out so they can coexist. These types of 
things are usually won by sports fishermen." 
</P>
<P>
The number of full-time commercial fishermen in Minnesota has dwindled from the 
200 of 40 years ago to fewer than 20. The 1988 total catch was worth less than 
$200,000, said Steve Morsey, the state Department of Natural Resources' acting 
fisheries supervisor for Lake Superior. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of sports charter-boat captains has doubled since 1985, 
from 32 to 67, generating an estimated $2.5 million in local spending on the 
North Shore in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the handwriting is on the wall," said Floyd A. Hennagir, fisheries 
program coordinator for the DNR. "You keep reducing the commercial fishermen to 
the point where they don't have any monetary clout or political clout and they 
just kind of fade away like old soldiers. There isn't much you can do about it. 
We're controlled by public sentiment." 
</P>
<P>
Such sentiment is keeping commercial fishermen away from lake trout -- which 
would yield $1.50 a pound compared to 30 to 50 cents for other Lake Superior 
fish -- because they are the bread and butter of the sports fishing industry. 
</P>
<P>
"They think that playing with the fish is more important than producing it for 
food," said 75-year-old Stanley Sivertson of Duluth, a lifelong commercial 
fisherman who owns the Clifford and another large fishing tug. Such boats would 
cost $90,000 today. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial trout fishing has been largely banned since the early 1960s after 
the population of the prized species dropped off sharply, mainly because of 
growing numbers of parasitic sea lamprey. Commercial fishing "was the straw 
that broke the camel's back," said Hennagir. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Annual Catch 
</P>
<P>
According to DNR records, the largest annual commercial catch of lake trout 
from the Minnesota waters of Lake Superior was in 1885, when 1.3 million pounds 
were harvested. The catch routinely exceeded 300,000 pounds a year from 1921 to 
1947, but fell to 11,000 pounds by 1960. 
</P>
<P>
But Sivertson and other commercial fisherman say they had nothing to do with 
the decline of lake trout. They blame the lamprey, herring and fry-eating 
smelt, which they contend were planted in the Great Lakes during the 1940s as 
food for salmon imported for sports angling. Morsey said the smelt escaped from 
inland lakes in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
The trout population has been rejuvenated with the stocking of 1.8 million 
yearlings and fingerlings since 1983 and a lamprey control program. Sivertson 
and other commercial fishermen say an end to the ban would help them. 
</P>
<P>
"There's more trout now than I've ever seen," said Sivertson. However, he and 
others admit that the prospects are dim because of the sportsmen. 
</P>
<P>
Without trout, commercial fishermen are left to rely on smelt, ciscoes, 
whitefish and herring. In 1987, they netted 195,000 pounds of smelt, 112,300 
pounds of herring and 3,000 pounds of ciscoes valued at about $138,000. Another 
$49,500 came from the incidental catch of 2,000 pounds of lake trout and 30,000 
pounds of trout caught under a handful of special permits issued to help the 
DNR monitor the population of the species. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1940s and earlier when there were as many as 200 fishermen, single boats 
would haul in 15 to 20 tons of fish a day, Sivertson said. Nowadays, an 
excellent day will yield half a ton of fish -- the maximum amount that can be 
processed in the scaled-back, on-shore production houses.

 MICRO ... : HAM MAKES EASTER MEAL A SNAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN ANDERSON and ELAINE HANNA, Anderson and Hanna are nutritionists and 
cookbook authors specializing in microwave cookery. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ready-to-eat hams microwave superbly and require very little effort from the 
cook, which makes preparing the traditional Easter meal a snap. 
</P>
<P>
Any kind of commercial ham will do. And you can glaze it or not, as you desire. 
But bear these points in mind. 
</P>
<P>
Trim the ham of all but 1/8 inch of exterior fat. Fat attracts microwaves, 
melts rapidly and produces an abundance of drippings that must be ladled off. 
Further, a heavy coating of fat will cause the lean areas directly underneath 
it to overcook. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Good Spice Choices 
</P>
<P>
If you like, rub a ham with pepper and herbs before it goes into the microwave. 
Sage, thyme, dill weed, crushed caraway or fennel seeds, marjoram and oregano 
are all good choices. 
</P>
<P>
Always use a microwave-safe meat thermometer -- or if your oven has one, a 
temperature probe -- when cooking ham so you can pull it from the oven the 
instant the proper internal temperature is reached. 
</P>
<P>
To keep shank ends and the top edges of hams from drying, shield carefully with 
aluminum foil as the following recipe directs. 
</P>
<P>
GLAZED HAM 
</P>
<P>
1 (4- to 6-pound) bone-in, butt or shank-portion ham or semi-boneless 
ready-to-eat ham or fully cooked, smoked picnic shoulder 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup light brown sugar, packed 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons prepared spicy brown mustard 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon cider vinegar 
</P>
<P>
Raisin Sauce, optional 
</P>
<P>
Trim outer layer of fat on ham to 1/8 inch. Tie ham with string (to keep fat 
from separating as ham cooks) and place on microwave-safe rack in shallow 
microwave-safe bake/roast pan. If ham wobbles, prop up with crumpled wax paper. 
</P>
<P>
Smooth sheet of plastic wrap against cut surface of ham, then mold 1- to 2-inch 
foil strip smoothly over upper edge where fat joins lean to deflect microwaves 
and prevent overcooking. (If cooking shank-portion ham, foil-wrap shank end.) 
</P>
<P>
Insert microwave-safe meat thermometer through plastic wrap in center of 
largest muscle not touching fat or bone. Or, use automatic temperature probe 
according to manufacturer's directions. Or, test ham with instant-register 
thermometer as it approaches doneness. 
</P>
<P>
Microwave ham, uncovered, on HIGH (100% power) 5 minutes. Reduce power to 
MEDIUM (50% power) and microwave 7 to 10 minutes per pound. 
</P>
<P>
At half time, invert ham and rotate pan 180 degrees. Remove foil but not 
plastic wrap. Continue microwaving until thermometer registers 130 degrees. If 
desired, score fat, criss-cross fashion, 10 minutes before ham is done. 
</P>
<P>
Drain off all drippings, reserving 1/4 cup for Raisin Sauce. Remove plastic 
wrap. Combine brown sugar, mustard and vinegar and spread over ham. Microwave, 
uncovered, on MEDIUM 5 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Remove ham from oven, tent with foil and let stand 10 minutes. Serve as is or 
accompany with Raisin Sauce. Makes 6 to 10 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Raisin Sauce 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup pan dripping (or drippings plus enough bacon drippings to total 1/4 
cup) 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup flour 
</P>
<P>
2 cups hot water 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup raisins 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup medium-dry Madeira, Sherry or Port 
</P>
<P>
Liquid gravy browner, optional 
</P>
<P>
Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
Microwave drippings in wax-paper-covered 6-cup measure on HIGH (100% power) 40 
to 50 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Blend in flour and microwave, uncovered, on HIGH 7 to 10 minutes, stirring 
every 3 minutes, until light brown. Mixture will look grainy but will smooth 
out once liquid is added. 
</P>
<P>
Pour water into drained ham pan and scrap up brown bits. Whisk liquid carefully 
into hot roux being careful of spattering. Microwave, uncovered, on HIGH 3 1/2 
to 4 minutes, whisking at half time, until sauce thickens and boils. 
</P>
<P>
Mix in raisins and Madeira and microwave, uncovered, on MEDIUM-LOW (30% power) 
4 to 5 minutes, until raisins are plump. Mix in gravy browner and salt and 
pepper to taste. Makes 2 1/2 cups. 
</P>
<P>
Note: In ovens of less than 600 watts, increase cooking times about 15%.

 COOK IT LIGHT: A HAM LOAF WITH VEAL -- AND TURKEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
DEAR JEANNE: I have used this Ham Loaf recipe since the 1930s. It is hard to 
find veal in small markets, so the last time I made it I used turkey. That 
changed the taste for me very much. I also used liquid egg substitute. 
</P>
<P>
Could you lower the cholesterol and fat, and still have a nice Ham Loaf for me? 
Thank you. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELEN, Broadlands, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
BAKED HAM LOAF 
</P>
<P>
1 pound ground ham 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 pounds ground veal 
</P>
<P>
2 eggs, lightly beaten 
</P>
<P>
1 cup cracker crumbs 
</P>
<P>
1 cup milk 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1/8 teaspoon black pepper 
</P>
<P>
6 slices pineapple 
</P>
<P>
10 maraschino cherries 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup brown sugar, packed 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon dry mustard 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup vinegar 
</P>
<P>
Combine ham, veal, eggs, cracker crumbs, milk, salt and pepper. 
</P>
<P>
Generously grease 10 1/2 x 6 1/2-inch loaf pan. Place 6 slices pineapple with 
maraschino cherry in center and between each slice in bottom of pan. Combine 
brown sugar, mustard and vinegar and spread 1/2 over fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Pack meat mixture in pan over fruit and sauce. Spread remaining brown sugar 
mixture over top of loaf. Pack down well. Bake at 400 degrees 1 1/2 to 2 hours. 
Turn out on platter. Makes 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELEN: This is truly a delicious meat loaf. Unfortunately, there isn't 
much I can do to it that is going to make it significantly healthier than the 
variations you may have already tried. 
</P>
<P>
Veal is naturally higher in cholesterol than almost any other meat. Since the 
turkey substitution didn't taste right to you, I have left the veal alone. Just 
be sure you use the leanest meats that you can get. You might try using turkey 
and veal in combination (such as 1 pound veal and 1/2 pound turkey). Turkey has 
about half the cholesterol of veal, and only about two-thirds of the calories. 
</P>
<P>
I have used liquid egg substitute and non-fat milk in my revision, and I also 
specified pineapple packed in juice to be sure you aren't using the kind packed 
in heavy syrup, which is practically pure sugar. I don't recommend using 
maraschino cherries either, so I made them optional. I prefer to avoid the 
chemical additives they contain, especially the red dye. 
</P>
<P>
By eliminating the salt and substituting whole-wheat bread crumbs for the 
cracker crumbs, I was able to reduce the sodium in your recipe. I like the 
flavor the bread crumbs give the loaf as well as the added fiber. 
</P>
<P>
The sauce is another source of calories, so I reduced the amount of brown sugar 
and specified "dark brown sugar" to get maximum flavor for the calories 
consumed. I also based my nutritional analysis on both recipes making eight 
servings since I determined that the whole loaf yields about sixteen 1/2-inch 
slices. 
</P>
<P>
You have been enjoying this Ham Loaf for more than 50 years, and I hope my 
revised version will enable you to enjoy it for another 50! 
</P>
<P>
REVISED BAKED HAM LOAF 
</P>
<P>
1 pound extra-lean baked ham, ground or very finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 pounds extra-lean ground veal 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup liquid egg substitute 
</P>
<P>
1 cup nonfat milk 
</P>
<P>
1 cup soft whole-wheat bread crumbs 
</P>
<P>
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup dark brown sugar, packed 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon dry mustard 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup white vinegar 
</P>
<P>
6 slices canned pineapple, packed in juice 
</P>
<P>
10 maraschino cherries, optional 
</P>
<P>
Combine ham, veal, egg substitute, milk, bread crumbs and pepper. Combine brown 
sugar, dry mustard and vinegar in separate bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Spray 10 1/2 x 6 1/2-inch loaf pan with non-stick vegetable coating. Place 6 
slices pineapple on bottom of pan. Place cherry in center of -- and in between 
-- pineapple slices. Pour 1/2 sauce mixture over fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Pack meat mixture in pan over fruit and sauce. Pour remaining sauce over top of 
loaf. Bake at 400 degrees 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Turn out onto platter. Makes 8 
servings, or 16 (1/2-inch) slices.

TRADITION SAYS HAM FOR EASTER; 
</P>
<P>
TANGY RHUBARB SAUCE CAN ADD TO HOLIDAY DINNER ENJOYMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Traditional Easter feasts often center around a tender, juicy ham. Most hams 
today are fully cooked and available as either boneless or bone-in. Convenience 
in carving makes the boneless variety especially popular. 
</P>
<P>
A boneless fully cooked ham provides four to five (three-ounce) servings per 
pound. To serve hot, heat 18 to 25 minutes per pound, or to an internal 
temperature of 130 to 140 degrees. For an extra-special touch, serve with tangy 
Rhubarb Sauce. 
</P>
<P>
HAM WITH RHUBARB SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
1 (3- to 4-pound) boneless fully cooked ham half 
</P>
<P>
1 (1-pound) package frozen cut rhubarb, thawed 
</P>
<P>
1 1/4 cups sugar 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup orange juice 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons grated orange peel 
</P>
<P>
3/4 teaspoon dry mustard 
</P>
<P>
1 cinnamon stick 
</P>
<P>
Place ham on rack in open roasting pan. Insert meat thermometer so bulb is 
centered in thickest part. Roast at 325 degrees 18 to 25 minutes per pound or 
until thermometer registers 130 to 140 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, combine rhubarb, sugar, orange juice, orange peel, mustard and 
cinnamon stick in large saucepan. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium and 
cook, uncovered, 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove cinnamon stick. 
</P>
<P>
Spoon small amount sauce over ham 15 minutes before end of cooking time. Serve 
remaining sauce with ham. Makes 12 to 20 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: 3 cups sliced fresh rhubarb may be substituted for frozen rhubarb.

 FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: SORRY SAGA OF EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL ON PREGNANCY AND 
UNBORN INFANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I recently read an article advising against drinking alcohol during 
pregnancy. The author said that the dangers of alcohol were first identified in 
a report published only 20 years ago. Is that true? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Not exactly, although the modern process for studying the problem fell 
into place around then. An issue of the journal Public Health Reports devoted 
to alcohol-related problems contains an article by Dr. Kenneth R. Warren of the 
National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and Richard Bast of the 
National Clearinghouse for Alcoholism and Drug Information that reviews the 
sorry saga of concern about the effects of alcohol on unborn infants. 
</P>
<P>
Lower birth weights and a rise in deaths were observed during the London "Gin 
Epidemic" between 1720 and 1750. It was a period of good wages, plentiful food 
and relative freedom from epidemic diseases. However, Parliament had reduced 
controls on the distilling and sale of gin in order to support the gentry who 
furnished the raw materials. This encouraged alcohol consumption. Reports and 
petitions from physicians and others referred to effects on children that 
correlate with what we today call Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). 
</P>
<P>
Such reports on the impact of alcohol on growth and development continued 
through the 18th and 19th centuries, often mixing science and mortality. In 
1899, Dr. William Sullivan reported his observations of 600 offspring of 120 
women alcoholic prisoners in Liverpool, describing what was later called FAS. 
</P>
<P>
Here in the United States (as well as Great Britain), with the arrival of 
Prohibition, concern about the effects of alcohol on pregnancy were largely 
ignored for about 20 years. Ironically, much of the research conducted during 
the 1940s and beyond tended to refute the harmful ramifications of drinking. 
Alcohol was even recommended to pregnant women for "sluggish digestion" and was 
used to delay labor. 
</P>
<P>
Then in 1967, Alexandre Lamache, a family physician in Rennes, France, 
presented to the French Academy his observations of 1,245 children, collected 
during 37 years of practice. This signaled a rebirth of interest in 
alcohol-related birth abnormalities. A year later, a group of French 
researchers published what was apparently the first well-organized study of 
birth defects. In 1970, the pattern of characteristic abnormalities labeled FAS 
was first described in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, estimates based on 20 studies from Australia, Europe and North America 
indicate that Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is the leading cause of mental 
retardation, ahead of Down's syndrome and spina bifida. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Please tell me something about the vegetable called kohlrabi. 
</P>
<P>
A: Botanically, kohlrabi (the name derives from the German word for cabbage and 
the Latin word for turnip) belongs to the cabbage family. Although the leaves 
are edible, the turnip-like root is usually considered the best part. 
</P>
<P>
Nutritionally, a half cup cooked contains about 40 calories and provides some B 
vitamins and Vitamin C. It is an excellent source of potassium, a useful 
vegetable for people taking diuretics that cause them to lose that nutrient. 
</P>
<P>
While it can be easily diced and cooked until tender, it can also be braised in 
broth, whipped with potatoes, served with sauces, stuffed, cooked in soup, or 
served cold with vinaigrette dressing. Introduced in China from Europe during 
the 7th Century, it appears in various Chinese recipes.

Q: I've noticed that when nutrients are added to foods, the word "enriched" 
sometimes appears on the label, while other times the word "fortified" is used. 
What, if any, is the difference? 
</P>
<P>
A: Both terms are associated with the addition of nutrients, but the underlying 
concepts differ. "Enrichment" refers to the restoration of nutrients discarded 
during processing. Nutrients are added back at levels equal to or not much 
greater than those in the original food. The classic example of enrichment is 
the restoration of iron along with the B vitamins thiamine, riboflavin and 
niacin to white flour. 
</P>
<P>
"Fortification" is the addition of nutrients that either are not normally 
present in food, or the amount available is too small to be nutritionally 
significant. A number of fortification measures have been dramatically 
effective in combatting major nutritional deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
For example, more than 40 years ago, carotene, which the body converts to 
Vitamin A, was first added to margarine in Denmark when it was discovered that 
the switch from butter to margarine during World War II was linked to blindness 
among children there. Similarly, milk was a logical vehicle for Vitamin D 
fortification to prevent rickets. And the addition of iodine to salt was an 
effective tool in preventing goiter. 
</P>
<P>
Those were important public-health measures. In recent years, the basis for 
much fortification seems far less clear. In many cases, the addition of 
generous helpings of vitamins and minerals appears to be inspired more by the 
goal of selling products than by a demonstrated need for the added nutrients. 
Selecting heavily fortified cereals or other foods containing as much as 100% 
of the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowance for some nutrients is no substitute for 
consuming a varied and well-balanced diet.

WESTSIDE HOUSING PRICES SOAR; NO END SEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH J. GARCIA, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Each year, the traffic on the Westside get more congested. New commercial 
construction blots out residential views. Developers and environmentalists 
battle for every remaining piece of open space. Parking becomes increasingly 
scarce. Homeowner groups raise their voices in protest. 
</P>
<P>
And real estate prices in the Westside continue to soar to new heights. 
</P>
<P>
Forget the complaints about the crumbling quality of life on the Westside. 
Hordes of affluent home buyers are lining up, sometimes with millions in cash, 
to grab a chunk of land as close as they can to the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outpacing the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
The prices are staggering. Middle- and upper-income families are being frozen 
out of the modest Westside neighborhoods. Former blue-collar communities are 
becoming havens for starch-collared corporate executives. And in a city as 
celebrity-conscious as Los Angeles, real estate agents are becoming stars, 
sought after by the rich and famous. 
</P>
<P>
Economists predict that real estate prices in the section of Los Angeles County 
bordered on the north by the Santa Monica Mountains, on the south by Los 
Angeles International Airport and on the east by Western Avenue will continue 
to outpace all but a few communities in the United States during the next few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The average sales price of single-family homes jumped more than $100,000 in at 
least 10 Westside areas over the last year, according to sales reported through 
multiple listing services. The average sales price in several other communities 
jumped more than $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
In the sharpest increase reported, the average sales price of a single-family 
home in Playa del Rey rose 63% in 1988, leaping to a new high of $603,000. And 
that's in an area troubled by airport noise. The listing prices were even 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
And the homes for sale on the Westside were on the market only half as long as 
they were a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Although the real estate boom engulfed numerous areas of the Southland, 
particularly such places as Pasadena, Glendale and the West San Fernando 
Valley, the surge pumped up the already-steep prices in numerous Westside 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
The average sales price of single-family homes in Beverly Hills and Bel-Air 
already top the $1 million mark. Next year, Brentwood probably will join that 
list. Malibu and Pacific Palisades are only a few years away. 
</P>
<P>
Why the house-buying frenzy? What is driving up the asking and selling prices 
of Westside bungalows to mansion levels? 
</P>
<P>
Industry experts say it's a simple imbalance between supply and demand. 
Available Westside land is almost used up, and with a booming regional economy 
luring people from throughout the country to Los Angeles, more and more people 
are lining up to try to buy the best properties. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the only thing that would make the escalation stop would be if the 
financial services community doesn't make as much money available to home 
buyers," said Michael Salkin, an economist and senior vice president at First 
Interstate Bank. "But I don't think the trend will reverse until the state of 
California no longer attracts households for economic reasons." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little New Housing 
</P>
<P>
Although population growth on the Westside has lagged behind the rest of Los 
Angeles County -- rising only 8% since 1980, compared with 12% countywide -- 
the fixed housing supply has dramatically lifted sale prices. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same phenomenon that occurs in San Francisco, where even if the 
population rises only slightly, there is still very little new housing being 
built," said Salkin. 
</P>
<P>
"Prices won't stop increasing until the population drops or the economic 
strength shifts to other parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental fact is that you've got a lot more people chasing houses than 
there are houses available." 
</P>
<P>
In the last 12 months, while the demand for housing surged throughout Southern 
California, the Westside was targeted by a huge influx of home buyers. Industry 
analysts say that the already limited inventory of housing previously has been 
sold in only three months. In the last few years, it would have taken eight to 
12 months to exhaust the supply of single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
"The price pressures on the Westside are reflective of much of coastal 
California," said Joel Singer, chief economist for the California Assn. of 
Realtors. "You will continue to have rising prices on the Westside because of 
the scarcity of land. As the job market on the Westside continues to grow, it 
will promote a further demand for housing, but it's not going to generate new 
housing." 
</P>
<P>
The result will be a continuing trend of what real estate agents call multiple 
bid offers, where groups of prospective buyers try to outspend each other for 
newly listed properties. Singer and other economists say they haven't seen 
anything like it since a similar housing boom in the late '70s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few New Homes 
</P>
<P>
Ben Bartolotto, director of the Construction Industry Research Board, said the 
small supply of new homes on the Westside will continue to drive existing home 
prices up. 
</P>
<P>
"Of all the construction in Los Angeles County, the Westside accounts for less 
than 10%," he said. "The only things that are being built are either condos or 
very large and prestigious single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
"When you combine that with the already high land prices, you're talking about 
a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
Real estate market watchdogs point to foreign investment in Westside properties 
as another reason house prices are jumping off the charts. 
</P>
<P>
"The increase of foreign capital is the wild card," Singer said. "Clearly it 
increases the demand and pushes the prices even higher. But there's no way to 
quantify it." 
</P>
<P>
However, industry experts say that although they expect Westside real estate 
prices to continue to rise, they will rise at a much slower rate than they did 
in 1988, when home prices rose an average of 23%. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year was crazy," said Jon Douglas, president of the real estate company 
which bears his name. "I've never seen anything like it." 
</P>
<P>
Some industry analysts are concerned that the rising price of homes throughout 
the Westside may begin to change the character of the community. They say that 
the elements that make the area so desirable -- good weather, lots of cultural 
offerings, new jobs and overall panache -- are shifting the base of the 
community from just very expensive to nearly exclusive. 
</P>
<P>
"What the numbers mask is that you've got a different population in the 
Westside now, more affluent," said Salkin. "In a situation like that, the 
cultural, the ethnic and the employment characteristics will change, but it 
doesn't happen overnight." 
</P>
<P>
The overall effect of the decrease in moderate housing could be a reassessment 
-- and ultimate rejection -- of Westside properties by prospective home buyers, 
according to some real estate experts. But even they predict it will be years 
before there is any significant drop in the price of housing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drop in Value? 
</P>
<P>
"The future housing situation depends on a lot of different scenarios such as 
the increasing traffic problem and the effect that has on new (commercial) 
building in the area," said Kathleen M. Connell, chair of the Center for 
Finance and Real Estate at UCLA's Graduate School of Management. "If there 
continues to be a lack of affordable rental housing and people can no longer 
afford to work on the Westside, then I do think you will see a revaluation of 
what has been a substantial premium of living on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't anticipate a great drop in value, but whether it increases as rapidly 
as in the past is doubtful," she said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Douglas said the factors that make Westside housing so expensive are 
not likely to change. He said that in the last decade, the price of detached 
single-family homes there has risen an average of 16% each year. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the rent-control atmosphere that exists in places like Santa 
Monica, you're not going to see much new development," Douglas said. "So the 
existing base price of residences in the area will continue to go up. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the last 20 years, with the exception of a couple of recessions, Westside 
real estate values have never gone down. I think that will continue to happen 
as long as people can continue to afford those properties on the Westside." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Highly Affordable 
</P>
<P>
If that's the case, Westside properties will sell at at escalating rates for a 
long time. First Interstate's Salkin said, however, that by world standards, 
the Westside is highly affordable. 
</P>
<P>
"When you compare it to places like Tokyo and Hong Kong, it's not expensive," 
he said. "America is still fairly underpriced compared to the rest of the 
industrial countries. We're a bargain basement society when it comes to 
houses." 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, the median sales price of a home rose from $150,000 in January, 
1988, to $177,000 in December, 1988, and $185,000 in January, 1989, according 
the the California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 850,000 California homes were sold, 250,000 of them new. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at whether housing is overpriced in California, all you have to 
see is that nearly 1 million people bought homes at these prices," Salkin said. 
"So are housing payments exaggerated here? It's tough . . . to say yes."

RAPIST: PAIR'S WARNING SENT OUT BY FEET AND FLYERS; 
</P>
<P>
TWO SAN CARLOS WOMEN USE THEIR FEET AND FLYERS TO WARN COMMUNITY OF RAPIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cindy Freeman and Cindy Galloway live in San Carlos, where a series of rapes 
has occurred over the past several months. Police believe that the same man is 
committing the crimes. In each case, the abductions occurred on or near Mission 
Gorge Road. 
</P>
<P>
About a week ago, a friend of Galloway's was sexually assaulted -- "not raped," 
Galloway said. Although the woman refused to report the crime, which occurred 
in San Carlos, Galloway decided to act. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, she and Freeman distributed more than 600 flyers, sticking them 
on shop windows, street signs and telephone booths. During their walking tours 
of the area, Freeman said, the two never go alone. They always take with them 
her two trained guard dogs, one a boxer, the other a pit bull mix. 
</P>
<P>
This week, the two roommates have appeared on television. They've met with the 
family of one of the victims. Neighbors are approaching, wanting to know more, 
asking how they can help. Television and newspaper reporters are requesting 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I'm exhausted," Freeman, 27, said Thursday. "I'm trying to go to 
school, too," she said of her law studies. 
</P>
<P>
Galloway, 25, said their goal is "for everyone to see his face, and for someone 
to turn him in. The more media coverage we get, the better the chance that 
someone will recognize his face and lead the police to capture him." 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Claude Gray, who heads the robbery, sex crimes and child abuse unit of the 
San Diego Police Department, said he has no objection to the women's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's very commendable that they're getting involved," Gray said. "I 
certainly don't have any objection that they're distributing flyers." 
</P>
<P>
Gray said police know of four cases that "bear enough similarities that would 
lead us to believe that the rapes were probably committed by the same 
individual." He said the rapes -- the ones that were reported, that is -- date 
from Sept. 21 to Feb. 17. 
</P>
<P>
He said the victims were accosted between the 6000 and 7000 blocks of Mission 
Gorge Road, between the 7000 and 8000 blocks of Margerum, between the 8000 and 
9000 blocks of Jackson Drive and between the 10000 and 11000 blocks of San 
Diego Mission Road. 
</P>
<P>
"In three of the cases, the victim was accosted getting into or out of the 
car," Gray said. "The man was armed with a handgun in each case. The other 
woman was accosted near the swimming pool of her apartment complex, then taken 
back into her apartment." 
</P>
<P>
Gray said the victims are in their early 20s. He said descriptions of the 
suspect have him ranging in height from 5-foot-5 to 5-foot-10. He is described 
as a Middle Eastern man of medium build with dark hair. In the first case, he 
was described as unshaven; in all others, he was said to have a full beard and 
mustache. He is reported to range in age from 30 to 42. 
</P>
<P>
Police distributed flyers bearing a composite drawing of the suspect to homes 
throughout San Carlos. Galloway and Freeman have added to that effort, saying 
they were frustrated by the effort made by the police. 
</P>
<P>
"We hadn't seen police in the neighborhood, nor had we seen anything about it 
on the TV news," Galloway said. "We were frightened to even go out of our home, 
so we decided maybe there was something we could do. We made 600 copies of the 
flyers, spent $50 doing it, and just started walking. All kinds of people have 
given us information. Women give us the thumbs-up sign. An elderly man said he 
saw us on the news. He said, 'I think what you're doing is great. Hope you 
catch him.' " 
</P>
<P>
Galloway said some shop employees were reluctant to have the flyers displayed 
in their windows, but the women "went up the chain of command" as Galloway put 
it, and in every case got permission to post them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conflicting Flyers 
</P>
<P>
The flyer describes the suspect as a white male with fair complexion, 5-foot-8 
to 6 feet tall, 30 to 40 years old, 150 to 160 pounds. A separate Neighborhood 
Watch flyer, distributed by the police, says the suspect is about 5-foot-5 to 6 
feet, 150 pounds, with a full beard and mustache, black, wavy hair and a large, 
rounded nose, with possibly an acne-pitted face. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been described by all of the victims as having a full beard and 
mustache," Galloway said. "But my friend said he didn't have a beard, although 
everything else conformed to the description. They say he's well-groomed and 
often wears a brown leather jacket with tinted glasses and a ring on his left 
hand." 
</P>
<P>
"When using a composite (drawing), sometimes the investigator gets conflicting 
statements from victims," police spokesman Bill Robinson said. "Such has been 
the case in the San Carlos series, in which two composites given varied 
immeasurably in the portrayal of the suspect. In one case, the face is thin, 
the hair is long and combed straight back. In the other, the face is more 
round. The man is wearing glasses with the hair parted on the left and combed 
straight." Robinson said police still believe the crimes were committed by one 
man. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman said the friend of Galloway was abducted at the 24-hour Shell service 
station at Jackson Drive and Navajo Road. She said she and Galloway have also 
heard of two unreported rapes, one occurring near the Video Library on Navajo 
Road, the other on Tuxedo Road off Golfcrest Drive. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been a crime victim in the past," Freeman said, "so I'm upset about this. 
I can understand why these women aren't reporting the crimes. We just want the 
suspect apprehended. In the meantime, we want women to be careful. The suspect 
usually attacks at night -- although one rape was at 10 a.m.and usually when a 
woman is getting into or out of her car." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the unreported cases, Lt. Gray said: "I only wish the women would 
come forward. We need all the information we can get."

Burmas's military government said Friday it would gradually relax emergency 
laws imposed last year after a national uprising. 
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman told a news conference in Rangoon that a 10 p.m.-to4 
a.m. curfew and a ban on gatherings of more than five people "will be relaxed 
gradually as conditions and circumstances improve". 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats in the Burmese capital, however, said that for fear of further unrest 
the government was unlikely to reopen schools shut since bloody campus battles

THE WRONG LESSON ABOUT TERRORISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bombing of Sharon Rogers' car has brought home the dilemmas of dealing with 
terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials have not determined whether the pipe bomb that 
exploded under the car belonging to the wife of Will Rogers III, the captain of 
the guided missile cruiser Vincennes, was planted in retaliation for the ship's 
accidental downing of an Iranian civilian airliner last July, or for some other 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
But the possibility that it was a terrorist act has planted a deep seed of 
fear. 
</P>
<P>
One place where anxiety has been understandably high is La Jolla Country Day 
School, a private school for about 700 children, where Sharon Rogers has taught 
for the past 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
She took time off from her job after the March 10 bombing, and parents 
expressed considerable concern about the pupils' safety if she were to return. 
At the same time, parents and administrators did not want to lose a talented 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
The dilemma was resolved Thursday -- two days after a bomb threat was phoned in 
to the school -- when La Jolla Country Day announced it had reached a mutual 
agreement with Rogers for her to resign, "to ensure the safety of the children, 
the confidence of the parents and the integrity of the educational environment 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
But the resolution raises troubling questions. 
</P>
<P>
First, why did the school act so hastily? The FBI hasn't even finished its 
investigation. It may turn out that the pipe bomb was not the work of 
terrorists, in which case Rogers will have lost her job and the school will 
have needlessly lost a well-regarded teacher. If sufficient security could not 
be provided to allow Rogers to teach, why not give her a leave of absence until 
the end of the school year or until the investigation is finished? 
</P>
<P>
At least by waiting a few months, the decision could have been made in a less 
fearful atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Also, what message is La Jolla Country Day sending to its students about 
terrorism? Learning to balance safety and principle is one of life's most 
difficult lessons, filled with shades of gray. 
</P>
<P>
Safety may have won out too easily in this case, especially since backing down 
in the face of terrorism is likely to invite more threats. 
</P>
<P>
We believe parent Richard Levin expressed it well when he said in a news story 
that Sharon Rogers' resignation might have been "the safe thing to do, but not 
the right thing to do."

REFLECTIONS: 'BUFFALOES ARE VERY LEAN ANIMALS, SO IT ULTIMATELY RESULTS IN A 
MEAT THAT IS LOW IN FAT, CHOLESTEROL AND CALORIES.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Leslie Wolf, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ken Childs, once a tool salesman in Central California, now has a home where 
the buffalo roam. And to him, it approximates paradise. Childs and his wife, 
Denice, both 37, have a buffalo ranch in Ramona, which produced the American 
Bison Assn.'s Gold Trophy Champion for 1989. Times staff writer Leslie Wolf 
interviewed Ken Childs at the Star B Ranch in Ramona, and Kenneth Lam 
photographed him. 
</P>
<P>
 People think of San Diego as palm trees and yachts and beaches, yet they 
should realize that the No. 1 buffalo in the nation came from right here in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
We started raising buffalo mainly out of a need to keep this ranch in the 
family. My wife's father had the ranch for about a year before we came here to 
manage it for him. He's a big businessman up in Los Angeles. I had a 
tool-distributing business, but typical of any business, it just totally 
drained my time and my family life was suffering. We knew we had to make a 
change. Then the opportunity came up here, and my wife's father urged us to 
come down and see what we could do. 
</P>
<P>
Our first intention was to develop, but it didn't take us long to see this is a 
special place. We thought we'd try to create a business here first. 
</P>
<P>
We needed an idea. We looked into horses and cattle, but realistically, 1,000 
acres is not enough to raise a lot of cattle, and the horse business is very 
competitive. We heard about exotic animals, so we looked into it, and here we 
are nine years later, full on into the buffalo business. 
</P>
<P>
We had a lot of learning to do. We had to build up all the fences around the 
place, and build a good solid corral. Then we had to create a market for the 
buffalo meat. 
</P>
<P>
I don't have much marketing experience, but I really like what I'm selling. 
Buffalo meat is becoming more and more in demand because buffaloes are very 
lean animals, so it ultimately results in a meat that is low in fat, 
cholesterol and calories. It has a lower cholesterol content than chicken. It's 
good for heart patients who are starving for a good old burger. We also do not 
give them any growth stimulants or steroids, so the public really appreciates 
that. It tastes just like beef, but actually has more flavor to it because it 
has less fat. 
</P>
<P>
It also gives the restaurants a good gimmick. Everybody can relate to the 
history of the American bison. . . . Most people don't know it, but an influx 
of water buffalo is coming into the country, and the quality of meat doesn't 
even compare. So we tell people to make sure they're getting American bison 
meat. 
</P>
<P>
We also sell buffalo skulls, trophy heads, bones, and hides to make buffalo 
robes from. We ship the skulls everywhere, especially to art galleries because 
of the Southwestern art interest right now. It gets back to the Plains Indian 
and how they utilized the buffalo as their lifeblood. They worshipped the 
buffalo. You can decorate buffalo skulls in ways that have a lot of spiritual 
meaning, but I'm not an Indian and don't profess to know the spiritual 
meanings, so I try to stay away from that. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of people ask me if bison isn't an endangered species, but they are not. 
They were protected by the government back around 1874, so that hunters 
wouldn't wipe out the species. The government put the buffalo in different 
state parks, and they did very well at preserving the herd. Their numbers got 
to be so many, they started selling them to the public, which makes it possible 
for people like us to raise them. 
</P>
<P>
The only wild herd left is in Yellowstone Park. But they have a disease called 
brucellosis, which is a problem, and the herd is getting so big they are 
leaving the park. You just can't have a bunch of buffalo roaming around free 
into highways and towns. The state of Montana is giving out permits for people 
to go shoot them, and it's causing a lot of problems. The buffalo are the ones 
suffering, unfortunately. 
</P>
<P>
Even the ones on this ranch are wild animals, basically. Some of them will eat 
out of your hand, but that's about as friendly as we get. They can be very 
dangerous, actually, because they know how to use those horns and they can ruin 
you real quick. I've been chased many times, but fortunately I've always gotten 
away.

DRIVE-BY SLAYING LEADS TO ARREST OF TWO SUSPECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two suspects were arrested Friday shortly after a drive-by shooting left a 
youth dead, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Marvin Dwayne Stancil and Lloyd Baker, both 18, are being held in County Jail 
on suspicion of murder. 
</P>
<P>
Demetrius E. Wallace, 17, was with some friends at 54th and Olive streets at 
7:49 p.m. when a gray Mitsubishi pickup truck passed by, heading north on 54th 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
According to authorities, Wallace and his friends got into an argument with two 
men in a pickup truck. The truck left the site but later returned, and its 
passengers allegedly fired a volley of shots at Wallace's group, police said. 
The truck went north on 54th Street. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace, who was struck in the head, was rushed to Sharp Memorial Hospital, 
where he was pronounced dead at 8:50 p.m.

RESTAURANT OWNER IS STUFFED IN CAR TRUNK DURING ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The owner of a smorgasbord restaurant was robbed at gunpoint and kidnapped in 
his own vehicle by two men Friday, police reported. 
</P>
<P>
Helge Hensen, proprietor of the Nordic Inn, 3577 Midway Drive, was leaving 
around 9:20 p.m. when he was approached by two men. The men first robbed him of 
the cash receipts at gunpoint and then forced Hensen into the passenger 
compartment of his car. 
</P>
<P>
A cap was placed over Hensen's head, and he was later forced into the car's 
trunk. 
</P>
<P>
The men drove around for several hours. California Highway Patrol officers 
attempted to pull the car over for what they suspected to be drunken driving 
but were fired at by the suspects. No one was hit, but a round struck the 
cruiser's radiator, preventing the officers from pursuing the suspects. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects drove to 3000 Rue D'Orleans, where they abandoned the car with 
Hensen still in the trunk. When Hensen realized the suspects had left, he 
banged on the trunk door for about 25 minutes. A passer-by released him. 
</P>
<P>
The first suspect was described as a white male in his late 30s, with short, 
graying black hair and several days' beard growth. The second suspect was 
described as a male, possibly black, in his late 20s, with short, dark curly 
hair.

ACTIVISTS GET TIPS TO COUNTER RALLIES AGAINST ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To veteran activists, the litany of advice -- wear sensible shoes, don't wear 
dangling earrings, stick together, resist the temptation to lash out -- would 
have sounded pretty basic. 
</P>
<P>
But to the 25 mostly neophytes who gathered Saturday at Pierce College to be 
trained to peacefully counter the efforts of Operation Rescue's anti-abortion 
squads later this week, the advice was welcome. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me feel better . . . that all the young people there will be better 
organized," said Zoe Treguboff, a Woodland Hills psychologist in her 60s. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of us haven't done much demonstrating, and we're up against a pretty 
rough crowd," she said. "They talk as though they are gentle, but they behave 
in a pretty rough manner." 
</P>
<P>
Operation Rescue is a group of anti-abortion demonstrators that has injected 
1960s protest tactics into the nation's debate over a woman's right to have an 
abortion. Members have blockaded abortion clinics nationwide, and the group 
says more than 20,000 members have been arrested as a result. 
</P>
<P>
Operation Rescue has said it plans to blockade clinics in the Los Angeles area 
Thursday through Saturday in defiance of a U.S. District Court injunction 
barring such actions, with as many as 2,000 volunteers from all over the 
country. A coalition that includes the American Civil Liberties Union, Planned 
Parenthood and the National Organization for Women hopes to have just as many 
activists try to keep clinics open. 
</P>
<P>
Several of those at Saturday's training session at Pierce College said they 
were prompted to shed their lassitude and were spurred to action by Operation 
Rescue's tactics. 
</P>
<P>
Among the recruits was Roz Mandelcorn, 46, a Studio City business systems 
analyst who said she had not participated in a demonstration for 20 years. 
"America is a country of choice, and I think it ought to remain that way," she 
said. "I'm really concerned about the conservative movement in this country." 
</P>
<P>
The training volunteers received Saturday was partly common-sense and partly 
designed to make sure that pro-choice activities this week send a politically 
correct message. 
</P>
<P>
They were told to wear red, white and blue -- "to show that pro-choice is 
American." They were also told to dress comfortably, but neatly. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to look middle-class," said Alexander Shapiro of Van Nuys, who 
represented the ACLU at the training session. "We're representing middle 
America even if they think they are." 
</P>
<P>
The volunteers were also told not to talk to the anti-abortionists. "It's a 
waste of time," said P. J. Webb, who represented the San Fernando Valley 
chapter of NOW at the training session. "They want to divert your attention 
from your goal." 
</P>
<P>
The goal, the training leaders said, is to keep the clinics open and to escort 
women who are seeking services at the clinics through what might well be a 
screaming, shouting, singing gantlet of Operation Rescue protesters. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Liberman, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood in Los Angeles, said 
publicity about Operation Rescue's aggressive tactics -- which include 
brandishing posters of aborted fetuses and calling women seeking abortions 
"fornicators and witches" -- is causing pro-choice activism to surge. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not had this level of participation since the battle over Roe vs. 
Wade," said Liberman, referring to the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision that 
legalized abortion. "Operation Rescue, in that sense, has been a . . . great 
mobilizing tool." 
</P>
<P>
Liberman said more than 900 pro-choice volunteers have been trained since 
December. Organizers hope that hundreds more will be trained today during an 
afternoon "Celebration of Choice" rally at Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The pro-choice groups' plan is to station groups of volunteers at clinics that 
are likely to be targeted, including the Planned Parenthood clinic in Sherman 
Oaks, before the anti-abortion demonstrators show up. The pro-choice groups' 
leaders believe that their presence at Los Angeles clinics Feb. 11, a warm-up 
for this week's demonstrations, caused Operation Rescue to switch targets at 
the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
But an Operation Rescue spokesman denied that the presence of pro-choice 
volunteers had affected their decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at other rescues that we've had in the state . . . even when there 
have been some pro-death people waiting at the different abortion mills, we 
have still gone and done what we intended to do," said Lawrence Schrank, 
director of Operation Rescue in Santa Clara County who is helping organize the 
Los Angeles demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said that if pro-choice volunteers outnumber Operation Rescue 
activists, then that resolve could crumble. "But, quite frankly, their resolve 
is not as deep as ours, and they don't have the numbers." 
</P>
<P>
Should the Operation Rescue demonstrators try a sit-in, the pro-choice 
volunteers plan to link arms and form at least three lines as a human barricade 
to keep the clinic door open. 
</P>
<P>
Training session leaders demonstrated the technique Saturday, as well as the 
common Operation Rescue tactic of attempting to crawl on the ground between the 
legs of those lined up in front of clinic doors. 
</P>
<P>
The volunteers also learned how to escort a woman into the clinic. Despite the 
training, the pro-choice activists said they would leave if they saw that they 
were severely outnumbered.

HANDYMAN GIVEN LIFE SENTENCE IN WOMAN'S SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A handyman from the desert town of Twentynine Palms has been sentenced to spend 
the rest of his life in prison for shooting a Hawthorne woman. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance Superior Court Judge John P. Shook last week ordered Peter Allan 
Leach, 27, imprisoned for life without the possibility of parole for shooting 
Catherine Stroup to death in April, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Leach and his brother, Paul, were hired by Stroup's 
son-in-law, Michael Seawright, to commit the murder so that Seawright could 
gain sole ownership of S &amp; S Water Co. 
</P>
<P>
Seawright was arrested in the case, but authorities say they do not have enough 
evidence to charge him. He has steadfastly denied involvement in the killing. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Leach's tape-recorded confession was played late last year at his trial, 
but he took the stand at the end of it and recanted the story. Leach said, 
instead, that it was Seawright who pulled the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Leach goes on trial for murder March 31 in Shook's court.

DRIVE-BY SHOOTING KILLS YOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles homicide detectives are investigating a drive-by shooting at a Van 
Nuys street corner Saturday morning that left one teen-ager dead and two others 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Police said a two-door Toyota Corolla carrying five male teen-agers had stopped 
at a traffic light at Sepulveda Boulevard and Sherman Way when another car 
drove up and its occupants began shooting. The car then sped away. 
</P>
<P>
The shots killed Roberto Sanchez, 18, of Van Nuys and wounded two others. The 
driver of the Toyota drove to nearby Valley Presbyterian Hospital, where 
Sanchez was declared dead. 
</P>
<P>
A hospital spokeswoman said Lorenzo Perez, 17, was operated on for multiple 
gunshot wounds. He remained in intensive care Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Another victim, Walter Quintanilla, 17, was transferred to Los Angeles 
County-USC Medical Center. A hospital spokesman said he was treated for minor 
gunshot wounds and released. 
</P>
<P>
The other two passengers were not hurt. Police said they have no suspects in 
the shooting.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: LAUGHTER IS GOOD MEDICINE AT THE WELLNESS COMMUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
"I've got one," said Mary Ann Simon, piping up from the back of the room where 
about 40 people had gathered for an evening of jokes and laughter in Redondo 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"How many Teamsters does it take to screw in a light bulb?," she asked. 
</P>
<P>
The question was greeted with puzzled looks and silence, broken by a few 
I-don't-knows. 
</P>
<P>
"Seven," Simon said, adding menacingly: "Is that a problem?" 
</P>
<P>
Not content with one light bulb joke, Simon told another, this one about former 
President Ronald Reagan. "How many Reagan Cabinet members does it take to screw 
in a light bulb?," she asked. "None. They like to keep Ronnie in the dark." 
</P>
<P>
Simon's jokes got a lot of laughs, and so did many others -- about undertakers, 
the Pope, President Bush and even proctological surgery -- told over the course 
of two hours. 
</P>
<P>
That wouldn't have been unusual at a party or a comedy club. But the joke 
tellers, gathered at the Wellness Community South Bay Cities, were people with 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"Cancer is no laughing matter, but I can laugh at it," said Simon, a Manhattan 
Beach resident who has undergone a mastectomy and chemotherapy for breast 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
That's exactly what Simon and other cancer patients are doing as growing 
numbers of doctors and therapists discover that joking and laughing can take 
some of the horror out of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"Who has a greater need to stop and laugh than people who face on a daily basis 
a struggle with a serious illness like cancer?" asks Dr. Malin Dollinger, a 
Torrance Memorial Hospital oncologist who also is on the Wellness Community's 
professional advisory board. He said humor releases the anxiety, tension, fear 
and anger that accompany a life-threatening illness. 
</P>
<P>
"It does not even matter if the cancer is active, arrested or cured. The worry 
and the fear are always there and the need for release is always important," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The link between attitude and illness is part of a relatively new scientific 
investigation called psychoneuroimmunology, which focuses on interaction 
between the brain or "mind" and the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors are cautious about claiming that positive thinking, including humor, 
have specific effects on the immune system, although Dollinger said there are 
studies that seem to point in that direction. 
</P>
<P>
However, Dr. Lowell H. Greenberg, a Torrance oncologist who also is on the 
Wellness advisory board, said: "There is no objective evidence that laughter or 
any other type of positive thinking affect the immune system." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said, there is "nothing wrong" with positive thinking. "It 
makes their (cancer patients) lives more meaningful," he said. "They're more 
apt to . . . eat properly, keep up exercise and not get depressed. People who 
retreat, stop eating and get depressed don't do as well." 
</P>
<P>
Wellness Community evenings of "fun and laughter," as the joke sessions are 
called, are held every two or three months for cancer patients and their 
families. Everyone is encouraged to bring a few jokes to tell. 
</P>
<P>
"It's part of our whole positive support concept to improve the quality of 
life," said Marian Mohr, executive director of the Wellness center, which 
offers support programs for cancer patients. The center is patterned after one 
that was opened in Santa Monica in 1982 by retired attorney Harold H. Benjamin. 
</P>
<P>
Saying she can't see how anyone can handle cancer without a sense of humor, 
Simon said she handled the stress of her breast surgery and reconstruction last 
year by joking about it. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was being reconstructed, I was told there would be fluid and I would 
have to come in and have it drained," she recalled. "Then I would go to the 
plastic surgeon to be pumped up. I asked if I was going to a doctor's office or 
to a service station." 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Ericastilla of Hawthorne, another cancer patient who laughed her way 
through joke night, said she has had ovarian cancer for three years and has 
undergone three operations and much chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
But she calls herself one of the luckier people with cancer because she has 
been free of pain, is able to work and has a family that "never lets me take it 
too seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Not even, she said, when her hair started falling out last year. "That was more 
traumatic to me than having cancer," she said. "I finally shaved my head and my 
family started rubbing it for luck, making a big joke out of something that was 
really traumatic. They laughed at me and with me and it was a real help." 
</P>
<P>
Center director Mohr, whose own cancer first introduced her to the Wellness 
Community as a patient in Santa Monica, battled the disease for three years. 
"It was a rough period for me and I needed to relax," she said. In the 
hospital, she started telling jokes. "That put me in touch with the power of 
humor in relaxing and helping me get through it." 
</P>
<P>
When she went in for breast reconstruction in 1983 after a double mastectomy, 
Mohr recalled, she concealed a note beneath her hospital gown for her doctor to 
find when he started surgery. It said, "Good morning," and offered good luck 
for a successful operation "so I would be ready for my debut at the local 
topless bar." 
</P>
<P>
She said her husband told her that "the physician had a smile on his face and 
the whole room was laughing." 
</P>
<P>
Professional humorist Bob Hunter, a guest speaker at joke night, said that when 
you make someone laugh by telling them a joke, "you give them a gift." Among 
other things, he said, laughter reduces aggressiveness, increases tolerance, 
improves communication and "burns more calories than coughing, crying or sex." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter said one of the greatest problems people have in telling jokes is 
believing that they're no good at it. To overcome that attitude, he said, "Just 
tell yourself over and over, 'I am a good joke teller'," Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
Before a willing audience like the people at Wellness, even a blown joke gets 
laughs. Toward the end of a rather long story, Clarence Fox of Torrance 
suddenly lapsed into a puzzled silence, shook his head in confusion and said, 
"Oh, I forgot the punch line . . . But I'll think of it." 
</P>

BLACK FAMILY TRADITION; 
</P>
<P>
VAL VERDE TO RESURRECT EASTER SUNRISE SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For half a century of Easters, hundreds of black families from all over Los 
Angeles gathered on a hilltop in far-off Val Verde before dawn. There, seated 
on benches before a giant white cross, they watched the sun rise, sang hymns 
and celebrated the Resurrection of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
After the service, they walked down a dirt trail to the town park where a 
community breakfast awaited them. The aroma of pancakes and bacon filled the 
air. The tiny Santa Clarita Valley town, long known as a vacation resort for 
blacks, swelled with worshipers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Services Stopped 
</P>
<P>
The services stopped in the late 1970s as people lost interest in the 
tradition. But next Sunday, the Val Verde Civic Assn. is reviving the Easter 
sunrise service to bolster civic pride and celebrate part of the rural town's 
heritage. 
</P>
<P>
"This program is pretty similar to what they had in the past," said Edwin 
Brown, civic association president. The 6 a.m. service will be 
nondenominational and will include music. 
</P>
<P>
Worshipers will meet in Val Verde Park, about three miles north of California 
126 and two miles west of Castaic Junction, and walk up a trail that was 
cleared and refurbished for the event. A pancake breakfast will follow the 
service. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Val Verde's sunrise service attracted worshipers of many races. 
But initially, the services symbolized the role the town played in Southern 
California's black community. 
</P>
<P>
"It goes back to the reason we came to Val Verde in the first place," said 
Elijah Canty, 78. "During the 1940s, there weren't too many places where blacks 
were welcome. In Val Verde, we always felt welcome because there was no 
segregation here." 
</P>
<P>
The services started in the 1920s, but Canty first watched the sunrise from the 
Val Verde hilltop in the 1940s. Back then, he said, it took three or four hours 
to drive the winding route from Los Angeles to Val Verde. "It was quite an 
adventure," Canty said. 
</P>
<P>
Most families arrived Friday or Saturday night and packed the few hotels in 
town. Others stayed with friends. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt free to be ourselves," Canty said. 
</P>
<P>
The original event was organized by the park director and local ministers. It 
had gone into decline after vandals desecrated the worship site. 
</P>
<P>
"They came to Val Verde and went to the site of the service and dismantled all 
the benches and threw them down the side of the mountain," Canty said. "That 
was the beginning of the end. I don't remember what year it was." 
</P>
<P>
Apathy also contributed to the demise of the service, Brown said. "It just 
stopped because our community was old and a lot of people moved away. It became 
something that people just forgot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Val Verde is a multiracial community of about 2,300 people. The civic 
association hopes that the service will attract a cross-section of the 
community, as well as out-of-town visitors, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown has lived in Val Verde since 1971, but next Sunday will mark his first 
sunrise service. Even so, he said, he remembers well his first Easter in town. 
He was awakened early that morning by a soft soprano voice that floated down 
the hillside and into the valley. It was the day's soloist. 
</P>
<P>
Brown got up and walked outside to hear the voice. "It was beautiful," he said.

The driver, who officials said had been drinking, apparently lost control of 
the vehicle when he reached down to adjust his radio about 1:30 p.m., the 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The car, which was approaching College View Avenue in Moorpark, skidded across 
both westbound lanes, struck an embankment on the shoulder and rolled several 
times. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, who was not wearing a seat belt, was killed. His identity was not 
released. 
</P>
<P>
The passengers, who also were drinking, were not hurt, the CHP said.

SEPULVEDA JUNIOR HIGH TEAM WINS L.A. SCHOOLS' ACADEMIC PENTATHLON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second time in three years, a team from Sepulveda Junior High School 
has won the Los Angeles Unified School District's Academic Pentathlon 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited for the school and for the kids who have worked so hard," said 
Melodye Wiens, coach of the nine-member Sepulveda team. 
</P>
<P>
The Sepulveda team finished second last year but won in 1987, Wiens said. The 
sixth annual competition was held Feb. 25, but the results were announced on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Four other San Fernando Valley junior highs also scored high among the 80 
schools that competed in essay writing, social studies, math, science and a 
category called "Super Quiz." 
</P>
<P>
Reed Junior High School of North Hollywood finished second; Porter Junior High 
School of Granada Hills was fourth, and Hale Junior High School of Woodland 
Hills was fifth. 
</P>
<P>
The third-place team was from the Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies. 
</P>
<P>
More than 700 students participated in the competition.

AVERAGE PRICE OF HOUSE IN MALIBU NEARING $1 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH J. GARCIA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Never mind the traffic. Ignore the tacky shops. Disregard the occasional 
natural disasters. In three years, the average price of a single-family home in 
Malibu will exceed $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Even today, most people can only afford to visit. Reflecting the escalating 
prices of Westside real estate, the cost of living in Malibu jumped 
dramatically in 1988. The average single-family house in the beachfront 
community cost $678,000 last year, a 37% increase from 1987. 
</P>
<P>
However, that amount probably won't land you a beachfront house. Those 
properties cost an average of $1.62 million, a 20% jump from 1987. The 
skyrocketing prices were reflected in the tiny jump in overall sales volume. 
Only nine more residential properties were sold in 1988 than in the previous 
year, but the transactions totaled $210 million, up from $149 million the 
previous year. 
</P>
<P>
The figures are based on an annual study of property sales in Malibu conducted 
by real estate broker Dick Lowe, who has been tracking housing sales in the 
coastal community for 11 years. Lowe compiled statistics from other brokers in 
the area, then checked them against Malibu real estate sales recorded by Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, I don't think it's going to get any cheaper," said Lowe, 
principal broker at Malibu Country Realty. "It's no different than it has been 
in the past. It's just becoming increasingly difficult for people to find a 
home in the $400,000 range." 
</P>
<P>
Lowe said that although the figures are startling, the sales prices reflect 
escalating home costs throughout the county, particularly in the affluent 
Westside. In fact, the only Malibu real estate that took a dive was commercial 
property -- sales dipped about $3 million to a total of $18 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The study found the biggest gain in the purchases of undeveloped land. A total 
of 258 undeveloped properties were sold last year, compared to 114 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"The increase in the unimproved land sales shows the interest people have in 
finding something here before there's nothing left," Lowe said. "The amount of 
usable land is becoming more and more scarce. The reason people come out here 
is for the open feeling, the open space and the overall country atmosphere. 
Today, it just costs a lot more to purchase it." 
</P>
<P>
Even condominium and mobile- home sales continued to rise, from an average of 
$187,000 in 1987 to $235,000 last year, a 25% jump. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
10% Increase 
</P>
<P>
At the rate Malibu real estate is climbing, Lowe estimates that in three years, 
with a modest 10% annual sales increase, the average single-family home by land 
or by sea will cost a minimum of $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
According to a recent check of the multiple listings used by real estate 
brokers, a buyer could still purchase a home on Las Tunas Beach for $700,000 -- 
a small two-bedroom with 1 1/2 bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
For $679,000, the average price for single-family homes in the area, a buyer 
could get a three-bedroom home on six-tenths of an acre above Zuma Beach. It 
doesn't include two full bathrooms, but it does promise an ocean view.

AS COLD WAR FADES, SO DOES JOHN BIRCH SOCIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WARD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In outward appearance, the John Birch Society's West Coast office on Mission 
Street in San Marino isn't much different from the chiropractic clinic next 
door or the legal and financial offices down the street. Except, that is, for a 
large world map in the window that shows the battle lines in the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
There are three categories of nations in the Birch view of the communist 
advance: those under communist control, those still free of communist 
domination and those in which the communist influence has reached 65% or more, 
a group that includes Sweden, Spain, Mexico and large chunks of Africa and 
South America. 
</P>
<P>
Conditions may have changed since the map was drawn in 1984, said Jim Toft, who 
manages the San Marino office, but the anti-communists' position has not 
improved. These days, he complained, "it's chic to be pro-Soviet. We're being 
lulled to sleep by glasnost." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strategic Retreat 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it is the John Birch Society that is in strategic retreat, planning to 
close its headquarters in Belmont, Mass., and its San Marino branch this summer 
and consolidate operations in a new office in Appleton, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
John McManus, national public relations director, said a national and regional 
staff of 50 will be trimmed to 30. Only three of the eight employees in San 
Marino will be moving to Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
Not many people come by the San Marino office these days, although dealing with 
the public has never been a vital function. A regional office was established 
here 25 years ago because office space was available from a member. The office 
has moved twice, both times to buildings owned by members. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the work involves serving chapters in 13 Western states, maintaining 
membership rolls and research files, and filling requests for society 
publications. A bookstore is maintained in front, Toft said, for the 
convenience of local members, although the curious occasionally wander in. 
</P>
<P>
Char Gonzalez, a black woman who sits at the receptionist desk, said people are 
sometimes shocked to see her there because they are under the mistaken 
impression that the John Birch Society is racist. 
</P>
<P>
"Back in the '60s, a lot of articles printed in the newspapers were 
unfavorable," she said. "I think it was probably a communist sympathizer doing 
all the printing. . . ." Books and pamphlets defending Sen. Joseph McCarthy are 
on display in the bookstore that occupies the lobby. Visitors also can find 
everything from McGuffey's Readers to books on homosexual influences on 
society. The political books range from the Federalist Papers to "Teddy Bare," 
subtitled "The Real Story of Chappaquiddick." 
</P>
<P>
Toft said a number of society members have expressed interest in maintaining a 
bookstore after the San Marino office is closed. Otherwise, he said, customers 
would have to travel to the group's bookstores in Downey or North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Although the closing of the office will be a loss to local members, Toft said, 
the move will improve the organization. "It's the old business axiom of 
reducing the overhead and putting it into the product," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McManus said the Reagan years were tough on the John Birch Society. Although 
membership increased last year, he said, it declined during most of the 
Administration of President Reagan, apparently because some people thought that 
a strong conservative in the White House made the work of the John Birch 
Society less important. McManus said the society told its members that Reagan's 
"rhetoric would not be matched by his deeds," but it took a while for people to 
see that. 
</P>
<P>
McManus said the society does not disclose membership figures, but he said the 
total is in "the tens of thousands." He emphasized that the John Birch Society 
is not cutting its services to members or reducing its staff of about 40 field 
workers, who organize volunteers and serve chapters across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"We envision that when all the dust settles and we get things humming in 
Appleton, we will have a more efficient organization and there will be 
additional programs and additional field staff," said Toft, who is moving to 
Wisconsin. "And with field staff comes new membership." 
</P>
<P>
McManus said the society is moving to Appleton because it wants to be near the 
middle of the country and as a convenience to its new chief executive officer, 
G. Allen Bubolz, who runs insurance, investment and real estate companies in 
Appleton. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Birch Society has a large following in Southern California, Toft 
said the group is strongest in rural states such as Idaho. "There's a theory," 
he said, "that out in a small town, there's not a lot of things to do, so why 
not go to a Birch meeting?" 
</P>
<P>
It is more difficult, he said, to get and hold attention in urban areas. "We 
run into people all the time who say, 'I didn't know you were still around,' " 
Toft said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1958 
</P>
<P>
The John Birch Society was founded by retired businessman Robert Welch in 1958 
to combat communism. It was named after Army Capt. John Birch, who was killed 
in 1945 by Chinese Communists and is considered by the society to be the first 
martyr of the Cold War. The society called for the impeachment of Chief Justice 
Earl Warren and for U.S. withdrawal from the United Nations, and it claimed 
that communist influence was at work at the top levels of government. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas G. Gow, who is moving from California to become chief administrative 
officer at the new headquarters in Wisconsin, said a belief in a high-level 
conspiracy separates the Birch Society from other groups. 
</P>
<P>
"Our discussion that things are not just happening by chance but are 
manipulated by people who have planned them certainly separates us from some of 
the other conservatives," Gow said. "The idea of a conspiracy is not an article 
of faith with us but a conviction based on a lot of research and evidence." 
</P>
<P>
More than 30 years after the death of McCarthy and long after McCarthyism has 
entered dictionaries as a term for indiscriminate, unfounded accusations, the 
Birch Society continues to label McCarthy hero and to defend his work. 
</P>
<P>
Toft said McCarthy was stopped because "he was digging, and he was right on the 
verge of unearthing some elements of the conspiracy. It got to the point where 
he represented a major threat." 
</P>
<P>
Toft said the move to Appleton could generate fresh interest in the society. 
Already, he said, he has heard stories that opponents are claiming that society 
members are moving to Appleton so they can hold seances on the grave of 
McCarthy, who is buried there. 
</P>
<P>
McManus said it is ironic that the John Birch Society had its largest 
membership in the 1960s, when it was under the strongest attack. He said that 
since the mid-1960s, the society has "had no real national attention," apart 
from a few news stories when its chairman was killed in the Soviet downing of a 
Korean airliner in 1983 and when its founder died in 1985. McManus said that it 
is almost as if someone decided more than 20 years ago that the best way to 
hurt the John Birch Society would be to ignore it.

MIKE DOWNEY: GOOD OLD BULLY BO IS AT IT AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Downey 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Texas A&amp;M made a move on University of Michigan football Coach Bo 
Schembechler a few years back, offering him a whole bunch of money. Bo said no. 
</P>
<P>
But first, he thought it over. He considered what was best for himself and for 
his family. Michigan sweetened Schembechler's pot to help him make up his mind, 
and the owner of the Detroit Tigers even forked over the deed to a pizza 
franchise in, of all places, Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Had Schembechler left, it wouldn't have been the first time a coach ever 
abandoned a university for a better offer. Were that not true, Schembechler 
would still be coaching Miami of Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Frieder found himself in a delicate situation last week. Arizona State 
wanted a new basketball coach -- and wanted him now. ASU officials offered the 
job to the Michigan coach but said they needed his answer immediately. Now or 
never. 
</P>
<P>
Frieder said now. 
</P>
<P>
He expected to hop right back on a jet and return to his Michigan team, which 
had an appointment to play Xavier a couple of days later in the first round of 
the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. tournament. Frieder's Wolverines were 
given, by some, a shot at winning the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
The self-righteous Schembechler promptly decided that if they were to take the 
championship, they would have to take it without Frieder. From his seat as 
athletic director, Schembechler stripped Frieder of his command, like 
Eisenhower taking the Third Army away from Patton. 
</P>
<P>
"A Michigan man is going to coach Michigan," decreed Gen. Schembechler, who put 
assistant coach Steve Fisher in charge for postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler has had heart problems in recent years, and now you can see why. 
It's hard for doctors to find. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler says he wants "a Michigan man" to coach Michigan. Bill Frieder 
attended the University of Michigan, which is more than Bo Schembechler can 
say. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler presumably wants his adopted school's basketball squad to have the 
best possible shot at the national championship, because such shots do not come 
along very often. Then he refuses to allow the team's head coach to run the 
team in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler insinuates that Frieder deserted or even betrayed his basketball 
players. Michigan has those basketball players because Frieder is the kind of 
guy who goes recruiting night and day, day and night, until these kids see more 
of him than they do of their relatives. 
</P>
<P>
The least Schembechler might have done is consider the players' feelings. He 
should have asked them if they felt seduced and abandoned. He would have gotten 
responses like the one from Loy Vaught, who said that Frieder did not get a 
fair shake. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to public opinion, college basketball players can think. And most of 
them know that Frieder was not exactly slapping them across the face by leaving 
for what he believed to be a better job. They respected the right of an 
individual to choose a new life for himself -- geographically, economically, 
whatever. 
</P>
<P>
If you follow Schembechler's reasoning, Frieder should have risked losing a 
position that appealed greatly to him by demanding that his new employers make 
their decision when he wanted it made. 
</P>
<P>
See, that's how Schembechler thinks, because this is a man to whom no one ever 
talks back. Schembechler is a professional bully. Nobody can tell him what to 
do, and everybody must do what he says. He is entrenched. He is popular on 
campus and off -- as popular as Frieder was not -- because being victorious on 
the field makes him appear both formidable and indispensable. 
</P>
<P>
Our favorite Schembechler-related moment occurred after the coach had ordered 
his football players to stop talking to the press. One day, running back Butch 
Woolfolk granted an interview but first was asked if it might get him into 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey," Woolfolk said, "I'm not 8 years old. Nobody tells me when and where I 
can talk." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Frieder gave his heart and soul to his basketball players. While other Big 
Ten schools labored to land quality athletes, Frieder lassoed them into Ann 
Arbor, provided Michigan audiences with winning records, first-division 
finishes and regular tournament appearances. 
</P>
<P>
As a reward, some of Michigan's own fans this season jeered him and unfurled 
crude, cruel banners insulting him. Do you know what Michigan's home record 
under Frieder was? Ninety-four victories and 10 defeats. 
</P>
<P>
Some flop this guy was. 
</P>
<P>
Those very Michigan followers who abused and criticized him probably are among 
those today who are knocking him for not demonstrating to them any loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
Frieder is taking most of the heat in his home state this week, and probably 
would have gotten the blame if Xavier had defeated Michigan Friday, even though 
the coach had to purchase a ticket just to get into the gym. 
</P>
<P>
We will continue to wish Michigan well in its endeavors, including interim 
coach Steve Fisher, a swell fellow who we happen to have known for more than 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
What amuses us most is the scuttlebutt that Bo Schembechler intends to -- in 
his own words -- "seek the greatest basketball coach in America to coach this 
team," including a call on Indiana's Bob Knight for recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
We have this adorable scenario in mind in which the greatest coach in America 
leaves his current university for Ann Arbor, whereupon Schembechler tries to 
explain to the coach's former employers that business is strictly business.

SOME CLAIM THEY HAVE SEEN A DIFFERENCE IN BEHAVIOR OF INDIANA COACH THIS SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY COTTON, Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Barely two hours after a heartbreaking 70-67 loss to Big Ten Conference rival 
Illinois, the Indiana Hoosiers are huddled in their locker room at Assembly 
Hall, reviewing what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
The word soon spreads: the team is going to hold a full practice session, 
complete with scrimmage. This prompts the recounting of a tale from two years 
ago when, after a two-point loss at Illinois that ended with Indiana guard 
Steve Alford missing badly on a last-second shot, the Hoosiers returned home 
and practiced more than two hours almost exclusively on that very situation. 
</P>
<P>
The drill, it is said, was repeated for a full week of practice, and, of 
course, a month later the Hoosiers won the national championship when Keith 
Smart sank a shot in the waning stages of the title game against Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
That the practice story is apocryphal ("It didn't happen,") said Coach Bob 
Knight. "We practiced on it at the workout the next day -- that was it, 
period." It doesn't matter. Legends are made of such things, and should Indiana 
go on to win this season's NCAA championship, there's no telling how much 
Sunday's episode will grow in the retelling. 
</P>
<P>
For the Hoosiers faithful, this season already is close to being the stuff of 
fantasies. Picked in pre-season to finish fourth or fifth in the Big Ten, 
Indiana didn't look even that good after starting 3-4 and giving up more than 
100 points to Syracuse, North Carolina and Louisville. Since then, however, 
Knight's team has won 22 of 25 games. 
</P>
<P>
If the Hoosiers win the conference crown, Indiana probably will be seeded No. 1 
in one of the four NCAA regions. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for a team whose coach isn't sure it is nationally competitive. "By 
that I mean that you could go out and play a series of games against people 
that are nationally competitive," Knight said. "I don't know that we could do 
that. I think that we apparently have shown over the last several games that we 
can play in given circumstances with a lot of pretty good teams but I'm not 
sure if we could play four or five good teams in a row." 
</P>
<P>
After the near-disastrous start, Knight changed his starting lineup, benching 
larger players and moving to a three-guard unit of senior Joe Hillman, Jay 
Edwards and Lyndon Jones -- both sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
Hillman, who almost passed up this season to concentrate on a professional 
baseball career, is 6-2, which means he's outsized by most of the natural 
forwards he defends. The same could be said of the other two starters, Todd 
Jadlow and freshman Eric Anderson, both 6-9. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Indiana has thrived. Turnovers, the biggest early-season problem, 
have been sharply reduced with the guard-oriented quintet. And the tenets of 
Knight basketball -- helping man-to-man defense and a patient, cutting offense 
-- have come to the fore. 
</P>
<P>
"I think coach really likes this team, teaching them and watching them grow. 
He's been into it and they've really responded to it," assistant coach Joby 
Wright said. "It's a very neat team to be around. They understand what they 
have to do to be successful and they're willing to listen and learn." 
</P>
<P>
It has been widely suggested that Indiana's success this season and Knight's 
marriage lastspring to Karen Edgar, a former high-school girls basketball coach 
from Oklahoma, have combined to make the coach more mellow. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe he thinks if he lightens up with them he'll get more out of them but 
he's been like a teddy bear this year," Illinois forward Nick Anderson said. 
"Last year, I never saw a coach like him. Maybe he's getting too old now, maybe 
he can't take it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
It's said that further evidence can be found in the fact that Edwards, who was 
briefly suspended from the team his freshman year and then failed a school drug 
test last summer, was allowed to continue playing by Knight, a longtime 
hardliner on the subject of drugs. Then came the news that Lawrence 
Funderburke, a talented Ohio high-school player who was suspended five games 
into his senior season, was still being granted an athletic scholarship to play 
for Indiana next season. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps the biggest shock came last weekend, when it was revealed that 
Knight not only attended a high-school game with Illini Coach Lou Henson but 
wasn't upset that his son, Pat, was being recruited by Illinois. That 
reportedly was the focal point of Knight's earlier complaints to the conference 
offices regarding irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
"Henson and I have been good friends since he got in the Big Ten," Knight said. 
"But Neale Stoner (former Illinois athletic director) I had absolutely no use 
for whatsoever. Henson and I never had a problem, but I had great problems with 
how his athletic director went about handling intercollegiate athletics." 
</P>
<P>
Knight explains away the other supposed evidence of his softening. "With 
Edwards, I think you make a real mistake if you think that no one can make a 
mistake," he said. "I think the kid makes a real mistake if he thinks he can 
make the mistake again. I don't have a problem letting him play but if there 
were another test and a failure, it would be a real problem. He'd have no 
chance then. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe Funderburke's problems aren't all his doing. . . . I like the kid, where 
he's coming from, what he's about. He comes from a terrible background but if a 
kid can come from that and do what he's done academically, then there's 
something there that's really worth working with." 
</P>
<P>
It has been said that time heals all wounds. And with the passage of time, some 
athletes, such as Lakers center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, come to an accommodation 
with, if not acceptance of, the media. Perhaps such a time will come for 
Knight, but not yet. The closest Knight will come to a reconciliation with the 
fourth estate is saying that at one time reporters irritated him, but now he's 
merely amused by them. He was clearly not amused by the best-selling book, "A 
Season on the Brink," by former Washington Post reporter John Feinstein. The 
book drew Knight's ire and brought even more attention to him when published 
two years ago. He never specifically mentioned it in an interview this week. 
</P>
<P>
"You want me to list all the things that I've read about me that are absolutely 
untrue?" he asks. "Well, no, I don't have time to do that. . . . I read this 
stuff that I've mellowed this year. Hey, nobody knows better than I do and I 
say, what didn't I do before? What did I do before that makes me different than 
now? I don't feel any different. I don't think I'm any different." 
</P>
<P>
Knight portrays himself as perhaps the most misunderstood man in the world, or 
at least in the NCAA. He says all the incidents that have placed him in the 
spotlight -- tossing a chair across the court against Purdue, taking his team 
off the floor in an exhibition game against a team from the Soviet Union, the 
trouble in Puerto Rico during the Pan Am Games, a comment about rape during a 
television interview with NBC's Connie Chung -- either were taken out of 
context or are things that any other coach might have done. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it's not just any coach who has won 500-plus games, three NCAA 
titles and an Olympic gold medal. But Knight says he fails to see why more 
attention is paid to him than the average coach. 
</P>
<P>
"What difference does it make who it is? How many coaches have kicked chairs, 
thrown chairs, thrown jackets?" he said. "Why is it me? If I threw 500 chairs 
in 900 games that would be one thing but I've thrown one and now I'm the 
chair-thrower. . . . It seems to me that pounding on a table pales in 
significance to 97% of our players graduating. How many stories are written, 
not about academics, where somewhere there's a line that says, 'By the way, 
Coach Jones has graduated only 20% of his players in the last 10 years?' You'll 
never see it, but to me, that should be the same as sticking in a line that 
says I threw a chair."

ARIZONA WINS OVER CLEMSON IN VICTORY 
</P>

<P>
By the reckoning of Clemson Coach Cliff Ellis, a season in the Atlantic Coast 
Conference was preparation aplenty for the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Could there be anything on the road to the Final Four that the Tigers hadn't 
seen along Tobacco Road this season? Politely begging your pardon, Ellis and 
his players doubted it. 
</P>
<P>
They had seen Duke and North Carolina and N.C. State. They had beaten Duke and 
North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
And they met Arizona Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
After a 94-68 Arizona victory before a crowd of 12,428 in the second round of 
the NCAA West Regional at the Boise State Pavilion, they were about ready to 
grant the Wildcats admission to the ACC, travel arrangements be darned. 
</P>
<P>
"That," Ellis said pointedly, "is a great basketball team." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, admitted Tiger center Elden Campbell, "they would fit in real well in the 
league." 
</P>
<P>
Clemson (19-11) stayed with top-seeded and top-ranked Arizona (29-3) for 10 
minutes, last leading at 25-23. 
</P>
<P>
Then came a Wildcat strike. Arizona would score the next 15 points. And Clemson 
would go 9 minutes 22 seconds without a basket, committing 12 turnovers along 
the way -- including 10 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Before Derrick Forest broke Clemson's drought with two free throws with 1:49 
left in the half, Arizona had a 39-25 lead. 
</P>
<P>
That held up, meaning that Arizona was going to Denver for a West Regional 
semifinal game against Nevada Las Vegas Thursday, and Clemson was going back to 
South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
"I just like that team," Ellis said, still shaking his head. "I don't see any 
reason they can't win it all." 
</P>
<P>
He stopped short of calling Arizona the best team he has seen all season -- 
that kind of quote would be a yellowed clipping on ACC bulletin boards next 
season -- but termed the game "the best performance" he has seen. 
</P>
<P>
"Their pressure surprised me," he said. "Their defense is the whole key to it." 
</P>
<P>
Clemson's plan against Arizona centered on its own defense. The idea was to 
keep close tabs on Sean Elliott and Anthony Cook with a box-and-one or a 
triangle-and-two. 
</P>
<P>
"The role players -- we were going to make them beat us," Ellis said. "Well, 
they did a pretty good job." 
</P>
<P>
Matt Muehlebach, at the request of Elliott and Coach Lute Olson, started 
shooting from outside to force Clemson to play a less fudging defense. He ended 
up with a career-high 19 points, including four three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
Two of them came in the game's only crucial moments after the first 10 minutes. 
Early in the second half, Clemson cut the lead to four points after two 
three-pointers by Forrest and a dunk by Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
Muehlebach lined up and knocked down back-to-back three-pointers, pushing the 
lead back to 10. It was never single digits again. 
</P>
<P>
"What everybody calls their role players are darn good players," Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
Jud Buechler, the other "role player" scored 15 points. Cook scored 14. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott, special defense and all, had 25 points. "A quiet 25," Ellis called it. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing by nine at halftime, Clemson thought it could come back. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt comfortable," Ellis said. "We've been in that position a lot. Arizona 
simply did not let up. I want to say this. I am overly impressed with that 
basketball team." 
</P>
<P>
Olson did not argue. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime we go in up at the half, we feel confident," he said. "As long as we 
play hard defensively, I don't worry. We're an offensively explosive enough 
team." 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, Arizona kept Campbell reasonably contained. He had 24 points, but 
15 came in the second half when the issue already had been decided. 
</P>
<P>
Forrest scored 21. 
</P>
<P>
The crucial defensive effort belonged to Buechler, who helped hold Dale Davis 
to two points, 12 below his average. 
</P>
<P>
The game over, Ellis reconsidered the question he had pondered since winning 
the first-round game Thursday: How to beat Arizona? 
</P>
<P>
"That's a good question," he said. "They run extremely well, and you have to 
get back on transition defense. You have to help out on Elliott. But when you 
do, you have to recover on the other guys. Their inside game is awesome and 
they can hit from the outside."

Sean Elliott scored 25 points, and top-ranked Arizona held Clemson scoreless 
for more than nine minutes Saturday to beat the Tigers, 94-68, and advance to 
the semifinals of the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. West Regional. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats (29-3) led by 14 in the first half and withstood a Clemson rally 
in the opening minutes of the second before pulling away to their 11th straight 
victory and fourth straight blowout. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona plays No. 15 Nevada-Las Vegas Thursday night in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Muehlebach scored 19 for Arizona, including four three-pointers. His two 
three-point baskets helped lift the Wildcats out of trouble after Clemson cut 
the lead to four early in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson (19-11) went 9 minutes 22 seconds without scoring in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers led, 25-23, on Ricky Jones' 19-foot jumper with 10:11 to play in the 
first half. Arizona, despite a sputtering offense of its own, scored the next 
16 points to take a 39-25 lead on Muehlebach's steal and layup with 4:39 to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers finally scored when Derrick Forrest sank a pair of free throws with 
1:49 left in the half. Clemson committed 13 turnovers during the 16-0 Arizona 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
After trailing by nine at halftime, the Tigers came out strong. 
</P>
<P>
A pair of three-pointers by Forrest and a dunk by Eldon Campbell pulled Clemson 
within 49-45 with 16:06 to play. But Muuehlebach hit two three-pointers and 
Elliott scored on a drive to boost the lead back to 57-45 and the Tigers never 
came closer than 10 again. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats' biggest lead was the final margin. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell scored 24 and Forrest 21 for the Tigers, the sixth-place finisher in 
the Atlantic Coast Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Jud Buechler added 15 points and Anthony Cook 14 for Arizona.

CRENSHAW GETS PAST OAKLAND SKYLINE, 70-63

<P>
Crenshaw High School's boys' basketball team, noted for its scoring ability, 
went to a spread offense in the fourth quarter Saturday night and escaped with 
a 70-63 victory over Oakland Skyline before 14,622 in the State Division I 
championship game at the Oakland Coliseum Arena. 
</P>
<P>
With the victory, the Southern California representative has won eight 
consecutive State championships. It is Crenshaw's fourth title. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars took a 63-48 lead into the fourth quarter, but then Skyline, noted 
for its late-game heroics, rallied, outscoring Crenshaw, 15-7, before falling 
short. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to use the delay twice this year," Crenshaw Coach Willie West said. "We 
practice it all the time because we know we have to use it." 
</P>
<P>
Skyline Coach Don Lippi said: "We had some key people getting tired at the end; 
they started making poor passes. I never thought we were too far down where we 
couldn't come back. We were fresh in the fourth quarter, but they have a lot of 
good players, and to their credit, they wore us down." 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, the Cougars were their own worst enemy, missing three 
consecutive free throws to leave the door open for the Titans. 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw (25-2) started the game cold, allowing Skyline (25-6) to run to a 13-4 
lead with 3:55 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Rahim Harris, Skyline's 6-foot 4-inch junior forward, was the Titans' main 
offensive force as he scored their first seven points. 
</P>
<P>
Skyline's pressure defense caused early problems for the Cougars, as they 
committed seven turnovers in the first quarter. Crenshaw finished with 22 
turnovers, and Skyline had 27. 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw started to settle down with 3:00 left in the quarter, when senior 
Terry Cannon connected on a three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars cut the Titan lead to one as the first quarter ended, with an 
unexpected lift from sophomore guard Kevin Ollie, who ignited a five-point late 
Cougar rally. Skyline led after the first quarter, 16-15. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the shots and we were not concentrating," West said. "Instead of 
getting the ball inside and then working the ball outside, we were taking too 
many outside shots. We corrected that in the second quarter." 
</P>
<P>
The game heated up in the second quarter, with both teams playing full-court 
trapping pressure defense. The Cougars took control early in the period, with 
Cannon, who finished with 13 first-half points, connecting on consecutive 
three-pointers, followed by two inside baskets by Nicholas Bragg, to put 
Crenshaw ahead, 38-24. 
</P>
<P>
After that, forward Cornelius Banks took over, scoring 11 points in the 
quarter. His inside play helped stretch the Cougar lead to 47-30 late in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
Skyline was able to stay close only behind the play of Harris, who finished 
with 19 first-half points. 
</P>
<P>
Cannon again got the Cougars' offense rolling with three quick third-quarter 
baskets. 
</P>
<P>
Cannon led Crenshaw with 21 points, and Banks had 13. Harris led Skyline with 
29 points. Kevin Washington added 22.

NOAH AND MECIR FIND THEIR WAY TO FINAL

<P>
Two weeks ago, Yannick Noah was on a boat in Guadalupe. Since then, he has been 
to Disneyland, played golf, gone swimming and sat in a steaming sauna with his 
girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
What is this, Club Med? He needs an itinerary, not a trainer. 
</P>
<P>
Or has Noah somehow stumbled upon just the right way to get into the final of a 
tennis tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"It means that everybody who wants to get ready for a tournament should go on a 
boat," Noah said. "That's a good preparation, I think." 
</P>
<P>
The final of the Newsweek Champions Cup is today at Hyatt Grand Champions. 
Better prepare yourself. 
</P>
<P>
In the best-of-five-sets final, Noah meets Miloslav Mecir, who apparently had 
his own method of getting ready for this event. 
</P>
<P>
After reaching the final of the Australian Open, Mecir wanted a vacation. He 
got one quite unexpectedly, when he lost in the first round in consecutive 
tournaments, so he took two weeks off and played with his 14-month-old son, 
Milos. 
</P>
<P>
Mecir would like his son to be an athlete. If he becomes a tennis player, he'd 
be fortunate to hit tennis balls like his father. 
</P>
<P>
On a sunny Saturday afternoon, Mecir kept his feet on the ground to pound a 
series of groundstrokes at Jimmy Connors and emerge with a 6-2, 6-4 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Noah became airborne in his match against Jay Berger. With hang time 
that a punter would envy, Noah punctuated his 6-3, 6-4 victory with two flying 
overhead smashes that drew gasps from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Noah said he thinks he understands such reactions. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks good because my hair is staying in the air," he said. "I'm already 
down and my hair is still up." 
</P>
<P>
Even after he lost to Mecir, Connors was not down. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not gonna go home, sink my head in the Jacuzzi and drown myself," Connors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A three-time champion of this event, Connors started slowly and finished fast, 
but not fast enough. Connors said his spirit was willing but his feet were 
weak. They just couldn't get him where he wanted to go soon enough. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, Connors' lips were moving. Down, 0-4, in the second set, someone in 
the stands shouted at him. 
</P>
<P>
"Come on, Jimbo." 
</P>
<P>
Said Connors: "OK, where are we going?" 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Connors, he was on his way to defeat. Mecir, who warmed up 
for Connors by hitting a few balls with wife Petra, must have learned 
something. 
</P>
<P>
Mecir, who had broken Connors in the first game of the match, was about to be 
broken back in the fourth game when Connors held three break points. 
</P>
<P>
But Mecir would have none of it. Two service winners and a nimbly placed volley 
brought the game to deuce. Mecir served an ace and then watched as Connors 
waved a forehand into the net on game point. 
</P>
<P>
"That gave me a lot of confidence," Mecir said. 
</P>
<P>
Connors would see for himself whether Mecir's confidence was brimming, but not 
until he had lost the first set and was down, 5-1, in the second. 
</P>
<P>
Mecir had Connors down a match point at 5-2, but he could not cash it in. 
Connors sent Mecir into the corner with a backhand and then hit a forehand 
volley into the open court. 
</P>
<P>
"After I started to win, I knew he was going to be fighting anyway," Mecir 
said. 
</P>
<P>
With a chance to serve out the match, Mecir did just that and put himself in 
position to win his first singles tournament in two years. Connors wished he 
had found momentum a little earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't give him a chance to clutch in, to think about it, yeah, to gag," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Connors was missing only by inches, it was just enough to cost him 
against a player such as Mecir, whose seemingly effortless style from the 
baseline or the net may detract from his well-paced, if not spectacular, game. 
</P>
<P>
Berger's unexpected run to the semifinals ended at the short end of Noah's 
volleys. Faced with the relentless pressure of an attacking Noah, Berger wasn't 
particularly disturbed that he could not pull out the same number of winners on 
passing shots that he had against Boris Becker and Brad Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm hitting great shots and the other guy is hitting better shots, what can 
I do, applaud?" Berger asked. 
</P>
<P>
Noah broke to 3-1 in the first set after Berger led, 40-15. But after a rapid 
exchange of volleys at break point, Noah put one out of Berger's reach. 
</P>
<P>
The rest seemed fairly routine for Noah, who nearly withdrew from the 
tournament last week because of sore knees. 
</P>
<P>
They aren't hurting anymore, said Noah, and that makes him glad. And when he's 
pleased, that can mean only one thing. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to play when I am happy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
Ken Flach, doubles partner of Robert Seguso, said that Seguso apologized for 
being defaulted, which also took them out of the doubles in the quarterfinals. 
"What else could he say?" Flach said. "He said he was sorry." Because Seguso 
was defaulted in singles, he was also ineligible to play doubles, which means 
that Flach-Seguso missed a chance at the $27,540 for winning the Newsweek 
Champions Cup doubles. "I think we could have won it," Flach said. But that 
isn't Flach's biggest disappointment. "I don't feel good getting quarterfinal 
points," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Boris Becker and Jakob Hlasek will play Kevin Curren and David Pate in the 
doubles final. Becker and Hlasek defeated Danie Visser and Pieter Aldrich, 7-6, 
7-5, in one semifinal. Curren and Pate defeated Stefan Edberg and Jim Grabb, 
7-5, 3-6, 6-1.

Michael Nunn feeds off it.

"I consider myself like Michael Jackson, on stage," undefeated the

"I don't get any extra money for getting in there and taking shots. All I do is

moves in to finish them off.

"My reach and height allows me to get punches in on guys, dictate the fight, do 
what I want to do. The other guy's gotta worry about what Michael Nunn's 
doing," said 6-foot-1 champ with a reach of 77 inches, a span some six inches 
longer than average for his division. 
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Nunn, who'll defend his IBF title against Sumbu Kalambay of 
Italy next Saturday night at the Las Vegas Hilton on HBO, has knocked out 22 of 
his 32 pro foes, including a ninth-round technical knockout to take the IBF 
title from Frank Tate last July. He then scored an eighth-round knockout of the 
brawling Juan Domingo Roldan in a title defense on Nov. 4. 
</P>
<P>
"People have said I can't punch. Let my opponents be the judge. My opponents 
aren't saying that," Nunn said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Nunn has a perfect record and has moved into the $1 million-per-fight 
class, he has not gained the fame of a Sugar Ray Leonard, whom he figures 
someday to face, nor even a Thomas Hearns. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't worry about Leonard, (Roberto) Duran, Hearns," Nunn said. "I'm just 
going to keep getting in the ring and being successful. . . . People who don't 
know me will know me. The whole world's going to know me." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike some boxers who have led less than exemplary personal lives, Nunn, who 
now lives in North Hollywood, says that he believes responsibility comes with 
fame. 
</P>
<P>
"You're under a microscope," he said. "You've got to conduct yourself properly 
in public. I want to try to be a great role model for children." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Goossen, Nunn's manager, doesn't think Nunn will have any problem being a 
good role model. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a level-headed kid," Goossen said. "The more time I've spent in his 
hometown (Davenport, Iowa), the more I understand the key ingredient to Michael 
is outside the ring. He got an excellent foundation from his mom. I think the 
first thing he thinks is how his mom is going to react to something." 
</P>
<P>
Immediate on Nunn's mind at present, of course, is getting past Kalambay, who 
has a 46-3-1 record with 26 knockouts. Their match was supposed to be for both 
Nunn's IBF title and Kalambay's World Boxing Assn. crown, but the WBA recently 
stripped Kalambay of the title because he is not defending against the WBA's 
No. 1 contender, Herol Graham of England. 
</P>
<P>
"The WBA title would have been nice to have," Nunn said. "But I'm not really 
concerned (about the title being taken away from Kalambay). I don't want to get 
caught up in all the titles. I just want to reach my potential and make money. 
I'll prove I'm the middleweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to be tough; once you're a champion, all your fights are tough. It 
will be an interesting fight . . . but I'm the better man."

CONGRESSIONAL CUP; 
</P>
<P>
DAVIS SHOWS HE CAN WIN WITH THE PRESSURE OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rod Davis was concerned before the anti-climactic windup of the 25th 
Congressional Cup Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, an American sailing for the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron, had 
already clinched an unprecedented third championship in sailing's premier 
match-racing series Friday but wanted to win with a 9-0 flourish, as he had in 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be interesting to see how it goes with the pressure off," he said on the 
way out to the race course. 
</P>
<P>
Davis and his all-New Zealand crew came from behind to defeat a surprisingly 
competitive Makoto Namba of Japan by 1 minute, 11 seconds in his first race, 
then broke away to win a dogfight with two-time Congressional winner Dave Perry 
by 52 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
With Davis as the skipper, New Zealand finished second in last December's World 
Cup of Match Racing and won January's Chinatel Cup that opened the World Cup 
match-racing series of 10 events. Davis will switch positions with tactician 
David Barnes in subsequent events, which are geared toward the next America's 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday they drew Basilea from the fleet of racer-cruiser Catalina 38s. Some 
observers had suspected Basilea, owned by Drs. Heinz and Janice Fischer, was 
not the pride of the fleet, having won one of five races with other crews the 
first two days. 
</P>
<P>
But Basilea had no trouble winning with Australia's Peter Gilmour and Davis, 
who won all four of their races with Basilea the next two days. 
</P>
<P>
The mood is light leaving the bay, Davis and his crew teasing each other. 
Besides Davis and Barnes, there are bowman Alan Smith, jib tailer Don Cowie, 
mastman Dennis Kendall, grinder Grant Loretz and jib trimmer Mark Hauser. 
</P>
<P>
But as they approach the race course, Davis orders, "OK, gentlemen, (raise the) 
mainsail," and six bodies snap into action. 
</P>
<P>
Then, when a gun fires to signal the prestart countdown, the banter stops, and 
the mood turns serious. 
</P>
<P>
With 10 minutes remaining and the wind blowing only 5 knots, Davis and Namba 
steer their boats toward each other from opposite ends of the line to begin the 
tight circling maneuvers that will leave one with an advantage at the start. 
</P>
<P>
Advantage: Namba. 
</P>
<P>
"Won't be able to go this way long, David," Davis says to Barnes as he finds 
himself in Namba's backwind soon after the start. "How much damage is he doing 
us?" 
</P>
<P>
"Good breeze on the right," Barnes says. 
</P>
<P>
Although a note of urgency occasionally creeps into Davis' voice, he never 
yells. He mostly talks in a conversational tone. 
</P>
<P>
Upwind, Loretz and Smith, sitting on the weather rail, offer constant input to 
Davis about wind and wave conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"Stand by," Davis says, alerting the crew he is about to tack. "Here we go." 
</P>
<P>
He turns the wheel slowly and Basilea groans over to port tack. 
</P>
<P>
The duel continues, with Namba leading at the first mark. Downwind under 
spinnaker, Davis trails by three to four boat lengths until near the end of the 
1 1/2-mile run when he starts to close. Soon he is in position to jibe onto 
Namba's wind and quickly pulls alongside. 
</P>
<P>
Then it is just a matter of time until he rolls past the Japanese, rounds the 
leeward mark three lengths in front and continues to stretch his lead to the 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
The mood eases again as the crew awaits its match against Perry, the last of 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
Then: "Jib up," Davis says, and it's all business again. 
</P>
<P>
Perry, a longtime adversary, was the first rival to leave his own boat to 
congratulate Davis after Friday's clinchers, but he isn't conceding anything on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The prestart maneuvering is furious, as Davis and Perry exchange subtle smiles 
for momentary triumphs. At the start Davis has a slight edge and tells Barnes 
he thinks the wind is more favorable on the right side of the course. 
</P>
<P>
They lead Perry by two lengths at the windward mark, and halfway down the leg 
Perry is alongside, only 12 feet away, the boats surfing in 15 knots of wind. 
</P>
<P>
Davis is controlling the inside position for the leeward mark, but Perry yells 
over, "Mast line! Mast line!" -- meaning he has moved just far enough in front 
that Davis no longer has the right of way. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't hit me, Rod," Perry says. 
</P>
<P>
"Just sail a proper course, Dave," Davis replies -- meaning the fastest, but 
not necessarily the most direct, course to the mark. 
</P>
<P>
"I trust you, Rod," Perry says, "but I don't know why." 
</P>
<P>
Davis rounds first and lengthens his lead slightly throughout the race. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional Cup Notes 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Peter Gilmour of Australia won his last five races to finish 
second at 7-2 -- and his last victory over Anaheim's John Bertrand (5-4), 
sailing for the St. Francis Yacht club, was remarkable. The on-the-water judges 
cited Gilmour for two fouls after prestart collisions, so Gilmour had to 
perform two 270-degree penalty turns after the start but still won by 21 
seconds. . . . Japan's Makoto Namba (3-6) defeated Long Beach's John Shadden 
(5-4) by three seconds, the closest finish of the week. "This is the best I've 
seen the Japanese sail," Davis said. . . . San Diego's Peter Isler (6-3) was 
alone in third place. The last-place tie between Connecticut's Bill Lynn and 
Long Beach's Steve Steiner (1-8) was broken by Lynn's win over Steiner on 
Wednesday.

TOURNAMENT PLAYERS CHAMPIONSHIP;

BECK AND KITE TAKE COMMAND AFTER LIETZKE, MCCUMBER FALTER 
</P>

PONTE VEDRA, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For someone who had just missed a tap-in putt of one inch and had four-putted a 
hole, Mark McCumber was relatively calm and upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
His double-bogey five on the par-three 17th hole in the Tournament Players 
Championship at Sawgrass Saturday cost him a chance for the outright lead. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it was left to Chip Beck to take the lead from Bruce Lietzke on 
another warm and somewhat windy afternoon in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Lietzke was breezing along after nine holes with a four-stroke lead, but he 
shot a 41 on the backside to finish with a 74. 
</P>
<P>
His lapse opened the door for Beck and Tom Kite, who took over the top two 
positions on the leader board, setting up a scramble for the championship 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Beck shot a 68 for a three-day total of 207 and the lead at nine under par for 
54 holes, while the steady Kite shot a 68 and was one stroke back at 208. 
</P>
<P>
Five players -- Lietzke, McCumber, Gary Koch, Ben Crenshaw and Fred Couples -- 
were bunched at 209. Greg Norman and Gil Morgan are next at 210. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Nicklaus and Craig Stadler have an outside chance of winning today. Both 
are four strokes behind the leader. 
</P>
<P>
McCumber, the defending champion and the home favorite since he lives in nearby 
Jacksonville, should have been devastated, but he wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
On the 17th, a green completely surrounded by water, McCumber's tee shot 
stopped 25-feet from the pin. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit the hole on my first putt and I thought I had made a two, but it spun 
out five feet past the cup," McCumber said. "It looked as if I was going to be 
10 under par." 
</P>
<P>
Then, the nightmare began. 
</P>
<P>
McCumber said he just burned the hole on his second putt, the ball sliding an 
inch past. 
</P>
<P>
McCumber reached out with his putter and tapped the ball, but it moved only a 
quarter of an inch. 
</P>
<P>
"I was ready to reach down and take the ball out of the cup," McCumber said. "I 
couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
McCumber said he wasn't frustrated after just barely missing his five-foot 
putt, although it seemed that he made a half-hearted stab at the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I hit it," he said, "but I didn't do it out of anger." 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a tragedy. It was just an unfortunate situation. Overall, I'm 
extremely satisfied with the way I played and I'm looking forward to defending 
my championship tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Since he is only two strokes behind Beck, he has good reason to believe that he 
can put the four-putt green behind him. But will others let him forget it? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm taking my phone off the hook tonight," McCumber said. 
</P>
<P>
McCumber still managed to shoot a two-under-par 70 on a day when the course 
didn't yield many low scores. 
</P>
<P>
Lietzke, the easy-going pro from Dallas who had a two-stroke lead at the outset 
of Saturday's third round, took his faltering back nine in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost my concentration after I three-putted the 10th hole," he said, "Then, I 
tried to coach myself." 
</P>
<P>
That turned out to be a mistake as he got off to a shaky start on the par-five, 
529-yard 11th hole by topping his 3-wood and sending the ball into the water. 
</P>
<P>
Lietzke wound up with a double bogey on the hole. He bogeyed two more holes on 
the backside after getting three birdies on the front nine. 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't missed a putt inside of 10 feet for 2 1/2 rounds, so I felt 
vulnerable again," hesaid. 
</P>
<P>
However, he was philosophical about losing a substantial lead. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have to have a train wreck, Saturday is a good day to do it," he said. 
"There's a lot more golf to play, and I can't let nine holes get in my way." 
</P>
<P>
Beck said he was surprised to be leading, adding, though, that his confidence 
has steadily improved each day. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a great shootout tomorrow, a great championship," said Beck, 
who hasn't made much of an impact on the Tour this year after earning $926,817 
to finish second on the money winning list in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Beck made a bogey at the second hole, but then played steadily the rest of the 
way, collecting five birdies. 
</P>
<P>
Kite, who won last week at Orlando, Fla., in a sudden-death playoff with Davis 
Love III, is in the hunt to become a back-to-back winner, emulating Steve 
Jones, who won the first Tour events of the season, the Tournament of Champions 
and the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic. 
</P>
<P>
As for Nicklaus, he said he is going into today's round with the positive 
attitude of shooting a low score. 
</P>
<P>
"After I got a bogey on the 10th hole, I said I'm going to cost this course 
four birdies," Nicklaus said. 
</P>
<P>
He proceeded to get them with a fine round of 68.

Lori Garbacz came from two strokes back to tie Martha Nause on the 15th hole, 
then birdied Nos. 16 and 18 for a two-stroke lead in the third round of the 
$300,000 Tucson Open women's golf tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Garbacz, seeking her first victory in 12 years, shot a five-under-par 67 for a 
54-hole total of 204. 
</P>
<P>
Nause shot a 71 for a 206 total on the 6,243-yard Randolph North Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Stephenson, 1983 Tucson champion and 1987 runner-up, started the day tied 
with Garbacz and shot a 71 for a total of 208. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Laura Davies, Missie Berteotti and Jody Rosenthal were tied 
at 209. 
</P>
<P>
Davies shot a 70 with four birdies, an eagle, two bogeys and a double bogey. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Henning of South Africa surged from last place with a six-under-par 66 
to tie New Zealand's Bob Charles for the lead at 141 after two rounds of a 
$250,000 seniors tournament at Johannesburg, South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Charles shot a 71. 
</P>
<P>
Next at 142 in the eight-man event was South Africa's Gary Player, who shot a 
72, followed by Dave Hill, who was at 143 after a second-round 69. 
</P>
<P>
Orville Moody, who slipped to a 74 after sharing the first-round lead with 
Charles and Player at 70, was at 144. Lee Elder and Bobby Nichols were tied at 
145. 
</P>
<P>
Australia's Bruce Devlin was last at 146.

Ram wide receiver Michael Young, an unprotected free agent, said he has agreed 
in terms to a contract with the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
Young, 26, who earned $162,000 last season, is expected to sign a two-year deal 
(one year with an option) with the Broncos Monday worth almost $500,000, 
including signing bonus and incentives. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you believe that," Young said, "For me?" 
</P>
<P>
Young, a sixth-round pick of the Rams in 1985, has played sparingly in his 
four-year career. He had only two receptions for 27 yards last season and 
finished it on injured reserve with a back injury.

BO RIDES INTO DIRTY TOWN ON WHITE HORSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL TANTON, The Baltimore Evening Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a long time now, college athletics have appeared to be out of control. 
</P>
<P>
From every corner of the country there seems to have been a steady string of 
stories about college athletes involved in illegal drugs and worse (rape, 
assault with a deadly weapon), cheating scandals, recruiting violations, 
coaches breaking rules. It's enough to make you sick. 
</P>
<P>
These things have become so common that they no longer rate premium space in 
the sports section. 
</P>
<P>
Stories on the current trial of two sports agents in Chicago have been 
relegated to an inside page, even though they concern juicy items like illegal 
payments to college athletes and threats that mob guys would break the legs of 
players who did not return money. 
</P>
<P>
People shrug at this stuff now. 
</P>
<P>
And these things have been happening in the college ranks, where, 
theoretically, we are training leaders of the next generation. 
</P>
<P>
Well, the knight in shining armor rode into town this week. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan's Bo Schembechler is no newcomer to college sports. He has been on the 
scene seemingly forever. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler is Michigan's football coach and athletic director. It was in his 
role as athletic director that he became a new hero to some disenchanted fans. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler's basketball coach, Bill Frieder, announced two days before 
Michigan's first game in the National Collegiate Athletic Association 
Tournament that he was leaving after the season to become the new coach at 
Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler beat him to the punch. 
</P>
<P>
He told Frieder not to bother to come back for the NCAA Tournament. A Wolverine 
assistant, Steve Fisher, will coach the team, Schembechler told the defector. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler was the picture of strength as he said in a televised interview: 
</P>
<P>
"No Arizona State coach is going to coach Michigan. I want to make that clear. 
A Michigan man is going to coach Michigan." 
</P>
<P>
You can hardly blame Frieder for coveting a job that pays $300,000 a year. But 
his timing, coming nearly 48 hours before Michigan's opening-round game against 
Xavier (Ohio) in the Southeast Regional, doesn't say much for Frieder. It 
doesn't say a whole lot for Arizona State, either. 
</P>
<P>
With one classy move, Schembechler put some desperately needed sanity into 
college athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Those who know Schembechler are not surprised at the way he handled this 
situation. One of those is Elliot Uzelac, the Navy football coach. He was on 
Schembechler's coaching staff before coming to the Naval Academy. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler was the speaker at the Navy football banquet Feb. 10. He told the 
story of a Michigan team a few seasons ago that was not playing up to its 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
"What's wrong with this football team?" Schembechler asked his assistants. 
</P>
<P>
They told him there were certain players who were doing a lot of grumbling. One 
of the chief grumblers was, of all people, the team captain. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler called the young man in and gave him a lecture about the 
responsibilities of leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"You're our leader," Schembechler said. "If you act this way, how can we expect 
the rest of the team to act any better?" 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler said that by the time he was finished, the player was near tears. 
But the message got through. The grumbling stopped, the team won the Big Ten, 
and Michigan went to the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler thought the story was worth telling at Navy, where not only the 
athletes but all 4,000 midshipmen are being trained to lead. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler certainly didn't acquire principle this week. He has run a 
successful and clean program throughout his 20 years at Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
He has always been a strong and honest man. We need more people with his sense 
of what's right and what's wrong in college athletics.

NEWSWIRE: REPORT: FOR SUTTON, IT'S QUIT OR BE FIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Eddie Sutton doesn't resign, he is expected to be fired within a few days as 
basketball coach at the University of Kentucky, the Louisville Courier-Journal 
reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said action could be taken this week at the board of directors 
meeting of the Kentucky Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with CBS-TV, Sutton, who is 90-40 at Kentucky, said "that (his 
future) may come up, but I have not been asked to resign at this point." 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted anonymous sources as saying that although Sutton is not 
named in the 18 National Collegiate Athletic Assn. allegations, the school 
wants him out. 
</P>
<P>
If Sutton's contract is terminated, Kentucky would still be obligated to pay 
off the remaining year at $80,000.

Darryl Strawberry, New York Mets outfielder, was involved in two shoving 
incidents during the sixth inning of an exhibition game against the Toronto 
Blue Jays at Dunedin, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
The first altercation started when pitcher Jeff Musselman hit Strawberry in the 
back with a pitch, and the right fielder ran out to the mound. Strawberry was 
tackled by catcher Pat Borders and third baseman Kelly Gruber before he could 
reach Musselman. 
</P>
<P>
Then, when Strawberry advanced to third base, he and Gruber argued briefly and 
began to scuffle. Both benches emptied, the players were separated and 
Strawberry was ejected.

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most expensive lineup in baseball this season costs $19,388,895 and doesn't 
even include Jose Canseco and Kirby Puckett. 
</P>
<P>
The best lineup in baseball, using the 1988 Associated Press major league 
All-Star team, goes for about $7.5 million less. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Orel Hershiser of the Dodgers is one of only two AP All-Stars to make 
the All-Money team. His 1989 salary, including a prorated share of his signing 
bonus, is $2,766,667, the highest in baseball this season. 
</P>
<P>
On the All-Money team, Hershiser would throw to Gary Carter of the New York 
Mets ($2,160,714). The infield would feature Eddie Murray of the Dodgers at 
first base ($2,244,462), Juan Samuel of the Philadelphia Phillies at second 
base ($1.45 million), Cal Ripken of the Baltimore Orioles at shortstop 
($2,466,667) and Wade Boggs of the Boston Red Sox at third base ($1.725 
million), the only other All-Star on the team other than Hershiser. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel played second base last season but Philadelphia is planning to on move 
him to the outfield this year. If he weren't counted, Steve Sax of the New York 
Yankees would take over at $1,266,667. 
</P>
<P>
The most expensive outfield in baseball would have Jim Rice of the Boston Red 
Sox ($2,325,385) in left field, Andy Van Slyke of the Pittsburgh Pirates ($2.15 
million) in center field and Andre Dawson of the Chicago Cubs ($2.1 million) in 
right field. 
</P>
<P>
Salaries were obtained by the AP from several player and management sources. 
For Murray and Rice, income deferred without interest is discounted to reflect 
present-day value. 
</P>
<P>
The most expensive lineup has an composite batting average of .283 with 18 home 
runs and 73 runs batted in, not including Hershiser, the pitcher. For 
$7,747,728 less, the AP All-Stars average .309 with 19 homers and 89 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Catching Hershiser on the AP All-Stars would be Benito Santiago of the San 
Diego Padres, who at $310,000 once again is the least-highly paid player on the 
AP All-Stars. He's also only one of two AP All-Stars not yet eligible for 
salary arbitration. Boston outfielder Mike Greenwell is the other. 
</P>
<P>
At first base is Will Clark of the San Francisco Giants ($1.125 million), at 
second base is Ryne Sandberg of the Chicago Cubs ($890,000), at shortstop is 
Alan Trammell of the Detroit Tigers ($1 million) and at third base is Boston's 
Boggs. 
</P>
<P>
In the outfield are Puckett of the Minnesota Twins ($2 million) in center 
field, Canseco of the Oakland Athletics ($1.6 million) in right field and 
Greenwell of the Red Sox ($500,000) in left field. 
</P>
<P>
The AP All-Star team is actually less expensive than it was last year, when the 
payroll of the 1987 All-Stars was $12,101,823. This year the AP All-Stars' 
payroll is $11,916,667, a 1.5% decrease and an average of $1.32 million per 
player. 
</P>
<P>
The payroll of the All-Money team increased 5.0% from last season's $18,469,222 
and the players earn an average of $2.15 million.

CHUCK DALY HAS THE PISTONS FLYING RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY SULLIVAN, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Detroit Coach Chuck Daly, who never met a metaphor he didn't like, sees the 
National Basketball Association season as one long, tumultuous airplane ride. 
</P>
<P>
"I liken the coach's job to that of the pilot," Daly said Tuesday. "You take 
off in October and get it airborne. You enjoy some smooth sailing, not much 
though. There's turbulence ahead, turbulence on the right and left. And 
somehow, you've got to try to land it at the end of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Give or take a minor brawl or two, Daly's Pistons have been cruising through 
clear skies for about three weeks now. They're moving freely about the plane. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Aguirre and Isiah Thomas are sitting near the front, exchanging stories of 
their native Chicago. Bill Laimbeer and Rick Mahorn are horsing around in the 
back. Joe Dumars is reading the stock pages. 
</P>
<P>
And if you'll look out the window to your left, you can probably make out 
Cleveland, which has just encountered some unexpected turbulence -- five losses 
in eight games -- and fallen behind Detroit for the first time in three months. 
</P>
<P>
One month after trading Adrian Dantley for Aguirre, the Pistons are at cruising 
altitude. They've won eight straight games and 12 of 13, lifting their record 
to 44-16. They have the fewest losses, the top winning percentage in the league 
and appear to be bracing themselves for another run at the title. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, but it's no big deal," Daly said. "I've been around a long time, and you 
just have to keep on doing your job. When you start getting involved in looking 
at what other people are doing, you lose focus of what you're trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
Daly has been coaching for more than 30 years. At 58, he is the league's oldest 
coach and its most relentless pessimist. Even when his team was going well, he 
was bemoaning its inconsistent offense, and that's why he pushed to get Aguirre 
from Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
"Offensively, we seem to be more in sync now," Daly said. "We're moving the 
ball a little better and making the extra pass -- at least in the last few 
weeks. (Aguirre) has been about what I expected. He's a terrific offensive 
player. His passing has been a bit of a surprise. But he needs game 
conditioning and a lot of work defensively." 
</P>
<P>
Aguirre's progress has been slow. In 14 games with Detroit, he's averaging 17.1 
points on 48.9 percent shooting. Still, whatever the reason, the Pistons have 
been a more effective team since his arrival, averaging five more points a game 
(109.9 to 104.9) without any significant decline in their defense. 
</P>
<P>
Most telling is the way Thomas has responded to Aguirre's presence. He has 
scored at least 20 points in each the last six games, averaging 25.5 points on 
58.1 percent shooting. Saturday in Philadelphia, Thomas scored 24 points in the 
fourth quarter to lead Detroit to a come-from-behind victory. He had 15 in the 
final period of Tuesday's win in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
Those are the sort of performances we've come to expect from Thomas in the 
postseason, and it's a sure sign that Detroit is rounding into playoff form. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, and lest we forget, the other half of last year's championship series is 
also cruising. The defending champion Los Angeles Lakers have won five in a row 
and are just two games back of Detroit in the loss column. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers have come on with a vengeance since an embarrassing 105-79 loss in 
Utah Feb. 22, winning 9 of 10 by an average margin of 18 points. During a 
recent five-game road swing, their underrated defense held the opposition to an 
average of 95.4 points on 41.4 percent shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"We are playing consistently, and our defense is good every night," the Lakers' 
James Worthy said. "That's the big thing." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' surge has coincided with the awakening of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who 
will turn 42 in a month. Two months ago, Abdul-Jabbar was averaging 8.8 points 
and shooting 43.2 percent. In 23 games since, he has averaged 13.0 points on 
53.6 percent shooting. And he's averaging 11 rebounds in his last three games. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento Coach Jerry Reynolds has fully recovered from his bout with 
exhaustion and is again filling notebooks with outrageous quotes. 
</P>
<P>
On management's dubious decision to trade his top two centers, Joe Kleine and 
LaSalle Thompson, without getting a pivotman in return: "If we had one more 
center, we'd have one. It's a bacon-and-egg sandwich only if you have the egg." 
</P>
<P>
On newly acquired Danny Ainge: "He's already the best guard in the history of 
the Sacramento Kings. And that should tell you something." 
</P>
<P>
On his team's record-setting 16-for-31 performance from three-point range last 
month: "When the Knicks had the record, everybody talked about it. But since we 
took it over, they've ignored us -- which is just fine with me." 
</P>
<P>
In recent back-to-back blowouts over Seattle and Indiana, Chicago's Michael 
Jordan averaged just 19.5 points. The reason? He was playing point guard. "It's 
still a game-by-game decision (by Coach Doug Collins)," said Jordan, who had 
more assists (29) than field-goal attempts (28) in the two wins. "It's not 
something I want to do all season because I'm a natural off guard." 
</P>
<P>
NBA Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics hope Oklahoma point guard Mookie Blaylock slips through the draft 
so they can pick him at No. 12 or 13. Having traded Ainge, Boston needs an off 
guard but wouldn't pass up Blaylock if he were available. ... The Knicks not 
only lead the league in three-point goals and attempts, but their three-point 
defense (27.3 percent) is the NBA's best. ... Charlotte is promoting Kelly 
Tripucka for most improved player, but he's not cooperating. "I've never liked 
the award," said Tripucka, currently idled by back spasms. "What's happening to 
me now is a continuation of what should have been happening the last two years 
(when he languished on Utah's bench). It's like I was redshirted for those 
years." 
</P>
<P>
There's talk that Hornets Coach Dick Harter might coach in Portland next 
season. Harter coached for seven years at Oregon. ... Deposed Portland Coach 
Mike Schuler could wind up at Golden State. Schuler was an assistant with Don 
Nelson in Milwaukee. ... Dallas General Manager Norm Sonju says Roy Tarpley is 
making progress in drug treatment and could return for the playoffs. He must 
mean next year's playoffs. With James Donaldson gone with a knee injury, Dallas 
is in grave danger of finishing ninth in the Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta's Dominique Wilkins has changed agents, which seems like an annual 
event. He's joined ProServ, the Washington-based agency that also represents 
Patrick Ewing, Michael Jordan, James Worthy, John Stockton and Adrian Dantley. 
... The Lakers' Magic Johnson recorded his league-high 12th triple-double 
Tuesday against Houston with 19 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists -- though he 
shot 4 for 23. ... Hornets center Tim Kempton won $200 from a columnist by 
stuffing an entire Burger King Whopper into his mouth. Kempton gave his 
winnings to charity. 
</P>
<P>
An intriguing thought from Washington Bullets Coach Wes Unseld: "I can't prove 
it, but I wouldn't be surprised if the Pistons pay all the fines for Mahorn, 
Laimbeer and Rodman. They like to foster this 'tough guy' image in Detroit." 
... Further reason for Spurs Coach Larry Brown's headaches: The Clippers are 
3-33 on the road, and the last two wins have been in San Antonio. ... The 
Knicks, who have won 26 straight at home, need five more to break the Celtics' 
record of 31 straight in a single season. Boston won its final 31 home games in 
1985-86 and its first seven in 1986-87 to set the league record of 38 over two 
seasons.

ORIOLES COUNTING ON BULLPEN THIS YEAR, BUT . . .; 
</P>
<P>
FRANK ROBINSON HAS NO IDEA WHICH FIVE PITCHERS WILL FURNISH THAT RELIEF 
</P>

<P>
Because the hallowed members of the Baltimore Orioles' bullpen don't figure to 
reach Cooperstown the conventional way, there's only one hope of immortalizing 
their wild and wacky cause. 
</P>
<P>
With a motto. Sort of an updated, "Spahn and Sain and pray for rain," but more 
urgent. "Rain or shine, pray for nine," the relievers might say, begging the 
starters for complete games. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Frank Robinson said recently that the bullpen will play a critical role 
for the Orioles this year, perhaps the most critical role, but he still has no 
idea who his five relievers will be. 
</P>
<P>
That's nothing unusual for this training camp, but the trade of Mike Morgan to 
the Los Angeles Dodgers further confused the issue, creating another opening 
for a reliever. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the bullpen makeup hinges not just on the performances of the 
remaining 10 or 11 candidates -- it's hard to pinpoint an exact number -- but 
on the starters as well. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Holton is a candidate both ways, and he'll almost certainly take a 
permanent spot in the rotation if rookie Pete Harnisch (8.53 ERA in 6 1/3 
innings this spring) continues to struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan's departure, however, may make it even more important for the Orioles to 
keep the veteran Holton in relief. Robinson said he was considering Holton as a 
closer but not as a long man. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the status of No. 1 draft pick Gregg Olson also remains in question. 
Like Holton, he can go either way, but the Orioles aren't even sure it's best 
for him to make the club. 
</P>
<P>
The Morgan trade changed the entire equation. Robinson said it would force the 
Orioles to "look a little longer" at Jose Mesa, who missed nearly all of '88 
with elbow trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson also indicated that major-league draft pick "Texas" Mike Smith is 
likely to make the club. Smith probably will start the season in long relief, a 
la Jose Bautista last year. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Williamson and Mark Thurmond are two other leading contenders, and Jay 
Tibbs remains an outside threat. Tibbs, if nothing else, possesses a solid 
repertoire of pitches and experience. 
</P>
<P>
The other Mike Smith, the one from Mississippi, is suffering from shoulder pain 
and is probably a long shot, yet he throws as hard as anyone. He had close to a 
2-1 strikeout-to-walk ratio in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson wants to choose the 10 best pitchers, and under the circumstances, he 
probably can't afford anything less if the Orioles are to be even mildly 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
Last year his starters averaged 5 2/3 innings per outing, and only the New York 
Yankees (5 1/3) were worse in the American League. This year, the Orioles may 
have an even lower average. 
</P>
<P>
The rotation as of now would include two rookies (Harnisch and Bob Milacki), 
one pitcher in his second season (Bautista) and another in his third (Jeff 
Ballard). 
</P>
<P>
The staff ace would be Dave Schmidt, who has never thrown more than 129 2/3 
innings in a season and cannot be expected to challenge for the league lead in 
complete games. 
</P>
<P>
"(The bullpen) may be the single-most important thing on this team this year," 
Robinson said. "They're going to have to throw some innings. They're going to 
have to save games for the young guys. 
</P>
<P>
"They may have to come in earlier than you want. But it's very important they 
don't let games get away. That won't build confidence in the young guys." 
</P>
<P>
The big questions revolve around Holton and Olson. Holton, a former Dodger, 
isn't the man you want for short relief. He's a breaking-ball pitcher, and his 
fastball is average, at best. 
</P>
<P>
"He has an outstanding curveball, and he can throw it in critical situations," 
Dodgers Executive Vice President Fred Claire said. "But we never quite 
envisioned him as a stopper." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers used Holton mainly in middle relief -- he made only one start in 98 
appearances the last two seasons -- and that's probably his best role. 
</P>
<P>
But Robinson wasted Schmidt in that capacity last year, and he's not going to 
make the same mistake twice. Holton wants to start, but he wouldn't mind being 
the short man, either. "If it came down to that, I'd be comfortable with it," 
he said. "I think I can handle it. I don't think I could ever get in a more 
stressful situation than that playoff game last year." 
</P>
<P>
Olson is an entirely different issue. He hasn't allowed an earned run in six 
exhibition innings, and he has shown he can pitch out of a windup. Clearly, he 
is one of the 10 best pitchers in camp. 
</P>
<P>
However, he's also last year's No. 1 draft pick. Robinson has said that the 
decision on Olson will be made not just by the coaching staff, but by the 
entire organization. 
</P>
<P>
Olson, of course, was a reliever at Auburn, and it's unlikely he'll crack the 
Orioles' staff as a starter. "That may be asking too much," farm director Doug 
Melvin said. 
</P>
<P>
Middle relief, then, might be ideal, for it would allow Olson to gain 
experience in low-pressure situations. Otherwise, he probably is better off 
starting for triple-A Rochester. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond those two pitchers, the Orioles are scraping to find a left-handed 
reliever. There are no Dan Plesacs in camp. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson's main choices are Mark Thurmond and Kevin Hickey. He said it would be 
"awful tough" for both to make the club. In truth, neither strikes his fancy. 
</P>
<P>
Why else would Robinson continue to include Al Holland and Robinson Garces 
among his contenders? Hickey throws harder than Thurmond, but he hasn't pitched 
in the majors since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Rain or shine, pray for nine? 
</P>
<P>
Alas, it's too early for the motto.

COCAINE PUTS ANTLEY AT CAREER CROSSROADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW BEYER, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jockey Chris Antley, at Laurel, Md. Saturday to ride the favorite in the 
Federico Tesio Stakes, is at the crossroads of his career -- and his life. 
</P>
<P>
He is America's best rider under the age of 25, and he has the potential to 
move to the very top of the racing game. 
</P>
<P>
He also has the potential to self-destruct -- to become the most noted cocaine 
casualty in his profession. 
</P>
<P>
Drug tests taken at the New York tracks have turned up two "positives" on 
Antley -- once for marijuana a year ago, and then for cocaine in November. If 
it happens again, his license will be revoked for a minimum of a year. "One 
more time," says his agent, Drew Mollica, "and it's professional suicide." 
</P>
<P>
Antley knows that. But will the realization make him change his life? Many 
people in racing have their doubts, for they look upon Antley as a kid spoiled 
by his sudden success. 
</P>
<P>
Antley burst into prominence in New Jersey, where his success made him the 
country's top race-winning rider in 1985; he had little trouble making the 
transition to the tough New York circuit, and in 1987 his mounts earned more 
than $8 million. Last year, he started getting his first real national 
attention, as the jockey for the Kentucky Derby favorite Private Terms. 
</P>
<P>
Antley celebrated this whirlwind success -- and his first taste of money -- by 
partaking of life in the fast lane. His most visible outward symbol was his 
car, a huge white Mercedes 560SEC. 
</P>
<P>
It couldn't have surprised many people that cocaine was a part of the lifestyle 
he had chosen. "I started experimenting off and on with cocaine 2 1/2 years 
ago," Antley said. "It never seemed to be a problem for me." 
</P>
<P>
The jockey had seen a good first-hand lesson for thinking that cocaine could be 
a problem. His brother, Bryan, wrecked his own chances for a career as a jockey 
because of his drug use. 
</P>
<P>
Why would an athlete with the talent to earn money, fame and success take a 
chance of throwing everything away so recklessly? 
</P>
<P>
To this question, Antley answered, "Just because you're making big money 
doesn't mean everything is perfect with your life. People don't know your 
family problems, your individual circumstances. I was unhappy, I wasn't 
content," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When Antley tested positive for cocaine at Aqueduct last fall, his life fell 
apart. He didn't want to leave his house, didn't even want to turn on a radio 
or television to face up to his disgrace. "I was shattered," he said. "I came 
to the point where I just about wanted to die." 
</P>
<P>
Antley entered the prescribed 30-day rehabilitation program, then started to go 
to three-a-week meetings with a support group. He made changes in his 
lifestyle. He gave up his old nightlife. He even bought a Blazer 4X4 to help 
eradicate his life-in-the-fast lane image. He said, "I have no temptation 
whatsoever to use cocaine. I have a hatred for what it caused me. I look down 
on it now." 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, at least, his life and career are back on track. Antley 
resumed riding Jan. 25, and he said, "Walking out of the jockeys' room that day 
I was more nervous than I was before the Derby. But I got a lot of support from 
everyone, even the fans; I didn't hear anything negative." 
</P>
<P>
Antley promptly showed that he was as sharp as ever, and despite the time he 
had missed he ran away with the riding title at the Aqueduct winter meeting, 
winning a remarkable 27 percent of his starts. He has a chance for success in 
this year's 3-year-old stakes with A.M. Swinger, the colt he rides at Laurel 
this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
And he has done all of this by the age of 23. The only thing that can keep 
Chris Antley from reaching the acme of his profession is Chris Antley.

BIG RETURNS ON SMALL INVESTMENTS ARE AN EXCEPTION IN HORSE RACING

<P>
When it comes to instant millions, everyone seems to remember the Seattle Slew 
story. 
</P>
<P>
The colt was purchased for a mere $17,500 and went on to win the 1977 Triple 
Crown. Slew was then syndicated for millions and has continued to be a money 
machine at stud for Three Chimneys Farm outside Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
There are other thoroughbred success stories. 
</P>
<P>
Mercedes Won, a leading 3-year-old, was purchased for $5,700, but has already 
won more than $600,000. Devil's Bag, purchased for $325,000, was sidelined for 
the 1984 Triple Crown because of a leg injury but was still syndicated for $36 
million. Conquistador Cielo, the 1982 Belmont winner, was bought for $150,000 
and had a first-year stud value of $36.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
While horse racing gives the appearance of an industry of big returns on a 
small investments, it actually is just the opposite. For every winner, there 
are eight to 10 losers -- some carrying price tags in the hundreds of thousands 
of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Secretariat's son Risen Star, the winner of the Preakness and 
Belmont, had one third of its syndication rights sold for $14 million. 
Meanwhile, a Secretariat gelding, Ft. Clark, sold for a mere $1,000 at 
California auction after an unsuccessful racing career. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the big-money returns also came before the horse market went into a 
skid three years ago -- a fact the inexperienced investor seldom takes into 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"It's super risky," said Leland Faust, a San Francisco attorney and investment 
counselor. "It's on the extreme of investments. Even if it is done properly, 
it's risky. A lot of people get into the industry with the thought of making a 
fortune and really don't check it out. It's an industry you really have to know 
to invest in. 
</P>
<P>
"So many things can go wrong. A horse can have the appearance of a winner, but 
never make it to the gate because of an injury." 
</P>
<P>
A thoroughbred -- unlike a stock -- needs daily care, feeding and training. 
Costs can mount of so quickly that the horse can literally eat its owner out of 
house and home. 
</P>
<P>
An investor can hedge his potential losses by putting his money in a company 
like Centennial Farms Management Co. The Boston firm sells limited partnerships 
-- consisting usually of a half dozen or so horses -- in its $12 million stable 
of 30 horses. 
</P>
<P>
"Don Little (Centennial's founder) has racing in his blood and he saw a 
definite need in the marketplace for a company like this," said Sara Cohen, 
Centennial's executive director. "The marketplace was ripe and the purse 
structure was such that you could make serious money in horse racing." 
</P>
<P>
Centennial's investors, who put up between $15,000 and $50,000 apiece, share 
the winnings and split the proceeds when the horses in the limited partnerships 
stop racing. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, for example, Centennial's Silent Account -- which won $480,475 in 
its racing career -- was sold for $410,000. The investors in the limited 
partnership that included Silent Account split up the $890,475. 
</P>
<P>
However, Cohen says the company gives no illusions to the investors. 
</P>
<P>
"We lay it right on table at the beginning," she said. "The horse business has 
a great deal of risk attached to it. We tell them we will try to minimize the 
risk to the best extent possible." 
</P>
<P>
Centennial cuts its risks by buying into only the successful bloodlines and by 
purchasing a number of fillies. "There are ways to minimize the risks," Cohen 
said. "We buy into the top end of the market. Historically, the greatest 
overall returns have been with the best bred, best conformed horses. 
</P>
<P>
"We also put together programs that have a number of horses in them, usually 
five to seven race horses. So all the investor's money is not in one horse. We 
also put a substantial amount of money into fillies. A filly may not be a 
winner on the track, but she can become very valuable as a broodmare." 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the company has about 350 investors. 
</P>
<P>
While not as risky as investing in a horse, buying shares in a thoroughbred 
farm still comes with some dangers. Case in point is the ongoing Spendthrift 
Farms Inc. trial in San Francisco federal court. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, a group of investors was lured by the thoughts of big returns by 
buying into Spendthrift Farms -- a Kentucky thoroughbred institution. 
Ironically, Seattle Slew was the star of the farm's breeding stock. 
</P>
<P>
The offer attracted 14 individual or groups who invested $12 million in stock 
shares. Among the investors was fashion designer Calvin Klein and his partner, 
Barry Schwartz; Washington state lumber tycoons George Layman Jr. and Sr. and 
Zenya Yoshida, Japan's leading thoroughbred breeder. 
</P>
<P>
The investors say they were defrauded. The defense claims the investors filed 
the suit as "sour grapes" and should have known the risk. A federal court judge 
will decide later this month who is right.

SUNDAY SILENCE, WHITTINGHAM'S BEST 3-YEAR-OLD, FACES 5 TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
If trainer Charlie Whittingham knows what he has got in Sunday Silence, he's 
not telling. 
</P>
<P>
"All I know now is that he's the best (3-year-old) I got," Whittingham said. 
"He almost beat Houston, and (Wayne) Lukas says Houston is the best he's got." 
</P>
<P>
Although Sunday Silence and Houston have been impressive, neither horse has 
been tested in stakes competition. 
</P>
<P>
Houston, the $2.9-million yearling who won his only two starts as a 2-year-old, 
will be sent to Aqueduct this week for his 3-year-old debut, in the 
seven-furlong Bay Shore next Saturday. That leaves Sunday Silence and five 
others to compete today in the $150,000 San Felipe Handicap at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Half of the field for the 1 1/16-mile San Felipe -- favored Music Merci, 
Mountain Ghost and Runaway Dunaway -- is trained by Craig Lewis. This is a 
tactic that Whittingham has frequently used in important stakes races, 
something that the 75-year-old trainer characterizes as "surrounding them." 
</P>
<P>
The other starters today are Flying Continental, who Friday was made eligible 
for the Triple Crown races, for a late fee of $3,000, and Yes I'm Blue, one of 
the lightweights in the stake at 115 pounds. Mountain Ghost and Runaway Dunaway 
will carry 114 pounds apiece, 10 fewer than the top-weighted Music Merci, who 
in his 3-year-old debut won the San Rafael at Santa Anita three weeks ago. 
Sunday Silence carries 119 pounds, and Flying Continental has been assigned 
118. 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham saw the potential in Sunday Silence before the horse even raced. 
Last October, while at Churchill Downs for the Breeders' Cup, Whittingham was 
tempted to make a quick trip to Los Angeles, to see Sunday Silence in his debut 
in a maiden race at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham finally stayed in Louisville. Sunday Silence, racing greenly, led 
at the top of the stretch of the 6 1/2-furlong race before losing by a neck to 
Caro Lover. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, at Hollywood Park, Sunday Silence was again matched against 
maidens. He won by 10 lengths, running six furlongs in an excellent 1:09 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 3, Sunday Silence graduated to allowance competition, and the field for 
the 6 1/2-furlong race included Houston. It was only the second start for 
Lukas' huge colt, a son of Seattle Slew. Only one horse -- a Northern Dancer 
colt who sold for $3.7 million -- had cost more than Houston at the 1987 
yearling auctions. 
</P>
<P>
Houston had made only one start -- a 13-length victory at Belmont Park four 
months before -- and based on that performance, he was sent off a 4-5 favorite. 
The odds on Sunday Silence were 9-5. 
</P>
<P>
With both horses carrying 120 pounds, Sunday Silence led by 1 1/2 lengths at 
the top of the stretch, but Houston wore him down and won by a head at the 
wire. 
</P>
<P>
After that, both horses got some time off. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence returned to the races on March 2 at Santa Anita and scored a 4 
1/2-length victory, proving he could also handle an off track by running 6 1/2 
furlongs in 1:15 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
"Sunday Silence is a big and growthy colt," Whittingham said. "But he acts like 
he can run. He went head and head with Houston through the stretch." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence is not as well-bred as Houston -- who is by Triple Crown 
champion Seattle Slew out of the champion filly, Smart Angle -- but his 
bloodlines are respectable. Halo, the sire, has accounted for a string of 
successful horses, including Sunny's Halo, the 1983 Kentucky Derby winner. 
Wishing Well, the dam, was a multiple stakes winner in California, and Sunday 
Silence is her first foal to race. 
</P>
<P>
Halo's offspring have been good for Whittingham's morale as well as his wallet. 
Lively One was a top 3-year-old last year who bled in the San Felipe, ran 
second in the Santa Anita Derby and became a major winner after finishing 12th 
in the Kentucky Derby. Goodbye Halo has earned $1.4 million and is one of the 
best distaffers in training. 
</P>
<P>
"Halos are very feisty, they show a lot of fire," Whittingham said. "This colt 
is no different. We should find out more about him after this race." 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Hancock, a Kentucky breeder who is one of the owners of Goodbye Halo, is 
the principal owner of Sunday Silence. The other owners are Whittingham and 
Ernest Gaillard, a surgeon from La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
Hancock had a horse who ran a neck short, to Advance Man, in the 1982 San 
Felipe. All was forgiven six weeks later when Gato Del Sol won the Kentucky 
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Besides Gato Del Sol, other non-winning horses in recent runnings of the San 
Felipe have gone on to major victories. They include Alysheba, Skywalker, 
Nostalgia's Star and Gate Dancer. . . . Chris McCarron, who has won the San 
Felipe four of the last seven years, doesn't have a mount in today's race. . . 
. Runaway Dunaway isn't nominated for the Santa Anita Derby or the Triple 
Crown. . . . Because they have different owners, trainer Craig Lewis' three 
horses will run separately in the betting. 
</P>
<P>
Making his first start since beating only one horse in the Breeders' Cup 
Classic 3 1/2 months ago, Lively One won a $60,000 allowance race Saturday by 3 
1/2 lengths over Prove Splendid, with Sarhoob, making his first start on dirt, 
finishing third. . . . Robbie Davis, replacing Pat Valenzuela, rode Lively One 
for his third winner of the day. Valenzuela told Santa Anita stewards late 
Saturday morning that he had the flu and was excused from his mounts. 
Valenzuela is scheduled to ride Sunday Silence in the San Felipe. 
</P>
<P>
Clever Trevor, a Remington Park horse, won the $250,000 Remington Derby 
Saturday with California shippers Manastash Ridge and Double Quick running 
fourth and seventh, respectively. . . . Russell Baze rode Invited Guest to 
victory at Golden Gate Fields in the $100,000 Golden Poppy Handicap, which was 
taken off the grass and run on a sloppy main track. . . . Bill Shoemaker rode 
Present Value to victory in the $100,000 Portland Meadows Mile.

<P>
Don Sutton is living with mixed emotions these days. He is happy in his new 
career as a sportscaster, but he is not happy with the way his old career 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers released Sutton last Aug. 10 after he had won 324 major league 
games, 233 in a Los Angeles uniform. Sutton said the team should have handled 
the situation more delicately. 
</P>
<P>
Sutton, who will turn 44 on April 2, talked about his departure before 
Saturday's exhibition game victory over the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to have been given the opportunity to retire gracefully instead 
of being kicked out," Sutton said. "They got rid of me with a lack of respect 
for someone who had meant that much to the club." 
</P>
<P>
Sutton had re-signed with the Dodgers in January of 1988 after a seven-year 
odyssey that had taken him to Houston, Milwaukee, Oakland and the Angels. He 
started regularly last season until he developed soreness in his right forearm, 
then was on the disabled list for six weeks. He was reinstated Aug. 9, started 
in Cincinnati that night, and was sent packing the next day. 
</P>
<P>
"I pitched six good innings and got drilled in the seventh," Sutton said. "The 
next morning, Fred Claire (the Dodgers' executive vice president) called me in 
and told me I was gone. It was done in a poorly orchestrated manner, with no 
class at all. There was no offer to retire. It was embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
Informed of Sutton's complaint, Claire said that Sutton could have opted to 
announce his retirement when he was released. 
</P>
<P>
Sutton, who had a 3-6 record with a 3.92 earned-run average, was released to 
make room for pitcher Ramon Martinez, who was called up from triple-A 
Albuquerque. "I can't argue with that," Sutton said. "But they could have kept 
me around in some capacity. It would have been fun to have been a part of one 
of the greatest years in Dodger history, and I certainly deserve a niche in 
Dodger history. 
</P>
<P>
"They just kicked me out the door. I wasn't shown the door. I was kicked out of 
it. There were a number of ways I could have had a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
Sutton did not express any bitterness when he was released. 
</P>
<P>
He said at the time: "I would liked to have left on a more successful note, not 
being injured and with more wins." 
</P>
<P>
Sutton is filing daily reports on the Dodgers for Fox Television. He will work 
35 Dodger home games on the Z Channel during the season, plus about 75 Atlanta 
Braves games on cable station TBS. He also will fill in on regular Dodger 
broadcasts, and will make his debut today as a substitute for Ross Porter. 
</P>
<P>
Porter was called to Oklahoma City Saturday because of the illness of his 
mother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Ramon Martinez, who had been unimpressive previously, improved his chances of 
being the Dodgers' fifth starting pitcher when he held the Expos to two hits in 
five innings. The Dodgers won in 11 innings, 2-1, on pinch-hitter Mickey 
Hatcher's single. Martinez said: "My fastball was mean and nasty. I feel like I 
can pitch here." However, catcher Mike Scioscia said: "I think he's got to get 
more consistent with his breaking ball. I'd say Mike Morgan has the inside 
track to be our fifth starter." . . . Mario Soto, former Cincinnati Reds 
pitching star who tried to rehabilitate his ailing arm with the Dodgers last 
year, watched from a box seat. "I'm done," he said. "My arm is gone." . . . 
Jeff Hamilton returned to third base for the Dodgers after being out 10 days 
with a thigh injury. 
</P>
<P>
Hall of Famer Hank Aaron thinks the Dodgers are better off with Willie Randolph 
at second base than they were with Steve Sax, now with the New York Yankees. 
Aaron is director of player development for the Atlanta Braves, who share the 
West Palm Beach training complex with the Expos. He said Saturday, "I don't 
think the Dodgers are going to miss Sax at all. Randolph is better than Sax 
defensively. He's one of the best second basemen in baseball."

BICHETTE CONTINUES HOT HITTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

PALM SPRINGS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Angels Stadium was witness to another massive home run by the Angels' massive 
rookie outfielder, Dante Bichette, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
This one, Bichette's second in as many days, was a fourth-inning grand slam off 
the Seattle Mariners' Mark Langston, a feat that brought the right-field 
bleacherites to their feet for a simple but rousing chorus as Bichette trotted 
out to his position in the top of the fifth: 
</P>
<P>
"Dante's Gonna Stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad baseball rosters aren't assembled by popular vote. 
</P>
<P>
By Angel Manager Doug Rader's admission, Bichette has done everything he has 
had to do this spring. Hit for average? Bichette is batting .349. Hit for 
power? His four home runs lead the Angels. Drive in runs? Bichette and Devon 
White share the club lead in that department with 13 runs batted in apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Bichette is even fielding, which had been a major blemish on his scouting 
report. In the sixth inning Saturday, Bichette raced back to the wall to pick 
off, backhanded, a drive by Greg Briley, turning a potential double into a long 
sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
All this . . . and it still might not be enough to earn him a roster spot on 
opening day. 
</P>
<P>
Ask Rader about Bichette's bid to break into the Angels' congested outfield 
alignment and he'll respond with a mock grimace. "Why do you got to bring that 
up?" he says. 
</P>
<P>
Selecting an outfield was supposed to have been the least of Rader's worries. 
White, Chili Davis and Claudell Washington were going to play every day. Tony 
Armas, who hit 13 home runs as a reserve in 1988, was going to back them up. A 
done deal. 
</P>
<P>
Bichette, coming into camp with the one-year-away tag, has cramped Rader's 
style, no doubt, but the manager continues to hold to his original line of 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very much against players going into spring training and making the club 
out of the blue," Rader said. "Spring training is a very difficult place to 
accurately appraise talent. The mistakes you can make outweigh the correct 
guesses, 110-1. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . When you look at what (Bichette) did at triple-A last year, there 
certainly was no indication that he could have a spring like this. It's like 
he's gone from a prospect to a can't-miss prospect overnight. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to make it clear he's not out of the picture. But based on what he did 
at Edmonton last year, he still needs to have a solid year there." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, at age 24, Bichette batted .267 with 14 home runs and 81 RBIs in 132 
games. "And that's in a hitter's league," Rader noted. 
</P>
<P>
Bichette, not surprisingly, is not particularly keen on spending another summer 
north of border and south of the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a big disappointment, going back to Edmonton," Bichette said. 
"That would mean I'd been at Edmonton three years in a row. It would seem like 
I'm going nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
Bichette said he would take Anaheim any day, even if it means sitting on the 
bench most days. "I've looked at both sides of it and being in the big leagues 
outweighs playing every day in Edmonton." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Angels evened their record at 8-8 with a 7-6 victory over Seattle. The 
Angels totaled 10 hits, including Dante Bichette's grand slam and a two-run 
home run by Devon White. White went two-for-four to raise his batting average 
to .465. "He's going to be tired when this year's over," Angel Manager Doug 
Rader said, "because I can't see playing anybody out there but him." . . . Tony 
Armas intrepidly ventured out to first base for Round 2, after committing two 
errors in one play during Round 1. Armas' Saturday line: no errors, two slick 
plays, including a diving stop of a sharp grounder by Harold Reynolds. . . . 
Seattle pitcher Mark Langston was forced out of the game after taking a Dick 
Schofield line drive off his right ankle. Preliminary X-rays showed no fracture 
and Langston limped away with a bad bruise.

The trade rumors must seem like electric jolts to Lenny Dykstra. Unpredictable 
in timing, unnerving in voltage and certainly never satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
Lenny Dykstra, already a pretty hyper kid, cannot get used to those rumors. 
They get to him every time, invariably leading him to believe the New York Mets 
might set him free. Every time he rides to the top of that roller coaster, he 
plummets, because the jolt sizzles for a while, then fades away. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, because Dykstra is Dykstra, the letdowns do not dampen the excitement 
whenever his name creeps into the headlines. Again and again, Dykstra, who 
wants a trade, believes freedom is at hand. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, the hopes are low because the best the Mets' top trader, Joe 
McIlvaine, will say is that talks on all fronts are "dormant." 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
Dykstra is one-half of one of the game's most successful platoons -- 
"Mook-Stra." That center-field combination not only features, but stars, Mookie 
Wilson and Dykstra. And the Mets just love the two-headed, four-legged, 
fleet-footed creation. "Mook-Stra" sparks the team, no matter which center 
fielder Davey Johnson pencils in. 
</P>
<P>
Dykstra gives power from the left side, stirs hearts when running the bases, 
ignites the team at the most appropriate times. Wilson? He does the same, only 
from both sides of the plate. Liquid mercury on the bases, the veteran Wilson 
is amazingly adept at catching fire just when it seems Dykstra might be wearing 
down. Or wearing out Johnson's patience because of the little guy's 
not-too-welcome penchant for trying to hit home runs. When Wilson wears down or 
becomes a bit of a defensive liability or the Mets can afford to stack 
left-handers in the lineup, Dykstra takes the stage. 
</P>
<P>
It is definitely a case of a team putting its priorities first. The Mets look 
at the two halves and see a whole player who, in the last three years, has 
helped win two division titles, one pennant and one world championship. The 
team figures, why mess with a good thing? So even though both halves of 
"Mook-Stra" have had trade requests on the table since 1987, the pleas for 
freedom have gotten the duo nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
"Although both players don't like to admit it and won't admit it, they are a 
good tandem and have complemented each other well," McIlvaine said. "Although 
we have considered a lot of different possibilities involving both players in 
trades with other ballclubs, we've never really come up with a solution that 
would make us a better team." 
</P>
<P>
"That's great -- for them," Dykstra said. "Not for us, though." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, who turned 33 last month, is almost resigned, and is even contemplating 
life after the majors. When you get to that age, it is understandable if the 
pastures of a newly purchased farm in South Carolina might compete with the 
green grass of Shea. 
</P>
<P>
But Dykstra is only 26. Unlike Wilson, he cannot point to seasons where he was 
able to claim center field as his own. Knowing it will not happen this season, 
unless something drastic and unexpected occurs, hurts. 
</P>
<P>
This winter has been particularly tortuous because, at times, it seemed the 
Mets' resolve was cracking. Dykstra's name actually was mentioned seriously as 
one of the components in the now-ended talk with Atlanta involving Dale Murphy. 
When the talks were hot, Atlanta Braves general manger Bobby Cox read the words 
from Dykstra. "Someone asked him how it would feel to go from a winning team to 
one that lost 100 games," Cox said. "He said, 'If I was there, they wouldn't 
lose 100.' You've got to like that." 
</P>
<P>
But the talks floundered. The Braves also wanted pitching prospect David West. 
The New York Mets said no. So Dykstra stayed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frustrating," Dykstra said. "It's also a great compliment that teams want 
me and say nice things about me. I wouldn't mind, though, if some of those 
things come true. Because this is definitely not easy to accept." 
</P>
<P>
So Dykstra returns to reality, to "Mook-Stra." All he can do is harness his 
abundant nervous energy, pointing it in the direction of National League 
pitchers and catchers whenever he can. 
</P>
<P>
"I ask for a trade all the time, whenever I get a chance," he said. "I ask 
reporters if anything's happening. Ain't nothing happening. That's the way it 
is." 
</P>

<P>
Terry Cummings scored 26 points, and Jack Sikma added 21 as the Milwaukee Bucks 
snapped the Detroit Pistons' nine-game winning streak, 117-100, Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
It was the eighth straight home win for the Bucks, who trail the second-place 
Pistons by four games in the Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
"We only have 17 losses, and four have been to this team," Piston Coach Chuck 
Daly said. "We have trouble matching up and posting up with this club." 
</P>
<P>
Detroit trailed the entire game. The closest the Pistons came was 57-56 on 
Isiah Thomas' jumper two minutes into the second half. The Bucks broke away for 
good with a 15-6 run late in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Sikma scored five points, and Larry Krystkowiak added four during the run as 
the Bucks increased a seven-point lead to 82-66 with 3:16 left in the third. 
</P>
<P>
The Bucks led by 19 points four times in the final period, and the Pistons were 
never closer than 13 points in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 123, Philadelphia 114 -- Bernard King scored 31 points as the 
Bullets extended their home winning streak to 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
John Williams scored 22, Mark Alarie 17 and Steve Colter 16 for the Bullets, 
who are battling Philadelphia and Boston for the final two playoff berths in 
the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia trailed, 62-57, at halftime and couldn't get any closer than three 
points in the second half. Charles Barkley and Hersey Hawkins scored 24 points 
each for the 76ers, although Barkley was only seven of 20 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana 114, Chicago 103 -- Chuck Person scored 11 of his 30 points in the 
fourth period, and Detlef Schrempf had 20 points and 10 rebounds at 
Indianapolis as the Pacers broke a four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls battled back from a 14-point halftime deficit to tie the game at 80 
before Scott Skiles hit a jumper to give the Pacers a two-point lead entering 
the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan had 28 points for Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Denver 111, Miami 105 -- Alex English scored 25 points and had nine assists, 
and the Nuggets turned back a late Miami rally to win at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Denver led by as many as 17 points late in the second period before Miami cut 
the halftime deficit to 63-52. The Heat moved to within four points at the 
start of the final period before the Nuggets, led by Fat Lever, increased their 
lead to 94-83. Lever, who returned after missing five games with a knee injury, 
finished with 21 points, eight steals and six rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Heat cut Denver's lead to 101-98 on a jumper by Sylvester Gray, but Michael 
Adams responded with with a three-point basket and the Nuggets were never 
threatened again. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 127, Portland 113 -- Otis Thorpe scored 25 points and 10 rebounds, and 
Sleepy Floyd had 17 points and 17 assists to lead the Rockets at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Clyde Drexler scored 35 for the Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix 122, Seattle 104 -- Eddie Johnson scored 29 points, and Tyrone Corbin 
added 22 as the Suns improved to 23-0 at home against Western Conference 
opponents and won their 10th straight overall at Veterans Memorial Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle lost its sixth straight road game, despite 29 points by Dale Ellis and 
28 by Xavier McDaniel. 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio 114, Utah 98 -- Alvin Robertson had 27 points, 10 rebounds and 10

streak to seven games as Kenny Smith scored 23 points and Harold Pressley added 
17, including 10 in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Adrian Dantley scored 30 points for Dallas.

LESLIE GETS 21 TO LEAD MORNINGSIDE TO TITLE

<P>
Junior center Lisa Leslie of Morningside High School fashioned a different 
ending from last season Saturday in leading her team to the State Division I 
girls' basketball championship at the Oakland Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie, a 6-foot 5-inch Parade All-American, led Morningside to a 60-50 victory 
over Oakland Fremont with 21 points, 14 rebounds and four blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Leslie missed a six-foot jumper at the buzzer as Morningside fell 
to Fremont in the State final, 53-52. 
</P>
<P>
But Leslie, who averages 25 points, 14 rebounds and seven blocked shots, was 
overwhelming Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"We really felt hurt last year," she said. "It didn't matter to us how much we 
won by, we just wanted to win." 
</P>
<P>
Morningside (32-1), ranked No. 1 in the state, won its final 23 games. The 
Monarchs' only loss was to Southern High of Louisville, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect to beat everybody we play," Morningside Coach Frank Scott said. 
"That's the attitude I've instilled in them, that there's nobody that can beat 
them. This is a very young and hungry team." 
</P>
<P>
With 3:34 left Morningside held an 11-point lead after sophomore guard Bridget 
Williams made a three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers (26-5), ranked No. 3 in the state, never got within 10 after that. 
Besides, Leslie, Morningside's strong inside offense and aggressive defense 
were too much for Fremont. "They just out-hustled us up and down the court. 
They played very well," Fremont Coach Lola Smith said." 
</P>
<P>
Despite its dominance in the second half, Morningside started slowly. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we were so anxious," said Morningside guard JoJo Witherspoon, the 
team's only senior. "But, you know, once we got going, we got going." 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs went scoreless for periods of two and three minutes during the 
first quarter. It wasn't until the start of the second quarter, when they went 
on an 8-0 run, that they showed signs of life. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs were helped by 12 Fremont turnovers and the Tigers' poor 
free-throw shooting (5-of-13) in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside took advantage and followed its 8-0 run with six unanswered points 
and with 2:21 left in the half the Monarchs held an 11-point lead, 34-23, after 
Witherspoon's runaway layup. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie, who had 19 points in the first half, scored twice after that, on a 
layin and a six-foot jumper, to give Morningside a 13-point lead at the break. 
</P>
<P>
Fremont was led by Senior Priscilla Smith's 13 points and nine rebounds. 
Witherspoon scored nine and freshman forward Janet Davis and Williams each 
scored eight for the Monarchs.

SACRAMENTO GRANT DOMINATES KATELLA FOR EASY VICTORY

<P>
It did not take long for Joni Easterly of Anaheim Katella High School to come 
up with reasons why her team lost, 59-43, to Sacramento Grant in the State 
Division II girls' championship game Saturday at the Oakland Coliseum Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"We could have run our press break better," said Easterly, a Katella guard. "We 
could have made some layups and blocked out a lot better on the boards." 
</P>
<P>
And that was just for starters. 
</P>
<P>
Grant outplayed Katella in most every category to win its second consecutive 
Division II title. 
</P>
<P>
It was Grant's fifth consecutive appearance in a state championship game. The 
Pacers finished the season with a 32-3 record. Katella, which was playing in 
its first state final, was 29-4. 
</P>
<P>
Tina Green, one of four Grant players who scored in double figures, had 19 
points and 11 rebounds. Shawyna Robertson had 15, Kimyatta Horton 12 and Tesia 
Green 10 for Grant. 
</P>
<P>
Easterly, who will attend USC, led all scorers with 22 points, but it was not 
close to being enough for the Knights. 
</P>
<P>
After a slow start -- Grant trailed, 16-12, at the end of the first quarter -- 
the Pacers jump-started their game. Tina Green, a senior forward, and Robertson 
led a second-quarter attack that effectively broke Katella's momentum. The 
Pacers outscored the Knights, 14-7, in the second quarter to take a 26-23 lead. 
</P>
<P>
After Robertson's three consecutive baskets opened the third quarter, Grant 
led, 32-23, and had control. 
</P>
<P>
Katella made a couple of second-half runs to close the deficit but Grant 
responded each time. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights rallied to within four late in the third quarter, 34-30, on a 
three-point shot and a fast break layup by guard Angie Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
But Tina Green scored on a follow shot and then made a jumper as Grant regained 
control, 38-30. 
</P>
<P>
Grant then put the game away for good by outscoring Katella, 14-4, in the first 
four minutes of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Easterly fouled out with 3:00 minutes left, but it made little difference by 
then. 
</P>
<P>
"They were the quickest, best shooting team we've faced," Katella Coach Barb 
Bausch said. "We can't hold our heads down. We got beat by the best team I've 
seen this season." 
</P>
<P>
Grant's goal was to hold Easterly, who averages 22 a game, to no more than 20, 
and to control the rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
"If we stopped her from scoring 30 points and outrebounded them I thought we 
would win," Coach Connie Zuercher said. 
</P>
<P>
Grant outrebounded Katella, 48-25. The Knights had only four offensive 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"We worked in practice on allowing them one shot and that's it," Zuercher said.

STEROID CHARGES: ANOTHER HURDLE FOR UCLA COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN FLEISCHMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If anyone knows of unexpected barriers one needs to conquer in life, it is John 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
An outstanding quarter-miler, Smith attended UCLA during the turbulent late 
'60s and early '70s and became active in the anti-Vietnam War and black 
nationalist movements. But Smith kept aim at his goal: to win an Olympic gold 
medal for the United States. As the 1972 Munich games rolled around, he was 
favored to finish first in 400 meters. 
</P>
<P>
But then life played one of its tricks -- a hamstring injury three weeks before 
the games. He struggled to make it to the finals but pulled up around the 
second turn of the race. 
</P>
<P>
Smith would also be haunted for years by the massacre of 11 Israeli athletes by 
Arab terrorists during the games. 
</P>
<P>
"Why my Olympic Games? Why my games?" Smith asks, shaking his head. "During 
(the Seoul Olympics), people lost medals for taking drugs. Well, whoop-de-do. 
People were losing their lives when I was in the Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like being home during the Watts riots. I was so sick of that stuff, 
and then I went over there and I'm in a war zone again. I said to myself, 
'Damn, I can't leave this garbage.' " 
</P>
<P>
Now in his fifth season as an assistant coach in charge of sprinters for the 
UCLA track team, Smith has established himself as one of the most prominent 
coaches in the world. Four Smith-coached athletes participated in the Seoul 
Olympics, and two, Danny Everett and Steve Lewis, came home with two medals 
apiece. Lewis provided Smith with some measure of redemption when he won the 
gold medal in Smith's event, the 400. 
</P>
<P>
But then another obstacle popped up. 
</P>
<P>
On March 1, disgraced sprinter Ben Johnson's coach, Charlie Francis, implicated 
Smith and dozens of other current or former athletes during a Canadian 
government inquiry into use of anabolic steroids. Francis testified that Smith 
told him that another professional coach, Pat Connolly, asked Smith in 1979 for 
Dianabol, a steroid drug, for Olympic sprinter Evelyn Ashford. 
</P>
<P>
Then last week, Canadian sprinter Angella Taylor Issajenko testified that Smith 
told her that when he lived in Toronto in 1980-81 he used Dianabol while 
competing. Commented Smith: "This is getting ridiculous. They (Issajenko and 
Francis) are fabricating and distorting everything." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he has never taken steroids nor advocated their use by his athletes. 
He points out that during the four months preceding the Seoul games, Lewis, for 
example, tested negative eight times for steroids. To date, none of the 
athletes coached by Smith has tested positive for steroids. 
</P>
<P>
"Charlie's trying to justify why he told his athletes to take drugs, and he's 
using people such as Evelyn, Pat and myself," Smith said. "We're three who have 
not been tainted, so to speak, about the use of performance-enhancement drugs. 
. . . We've done our coaching day in and day out in a very mother-and-fatherly 
approach. Charlie's done it through science and needles and the whole nine 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Charlie's a very intelligent coach, but he resorted to experimenting with 
people's bodies, and that's a heavy responsibility. Now he's facing the 
pitfalls of taking that route." 
</P>
<P>
Smith met Francis when Francis was a sprinter at Stanford and Smith was at 
UCLA. Like Smith, Francis suffered an injury before the Munich games and 
couldn't compete. 
</P>
<P>
"When we met in 1980, he (Francis) was more or less into developing athletes 
though drugs," Smith said. "I wanted to do it through teaching the artful 
approach of running and the metaphysical side. 
</P>
<P>
"Charlie discussed his lack of acceptance of religion and of a higher being. . 
. . We didn't agree on anything once we started talking about things that 
weren't tangible. 
</P>
<P>
"I've known what he's done. I feel I'm a better coach because I don't have to 
use the stuff. There's only room for one at a time on top. I took my time over 
the years, and so did he, but he did it out of a bottle and I did it 
straightforward." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA enters this season trying to win a third straight National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. title.

TOROS TAKE 3RD PLACE IN REGIONAL TOURNEY; 
</P>
<P>
SEASON'S 20TH WIN COMES A DAY LATE AFTER LAST-DITCH LOSS TO BAKERSFIELD

<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Dominguez Hills won its 20th game of the season here Saturday night, 
but it came a day too late to really matter. 
</P>
<P>
The Toros built a 19-point lead in the first half on the strength of eight 
three-point baskets to win the third-place game of the Division II Western 
Regional tournament, 98-77, over Sonoma State. 
</P>
<P>
The game was merely a season-ending formality. Both teams were eliminated from 
advancing further in postseason play Friday night. Dominguez Hills (20-10) lost 
to Cal State Bakersfield, 64-61, while Sonoma (17-14) was beaten by UC 
Riverside, 79-63. Riverside won Saturday's championship game, 63-60. 
</P>
<P>
For Dominguez Hills, senior center Anthony Blackmon scored 27 points, and 
senior guard Derrick Clark had 15 points, nine assists and six rebounds. 
Sophomore guard Robert Barksdale added 18 points and 11 assists. 
</P>
<P>
This tournament will be remembered, perhaps, more for the tension off the floor 
than for the play inside Bakersfield's month-old, 3,700-seat gym. 
</P>
<P>
First, there were the front-page headlines, both here and out of town, that 
Bakersfield officials had "bought" a spot in this tournament for their team -- 
which finished two games behind Dominguez Hills in the regular California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. standings -- by offering a $24,000 guarantee, the 
largest in Division II history. 
</P>
<P>
University officials vehemently denied the charge, but players from UC 
Riverside, the top-seeded team, showed up here Thursday for practice with 
T-shirts that said "FOR SALE: NCAA Division II Western Regional." 
</P>
<P>
So incensed was Riverside Coach John Masi that he would not allow his players 
to talk to the Bakersfield press. 
</P>
<P>
There were a few hard feelings on the Toro sidelines, as well, when it was 
learned that Blackmon, the CCAA player of the year, was not voted to the 
Division II All-American team, despite being named to the all-Western Regional 
team. Making the team instead was guard Maurice Pullum of Riverside, who was 
also named the tournament's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the championship game between Riverside and Bakersfield rolled 
around at 8 p.m. Saturday, the extra tension was evident. 
</P>
<P>
It was a game Dominguez Hills Coach Dave Yanai thought his team should have 
been in. Bakersfield defeated Dominguez Hills in two of their three meetings, 
but in 120 minutes of play against each other, Bakersfield held the lead for 
only 4:20. In Friday night's game, Dominguez Hills led by as many as nine 
points, but much as in their second meeting, a last-second 52-50 loss in 
Carson, the Toros couldn't hold on. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the season ended on a high note Saturday. This was Yanai's fifth 20-win 
season, and the victory over Sonoma State snapped a four-game regional playoff 
losing streak. In addition, Dominguez Hills ranked third in the nation in 
defense, holding opponents to about 60 points a contest.

<P>
"It's nice to come away with a taste of victory," Yanai said. "This season has 
been a real positive one. These players are tremendous people. It has been an 
absolute pleasure to coach them."

HART SAVED FROM A BASEBALL LOSS TO ALHAMBRA PURELY BY ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Tim Brown

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hart High baseball team was bailed out by an unusual source Friday, 
although the last time the Indians' newest reliever threw a baseball, he likely 
was trying to win a stuffed animal at an amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
The reliever -- a gentleman behind the wheel of a pickup truck -- tossed his 
most effective curve across two lanes of the San Bernardino Freeway and into 
the Alhambra team bus. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the fender-bender but the Moors were stranded until a 
rescue bus arrived, delaying the Foothill League game between Alhambra and Hart 
for more than an hour. The holdup later would prove frustrating for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the distraction, Alhambra pitcher German Louisiaga was picking his 
spots and picking apart Hart batters. He relied primarily on a nasty curve to 
strike out six and limit the Indians to two hits. 
</P>
<P>
"His curve slid and then it dropped," said Hart's Ray Gardocki, who struck out 
swinging twice. "Some of us, like me especially, were trying to pull the ball." 
</P>
<P>
In time, however, the bottom fell out on Louisiaga's lightning. The game was 
suspended in the bottom of the sixth inning because of darkness with Hart 
trailing, 3-2. The game will be completed at a date to be announced. 
</P>
<P>
"I deserved that game," Louisiaga said. "I was working hard. I don't think it's 
fair." 
</P>
<P>
Gardocki said that it was not an equitable situation from the outset. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not that happy they showed up an hour late," he said. "We can come back 
when we've got a clear head." 
</P>
<P>
And if the Indians do come back, they can credit the save to the guy in the 
banged-up pickup. 
</P>
<P>
Add Hart: The injury to Jason Edwards, who has been unable to pitch because of 
soreness in his right shoulder, was diagnosed Thursday as tendinitis in the 
rotator cuff. Edwards is taking oral medication to reduce inflammation in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, the 1988 Foothill League MVP, plans to pitch in two weeks and says 
that he will get a pain-killing cortisone shot in order to expedite his return 
to the mound. 
</P>
<P>
Dismissal fallout: Herman Cooper, who recently lost an appeal concerning the 
dismissal of his son, Craig, from the Westlake baseball team, said Saturday 
that he is still considering possible actions against Coach Rich Herrera and 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Cooper, the team's most valuable player as a junior last season, was cut 
from the team in late February. Westlake officials have refused to divulge 
their reasons for cutting Craig, but Herman Cooper claims it is because of an 
emotional disorder that Craig has suffered. 
</P>
<P>
The Coopers' appeal to Carol Erie, the Conejo Valley Unified School District's 
director of secondary education, was denied last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still looking at some options right now," Herman Cooper said. "I don't 
think it's absolutely dead just yet." 
</P>
<P>
Luck o' the Eagles: During Chaminade's 0-6 start this season, Coach Steve 
Costley tried nearly everything to break the Eagles' hex. 
</P>
<P>
He changed his hat. He changed his uniform number. He changed his undershirt. 
But Chaminade still languished. 
</P>
<P>
Early last week, however, Costley looked at Friday's game against Paraclete as 
another chance for superstition to intervene. It was, after all, St. Patrick's 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
The final: Chaminade 16, Paraclete 5. 
</P>
<P>
The difference? Chaminade had 20 hits and committed only three errors. And Pete 
Miller, whose given first name is Patrick, was five for five. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, and the Eagles switched from their standard navy blue headgear to green 
caps. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the Dodgers do it, and we needed something," Costley said. 
"Unfortunately, I think some of the guys want to wear them again Wednesday." 
</P>
<P>
Costley, who has a bit o' the Irish in him, declined the offer. 
</P>
<P>
Said Costley: "When your colors are blue and orange, the green looked pretty 
hideous." 
</P>
<P>
Bus stop: Apparently, sickness among bus drivers in Culver City has reached 
epidemic proportions. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks' baseball team, having played only two games before the start of 
the Marmonte League season, was scheduled to play host to Culver City on 
Wednesday. The game, however, was postponed at 12:15 p.m. when the Centaurs' 
bus driver fell sick and a substitute could not be found. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks Coach Jim Hansen was, to say the least, irritated. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't begin to tell you how angry I was," he said, "because we needed that 
ballgame so badly. We needed it to prevent from going flat as a pancake. 
</P>
<P>
"It sort of infuriated me to no end." 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers split a doubleheader against Lompoc before playing Channel Islands 
on Friday in their only other games. In contrast, their league foes had plenty 
of time to work the kinks out: Newbury Park played nine nonleague games, Simi 
Valley had seven, Channel Islands and Westlake each played six and Camarillo 
had five. 
</P>
<P>
Baby bloomers?: El Camino Real infielders Greg Lederman (third base), Gregg 
Sheren (shortstop), Paul Geller (second base) and Ryan McGuire (first base) 
hardly have a worn glove between them. 
</P>
<P>
Lederman and Sheren are sophomores and McGuire is a junior. Geller, a 
first-year starter, is the only senior. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fun," Coach Mike Maio said of employing a youthful quartet. "If they work 
out, we've got it pretty set for the future. But it's hard. The consistency is 
not there yet." 
</P>
<P>
Milestones: Saugus Coach Doug Worley this week became the third Valley-area 
coach this season to reach a milestone when the Centurions defeated Santa 
Clara, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
The win was Worley's 200th in his 13th season at Saugus. Earlier this month, 
Simi Valley Coach Mike Scyphers posted win No. 200 in his 10th season, and Bob 
Cooper of Hoover notched win No. 400 in his 25th season. 
</P>
<P>
For Worley, No. 200 couldn't have come at a better time. 
</P>
<P>
"The ones I keep thinking about are the losses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like last Saturday's 20-1 El Segundo tournament loss to Arcadia -- Saugus' 
worst under Worley. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been beat like that," said Worley, whose career record is 200-104. 
"It was a nightmare."

SIMI VALLEY MAKES MOST OF 8 ERRORS IN 10-5 WIN 
</P>

<P>
For Simi Valley High, Saturday's nonleague game against Crespi was little more 
than a tune-up for Marmonte League play. But for the Celts, it was a comedy of 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
The Pioneers took advantage of eight Crespi errors -- five in the fifth inning 
-- to score six unearned runs en route to a 10-5 victory at home. 
</P>
<P>
"We stink. That's all there is to it," Crespi Coach Scott Muckey said. "I 
thought it was the worst high school baseball game I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley (8-1) struck early, scoring three runs in the first inning on a 
single, two doubles and a walk off Crespi starter Chad Nichols (1-2). 
</P>
<P>
A two-run double by Greg Santos and an RBI double by Jeff Sommer were the big 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi (2-4-2) answered by sending nine batters to the plate in a five-run 
second. Simi Valley starter Mike Jenkins (1-0) walked in the first run and 
bases-loaded doubles by Nichols and Mark Maurizi drove in two runs each. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a real shaky second inning," Simi Valley Coach Mike Scyphers said. 
"There were a couple of balls that should have been caught, and Jenkins lost 
his composure a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins, who struck out four, walked three and gave up three hits in the 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
But Crespi's lead was short-lived as the Celts committed two crucial errors 
that contributed to two of Simi Valley's three runs in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
The Pioneers already had pushed across one run and had a runner on first when 
Andy Hodgins grounded to third. Brodie Van Wagonen, trying for an inning-ending 
double play, threw wildly to second, allowing Hodgins to reach safely and 
sending Jesse Anguiano to third. 
</P>
<P>
Anguiano scored the tying run when the next batter, Terry Hill rapped a 
grounder to short, but Maurizi dropped the ball and his throw to second was not 
in time to get Hodgins. Santos followed with a single between third and short, 
allowing Hodgins to score the deciding run. 
</P>
<P>
The Pioneers added four more runs in the fifth to account for the final score. 
Crespi committed five errors in that inning to help Simi Valley seal its fourth 
consecutive win. 
</P>
<P>
With two out, Jenkins reached base when Maurizi's throw bounced in the dirt 
past Scott Barton, allowing Kenny Hood to score from second. Hood should have 
been the third out of the inning, but his fly ball was dropped by Don Calabria 
in center field. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Bennett, pitching in relief of Nichols, then walked Mike Morano and on the 
fourth ball, catcher John Dempsey tried to pick Jenkins off third. The throw 
skipped past third into left field and Jenkins scored, increasing Simi Valley's 
lead to 8-5. Morano scored on another Dempsey throwing error after Chadd 
Johnson's single to center. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson scored the final run on Anguiano's single to shallow left.

BUT L.A.'S THE PLACE FOR THE HOTTEST LITERARY WHIRLWIND AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARRY ABRAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an unorthodox life, Bronx-born Ed Victor, a resident of Great Britain for 
nearly 30 years, may have made his most unconventional move yet. 
</P>
<P>
Since late last fall, Victor -- a well-tailored, 49-year-old whirlwind whose 
diverse clients range from actresses Candice Bergen and Linda Gray to the 
estate of Raymond Chandler to novelists Irving Wallace, Erich Segal, Erica 
Jong, Jack Higgins, Douglas Adams and Dame Iris Murdoch -- has been operating 
the American branch of his "boutique" literary agency out of a small office and 
a couple of tony restaurants on the Sunset Strip. 
</P>
<P>
This is his idea of a frontier scouting expedition. 
</P>
<P>
The foray has attracted a lot of attention in the close-knit world of book 
publishing, where his high-flying profile shows up instantly on radar screens. 
In some quarters Victor's arrival is seen as an important lift in the elevation 
of Los Angeles to higher realms of bookdom. 
</P>
<P>
Victor has a variety of reasons for setting up shop here in the winter months, 
an experiment he will try again next year and perhaps the year after that -- 
before deciding whether to become a permanent, albeit part-time, presence. Most 
important, he believes that "a lot of books come out of L.A. and I don't think 
people realize that and I don't think I realized it until I began to think 
about it." Of course, there are "a lot of celebrity books which are a staple of 
our industry," says Victor, whose recent exploits include agenting for epics by 
Bergen and Gray. But Victor also believes there is an untapped reservoir of 
unknown or obscure fiction and nonfiction writers who would benefit from his 
acumen. 
</P>
<P>
"For a town that produces so many books, it's severely under-agented," he 
maintains. Victor says he already has signed on a couple of local journalists 
he believes can do book-length work. 
</P>
<P>
As relatively unexploited turf, Los Angeles offered the added charm of not 
being New York, he says. In that city "there's a kind of a murderer's row of 
agents and they're very good and I compete with them, I just didn't feel like 
competing with them on their street," Victor says. 
</P>
<P>
Victor isn't the only new kid on the block, though. 
</P>
<P>
Owen Laster, New York-based executive vice president and board member of the 
powerful William Morris agency, says that his firm installed a full-time 
literary agent in its Los Angeles office about three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The need for that was in the air," he said, adding that Victor's decision may 
have helped crystallize the move. So far, that decision has proved to be right, 
Laster said. "He (the Morris agent) has already picked up quite a few writers 
plus one or two celebrity-oriented projects that I don't think would have been 
the case" without a presence in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime Los Angeles agent Mike Hamilburg, who knows Victor only by reputation, 
commented: "It makes it better for everybody. The more we're recognized as an 
important center for representing important writers, the better for everybody. 
. . . I was really pleased that he wanted to come out here, a guy of his 
caliber." 
</P>
<P>
Victor, who went to Cambridge University, remained in the United Kingdom and 
worked in publishing before becoming an agent about 15 years ago. He has family 
connections in Los Angeles. His mother lives here and an uncle, now retired, 
was a successful television producer. But although he has traveled here on 
short visits for years, opening an office represented a leap of faith. 
</P>
<P>
He remembers "very precisely that I was driving on the Ventura Freeway, which 
is a good place to get an epiphany, when I suddenly thought, 'Why don't I open 
an office here?' And I began to go through all the advantages it had for me. It 
gave me an office in what is arguably part of America. I mean, the jury is 
still out a little bit on it, but basically L.A. is part of the United States. 
It's no longer this strange thing, this drain in the lower left-hand corner of 
the map." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Clear Conscience 
</P>
<P>
As a fringe benefit, he and his family will escape the heart of the English 
winter with a clear conscience, Victor admits. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his familiarity with Southern California, however, Victor says that he 
had to adopt a fresh perspective to actually conduct business here. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first started coming here after I had this idea about the office, I 
referred to it as Bulgaria," he explains. "I tried to think of it as a foreign 
country with a very different language, as though I were emigrating to 
Bulgaria. It was interesting to think of it as Bulgaria because once you 
thought of it as Bulgaria, it solved a lot of problems. . . . So then you try 
to find your guides to Bulgaria and you find your accountant and you find your 
business manager, your lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
Ed Victor is the first to admit that the way he lives makes some people tired. 
All that jetting around, the weekending with famous people, the wheeling, the 
dealing, the power-lunching, the adrenalin rushes from doing million-dollar 
deals. And, above all, the non-stop telephoning -- starting half an hour after 
he gets out of bed -- dialing transoceanic calls from his car stuck in a London 
traffic jam, checking his watch to see what parts of the world are awake, a 
head stuffed with numbers and a file at the office for the ones that aren't 
engraved on his frontal lobes. Even his 4-year-old is starting to ask if he's 
ever going to hang up. 
</P>
<P>
The other night Victor got off the phone long enough to throw a party at his 
rented house in Coldwater Canyon. Everybody was there. Everybody meaning Jackie 
Collins, Candice Bergen, Irving Wallace, Douglas Adams, Timothy Leary and a 
whole bunch of other people who seemed important. There was hardly enough room 
to sneeze without danger of starting an epidemic, which is the way Victor likes 
his parties. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, my God, there's nobody here," Collins joked at one point. 
</P>
<P>
A little later somebody else said, "My God, you know everybody." 
</P>
<P>
That's the kind of party it was. 
</P>
<P>
"People sometimes get exhausted by my life when I tell them about it," Victor 
says. "But you don't actually have to be anywhere. I think there's a great myth 
about people sitting in offices. What happens to me if I sit too long in any 
one place, paper accretes on my desk and I start moving the paper around and 
people start asking me questions I don't want to deal with. Whereas, when I'm 
on the move, time becomes very concentrated." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Victor speaks as if he can't say everything fast enough. Sentences 
that should stand alone tend to be clamped together with connectors like 
boxcars in a long freight train. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, this is the way he describes getting a contract for 
thriller-writer Jack Higgins: 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing I had to do when I was here (Los Angeles) in November was a 
deal for Simon &amp; Schuster, a significant seven-figure deal -- every 
seven-figure deal is significant, but this is more significant -- for Jack 
Higgins, who lives on a rock in the English Channel called Jersey, with (Simon 
&amp; Schuster head) Michael Korda in New York. I'm just used to doing that all 
the time. It started because on my way out here, I sat down with Michael Korda 
at the Four Seasons (a New York restaurant) and then I came out here. Higgins 
is on his rock in the English Channel, Korda's in New York, I'm here but phones 
and especially the fax have changed everything. . . . I wish I could fax 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview from his channel rock, Higgins clearly was impressed 
with Victor, who became his agent last summer after he left his representative 
of 30 years following a disagreement over an autobiographical novel. His former 
agents believed the book was too out of character from his 49 other published 
novels, Higgins said, explaining that he then called Victor simply for his 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
Victor liked the book, "Memoirs of a Dance Hall Romeo," and agreed to place it, 
the author added. 
</P>
<P>
"Within 10 days he had got an advance of $125,000 from Simon &amp; Schuster and 
75,000 in Great Britain, plus the translation rights in a dozen countries," 
Higgins said. "He even negotiated (actor) Alan Bates to do the audio (the book 
on tape)." 
</P>
<P>
Victor went on to make the $1.5-million deal with Simon &amp; Schuster for a 
new thriller, Higgins added. 
</P>
<P>
"Ed knows more people than anyone I've ever met in my life -- people with a 
capital P," said Higgins, whose real name is Harry Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
While he believes that Higgins' atypical autobiographical novel should be 
published, Victor uses it as an example of how an agent can protect writers. 
</P>
<P>
"When I sold that book to Simon &amp; Schuster, I basically said you must not 
print more than 30,000 copies of it. . . . We don't want the bookstores to 
order lots and lots of copies of this because this is not a thriller. . . . It 
has to be very, very carefully presented. A lot of thought has gone into not 
selling too many copies of this book." 
</P>
<P>
Before he took her as a client, Dame Iris Murdoch, whose novels are strictly 
serious, never had an agent. "I never really bothered about these things," she 
said in a telephone interview from her home in England. "I just signed any old 
contract without reading it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'An Absolute Angel' 
</P>
<P>
Calling Victor "an absolute angel," Murdoch said that he "has a great 
understanding of literary people, which not every agent has. . . . He's got 
this talent a good doctor has, as if the only person he's attending is you. 
He's not looking at his watch or anything." 
</P>
<P>
For Victor, the great thing about being an agent is that it not only allows him 
to make money -- a lot of it by all signs -- it also allows him to move in 
circles that are defined by their disparity. 
</P>
<P>
"My secretary in London once said my whole business life was summed up in a 
moment when I came back from lunch one day and I said, 'Get me Koo Stark and 
Stephen Spender," he recalls. Stark was famous for 15 minutes when she was 
linked to the Royal Family's Prince Andrew. Besides being a Victor client, 
Spender is an English poet and critic important enough to be listed in 
Webster's New World Dictionary. 
</P>
<P>
Summing up, Victor says his eclectic tastes have put him "in a wonderful 
position in that I can represent what I want and what interests me and a lot of 
things interest me." He adds: "The only thing that bind together Erich Segal 
and Iris Murdoch is that I represent them and what binds them together in my 
mind is that both of them are fascinating to me. . . . I've actually taken on 
clients who make no money and can't write because I wanted to be near them and 
wanted to know them."

THE COUSTEAU WATCH: ANTARCTIC TREATY THREATENS CONTINENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACQUES-YVES COUSTEAU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There exists a vast, eternally white continent where life clings to the borders 
of death. There the icy air is light to the lungs and offers magical 
transparency to the sight. The hours of bewitching quietness and of total sun 
are swept away by raging blizzards that spare intruders only by chance. 
</P>
<P>
This immense austral land is buried under mountains of snow, piled up and 
frozen over the course of tens of millions of years. Fossils, the vestiges of 
important chapters in our planet's history, sleep under their immaculate 
shroud. All around circles a silent carrousel of giant icebergs that have been 
torn from the shores, and dwarf lichens sprinkle the coast ice with hesitant 
spots of color. A fringe of salty ice protrudes, then disappears with seasons, 
while on land soft ice melts only to better solidify. 
</P>
<P>
The sea sometimes reddens with clouds of tiny shrimp -- krill -- on which 
penguins, whales and, indirectly, seals stuff themselves in order to survive. 
The seals move about under the pack ice while singing eerie melodies; a fish -- 
the icefish -- injects proteins as antifreeze into its colorless blood; the 
orcas, endowed with majestic fins, blend their breath with the morning mist. 
</P>
<P>
Antarctica, continent at the bottom of the world, has shown us its fragile 
state, which is due to the extreme simplicity of its ecosystems. But the 
forbidding rigor of its environment did not discourage some territorial claims 
that the 1959 Antarctic treaty has thus far managed to include. The document, 
signed by 12 nations and now honored by 26 others, ensures the demilitarization 
of Antarctica and lays great stress on its use for scientific research. 
</P>
<P>
Already whales have been hunted, and more recent tentative agreements 
(particularly that of April 7, 1982) have begun opening the way to industrial 
fishing for krill. Such hypocritical infringements on the spirit that 
enthusiastically gave birth to the Antarctic treaty -- namely the willingness 
to preserve the last wilderness zone on our planet -- caused us to sound a 
first cry of alarm in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, this time, masks have fallen. Representatives of 33 countries, assembled 
in Wellington, New Zealand, have, after six years of difficult negotiations, 
signed an agreement that opens the entire Antarctic continent to a so-called 
controlled exploitation of its mining resources: coal, uranium, gold and oil. 
</P>
<P>
The document even specifies that prospecting by means of seismic explosion of a 
"reasonable magnitude" is permitted. The cold? The ice? It will be difficult? 
It will be costly? What does it matter!? Since it is possible, exult the 
technocrats, it will be done! What? Dust from coal and smoke from oil torches 
are going to alter the protective whiteness of the surface, the albedo of the 
entire continent? The ice may melt; the sea may rise several dozen feet and 
engulf most of our cities? Come, come now! More ecologists' tales! 
</P>
<P>
Hardly. We need only take the example of the Bahia Paraiso, the Argentine 
supply ship that ran aground in January off Palmer Station, a crucial U.S. 
scientific base. The diesel-fuel cargo leaked slowly, over a matter of days, 
but 20 years of scientific research was compromised before clean-up vessels 
could even reach the spill. 
</P>
<P>
Oil-coated seabirds and smothered plankton -- microscopic sea creatures being 
studied in experiments to gauge how increased ultraviolet sunlight will effect 
the ocean surface. Accidental pollution had finally stained the laboratory of 
Antarctica. It was a "minor" oil spill, authorities said, but the local 
consequences to the fragile ecosystem will take years, if ever, to recoup. 
</P>
<P>
If an innocent ship with an innocent purpose can cause potential catastrophe, 
what of mining operations? Are we naive enough to believe that miners will put 
on white coats and brush their feet before they unleash their industrial 
maelstrom? 
</P>
<P>
Citizens of the entire world, be on the alert! The Wellington Agreement is 
nothing more than a holdup on a planetary scale. It involves the smashing open 
of the safe that contains the most fantastic treasure: the last water reserve 
that cannot be controlled if it is set free. The hostages: seals, birds, 
penguins, whales. Threatened is the whole of humankind whose conscience in 
managing the future of our planet risks being sacrificed to the cult of a 
meaningless golden calf. 
</P>
<P>
The scrap of paper signed in Wellington will be applied when 16 of the 20 
voting members of the 1959 treaty ratify it. We must at all costs oppose this 
ratification in the name of future generations. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1972, I disembarked from Calypso onto Antarctica for the first 
time. A serene sun shone upon the dusting of snow which had fallen during the 
night. With my heart beating excitedly, I took my first steps. The crackling of 
my boots in the soft powder made me look back. My footprints, soiled with a bit 
of grease, contrasted with the blinding whiteness of everything that surrounded 
me. Naively, I blushed with shame for not having cleaned the soles of my shoes.

AUTO HISTORY PARKED SAFELY IN DETROIT

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Long before the Honda, Toyota and Mazda there was the Fujioka, a small car 
created in Los Angeles especially for export to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Made from 1922-23, the Fujioka was designed by two veterans of the Pierce-Arrow 
car company, Earl Spencer and George Morrow, and named for Fred Fujioka, an 
investor in the project, owner of the F &amp; K Garage in Los Angeles and an 
official of the Japanese-American Automobile Club of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few models were made. But Fujioka was one of 81 different makes of 
automobiles manufactured in Los Angeles during the early part of the century, a 
time when cars were made in 44 California locations. 
</P>
<P>
The Arrowbil came out of Santa Monica; the Clyde and Coyote Specials were born 
in Redondo Beach. Others from the Los Angeles area were the Anthony, James, 
Henry, Cal Six, Crist, Daisy, Eagle, Kennedy and Poppy. 
</P>
<P>
Information and photographs on these cars -- and more than 2,000 other models 
made in the United States -- are part of the Detroit Public Library's National 
Automotive History Collection. It contains more than 1 million catalogued 
items. 
</P>
<P>
Until 10 months ago, the library had stored 200 tons of material about autos -- 
including manuals, catalogues, sales material, photographs, magazines, books, 
personal papers of automobile pioneers, pamphlets, company records and private 
collections -- in boxes scattered throughout the building. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Renovated Wing 
</P>
<P>
An 8,700-square-foot wing, half the fourth floor, now houses the collection. 
Chrysler, Ford, General Motors and the Friends of the Detroit Public Library 
provided the necessary funding for the wing's $350,000 renovation. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the largest automotive history collection in existence and it's right 
where it should be -- in the automobile capital of the world," said John 
McAlpine, a retired automobile advertising executive and one of the 
collection's 25 trustees. "The Smithsonian tried to get it, but we've managed 
to keep it where it belongs." 
</P>
<P>
Ever since the Detroit Public Library acquired its first book on the automobile 
in 1896, John Henry Knight's "Notes on Motor Carriages: With Hints for 
Purchasers and Users," it has been amassing photographs and printed material on 
the machine that has changed the world. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the major car companies, the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Assn. and 
several other organizations have used the Detroit Public Library to store their 
records. Also housed here are the personal papers of many who played prominent 
roles in the auto industry, including those of Charles and Frank Duryea, the 
country's first car manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
The Nathan Lazernick collection, more than 100,000 photographs taken between 
1898 and the 1920s, chronicles the early days of the automobile industry. Here 
too are the records and photographs of the Charles Glidden historic road tours. 
</P>
<P>
Records of the landmark George Baldwin Selden Patent Case can be found in the 
archives. Selden, a lawyer and inventor, filed for a patent on the automobile 
in 1877, said Joe Karshner, another trustee who worked in GM's public relations 
department for 31 years. 
</P>
<P>
The patent was issued 1895 but Selden produced only one car, Karshner said. 
"All other car manufacturers had to pay him a royalty on their product." 
</P>
<P>
Henry Ford refused to do so, a decision that led to the Selden patent case. 
After a five-year battle, "Ford eventually won," Karshner said, noting the 
library has complete records of the case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Forms of Transportation 
</P>
<P>
There are also comprehensive records on bicycles, carriages, early steam-driven 
vehicles and other forms of transportation predating the car. The collection 
also includes buses, trucks and motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
Most automobile periodicals can be found here, beginning with the 1899 issue of 
Motor Age, and there are file cases of jokes and cartoons about cars, even 
sheet music containing songs about them. 
</P>
<P>
The contribution the auto industry made to World War I and World War II 
production is documented in industry and government archives covering both 
periods. 
</P>
<P>
Reprints of photos are available for a nominal fee and, three times a year, the 
library publishes Wheels, the Journal of the National Automotive History 
Collection.

SMALL BUSINESSES FIND LIFE AFTER QUAKE TOUGH, IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE

WHITTIER 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the warm days of September, 1987, Mary Yoon contemplated her good fortune. 
</P>
<P>
It was 4 1/2 years after Yoon opened her chocolate shop in Whittier's quaint 
Uptown Village, and the business was thriving. Yoon and her husband were 
raising their family in Whittier, a city that has been her home for more than 
20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Then on the morning of Oct. 1, the earth shook for 15 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
The building that housed Yoon's shop, Entiche du Chocolat, suffered extensive 
earthquake damage and was condemned. There was about $40,000 in damage to 
Yoon's home. Unable to obtain financing, Yoon abandoned the business and 
declared personal bankruptcy. Now, federal bankruptcy trustees are threatening 
to repossess her van and home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Like a Criminal Act' 
</P>
<P>
"You start feeling like being in an earthquake is a criminal act," said Yoon, 
whose blue eyes flash angrily as she recounts her struggle to stay afloat after 
the 5.9 temblor and its aftershocks. "We have lost a tremendous amount of faith 
in government." 
</P>
<P>
Yoon owned one of about 50 small businesses in the Uptown district that did not 
reopen after the disaster. Popular establishments such as Chiyomoto's Japanese 
Restaurant and Stallone's Fast Pasta closed permanently, while businesses such 
as Conlin Bros. Sporting Goods and Ames Bookstore moved elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of their size and limited economic resources, small businesses are 
easily disrupted by earthquake damage," according to a study of small 
businesses after the 1983 Coalinga earthquake by Michael E. Durkin, an 
engineering consultant and USC associate professor of architecture. "And since 
they form the economic backbone of many communities, the loss and disruption of 
these businesses can slow the community's recovery process and threaten its 
economic survival." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1987-88 fiscal year in which the earthquake occurred, Whittier's sales 
tax revenues were $6.7 million, about $500,000 less than expected. City 
officials attributed the drop to a number of causes, including the earthquake 
and the closing of May Co. department store at the Whittier Quad mall before 
the earthquake. Sales tax revenues for the 1988-89 fiscal year are estimated to 
be about $7 million, according to city records. 
</P>
<P>
A report by the National Center for Earthquake Engineering Research on the 
Whittier earthquake also noted the "serious level of vulnerability of 
businesses and corporations to the effects of moderate earthquakes." 
</P>
<P>
The center recommended that state and federal governments consider sponsoring 
earthquake insurance and encouraging property owners to make sure older 
buildings are structurally sound. 
</P>
<P>
The number and diversity of small business owners make them a difficult group 
to educate, said Paul Flores, director of the Southern California Earthquake 
Preparedness Project. 
</P>
<P>
"Many are unaware they are at risk, unaware of the problems they may face," 
Flores said. "They just don't know that (earthquake-caused bankruptcy) could 
happen to them and why." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Structure a Factor 
</P>
<P>
Small business owners often do not know that the structural reliability of 
their buildings is a major factor in surviving an earthquake, Durkin said. Many 
merchants begin their businesses in older buildings because of cheaper rents 
without considering how the building would react to an earthquake, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Durkin's study found that most business owners simply did not know whether 
their buildings were structurally sound. 
</P>
<P>
Structural safety is especially important to small businesses with expensive 
inventories and equipment such as pharmacies, liquor stores, restaurants and 
food sellers. 
</P>
<P>
Yoon opened her chocolate shop in Mission Court, a 72-year-old unreinforced 
masonry building on Penn Street across from the Whittier Hilton. Though she was 
advised that earthquake insurance would be difficult or impossible to obtain 
because of the building's construction, Yoon decided to lease the place anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"It was charming," Yoon said of the Spanish-style building with a fountain in 
the courtyard. "It suited our purposes." 
</P>
<P>
Merchants also must maintain adequate financial records to obtain a disaster 
relief loan from the Small Business Administration. The SBA requires such 
documents as tax returns for the last three years, balance sheets showing 
assets and liabilities, projections for the coming year -- "reasonable things a 
business must be able to do," said Robert L. Belloni, disaster assistance 
director for the SBA's western region. 
</P>
<P>
But Durkin's study found that one-third of Coalinga small business owners who 
took out loan applications after that city's 6.7 earthquake in 1983 never 
submitted the paper work. Those merchants told Durkin they either were 
overwhelmed by the SBA's requirements or believed they could not qualify for 
the loan. Comparable figures for the Whittier earthquake are not yet available. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Building Demolished 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn Gould, owner of Village Needlecraft in Uptown Whittier, said she filled 
out a preliminary SBA loan form, but was told she did not make enough money to 
qualify for the program. The building Gould was leasing was demolished after 
the earthquake, so she moved into one of about 15 trailers set up as temporary 
quarters for displaced merchants. 
</P>
<P>
After 10 months in the trailer, Gould made a permanent move and leased space in 
a newer building in the business district. In retrospect, Gould said, perhaps 
it was a blessing that she was unable to qualify for the loan. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have another bill on my hands to worry about," she said, "but I just 
barely hung on." 
</P>
<P>
In the 17 months since the earthquake, Yoon and Gould said, the only financial 
help they received were grants from the city of Whittier. The city, which 
received about $361,000 in donations for earthquake victims, distributed the 
money in grants to local merchants. 
</P>
<P>
Other local merchants report more successful dealings with the SBA. Wilson 
Turner, who owned an unreinforced masonry building that was demolished because 
of earthquake damage, is rebuilding with the help of a $450,000 SBA loan. The 
rest of his $1.3-million building is being financed by a local bank. 
</P>
<P>
"My experience with the SBA has been so delightful," said Turner, whose new 
building is scheduled to open in September, although he does not yet have any 
commitments from retail tenants. "I can't tell you how many different ways they 
went out of their way to accommodate me." Turner said he did not find the paper 
work required for the loan excessive. 
</P>
<P>
Belloni said the SBA wanted to help more businesses, but cannot approve loans 
unless applicants show they can repay the money. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Loans, Not Grants' 
</P>
<P>
"We're not making grants, we're making loans," Belloni said. "Even if we 
charged no interest, how many small businesses could afford even another 
$20,000 to $30,000 worth of debt? The last thing we want to do is foreclose, to 
be the landlord." 
</P>
<P>
Of the small business owners who did apply for loans, only 40% in Coalinga and 
57% in Whittier ever received SBA money, Durkin said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
Durkin said the SBA became more restrictive about granting loans after 
widespread attempts to defraud the agency in the 1971 San Fernando Valley 
earthquake. The SBA also was sued by 300 residents over a controversial part of 
the loan program that authorized the federal government to forgive $2,500 of 
any loan for $3,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
Residents who received both home and business loans were upset because the SBA 
only waived a total of $2,500 for both loans. The SBA agreed to the full waiver 
on all loans above $3,000 in a $400,000 out-of-court settlement with the 
residents. The waiver clause was subsequently removed from the federal disaster 
loan program. 
</P>
<P>
Belloni agreed that "it probably is more difficult to get a loan today than it 
might have been in 1971." But he pointed out that the size of a typical 1971 
disaster loan might have been $20,000 -- about half the average business loan 
of about $44,000 in Whittier. Thus, it was easier for the SBA to approve the 
1971 loans, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The quakes posed special problems for Whittier and Coalinga merchants, 
devastating central business districts dominated by unreinforced masonry 
buildings. In many cases, replacing older buildings resulted in higher rents 
that area merchants could not afford. 
</P>
<P>
Turner said the lease price for his new building will be about $1.50 a square 
foot, about triple the going rate before the earthquake. Gould said typical 
retail space in Uptown Whittier now rents for about $1.35 a square foot in the 
same area. 
</P>
<P>
The job of educating small business owners about these matters has fallen 
largely to the Southern California Earthquake Preparedness Project. The agency 
began working with the small business community in 1985, and has distributed an 
eight-page brochure on the topic, which is available in English, Spanish and 
Korean. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meetings Are Used 
</P>
<P>
Meetings of groups such as the Chamber of Commerce and ethnic business 
associations provide another useful channel for reaching small businesses, 
Flores said. The earthquake preparedness project has produced a video to show 
at such gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
And the agency is encouraging large corporations to lend their earthquake 
preparedness expertise to small businesses who are suppliers. "Even though (the 
corporation) may have its act together, one major supplier that's no longer 
there may make it difficult to resume business," Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
Corporations often can afford to hire earthquake or engineering consultants to 
develop a plan, Durkin said. "You need personalized problem-solving and there's 
nothing like that for small business in the $200 to $300 range," Durkin said. 
</P>
<P>
After the earthquake, Yoon said, a plan should be in place which would 
automatically provide loan extensions and other financial relief to business 
owners. Durkin suggested a temporary post-earthquake moratorium on government 
actions, such as demolishing buildings without the consent of the owners. 
</P>
<P>
After the Whittier earthquake, the City Council gave the city manager emergency 
powers to demolish any building that was a public hazard. About 11 buildings 
were razed under this provision, including some of the oldest commercial 
structures in town. 
</P>
<P>
Cities need "a period of time where local government can't demolish the 
downtown and haul it away," Durkin said. "The potential is there for government 
to do a lot of things too quickly." 
</P>
<P>
However, city officials say their action was prudent because crumbling 
buildings were endangering people and preventing the area from being reopened 
to traffic. 
</P>
<P>
In October, a year after the Whittier earthquake, Yoon filed for personal 
bankruptcy. Because she used her house and car as collateral for the loan to 
open the business, Yoon said, trustees assigned by the court have threatened 
her with foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
Yoon recently began working evenings teaching English to immigrants at a nearby 
computer school. Many of her days are occupied by what she calls the "legal 
proctology" of bankruptcy, from arguing to protect her possessions from 
foreclosure to selling her chocolate-making equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"Some days you fight and other days you don't even want to get out of bed," 
Yoon said. "I don't want to be a complainer. But I'm beginning to despair that 
the good guys are ever going to win."

<P>
High school students who want to work alongside nurses and other medical 
professionals are being sought by the Downey Community Hospital Volunteen 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, according to Volunteen President Carrie Francisco, a senior at 
Warren High School, teen-age volunteers were limited to running errands and to 
staffing the reception desk. Now they will work with staff members in the 
laboratory and emergency room and in the obstetrics, dietary, physical therapy 
and orthopedic departments. 
</P>
<P>
The young volunteers will not provide patient care, but they will be assigned 
chores that are helpful to hospital staff members, said Dari Caldwell, 
assistant administrator for nursing services. Interested youths ages 14 to 18 
can telephone the hospital at 904-5033.

CITY HIRES NATURALIST FULL-TIME TO LEAD PRESERVATION EFFORTS AT MADRONA MARSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Botanist W. Walton Wright was a UC Riverside student about 15 years ago when he 
first read of the battle to preserve Madrona Marsh, the only rain-fed wetland 
in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"Madrona sounded like an interesting place to lead a field trip," said Wright, 
who earned pocket money leading nature walks. "But when I got there it was all 
behind a fence and you couldn't get in." 
</P>
<P>
The fence is still there, but today Wright has no problem getting into the 
marsh. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the city of Torrance hired Wright, 49 -- a student of the wild 
burro, the fringe-toed sand lizard, the great blue heron and the flat-tailed 
horned lizard -- to be the city's first full-time naturalist to oversee the 
preservation of the marsh. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rigorous Selection 
</P>
<P>
Wright, who has a master's degree in botany and is completing a Ph.D. from the 
University of California, Riverside, was selected from a field of 15 after a 
rigorous written test and oral grilling by a panel of naturalists from Long 
Beach, Huntington Beach and the Los Angeles City Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
In his new job, Wright will still be going on nature walks, as coordinator of 
educational programs focused on the marsh. 
</P>
<P>
For more than eight years, as environmentalists pushed to get the city to pay 
more attention to the marsh, Torrance officials have been talking about the 
need for a naturalist to watch over it. However, they were frustrated by 
difficulties in acquiring the marsh and getting the naturalist's position 
through the budget process. 
</P>
<P>
The man who was chosen -- dressed in faded blue jeans, running shoes, an aged 
white sweater and a pair of spectacles hanging from his neck -- seemed at home 
among the grass, willows and tules of Madrona Marsh during a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
Wright expects to spend many hours studying the home of nearly 140 species of 
birds, a small pack of foxes and an occasional rabbit, as well as mice, snakes, 
lizards and frogs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lots of Tree Frogs 
</P>
<P>
"The marsh has more tree frogs than I've seen anywhere," he said. "I mean there 
are just thousands of frogs." 
</P>
<P>
Wright said his first priority is to supervise a cleanup, starting with large 
pieces of concrete and dried tar, which have been left from a past oil drilling 
project. He also wants to get rid of trash that has accumulated around the 
perimeter of the marsh, and remove hundreds of yards of rusted chain-link 
fence, which runs within the perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
Over the long term, Wright said he will work to create permanent walking trails 
throughout the marsh and improve the landscaping around the perimeter by adding 
new fencing, trees and shrubbery. In addition, the city is in the process of 
completing a sidewalk, bicycle trail and new perimeter fence. 
</P>
<P>
Before moving to Torrance, Wright worked for a year as a naturalist for the 
U.S. Forest Service in the Angeles National Forest during his college days. In 
1978, he began a decade of working as a wildlife and environmental consultant, 
mostly for government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
He examined the impact of wild burros on vegetation at the China Lake Naval 
Weapons Center in the Mojave Desert. He studied the habitat of the fringe-toed 
sand lizard in the Coachella Valley. In 1983, he designed a rehabilitation plan 
for a colony of great blue herons that had lost their nesting place to a U.S. 
Navy steam plant in San Diego. In 1984, he plotted the habitat of the 
flat-tailed horned lizard in El Centro. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diverse Interests 
</P>
<P>
"Having taken a wide diversity of classes in school -- and just my interest -- 
has enabled me to do a lot of different type of projects," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, who will earn $28,000 a year, said he intends to continue consulting. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Barnett, the city's parks and recreation director, first recommended in 
August, 1981, that the city hire a naturalist to run and maintain the 43-acre 
wetland. But it was not until September, 1986, that the city gained ownership 
of the land. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance Mayor Katy Geissert said the position was placed on the city's budget 
last year, and it has taken several months to add the new position to the 
staff. "It's the system," she said in explaining why it has taken so long. 
</P>
<P>
Geissert added that she hopes that hiring Wright will help the city move more 
swiftly toward improving conditions at the marsh. "He appears to be very well 
qualified," she said. "He is philosophically dedicated to the marsh." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Activists Were Anxious 
</P>
<P>
For several years, representatives of Friends of Madrona Marsh, an 
environmental group dedicated to the preservation of the marsh, have been 
critical of the city for failing to hire a naturalist. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that we were, at the very least, anxious," said Adrian Fraley, 
president of Friends of Madrona Marsh. 
</P>
<P>
Fraley, who expressed satisfaction with the city's choice, said she is 
confident that her group will work well with Wright, because he was a member of 
the group's board of directors from 1979 to 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"His background leads us to feel confident . . . to have someone in the city 
who knows the marsh and knows what the marsh needs," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The marsh was obtained by Torrance under a 1983 agreement with the developers 
of Park Del Amo, a massive residential and office project adjacent to the 
marsh. In the agreement, the developer won the right to build 1,482 residential 
units and 850,000-square-feet of office space in exchange for donating 34 1/2 
acres of marshland and selling an additional 8 1/2 acres to the city.

RESTAURANT REVIEW: DINNER ISN'T JUST FOOD AT BRAZIL UP -- IT'S A DIZZYING 
CARNIVAL OF CASUALNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here's an actual Brazilian word for you: fafaca. As far as I can tell, it means 
"when three or more people talk at the same time." Example: "And then there was 
a big fafaca." 
</P>
<P>
This is one lively, casual, pretty disorienting culture we're talking about. My 
personal theory is that its qualities go back to all the coffee Brazilians 
drink. They'll speak casually of having "a nice soothing cup of coffee before 
retiring" -- to help them go to sleep, that is. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil Up in West Hollywood gives something of the proper carnival effect. The 
walls are painted in swirling patterns like the famous sidewalks of Sao Paulo, 
only in blinding shades of yellow and white. There's a big TV on in one corner 
to justify Brazil Up's self-definition as a "Food Video Show," programmed on 
some basis that eludes me. 
</P>
<P>
And Brazil Up has certainly got the casualness thing down. Just about the only 
appetizer is empada, a cousin of the Spanish empanada. One day it's a little 
popover-like muffin with a tiny filling of chicken and hearts of palm; another 
day it's a regular muffin generously stuffed with chicken and onions flavored 
with parsley. 
</P>
<P>
The entrees are all named after Brazilian tourist attractions such as Ipanema 
and Copacabana, except for "Rio Samba," which is named after two tourist 
attractions, and Feijoada, which is actually the name of the dish. The entrees 
have a tendency to change daily too, unless I've just gotten my orders crossed 
on several occasions. 
</P>
<P>
For instance: A new addition to the menu is frango con guiabo, a simple, 
enjoyable dish of chicken stewed with okra in a little tomato sauce. It's a 
little hard to tell it from Corcovado, which as I had it was chicken stewed 
with okra in a little tomato sauce (and with none of the "golden potatoes" the 
menu speaks of). I did notice that when I ordered Corcovado, the woman behind 
the counter told the cook "galinha," which is simply the word for chicken. 
</P>
<P>
No problem. I ordered a chicken dish, I got a chicken dish. I do wonder whether 
there is actually a separate dish called Corcovado and what those golden 
potatoes are. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise in the beef department. "Ipanema" is chunks of beef shish kebab with 
peas, carrots and onions, served with rice and the bland, crumbly tropical 
starch called farofa (according to the menu, that is; I'd swear I got mashed 
potato in this instance). Another day I ordered "Copacabana," which was 
supposed to be fried breaded beef, but it turned out to be beef shish kebab 
again, only juicier this time, with spicier peas and carrots. It was terrific. 
</P>
<P>
I should add that when I ordered "Carioca," it was, as advertised, fried 
breaded fish, and that "Rio Samba" was definitely chicken stewed with onion 
rings, peas and tomatoes, dashed with vinegar, as the menu promised. True, the 
menu says you get either rice or mashed potatoes with it, but somehow I got 
both. 
</P>
<P>
 Feijoada, the Brazilian national dish, is basically rice and black beans with 
whichever and however many garnishes you feel like adding. As I had it, the 
beans contained some big chunks of stewed beef and some bits of sausage. The 
garnishes were farofa, that tropical starch of ground manioc root, fried with 
bacon. There was also a wonderful crisp fried leaf vegetable, possibly kale, 
bright green and slightly tart, and some chunks of peeled orange, of course. 
</P>
<P>
The desserts have the same shifting quality as the entrees, but they are 
unusually good. The best is doce de leite, made by cooking condensed milk until 
it caramelizes -- more or less a smooth-serve version of caramel candy. Doce de 
coco is a homemade chocolate candy, and there's the usual Latin American guava 
conserve dessert, goiabada, which sometimes comes with cheese, sometimes 
without. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes there are stranger things, though. There might be doce de aborboro, a 
sort of pudding that consists of pureed winter squash flavored with coconut, or 
maybe pineapple or zucchini-raisin bran muffins. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil Up is applying for a beer and wine license. In the meantime, the only 
beverages it has are coffee, flavored mineral waters and a Brazilian soft drink 
said to be made from a fruit called guarana, which tastes like a cherry. The 
name of the drink is Antarctica, which makes enough sense for me. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggested dishes: empada, $1.25; Ipanema (beef brochette), $5.75; Rio Samba 
(chicken), $4.75; doce de leite, 85 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil Up, 8276 Santa Monica Blvd., West Hollywood. (213) 654-8406. Open for 
lunch from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and dinner from 5 to 10 p.m., till 11 p.m. Friday 
and Saturday. No alcoholic beverages. Street parking and parking in rear. No 
credit cards. Dinner for two, food only, $13 to $16.

ONCE-REMOTE BOX CANYON BEING PRIED OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some communities boast that "George Washington slept here." Box Canyon, a rocky 
hideaway west of Chatsworth, is doing its best to forget that mass murderer 
Charles Manson spent time there. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Manson was just passing through in the late 1960s, freeloading for 
three days off a religious cult that fed and sheltered transients. The 
community's notorious reputation as a haven for criminals and iconoclasts was 
really created by other miscreants, such as the two cult members who blew up 
themselves and seven others in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Box Canyon is struggling to put its checkered past aside. But the 
community and its new breed of residents -- affluent professionals attracted by 
its proximity to the San Fernando Valley -- are finding that the path to 
becoming the next Laurel Canyon can be as rocky as its hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
"What's happening is that Box Canyon is getting propelled -- kicking and 
screaming -- into the 20th Century," said Ian Brodie, one of Ventura County's 
two code enforcement officers. "It's the last frontier." 
</P>
<P>
What is causing all the fuss is a crackdown by county officials on substandard 
housing and junk that have turned Box Canyon into a hodgepodge of homes, 
ranging from a castle to a converted water tower. 
</P>
<P>
In a clash reminiscent of a range war, code enforcement officers responding to 
complaints about violations say they've been shot at and had their tires 
slashed. Those who have filed the complaints, many of whom are newcomers trying 
to protect property values, say they have received threatening phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
The county's cleanup effort has sparked so much resentment from some longtime 
residents that they have added signs -- an example says, "This property is 
protected by shotgun law" -- to the plethora of "no trespassing" warnings on 
dirt roads leading to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly what Box Canyon will look like when the dust settles is unclear because 
officials say they are too short-handed to consistently enforce laws regarding 
proper housing construction and land-use. 
</P>
<P>
But what is clear is that longtime residents do not plan to give in easily. 
</P>
<P>
Vows one 26-year-old waitress who grew up in the area and lives in a 
12-foot-wide, two-story metal water tower that resembles a tin can with windows 
and doors: "We were here first. They're trying to turn it into a place for rich 
people, but this is our canyon." 
</P>
<P>
Other residents of the growing community of about 700 say they welcome the 
cleanup effort and are confident that this will be the last conflict in the 
area's history, which includes the Manson visit, the bombing and another murder 
on land owned by the religious cult. As indications of change, they point to 
homes under construction and the transformation of a tavern once called 
"Hillbilly Haven" into an upscale steakhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a matter of time before things get better and people stop thinking 
that Manson lived here in the late '60s when he really lived over the hill at 
Spahn Ranch in Chatsworth," said Beverly Patterson, 39, who bought Box Canyon's 
castle for $440,000 about a year ago. "Those stories and all the junk really 
detract from property values." 
</P>
<P>
The gray castle, which was built in the mid-1940s by a postal worker, has two 
turrets and a dungeon and sits atop a cypress-lined driveway on six acres 
overlooking the canyon. It offers a perfect view of the spacious homes and 
shacks below -- and of the abandoned cars and other trash in some residents' 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Just about the time the castle was being built, Box Canyon was going through 
its first major transition -- from a weekend resort founded in 1923 to a 
residential enclave, said C. D. (Speed) Glanton, one of the area's longtime 
residents. Glanton, 84, purchased several lots in the canyon shortly before the 
Depression for $25 apiece and ran its first water company until 1964. 
</P>
<P>
He still lives in the four-room, aluminum-sided home he built in 1933 
overlooking the Valley, but his six acres are now worth at least $20,000 an 
acre, said Bob Wood, a real estate agent in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Property values throughout the three-mile-long canyon have skyrocketed in 
recent years, even though the county limits development to a range of one house 
per half-acre to one per 40 acres, depending on the property's location, said 
Todd Collart, zoning administration supervisor. The restrictions were imposed 
primarily because the canyon's steep topography and deep sandstone floor make 
it hard to install adequate septic systems, Collart said. 
</P>
<P>
But some residents have flouted the law and built whatever they pleased -- 
largely because of the area's relative remoteness from the rest of Ventura 
County, Collart said. 
</P>
<P>
Box Canyon got its name because it literally formed a box and could be reached 
only from Chatsworth until 1942, when the road running through it was extended 
northward. It remained a world of its own until the Simi Valley Freeway was 
built and Chatsworth began developing into a bedroom community. 
</P>
<P>
The canyon's charms, including rosy sandstone rock formations honeycombed with 
caves, attracted a religious sect known as WKFL Fountain of the World, which 
founded a commune there in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
Led by Krishna Venta, a one-time boilermaker once jailed for issuing fictitious 
checks, the cultists wore white robes and quietly pursued their beliefs for 
about 10 years. Then, in 1958, two jealous husbands who believed that the 
leader was sleeping with their wives set off a bomb, killing Venta, themselves 
and six others, and thrusting the canyon into the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
"You could hear the explosion clear over in Camarillo," said Lt. Hank Carillo 
of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department. "People 20 miles away thought it 
was a sonic boom." 
</P>
<P>
The canyon's notoriety increased in 1974 when American Indian Movement 
activists living on the cult's land were charged and later acquitted of 
murdering a cabdriver and stuffing his body down a drainpipe. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll always remember Box Canyon as the place where I was lowered down 
headfirst into the well to retrieve the body," said Braden McKinley, a former 
sheriff's deputy who is chief investigator for the Ventura County district 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, code enforcement officers have been fighting a tamer sort of 
criminal activity. In response to complaints from homeowners, they have cited 
several property owners for a variety of violations, ranging from unsafe 
electrical wiring to converting an outhouse into living quarters. Some 
residents have been forced to tear down their homes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm heartbroken that I had to move out of my house and into my station wagon," 
said Tracy Bassett, a 24-year-old construction worker who was ordered recently 
by a Ventura Municipal Court judge to demolish a two-story plywood home he 
built on top of a 12-by-12-foot outhouse. The home was "a beautiful pad," 
Bassett said, but was too small to ever conform to building code regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of small," Bassett said. "But it was like a fort, like a little 
playhouse." 
</P>
<P>
Other residents have been prosecuted after failing to respond to warning 
notices. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Shiver, a longtime resident who owns about 100 acres in the canyon, was 
convicted in December in Ventura Municipal Court of two misdemeanor counts of 
violating the county's open-storage laws on a hilltop parcel strewn with farm 
machinery and other items. Offered the choice of going to County Jail or 
accepting the conditions of probation, which included unannounced inspections 
of his property, Shiver, a 52-year-old Korean War veteran, chose jail. 
</P>
<P>
After spending two days behind bars, Shiver appealed the case to Ventura County 
Superior Court and was released pending a hearing this spring. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people up in this canyon who can't be at peace until they rob 
everyone of their constitutional rights to use their land the way they want," 
said Shiver, a retired handyman and construction worker. "Your land is your 
life. I would teach someone how to make a pipe bomb to protect their rights." 
</P>
<P>
Although Brodie and his partner Sheldon Klain say Shiver has been courteous to 
them, skirmishes with other residents have made them wary of citing alleged 
violators without bringing along sheriff's deputies or carrying weapons, which 
they are prohibited from doing. 
</P>
<P>
Hand-held radios used to contact law enforcement agencies in case of 
emergencies do not always work well in the canyon, adding to their concerns 
about their safety, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm no 98-pound weakling, but I get a little nervous up here," Brodie said. 
"What people don't understand is that we come up here on a complaint-only basis 
because my partner and I are responsible for 42,000 parcels of unincorporated 
county land. We don't look for problems." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies said that except for occasional reports of gunfire or loud 
parties, crime is low these days in Box Canyon. And although residents say they 
have received threatening phone calls, they have not formally notified the 
Sheriff's Department, said Deputy James Lee Morris, who patrols the area. 
</P>
<P>
Several people who spoke on condition that they not be identified said callers 
threatened to firebomb their homes or take other retaliatory measures should 
the complaints continue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's intimidating," said one woman, who has lived in the canyon since the late 
1970s and refused to give her name for fear of retaliation. "But we're not 
giving up. A long time ago, everyone up here did whatever they wanted, but the 
area has changed. We pay taxes and have to conform to the codes, so why 
shouldn't everyone else?" 
</P>
<P>
Other longtime residents fear that they might become targets of the code 
enforcement crackdown and are "scared to death . . . that they are going to end 
up homeless," said John Hand, 48, who manages some rental properties in the 
canyon. 
</P>
<P>
He said many residents cannot afford to bring their homes up to code and added 
that some dwellings may be exempt from regulations because they were built 
before the county's codes were written in the late 1940s. Brodie said that may 
be true in some instances, but if structures have been modified since then -- 
as most have -- they must conform with the regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Glanton considers the county's demands excessive. 
</P>
<P>
He wants to pave a dirt road leading to his property because he said he is too 
old to refill potholes by hand as he has done in previous springs. But the 
county told him that the road had to be widened for fire trucks, "which is 
impossible" and would cost a fortune, he said. "I didn't build that road in the 
'30s for fire engines, I built it for my Model A Ford." 
</P>
<P>
While Hand and others decry what they see as county interference, even they 
tend to be pessimistic about being able to withstand the pressure to change. 
The "flatlanders" will eventually take over Box Canyon as they have other 
canyons, Hand said. 
</P>
<P>
"Look what happened to Laurel Canyon -- the money moved in, and the ambiance . 
. . disappeared."

We were on the east flank of Mt. Kilimanjaro -- at 19,342 feet the highest 
mountain in Africa. In the pre-dawn hours I locked my eyes onto the heels of 
our guide, clamping my wool cap low on my head, placing a bandanna around my 
face and tightening my jacket hood to ward off the chill. 
</P>
<P>
The silence of the moonless, sub-freezing night was broken only by the scrunch 
of our boots on the scree switchback; but for the meager flashlight beam of our 
guide, Minja, my husband Jim and I might have been lost on this trail that 
leads, via a tortuous series of switchbacks, into the African heavens. Ahead of 
us, the headlamps of another group appeared like a string of fireflies. Rock 
parapets spilling out from the crater rim loomed above our heads. If we were to 
make the rim, let alone the summit, we had to climb far above those parapets -- 
an interminable feat at our creeping pace. 
</P>
<P>
Always there was the concern of returning home without having reached the 
summit. We had come to Africa to climb Kilimanjaro, the dormant volcano located 
some 200 miles south of the Equator on the border between Kenya and Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
Although professional climbers sometimes scoff at the mountain as being 
"technically unchallenging," the altitude and cold -- as many of our companions 
discovered -- proved otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
For Jim and me, dilettante backpackers and runners, the five-day, 52-mile 
Kilimanjaro ascent was a test of will and endurance. It is not, we learned, an 
adventure for timid souls. Our assault had begun from Moshi, a small town 
wreathed by coffee and banana plantations at the base of the massif. 
</P>
<P>
Most climbers stay the first night in the mountainside village of Marangu at 
either the Marangu Hotel, a converted farm run by two Englishwomen, or the Kibo 
Hotel, the bar of which is plastered with insignias of mountaineering groups 
from all over the world. Unfortunately, both hotels were booked, so we signed 
in at the Moshi Hotel in town. 
</P>
<P>
Built by the British in the late 1940s, the Moshi Hotel bears its 
pre-independence name -- the Livingstone Hotel -- in large stucco letters on 
the cornice. The British tradition of hospitality lingers: Waiters snapped to 
attention with the same alacrity as the electric fly-zapper in the corner of 
the dining room. 
</P>
<P>
Kilimanjaro is a Tanzanian national park, and each climbing party is required 
to have a guide who in turn provisions and cooks for the expedition. We met 
Minja the morning of our departure. Our staples consisted of a slab of beef, 
loaves of bread, heads of cabbage, carrots, potatoes, tomatoes, butter, eggs 
and tea. Like most Kilimanjaro climbers, we elected to do the ascent Himalayan 
style, with porters carrying all but day packs. Our food and gear were loaded 
into an ancient Land Rover for the one-hour drive through lush plantations and 
steep river valleys to the park entrance. Throngs of women and children wrapped 
in brilliant hand-dyed cloth streamed along the roadside. 
</P>
<P>
Since the 1840s, when missionaries and geologists began trying to climb 
Kilimanjaro, mountaineering has become a major source of income and employment 
for the region. Boys begin as porters, working their way up through a finely 
graduated hierarchy to become park-certified guides. These are relatively 
lucrative positions, the for the hard currency that foreigners spend represents 
more than twice the buying power of the highly inflated Tanzanian shilling due 
to the black market exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The entrance to the park was crowded with Americans, Japanese, Australians and 
Europeans, some seeking climbing permits, others returning from successful (or 
abortive) attempts to reach Kilimanjaro's summit. Permits are available on a 
walk-in basis at the park entrance. There is a danger of not getting one -- 
especially in August when the mountain is so crowded. Even having a permit 
doesn't always guarantee you'll get on the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Although Jim and I were climbing alone with Minja and our four porters, we 
would be eating and sleeping with about 60 other climbers who gathered at the 
camps at day's end. Located a day's walk apart -- at 9,000, 12,500, and 15,500 
feet -- each camp had primitive sleeping huts, outhouses and a central dining 
hall. 
</P>
<P>
The first leg of the expedition was a 5-mile climb through a rain forest that 
girdles Kilimanjaro at 6,000 to 9,500 feet. (The Kilimanjaro massif rises out 
of a plain that is about 3,500 feet above sea level. The park entrance is at 
6,000 feet.) This portion of the mountain is almost perpetually covered with 
dense, low-lying clouds below which lichen- and creeper-shrouded trees and 
grasses have adapted to life with little sunlight. Soon we were alone with only 
the occasional caterwaul of a monkey breaking the misty silence. 
</P>
<P>
Midway, the broad path turned into a dark, narrow stairway of roots and mud. 
Porters clad in rubber thongs, tattered clothes and hand-me-down hats scrambled 
past us, balancing enormous loads on their heads. 
</P>
<P>
At nightfall, our first campsite -- Mandara Hut, named after the Chagga king 
who aided the first mountaineers -- emerged from the mists. Packed cheek by 
jowl in the A-frame dining hall, we quickly made friends with the other 
climbers: a German professor who teaches wildlife management in the Sudan; two 
Norwegians; a Frenchman who had trekked in Nepal; an American who worked in 
Ethiopia, and three Spaniards who intended to hang-glide from the summit. 
</P>
<P>
On our climb the next morning we broke through the upper reaches of the rain 
forest onto a grassy, rolling savanna, passed another hillock and caught our 
first glimpse of the 16,000-foot Mawensi, the younger, though far more 
weathered companion peak to Kibo, the main crater of Kilimanjaro. Grasses gave 
way to exotic alpine desert flowers and shrubs that have adapted to the extreme 
temperature and humidity changes of the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
So far the day was a pleasant stroll and not too challenging. Fifteen minutes 
after our arrival at Horombo (at 12,500 feet), our warm glow had turned to cold 
sweat, with our warm clothes and food an hour behind with the porters. That 
evening, the clouds that had swathed the upper reaches of Kibo from mid-morning 
to late afternoon lifted and we saw the snow-covered summit rising about 7,000 
feet in the distance. After nightfall, we had a panoramic view of the 
unfamiliar stars of the Southern Hemisphere and the lights of Moshi 9,000 feet 
below. 
</P>
<P>
Because the camp was full, Jim and I had to sleep in separate four-person huts. 
Jim bunked with the Norwegians, while I joined the hang-gliding Spaniards, who 
regaled me with tales of their adventures. 
</P>
<P>
On the third day the landscape changed again, radically. Midway through our 
six-mile climb to Kibo Hut, the alpine desert vegetation gave way to gray, red 
and brown lichen. At the wide saddle between the Mawensi and Kibo craters even 
the lichen disappeared, leaving an eerie, barren wasteland of brown rock. 
</P>
<P>
Other than the monkeys in the rain forest and an assortment of birds and 
butterflies, we had seen little wildlife on the mountain, although years 
earlier elephants, Cape buffalo and antelope had been sighted on the saddle. 
Indeed, in 1951, one misguided elephant was found at 16,000 feet, and in 1926 
mountaineers spotted a frozen leopard just inside Kibo crater. 
</P>
<P>
Arriving at Kibo Hut, we staked out bunks and promptly crawled into our 
sleeping bags. We were at 15,500 feet. Because of the altitude, my head was 
aching, and I was popping Tylenol like candy. Meanwhile, there was concern 
about our water supply. The higher we climbed, the more likely dehydration was 
to occur. Dehydration might lead to altitude sickness. Up to the last water 
stop, we had forced ourselves to each drink six quarts of water a day. 
</P>
<P>
Now our water supply was limited. 
</P>
<P>
Minja woke us for an early dinner, after which we fell asleep again, woozy due 
to the thin air. Minja insisted that we start our final climb by 1:30 a.m. in 
order to avoid the midday cloud cover. Afterward, we would have to descend to 
Horombo Hut, which meant an 18-mile hike, up and back again to the hut. 
</P>
<P>
The porters appeared with hot tea at 12:30 a.m. By now several of our group had 
become nauseated and had decided to go no farther; they would descend at dawn. 
Shortly after 1 a.m., Jim and I set off for the summit. 
</P>
<P>
After a couple of hours we reached a cave named after Hans Meyer, an 
indefatigable German geologist who was the first known climber to reach the 
summit in 1889. (In World War I a troop of German soldiers, trapped behind 
relentlessly advancing British troops, surrendered at the cave after having 
hidden out on the mountain for eight months). 
</P>
<P>
But now, trudging in the darkness behind Minja's heels, our energy was ebbing. 
Minja's cautions to walk pole, pole (Swahili for slowly) were hardly necessary. 
I was weak and dizzy. 
</P>
<P>
The higher we climbed, the more frequently I had to stop to gather my strength. 
Jim gently prodded me on. Finally, the two scenes I was longing for -- sunrise 
and the crater rim -- converged. With intense excitement, we scrambled up the 
last 400 feet of boulders to the 18,640-foot mark and the crater rim, known as 
Gilman's Point. 
</P>
<P>
It was 6:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
With great relief, we crawled onto a large rock rosy with dawn and took in the 
view. Mawensi was spread out some 2,000 feet below us. Beyond that, we focused 
on a cloud cover with breaks that offered glimpses of the African savanna far 
beneath. Inside the mile-wide crater, glaciers blanketed obsidian rock and 
formed a mammoth staircase of ice and snow on the eastern perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
The true summit -- formerly Kaiser Wilhelm Spitze and rechristened Uhuru -- was 
still a 1 1/2-hour hike. The equatorial sun was out in full force when we 
finally reached the rock on the western rim that marks the highest point on the 
African continent. 
</P>
<P>
Jim and I hugged each other and Minja shook our hands. I'd always heard of the 
exhilaration of surveying the panorama after conquering this mountain . . . but 
to me the real thrill was my victory -- of spirit over flesh. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Kilimanjaro climbers can go for the summit on a five- or six-day trip or 
spend a day or so wandering trails on the lower reaches. The best time is 
during the July-to-October and January-to-February dry seasons. August is the 
most crowded month on the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
A number of American adventure travel companies, including Mountain Travel 
Inc., 1398-M Solano Ave. Albany, Calif. 94706, telephone (415) 527-8100; 
Overseas Adventure Travel, 349 Broadway, Cambridge, Mass. 02139, telephone 
(800) 221-0814, and Adventure Center, 5540-A College Ave., Oakland 94618, 
telephone (800) 227-8747 or (415) 654-1879, offer Kilimanjaro as a seven-day 
adjunct to their African safaris. Costs range from $700 to $800 per person, 
including transportation from Nairobi and accommodations in Marangu. Those 
traveling on their own can make arrangements to climb the mountain through the 
Marangu Hotel, P.O. Box 40, Marangu, Tanzania, or the Kibo Hotel, P.O. Box 102, 
Marangu, Tanzania. Both hotels arrange for climbing permits, guides, porters 
and food for $350 to $400 per person, which also includes a two-night stay at 
the hotel. (A number of Nairobi tour operators offer Kilimanjaro safaris 
through their Tanzanian affiliates). 
</P>
<P>
Climbers can contract with guides and porters directly at the park entrance. 
However, theft, overpricing and insufficient food are dangers, so it would be 
best to work through one of the hotels or a reputable tour operator. 
</P>
<P>
Getting to Kilimanjaro can be expensive and time-consuming. Nairobi tour 
operators charge as much as $250 per person, one way, for the 200-mile drive 
across Masai country from Nairobi. Travelers with a sense of adventure and 
somewhat flexible schedules can take a taxi from Nairobi to the Tanzanian 
border for about $8 per person. (Kenyan vehicles are prohibited in Tanzania and 
vice versa.) 
</P>
<P>
From the border, one travels (also by taxi and also $8 per person) to Arusha in 
northern Tanzania. Buses packed with local riders run regularly between Arusha 
and Moshi for about 50 cents per person. (Beware of pickpockets.) 
</P>
<P>
British Air, KLM, Ethiopian and Pakistan Airlines fly into Kilimanjaro 
International Airport. Still, there is only one flight a week between 
Kilimanjaro and Nairobi. 
</P>
<P>
Nighttime temperatures on the mountain can fall to zero degrees Fahrenheit, and 
rain is common even in the dry season. Plan to bring along a sleeping bag and 
parka, hiking boots, long underwear, wool cap, mittens, walking shorts, rain 
gear and wind pants. A wide-brimmed hat is essential, as is plenty of 
sunscreen. A one-quart water bottle is another must, and so are 
water-purification tablets. 
</P>
<P>
Stuff your belongings into a sturdy, waterproof duffel bag. Bring along a day 
pack for carrying your camera, water, Windbreaker, passport, money, etc. Keep 
the last two items with you at all times.

A CARIBBEAN CONNOISSEUR EXPLORES THE PLEASURES AND PANACHE OF ST. KITTS, 
BEQUIA, ST. VINCENT, DOMINICA, ST. LUCIA, AND OTHER KINDER, GENTLER OFFBEAT 
RETREATS 
</P>

ST. KITTS: 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After months at sea in 1493, Christopher Columbus spotted Mount Misery and 
likened it to his patron, St. Christopher, bearing the Christ Child upon his 
shoulders. The first settlers, the Brits, soon turned Christopher to Kitts. St. 
Kitts and neighboring Nevis became a two-island nation within the British 
Commonwealth. 
</P>
<P>
On arrival by sea or by air (Golden Rock Airport is a mile from Basseterre, the 
capital), do not stop at the sugar factory; do not collect batiks at Romney 
Manor. Go directly to The Golden Lemon at Dieppe Bay for tea (or pina coladas) 
under the breadfruit tree, your very own canopied four-poster bed, and the 
savoir-faire of far niente in style. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Lemon combines 18th-Century great-house atmosphere with 20th-Century 
chic, as overseen by Arthur Leaman, a former decorating editor of House &amp; 
Garden magazine. Nothing about its 18 guest rooms, however, is fussy or slick; 
instead there is tasteful comfort and respect for detail. Flop like a seal onto 
the black sand beach, bite into a tasty spiny-lobster quiche, stow your worries 
in an antique armoire, murmur lagniappe to yourself as you loll under a waving 
palm. 
</P>
<P>
Sooner or later, curses, the connoisseur's conscience turns to thoughts of 
learning something. On St. Kitts, that's well and easily done by detouring to 
the west around the top of the island and sliding southward through Sandy Point 
Town to Brimstone Hill Fortress. 
</P>
<P>
Brimstone is an outcrop of five bastions capped by Fort George (also known as 
the Citadel) atop a hill, 800 feet high, that affords a wide-angle view of six 
islands (Nevis, Montserrat, Saba, Statia, St. Martin, St. Barts). 
</P>
<P>
The British made St. Kitts their first settlement in the West Indies in 1623 
and were pursued (as usual) by the French in 1625. Then ensued the 100 Years 
War in miniature, leading to (as a restoration bulletin has it) "bloodshed, 
strife, misunderstandings, fighting and follies of a long-gone age." 
</P>
<P>
One day, take the 40-minute ferry ride to Charlestown on neighboring Nevis to 
visit the Alexander Hamilton House where that patriot was born (illegitimately) 
in 1757; Montpelier House, where the young widow Fanny Nisbet married Capt. 
Horatio Nelson in 1787; and Eden Brown Estate, where a bridegroom and his best 
man were mortally wounded on a long-ago wedding eve. Their ghosts, like 
everything and everybody on Nevis, rest quietly; the only real happening on the 
island is sunset. 
</P>
<P>
DOMINICA: This is the tropics primordial, the feathery palms and the sea 
grapes. This was the home of the cannibalistic Caribs, wild warriors whose few 
descendants live on in six isolated village reserves, weaving baskets and 
turning out harmless trinkets for a few curious visitors. Do they remember the 
glory days of the 18th Century when from their dense forest hide-outs they 
terrorized the French and British and drove (with their poisoned arrows) even 
mighty Columbus away? Who knows? 
</P>
<P>
Something about Dominica (pronounce it Dough-me-NEE-kah) makes you turn about 
to see who or what walks is walking behind you, particularly as you amble along 
the ancient trace that leads to Emerald Pool in Morne Trois Pitons National 
Park. Things are growing on things: anthuriums on the arms of trees; ferns on 
the bodies of fallen giants decaying back into the earth from which they arose; 
strangling liana on any likely host. 
</P>
<P>
If you are wide awake and lucky, you may spy the rare sisserou or imperial 
parrot (Amazona imperialis) and its friend, the jacquot or red-necked parrot 
(Amazone arausiaca), both of which live only on little Dominica; and if the 
gods really smile, you may hear the notes of the solitaire bird, whose song is 
said to suggest the opening of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. Alas, the gods were 
looking the other way when I was there. 
</P>
<P>
No homes of movie stars yet stud the intense green heights of Dominica; no 
hotels tower taller than mahogany trees. The cricket pitch at Portsmouth seems 
a wild anachronism. 
</P>
<P>
One afternoon I sat on the manicured (for a wonder) greensward of the Layou 
Valley Inn (above the valley in the foothills of the Morne Trois Pitons) and 
sipped dark rum while beautiful young men and women (as gorgeously gaudy in 
dress as those of Guadeloupe) strummed and danced and sang in a moving melange 
of English and Creole and (I pretended) Carib. 
</P>
<P>
ST. LUCIA: Admittedly, this papaya-shaped landfall (pronounce it 
Saint-LOO-shah) has its Uprising Disco, its Super Freaks Grocery Shop, its 
rattletrap buses named Say Hello and Sugar Daddy. Still, those are only rather 
endearing intrusions that rest lightly upon a natural magnificence of soaring 
and fuzzy green peaks, steaming and stinking sulfur pits, chattering bamboo 
forests, outbreaks of tropical plants as brilliant and clashing as colors 
inside a kaleidoscope, and the calm cove of Marigot Bay where the sands might 
have been patted into perfect shape by some enterprising child. 
</P>
<P>
When H. N. Coleridge wandered here in the 19th Century, he sought to civilize 
the whole in language, seeing the clouds as "silken veils," observing the 
pointed Pitons to be "like the famous spires of Coventry," and watching as "the 
wind and the sun will cause the whole to be drawn upwards majestically like the 
curtain of a gorgeous theater." 
</P>
<P>
Well, maybe; certainly someone has always tried to civilize this lush escape. 
It has endured 14 changes of occupation between the English and the French, but 
it boasts of being one of the few islands in this sea not discovered by 
Columbus; it was first mentioned by Ferdinand of Spain, who thought it might 
make a good base for warring against the Caribs. Today it maintains a tourist 
board that talks of "major infrastructure improvements" and "climate of 
tourism" and "shopping facilities." 
</P>
<P>
Nuts to that. I'd rather remember the road that swoops over banana-treed hills, 
offering views of the old fishing village of Anse La Raye far below, where 
fishermen work on nets and canoes drawn up on the eye-blinding beach; the 
downward plunge from Moule-a-Chique, where the blue-green Caribbean meets the 
windblown Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
St. Lucia is as difficult to pin down as a hummingbird. Just when you fear its 
essence is becoming Denros rum mixed with the Splash disco (formerly 
Lucifer's), it counters with solitude, simplicity and river-washed clothing 
bleaching in the sun near the village of Canaries. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, yes: Take a jump up, Demon Rum Dinner at Rain, in the unpicturesque, 
concrete capital of Castries. 
</P>
<P>
BEQUIA: Here is where I sought to pronounce the place and so inquired of the 
first local I spotted, "Is it BECK-wee with the sound of e, or BECK-way with 
the sound of a ?" 
</P>
<P>
"B-E-C-K-w-a-y ," she spelled. "Pronounced BECK-wee." 
</P>
<P>
Bequia is a dot among the Grenadines, some 100 island upthrusts floating south 
of St. Vincent, an independent island of British inheritance that the dots 
consider "the mainland." 
</P>
<P>
Curious signs along back roads (and there is scarcely anything else) call 
themselves to your attention on Bequia: "All animals must be tied by Monday or 
they will be shot," and the considerably less ferocious, "Chicken on sale 
Sundays to friends." 
</P>
<P>
Although Bequia is proud to be the largest Grenadine, it spreads out over a 
mere 7 square miles and can be reached only by yacht or regular boat service 
from St. Vincent. Flowering almond trees and net-mending fishermen welcome 
arrivals to once-pirate-ridden Admiralty Bay and to the main jetty right off 
the beach that is really the main thoroughfare of Port Elizabeth, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
Bequia sheltered the Arawak Indians until the rapacious Caribs drove them away. 
Here, as elsewhere, French fought British fought Caribs for 200 years, until in 
1783 the Treaty of Versailles made Bequia resolutely British. 
</P>
<P>
On a day when nothing but a picnic seems plausible, you can provisions yourself 
at the New Jersey Bar and Grocery and set off down the beach, or rent a car 
and/or driver for strands farther out: Friendship Bay or Princess Margaret. On 
the other hand, you might prefer to amble along to Lower Bay beach and the Reef 
restaurant, where with shoes off you can munch on soused conch or lobster, or 
(if you insist) a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
One of the world's last whaling stations operates on Bequia, where the great 
beasts still are captured occasionally, and then by hand-held harpoons. (IS 
THIS CQ? WHALES IN CARIBBEAN?) (When I visited, however, not long ago, the 
last, grizzled harpooner looked as though he might soon go the way of Captain 
Ahab.) 
</P>
<P>
The smartest hideaway on this secluded isle is secluded even from Port 
Elizabeth: Friendship Bay Resort. The bungalow village of Bequia Beach Club 
caters in the main to underwater explorers who have come to dive among rainbows 
of fishes or to coral-encrusted, sunken wrecks. I quite like the Frangipani, a 
small and informal place just a beach walk from town, but do insist upon 
reservations in the new stone and hardwood rooms with full baths and sun decks. 
</P>
<P>
Bequia soothes your spine, calms your tensions and indeed may sap you of the 
strength to leave. A jumpy, compulsive friend was reduced within one day to 
drawling, "I guess I'll just go down to the beach and lean against that tree." 
</P>
<P>
ST. VINCENT: This island gets a little cute at times (what is one to make of 
Noah's Arkade, for example?), and, compared to laid-back Bequia, it assumes an 
almost metropolitan busyness. Over there, freighters load bananas; here 
merchants hawk every edible from breadfruit to yams. 
</P>
<P>
Buses with names such as Vaya Con Dios and The Upsetter racket along 
mountainous roads; steel bands thump and bounce; competitive visitors can try 
their hand (and coconut bat) on the cricket pitch or ride horseback, play 
squash at the Prospect Racquet Club, hike the nature trails at Buccament 
Valley, whack at a tennis ball on dozens of courts, dive and fish and swim and 
sail and windsurf and play roulette at the Emerald Valley casino. Best night 
life means darts at the Dolphin pub. 
</P>
<P>
Even architecture gets into the action: St. Mary's is such a collision of 
Gothic, Moorish and Romanesque styles that it looks noisy. I call it St. Mary's 
of the Eccentricities. 
</P>
<P>
A meeting with St. Vincent should begin by getting yourself booked into a 
cottage on private Young Island, 200 yards and a pleasant swim or brief ferry 
ride from the "mainland." Young is dedicated to the principle of pleasures 
taken in tranquility. There is a nearly poetic prettiness to it all -- the 
flower-rimmed paths, the outdoor showers secluded in ferns, the thatched 
Coconut Bar floating in waist-high water, the colorful rooms that seduce you to 
sleep the afternoon away, the shaded hammocks on the sand, the torchlight 
cocktails. 
</P>
<P>
Then, just when you feel it's time to get up off your beach, the sights of St. 
Vincent await. The oldest Botanical Gardens in the Western Hemisphere present a 
trove of tropical flowers, shrubs and trees, including the descendant of a 
breadfruit plant brought to the island by Capt. William Bligh (he of the 
Bounty) in 1793. On garden grounds, the Archeological Museum shelters a superb 
collection of stone tools, pottery and artifacts from early Carib dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
Fort Charlotte dominates a ridge 600 feet above the sea. Stop briefly to 
inspect the paintings of the history of the Black Caribs, offspring of the men 
of a sunken slave ship who managed to swim to shore and intermingle with the 
Indians (1675). 
</P>
<P>
The energetic may wish to scale La Soufrire, a mighty volcano that last erupted 
in 1979. The rest of us will drive up through banana and coconut plantations 
and be glad we did. 
</P>
<P>
In aforementioned Mesopotamia (nobody but map makers calls it Marriaqua) 
Valley, bananas, nutmeg, cocoa, coconuts, breadfruit, eddoes, tannias , 
dasheene and other mysterious crops grow with an almost primitive fecundity, 
while rivers and streams pour out of the ridges and plunge over the rocks of 
Yambou Gorge and run into the sea. The word Eden comes -- unbidden -- to mind, 
though one is surely too sophisticated to say so. 
</P>
<P>
From Mesopotamia, climb to Montreal, of all places, a name on the map where you 
may be alone together with mineral springs, a restaurant, and a refreshing 
pool. 
</P>
<P>

It was one of those spiffy British limousines that dukes and duchesses and such 
ride in, and it scattered gravel like buckshot as it sped up the drive to 
Cliveden, Britain's most celebrated stately home. Waiting to fetch the luggage 
were Michael Holiday, the butler, and a retinue of footmen. Although his role 
is that of general manager, butler is the title given to Holiday, who, attired 
in the livery of a royal servant, would do justice to the staff at Buckingham 
Palace. Indeed, as would his impeccably dressed footmen. Inside the mansion 
with its splendors of a past century, Holiday surrendered his new guests to 
Cliveden's aristocratic managing director, the Hon. John Sinclair, who, with 
his American-born wife Marion waited in the Great Hall before an immense 
16th-Century fireplace. Polished mahogany walls shone brilliantly as Sinclair 
led the group on a tour, identifying paintings of Cliveden's former owners -- 
including Lady Astor -- and such celebrated guests as Queen Victoria, Edward 
VIII, Henry James, Henry Ford, Sarah Bernhardt, Lawrence of Arabia and H. G. 
Wells. These and myriad others. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Cliveden's 24 rooms and suites are named for famous guests who snoozed 
under its roof: Sir Winston Churchill, Lord Mountbatten, one of the Vanderbilts 
and the Countess of Shrewsbury, who is best remembered for having callously 
stood by while her paramour slew her husband in a duel. (The wench even held 
the reins of her lover's horse while he administered the coup de grace.) At any 
rate, the names of guests, celebrated and nefarious, go on. 
</P>
<P>
Dating from the 15th Century, Cliveden is not your ordinary stately mansion. 
Barely 30 miles outside London, Cliveden rises on a 375-acre estate near the 
village of Taplow, with the River Thames flowing by its door. Its gardens are 
magnificent. The service is without fault. Dignity is its hallmark. (As one 
visitor noted: "No chocolates on the pillow, no ribbons in the flowers, no 
sanitized bands around the loo.") At Cliveden a staff of 85 footmen, maids and 
servants stands ready to pack and unpack one's luggage, shine one's shoes, draw 
one's bath and otherwise pamper the dickens out of any wayfarer who ventures 
within its gates. For all this, a service charge is neither included nor 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
Not another shelter in all of Britain compares to Cliveden, the only stately 
home owned by the National Trust that operates as a hotel. There is no 
reception desk, no gift shop, no bar. Should one wish a libation, one rings for 
a footman. Faster than an Olympiad, the footman returns with a belt of good 
Scotch. Or whatever. High tea is an afternoon ritual of dignified tradition and 
surplus calories (finger sandwiches, scones, ginger cake, fruitcake, eclairs). 
Guest rooms are opulent. No two are alike. Priceless tapestries are displayed 
along with suits of armor but without diminishing the warmth and hospitality of 
this splendid retreat hidden in the heart of the Thames Valley. 
</P>
<P>
As the one-time home of a Prince of Wales and three dukes, Cliveden grew in 
stages, one of its architects being William Winde, who designed Buckingham 
Palace. Dating from 1666, it is a masterpiece of pomp that mesmerizes the most 
discriminating guest. William Waldorf Astor, the American-born statesman and 
publisher, bought Cliveden in 1893 and later passed it on to his son Waldorf as 
a wedding gift for the young man and his bride, Nancy, who was to become 
Britain's first woman member of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
At Cliveden, Lady Astor entertained lavishly. The famous appeared ceremoniously 
in the spotlight with surprising frequency. And though she loathed Winston 
Churchill, the statesman made her guest list on numerous occasions. They argued 
constantly. During one encounter Lady Astor is said to have remarked to 
Churchill, "If you were my husband I'd put poison in your coffee," to which 
Winnie responded, "If I were your husband, I'd drink it." 
</P>
<P>
Life indeed was lively at Cliveden. 
</P>
<P>
Told that Cliveden was to become a hotel, former British Prime Minister Harold 
Macmillan remarked: "Dear boy, that's what it always has been." Macmillan, of 
course, was referring to those lengthy periods during which the home was 
crowded with celebrities and statesmen, generally at the invitation of Lady 
Astor. Franklin Delano Roosevelt slept beneath its shingles as did Anthony 
Eden, Rudyard Kipling, George Bernard Shaw, Charlie Chaplin. Kings. Queens. It 
was always party time. 
</P>
<P>
Cliveden never fails to get raves. Its mahogany walls soar to lofty ceilings; 
its furnishings create a sense of relaxation. Panels gracing the French dining 
room were lifted from Mme. de Pompadour's Chateau d'Asnieres, and an immense 
staircase leads upstairs to guest rooms. Cliveden is a collage of carved oak, 
marbled pilasters, friezes and fluted Corinthian columns. Statuary and temples 
appear in the gardens, and dead center of the driveway stands the inspiring 
Fountain of Love with its marble shell and life-size figures. 
</P>
<P>
During Lady Astor's era, Ascot Week was observed with great crowds at Cliveden. 
Indeed, no other English country house has provided shelter to a greater number 
of notables. Even with the war, Cliveden remained a place of escape from the 
pressures of that period until 1942, when Cliveden was given over to the 
National Trust, which in turn made a deal in the early '80s with Blakeney 
Hotels to operate Cliveden as an exclusive retreat for guests with an 
appreciation for art, opulence and the rare opportunity to hark back to an era 
of British grandeur. 
</P>
<P>
Still, even with footmen in tails and the ghosts of departed aristocrats, 
Cliveden exudes the unusual warmth generally associated with less formal 
estates. A sense of total relaxation overcomes one the moment one enters the 
Great Hall. In the library guests sink into deep sofas, savoring quiet moments 
and the written word of famous authors. Dining room windows frame acres of 
grass with formal parterres and a morning mist that rises like the curtain on a 
scene that seems startlingly unreal. The River Thames is a backdrop, and guest 
rooms provide other vistas. The Countess of Shrewsbury's suite is a masterpiece 
of gilt mirrors, antiques, a magnificent bed and a marble fireplace. Every 
guest quarter has a fireplace, as do some bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
At Cliveden guests enjoy a swimming pool, squash and tennis courts (both indoor 
and outdoor), a games room, billiard room, card room, gymnasium, Turkish bath 
and sauna. Picnic lunches are packed in Edwardian hampers containing such 
delights as salmon and a terrine of lobster with sauce verte. And there are 
cruises down the Thames on the Suzy-Ann, a restored 1911 pinnace. Other guests 
have a go at fishing, water skiing and taking in the horse races, followed by 
peaceful moments inside the venerable mansion. Of an evening they gather for 
cocktails in the Great Hall, the Library and the Card Room. The drinks are 
stiff; the conversation is subdued. 
</P>
<P>
Cliveden is a scene of culture as well as relaxation. Music festivals are held 
intermittently. Peter Katin, the distinguished British pianist, joined an 
all-Schubert program last year. Only recently he returned to perform a Chopin 
recital. During Christmastime carolers and bell-ringers perform at the foot of 
the oak staircase whose banisters are festooned with garlands of box, yew, bay, 
ivy and holly. With a huge tree and logs blazing in the fireplace, the scene is 
pure magic. 
</P>
<P>
Breakfast at Cliveden is a medley of fruit, juices, sausage, bacon and eggs, 
smoked salmon, kippers and kidneys, porridge, French toast, croissants and 
brioches. At dinner time the chef turns out such delectables as salmon tartare, 
sweetbreads with Madeira sauce, a salad featuring roast quail, roasted 
hazelnuts and girolle mushrooms. He does wonders with monkfish with mustard 
sauce, crayfish, a Scotch filet steak, lamb and outrageously rich desserts, 
after which it's off to the library for coffee and another round of 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
To recall the joys of Cliveden, one may purchase robes designed especially for 
this stately home. There are enamel boxes by Crummels, soaps by Floris of 
Jermyn Street, decanters by Royal Brierley Crystal and linen sheets matching 
those between which one sleeps while a guest. 
</P>
<P>
Rates at Cliveden vary, depending on one's room or suite or particular 
arrangement made with management. A three-night stay in the Lady Astor Suite 
provides for the guest to be collected by chauffeured limousine and conveyed to 
Cliveden in time for afternoon tea, followed by Champagne cocktails and dinner. 
The second day is highlighted by breakfast in one's room and a supper cruise 
down the Thames to Windsor, where a limousine awaits to deliver the guest back 
to Cliveden for smoked salmon and Champagne before retiring. Day three is given 
over to sightseeing in the countryside and a "gastronomic tour de force" back 
at Cliveden. 
</P>
<P>
To be a guest at Cliveden is to be pampered, coddled and indulged beyond any 
hope of returning to the real world a satisfied soul. 
</P>
<P>
It is said that the ghosts of Churchill, Kipling, the Countess of Shrewsbury 
and others associated with Cliveden are beating at the gates of the hereafter 
in an effort to return. 
</P>
<P>
Be forewarned. 
</P>
<P>
If driving to Cliveden from London take the M4 or the M40, leaving the M4 at 
Junction 7 or the M40 at Junction 4. If coming by rail, board the train at 
Paddington Station and get off at Taplow or Maidenhead. Rates at Cliveden: A 
standard double room goes for 160; a deluxe double ranges from 190 to 215; 
suites are 265 to 565, breakfast and taxes included. For other details contact 
the hotel's U.S. representative, Scott Calder International, toll-free (800) 
223-5581. Or, write to Cliveden, Taplow Park, Berkshire SL6 OJF, England.

<TEXT>
<P>
When I was in the shower in the morning, the phone was ringing too many times. 
As I depend on phone calls for a living, I always welcome the sound and jump 
for the phone. Yet whenever it seems there are too many calls, I take it as a 
signal that I ought to take a small walk. 
</P>
<P>
When I came out of the shower, I looked out the windows. I live in a 
second-floor apartment on Central Park West in Manhattan, and the bedroom has 
three large windows, the one on my right looking out at the mid-town buildings 
that pierced, on this day, a cold midwinter sky, the other two windows looking 
straight out at the bare trees of Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
When I looked to the right, the buildings suddenly caused me to hear the subway 
rushing underneath the street, heels clicking rapidly on pavement, the rustle 
and murmur of crowds, horns sounding, trucks coughing and sirens, always 
sirens, in the city. Usually, when I throw on clothes to go to work for my 
newspaper, I look out this window. Big city, get going. 
</P>
<P>
But now I looked out the other two windows. As they are level with the trees 
across the street, you get the sensation of living in the woods. 
</P>
<P>
I looked out at the trees and I called to my wife, who was in the other room, 
"Do you want to go someplace?" 
</P>
<P>
"After the dentist?" 
</P>
<P>
"Forget the dentist. Let's go someplace right now." 
</P>
<P>
"To lunch?" 
</P>
<P>
"All right." 
</P>
<P>
"Where?" she called. 
</P>
<P>
I looked at the trees. "Nicaragua." 
</P>
<P>
She laughed. "Why there?" 
</P>
<P>
"Because I've never been there." 
</P>
<P>
I took the phone off the hook and grabbed shirts out of a drawer. My idea was 
to be packed and out of the room in 15 minutes. The few vacations I ever had 
started like this. One rush of nerves, get a suitcase and walk rapidly out of 
the room, out of the house, out of the city and go anywhere. If I have to pause 
for more than a moment to worry about where and how, I sit down and don't go. I 
know that all pleasure and health depends on surprises. I have been in 
newspapers for more than 30 years and know that it is the surprises you receive 
while covering the day's news that cause the body to tingle to the point that 
it excludes almost everything except excitement. 
</P>
<P>
I consider a vacation trip to be the same as looking for a story. Leave right 
now, and go someplace you don't know much about. That way, even the airport is 
a surprise. Of course, I have a wife who loves to pore over maps and travel 
guides. Which makes us some match. In the last 20 years we have been 
practically nowhere. And right now, as I was packing, she was in the next room 
and thinking that the Nicaragua business was just foolish talk of a morning. 
</P>
<P>
But this time, when she walked into the bedroom and saw that I was actually 
packing, there was at first the shrieks and near-tears, and suddenly, simply 
because it had been so long that we had been anyplace, she said she would risk 
all. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, I'll even plan this one carefully, just for you," I said. 
</P>
<P>
I made a phone call to my friend Kevin Cahill. He is a doctor who cared for 
Nora Astorga, the Nicaraguan ambassador to the United Nations, until she went 
home to Managua to die. 
</P>
<P>
"You go to Costa Rica and then drive to Managua," he said. "It's the most 
beautiful drive I've ever been on. Don't fly to Managua. It's just another 
plane flight. Take the drive. It's about five hours and you'll love it." 
</P>
<P>
When I hung up, I said to my wife, "There! I got all the directions." I reached 
into my top drawer and grabbed my passport. It was under a pile of papers. I 
never use the thing. 
</P>
<P>
We bought tickets at the airport and flew to Miami for an evening flight to San 
Jose, Costa Rica. At Miami, my wife took our passports and tickets and waited 
in line at the counter while I went to get newspapers. When I came back she was 
in despair. "Your passport expired," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"So what? It has my name on it." 
</P>
<P>
"They won't let you on the plane if she sees your passport is old. 
</P>
<P>
I grabbed the passports and tickets from my wife and went up to the airline's 
woman and waved the passports at her. "Here you go." I stuffed the passports 
into my pocket. She gave me the boarding cards, and I walked away. We got on 
the plane to Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll just have to turn around and come back," my wife said on the flight 
down. "They won't let us in." 
</P>
<P>
"Don't worry about it." 
</P>
<P>
"Your passport expired two years ago. Why didn't you ever get a new one?" 
</P>
<P>
"Because I hate passports," I said. I do. I never have understood what they are 
for, other than keeping a lot of customs and immigration agents working at 
airports all over the world. The first passports were letters from Roman 
emperors carried by couriers who used them to commandeer horses when they were 
in distant cities. 
</P>
<P>
The United States never had much use for them. We had tens of millions who came 
in from foreign countries with no identification papers at all and who 
proceeded to build a country. The passport only became important here after 
World War II, when after fighting for Democracy we immediately became afraid of 
it. As McCarthy flourished, the urge to inspect and control all Americans 
became irresistible. Frances Knight, in charge of passports for the State 
Department, saw them as the path to force every American to have an 
identification card. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond controlling humans, a passport serves no use and is an infringement on 
my freedom. The only reason other countries now make so much of passports is 
that the United States does. Therefore, I hate passports on an international 
level. After lecturing this to my wife on the four-hour flight to Costa Rica, I 
proceeded to get off the plane and become ill the moment I saw the woman in 
uniform who sat at a counter as if judging a murder trial. She looked at me 
like I was a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll get sent right back," my wife muttered. I handed the passport to the 
woman, and she pursed her lips in concentration and began to look through the 
passport and I stood there and tried to figure out what story I could tell. 
"How long have you had this job?" I asked her. She looked at me and shook her 
head. She couldn't speak English. There it goes. I can't even tell the woman a 
decent lie. I looked at the clock. It was after 9 p.m. There would be no way to 
get anybody from the U.S. Embassy. For sure we would wind up sitting in an 
airport all night. 
</P>
<P>
The uniformed armed guard behind her looked over her shoulder. They looked at 
the snapshot, at me, at my name and birth date. She flipped through the pages 
and looked at the previous stamps. She held the passport as if to weigh it and 
she picked up this huge stamping machine and with a loud clacking, not unlike 
the sound of handcuffs going on a criminal, she stamped my book. Quickly she 
picked up a hand stamp and banged that onto one paper and after that another 
and now a third. The armed guard nodded. She handed me back the passport. The 
woman and the armed guard never had noticed the date on the passport. I walked 
on, although I must admit I was numb. 
</P>
<P>
In San Jose, we stayed for a day at the Carriari, a hotel near the airport, 
that had about the best cup of coffee I can remember having and a huge swimming 
pool that was just cold enough to keep you moving. The place cost about as much 
as an American motel. You have to be nuts to go to some island and blow your 
bankroll. 
</P>
<P>
We had dinner that night with Jim Dyer, who publishes the Tico Times, an 
English-language paper in San Jose. He has been in Central America since the 
times of the United Fruit company towns. 
</P>
<P>
He asked me how we were going to Managua. 
</P>
<P>
"Drive." 
</P>
<P>
He seemed dubious. "Why don't you fly?" 
</P>
<P>
"We're driving in the morning," I said. 
</P>
<P>
He cocked his head skeptically. 
</P>
<P>
"Is there something to be afraid of?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"There is some violence in the area near the border, but not on the road 
itself, I don't believe," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Then what are we worrying about." 
</P>
<P>
"Just that you're crossing borders. Airports seem a little easier." 
</P>
<P>
"I got a passport," I said. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, my wife got behind the wheel of a rented car and we headed 
for the highway that runs all the way to Managua. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at this," I said. One sign read "Nicaragua" and the other said "Panama." 
In America, the same green highway sign would say, "Indianapolis." 
</P>
<P>
My wife drove because I am one of the three or four males in the Northern 
Hemisphere who never has driven a car. I grew up in Ozone Park, in New York 
City, and never had $40 for a car. However, I had the A Train only a few yards 
away. I went to work on newspapers when I was 17. I never had enough money at 
one time to pay all my bar bills, so you could forget about a car. I also spent 
so many years in newspaper bars that it was insane to think of coming out into 
the early morning sun, after a full night bar-side, and driving a car. I wrote 
200 of the headlines myself:"Two Dead, Three Hurt in Car Crash." Forget it. I 
live in a city of subways and walking. Garage space for a car in Manhattan can 
cost $350 a month, which is immoral at a time when people sleep on the streets. 
My role in the automobile world is passenger. 
</P>
<P>
So I let my wife drive, and I sat and gave orders to her to look at the parts 
of the countryside that I liked. The drive to the Nicaraguan border was exactly 
what Dr. Cahill had promised. Outside of San Jose, the land was rolling and 
beautiful, and as it grew flat it was still exciting because Nicaragua was that 
much closer. We stopped at a restaurant and had rice and beans, and the woman 
asked where we were going, and we said, Nicaragua, and she rocked her head from 
side to side, dubiously, but said nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
Back on the road, my wife drove through emptiness and finally, ahead, a heavy 
man in fatigues stood in the center of the road with his hand out. When we 
stopped, I saw soldiers sitting on a bench under a shed. 
</P>
<P>
The big guy smiled and looked in the car. He pointed ahead and we nodded, yes, 
that's where we were going. He smiled and backed off. 
</P>
<P>
We drove for some time and now the road ducked under trees and there were 
shacks that had been turned into offices and an old bus terminal and two guards 
standing in the road who held up their hands. 
</P>
<P>
"Nicar-awa?" the guard asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yop" I said. I waved my bum passport. The guard took both passports and looked 
at them closely and stuck his head in the car and matched our faces with the 
passport photos. Again he flipped through all the pages. He handed them back to 
us. He now explained, in sign language and with a couple of English words, that 
the border to Nicaragua was about half a mile ahead and that there were 
Sandinista border guards there. I told him that would be fine. He nodded and 
stepped back and my wife started the car. 
</P>
<P>
Right away, the other soldier jumped in front of us and began tapping the 
windshield. 
</P>
<P>
"Rental," he said. Now the first soldier's mouth dropped open. "Rental!" He 
shook his head and waved for us to go back. Now an officer with a clipboard 
came running out of a house. He spoke English. 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot take a rental car to Nicaragua," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Why not? It is an American rental car company. I signed a contract. They know 
where to find me." 
</P>
<P>
He became vehement. "No rental cars in Nicaragua. Sometimes there is a mine on 
the road and the car gets blown up. The rental company in Costa Rica doesn't 
get paid for the car." 
</P>
<P>
"Why not?" 
</P>
<P>
"Because the people who rented the car get blown up with the car." 
</P>
<P>
"How can I get to Nicaragua then?" 
</P>
<P>
The officer shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
"Can I leave the car and take a bus?" 
</P>
<P>
"There are no buses to Nicaragua. Our bus could get blown up, too. Our buses 
only go to San Jose." 
</P>
<P>
"Is there a bus on the other side from the border to Managua?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, there is one." 
</P>
<P>
"Can I leave the car here and go to Managua by bus?" 
</P>
<P>
"We do not care what you do. We must protect the rental car." 
</P>
<P>
We pulled the car over alongside a government office and got out. 
</P>
<P>
I leaned against the fender and I said to my wife, "Do you remember when I came 
home from the shooting in Brooklyn and told you about the two dead in the 
street and nobody paying attention to them because the crowd was all around the 
car, looking at the bullet holes?" 
</P>
<P>
"I thought you made it up," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"You just heard it for yourself. Central America is the same as Nostrand Avenue 
in Brooklyn." 
</P>
<P>
Then we started to talk about Nora Astorga. She killed a general in Managua and 
caused the Somoza government to truly fall apart. Then she walked out of 
Nicaragua, over hills and through jungles, in a white dress and high heels. If 
she could do that, then we sure could walk a few yards into Nicaragua and get 
on a bus for Managua. 
</P>
<P>
As we started to walk, the officer ran up and said, "Passports." 
</P>
<P>
My wife showed hers, and I handed him mine and he pursed his lips and inspected 
them, and handed them back, and we walked on the bumpy road under the trees and 
between empty fields, and now ahead there were soldiers with automatic weapons 
and of course they were on the alert for Contras or American troops, but they 
relaxed when they saw my wife. Right away, one of them said, "Passports," and 
once more nobody noticed that mine was invalid. We walked over the border and 
asked a soldier if there was a bus for Managua. 
</P>
<P>
"Thursday," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was now Tuesday. With a sigh, we turned around and started back to Costa 
Rica. First we showed our passports to the same Sandinista guard who had just 
looked at them. Back at the Costa Rican crossing point the officer who had 
checked us out called for our passports. This time he took the passports and 
walked into a house. He returned and proudly showed us that he had stamped them 
to show that we had returned to his country. 
</P>
<P>
We got into the car, and my wife started on the four-hour drive back to San 
Jose. We stopped again at the restaurant by the road, and the woman looked at 
us, and we told her that we had not been allowed into Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
"The boom" she said, meaning gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
"No, they wouldn't let us go with the car. It's a rental." 
</P>
<P>
"Why didn't you say that to me? I would not have let you leave here. You cannot 
take a rental car over the border. People can go. But not rental cars." 
</P>
<P>
We ate and drove back to the hotel outside of San Jose. The next morning we got 
up and took a plane to Managua and we were in Managua within an hour, I guess. 
We were there for a few days, and there was excitement and sadness and so much 
to see. But then when we got back to New York, all we did was tell people about 
the eight-hour drive to nowhere, on the day we learned that in Central America, 
just as in Brooklyn, a car truly is more important than a person. Still, today, 
our ride to nowhere was the best vacation we ever had.

CANDIDATE WOULD BE 1ST LATINO ON COMPTON COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

COMPTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This city's first settler was a Latino -- Don Jose Dominguez, who in 1794 
received a land grant from the Spanish king. But after a century of cityhood 
and rapid Latino population growth during the last decade, Compton has yet to 
elect a Latino City Council member. 
</P>
<P>
It is a record that Latino leaders say they want to change starting this year 
as they rally around the candidacy of Martin D. Chavez, 29, a third-generation 
Compton resident who is running in Council District 3 against incumbent Robert 
L. Adams and six other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a good, viable candidate and he is very qualified," said Pedro Pallan, 
president of the Latino Chamber of Commerce and owner of the San Antonio Bakery 
on Rosecrans Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez, an affirmative action and equal opportunity employment analyst for the 
Los Angeles City Department of Water and Power, graduated from Cal State 
Dominguez Hill and also earned a master's degree there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Latino Community Unhappy 
</P>
<P>
Chavez's candidacy, though, is about more than competency and electing the 
first Latino council member. It is the most vocal message to date from the 
Latino community that it is unhappy with the black leadership that has 
dominated public affairs in Compton for about 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they believe that they are the advocates of civil rights," Chavez said 
of Compton's political leaders, "but in reality they are the keepers of their 
civil rights, not the civil rights of the minority community." 
</P>
<P>
Compton's political leaders, Chavez said, are trying to ignore the rapid growth 
of the Latino community and denying it an equal share of city services. 
Latinos, he said, are being treated "like an invisible minority and nobody pays 
attention to them." 
</P>
<P>
Compton politicians, according to Chavez and his backers, have not given 
Latinos enough public sector jobs, have ignored cries for more bilingual 
personnel in City Hall and the schools, and have failed to deliver needed 
improvements such as road repair and street lighting to the north side of the 
city, where much of the poorest Latino population is concentrated. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager James Goins acknowledged that the city has failed to hire as many 
Latinos or bilingual personnel as it should have. But he said Compton is trying 
to rectify that. 
</P>
<P>
"We definitely are concerned about it," he said, "because it's important to our 
future that we be an integrated city." 
</P>
<P>
Chavez said his main goal in running for office is to help the Latino and black 
communities avoid what he says will be an inevitable confrontation if black 
leaders do not begin sharing power with Latinos and heeding their demands for 
better services. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'City Under Microscope' 
</P>
<P>
"This city is under a microscope right now," Chavez said. "It's small enough 
for people to study to get an idea of how black and brown people are going to 
get along." 
</P>
<P>
Latino leaders, though, are growing impatient and increasingly divided over how 
best to get the attention of decision-makers in the school district and in City 
Hall. Although they declined to speak publicly about it, Latino leaders 
privately acknowledge that some among their ranks advocate a more 
confrontational stance, such as filing discrimination lawsuits against the 
school district and the city. 
</P>
<P>
Other leaders favor a lower profile, urging that Latinos continue working 
through city and school administrative channels and make greater use of the 
ballot. Chavez places himself in the second category. 
</P>
<P>
"The real issue is voice. (Latinos) have no voice in the city," he said. "The 
city representatives don't represent them." 
</P>
<P>
Getting elected, though, is not going to be easy. Chavez and his backers 
acknowledge that in Compton, Latino power at the polls is weak. Latinos account 
for a third of the city's approximately 94,000 residents but only about 5% of 
the voters. Out of the city's 40,000 registered voters, only 1,800 are Latino, 
Chavez estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Adams said he believes many Latino residents are not voters because 
they are in this country illegally. That is one explanation, agreed Gregorio 
Sanchez, a Latino activist and member of Our Lady of Victory Catholic Church, a 
center of Latino life in Compton. But there are other explanations, too, 
Sanchez says. 
</P>
<P>
The non-voters "may be legal people who have never voted in their lives and 
they are scared," he said. "We have a lot of people here who have never become 
citizens and therefore their children (who are citizens) have never had the 
experience through their parents of the importance of the vote." 
</P>
<P>
Even if they increase their voter participation, Latinos still face the problem 
of convincing some Compton political leaders that they should share their 
power. 
</P>
<P>
"You got to remember Latinos were here before we were," said Councilman Maxcy 
D. Filer, who is black. "They were running faster than whites (fleeing the 
city) when I moved to Compton (in 1952). Now they just come back and say 'Give 
it to me.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bitter Memories 
</P>
<P>
Filer points out with some bitterness that Manual Correa, the only Latino 
member of the Compton Unified School District board, was on the city police 
force when blacks were trying to get jobs there, that Joe Ochoa, a Compton 
Latino leader, was on the city Personnel Board when blacks were fighting for 
government jobs, and that the late Ray Gonzales was a school board member when 
blacks were fighting to be hired as teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't remember any of them fighting for blacks," Filer said. "Where were 
they when I was walking a picket line in Compton?" 
</P>
<P>
And Latinos, not blacks, Filer continued, are the ones getting hired at the 
industrial parks the city has developed at the south end of town along the 91 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"Go out on the Artesia Freeway and see how many blacks are working out there," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Adams, Chavez's opponent, says that Latino residents lack influence 
at City Hall because they have not voiced their sentiments loudly enough and 
have not organized as a political force. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want something, the squeaky wheel gets the oil," Adams said. "I don't 
see a great percentage of them attending our council meetings." 
</P>
<P>
The Latino voice, though, is likely to get a lot louder given Compton's growing 
-- some say soaring -- Latino population. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the last year a federal census was done, there were 17,587 Latinos in 
Compton, making up 21.6% of the total population. The black population was 
59,530 or 73.2%. According to the National Planning Data Corp., a private 
research firm that updates federal census material, the Latino population in 
the city rose 65% between 1980 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The firm estimates that in 1988 the Latino population was 29,093 or 32.2%. By 
1993, the firm predicts, it will be 37,400 or 38.8%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clearest Picture 
</P>
<P>
School enrollment figures paint the clearest picture of the city's changing 
racial makeup. The percentage of Latino enrollment is growing at such a fast 
rate, officials in the Compton Unified School District say, that it is expected 
to overtake the black majority within a year or two. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1984 and 1989, for example, the percentage of Latino enrollment rose 
from 30% of the student population to 47%. During the same period, according to 
ethnic census data that every school district must compile annually for the 
state, the percentage of black enrollment went down from 67% to 51%. 
</P>
<P>
Only 3.6% of the district's 1,385 teachers and administrators, however, are 
Latino, while almost 77% are black. In City Hall, Filer insists, the story is 
different. City administrators "are recruiting (Latinos) and they've done a 
tremendous job as far as recruiting goes." 
</P>
<P>
Latinos think otherwise. They point to city personnel records as evidence of 
what some call "systematic discrimination." Records show that only 50 -- about 
9.7% -- of the 514 full-time city jobs are held by Latinos. Blacks on the other 
hand, hold 401 -- or 78% -- of the jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez credits the Police Department as being the only city branch that he 
believes has made a concerted effort to recruit and hire Latinos. According to 
the department's records, 18 of the 143 police officers are Latino. Of the 
city's 98 firefighters, seven are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
When Compton leaders debate the issue of Latino representation, the name of 
Assistant City Manager Edmundo Sotelo is frequently mentioned. City officials 
use Sotelo -- the highest-ranking Latino in city government -- to underscore 
their assertion that Latinos already hold important jobs. But Latino leaders 
counter that Sotelo is the exception: of the city's 38 top administrators, he 
is the lone Latino. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Very Aggressive' 
</P>
<P>
Gregorio Sanchez charges that neither the city nor the school district has very 
aggressive affirmative action programs for Latino recruiting and hiring. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're not going to get our fair share until we get them to have an 
affirmative action plan. . . . They're beginning to cooperate but not as fully 
as they should," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Elisa L. Sanchez, deputy school superintendent (not related to Gregorio 
Sanchez), acknowledges that Compton's Latino community has been pressing the 
school district to adopt an affirmative action plan and step up recruiting of 
more Spanish-speaking teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"That certainly is a need in this district, as in many districts outside 
Compton," said the deputy superintendent, pointing out that there is a 
statewide shortage of Spanish-speaking teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Compton has only about 30 teachers who are credentialed as bilingual, though, 
it has about 7,500 Spanish-speaking students who are classified as having such 
limited skills in English that they must be taught in Spanish. That is a ratio 
of 250 to 1. In the same classification, Long Beach has 8,140 students and 71 
teachers with bilingual credentials, a ratio of 114.6 to one. 
</P>
<P>
There is a crying need, too, say Chavez and other Latino leaders, for bilingual 
personnel in various city departments. 
</P>
<P>
"Just recently, the police force hired two bilingual service representatives," 
Chavez said. "We were without any bilingual service representatives for over 
two years. Imagine how a Spanish-speaking person felt when he called in to 
report a crime and nobody knew what he was talking about," Chavez said. "There 
was nobody there to communicate with him." 
</P>
<P>
Norma Garcia, the city's personnel specialist in charge of affirmative action, 
says that a total of four bilingual dispatchers have recently been hired in the 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez has nothing but praise for what he says are City Manager Goins' efforts 
to bring bilingual personnel into City Hall. "He has recognized (the need) but 
he still has the resistance of individuals on the City Council and in City 
Hall," Chavez said. 
</P>
<P>
Goins meets regularly with a Latino task force that was set up last year after 
a group of Latino police officers charged that they and other Compton residents 
felt discriminated against. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem that Latinos face in trying to gain equal rights, Gregorio 
Sanchez said, comes back to the lack of elected Latino officials. "We've got 
like a barrier right there and we have to jump or go over that barrier." 
</P>
<P>
Strategically, chamber president Pallan said, chances are good that Chavez will 
make a strong showing because there are seven other candidates in the District 
3 contest and the vote is expected to be thinly spread among them. Pallan says 
Chavez supporters are already planning to set up a phone bank to help win votes 
for their candidate.

THE TIMES POLL; 
</P>
<P>
MOST AMERICANS THINK ABORTION IS IMMORAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most Americans personally consider abortion to be immoral -- in fact, "murder." 
But they also believe deeply that each woman should be allowed to decide for 
herself whether to have an abortion, a nationwide survey by the Times Poll has 
found. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion clearly is an issue that tugs at the conscience and stirs up 
conflicting feelings about right and wrong and the practicalities of living in 
a complex society, the poll showed. 
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, Americans adamantly object to abortion if its only purpose is 
birth control. Nor do they support it as a way to avoid marriage. And they 
oppose it "on demand," as a mere convenience. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
See Justification 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, practically everybody agrees that abortion is justified when 
the mother's life is in danger or if the pregnancy was caused by rape or 
incest. To a lesser extent, but still overwhelmingly, people also support 
abortion if the baby is likely to have a serious birth defect. 
</P>
<P>
Americans tend to support the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Roe vs. Wade 
that legalized abortion -- a decision that has been under attack all through 
the 1980s by the Ronald Reagan Administration and now the Bush Administration. 
The high court plans to hear a Missouri case challenging Roe vs. Wade on April 
26 and to rule by midsummer, and there has been speculation that it could 
substantially alter or even overturn that decision. 
</P>
<P>
Public support for the 16-year-old court decision is only lukewarm, but people 
overwhelmingly oppose amending the Constitution to outlaw abortions, as 
advocated aggressively by "pro-life" groups. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the survey provides evidence that the years-long, constant agitation 
by factions on both sides of the issue -- anti-abortion or "pro-life" and 
pro-abortion or "pro-choice" groups -- has had little impact on public opinion. 
It indicates that American opinions on abortion today are about the same as 
they were a decade ago, according to Times Poll Director I. A. Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
Politically, most people do not vote for a candidate simply because of a 
position on abortion, the survey showed. But a significant number -- a third of 
those interviewed -- asserted that they indeed would switch their vote away 
from a politician who took "the wrong stand." Most of these people generally 
oppose abortion, an indication that opponents feel more strongly about the 
subject than do supporters. 
</P>
<P>
The Times poll, in one of the largest and most substantive surveys ever 
conducted on the emotional issue of abortion, interviewed 3,583 American adults 
by telephone March 3-10. The margin of error for a survey of this size is 3 
percentage points in either direction. 
</P>
<P>
The survey included a national cross section sample of 2,406 people, plus an 
additional 1,177 women. The "oversample" of women was added because of 
abortion's special significance to them and in order to provide greater 
statistical precision to their opinions. But their answers were "weighted" so 
that, overall, they properly fit into a normal percentage mix of men and women. 
</P>
<P>
Eight percent of the women interviewed acknowledged having had an abortion 
themselves -- some of them more than once. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody really knows what proportion of women in the United States actually 
have had an abortion," pollster Lewis said. "We have to assume that 8% is a 
minimum figure. A fifth of the women we interviewed who admitted they have had 
an abortion said they had never before told anyone about it. There must be many 
more who are still unwilling to discuss the subject." 
</P>
<P>
Contrasted with the widespread perception that abortion clients come from the 
low end of the socioeconomic ladder, women who told the Times poll that they 
had aborted a fetus tended to be better educated, working full time, earning 
good salaries and generally representative of every racial and ethnic group. 
They also tended to be either childless or the parent of just one child, 
single, a baby boomer and living in metropolitan areas. Religion is not very 
important in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Necessary Evil 
</P>
<P>
Americans generally find abortion to be morally repugnant, the poll showed. But 
they also see it often as a necessary evil, a last resort for desperate people. 
</P>
<P>
Among those interviewed, 61% said they believe abortion to be "morally wrong." 
Just 22% said it is "morally right." Even women who have had an abortion are 
divided on the moral question, with 37% considering it to be "wrong," 39% 
"right" and 24% not sure. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a large majority -- 57% -- think "abortion is murder," the poll found. 
Only 35% disagree. It even is considered "murder" by a third of the women who 
have had an abortion and a fourth of the people who generally favor it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Key Question 
</P>
<P>
But the key to understanding the overriding attitude of Americans toward 
abortion can be found in their answers to this question: "Do you agree or 
disagree with this statement? 'I personally feel that abortion is morally 
wrong, but I also feel that whether or not to have an abortion is a decision 
that has to be made by every woman for herself.' " Seventy-four percent agreed 
and only 21% disagreed, with 5% not sure. 
</P>
<P>
Even two-thirds of the people who said they generally oppose abortion agreed 
that each woman should be allowed to choose for herself whether to have one. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most of the "pro-choice" and "pro-life" activists who attract media 
attention, relatively few Americans approve -- or disapprove -- of abortion 
carte blanche under any circumstances. They have a range of standards. 
</P>
<P>
In order of priority, for example, people favor abortion "when a woman's health 
is seriously endangered" (88%-6%), "if a woman became pregnant as the result of 
rape or incest" (84%-10%) and "if there is a strong chance of serious defect in 
the baby" (74%-17%). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Less Compelling 
</P>
<P>
But they begin to oppose abortion as the reasons become less compelling, such 
as "if the family has a very low income and cannot afford any more children" 
(41% for, 49% against), "if an unmarried woman who is pregnant does not want to 
marry the man" (40%-51%), "if she is married and does not want any more 
children" (36%-54%) and "when it is used as a form of birth control" (13%-80%). 
</P>
<P>
People reject the general notion that a woman "should be able to get an 
abortion no matter what the reason" (34%-57%). 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the respondents said that "generally speaking" they do not favor 
abortion (34% for, 40% against, 26% not sure). And even people who do favor 
abortion overwhelmingly oppose its use for birth control. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, by 46% to 35%, people tend to support the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade 
decision, which struck down all state laws making abortion a crime and declared 
that the Constitution guarantees women the right to end early pregnancies -- 
those in the first trimester -- free from government interference. "Every woman 
has the right to control her own body," a majority of those interviewed by The 
Times agreed (51%-44%). 
</P>
<P>
People are strongly opposed to any constitutional amendment that would outlaw 
abortions (28% for, 62% against). And they also oppose going back to the 
pre-1973 system of "permitting each state to decide whether abortions are 
legal" (34% for, 50% against). 
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that people on the high end of the socioeconomic scale are 
dramatically more sympathetic toward abortion than those on the low end. For 
example, 45% of the people who went to college generally favor abortion, while 
only 25% of high school dropouts do. Likewise, 42% of people earning more than 
$40,000 a year favor abortion, but just 24% of those who take in less than 
$20,000 do. 
</P>
<P>
For many, the practical, everyday burdens of giving birth and raising a child 
greatly influence their attitude toward abortion. For example, people who are 
self-employed, working full time or looking for a job are significantly more 
supportive of abortion than are homemakers or retired persons. 
</P>
<P>
People in this survey were about evenly divided between those who think 
"motherhood must always be a woman's most important and satisfying role" and 
others who feel "motherhood can sometimes keep a woman from fulfilling her true 
potential in life." 
</P>
<P>
The majority of people who support abortion think that raising children can 
hold back a woman in her career. But the majority of those who oppose abortion 
believe that motherhood should be the most important, satisfying thing a woman 
does. 
</P>
<P>
Only roughly one-fourth of blacks and Latinos favor abortion, but more than a 
third of Anglos do. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, however, there are no significant differences in abortion views 
between men and women, young and old and Republicans and Democrats, the poll 
found. 
</P>
<P>
By religion, Jews solidly support abortion. But Christians -- particularly 
Roman Catholics -- do not. People who say religion is "very important" in their 
lives oppose abortion by more than 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
Geographically, people along the Pacific Coast and in New England favor 
abortion more than other Americans. People in the Deep South and Midwest are 
more opposed than others. 
</P>
<P>
Divorced and separated people tend to support abortion. But single people who 
never have been married, and those who had split from their first spouse and 
remarried somebody else, are divided on the issue. People in their first 
marriages tend to oppose abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Also, people who favor abortion tend to be much less certain of their views 
than those who oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
The public does not want to use tax funds to pay for abortions of poor people, 
the survey showed (38% for, 52% against). There is a wide difference of opinion 
between people who favor abortion (64% for using tax dollars) and those who 
oppose it (15% for). 
</P>
<P>
But roughly two-thirds of all people -- abortion supporters and opponents alike 
-- believe that the responsibility for financing the termination of a pregnancy 
should rest with one or both of the parents. 
</P>
<P>
More than two-thirds of those interviewed said "the government should make 
contraceptives more widely available." Even 71% of Roman Catholics, whose 
religion officially forbids use of artificial contraception, believe it ought 
to be more readily available. 
</P>
<P>
However, 56% of the people in this survey reported that they use no 
contraceptives. Actually, Catholics reported using them slightly more than 
Protestants or Jews. 
</P>
<P>
There is a tendency to feel that "legal abortions have encouraged people to 
become sexually promiscuous" (48% agree, 43% disagree). 
</P>
<P>
People believe overwhelmingly that "minors should have to get their parents' 
permission before having an abortion" (81%-14%). However, the survey offered a 
good illustration of why most pregnant minors do not seek their parents' 
permission. When asked if they had a pregnant daughter whether they would "help 
her get the abortion or oppose it," only a third replied "help" and half 
answered "oppose." 
</P>
<P>
A majority of people think any woman seeking an abortion should be required "to 
get the consent of the natural father" (53%-37%). Women think this less than 
men, but they tend to agree. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, people had poor impressions of leaders of both the pro-abortion and 
anti-abortion movements (only 26% and 24% favorable, respectively).

WHO THEY ARE 
</P>
<P>
People Who Favor Abortion: 
</P>
<P>
* Have generally liberal views on "family values." They favor changing women's 
status in society and do not feel that a woman's place is in the home. They 
think motherhood can sometimes be a burden. They support homosexual rights. 
</P>
<P>
* Tend to have fewer children; more often than not they are separated, 
remarried or have been divorced. 
</P>
<P>
* Consider religion less important in their lives and tend to be Jewish or to 
attend religious services only occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
* Politically identify themselves as more liberal and in party affiliation 
split evenly between Republicans and Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
* Tend to earn more than $30,000 per year, be middle-aged, live in a central 
city or suburb in New England, the Mid-Atlantic or the Pacific states. More 
likely than not a female wage earner contributes more than 40% of the family 
income. 
</P>
<P>
People Who Oppose Abortion: 
</P>
<P>
* Feel the country is in a state of moral decline and hold conservative views 
on "family values." To them, a woman's place is in the home and motherhood must 
always be a woman's most important and satisfying role. 
</P>
<P>
* Have more children than average (four or more) and tend not to use 
contraception. 
</P>
<P>
* Consider religion very important in their lives and regularly or frequently 
attend services. They are most often Latino and Roman Catholic or hold 
fundamentalist Pentecostal religious views. 
</P>
<P>
* Are either conservative or tend to pay little attention to politics. 
</P>
<P>
* Generally either own their own businesses or hold service-related positions, 
earning less than $20,000 per year. They tend to live in smaller cities or in 
rural areas of the Midwest and Deep South.

THE POLITICS OF ABORTION 
</P>
<P>
At present, it does not appear that the Bush Administration will suffer if the 
Supreme Court overturns Roe vs. Wade. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has asked the Supreme Court to strike down its Roe 
versus Wade decision which essentially supports abortion. If the Court 
complies, will that make you more or less likely to support the Bush 
Administration? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More likely: 15% 
</P>
<P>
Less likely: 19% 
</P>
<P>
Have no effect: 60% 
</P>
<P>
Don't Know: 6% 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason is that voters who favor abortion won't switch their vote on 
account of the abortion issue. But those who oppose abortion might. 
</P>
<P>
Some people say they would vote against a political candidate if he or she took 
what they considered to be the wrong stand on abortion. How about you? Is the 
abortion issue so important to you that you would switch your vote from your 
original choice and vote for somebody else because you disagreed on abortion, 
or not?

MONUMENT TO ATOMIC AGE: DUMP FOR NUCLEAR WASTE 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Standing amid the pale green sagebrush that carpets the hard desert floor 100 
miles northwest of here is a mountain with a monumental mission. If all goes as 
planned, in the year 2003 this barren rock bordering the Nevada Test Site will 
become a mausoleum for the legacy of the Atomic Age: nuclear waste. 
</P>
<P>
The goal is to bury spent fuel from commercial reactors and waste from weapons 
plants deep in the womb of Yucca Mountain, which in theory would imprison the 
deadly radioactive cargo for 10,000 years. Federal officials say the mountain's 
geology and location in a remote, arid region make it a promising choice for 
the nation's first high-level nuclear dump. 
</P>
<P>
But others are not sure that Yucca Mountain is up to the task. 
</P>
<P>
There are nagging questions, for example, about the threat earthquakes pose to 
the stability of the mountain, which rests astride an area crisscrossed by 
faults. And some scientists are dubious about predictions that little if any 
moisture would percolate down through the rock and breach the subterranean 
vault, where it could corrode the steel waste canisters and usher radioactive 
material into the water table. 
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. Department of Energy is months away from launching formal 
studies to judge the mountain's environmental fitness for the job, a 
mushrooming group of skeptics is already questioning the agency's performance 
as manager. 
</P>
<P>
Among the critics are officials with the U.S. Geological Survey and the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission as well as the Nevada state government, which fiercely 
opposes the dump and contends that the department is bent on collecting only 
data that basks the mountain in a favorable light. 
</P>
<P>
"It is our opinion that DOE decided on Yucca Mountain in 1979 without any 
supporting data and has done nothing since but collect evidence that bolsters 
its case," said Robert Loux, executive director of the Nevada Nuclear Waste 
Project Office. "Their approach has been, 'If we run into a problem, we'll just 
engineer around it.' Well, our feeling is, the jury's still out on this site." 
</P>
<P>
Even a member of the Department of Energy's scientific team has raised a red 
flag. Jerry Szymanski, who believes Yucca Mountain is ill-suited for its 
proposed role as a $30-billion nuclear waste tomb, said the department's 
strategy for evaluating the site could result in "a lot of misdirected effort 
and wasted time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dwindling Storage Space 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the nuclear utilities, whose ratepayers have contributed nearly $4 
billion toward construction of the underground dump, are losing patience. Most 
of the nation's nuclear power plants are running out of temporary storage space 
for the dangerous waste, and restless operators are dismayed by delays that 
have plagued the Department of Energy's work at Yucca Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Department officials vigorously defend their program and insist that they do 
not want to bury nuclear waste beneath Yucca Mountain if it is unsafe. Even if 
that was the department's agenda, officials argue, the myriad agencies and 
committees looking over their shoulder would not let it happen. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most carefully monitored program I've ever seen undertaken by the 
federal government," said Carl Gertz, Yucca Mountain project manager. "Based on 
our information so far, it is a safe site. But we are far, far away from 
knowing that for sure. . . . Only hard science will determine that with any 
confidence."

<P>
If Yucca Mountain passes muster after $2 billion worth of studies spanning 
seven years, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission will be asked to issue a license 
for the waste repository. Should that occur, many believe the United States 
will have solved one of the greatest technical challenges of our time: how to 
permanently isolate radioactivity from the biosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Nuclear Age began more than 40 years ago, billions of dollars have 
been spent in the quest for a way to safely dispose of the deadly radioactive 
byproduct piling up at bomb-making plants and commercial nuclear reactors. 
Firing the waste into space, tucking it between polar ice sheets and burying it 
beneath the tectonic plates of the ocean are options that have been examined. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On the Short List 
</P>
<P>
Experts ultimately settled on the idea of entombing the poisonous waste deep in 
a mined repository, and from the start, Yucca Mountain was on everybody's short 
list of potential sites. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the Department of Energy was directed to study three sites -- Yucca 
Mountain, Deaf Smith County, Tex., and Hanford, Wash. -- to determine which was 
best suited as dump host. But that approach was criticized as too costly and 
politically challenging, and in late 1987 Congress abruptly scrapped the Texas 
and Washington sites and zeroed in on Yucca Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Nevadans, whose four congressional representatives at the time were freshmen 
with little clout, refer to the action as the "Screw Nevada Bill." 
</P>
<P>
To the casual observer, Yucca Mountain appears an inviting spot for a nuclear 
waste graveyard. Long, lumpy and the color of a Weimaraner's hide, it is 
nothing if not remote. From atop the mountain's spine, the only visible signs 
of life are contrails left by pilots from nearby Nellis Air Force Base and a 
dirt road that meanders across the lonely Amargosa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the mountain is bordered by the 1,350-square-mile Nevada Test 
Site. Thus, much of the region's acreage already has been spoiled by the 689 
announced underground weapons explosions conducted at the site to date. Also 
attractive to government planners is the relatively sympathetic local 
population, which is familiar with things nuclear and has long relied on the 
Department of Energy as an employer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mountain's Selling Points 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials say Yucca Mountain has some other important virtues as well. 
The region is dry, receiving just six inches of rain in an average year, and 
Department of Energy scientists predict that less than 5% of the rainfall soaks 
into the mountain. If that scenario proves correct, it dilutes the threat that 
water might dissolve the waste and flow in a poisonous stream into the water 
table. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Department of Energy officials favor Yucca Mountain because it is 
formed of layers of volcanic ash called tuff which contains minerals capable of 
removing radioactive particles from water. 
</P>
<P>
The steel canisters containing the waste are expected to last from 300 to 1,000 
years. After that, the rock itself must prevent radioactive leakage from 
reaching settlements for 10,000 years, when most of the radioactive elements 
will have decayed. 
</P>
<P>
While surveys show that most Nevadans oppose the waste dump, some residents 
figure that it is a gamble worth taking. Robert Dickinson is one of them. 
</P>
<P>
Dickinson is a Las Vegas businessman who heads the Nevada Nuclear Waste Study 
Committee, a group with ties to the nuclear power industry. In an interview, he 
said the dangers associated with radioactivity have been vastly exaggerated, 
called opponents of the repository "anti-everything" and suggested that 
skeptical scientists like the Department of Energy's Szymanski are disloyal 
rabble-rousers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Political Hysteria' 
</P>
<P>
"This thing has been clouded by political hysteria, and we think that the more 
Nevadans learn about what it really is, the more they will say, 'Is that all? 
Let's get on with it,' " Dickinson said. "Our politicians are doing the state a 
real disservice in the name of political heroics." 
</P>
<P>
Dickinson believes the repository could be a magnet for other nuclear-related 
technologies and help Nevada diversify its economy, which is heavily reliant on 
gambling. And he believes that if officials would abandon their "political 
puffery" and instead cut a deal with the federal government, Nevada could reel 
in some significant economic benefits as well. If the state agrees to the dump, 
he noted, it stands to receive $10 million a year during construction and 
another $20 million annually once it begins operation. 
</P>
<P>
"This site is an isolated area 100 miles from anywhere," Dickinson said. "It 
gets four inches of rain. It's next to a test site where we've exploded 700 
atomic devices. If it's safe, I say let's get on with it." 
</P>
<P>
But skeptics say Yucca Mountain's drawbacks are many, including more than 30 
active earthquake faults nearby. The Ghost Dance Fault, for example, cuts 
through the heart of the dump site. The presence of several volcanic cones just 
west of the mountain is also troubling to some. Research on one, the Lathrop 
Wells cinder cone, indicates it may have erupted as recently as 6,000 years ago 
-- suggesting the likelihood of future volcanic events. 
</P>
<P>
Although Department of Energy officials are not concerned with the impact fault 
movement would have on the repository, earthquakes could cause significant 
damage to surface facilities that will serve as temporary way stations for the 
waste. As for volcanic activity, government scientists said it is unlikely 
eruptions would disturb the waste dump. 
</P>
<P>
Other worries relate to the neighboring weapons test site and what effect bomb 
explosions might have on the mountain. But the Department of Energy's Gertz 
calls that a "non-issue," arguing that the repository would weather any tremors 
"like a grape in Jello." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Debate Over Water 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most lively and crucial debate is over water -- namely, how fast it 
is likely to travel from the surface to the repository and beyond. Resolving 
this question is key to determining how soon water might dissolve the waste and 
carry radioactive atoms into ground water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Department of Energy scientists believe most of the rainfall at Yucca Mountain 
evaporates, while the balance seeps slowly downward through pores in the rock. 
If they are correct, it would take thousands of years for moisture both to 
penetrate to the depth of the waste canisters and move onward into the water 
table. Under that scenario, the mountain likely would meet the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission's requirements for licensing. 
</P>
<P>
Hydrologists working for the state, however, suspect that water instead runs 
through fractures in the rock, meaning its rate of travel would be much quicker 
-- and might even be measured in months. 
</P>
<P>
"The trouble with this fractured tuff is that it's very unpredictable, complex 
and difficult to characterize," said Martin Mifflin, a Las Vegas hydrologist 
and consultant for the state. "The DOE is basing its figures on a lot of 
wishful thinking. Their posture that Yucca Mountain might be a suitable site is 
based on a lot of assumptions, which are not verified and are not conservative 
ones." 
</P>
<P>
Then there is Department of Energy scientist Szymanski's theory. He believes 
that a conspiracy of natural events at Yucca Mountain could cause the water 
table to rise and flood the waste repository, possibly leading to the expulsion 
of radioactive water at ground level. 
</P>
<P>
He has urged the department to investigate his concerns and other potential 
show-stoppers quickly or risk losing the public support it needs to succeed 
with the repository project. 
</P>
<P>
"If this is a lemon, I say let's find out now and get the hell out of there," 
Szymanski said in a recent interview in his Las Vegas office. 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, Department of Energy managers have declined to alter their 
study program. "I think we've taken Jerry very seriously and have incorporated 
many studies to try to ascertain what he's after," Gertz said. But "I don't 
agree with those who say we should just look at the potential disqualifiers and 
put off everything else." 
</P>
<P>
Critics have charged that the Department of Energy, like a parent who suspects 
his child is on drugs but fears the truth, is avoiding scientific inquiries 
that might raise doubt about Yucca Mountain's suitability. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Document Cited 
</P>
<P>
Gertz disputed this charge, noting that the department recently released a 
6,300-page document outlining plans to sink two exploratory shafts into the 
mountain later this year and create an "underground laboratory" to determine 
whether the site is safe. 
</P>
<P>
"No decision has been made on this site yet," Gertz said. And Szymanski said he 
does not see "the dark forces" many critics believe are at work. 
</P>
<P>
But despite such assurances, state officials say the department's record of 
managing the nation's weapon production facilities does not inspire confidence. 
With the country's three primary bomb-building operations closed for safety 
reasons and faced with an estimated $81-billion cleanup, the department's 
credibility may be at an all-time low. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up as a child in Las Vegas, and I remember well the DOE's predecessor 
suggesting it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to go out on the flats and 
see the flash from above-ground weapons blasts," Nevada Gov. Bob Miller said in 
an interview. "I would suggest that was a poor recommendation, and I'm not 
convinced they are any better prepared to give us scientific certainty about 
the safety of below-ground storage." 
</P>
<P>
Even U.S. Energy Secretary James D. Watkins charged during his Senate 
confirmation hearings that managers of the department's weapons plants too 
often sacrificed public safety in an effort to protect secrecy and meet 
production goals. 
</P>
<P>
And last spring, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission called the Department of 
Energy's quality assurance program at Yucca Mountain inadequate and said much 
of the data collected during 10 years of studies there would be useless for 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing. Specifically, 50,000 feet of core 
samples taken from the rock cannot be used because the Department of Energy 
cannot document from what depth they came. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Poor Quality Assurance' 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't have adequate planning or record keeping . . . and what it results 
in is some doubts about the data, how it was obtained, and so forth," said 
Robert M. Bernero, director of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Office of 
Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards. "The problem with poor quality 
assurance is you've wasted effort, but worse yet . . . people without good 
strict discipline can end up ruining the site." 
</P>
<P>
Gertz acknowledged the problem but said the core samples were collected in 
"scoping studies" and were "not necessarily intended for use in licensing 
procedures." 
</P>
<P>
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has also charged that the Department of 
Energy's proposed site investigation was "too narrowly focused," Bernero said. 
The commission felt the department was failing to "take into account 
alternative hypotheses" and "might not be keeping an open mind," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another blow came in August when 16 scientists with the U.S. Geological Survey 
complained in a stinging memo that the Department of Energy was barring them 
from performing research critical to deciding whether the site is suitable. The 
memo suggested that the department was interested only in data that would get 
the repository built. 
</P>
<P>
In "subjugating the technical program to satisfy DOE political objectives, we 
may succeed in making the program comply with regulations, while being 
scientifically indefensible," the scientists wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Gertz said the Geological Survey researchers were stalled because they failed 
to meet quality assurance standards, adding that the Department of Energy 
"merely wants to ensure the documentation of their work." Tony Buono, a 
Geological Survey scientist who did not sign the memo, agreed and said his 
colleagues are "just not accustomed to the rigorous oversight inherent in this 
project." 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the nuclear power industry has joined the chorus of critics. 
Utility customers pour $400 million annually into a fund that will pay for 
disposal of nuclear waste. With delays already postponing the estimated opening 
of the repository for five years, operators at many of the nation's 114 
commercial plants have been forced to expand facilities for storing the deadly 
waste on their property -- an expensive undertaking shouldered by consumers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Getting More and More Behind' 
</P>
<P>
"We're very concerned that the DOE has spent $2 billion of our money already 
and just seems to be getting more and more behind," said Diane Smiroldo, a 
spokeswoman for the Edison Electric Institute. 
</P>
<P>
State officials and others lobbying against the repository believe that in the 
end they will prevail in the battle over Yucca Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Richard Bryan, who as governor fought doggedly against locating the dump 
in his state, noted that Nevada's congressional delegation is for the first 
time unified in its opposition to the project. Gone are the days when the 
state's Washington representatives suggested that Nevadans had a "patriotic 
duty" to host the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Momentum is also building in the Nevada Legislature. Last month, lawmakers 
approved two resolutions declaring their opposition to the dump and killed 
plans for a committee to negotiate with federal officials over economic bonuses 
Nevada could reap if Yucca Mountain is selected. Several lawsuits against the 
U.S. government are pending as well. 
</P>
<P>
"The scientific community that supports waste disposal at Yucca Mountain is 
suffering from a huge case of hubris," said Bob Fulkerson of Citizen Alert, a 
1,320-member activist group based in Reno. "It's just a matter of time before 
the gods strike them down and we win." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Mountain Home For Radioactive Waste 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Energy wants to bury 70,000 metric tons of deadly waste from 
commerical reactors and weapons plants 1,000 feet under Yucca Mountain. A 
116-mile grid of tunnels would house the repository. Waste would come by truck 
or rail for 26 years, then the site would be sealed. 
</P>
<P>
The Pros. . . 
</P>
<P>
The Yucca Mountain site has a natural advantage because it is formed of 
tuff-layers of volcanic ash that spouted from nearby volcanoes more than 13 
million years ago. The tuff contains zeolites, minerals capable of removing 
radioactive particles from water. Zeolites act like a strainer, allowing water 
to pass but trapping larger radioactive particles. 
</P>
<P>
. . .And the Cons 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials say Yucca Mountain's geology and its remote, dry location 
make it a good choice. But others are not so sure . Questions have been raised 
about the mountain's stability because earthquake faults run through it. There 
also is concern about possible volcanic activity in the area. And some 
scientists worry that moisture might seep through the rock to the storage 
vault, where it could corrode the waste canisters. If this scenario occurred, 
it could introduce radioactive materials into the water table, which stretches 
across the California border to Death Valley National Moument, 25 miles to the 
west.

JAPANESE FIGHT U.S. BASES IN NEW BATTLE OF OKINAWA

AHA, Japan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This tiny hamlet of sugar cane farmers, nestled quietly in a thick forest in 
the north of Okinawa, is waging a symbolic battle that may signal a new era in 
the military alliance binding the United States and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Marine Corps wants to build a landing pad about a mile away to train 
Marines in the tactical use of Harrier jets, a combat aircraft that can take 
off and land vertically. 
</P>
<P>
But the villagers say they are prepared to lie down in front of the bulldozers 
and shed their own blood, if necessary, to prevent it. 
</P>
<P>
"Politically, I'd say we're basically conservative around here," said Mitsutaka 
Toyama, headman of Aha, which has a population of 280. "We've got no particular 
quarrel with the (U.S.-Japan) security treaty, but we're absolutely opposed to 
the noise, the pollution and the danger that will come with that Harrier pad." 
</P>
<P>
The community's tenacious, emotional resistance to the small airstrip -- which 
the Marines can lawfully build without local approval in a training zone leased 
to them under joint security arrangements -- tells the story of changing 
attitudes about the American military presence on Japanese soil. 
</P>
<P>
What was once passive resignation to an unwanted nuisance is being replaced by 
intolerance and irritability -- and a trace of nationalistic pride. Problems 
are cropping up all across crowded Japan, which is host to 63,460 U.S. military 
personnel, the largest such deployment in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, Japanese newspapers published scathing editorials condemning a 
U.S. Navy ship for endangering the public by firing practice shells in Tokyo 
Bay, some of which landed about 1,000 feet from a Japanese coast guard vessel. 
</P>
<P>
Citizen groups in the Tokyo suburb of Zushi have been up in arms about a 
proposal to build a U.S. military housing compound in Ikego Forest, which they 
say is environmentally sensitive. Incensed residents of Miyake Island, in the 
Pacific about 115 miles south of Tokyo, have quashed plans to build an airstrip 
for night landing practice by pilots from U.S. Navy carriers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Keystone of Pacific' 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere is the problem more acute than on Okinawa, the main island of the 
Ryukyu chain that makes up Japan's southernmost prefecture, or state. 
</P>
<P>
Occupied by the U.S. military for 27 years after World War II until its 
reversion to Japanese sovereignty in 1972, Okinawa retains the atmosphere of a 
military camp. And its geographic location, halfway between Tokyo and Manila, 
gives it the dubious distinction of being the "Keystone of the Pacific" in the 
defense strategy of the Western allies. 
</P>
<P>
American military personnel, their dependents and U.S. civilian employees of 
the Department of Defense account for one of every 22 residents of Okinawa 
prefecture, which has a population of 1.2 million. U.S. bases and training 
areas cover one-fifth the surface of Okinawa, including a significant 
proportion of its densely populated central and southern parts. 
</P>
<P>
Local activists and conservative politicians complain that while Okinawa 
constitutes about 0.5% of Japan's land mass, it provides 75% of the land 
expropriated for U.S. military use under the security treaty. The U.S. bases 
block economic development, and the disproportionate burden is simply not fair, 
Okinawans say. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposition Gaining Support 
</P>
<P>
The leftist political opposition and militant labor movement have waged a 
campaign to drive out the bases since reversion. But now their anti-base 
rhetoric is gaining a sympathetic ear among the generally conservative, 
pro-American people who reside near the bases -- including many who owe their 
livelihood to the military economy. 
</P>
<P>
Even local leaders of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, ostensibly an 
unflinching proponent of the U.S.-Japan military alliance, find that they must 
embrace the populist anti-base cause to ensure their political survival. 
Conservative Gov. Junji Nishime, who advocates a sharp reduction in U.S. bases 
here, has visited the Pentagon twice in the past two years to complain about 
training accidents and lax military discipline. 
</P>
<P>
Nishime, originally a supporter of the Harrier pad in Aha, has bowed to 
pressure and now opposes the project, which has come to symbolize an 
intensification of military activity at a time of declining public tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
Stray bullets from firing ranges, the misuse of tear-gas grenades, a fatal 
helicopter crash and a spate of training-related brush fires over the past two 
years have also generated considerable outrage, which has been amplified by an 
activist local press. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Half Want Bases Removed 
</P>
<P>
More than half the population wants the bases removed because they are a 
"danger" or "not needed," according to recent surveys. Resentment of the 
omnipresent American military is clearly growing, despite what U.S. authorities 
say is an improvement in military-related crime and training accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Local news media "intent upon fueling that resentment" are creating the false 
perception that the situation is getting worse, Karl Spence Richardson, the 
U.S. consul general in Okinawa, wrote in an unclassified cable to the State 
Department last month. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though our record, when viewed in context and over a period of years, has 
improved steadily, we are likely to be dogged by a public perception at odds 
with these facts," Richardson wrote. 
</P>
<P>
In Aha, an acrimonious dispute over the airstrip has flared for more than two 
years now, resulting in two major confrontations at the building site. One 
confrontation turned violent, with a melee between protesters and military 
police in January, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Marines Need Training Site 
</P>
<P>
And tension is building again as the Marines prepare to deploy their first 
squadron of a dozen AV-8B Harriers in Japan sometime this summer. They 
desperately need a place to train. The Aha site, a flat area created during 
construction of a nearby dam, is ideal because it will cost about $130,000 to 
finish, compared to an estimated $20 million needed to develop other sites. 
</P>
<P>
The central government's Defense Facilities Administration Agency, which 
provides the U.S. military with property under the Status of Forces Agreement, 
has insisted that the Aha site is the only viable choice. The alternative would 
be to level a hilltop or fill a valley, causing serious environmental damage 
and further threatening the endangered noguchi gera, a small woodpecker native 
to the region that the foes of the Harrier pad say they want to protect. 
</P>
<P>
Fearful that opposition will be ignored, Aha villagers and their sympathizers 
have built a surveillance hut at the entrance to the construction site and have 
organized a series of demonstrations throughout the island. About 6,000 people 
attended one rally in central Okinawa at the beginning of March. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resistance Could Be Violent 
</P>
<P>
"If they go ahead and try to build the Harrier pad by force, there's going to 
be bloodshed up there -- the old folks are prepared to sacrifice themselves," 
said Masahide Nakamatsu, a conservative member of the Okinawa Prefectural 
Assembly who heads the chamber's special committee on U.S. bases. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a rise in the anti-base mood now that's never existed before," 
Nakamatsu warned. "And any attempt to force through the project will have 
disastrous results. The entire population will rise up and join the struggle 
against the bases." 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. James L. Vance, public affairs officer for the Marines on Okinawa, 
said he suspects the protests reflect a "rising nationalism throughout the 
Pacific Rim," akin to the mood in South Korea -- another U.S. ally where the 
public is questioning security relations with the United States -- and in the 
Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
Vance said the Marines have renewed efforts to respect the "deeply rooted 
sensitivities of the Okinawan people" since amphibious training in a drinking 
water reservoir sparked a barrage of protests last June. The Harrier pad, he 
said, will be dealt with gingerly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Want to Avoid Conflict 
</P>
<P>
"We have to have the landing pad, but we're not going to build it there if it 
means another confrontation with the people," Vance said. "Are the Marines 
going to go up there and thump old ladies and kids? The village idiot knows the 
answer to that: Hell, no." 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere on the island, the Marines are already in retreat. Last December, 
they were forced to shut down a firing range at Camp Hansen, a large base in 
the center of the island, after neighboring villagers found spent M-16 bullets 
in their midst. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble started in October, when Chiyo Yamazato, an employee of a small 
distillery in Igei Village, said she heard a "ping" outside the workshop where 
she was washing bottles one morning. She found a bullet on the driveway when 
she went out to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
"More than 40 years have gone by since the war, and the American soldiers are 
still here," complained Mitsuko Sakiyama, owner of the distillery, which makes 
awamori, a potent local rice whiskey. "They came and apologized every time we 
found shrapnel on our roof, but nothing has changed. There's no other country 
in the world where this is allowed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stray Bullets in Village 
</P>
<P>
An investigation revealed that ricocheting bullets had landed at five other 
sites in the village, apparently caused when Marines fired their rifles in the 
wrong direction after outflanking practice targets. 
</P>
<P>
"We're afraid the next time this happens, someone is going to get killed," said 
Masafumi Ikehara, Igei's headman. 
</P>
<P>
Ikehara estimates that one worker in 10 in Igei has a job at Camp Hansen, and 
he is quick to point out, as do most Okinawans, that the rising anger is 
anti-military, not anti-American. Villagers still play softball regularly with 
Marines from the base. 
</P>
<P>
"We're friends," he said. "We're not against the United States, but we're 
opposed to the base, even though we owe a lot to it." 
</P>
<P>
The announcement by the Marines on Dec. 23 that they would respond to local 
concerns by closing the firing range where the mishap occurred -- while keeping 
three nearby ranges open -- was overshadowed the following day by another 
sensational incident. On Christmas Eve, an unidentified man described as a tall 
foreigner detonated a military tear-gas grenade inside a crowded disco in 
Okinawa City. About 25 people were injured in the ensuing panic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Love-Hate Relationship 
</P>
<P>
The love-hate relationship with the American military is legendary on Okinawa, 
the only place in Japan where fighting raged in World War II. Many people here 
harbor deep bitterness toward the imperial Japanese army for committing 
atrocities during the Battle of Okinawa, a holocaust that took the lives of 
150,000 civilians and Okinawans in uniform -- about a third of the population 
at the time, according to historian Masahide Ota of the University of the 
Ryukyus. 
</P>
<P>
While ritual protests against the military continue, local merchants do a 
booming business selling military surplus items to tourists from the main 
Japanese islands. On neon-lit Kokusai Dori, the main street in the prefectural 
capital of Naha, one can buy genuine U.S. Army boots or T-shirts emblazoned 
with an eagle on an American flag and the caption, "Live Free or Die." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, economic dependence on the U.S. bases has declined drastically since the 
heyday of the Vietnam War, when Okinawa was a major staging area and 
equipment-repair center. The U.S. military employed about 30,000 Okinawans in 
the late 1960s, but now has about 7,000 civilians on its payroll, the majority 
of whom belong to a socialist-affiliated union that advocates the removal of 
the bases. 
</P>
<P>
"We often get told that working at the bases and protesting at the same time is 
like sticking our own necks in a noose," said Misao Kamiyama, chairman of the 
Okinawa Prefectural Labor Union Council. "Certainly there's a contradiction. 
But if the Americans want to train for war, why can't they do it in their own 
country? Okinawa says no." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Boost to Economy 
</P>
<P>
Not all Okinawa is saying no these days, however. Rents paid by the central 
Japanese government for land appropriated from local owners for the bases total 
$310 million a year and provide a significant boost to the economy in Japan's 
poorest prefecture. Although pork-barrel public works and even tourism have 
surpassed military-related income since reversion, the U.S. bases still account 
for about 9% of Okinawa's economy, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"You can still earn a lot more renting to the U.S. military than growing sugar 
cane," said Moriteru Arasaki, president of Okinawa University and a leader of a 
dwindling movement of landlords in favor of the bases. 
</P>
<P>
The central government, meanwhile, remains an accommodating host to the 
American occupying army that stayed on in remote Okinawa, out of sight and mind 
for most Japanese. It has enthusiastically embraced the concept of "burden 
sharing," providing about $45,000 a year in subsidies for each U.S. serviceman 
and woman stationed in Japan in a program to help offset the weakened dollar. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Support No Longer Certain 
</P>
<P>
Despite central government good will, the United States can no longer count on 
unconditional support from the Japanese public. This is a crucial lesson 
because the bases in Okinawa and elsewhere in Japan would take on increased 
strategic importance should the U.S. military be forced to phase out its 
presence in the Philippines or reduce deployment on the Korean Peninsula, where 
north-south reconciliation may someday require a lower posture. 
</P>
<P>
As tension and mistrust builds, however, critics say little or nothing is being 
done to address the heart of the issue, that the troops are here to stay, so 
long as Japan honors its treaty commitments. 
</P>
<P>
"Until the government shows a willingness to resolve the problem, we're in a 
stalemate," said Ryoichi Toyohira, managing editor of the Okinawa Times, one of 
two leading Japanese-language dailies on the island. "It's inevitable that 
we'll have the U.S. military here as long as we have the security treaty. And 
we can't solve anything by making them move to the main islands. We're all 
Japanese, and we don't want to dump our nuisance on someone else." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Uneasy Neighbors 
</P>
<P>
The island of Okinawa, the only place in Japan where fighting raged during 
World War II, is today the most dramatic illustration of changing attitudes 
about the American military presence on Japanese soil. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military community accounts for 1 in every 22 residents of Okinawa 
Prefecture, which has a population of 1.2 million, and U.S. military land 
covers one-fifth of Okinawa. 
</P>
<P>
Sparked by stray bullets from firing ranges, misuse of tear-gas grenades and a 
fatal helicopter crash, Okinawa's leftist political opposition and militant 
labor movement are campaigning to drive out the bases, and surveys show that 
more than half the population wants the bases removed.

PINPOINT LANDING CAPS DISCOVERY'S BRILLIANT MISSION 
</P>

Sweeping down over a near-record crowd of 450,000 jubilant spectators, the 
space shuttle Discovery glided in to a triumphant landing here Saturday 
morning, ending a five-day, $375-million mission that National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration officials termed nearly perfect. 
</P>
<P>
After 79 orbits during which the astronauts launched a $100-million satellite, 
tested a heat radiator for the proposed space station and photographed large 
sections of the Earth's surface in an attempt to monitor environmental damage, 
Cmdr. Michael Coats and pilot John Blaha eased the 195,000-pound Discovery down 
precisely on the center of the long concrete runway here at 6:36 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrating the third successful shuttle mission since the January, 1986, 
explosion that destroyed the Challenger, Rear Adm. Richard Truly, a veteran 
astronaut and head of the shuttle program, exulted: "We're back." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the crowd seemed to share his view. "It was wonderful. It gave me goose 
bumps and made the hair on the back of my neck stand up," said Jackie Gillespie 
of Lake Forest. "The emotional quiet before it landed was really amazing, with 
everybody holding their breath," added Jim Simpson of Thousand Oaks. "It was 
uplifting." 
</P>
<P>
Coats, 43, Blaha, 46, and crew members James Bagian, 37, Robert Springer, 46, 
and James Buchli, 43, made a brief, emotional appearance before boarding a jet 
for Houston nearly five hours after touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God for America," Blaha said. "We have a free country. We have a great 
educational system that produces engineering expertise that allows us to build 
something like this space shuttle. So we're blessed. God bless you and God 
bless America." 
</P>
<P>
After a brief inspection of the Discovery, Truly said that the orbiter and its 
heat-shielding tiles came through virtually unscathed, a sharp contrast to the 
Atlantis mission in January in which the tiles were heavily pitted, most likely 
as a result of insulation that broke free from the nose of one booster rocket 
during separation. 
</P>
<P>
Modifications made to Discovery to prevent insulation from breaking loose were 
apparently successful, Truly said. "The vehicle is as clean as any orbiter that 
I personally have ever seen," he said. "There is almost no visible tile 
damage." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seven Missions Planned 
</P>
<P>
The most important goal of this mission, the first of seven scheduled for 1989, 
was the launch of the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite to complete a 
globe-girdling communications network that allows the space agency to keep in 
touch with the shuttle during 85% of its orbit. 
</P>
<P>
One TDRS was launched before the Challenger disaster and the second on the 
first post-Challenger flight. Completion of the network will allow the agency 
to close five ground tracking stations for an annual savings of $27 million. 
</P>
<P>
The TDRS system also allowed ground controllers to maintain contact with 
Discovery during its re-entry blackout period when ionized gases prevent normal 
communications with the ground -- the first time such contact has been 
achieved. 
</P>
<P>
With the tracking system complete, Truly said, "Now the fun begins," referring 
to a series of science-oriented missions NASA has planned. In April, the 
orbiter Atlantis will launch the $530-million Magellan probe to Venus, which 
will use radar to map 80% of the planet's surface. Other planned scientific 
missions include the Galileo mission to Jupiter, the Ulysses mission to orbit 
the sun and the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope and the Gamma Ray 
Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
NASA will also launch Department of Defense payloads in two classified shuttle 
missions this summer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Experiment With Rats 
</P>
<P>
After the landing, four crippled rats who were aboard Discovery, as well as 
four others in a control group kept on the ground, were killed with injections 
of sodium pentobarbital. A non-weight-bearing bone in one hind leg of each rat 
was severed before launch in the experiment to learn how fast bones heal in the 
weightlessness of space compared to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated 450,000 people who viewed the landing was second in size only to 
the 500,000 who viewed the July 4, 1982, landing of Columbia, the fourth 
shuttle mission, which was also attended by then-President Ronald Reagan. NASA 
officials had predicted only 200,000 would attend this weekend, about the same 
number who had viewed the first post-Challenger landing last October. Many of 
the visitors said they would not have been able to attend had the landing not 
been on a Saturday.

COMPUTER HACKER WITH A GENIUS IQ CHOOSES STREET LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the small park in front of Horton Plaza, the downtown shopping mall, the 
usual assortment of drifters, derelicts and screaming street corner 
proselytizers are gathered on a warm afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Among them is William Troy Landreth, a young homeless man with a genius-level 
IQ who at age 18 became an underground hero to computer hackers nationwide. A 
pioneer in the craft, he was known at the height of his fame only by his code 
name: The Cracker. 
</P>
<P>
To authorities, including the FBI, Landreth was a security threat, a teen-ager 
who used a personal computer and telephone in his bedroom in suburban Poway, 
north of San Diego, to tap into supposedly secure computer networks used by the 
Department of Defense and NASA, among others. 
</P>
<P>
In a highly publicized crackdown, the FBI came down on Landreth and a handful 
of the other original hackers. It was 1983, the same year of the popular movie 
"War Games," in which a young computer hacker almost starts World War III by 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Computer trespassing was so new then that there was no federal law against it. 
The government finally turned to one of the oldest "high-technology" laws on 
the books: wire fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Landreth eventually pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud, was fined $87 
for using someone else's computer time and placed on three years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
The crime brought Landreth notoriety, led him to write a book about his 
exploits that will soon be reprinted and provided him with work as a consultant 
who showed companies how to ward off computer intruders like himself. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the 24-year-old Landreth spends his nights in homeless shelters, if he 
can get in. Sometimes, when he is organized enough to get money, he rents a 
flophouse room. Otherwise, a concrete doorway passes for a bed. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't drink alcohol but he smokes marijuana as often as he can get it, he 
said. And he prefers passing sunny afternoons lounging in a small park in front 
of Horton Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Very Polite 
</P>
<P>
His hair is brown and shoulder-length; he has a wispy mustache and he is thin 
for someone 5-feet-8. He is extremely polite, a trait he's always had, 
according to friends and family. Though he is sociable, he is introverted. He 
has never had a driver's license and relies on buses for transportation. His IQ 
has been measured at 163, well into the genius category. 
</P>
<P>
Landreth said he has been diagnosed as a manic depressive, and, after a 
court-ordered psychiatric exam, was prescribed several anti-depressant and 
mood-enhancing drugs. But they all made him worse, he said, and he stopped 
taking them. The last was lithium, which he hasn't had in a long time. What has 
remained, however, are the deep valleys of depression. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews with The Times, Landreth was straightforward and lucid, though he 
often punctuated his sentences with smiles and muted laughter, as though privy 
to inside jokes or playing a game. Occasionally, his conversation rambled, then 
suddenly became very precise. He is, he said, despite his current condition, 
confident in his ability to control computers and to be paid handsomely for 
doing so. All he has to do, he said, is turn on his switch. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still Confident 
</P>
<P>
"I could set up a data base system for a company and walk away with a few 
thousand dollars for five or six hours work, and they'd never regret it," he 
said. "The five or six thousand for five or six hours of work would interest 
me, but I haven't fallen for it. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't inherit a great deal of money that's been accumulating for several 
eons, so I wouldn't know how to look at money." 
</P>
<P>
Landreth, the eldest of nine children, was 13 when he bought his first computer 
at the local Radio Shack store, using money his parents paid him for 
baby-sitting. "He really took an interest in it," said his mother, Susan 
Fourmyle, who lives in Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Both Landreth and his mother said he had much freedom as a young teen-ager, 
freedom to come and go and freedom to sit in his bedroom for 20 hours at a time 
playing with his computer. Part of the reason, he said, is that his parents 
were occupied chasing their own Utopian dreams, moving from Poway to Alaska to 
Hawaii and back to California in the mid-'80s. 
</P>
<P>
Eight years ago, Landreth's parents changed their last name to Fourmyle, taking 
on the name of a character in the science-fiction novel "The Star's My 
Destination" by Alfred Bester. Landreth's father, Gulliver, formerly in the 
import-export business, is a fledgling science-fiction writer given to sweeping 
mood swings that require him to take lithium, according to his wife, Susan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Kind of Sad' 
</P>
<P>
She said in an interview that she thinks her son, whom she rarely sees, and her 
husband are afflicted with similar demons. "It's really kind of sad," she said. 
"Billy needs psychiatric help. He needs lithium. He doesn't recognize he has a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I suggested he get treatment, but he thought we were calling him crazy and 
took it very negatively," Susan Fourmyle said. "I'm real concerned about him . 
. . what he's doing is a dangerous way to live." 
</P>
<P>
Landreth's closest friend is Tom Anderson, who met "The Cracker" long before he 
ever met the person. Anderson was 13 or 14 when he found "The Cracker" through 
a computer bulletin board. "I looked up to him a lot," said Anderson, now 18, 
of Escondido. "He knew everything." And Landreth passed on his knowledge to his 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI confiscated Anderson's computer equipment in 1985 because he had 
entered Chase Manhattan Bank's computer network, and, at age 14, he was 
sentenced to a one-year probation. Anderson and Landreth talk by phone about 
once a week, and Landreth keeps his computer at Anderson's home, where he 
occasionally drops by to do some work. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who has written and had published a book on telecommunications 
programs, said his friend has always been mysterious but has never seemed quite 
as out of touch as he is now. "Before he was just real smart, even though his 
ideas were a bit strange. But he was just Bill," Anderson said. "Now I think 
something is wrong . . . he said he wanted to live on the streets because he 
wanted to experience being a minority." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seemed in Control 
</P>
<P>
While Anderson was having his legal problems, Landreth seemed in control of his 
life in 1985 and 1986. He was giving lectures to business executives, doing 
free-lance computer work for corporations and was promoting his book, "Out of 
the Inner Circle," in cities throughout the country. His publisher, Microsoft 
Press of Redmond, Wash., said the book has sold about 68,000 copies since it 
was first printed in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The book's name was taken from Landreth's secret society of elite hackers 
called the Inner Circle. "We were explorers, not spies," his book said, "and to 
us, damaging computer files was not only clumsy and inelegant, it was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
To this day, he maintains that the only reason he was indicted was that the FBI 
wanted to send a message to hackers throughout the country. "There wasn't an 
accusation of danger in the whole charge," Landreth said. "The FBI really 
needed to crack down on hacking, mostly because of the 'War Games' movie. They 
could only get a lead onto some simple crimes . . . that really aren't crimes 
at all." 
</P>
<P>
Landreth was accused of breaking into the Virginia-based GTE Telemail 
electronic mail network, where he peeked at National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration and Defense Department computer correspondence, and set up files 
surreptitiously for his and other hackers' personal use. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disappearance 
</P>
<P>
The lawbreaking behind him, Landreth appeared to have found himself. But in 
September, 1986, he disappeared, leaving the screen of his IBM-PC computer at 
Anderson's home glowing with an uncompleted sentence. And he had written a 
rambling, esoteric eight-page essay that touched upon such subjects as man's 
evolution and immortality, communism and capitalism, nuclear war and greed, and 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
"I was bored in school, bored traveling around the country, bored getting 
raided by the FBI, bored in prison, bored writing books, bored being bored. I 
will probably be bored dead, but this is my risk to take," read the last page. 
</P>
<P>
After drifting for almost a year, Landreth turned up in the small Oregon town 
of McMinnville, near Portland, where a woman called the police after Landreth 
had wandered near her yard and asked for a drink of water. He was dirty and 
barefoot, and he was arrested for violating his probation and sent back to San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
When he returned, federal Judge Rudi Brewster, who throughout the legal process 
has tried to guide the troubled Landreth rather than punish him, extended his 
probation. To his surprise, Landreth also discovered that he had about $9,000 
waiting for him in book royalties from foreign sales. He rented a Poway 
apartment, set up a word processor and paid his attorney. But the apartment 
burned in May, Landreth ran out of cash, and "then I came here (downtown San 
Diego), where it's simple to live." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Troubles 
</P>
<P>
There are, however, complications to that simplicity. He has been robbed of his 
stereo radio by a street tough who enticed him into a game of three-card monte 
and he has accumulated several citations from police for infractions such as 
sleeping in public, riding the trolley without a ticket and jaywalking. He 
never pays the fines or goes to court, even though he knows this could 
eventually land him in jail. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really part of their organization, and I really don't think about it 
as being important," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, after he was stopped on the street by police and found to be in 
violation of his probation, Judge Brewster terminated his probation, noting 
that the courts could do nothing to help Landreth. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we had really exhausted what can be done," Landreth's lawyer, Peter J. 
Hughes, said after the March 6 hearing. "We were trying to be his parents, and 
we can't be. This is really no longer something that the criminal justice 
system can accomplish." 
</P>
<P>
Although Landreth tries to keep up on the rapidly changing world of computers 
by reading technical magazines at the downtown central library, he admits he's 
behind. Nonetheless, he recently wrote a seven-page essay on computer viruses 
that will be included in the reprinting of his book. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Disappointment' 
</P>
<P>
"The way I see it, I could be retired in five or 10 years, if I did things in a 
constructive way . . . but I haven't decided to do that," Landreth said. "The 
disappointment I have in life is mostly for the general population, I think. I 
don't think they see their institutions at all. I think they're still 200 or 
300 years old, still serving a state long ago. Things could change for the 
better." 
</P>
<P>
As for the immediate future, Landreth said that he will probably remain on the 
streets and that he may move again, perhaps to Los Angeles or farther north. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to say what might happen, overall. Every 30 seconds is highly 
unpredictable," Landreth said. "I'm usually working on a system of feedback 
that I don't try and second-guess. I would say that's how I'm working." 
</P>
<P>
It's his personal definition of freedom, his choice, the way he wants to live, 
even though he knows some of his friends and his family believe he is confused 
and wasting his life. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what (freedom) is good for any more than anyone else knows what 
it's good for," he said, the Chesire cat in him surfacing. "So it's really in 
how you look at it."

Two pups born to First Dog Millie may be named Patrick and Patricia in honor of 
their arrival in the White House beauty parlor late on St. Patrick's Day, a 
spokeswoman for First Lady Barbara Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Over a five-hour period, ending early Saturday, the English springer spaniel 
delivered a six-pack. 
</P>
<P>
The delivery of Millie's first litter -- five females and a male -- brought a 
tear to the eyes of the First Lady and the President, Mrs. Bush said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The puppies were described as healthy and "nursing vigorously," although their 
mother also spent some time cavorting on the White House lawn. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bush, who served as midwife, said the President joined her to watch the 
birth of one of the pups in a special whelping box. 
</P>
<P>
"The President and I cried when we saw one of them being born . . . . We had a 
tear. It was really sweet. It was so beautiful to see her," Mrs. Bush said. The 
President described the birth, the "first dog delivery" he had witnessed, as 
"really beautiful, it was unbelievable." Mrs. Bush indicated that he had never 
seen any children born, either. 
</P>
<P>
All six of the puppies are already promised to new owners, including one for 
granddaughter Marshall Bush, 2, who was at the White House on Saturday with her 
parents, Marvin and Margaret Bush, and another for the twin daughters of Bush's 
son George in Texas. The sire's family also will get a puppy. But the pups will 
spend a few weeks at their birthplace before being moved.

Disclosure that William Barclay Allen, chairman of the Civil Rights Commission, 
was briefly arrested last month in Arizona after personally intervening in a 
child custody case has led the commission's seven other members to demand that 
he apologize to all concerned, and he has agreed to do so. 
</P>
<P>
The case involved Lalita Altaha, a 14-year-old Apache girl who had been adopted 
as an infant by a non-Indian couple, but was returned last year to the White 
Mountain Apache reservation in Arizona under a court order directing that she 
live with her natural mother. 
</P>
<P>
Without the knowledge of other commission members, Allen, and a nine-man party 
including two U.S. marshals and an NBC camera crew, took the girl off a school 
bus on the reservation on Feb. 7. Allen was later held for a short time for 
kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stormy Meeting 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't gotten over the shock yet," said Mary Frances Berry, a member of the 
Civil Rights Commission, as she reported on the outcome of a stormy closed 
meeting the commission held Friday after a public session at which Allen called 
on all of the other members to resign. 
</P>
<P>
"I proposed a motion specifying that we could not approve or condone the 
chairman's actions and requiring that he write everyone involved, including the 
U.S. marshals and the Arizona police, stating that he was not acting within his 
authority," Berry continued. 
</P>
<P>
"He finally agreed that he had not exercised the best judgment and said he 
would write the letters, starting early this week," Berry said during an 
interview Saturday. She said that while Allen did not vote, the seven other 
members of the frequently divided commission supported this approach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Allen Responds 
</P>
<P>
Allen, a political science professor at Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, 
Calif., said in a telephone interview from his home there Saturday that he had 
no problem with apologizing "insofar as my behavior might have contributed to a 
circus atmosphere . . . an atmosphere that I did not design, that was not my 
intention and that I did what I could to end." 
</P>
<P>
Berry said commission members learned first from Arizona legislators of the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued Feb. 9 by Reno Johnson Sr., tribal chairman of 
the White Mountain Apache Nation, Allen and the group, which included Dr. Barry 
Goodfield, a psychologist and a consultant to the commission, took the girl off 
a school bus and questioned her as cameras rolled. Five of the men later 
persuaded her to join them in a car, which her mother pursued. The girl was 
released near her mother's home, Johnson reported. 
</P>
<P>
After the mother, Thurza Altaha, complained to police, Johnson continued, 
Arizona Department of Public Safety officers stopped the two vehicles in which 
Allen and his party were riding and arrested the occupants "at gunpoint." They 
were jailed and held until Allen had satisfactorily identified himself, 
Johnson's statement said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Says He Arrived Late 
</P>
<P>
Allen said Saturday that he had intended only to ask the girl whether her 
wishes had been taken into consideration. He said he had planned a brief 
private meeting with the girl but arrived late, after she had boarded the 
school bus. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was then held on a sidewalk by the bus, in view of the television 
camera crew, Allen said. He blamed Goodfield for suggesting to the girl that 
she could leave the reservation. Allen's account of the events, which he 
summarized in a four-page typed memo and amplified in a 22-page statement he 
read at Friday's commission meeting, made no mention of the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
In it, he said the interview led him to believe that Lalita "felt restrained 
against her will on the reservation, preferred to dwell with her foster parents 
and never had an opportunity to express the preference before a competent 
government entity." He quoted the girl as saying: "I am an outcast here." 
</P>
<P>
According to Johnson's summary, Lalita was adopted at the age of 5 months by a 
Texas couple, Normand and Nadine Desrocher, but the adoption was invalidated in 
1982 by the Arizona Court of Appeals. Last April, Johnson said, an Arizona 
court sentenced the Desrochers to three years of probation and ordered that 
they have no contact with the girl. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demands Explanation 
</P>
<P>
On March 1, Robert A. Destro, a Democrat who is one of four commission members 
named by former President Ronald Reagan, wrote Allen to demand "a full formal 
explanation" of his "unilateral foray" onto the reservation. Destro raised 20 
questions about the incident, among them why Allen had omitted any reference to 
his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to Destro on March 3, Allen left most of the questions unanswered 
but said he would reply to them all in open session at the next commission 
meeting, which took place Friday. At that meeting, according to Berry's 
account, the commission majority objected openly to Allen's intervention. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of responding as these matters were raised and apologizing for his 
actions, Berry said, Allen attacked his colleagues. "He said we had no 
credibility," she said, "that we should all quit."

Iran's prime minister on Saturday denounced the International Civil Aviation 
Organization for its refusal to condemn the United States for downing an 
Iranian airliner last July over the Persian Gulf, killing all 290 people 
aboard. 
</P>
<P>
Official Tehran Radio, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Hussein Moussavi as saying 
that "if anywhere in the world an American had lost a little blood, these same 
international organizations . . . would not let go of the matter. But the 
killing of 290 people . . . is shirked away by a simple apology." 
</P>
<P>
He also was quoted as saying that the agency's refusal to denounce the United 
States showed that "the law of the jungle rules in the international 
organizations." 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. agency announced its decision in Montreal on Friday after an 
eight-month examination of the incident in which the guided-missile cruiser 
Vincennes downed an Iranian Airbus A-300, mistaking it for an attacking Iranian 
warplane. 
</P>
<P>
The agency rejected the request for censure by the Soviet Union and 
Czechoslovakia. Without blaming any country, it adopted a resolution that 
reaffirmed its policy of condemning the use of weapons against civil aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The agency deplored "the tragic incident which occurred as a consequence of 
events and errors in identification of the aircraft." 
</P>
<P>
Edmund Stohr, the U.S. representative to the ICAO, called the decision "a 
judgment that is balanced and treats the truth fairly." 
</P>
<P>
Iran's representative at the ICAO meeting disagreed. "This decision of the 
council is only paving the way for future occurrences of such acts of 
violence," warned Mahmoud Hajighasemali. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy initially contended that the airliner was descending toward the 
warship, was transmitting on a frequency reserved for fighter planes and 
refused repeated requests to identify itself. 
</P>
<P>
However, the ICAO investigation found that the plane had a flight profile 
consistent with that of a commercial aircraft, that only one request for 
identification was specifically coded for it, and that the Vincennes had no 
means of hearing radio transmissions between the Airbus and air traffic 
controllers that might have alerted the warship as to the aircraft's identify.

SALVADOR BOMB HURTS 7; REBELS RENOUNCE ATTACKS IN VOTE TODAY

A bomb exploded beneath a police truck in the capital's central market 
Saturday, injuring seven civilians on the eve of El Salvador's presidential 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses and Red Cross officials said the seven, one of them a boy of 11, were 
hit by shrapnel after leftist guerrillas put the bomb under the pickup truck 
while its occupants were in the market buying vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
The attack was the most serious since Wednesday, when a rebel ban on public 
transportation went into effect. 
</P>
<P>
The ban was issued by the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front in an 
attempt to paralyze traffic and keep voters away from the polls. Most of the 
nation's roads were deserted Saturday. Rebel attacks on power installations 
overnight also left much of El Salvador without electricity and water. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels earlier warned that all polling places would be considered "military 
targets" and vowed to turn "each street into a battleground" during today's 
elections to choose a successor to President Jose Napoleon Duarte, the dominant 
figure in Salvadoran politics for the past eight years. 
</P>
<P>
However, on Saturday, the rebels assured the nation's nearly 1.8 million voters 
that they will not be attacked. Recent surveys indicated that most Salvadorans 
would indeed go to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. team of observers, led by Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky 
and Florida Republican Gov. Bob Martinez, arrived late Saturday in the capital, 
which remained tense as troops began distributing ballots to voters. 
</P>
<P>
Salvador officials said there is no plan to distribute ballots to the 24 
municipalities under rebel control. 
</P>
<P>
Armed forces chief Col. Rene Emilio Ponce has said the military would guarantee 
the security of voters, and that it would provide trucks to take people to the 
polls. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls show voters are expected to favor rightist candidate Alfredo 
Cristiani of the Nationalist Republican Alliance, or Arena, although a runoff 
is expected. 
</P>
<P>
Millionaire businessman Cristiani has promised to seek a national dialogue to 
end the nine-year guerrilla war. 
</P>
<P>
He is opposed by Fidel Chavez Mena of the Christian Democratic Party, a former 
foreign and planning minister. But Chavez Mena has had to fight off accusations 
of corruption and incompetence against his party. 
</P>
<P>
The election also is the first this decade in which a candidate of the left has 
taken part. Guillermo Ungo of the Democratic Convergence, a coalition of 
parties of the left, has focused his campaign on the need for a negotiated end 
to the war.

The 913-megawatt plant began transmitting power again at 7 p.m. Friday, 45 days 
and $13 million after a generator and pump failure forced the reactor out of

A Yuba County man was arrested for threatening two state senators who supported 
legislation that would ban semiautomatic assault weapons, state police said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they found four semiautomatic weapons, more than 10,000 rounds of 
ammunition and about 20 pounds of marijuana when they searched the man's cabin 
in Camptonville, a foothill town about 90 miles north of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Steiner, 51, allegedly made "numerous" threatening phone calls to Senate 
President Pro Tem David A. Roberti, (D-Los Angeles), and Sen. Dan McCorquodale, 
(D-San Jose), at their Capitol offices during the last several weeks, State 
Police Sgt. Peter Ostergar said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the phone calls to Roberti and McCorquodale contained "veiled threats" 
suggesting that their lives would be in jeopardy if they supported a ban on 
military-style weapons. Most of the calls were made to Roberti. 
</P>
<P>
Ostergar said a legislative staffer broke the case earlier this week when he 
asked the caller his name and the caller identified himself. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti is the author of a bill that would virtually ban military-style 
semiautomatic weapons, and McCorquodale voted for it. The bill has passed the 
Senate and a similar bill has passed the Assembly. Roberti has said he plans to 
negotiate changes to his bill with Assembly leaders and Gov. George Deukmejian, 
who has said he prefers the less restrictive Assembly version. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Roberti said he would not comment on the threats for security 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Ostergar said Steiner is being examined by a psychiatrist at a Yuba City mental 
health facility and will be held at least until Wednesday. He was booked at the 
Yuba County Jail and held on $5,000 bail after his arrest Friday afternoon 
outside a small Camptonville grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
Ostergar said Steiner was carrying more than $6,000 in cash and had a 
.22-caliber semiautomatic pistol concealed in his jacket pocket. He refused to 
talk to police. He was arrested for threatening a public official and carrying 
a concealed weapon and later also booked for possessing marijuana for sale and 
being armed while committing a felony. 
</P>
<P>
Other state lawmakers also have received threatening phone calls from people 
warning them not to vote for the gun bill, but Ostergar said police believe 
those calls were not made by Steiner. His arrest is the first stemming from the 
threatening calls and letters.

Three major studies to be released within a year may be inconclusive on whether 
atmospheric nuclear blasts in the 1950s and 1960s in Nevada caused health 
problems such as cancer, scientists said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The first results from two studies sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy 
and the National Cancer Institute focusing on radiation problems in Western 
states are due by the end of this year, and results from a nationwide study by 
the National Cancer Institute should be released within a year. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the three studies met Saturday to discuss their efforts with 
scientists conducting a fourth study on radiation releases during the last four 
decades from the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Extremely Difficult' 
</P>
<P>
"I think the overall result of the study is going to be that while there has 
been some harm done by these tests, finding that harm is going to be extremely 
difficult to do," said Lynn Anspaugh, director of environmental sciences at 
Livermore National Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
Anspaugh is scientific director for the Offsite Radiation Review Project, which 
the Energy Department started in 1979 in the hope of determining the radiation 
doses people received in Western states from the Nevada atmospheric weapons 
tests that were conducted mainly in the 1950s and that ended in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Anspaugh said the study has confirmed previous reports that people in St. 
George, Utah, received doses of radiation much higher than what normally occurs 
in the environment -- particularly children who drank milk contaminated because 
cows ate radioactive feed. 
</P>
<P>
"Within the other locations throughout the area we think the doses were quite a 
bit smaller than that, although at some isolated locations like ranches and so 
forth the doses might have been somewhat larger," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Principal Investigator 
</P>
<P>
Walter Stevens, dean of the University of Utah Medical School, is principal 
investigator for a National Cancer Institute study on whether residents of 
southern Utah, western Nevada and northern Arizona suffered higher rates of 
leukemia and thyroid disease because of the tests. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the study has found a direct link between the tests and cancer, 
he said, "We're dealing with a small number of people so it may be difficult to 
give an absolute answer of yes, no or maybe." 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing that is alarming," he said of the results so far. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Bouville, lead scientist for the National Cancer Institute study trying 
to determine radiation doses nationwide from the Nevada fallout, also said 
there is considerable uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Milk Contamination 
</P>
<P>
That study focuses on how milk became contaminated because cows ingested 
radioactive iodine 131, and has found great differences among how much milk 
individual people drank at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"You find evidence -- at least indirect evidence -- of contamination all 
throughout the United States. Generally speaking, the people living in the 
eastern United States were more exposed than people living in the West because 
of prevailing winds from west to east.

Some parents of children from the Ecclesia Athletic Assn. have been ordered to

<P>
Phil Lemman, a spokesman for the state Department of Justice, said Friday that 
18 Ecclesia parents who are living in Oregon have been ordered to pay a total 
of $4,596 a month as long as their children are in state custody. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a lawyer representing one of four Ecclesia members charged with 
manslaughter in the girl's death said Eldridge J. Broussard Jr., founder of the 
group, has ended a 40-day personal retreat and has begun meeting again with 
attorneys in the case.

For the last two years, a New York advertising executive and two NBC vice 
presidents have been doing a lot of believing, and a lot of hopeful clapping. 
</P>
<P>
What they wanted to bring back to life wasn't just Tinker Bell, but the 1960 
production of the musical "Peter Pan" starring Mary Martin which has not been 
televised for 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
Like most children's stories, this one has a happy ending -- "Peter Pan" will 
fly again Friday on NBC (8-10 p.m.). But making it happen was a long, involved 
undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
When this production of "Peter Pan" first aired as a "spectacular," as specials 
were called in those days, it seemed a natural to become a TV perennial, like 
"The Wizard of Oz" and the traditional holiday classics. But after three more 
airings (1963, 1966 and 1973), it vanished. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the general public perception was that perhaps the tape had 
been erased, or that if a tape did exist, it probably had deteriorated and was 
no longer of broadcast quality. The real reason, it turns out, was that "Peter 
Pan" was encumbered by a very complex set of copyrights, contracts and options 
that kept it off the air. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Riesenberg, president of Maltese Productions/Maltese Video in New York 
City, became the prime mover in getting "Peter Pan" back on NBC after he took 
his wife and 3-year-old son to a screening of the show at a Museum of 
Broadcasting TV festival in New York in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"The magic was still there," he said the other day, fondly remembering the show 
from his boyhood. "There were a lot of kids in the audience and they loved it. 
They were laughing and yelling, and I came out exhilarated." 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Riesenberg, who at the time was senior vice president, program 
development for the advertising agency BBDO, got on the telephone. He called 
his client, Campbell Soup Co., and received an OK to go after the rights. He 
called London and found that for the first time in many years, the rights were 
available. (Sir James M. Barrie left "Peter Pan" to a children's hospital so 
that profits from the story would benefit generations of children.) 
</P>
<P>
And he called Susan Beckett, vice president, business affairs, NBC Productions, 
and found "she too felt passionate about getting 'Peter Pan' shown again." 
Together, they started shepherding the complicated process of clearing up all 
the rights. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, NBC's "Peter Pan" tapes were unearthed from the network's 
storage vaults in the East and sent to NBC Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
"Our people here had to determine if the tapes were of broadcast quality," said 
Carl Meyer, vice president, West Coast and special program sales for NBC-TV, 
who had become the third player with Riesenberg and Beckett in the plan to 
rescue "Peter Pan." 
</P>
<P>
"That was an important consideration before anybody started running down the 
track. We decided they were and that we could be very confident about putting 
the show on the air." 
</P>
<P>
Riesenberg, meanwhile, was in a legal morass because the rights and contracts 
seemed to be spread everywhere: composers, lyricists, director, talent, film 
studios, past advertisers, the children's hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"In some cases, it was as much a problem of sorting out who didn't have the 
rights as who did," Riesenberg said. "I soon saw that this was going to be a 
long and maybe expensive proposition, but Campbell said stick with it." 
(Campbell Soup has a one-quarter sponsorship of the telecast, with the balance 
picked up by others companies.) 
</P>
<P>
Some rights-holders had died, which meant estates and heirs had to be tracked 
down, further slowing the process and getting even more lawyers involved. 
Generally, Riesenberg said, everyone was cooperative and wanted "Peter Pan" to 
be shown again . . . "as long as it was handled correctly. Everyone was very 
protective of the show because it was very special to them." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
While the legal entanglements were being unraveled, Ed Ancona, then director of 
film and tape post production at NBC Burbank, was put to work on bringing the 
old tapes up to today's broadcasting standards. 
</P>
<P>
"I had two copies of the show which appeared to be dupes from the original 
master tape," Ancona related. However, they were on 2-inch tape, the dimension 
for TV in that era (now it's 1-inch and moving to 1/2-inch) and that posed 
another problem -- NBC no longer has a machine to play 2-inch tape. 
</P>
<P>
So Ancona, who has since retired, looked around "for someone who knew how to 
tickle and tune and massage an old 2-inch tape machine to get the best out of 
the 'Peter Pan' tapes." 
</P>
<P>
Working with Image Transform and Compact Video, the 2-inch tapes were 
transferred to one-inch and the new copy was put through a highly sophisticated 
digital device to correct the color balance and reduce snowy-picture noise. 
</P>
<P>
In viewing the old tapes, Ancona had noticed a dark bar on the left side of the 
picture caused by an old camera used for the telecast. "We were able to blow up 
the picture slightly to get rid of that. The old tapes also had a blue shadow, 
but we made it a much more neutral, shaper image. One way or another, it 
amounted to quite a housecleaning." 
</P>
<P>
As for Mary Martin, the original cockeyed optimist, she has always believed 
"Peter Pan" would come back. "I have wanted it, always," she said recently at 
her home in Rancho Mirage. "I like to think the world still has a Neverland 
somewhere that makes people want to be loved and have joy." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years of her career, Martin had often thought of playing "Peter Pan" 
but pretty much gave up on the idea after her friend, Jean Arthur, starred as 
"Peter" on Broadway in 1950. "I figured Jean's done it, and that's that," said 
Martin, who was in "South Pacific" at the time. 
</P>
<P>
But Edwin Lester, director of the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera, also had long 
dreamed of producing "Peter Pan" -- with Martin -- and in 1954 signed her to 
star in a new musical version that would be directed and choreographed by 
Jerome Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her we'd play 10 weeks in California (split between Los Angeles and San 
Francisco) and then it would be her option to take it to New York afterward," 
recalled Lester, who is now 94 and still maintains an office at the Music 
Center. (On his office wall is a painting of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion by 
Martin, rimmed with tiny figures of the roles she played for Lester over the 
years, including "Peter Pan," "South Pacific" and "Annie Get Your Gun.") 
</P>
<P>
"Peter Pan" did go on to Broadway in October, 1954, after its run at the 
Philharmonic Auditorium here. Not long after its New York opening, Lester 
recalled, NBC contacted Martin's husband, producer Richard Halliday, proposing 
that it be shown on television -- the first time a stage hit was moved intact 
from Broadway to TV. 
</P>
<P>
A record-breaking 65 million viewers watched that live black-and-white telecast 
on March 7, 1955, and it was so acclaimed that Martin played Peter again for 
NBC the following January. 
</P>
<P>
In 1960, while she was starring in "The Sound of Music" on Broadway, she was 
asked to perform "Peter Pan" on television for the third time. In an interview 
printed in The Times that year, she talked about the backbreaking schedule of 
doing those two shows simultaneously: "It's hard work, but it is sheer joy. 
Since we last did 'Peter Pan' on television in 1956, the mail has never stopped 
coming in asking that we do it again. Now that it is being put on tape, it will 
be a permanent treasure and I hope it will be shown every year." 
</P>
<P>
Now, it is 1989, and 29 years have passed since she did the telecast that she 
hoped would be on each year. On a recent Saturday afternoon, dressed head to 
toe in "Peter Pan" green and sitting in the comfortable living room of her 
home, Martin, now 75 and looking every bit as youthful as "Peter Pan," said the 
mail is still coming in after all these years. People she meets everywhere 
still remember how she taught them to crow and made them want to fly. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone who ever read the Barrie play is a fan," she said. "Barrie had this 
dream of perpetual childhood. He didn't want anyone to grow up, and that 
intrigues certain kinds of people . . . I happen to be one of them. I'm still 
not real grown up," she said with a bit of a Texas drawl and smiling brightly. 
</P>
<P>
So now that Riesenberg (himself once one of the Lost Boys in a junior high 
school production of "Peter Pan" -- "Wendy was my first date") along with 
Beckett and Meyer have rescued "Peter Pan," will it become a perennial? What 
kind of rating must it attract for NBC to order more airings? 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't put a projected rating on this," Meyer said. "We have to wait and 
see the overall reaction . . . from the public, from the television press. 
We're all so prejudiced about the production. . . . The mechanics are in place 
for subsequent airings. We would just follow through if reaction warrants it." 
</P>
<P>
Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBC Entertainment, echoed that answer: "It's 
not a pure numbers thing. We want to get a sense of how appreciated it is by 
the audience from people who write and call." 
</P>
<P>
Tartikoff added some thoughts on why no one tried to get "Peter Pan" back on 
the air before this. "A 1970s version with Mia Farrow did not perform very well 
and there was no impetus to show 'Peter Pan' again at that time," he said. "But 
now we're at the end of the '80s and we realize what a nugget we have" in the 
Mary Martin production. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember the show as a child. And for me, it's a real joy to use this job to 
bring back to TV what I remember as a magical experience." 
</P>
<P>
In Meyer's view, the long months involved in getting the show on the air 
represent "a labor of love for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
Added Riesenberg: "This has been an obsession. It's the parents -- all of us 
that remember it -- who want our kids to see it so badly." 
</P>
<P>
Said Beckett: "For years, my kids thought all I did at NBC was work on 'Peter 
Pan.' I'm finally vindicated."

A LOOK AT MAN RAY IN L.A.; 
</P>
<P>
FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES PAINT A PERSONAL REMEMBRANCE OF THE ARTIST 
</P>

"Perpetual Motif," the retrospective of seminal surrealist Man Ray, opens today 
at the Museum of Contemporary Art. Encompassing every aspect of his long and 
varied career, a portion of the exhibition is given over to work done during 
the years of 1940 to 1951, when he lived in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Philadelphia the son of a Jewish tailor, Man Ray was forced to flee his 
adopted home of Paris -- a city which revered him -- during World War II. Like 
many European artists, he was attracted to Southern California's film industry. 
However, the 11 years he spent in Los Angeles -- whose art audience was 
minuscule and unsophisticated at the time -- were disappointing for him. His 
work as a painter went largely ignored, and though he socialized with the film 
industry, he never succeeded in getting any of his film projects off the 
ground. As Merry Foresta, curator of the MOCA show, points out, "the L.A. art 
audience felt more comfortable with Man Ray as a historical figure than with 
his interruptive presence." 
</P>
<P>
Herewith, reminiscences from some of Man Ray's friends and acquaintances during 
his years in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
JAMES B. BYRNES was curator at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art from 1946 
to 1950 and subsequently held directorial positions at several American 
museums. Retired from the museum field, he presently works as an art consultant 
and an appraiser of fine art. 
</P>
<P>
During the '40s I gave a course at USC on 20th-Century art, and when it came 
time for the session on Dadaism I asked Man to do it. I knew he could use the 
money, so I told him "you take the $15 for the night." He did a marvelous job 
and brought in many of the objects of his affection, and also held a kind of 
raffle. He gave out little slips of paper, and at the end of his lecture he 
asked, "Who has No. 8?" Somebody raised their hand, and he said, "Now, who 
doesn't have No. 8?" Somebody else raised their hand and he said, "You win." He 
then brought out a large inner tube, which he deflated and cut into pieces, 
then handed the pieces out to the students -- none of whom were familiar with 
his work, by the way. 
</P>
<P>
His distinguishing garb was quite noteworthy. He always wore a black shoestring 
for a tie, and on occasion would affect a paper mustache. He loved costume 
parties and fantasy, and had quite a bit of theater in him. 
</P>
<P>
He was rather flirtatious and women seemed to find him attractive, despite the 
fact that he was a small man and somewhat furtive in his demeanor. His charm 
had a lot to do with the fact that he was rather mysterious in many respects. 
</P>
<P>
He had a very droll, biting sense of humor that could be a bit antagonistic on 
occasion. One must remember that he was an enthusiast of the Marquis de Sade, 
so there was a certain harshness about him. 
</P>
<P>
He belonged to a group of people in L.A. who came to know each other primarily 
because they'd all come here from somewhere else. At that time the local 
population was described as "the Okies and the Arkies," and L.A. was referred 
to as "the buckle of the Bible Belt." There was no interest in modern art here 
at all, so these sophisticated outsiders stuck together. The way of life Man 
had known in Paris -- the cafes and so forth -- was absolutely unknown here, 
and I think he missed it a great deal. He lived across the street from what was 
then the Hollywood Ranch Market, which was open 24 hours a day, and Man thought 
that was extraordinary for L.A. I remember him exclaiming, "I can buy a bottle 
of good wine in the middle of the night for 99 cents that's the equal of 
anything I can buy in Paris!" 
</P>
<P>
He had a great ego -- he said so himself. 
</P>
<P>
The L.A. art community was very small during the years Man lived here and the 
only thing we had for local artists was an annual competition. I talked with 
Man about entering, but he refused -- he was vehemently opposed to competition 
of any sort. He wasn't interested in critics, believed everybody was an artist, 
and thought there should be no jurors or process of selection. He was basically 
an anarchist. 
</P>
<P>
He was generally kind of a grumpy guy. He believed in himself and it upset him 
that his work didn't provide him with a comfortable way of life, but he never 
considered compromising his work in any way for money. I remember one time when 
he was at a very low point financially and a woman tried to commission him to 
do a portrait of her. He rather disliked the person who'd asked and he 
announced that he wanted $250 for the project. She said, "Anybody else would 
charge $50! I can't believe that price!" He replied, "Believe it." 
</P>
<P>
KEVIN WHITE is Man Ray's nephew. He is a writer. 
</P>
<P>
I was just a kid -- maybe 10 or 12 -- when I used to see him, and I remember 
him as a very funny man. I'd bring pieces of paper to him and he'd draw funny 
faces for me. I don't think he was crazy about kids -- he never wanted any of 
his own as far as I know -- but he never gave me the impression I was being 
shunned or patronized. 
</P>
<P>
He seemed to enjoy life quite a bit. He liked good food and drink, good 
conversation and a challenging chess game. He didn't fit the prototype of the 
tortured artist as far as I could see. 
</P>
<P>
JOHN WHITNEY SR. is a pioneering avant-garde film maker who presently works 
with computer graphics and music. 
</P>
<P>
In the '40s, I was in my early 20s and was making abstract animated films. I 
read in the paper that Man Ray was living in L.A. and, being aware of the film 
making he'd done, I wanted to show him my work. He was fairly accessible to 
artists such as myself who wanted to meet and talk with him, so I called him 
up. He was quite cordial and invited me to come by. I showed him my films and 
he was very generous in his response. He pointed out -- and this is an obvious 
comment coming from him -- that there must be an element of surprise in any 
artwork. He said the word surprise in French. 
</P>
<P>
The first day I met him I was knocked out by some of the novelties in his 
apartment. There was a lamp made out of a Ford steering wheel, and though I 
could be mistaken about this, it seems he had a sofa shaped like the lips in 
his famous painting, "The Lovers." 
</P>
<P>
He had very delicate hands and unusually graceful body language. He was a very 
relaxed man, very easygoing. 
</P>
<P>
Man had two lives and I was totally barred from one of them. He moved in very 
wealthy circles and in fact, his films might not have been made were it not for 
the generosity of an extremely wealthy French count who gave him a camera and 
several thousands of dollars worth of film. Today, people might consider it a 
conflict of interest that Man, who espoused a philosophy of anarchy, was so 
chummy with the aristocratic element of society, but in those days no one 
worried about such things. The wealthy class -- and this was particularly true 
in Europe -- was enthralled with anarchists and the grubbiest members of the 
avant-garde. 
</P>
<P>
WILLIAM COPLEY's Copley Galleries presented Man Ray's only one-man show during 
his years in Los Angeles (the show was presented in 1948). Copley currently 
works as a painter. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood didn't treat Man like a celebrity and I think he resented that. He 
expected more recognition than was forthcoming, but at that time most people 
dismissed Surrealism as something very nutty. That bothered him, but only to a 
point; he was too intelligent to be ambitious as far as his standing in the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
He was not a voracious reader. I don't think he read any more than he had to. 
</P>
<P>
PHIL STERN lived next door to Man and Juliet Ray on Vine Street in the St. 
George Apartments (now called the Villa Elaine.) He is presently working on a 
book of his photographs of Hollywood from the '40s, '50s and '60s, to be 
published next year by Alfred Knopf. 
</P>
<P>
The apartments were really quite nice -- two floors, huge windows and maid 
service for $65 a month. The maid service came once a week and Man's biggest 
challenge in life was to prevent the maids from cleaning the windows. Man did 
his work in the apartment and he never cleaned the windows because the patina 
of dust on them created a diffuse light that was perfect for what he wanted to 
do photographically. I can remember him coming home one day and going 
absolutely berserk when he discovered that a new maid had washed the windows. 
He spent the next six months trying to cultivate the dirt on the 
window1931506799them with dirty water, went to an empty lot and got some dirt 
and tossed it at the windows -- he was a bit obsessed with those windows. 
</P>
<P>
He used to give talks and went on these strange lecture tours. His delight in 
life was to talk to Pasadena ladies and say things that shocked the hell out of 
them. In appearance and demeanor he was very much a Mr. Milquetoast, and I 
think he had a little Walter Mitty thing going. 
</P>
<P>
You know those animals called the sloth? Well, I never saw Man move faster than 
a quarter of a mile an hour. He was a slow, methodical man and was constantly 
puttering. He kept a very irregular schedule and sometimes he'd stay up all 
night working on his little projects. I rarely knew what he was working on -- 
he tended to be secretive about his work. 
</P>
<P>
During the '40s there was a group of bohemians living in a commune in Big Sur 
and the patriarchal head of the group was Henry Miller, who was a friend of 
Man's. Henry convinced Man to visit the commune but Man didn't enjoy the place 
at all. I can remember him talking about how crudely these people were living 
and exclaiming, "They didn't have any amenities!" Man was a bit effete and he 
liked comfort and cosmopolitan living. 
</P>
<P>
EMERSON WOELFFER is a Los Angeles painter. 
</P>
<P>
The first time I met Man was in Chicago. He was on his way to L.A. and I was 
studying with Moholy-Nagy at the Chicago Institute of Design. Man visited 
Moholy at the school one night when we were having a dance, and I can remember 
him complaining about how much he disliked Chicago. In those days people took 
the train to get from New York to L.A., and the trip included a one night 
stop-over in Chicago. Man grumbled that that was the only reason he was in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
He was a modest, sweet man and wasn't at all ambitious. People would tell him 
he was a success and he'd reply, "What do you mean by success? Money? I don't 
call that success." He was avidly against those kinds of attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
JULES ENGEL was a pioneering experimental film maker. He currently teaches film 
at California Institute of the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
Man took an interest in my films and was very generous with help and 
encouragement. I remember I once had a screening of my films where the audience 
didn't like what they'd seen and booed quite loudly. Man began screaming "Don't 
listen to those bastards; they don't know what they're seeing!" He took on the 
whole damn movie house! 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't much of a drinker. A little wine, but nothing excessive. 
</P>
<P>
He was never pushy about his career and wasn't the sort to arrange and 
manipulate things the way artists often do. Man had the stuff in his gut and 
you either bought it or you didn't.

THE EXHIBITION: PARIS IN THE '20S MEETS L.A. IN '40S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are few decades that hover more glamorously on the modern imagination 
than the myth of Paris in the '20s. Hemingway and the Lost Generation, Picasso 
and Gertrude Stein, James Joyce and Sylvia Beach, French zazou flappers with 
beaded dresses and little-boy haircuts. It's all so glimmeringly seductive and 
maddeningly unattainable. Not only were we not there, we were not here. Most of 
us weren't born yet. 
</P>
<P>
Paris in the '20s was that wonderful thing that happened just before we got to 
the party. The epoch has no rival, but a subtler second was certainly Los 
Angeles in the '40s when it was still cloaked in the aura of Raymond Chandler's 
tender toughness and the perfume of night-blooming jasmine on fake Spanish 
patios. It lingered even after the war started and Rosie the Riveter did the 
boogie-woogie with G.I. Joe. Ah, a moonlit night on the lagoon in Westlake Park 
in a boat named Donald Duck. Rattle home on the Red Car. 
</P>
<P>
An exhibition has just opened at the Museum of Contemporary Art presenting the 
art of a man who laced those two improbable times together and played no small 
role in creating their glamour. It is a retrospective of the work of Man Ray. 
He wasn't very happy exiled in Los Angeles, but he made a happy marriage to 
Juliet Browner. His presence added to our myth and reminds us there was art 
hereabouts before the boom of the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
Man Ray. Sounds like a Buck Rogers half-alien, and in a way, as an expatriate, 
he was one. His name is unforgettable but after that it's difficult to know 
what to call him. Photographer? Painter? Film maker? Dadaist bricoleur? 
</P>
<P>
He fished earnestly in all those ponds and made unforgettable catches. Once 
seen, it is impossible to forget his photograph of a girl's beautiful eyes 
crying glass beads. Was she Midas' daughter whose tears turned to jewels or a 
tart weeping fakes for effect? 
</P>
<P>
We would probably remember his flat-iron bottomed with its ripping row of nails 
without reading the label, but calling it "Cadeau" clinches it, adding insight 
to injury. He had a knack for witty titles. Once he took a photo of a girl's 
eye, attached it to a metronome and called it "Object to Be Destroyed." 
Somebody obliged by pulverizing it, but by that time it was so famous he 
shrugged, put it back together and called it "Indestructible Object." 
</P>
<P>
Everybody remembers his best painting. It's one of the most erotic images ever 
concocted. It shows a pair of Gargantuan ruby lips floating in a cloudy night 
sky above the silhouette of an observatory. It was painted in Paris but it 
looks like Griffith Park to us, especially since it seems like an ancestor of 
Ed Ruscha's Pop Surrealism. But it's not in the show. Man Ray's best painting 
is not in his retrospective. When you try to put the guy together he darts away 
in a flash like a coy koi. 
</P>
<P>
He was born in Philadelphia in 1890 and died in 1976. In the beginning his name 
wasn't Man Ray, it was Emmanuel something, probably Radensky. The catalogue 
offers an equivocal account of the family name and how it was changed. There 
may have been a time when such name-changing shenanigans were provocative, but 
by now we've had so many artistic pseudonyms that they are either quaint or 
irritating. Can you really trust a guy who won't tell you his name? 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Man Ray was a pioneer, sort of. He led in the art of forging one's own 
mythic public image, a precursor of Andy Warhol but more aristocratic in the 
fashion of the day. He was a rare American to be celebrated by the School of 
Paris avant-garde. Art-photo people said he invented the Rayograph while other 
people grumble that the technique of making images on photo paper by exposing 
it directly to light was really old stuff. Besides, the results look a lot like 
mechanical Cubism. 
</P>
<P>
By 1913, he was confirmed in his artistic ambitions, just married to his first 
wife, Adon Lacroix, and living in New Jersey. This impediment did not prevent 
him from becoming fascinated with Rimbaud's poetry, the writings of the weird 
proto-surrealist Lautremont and the legendary Armory Exhibition, which 
introduced radical European art to America. Soon Man Ray was paying court to 
Marcel Duchamp. They both played chess. Man Ray painted his second-best 
picture, "The Rope Dancer Accompanies Herself With Her Shadows." It's a rather 
embarrassing knock-off of Duchamp's "Large Glass," but at least it is in the 
exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
By 1921 -- discouraged at New York's indifference to Dada -- Man Ray moved to 
Paris, where he was embraced by the avant-garde. He still wanted to be a 
painter, but he was less a bohemian than a dandy who regarded a pretty 
mistress, a good studio and a flashy car as life's basic necessities. In a 
self-portrait he showed himself short and dapper with the face of an elfin 
weasel. 
</P>
<P>
He decided to become a fashionable portrait photographer to make money and 
advance his own artistic fortunes through contact with the rich and famous. He 
was so successful that it was soon regarded as a status symbol to pose for Man 
Ray. The pictures are wonderful in themselves, chic, detached and witty and a 
wonderful sociological record of the era. He photographed everyone from the 
dead Marcel Proust to a solemnly tipsy Sinclair Lewis and every artist, poet 
and slick young thing in town. And everybody was in town. 
</P>
<P>
The required mistress was found in a teen-age model named Alice Prin, called 
Kiki. He photographed her ivory face, bee-stung lips and powdery body 
ceaselessly until he traded her in on a new model, Lee Miller, an aspiring 
American photographer with a figure like a Greek statue. Clearly a certain 
amount of inbreeding was going on because some of Man Ray's mistresses and 
models -- including Dora Maar -- also turn up in accounts of Picasso's 
mistresses and models. 
</P>
<P>
Man Ray held the mirror up to a glamorous and richly creative era. That is 
enough in itself to make the exhibition a popular attraction until it closes 
here May 28. But when we have had enough of being flattered, kidded and 
entertained by Man Ray's sardonic impishness, how does this body of work hold 
up to art's harder questions? 
</P>
<P>
I previewed the show at its point of origin -- the National Museum of American 
Art in Washington. It comes on like a rare and definitive event, and it is, but 
there have been others. In 1966, Jules Langsner presented a survey at the Los 
Angeles County Museum of Art. It may be significant to note that both shows 
came at times when stylishness threatened to gobble up art. 
</P>
<P>
The MOCA installation makes the art appear more substantial. Paintings look 
less raw, but the ensemble appears darker and more paranoid. The exhibition 
meanders around like a gigolo at a cocktail party. Man Ray displayed all the 
symptoms of butterfly dilettantism -- flitting prettily from flower to flower 
-- looking brilliantly clever as he paused briefly on each one but never 
resting anywhere for long. The show looks mainly like the work of four or five 
gifted amateurs who dabbled for a time and moved on to collecting exotic 
automobiles. His movies are full of witty bits, but their heartlessness 
eventually causes your rear end to inform you you are sitting through another 
self-indulgent art movie. Scrutinized for common threads, the work reveals a 
commonplace artistic sensibility -- it is coldly mechanical at bottom, a kind 
of updated Neo-Classicism. (He drew with a prissy thin line.) The closest it 
comes to feeling is its delight in polite erotic fetishism. Man Ray admired the 
Marquis de Sade and painted his third-best painting in his honor. He is also 
said to have bragged about occasionally batting around a recalcitrant mistress. 
Some later photographs are subtly sadomasochistic. 
</P>
<P>
Art has to be free to express kinky desires, so that's not the point. Artists' 
personal habits are even less relevant to our judgment of their artistic 
qualifications than are those of candidates for presidential secretaries, so 
that's not the point either. 
</P>
<P>
The point has to do with the fact that egomania and narcissism are natural 
occupational diseases of all artists. The only way to stave them off is by 
being more interested in art than in oneself, one's career, one's image. 
</P>
<P>
An artist who is more interested in art than himself may seem as self-involved 
as one who is not. The difference shows in the work. A truly self-involved 
artist's oeuvre is usually less than the sum of its parts. Man Ray's work shows 
that what he created was not an artist but an artistic personality -- a kind of 
visual Oscar Levant.

EDWARD JAMES OLMOS BLENDS PACIFIC CULTURES TO CREATE A HYBRID AMERICAN

<P>
What the hell are we? De-Mexicanized Mexicans, pre-Chicanos, cholo-punks, 
Mexi-Americans, or something that still has no name? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Guillermo Gomez-Pena, from The Broken Line/Linea Quebrada. 
</P>
<P>
Years before Edward James Olmos earned his Oscar nomination for Best Actor for 
his performance in "Stand and Deliver," the ruddy-faced actor with a piercing 
gaze was known to millions of TV viewers as "Miami Vice's" Lt. Martin Castillo. 
</P>
<P>
For just as long, Olmos' ability to steal a scene with wounded silences had 
made Castillo something of a mystery. Whenever it came to time read about the 
42-year-old actor, however, it was generally the same story: Olmos as underdog, 
as son of immigrants and of the barrio preaching his bootstrap message of hard 
work and self-responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
But this reading of Olmos as ethnic artist moving into the movie mainstream 
through sheer will is too conventional, say close friends and associates. 
There's another side to the artist, they say, a studied "otherness" that 
implies new notions of American identity. 
</P>
<P>
Olmos agrees. He sees himself as a kind of prototypal Pacific Rim man who fuses 
Latino, Asian and rock 'n' roll strains into a new hybrid of American culture. 
Said another way, Olmos has tried to expand the meaning of his mestizo (mixed 
race, mixed culture) Mexican roots by seeking unexpected points of resonance in 
the new and old worlds. 
</P>
<P>
"We (Mexicans) are Asian," Olmos abruptly pronounced during one of a series of 
recent interviews. "We come from the first people who came over (the Bering 
Strait) to this continent." He said his family, natives of Mexico City, "go 
back five generations to Spain on my father's side. My father's mother was 
Aztec. So I'm mestizo all the way." 
</P>
<P>
He does not, however, restrict the meaning of his mestizo roots to a Latino 
world: 
</P>
<P>
"I never stop knowing that I'm Latino," he began. "I'm very much a part of the 
Latin experience. But I don't limit to one form or theory of being. I've been 
exposed to Russian culture, Asian culture, to Indian and Mexican cultures. I 
draw from all of them. I understand . . . that the future involves a tremendous 
awareness of the world." 
</P>
<P>
It's this mestizaje -- blending of culture and races -- that Olmos draws upon 
to postulate a distant family connection with his present character in "Triumph 
of the Spirit," a film now shooting in Poland. Olmos plays a Hungarian Gypsy 
capo and part-time magician inside Poland's Auschwitz concentration camp who 
helps a Greek boxer played by Willem Dafoe survive to-the-death matches inside 
the ring. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd been searching to see how many Gypsies there were in my own family just 
before I started this film," he said. "Really, because the name Olmos, which 
means elm tree in Spanish, is a prominent name in Hungary. It means lead, or 
people who work with lead." 
</P>
<P>
Screenwriter, director, playwright Luis Valdez -- author of the 1978 play "Zoot 
Suit" and the director of the cross-over hit film "La Bamba" -- said Olmos 
represents a new breed of artist expanding the envelope of Latino cultural 
possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
"In Eddie's case, I guess his uniqueness comes from the fact that he grew up in 
East L.A.," said Valdez. "There's a lot of Asian-Chicano fusion, even though 
it's not acknowledged. But it should be. I think fusion is it, man. You can 
fuse Asian and Chicano or Latino qualities and come up with some very 
interesting abilities." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Flashes of Olmos' chameleon "abilities" have surfaced throughout his career. 
</P>
<P>
By retaining creative control of his Castillo, Olmos said he has tried to 
offset "Miami Vice's" high fashion, hyper-reality by creating a character of 
stark moral dualities: The chivalrous samurai locked inside a disillusioned 
big-city vice cop who stubbornly clings to his own personal code of honor and 
ethics. 
</P>
<P>
More than a decade earlier, Olmos became the conscience of "Zoot Suit" and a 
Chicano cult hero, binding the thinly veiled hostility of the pachuco ("street 
tough") with defiant stoicism of an Aztec warrior and rock 'n' roll rebellion; 
performances that won Olmos an L.A. Drama Critics Award, a Tony nomination and 
vaulted him to the big screen. 
</P>
<P>
Olmos has also played a Mohawk high-rise rivet-pounder with shamanic powers in 
"Wolfen," a wrongly accused Mexican rancher turned outlaw in "The Ballad of 
Gregorio Cortez," even an Italian fisherman in an NBC-TV movie, "Fortunate 
Pilgrim." 
</P>
<P>
But it was his performance in "Stand and Deliver" and the subsequent Oscar 
nomination that has increased his acting options, acknowledged producer Arnold 
Kopelson, who has cast Olmos in "Triumph of the Spirit," now shooting in 
Poland. He plays a hardened, but compassionate, death camp trustee. 
</P>
<P>
"Eddie not only looks right, he has the acting skills we need," Kopelson said. 
"It's a very pivotal role, and he's just a very exciting actor." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Becoming a fusion artist, Olmos contends, had everything to do with growing up 
in Boyle Heights. In the late '40s and '50s, his Russian, Jewish, Japanese, 
Italian, Chinese, and Mexican neighbors on Cheesebrough Lane near First and 
Indiana were precursors of the ethnic diversity now commonplace throughout Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I was raised with a lot of Hispanics and a lot of Asians, mainly Japanese," 
Olmos said. "After the war, they seemed to mill around that area. My best 
friends, growing up through grammar school, were Asians. So I learned a lot 
about their cultures just by hanging around them. It wasn't any deep-rooted 
direction on my part. It was the environment." 
</P>
<P>
If his neighbors brought him the world, the streets provided the first stage 
for practicing his role in "Zoot Suit." Because the pachuco's machismo is 
expressed in an opulence of physical gesture, a reclining posture that defies 
gravity and authority, mime and meticulous observation, Olmos said, became more 
than mere barrio survival skills. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of that came from the street," he said. "There's so much time spent 
checking people out. So much of the street is body language and attitude." Role 
playing on the streets and finding himself in a multiethnic universe, he said, 
thus became his central life themes. 
</P>
<P>
After a long childhood obsession with baseball -- literally spending seven days 
a week on the diamond -- Olmos, drawing on afternoon dance session he'd spent 
with his father and sister, suddenly adopted music and modern dance as his new 
disciplines in high school. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the rock clubs began to multiply on the Sunset Strip in the early 
'60s, Olmos had formed Eddie and the Pacific Ocean, a raucous rock group that 
eventually became a fixture at Gazzarri's. It was his sheer physical ability as 
a spinning and diving rock 'n' roll stage performer, not his voice, that 
allowed Olmos to make "Zoot Suit's" El Pachuco his uncontested possession, said 
Michael Wadleigh, who later directed Olmos in "Wolfen." 
</P>
<P>
"When I went to see 'Zoot Suit,' the thing that knocked me out, was his 
physicality," Wadleigh said. "They way he would hit those poses and then just 
tip the brim of his hat so the light would catch his face. It was like Kabuki, 
but it was also rock 'n' roll." 
</P>
<P>
Wadleigh wasn't the only one to see a classical figure hiding in Olmos' El 
Pachuco. 
</P>
<P>
"There were people from the Royal Shakespeare Company who (saw the stage 
version of "Zoot Suit") who said my character was one of the few to come out of 
American theater that was big enough to walk onto the Shakespearean stage," 
Olmos said. "The Japanese Kabuki families proclaimed the same thing. They were 
seeing disciplined, classical movement." 
</P>
<P>
These observations opened a door for Olmos that he didn't hesitate to jump 
through. 
</P>
<P>
"I fell in love with Kabuki theater and Kathakali theater from India, which are 
two very poignant, very stylized types of theater," he said. "What I took from 
them was not so much the philosophy but their theories of movement, the control 
and discipline. This fascinated me and I studied it." 
</P>
<P>
During a brief hiatus between "Zoot Suit's" last curtain call in Los Angeles 
and its short-lived Broadway run in 1979, he also spent a month in Japan on two 
uneventful movie projects learning "tons of dialogue in Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
It was during his transition period, said Wadleigh, who for a time shared his 
home with Olmos and wife, Kaija Keel, that Olmos explored the linkages between 
the Mesoamerican and Inca style of rendering human figure and stylized Asian 
dance and theater. 
</P>
<P>
And he had begun to wear his face, say some of his Latino admirers, like a 
Mesoamerican death mask, the equivalent of the vato's (tough guy's) shield of 
stoicism and a bridge between stereotypes and continents -- the reticent Indian 
and the inscrutable Asian. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Olmos maintains that his attraction to Asian theater and culture was a 
matter of personal curiosity and artistic instinct. 
</P>
<P>
"What you do a lot of times is that you go ahead and you work in a specific 
way," he said. "You read, you do research, absorb. Then you allow all of that 
to be absorbed by your subconscious. Then you just go ahead and be." 
</P>
<P>
He anticipates a Pacific Rim future in his supporting role in the 1982 film 
noir detective thriller, "Blade Runner." 
</P>
<P>
Olmos played Gaff, a Los Angeles detective who coerces Harrison Ford to 
liquidate a crew of killer humanoid robots. Set in the year 2019, "Blade 
Runner" is meant as a worst-case metaphor of Los Angeles as a locus of cultural 
fusion and environmental chaos. 
</P>
<P>
Olmos claims, however, that his role in the 1982 film directed by Ridley Scott 
was too vaguely drawn. "At first, they didn't know what his character was," 
Olmos said. "Then they wanted to make him ethnic. I said, 'I'll play him, but 
you've got to understand where I'm coming from. My character was a total Gaff.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
His character, he decided, would have the world for his family tree, with each 
ancestor represented by a different race. He then proceeded to invent an 
equally convoluted pidgin of Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, English and German for 
his character. 
</P>
<P>
"I went out to Berlitz language school and learned pieces of languages," he 
said. "I wrote down my own dialogue, but instead of saying, 'I am going to the 
police station' in English, I would say each word in a different language. It 
was bits of languages. I called it Cityspeak. They couldn't deal with it. What 
I had done was beyond their wildest dreams." 
</P>
<P>
Gaff's brooding silences reminded film director Masato Harada of a younger 
Toshiro Mifune, the hero of the classic '50s samurai movie trilogy produced by 
Toho Studios. 
</P>
<P>
"If I direct another samurai movie, I'd like to cast him as the leading 
character because Olmos has that kind of ability," Harada said via telephone 
form Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
His role in "Blade Runner" also illustrates why Olmos is so different from 
other Latino actors of his generation. Instead of trying to cross over, Olmos 
said he has battled to define in his screen image on his own terms. He paid a 
price for his obstinacy, turning down, his friends say, as much as $2 million 
in acting parts at one point, because he would not accept roles that portrayed 
Latinos or anyone else with lopsided stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
As a consequence, Olmos said, he still found himself refusing roles that he 
believed weighed him down with ethnic stereotypes or denied him control of his 
character. 
</P>
<P>
The turning point came in August, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Four episodes into the first season of "Miami Vice," executive producer Michael 
Mann asked Olmos to fill a role left vacant by Gregory Sierra. Though the role 
intrigued him, he feared a weekly television series would not allow him the 
freedom to pursue his own projects. Olmos kept on saying no until Mann 
reportedly gave in to several demands, including creative control of Castillo's 
character. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Mann) allowed me that strength," said Olmos. Again, Olmos proceeded to 
invent a past for Lt. Martin Castillo, an ex-DEA agent who'd burned himself out 
fighting rogue CIA agents and guerrillas pushing heroin to U.S. troops during 
the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
Although he complains that the show's writing has deteriorated, he still 
identifies with Castillo: 
</P>
<P>
"I speak eight languages, four of them are Asian, and Spanish, English and 
Russian. It's an unusual blend. Basically, Castillo is probably the most 
disciplined character I've worked with in all my life. But that's what 
extraordinary about him. He's able to survive (on TV) doing close to absolutely 
nothing, except for thinking on camera." 
</P>
<P>
For Olmos, thinking on camera also meant exploring Castillo's Asian seam in 
nearly every episode where he was cast in the leading role. 
</P>
<P>
"Bushido," his directing debut, won "Miami Vice" its only Emmy in 1985 when 
Olmos adopted the stance of the sword-wielding samurai. In "Duty in Honor," a 
1987 episode in which Castillo plays against Haing S. Ngor, best supporting 
actor Oscar winner for "The Killing Fields." Ngor played an undercover North 
Vietnamese operative who goes to Miami to avenge the deaths of Vietnamese 
prostitutes and political leaders killed by a psychopathic ex-CIA operative 
during the war. 
</P>
<P>
Olmos believes the episode stands as a rare example in the post-Vietnam War 
genre that has allowed the former enemy to emerge from the background and 
reveal the individual dignity and humanity in his suffering. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, we see two enemies fighting for the same cause," Olmos 
said evenly. "Both he and I had our own (political) values as police officers, 
but we were both after the same person. It made us the same."

A TWO-MAN 'TRIO' FROM DOWN UNDER

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Trios Ringbarkus, as an escalating number of people who like to explore the 
theater netherworld are finding out, is neither a three-ring circus nor a 
mariachi band on a budget. They are two Australian comics of the "New 
Vaudeville" variety named Neill Gladwin and Stephen Kearney, who love nothing 
better than considering the possibilities of what a box of crackers or bread 
rolls can bring out in them and in a room of captive patrons. 
</P>
<P>
In another era, they would have been locked up for (at least) disturbing the 
peace, or, as goes the title of their show at Theatre/Theater, "Rampant 
Stupidity." 
</P>
<P>
But unlike their homeland's ecological heritage, an ark of the world's 
strangest animals unable to breed with their Asian neighbors, Gladwin and 
Kearney have picked up on a host of international influences: Punk's 
audience-assault style. Samuel Beckett's perpetual see-saw between the will to 
speak and death. Buster Keaton's physical daring. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the product of the disgusting practices of our progenitors, stuck in 
British-run penal colonies," deadpanned Kearney about the first white Aussies. 
</P>
<P>
So it wasn't surprising when Los Trios, who seem capable of anything, picked up 
a reporter and photographer at the Hollywood Pep Boys and sped away in an 
ancient but spirited white Cadillac to the Shangri-La of Griffith Observatory. 
"We want to eat lunch where Arnold ripped out that guy's heart in 'The 
Terminator,' " explained the tall, blond Gladwin, smiling to his back-seat 
guests. 
</P>
<P>
As Kearney -- shorter with spikey, cropped hair -- lost rubber through the 
switchbacks, they explained that Griffith Park is where they like to "deposit" 
their mates from Down Under without a map, "so they get a real taste for L.A." 
</P>
<P>
These two have their L.A. tastebuds well conditioned. Although "Rampant 
Stupidity" only opened in early January (after a three-performance preview in 
December to an utterly unsuspecting public, plus a few critics), Kearney and 
Gladwin have actually been peddling their wares in The Industry for nearly two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't quite want to admit that Hollywood had little notion of how to 
employ their talents for comic mayhem, but they were bemused at studio 
legalisms. 
</P>
<P>
"As we developed material for them," Gladwin recalled, "they started claiming 
ownership over our characters. It got to the point that if Stephen had his 
sleeve up, then it was ours, not theirs. If my collar was crumpled, it was 
theirs, not ours. Scary." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, even these radically inclined, black comedians of the night do auditions 
for TV pilots during the day ("Remember your lines, Steve?" "Got your American 
accent, Neill?"), though they've been turned down by the Carson show. It all 
helps their act, they insist. Gladwin: "Everything in life, everything, is a 
performance art piece." Then Kearney adds: "And not a very good one, at that." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, for Gladwin at least, Los Angeles strongly recalls their native 
Melbourne: "Nice climate, large suburban houses with big lawns, fantastic Greek 
food." 
</P>
<P>
Pals at Rusden State College, they found themselves one day turning a promotion 
for a colleague's upcoming performance into a performance itself, "something 
like 'Mona Lisa' with accordion and drums," said Kearney. 
</P>
<P>
The act built from routine to routine. In the atmosphere of rowdy, post-modern 
Melbourne vaudeville in the late '70s, their performance was much ruder and 
more tasteless, they insisted, than what they do now. That's when they were a 
trio, with dwarf performer Gareth Walpole. (The name comes from ringbarking a 
tree -- stripping the bark at the base -- making it die. "That's essentially 
what happens with our act," Gladwin once told an interviewer.) Club dates led 
to opening acts for groups such as INXS and Men at Work. 
</P>
<P>
"Gareth would be in a gorilla suit," said Gladwin, "Stephen would play wild 
drums. People would laugh just staring at us. 
</P>
<P>
"But now, can you believe that people are coming expecting A Serious Night in 
the Theater, and in five minutes, they know they're in trouble?" 
</P>
<P>
"What they often don't get," explained Kearney, "is our deep sense of outrage 
at just about everything, and the ways we twist that into something that works 
on stage. They want to be entertained in the old ways. It makes it doubly hard 
because when you turn pro, you sometimes forget what made something funny 
funny. Sometimes, this town only adds to making you forget it." 
</P>
<P>
But then, the strangest things will happen at Theatre/Theater, and Los Trios 
will once again be reminded why they are Los Trios. Such as the audience 
members who get so immersed in the spirit of "Rampant Stupidity" they're drawn 
into the act (take the bit where they untie and toss around an innocent man's 
shoe), become part of the show and even hold it hostage (by taking one of 
Kearney's shoes). 
</P>
<P>
"Wonderful," Kearney smirks, "they're as outraged as we are."

NEW ZEALAND DIRECTOR'S MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN DOWLING, Dowling is a New Zealand-based free-lance writer 
specializing in film and broadcasting. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
AUCKLAND, New Zealand 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vincent Ward's first film, shot at art school, called for a naked man to run 
across a semifrozen lake. 
</P>
<P>
No one in the conservative city of Christchurch would agree to his odd request, 
so Ward ended up stripping down and doing the job himself. 
</P>
<P>
It's a story Ward likes to tell, and it illustrates several qualities about 
this tenacious New Zealand director. 
</P>
<P>
It shows, he says, how we learned to make films -- "literally by jumping in and 
getting my feet wet; by falling down on my face and trying again." 
</P>
<P>
But it also gives an early hint at the extraordinary lengths to which Ward will 
go to get what he wants, and the considerable aura that has grown around his 
refusal to compromise that vision. 
</P>
<P>
At 32, he is now firmly cast as the "anti-podean Herzog." His films bear the 
unmistakable hallmark of a grand quest and, like the indomitable West German 
director, he attracts a loyal band of followers. 
</P>
<P>
In New Zealand, his work and his working methods are regarded as obsessive. It 
is a term Ward rejects, but one that has followed him to Australia, where he is 
now based. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a particularly complimentary phrase, is it?" he asks, "I might have 
fallen into that category once, but now I'd like to think my approach is a bit 
more low-key. I just don't see any point in doing something unless you put 
everything you have into it." 
</P>
<P>
In the 13 years since Ward's icy plunge into film-making, he has put his all 
into just two feature-length productions and two award-winning short films. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this slender output, he has developed an increasingly international 
profile, as each film's release reinforces the presence of a startingly fresh 
style and vision operating Down Under. 
</P>
<P>
His films have not generated much box office in America, but recognition has 
come from the international festival and art-house circuits. 
</P>
<P>
Ward's first film, the 50-minute psychological drama "A Stage of Siege," won 
awards at the 1978 Chicago Film Festival (a Golden Hugo) and the Miami Film 
Festival (Special Jury Prize). 
</P>
<P>
Then his 2 1/2-year odyssey into the remote Urewera ranges (living with an 
82-year-old Maori woman and her 40-year-old paranoid schizophrenic son), 
resulted in "In Spring One Plants Alone," a haunting documentary that was Grand 
Prix co-winner at the 1982 Cinema du Reel and a Silver Hugo winner at the 
Chicago Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Both his feature films, "Vigil" and "The Navigator," have been selected in 
competition at the Cannes Film Festival, a rare double achievement in the 
festival's 41-year history. 
</P>
<P>
But similar success seemed to elude him at home. As his producer John Maynard 
states: "In France, Ward is seen as an auteur director, but in Australia he was 
seen as self-indulgent, and in New Zealand he wasn't seen at all." 
</P>
<P>
However, Ward's latest film, "The Navigator," is crossing over some of those 
previously defined boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
The film scooped six Australian Film Awards last year, including best film, 
best director, best cinematography and best editing, and its box-office success 
in Australia and New Zealand has opened up a whole new audience for Ward's 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Released in New Zealand's five main centers last month, its per-screen average 
in the first week was $20,000 New Zealand (about $13,000 U.S.), placing it just 
behind Arnold Schwarzenegger's "Red Heat" as the country's top-grossing movie. 
Its dream run was then halted by the release here of "The Accidental Tourist." 
</P>
<P>
"The Navigator," subtitled "An Odyssey Through Time," concerns a pilgrimage by 
a group of 14th-Century English miners who believe they can save their village 
from the advancing Black Death by erecting a cross on top of the "highest 
church in Christendom," on the other side of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Led by a 9-year-old visionary boy called Griffin, they tunnel through the 
Earth, emerging into glittering 20th-Century New Zealand, and the "celestial 
city" of Auckland, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The bold leap in time is made without any of the convenient time-travel devices 
seen in films like "Back to the Future." Ward moves between stark black and 
white for Cumbria, 1348, and deep, foreboding color in the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
"I prefer to tell a story visually as much as possible," he says, "That is the 
art of film making and what makes it interesting. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want dialogue or easy answers, listen to a radio play or watch TV. Film 
is visual. I try constantly to whittle away unnecessary dialogue and overt 
explanation." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the juxtaposition of the 14th and 20th centuries has a meaning in the film 
that is all too clear. 
</P>
<P>
The Black Death has its modern-day counterpart in AIDS, and Ward compares the 
Cumbrian village (an isolated pocket untouched by the plague) to New Zealand 
with its "courageous or foolhardy" anti-nuclear stance. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of New Zealand is Celtic in origin," says Ward, "I liked the idea of what 
our distant ancestors would make of us if they came to visit one dark night. 
Normally we film stories about he past which are implicitly judging the past. I 
wanted the film to be from their perspective -- they are judging us, and we see 
our century through medieval eyes." 
</P>
<P>
Ward is a fourth-generation New Zealander, from a long line of farmers who 
worked the land by hand, shaping it through sheer hard work. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a hunter and a possum trapper," he says proudly. "And I trained in 
amateur wrestling and boxing (before concussion put an end to all contact 
sports)." 
</P>
<P>
At art school, he originally intended being a painter or sculptor. Yet when 
film critics talk about his art, Ward cringes, preferring, if pressed, to 
describe it as craft. 
</P>
<P>
"For me the important thing is working and making things. If I was a carpenter 
or a sculptor, I'd be just as happy. The act of creating is a very physical 
process . . . I identify very strongly with the miners in The Navigator."

HONG KONG SCHOOL BREAKS DOWN CULTURAL BARRIERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
HONG KONG 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The British Crown Colony of Hong Kong is racing toward its prearranged 
remarriage to the rest of China at the end of the 20th Century with a surge of 
frenzied building. Everywhere one looks, construction cranes tower over the 
bamboo scaffold-clad shells of buildings-in-progress. It is difficult to pick 
out a building on either side of the harbor that is more than 10 years old. 
</P>
<P>
One of them is the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts, a squat, but not 
unattractive compilation of gray concrete nestled in the foreground of the 
architects' smorgasbord of steel, glass and tile towers that is part of the 
island's waterfront panorama. 
</P>
<P>
The academy, like most of its neighbors, is young -- soon to celebrate its 
fourth birthday. Land for the sprawling three-building complex -- a filled-in 
area over the city's major sewer channel -- was given by the Hong Kong 
government, also the source of an annual maintenance allotment. The Royal Hong 
Kong Jockey Club, owners and operators of the colony's two race tracks, 
financed the $39-million construction. 
</P>
<P>
As in the rest of the colony, there is wide speculation at the academy over 
what will become of Hong Kong, home of one of the world's most intensely 
business-oriented cultures, when it becomes part of the Peoples' Republic of 
China in 1997, at the end of Britain's 99-year lease. The proven tendency for 
political winds in China to shift rapidly lends plausibility to almost any 
conjecture. 
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese are very big on education," Carl Wolz, dean of the academy's 
school of dance said in a recent discussion. "You can be sure they will pay 
serious attention to the APA and will probably bring in their own people to run 
it right from the start." 
</P>
<P>
Concern about the institution's future has little visible effect on its present 
burgeoning activities. 
</P>
<P>
Wolz's school is one of four distinct schools, of dance, drama, music and 
technical arts, which make up the APA. The divisions function in fully 
equipped, state-of-the-art facilities. There are specially designed, 
soundproofed classrooms, large, airy teaching and rehearsal studios, a 
professional television studio, a recording setup capable of producing 
high-quality tapes or records, and scenery and costume shops, and performing 
venues ranging from a 1,200-seat theater, and a 500-seat outdoor amphitheater, 
to a 100-seat recital hall. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea here is cooperation," Wolz points out. "The students each specialize 
in one of the disciplines, but we do our best to make sure they have a 
practical understanding of what goes on in the other disciplines.' 
</P>
<P>
Missouri-born Wolz is a former dancer, and an expert in a wide variety of Asian 
dance. He taught dance at such schools as Juilliard, the University of Hawaii, 
and UCLA before being selected to direct the academy's dance program. 
</P>
<P>
The interdisciplinary approach is more than a progressive theory, school 
administrators point out. The academy's purpose, they say, is to produce 
professional performers and teachers in a world where the artificial boundaries 
between the various areas of the performing arts are melting rapidly. Students 
are required to take courses in divisions other than their own. For instance, 
musicians study movement, and dancers study drama. All performers are expected 
to acquire some technical production skills. 
</P>
<P>
Artistic boundaries are not the only ones the academy seeks to dissolve. The 
three performing arts divisions try to prepare students to go beyond cultural 
barriers as well, with classes concentrating on both traditional Chinese and 
Western approaches to the art forms. 
</P>
<P>
The academy's dance program is divided into three major fields, with students 
being offered the choice of pursuing traditional Chinese dance, classical 
ballet, or modern dance. The Chinese dance line includes both folk styles and 
the acrobatics popularized by more recent touring troupes. 
</P>
<P>
There is also an effort to expose students to a wide spectrum of dance from 
other countries. Under Wolz's administration, the school of dance has hosted 
the International Festival of Dance Academies -- with participants from 
Australia, China, England, Japan, Taiwan, the U.S. and other countries -- every 
year since the academy opened in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The modern dance area covers the widest stylistic range. According to Jan Day, 
former head of the dance department at Cal State L.A., now at the academy as a 
guest senior lecturer in modern dance, the multiplicity of teaching styles and 
choreographic modes to which the students are exposed gives rise to artistic 
flexibility. "The mix here is incredible," she says. "These kids are 
theoretically able to tackle any style. They get Martha Graham and Jose Limon 
techniques, contact improvisation and much more. There are different guest 
teachers -- such as myself -- here every year." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the guest residency programs, there are short workshops and 
seminars offered to the students. A recent workshop in "physical theater," a 
merging of modern theater techniques with dance-based movement, brought 
together young participants from all three dance disciplines as well as from 
the School of Drama. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to encourage that kind of exploration," says Chung King Fai, dean of 
the school of drama at the academy and a Yale University graduate. "It is 
important that these students are familiar with more than just one system of 
theater." 
</P>
<P>
Productions by the academy's drama students -- usually performed in Cantonese 
-- range from Chinese plays such as "The Story of Ah-Q" and "Voyage of the 
Stone," through "Merchant of Venice," "Marat / Sade," and "Children of a Lesser 
God." 
</P>
<P>
The mixture of East and West which is Hong Kong is also reflected in the school 
of music. The school is divided into a Chinese music department, in which many 
regional traditions of instrumental and vocal music are taught and preserved, 
and a Western music division, where classical and modern European and American 
composers are studied. Last season the school presented a fully staged 
production of Mozart's "Magic Flute" sung in English. It is that kind of 
interdisciplinary project which the Academy's administrators hope to see more 
of in the future. 
</P>
<P>
That future may be unpredictable, both for Hong Kong and for its Academy for 
Performing Art, but that doesn't seem to faze the academy's students or 
faculty. They go on creating and planning; building for whatever that future 
may bring.

TERAOKA'S EXHIBITION TAKES ON AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A pale-skinned geisha soaking in a wooden bathtub rips open a condom package, 
her thin red lips curled into a grimace, her tiny teeth tearing at the blue 
plastic. 
</P>
<P>
Her elaborate coiffure is held tight by thick hairpins and one imagines a silk 
kimono hanging nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Like an Edo-period woodblock print made on Melrose Avenue, the style of Masami 
Teraoka's "AIDS Series/Geisha in Bath" may be traditional Japanese, but the 
content is unmistakably '80s. Background text, written in Japanese behind the 
bather, spells out her most modern monologue. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot open this at all," the geisha is to have said. " . . . I don't have 
scissors. . . . Oh, this smells really odd, it has to be the spermicide; it's 
also slimy." 
</P>
<P>
The 9-foot-high watercolor, featured in an exhibit opening today at the Long 
Beach Museum of Art, is quintessential Teraoka, a Japanese-born artist who has 
spent more than half his 53 years here. He recently moved from Los Angeles to 
Oahu. 
</P>
<P>
Well known for watercolors rendered in wood-block print style that are 
populated with Kabuki-like characters and satirize contemporary social issues, 
Teraoka first addressed AIDS in 1986. However, the 14 works in the AIDS Series 
at the Long Beach exhibit, "Masami Teraoka: Waves and Plagues," have never been 
seen in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The artist created the series to communicate that AIDS, still rare in Japan, 
"may be slipping through the whole network of protection" there, particularly 
through Westerners' contact with geishas, he said by phone recently. 
</P>
<P>
"My intent is to bring out the issue so that people can look at it," explained 
Teraoka, a critic of the Westernization of Japan who has portrayed Pacific 
invasions by McDonald's hamburgers and 31 Flavors ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
But, characteristically, the artist rejects a heavy-handed approach, using a 
"wonderful visual experience" as a "buffer" for serious subject matter. (His 
wittier depictions have included snorkeling geishas and Kabuki joggers.) 
</P>
<P>
"If people get too involved in a realistic format, they would rather turn their 
back and not want to see the issue." 
</P>
<P>
Teraoka's combination of ancient East and contemporary West "represents the way 
I live and think. I cannot really totally get rid of my background as a 
Japanese-born American citizen." 
</P>
<P>
The juxtaposition also underlines the tremendous chasm between the two cultures 
and "makes contemporary American life seem more contemporary," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Japan and America are so opposite, in every direction. When I compare Japan 
with European countries, there are quite a number of similarities. Europeans 
have long traditions and seem to have a lot of feeling for a caste system and 
for family and ancestors. Also, Japanese and European people have a more 
reserved attitude than Americans. So after all my travels in Europe and life in 
America, I find the most strikingly different countries are Japan and America." 
</P>
<P>
"Waves and Plagues," running through April 23, was organized by the new 
Contemporary Museum in Honolulu. It comprises 33 works, including eight 
landscapes and several multipanel screens.

NEW KIDS IN TOWN: THE PROCLAIMERS TAKE THE HIGH ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Artist: The Proclaimers. 
</P>
<P>
History: The Proclaimers have been playing together all their lives -- if not 
necessarily musically, or under that name: The band's sole members are twin 
brothers Charlie and Craig Reid, from the village of Auchtermuchty in the 
county of Fife. The two Scots flirted with punk as teens but settled on a 
folkish style when they began performing acoustic sets as the Proclaimers six 
years ago. In 1986 the Reids were discovered by the well-respected 
Housemartins, and a tour together led to a contract with Chrysalis. The 
Proclaimers' 1987 debut, "This Is the Story," attracted major acclaim in 
Britain if only minor attention in America. A new, far more commercially viable 
release, "Sunshine on Leith," has already gone platinum (sales of 300,000) in 
Britain, and while its market prospects are limited here by its 
east-of-the-Atlantic flavor, the Proclaimers should at least become Stateside 
college radio sweethearts. 
</P>
<P>
Sound: This is a Scottish outfit that sounds like a Scottish outfit -- not so 
much in the music, which is actually quite strong in wearing its American pop 
and country influences, but in the accents, which are unmistakably thick. 
That's part of the charm, and perhaps part of the hindrance to their mainstream 
acceptance in America. Initially, the Proclaimers were hampered as well by 
their mere-duo status, which they declined to enhance with added 
instrumentation on their first album. The second release feels like a debut: 
With plenty of help from a full band, including steel guitar, the Reids still 
focus their sound around Charlie's acoustic guitar but come into their own as 
harmonizers, as lyricists, as modern lovers. The romantic, the spiritual, the 
sexual and the socio-economic all find their place, with a much lighter, 
jauntier touch than many of their political compatriots in pop. It's lilting 
but earthbound, unabashedly hopeful but witty and even bluesy. Listen for their 
surprising outside song choice, Steve Earle's lovely "My Old Friend the Blues."

THRIVING ON A COLLISION OF CULTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pop music thrives on the collisions of cultures. Look what happened when the 
Mississippi Delta blues was transplanted to Chicago. Consider the myriad of 
ingredients that spiced New Orleans R&amp;B. A geographic area may spawn music 
with common elements -- particularly rhythmic -- but it's the 
cross-fertilization of different styles that creates the most heady hybrids. 
</P>
<P>
Take the sweep of music found around the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean -- 
the focus of this edition of On the Offbeat, a periodic review of roots, 
international and non-mainstream pop. The music from those coastal regions has 
made its home in nortenas cantinas and sweaty Jamaican dance halls, in swank 
jazz clubs and high-tech Parisian recording studios. 
</P>
<P>
STEVE JORDAN 
</P>
<P>
"The Return of El Parche." Rounder. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan is a one-eyed Tex-Mex performer who has been dubbed the Jimi Hendrix of 
the accordion. This compilation of material recorded from 1976 to 1984 is the 
first of his 34 albums to be released on a label with easy access for Anglos. 
It's a good introduction to this wild and woolly talent, who appeared briefly 
in the films "True Stories" and "Born in East L.A." You can hear why Jordan has 
made purists cringe. His solos and the arrangements spin off on unexpected 
tangents, and his tone is tart, florid and vaguely European ("Oaxaca" even 
recalls Argentine tango maestro Astor Piazzolla). The Spanish version of 
"Yakity Yak" is fun, but it's Jordan's flair and unpredictability that make him 
special. 
</P>
<P>
MOSE ALLISON 
</P>
<P>
"Greatest Hits -- The Prestige Collection." Prestige. 
</P>
<P>
Wildness is not part of Mose Allison's game plan. The Mississippi-born pianist 
is all understatement, his gently funky piano and weathered, soft-spoken drawl 
putting a lazy jazz tinge to material often drawn from the songbooks of Delta 
bluesmen. Allison has mined the same vein for more than 30 years, which makes 
him the kind of musician a casual fan can explore through a greatest-hits 
collection . . . like this one, where some 1957-59 classics -- "Parchman Farm," 
"Lost Mind," "The Seventh Son," "Young Man Blues" -- are given the quietly 
insinuating Allison treatment. 
</P>
<P>
TIGER 
</P>
<P>
"Bam Bam." RAS. 
</P>
<P>
Quietly insinuating definitely doesn't apply to Tiger, a young Jamaican toaster 
with a harsh, raspy voice and a taste for ferociously up-tempo dance-hall 
rhythms. Tiger's intense energy on selections like "Do It Any Way" forces you 
to take notice, but the best moments on his second album come when he slows 
down a bit and settles into the high-stepping grooves of "Decent Man" and the 
title track. The combination of his rasp, his high-speed delivery and his 
accent makes it hard to understand what he's raving on about, but he makes you 
pay attention. 
</P>
<P>
VARIOUS ARTISTS 
</P>
<P>
"When the Time Comes: Rebel Soca." Shanachie. 
</P>
<P>
This compilation spotlights a period when the popular Caribbean music known as 
soca -- short for soul calypso -- was heavily influenced by reggae. Calypso 
lyrics are often political, but the focus here falls too heavily on message 
over melody. And it's even hard to make out some of the lyrics. Nelson's "When 
De Time Comes" and Johnny King's "War Mongers" cut through the murky 
production, but the opening song -- Safi Abdullah's "Afrika Is Burning" -- sets 
such a high standard with its majestic, reggae-tinged arrangement and barbed 
lyrics that the remainder of "Rebel Soca" pales in comparison. 
</P>
<P>
GAZOLINN 
</P>
<P>
"Gazolinn." Rhythmo-Disc (French import). 
</P>
<P>
While Kassav' is the most visible of the bands working in the exciting new zouk 
style, this unit is often credited as the most musically challenging. That 
assessment doesn't sound far-fetched on "Gazolinn," a successful marriage of 
tropical dance pulses and sophisticated arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
"Machann' Lanmou" moves without a hitch from hard funk to pure salsa; 
"C.B.W.I." follows a jazzy blues harmonica solo with an excursion to carnival 
time down at percussion junction. Best of all is "Tchie Moin Pa Pare," which 
opens with upscale Euro-pop before shifting gears as a synthesizer melody 
ushers in massed vocal harmonies playing so smoothly off the horn lines that 
you instinctively realize that this is elemental, primal zouk from the islands. 
The big drawback: only 30 minutes of music. 
</P>
<P>
QUATRE ETOILES 
</P>
<P>
"Dance." Tangent (French import). 
</P>
<P>
One fascinating development in international music has been the collaborations 
between French-speaking African and Antillean musicians in Parisian recording 
studios. Zouk or soca elements have been popping up more frequently in African 
pop records, and "Dance" is a marvelous example by this "supergroup" of 
prominent musicians from Zaire. The guitar drive and gentle lilt are Zairian 
traits, while the crackling horn lines and contemporary synthesizer squiggles 
inject Caribbean color. The vocal harmonies mesh beautifully, but the star 
among these four stars is lead guitarist Syran M'benza, who brings a feathery, 
bluesy touch (that shouldn't sound foreign to Mark Knopfler fans) to solos on 
"Mayanga" and "Ba Relations." Imaginative arrangements and fine performances 
add up to a great record.

POI: A HAWIIAN INSTITUTION TAKES ITS FAIR SHARE OF LUMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
All the Polynesians eat it! 
</P>
<P>
 -- Flossie Bobbsey on poi, "The Bobbsey Twins in Volcano Land" 
</P>
<P>
It can be white, pink, purplish or even gray; it's said to taste like wallpaper 
paste; and, like Don Ho, it is a Hawaiian institution. It's poi and few 
tourists ever leave the islands without at least a taste of the stuff. Still 
fewer understand why the odd goo is such a beloved dish. 
</P>
<P>
"Nine times out of 10, tourists have just a bite of poi -- no more than that," 
says chef Roy Yamaguchi (formerly of Los Angeles' 385 North, now of Roy's in 
Honolulu). "Poi is one of those flavors and textures that you have to have when 
you're very young. It's hard to get accustomed to." 
</P>
<P>
Or as Trader Vic wrote in his "Pacific Island Cookbook": "Americans do not 
appreciate food which is too far out." 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Murata and Chris Hang work at the Ala Moana shopping center in Honolulu. 
Both are 22 and were raised in Hawaii. They sling poi -- and other Hawaiian 
specialties -- for a living . . . in a restaurant called the Poi Bowl. Yet even 
they are divided on poi. 
</P>
<P>
Murata thinks poi is swell. But Hang, 10 minutes into a telephone conversation 
on the appeal of poi, admits, "I don't care for it myself -- it's just like 
this slime going down your throat . . . and it doesn't have any taste . . . 
and, uh, maybe you should talk to someone who likes poi." 
</P>
<P>
At this point, Murata comes on the line: "Sure it can be bland, but that's when 
it's fresh. I like it sour." 
</P>
<P>
To make poi, taro root is pounded and mixed with water until it gets mushy, 
like lumpy mashed potatoes, and then it's left to ferment a while. Like wine, 
poi seems to get better with age. 
</P>
<P>
At the Poi Bowl, though, no poi older than two days is served. "Old poi is only 
for the employees," Murata says, "and for the locals who ask for it." 
</P>
<P>
The mush you might have been served at a hotel luau was almost certainly not 
aged, and probably served plain, which is the rough equivalent of eating 
potatoes mashed without butter or cream. 
</P>
<P>
"I like poi with sugar," Murata says. So does Roy Yamaguchi: "When I was a kid 
I used to mix it with sugar and wash it down with Coke." 
</P>
<P>
Thickness is said to be another important poi variable: food and travel books 
are full of rosy-prosed discussions of charming natives scooping up one-finger, 
two-finger and three-finger pois, each symbolizing a different level of 
thickness. 
</P>
<P>
I ask Murata what she prefers. 
</P>
<P>
"Fingers?" she says and pauses for a moment. "Oh no, we just use spoons."

Regarding Riva Berger Tooley's review of "Passion and Prejudice: A Family 
Memoir" by Sallie Bingham (Book Review, Feb. 19). In the following sentence, 
the word "age" was mistakenly substituted for "rage." The sentence should have 
read: "Most of the points that the jittery author tries to make about modern 
society become obscured by her rage."

CREATIVE COMPROMISE IS ELUSIVE FOR ARTISTS, SPONSORS; 
</P>
<P>
BOTH SIDES STUMBLE IN SEARCH FOR WORK THAT IS A BIT 'OUT THERE' -- BUT NOT TOO 
FAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
While many artists are dropping out of performance, others have tried to adapt 
to the pressures of playing to a more conventional audience. The compromise can 
be painful. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to make a living at it, but that's never what performance was about 
before," said RoseLee Goldberg, who teaches performance art history at New York 
University. "The artists find themselves trying to walk a tightrope between the 
avant-garde and the establishment, and that is very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
John White, a Venice artist who is also a UC Irvine guest lecturer on 
performance, had an encounter with the Los Angeles Music Center last summer 
that underscored the risks of creative compromise, both for artists and for 
mainstream sponsors in search of art that is a little "out there." 
</P>
<P>
For 20 years, White performed pieces that entwined aspects of visual art and 
storytelling. He worked in storefronts, private homes, hospitals and schools, 
rarely pocketing more that $300 a shot. He once hit a golf ball out of a 
fourth-story window while blindfolded, as a concealed audiotape congratulated 
him on the shot. 
</P>
<P>
Discouraged by the sand-trap economics of performance, White quit 2 years ago 
to focus on painting. But in 1987, when the Music Center invited proposals for 
a piece for L.A. Alive Festival, White decided to give it one more swing, as a 
director this time. He won the commission. 
</P>
<P>
"The Music Center!" he declared. "Performance was going uptown, and I wanted to 
see what that was like. For years, one of my big things has been to get 
performance into venues where it had never played before. And they were 
offering $2,000!" 
</P>
<P>
He devised a light-heartedly funky, Californian spin on Dadaism: He had the 
Shrimps -- an L.A.-based performance art/theatrical troupe, noted in part for 
their big, wide or elongated bodies -- dress in tropical Hawaiian outfits and 
throw around tires, crates, ladders and other junkyard items -- all painted 
black. 
</P>
<P>
Two days before show time, he received a phone call. Esther Wachtell, the Music 
Center's president, had about 10 complaints from people who had seen White's 
work in rehearsal on the outdoor plaza. 
</P>
<P>
"People were eating their lunch, and they were from senior citizens' housing 
and apartments nearby," Wachtell said. "They were watching him rehearse and 
were offended by the anger that seemed to underlay a lot of his presentation." 
</P>
<P>
Wachtell asked Music Center volunteer Jennifer Diener to ask White to shorten 
his piece and use "a little less volatile flinging around." 
</P>
<P>
Diener said she passed on those complaints and one other, about the Shrimps. 
White said he will always remember her remark: "Those peoples' bodies aren't 
the sorts of bodies we want associated with the image of the Los Angeles Music 
Center." 
</P>
<P>
Attempting a cure-all concession that still poked fun at what he perceived as 
the Music Center's stuffy self-regard, White dressed his performers in tuxedos. 
But he said he has not regained his sense of humor about the episode. 
</P>
<P>
Now he believes that he is back to painting for good: "Having control over what 
I do is my only power as an artist. Taking that away from people will be the 
death of performance." ALLAN JALON

RANDY LEWIS: PEERING UNDER A ROCK SKEWS HIS PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
EULOGY FOR A G-G-GENERATION'S MUSIC RIPS THE USUAL SUSPECTS BUT IS DISHONEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Last year it was Allan Bloom, the University of Chicago professor of social 
thought and author of "The Closing of the American Mind," who laid the bloodied 
corpse of all things decent and nice at the doorstep of good ol' rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
This year it's Stuart Goldman, who has written a spiteful eulogy for rock that 
recently appeared in William F. Buckley's oh-so-conservative National Review. 
</P>
<P>
That's not surprising, of course: You'd expect to see something as oriented to 
youth (and rebellion) as rock pooh-poohed in a magazine such as the Review, 
designed for readers who look down their noses at public television. 
</P>
<P>
But Goldman isn't quite so easily dismissed as earlier critics such as Bloom, a 
curmudgeonly academician whose only contact with rock was what he had read 
about it in the Senate subcommittee's white paper on lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman, you see, isn't one of their generation -- one of the cultural 
strangers that the Lovin' Spoonful knew you could never tell about rock 'n' 
roll, one of the old coots who inspired Pete Townshend to write, "Hope I die 
before I get old." 
</P>
<P>
Goldman is one of us. Not only did he write about rock for several years (many 
of the stories for The Times), he actually played the dastardly stuff in a 
band. With a bus. And roadies. 
</P>
<P>
But sometime in the early '80s, Goldman lost his enthusiasm for rock. Which, 
from the tone of his article, is like saying the Ayatollah lost his patience 
with Salman Rushdie. 
</P>
<P>
"I finally threw in the towel," Goldman writes. "I didn't want it anymore. No 
more smoky nightclubs, no more bad music. Today, I'm as foreign to the world of 
rock music as a fish out of slime." 
</P>
<P>
"It was with that attitude -- that of an observer, an emigre, an alien -- that 
I re-entered that world," Goldman adds, "to see where it had gone some 35 years 
after its birth in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1954." 
</P>
<P>
He watched MTV for 42 hours straight. He pored over such magazines as Rolling 
Stone, Spin, Rip and Heavy Metal. "What," he asks, "in God's name happened" to 
the music that had, in retrospect, seemed so innocent in the hands of Elvis, 
Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck Berry and the rest of rock's '50s forefathers? 
</P>
<P>
Over the next four-plus pages, Goldman compiles a litany of horrors, mutants 
and demons that have slithered out of rock's primordial tide pool since those 
early days. Bands with disgusting names, such as Scraping Fetus Off the Wheel. 
Songs with lyrics too graphic to print in a family newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
He even torpedoes rock's socially conscious side, from the Concert for 
Bangladesh in 1971 up to Live Aid, Band Aid and all the other Aid-shows. "We've 
yet to see multimillionaires of the Springsteen/Sting ilk donating any 
significant percentage of their yearly incomes to the causes that are so 
beloved by them. Until that happens, I'm inclined to agree with 
(dum-de-dum-dum) Allan Bloom, who . . . writes off rock's humanitarian efforts 
as a 'smarmy, hypocritical version of brotherly love.' " 
</P>
<P>
Trouble is, a lot of the time Goldman is right. 
</P>
<P>
Too much of rock has sunk into the cultural swamp, along with an unhealthy 
portion of its audience. (Anyone care to defend Tone Loc's multimillion-selling 
"Wild Thing" as a life- and love-affirming ode to the joys of 
self-actualization and mutual fulfillment through interpersonal relationships?) 
</P>
<P>
And I can't argue when Goldman says that "rock as a whole has mastered the art 
of turning depravity into good PR. Witness the numerous rock stars who have 
jumped onto the RAD (Rockers Against Drugs) bandwagon. The basic shtick is 
simple: Become an addict; then, after years of abuse, come clean (or at least 
say you've come clean -- who checks, anyway?) in a heartfelt public statement. 
If this proves impossible, paying homage to a former bandmate who has died of a 
drug overdose will do in a pinch." 
</P>
<P>
But Goldman is so busy taking a magnifying glass to the muck stuck to the 
bottom of rock's shoe that he forgets about what's still going on above the 
neck. 
</P>
<P>
Is there anyone under 50 who doesn't have a story about the way a rock song 
offered comfort through tough times? A lyric that gave solace in the face of 
loss, respite in the face of adversity, humor in the face of gloom? A melody 
that gave a broken spirit reason to sing again? 
</P>
<P>
The qualities of liberation and release that made rock's pioneers so appealing 
can still be found in rock of the '80s -- if you look in the right place. 
</P>
<P>
You don't write off all of cinema because of "Friday the 13th, Part 99," all of 
TV because of Morton Downey Jr. or all of literature because of Jackie Collins. 
But that's what Goldman does: He is dispatching all of rock into the same heap 
simply because he can point to a few pandering, sexist music videos by Kiss or 
song titles such as Slayer's "Spill the Blood" and "Mandatory Suicide." 
</P>
<P>
Swear off rock, as Goldman suggests, and you also swear off the sublimely 
spiritual songs of Van Morrison, the hauntingly beautiful instrumentals of Mark 
Knopfler, the soul-stirring world beat of Peter Gabriel, the incandescent 
Afro-pop of Johnny Clegg &amp; Savuka. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, you see, is not so much in what we find in rock, but in where we 
look for it; the solution is not in lowering our standards, but in raising our 
sights. 
</P>
<P>
And the fault, dear Stuart, lies not in our rock stars, but in ourselves.

2 ACCUSED OF O.C. MURDER ATTEMPT; 
</P>
<P>
TOPLESS CLUB, MOB ANGLES EXPECTED TO ENLIVEN TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY WRIDE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Rizzitello was doing time for kidnaping and robbery, and Bill Carroll was 
in for grand theft when they met in 1970 on the tennis courts of Chino State 
Prison. 
</P>
<P>
Their association would end 17 years later in a deserted Costa Mesa parking 
garage, where prosecutors allege Rizzitello, a reputed Los Angeles mob captain, 
pumped three bullets into Carroll's head while Carroll's driver, Joey Grosso, 
held down his legs. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll had been resisting Rizzitello's efforts to gain control of a topless 
nightclub he partly owned, authorities said, and paid the price for it. 
</P>
<P>
"This is for not letting us eat," Rizzitello allegedly hissed as he pulled the 
trigger three times, leaving Carroll to die. 
</P>
<P>
 But Carroll lived to face the men he says tried to kill him. In the coming 
weeks Rizzitello and Grosso will go on trial in Santa Ana Superior Court for 
attempted first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
Reference to the mob, the notorious Mustang topless bar and a gaudy Italian 
restaurant should lend a theatrical quality to the proceedings, scheduled to 
begin April 10. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy courtroom security will add drama. Authorities say Carroll, who was 
permanently blinded in the attack shortly after midnight May 1, 1987, was 
repeatedly threatened after the shooting with phone messages like, "This is it. 
It's live or die." 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, armed guards will be brought in and everyone entering the 
courtroom will be searched with a metal detector. As the prosecution's star 
witness, Carroll's past testimony is on videotape in the event of a Mafia hit, 
the district attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
Like a ghost rising from the dead, the scandal-wracked Mustang will provide a 
backdrop for the trial. Law enforcement sources say the Santa Ana tavern was 
the den of much of the county's organized crime activity. The club was torched 
and destroyed 14 months ago, and a Bellflower man was convicted of arson. 
</P>
<P>
Three months later, Mustang bouncer George Yudzevich, who allegedly bragged 
that he had disposed of the attackers' bloodied clothing, their gun and the 
silencer, was killed. Rizzitello is a suspect in Yudzevich's gangland-style 
slaying, said Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans. 
</P>
<P>
Yudzevich, a suspected accomplice in the Carroll attack, was killed in a 
shooting that bore a striking resemblance to Carroll's 10 days after 
Rizzitello's release from prison, prosecutors said in court records. Rizzitello 
denied any wrongdoing through his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bail Denied 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that Grosso has insisted he will not testify against 
Rizzitello and has nothing to fear, the 4th District Court of Appeal on March 2 
denied his latest request for bail. Both remain at Orange County Jail. Evans 
successfully argued that Rizzitello would pose a public threat and Grosso would 
be killed by the mob if either was released on bail. 
</P>
<P>
As he awaits trial and another appeal for bail, Grosso has busied himself in 
jail reading a good book. He says it has several passages about Rizzitello and 
other alleged gangsters. It's called "The Last Mafioso." 
</P>
<P>
Although he admits to a fascination with organized crime figures, Grosso has no 
felony convictions himself and denies any mob ties, Evans said. Grosso 
acknowledges, however, that some of his best friends operate on the fringes of 
the underworld. 
</P>
<P>
Rizzitello's criminal record spans 4 decades and at least two states, and the 
Orange County charges he now faces carry the potential for his longest stint 
yet behind bars. If convicted, he and Grosso would face life imprisonment for 
the attempted murder charge plus additional prison time for other charges 
related to the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors believe this trial will provide the best opportunity yet to 
permanently imprison a reputed mob captain that some organized crime experts 
consider the heir-apparent to the Milano crime family in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The trial is expected to last less than 2 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Innocent Pleas 
</P>
<P>
Although Rizzitello, 61, of Los Angeles and Grosso, 45, of Las Vegas and Costa 
Mesa have yet to offer a defense in court, both have pleaded innocent to the 
charges. They are expected to try and prove -- or at least suggest -- that 
someone else shot Carroll that night nearly 2 years ago near the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
Grosso admits that his defense could be daunting, although he is indignant 
about the charges. 
</P>
<P>
In numerous jail interviews with The Times, Grosso has gone so far as to say he 
had dinner with Carroll and Yudzevich the night of the shooting and was with 
them immediately afterward. When he stopped to use a pay phone, Grosso said, 
Yudzevich shot Carroll. But in trying to cast suspicion away from Yudzevich, a 
buddy of 2 decades, Grosso concedes that he later told Mustang club manager 
Gene Lesher that Rizzitello shot Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
"I admit it does not look good," Grosso said. "I wish I had not done that." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll, 56, whose whereabouts are being kept secret, is expected to offer the 
same story that he did last fall during preliminary hearings for Rizzitello and 
Grosso. 
</P>
<P>
Grosso hopes to tell jurors about the first time he says Carroll approached him 
with a deal: to sell counterfeits of the signed and numbered belt buckles 
Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates doles out to big-bucks campaign contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans describes Grosso's version of the shooting as fiction. "And it's not 
even good fiction. . . . I like that bit about the buckles though." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resume Contact 
</P>
<P>
After their paroles in the early 1970s, there were no more daily tennis 
matches. Carroll claims that more than 17 years passed without a word from 
Rizzitello. Prosecutors will argue in court that Rizzitello's desire for easy 
money and Carroll's reluctance to offend the mob brought them together again in 
1987, and that this time there was no love lost. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors gave this account of the case in court testimony: 
</P>
<P>
Rizzitello contacted Carroll because he wanted financial control of the 
Mustang, which was earning $150,000 a month and was repeatedly under police 
investigation for prostitution and drug activities. 
</P>
<P>
When Carroll resisted being muscled by the mob, the cost was his vision. 
</P>
<P>
In the months before Carroll was shot, he accepted several invitations to meet 
Rizzitello for dinner. Initial meetings were cordial, but soon Rizzitello, a 
clothing wholesaler, began pressing Carroll to buy Levis. 
</P>
<P>
Because he feared for his safety, Carroll agreed to make a purchase but wanted 
instead to buy $10,000 worth of lingerie Rizzitello also sold. Carroll told 
authorities he thought he could at least secure a return on his money by 
selling the undergarments to the club's 70 dancers, who in turn sold them to 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll told investigators that Grosso sold the undergarments to the dancers 
for him, but Carroll never received the proceeds. Confronted about this, Grosso 
claimed that his girlfriend, Connie -- now his wife -- would bring in the 
money, Carroll said. When she did not, Carroll complained to Rizzitello. He 
also allegedly told Rizzitello that he fired Yudzevich and kicked Grosso out of 
the Mustang because they were selling drugs to customers and the dancers. That 
was early in March, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shooting Incident 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, someone shot at Carroll outside the bar on Harbor Boulevard, 
apparently grazing him but causing no injuries. He later told authorities he 
did not report it to police because he believed they would be of no help. The 
next month, on the night of April 30, Grosso called Carroll to say Rizzitello 
"could help" him with the near-miss shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll met the pair at an Italian restaurant in Santa Ana, authorities said. 
Rizzitello and Grosso were waiting for him out in front, where a mint green 
plaster statue greets diners. After dinner, Carroll agreed to drive them back 
to their car in Costa Mesa. When they arrived and the parking garage was empty, 
Carroll said, he turned to ask about their car and found Rizzitello pointing a 
gun at him with a silencer on it. 
</P>
<P>
Security guards later found Carroll bleeding near his car. 
</P>
<P>
From his hospital bed and later from his Buena Park home, Carroll steadfastly 
refused to tell numerous law enforcement investigators who had shot him and 
why. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen months later, he finally told investigators Rizzitello and Grosso were 
his attackers. It was the day after prosecutors decided to dismiss 10 felony 
counts against him in connection with an alleged bank fraud. He pleaded no 
contest to a single misdemeanor charge of using a false business address in the 
case. Evans said the case file was sealed by court order at the request of 
Carroll, who did not want his address made public record. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys last year tried to tarnish Carroll's credibility by 
suggesting that his testimony came in return for the dismissal of the charges 
-- an accusation Evans has vehemently denied. Carroll testified that he 
received numerous death threats by phone after he was shot and decided to talk 
to authorities only after his court matter had been resolved. He said he feared 
being killed in jail if he blamed Rizzitello. 
</P>
<P>
"I absolutely did not make a deal with the D.A.'s office," Carroll told the 
court last fall. "I have never been promised anything -- not even a cup of 
coffee -- by law enforcement to testify here today." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Story Called 'Preposterous' 
</P>
<P>
Rizzitello won't be interviewed about the case against him. His attorney, 
Anthony Brooklier, concedes that though his client is no Boy Scout, Rizzitello 
"had no motive . . . to hurt Mr. Carroll, and Carroll's story is preposterous." 
</P>
<P>
Brooklier disputed that Rizzitello was battling for control of the Mustang. 
"It's not true." As to Rizzitello being an alleged suspect in Yudzevich's 
murder, Brooklier points out that he has not been arrested or charged. Quite 
simply, Brooklier said, Orange County prosecutors should either put up or shut 
up with their "wild speculations." 
</P>
<P>
Although Rizzitello has said nothing, his co-defendant has talked plenty about 
the charges, all of which he denies. In addition to attempted murder, both men 
have been charged with one count each of mayhem and conspiracy to commit 
murder. Rizzitello is also being tried on charges of unlawful use of a firearm 
and being a convicted felon in possession of a gun. 
</P>
<P>
Grosso, married to a statuesque model, is the owner of Diplomat Limousine 
Service in Newport Beach. He was a member of the exclusive Balboa Bay Club 
until his membership was suspended pending this trial. He says he has 
campaigned for New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and led a citizens' drive to make 
the office of Newport Beach mayor an elective rather than appointive office. 
</P>
<P>
"I am an upstanding citizen," he said. "I was a captain for the Democratic 
Party!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fraud Trial 
</P>
<P>
He awaits trial on fraud charges in another Orange County criminal case, this 
one involving investments and weekend junkets to Las Vegas in which he said 
gamblers lost money and blamed him. Police who arrested him in 1986 said 
otherwise: Investors were told they could make huge profits by helping Las 
Vegas and Atlantic City casinos launder organized crime money and skim casino 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
The trial hurt his limo business, Grosso said. To make ends meet, he became 
Carroll's driver in January, 1987. That month, the first of three men linked to 
the Mustang club was shot. On New Year's Day, Mustang owner Jimmy Casino was 
shot to death in his Buena Park home. Carroll was shot May 1. On March 3, 1988, 
Yudzevich, 6-foot-7 and known as Big George, was shot three times in the head 
and killed in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Police have never solved the murders of Casino and Yudzevich. 
</P>
<P>
Although he denied being involved with Carroll's shooting, Grosso admits to 
being present immediately before and afterward. His version of that night 
differs from the prosecution's -- right down to the weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll was angry and concerned about Yudzevich's impending testimony about the 
mob before a New York grand jury and decided to fire him, Grosso said in 
interviews. "I want him out of the club," Grosso quoted Carroll as saying. 
</P>
<P>
In Carroll's rented Honda, the three drove to dinner at a fancy Italian 
restaurant in Costa Mesa, Grosso said. He said Carroll's own car -- which he 
obsessively had checked for bugging devices -- was being repaired. Carroll and 
Yudzevich argued heatedly during the meal. As they left the restaurant, Grosso 
claims his pager went off and he went to use a pay phone. Carroll and Yudzevich 
preceded him to the car. When he got to it, Grosso says, Yudzevich stood 
holding a gun -- without the silencer Rizzitello is accused of using -- and 
Carroll lay bleeding in the car. 
</P>
<P>
Grosso claims that he tried to take Carroll to a hospital but that Carroll 
insisted nobody be told of the shooting. Grosso, breaking into sobs as he 
recounted this story, said Carroll assured him he could handle Yudzevich, who 
then drove the Honda to the parking garage where guards later found the wounded 
Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meeting With Agents 
</P>
<P>
Despite at least one meeting at the Embassy Suites Hotel in Santa Ana with FBI 
agents and investigators from the district attorney's office, Grosso said he 
refused to discuss Carroll's shooting because he had promised "on my kid's 
life" not to. 
</P>
<P>
He admits, however, that his loyalty only stretched so far; he said he told 
detectives about a variety of robberies and loan-sharking activities for which 
he alleges Carroll was responsible. 
</P>
<P>
Grosso believes that Carroll has now turned on him after learning of Grosso's 
cooperation with investigators and that the district attorney's office 
continues to have him jailed without bail in the hopes that his resolve not to 
testify against Rizzitello will crumble. 
</P>
<P>
"They said they wanted something on Carroll to get him to talk about who shot 
him," Grosso said. "And I gave it to them. Me. I put myself in here. . . . I 
was double-crossed by the D.A., but I would never -- I will never -- testify 
against a man who didn't do anything wrong, and Mike Rizzitello didn't shoot 
nobody." 
</P>
<P>
Evans said he does not want to try this case in the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"But let's just say that Joey Grosso's story is like that big trash barge that 
couldn't find a port to take it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Key Figures in Trial 
</P>
<P>
Michael Anthony Rizzitello, 61, of Los Angeles owns a wholesale clothing 
business. He has served time in state and federal prison for a variety of 
crimes since 1947, most recently racketeering. He is featured prominently in 
the book "The Last Mafioso" by Jimmy (The Weasel) Fratianno. Rizzitello is 
considered by some organized crime experts to be the heir-apparent to Los 
Angeles' organized crime family. Rizzitello is charged with shooting William 
Carroll in the head three times shortly after midnight on May 1, 1987, because 
Carroll wouldn't relinquish controlof the now-defunct Mustange bar in Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Joseph Angelo Grosso, 45, of Costa Mesa owns Diplomat Lilmousine Service in 
Newport Beach and New York. Grosso is awaiting trial on charges that he and 
George Yudzevich bilked investors and Las Vegas and Atlantic City gamblers in a 
casino money-laundering scheme. That case hurt the limousine business and 
Grosso became William Carroll's driver. He is charged with attempting to murder 
Carroll by preventing Carroll from squirming as he was shot by Rizzitello. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
William C. Carroll, 56, formerly of Buena Park, is a protected witness and his 
whereabouts are unknown. Carroll held a substantial financial interest in the 
Mustang bar, where some considred him the "controller". Carroll is said by 
prosecutors to support himself off high-interest loans he grants. Carroll was 
sentenced in 1070 to Chino State Prison for fraud involving rental equipment. 
He was charged in 1984 with 10 felony counts for allegedly conspiring with the 
then-branch manager to bilk $500,000 in fraudulent loans from American State 
Bank in Orange. The major charges against him were dismissed the day before he 
blamed Rizzitello and Grosso for shooting him. He remains blinded by that 
attack.

The Huntington Beach City Council will hold a public hearing Tuesday on whether 
to change zoning from commercial to conservation on degraded wetlands 
stretching along Pacific Coast Highway between Beach Boulevard and the Santa 
Ana River. The area has been designated for conservation in the city's general 
plan, but specific zoning of the property stalled in the Planning Commission 
after threats of legal action by two private landowners. 
</P>
<P>
One parcel between Brookhurst Street and the Santa Ana River, known as the 
Talbert Marsh, is already undergoing restoration under the auspices of the 
private Huntington Beach Wetlands Conservancy. Last month, tidal flow was 
restored to the 24-acre parcel.

The Board of Supervisors will hold a public hearing Wednesday to consider 
raising the annual fees for about 11,000 Orange County businesses that generate 
or store hazardous wastes underground. 
</P>
<P>
The county conducts routine annual inspections of businesses that handle or 
store hazardous wastes. To pay for that inspection, those businesses must pay 
an annual fee, ranging from $165 for a company with fewer than 10 employees to 
$1,002 for companies with more than 500 workers. County health officials have 
proposed a 3.5% to 4% fee increase for all companies.

GRAND JURY TOLD BROWN, JOHNSON AT MEETING ON LETTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republican Assemblymen Dennis Brown of Los Alamitos and Ross Johnson of La 
Habra were at a key 1986 meeting when the decision was made to mail of 
thousands of campaign letters bearing the unauthorized signature of President 
Reagan, according to the grand jury testimony of a political consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Brown and Johnson were not charged with any crimes for their role in the 
affair, which led to the indictment of Assemblyman John Lewis (R-Orange) Feb. 6 
on a single count of forging the President's name on the letters. Lewis, who is 
seeking to have the indictment dismissed, has denied wrongdoing in the case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Transcripts Unsealed 
</P>
<P>
But transcripts of the testimony of several witnesses called before the 
Sacramento County Grand Jury in February, unsealed Friday, detail for the first 
time how Johnson and Brown, as well as then-Assembly Republican Leader Pat 
Nolan of Glendale, were allegedly present when the decision to send the letters 
was made, despite the fact that the White House had denied them permission to 
use Reagan's name. 
</P>
<P>
All four were part of a group of Assembly Republicans who developed strategy 
for their party's candidates in the 1986 elections. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson could not be reached for comment Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Partisan Witch Hunt' 
</P>
<P>
Through an aide, he said Friday that he considers the investigation a "partisan 
witch hunt" by Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, a Democratic candidate for 
governor. Brown said Saturday that it would be "inappropriate to comment" on 
specific segments of the grand jury transcripts. 
</P>
<P>
"But I will say that when certain individuals are forced to testify under oath, 
the people of California will see a much different picture than that 
represented in the grand jury transcript," Brown added. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to send the letters without authorization was made at an Oct. 24 
meeting of Johnson, Brown, Nolan and Lewis at Johnson's district office in 
Fullerton, according to the consultant, Tim Macy, who testified under a grant 
of immunity from the attorney general's office. Macy testified that he learned 
in later conversations with Nolan that Brown was present. Lewis later told him 
that Johnson was at the session, Macy testified. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was relayed in a long-distance telephone conversation from Lewis 
to a Macy, who was in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him (Lewis) if they were sure if they wanted to have the letters 
mailed out without authorization," Macy said. "He told me he needed to go in 
and ask the entire group and came back out and said that they did." 
</P>
<P>
Macy also testified under oath that Brown told him to rewrite a Reagan letter 
that was mailed for Republican candidate Roger Fiola in his race against 
Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd (D-Carson). According to the transcripts, Macy 
testified that Brown told him the letter was not "tough enough." The result was 
a new missive, never submitted to the White House for approval, that accused 
Floyd of caving in "to the powerful underworld drug industry." 
</P>
<P>
Macy said Nolan told him that when the GOP leaders were deciding whether to 
send out the letters, Brown said "he would take full responsibility for the 
letters in his campaigns," meaning the Fiola race and another contest in 
Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by the prosecutor what Nolan meant when he said Brown would take full 
responsibility, Macy responded: "That they weren't authorized and that 
Assemblyman Brown wanted those letters to be mailed in those races." 
</P>
<P>
The letters were mailed, but when some of them that could not be delivered to 
the addressees were sent by the post office to the White House, which was 
listed as the return address, Reagan Administration officials became suspicious 
and began to investigate. It was then that Lewis and Nolan told their staff 
members to lie to the White House and avoid speaking to the FBI, according to 
the testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Olsen, the Lewis aide who had sought White House approval for the letters 
but was denied it, testified that Lewis called him and another staff member 
into his Capitol office to discuss how they would respond to the White House. 
Olsen said Lewis met with Johnson and Nolan for 90 minutes before calling him 
and his co-workers into his inner office. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis told the pair to tell White House investigators an "Alphonse-Gaston" 
story -- a reference to a classic French comic routine -- in which the two 
employees would say that the entire incident was the result of a "bumbling" 
miscommunication, not a deliberate attempt to mislead the voters, Olsen 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
When the other staff member, Richard Temple, refused to go along, Lewis, Olsen 
and Temple went downstairs to meet with Nolan, who was in his office with 
Johnson, Olsen testified. 
</P>
<P>
As Johnson left, Nolan turned to Lewis and, according to Olsen, said: "Why did 
you bring them (the staffers) down here? I thought that we had arranged that 
you would talk to them to give me deniability." Nolan then reviewed the plans 
for the cover-up, according to Olsen.

Regarding the article concerning the multiple killings of Tustin resident pets 
(Orange County section, March 10): 
</P>
<P>
Excuse me, please? Did I read correctly that Tustin area pets found dead with 
almost no blood in their bodies, severed paws and "washed organs" are being 
explained away as coyote kills? 
</P>
<P>
Are coyotes getting tidy these days? Well, I just think it's so kind of the 
coyotes to leave the kitties nicely arranged for the owners to find later. 
</P>
<P>
Golly, when I lived in coyote country, four of my kitties and many of my 
neighbors' pets disappeared without a trace, and the coyotes never left so much 
as a brief note. 
</P>
<P>
The other theory, that the animals were killed while trying to keep warm in car 
engines, was, to say the least, creative.

TIGHTENING BORDER TO STOP ILLEGAL ALIENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an article about the federal Immigration and Naturalization Service's sweep 
(Orange County section, March 9), Amin David of the Los Amigos group said the 
INS exaggerates complaints about day workers who loiter all over Chapman 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
I live by Chapman, and I assure you these problems are not exaggerated. May I 
remind you the INS picked up 156 men who are in our country illegally. Our 
country cannot solve all the problems of the Third World. Our tax dollars 
should go to our own U.S. citizens. These men are illegally in our country, and 
then they wait around for jobs where they will be paid under the table where no 
tax dollars will be paid. 
</P>
<P>
I am so tired of these men urinating in the parking lots, harassing women, 
wandering through my neighborhood, laying all over the bus benches and 
littering. Crime has gone up in areas where these men hang out. I see them 
stealing in the market all the time. 
</P>
<P>
People are fooling themselves if they don't think our country has a serious 
problem with this huge influx of illegals. This is an invasion! Money is tight 
with our government, and we can't afford to let this problem get worse. Our 
borders need to be tightened, these people just can't be allowed to swarm into 
our country illegally.

PRO-LIFE, PRO-CHOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to the letter from Ruth Sultzbach on the abortion debate (Orange 
County section, March 12), I must agree with her claim that pro-lifers are 
anti-choice. Anti-choice out of necessity, to give the unborn a chance to make 
future choices and decisions in their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
If Sultzbach is intellectually honest and really wants to "get our terms 
straight," then she must realize that pro-choice compels a no-choice on the 
life in the unborn. 
</P>
<P>
In her letter, Ruth Sultzbach complains of the "cruel harassment of each woman 
entering the clinic." So be it. The "cruel harassment" of the women pales in 
comparison to the flesh-tearing treatment of the never-to-be-born baby 
resulting from "pro-choicers' " actions. 
</P>
<P>
Sultzbach argues that pro-lifers seek to destroy the abortion-seeking woman's 
right to life, and her right to liberty and the pursuit of happiness." What 
pro-choice proponents fail to realize, or naively try to ignore, is the cause 
and effect of decisions and actions. 
</P>
<P>
In short, the decisions and actions taken resulted in the creation of life. 
Taking that life, regardless of how it is packaged, is killing. 
</P>
<P>
Back to Sultzbach's original argument: Yes, let's "get our terms straight." 
Pro-choicers are pro-killers.

SEN. ROBERTI'S BILL TO BAN ASSAULT RIFLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AK-47s and other assault rifles ought to be banned whether automatic or 
semi-automatic. What possible justification is there for a person to possess 
this kind of firepower? 
</P>
<P>
Our country is an embarrassment to the world in one regard. We are a much too 
violent country and have an incredible murder rate. 
</P>
<P>
Let's support gun control locally, statewide and, most importantly if we want 
to be effective, federally. We need to support our police, who are presently 
outgunned by the criminals. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. David A. Roberti's bill is a start. It has passed the Senate, and 
now a weaker version of the Los Angeles Democrat's bill is making its way 
through the Assembly. Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) has been 
identified as a possible swing vote. 
</P>
<P>
I call on all in the 70th Assembly District to let Assemblyman Ferguson know 
that we want the stricter Roberti bill. Gov. George Deukmejian has indicated, 
in a qualified way, that he would sign the anti-assault rifle bill. We should 
all encourage him to do so.

TRANSPORTATION AND COUNTY TAXPAYERS

<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the possible consolidation of the transportation agencies of Orange 
County: I don't think consolidation is good for the transit riders and 
taxpayers of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know how it will affect the handicapped. I don't know how it will 
affect bus fares. County Supervisor Roger R. Stanton wants the handicapped and 
senior citizens to have free Dial-A-Ride and no van services for the general 
public. 
</P>
<P>
If van service is free for the handicapped and senior citizens, how much will 
bus service fares be? Somehow the agency will have to make up the lost revenue. 
The only way to make up the lost revenue is to raise the bus fares over $1 and 
charge for the transfers. 
</P>
<P>
I think that state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) and Assemblyman Gil 
Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) should ask the Orange County Transportation 
Commission and Supervisor Stanton how much consolidation will cost the citizens 
of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Transit riders and the taxpayers of Orange County should know how much the bus 
fares will be after consolidation, if it happens. 
</P>
<P>
I think that all citizens of Orange County should know all the language in the 
consolidation bill. The consolidation can be very costly to the taxpayers and 
the transit riders of Orange County.

NEUTERING PETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like death and taxes, it's a certainty! Only a few more months and our Orange 
County Animal Shelter will be inundated with unwanted puppies and kittens -- 
sweet, tiny furry creatures whose only crime was being born. 
</P>
<P>
As one who used to work at the shelter, I still carry the sorrowful memory of 
looking out the upstairs windows to see the throngs of pet owners waiting in 
line for the gates to open -- waiting for the county to take on the 
responsibility of their "throwaways." 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of this letter is to remind citizens that now is the time to have 
their pets spayed and neutered. Most folks aren't intentionally cruel or 
thoughtless -- they just never "get around to it." The "it" in this instance is 
such a simple solution: no food or water for the pet after midnight; a morning 
drop-off at the vet; an evening pickup; a quiet night at home and voila!, a 
happy, healthy pet and the knowledge that you have been a responsible pet owner 
who will never, never have to think about all the little babies who would 
otherwise have to be put to sleep. . . . No! Let's use the correct terminology 
-- murdered. 
</P>
<P>
Cost can no longer be an excuse when many animal organizations are there to 
help, financially and otherwise, the Animal Assistance League for one. 
Referrals to low-cost vets, and even half-price certificates, are available. No 
transportation? There are volunteers in this county who will work with you on 
this. 
</P>
<P>
No, good people, there are no acceptable "excuses." The time is now! Please 
make your phone calls. Volunteers are waiting to help.

PAPER AIRPLANES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the Dark Ages, students at the precious few universities that existed in 
feudal Europe were offered seven subjects, divided into two groups: the 
trivium, which consisted of grammar, logic and rhetoric; and the quadrivium -- 
arithmetic, astronomy, geometry and music. 
</P>
<P>
How ill-prepared students so instructed would be if they lived today and had to 
compete with students at UC Irvine and their superior modern education (Feb. 
22)! 
</P>
<P>
Evidently something can be learned by making a paper airplane that can soar for 
10.59 seconds. But can't it be learned before college? Is an expensive American 
liberal arts education to be credited for getting that extra 0.59 seconds of 
"flight?" 
</P>
<P>
Oh well. I'm sure today's students are glad they're not living in the Dark 
Ages. Who could handle 4 years of both logic and rhetoric without making at 
least one paper airplane?

EDWIN JANSS JR. LEAPS TO HIS DEATH IN SUICIDE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Edwin Janss Jr., a member of a family that developed thousands of acres of 
Southern California and a collector of pop art who ended up on President 
Richard Nixon's "enemies list" for protesting the Vietnam War, jumped to his 
death last week. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
Janss' youngest son, Larry, said in an interview Saturday that he believes his 
father took his life Thursday because he was frustrated with his failing 
health, which had deteriorated since he suffered a stroke about 10 days 
earlier. He leaped from the 12th story of a Santa Monica building, apparently 
after visiting a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced he planned every step" of his suicide, said Larry Janss, 38. 
"This was not a spontaneous act of a disturbed old man." 
</P>
<P>
Edwin Janns Jr., who was known for his love of horses and underwater 
photography, was chairman of Janss Investment Corp. for about three decades. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Generations of Developers 
</P>
<P>
Through four generations -- from Dr. Peter Janss, who came to Los Angeles in 
1893, to his great-grandson Dr. William Janss Jr. -- the Jansses have played a 
historic role in residential and commercial development throughout the region. 
Through the Janss Investment Corp., the family of doctors developed about 
90,000 acres of Southern California property, including Westwood, Thousand 
Oaks, Boyle Heights, Monterey Park, Yorba Linda and Van Nuys, as well as two 
ski resorts -- Snowmass in Aspen, Colo., and Sun Valley in Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1920s, the family set the stage for the development of Westwood by 
donating hundreds of acres for the establishment of UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
The conversion of 10,000 acres of hills and grassland in Ventura County into 
Thousand Oaks housing was among the last major Janss family developments. A 
breakup of the family holdings and a dwindling interest in development among 
younger family members has all but ended a family dynasty that built housing 
for more than 65,000 people in its first 10 years in business. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview two years ago, Edwin Jr. said he was more interested in raising 
thoroughbred horses than in development when his father, Edwin Sr., handed over 
control of the business to him in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
Edwin had spent the previous 20 years raising horses on the family's Conejo 
Ranch. At one time he had 300 horses in his stable and 25 horses training at 
the Santa Anita race track. 
</P>
<P>
"I ended up converting a harness shop into our office," Edwin Jr. told a Times 
reporter. "I made my dad so nervous -- he was constantly looking over my 
shoulder -- that he died of a heart attack four years later." 
</P>
<P>
After he began building four houses for his employees on Thousand Oaks 
Boulevard in 1955, passers-by started asking the price for a new home. At the 
time, there were still fewer than 2,500 people living in the area. 
</P>
<P>
After nearly 100 people inquired about new houses, Janss purchased 96 acres for 
the Conejo Oaks housing development and before the tract's three model homes 
were finished, all 98 lots in the development were sold, Janss said. 
</P>
<P>
Within the next 25 years, Janss Investment Corp., with Edwin Jr. at its head, 
became involved in the development of about 20% of the land in Thousand Oaks. 
As demand for housing grew, Janss hired sales and finance experts to oversee 
the day-to-day development of the properties that eventually included the 
city's first industrial park, the Janss Mall and The Oaks shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
But according to Larry Janss, Edwin Jr.'s life was hardly limited to the family 
business. Larry Janss said that his father had no great interest in politics 
until the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
"The Vietnam war politicized him and radicalized him," he said. Larry said his 
father was a member of a business group that protested the war and also 
contributed to liberal causes, including the Institute of Policy Studies, a 
Washington-based think tank. Later, in what he would call his "greatest honor 
ever," Edwin Jr. was included in Nixon's "enemies list." 
</P>
<P>
"He was actually proud of it," Larry Janss said. "He laughed about it at 
parties." 
</P>
<P>
Edwin Jr., who left the development business about five years ago, was also an 
art enthusiast who put together a discriminating collection of contemporary art 
-- including works by Frank Stella and Andy Warhol -- in his simple West Los 
Angeles home. 
</P>
<P>
But according to his son, Edwin Jr.'s greatest enjoyment was underwater 
photography. Larry Janss believes that part of the reason his father took his 
life may have been because his recent stroke had severely impaired his vision 
and hearing and left him physically unable to continue diving. 
</P>
<P>
Edwin Jr. was most interested in photographing a tiny underwater sea slug 
called the nudibranch, which is found in the waters off Micronesia. "He was 
most satisfied when he was under water photographing these teeny, tiny snails," 
Larry Janss said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides his wife Ann, he is survived by a daughter, Dagny Corcoran of West Los 
Angeles, his two sons Peter, of Idaho, and Larry. Larry Janss said his father's 
body will be cremated and his ashes scattered over the ocean this week.

TURMOIL PLAGUES WEALTHY KECK FAMILY;

WHODUNIT REVEALS PROBLEMS OF THE RICH AND FEUDING

<P>
Libby Keck was distraught as she stood in the conservatory of her $42-million, 
treasure-filled Bel-Air mansion. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at that!" she shrieked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, ma'am," her bodyguard and chauffeur, Roger Paine, replied hesitantly. 
</P>
<P>
Sensing his uncertainty, Keck led him by the hand to a painting and ran his 
fingers across its surface. 
</P>
<P>
It was as smooth as glass. Paine knew right away that it was no Impressionistic 
oil painting but a high-quality color photograph. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, hell! Somebody has stolen this painting," he concluded. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it! I know it!" said Keck, her hands still shaking. "It's gone!" 
</P>
<P>
On that afternoon in August, 1987, which was later relived by the two in Los 
Angeles Superior Court, it hardly seemed likely that Keck had touched off a 
scandal that would titillate the world of fine arts from Los Angeles to the 
Louvre. The painting's disappearance led to the prosecution of the Keck family 
butler on a grand theft charge last year. 
</P>
<P>
But a jury refused to believe the butler did it, and what ensued is a whodunit 
that also has raised questions about the veracity of Elizabeth Avery Keck, 
matriarch of one of America's leading philanthropic families. 
</P>
<P>
The painting's disappearance also flung open the curtains on the war among the 
Kecks, heirs to an immense oil fortune, as they hurled charges and 
countercharges of betrayal, theft, family jealousies, illegitimacy and, behind 
it all, pure greed. 
</P>
<P>
Court battles in the internecine combat have already cost members of the Keck 
family well over $12 million in legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
It all began when Howard and Libby Keck's oldest child, Howard B. Keck Jr., or 
"Little Howard," filed a "friendly" lawsuit in 1983 to clarify inheritance 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
At stake were hundreds of millions of dollars as well as the world-renowned 
collection of priceless French objets d'art that fill La Lanterne, the 
11,000-square-foot Stone Canyon mansion that Libby Keck, a lifelong 
Francophile, designed and named after a pavilion in the park at Versailles. 
</P>
<P>
But the trust litigation quickly degenerated into no-holds-barred warfare among 
the Keck family members that left lawsuits strewn from Los Angeles to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
The acrimony also led to a messy divorce between the Kecks in which "Big 
Howard" questioned the paternity of "Little Howard." 
</P>
<P>
Libby Keck said her husband at one point even threatened to "go out and have 
more children" and maybe adopt the entire Marlborough School for girls to 
dilute the inheritance of the next generation of Kecks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Torn Family to Shreds' 
</P>
<P>
"This thing has really torn our family absolutely to shreds," Libby Keck said 
with a sigh of resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Other Keck family members refused to be interviewed. Especially adamant in 
refusing to comment was Howard Keck Sr., even though his lawyer was advised 
that many of his kin, including his ex-wife, had ugly things to say about him. 
Even Libby Keck, who sat for two interviews in her lawyer's office, abruptly 
withdrew, terminating all contact. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's afraid to talk. Even the little children are afraid," she rued. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, Libby Keck has remained an active if stoic player in the local 
art and museum scene, serving on the boards of the County Museum of Art, the 
Museum of Contemporary Art, the Huntington Museum and the Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
Board members say her personal problems have not come up. "We've never 
discussed Mrs. Keck's situation. She has been a very satisfactory trustee," 
said Los Angeles attorney Frederick M. Nicholas, chairman of the Museum of 
Contemporary Art board. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the art world, sports fans, too, might recognize the Keck name. She 
owns Ferdinand, the thoroughbred that won the Kentucky Derby in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Libby Keck is best known as a world-class collector who has assembled a 
museum-quality treasure of French tapestries, paintings and exquisite 
furnishings once owned by the likes of Louis XIV, Marie Antoinette and 
Napoleon. 
</P>
<P>
In happier days, La Lanterne, a walled estate on Bellagio Road, was a regular 
stop for curators from Europe's finest museums, many of whom had competed with 
Libby Keck for those precious objects. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Keck Sr., 73, sponsored cars that won the Indy 500 in 1953 and 1954. He 
retired as chairman of Superior Oil Co. in 1984 after it was purchased by Mobil 
for $5.7 billion, a sale triggered by a dispute with his late sister, 
Willametta. 
</P>
<P>
The Keck family fortune can be traced to William M. Keck Sr., a one-time candy 
and sandwich salesman on the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oil Firm Is Born 
</P>
<P>
Early this century, he went into the oil business as a roustabout in 
Pennsylvania. Eventually, he made his way to California and, as a speculator, 
drilled wells on contract for big oil companies, often taking leases as payment 
instead of cash. 
</P>
<P>
By 1921, Keck had accumulated enough leases to start his own firm, Superior Oil 
Co. Within a decade, it had wells in Texas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Louisiana and 
Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
Keck died in 1964, leaving most of his estate to his three surviving children 
through the $640-million William M. Keck Foundation, one of California's 
largest private grant-making foundations. He also left five beneficiary trusts 
set up at USC, Stanford, Pomona College, Occidental College and the Church of 
Our Savior in San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
As the family became increasingly mired in litigation, some feared the 
hostilities would adversely affect the foundation's charitable giving, which 
over the years has totaled tens of millions of dollars to museums, schools, 
churches and community programs throughout the country. But those concerns have 
been allayed. 
</P>
<P>
The family trusts came into being in 1978 after a 14-year probate over Keck's 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
His children never got along well, according to some of the Kecks. Initially, 
William M. Keck Jr. was installed as Superior's chief executive officer. But 
Howard B. Keck Sr., or "Big Howard," eventually wrested control of the company 
away from his brother. 
</P>
<P>
"The reasons they didn't get along go back to childhood," explained Libby Keck. 
Their father baited the brothers and encouraged the rivalry, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Such intense competition, Libby Keck said, later also poisoned Big Howard's 
relationship with his own son, Little Howard. It was as if her husband had 
transferred that sibling rivalry from his brother to his son, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Willametta Keck, Howard's sister, was seriously ill in Santa Barbara when 
Howard dispatched emissaries who urged her to grant him sole control of the 
trusts set up by their father. She refused, calling her brother a "dumb son of 
a bitch" in the Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
Their dispute prompted Willametta, who died shortly afterward, to start a 
successful proxy fight against her brother, which triggered the 1984 sale of 
Superior to Mobil Corp. for $5.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
It was after that sale that Little Howard filed his lawsuit to clarify the 
complex inheritance issues involving the family trusts. 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents, income from the trusts was to be distributed to 
the grandchildren of the patriarch, William Sr. And the trusts themselves were 
to terminate with the death of his last surviving child with all assets to be 
divided among the living descendants. Big Howard now is the sole surviving 
child of William Sr. 
</P>
<P>
But Little Howard's "friendly" lawsuit proved anything but amicable. 
</P>
<P>
In and out of court, Big Howard and Little Howard became increasingly hostile 
toward one another. At one point, Libby Keck said, Big Howard vowed to bring 
his son "to his knees." 
</P>
<P>
Such enmity hardly surprised her. 
</P>
<P>
Libby Keck said her son always "idolized his father. He killed himself to be 
everything his father wanted him to be." But it was never enough. His father 
wanted him to become a geologist; instead, he studied economics and finance at 
USC and Pepperdine. Later, Big Howard sent his son to northern Canada and then 
to Africa -- assignments that scared her son "to death," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Just a Prelude' 
</P>
<P>
"He (Big Howard) sent him as far away as he could. He didn't want the threat of 
a son or an heir-apparent around," she said. "So we always fought over that. 
But I never dreamed for an instant that it would blow up in the end the way it 
did. All that was just a prelude." 
</P>
<P>
As the father-son lawsuit progressed, the Keck daughters began taking sides. 
One of them, Kerry C. Vaughn, joined Little Howard's lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
But the other daughter, Erin Anner Lower, and stepdaughter Francesca Elizabeth 
Drown joined Big Howard, alleging that Little Howard is not the biological 
child of Big Howard -- "based on recently discovered evidence." But according 
to Sorrell Trope, Libby Keck's divorce lawyer, that issue has been laid to rest 
through genetic analysis. 
</P>
<P>
Married for more than 38 years, the estranged Kecks continue to live -- 
separately, rarely speaking to each other -- in their Bel-Air mansion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gag Order 
</P>
<P>
Until 1988, little was known about the deepening Keck family misery because 
much of the litigation was inaccessible to the public. Throughout the trust 
litigation, a Texas judicial gag order prevailed. And even though the 
litigation has been settled out of court, most of the documents remain sealed 
and its participants have signed a confidentiality agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the Kecks' divorce proceedings in Los Angeles Superior Court have 
been sealed at their mutual request. 
</P>
<P>
But all that secrecy began to crack in August, 1987, after Libby Keck 
instructed Paine, her bodyguard-chauffeur, to summon Los Angeles Police 
Department detectives to investigate the disappearance of a painting in La 
Lanterne's conservatory. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out that the century-old painting, "I Fria Luften," (In Free Air) a 
nude of a mother and child by Swedish master Anders Zorn, had fetched nearly 
$500,000 at a Swedish auction that spring. 
</P>
<P>
It is not disputed that the Kecks' then-butler, Roy Donell, had received the 
proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
Charged with grand larceny, Donell proclaimed his innocence before a Los 
Angeles Superior Court jury, saying he had acted at Libby Keck's behest because 
she needed money to pay her lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Black Lies' 
</P>
<P>
Donell said he turned over the proceeds to her, minus his 20% commission, in 
installments in white envelopes on her breakfast trays under a napkin. A 
second, minor painting was also allegedly stolen by Donell. 
</P>
<P>
Libby Keck took the witness stand and called Donell's assertions "black lies." 
</P>
<P>
But after a monthlong trial last summer, the jury exonerated Donell. In the 
meantime, the Kecks were paid off by their insurance company, minus a $50,000 
deductible. 
</P>
<P>
It was this criminal trial -- attended by numerous lawyers representing the 
conflicting interests of the many Kecks -- that served to part the curtains on 
the Kecks' private affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Denouncing Donell's claims, the elegantly dressed Libby Keck told the jury: 
"The suggestion that I would conspire with my butler to sell these paintings 
for a sum of money which is but a small fraction of 1 month's income of myself 
and my husband is ludicrous." 
</P>
<P>
She said she never had any financial worries, noting that she had sole control 
of an $11-million account. "I could have written a check for the whole amount," 
she testified. 
</P>
<P>
A document from the divorce proceedings, produced at Donell's trial, showed 
that she also had a monthly allowance of $5,000 for groceries, $3,300 for 
dinners, $1,200 for lunches, $10,000 for dinner parties and $25,000 for 
clothing and other accessories. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Husband Takes Stand 
</P>
<P>
During final arguments in Donell's criminal trial, Donald Randolph, the 
butler's defense attorney, told the jury that it would come down to Libby 
Keck's word against his client's. "She says X, and he says Y." 
</P>
<P>
It did not help Libby Keck when her husband took the witness stand and told the 
jury that she was not one to be trusted. "I don't think she is a truthful 
person," he testified. 
</P>
<P>
After acquitting Donell, jury foreman Joel Nenzell said the jurors did not 
necessarily believe Donell was innocent -- only that his story seemed more 
believable than Libby Keck's. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his acquittal, Donell is not out of the woods. 
</P>
<P>
Libby Keck has sued him in civil court for theft, slander, invasion of privacy 
and infliction of emotional distress, demanding $31 million. The former butler, 
who earned $25,000 a year, has been representing himself during the pretrial 
machinations. 
</P>
<P>
Libby Keck said she filed the suit to clear her name. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the truth out. I don't want to live with the lies that have been cast 
upon me by the bludgeonings of fate," she said.

KATELLA FALLS FAR SHORT IN FINAL

<P>
It didn't take long for Joni Easterly of Katella High School to come up with 
the reasons why the Knights lost, 59-43, to Sacramento Grant in the State 
Division II girls' championship game Saturday at the Oakland Coliseum Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"We could have run our press break better," said Easterly. "We could have made 
some layups and blocked out a lot better on the boards." 
</P>
<P>
And that was just for starters. 
</P>
<P>
Grant outplayed Katella in virtually every category to win its second 
consecutive Division II title. Grant was making its fifth state championship 
game appearance in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacers finished the season with a 32-3 record. Katella, playing in its 
first state final, ended its season 29-4. 
</P>
<P>
"We can play better," Easterly, a guard, said. "That's what hurts. We 
definitely could have given them a better game." 
</P>
<P>
Easterly certainly did her part, scoring a game-high 22 points and grabbing a 
team-high seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
She played so hard that several times late in the game she was doubled over, 
gasping for breath during stops in play. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Harker, a forward, and Angie Gomez, a guard, added eight and seven 
points, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't enough to contend with a balanced, relentless Grant team. 
</P>
<P>
Tina Green was one of four Grant players who scored in double figures. Green, a 
senior forward, had 19 points and 11 rebounds. Shawyna Robertson had 15, 
Kimyatta Horton 12 and Tesia Green 10. 
</P>
<P>
"They were the quickest, best-shooting team we've faced," Katella Coach Barb 
Bausch said. "We can't hold our heads down. We got beat by the best team I've 
seen this season. We did everything we could do, I thought." 
</P>
<P>
After a slow start -- Grant trailed, 16-12, at the end of the first quarter -- 
the Pacers jump-started their game. 
</P>
<P>
Tina Green and Robertson led Grant's second-quarter spurt that effectively 
broke Katella's momentum. The Pacers outscored the Knights, 14-7, to take a 
26-23 lead. 
</P>
<P>
After three straight baskets by Robertson to open the third quarter, Grant led, 
32-23, and the game seemed to be firmly in the Pacers' control. 
</P>
<P>
Katella made a couple of charges to get close, but Grant pulled away each time. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights' best streak got them within four late in the third quarter. A 
three-pointer and a fast break layup by Gomez cut Grant's lead to 34-30. 
</P>
<P>
But Tina Green scored on a follow shot and hit a jumper to push the lead back 
to 38-30. 
</P>
<P>
Grant then outscored Katella, 14-4, in the first four minutes of the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Easterly fouled out with three minutes left, but it made little difference at 
that point. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't board," Bausch said. "(And) what do you do when you can't score for 
five minutes straight? (The Knights went scoreless for 5:51 in the second 
quarter.) You can't have those breakdowns." 
</P>
<P>
Everything seemed to go as planned for Grant, particularly after the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Rebounding and holding Easterly to her average of 22 points per game were key 
factors, said Grant Coach Connie Zuercher. 
</P>
<P>
"If we stopped her from scoring 30 points and outrebounded them, I thought we 
would win," said Zuercher. 
</P>
<P>
Grant outrebounded Katella by a 48-25 margin. 
</P>
<P>
Even more telling was the fact that the Knights got just four offensive 
rebounds. Grant had 22 and that contributed greatly to its victory. Many of its 
points came on second- and third-shot opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to screen off as best we could and we didn't do it from what I saw," 
Bausch said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Zuercher: "We worked in practice on allowing them one shot and that's it." 
</P>
<P>
Zuercher coached her final game Saturday. She is retiring to spend more time 
with her newborn son, Max, and pursue a master's degree.

SWANWICK CAN'T DO IT ALL BY HIMSELF; TRABUCO HILLS FALLS 
</P>

<P>
Center Rick Swanwick carried Trabuco Hills High School through a banner season 
that ended Saturday with the State Division III boys' championship basketball 
game in the Oakland Coliseum Arena. 
</P>
<P>
But with the game and a state title on the line, the 6-foot-10, 220-pound 
senior finally collapsed under the weight and ended up lying on the floor after 
the final buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
Swanwick had missed one of two free throws with two seconds remaining in 
Central Valley's 62-61 upset victory that gave the school -- located 10 miles 
north of Redding -- its first state title. 
</P>
<P>
Swanwick scored all 25 of Trabuco Hills' points in the second half, but he also 
will be remembered for missing the free throw that would have sent the game 
into overtime. He finished with 33 points and 16 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care about the points, I just wanted to win," he said. "When I made 
the first one, I was praying I would make the second one, and I missed. I 
relaxed a little after the first one, but not much." 
</P>
<P>
Swanwick was up-tight at the foul line most of the game, making seven of 16 
free throws. He missed the front ends of two one-and-one attempts in the final 
1:17, but his coach, Rainer Wulf, wouldn't blame the loss on the big guy. 
</P>
<P>
"People look at these games and look at the end and figure that's how we lost," 
Wulf said. "This game wasn't lost in the last two seconds. We lost when we 
turned the ball over and missed shots that we had made all season." 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills (25-7) committed 13 turnovers and made 24 of 53 field-goal 
attempts, but the latter statistic is deceiving because Swanwick was 13 of 20 
from the field and his supporting cast was 11 of 33. Trabuco's players, other 
than Swanwick, took only four shots from the foul line, making two of them. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, Trabuco Hills made only four of 12 three-point shots and didn't 
connect on a three-pointer in the second half. Guard Randy Kriech (16 points) 
was the only other effective scorer for the Mustangs. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Trabuco Hills had the lead, 60-58, with 2:40 remaining after Swanwick 
had scored following his missed free throw. The Mustangs had rallied from a 
57-50 deficit early in the fourth quarter, and it appeared another comeback 
similar to the one that carried them to a 60-57 victory over Morningside in the 
Southern California Regional championship was in the making. 
</P>
<P>
Central Valley (24-5) tied the score, 60-60, with 2:19 remaining when guard 
Chris Friebel drove the lane for a short jump shot. The teams went scoreless 
for a little more than two minutes before forward Ron Golden made two free 
throws with 15 seconds remaining to push the Falcons ahead, 62-60. 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills, however, wasn't finished. Kriech missed a 16-foot jumper with 
eight seconds remaining, but Swanwick grabbed the rebound, whirled and fired a 
short shot that just missed with two seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Swanwick was fouled on the play, and Central Valley called a timeout to give 
him some time to think about his two free throws. Swanwick swished his first 
attempt and felt good about his second shot. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was going in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the ball hit the heel of the rim and caromed out of bounds to give 
Central Valley, an at-large entry into the Northern California Regionals, the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
Central Valley actually beat Trabuco Hills at its own game -- the three-point 
shot. The Falcons made six of 11 attempts from beyond the 19-foot 9-inch line, 
including two by guard Pete Roach in the third quarter when they outscored 
Trabuco Hills, 19-13. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Matthews, a 6-4 center, provided most of the offense for Central Valley 
in the first half, scoring 18 of his 20 points. Friebel added 12 points, 9 of 
them coming on three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Wulf fought hard to hold back the tears as he met with reporters 
outside Trabuco Hills' locker room. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the toughest loss I've ever been associated with," he said. "When you 
consider the blood and sweat these guys gave, and then to lose the state 
championship by one point, that's pretty tough to take."

BREWER SPENDS MILLIONS TO PROMOTE 'RESPONSIBLE-DRINKING' PROGRAMS

<P>
Spring break has arrived and college kids are rolling out the barrels. 
</P>
<P>
But Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc., parent of the world's largest brewery, is urging 
restraint. The company spends millions of dollars each year promoting what it 
calls "responsible-drinking" programs. 
</P>
<P>
Some are considered particularly relevant at this time of the year, when 
students descend upon resort cities from Miami to Palm Springs and indulge in 
brew-guzzling marathons that aren't particularly welcomed by the locals. 
</P>
<P>
Entertainer Sonny Bono, mayor of Palm Springs for the past 10 months, said his 
city's residents have long tried to curb the level of alcohol consumption 
during spring break. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of the events are cruising and drinking and getting out of hand," 
Bono said. "For the locals, it's a time we dread." 
</P>
<P>
Enter Anheuser-Busch, which tries to get its message across before the students 
hit town. On campuses across the country, college newspapers advertise "Pit 
Stops" where students en route to spring break destinations can pull over and 
get a doughnut and a cup of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
"Here it's someone selling alcohol and saying, 'Don't abuse it and don't get 
carried away,' " Bono said. "I like it." 
</P>
<P>
The St. Louis-based brewing giant says it is committed to keeping customers 
from over-indulging. The number of responsible-drinking programs sponsored by 
the company nearly equals the number of its brands. 
</P>
<P>
Choices include: Budweiser, Bud Light, Busch, Natural Light, L.A., Michelob and 
Michelob Dry. To keep thirsty drinkers in line, the company offers programs 
such as the "Your Alcohol IQ" videotape, Know When to Say When, The Buddy 
System, Good Sport, T.I.P.S., I'm Driving, and Alert Cab. 
</P>
<P>
Anheuser-Busch sold 78.5 million barrels of beer last year, 41.1% of the total 
brewing industry sales nationwide. But for more than a decade, the brewery 
hasn't been content to simply sell beer in record quantities. 
</P>
<P>
According to a recent Fortune Magazine survey, Anheuser-Busch ranks first among 
beverage companies in responsibility to the community and environment. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if social conscience is the right word," said Stephen K. 
Lambright, vice president and group executive at Anheuser-Busch, who oversees 
the company's responsible-drinking programs. "It's a social commitment. We hope 
to be part of the solution. Hopefully, what we're doing is something that's 
more than just a PR piece." 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, Anheuser-Busch's sobriety theme in the spring break pilgrimage 
south by winter-weary college kids might have the unwanted side effect of 
forfeiting part of this lucrative market. But it appears far more successful 
than the sophomoric partying theme by rival Miller Brewing Co. 
</P>
<P>
Miller recently scrapped what it now concedes was a poor-taste ad campaign for 
spring-break getaways after college students complained it was sexist and they 
threatened to boycott Miller products. The brewer's supplements in college 
newspapers last month featured pictures of bikini-clad women clutching Miller 
bottles and tips for men on "sure-fire ways to scam babes." 
</P>
<P>
Anheuser-Busch doesn't have anything as easy as a barrel count to determine the 
success of its responsible drinking program. Lambright, however, pointed out 
that the number of underage beer drinkers and fatalities in alcohol-related 
accidents both have decreased in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly don't have all of the answers, but the statistics are all moving 
in the right direction," Lambright said. "The system is getting better." 
</P>
<P>
Among the company's programs, and advertisements touting them: 
</P>
<P>
At sports events, messages from professional athletes are beamed on the big 
screen, and billboards remind the fans to be a "Good Sport" and not 
over-indulge. 
</P>
<P>
At local video stores, L.A. Law stars Jill Eikenberry and Michael Tucker are 
featured in the brewery's newest program, "Your Alcohol IQ." Anheuser-Busch 
distributed 25,000 free copies to video outlets nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
And who hasn't seen Spuds MacKenzie and the Spudettes advising television 
watchers to moderate their alcohol intake? 
</P>
<P>
The concept of a beer company advising restraint in the consumption of its 
products isn't all that new anymore. Anheuser-Busch says its first programs 
began in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
But the brewery didn't go high-profile until 1985, when its first advertisement 
for responsible drinking aired. Role models such as sports stars Steve Garvey 
and Patrick Ewing were hired to tell the public to "Know When to Say When," a 
program that provides guidelines for bartenders, waiters and waitresses. 
</P>
<P>
"They weren't beer commercials by any means," Lambright said. "Prior to that, 
most of what you saw were third-party efforts in the public-service 
announcement mode as opposed to a company actually paying for regular price 
commercial time to run a non-beer commercial responsibility piece." 
</P>
<P>
Collectively, Anheuser-Busch's strategy for fighting alcohol abuse is 
"Operation ALERT," an acronym for Action and Leadership through Education, 
Responsibility and Training. The array of programs designed as aids for the 
estimated 80 million beer drinkers in the United States runs the gamut. 
</P>
<P>
There's T.I.P.S., which stands for Training for Intervention Procedures by 
Servers of Alcohol, an instruction manual to teach retailers how to recognize 
and avoid troublesome situations involving alcohol. And Good Sport, a campaign 
aimed at combatting rowdyism in stadiums and arenas. 
</P>
<P>
The Buddy System is designed for use with college-age audiences. It recommends 
holding parties with a dry last hour, and establishing a network of friends to 
serve as designated drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Alert Cab, a program in 140 cities, provides a free taxicab ride home for 
customers in bars and restaurants who are faced with possible drunk driving 
situations. I'm Driving is another designated-driver program. 
</P>
<P>
Anheuser-Busch also is a major sponsor of SADD, Students Against Drunk Driving, 
and has published pamphlets dealing with the effects of alcohol consumption on 
motorcycle and boating safety.

2 CROPS ARE BEING STUDIED FOR COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A couple of crops with exotic-sounding names may be inching closer to 
commercial production in California. 
</P>
<P>
University of California researchers are reporting progress on guayule, a plant 
that can produce natural rubber, and kenaf, a potential source of newsprint. 
</P>
<P>
Guayule, a desert shrub, was a source of natural rubber early in this century 
before synthetic rubber became popular and again during World War II when 
rubber was scarce. Its use declined after the war, but researchers now are 
trying to see if guayule can become a profitable cash crop again. 
</P>
<P>
One way that might be possible is to adapt guayule so the plant can provide 
more than one harvest a year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Increase Productivity 
</P>
<P>
"To succeed as a commercial crop, guayule must become more productive, and the 
prohibitive cost of . . . transplanting seedlings must be reduced," three 
University of California scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
So they studied the abilities of various sources of guayule to regrow. 
</P>
<P>
"Cultivars (varieties) that can regrow after cutting at ground level are 
expected to make multiple harvest of guayule a reality," the scientists 
reported in California Agriculture, a magazine that describes the university's 
farming research. 
</P>
<P>
In studies at Shafter in the southern San Joaquin Valley, they found that one 
new variety of guayule, C250, "responded favorably to harvest at ground level: 
98.1% of the plants harvested in three consecutive years survived and grew." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps because of this, C250 produced the highest rubber yield of the six 
varieties tested, 830 pounds per acre. 
</P>
<P>
"The finding that some selections respond favorably to harvest at ground level 
and are capable of surviving and regrowing vigorously may influence the way 
guayule is harvested in the future," said the article by Ali Estilai, associate 
research agronomist at UC Davis; Himayat H. Naqvi, associate specialist, and J. 
Giles Waines, botany professor at UC Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Certain Conditions 
</P>
<P>
But they added that either rubber yield from guayule or the current rubber 
price of about $1.10 per kilogram must be increased before the crop can become 
commercially profitable. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers predicted that more productive cultivars will be developed 
within 5 to 10 years through breeding and high biomass-production techniques. 
</P>
<P>
"While the price of natural rubber depends on world supply and demand, as well 
as global politics, increasing the productivity of the plant remains 
biologically feasible," they concluded. 
</P>
<P>
In the same issue of California Agriculture, another UC researcher discussed an 
experiment to determine if kenaf could grow profitably in the arid Imperial 
Valley in the southeastern part of the state. 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper industry officials are studying kenaf as a potentially cheaper source 
of newsprint than trees. Paper from kenaf fiber was used to print 83,000 copies 
of the Bakersfield Californian in an experiment in July, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Most kenaf research has been conducted in Texas, but the crop may be adaptable 
to California because previous work has produced yields of 16 tons per acre in 
the San Joaquin Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Kenaf varieties were planted at the university's Imperial Valley Agricultural 
Center near Holtville between 1983 and 1986 and irrigated with Colorado River 
water. The same varieties also were planted in a fine sand desert area in 1985 
and were irrigated with ground water that contained higher salt concentrations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cut in Yield 
</P>
<P>
"The kenaf varieties grown in the desert with higher salinity irrigation water 
showed a substantial reduction in yield," said the report by Frank E. Robinson, 
a water scientist with the agricultural center. 
</P>
<P>
In fact desert yields ranged from just 11% to 20% of those at the agricultural 
center, indicating "that kenaf is at least moderately sensitive to saline 
irrigation water," Robinson says. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the kenaf grown at the agricultural station produced yields of 9 to 
9.5 tons per acre, which Robinson found encouraging and potentially profitable. 
</P>
<P>
"The upper yield range is approximately 9.5 tons dry weight of stalks per acre 
and may improve with additional work on cultivation practices and genetic 
selection," the report says. "Yields of this magnitude have encouraged the 
construction of a kenaf paper mill in southern Texas."

<P>
The new Home Savings of America Tower dominates the pivotal intersection where 
7th Street and the historic Los Angeles of the 1920s meets the modern 
commercial towers of the 1960s and 1970s, marching down Figueroa Street from 
Bunker Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Seen from the west by motorists coming off the Harbor Freeway, the 24-story 
tower marks the gateway to 7th Street. Seen from the south coming up Figueroa 
Street, it creates an elegant portal to Bunker Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Both the historic and the modern are contained within the 300-foot-hightower. 
The building's marble, stone and precast concrete surface is a stripped-down 
postmodern version of the French Chateau style derived from some of the hotels 
and skyscrapers built in New York City in the early years of this century. 
</P>
<P>
But while the architecture may be traditional, the tower's internal layout 
reflects the present and future character of downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The building rises on the back of a subway station that, when it opens in 1993, 
will serve both Metro Rail and the Long Beach light rail systems. The lower 
five floors hide a parking garage that could not be built under ground because 
of the subway station. 
</P>
<P>
Like all neoclassical architecture, the Home Tower has a base, a middle and a 
pediment, or cap. 
</P>
<P>
Horizontal bands of beige travertine and green marble defined by strips of 
sparkling gold tile sheath on the lower levels. The sixth floor cornice matches 
the cornice of the noble 1925 Fine Arts Building next door on 7th, and wraps 
around to pick up the roof line of the 1912 Firehouse 28 to the north, now 
recycled as a restaurant and office building. 
</P>
<P>
Octagonal bays emphasize the tower's corners. Between the octagons, the office 
windows rise in a series of narrow pilasters capped by a 23rd floor cornice 
line topped by rows of small gables and dormer windows in a copper mansard 
roof. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided the tower needed a vertical thrust, to mark it out from the lower 
historic 7th Street buildings and at the same time create a presence equal to 
the Bunker Hill high-rises to the north," said Tim Vreeland, project architect 
for A.C. Martin and Associates. 
</P>
<P>
Vreeland said that having chosen a vertical emphasis for the tower, the 
Italianate style common to the 1920s downtown architecture had to be abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
"The classic Italian Renaissance or Romanesque Venetian models common in the 
1920s downtown were all horizontal in emphasis," Vreeland explained. "They had 
to be, when the allowed height limit for L.A. buildings was then a mere 150 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
"We went up twice that high, and so we needed to find another mode. My 
background as a New Yorker, and my love of some classic Manhattan buildings 
like the Plaza Hotel, led me to choose the elegantly vertical French Chateau 
manner. For me, it's a style that stands for strength, security and 
sophistication." 
</P>
<P>
The core of the tower's interior is the double-height sixth floor "Sky Lobby," 
where the parking garage ends and the office floors begin. 
</P>
<P>
A cube 30 feet high, wide and long,surrounded by a gallery, the Sky Lobby has 
tall windows overlooking 7th Street and the Italianate 1928 Barker Brothers 
Building across the way. The lobby floor is a pattern of polished red and cream 
marble surrounding a fountain graced by a bronze figurine. The ceiling is a 
juicy panoramic mural by artist Richard Haas that romanticizes the Los Angeles 
Basin in the manner of Baroque muralists conjuring aerial views of Florence or 
Venice. 
</P>
<P>
The Sky Lobby is a splendid space, almost as lush as the golden-tiled jewel-box 
lobby of the neighboring Fine Arts Building. 
</P>
<P>
Following a long Home Savings tradition, colorful murals and painted panels are 
an integral part of the Tower's design. 
</P>
<P>
Glowing Venetian glass murals designed by Joyce Kozloff fill 40-foot-high slots 
over the entrances on Seventh and Figueroa streets. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Schoonhoven will paint the ceiling over the ground floor Metro Rail 
station stairway with a trompe-l'oeil vista of a downtown Los Angeles sky 
filled with high-rises. Other murals by Tony Berlant and Carlos Almaraz 
decorate the Home Savings branch offices that occupy the ground floor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A More Urbane Touch 
</P>
<P>
"The company has a long history of featuring art on its buildings," said 
Jeffrey Gault, Home Savings' director of real estate. "Sometimes this has been 
done with more verve than elegance. . . . The tower is the epitome of that 
popular tradition, done with a more urbane touch, as befits our leading 
landmark." 
</P>
<P>
The pop-kitsch artiness of Home Savings branches -- such as the mural-covered 
Babylonian mausoleum on the corner of Sunset and Vine in Hollywood -- is 
charged with a wonderfully tasteless energy. In the tower, this vulgar energy 
has been groomed into a polite pastiche of local color. 
</P>
<P>
On the ground floor, the blank corner that will lead into the subway stair is 
sealed off from the branch banking halls by ornate etched glass screens 
designed by Patsy Norvell. Heavy wrought-iron "cobra" lamp standards sit on 
stone podiums to light the commuter's way on dark evenings. 
</P>
<P>
The tower's ground-floor plan is confused. The location of the subway station 
below and the spiraling ramps of the parking garage above dictated the 
off-center location of the main elevator bank. 
</P>
<P>
This means that office workers who arrive by rail will have to double back down 
a flight of steps, along a corridor and through a narrow main lobby to get to 
the elevators that travel to the Sky Lobby. Beyond this awkward circulation, 
there lies the deeper question of the designer's choice of the unusual French 
Chateau style -- a style that has no precedent in downtown Los Angeles' 
historic commercial architecture. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Touch Too Sleek 
</P>
<P>
The architecture we inherit that is truly urban is rare. What little there is 
of it is overwhelmingly Italianate or Spanish Renaissance, and that shared 
style is the basis of the unity and visual coherence of streets such as 7th, 
Spring and Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
The few downtown avenues that are urbane cannot easily support the luxury of 
yet another imported style. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the tower is a touch too sleek for its own good. Its smooth 
marble-and-concrete cladding give it the air of a recently plucked chicken. 
Even in its stripped postmodern version, the French Chateau style needs rich 
clothing if it is not to look naked. Manhattan's Plaza Hotel, with its deeply 
incised masonry, elaborately corbelled cornices and frilly gables epitomizes 
the wealth of texture the style demands. 
</P>
<P>
Today the cost of fine craftsmanship in marble and masonry, even if it can be 
found, dictates a much simpler finish than was possible half a century ago. The 
contrast between then and now is pointed up if you compare the blank pilasters 
of the tower with the twisted columns, sculptured corbelling and stonework 
figures that energize the facade of the Fine Arts Building next door. 
</P>
<P>
An architect chooses a style for a building out of a tension set up between his 
aesthetic intuition and an intellectual understanding of the project's 
individual character. The choice not only expresses a stylistic preference, it 
reveals the architect's caliber as a designer and the quality of his heart and 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
The Home Savings Tower reveals that Vreeland's heart was in the right place but 
his head was not. He should have realized that if you cannot fully bring off 
the style you choose, you should rethink your choice. 
</P>
<P>
That said, the Home Savings Tower is one of Los Angeles' most urbane new 
commercial buildings -- a stylish cut above the bland high-rises that deaden 
the skyline of our revitalized downtown.

SALES OF NEW HOMES IN '88 SET FAST PACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK TURPIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sales of new homes throughout the Southland in 1988 continued at an 
unprecedented pace while production expectations for 1989 soared to another 
high. 
</P>
<P>
The 18th annual Times survey of residential construction of a seven-county 
Southern California area reveals high optimism among home builders, who project 
a 29.5% increase in sales during the current year. Actual sales in 1988 
increased 21.2% over 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Builders, although wary of rising interest rates affecting their sales and 
conscious of a possible year-end slowdown, nevertheless expressed confidence in 
offering their firms' projections for 1989 to The Times. (See accompanying 
story.) 
</P>
<P>
The survey showed 1988 to be the fifth consecutive year of housing production, 
topping sales and projection marks established during the hectic period of 
sales and construction in the 1977-81 span, based upon an index devised by The 
Times Marketing Research Department. 
</P>
<P>
Because participation in the survey is voluntary and the number of firms taking 
part varies every year, an index of median sales and projected sales has been 
computed for all participating firms in each of the 18 Times surveys. 
</P>
<P>
By making the 1971 median sales and the 1972 median sales projections (both 
from the first survey) equal to 100.0, the median sales and projections from 
each survey have been compared to this base, creating an index. (See Page 23). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Upward Trend Continues 
</P>
<P>
This allows for an overall trend comparison rather than a dollar comparison, 
which would not be meaningful. The median for actual 1988 sales for the 194 
firms reporting sales was $29.6 million. The median projection for the 190 
firms projecting sales for 1989 was $28.9 million. The indexes show the trends 
from 1971 and 1972. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 sales volume index of 321.7 marks an all-time high as the upward trend 
continues with a 22.7% increase over the previous survey. 
</P>
<P>
The index for 1989 projections is 225.8, which is 7.4% higher than the 210.2 
figure projected for 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But some things didn't change. The William Lyon Co. of Newport Beach and Watt 
Industries of Santa Monica repeated their respective places as leader and 
runner-up among the record 194 companies participating and ranked in 18th 
annual survey. 
</P>
<P>
Lyon reported sales of $655.5 million; its 1987 sales figure was $506.3 
million. The company exceeded its 1988 sales projections of $577 million by 
$78.5 million, building a total of 4,564 units -- 34% of them single-family 
homes, 53.4% apartments and 12.6% condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
Total Southland sales -- in Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Ventura, Riverside, 
San Bernardino and Kern counties -- hit the $11.4-billion mark for the 194 
reporting firms. That was a 21.2% increase over the $9.4 billion figure 
recorded by 177 companies in the 1987 survey. 
</P>
<P>
In major shifts among the builders, Barratt American Inc. of Irvine advanced 
from 19th place in last year's ranking to 8th in the new survey, while Pacific 
Scene Inc. of San Diego dropped from 9th to 62nd place. 
</P>
<P>
Hampton Development of Valencia, ranked 194th (last place), is expecting the 
largest gain in sales this year -- 1,700%. It had only $300,000 in 1988 but has 
set its sights on a $5.4-million goal in 1989. RWR Development Inc. of Van 
Nuys, ranked 124th, is projecting the largest dollar increase, $152 million 
from $17.4 million in 1988 to $169.4 million in 1989, a 873.6% jump in home 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
Seventh-ranked Kaufman &amp; Broad Home Corp. of Los Angeles predicts it will 
have the second largest dollar increase, $150.4 million, from $249.6 million 
last year to $400 million in 1989, up 60.3%. 
</P>
<P>
The Southland builders produced 74,402 housing units last year -- up only 1% 
from the 1987 output of 73,652 units, even though there were 17 more firms 
reporting building activity in the current survey. 
</P>
<P>
Of that output, single-family construction represented the largest number -- 
36,316 -- or 48.8% of the total, up slightly from the 48.1% reported for 1987 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Single-Family Homes 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman &amp; Broad recorded the largest number of single-family homes, 1,833, 
built last year. That figure accounted for 90.5% of the firm's total production 
while third-ranked Lewis Homes Group of Companies of Upland completed 1,580 
single-family homes, 68.7% of its 1988 output. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 190 firms that reported sales for 1988 and projections for 1989, 80% 
(152 companies) forecast an increase in their production, expressing a bit more 
optimism than the 79.5% of the 171 builders who made projections in the 
previous survey. Apartment construction totaled 27,601 units, or 37.1% of all 
building activity during 1988, slightly below the 1987 figure of 38%. The Lyon 
Co. built 2,439 apartment units, topping the field and that figure amounted to 
53.4% of its total output. 
</P>
<P>
Eighty-one developers (41.8%) reported building apartment units last year, 
compared to 73 firms, or 41.2%, in 1987. Among the 81, 27, or 33.3%, 
constructed apartment units exclusively. A total of 74 firms (38.1%) built 
condominiums during 1988. That was a drop from the previous survey's 41.2%. 
There were 10,485 condominium units built, representing 14.1% of all housing 
units built last year. In 1987, the corresponding figures were 10,303 or 14%. 
Griffin Homes of Calabasas, ranked 18th, led all builders in this category, 
producing 746 units, or 51.7% of the total. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 194 firms' plans for this year, 164, or 84.5%, plan some activity in 
single-family homes and 66 companies, or 40.2%, of the builders plan to build 
single-family units only. Seventy-seven, or 47%, will build apartments and of 
those, 19 builders, or 26.7%, will construct apartments only. In the 
condominium category, 82 builders, or 42.3%, plan to build such units and of 
that number, only five, or 6.1%, will build condominiums exclusively. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-one builders, or 16%, plan building activity in all three housing types 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Completed and unsold inventory at the end of the firms accounting periods 
totaled 4,429 units, an increase of 1,022 units from the previous year's survey 
count of 3,407. Well over half, or 62.9% of the 194 companies, reported no 
inventory at the conclusion of their accounting periods. 
</P>
<P>
Calmark Development Corp. of Los Angeles, ranked 27th, had the largest number 
of unsold units, 1,248. Century West Development Inc. of Santa Monica, ranked 
51st, was second, with 740 unsold units. 
</P>
<P>
A marked increase in the production of manufactured housing is expected this 
year, although the total numbers involved are still quite small. Eight 
companies expect to build 1,118 units this year, a jump of 204.6% from the 367 
units forecast for 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 1 ranked Lyon Co., after producing 729 manufactured housing units last 
year, or 70.2% of that total, does not plan to build any such units this year, 
having sold its interest in a manufacturing firm, Golden West. 
</P>
<P>
Eight firms built 1,039 manufactured homes during 1988, representing 4.1% of 
the survey participants. In 1987, four (2.3%) reporting firms produced 2,338 
units. Although the number of firms involved in manufactured housing doubled, 
the total number of units built dropped by more than 50% from 1987-1988. 
</P>
<P>
In the solar-equipped units category, 18 builders, or 9.3% of all firms taking 
part in the survey, plan to construct housing units or pools equipped with 
active solar-energy systems this year. Last year, 10.2% of 177 firms reported 
plans to use solar systems. This year, one firm reported it will use the system 
for pools and spas only. 
</P>
<P>
Pardee Construction Co. of Los Angeles, ranked 15th, anticipates using the 
largest number of solar-equipped units this year, 1,024 divided among 608 
apartments and 416 condominiums. Weinstock Construction Corp. of Studio City, 
ranked 78th, is a close second, with 953 units planned, 53 in single-family 
houses and 900 in apartments. 
</P>
<P>
As has been the case since the beginning of the survey, a number of firms -- 12 
this year -- submitted incomplete information on the single-sheet form and 
could not be ranked. And again this year, many firms failed to meet the 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Participation Rate 
</P>
<P>
The survey revealed that 119 companies participated in both the current and 
17th annual survey, a 61.3% participation rate compared with the 65.5% figure 
between the 16th and 17th surveys. 
</P>
<P>
Of those 119 companies, sales increased for 78 firms, declined for 40 and 
remained the same for one. Sales totaled over $9 billion, up 21.4% from the 
previous year's total of $7.4 billion for companies reporting two consecutive 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The largest percentage increase among firms participating in the consecutive 
surveys was for the Tom Egerer Development Co. of Manhattan Beach, ranked 
142nd, up 475% from $2 million in 1987 to $11.5 million in 1988. Western 
Capital Development Inc. of Los Angeles, ranked 176th, experienced the largest 
percentage decrease, 75.7%, from $14 million in 1987 to $3.4 million in 1988. 
The Lyon firm had the largest dollar increase of $149.2 million for a 29.5% 
increase over 1987. The largest dollar decrease was $153.9 million reported by 
Pacific Scene Inc. a drop of 75.1%. 
</P>
<P>
Among those 119 companies, 117 made projections for 1988. Fifty-one, or 43.6%, 
topped their predictions, 64, or 54.7%, did not and two firms, or 1.7%, exactly 
met their 1988 forecast. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the 119 firms participating in 1987 and 1988 built 55,157 housing 
units, 1.3% fewer than the 1987 total of 55,865 and 54, or 45.4%, of them built 
more units in 1988 than in 1987. Fifty-nine companies (49.6%) built fewer units 
in 1988 than in 1987, while six builders (5%) built the same number. In last 
year's survey, 56% built more units while only 42.2% built less.

KEY TO RESIDENTIAL BUILDERS ROSTER -- The name of each company is followed by 
its headquarters city and then by its principal officer. Sales figures are 
given for 1988 and have been confined to residential sales in Kern, Los 
Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego and Ventura counties. 
Sales projections are for anticipated residential sales in the above-mentioned 
counties for 1989. The number of units constructed in 1988 includes units 
completed for sale during 1988 and is broken out by number and percent of each 
type of unit: single-family homes, apartments and condominiums (including units 
in planned unit developments). Inventory includes any units completed for sale 
that were unsold by the end of the accounting period. NOTES FOR THE 18th ANNUAL 
SURVEY RESIDENTIAL BUILDING Note: Ranking based on rounded sales figures. 
Subtotals may not add to 100% due to computer rounding. Firms with the same 
1988 sales volume are ranked in alphabetical order. * Firm reporting on

BUILDERS CONCERNED ABOUT HIGHER INTEREST AND POSSIBLE RECESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The prospects for higher interest rates, a possible recession and skyrocketing 
land prices were the top concerns of the 194 home builders who took part in The 
Times' 18th annual survey of residential construction in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such concerns, respondents expect to sell 29.2% more homes in 1989 than 
they did last year. Some said the projected increase reflects the huge number 
of housing tracts that were begun in previous years and only now are being 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope that (1989) will still be healthy for us, but we don't foresee another 
year of camp-outs for $500,000 homes as we saw in 1987 and 1988," said Jim 
Oates, co-owner of Whitehawk Partnership, the Pasadena-based builder that 
ranked No. 57 the list. Several builders said they are afraid that higher 
interest rates will dampen home sales this year and next, and a few said a 
recession could hit within a year or so. As a result, many builders are scaling 
back this year's production. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Tom Egerer Development Co. plans to build just 26 new homes this 
year, down from 68 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"My company is going to back off a little in 1989," said Tom Egerer, president 
of the Manhattan Beach-based company that ranked No. 142 on the list. "This 
year might stay strong but 1990 really makes me worry. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had a great five-year run, but I personally feel something bad is 
lurking around the corner." 
</P>
<P>
Egerer's major fear -- and that of most other respondents -- is that interest 
rates will move higher. Rates have been trending upward for several months, and 
many economists and builders say they will keep rising until at least 
midsummer. 
</P>
<P>
Profits of companies that build only single-family homes typically drop sharply 
when interest rates rise or a recession sets in, because either one forces many 
would-be buyers to delay their purchasing plans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diversifying for Protection 
</P>
<P>
Many builders said they're diversifying into apartment and commercial 
construction to reduce their exposure to the highly cyclical business of 
building single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
For example, No. 59, Weston Development Corp. of Los Angeles plans to build 100 
apartment units and about 80,000 square feet of retail space this year in 
addition to 134 for-sale homes. 
</P>
<P>
"When interest rates start going up, the single-family home market usually gets 
hit first," said Bob Jones, Weston's vice president of marketing, in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
"Having residential and commercial income property in our portfolio helps to 
smooth out our cash flow: We will still collect rent payments even if revenue 
for our home sales drop." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Cost of Land 
</P>
<P>
Several builders also complained about the fast-rising prices of buildable 
land. An acre of land in some parts of Orange County now fetches about $1 
million, up from $350,000 to $500,000 a few years ago. Prices are also surging 
in the Inland Empire, an area once popular among builders who had been priced 
out of markets to the west. 
</P>
<P>
Builders said they're coping with higher land costs through a variety of 
methods. Many are building more expensive homes with upgraded features, hoping 
that the higher prices will boost their bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
Others report that they're building more homes on every acre. 
</P>
<P>
"Builders are now working on detached home densities of nine to 12 (units) an 
acre and are working on townhome densities . . . in the 18 to 20 per acre 
range," wrote Randall W. Lewis, executive vice president of No. 3, Lewis Homes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Buyers Are Compromising 
</P>
<P>
Such densities, Lewis said, "were virtually unknown just a few years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Higher home prices have forced many buyers to make compromises, builders said. 
</P>
<P>
Those seeking homes close to their jobs "are being forced to choose 
neighborhoods that they might not have considered desirable just two to three 
years ago, and they are accepting product types such as duplexes, townhomes and 
stacked flats which they also might not have accepted three years ago," Lewis 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Not all buyers had to make such sacrifices. 
</P>
<P>
"1988 marked the return of the investor and, in a few cases, the speculator," 
said Lewis. "We have been surprised at the number of our buyers who were using 
single-family housing as a place to invest instead of the stock market." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said many buyers have been making down payments of 50% or more. "I think 
this shows that people feel their home will probably out-perform any other 
place they can put their money," he said.

AT HOME / GRANADA HILLS: A DOWN-TO-EARTH SUBURBAN LIFE STYLE;

<P>
AN ORIGINAL VALLEY SUBURB, IT HAS LITTLE SMOG, LOTS OF GARDENS, AND '50S 
VINTAGE HOMES

Philip Hall has managed several Ralphs grocery stores in the San Fernando 
Valley and he has noticed something about the shoppers in Granada Hills, where 
he lives: Their hands. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't see a lot of plastic fingernails," Hall said. "You see people who 
work in their yards. Down-to-earth people. The kind of people I like." 
</P>
<P>
One of the original suburbs of the Valley, Granada Hills was built of 
single-family homes and wide thoroughfares, and even now has few apartments and 
condominiums -- also very few specialty restaurants and fashionable stores. 
</P>
<P>
The community's focal point is a dowdy strip of shops on Chatsworth Street, 
around the post office and bowling alley.

"We're pretty much happy to stay around the house," said Hall, 36, who couldn't 
name a restaurant he goes to often. "That's one of the reasons we like Granada 
Hills." 
</P>
<P>
He lives with his wife and two young children in one of the original buildings 
of Sunshine Ranch, the plantation of nearly six square miles from which Granada 
Hills evolved. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Custom Houses 
</P>
<P>
Hall cherishes an old photograph that shows his house in the foreground and 
beyond it, downhill to the south, a grid of trees stretching to the hazy 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
Hall's home site, on Rinaldi Street, is no longer the focal point of Granada 
Hills. Above Rinaldi, new custom houses on one-half to quarter-acre lots range 
part way up Santa Susana Mountain, and below Rinaldi, '50s-vintage tract houses 
are the norm. 
</P>
<P>
A four-bedroom house far up the mountain was listed early this month for 
$440,000; another four-bedroom in a nondescript cul-de-sac below Rinaldi was 
recently appraised at $235,000. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, who moved from his native Burbank in 1982, says he looked at houses below 
Rinaldi that were in far better shape than the one he chose -- the ceiling 
leaks in one corner of his living room -- but he couldn't resist the house's 
charm and location. 
</P>
<P>
The weather, especially, suits his pastime: he has planted a hundred varieties 
of fruit trees -- cherries, apples, plums, citrus and exotic tropicals -- on 
the hillside about his house. His specialty is growing pineapples. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm kind of into my own experimental station for fruits," he said in the 
greenhouse he is building in his back yard. He intends to grow a coconut palm 
through the greenhouse roof. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Orchard Wonderland 
</P>
<P>
As much as ever, Granada Hills is a wonderland for orchards, and the conditions 
that make it so also account for the community's hold on residents. 
</P>
<P>
The mountain, for instance, dun and patchy as a buffalo, raises the community 
above the valley's ambient smog, and through its gaps allows wind from the 
north to blow down with cooling and smog-abating breezes. 
</P>
<P>
"One reason we've had a lot of pilots living out here is that they'd take off 
from LAX and come banking over this area, turning east, and they'd look down 
and see this community with trees and no smog," said Ed Zeier, a realtor and 
former chemist who has lived in Granada Hills since 1960. 
</P>
<P>
Larry McCall, the principal of an elementary school near Hollywood, has lived 
in Granada Hills since 1971 and relishes its farm town values. 
</P>
<P>
"So many of the kids I've seen in Little League will stay in town and enter the 
local businesses. Or I'll go to a ballgame at Kennedy High School and see 30 or 
40 people I've known for years." 
</P>
<P>
McCall bought his house on Odessa Avenue shortly after the Sylmar earthquake of 
1971 had scared the former occupants, New Yorkers, out of the state. They 
abandoned the house to the Veterans Administration and McCall claimed it with a 
bid of $28,000. 
</P>
<P>
Soon he and his children were involved in community sports. Granada Hills 
produced the world champion Little League team in 1963 and has long made use of 
its parks and open spaces -- the land around the Van Norman Reservoir, for 
instance -- as sports centers. 
</P>
<P>
Denver Broncos' quarterback John Elway went to high school here, as almost 
anyone in Granada Hills will tell you. 
</P>
<P>
"What's great about this area," says McCall, "is the community involvement, 
where you feel that everybody knows everybody else -- even if you don't 
really." 
</P>
<P>
Crime rates are lower here than in some parts of the Los Angeles Basin. From 
July 1 through Feb. 28, there were 378 burglaries reported in Granada Hills, 
compared with 546 reported in Hollywood and 702 reported in the Rampart sector. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills is an outdoorsy neighborhood -- its 600-acre O'Melveny Park is 
the second-largest in the city of Los Angeles -- but it is not a neighborhood 
for walking. Its layout is the ordinary drive-to-shop variety. Two minutes by 
car from McCall's house is a Vons, a Builder's Emporium, and -- about as tony 
as this town gets -- a Trader Joe's deli-supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
McCall has noticed more traffic, and Zeier more renters since the Simi Valley 
Freeway, crossing Granada Hills and connecting the western valley to 
Interstates 5 and 405, was opened. 
</P>
<P>
Zeier said that although Granada Hills is nearly surrounded by freeways, the 
interchanges are so pinched that the community is at some hours less accessible 
to downtown Los Angeles than it has ever been. 
</P>
<P>
"The secret of getting into town is not to go," he deadpanned. McCall starts 
work in the morning at 7:30 and beats the traffic going in, but routinely 
drives more than an hour to travel the 25 miles home. 
</P>
<P>
Also, McCall said, his street and the ones nearby have changed. He and his 
neighbors haven't had a block party for seven years now. The couples that 
organized the old annual affairs have divorced or followed their grown children 
to smaller, more distant houses. There are fewer kids about on the street. 
Young families seem less interested in making friends. 
</P>
<P>
Still, "The Most Neighborly Town in the Valley" is Granada Hills' slogan, and 
despite some changes, it continues to apply, Zeier said. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic people out here haven't changed," he said. "Families with kids. 
Quiet streets. A high level of community involvement . . . but not a whole lot 
going on." 
</P>
<P>
Hall likes it that way. 
</P>
<P>
"When I bought that bunkhouse," he said, referring to the property next door, 
which indeed was the bunkhouse for the Sunshine Ranch, "I wanted to rent it to 
down-to-earth people. People who get in the garden, get their hands in the 
dirt. And that's what I did. They weren't really hard to find."

CITYLINES: EMPHASIS ON GARDENS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Pasadena has quietly approved the concept of an imaginative new 
construction ordinance for multifamily housing, placing the design emphasis on 
gardens instead of parking and setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was drafted by Berkeley's Center for Environmental Structure, headed 
by Christopher Alexander, and the architectural firms of Daniel Solomon of San 
Francisco and Phoebe Wall of Pasadena, with the latter providing particular 
insight into the landscape and design traditions of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The city hopes that the ordinance, which recently won a coveted citation for 
urban design and planning from Progressive Architecture (PA) magazine, can soon 
be put to the test, and has designated a potential building site and issued a 
request for proposal, hoping to attract an innovative design and development 
team. Winning awards is nice, the city feels, but building something is better.

The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, which agreed to a $35-million 
settlement to Big Rock Mesa homeowners in January, has tentatively approved an 
elaborate storm drain project designed to prevent a repeat of the landslide 
that damaged or destroyed 250 houses in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The board's approval of the environmental study for the storm drain project 
prompted an angry reaction from homeowners in the exclusive Malibu community 
who objected to paying for a project with no cost estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Chiate, attorney for the homeowners in the recently settled lawsuit against 
the county and a Big Rock resident himself, said: "We don't know if it will 
cost $1,000 per home or $50,000." DAVID M. KINCHENFrom staff reports

Pasadena city officials, despite having their growth-control plan rejected by 
voters March 7, will move quickly to carry out the wishes of voters who want 
severe limits on apartment, condominium and commercial construction in the city 
through the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
"The voters have spoken and it is now incumbent upon the city board of 
directors to implement (the initiative sponsored by Pasadena Residents in 
Defense of our Environment) . . . ," said Mayor William E. Thomson Jr., who 
opposed the winning initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Voters approved the PRIDE measure 57.2% to 42.8%, while rejecting the city's 
rival measure by nearly a 3-to-1 margin. The PRIDE initiative limits 
multifamily housing construction to 250 units a year and limits construction of 
commercial projects larger than 25,000 square feet to a total of 250,000 square 
feet a year. The measure exempts single-family houses, affordable housing and 
commercial projects in Pasadena's northwest side. DAVID M. KINCHENFrom staff

<P>
The chairman of the board of Shapell Industries Inc., Nathan Shapell, has 
offered to buy the houses of dissatisfied owners in the Kite Hill tract in 
Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
At least half a dozen homeowners have sued S &amp; S Construction Co., the 
home-building unit of Shapell Industries, since 1984, alleging that the builder 
and subcontractors failed to correctly grade the site and test and compact the 
soil. Still another lawsuit contends that there is poor plumbing, design and 
construction in a house in the tract. 
</P>
<P>
Shapell said he would pay the original owners who have lived in their houses 
since the tract open a decade ago double their purchase prices in cash. He will 
not require proof that any work done by S &amp; S Construction Co. caused the 
defects. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not want anybody to live in an S &amp; S home who isn't happy," Shapell 
said. The company has built an estimated 60,000 houses in California since it 
was organized 34 years ago including 40,000 in Orange County, according to S 
&amp; S spokesman Richard Mahan, who added that so far, no one has taken 
Shapell up on his buy-back offer. DAVID M. KINCHENFrom staff reports

Santa Monica's City Council has delayed action for at least two months on a 
proposal by Mayor Dennis Zane that would limit the amount of construction 
permitted annually and would allow city officials to select projects based on 
their benefit to the city. 
</P>
<P>
The delay represents a small victory for Santa Moncia business and neighborhood 
groups who oppose the plan, called the Commercial Allotment Program (CAP). The 
program is the latest effort to rein in what many see as runaway growth in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
The CAP would set an annual limit on commercial development -- office, hospital 
and industrial projects larger than 20,000 square feet -- at 200,000 square 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
Zane said he welcomes public discussion of the slow-growth measure but remains 
committed to setting an annual limit on development and establishing a ranking 
system for evaluating projects. DAVID M. KINCHENFrom staff reports

More than one-quarter of the brokers-27 percent-recommended redecorating or 
hanging new wallpaper, followed by 21 percent who said replacing or adding 
carpeting would help sell the house for the highest possible price.

<P>
About 400 franchise and independent real estate brokers took part in the study

Asked what major improvements provided the best long-term return on investment 
when it comes time to sell, brokers listed bathroom improvements (38 percent),

MANDARINS ARE EASY TO GROW IN SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SIDNAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If asked to choose the best orange for eating fresh, most people would probably 
name the navel orange, a choice that is hard to dispute. But I feel that a 
mandarin orange, left to ripen to perfection on the tree, would give the navel 
close competition in eating qualities. 
</P>
<P>
The mandarin orange belongs to the largest citrus family, many members of which 
are erroneously called tangerines. But no matter what they are called, 
mandarins form a citrus group whose fruit provide luscious eating and whose 
trees make a beautiful addition to the landscape. 
</P>
<P>
The different mandarin varieties produce fruit that ranges in color from a deep 
reddish-orange to a very light orange. One quality that all the mandarin 
varieties share is that they are easy to peel and to separate into segments for 
eating. 
</P>
<P>
Florida produces more mandarins than any other state and California ranks 
second. It is in the Orient, however, and especially in Japan, that the 
mandarin enjoys the highest level of popularity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Five Varieties 
</P>
<P>
Most parts of Southern California, from the low deserts to all but the coldest 
areas, provide acceptable growing conditions for the mandarin. 
</P>
<P>
If you would like to add a mandarin tree to your yard, you might consider five 
varieties that are usually available in local nurseries: Owari Satsuma, Kinnow, 
Kara, Clementine and Honey. 
</P>
<P>
Owari Satsuma is my favorite. It has a sweet, tangy and yet mellow flavor that 
is hard to describe unless you've sampled it yourself. It is the most 
cold-tolerant of the mandarins and also thrives in the coastal valleys. 
</P>
<P>
Kinnow has yellowish-orange fruit with a rich flavor and marvelous citrus 
aroma. The tree has an unusual willow-like shape that is most decorative. 
</P>
<P>
Kara was developed in California. It produces large, bright orange fruit with a 
distinctive flavor. It is the juiciest of all the mandarins; it does not 
produce well in our desert areas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plant in March 
</P>
<P>
Clementine generally grows on a small tree that produces beautiful, red-orange 
fruit. For best production, Clementine requires another variety, such as 
Kinnow, planted nearby for cross-pollination. 
</P>
<P>
Honey produces very sweet fruit. It prefers the warmer interior valleys and is 
not a good bet for coastal areas. 
</P>
<P>
Most mandarin varieties are available in standard and semi-dwarf-size trees. If 
your local nursery doesn't have the mandarin tree of your choice, ask them to 
order it for you from a wholesale grower. 
</P>
<P>
March is an ideal month to plant mandarins in the coastal valleys. In colder 
areas, wait until late in the month or April. Purchase only healthy, 
vigorous-looking transplants. Avoid trees with long trunks. If the transplant 
has any fruit on it, pick it off so that the tree's energy can be used to 
produce foliage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Test Drainage 
</P>
<P>
The tree must be planted in a sunny area. Dig a hole twice as wide as the root 
system, but only as deep as the soil the tree was originally grown in. 
</P>
<P>
Test the soil for proper drainage by filling the planting hole with water. Let 
the water drain completely, then fill it again. If the water does not drain out 
within 12 hours, choose another planting site or refer to a soil guide for 
corrective methods. Improper drainage is the primary reason that young trees 
don't survive. After testing, place the tree in the planting hole and refill 
the hole with the soil that you originally removed. 
</P>
<P>
Planting time is a good time to add slow-release fertilizer tablets. Such 
tablets will provide long-term nutrient release without burning the roots. They 
are also ideal for fertilizing established trees. Follow label directions 
carefully. To assure the roots of moisture, water during the planting process. 
</P>
<P>
After planting, if there is no rain, water the new trees twice a week, daily 
during Santa Ana winds or hot spells, for the first six weeks. Then, if there 
is still no rain, start watering weekly. Deep watering is necessary, but keep 
water away from the lower trunk area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paint Trunks 
</P>
<P>
When you plant new trees in hot-sun areas, the trunks should be painted with 
white-wash or wrapped with trunk band (available at most nurseries) to prevent 
sunburn damage. 
</P>
<P>
The only pruning necessary is to remove dead wood or frost-damaged branches, or 
for decorative purposes. As far as pests are concerned, aphids and scale can 
pose problems. Consult your nursery staff for ways to control them.

GARDENING: PLANT PERENNIALS NOW, THEY'LL BLOOM QUICKLY; 
</P>
<P>
FERTILIZER AND REGULAR WATERING HELP ASSURE HEALTHY FLOWERING. MAY IS THE PEAK 
MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On my calendar I have "PLANT PERENNIALS" in big red letters, next to the month 
of March. 
</P>
<P>
This is because I have such success planting them at this time of the year. 
True, they can be planted at just about any time in the fall, winter or spring, 
but in March they waste no time in becoming something. They grow fast and 
strong and seem to bloom almost instantly. 
</P>
<P>
They do not do this all of their own; I do spend a great deal of time and 
effort preparing the soil, digging it up and mixing in organic amendments and 
handfuls of granular fertilizer, and I water quite often for the first month, 
but they quickly take hold and are soon established and ready to flower. 
</P>
<P>
The peak of flowering comes in May -- a glorious month -- and continues into 
June, and I make sure to plant some perennials that will bloom in summer and 
even in early fall. Once established, they take little work; I fertilize every 
couple of months and water about once a week or less. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plan Your Watering 
</P>
<P>
If the watering has you worried because of the continued drought and the chance 
of rationing this summer, consider that perennials tend to need less water than 
most annuals and certainly less than a lawn, which is one reason I converted 
part of my lawn to an expanded perennial bed. 
</P>
<P>
If this knowledge doesn't assuage your concerns, consider planting perennials 
in one compact area where they can be watered while the rest of the shrubs and 
trees in the garden learn to get by on less. Most can, and a bed of perennials 
is certainly worth pampering. 
</P>
<P>
I would set aside this area for perennial flowers because they are such a 
delight to grow, though they seldom flower as long or as profusely as annuals. 
While most annual bedding plants are neat and tidy and very uniform, perennials 
tend to be more varied, undisciplined and wild in appearance but their variety 
and exuberance can be delightful and often surprising. 
</P>
<P>
But planting perennials is not a sure thing. Some perennials are turkeys, 
blooming poorly or growing weakly, so let me suggest some to plant now that are 
not. While I am at it, let me also suggest some strategy. 
</P>
<P>
The idea, as I see it, is to take advantage of the tremendous variety available 
and contrast one kind against another -- to contrast heights, foliage color or 
form (big leaves against little) -- while the flower colors bring the harmony. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fast Growers 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Lychnis coronaria Alba is one extreme, a low-growing tidy clump 
of fuzzy gray-green leaves that will spread in time to about two or even three 
feet across, but never grows above six inches high, except when it flowers. The 
small, white flowers come on slender spikes two or more feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, a plant this low with such exceptional foliage belongs up front in 
the planting scheme. The fact that the flower spikes are so much taller adds a 
little unregimented spice to the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
If you have trouble finding this perennial, try another that looks much like it 
-- lamb's ears. Lamb's ears has even prettier foliage, though it is not as long 
lived, looking poorly all winter and lasting about two years before needing to 
be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
In compensation, it grows very fast, spreading to three feet by the end of the 
season. It too has flower spikes, but they are only two feet tall, with nearly 
invisible pink flowers. I usually cut them off, preferring foliage alone. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Add Contrast 
</P>
<P>
Now for a little contrast. Try that common perennial columbine just behind and 
off to the side of either the lamb's ears or the lychnis. 
</P>
<P>
Columbine has leaves that pick up the gray in the other two, but the effect is 
of contrast because the plant is tall and airy, instead of low and dense. 
Flowers bloom off and on all spring and summer, and are lovely pastel hues on 
three foot stems. Start with good-sized plants, as columbines grow slow. 
</P>
<P>
Another plant that contrasts well is the blue bedding salvia, Salvia farinacea, 
a perennial often grown as if it were an annual. It grows a little over a foot 
tall and just as wide, with slender spikes of purple. 
</P>
<P>
In my own garden, these four perennials grow in front of roses, but to either 
side I plant perennials that colonize. They spread to form good-sized thickets. 
One of these is the double-flowered Shasta daisy 
</P>
<P>
named "Esther Read" that grows to about two feet tall, and the other is 
Physostegia, which grows to about three feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shasta Daisies 
</P>
<P>
The Shasta daisies become the mainstay of the garden in June, blooming along 
with dwarf agapanthus, which, while common, are exceptional perennials 
nonetheless. The physostegia carries the garden into early fall, blooming at 
that time. 
</P>
<P>
The Shasta daisies add the leavening effect of white to the garden, while the 
physostegia adds pink or purple. Both are what I call colonizing perennials 
because they spread underground to make small forests of stems. 
</P>
<P>
Space small plants about a foot apart and they will fill in by summer's end. 
Each year, in winter, some must be pulled out to keep everything in bounds, and 
to keep them out of the roses. 
</P>
<P>
These two perennials are very linear and upright so an appropriate contrast 
would be something round and bushy. If you like bright golden yellow, you will 
find this contrast -- plus flowers all summer and fall -- in the coreopsis 
named Early Sunrise (single flowers), or Sunray (double flowers). Both make 
bushy balls of bright green foliage about two feet across and are smothered 
with flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Behind all this (you can see that a perennial bed must be deep -- as wide as 
six or eight feet) I plant towering delphiniums (the subject of last week's 
column) and Japanese anemones. The anemones go where the bed becomes shady and 
in my garden, grow to about two feet tall and send up flowers -- in the fall -- 
on spikes four to five feet. Flowers are white, or a light purple or pink in 
less common varieties of Japanese anemones. 
</P>
<P>
I always stick in some roots of Liatris or gayfeather, which are available in 
the bulb section at nurseries now. Gayfeather makes three-foot spikes of lovely 
light purple flowers -- a favorite with florists -- and not much foliage. They 
bloom in early fall.

HERE'S HOW: SHOWER DOOR BETTER THAN A CURTAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. J. HAND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are lots of good reasons for replacing a shower curtain with a modern 
shower door. A door does a much better job of keeping water inside the tub and 
off the bathroom floor. It also does a better job of trapping heat, making for 
a warmer, cozier shower. 
</P>
<P>
A door has a neater, crisper look, and it's easier to keep clean and mildew 
free. If you like, you can get a shower door with a mirrored panel, a nice 
convenience if you like to shave in the shower. And shower doors usually have 
long hand rails, just right for hanging your washrag. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, if you're one of those people who can't help but think of Tony Perkins 
and butcher knives every time you step into the shower, a sliding door can give 
you a greater sense of security. 
</P>
<P>
Shower doors come in two basic types. The kind for stall-type showers swings on 
hinges, while doors for tubs usually slide on tracks. I've installed both types 
without any problems whatsoever and in both cases, the whole job took about an 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
Whichever type you need, you can find it at plumbing supply shops, home centers 
and building supply dealers. Before you go shopping, measure the width of the 
area the door will fit. Height shouldn't be a factor. 
</P>
<P>
Installing the door won't require much in the way of tools. If your tub or 
shower area is tiled, you'll need a carbide-tipped bit to drill holes for the 
screws that anchor the side rails in place. If you need to cut the aluminum top 
and bottom track, you can use a hacksaw. I cut mine on the radial arm saw, 
using a carbide-tipped crosscut blade mounted backward. This makes an 
ear-splitting noise, but does a nice, smooth job in a matter of seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Installation techniques vary from one brand to another, but all the instruction 
sheets I have ever seen are very clear and complete. A typical sliding door for 
a tub-type door will look like the one shown in the sketch. Typical 
installation usually goes like this: 
</P>
<P>
Start by cutting the bottom track to length if necessary. Test fit it on the 
front edge of the tub, and mark where you want it to go with a crayon. Then lay 
a couple beads of silicone bathroom caulk along the underside of the track and 
press it into place. If you like, fasten it down with a few strips of heavy 
tape to keep it from shifting while you carry on with the rest of the job. 
</P>
<P>
The next step is to mount the side rails. Test fit each of these in place. Make 
sure the bottom ends match up with the bottom track, and use a level to make 
sure the rails are plumb. Then mark the position of all screw holes with a 
pencil or crayon. Take the track down and drill your mounting holes. 
</P>
<P>
If you are fastening to tile, use a carbide bit to drill holes for the plastic 
anchors usually supplied with the door. Set the anchors, then place the side 
rails and screw them in place. It's not a bad idea to caulk behind the rails. 
If you are fastening to fiberglass, skip the anchors. Drill pilot holes for the 
mounting screws, using a bit slightly smaller than the diameter of the screws. 
Then screw the channels in place. 
</P>
<P>
Now measure for the length of the top track, and saw it to length if necessary. 
With most doors, the top track just slips over the side channels and gravity 
holds it in place. 
</P>
<P>
Now hang the doors. These may come with their wheels unmounted. If so, put the 
wheels on, then install the doors. Some types hang from the top track, others 
ride the bottom track. 
</P>
<P>
Hinged doors are just as easy to install. Usually, you screw up side channels 
on each side of the opening, then screw the door in place. The door will 
probably have a continuous piano-style hinge, and an adjustment that lets you 
slide the door left or right to get a good fit.

BUILDER HELPS EFFORTS AT CONSERVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As California nears the end of its third year of below-average precipitation, 
at least one builder is doing something about conserving water. 
</P>
<P>
Cambridge Development commissioned landscape designer Betty Jo McDonald to use 
drought-tolerant landscaping for the four model homes in the builder's 
Cambridge Chaparral tract on Challenger Way in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Butcher, Cambridge marketing director who came up with the idea, said the 
commission -- is believed to be California's first model compound featuring 
such water conserving landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
The production homes in the 144-unit development will also come with modified 
drought-tolerant front landscaping. Prices for the 3- and 4-bedroom 
single-family houses range from $120,000 to $150,000.

REAL ESTATE BROKER WINS MOVIE AWARD; 
</P>
<P>
THIS REAL ESTATE BROKER WINS ACADEMY AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Bud Elam went from Levis and boots to business suits when he switched from 
producing special film effects to selling industrial buildings, offices and 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
Now he has rented a tuxedo to wear during a ceremony tonight when he will 
receive an Academy Award in the scientific or technical division. Awards in the 
division are given before the Oscar ceremony, which will be televised live 
March 29. 
</P>
<P>
"Funny, isn't it: Real estate broker wins Academy Award?" He laughed. "But this 
is probably the most exciting thing that has happened to me other than helping 
my wife deliver our kids, and she did all the work on that." 
</P>
<P>
Elam, 41, is getting the award, in the form of a plaque, for work he stopped 
doing three years ago when he sold his interest in a computer company called 
Cinema Research. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Designed Computer System 
</P>
<P>
Through Cinema Research, Elam helped design and build a motion-control computer 
system used for special effects, starting with the movie "Stars Wars." The 
computer controls the movement of the camera and objects being photographed, 
making it appear that the objects are moving or flying. 
</P>
<P>
He was in the entertainment business for nearly 10 years and lists, among his 
other credits, the "Galactica" and "Buck Rogers" series, the movie 
"Bladerunner," and several Levi and Panasonic TV commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Elam was schooled in engineering at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo but after 
graduation, formed Cinema Research with some friends. 
</P>
<P>
"But he always had it in the back of his mind to go into real estate," his 
wife, Diana Gold Elam, said. "He liked the idea of being his own boss and 
putting deals together, but the film industry gets frustrating at times, 
because there are so many people involved in making decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"In a real estate deal, all you must deal with is the buyer and the seller. So 
he made the jump." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Likes the Challenge 
</P>
<P>
He earned his sales and broker's licenses, then teamed with Charles Chenea to 
form Southland Commercial Real Estate, with offices at 3435 Wilshire Blvd. They 
have three sales agents working with them and about $90 million in listings. 
</P>
<P>
"Real estate is my thing," he said. "I can't imagine not being challenged by it 
for the rest of my life." 
</P>
<P>
He admits interest in producing special effects for another movie project: 
</P>
<P>
"I'd consider working on 'The Ring,' because it's about peace and love and why 
people should be good to each other." He also knows William Layton Stewart, 
producer of the $35-million science fiction/adventure/romance, expected to 
start shooting in April. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'd have trepidations about taking off even temporarily to work on that," 
Elam added, "because I enjoy what I'm doing in real estate so much."

SOIL DECONTAMINATION CONTRACT TO PROTEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ProTek Environmental Inc., Huntington Beach, has been awarded a contract to 
decontaminate the soil at the 40-acre Heritage Park Corporate Plaza site in 
Santa Fe Springs. The business plaza complex being developed by O'Donnell, 
Armstrong, Brigham &amp; Partners, Irvine, will contain office buildings and 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Using a proprietary system that uses microorganisms to "eat" the hazardous 
contaminants in both the soil and ground water at the site, ProTek's system 
will save the client about $535,000 over the alternative of housing and 
off-site landfill disposal, according to Joe Mathewson, ProTek president. 
</P>
<P>
He estimated that 5,000-10,000 cubic yards of soil at the site have been 
contaminated by crude oil, diesel fuel, waste oil and drilling fluids from 
years of oil production.
