SUICIDE-MURDER SUSPECTED IN SAN DIEGO FIRE

<P>
A despondent Navy wife, who had threatened suicide as recently as last week, 
and her three children died early Monday when arson sent thick smoke billowing 
throughout their Paradise Hills home, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide investigators say they believe the fatal blaze -- the worst 
residential fire here in at least 10 years -- was a suicide-murder because a 
courtyard gate and the house's front door were locked from the inside, and 
there were no signs of forced entry into the home, in the 100 block of 
Brandywood Street. 
</P>
<P>
A Navy spokesman said Monday that a chaplain contacted county authorities 
several days ago to report that the children might be in an "urgent situation." 
The Navy spokesman said San Diego County's Department of Social Services 
promised to take immediate action; a county official said nothing was done 
because the county had no reason to believe there was an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Had Been Despondent 
</P>
<P>
The Navy identified the victims as 36-year-old Esperanza Cabalbag and her three 
children: Jamie, 10; Tamara, 8, and Filomeno Jr., 5. 
</P>
<P>
Cabalbag's husband, Filomeno, has been deployed aboard the guided missile 
destroyer Henry B. Wilson since Dec. 1 and was at sea at the time of the fire, 
Navy Cmdr. David Dillon said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Navy and police officials said Monday that Esperanza Cabalbag had been 
despondent since early March and had sent a letter last week to her husband, 
threatening suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Contacted by Navy officials, police visited the Cabalbag home last week, 
confiscated a rifle from the woman and advised her to seek counseling for her 
depression, said Lt. Phil Jarvis, head of the San Diego Police Department's 
homicide division. 
</P>
<P>
A Navy chaplain working with the family was sufficiently concerned that he 
contacted the county's Children's Services Abuse Hotline on Thursday morning, 
Dillon said. The hot line takes reports of abused or neglected children. 
</P>
<P>
"He communicated the situation, that there was some urgency," Dillon said of 
the chaplain, whom he declined to identify. Children's Services "knew the 
police had been there, and they said they would take it for action." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Never Opened File 
</P>
<P>
Children's Services, however, never opened a file on the case because the 
agency believed there was no immediate threat to the children's safety, 
spokeswoman Yolanda Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
"From all the records we have, the call came in asking for other financial 
resources available to the children," Thomas said. "Basically, the family was 
not able to live on their allotment. There was no food. The children evidently 
were kept home from school because of the lack of food. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no indication that there was any danger to the children," Thomas 
said. "The indication was that this was a family that needed financial 
assistance. . . . A file was not opened on this case." 
</P>
<P>
According to fire and police officials, the blaze was first spotted early 
Monday by a motorist who saw smoke coming from the Cabalbag's garage. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters were called at about 1:45 a.m. but found it difficult to get into 
the residence because of iron bars on the windows and a locked iron gate at the 
entrance to the courtyard, Jarvis said. The garage door, which ran on an 
automatic opener, was locked from the inside, Jarvis said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fire in Car 
</P>
<P>
After cutting holes in the garage door with a chain saw, firefighters 
extinguished a blaze in one of the family's cars before breaking through a side 
door leading to the courtyard. They then forced their way through the front 
door, which was locked from the inside with the keys still in the dead bolt 
lock, Jarvis said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters found a series of fires sending a thick blanket of black smoke 
through the house. One of the Cabalbag children was found in the kitchen; the 
mother and her other two children were found in a bedroom, Jarvis said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters and medical personnel tried to resuscitate the family, who were 
sent to three area hospitals before they were pronounced dead. The county 
coroner's office said autopsies would be performed today. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Department Capt. Larry Cooke said he did not know how long it took the 
firefighters to get into the house but that the delay probably didn't figure in 
the deaths. "I don't think so, because the fire had been going for a while," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Beasley, a neighbor who watched the rescue efforts, faulted 
firefighters for taking a chain saw to the garage and spending about 15 minutes 
on the burning vehicle before trying to go into the house to rescue the family. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Knew They Were Dead 
</P>
<P>
"They dealt with the garage so long and then finally got into the house," 
Beasley said. "I said, 'They're probably dead.' " 
</P>
<P>
"I knew they were dead when they brought them out. It was not a pretty sight to 
see them bringing those kids out. I was praying for them," Beasley said. 
</P>
<P>
Beasley noted that, despite the early-morning hour of the fire, the family 
members were dressed in street clothes. The only one in pajamas was the 
youngest boy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The house, which abuts Morse High School, sustained $40,000 worth of damage in 
the fire, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the fire was intentionally set, Jarvis said, police homicide detectives 
are in charge of the arson investigation. He said Monday afternoon that the 
fact that there were no signs of forced entry into the home had police 
believing the fire was a suicide-murder. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any indication that an outside person was involved in it, but 
there are a few things I want to clarify," Jarvis said. "There certainly is an 
indication that suicide is a possibility." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Burned-Out Couch 
</P>
<P>
Jarvis added, however, that police will not make a final determination until 
they see toxicology reports on family members, as well as conduct tests to see 
if an outsider could have gained access to the home. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide detectives sifted through the house, including the living room, where 
a burned-out couch, love seat and piano were all that remained. The ceiling and 
walls were charred, and handprints ran down the rear sliding-glass door. 
</P>
<P>
Cmdr. Dillon said Navy officials and chaplains had talked to Cabalbag since at 
least early March about her depression. They also called police last week when 
she wrote her husband and threatened suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Jarvis said police took away a rifle and suggested places she could obtain 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
"It appeared at the time that she was positive . . . and would follow the 
advice and contact some of these agencies for help," Jarvis said. 
</P>
<P>
Filomeno Cabalbag, a Filipino native and senior chief machinist mate who earns 
$2,999 a month, was informed of the tragedy Monday afternoon and will be sent 
home on emergency leave immediately, Dillon said. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to say where Cabalbag's ship is deployed, but said it left San 
Diego on Dec. 1.

 -- Tom Whittaker is a mountain climber with a message. Whittaker, who lost his 
right foot in a 1979 automobile accident, wants to climb Mt. Everest, the 
world's highest mountain, to show that disabled people are capable of anything. 
"I don't feel like a kamikaze pilot," said Whittaker, 40, a teacher of 
therapeutic recreation for disabled people at Idaho State University at 
Pocatello. "I go climbing not to make my life shorter. I do it for 
self-fulfillment." Whittaker is part of a 15-member expedition led by Karen 
Fellerhoff, 29, of Bozeman, Mont., the first American woman to lead an assault 
on the 29,028-foot Everest. The team planned to leave Katmandu, Nepal, for its 
base camp today. The expedition team includes Peter Hillary, 34, the son of Sir 
Edmund Hillary, one of the two men who were the first to climb Everest. 
Whittaker said he would hike to the base camp using a specially made walking 
boot and then switch to another special pair of carbon-graphite boots for the 
actual climb. The climbing boots, he said, were designed for the Everest 
attempt, with a spring at the heels to store energy and release pressure when 
the weight is off.

 -- Astronaut Robert C. Springer was ready to walk out during the Discovery 
mission, according to his mother. "Bob was hoping for just some little problem 
so he could take a space walk" and do some repair work, Betty Springer said 
from her son's home in Seabrook, Tex. Instead, the flight was almost perfect, 
which suited Mrs. Springer just fine. The only problem in the five-day voyage 
concerned an erratic pressure reading from a hydrogen tank that helps supply 
electricity to the orbiter. Mrs. Springer and her husband, Walter, watched the 
shuttle take off at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, then went to Texas and 
watched the landing in California on TV Saturday. Springer, 46, served as a 
mission specialist aboard the shuttle.

 -- Cartoon cat Garfield is ready to go out on a limb for trees. Garfield, his 
creator Jim Davis and Smokey the Bear will join Indiana Gov. Evan Bayh and 170 
schoolchildren in planting a tree on the Statehouse lawn in Indianapolis on 
Arbor Day. Davis, an Indiana native, is the 1989 Arbor Day spokesman for the 
Hoosier state. "Now is the perfect time for all Hoosiers to contribute 
something to their communities," Davis said in a statement. "Plant a tree, plan 
a celebration, do something fun for Arbor Day." Arbor Day, the second Friday of 
each April, is set aside to recognize the benefits trees provide. SHIRLEY

manufacturer threatened to blow it up. The incident began before dawn with a 
report that bottles of ether had been delivered there. Deputies sealed off two 
blocks and evacuated six homes. SWAT team members used tear gas to enter the 
shed after a negotiating team failed to persuade the man to surrender. The

UCSD LAB-ANIMAL USE PROTESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN FAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A national organization of physicians has protested a laboratory course offered 
by UC San Diego in which emergency and family physicians practice surgical 
techniques on anesthetized dogs. 
</P>
<P>
The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a nonprofit Washington-based 
group which promotes alternatives to using animals in medical education, wants 
UCSD to cancel the lab because its use of dogs is unethical, impractical and 
unnecessary, members said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Dogs or any other live animals do not belong in the teaching laboratory," said 
Roger C. Breslau, a general, thoracic and vascular surgeon from Rancho Santa 
Fe. "Being allowed and even encouraged by faculty to operate on anesthetized 
live animals sends the wrong message to physicians and students of medicine, 
namely, that it is 'OK' to use and then kill healthy, live animals as though 
they were disposable commodities." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Optional Elective 
</P>
<P>
Jane Cartmill, associate director of San Diego Animal Advocates, a local animal 
rights group, said that "if there was ever a time for UCSD to make good on 
their claim that they only use animals when it's absolutely necessary, then 
this is it." 
</P>
<P>
PCRM members maintain there are alternatives to using the dogs, such as 
videotapes and lifelike mannequins used for teaching surgery. Also, they argue, 
people who take the lab are not beginning medical students but licensed 
physicians who already know surgical techniques. 
</P>
<P>
The lab is an elective, part of a series of continuing medical education 
courses that have been offered at UCSD since 1975 and sponsored by the 
university and Scripps Memorial Hospital in Encinitas. Accredited by the 
American and California Medical associations, the courses provide doctors with 
credits for continuing medical education. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD officials say using dogs is the only effective way to teach the course. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas J. Ruben, course director and director of the emergency department at 
Scripps, said simulators, or human models, were not realistic enough. "The 
sensation, the technique of dissection isn't the same." 
</P>
<P>
The lab is designed not for surgeons, he added, but for emergency room 
physicians and family practitioners who deal with patients in emergency 
settings. Some of the procedures performed on the dogs, such as cricothyrotomy 
(the surgical opening of a patient's airways when nose and mouth are blocked) 
do not occur often enough in emergency rooms for physicians to observe on a 
regular basis, Ruben said. 
</P>
<P>
"Patients are best served by a physician who has had an opportunity to learn 
these techniques on a live model, and not on a mannequin, cadaver or through a 
videotape," said Leslie Franz, a spokeswoman for the university's health 
science department. 
</P>
<P>
But Breslau said the anatomy of a dog is not similar to that of a human and 
that thousands of physicians did not believe operating on live dogs is 
necessary to practice existing surgical techniques. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2,000 Physician Members 
</P>
<P>
"The (emergency medicine) courses appear to be well-constructed, well-balanced 
. . . but there's no purpose served by adding a live-animal lab. It generates 
some revenue for the university, but it certainly doesn't help the teaching 
process." 
</P>
<P>
Breslau said about 2,000 physicians have joined PCRM. 
</P>
<P>
The lab is held three times a year and costs $250 a participant. Enrollment is 
20 people per lab. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the university pays $100 to $200 each for dogs destined to be put 
to sleep at county animal shelters, PCRM members said the lab's use of live 
dogs showed "disrespect for life." 
</P>
<P>
Ruben disagreed. "The animals are treated humanely. They're anesthetized and 
physicians learn emergency life-saving techniques (from them.) They're then 
given the lethal injection . . . they never wake up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Their death is the same (as it would be at the pound) but the process by which 
they die gives physicians a chance to experience life-saving techniques . . . 
and that's respect for life." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Animal Advocates are sponsoring a candlelight vigil at the 
university's basic science building Tuesday to protest the lab's use of dogs.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: NORTH COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A suspect's fingerprints were found on a piece of tape gagging a murder victim, 
a sheriff's deputy told a judge Monday. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Municipal Judge Robert Stahl Jr. listened to three witnesses at a 
brief preliminary hearing before ordering Alan Buzzard Stevens, 46, of San 
Marcos to stand trial for the murder of Cynthia McVey, 26, of Livermore. 
</P>
<P>
McVey was vacationing in San Diego County when she was strangled. Her body was 
found Nov. 29 off California 76 on the Pala Indian Reservation. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens is a potential suspect in the killings of several prostitutes in North 
County, but so far has only been charged with the slaying of McVey. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's detective Sam Bove testified that Stevens' fingerprints match those 
found on the tape that covered the victim's mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ronald Rivers, who performed the autopsy, said McVey had been strangled by 
hand. Rivers said that, because of the position of the body, he suspected that 
McVey was killed elsewhere and then dumped at the site where the body was 
found. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens trial date will be set at an April 3 arraignment. He remains in County 
Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN MARCOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 13-year-old boy's step-grandparents have been arrested on suspicion of felony 
child abuse and assault with a deadly weapon after the boy told sheriff's 
investigators he had been beaten with a broom handle, a mallet and an 
electrical cord, a sheriff's spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies arrested Gina Marie Lockridge, 31, and Harry Lockridge, 52, Friday. 
Gina Lockridge's 13-year-old son was also taken into custody in connection with 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
A sheriff's spokesman said the victim, who was staying in Los Angeles after 
leaving his step-grandparents, first reported the beatings to the Los Angeles 
Police Department on March 13. San Diego County sheriff's investigators went to 
Los Angeles to talk with the boy. He told them he had undergone beatings from 
his step-grandmother and her son in the 200 block of Mission Road in San 
Marcos, where he had lived since October, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Following the boy's complaint to police, three other juveniles at the San 
Marcos home were taken into protective custody. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff's investigators examined the boy and found his body covered with 
cuts and bruises. He was treated at a hospital in Los Angeles and has been 
placed in a foster home there, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Gina and Larry Harrington were being held in County Jail in lieu of $100,00 
bail each. Gina's son was being held at Juvenile Hall.

POLICE KILL GUNMAN, 80, IN WHEELCHAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A wheelchair-bound, 80-year-old man was shot and killed by two SWAT team 
officers Sunday when he pointed a pistol at the officers and pulled the 
trigger, San Diego police said. 
</P>
<P>
The man's gun did not fire, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Warren H. (Jimmy) Harrington, who lived with his wife, Martha, in a condominium 
in the 2200 block of Del Mar Scenic Parkway, was shot about 9:43 p.m. and died 
of multiple gunshot wounds at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla about 15 
minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
Police officers arrived at the residence at 7:30 p.m. after it was reported 
that the man had a gun and was threatening to commit suicide. The Special 
Weapons and Tactics team arrived at the scene about 8:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
During a more than two-hour standoff, Harrington's wife and the Rev. Mike 
MacIntosh, a police chaplain, failed to talk him into giving up the gun. They 
left the condominium after Harrington put the gun to his chest, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police then entered the apartment. Harrington, who was confined to a 
wheelchair, pointed the .32-caliber revolver at them and pulled the trigger, 
police said. Officers Melvin Lofftus and Wayne Spees then fired almost 
simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators later determined that the bullets in Harrington's gun were duds, 
a police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Harrington's wife told police that her husband had been distraught for two 
weeks because he was confined to a wheelchair after suffering a stroke, the 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Harrington's daughter-in-law, Sue Harrington, said Monday that he had founded 
Harrington's Appliances, once a chain with several outlets in San Diego County 
but that only the store on Upas Street in North Park remains.

SIDEKICKS AVOID FORECLOSURE, WILL COMPLETE MISL SEASON

The future of the Sockers and the Major Indoor Soccer League brightened Monday 
when the Dallas Sidekicks met a 1:30 p.m. deadline set last week by a federal 
bankruptcy judge for posting $260,000 to avoid foreclosure by the 
organization's major creditor, Dallas Basketball Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
Four major shareholders, including Stan Finney Jr., chairman of the board for 
the Sidekicks, put up the money which guarantees that the team will finish the 
remainder of the season, according to Gordon Jago, the Sidekicks' president and 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
Sockers President Ron Cady, a participant in a conference call Monday morning 
in which representatives from each of the seven teams discussed the matter, 
said this will allow the MISL expansion committee to continue its search for 
new franchise sites. Also, he said, it gives the MISL's executive search 
committee an opportunity to continue looking for a commissioner. Bill Kentling 
resigned as commissioner last week, effective May 31. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm real encouraged," Cady said. "It sends a message (to the league) that they 
(the Sidekicks) have made a commitment." 
</P>
<P>
Dallas is still required to post payments of $130,000 in April, May and June to 
Dallas Basketball Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been granted the opportunity to reorganize and prepare for the 
future," Jago said. "I think the other teams will be very relieved. For us not 
to complete the season would have been absolutely disastrous." DON PATTERSON

victory over the Dallas Mavericks Monday night at Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Kersey had 23 points and 16 rebounds as Portland snapped a three-game 
losing streak and moved 1 1/2 games ahead of the Mavericks in the battle for 
the final Western Conference playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
The Mavericks, who play the Clippers Wednesday in the Sports Arena, lost their 
seventh straight despite 24 points from Adrian Dantley and 20 from Rolando 
Blackman. 
</P>
<P>
Drexler scored 16 of his 29 points and Duckworth 11 of his 25 as the Trail 
Blazers rallied from a 46-41 halftime deficit, and outscored Dallas, 38-14, in 
the third quarter. It was Portland's biggest margin in any period this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers (32-32), took the lead with a 13-5 run, six by Drexler, to 
start the third quarter. Consecutive layups by Drexler gave the Blazers a 54-51 
lead with 8:48 left in the period. 
</P>
<P>
Portland added a 12-0 run later in the quarter, with Drexler scoring eight. The 
Trail Blazers made 16 of 27 shots in the period. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix 115, Miami 97 -- Tom Chambers scored 26 points and Kevin Johnson had 12 
of his 21 points in the decisive third quarter as the Suns won their 11th 
straight at home. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Hornacek and Eddie Johnson added 20 points each for Phoenix, which is 30-4 
in Veterans Memorial Coliseum this season, including 26 of the last 28 there. 
</P>
<P>
New York 129, Philadelphia 109 -- Patrick Ewing had 31 points and 14 rebounds 
and Rod Strickland added 22 points and 10 assists at Philadelphia as the Knicks 
won for the seventh time in nine games and broke a four-game road losing 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 83-70, with 6:53 left in the third quarter, the Knicks outscored 
Philadelphia, 17-2, and took their biggest lead of the game, 100-72, on a layup 
by Kiki Vandeweghe with 2:13 left in the quarter. Philadelphia never got closer 
than 20 points thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 103, Washington 97 -- John Williams scored six points during a key 
12-3 run early in the fourth quarter and the Cavaliers tied a team record with 
seven three-point baskets at Richfield, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Harper scored 23 points and Craig Ehlo 21 for Cleveland, whose 48-17 record 
is the best in the National Basketball Assn., 1 1/2 games better than idle 
Detroit (45-17) in the Central Division. The Cavaliers, who missed only one of 
their eight attempts from the three-point line, have won 24 of their last 25 at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Washington led, 55-51, at halftime and maintained a narrow margin for most of 
the third quarter. But Darnell Valentine's three-pointer with one second left 
in the period -- only his third of the season -- gave the Cavaliers a 79-77 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 119, San Antonio 108 -- Ed Pinckney scored nine of his 22 points in a 
15-4 third-quarter run at Boston that carried the Celtics to their 20th 
consecutive victory over the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
Led by Reggie Lewis' 24 points, Boston won for the fifth time in six games. The 
Spurs, whose club record for consecutive road losses reached 12, last beat 
Boston Jan. 5, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Brickowski had 20 for San Antonio. Vernon Maxwell added 19 and Willie 
Anderson 18 for the Spurs, who played without guard Johnny Dawkins. He went on 
the injured list Monday with nerve trouble in his left leg and is expected to 
miss the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte 117, Sacramento 110 -- Tyrone Bogues scored five points in the final 
49 seconds as the Hornets, who scored 12 of their final 14 points at the 
free-throw line, including eight of 10 in the last 49 seconds, won at 
Sacramento.

In the 39th Lions tournament, which got under way Monday, Helix avenged last 
year's defeat by routing Hoover, 21-4, in a AA Division game at Hoover. 
</P>
<P>
Helix, which had 20 hits, scored in every inning before the game was called 
after six innings because of the tournament's 12-run rule.

NEW CHAIRMAN STEADIES COURSE OF CIPHER DATA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, San Diego County Business Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Gary Liebl took over as Cipher Data Products chairman and chief executive 
in January of 1987, he faced problems that would have daunted the most gung-ho 
of executives. 
</P>
<P>
Cipher Data's dependence on a single major product -- a tape drive used as a 
back-up data storage device for minicomputers -- had come back to haunt the 
company. The market for "minis" was under siege by the new generation of 
powerful personal computers and workstations. As a consequence, demand for 
Cipher Data's tape drives fell off and the company reported a drop in both 
sales and earnings for 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Cipher was low on cash, suffered from a bloated inventory and faced 
serious quality-control problems. To add to Liebl's worries, the company was 
stuck with an apparent lemon: the Optimem optical disk drive unit it had 
acquired in July 1986 that was losing millions of dollars trying to develop 
elusive technology for an "eraseable" or re-recordable optical disk drive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Total Restructuring 
</P>
<P>
"The issues that I faced did not lend themselves to simple fixes but to a 
fundamental . . . restructuring of the total company, including its top 
management," said Liebl, who came to Cipher Data after eight years with 
McDonnell Douglas. He had left as a group operating officer in charge of the 
information systems group, a $1.2-billion, 18,000-employee unit. 
</P>
<P>
Liebl wasted little time with the overhaul. The number of employees has been 
reduced by 25%, to about 1,800, since 1986 and will be reduced by another 200 
by the end of June. Only two of 10 corporate officers at Cipher Data in 1986 
are still with the company. Organizationally, the company has been carved into 
four groups, each with profit and loss responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
To cut costs and improve efficiency, Cipher Data has moved the bulk of the 
company's manufacturing operations to Singapore from plants in San Diego and 
Garden Grove. The company has instituted a "quality college" for all employees 
that has raised customer acceptance of its products to 99% from the 85% level 
two years ago, Liebl said. 
</P>
<P>
At Optimem, research on the eraseable optical disk drive has been scrapped as 
the company focuses on its existing "write once, read many times" (WORM) 
products marketed to mainly government customers with heavy document storage 
needs, including the U. S. Patent Office. 
</P>
<P>
Liebl's most recent move is Cipher Data's $74-million tender offer for Irwin 
Magnetic Systems of Ann Arbor, Mich., a manufacturer of "minicartridge tape 
drives" that provide backup data storage for personal computers and 
workstations. The acquisition will add 3.5-inch tape drives to Cipher Data's 
product line, which now starts at 5.25-inch drives and goes up. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strengthened Position 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition of Irwin, which reported a $1.5-million profit on $49.2 million 
in 1988 sales, is being made possible by Cipher Data's strengthened cash 
position of $82.2 million, up from $13 million 10 quarters ago, Liebl said. 
Cipher Data will pay roughly half in cash for Irwin and the rest with bank 
loans, treasurer Thomas Anderson said last week. The tender is expected to be 
complete early next month. 
</P>
<P>
The jury is still out on whether Liebl's restructuring will translate into 
significantly higher profits, observers say. Cipher Data's $10.4-million profit 
on 1988 sales of $185.4 million was an improvement over the $4.3-million profit 
on $178.2 million in 1987 sales but not enough to satisfy David Claridge, 
senior technology analyst with Hambrecht &amp; Quist investment bankers in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"Two factors that I have concern about is that neither Cipher nor Irwin have 
high pre-tax margins." Less-than-desired profit margins "have been a 
longstanding issue with Cipher," Claridge said. And, although the Irwin deal 
makes long-term sense by expanding Cipher Data's product line, it may reduce 
earnings in the short run because Irwin's profit will be less than the interest 
income Cipher has been making on its cash, Claridge said. 
</P>
<P>
The stock market has responded less than enthusiastically to the Irwin merger. 
Cipher Data stock closed Monday at $8.375 a share, off from a 52-week high of 
$11 set last month before the deal was announced. 
</P>
<P>
Liebl acknowledged the Irwin deal may hurt profits at first. But he said the 
earnings dilution is an acceptable price to pay for entry into a growing market 
that is 52% controlled by Irwin. 
</P>
<P>
High growth prospects for Irwin's 3.5-inch tape drives were attested to by Bob 
Abraham, vice president of Freeman Associates, a Santa Barbara-based market 
research firm that tracks computer peripheral-product sales. He said unit 
shipments of 3.5-inch tape drives should triple from 500,000 units shipped in 
1988 to 1.5 million units in 1992. The dollar value of the 3.5-inch tape-drive 
market will grow over that time from $120 million to $320 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Irwin has dominated that market, so if Cipher Data can simply maintain that 
dominance, they are in a growth market," Abraham said. The growth afforded 
Cipher by Irwin is needed because the market for Cipher's existing 
bread-and-butter products will grow only at a 5% to 8% rate in coming years, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$1-Billion Company 
</P>
<P>
Liebl said the Irwin acquisition will bolster his goal of Cipher Data becoming 
a $1-billion company by 1996 as well as the world's largest supplier of 
"removable media" data storage equipment. To round out Cipher Data's product 
offerings, Liebl said, the company may well buy a floppy disk drive 
manufacturer at some point. 
</P>
<P>
And he defended Cipher's profit margins, saying the company has made heavy 
investments in the development of new products that will pay off later. The 
future of one of those products, Cipher Data's 3000 line of half-inch removable 
cartridge tape drives, is still unclear however. Cipher Data had hoped to 
introduce the product last year with an International Business Machines 
imprimatur in the form of a major supply contract. But IBM passed on the 
product, whose development it had helped finance, and now Cipher Data is 
marketing the product on its own. 
</P>
<P>
Those issues aside, Claridge and others commended Cipher's chairman for 
crafting a leaner, more focused and broadly based company. "Liebl has made a 
big difference," said David Claridge, "He has stabilized the company and has it 
focused on internal operating disciplines." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Katzive, vice president of Disk/Trend Report, a Mountain View market 
research firm, said: "I think they've come from a long way back. For a while, 
people wondered if (Cipher Data management) knew where it was going."

SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pessimistic traders and short-sellers had their wish come true as the Dow Jones 
Industrial Average fell 78 points, or 3.3%, over the past two trading days, 
Irving Katz, director of research at Thomas Green/San Diego Securities, said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The drop followed the announcement that the producer price index had increased 
1% in February or 12.6% on an annual basis, portending a distinct inflationary 
environment in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
Interest-sensitive stocks were particularly affected as HomeFed Corp., parent 
of Home Federal Savings, was down $1.50 and Great American First Savings Bank 
fell $.875. Home Federal had reached a new 52-week high of $33.375 earlier in 
the week. 
</P>
<P>
Other stocks selling off were Henley Group, down $4; Rohr Industries, down 
$2.50; Xytronyx, down $1.25; and Magma Power and Mail Boxes Etc., each down $1. 
New lows were recorded during the past week by Synbiotics and Syntro, a pair of 
local biotechnology companies. 
</P>
<P>
The largest gainer of the week was Pancretec, which hit a new high of $14.50 in 
response to a bid by Abbott Laboratories to acquire the company for $15 a 
share, or $54 million. The stock, which sold at $1.50 in December, 1987, was 
selling at $9.625 just two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It would appear that some (Pancretec) investors were very prescient about the 
company's future," Katz said, referring to the more than 40% run-up in 
Pancretec's stock price over the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Other stocks, including Humphrey, Molecular Biosystems, DH Technology, and 
General Microelectronics reached 52-week highs last week but were unable to 
sustain them when the market dropped.

BISHOP RISKS BEING CUT FROM NASD STOCK LISTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Assn. of Securities Dealers may drop Bishop Inc. from its 
up-to-the-minute nationwide computerized stock listings because the company 
doesn't meet new, stricter financial requirements recently imposed by the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
The Westlake Village company's $2.8-million net worth on Dec. 31 was far below 
the $4 million that is required for membership in the NASD's revised National 
Market System. Net worth is usually defined as a company's total assets minus 
total liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
NASD spokesman Enno Hobbing said actual delistings of companies will begin 
March 31. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to appeal this," said Bishop President Kenneth Kay. "We are going 
to do everything we can to remain listed on the National Market System." 
</P>
<P>
The NMS is an electronic scoreboard of sorts that reports every trade of a 
company's stock within 90 seconds, and gives stockbrokers and investors a quick 
read of how a particular stock is being valued. If Bishop is dropped from the 
NMS and trades on a smaller, regional stock exchange, the price of its stock 
could suffer, according to analysts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Fewer Investors Aware' 
</P>
<P>
"I think the visibility in the stock would decline and there would be fewer 
investors aware of it," said Norman Fosback, editor of Market Logic, an 
investment newsletter that covers the over-the-counter stock market. "Any time 
you reduce the universe of people that know of a stock, you reduce the demand. 
And that could mean a drop in price." 
</P>
<P>
Hobbing said a company such as Bishop would have to convince the NASD that its 
financial condition is improving and that it can soon meet the revised 
standards in order to circumvent the new requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop may have a hard time making such a claim. 
</P>
<P>
The company has experienced numerous problems in recent years largely because 
it reacted slowly to the computerization of its industry. Bishop supplies 
engineers and draftsmen with the materials they need to design circuit boards, 
the plates of wires and connectors that power everything from television sets 
to space vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
During the last three years, the company's losses have grown steadily. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Losses Slowed 
</P>
<P>
Recent attempts at restructuring have slowed the losses but haven't stopped 
them. In the latest quarter that ended Dec. 31, Bishop lost $79,000 on revenue 
of $2.2 million, compared to a loss of $322,000 on revenue of $2.4 million in 
the same period a year earlier. For the year that ended Sept. 30, Bishop lost 
$2.5 million on revenue of $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
The NASD's push to tighten its membership standards began in January when it 
got approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission to delist some of its 
members if they do not meet new financial requirements. It is part of an effort 
by the NASD to shore up its image and clean out companies that faltered after 
the October, 1987, stock market crash. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to show the quality of our market, we thought we would raise the 
qualification standards," Hobbing said. The NASD claims that it is more 
difficult to obtain membership in the NMS than in the American Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
If Bishop is delisted from the NMS, the company's stock would either trade on a 
regional exchange such as the Pacific Stock Exchange or be relegated to the 
so-called pink sheets, a relatively obscure system that summarizes the high and 
low price of a particular stock at the end of each day. Some pink sheet stocks 
only trade on an irregular basis, and their owners can find it more difficult 
to sell their holdings. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop's stock closed Monday at $1.50.

LIFEBLOOD IN A TINY MARKET; 
</P>
<P>
SEREX BANKING ON PLASMA WITH ITS STOCK OFFERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Doctors can help patients with a certain disease, such as hepatitis, by 
injecting the patients with a solution containing antibodies that have come 
from a donor who has had the same disease and built up an immunity to it. By 
passing the antibodies along, the idea is that the immunity gets passed along 
too. 
</P>
<P>
But where do the doctors find such donors? 
</P>
<P>
Enter Serex International, a tiny Van Nuys company that is essentially a legman 
for the medical profession. Serex hunts down the few donors who have the 
antibodies, buys their blood plasma (the liquid portion of blood that contains 
the antibodies) and then sells the plasma to traditional drug companies and 
laboratories. They further treat the plasma to create the antibody-laden 
solutions injected into other people. Serex also sells plasma to biotechnology 
companies that are trying to come up with new drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Serex and its competitors thus fill a needed, but quite small, market in the 
medical business world. In its fiscal year that ended May 31, Serex earned 
$158,835 on sales of only $1.3 million. One of Serex's main rivals in the Los 
Angeles area, MD Laboratories, which last week was bought by HemaCare Corp. in 
Sherman Oaks, is even smaller, with annual sales of about $800,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Common Shares 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, 10-year-old Serex last week announced plans to go public by 
selling 500,000 common shares. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Serex proposed selling the stock for $5 a share and, after 
subtracting underwriting commissions and other expenses, hopes to raise $2.13 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Serex officials, including the founder and chairman, Dr. Gino Iovine, declined 
a request for an interview. They cited an SEC regulation -- the "quiet period" 
between the time a stock offering is announced and its actual sale -- that 
forbids the company selling the stock from making any statements that could be 
interpreted as touting it. 
</P>
<P>
The prospectus alerts any would-be investor to one of the big risks for Serex 
stockholders. While the company has a high profit margin per dollar of sales, 
two of its customers account for 71% of the company's sales. Small companies 
with only a few important customers must always worry about suffering a sharp 
reversal in fortunes if a customer takes its business elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Cutter Biological Corp. in Berkeley, a division of Miles Inc., which in turn is 
owned by Bayer AG of West Germany, is one of Serex's two main customers. The 
other is a Swedish company, Plasma Procurement KABI. 
</P>
<P>
Serex's prospectus states that the company intends to use the cash from the 
offering to expand or relocate its plasma operations, and to fund research and 
development projects that presumably could attract new customers. Among other 
things, Serex is developing new kits to rapidly detect syphilis from skin 
lesions and blood samples. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Specialty Operation 
</P>
<P>
But Serex does not yet have any of those products on the commercial market, and 
for now it must rely on its specialty plasma operations. 
</P>
<P>
Major pharmaceutical companies, such as Abbott Laboratories and Baxter 
International, which process the special plasma into medicine, rely on Serex, 
MD Labs and dozens of other small firms nationwide to locate donors. It isn't 
easy to find the limited number of people whose plasma has the valuable 
antibodies, and the big drug companies don't find the effort worth their while. 
</P>
<P>
People carrying the antibodies are "a tiny percentage of the population, and 
you can't just line up people and run them through the lab" looking for the few 
needed donors, said Thomas M. Asher, HemaCare's chairman and a former business 
partner with Iovine. So Serex, MD Labs and the others search medical records 
and talk to hospitals and doctors to find donors. 
</P>
<P>
Once Serex finds a donor, the person typically gives Serex two pints of blood 
twice a week at Serex's facilities, perhaps for a year or more. Serex said it 
has about 75 donors, and the people really don't donate at all. They are paid 
an average $75 a visit, or $7,800 a year. 
</P>
<P>
(Actual blood donations often are made at blood banks, such as those operated 
by the American Red Cross and other tax-exempt organizations.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plasma Separated 
</P>
<P>
After Serex acquires the blood, it uses a centrifuge to separate the plasma 
from the red blood cells. The red blood cells are then mixed with a saline 
solution and transfused back to the donor. Serex gets about one pint of salable 
plasma from every two pints of whole blood. The plasma is frozen until it is 
sold to Cutter or another customer. Prices average about $325 per pint of 
plasma, Serex's prospectus said. 
</P>
<P>
Asher said the drug companies and research laboratories "are always looking" 
for special plasma to process into medicines. So why aren't Serex or MD Labs 
much bigger? Because a little bit of rare plasma goes a long way in medicine, 
and customers "buy it in one-liter and two-liter amounts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cutter, for instance, buys "many hundreds of thousands of liters" per year of 
more "standard" blood plasma that Cutter uses to produce less exotic medicines, 
Cutter spokesman Bud Modersbach said. But Cutter buys only "hundreds of liters 
per year" from Serex, he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the prospectus, Iovine, 60, earned a doctorate in biology from New 
York University and his medical degree from New York State College of Medicine. 
He is an associate medical director at Olive View Medical Center in Sylmar, a 
Los Angeles County facility, where he has worked since 1956. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Former Partners 
</P>
<P>
HemaCare's founder Asher and Iovine are now competitors, but at one time they 
were partners. In 1968, Asher and Iovine co-founded a plasma-products company 
called Immuno Science Corp. A decade later, by which time the company had gone 
public, Immuno Science was sold to Johnson &amp; Johnson for $11 million. Asher 
declined to say exactly how much he and Iovine made in the sale, but 
acknowledged that "we certainly felt no pain from the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
Iovine and Wayne Kohli then started Serex in 1979 while Asher went off to start 
HemaCare, which provides a variety of blood-related services. But about five 
years ago, Iovine and Kohli "had a falling out," Kohli moved to MD Labs and now 
the two are competitors, Asher said. 
</P>
<P>
Iovine owns 27% of Serex's common stock, a stake that would be diluted to 19% 
if the public offering goes as planned. The stake also would give Iovine's 
holdings a paper value of $1.6 million if the stock sells for $5 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Because special plasma with antibodies can help hepatitis patients and patients 
with other diseases, the question arises: Could the process one day help 
patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome? 
</P>
<P>
Asher said there are experiments under way whereby antibodies are being taken 
from selected people with the early stages of AIDS and injected into other 
people "with full-blown AIDS" to see if the antibodies curb the disease. 
</P>
<P>
But Asher hasn't been in the blood business for 20 years without learning how 
to size up the odds. An AIDS breakthrough that would benefit his business "is a 
big if," he said.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: PUERTO RICAN BANK OKS FINANCING FOR HOH PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOH Water Technology said it has received approval in principle for $2 million 
in financing from Economic Development Bank of Puerto Rico. The financing is 
intended to help the fledgling Newbury Park company set up a manufacturing 
plant in Puerto Rico to manufacture its water purification systems for 
residential and commercial use. 
</P>
<P>
The financing is conditional until the consulting firm Arthur D. Little 
concludes its report on the market potential of HOH's products. That report is 
expected to be completed next month. 
</P>
<P>
If the financing is completed, Economic Development Bank would lend HOH $1.5 
million and invest $500,000 in the company. HOH has recently been suffering 
from a cash crunch. Company President David Kravitz said the company hopes to 
be in production within six months after receiving the financing. 
</P>
<P>
The Puerto Rican government often lends money to companies that locate 
factories there in an effort to create jobs.

Connie Chung's agent said Monday she is "close" to making a decision about 
whether to stay at NBC (her contract expires in late May) or jump to CBS. 
Alfred Geller wouldn't hint at which way she's leaning, and muddied the 
speculative waters further by saying if she does go to CBS, she might not work 
on either "West 57th" or "60 Minutes." Rumors have circulated that she was 
headed for one or the other of those CBS magazine shows. CBS has yet to replace 
Diane Sawyer who left "60 Minutes" last month for a new job at ABC. ALEENE

What's new at the Smithsonian? How about the complete skeleton of a 
70-million-year-old shark, an antique Torah mantle from a California synagogue, 
the drum set of the late jazzman Buddy Rich, a small bronze sculpture by Rodin, 
and two live Komodo dragons. These are among the 466,181 items acquired last 
year by the Smithsonian Institution, where everything old is new again. 
However, only a tiny percentage of the total of about 134 million objects, 
artworks and specimens in its collections are on display in the Smithsonian's 
museums. The bulk of the items, some 118 million, are scientific specimens 
housed in the National Museum of Natural History, where they are used 
extensively in research. ALEENE MacMINN

LENTEN SEASON IS HIGHLIGHTED BY CHORAL CONCERT AT CHURCH

Even if churches have relinquished their historic role as patron of the arts, 
the archaic liturgical calendar still provides occasions to present concerts of 
choral music that were once integral to worship. Sunday night, a week before 
Easter, the San Diego Master Chorale presented a pleasantly eclectic program of 
music for Lent and Easter at the downtown First Presbyterian Church. 
</P>
<P>
Chorale music director Frank Almond organized his program around the reflective 
Faure Requiem and Mozart's jubilant "Coronation Mass," K 317. The well-trained, 
robust 120-voice chorus proved more adept at touting the confident cadences of 
Mozart than probing Faure's fervent devotional lyricism. Although the Mass 
sparkled with dramatic conviction and rhythmic vivacity, at times the sheer 
brio Almond encouraged from the full chorus verged on a raucous clamor more 
suited to the operatic stage. Nevertheless, the Mass performance was both 
appealing and stylish. 
</P>
<P>
Notable for warmth of tone and ensemble balance was the solo group, soprano 
Anna Carson, alto Fran Bjorneby, tenor Jose Medina, and bass Cleve Genzlinger. 
Their shapely, sympathetic phrasing made the Benedictus a high point of the 
Mass, along with Carson's fluent, radiant solo that opened the Agnus Dei. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Plimpton, resident organist at the Presbyterian Church, provided a 
brilliantly idiomatic accompaniment, adapting Mozart's colorful orchestral 
score to the church's mighty Casavant organ. His dexterity and clever organ 
registrations were models of tasteful keyboard accompanying. 
</P>
<P>
Almond's Faure Requiem was thoughtfully crafted, but it did not convey a sense 
of mystery or urgency. Without conveying the earnest supplication that lies 
just beneath the surface of the composer's suave, late Romantic idiom, the work 
remained austere, even bland. If Almond's phrasing had been more flexible, more 
generous, perhaps it would not have sounded so emotionally uninvolved. 
</P>
<P>
Although Genzlinger retains the fine color of his voice, he appeared weak and 
slightly intimidated by the demands of his two extended solos in the Faure. 
Carson did not soar in the "Pie Jesu," and Plimpton was less adept in making 
the organ accompaniment sound like the composer's constantly fluctuating 
orchestral score. Harpist Sheila Stirling and violinist Karen Dirks added some 
welcome obbligatos in several movements. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the program included two strongly delineated motets from Francis 
Poulenc's "Four Motets for a Time of Penitence" and the Sanctus from Charles 
Gounod's "Saint Cecilia Mass." The last was added to the concert to provide a 
showpiece for tenor soloist Medina. Since he sang his solo with his head down 
-- his eyes glued to his score -- not even his innate opulent tone could 
compensate for his insecurity, which undermined the whole purpose of inserting 
this chestnut into the program.

BUSH SET TO ATTACK FED IF IT RISKS A RECESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush is becoming increasingly worried that any further efforts by the 
Federal Reserve to contain inflation by raising interest rates might also 
produce a recession, officials familiar with the President's thinking said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has decided that he will attack the Federal Reserve publicly, according to 
these sources, if interest rates rise so high that they threaten an economic 
downturn. 
</P>
<P>
However, especially after the latest jump in wholesale prices, Bush reportedly 
understands the Fed's concern about inflation. 
</P>
<P>
And, in part to ward off complaints that the Administration overstated its 
criticism of the Fed earlier this year, the sources said, he is likely in the 
immediate future to speak out in support of the Fed's efforts to stem economic 
growth by tightening credit. 
</P>
<P>
Fed officials, who have tightened credit over the last year by enough to push 
short-term rates up more than 3 percentage points, have indicated recently that 
they would like to postpone any further interest rate hikes to see if the 
actions already taken will be successful in dampening inflationary fires. 
</P>
<P>
But both the White House and the Fed were jolted by last Friday's report that, 
in February, wholesale prices rose by 1% for the second month in a row. 
Inflation at that level, a 12.6% rate if it continues for a full year, also 
sent Wall Street reeling, not only on Friday but on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, wholesale prices rose roughly 4%. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials are bracing for today's report on consumer prices, 
which is expected to show about a 0.5% increase for February. If the consumer 
price index is up significantly more than that, however, Wall Street could be 
knocked for another loop and the Fed would be under much greater pressure to 
tighten credit another notch. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average dropped 29.64 points Monday to close at 2,262.50. 
(Details in Business.) 
</P>
<P>
Although price increases are expected to moderate in the months ahead, the 
recent signs of escalating inflation seem to have vindicated the Fed's repeated 
efforts to resort to high interest rates in its campaign to cool the economy 
and contain inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Publicly, Bush Administration officials were careful Monday to avoid any 
criticism of the independent Federal Reserve, but they sought also to play down 
inflation fears. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said that, despite the recent inflation 
figures, other economic indicators "that are equally important" are pointing to 
a moderation of inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Praises Greenspan 
</P>
<P>
But, when pressed during a morning television interview on whether the Fed 
should back off from its policy of pushing interest rates higher in response to 
signs of inflation, Brady said: 
</P>
<P>
"The Fed has got a very competent chairman in Alan Greenspan . . . . He has to 
do what he has to do." 
</P>
<P>
He added that, if the Administration is successful in its goal of reducing the 
federal deficit, "that will take care of a lot of the worries." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Michael J. Boskin, Bush's chief economic adviser, told 
reporters that the 1% back-to-back wholesale price hikes are aberrations caused 
by sharp increases in food and oil costs. "The inflation numbers of spring and 
summer will be lower than what we have seen in the last couple of months," 
Boskin said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inflation Discounted 
</P>
<P>
And, in case anyone still misunderstood the message, White House Press 
Secretary Marlin Fitzwater stated: "At this point, we see no long-term rise in 
inflation." 
</P>
<P>
Such statements represent de-escalation from a series of Administration 
statements earlier this year challenging the steady increase in interest rates 
engineered by the Fed. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's own campaign of public criticism of the Fed's anti-inflation drive began 
less than a week after he took office from former President Ronald Reagan, who 
had personally avoided public criticism of the central bank, even during the 
early years of his Administration, when high interest rates knocked the economy 
into a deep recession. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to see us move so strongly against fear of inflation that we 
impede growth," Bush said in late January, only a day after Greenspan had told 
Congress that current inflation rates "clearly are too high and must be brought 
down." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disagreement Played Down 
</P>
<P>
In the days that ensued, Administration officials -- although playing down any 
sharp disagreement with the Fed -- echoed Bush's remarks. "I personally don't 
believe that the inflationary threat is as great as some there believe it is at 
the moment," Budget Director Richard G. Darman said late last month. 
</P>
<P>
Darman, who is counting on a combination of strong growth and lower interest 
rates to help carry out Bush's vow to balance the budget by the end of his 
first term without a tax increase, warned against "a policy that is oriented 
toward nothing but monetary tightening."

COCAINE VICTIMS; 
</P>
<P>
PROSTITUTES: EASY PREY FOR KILLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
She was found in the mud by children looking for discarded spray cans among the 
unfinished concrete pillars and dirt mounds of a Century Freeway construction 
site. They stumbled upon the crumpled body of Renatha Yvette Simpson not far 
from the Figueroa Street corners where she had sold herself, $10 at a time, to 
buy cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
A week after Simpson's 24th birthday last November, she became a Los Angeles 
homicide statistic, fitting a familiar category of victim -- women involved to 
at least some degree in prostitution. An average of more than one prostitute a 
month is killed in the city, 69 all told in the four years from 1985 through 
1988, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's the highest-risk occupation there is," Cmdr. William Booth 
said. "Mercenaries are way behind prostitutes. . . . There is just nothing that 
carries the risk with it, in peacetime, as streetwalking prostitution." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Death on the Streets 
</P>
<P>
Recent reports that a serial killer has been preying on Southside prostitutes 
and last month's arrest of a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy accused of 
killing three streetwalkers last year are but a part of the story of death on 
the city's dingy prostitution strips. 
</P>
<P>
Ready-made victims almost by definition, streetwalkers have become even more 
vulnerable since crack cocaine laid claim to the inner city. Crack has 
dramatically altered the streetwalking scene as women forsake caution and the 
protection of pimps to hustle for the next high, police and people who work 
with prostitutes say. 
</P>
<P>
At times they are so drug-dazed that they fail to recognize undercover vice 
officers who have repeatedly arrested them, much less the subtle danger signals 
of a potential killer. Rather than taking their customers to the relative 
security of a motel room, they often drive down the block to park in the dark, 
down a dead end street or next to a vacant lot. It's cheaper and quicker. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anonymous Corpses 
</P>
<P>
When they turn up dead, dumped into an alley or parking lot, their lives on the 
streets offer few clues as to who ended them. They arrive at the morgue as Jane 
Does, their past frequently an unreliable web of aliases, temporary addresses 
and false birth dates. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all out here doing it for drugs. Cocaine is our pimp," said Mary, a 
husky-voiced hooker eating a pink Popsicle on Figueroa Street, a bleakly 
monotonous strip of commerce, salvation and escape. Motels, liquor stores, 
storefront churches and auto salvage yards abound. Day or night, streetwalkers 
saunter up and down the dirty sidewalks, alone or in twos and threes, hopefully 
scanning passing cars for a "date." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, "Renee" Simpson's fall to Figueroa was precipitated by cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"The girl was on it very bad," said Winnett Price, who shared a crowded South 
Broadway apartment with her family and Simpson in the weeks before Simpson's 
death. "I used to sit and talk to her about it and say all this is not 
necessary. . . . I tried to tell her to slow down. She'd sit there and listen 
and cry for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Simpson worked with Price's mother and sister on a crew that cleaned office 
buildings. When she was finished, she would go home, eat a big meal and wait 
until midnight. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like she had a job. . . . She'd be in and out the door from 12 to 5 in 
the morning," Price said. Simpson would work the streets, get some cocaine, go 
back to her room, and when she needed more crack, return to the dimly lit 
street corners to smile at cruising men. In that part of Los Angeles, drug 
dealers are never far away. 
</P>
<P>
If Price warned her of the risks she was taking, Simpson would laugh: "I can 
handle it." 
</P>
<P>
She lived, after all, in a world where 2-year-olds are slaughtered in their 
front yards in drive-by gang shootings, where the next customer may have AIDS 
(acquired immune deficiency syndrome), where an argument can quickly flare into 
a brutal knifing. 
</P>
<P>
To a 37-year-old woman arrested for prostitution one night last week, the 
danger of what she was doing isn't much greater "than waking up every morning 
and stepping out the door. You don't know what's going to happen. You walk down 
the street and every day somebody's getting killed." 
</P>
<P>
She was an out-of-work, licensed vocational nurse who has been on cocaine for 
nine years. Now and then, she says, she would take a ride with a stranger to a 
motel room for a quick $10. It will buy enough rock cocaine to keep her high 
for an hour. 
</P>
<P>
She was arrested in the parking lot of a motel, chilled bottle of peach wine 
cooler in hand, by a Southeast Division vice detail. 
</P>
<P>
The same detail picked up Simpson last Nov. 11, three weeks before she was 
killed. It was around midnight. Simpson stood at the intersection of 99th 
Street and Figueroa, surrounded by a weedy vacant lot, a fenced-in auto 
transmission shop and two stucco houses. 
</P>
<P>
"You want a date?" she asked the undercover vice officer when he pulled up. To 
his "yes" she replied, "Take me down the street." She wanted $10 in exchange 
for a quick sex act, according to the police report. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called a Standout 
</P>
<P>
In the vice office, they remember Simpson. "She stood out," Sgt. Steve Grenier 
said. "She was not the regular prostitute." She had some class and seemed to 
come from a pretty good family. She smiled for her mug shot and thanked the 
undercover officers who arrested her. She was going to beat her cocaine habit. 
The arrest would help turn her life around. 
</P>
<P>
"She was living in a dream world where she thought she was going to get out of 
this," Grenier said. 
</P>
<P>
Every night the sergeant sees women who haven't gotten out, women whose 
drug-ravaged faces line the pages of the vice mug book. Antoinette's decline is 
documented in color. She's a 22-year-old coke freak who has been arrested 10 
times for prostitution. In her first booking photo, taken in 1984, her gaze is 
soft and attractive. Four years later, she stares into the camera with 
washed-out eyes. Her face is scarred and haggard. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of these girls are just like zombies," Grenier said. "The men are able 
to pick them up time and time again." 
</P>
<P>
When they're arrested, "They normally don't have any ID, or jewelry. They don't 
have anything. A lot of them don't have a place to stay that night. . . . 
They're just going from rock to rock." 
</P>
<P>
The greater their appetite for cocaine, the more easily victimized they are. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me, and I have no statistics, like more prostitutes are being 
killed now than before," said Los Angeles Homicide Detective Pat Marshall, who 
works in South-Central Los Angeles, where 41 of the 69 prostitutes slain in the 
last four years were killed. "When cocaine became very, very prevalent . . . 
then we started seeing more and more being injured or killed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Just Happen 
</P>
<P>
While Booth said some of the 69 prostitute slayings are likely related, police 
say the killings are often just a product of drugs, temper or a soured business 
deal. A customer will demand his money back after he has had sex, a 
streetwalker will try to rob the john, an argument will erupt and turn violent. 
</P>
<P>
"These girls are at the whim of any psycho who wants to do something to them," 
observed Capt. Jim Docherty, commanding officer of the LAPD's administrative 
vice section. 
</P>
<P>
There are no official estimates of the number of prostitutes in Los Angeles. 
The number of citywide prostitution arrests has more than doubled in the last 
decade, from 3,644 in 1978 to 7,975 in 1988, but LAPD officials say that may 
simply reflect increased police activity, rather than increased prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
Police sweeps have greatly reduced streetwalking in Hollywood, police say, 
leaving the gritty main drags of South-Central the city's streetwalking center. 
Elsewhere in Los Angeles, prostitution tends to take more sophisticated, 
expensive and less hazardous forms, such as escort services. 
</P>
<P>
The Friday before Simpson was killed, she phoned her mother, Josann Davidson, 
and told her, "Mama, I love you." 
</P>
<P>
"She would not let a month go by without being in touch," recalled Davidson, 
sitting in her Inglewood apartment a few feet from a large color photograph of 
Renee, looking sunny and cheerful. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson's mother and stepfather, Joe Davidson, never knew for a fact that she 
was using drugs, but they had suspected it ever since she was in her early 
teens. "She never did want me to see that side of her. She always hid that from 
me," Davidson said. Her daughter left the Davidsons' well-kept home more than 
two years ago, when they voiced their suspicions and told her they would not 
tolerate drug use. She stayed with relatives, including a favorite aunt, but 
they too eventually asked her to leave. Then Price's family took her in. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kept in the Dark 
</P>
<P>
The Davidsons did not know that Simpson had been arrested for prostitution. "If 
I'd known that (she was streetwalking), I would have stepped in," said Joe 
Davidson. "She would have known we knew about it." 
</P>
<P>
Simpson grew up in a solid working-class household in Compton. Her stepfather, 
who had taken care of her since she was a toddler, is a master aircraft 
mechanic. Her mother is a beautician. A half-brother attended college. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson's street life, Joe Davidson said, was something "she chose. She had all 
the opportunities of any young lady around." 
</P>
<P>
She dropped out of high school in the 11th grade, later obtained an equivalency 
degree and enrolled in the Job Corps. But she never managed to hold more than a 
string of menial jobs. "She wanted to be better, but I don't think she was 
willing to take the step to be better," Josann Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Renee was a very sensitive person. She felt rejected a lot, she felt unloved, 
no matter what we did," Davidson continued. Her daughter wanted the fast life 
and "I wasn't a fast-life-type person." 
</P>
<P>
"Renee always viewed me as a strict, stern mother." 
</P>
<P>
Detective Marshall started working homicide 13 years ago. Then, he said, a girl 
"had a pimp. She hung out with other girls." If she was found dead, "We had 
avenues of investigation. . . . You don't have that with a prostitute who's a 
strawberry (the street name for a woman who exchanges sex for drugs). They're 
not hanging out with anybody. 
</P>
<P>
"No one knows what they're doing," he said. Detectives encounter a litany of "I 
don't knows" when they question relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 69 prostitute slayings recorded since 1985, police say only 22 have been 
solved. "I would not say we as investigators have a great deal of success in 
solving prostitute-related murders," said Detective Paul Mize of the LAPD's 
South Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
It is not, they insist, that they are not trying. Rather, they say that in many 
prostitute killings they are confronted with a dearth of leads and a surplus of 
frustrations. 
</P>
<P>
"The obvious difficulty in working these cases is nobody cares," Mize 
commented. The woman's family cares, but the street community is hardly 
scribbling down the license plate numbers of suspicious looking drivers. "There 
are rarely any eyewitnesses, and if there are, they make themselves invisible." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Computerized Data 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department did not computerize homicide records until 1985, and 
officials say they thus have no way of knowing whether prostitute-related 
slayings are on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. John Zorn, a member of the "Southside Slayer" task force formed a number of 
years ago, when it appeared that a serial killer was preying on Southside 
prostitutes, says he doesn't think there has been an increase in the killing of 
street women. But he concedes, "The situation has not changed a great deal over 
the period of time (since the task force was formed). The problem still exists 
that there are murders of these women." 
</P>
<P>
The task force compiled a list of 17 women, most of them prostitutes, strangled 
or stabbed on the Southside between 1983 and 1986. Then "we established there 
was not a serial killer, that we were looking for a number of suspects," and 
they stopped keeping a list. 
</P>
<P>
Arrests were made in four of the 17 cases. There was one conviction, an Alabama 
prisoner is accused of killing one woman, and Louis Craine, an unemployed 
construction worker, is going on trial this month in the strangulation murders 
of five Southside prostitutes between 1984 and 1987, including two on the 
Southside Slayer list. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shooting Deaths 
</P>
<P>
Last month reports surfaced that Los Angeles police were investigating another 
possible serial killer who may have shot as many as 12 Southside prostitutes 
during the last three years. Police have refused to comment, but they recently 
arrested Rickey Ross, a veteran sheriff's deputy, on charges that he fatally 
shot three prostitutes late last year and dumped their bodies in South Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Zorn said, "I don't have evidence to indicate there are a large number 
of serial killers preying on prostitutes." 
</P>
<P>
Renee Simpson was strangled and left in the dirt at a freeway construction site 
that has obliterated part of the graffiti-smeared neighborhood where she last 
lived and bought drugs. Toxicological tests revealed there was cocaine in her 
blood when she was killed. No arrests have been made in her case. 
</P>
<P>
On the back of the program for her Dec. 5 funeral service is a tribute from her 
aunt La Verne: "Renee, you have gone home to rest and you have no more worries. 
. . . Your sweet smile, your dancing eyes, I will miss, and my beloved niece, 
Renee, I will always love you."

Rejecting a charge of second-degree murder, an Orange County Superior Court 
jury found Danny David Ornelas, 19, guilty of gross vehicular manslaughter 
while intoxicated in the Sept. 1 death of a Newport Beach woman, who was 
standing in an alley with her two children when she was struck by his speeding 
car. Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Goethals argued that a videotape shot by a 
passenger in the car proved that the Huntington Park man deliberately swerved 
the car to hit Debbie Killelea, 37. But defense attorney Ralph Bencangey of 
Beverly Hills contended that the tape proves that Ornelas tried to avoid the 
woman. If the jury had convicted Ornelas of second-degree murder, he could have 
been sentenced to up to life in prison. The manslaughter conviction carries a 
maximum penalty of 10 years, with eligibility for parole after five. Judge Luis 
A. Cardenas ordered Ornelas, who had been free on $100,000 bail, to jail 
pending sentencing May 2.

A federal judge, turning aside a plea for "desperate measures" against 
drug-related violence, temporarily barred Washington from enforcing a curfew 
aimed at keeping most teen-agers away from open-air drug markets late at night. 
U.S. District Judge Charles B. Richey, in issuing a 10-day temporary 
restraining order at the request of the American Civil Liberties Union, ruled 
that the overnight curfew law could unfairly penalize thousands of youths and 
result in "permanent and irreparable injury" to those detained unfairly. The 
District of Columbia Council's emergency law would have banned youths under the 
age of 18 from gathering on city streets after 11 p.m. Sunday through Thursday 
and after midnight Friday and Saturday. The curfew would have ended at 6 a.m. 
daily.

European Community foreign ministers decided in Brussels that member nations 
may send their ambassadors back to Iran, but a ban on high-level visits will 
continue, Geoffrey Howe of Britain said. The 12 nations recalled their envoys 
Feb. 20 in response to the order by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini that author 
Salman Rushdie, a British citizen born in India, be killed for blaspheming 
Islam in his novel, "The Satanic Verses." Britain closed its Tehran mission in 
protest, and Iran broke relations with London early this month. Declaring that 
"there is no change in our position," Howe said Britain's mission will remain 
closed. Rushdie remains in hiding.

Gunmen killed two senior Northern Ireland police officers in an ambush near the 
Irish Republic, and the outlawed Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility. 
Chief Supt. Harry Breen and his deputy, Bob Buchanan, in charge of border 
security with the Royal Ulster Constabulary, were returning to Newry from a 
security meeting with Irish police chiefs across the border in Dundalk when 
they were shot, police said. In Belfast, gunmen stormed a house and killed 
David Braniff, 63, a Roman Catholic father of 13 as he and his wife, Mary, were 
saying their prayers.

Ships searched the Gulf of Mexico around two badly burned oil platforms but 
found no trace of seven men missing after explosions and fires swept through 
the platforms Sunday night. Thirty-five men escaped the blazing platforms, 
according to the Coast Guard. Ten of those were injured, two critically. The 
side-by-side oil production platforms just off the southeast tip of Louisiana 
were about 50 to 100 feet apart, with living quarters on one. The Coast Guard 
said men were working on natural gas lines at the time fire erupted, but a 
spokesman for owner Atlantic Richfield Co. said the cause of the blaze was 
unknown. The spokesman had no assessment of damage.

The Soviet Union said that some of its medium-range nuclear missile bases will 
be converted to intercontinental missile bases. The conversion is allowed under 
the terms of the U.S.-Soviet Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty, and Moscow has 
informed the United States of its plans, Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim 
Perfilyev told a Moscow news conference. He said SS-20 medium-range missiles 
deployed at the bases are being scrapped in accordance with the INF treaty and 
that the bases will be re-equipped to hold SS-25 intercontinental ballistic 
missiles. Perfilyev did not say how many bases are being converted or disclose 
their location.

Researchers from Iowa State University have come up with a water-soluble form 
of Vitamin A that they say is easily absorbed by the body and is safer for 
treatment of acne and wrinkles than other approved forms. The findings of their 
research into Vitamin A, also called retinol, were reported at a meeting of the 
Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology in New Orleans. Other 
derivatives of Vitamin A, soluble in fats, oils and alcohols, are toxic if 
consumed in large amounts and some believe they could lead to birth defects. 
Drugs that have been approved to treat acne and wrinkling, such as Retin A and 
Accutane, contain forms of retinoic acid.

It cost taxpayers more than $51.8 million to run the state Senate during the 
12-month period that ended Nov. 30, 1988, a 7.2% increase over the previous 
year. The 40 members of the upper house reported spending $18.6 million on 
their own office operations, $15.8 million on committees and research, $1.9 
million for caucus and floor leader activities, and $15.5 million on general 
overhead and support services. For the second year in a row, Sen. Henry J. 
Mello (D-Watsonville) led other senators in office expenses with $715,280. 
Senators' office expenditures covered such items as car leases, travel, 
district office space, employee salaries, telephones, postage, newsletters, 
office supplies, furniture and equipment.

Several thousand people demonstrated in the capital of Soviet Uzbekistan to 
press demands that Uzbek be made the republic's official language, an official 
of the Uzbek news agency Uztag said. The official told Reuters news agency that 
the crowds gathered in front of government house in central Tashkent where they 
were addressed by the republic's newly appointed president, Mirzaolim 
Ibragimov. Ibragimov, 61, told the crowd that a special working commission has 
been set up to look into the issue and said authorities want people to send in 
suggestions on how to solve the problem. Russian is still the state language in 
most of the 15 Soviet Republics but there has been pressure for change.

HIGH COURT ALLOWS IMMUNITY FOR STATE IN COPYRIGHT SUITS

The Supreme Court, exposing a loophole in federal copyright law, said Monday 
that book publishers, composers, film makers and computer programmers may not 
go to court to charge state universities, public schools, libraries and other 
public agencies with illegally using their copyrighted works. 
</P>
<P>
The high court action, in denying an appeal from a computer software firm, 
could mean a loss of millions of dollars in fees for companies whose 
copyrighted products are used illegally by government agencies, copyright 
holders said. 
</P>
<P>
The justices left standing a ruling by the federal appeals court in California, 
which said that the Constitution forbids damage suits against states or state 
agencies unless Congress has specifically said otherwise. In the 1976 Copyright 
Act, Congress said that all damage suits for copyright infringements must go 
into federal courts -- not state courts -- but it said nothing about allowing 
states to be sued. 
</P>
<P>
The unintended result, said the appellate court, is to "allow states to violate 
the federal copyright laws with virtual immunity." 
</P>
<P>
The Assn. of American Publishers, the Information Industry Assn., the Music 
Publishers Assn. and the major Hollywood film corporations, among others, urged 
the high court to hear a test suit against UCLA and to overturn the appellate 
court ruling. But without comment, the appeal was denied (BV Engineering vs. 
UCLA, 88-1099). 
</P>
<P>
"The Supreme Court has allowed this (1976) law to be gutted," said Michael A. 
Ladra, a Palo Alto lawyer who represented BV Engineering, a computer software 
maker. "I guess they are saying it is up to Congress to change the law." 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, BV Engineering sued UCLA, contending that its professors had illegally 
copied seven of its computer programs. But Judge Harry L. Hupp dismissed the 
suit on grounds that UCLA, as an agency of the state, is immune from federal 
suits under the 11th Amendment. Last year, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of 
Appeals in Pasadena affirmed that conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Possible Threat Cited 
</P>
<P>
These rulings "permit a state university to purchase one copy of a computer 
program and provide unlimited copies to each of its students," Ladra said in 
his brief to the court. "Such an outcome would be financially devastating to 
authors of copyrighted works and threatens the future of emerging intellectual 
property industries." 
</P>
<P>
The publishers and the film corporations complained in their briefs that state 
prisons, libraries, state hospitals and schools regularly violate the 1976 laws 
by illegally copying books or videos. 
</P>
<P>
University lawyers deny that copyrighted materials are often misused. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no widespread abuses of the copyright law that we know of," said UC 
attorney George Marchand. UCLA professors, he added, thought it was legal to 
make some copies of the BV Engineering program and they immediately quit the 
copying program when the company objected. 
</P>
<P>
In other actions, the court: 
</P>
<P>
* Let stand a federal appellate court ruling from California that forbids 
cities, school boards and counties to use at-large election districts if they 
have the effect of discriminating against minority candidates (Watsonville vs. 
Gomez, 88-1236). 
</P>
<P>
The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, in a suit by the Mexican American Legal 
Defense and Educational Fund against the city of Watsonville, said that 
Watsonville discriminated against Latinos by electing its seven-member city 
council through citywide elections rather than through districts. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Joaquin Avila of Fremont, who won the case in the appeals court, said 
that the outcome may force many California localities to switch to district 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
* Agreed to let an attorney for the Bush Administration join the April 26 oral 
argument in a Missouri abortion case (Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services, 
88-605). Lawyers for Missouri are seeking to revive their state law prohibiting 
the use of public facilities or employees for assisting in abortion. The 
Administration is seeking a much broader ruling that would overturn the 1973 
Roe vs. Wade decision that made abortion legal. 
</P>
<P>
* Turned down an appeal from "Freeway Killer" William Bonin, who was convicted 
of murdering 14 young men in Los Angeles and Orange counties in 1979 and 1980. 
Bonin, who is now on Death Row at San Quentin, contended that the instructions 
given to his jury were unfair. 
</P>
<P>
On a 7-2 vote, the justices dismissed the appeal (Bonin vs. California, 
88-6341) without comment. Justices William J. Brennan Jr. and Thurgood Marshall 
routinely dissent in all death penalty cases in the belief that capital 
punishment is barred by the 8th Amendment. A public defender in Los Angeles 
says that he expects to file further appeals on Bonin's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
* Agreed to decide whether the Constitution's protection of religious freedom 
forbids a state to fire a drug counselor who ate an illegal hallucinogenic drug 
as part of a religious service. The case concerns two American Indians who were 
fired from their jobs and denied unemployment benefits after they used peyote 
at a religious ceremony (Employment Division vs. Smith, 88-1213). 
</P>
<P>
* Allowed the partial merger of Detroit's two newspapers to proceed (Michigan 
Citizens for an Independent Press vs. Thornburgh, A-695). Former Atty. Gen. 
Edwin Meese III authorized the merger of the business operations on the grounds 
that either the Detroit Free Press and the Detroit News would fail without 
relief. A group of advertisers, employees and readers urged the court to block 
the merger, but their request was denied.

WORK ON I-5 IS DELAYED BY SHORTAGE OF FUNDS

Construction on portions of the massive Interstate 5 widening project in Orange 
County will be delayed at least three months because of a shortage in state 
highway funds, California Department of Transportation officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
By accelerating construction and administrative procedures, officials said they 
may still be able to finish the project on time, although the initial delay 
will exhaust what little leeway had been built into the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"Of all our projects this is the one we're most concerned about," said Keith 
McKean, director of Caltrans District 12 in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The project is one of many throughout the state that has been identified by 
department officials as being subject to delay because of a projected 
$3.2-billion shortage in state transportation funds. Officials disclosed last 
week that the shortages would force them to begin cutting back projects in 
July, but at that time they did not specify which projects were to be affected. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Possible Postponement 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, meanwhile, officials said there were no projects that 
would immediately be affected by the new policy. In San Diego County, officials 
said, the final stages of construction on two freeway interchanges face 
possible postponement. 
</P>
<P>
"The projects we have identified really cover the whole length and breadth of 
the state -- rural and urban, north and south," Caltrans spokesman Jim Drago 
said. 
</P>
<P>
McKean said his concern in Orange County is that the delays could affect the 
sequencing of construction along Interstate 5 so that some stages of the 
project may be completed ahead of others, thus creating traffic bottlenecks. 
</P>
<P>
The project will widen Interstate 5 -- one of the county's two major 
north-south arteries -- from six to 10 lanes except in areas where auxiliary 
lanes will be constructed to make it 12 lanes across. The freeway is one of the 
most congested in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Revised Schedule 
</P>
<P>
The widening from Interstate 405 to California Highway 55 was divided into four 
projects. Originally, the first contract was to be advertised for bidding in 
April, with the remaining to follow at two-week intervals. Contracts on all 
four projects were to have been awarded by the end of May. 
</P>
<P>
Under a revised schedule, McKean said the first project, from Interstate 405 to 
California Highway 133, will not be advertised until May. The second stage, 
from Highway 133 north to Jeffrey Road, will be advertised in June and the 
final two stages, from Jeffrey Road to Jamboree Boulevard and Jamboree to 
Highway 55, in August or September. 
</P>
<P>
McKean said highway officials also fear that there may be delays in two other 
Orange County projects -- the extension of the Costa Mesa Freeway (California 
Highway 55) from Wilson Street to 19th Street and the second stage of the 
reconstruction of the Interstate 5-Costa Mesa Freeway interchange from 
Interstate 5 north to 17th Street. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego County, officials said the final stage of construction of an 
interchange at Interstate 5 and California Highway 54 and an interchange at 
Interstate 8 and California Highway 125 may be delayed because of the money 
shortages. 
</P>
<P>
Drago said the delays in Northern California, where weather affects 
construction, may be more serious than the delays in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, a project that may be postponed from April until August 
may be nearing the end of the construction season. When temperatures drop to a 
certain point, he said, concrete cannot be poured, and when the ground becomes 
frozen earthwork cannot be completed. 
</P>
<P>
All the projects, he said, are still subject to final approval by the 
California Transportation Commission, which ultimately decides which ones will 
be advertised for bidding on schedule and which ones will not. He said those 
that are delayed in one bidding period will probably be given first priority in 
the next period.

NORTH DENIAL OF AIDING CONTRAS TOLD;

WITNESS CITES '86 WHITE HOUSE MEETING WITH CONGRESSMEN

Lt. Col. Oliver L. North once denied to a group of congressmen in a White House 
meeting that he had helped raise money for the rebels in Nicaragua, a 
congressional staff member testified Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas A. Latimer, staff director of the House Intelligence Committee, said 
that North's denials at the Aug. 6, 1986, "informal meeting" followed 
more-formal written denials from North's then-superior, Robert C. McFarlane, 
who was former President Ronald Reagan's national security adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Several witnesses have established that North, despite his denials, was working 
actively to raise money for the Contras and to provide them with military 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hamilton Testimony 
</P>
<P>
Latimer testified as a prosecution witness at North's federal court trial to 
support testimony given last month by the Intelligence Committee's former 
chairman, Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), who told of receiving misleading 
letters from McFarlane. McFarlane has testified that the letters were drafted 
by North at the National Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, former Rep. Michael D. Barnes (D-Md.), who headed a House Foreign 
Affairs subcommittee, told jurors that William J. Casey, the late CIA director, 
visited his office about the same time, apparently in an effort to put a Barnes 
staff member in a bad light. At the time, Barnes also was questioning the White 
House about North's actions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Talking to Sandinistas 
</P>
<P>
Barnes said Casey charged that staff member Victor Johnson had been talking to 
representatives of the leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua, against whom 
the Contras were waging guerrilla warfare. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony elicited by Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., North's attorney, Barnes said 
that Casey's accusation was "frivolous" because Johnson had properly told the 
Sandinistas that they must improve their human rights record and permit 
newspaper offices in Nicaragua to reopen if their government wished to gain 
favor in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if Johnson had leaked classified information to the Sandinistas, 
Barnes angrily told Sullivan: "There was never any allegation that Victor 
Johnson or any other member of my staff provided classified information in any 
form to the Nicaraguan government or any other government." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan has told jurors that North was following a formal policy of the Reagan 
Administration to withhold information from Congress about pro-Contra 
activities because "everyone knows Congress leaks like a sieve." 
</P>
<P>
The principal charges among 12 felony counts on which North is being tried are 
that he made false statements to Congress and obstructed congressional 
inquiries at a time when Congress had outlawed any direct or indirect U.S. 
military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Poindexter Not There 
</P>
<P>
Latimer said that members of Hamilton's committee had sought a 1986 meeting 
with North and John M. Poindexter, McFarlane's successor as national security 
adviser. The meeting was in the White House Situation Room, the highly secure 
"nerve center" of the NSC, Latimer said, but Poindexter did not show up, 
leaving North alone to answer the congressmen's questions. 
</P>
<P>
Glancing at notes he had taken at the meeting, Latimer testified that North 
insisted that "he had not violated any provisions" of the congressional ban and 
that he had been in touch with Contra leaders mainly to encourage improvements 
in their human rights program. 
</P>
<P>
Latimer said that North specifically denied that he had been working with 
Robert W. Owen and with retired Army Maj. Gen. John K. Singlaub to raise money 
for the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Both Owen and Singlaub have testified at North's trial about repeated contacts 
with North to raise private funds and channel military equipment to the 
Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by Sullivan, Latimer conceded that the meeting was considered 
"informal" because no transcript was made.

ROCKET FUEL FOR IRAN BLOCKED BY CUSTOMS; 
</P>
<P>
SHIPMENT OF CHEMICAL BARRED PENDING COURT HEARING NEXT WEEK 
</P>

<P>
The U.S. Customs Service, fighting intra-governmental resistance but meeting a 
Monday deadline in federal court, blocked for at least a week the shipment of a 
rocket-fuel component allegedly sought by Iran to propel about 300 missiles. 
</P>
<P>
In an extraordinary move, the Justice Department turned over to Customs Service 
lawyers the duty of opposing a Tampa shipper's bid to gain release of 286,000 
pounds of ammonium perchlorate, seized last year from an Iranian freighter in 
Rotterdam, the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
The chemical, now in short supply in the United States, is used as a 
rocket-fuel oxidizer in missiles ranging up to the giant MX. 
</P>
<P>
Customs attorneys filed papers with U.S. District Judge Sim Lake in Houston, 
tying up shipment of the chemical until a hearing next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A State Department Rebuff 
</P>
<P>
While the Justice Department was dropping out of the case -- and refusing 
publicly to say why -- the State Department was rebuffing the Customs Service 
on another front. It rejected a plea by Customs Commissioner William von Raab 
that a license to export the chemical be withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
Von Raab reacted angrily, saying in an interview: "The award for 'insensitive 
bureaucrat of the week' should go to the State Department because they are 
focusing on a lot of very questionable technical issues instead of the issue of 
this chemical going to a country with a history of terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
Von Raab said that mid-level State Department officials argued that the license 
was valid because the chemical was not yet in short supply when it was approved 
for export. The officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for the shipper, Girindus Corp. of Tampa, denied that his company 
was selling the chemical to Iran and called for its release. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Ayatollah Will Not Get It' 
</P>
<P>
"The ayatollah (Iran's leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini) will not get it 
if we get it back," said attorney Robert T. Givens. He suggested that the 
chemical was intended for use by North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
But Von Raab maintained that the shipment was clearly headed for Iran. He said 
that it was seized with the help of Dutch authorities last year because it had 
been transferred from an American vessel to an Iranian ship. 
</P>
<P>
"We have very good reason to believe this stuff was going to Iran," said Von 
Raab, an appointee of former President Ronald Reagan who is controversial for 
his outspokenness. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that from the shipping documents when it was sitting in the 
Netherlands," he continued. "The same parties are now involved, and it doesn't 
take a lot of genius to figure out where it will wind up if it is released." 
</P>
<P>
Givens charged that Customs has an "acute interest" in the case because it "now 
faces the extreme embarrassment of public exposure of the fact that the seizure 
was not the triumph of Customs over evil as initially reported" in a Customs 
publication. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead, it was only bureaucratic bumbling after all," Givens added in a 
letter to The Times, following disclosure of the controversy Sunday. "Any 
purported Customs interest in 'national security' at this time rings hollow, in 
view of the embarrassment factor." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Illegally Seized 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Judge Lake ruled that the chemical would have to be released to 
Girindus on Monday unless the government filed papers demanding that the 
shipment be forfeited to the government. Customs attorneys filed the documents, 
alleging that the shipper's bill of lading in January, 1988, gave a false 
destination of Basel, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
In his ruling March 9, Lake found tentatively that the shipment had been 
illegally seized by Customs, even if it was being diverted to Iran. The judge 
said that the government had not offered evidence of any such diversion. 
</P>
<P>
Lake declared that the Customs Service had no legal authority to seize the 
shipment because ammonium perchlorate, in its pure form, is not on the list of 
weapons-related items requiring a special license from the State Department 
before it can be sold. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials concede that the chemical was not on the munitions list in 1988 
when it was shipped from Houston to Rotterdam, although the Customs Service, at 
least, maintains that it has since been added. 
</P>
<P>
Von Raab argued that the license should be considered "on the basis of today's 
situation, not on what was done some time ago. We say cut through all the red 
tape and cancel the license because today we wouldn't have granted it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's a very good idea for us to be providing the Iranians with 
military chemicals." 
</P>
<P>
After learning of Customs' forfeiture move, Givens said that it "was 
unprecedented, to my knowledge" for the agency to take over a case from the 
Justice Department. "It sounds like a kamikaze flight to me."

Israeli jet fighters attacked bases of a PLO faction opposed to Yasser Arafat 
in eastern Lebanon on Monday, killing 10 guerrillas and 10 residents in the 
deepest thrust into Syrian-held territory this year, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth Israeli air raid on Lebanon this year coincided with the eighth day 
of Beirut sectarian violence sparked by opposition to Syrian military 
intervention. At least eight more people were killed in the fighting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Israeli planes fired rockets into two bases of the Popular Front 
for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command near the village of Bar Elias, 
six miles west of the Syrian border. The command is based in Damascus. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said Palestinian and Syrian anti-aircraft batteries opened fire on 
the raiding planes but missed. 
</P>
<P>
At least 20 people, including the 10 guerrillas, were killed and 20 others were 
wounded in three bombing runs carried out by six Israeli warplanes, police 
said. A small house near the bases was destroyed by rockets and all of its 10 
Lebanese inhabitants were killed, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Also among the dead was a member of the PFLP-GC's Central Committee, a 
spokesman for the group said. He refused to identify the official.

4 SOUTH AFRICAN DETAINEES FLEE HOSPITAL; 
</P>
<P>
EX-HUNGER STRIKERS GRANTED REFUGE IN WEST GERMAN EMBASSY

Four political detainees escaped Monday from a hospital where they were 
recuperating after a hunger strike and found refuge in the West German Embassy 
40 miles away. They demanded freedom for all activists being held without 
charge by the South African government. 
</P>
<P>
"We have commited no crime," the four men said in a statement issued by the 
Detainees Aid Center. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been kept in detention for so long that we felt we had to embark on a 
life-and-death hunger strike to secure our release. We (escaped) after it 
became clear there is no intention to release us." 
</P>
<P>
The four blacks, 21 to 28 years old, were leaders in youth organizations 
affiliated with the United Democratic Front, the country's largest 
anti-apartheid coalition. They had been held for periods ranging from eight 
months to nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Asylum Reported 
</P>
<P>
Their attorney, Priscilla Jana, said they were granted asylum by the West 
German Embassy. Embassy officials declined to comment except to say that the 
four had been allowed into the walled embassy mission a few blocks from South 
Africa's administrative headquarters in Pretoria, the capital, and that the 
embassy was in contact with the South African government. 
</P>
<P>
Roelof F. (Pik) Botha, the South African foreign minister, issued a statement 
saying that "the matter is receiving attention." He said it is regrettable that 
the men escaped when "only a relatively small number are still in detention and 
each case is being reviewed daily." 
</P>
<P>
Human rights activists estimate that 500 political activists remain in custody 
under the 33-month-old state of emergency. As many as 100 have been in jail for 
more than two years without trial, and about 30,000 have been detained for 
varying periods since June, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hunger Strike 
</P>
<P>
About 300 detainees have taken part in a hunger strike since Jan. 23, demanding 
that they be charged or released. The strike was suspended last month when the 
minister of law and order, Adriaan Vlok, agreed to review each detainee's case 
and release "a substantial number." 
</P>
<P>
The government says about 500 have been released in recent months, many under 
restrictions that inhibit their movement and prevent them from participating in 
political activity. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-apartheid leaders complain that too few have been freed and that dozens 
more people have been arrested since Vlok's pledge. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's incident marked the second time in six months that activists held 
without charge have slipped out of a hospital and sought refuge in a diplomatic 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 13, three prominent anti-apartheid leaders left a hospital where they 
were undergoing physical therapy and fled to the U.S. Consulate in 
Johannesburg. They left five weeks later after being assured by the government 
that no action would be taken against them. 
</P>
<P>
The four men involved Monday escaped from their guarded rooms in Johannesburg's 
Hillbrow Hospital. Their attorney said they took a taxi to the West German 
Embassy. The men waved to reporters from the embassy foyer. One was wearing a 
T-shirt bearing the message: "Release All Detainees. Support the Hunger 
Strikers." 
</P>
<P>
The four were identified as Ephraim Nkoe, 28, of the South African Youth 
Congress, who had been held eight months; Mpho Lekgoro, 24, of the 
Saulsville-Atteridgeville Youth Congress, held a year; Clive Radebe, 28, of the 
Soweto Youth Congress, held 16 months, and Job Sithole, 21, of the Alexandra 
Youth Congress, held 23 months.

SOCIALISTS ARE BIG WINNERS IN FRENCH MUNICIPAL VOTING 
</P>

<P>
Lyon and Paris were swept by candidates from the political right. Marseilles 
fell to a maverick brain surgeon who had been expelled from the Socialist Party 
for not following orders. 
</P>
<P>
So why was Socialist Premier Michel Rocard smiling so broadly Monday as final 
results of this weekend's nationwide municipal elections were announced? 
</P>
<P>
"It is a beautiful and full victory," said Rocard. 
</P>
<P>
Despite losing the three largest cities in France during the massive political 
exercise that concluded Sunday with a second and final round of voting, the 
Socialists emerged as the biggest overall winners in the 36,000 smaller towns 
and cities. 
</P>
<P>
Much more than in the United States, city halls in France form a political 
foundation for higher levels of government. Many Cabinet ministers, for 
example, also simultaneously serve as mayors. As a result, the every-six-years 
municipal vote is widely interpreted as a vote of confidence for the party in 
power. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recovered Lost Ground 
</P>
<P>
By recording a net gain of 23 city halls among the 390 French cities with more 
than 20,000 population, the Socialists of Rocard and President Francois 
Mitterrand nearly recovered all of their losses from the disastrous 1983 
municipal elections that led to a 1986 parliamentary defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more important, according to political analysts here, the Socialists 
were able to accomplish several other political objectives, including: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Expanding the Socialist Party's image as a centrist political force, 
acceptable to right and left, illustrated by victories in traditionally 
conservative cities such as Strasbourg. Several political commentators 
described the elections as the first fruit for the Mitterrand-Rocard strategy 
of ouverture to broaden the Socialist political base and lessen the party's 
dependence on its one-time Communist Party allies. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Continuing to isolate the Socialists' former allies in the Communist Party 
by refusing to join with them in several key races. The Communists suffered a 
net loss of 14 important cities, including Amiens. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Proving that the emerging power of the Ecologist (Greens) Party is not 
necessarily a threat to Socialist candidates. The Socialists won in Strasbourg 
despite the strong showing there by an Ecologist candidate. In other cities, 
the Socialists and the Ecologists reached electoral agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Effectively using the extreme right-wing National Front party to divide and 
disrupt the mainstream political right, notably the Gaullists, who refused to 
form an alliance with National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen but at the same 
time refused to condemn him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Divide and Rule' 
</P>
<P>
The Socialists, wrote political analysts Jean-Marie Colambani and Jean-Yves 
Lhomeau in the newspaper Le Monde, benefitted from "the classic strategy of 
divide and rule." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, one of the few right-wing heroes of the municipal elections staged his 
victory by taking a clear stance against Le Pen and the National Front. 
</P>
<P>
Michel Noir, 44, the upset winner in Lyon for the Rally for the Republic Party, 
won supporters to his side by categorically refusing any alliance with Le Pen. 
"Better to lose elections than to lose your soul," he pronounced. 
</P>
<P>
In Paris, former Rally presidential candidate Jacques Chirac lifted sagging 
conservative spirits a bit by sweeping all 20 of the city's districts for his 
second straight "grand slam" of the French capital since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Socialist Party egos were humbled somewhat by a similar sweeping victory in 
Marseilles by dissident candidate Robert Vigouroux, a laconic brain surgeon who 
had earlier been expelled by the Socialists for refusing to step aside for 
another candidate named by the party. 
</P>
<P>
But overall it was a Socialist wind that swept across France, giving the party 
a broader mandate than it had enjoyed before. 
</P>
<P>
Of 27 cities identified as "hot points" by the conservative Le Figaro newspaper 
before the second round of voting, the Socialist-led leftist candidates lost 
only two races to the right. Right-wing parties, however, lost six of the key 
races to the left. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no doubt that the Socialists would do better than they did in 1983," 
wrote Liberation editor Serge July, "but no one could have predicted a victory 
this clear."

CHERNOBYL STILL POSES PROBLEMS, PRAVDA WARNS

Radioactive contamination from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster is still 
causing problems, Pravda said Monday in an article that appeared to support 
fears that the fallout was worse than initially thought. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party newspaper published the first comprehensive map of the 
areas affected by the contamination and said some people wrongly thought that 
all the problems caused by the April, 1986, accident had been cleared up. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people who are trying to prove Chernobyl is in the past as if it is 
time to forget about it," Pravda said in a commentary accompanying an article 
by Yuri A. Izreal, chairman of the Soviet state committee on hydrometeorology. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, enormous work has been done but we should not relax now, because 
many years will be needed to put the tragedy into the past and the main task is 
to draw conclusions from the accident." 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-one people were killed as a result of an explosion and fire at the 
Chernobyl nuclear power station in the Ukraine, which sent a cloud of 
radioactive particles over Europe. 
</P>
<P>
A 1988 study showed 230,000 people were living in areas where contamination was 
higher than the maximum permitted level set by the Soviet government for those 
who live near the accident zone, Izreal wrote. 
</P>
<P>
This posed no danger to their health as long as uncontaminated food supplies 
were brought in from elsewhere and safety checks were continually carried out, 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
More than 3,800 square miles of Soviet territory had contamination levels 
exceeding the maximum permitted, Izreal said. 
</P>
<P>
The map in Pravda was the first to appear in the main Soviet press and the 
first to give an overview of the situation in the European part of the Soviet 
Union.

COMMON MARKET OKS RETURN OF ENVOYS TO IRAN

European Economic Community foreign ministers decided Monday that member 
nations may send their ambassadors back to Iran, but a ban on high-level visits 
will continue, Britain's foreign secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
The 12 Common Market nations recalled their envoys Feb. 20 in response to the 
order by Iran's leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, that author Salman 
Rushdie be killed. 
</P>
<P>
Khomeini and other Muslims believe that Rushdie -- a British citizen born in 
India -- blasphemed Islam in his novel "The Satanic Verses." The 88-year-old 
Iranian patriarch pronounced the death sentence Feb. 14. Rushdie, 41, has been 
in hiding since that time. 
</P>
<P>
Britain closed its Tehran mission altogether, and Iran broke relations early 
this month. Geoffrey Howe, the British foreign secretary, said Monday "there is 
no change in our own position" and the mission in Tehran will not reopen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Individual Decision 
</P>
<P>
At their regular monthly meeting in Brussels, the foreign ministers agreed to 
let each member country decide whether its ambassador would return to Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
"The strength and unity of our condemnation remains unqualified," Howe told 
reporters, referring to Khomeini's execution order. 
</P>
<P>
Ambassadors who return will carry protest messages reaffirming the community's 
view that death threats "are intolerable" and have no place in relations 
between nations, Howe said. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said that Ireland, Italy and Greece indicated they would 
return their envoys to the Iranian capital soon, but West Germany, the 
Netherlands and France said they have not decided. 
</P>
<P>
Howe said that a ban on high-level visits to Iran, part of the Feb. 20 decision 
to recall the ambassadors, remains in force. Iran responded to the recall by 
withdrawing its envoys from those countries.

'VOLUNTARY' WORK REWARDED BY SANDINISTAS, OTHERS REPORTED ABUSED;

<P>
FREED SOMOZA GUARDS DESCRIBE LIFE IN PRISON

<TEXT>
<P>
During nearly 10 years in a Sandinista prison for his service in the 
pre-revolutionary National Guard, Octavio Borgen had plenty of time to count. 
He said his jailers beat him 27 times. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-five times, the former captain recalled, he was put in a dark punishment 
cell with no room to lie down. Five times he was taken from his cell in Modelo 
Prison to El Chipote, a notorious interrogation center. Once he endured three 
days of hostile questioning without sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Until his release last Friday in a mass pardon of 1,894 former guards, Borgen 
said he was repeatedly castigated for his refusal to submit to prisoner 
"re-education," a regimen of daily labor and weekly political lectures aimed at 
adapting the soldiers of a defeated army to life under Sandinista rule. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from random interviews with 20 of the freed ex-guards, who were 
pardoned under a Central American peace agreement, the Sandinistas 
systematically abuse prisoners who do not work and reward those who do, even 
though the work program is supposedly voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Reason to Repent 
</P>
<P>
Many of those prisoners who worked said they did so to gain more freedom inside 
the jail and did not regard their decision as a sellout. All those interviewed 
said they did nothing criminal as guards and had no reason to repent. 
</P>
<P>
Former guards who refused to work spoke of imprisonment as an extreme test of 
their principles. 
</P>
<P>
"To accept re-education would have been to admit guilt and become a slave of 
the system," the 45-year-old Borgen told a visitor at home on his first full 
day of freedom. "But not to accept it meant to live for years in a situation of 
extreme tension." 
</P>
<P>
In an acknowledgement of its discriminatory treatment of prisoners, the 
government excluded 27 non-working inmates from last week's pardon. Under the 
Feb. 14 peace accord, all former guards were to be freed except those found 
guilty of serious crimes during the Sandinista-led uprising against President 
Anastasio Somoza in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
But in testimony before a National Assembly panel, the chief of Nicaragua's 
prison system asked that 29 be kept in jail for their "hostile attitude toward 
the re-education process." 
</P>
<P>
The Sandinista-dominated assembly voted to deny pardons to 27 of those 
prisoners. Twelve others were kept in jail on the basis of criminal records. 
Those 39 are serving 15- and 30-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
Most guards rejected prison labor until the mid-1980s. The holdouts eventually 
dwindled to about 700, but they were joined in their refusal to work by several 
hundred prisoners who are still held on charges of aiding the U.S.-backed 
Contras. 
</P>
<P>
All the non-working prisoners call themselves plantados, after the Cuban 
inmates who reject re-education by Fidel Castro's Communist government. 
</P>
<P>
As a matter of regulation, working prisoners are allowed family visits every 15 
days and may receive unlimited quantities of food from them. Non-workers get to 
see their families every 45 days, and food deliveries are limited to 15 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
At the Modelo Prison in Tipitapa, home for most anti-Sandinista prisoners, 
workers are kept in separate galleries with access to television and may hold 
special religious services, such as baptisms, outside the jail -- privileges 
denied to non-workers. Only workers are eligible for weekend furloughs. 
</P>
<P>
Non-workers are confined to their cells except for one hour of weekly exercise, 
while working prisoners leave every day to grow food, make army boots and 
uniforms, repair official vehicles, make car license plates and mix concrete 
for prefabricated government houses -- jobs for which they are paid a fraction 
of the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
Besides such formal distinctions, non-workers freed last week said they were 
subjected to physical and psychological pressures aimed at forcing them to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Those pressures ranged from beatings and confinement in punishment cells to 
such harassment as dumping prisoners' food on the floor and denying them access 
to visitors or to showers. 
</P>
<P>
One non-working prisoner said that he was deliberately kept in an ill-fitting 
uniform and that his sewing needle was seized when he tried to alter the fit. 
Others said working prisoners were infiltrated among the plantados to report 
violations of prison rules, such as reading the opposition newspaper La Prensa. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Jungle of Spies' 
</P>
<P>
"Our gallery was a jungle of spies," said Hazel Maraz, 26, a former guardsman 
freed last week. 
</P>
<P>
Americas Watch, a U.S.-based human rights organization, has criticized the 
Sandinistas for punishing prisoners for refusing to work. It objected to the 
decision to exclude 27 such prisoners from the pardon. 
</P>
<P>
"We have problems with keeping people in prison because of their behavior in 
prison," said Juan Mendez, a Washington spokesman for Americas Watch. "That 
behavior has nothing to do with guilt or innocence." 
</P>
<P>
But the Sandinista prison chief, Alvaro Guzman, said the 27 were punished for 
leading the resistance to re-education and threatening prisoners who worked. 
"This small group represents the essence of Somocismo (Somoza philosophy) 
inside the prison," Guzman said. 
</P>
<P>
Former plantados denied they had leaders. They said some of the 27 were denied 
pardons for having been high-ranking guard officers or writing letters from 
prison publicizing abusive treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"Our discipline was not that of a military hierarchy," said Borgen, the former 
guard captain. "The guard was finished, but we maintained our self-respect. The 
Sandinistas never understood this." 
</P>
<P>
Clara Obando, wife of the highest-ranking plantado, former National Guard Col. 
Silvio Mayorga, said her husband asked her advice on whether he should work, 
pointing out that she could visit him more often if he did. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him no," she said. "He is a trained engineer. I knew that if he worked 
with a machete, it would finish him morally." Mayorga was among those denied a 
pardon last week. 
</P>
<P>
Sandinista officials insist that prisoner re-education is for the protection of 
society because it teaches useful job skills to one-time enemy soldiers trained 
for little else but war. They say the political lectures are largely 
informative, like civics classes. 
</P>
<P>
"The revolution was made to free man of his negative habits, his deforming 
tendencies, his vices," Interior Minister Tomas Borge said in a recent speech 
defending the program. 
</P>
<P>
Some working prisoners freed last week said they viewed the program as 
positive. 
</P>
<P>
"It was quite useful, because we knew nothing, for example, about the 
Sandinista constitution," said Pedro Antonio Gonzalez, 27. "We began to see 
things more objectively." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez, a farm youth with a sixth-grade education when he joined the National 
Guard, said he decided to start prison work in 1985, after a spiritual 
conversion to Christianity. Partly to see his parents more often and partly to 
gain the "emotional freedom" to train himself as a pastor, he said he 
volunteered to learn to maintain prison vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't working for the regime but out of Christian love for my fellow man, 
to rid myself of hatred and rancor," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
The former guardsman spoke last Saturday evening after a Managua service of the 
Church of God, a Pentecostal sect headed in Nicaragua by a former guard officer 
pardoned in 1985. The church encouraged inmates to work and gained hundreds of 
converts in Modelo Prison after authorities gave it greater access to the jail. 
</P>
<P>
Non-working prisoners said they shunned the Church of God, calling it an arm of 
Sandinista propaganda. They also told of a different reaction to political 
education, saying it consisted of being insulted as unrepentant criminals. 
</P>
<P>
The contrast between the workers and the plantados was evident during the 
prisoner release ceremony last Friday. When prison officials in the grandstands 
were introduced, the workers, who had been placed in the front rows on a 
basketball court, applauded. The plantados, in the rear, were silent.

GROUP CALLS GOVERNOR'S ENVIRONMENTAL VETOES A RECORD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
There was a substantial increase last year in the number of environmental 
protection bills passed by the Legislature, but more than 60% of those bills 
were vetoed by Gov. George Deukmejian, a leading environmental lobbying group 
reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The California League of Conservation Voters, after consulting with the state's 
largest environmental organizations, gave generally high marks to the 
Legislature, which passed 20 bills supported by conservationists. That was more 
than double the number of environmentally oriented bills passed in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Among last year's successful bills was a landmark overhaul of California's 
Clean Air Act, granting wide authority to local air pollution control districts 
to reduce emissions from cars and industry. Other measures cited by the group 
were aimed at strengthening the motor vehicle inspection program and 
identifying the causes and effects of acid rain. 
</P>
<P>
Although Deukmejian signed these bills, the league called 1988 a "record year" 
for vetoes of environmental legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 20 environmental bills passed by the Legislature, 12 were vetoed by the 
governor. These include measures to prohibit oil drilling in state waters off 
Mendocino and Humboldt counties and ban chlorofluorocarbons, a group of 
chemicals found in aerosols and other manufactured products, which are linked 
to the destruction of the Earth's ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
"At no point had we seen a year when 20 (environmental) bills reached the 
governor's desk," said Lucy Blake, the league's executive director. "We 
consider the Legislature quite prolific, perhaps in response to the tremendous 
public concern over the environment." But, Blake added, Deukmejian "really has 
not been much of an ally in Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Record Defended 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the governor did not dispute the league's figures, but defended 
Deukmejian's environmental record. "If the governor vetoes a bill, there must 
be a good reason," said Deukmejian Press Secretary Kevin Brett. "The record 
speaks for itself. We consider this Administration's record on environmental 
issues to be one of the great untold stories." 
</P>
<P>
In a radio address broadcast on Saturday, Deukmejian cited a recent report by a 
national environmental organization, Renew America, which ranked California 
first in the nation for the quality of its environmental programs. And he took 
a swipe at the press, contending that environmental "good news often gets 
little coverage." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Report Card' 
</P>
<P>
In coming up with its environmental "report card," the league considered bills 
dealing with air pollution, land use, coastal protection, solid waste disposal, 
timber harvesting, toxics, water pollution and wildlife. Other votes were 
considered as well, including confirmation votes on Deukmejian's unsuccessful 
nomination of then Rep. Daniel E. Lungren (R-Long Beach) as state treasurer. 
The league considered Lungren to be an anti-environmental lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
The league is one of many groups that ranks lawmakers and the governor on a 
variety of issues. But unlike many of the others, the league's study is 
distributed to an estimated 100,000 Californians during door-to-door 
canvassing. The group also takes a direct hand in legislative election 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
According to the league's tally, Deukmejian vetoed four of nine environmental 
bills sent to his desk in 1987, five of 13 passed in 1986, six of 11 in 1985, 
six of 12 in 1984 and two of eight in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Environmental Awareness 
</P>
<P>
Blake said the record shows California's reputation for environmental awareness 
stems more from policies put in place by former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. than 
from any initiatives taken by Deukmejian. "Many of these programs actually have 
managed to sidestep efforts by the Deukmejian Administration to roll back on 
the environment," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The league also issued ratings for state legislators, based on their votes on 
environmental issues. In the Assembly, 14 members, all Democrats, were given 
100% scores, including Los Angeles County lawmakers Terry Friedman of Tarzana, 
Tom Hayden of Santa Monica, Richard Katz of Sepulveda, Burt Margolin of Los 
Angeles and Lucille Royball-Allard of Los Angeles. The lowest score went to 
Assemblyman Dennis Brown (R-Signal Hill), who scored 4%. 
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, six members, again all Democrats, received 100% scores. Half of 
those were from Los Angeles County -- Herschel Rosenthal, Art Torres and Diane 
Watson. Sen. Don Rogers (R-Bakersfield) received the lowest score in the 
Senate, 39%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENTAL RATINGS OF O.C. LEGISLATORS 
</P>
<P>
The California League of Conservation Voters on Monday rated the members of the 
state Legislature for their votes on 34 issues of interest to environmentalists 
during 1988. Here is how the 13 members of Orange County's delegation were 
ranked:

Mountain landslides engulfed more than 1,000 homes in the southern Soviet 
Union, leaving nearly 8,000 people homeless, the government newspaper Izvestia 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
It gave no details of deaths or injuries, nor did it say when the disaster 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
The landslides were caused by unusually heavy snowfalls in the Caucasus 
mountains, Izvestia said. Damage was estimated in tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The disaster occurred in the Nozhai-Yurt and Veden regions of Checheno-Ingush, 
an autonomous republic on the border with Soviet Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
"The landslides destroyed more than 1,000 residences, and dozens of farms, 
schools, and clubs. Nearly 8,000 people were made homeless," Izvestia said.

SALVADORAN SHAKE-UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The election results in El Salvador are not encouraging. They will further 
polarize an already deeply divided society unless the Bush Administration is 
willing to push for a negotiated end to nearly a decade of warfare. 
</P>
<P>
There are several reasons that the winner was Alfredo Cristiani, presidential 
candidate for the rightist Arena party. The voter turnout was very low, with 
one-third to one-half of eligible persons not casting ballots, especially in 
rural areas where leftist rebels are strongest. Arena's most loyal supporters 
are found among upper- and middle-class voters in San Salvador and other cities 
where turnout was higher. The ruling Christian Democratic party split into two 
factions, neither of which campaigned effectively. Christian Democrats also 
were demoralized, with their longtime hero, President Jose Napoleon Duarte, 
dying of cancer, while several of his top aides stood accused of corruption in 
public office. Finally, the Salvadoran economy is a shambles, weakened by 
warfare and a disastrous coffee crop this year. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever the causes, Arena's victory marks the failure of a U.S. government 
strategy of building a centrist government that could defeat the rebels by 
appealing to political moderates in El Salvador and abroad, including in the 
U.S. Congress. Now the White House and State Department must either change 
strategy or find ways to rationalize sending more than $1 million per day in 
U.S. aid to a government controlled by a party full of people many liken to the 
Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
That is a harsh charge, but the evidence of its validity is unnervingly 
abundant. Arena was founded by El Salvador's most violent rightists, using 
money provided by a small oligarchy whose selfish rule created the conditions 
for the rebellion in the first place. Despite Cristiani's candidacy, Arena's 
most popular leader remains former Maj. Roberto D'Aubuisson, who founded El 
Salvador's fearsome death squads, helped plan the murder of Archbishop Oscar 
Arnulfo Romero and even plotted, unsuccessfully, to kill a U.S. ambassador he 
didn't like. 
</P>
<P>
Cristiani and other Arena members who claim to be moderates insist that 
D'Aubuisson and his ilk are in the background now. And some in the State 
Department suggest that the United States is obligated to abide by the results 
of a democratic vote even if we don't like who wins. But when the Nazis first 
came to power in Germany, it was through elections. That did not obligate other 
democracies to endorse Nazi government policies. Neither does Arena's victory 
obligate the United States to go along with everything its leaders want to do. 
</P>
<P>
Given past threats by Salvadoran military leaders and D'Aubuisson, an Arena 
government may be tempted to go after the insurgents with all-out military 
pressure rather than the low-intensity warfare favored by U.S. military 
advisers. But all-out war would exacerbate the bloodshed in El Salvador to 
levels no reasonable human being could accept. Given the staying power of the 
guerrillas over the past decade, such a bloody strategy might not even work. 
</P>
<P>
So the U.S. government must use the leverage it has in San Salvador, which is 
considerable, to pursue a new strategy based on the painful reality that El 
Salvador's crisis reflects both a divided society and a battlefield stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
Early U.S. reaction to the vote made it clear that Washington understands the 
nature of its leverage. White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said: "We 
continue to press for democracy and human rights improvements in that country, 
and we'll just have to see what kind of actions we get from the new 
government." 
</P>
<P>
The best way out of the deadlock is negotiations. Both Cristiani and the rebels 
said during the election campaign that they are willing to talk peace. The U.S. 
government must insist that Cristiani pursue the tentative negotiations begun 
by Duarte. Negotiations in El Salvador are likely to be slow and difficult, and 
the end result will not be satisfying to anyone. But it is preferable to the 
final solution that extremists like D'Aubuisson want to pursue, with the United 
States as an unhappy accomplice.

The Salman Rushdie controversy raises interesting questions regarding 
censorship. I'm proud the Western World rushed to his defense; particularly, 
Britain -- he lives there. As for American supporters, count me in, but it's a 
strange side to be on in a country where "The Diary of Anne Frank" is still 
censored in some places; where I was recently requested to remove the word 
"Yid" from an essay by the editor of a New York literary magazine because it 
might cause "a religious war"; where "seven little words" are bleeped from 
movies even on late-night television; where radio stations are still pursued by 
the FCC for obscenities after dark; where racism is so prevalent articles on 
mixed marriages still make newspaper headlines. 
</P>
<P>
For a hot minute the Rushdie controversy made me think this was the land of the 
free and the home of the brave. Pinch me.

PESTICIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I congratulate Meryl Streep for raising consumer awareness about pesticide 
residues in foods. Like her, I am concerned about the health and well-being of 
our children. But we simply cannot produce the quantity and quality of food the 
world needs, at a reasonable cost, without using something to control the 
weeds, insects and diseases that destroy crops. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, rather than spending all our time and energies in a negative way, 
attacking pesticides, some time and energy should be devoted to finding a 
solution. And there are solutions. 
</P>
<P>
We have within our grasp a practical, safe and natural alternative to chemical 
pesticides. Our new found ability to identify, isolate and utilize the many 
defenses that nature has developed against pests makes the goal of biological 
control a reality. 
</P>
<P>
I grew up on a farm, and still own and manage a farm. I am also a scientist by 
education; my company is one of several working to develop "biopesticides." 
Others are developing plants that are naturally immune to pests and diseases. 
We are working toward a future in a agriculture where the issues of 
ground-water contamination, chemical residues, and health risks will steadily 
become things of the past. I have seen some of these remedies and I know they 
will help the bio-conversion of agricultural crop protection -- the shift from 
chemical to biological pest control. 
</P>
<P>
But we won't get from here to there anytime soon without some help -- help in 
making the consumer aware of these new alternatives to chemicals, in inducing 
the government to clear away the regulatory bottlenecks, and in developing the 
political and public support this new technology deserves.

Carl W. Ernst's placing of the Rushdie affair in a colonial context ("Beyond 
Politics of Blasphemy, We Still Need to Understand Islamic World," March 2) is 
the best analysis of the matter I have read so far. His comment that Rushdie's 
writing is "testimony to the psychological disintegration caused by alienation 
from one's culture" strikes me as being right on the mark. But there is 
something else. 
</P>
<P>
The "sarcastic and cynical devaluation" which Ernst refers to, and which seems 
so offensive to the Muslim faith Rushdie was born to, according to published 
reports, reflects the espousal of attitudes and a point of view considered as 
superior, sophisticated, that is, modern, by the erstwhile colonial who has, or 
believes he has acquired the sensibilities of a bona-fide member of Western 
society. 
</P>
<P>
The psychological consequences of the break-up of European colonialism will 
continue to be felt by individuals and societies alike for a long time.

TURMOIL IN TIBET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again the ongoing inhumane treatment of the citizens of Tibet by the 
Peoples Republic of China has made the news. My question is a simple one. The 
country of Tibet was free and independent until the Communist takeover in the 
1950s. Since that time people of Tibet along with a large part of its political 
and religious leaders have been in exile in various parts of the world. In the 
1950s when the Communists threatened South Korea we fought a fierce battle to 
keep those people free. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s when Cuba was taken over by Castro and his Communist regime we 
uttered an outrage that was heard around the world. When South Vietnam was 
threatened we again fought a long and bloody war to keep the people free. In 
the 1970s and the 1980s we have declared public outrage over Afghanistan and 
the continuous threats of Communist intervention in Central and South America. 
Why have we not even made a whimper over the forceful occupation of the 
peaceful land and people of Tibet? 
</P>
<P>
Tibet is a vast repository of philosophical and religious doctrine and has been 
for countless centuries. Its impact on the rest of the world, although subtle, 
is still a well acknowledged fact by the intellectual and religious communities 
of the world. 
</P>
<P>
The ongoing bloody massacres of its people, who only wish to be free to live 
their lives as any decent people have the right, is also a matter of public 
record and is reported in the newspapers and on television regularly. 
</P>
<P>
The silence on this matter in Washington is rather ominous. Why do we refuse to 
acknowledge this outrage? Isn't there anything we can do to help those people?

COMPETITIVE CONTRACTING OF BUS SERVICE IS NOT UNION-BUSTING; IT'S 
MONOPOLY-BUSTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. POOLE JR., Robert Poole is president of the Reason Foundation in 
Santa Monica and the author of several studies and a book on privatization of 
public services. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Mayor Tom Bradley and Supervisor Pete Schabarum reached agreement on 
contracting out the San Gabriel Valley's transit service in December, transit 
unions responded in force. They attacked the arrangement as anti-labor and 
filed suit seeking to have the San Gabriel Valley Transit Zone declared 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Most news coverage has given the impression that Schabarum and the Los Angeles 
County Transportation Commission are foisting some kind of untried scheme on 
San Gabriel Valley residents. In fact, competitive contracting is a proven 
approach toward getting greater value for the transit dollar. Consequently, it 
has been spreading across the country, with the encouragement of the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, for example, the Urban Mass Transportation Administration launched 
programs in Des Moines, Minneapolis/St. Paul and Little Rock to implement 
competitive contracting in not just a single district but citywide. It is 
expected that virtually all transit services in these cities will be opened to 
competitive bidding by private firms over the next few years. UMTA has also 
funded pilot contracting projects for selected transit services in Miami, New 
Orleans, Cincinnati and Austin. 
</P>
<P>
A major legislative battle in Colorado last spring led to a compromise bill in 
which an initial 20% of Denver's transit services will be contracted out over 
the next two years. When the first bidding took place, for 45 buses, eight 
companies submitted proposals. The winning bid came in at $28.25 per revenue 
hour -- 43.5% less than the existing service by Denver's public bus system. 
</P>
<P>
That kind of cost savings is fairly typical and goes far to explain the appeal 
of competitive contracting. Here in Los Angeles, 16 bus lines dropped by the 
Southern California Rapid Transit District in recent years have been contracted 
to private operators at 38% less cost. And savings on two more recently 
contracted services came in at 50% and 60% less. 
</P>
<P>
Transit unions like to argue that such savings come at the expense of unionized 
drivers. But transit expert Wendell Cox puts that claim in perspective. He 
points out that public transit costs since 1970 have increased by more than 64% 
after inflation. That's more than twice as much as medical costs! Labor costs 
are more than two-thirds of the cost of public transit. And it turns out that 
bus drivers at the 40 largest public transit agencies are paid more per hour 
than employees in any major industrial classification. Public bus drivers make 
54% more than the average salary for all full-time American workers -- more 
than the average manufacturing worker, miner or construction worker. 
</P>
<P>
A major factor is that public transit fringe benefits are 48% of wages compared 
with 25% for the average worker. And since bus drivers have much higher wages 
to begin with, their fringe benefits are more than three times those of the 
average American worker. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing in the nature of driving a bus that requires such high 
compensation. Indeed, bus drivers outside the public sector make far more 
modest sums. The private bus industry, with more than 3,000 firms and 120,000 
vehicles, pays competitive, market-determined wages and benefits. In contrast 
to public buses, where costs have gone up 64% in real terms since 1970, the 
private bus industry's costs have actually declined 8% after inflation. 
</P>
<P>
What explains the public transit sector's high costs is monopoly. Managers like 
those at the RTD have little incentive to bargain aggressively, since they have 
no alternative source of supply. Competitive contracting provides that 
alternative, giving both sides atangible incentive for productivity and 
efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego provides a telling example. Since the city began contracting for a 
small portion of its transit service in 1979, it has found itself in an 
increasingly strong position to gain efficiencies. By 1987, with about 18% of 
transit service supplied competitively, costs within San Diego Transit itself 
had declined 13% in real terms -- compared with a 30% increase in public 
transit costs in the rest of California. 
</P>
<P>
Critics like to charge that competitive contracting is "union-busting." But 
many of the growing private bus operators are themselves unionized. Greyhound, 
which provides much of Dallas' transit service, has contracts with the 
Amalgamated Transit Union. And Laidlaw drivers in Los Angeles are members of 
the Teamsters. 
</P>
<P>
Competitive contracting, nationwide and here at home in the San Gabriel Valley, 
is not union-busting; it's simply monopoly-busting. It's a way of giving 
taxpayers full value for the dollars they spend subsidizing public transit. 
Because those dollars are scarce and public transit is important to our future, 
it's important that we make these dollars go as far as possible. 
</P>
<P>
So Mayor Bradley and Supervisor Schabarum were not making a rash decision when 
they agreed to let the San Gabriel Valley Transit Zone proceed. They were 
selecting a proven method to give riders and taxpayers more for their money. 
Let's hope the courts agree when the union's suit is heard in April.

BLUSTER ON DRUGS, BUT THAT'S NO SOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN McCARTHY, Colman McCarthy is a syndicated columnist in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A nurse I've known for 22 years is a drug dealer. Her main customer is an 
elderly widow next door. Once a week the nurse crosses the walkway to visit the 
widow. She finds a vein and injects the drug. 
</P>
<P>
It's a B-12 shot. The widow feels relief. She's fine for a week. Then another 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
To categorize the nurse as a drug dealer is jarring perhaps. But accurate. That 
she deals in a legal drug separates her in obvious ways from those who sell, 
buy or use illegal drugs. The results, in somewhat less than obvious ways, are 
similar. Consumption of drugs -- legal or illegal -- is reducible to two 
reasons: relief of pain or the giving of pleasure. Aspirin reduces one kind of 
pain, crack another. A shot of beer provides one kind of buzz, a snort of 
heroin another. 
</P>
<P>
In President Bush's new drug war, which includes William Bennett as "commanding 
general," most of the talk is on cleaning up the battle-zone wreckage. Bennett 
wants more jail cells for convicted drug pushers. George Bush wants the death 
penalty for certain drug crimes. Rep. Walter E.Fauntroy, the District of 
Columbia Democrat who represents the nation's new murder capital in Congress, 
is offering a bill to hire and train more police officers. Others are calling 
for the National Guard to patrol the streets of Washington. The city, says 
Bennett, is to be a "test case" of curative measures. 
</P>
<P>
More cops, more jails, more death-row executions. Those are reactions, not 
solutions. They are weak interventions, not strong preventions. Epidemiology -- 
the control of epidemics -- demands that causes be dealt with, not only 
effects. Yet in the current drug epidemic, a disproportionate amount of talk -- 
bluster, really -- is being heaped on the results of illegal drug dealing. 
</P>
<P>
Washington One -- the city of issues where Presidents, drug czars and 
congresses come and go -- is telling Washington Two -- the black neighborhoods 
of homicides and drug wars -- that it is about to move in with a show of force. 
</P>
<P>
Why are few officials willing to raise questions about the pain that pushes 
high-school dropouts in Washington's black neighborhoods to seek relief in 
drugs? Why no questions about enhancing the normal pleasures of life -- quality 
schools, fair-paying jobs, access to recreation -- so that the abnormal 
pleasures of addictive drugs will be less appealing. 
</P>
<P>
The pain and the absence of pleasurable living being felt now in Washington Two 
-- and in Detroit Two or New York Two or in any of the nation's inner-city 
second cities -- are peaks of problems. The ascent to a crisis began in a 
gradual series of political decisions of governments that had the effect of 
inflicting pain on citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Pain is shown when the need for emergency food assistance rises an average of 
18% in 24 cities as it did in 1987. Pain is caused when the government decides 
to tolerate an unemployment rate for black teen-agers of 40%. 
</P>
<P>
How is the pain of poverty relieved? Drugs, for many. Current poverty is the 
result of policy decisions made five, 10 and 20 years ago. The Reagan years, 
which saw an increase in both the number of poor and the number of 
millionaires, furthered the conditions of misery that have now pushed 
Washington One into frenzies of action. 
</P>
<P>
If crack, cocaine and the other drugs are pain killers, which they are, why not 
deal aggressively with the causes of the pain? Where is the low-income-housing 
czar? Or the black teen-ager unemployment czar? Or the homelessness czar? 
</P>
<P>
Poor people keep asking for housing, jobs and education. The requests are 
denied. When enough of the poor turn on each other as drug pushers or 
murderers, and it happens within miles of the Capitol or White House, an alarm 
of dismay sounds. 
</P>
<P>
There is little talk in Washington of righting old wrongs or removing known 
pains. A thirst is here for perpetuating them.

PEPPERDINE GOES AFTER SWEEP OF NEW MEXICO IN NIT TONIGHT

Pepperdine's basketball team hopes that its tour of the National Invitation 
Tournament doesn't end where it began, in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves started NIT play last week with an 84-69 first-round victory over New 
Mexico State in Las Cruces. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight at 6:30, PST, Pepperdine (20-12) will play the University of New Mexico 
(21-10) in a second-round game here at University Arena, nicknamed the Pit. The 
Lobos are coming off a 91-76, first-round victory at home over Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
The winner will advance to the quarterfinals, which will be played Wednesday 
through Friday at campus sites. The semifinals will be March 27 and the final, 
March 29, at Madison Square Garden in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Lobos ended Pepperdine's NIT bid in the first round with an 
86-75 victory here. New Mexico forward Charlie Thomas, now a senior, finished 
with 20 points in that game and helped spark a comeback with 14 second-half 
points, including two slam dunks. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot 7-inch Thomas leads his team this season with averages of 17 points 
and eight rebounds a game. Sophomore guard Rob Robbins is averaging 16 points, 
and 7-2 center Luc Longley of Australia is averaging 12.6 points and 6.4 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
This is New Mexico's sixth consecutive NIT appearance, and its fans have been 
upset because the Lobos, despite good records, have been rejected in the 1980s 
by the National Collegiate Athletic Assn.'s tournament committee. 
</P>
<P>
Said Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury: "We played our best game of the season last 
Thursday night at New Mexico State. 
</P>
<P>
"We showed tremendous patience and poise on the offensive end, and that 
resulted in high-percentage shots. Our team defense was excellent, and we were 
extremely active on the boards." 
</P>
<P>
Against the Aggies, Dexter Howard and Craig Davis led the Waves in scoring, 
each with 16 points, and Casey Crawford added 13 points and a team-high nine 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Asbury said that the Lobos have "tremendous size, and they have shot the ball 
extremely well all season. We will need an outstanding defensive effort in 
order to win."

The International Weightlifting Federation has agreed on new measures aimed at 
stamping out drug use and securing the sport's Olympic future, according to an 
East German official. 
</P>
<P>
Junge Welt, a youth daily publication in East Berlin, quoted IWF committee 
member Werner Neumann as saying that the organization agreed unanimously on 
spot doping checks in all 131 member-countries during training and competition. 
</P>
<P>
If three lifters from any one country are caught using banned substances in a 
year, that nation will barred indefinitely and will face other sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Junge Welt said it was an open secret that more and more people were calling 
for weightlifting to be removed from the Olympics because of the number of 
athletes caught using drugs at the Seoul games last year. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, it will be possible to set world records only at World 
Championships or at Olympics. Up to now, World Cup and Continental tournaments 
also counted.

When it comes to basketball, is North Carolina really the Tar Heel state? 
</P>
<P>
The answer, overwhelmingly, is yes. In this state, they do polls on subjects 
like that. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, a Chapel Hill marketing firm did a random telephone survey of 520 
adults, asking the following question: "If all of the following teams were 
playing on television at the same time, but not playing each other, which would 
you watch: Duke Blue Devils, N.C. State Wolfpack, Charlotte Hornets, Carolina 
Tar Heels or Wake Forest Demon Deacons?" 
</P>
<P>
The results: North Carolina, 34%; N.C. State, 19%; Charlotte and Duke, 12%, and 
Wake Forest, 3%. A total of 20% said they "don't know." 
</P>
<P>
The Tar Heels carried every region of the state except Charlotte, where the 
Hornets had a 32%-26% edge. JEFF FELLENZER

WITT LOOKS SHARP IN FIFTH SPRING START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
PALM SPRINGS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Witt, the Angels' designated opening-day starter for the fifth consecutive 
season, has spent most of his 1989 training camp filling a new and unusual 
role: 
</P>
<P>
Opening act for Jim Abbott. 
</P>
<P>
Linked by Angel pitching coach Marcel Lachemann's master schedule, Witt and 
Abbott have become pitching partners, always working on the same day, always 
working in the same order. Witt, the Angels' No. 1 starter, gets the first few 
innings, followed by Abbott, the Angels' No. 1 draft choice and camp curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
The intent was to break in Abbott as smoothly and as painlessly as possible, 
with Witt serving to break the ice. 
</P>
<P>
The result, however, has been a spring of virtual anonymity for Witt, who 
customarily turns in his four or five innings and then retires to a clubhouse 
crowded with reporters jostling for prime position around Abbott's locker. 
</P>
<P>
While Abbott addresses reporters, there to hang on his every syllable, Witt 
dresses alone. 
</P>
<P>
At least until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In a first for Camp Rader, Witt outdrew Abbott in the postgame interview 
department after completing six shutout innings against the Cleveland Indians. 
Such an outing was something of a newsbreak for Witt, who took a 0-1 record and 
a 5.40 earned-run average into the game. 
</P>
<P>
In this, his fifth spring start, Witt limited the Indians to three hits, struck 
out three and led, 2-0 . . . before Abbott came on to let it slip away in an 
eventual 3-2 Angel loss. 
</P>
<P>
"If I could take this kind of outing into the season, I wouldn't want to change 
too much," Witt said. "This is how I'd like it to be. Instead of having a good 
outing and then a bad outing, I'd rather progress every game -- and that's what 
I've been doing. Every game, I've pitched better and better." 
</P>
<P>
Such an upturn could not have come at a better time for Angel Manager Doug 
Rader, who has grown weary of the shellings his pitching staff has endured en 
route to a 5.38 spring ERA. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike Witt was outstanding," Rader proclaimed. "He was everything we'd been 
hoping for all spring long. 
</P>
<P>
"That was 20-game-winner stuff he had today. Great composure, great confidence, 
great stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Witt said it has taken him time to adjust to new Angel catchers Lance Parrish 
and Bill Schroeder. Starting his ninth major league season, Witt had spent 
seven of his first eight throwing primarily to one catcher -- Bob Boone. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I was leery about the situation of having to work with new 
catchers," Witt said. "But I like the way they're catching now. I have no 
problems throwing to either of them." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
After Monday's game, Manager Doug Rader, General Manager Mike Port and the 
Angel coaching staff discussed the club's personnel, including Jim Abbott. 
Right now, Rader said, the thinking is to keep Abbott a starting pitcher -- if 
not with the Angels, then in Edmonton -- instead of breaking him in as a 
reliever. "I initially thought starting Abbott in the bullpen was a pretty good 
idea, but I'm being pushed away from that," Rader said. "The consensus is that 
he should either start here or in triple-A. And for him to start for us, 
something would have to happen to one of our five starters. Of course, that's 
still subject to two more weeks of spring training. The bottom line, I guess, 
is that it still hasn't been settled." 
</P>
<P>
Wally Joyner took batting practice for the second straight day, did some light 
running and told Rader he should be ready to play today. "Wally says he thought 
he could go (Monday)," Rader said. "He ran in the outfield and took some turns 
on the ankle. Nothing radical, but Wally was never a real good turner, any 
way."

SCIOSCIA HITS FIRST SPRING HOME RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON EDES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
VERO BEACH, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here's something for Dwight Gooden and the New York Mets to think about on the 
first day of spring: 
</P>
<P>
Mike Scioscia's game-winning home run in the bottom of the ninth inning Monday 
in the Dodgers' 6-5 victory over the Atlanta Braves was the first he has hit in 
spring training, dating to 1977, his first spring at Vero Beach, when he was 18 
and barely out of high school. 
</P>
<P>
"My first home run in Florida," said Scioscia, who was pinch-hitting for 
pitcher Jeff Fischer when he connected off Atlanta reliever Tommy Greene. 
</P>
<P>
"That's counting everything -- intra-squad games and exhibitions. But it's not 
going to mean anything tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Hard to believe, Manager Tom Lasorda said, but it was only last October that 
Scioscia taxed Lasorda's credulity to the limit, when he hit a two-run homer 
off Gooden in the ninth inning of Game 4 of the National League playoffs. That 
sent the game into extra innings, and the Dodgers won on Kirk Gibson's home run 
in the 12th. 
</P>
<P>
Scioscia's homer, Lasorda has said repeatedly, was the single most important 
play of the postseason, not to mention the most improbable. Had the Dodgers 
lost, they would have fallen behind the Mets, three games to one, in the 
best-of-seven series. 
</P>
<P>
How improbable was the home run? 
</P>
<P>
Scioscia hit three in 129 games in the regular season in 1988. In 2,837 big 
league at-bats over nine seasons, the Dodger catcher has 35 home runs -- an 
average of one for every 81 at-bats. In 71 postseason at-bats, Scioscia has two 
home runs, the other having been against Montreal in the 1981 playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
So why shouldn't Scioscia hit a home run off the hardest-throwing right-hander 
in the National League? He's mildly annoyed that you should ask. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I'm not a consistent home run hitter, but I hit them from time to time," 
Scioscia said. "I'm a line-drive hitter, I never try for home runs. But he gave 
me a pitch to handle, I got the head of my bat on the ball, and I hit a line 
drive that went over the fence." 
</P>
<P>
It's typical of Scioscia to downplay the impact of the home run, although he 
did concede that it was the highlight of his career -- offensively. 
Defensively, he mentioned throwing out Tim Raines to end the Montreal 
outfielder's consecutive base-stealing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson did not play Monday, a victim of a flu bug that also hit Mickey 
Hatcher and 20 minor leaguers, forcing the cancellation of two Class-A games. 
Rookie Chris Gwynn took advantage of Gibson's absence to start in left field 
and go three-for-four, including a home run. 
</P>
<P>
The three hits raised Gwynn's average to .500, tying him with Alfredo Griffin 
-- who had one hit in four at-bats -- for the team lead. Gwynn has 17 hits in 
34 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Those kinds of numbers have the left-handed hitting Gwynn -- who hit .299 with 
five home runs and 61 RBIs -- pushing Franklin Stubbs for a reserve position on 
the squad. Stubbs' versatility gives him an edge -- he can play both first base 
and the outfield -- and barring a trade, he figures to start the season with 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
But Gwynn, 24, is making a run at joining brother Tony of the Padres in the big 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"He's hot and having a hell of a spring," Lasorda said. "So you've got to give 
every thought to (Gwynn's making the major league roster). What's the sense of 
a guy having a hell of a spring and us not doing anything about it? We've got 
to give him every consideration."

KELLY DEFENDS TITLE WITH KNOCKOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Defending champion Derrick Kelly scored an eighth-round knockout over Derwin 
Richards Monday night at the Forum to retain the North American Boxing 
Federation welterweight crown. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly, from Riverside, held an advantage throughout the scheduled 12-round bout 
with quick moves that confused Richards. 
</P>
<P>
Referee Lou Filippo stopped the bout at 2:15 of the eighth round as Richards, 
21, was unable to ward off Kelly, 28. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly (23-1-2) was expected to meet a difficult challenge from the NABF's No. 
10 contender. Kelly gained the NABF welterweight crown with a victory over Luis 
Santana of the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
In a semifinal match in the $225,000 Forum Superlightweight Tournament 
Championship, Rodolfo Aguilar of Panama City, won a unanimous 10-round decision 
over Joe Rivera of Rio Piedra, Puerto Rico.

KSLD-TV Channel 62, the first new TV station in the Los Angeles market in 
years, went on the air Monday night with programming supplied by Home Shopping 
Network, instead of Spanish-language programming as originally announced. 
Station president Jack Hodin said he made the change after he was unable to 
secure enough Spanish programs. "The group I had a prospective contract with 
was simply not prepared to get started," Hodin said. KSLD will broadcast from 9 
p.m.-6 a.m. until April 3, when it will increase to 24 hours daily. Hodin said 
his station's Home Shopping programming is "differently packaged and presented" 
than that carried on Channel 46. ALEENE MacMINN

KGIL radio (1260 AM) on Wednesday will present 12-plus hours on "Abortion 1989: 
Both Sides Now," the first time the station has devoted a full broadcast day to 
one topic. From 5:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., the regular program hosts will be talking 
to guests about legal issues and recent court decisions, rights of the unborn, 
the aftermath of abortion and personal stories of women who have had abortions. 
Mike Lundy, the station's director of programming and operations, said recent 
activities of anti-abortionists and "the changing climate on the issue were the 
catalysts" for the special. "We decided this would be an opportune time to 
really do an in-depth examination." ALEENE MacMINN

"The Last Emperor," last year's big winner at the Academy Awards, was named 
best film Sunday night by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. Two 
stars from the offbeat comedy "A Fish Called Wanda" won acting awards: John 
Cleese (best actor) and Michael Palin (supporting actor). Best actress awards 
winners were Maggie Smith, for her starring role as a spinster piano teacher in 
Dublin in "The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne," and Dame Judi Dench, for her 
supporting role as the pushy mother in "A Handful of Dust." Best original 
screenplay went to "A World Apart," while "The Unbearable Lightness of Being" 
won best adapted screenplay. Louis Malle took directing honors for "Au Revoir 
Les Enfants." This year's best picture Oscar nominees were ineligible because 
they were not released in Britain during 1988. ALEENE MacMINN

Carroll O'Connor, who had been scheduled to be discharged Monday from Emory 
University Hospital in Atlanta after coronary bypass surgery on March 11, 
instead underwent surgery to remove his gallbladder Monday morning. Later in 
the day, a hospital spokesman said the new surgery had been uneventful and that 
the 63-year-old actor had tolerated it "very well." O'Connor was taken to 
general intensive care and is expected to be hospitalized for another week to 
10 days. He developed abdominal discomfort Saturday, and when the symptoms did 
not resolve with medical therapy, the surgery was recommended. Physicians said 
the gallbladder problem was not directly connected to O'Connor's recent bypass, 
adding that in fact, having had the coronary obstructions corrected, he could 
more safely tolerate the additional surgery.

TWO GARAGE BANDS BARREL INTO L.A.

A few years ago, groups like Field Day and Sweet Baby wouldn't have stood a 
chance in corporate music-land. But now there's a proven market for anti-image 
garage bands, and they spell it "college radio." The two Northern California 
groups barreled down a megaton-pop highway at Club Lingerie on Sunday, 
finishing in a split decision. 
</P>
<P>
Field Day may be an "alternative rock" band, but the quartet plays within 
parameters that are as well defined for its audience's expectations as George 
Michael's are for his. Those drawling vocals buried in a wash of frantically 
strummed fuzz guitars -- did someone say Husker Du? A few side-gallops into 
countrified chicken-pickin' followed by a blast o' metal -- a side serving of 
Meat Puppets, perhaps? For all its youth, spirit and energy, Field Day never 
surmounts its influences. 
</P>
<P>
Sweet Baby promotes the same slop-rock aesthetic, but the quartet's friendly 
mayhem had some memorable Merseybeat harmonies cutting the bluster. The 
material may revolve around some hoary rock 'n' roll structures, but the baby 
band -- with a wobbly-legged scarecrow of a vocalist providing the 
personality-plus -- infuses the old routine with a fresh dose of adrenaline. 
They might even replace the Replacements when they grow up. When they do, maybe 
they'll get a bass whose strings don't all break.CRAIG LEE

BUSTAMANTE AND FERRI IN EVENING PERFORMANCE

<P>
Her extension seems to grow higher every year, but Alessandra Ferri is still a 
great Juliet where it counts -- in her intense surrender to each moment of 
Kenneth MacMillan's Shakespeare ballet. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday evening in Shrine Auditorium, Ferri graced the last performance of the 
American Ballet Theatre season. Her Romeo: Ricardo Bustamante, a Ballet Theatre 
soloist with an unusually high extension of his own and an ability to almost 
match her sense of spontaneity and passionate involvement. 
</P>
<P>
Though his best dancing had extraordinary suavity and technical plush, 
Bustamante did not always look comfortable in his solos, with their emphasis on 
intricate combinations of jumps and turns in place. However, the duets were 
glorious: paradigms of mutual risk, trust and inspiration. Bustamante's 
sensitivity as an actor and strength as a partner released Ferri into dancing 
of thrilling urgency, intimacy, generosity. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, this final "Romeo and Juliet" featured a number of pointed character 
portrayals: Victor Barbee's brutal Tybalt, for example, and Clark Tippet's 
haughty Capulet, plus, as always, Georgina Parkinson's memorably elegant and 
neurotic Lady Capulet. 
</P>
<P>
John Summers made a confused, manipulated Paris (another victimized Verona 
youth rather than a co-conspirator). As Mercutio, Danilo Radojevic followed 
current Ballet Theatre practice by reducing the character to generalized 
sweetness and solid-gold virtuosity. Jack Everly conducted.LEWIS SEGAL

ALEXANDER LEADS BERLIOZ REQUIEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HETTMANSBERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Requiem of Hector Berlioz is a sprawling, ultra-Romantic work, alternating 
grandiose movements with surprisingly intimate ones. Many conductors are lured 
by its huge aspects, but few are able to manage the disparate elements of this 
gargantuan composition and fuse a cohesive structure. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday night at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, John Alexander proved 
to be one of the few. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the combined forces of his Pacific Chorale and Valley Master Chorale, 
along with an augmented Pacific Symphony, Alexander conducted a performance of 
consistent intensity. The sheer mass of the forces alone insured that volume 
per se would not be a problem. Taking advantage of the Segerstrom Hall 
acoustics, Alexander conducted with an ear toward balance, instrumental detail 
and beauty of sound. 
</P>
<P>
From the opening Kyrie Alexander revealed that he does not subscribe to one 
common school of choral conducting -- maximum attention to the singers, general 
neglect of the orchestra. The Pacific Symphony strings produced deep, warm 
sounds from the start and all sections demonstrated impeccable intonation 
throughout. 
</P>
<P>
The famous Dies Irae handled the placement of the additional brass in 
quasi-quadraphonic style. In addition to the requisite clean entrances and 
polished ensemble, their collective tone was imposing without blaring or 
strain. 
</P>
<P>
The massed vocalists sang with a keen awareness of balance in every dynamic 
level, though tenor passages occasionally lacked heft. 
</P>
<P>
The same cannot be said of tenor soloist Paul Johnson, whose sostenuto lines in 
the Sanctus revealed clear, light skillfully modulated sound with power in 
reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Having scrupulously avoided any and all temptations to bombast, Alexander 
conveyed a sense of mystery in the quieter movements, not least among them the 
Hostias, with its recurring chords uniquely scored with three flutes and eight 
trombones. GREG HETTMANSBERGER

ZUBIN MEHTA WITH ISRAEL PHILHARMONIC AT PAVILION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALBERT GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The combination of Zubin Mehta and the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra is not a 
new one, but it is self-renewing and it was heard to best advantage in the 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Music Center on Sunday night. Through the 
years, the orchestra's playing has invariably been of high quality, but not 
always as good as one would have liked or expected. 
</P>
<P>
This time any such reservation would seem out of order. The orchestra was in 
fine shape -- consistently solid and reliable. It responded to the conductor's 
wishes with alacrity and spontaneity. It had neither to strain or to restrain 
to achieve a desired effect. 
</P>
<P>
The rich, full-orchestra sound had both flexibility and stability. The rhythmic 
response proved alert and sharp edged. 
</P>
<P>
The program's first half was a repeat of the agenda performed in Orange County 
on Saturday and reviewed in these pages on Monday. Sunday, it remained for 
Schubert's "Great" C-major Symphony to give full rein to the conductor's 
expansive imagination and his careful marshaling of forces. His tempos were 
judicious; they never rushed, yet were never allowed to linger excessively. The 
whole scheme became pervasively joyous and exuberant. 
</P>
<P>
The admirers of the Israel Philharmonic and of the conductor jammed the 
Pavilion and exploded regularly with enthusiasm. ALBERT GOLDBERG

SMALL DONOR NAMES ARE ELECTION ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seeking to cast doubt on his opponent's claims of political independence, 
Westside Los Angeles school board candidate Mark Slavkin on Monday challenged 
incumbent Alan Gershman to reveal the names of hundreds of small campaign 
contributors. 
</P>
<P>
Gershman refused, saying the demand was "another example of Slavkin's smear 
tactics" and that disclosure of smaller donors' names could expose them to 
harassment from the district teachers' union, which has targeted Gershman for 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Listing the names of campaign donors who give less than $100 is not required 
under state law. However, candidates may -- and some do -- disclose all of 
their contributors. 
</P>
<P>
In this particular campaign, which many observers believe could tilt political 
balance of the school board toward the teachers' union, Monday's challenge was 
a strategically important tactic for Slavkin. 
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old aide to County Supervisor Ed Edelman has had to defend his own 
strong backing from the 22,000-member United Teachers-Los Angeles, which is 
embroiled in a long-running fight with the school board over salaries, 
increased say for teachers over how schools are run and other issues. If 
Slavkin wins, it could give UTLA the fourth board vote it needs on a variety of 
labor-management issues. 
</P>
<P>
But Slavkin contends that Gershman is being supported by a less obvious 
interest group -- district administrators and managers who want to protect 
their own pay, promotional opportunities and power. 
</P>
<P>
Slavkin hopes full disclosure of Gershman's contributors will show that. On 
Monday, Slavkin announced that he would reveal all of his small donors and 
called on Gershman to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disclosure Issue 
</P>
<P>
"We are not ashamed to say who is supporting us," said Rick Taylor, a campaign 
consultant to Slavkin. "We don't understand why Mr. Gershman is afraid to show 
us his contributors." 
</P>
<P>
Gershman, 49, who is seeking a third term, has campaigned on his record, 
stressing his integrity and independence. 
</P>
<P>
The latest campaign finance records show that Gershman has raised about $19,000 
since the beginning of the year, more than three times what Slavkin took in. 
More than half of Gershman's funds came from small, unnamed donors. 
</P>
<P>
Of 54 contributors who gave enough to require disclosure, most are identified 
only as "educator" in the district. But a check of the district phone directory 
shows many of those appear to be school district principals, administrators or 
central office instructional personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Jess Bravin, a spokesman for Gershman, said he had no idea how much of the 
campaign's money has come from administrators. But he said the campaign has 
broad support from parents, non-teaching district unions and "all quarters of 
the district." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Price, a spokesman for an 8,000-member union representing some of the 
district's lower paid blue-collar workers and classroom aides, said his group 
is supporting Gershman, in part because it fears a board strongly allied with 
UTLA could undercut other workers' jobs and pay. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews, several administrators acknowledged they were supporting 
Gershman. Sylvia Metzler, an assistant principal in the San Fernando Valley, 
said she bought two tickets to a Gershman fund-raiser "kind of . . . under peer 
pressure." A friend and former boss, Gloria Cox, had called, she said. Cox, now 
an administrator at district headquarters, acknowledged that she made the pitch 
after attending a Gershman campaign program at downtown hotel, where Paul 
Possemoto, one of the district's top instructional administrators, spoke and 
urged support of Gershman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Group Officially Neutral 
</P>
<P>
The 1,500-member Associated Administrators of Los Angeles is officially neutral 
in the election. But it has strongly encouraged members to contribute to 
candidates they support, emphasizing in one newsletter that names do not have 
to be revealed if less than $100 is given. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're asking me whether most administrators respect Alan Gershman as a 
board member, I'd say definitely," said Walker Brown, executive director for 
the administrators' group.

STATE CHARGES MAYOR OF INGLEWOOD WITH ILLEGAL USE OF FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state attorney general's office charged Inglewood Mayor Edward Vincent on 
Monday with illegally using about $5,000 in campaign funds for personal 
expenses during the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
The charge was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court and was the first such 
action against an elected official under a 1981 law that bars personal use of 
campaign funds, according to Eugene Hill, head of the attorney general's 
government law division. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint, which caps a four-month state investigation prompted by articles 
in The Times, asks that Vincent pay fines totaling about $10,000, twice the 
amount allegedly misspent. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent spent the campaign money on travel, clothing, auto repair and a 
veterinarian's bill, among other things, the complaint alleges. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent, who could not be reached for comment, has acknowledged improper use of 
campaign funds in the past but said it was unintentional and resulted from 
sloppy bookkeeping. Hill said that explanation was "not satisfactory." 
</P>
<P>
In other cases in which officeholders have violated the law, the attorney 
general's office has been satisfied when the campaign funds were repaid. In 
this case, stiffer penalties are being sought because investigators believe 
that Vincent systematically and knowingly violated the law, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
"There did appear to be a pattern of activity that went over several 
transactions," Hill said. "It was conduct that was repeated." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent's campaign accountant, David Gould, acknowledged last month that the 
expenditures violated the prohibition against using campaign donations for 
personal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent filed a campaign statement last month indicating that he had reimbursed 
his campaign fund for some of the expenditures and planned to repay the others. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
30 Days to Respond 
</P>
<P>
Vincent will have 30 days to respond to the charges in the civil complaint, 
officials said. He can either admit the charges and pay the fines or deny the 
allegations and seek a trial. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's attorney, Carl Douglas, said Vincent has not yet decided how he 
will respond because he hopes to negotiate a settlement with the attorney 
general's office before the 30 days has passed. 
</P>
<P>
Such a settlement would probably involve at least partial payment of the fines, 
Douglas said. "It has always been the mayor's hope to resolve this matter and 
repay any unfair renumeration," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint alleges that Vincent unlawfully spent about $2,900 in campaign 
money on city-related trips to Morro Bay, Calif.; Philadelphia; Salt Lake City 
and Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Received Reimbursement 
</P>
<P>
Records show that the mayor paid for those trips with campaign funds and 
submitted the receipts to the city. By obtaining reimbursement from the city 
for trips paid for with campaign funds, Vincent was in effect converting 
campaign money to his personal use, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Other alleged personal use of campaign money includes $1,078 for repair of his 
pickup truck, $374 on clothes, $128 on a veterinarian's bill and $509 in 
miscellaneous expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The state Election Code defines personal use of campaign funds as creating "a 
substantial personal benefit" and lacking "more than a negligible political, 
legislative or governmental purpose."

TEST RESULTS TO ALLOW LOPEZ LANDFILL TO REMAIN OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state will not close Lopez Canyon Landfill, Los Angeles' only public trash 
dump, because only low levels of toxics were found during air and underground 
gas tests, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"The results came in, and they showed there's nothing to worry about at all," 
said Chris Peck, spokesman for the California Waste Management Board. 
</P>
<P>
Peck, however, defended the state board's recent order to close the Lake View 
Terrace area landfill until testing was completed. The order came Thursday 
after the hospitalization of two city sanitation workers who inhaled fumes at 
the dump. When the city and county balked at that order, state officials flew 
down for a meeting Friday, after which they decided to wait for the test 
results. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Health, Safety Stance 
</P>
<P>
"When it comes down to public health and safety, the board would much rather be 
accused of overreacting than of not acting soon enough," Peck said. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez Canyon receives more than half of the estimated 6,000 to 7,000 tons of 
household trash produced daily in the city. The rest goes to two private 
landfills and to one operated under a county contract. 
</P>
<P>
Test results, released Monday, "showed constituents that are typical of 
landfill gas, in some cases particularly odorous landfill gases . . . but no 
immediate hazard to anyone in the neighborhood," said Carol Coy, senior 
enforcement officer with the South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
However, the AQMD will conduct around-the-clock air sampling later this week in 
the residential areas of Lake View Terrace and Kagel Canyon because of the 
continuing mystery over what sickened the sanitation workers, Coy said. 
</P>
<P>
Two workers fainted and several others complained of nausea and headaches after 
digging into a layer of 1982-vintage trash while excavating for a road on March 
8. One of the workers, Keith O'Kray, 33, was hospitalized for 11 days. 
</P>
<P>
Because the city waited several days before notifying the AQMD and because gas 
dissipates quickly, Coy said it cannot be said for certain what sickened the 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
However, investigators believe it was hydrogen sulfide gas -- a common product 
of decaying manure -- found at levels of 16 parts per million in some of the 
seven tests of underground gases, Coy said. Levels of 10 to 16 p.p.m. are 
common at area landfills, she said. 
</P>
<P>
There is no statewide health limit for the gas, because research on the 
chemical is incomplete, Coy said. But in enclosed industrial settings, workers 
must wear a respirator when levels are at 10 p.p.m., she said. 
</P>
<P>
Excavation for the landfill road is at a standstill because of the accident, 
said Michael Miller, assistant director of the Los Angeles city Bureau of 
Sanitation. And the city must obtain a permit from the AQMD before it can 
resume. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Citation Issued 
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, the AQMD cited the landfill for proceeding without the permit, 
which requires testing of ground gases, Coy said. Other excavation on the site, 
where an AQMD-ordered gas extraction system must be installed by July, also has 
halted while a landfill consultant reviews dump operations, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to assure ourselves that nothing like this ever happens again," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Landfill opponents were pleased with news of neighborhood air sampling, but 
unhappy that the state decided not to close the dump. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm terribly disappointed," said Rob Zapple of the Kagel Canyon Civic Assn. 
"Why don't they shut it down now and finish the gas recovery system?"

SPRING RIDES WARM WINDS INTO SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While they shoveled snow in the Rockies and dodged thunderstorms in the 
Midwest, people in the Southland marked the first day of spring with trips to 
the beach and long lunch breaks in city parks. 
</P>
<P>
Spurred by gusty Santa Ana winds, the mercury climbed to 83 Monday at the Los 
Angeles Civic Center, six degrees shy of the record for the date -- but hot 
enough to send many area residents in search of relief. 
</P>
<P>
Spring, which officially began at 7:28 a.m., coincided with the beginning of 
school break for several districts in Los Angeles and Orange counties. But 
other systems, including the Los Angeles Unified School District, will not have 
vacation until next month. 
</P>
<P>
The warmth was expected to subside some today, according to Rick Dittmann, a 
meteorologist for WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. 
Clouds will move down the shoreline today, he said, cooling the coastal areas 
slightly, though inland temperatures will stay in the 80s. 
</P>
<P>
"With the arrival of spring, I don't think (permanent) warm weather is too far 
off," Dittmann said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
10,000 at Zuma 
</P>
<P>
At popular Zuma Beach, lifeguards reported more than 10,000 sun worshipers, 
swimmers and surfers had gathered by noon, and the crowd was growing. 
</P>
<P>
Half a dozen lifeguard watch towers were opened Monday for the first time this 
season in anticipation of the rush to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Lifeguard Craig Mattox reported 15 rescues at Zuma on Sunday and was expecting 
more on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"People are coming out of their winter coats, they're out of shape or they're 
from the middle states and not too water-oriented," he said. "The weather gets 
hot and they start coming out." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a beautiful, gorgeous day and I just wanted to get some rays and relax," 
Chris Rioux, a 24-year-old resident of West Los Angeles, said as he spent his 
lunch break on a bench at Santa Monica Beach watching a volleyball game. 
</P>
<P>
"It was too hot inside, so we came out to watch the kids play," said Adelaida 
Chacon, who had strolled down the Santa Monica promenade with her two children 
to a grassy park area by the sand. 
</P>
<P>
The homeless people who frequent Santa Monica's Palisades Park, meanwhile, 
sought shade and napped under palm trees. 
</P>
<P>
In nearby Venice, crowds did not rival the peak weekend volume, but were bigger 
than normal for a weekday. Youngsters on skateboards and roller skates raced up 
and down Ocean Front Walk, while other people in bathing suits ate, drank and 
seemed merry at sidewalk cafes. 
</P>
<P>
"Today is the first day of spring and, boy, you can really tell," said Bruce 
Stanley, manager of the Land's End Cafe in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the warm temperatures, Santa Ana winds gusting up to 40 m.p.h. 
whipped out of the deserts through the coastal canyons. As a result, high-wind 
advisories were posted for the so-called Inland Empire and parts of the 
Antelope Valley and Orange County, but no major damage was reported. 
</P>
<P>
In Palm Springs, as thousands of college students descended on the desert 
resort city for traditional spring break partying, police reported 388 arrests 
for offenses involving drunkenness and rowdiness, and an additional 1,728 
citations were issued for traffic and other minor violations. 
</P>
<P>
A Santa Ana woman, Sylvia Flores, 22, was killed and five companions seriously 
injured in a crash on a Palm Springs street Sunday evening. The pickup truck 
they were riding in was speeding and flipped over, police said. Officers said 
there was some evidence that the young people involved in the accident had been 
drinking, but no charges had been filed and the incident was under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the first day of spring was marked by a low-pressure system that 
moved into the southern Plains on Monday, dumping nine inches of snow in parts 
of Colorado and sending a blizzard into western Kansas that shut down major 
highways. 
</P>
<P>
Powerful thunderstorms were moving from east Texas into Louisiana, with heavy 
rain from Missouri through the middle Mississippi Valley.

PANEL WILL EXAMINE WEAPONS AT SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Board of Education agreed Monday to establish a task force to 
study ways to eliminate guns, knives and other weapons from school campuses. 
</P>
<P>
Proposed by West San Fernando Valley board member Julie Korenstein, who cited a 
rising incidence of weapon possession in some parts of the district, the task 
force will include teachers, administrators, community leaders and 
representatives of the district attorney, the city attorney and law 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Among the issues that the group could examine is the use of metal detectors, 
board members indicated. The task force's recommendations will be due by June 
30. 
</P>
<P>
The motion passed on a 6-0 vote, with South-Central Los Angeles board member 
Rita Walters abstaining.

BRADLEY GETS OK ON CAMPAIGN MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley can use $1.8 million in campaign money raised 
prior to this calendar year, despite a state proposition prohibiting carrying 
such funds forward, a judge ruled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Kurt Lewin declared that Los Angeles city elections "have 
been governed by more comprehensive and restrictive provisions than those 
contained in Proposition 73 for the past four years." Thus, Lewin said, there 
has been "an even playing field" for all candidates for the upcoming April 11 
and June 6 elections. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Nate Holden, challenging Bradley in the April 11 balloting, had 
asked Lewin to reverse his earlier ruling that city elections are exempt from 
Proposition 73, approved by the voters last year. 
</P>
<P>
Holden, whose attorney contended that Proposition 73 required candidates to 
start with a "clean slate" on Jan. 1, said he will not appeal the Monday 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Holden has estimated that he has raised more than $100,000 for his own mayoral 
campaign.

"Earthquake -- The Big One" suffered a minor disaster, and it wasn't one that 
Universal Studios Tour had planned. 
</P>
<P>
Refunds were given to 600 visitors who missed the simulated 8.3-magnitude 
earthquake because workers were tinkering with a real-life malfunction. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was that the attraction's subway set was minus one explosion. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a slab of concrete that falls from above and (a fuel) truck is 
supposed to slide down and explode, but it didn't do it like it was supposed 
to," explained spokeswoman Joan Bullard. 
</P>
<P>
The procession of tourist-crammed trams was held up for 90 minutes while 
workers tried to induce the truck to blow up. Finally, in the ensuing logjam, 
the drivers of several tourist-filled trams decided to bypass the quake. They 
no doubt felt it was a matter of either leaving the scene or rechristening the 
attraction "Traffic Jam -- The Big One." 
</P>
<P>
The names of Burns and Allen are united again, this time at Cedars-Sinai 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
In recognition of the entertainer's $2-million donation, the hospital on Monday 
honored Burns, 93, and his late wife and comedy partner, Gracie Allen, by 
unveiling the Burns and Allen Chair in Cardiology Research. 
</P>
<P>
It's the latest in a long list of institutions named after philanthropic 
members of the entertainment community, including the Jerry Lewis Neuromuscular 
Research Center and the Jules Stein Eye Institute at UCLA, the George Lucas 
Instructional Center at USC, the Anthony Quinn Library in East Los Angeles, 
William Hart High School in Newhall and Will Rogers, Leo Carrillo and Dan 
Blocker state beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Other memorials include John Wayne Airport in Orange County and the Ronald 
Reagan State Office Building under construction in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Chevy Chase Country Club, however, was not named after the screen comic. 
</P>
<P>
First, apples and grapes. Now, a bunny ban? 
</P>
<P>
That would be the preference of the county Department of Animal Care and 
Control, which points out that every year parents get caught up in the spirit 
of Easter and buy their children rabbits. The big-eared creatures are initially 
cute and cuddly but much more difficult to take care of than dogs and cats in 
an urban area. 
</P>
<P>
The agency points out that county law also prohibits the sale of baby rabbits, 
ducklings and chicks, which often die or wind up in ill health at animal 
centers "after the vigorous handling and haphazard care" they receive from 
children. 
</P>
<P>
And, as though it needed saying, it is also illegal for any animal to be dyed 
or stained. 
</P>
<P>
It was a heartening sight after the recent reports of delays in the 
construction of Metro Rail. 
</P>
<P>
An entrance sign near City Hall said "Subway." 
</P>
<P>
However, a closer look revealed that the sign stood over a dummy station that 
was a prop for a television movie about a New York newspaper columnist. 
</P>
<P>
Even the hot dog vendor next to the subway was a fake, although his cart did 
conceal a birthday cake for someone in the cast.

AL MARTINEZ: LIFE IN SHADES OF PASTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shervin Firouzi paints flowers and clown faces and whales that leap in showers 
of spray from the depths of aqua seas. A woman smiles in one painting, a swan 
drifts by in another. The shades are pastel-gentle, movement without violence, 
comment without rage. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to paint in blacks and reds," Firouzi says, talking around the paint 
brush in his mouth." At one time you'd have seen harsh designs and distorted 
faces. I was full of anger and aggression. But that's all gone now. I'm 
different." 
</P>
<P>
The hiss of a respirator slips into a moment's silence. It comes at regular 
intervals, like someone softly shushing for quiet. Firouzi listens almost 
unconsciously, then goes back to creating the clown face on a canvas before 
him. 
</P>
<P>
He moves his wheelchair slightly to catch a different quality of light slanting 
in through the window by his bed. So doing, he glances at the same view he has 
seen from the same window for almost two years: the smog-blurred outline of 
mountains in the background, endless gray rows of homes in the foreground. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a typical view of the Valley," Shervin says, turning slightly away. "I 
don't brag about it." More silence. More of the respirator's hissing. Then he 
says in a tone of tempered desperation, "Get me out of here." 
</P>
<P>
Shervin Firouzi, age 23. A native of Iran, a restaurant manager by trade. In 
July, 1986, he dove into shallow water and was paralyzed from the neck down. He 
can move only his head. Without life-support systems, he would die. His 
hospital care amounts to $1,500 a day. Medi-Cal pays about half. The hospital 
feels that isn't enough and wants him transferred to a convalescent unit. 
Firouzi wants to go home. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a mother and sister at home," he says, "but Medi-Cal won't let me go 
there because they'd have to furnish a full-time nurse. They've already said 
yes to the equipment I need. Even giving me a nurse would save the state money. 
But they say I have to be sub-acute to rate a nurse. Sub-acute? Without a 
respirator, I would be dead in five minutes. Isn't that acute enough?" 
</P>
<P>
I met Shervin a little over a year ago. He was trying even then to go home. He 
felt the hospital walls were closing in around him. He felt he was in a prison. 
They tried once to place him in a convalescent home in Montebello. Shervin saw 
it as a place where old men went to die. 
</P>
<P>
"The youngest person there was 55 and in a coma," he says, coughing slightly. 
"The rest were in their 70s and 80s. I'm not ready to vegetate." I ask about 
the cough. "It's just a habit," he says. "I have so few body functions that 
whatever I have, I use. Coughing is one." 
</P>
<P>
He began painting about a year ago and has had two shows, one in a library and 
one in a hair salon. All his work is in oils. Fifteen paintings are stacked on 
a cart ready to store until the next exhibition of his work. Others hang on the 
wall around his bed. 
</P>
<P>
Firouzi is dark-haired and bearded. His face radiates good health, denying the 
calamity that has paralyzed his body. His eyes are sharp and focused. He 
operates his wheelchair by manipulating a control with his chin. He paints with 
a brush between his teeth. Sometimes he dreams he's running. 
</P>
<P>
"I awaken," he says simply, "and I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not done with this life," he says, dropping the paint brush to study the 
clown face on the canvas before him. "I want to visit schools to share my story 
with the kids. I want to tell them this could happen to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"I am in this position for a reason. Everything happens for a reason. If I 
didn't feel that way I would spend my time saying 'why me, why me?' I don't 
want to do that." He speaks with difficulty. Immediately after the accident 
that paralyzed him, the effort was monumental. He had to learn to speak all 
over again. 
</P>
<P>
He thinks about going back into the restaurant business again someday, maybe 
even owning his own place. At other times he talks about opening an art 
gallery. He has watched others go through his ward, their dreams as paralyzed 
as their bodies, numbed by drugs, counting the beats of their heart, praying to 
die. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not like that," he says. "I have ambitions. I want to be somebody. It 
won't be easy." He pauses. "But then nothing is." 
</P>
<P>
Firouzi is painting again as I leave, the brush clutched tightly in his teeth. 
The clown face is gleaming white, the eyes an electric blue. The respirator 
breathes softly into the silence.

MAN CLAIMS HE HAD SEX WITH HUDSON'S EX-LOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Attorneys for Rock Hudson's estate, seeking to overturn the recent 
$21.75-million jury award to the actor's ex-lover Marc Christian, have made 
public a sworn statement from a man who claims that Christian had sex with him 
six weeks after Hudson's death in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The allegation by the Orange County resident, estate attorneys contend, calls 
into question Christian's credibility. 
</P>
<P>
In the court document filed Monday, Gunther Albert Fraulob, a personal physical 
trainer from Laguna Niguel, states that he first met Christian at a memorial 
service for Hudson, who died Oct. 2, 1985, of acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome. Before the two had sex, he said, Christian assured him that "he was 
safe, he was fine and he was healthy." 
</P>
<P>
Christian, who has shown no medical signs of AIDS, won the massive award for 
allegedly having suffered emotional trauma because Hudson and his private 
secretary concealed the fact that the popular actor had the fatal disease. 
</P>
<P>
During the novel trial that concluded in mid-February, Christian testified that 
he has remained celibate since Hudson's death because of his continuing fear 
that he may have contracted the AIDS-related virus from Hudson. 
</P>
<P>
Fraulob's statement, which was labeled as false by Christian's attorney, was 
filed as part of a lengthy motion for a new trial by the estate's lawyers, who 
argue that Fraulob's newly discovered allegations are highly material, being 
the first evidence "directly contradicting (Christian's) testimony on the 
critical issue of fear." 
</P>
<P>
A hearing is set for April 7. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview Monday afternoon, Fraulob said he came forward because 
"Marc Christian is lying, and he's doing it for one obvious reason -- to make 
money." 
</P>
<P>
Fraulob, 32, said he did not disclose his alleged relationship with Christian 
during the trial because "I didn't want to drag my name through the mud . . . 
(and) I didn't think my involvement would help the case in any way." 
</P>
<P>
Fraulob described himself as a platonic friend of Hudson. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe (Christian) has AIDS, because he told me that," Fraulob said. 
"But I'm sure that if everything was proven different, then I was exposed to it 
. . .." In that case, Fraulob said, "I'm sure I'd take him to court to sue him 
for exposing me to the virus." 
</P>
<P>
Christian's attorney, Harold Rhoden, said his client "categorically denies that 
there is any truth in this, other than the fact that Fraulob did talk to Marc 
Christian at the time of the wake . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Estate attorney Robert Parker Mills said he was "satisfied with the 
truthfulness" of Fraulob's allegations and challenged Christian "to take a lie 
detector test. . . ."

DRUG ABUSE IS IN OUR BACKYARDS; 
</P>
<P>
THE REACTION IN LAKE VIEW TERRACE SABOTAGES THE FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCHELL S. ROSENTHAL, Mitchell S. Rosenthal is a psychiatrist and president 
of the Phoenix House Foundation, which provides services to prevent and treat 
drug abuse in California and New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
America isn't winning the war against drugs because the nation has the same 
problem its drug abusers do. Addicts aren't only hooked on drugs, they're 
hooked on denial, too. And so are we. Addicts deny dependency. We deny 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
We want to battle drugs at the border and not at home. We'd rather pressure 
Latin Americans to stop producing drugs than pressure our fellow Americans to 
stop using them. And, while we believe in treatment for drug abusers, we'd like 
it kept far away and out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
"Not in my backyard" (the NIMBY reaction) is close to a conditioned community 
response to drug treatment centers these days. So there's nothing unique about 
the situation in the San Fernando Valley community of Lake View Terrace, where 
some local homeowners are fighting to keep a drug rehabilitation center from 
opening, in spite of a city zoning administrator's decision permitting the 
center to open. What makes this conflict newsworthy is the name of the 
particular facility -- the Nancy Reagan Center. 
</P>
<P>
Center opponents have cast themselves as embattled homesteaders, fighting for 
self-determination against Mrs. Reagan and Phoenix House, the national 
nonprofit organization proposing the center. They see themselves as a band of 
local Davids holding a gang of Goliaths at bay, protecting the peace, safety 
and property values of Lake View Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
But this view of the dispute, which colors much news media coverage, obscures 
harsher realities. It conceals the true nature of the opposition, the drug 
problems of Lake View Terrace itself and the pressing need for drug treatment 
in Greater Los Angeles. It ignores the victims of the controversy -- most of 
them teen-agers -- who would be denied care while the center is kept from 
opening. And it cloaks in civic virtue the kind of denial and indifference that 
has allowed drug abuse to take root and flourish in this country. 
</P>
<P>
I have been fighting drug abuse for more than a quarter of a century, and I 
know that the most difficult enemies to overcome are not drugs themselves or 
drug traffickers. Public attitudes are the toughest opponents -- tolerance for 
drug use, ambivalance about drug laws and denial of drug problems. Communities, 
like families, are too often reluctant to recognize and confront home-grown 
drug problems and more willing to accept danger and loss than responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
While communities throughout the country have managed to keep drug treatment 
centers out, they have been less than successful in barring drug dealers. In 
Los Angeles, the situation is critical. The Drug Enforcement Administration, 
which seized 15 tons of cocaine here recently, has labeled the city "the 
cocaine consumption capital of the country," and cocaine deaths in Los Angeles 
have risen to more than 800 in 1987, from 176 in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Children are among the chief victims -- and not just the more than 2,500 
drug-abusing runaways on the streets of Hollywood. All children are at risk. 
But only a handful of youngsters are getting the kind of long-term residential 
treatment many of them need to overcome dependency and the problems that are at 
the root of drug abuse. According the Los Angeles County Department of Health 
Services, only 93 teens in Los Angeles County now get publicly funded long-term 
rehabilitation. And there is no other affordable, long-term care for 
adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
But such care is just what Phoenix House will provide at the Nancy Reagan 
Center -- and in a community with its own drug problems. Last fall four persons 
were killed in a drug shoot-out only blocks from the proposed center site, and 
authorities seized a Lake View Terrace "crack house" earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, to opponents of the center, drugs aren't the problem, Phoenix House is. 
The opposition exists even though there has not been a single incident that 
would justify concern for community security during the 22 years Phoenix House 
has operated more than two dozen anti-drug facilities. Indeed, the presence of 
Phoenix House facilities has invariably reduced local drug traffic and crime. 
Local property values, unaffected by the presence of Phoenix House facilities, 
have reflected areawide trends, rising sharply, for example, in areas like 
Manhattan's West Side. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, opponents are determined to block city approval of the center. 
They threaten to hold up the process for as long as possible. But each day of 
delay means one less day of treatment for the 150 teen-agers and 60 adults the 
center will serve. By denying care to the victims of drug addiction -- the most 
vicious problem threatening Los Angeles -- they make all Angelenos pay a harsh 
price for their obstructionism. 
</P>
<P>
What's going on in Lake View Terrace isn't a David-and-Goliath confrontation or 
a battle over self-determination. It's a manifestation of social 
irresponsibility and the kind of stubborn self-interest that makes drug abuse 
so difficult to overcome everywhere in America. 
</P>
<P>
Our nation cannot successfully fight drugs while we have tolerance for drug use 
or misguided sympathy for those who abet the spread of drug abuse by denying 
the problem or delaying the solution. The Lake View Terrace dispute is 
everyone's fight. And it is newsworthy not because Mrs. Reagan's Center is 
involved but because it so clearly shows how the NIMBY reaction sabotages the 
war against drugs.

L.A. MAY SUPPLY ANIMALS TO PIERCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles officials said Monday they will consider supplying animals from 
city shelters to Pierce College's veterinary aide program in the wake of a Los 
Angeles County decision to remove its animals from the school. 
</P>
<P>
William Putney, vice president of the Board of Animal Regulation Commissioners, 
said he and city staff members will meet with Pierce College officials to 
discuss a possible contractual agreement that would permit students to practice 
veterinary skills on shelter animals. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the county's Department of Animal Care and Control canceled its 
animal-care agreement with Pierce College after learning that students were 
using the animals for what county officials said were unauthorized procedures, 
including the insertion of catheters and intravenous tubes. 
</P>
<P>
The 14 dogs and cats involved were not in pain or traumatized, but county 
officials said the college violated a 1982 informal agreement by using the 
animals for the practice of clinical procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the students, who are learning how to become veterinary assistants, 
have been using their own pets to practice skills necessary to complete their 
studies, said Irene Pinkard, dean of the college's vocational schools. The 
school does not have the funds to privately purchase animals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Need for 'Hands-On Skills' 
</P>
<P>
Putney, who is a retired veterinarian, told the commission that "hands-on 
skills" for treating animals are important for proper training. "They have to 
have animals from somewhere," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A 1980 city ordinance prohibits the sale of shelter animals for medical 
research or experimentation. 
</P>
<P>
The city board agreed only to set up a meeting with Pierce officials to 
determine if an agreement could be worked out that would not violate the spirit 
of the law. Such a contractual agreement would require City Council approval. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be we can't do it," Putney said. "But maybe we can set up limitations 
in the contract that would make it permissible under law." Such details would 
include limits on the number of times an animal could be X-rayed or have blood 
drawn. 
</P>
<P>
Pinkard said she was delighted by the city offer.

LOPEZ CANYON TO STAY OPEN, STATE RULES AFTER TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state will not close Los Angeles' only public trash dump because only low 
levels of toxic substances were found during air and underground gas tests, a 
spokesman for the California Waste Management Board said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"The results came in and they showed there's nothing to worry about at all," 
spokesman Chris Peck said. 
</P>
<P>
Peck, however, defended the state board's rder on Thursday to close Lopez 
Canyon Landfill until testing was completed. The order came after the 
hospitalization of two city sanitation workers who inhaled fumes at the dump. 
When the city and county balked at the order, state officials flew in for a 
meeting Friday, after which they decided to wait for the test results. 
</P>
<P>
"When it comes down to public health and safety, the board would much rather be 
accused of overreacting than of not acting soon enough," Peck said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gets Half of City's Trash 
</P>
<P>
Lopez Canyon Landfill receives more than half of the estimated 6,000 to 7,000 
tons of household trash produced daily in the city of Los Angeles. The rest 
goes to two private landfills and to one operated under a county contract. 
</P>
<P>
Test results, released Monday, "showed constituents that are typical of 
landfill gas, in some cases particularly odorous landfill gases . . . but no 
immediate hazard to anyone in the neighborhood," said Carol Coy, senior 
enforcement officer with the South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
However, the district will conduct round-the-clock air sampling later this week 
in the residential areas of Lake View Terrace and Kagel Canyon because of the 
continuing mystery over what sickened the sanitation workers. 
</P>
<P>
Two workers fainted and several others complained of nausea and headaches after 
digging into 1982-vintage trash while excavating for a road March 8. One of the 
workers was hospitalized for 11 days. 
</P>
<P>
Because the city waited several days before notifying the district and because 
gas dissipates quickly, Coy said it cannot be said for certain what made the 
workers ill. 
</P>
<P>
But investigators believe that the cause may have been hydrogen sulfide gas -- 
a common product of decaying manure -- found at levels of 16 parts per million 
in some of the seven tests for underground gases, Coy said. 
</P>
<P>
Levels of 10 to 16 p.p.m. are common at Los Angeles landfills, Coy said. There 
is no statewide health limit set for hydrogen sulfide gas because research on 
the chemical is incomplete, she said. But in enclosed industrial settings, 
workers must wear a respirator when levels are at 10 p.p.m., Coy said. 
</P>
<P>
Three air samples taken Thursday did not identify gas or fumes at unhealthful 
levels, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Road Work Stops

Excavation for the landfill road is at a standstill because of the accident, 
said Michael Miller, assistant director of the city Bureau of Sanitation. And 
the city must obtain a permit from the district before work can resume. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the district cited the landfill for proceeding without the 
permit. Such a permit requires testing of ground gases, Coy said. Other 
excavation on the site, where a district-ordered gas extraction system must be 
installed by July, has also halted while a landfill consultant reviews dump 
operations, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to assure ourselves that nothing like this ever happens again," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Landfill opponents who live near Lopez Canyon were pleased with news of 
neighborhood air sampling but unhappy that the state decided not to close the 
dump. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm terribly disappointed," said Rob Zapple, a member of the Kagel Canyon 
Civic Assn. "Why don't they shut it down now and finish the gas recovery 
system?"

REFLECTIONS: 'I WONDER IF THEY GOT THERE BECAUSE OF ME, IN SPITE OF ME OR MAYBE 
TO SPITE ME.'

Rolfe Rahl was comfortable as the winning B team football coach at Taft High 
School in Woodland Hills. The day they made him girls' gymnastics coach, he 
became a little nervous. Rahl teaches driver's education at Taft. He and his 
wife, Norma, live in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
I never had any goals. I just did things. I played football and participated in 
track in high school, and I had some scholarship deals, so I thought, "I'll go 
to college." I started as a P.E. major because I just didn't think of anything 
else. You get involved in it, and you just start something. If I'd started 
something else, I'd probably ended up someplace else. 
</P>
<P>
I played football a year at UCLA, but after I got married, it was a hassle just 
trying to stay alive and get through school and support my wife. Of course 
everything was relatively cheap then. We had a little house for $27. 
</P>
<P>
After the Army, I finished graduate school at UCLA. I taught P.E. at Pacoima 
Junior for about six years and then I came to Taft. The B football job opened 
up here in about '68. So I started coaching B football, and I just quit this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
At one time, the kids here were just outstanding. If you were carrying 
something, some kid would say, "Coach, can I carry that for you?" They were 
just wonderful kids, talented kids. We had a great record for about 12 or 13 
years. 
</P>
<P>
I had a couple of years when we did all right win-loss, but I didn't like the 
kids' attitudes. Then this year I got about 60 kids that were just marvelous. 
They were pretty good athletes, and they were just great kids. And we won the 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
I thought, "I might as well quit now while everybody thinks I know something." 
I had a good relationship with the team and I thought, "This is the way to 
finish." 
</P>
<P>
I don't like to get real close to kids. I have difficulty verbally kicking a 
kid in the butt for doing something wrong and then putting my arm around him 
and then yelling at him again. I think they like me, but they don't ever get 
too close to me because I don't allow them to. This year after the last game, 
they hugged me and so forth. I didn't say anything, but this was a big deal for 
me. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, the girls' gymnastics coach quit, and I got stuck with it. I 
had never seen a gymnastics meet, and I had no idea how to handle girls. 
</P>
<P>
You're with boys all your life, and now I walked into the first gymnastics 
practice, and I got about 30 or 40 girls. They're beautiful kids, girls with 
leotards on, upside down, and you're grabbing them and spottin' them and I 
thought, "This is terrible. I'm embarrassed." The next thing I know, somebody's 
bumping into me and I thought, "I'm not going to make it." The first couple of 
days I was afraid to touch them. 
</P>
<P>
Finally I just told myself, "Look, I'm not grabbing anybody in the wrong place 
on purpose. I'll just do what I think is right and if I happen to hit 'em, 
they'll know that's part of it." That relaxed me and I don't think I ever had a 
kid feel that I was taking advantage of her. That made me feel good. 
</P>
<P>
I had talented kids, and the only gymnastics team that could beat us was El 
Camino because they had a talented coach. Well about six years after I got 
divorced, she got divorced, and I met her at an officiating thing. So we got 
married. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. Norma's real good. She knows what I'm 
talking about because she coached teams. You come home upset, and she knows 
why. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think a month goes by that I don't get a couple of phone calls or a 
letter from kids that I coached. I get letters from New York, I get Valentines, 
I get birthday presents. 
</P>
<P>
I think I have influenced people. I've coached enough of them. But I wonder if 
they got there because of me, in spite of me or maybe to spite me. 
</P>
<P>
That's what's wrong with being a teacher. You see, a carpenter builds a house, 
and he can come back 10 years later and say, "I built that house." But a kid's 
a success or he's a failure; you have no idea how much you had to do with it. 
You don't have a product that you can say, "I did that."

WOMAN ADMITS KILLING MAN, NEW GIRLFRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman has pleaded guilty to second-degree murder for shooting her former 
lover and his girlfriend in their Panorama City apartment, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Charisse Lewis, 33, will be sentenced April 11 in Van Nuys Superior Court. She 
faces a sentence of 15 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
She was arrested in October in Chicago after seeking treatment for sickle cell 
anemia, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen Baron. Lewis fled after the July 17 
killings, and authorities alerted hospitals to notify them if she sought 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
She was originally charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of Jewel 
Prude, 34, the man with whom she had lived for two years, and Shirley Marie 
Johnson, 35. Prosecutors agreed to allow Lewis to plead guilty to the lesser 
charge as part of a plea agreement.

YOUTH SENT TO PRISON FOR 17 YEARS IN SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A reputed gang member has been sentenced to 17 years in prison for the shooting 
death of a 10-year-old boy near Pacoima Park. 
</P>
<P>
Joaquin Garcia, 18, was also sentenced Friday to an additional three years in 
prison for possession of homemade knives found in his jail cell. 
</P>
<P>
A San Fernando Superior Court jury convicted Garcia in July in the fatal 
shooting of Alejandro Salazar. The child died after a ricocheting bullet struck 
him in the back of the head as he played with a group of children near Pacoima 
Park on July 19, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia testified that he had fired his .25-caliber automatic pistol to scare 
away two rival gang members who he believed were beating up a 14-year-old 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, Garcia fired several shots in the direction of the gang 
members, one of which ricocheted off the street and struck Salazar.

OWNER OF APARTMENTS FACES SAFETY CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The owner of a Burbank apartment building, whose residents were forced to 
evacuate last week because of hazardous conditions, will be arraigned next 
month on charges of violating building and fire-safety codes, officials said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Jenkins, 40, of Agoura Hills was charged Monday in Burbank Municipal 
Court with 15 misdemeanor counts, said Deputy City Atty. Mary F. Riley. Jenkins 
was ordered to appear in court April 3 to answer the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Riley said that live electrical wires were discovered dangling from the 
ceilings of some of the building's units and that extension cords were being 
used for permanent electrical wiring. She added that inspectors discovered fire 
exits blocked with furniture. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins had refused to repair dangerous conditions at the two-story building at 
223 E. Santa Anita Ave. for at least 1 1/2 years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Eight families who were living in the building were evacuated by city officials 
and moved to a nearby motel Wednesday. Riley said Jenkins has promised to make 
extensive repairs to the building but that the residents will stay at the motel 
until further notice.

TRUMP TRIES TO CUT PRICE OF SHUTTLE; EASTERN SAYS IT WILL LOOK AT NEW BIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT E. DALLOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Billionaire real estate magnate Donald J. Trump said Monday that he is no 
longer prepared to pay crippled Eastern Airlines $365 million for its lucrative 
Northeast Shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours, Eastern told Trump that it had received other "substantial 
unsolicited offers" for the shuttle, which has two routes: New York-Washington 
and New York-Boston. A statement issued by the airline said it is its 
"obligation to all of its constituencies -- creditors, shareholders, employees 
and the communities and traveling public we serve -- to ensure that any shuttle 
sale is completed on the best possible terms for Eastern." 
</P>
<P>
It said it would solicit offers from other potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Trump, who agreed last October to buy the shuttle, told Eastern Chairman Frank 
Lorenzo in a letter that his decision was a result of Eastern's current 
problems -- a strike by its machinists and pilots and its subsequent filing for 
protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy laws. "The shuttle has 
become an entirely different business in that its market share and customer 
base may be lost for some time to come, if not forever," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worth Up to $125 Million 
</P>
<P>
In a return letter to Trump, Barry P. Simon, senior vice president of Eastern, 
said one offer came in as recently as Monday. Eastern declined to identify any 
of the interested parties. 
</P>
<P>
However, one informed source, who declined to be identified, said millionaire 
Los Angeles businessmen Marvin Davis is one of those interested in the shuttle. 
Another is Jay Pritzker, the Chicago hotel owner who once owned a major share 
of Braniff Airlines. Neither Davis nor Pritzker could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Trump said in an interview Monday that the shuttle, which operates 62 flights 
daily, is now worth $100 million to $125 million less than he originally agreed 
to pay for it. "I bought an asset and it was a different asset three weeks ago 
than it is today. It is an asset that has been decimated." 
</P>
<P>
The flamboyant Trump, who is known for stamping his name on just about 
everything he owns, had planned to call the airline the Trump Shuttle. The 
shuttle operation is widely used by business travelers during the week, but 
Trump planned to use it on weekends to carry gamblers to his two Atlantic City, 
N.J., casinos. 
</P>
<P>
"Last fall, I agreed to buy a fully operational shuttle which held nearly 60% 
of the market, commanded the principal loyalty and confidence of business 
travelers, and provided excellent service to the customer," the Trump letter 
said. "However, today the business is worth considerably less than the price 
negotiated last fall and it will take a great amount of time and a great deal 
of money to bring the shuttle back to the position which it previously 
enjoyed." 
</P>
<P>
The sale of the shuttle had passed all required government hurdles and was to 
have been finalized soon. "I could close this in a week," Trump said, "if they 
could make a deal on the price." In his letter, he emphasized that he is still 
interested in acquiring the shuttle -- but only at a lower price. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the machinists walked out at Eastern on March 4, the airline had 
lost much of its Northeast shuttle market share to its rival, the Pan Am 
Shuttle. Pan Am, which claims to have had a 48% share of the Northeast shuttle 
market before the strike, declined to comment on Trump's action Monday. It says 
its planes are flying full and that it has had to add many extra sections. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Valuable Gates 
</P>
<P>
The shuttle is one of Eastern's few profitable operations. It is said to yield 
about 38 cents per passenger revenue mile, compared to an average of 12 to 16 
cents for the airline industry as a whole. (To record a revenue passenger mile, 
an airline must carry one paying passenger one mile.) 
</P>
<P>
Eastern's shuttle is valuable also for the gates it owns at New York's 
LaGuardia Airport and Washington National Airport and for its landing slots, 
which are limited at the two airports. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said Trump is simply trying to take advantage of Eastern's 
troubles. "I think he is posturing himself," said Raymond Neidl, an analyst 
with McCarthy, Crisanti &amp; Maffei, a New York stock brokerage. "I think that 
Trump is being Trump. He wants to see if he can get a better bargain. Maybe it 
will work and maybe it won't." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special Fares 
</P>
<P>
Eastern has tried various gimmicks to lure people to the shuttle since the 
strike began. For example, it cut fares to $12 one-way for one weekend. And it 
tried to appeal to business travelers for a time by cutting weekday one-way 
fares to $49 from $99. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, it came up with another, saying that it would return fares to any 
travelers whose first-section flights depart more than five minutes late. The 
airline operates second sections of scheduled flights once the first section is 
full. 
</P>
<P>
In another development Monday, a federal judge in New York filed a preliminary 
injunction barring workers at four New York commuter railroads from honoring 
picket lines of Eastern workers if they were to be set up. The effect of the 
orders will be to keep the airline strike from also shutting down the 
railroads.

SOME GRAPES GET TO MARKET, BUT TONS GO TO SEED

Shoppers will find Chilean grapes back on the market this week as federal 
inspectors begin checking stored fruit today, releasing what is deemed safe for 
human consumption. 
</P>
<P>
"They're going to attempt to save what they can," said a relieved Jeff Waite, 
manager of Pacific Cold Storage in City of Industry. "I've got 6 million pounds 
of fruit in here!" 
</P>
<P>
More imported grapes are stored at the Christian Salvesen facility in La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated $20 million worth of fruit, at retail prices, is being held at 
docks and airports around the United States. An additional $4 million worth is 
on the way, and $15 million more remains in Chile awaiting clearance for 
shipment, according to the federal Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Initial reports late last week indicated that all Chilean fruit already 
unloaded and moved beyond docks and airports would be destroyed after the 
discovery by federal inspectors of two cyanide-tainted grapes in a cargo 
received at the Port of Philadelphia on March 8. Produce that grocers and 
wholesalers pulled off the market last week will have to be destroyed, said 
Gordon Scott, a spokesman for the Food and Drug Administration in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Inspection was stepped up after the U.S. Embassy in Santiago received two 
anonymous telephone calls since March 3 warning, in Spanish, that Chile's 
exported fruit was poisoned. No other poisoned samples have turned up, the FDA 
said, but a third warning call was received over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA and importers worked out inspection procedures acceptable to the 
government in weekend discussions, Scott said. The procedures cover grapes in 
storage as well as air-freighted berries at Los Angeles International Airport. 
Talks continue on how to clear other untainted fruit varieties, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 20 persons, newly hired by importers, underwent intensive training 
Monday at Pacific Cold Storage. Workers painstakingly scrutinized each grape on 
every bunch in a carton under the close supervision of FDA technicians teaching 
them the telltale signs of food tampering and cyanide poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
Once formal inspections begin today, the new inspectors will check a 5% sample 
of all stored grapes and air-freighted strawberries, blackberries, raspberries 
and blueberries. FDA technicians will double-check 1% of that sample, Scott 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disposal Is Costly 
</P>
<P>
Fruit passing these inspections will then be labeled "Safe for Human 
Consumption" and released for sale. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a strong possibility that we'll have product (appearing in markets) 
Wednesday night or Thursday morning," said Mark Berlinger, a salesman with 
David Oppenheimer-California, which imports about one-third of the Chilean 
fruit that moves through the adjacent ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
David Oppenheimer has about 1,200 unbroken pallets of grapes in storage, he 
estimated. Each pallet contains about a ton of fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Waite said fruit that rots before inspection or for which no satisfactory 
procedure can be devised will have to be trucked to landfills. The nearest to 
Los Angeles is 200 miles away, at Kettleman Hills, just west of Interstate 5 in 
the San Joaquin Valley. Waite said dumping would cost about $20 a ton, roughly 
one pallet. 
</P>
<P>
"I have 4,000 pallets on hand," he said. Labor and hauling charges would be 
extra.

THE LAST FERRIES;

ABOARD THE SS BADGER 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a frigid, blustery morning on Lake Michigan not long ago as the 412-foot 
Badger, one of the last of the Great Lakes auto ferries, sliced through the ice 
leaving Ludington, Mich., bound northwest for Kewaunee, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
On clear days, land fades from sight about an hour out on the 62-mile, 
four-hour crossing. But on this gloomy, cloudy day, as the coal-fired steamer 
was buffeted by chill winds, Michigan's shoreline vanished in just a few 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
With its bow designed like that of an icebreaker, the Badger cuts through ice 
like a knife through butter. About once every 30 years the lake freezes solid 
all the way across, with ice 10 to 15 feet thick. But this was mild winter, and 
most of the lake remained free of ice. 
</P>
<P>
"For mid-Americans this is a Christopher Columbus experience -- sailing on a 
ship out of sight of land," allowed the Badger's silver-haired skipper, Gus 
Barth, 63, in the wheelhouse of the 37-year-old vessel. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all alone out here, orphans this time of the year. During summer, the 
lake is alive with ships -- with freighters, ore boats, coal boats, with ships 
flying foreign flags. But not now. Just us," the crusty skipper mused. With his 
46 years on the water -- both on the Great Lakes and at sea during World War II 
-- his shipmates call him the "ancient mariner." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hanging in the Balance 
</P>
<P>
Barth and the 38 members of the Badger's crew hope that the Great Lakes ferries 
will still be operating this summer and for years to come. But the future is in 
doubt for the Badger and for the only two other ferries left. 
</P>
<P>
A decision is due by July 1 on whether to keep them plying their year-round 
route between Wisconsin and lower Michigan. The decision will depend on whether 
the ferry operator can obtain guarantees of adequate commercial business, 
mainly from railroads. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen automobile and railroad ferry boats crisscrossed Lake Michigan as 
recently as the early 1970s, connecting the Wisconsin cities of Milwaukee, 
Manitowac and Kewaunee with Muskegon, Ludington and Frankfort on the Michigan 
side. 
</P>
<P>
Large ferry boats have been important commercial carriers between the two 
states since the 1850s, saving hundreds of miles of road travel. Since the 
1890s, they have been operated by the railroads and carry rail cars as well as 
automobiles, trucks and passengers. Five railroads owned and operated the 
ships, but after the government deregulated transportation in the 1970s the 
ships were gradually abandoned until only the ones operated by the Chesapeake 
&amp; Ohio (now part of CSX Corp.) were left. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in 1983, C&amp;O was granted permission to abandon its ferry system, 
but Glen Bowden, who is now 63 and a lifelong resident of Ludington, came to 
the rescue. Bowden, owner of a construction business and the 65-room Stearns 
Motor Inn, bought the ferry boat line for $3 -- in effect paying $1 each for 
the ferries: the City of Midland, built in 1941, and the sister ships Badger, 
built in 1952, and Spartan, a year younger. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agreements Honored 
</P>
<P>
Bowden has been operating only one of the three boats at a time, two round-trip 
crossings seven days a week from mid-June through Labor Day and one round trip 
five days a week the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the purchase agreement, Bowden promised to honor existing agreements 
with 10 maritime and labor unions representing 160 employees for a six-year 
period ending July 1, 1989. C&amp;O agreed to pay 20% of the $20-million 
payroll for the six-year period, with Bowden picking up the rest. 
</P>
<P>
"If the ferry service ceases, Ludington (population 9,000) will become a ghost 
town," Bowden said in an interview. "It is the lifeline of the community. We 
have been promoting and advertising the ferry service throughout the Midwest. 
Last year was our best year. We carried 90,000 passengers, 24,000 cars and 
trucks and 3,800 rail cars. Our revenue has been increasing each of the past 
six years." 
</P>
<P>
But it has been a costly undertaking. Bowden said the ferries have been losing 
$300,000 to $500,000 a year. Yet, he is optimistic, believing that revenue from 
the increased traffic he expects will move the operation out of the red. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have walked away from this at any time," he said, "but I'm stubborn. 
The end of the ferry service could mean the end of my motel and many businesses 
in town. The local Chamber of Commerce says $10 million in tourist dollars a 
year would be lost if the ferry shut down." 
</P>
<P>
One-third of the ferry operation's income comes from carrying rail cars, 
two-thirds from automobiles and trucks, mostly summer vacationers. Bowden hopes 
that traffic will increase this summer to the point where he can have two 
ferries in service. He dreams of a time when all three might operate. 
</P>
<P>
In summer, the largest boat, the City of Midland, carries 609 passengers, 23 
rail cars and up to 180 automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
But on the recent wintry day, the company and its passengers faced cold 
reality. There was only a handful of people on the Badger for the two-way 
crossing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Safer Than Driving 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after coming aboard the Badger in Ludington, Elaine Voight, 22, bedded 
down her daughter, Heather, four months, and son, Eric, 2, in a state room. The 
one-way trip costs $22; children 5 to 15, $11, and under 5, free. Fare for a 
car, not including passengers, is $32. A state room is $10 extra. 
</P>
<P>
Voight had been visiting her parents in Unionville, Mich., and was returning 
with her children to her home in River Falls, Wis. "Roads are treacherous in 
this part of the country in winter. It's a lot safer crossing the lake on the 
ferry than driving nearly 500 miles around the lake through Chicago," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Badger has many of the amenities of a cruise ship: deck chairs, lounges, 
dining room and state rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Hughes, 51, of Luther, Mich., en route to Minneapolis on a business trip, 
sits in the empty main lounge watching television. "What a bargain," he 
exclaimed. "In winter, this ship is like being on a private cruise. Nobody's 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Lashey, 41, a cook on the ships for 24 years, said, "My father, my 
grandfather and three uncles all worked for the Lake Michigan ferry boats. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started, it seemed like this was a job with a future. Now, nobody knows 
how long any of us will be working."

T-Bill Rates Rise: Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities rose to the 
highest level in more than four years. The Treasury Department sold $7.2 
billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 9%, up from 8.69% 
last week. Another $7.2 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average 
discount rate of 9.04%, up from 8.76% last week. The rates were the highest 
since Oct. 29, 1984, when three-month bills sold for 9.38% and since six-month 
bills averaged 9.07% on Nov. 5, 1984. The latest 9.04% average for six-month 
bills had been matched on March 18, 1985. The new discount rates understate the 
actual return to investors -- 9.34% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill 
selling for $9,772.50, and 9.60% for a six-month bill selling for $9,543.

SelecTV Off the Air: SelecTV subscribers who switched on Channel 22 in Los 
Angeles looked at a snowy television screen instead of a scheduled movie Monday 
evening because of the financial woes of SelecTV of California Inc., which last 
week filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition and failed to pay KWHY for Monday's 
air time. KWHY President Burt I. Harris Jr. said he would consider putting the 
service back on the air if a payment is made today. SelecTV President Thomas C. 
Hunt said: "I'm quite sure we'll get it resolved . . . . It's our intention to 
get service resumed."

Polaroid Developments: A Delaware judge granted an injunction sought by 
Shamrock Holdings Inc. to keep Polaroid from completing its share repurchase 
program, one of the key elements in the instant camera firm's fight against 
Shamrock's $45-a-share takeover bid. Shamrock, a radio and television concern 
owned by the Roy E. Disney family, owns about 4.8 million shares of Polaroid 
and is waging a proxy fight for control of the board. Polaroid has been 
resisting Burbank-based Shamrock's bid since July. Shamrock had said that if 
the injunction was not granted, it would tender its 4.9 million Polaroid 
shares. The injunction was granted for one week while Shamrock appeals the 
judge's rulings of last week to the Delaware Supreme Court.

Micronics Records Subpoenaed: Pentagon criminal investigators probing 
allegations that faulty electronic parts were placed in thousands of tactical 
missiles subpoenaed eight years of business records from Micronics 
International, a Brea defense contractor that has been the subject of a 
criminal inquiry since last summer. The records concern Micronics' dealings 
with Asher Engineering of Baldwin Park, a subcontractor that alleges it was 
following orders from Micronics when it falsely certified that the parts met 
military specifications. Failure of the switches could affect the reliability 
of most of the nation's air-launched missiles. G. Addison Appleby, chairman and 
chief executive of Micronics' parent firm, Precision Aerotech of La Jolla, said 
a member of Precision's board was launching an internal investigation of the 
charges. Micronics has denied any wrongdoing.

CHINA TO SLOW PACE OF MARKET REFORMS; 
</P>
<P>
NEW REGULATIONS NEEDED TO DEAL WITH CHANGES, PREMIER SAYS

China will move forward with a modernization program based on market-oriented 
reforms and planned improvement of the nation's economic infrastructure, 
Premier Li Peng said Monday in a speech to China's legislature. 
</P>
<P>
In a wide-ranging two-hour address at the opening session of the National 
People's Congress, Li briefly reviewed the economic accomplishments of 1988, 
citing 11.2% growth in gross national product, a 9.3% increase in industrial 
labor productivity and a 24% jump in foreign trade. 
</P>
<P>
Li's focus, however, was on policies aimed at cutting inflation and laying the 
groundwork for more balanced economic expansion. Inflation ran at an official 
rate of 26% last year, and Li acknowledged that "the actual living standards of 
a considerable number of urban residents dropped." 
</P>
<P>
Overly rapid growth of light industrial production and excessive investment in 
construction projects contributed to inflationary pressures by putting too much 
strain on the supply of raw and semi-finished materials, energy and 
transportation, Li said. 
</P>
<P>
While the country has moved away from the use of planning and administrative 
orders to control the economy, it has not yet fully developed the laws and 
regulations necessary to maintain order in a market economy, he added. 
</P>
<P>
To deal with these problems, the government plans to focus its efforts over the 
next two or more years on slowing the pace of economic growth; directing 
investment toward agriculture, energy, transportation and raw material supply, 
and enacting laws capable of regulating a market economy, Li said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Austerity Ahead 
</P>
<P>
While China's leadership recognizes "the importance of price reform in the 
economic restructuring as a whole," major price reforms are being postponed for 
at least two years while the government focuses on solving other problems, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Li also sought to cool expectations of rapid rises in living standards. "Both 
government and people should be mentally prepared for a few years of 
austerity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a move intended to decrease opportunities for corruption and encourage 
enterprises to respond to market forces, the government is pressing forward 
with changes aimed at increasing the autonomy of state-owned enterprises, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past six months, out of about 24,000 companies that were being 
directly run by government or Communist Party agencies, about 20,000 have 
either become autonomous, merged with other companies or shut down, Li said. 
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that state-owned companies must be autonomous "in matters of 
finance, materials supply and wages" and must not engage in the "illegal resale 
of goods at exorbitant profit." 
</P>
<P>
China has a two-tiered pricing system. Many commodities are available to 
approved purchasers at low controlled prices but are also sold at much higher 
prices on free markets. This dual system creates great opportunities for 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
In order to trim inflationary deficits, the State Council, China's Cabinet, has 
decided to reduce central government expenditures this year in all areas except 
education, Li said. 
</P>
<P>
People at all levels of government should "highly value" the "long-term 
strategic importance" of education, Li said. Central government funding of 
education will rise 15.4% this year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wants More Exports 
</P>
<P>
The government also will promote greater use of scientific and technological 
expertise for industrial production, Li said. 
</P>
<P>
Li called for continued efforts to promote the development of an 
export-oriented economy in China's coastal regions, especially the processing 
and re-export of imported raw and semi-finished materials. The import of 
high-grade consumer products should be restricted, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Establishment of 5,896 foreign-funded enterprises was approved last year, 
setting a record, and China intends to further improve its investment 
environment, Li said. "We shall encourage foreign businessmen to establish more 
wholly owned enterprises in China and more joint ventures and cooperative 
enterprises," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Li also touched briefly on international relations. He called for continued 
expansion of Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations, scientific and technical 
cooperation and friendly contacts in various fields. He also said the 
improvement under way in Sino-Soviet relations will contribute to world peace 
and do no harm to the interests of any third country. 
</P>
<P>
Most top state and party leaders appeared on stage at the Great Hall of the 
People for Li's speech, but Deng Xiaoping, 84, China's paramount leader, did 
not attend. There was no official explanation for his absence. It was not an 
event that required his attendance. 
</P>
<P>
The annual session of the congress -- a body with little real power whose main 
function is to discuss and approve decisions made by the State Council and the 
ruling Communist Party Politburo -- is scheduled to last 16 days.

WARRANT OUT FOR DETECTIVE WITH ROLE IN WAYNE DIVORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
An arrest warrant has been issued for the owner of a detective agency hired by 
Aissa Wayne's ex-husband as the second suspect in a brutal assault last October 
against her and her boyfriend, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
The warrant, filed last week in Harbor Municipal Court, seeks the arrest of O. 
Daniel Gal in connection with the assault on Wayne, daughter of the late actor 
John Wayne, and financier Roger W. Luby at Luby's Newport Beach estate last 
Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
The warrant charges Gal with criminal conspiracy, assault with a deadly weapon, 
assault on a person with a firearm, and using force or violence on a witness, 
according to court records filed with Harbor Municipal Judge Russell A. 
Bostrom. Jerrel L. Hintergardt, a former employee of Gal's Los Angeles-based 
firm, was arrested Friday by Newport Beach police on the same warrant. 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents filed Feb. 27, witnesses have told police that 
they saw Gal parked on the street near Luby's walled estate on the morning of 
the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Hintergardt, 37, of Burbank was being held Monday in Orange County Jail in lieu 
of $1-million bail, police said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suspect Was in Europe 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement sources said the arrest warrant originally was sealed to 
prevent Gal from learning that he was a target of the investigation. According 
to court documents, Gal was in Europe during February and would tell 
investigators only that he was returning in about a month. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Gal nor his representatives returned telephone calls left at his office 
in Century City. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans said the bail for Hintergardt was set 
high because of the seriousness of the charges and because authorities feared 
that he, too, would flee to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a crime that is basically a contract assault," Evans said Monday. "It 
is clearly a hazardous and cold kind of crime. . . . It was cold, deliberate, 
premeditated." 
</P>
<P>
Court records show that Gal's firm had been hired by Pomona orthopedic surgeon 
Thomas A. Gionis, Aissa Wayne's ex-husband, last year while the couple were 
going through an acrimonious divorce and custody fight over their now 
2-year-old daughter, Anastasia. 
</P>
<P>
Evans and Newport Beach police declined comment on whether Gionis was being 
investigated in connection with the attack, and the doctor did not return 
telephone calls to his office Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis' attorney, Mitchell B. Ludwig, who represented him in the custody 
proceedings, would not comment on Gionis' connection with Gal or Hintergardt. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know anything about this guy," Ludwig said of Hintergardt, adding, "I 
don't represent that (detective) firm. . . . We're civil lawyers, not criminal 
lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
Court records show that Hintergardt previously worked for Gal. But he told 
detectives that he was an unemployed electrician, Newport Beach Police Lt. Tim 
Newman said. Hintergardt is scheduled to be arraigned Friday, according to a 
clerk at Harbor Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne, 32, and Luby, 52, have told authorities that two men jumped out at them 
in Luby's garage as the couple were returning from an aerobics class about noon 
on Oct. 3. They said the men bound them hand and foot, pistol-whipped them and 
told them, "You're (messing) with the wrong people. If you screw up again, 
you're dead." 
</P>
<P>
Wayne, reached Monday at her home in Corona del Mar, said she is relieved that 
there is progress on the case but said she is troubled by why it might have 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
She would not say if she has been in touch with her ex-husband to talk about 
their daughter or to ask about his connection with Gal. 
</P>
<P>
"Could you ask me that in a couple of days," she said. "We don't know all the 
facts. And secondly, it would just be very hard . . . it was just a shocking 
thing to think that the father of your child would order something like this, 
an assault, if he did do it." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, a judge in Orange County Superior Court awarded custody of the 
couple's daughter to Gionis, after calling Wayne "immature emotionally." 
</P>
<P>
Wayne said that her daughter's custody order is not final yet and that her 
attorney has requested an explanation from the judge on his finding. 
</P>
<P>
Pilar Wayne, the late actor's widow, said the last few months have been 
difficult for her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"As the mother of the victim, naturally I'm happy and relieved that the Newport 
Beach police have one of the assailants (suspected of doing) this horrible 
thing to my daughter." 
</P>
<P>
"Our family has suffered a lot of mental anguish," she said. "Aissa has shown 
she certainly has a little bit of true grit in her." 
</P>
<P>
Luby, who said he and Aissa are now just "good friends," said he also was 
relieved to learn of Hintergardt's arrest so many weeks after the assault took 
place. 
</P>
<P>
But he declined to say who he thinks is responsible for the contract to attack 
Wayne and himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I have my own clear-cut views, but I wouldn't dare say anything," he said from 
a health spa in San Diego, where he has been for the last 2 weeks. "It's 
slanderous." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, police said they investigated Luby's business ties, looking into a 
lawsuit he filed against a group of lenders who, he said, had reneged on their 
obligations and sent him into bankruptcy. That case, Luby said, will go to 
trial next month. 
</P>
<P>
Luby discounted any connection between the attack and his own financial or 
legal problems. "I never, never dreamed that it was from any of my side of the 
fence at all. Period." 
</P>
<P>
Luby said he is over the fear he felt just after the attack, but he still 
worries about what motivated his assailants. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a contract hit on us," he said. "Somebody, whoever that somebody is, 
paid for a contract to go out and do something to Aissa and me."

2 WALK AWAY FROM STREET CRASH-LANDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A student pilot and his instructor walked away unhurt Monday after their 
single-engine airplane lost power at 400 feet and crashed-landed on a street 
minutes after takeoff from Fullerton Municipal Airport. No one on the ground 
was injured. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot, John Otey, 30, of Anaheim, was flying the Piper Warrior II for an 
instrument rating license, police said. He had 200 hours of flying time. Both 
the plane and the instructor, Mike Simmon, 21, of Norwalk, are with Aviation 
Facilities Inc. of Fullerton, Buena Park Police Officer Rich McMillen said. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton Airport Director Rod Murphy said he watched the aircraft from his 
office as it took off at 2:30 p.m., then suddenly crash-landed. 
</P>
<P>
"The airplane was operating normally on its departure and had an engine 
failure," Murphy said. "The pilot maneuvered to miss houses and buildings and 
aimed for the clear area." 
</P>
<P>
The plane glided over a vacant field about a quarter of a mile west of the 
runway as it dropped, according to witnesses at the scene. The plane's 
propeller sliced a power line as the gray Piper smashed into the ground, 
missing a home by about 50 feet and plowing through a white picket fence. 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft then spun sideways across Artesia Boulevard, coming to rest before 
the Buena Park Business Center, half a block west of Dale Street. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the wire come down first thing," said Choong Nam, whose office is 
situated just a sidewalk's width from the wrecked airplane. "Suddenly I saw the 
back of the crashed airplane. Then two men came out. I can't explain to you how 
scary it was." 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the Piper's engine failure was unknown, and the crash is under 
investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration and the National 
Transportation Safety Board, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Otey, the pilot, and his instructor were being questioned Monday afternoon by 
the FAA and declined to speak with reporters, said a woman who answered the 
telephone at Aviation Facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Otey received praise from several quarters Monday for his maneuvering of the 
stricken airplane away from houses and buildings and onto the street. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say the pilot did one hell of a job," said one crash witness, who declined 
to give his name. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear the pilot did good work bringing the plane down," said City Councilman 
Don Bankhead, a retired Fullerton police captain elected to the council last 
November, who has opposed any airport expansion or jet landings for noise and 
safety reasons. "It's very fortunate that they walked away from it." 
</P>
<P>
Damage to the Piper Warrior appeared moderate. The nose cowling was crumpled 
and the severed power line was wrapped around the propeller. The landing gear 
also had crumpled, apparently on impact. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Crashes 
</P>
<P>
The Fullerton Airport has been the site of several crashes in its 63-year 
history, the most recent on Sept. 20, when a Piper Cherokee 6 crashed into an 
industrial park on approach to the airfield. 
</P>
<P>
A passenger in that plane was seriously injured, suffering a broken pelvis. The 
pilot, a part-time flight instructor, suffered moderate injuries. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 17, 1987, the pilot of a Piper Cherokee Arrow lost control of his plane 
and struck a Buena Park apartment complex. No one else was injured but the 
pilot was killed. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1986, popular radio traffic announcer Bruce Wayne died when his Cessna 
Cardinal went down shortly after takeoff from the airport. Five months later, a 
plane crashed in the yard of an elementary school on Fern Drive, just 30 
minutes after classes ended. There were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
These and other crashes have sparked residents' opposition to the airport's 
operations in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have pointed out over the years that the airport was built long 
before the the neighborhood became a residential area and that those who moved 
there did so knowingly and at their own risk. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the facility's past, airport director Murphy said Monday that no 
one has ever been killed on the ground by a crashing airplane. And for an 
airport with 170,000 takeoffs and landings a year, he said, its safety record 
is sound. 
</P>
<P>
Controversy over the airport has diminished following the defeat of a 1986 
referendum that would have banned jets from landing at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been lucky we haven't had more serious injuries and fatalities," said 
Carl Stevenson, one of the organizers behind the failed referendum. "Obviously 
people are worried, concerned about planes flying over houses and businesses. 
The airport is tucked away in a densely populated area." 
</P>
<P>
But Stevenson added that he does not oppose the airport's continued operation. 
</P>
<P>
"I know everybody who flies out of the airport is concerned about maintenance," 
he said. "I don't mean to imply that anyone is slipshod here. But things break, 
no matter how good everyone's efforts are." 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Fortney said she is just happy that the Piper Warrior missed her house, 
never mind the picket fence knocked down in her front yard. 
</P>
<P>
Fortney said she was on her way home from work when she saw a helicopter 
hovering over her house, leading her to worry that something was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Standing in front of her home, Fortney said a few other planes have landed in 
the field behind her since she moved in 8 years ago. "But this is actually the 
closest one that's ever come down." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the airport doesn't really bother her, Fortney said. Looking across 
the street at the ungainly Piper, resting awkwardly on its broken legs, she 
said of the two men who escaped injury, "I'm just glad they're all OK."

MAN CLAIMS HE HAD SEX WITH HUDSON'S EX-LOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Attorneys for Rock Hudson's estate, seeking to overturn the recent 
$21.75-million jury award to the actor's ex-lover Marc Christian, have made 
public a sworn statement from a Laguna Niguel man who claims that Christian had 
sex with him 6 weeks after Hudson's death in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The allegation by Gunther Albert Fraulob, a personal physical trainer, estate 
attorneys contend, calls into question Christian's credibility and also raises 
the question of whether Christian has engaged in deceitful conduct. 
</P>
<P>
In the court document filed Monday, Fraulob states that he first met Christian 
at a memorial service for Hudson, who died Oct. 2, 1985, of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome. Before the two had sex, he said, Christian assured him 
that "he was safe, he was fine and he was healthy." 
</P>
<P>
Christian, who has shown no medical signs of AIDS, won the massive award for 
allegedly having suffered emotional trauma because Hudson and his private 
secretary concealed the fact that the popular actor was suffering from the 
fatal disease. 
</P>
<P>
During the novel trial that concluded in mid-February, Christian testified that 
he has remained celibate since Hudson's death because of his continuing fear 
that he may have contracted the AIDS-related virus from Hudson. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Direct Contradiction 
</P>
<P>
Fraulob's statement, which was immediately labeled as false by Christian's 
attorney, was filed as part of a lengthy defense motion requesting that Los 
Angeles Superior Court Judge Bruce R. Geernaert grant a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
In the motion, the estate's lawyers argue that Fraulob's newly discovered 
allegations are highly material because they constitute the first evidence 
"directly contradicting (Christian's) testimony on the critical issue of fear." 
</P>
<P>
The motion, on which a hearing has been set for April 7, also cites allegations 
of juror misconduct and of technical errors by Geernaert during the 5-week 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview Monday afternoon, Fraulob said he came forward because 
"Marc Christian is lying, and he's doing it for one obvious reason -- to make 
money." 
</P>
<P>
Fraulob, 32, said he did not disclose his alleged relationship with Christian 
during the trial because "I didn't want to drag my name through the mud . . . 
(and) I didn't think my involvement would help the case in any way." 
</P>
<P>
Fraulob described himself as a platonic friend of Hudson for 1 1/2 years before 
the star's death. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe (Christian) has AIDS because he told me that," Fraulob said in 
the interview. "But I'm sure that if everything was proven different, then I 
was exposed to it . . . and then I'd have fear of it." 
</P>
<P>
In that case, Fraulob said, "I'm sure I'd take him to court to sue him for 
exposing me to the virus." 
</P>
<P>
And at that point, Fraulob added, he could in turn conceivably be held legally 
responsible by his own sexual partners. 
</P>
<P>
Christian could not be reached for comment Monday. But his attorney, Harold 
Rhoden, said that Christian "categorically denies that there is any truth in 
this, other than the fact that Fraulob did talk to Marc Christian at the time 
of the wake, or the following day." 
</P>
<P>
"From what I've been told and believe," Rhoden added, "Marc Christian never 
even shook the guy's hand. . . . He didn't meet with him on or about Nov. 15, 
1985, or at any other time or any other place for any activity." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Robert Parker Mills, an attorney for the Hudson estate, said he was 
"satisfied with the truthfulness" of Fraulob's allegations and challenged 
Christian "to take a lie detector test. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Fraulob said he met Hudson in early 1984 while working as a waiter in a Long 
Beach hotel restaurant and that Hudson, with whom he never had sex, later 
accompanied him to Hawaii. Hudson, Fraulob said, once told him that he had 
tried to kick Christian out of his house but that Christian would not leave and 
planned to expose him as being gay.

JOHNSON DENIES HE HAD 'WHITE HOUSE LETTER' MAILING ROLE 
</P>

<P>
Assembly Republican leader Ross Johnson of La Habra denied Monday that he had 
any role in approving a campaign hit piece that led to a forgery charge against 
a GOP lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to state unequivocally I attended no meetings concerning the mailing or 
writing of any so-called 'White House letters,' " Johnson said in a statement. 
"I had no discussions about any such letters, and as far as my personal 
knowledge goes, no such meetings or discussions ever took place." 
</P>
<P>
According to a grand jury transcript released Friday, Johnson participated in a 
1986 meeting at which Assembly Republican leaders decided to send out, without 
White House approval, campaign letters containing Ronald Reagan's purported 
signature. 
</P>
<P>
The letters included a hit piece that accused Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd 
(D-Carson) of giving in to "the powerful underworld drug industry." 
</P>
<P>
An angry Floyd wrote Reagan, saying he could not believe that the 
then-President "would sign such an outrageous, below-the-belt piece of trash." 
</P>
<P>
After a subsequent investigation, Republican Assemblyman John R. Lewis of 
Orange, a key GOP campaign strategist, was indicted on one count of forging 
Reagan's signature. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony to the Sacramento County Grand Jury last Feb. 1, Tim Macy, 
president of a campaign mailing firm, said he had a telephone conversation with 
Lewis just before the letters were mailed. 
</P>
<P>
Macy said he called Lewis at Johnson's office in Fullerton in October, 1986, 
and asked Lewis "if they were sure they wanted to mail these letters not having 
(White House) authorization." 
</P>
<P>
Macy said Lewis told him that he needed to ask a group of legislators who were 
meeting in Johnson's office what they wanted to do about the letters. Lewis 
returned to the phone a few minutes later and said "they wanted the letters 
mailed," Macy added. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Lewis told him that Johnson participated in the meeting, Macy testified. 
</P>
<P>
Macy also said that Assemblymen Pat Nolan (R-Glendale), who was Assembly 
Republican leader at the time, and Dennis Brown (R-Los Alamitos) also 
participated in the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Johnson also said he had "cooperated fully with the state 
attorney general's office" in the investigation and "was willing to testify 
before the grand jury, but I was not called." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Johnson had told the Orange County Register that he initially refused 
to cooperate with investigators because he considered the inquiry a Democratic 
witch hunt. 
</P>
<P>
He told the Register on Monday that he was subpoenaed to testify last February 
but that the subpoena was withdrawn after he met with Justice Department 
attorneys.

JURY MAY NEVER HEAR IT; 
</P>
<P>
KRAFT LAWYER BLAMES BONIN FOR ONE KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An attorney for Randy Steven Kraft filed new court documents Monday claiming 
that convicted "Freeway Killer" William G. Bonin was responsible for the Jan. 
1, 1976, murder of Mark Howard Hall, one of 16 Orange County killings that 
Kraft is being tried for. 
</P>
<P>
But it isn't likely that Kraft's jury will ever hear about it. Superior Court 
Judge Donald A. McCartin told Kraft's lawyers last Friday that he did not think 
the admissibility of the evidence "is even a close issue" and ruled against it. 
</P>
<P>
However, at the request of the district attorney's office, the judge said he 
would wait until this week to make his decision final so that lawyers for both 
sides could file additional documents. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, now 44, is on trial in Santa Ana in one of the biggest criminal trials 
in the state's history. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, a 20-year-old Santa Ana man, was last seen at a New Year's Eve party in 
San Juan Capistrano at the end of 1975. His body was found on Jan. 3, 1976, in 
Silverado Canyon, near Bedford Peak. He had been emasculated, and his windpipe 
was packed with dirt. Prosecutors have introduced evidence that Kraft's 
fingerprints were found on a vodka bottle next to the victim's head. 
</P>
<P>
But Kraft attorney James G. Merwin claims that Bonin associate Vernon Butts, 
who committed suicide at the Los Angeles County Jail 9 years ago, was 
responsible for Hall's death, which he called a "ritualistic" killing. Merwin 
claims that Butts killed Hall for Bonin, who already was in prison at the time 
on a conviction for child molestation. Merwin said Bonin and Butts had made a 
pact to continue killings if one of them was in jail to throw off the police. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is more evidence pointing in this direction than there is 
pointing at Randy, if we're going to apply the same standards," Merwin said. 
</P>
<P>
But Kraft prosecutor Bryan F. Brown, who also prosecuted Bonin, told the court 
Monday that it was not possible that Butts was involved. Brown said his office 
can offer proof that Butts and Bonin did not even know each other at the time 
of Hall's death. 
</P>
<P>
Bonin was convicted in the early 1980s of murders of 10 boys in Los Angeles 
County and four more in Orange County and is now on Death Row. His two death 
sentences have been upheld by the state Supreme Court. On Monday the U.S. 
Supreme Court refused to hear Bonin's appeal in the Orange County case. 
</P>
<P>
The first Bonin killing, Brown said, came in 1979, nearly a year after his 
release from prison. It was then, not in 1975, that Butts and Bonin made their 
pact, Brown told the court. Three other co-defendants were arrested in the 
Freeway Killings besides Bonin and Butts. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time of Mark Hall's death, Bonin doesn't know any of these guys," Brown 
told the court. 
</P>
<P>
But Kraft's attorneys say that a ritualistic sign was carved into Hall's skin, 
which makes his murder significantly different from the other 15 deaths in the 
Kraft case. Also, his body was not found dumped near a roadway or freeway ramp, 
as most of the others were. 
</P>
<P>
"I really believe that Hall's death was at the hands of a satanist," Merwin 
said. "I think the jurors should hear about this." 
</P>
<P>
Merwin also said he could show that both Butts and Bonin were familiar with 
Silverado Canyon, and that Bonin once rented a house on Silverado Canyon Road, 
about 4 miles from the Hall crime scene, and that he and a brother once 
operated a bar in the area, 6 miles from where Hall was found dead. 
</P>
<P>
Merwin was not in court Monday and said later that he would have to read a 
transcript of what Brown told the court before commenting. Merwin said he did 
not know of any evidence that Butts and Bonin did not know each other at the 
time Hall's body was found.

GANG TIES TO KILLING INVESTIGATED; 
</P>
<P>
POLICE PROBE TEEN-AGER'S SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Santa Ana police officers are investigating the possibility that the shooting 
death of a 14-year-old Westminster youth was gang-related, a police spokesman 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
However, the family of Duy Duc Vu, a Westminster High School student who was 
slain in front of a home on a quiet cul-de-sac in Santa Ana shortly before 
midnight Friday, said they believe that the boy was an innocent victim who had 
not been involved with gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
After being on life-support systems for several hours, Vu died of the single 
gunshot wound to his head late Saturday afternoon at Fountain Valley Regional 
Hospital and Medical Center, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said that there are no suspects but 
that "investigators are looking into the shooting as being possibly 
gang-related." 
</P>
<P>
She said three unidentified Vietnamese men are being sought in connection with 
the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Vu, the victim's older sister, said the high school freshman "was not a 
member of a gang. He was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. He was 
there because he needed a ride home." 
</P>
<P>
Duy Duc Vu had attended a birthday party and was on his way home late Friday 
when the group of friends he was with stopped at a house on the 600 block of 
South Corta Drive in Santa Ana. The reason for the stop was not known, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
At about 11:55 p.m., Vu and his friends, who were assembled on the driveway of 
the home, saw a caravan of about five cars pull up and stop in front of the 
house. According to reports by Santa Ana police officials and family members, 
three males emerged from the cars and fired several rounds, using three 
handguns of unknown caliber. The crowd scattered, but not before one of the 
bullets struck Vu in the head as he was trying to hide behind a white 
Volkswagen parked nearby. No one else was injured, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The family gathered at the Vu house in Westminster Monday. Helen Vu said her 
brother "was the youngest of our family. His death has created a void in our 
home. Being the baby, he was loved by everyone. The first thing that he did 
each night was his homework. He loved to repair broken electronic things; he 
just wasn't the type (to join a gang). He even maintained a friendship with a 
local policeman. He considered the man a mentor." 
</P>
<P>
She said that the teen, who was known as "Dukey" to family members, was an 
above-average student who loved music and enjoyed lifting weights and playing 
volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever we do now won't bring him back," she added. "We hope that this won't 
happen to others. We don't feel a need for revenge. Bloodshed won't replace our 
loss."

WOMEN KILLED, 5 OTHERS HURT IN DESERT CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 23-year-old Santa Ana woman was killed and four other Santa Ana residents 
seriously injured when a pickup truck overturned in the first major incident of 
the Easter Week break in Palm Springs, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Munoz Flores was dead at the scene after a truck in which she was riding 
struck a concrete wall at 6:34 p.m. Sunday while traveling at high speed, Palm 
Springs Police Lt. John Clem said. 
</P>
<P>
The truck flipped end over end four times before coming to rest under a stop 
sign in a residential area about 4 miles from downtown Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police the pickup truck failed to stop at two stop signs and had 
passed another car when it appeared to "over-correct after passing," went over 
the curb and struck the wall, Clem said. No arrests or citations were issued, 
but the incident remains under investigation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"In the debris of the crash there is an indication some alcohol was present, 
but we do not know if that was a factor," Clem said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, Eric Leonard Jones, 23, of Palm Desert, and four Santa Ana 
residents -- Linda Vargas, 24; Carlos Cano, 23; Ruben Melendrez, 24, and Molly 
Carrillo, 21 -- were listed in serious to critical condition in Desert Hospital 
in Palm Springs, Clem said. 
</P>
<P>
The annual spring break draws thousands of college-age adults to Palm Springs.

MAJOR LEAGUE VOLLEYBALL TEAMS SUSPEND OPERATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE LOWERY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Owners of the six teams of Major League Volleyball voted to suspend operation 
of the women's professional league, a month into its third season, it was 
announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Batinovich, league chairman, said Monday that the league will suspend 
operations after Saturday's all-star game in San Jose. The remaining six weeks 
of the regular season were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
Lindy Vivas, league commissioner, said there are plans for the league to return 
in 1990, although she is not entirely sure that will happen. 
</P>
<P>
"We definitely have to take a look at how things have gone and where they can 
go," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Vivas attributed the league's trouble to "immediate cash flow problems." George 
Corey, Los Angeles Starlites co-owner, estimated league losses Monday between 
$2.9 million and $3.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Those losses were in large part because of the failure of teams in the three 
major media markets, New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Each of those teams 
averaged about 500 spectators a game, league officials said. Teams in smaller 
markets, San Jose (1,900), Minnesota (2,000) and Portland, Ore. (1,500), have 
been the league's best draws. 
</P>
<P>
"For a combination of reasons, whether it be the lack of local ownership, the 
marketplace, or the way the teams were promoted, the franchises in New York, 
Chicago and Los Angeles failed financially," San Jose owner Gary Schwing said. 
"The owners of the three successful franchises were unable to bail out the 
other three (teams), and the league was forced to suspend operations." 
</P>
<P>
Corey said: "It would have taken a half a million (dollars) to finish the year. 
It just wasn't there. We wanted to make sure we could pay everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Los Angeles Starlites, who played their home games at UC 
Irvine's Bren Center and were 5-5 this season, were informed Sunday of the 
suspension at Los Angeles International Airport, as they returned from a 
two-game trip. 
</P>
<P>
"We got off the plane and George (Corey) and (general manager) Fran (Cummings) 
met us and let us know what had happened," said Al Gasparian, Starlites coach. 
"It was bizarre, they took us into this little lounge to tell us. Everybody was 
really disappointed. But you kind of had to wonder. When people are sinking a 
lot of money into this and no one is in the stands, you have to wonder."

U.S. JUDGE REFUSES TO DROP CASE AGAINST CARL KARCHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN GALANTE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge on Monday refused to dismiss civil charges of insider trading 
against fast food magnate Carl N. Karcher and two members of his family. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie determined that the lawsuit 
against the founder of Anaheim-based Carl Karcher Enterprises should begin 
trial as scheduled on May 2. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether circumstantial evidence is sufficient to warrant (a verdict against 
the Karchers) is a matter that should be presented to the jury," the judge 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling came one week after the judge dismissed the government's civil case 
against Margaret Karcher, the wife of Carl N. Karcher. The U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission had asked Rafeedie to drop the charges against her. 
</P>
<P>
Carl N. and Margaret Karcher are among 16 people accused of insider trading 
violations in a civil lawsuit filed by the SEC in federal court last April. 
</P>
<P>
The suit accused Karcher family members and company accounting director Alvin 
A. DeShano of avoiding losses of at least $310,000 in 1984 by selling Karcher 
securities before public disclosure of a 50% earnings decline. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most of the defendants, however, Carl N. Karcher and his wife were not 
accused of selling any of their own stock. Instead, the SEC alleged that they 
helped relatives avoid losses by tipping them through a series of phone calls 
and discussions to the pending earnings announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Illegal insider trading is the buying or selling of securities, either directly 
or through intermediaries, based on information not available to the public. 
Federal law also bars insiders -- such as corporate officers -- from passing 
along tips to others who use the information to profit or to avoid losses. 
</P>
<P>
The judge's decision to drop charges against Margaret Karcher came after 
attorney Wesley Howell Jr. asked the judge to determine that there was 
insufficient evidence to continue the case against her and Carl N. Karcher. He 
told the court last week that there was no evidence that Margaret Karcher had 
done anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"The arguments against Margaret were borderline frivolous," Howell said Monday. 
He said he may seek financial damages from the SEC after the trial. 
</P>
<P>
But according to SEC trial counsel Karen Matteson, the government does not 
agree that it had no evidence against Margaret Karcher. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'The One Who Had Access' 
</P>
<P>
Matteson said the SEC asked the court to dismiss the case against Margaret 
Karcher because the "ultimate source" of the inside information was Carl N. 
Karcher. "He's the one who had access to the information, and any tipping by 
(his wife) would be redundant," Matteson said. 
</P>
<P>
Howell told the court that Carl N. Karcher, 72, had only given his children 
fatherly advice. He said that Karcher told his children he thought that they 
had borrowed too heavily against Karcher stock held in margin accounts and that 
they should do what their brokers advised. Brokerages often allow customers to 
use stock held in margin accounts as collateral for loans. 
</P>
<P>
Howell said the Karcher relatives "had eight zillion reasons" to sell their 
stock. "The market had fallen dramatically, they had huge margin debts that 
were increasing, and their brokers were pressing them to sell," he said in an 
interview. "These weren't sales out of the blue. These people had very, very 
rational reasons to be selling." 
</P>
<P>
Howell said there was "no doubt (Karcher) knew these kids were selling and no 
doubt he would try and help them if he thought it was legal and proper. But 
that isn't the issue. . . . What he didn't do was give them any material, 
non-public information." 
</P>
<P>
Matteson, however, said Karcher "was heavily involved in the investment 
activities of his children." He said the children often sought Karcher's 
financial and investment help. In some cases, Matteson said, Karcher loaned 
stock or money to his children to help them out of margin calls. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very clear," Matteson said outside of court, "that Carl was heavily 
involved in their financial affairs and that all of these children had serious 
financial needs. And none of them had much income coming in. There's 
overwhelming circumstantial evidence that Carl Karcher conveyed material, 
non-public information to his children before they sold." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Entitled to Vindication' 
</P>
<P>
After Monday's court session, Howell said the defendants could agree to settle 
the SEC's lawsuit for something other than a complete dismissal of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
"Carl feels he's entitled to a vindication," Howell said. "But I'm not sure 
whether he's willing to spend the money to go to trial and run the risk a jury 
could decide against him." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the Karchers had also asked Rafeedie to dismiss the civil case 
against one of Carl N. Karcher's daughters, Catherine Karcher Everly, and her 
husband, Daniel Everly. That request was denied Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Seven Karcher family members are now scheduled to be tried on the civil 
violations. In addition to Carl N. Karcher and the Everlys, they are daughter 
Margaret J. LeVecke; daughter Barbara Karcher Wall (formerly Barbara Karcher 
Garrett); son Jerome Karcher, and son-in-law Donald E. Fergus Jr. 
</P>
<P>
DeShano, the company accountant, has been criminally charged in connection with 
the case and is set to begin trial on April 25. Six Karcher family members 
agreed in February to pay a total of $187,560 in civil fines and penalties to 
settle the civil case against them. Another son, Carl Leo Karcher, agreed last 
year to pay back $10,500 in losses he avoided.

STOP-SMOKING PRODUCT; 
</P>
<P>
CIGARREST MARKETERS GIVE GLOWING SALES REPORTS BUT FDA IS WARY OF SUCCESS 
CLAIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Hypnotism didn't do the trick. Neither did nicotine-laced chewing gum. Even two 
open-heart surgeries didn't make Jackie Quast, 54, give up her two-pack-a-day 
cigarette habit. 
</P>
<P>
Then, last Christmas, Quast's daughter sent her a product called CigArrest, 
described as "a unique 7-day program to stop smoking." The box contained a 
motivational cassette tape, a 32-page booklet, vitamins and 15 tablets 
containing a drug called lobeline sulfate. 
</P>
<P>
Quast, a dietary manager at a nursing home in Vancouver, Wash., tried one more 
time -- and failed. But she said CigArrest came closer to helping her abandon 
cigarettes than any of the other methods she has tried. She's planning to give 
the product a second chance soon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Targeting Chronic Smokers 
</P>
<P>
Quast is just the kind of chronic smoker being targeted by Advantage 
Entertainment Inc., a Costa Mesa firm that has the rights to market CigArrest 
at retail locations throughout the country. And Advantage believes that it has 
the right product at the right time to capitalize on increasing concern about 
the risks of smoking and mounting pressure to ban smoking at work sites and 
public places. 
</P>
<P>
But CigArrest's days as a stop-smoking product may be numbered. The U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration is not convinced that lobeline sulfate actually helps 
people break their smoking habit, and the agency eventually could ban the 
marketing of CigArrest and similar products for that purpose. 
</P>
<P>
But CigArrest's sponsors are betting that its market will continue to expand. 
They estimate that within the next 5 years, 80% of the nation's 50 million 
smokers will try to break the habit. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, CigArrest has been sold through television and direct mail pitches 
by More Direct Response, a Carlsbad company that makes the product. CigArrest's 
low-budget television ads have been seen primarily by viewers of late-night 
wrestling, roller derbies and reruns of syndicated programs. 
</P>
<P>
The response was sufficient to cause sales of CigArrest to double each year, 
said John Bancroft, president and owner of More Direct Response. Last year, 
Bancroft said, the private firm's CigArrest sales totaled $27 million. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Bancroft licensed Advantage Entertainment to handle 
over-the-counter sales of CigArrest. The Costa Mesa firm also sells exercise 
videos and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Advantage Entertainment reported sales of $3.8 million for the first 
9 months of its 1989 fiscal year, up from $811,577 during the same period a 
year earlier. The firm posted earnings of $361,166 for the period, which ended 
Jan. 31, compared to a loss of $244,087 the previous year. The company credited 
the gains primarily to sales of CigArrest. 
</P>
<P>
Advantage Entertainment is displaying CigArrest at sales counters of such major 
retail chains as 7-Eleven, Sav-On Osco Drug Stores, Kroger and Albertson's 
supermarkets, K mart, Longs Drug Stores and Eckerd Drug Stores. The CigArrest 
stop-smoking system contained in a small box retails for $19.95. 
</P>
<P>
Charles G. Sleichter III, president of Advantage Entertainment, said 
over-the-counter sales of CigArrest exceeded $5 million during the first 12 
months of the store sales program. 
</P>
<P>
K mart started displaying CigArrest in 100 of its stores in December "to catch 
New Year's resolutions," said Frank Marciniak, a K mart buyer in Troy, Mich. 
Initial sales were so strong, he added, that distribution of the product was 
expanded to 1,000 of the chain's 2,100 stores. 
</P>
<P>
Also pleased by initial customer reaction is Southland Corp., which sells 
CigArrest in most of its 7,000 7-Eleven stores in the United States and Canada, 
according to Southland spokesman Don Cowan. 
</P>
<P>
Sleichter said that $12 million will be spent this year to market the product. 
That includes $10 million by More Direct Response for television spots and $2 
million by Advantage Entertainment for advertisements on radio and in national 
publications such as TV Guide, USA Today, Readers Digest and Cosmopolitan. 
</P>
<P>
In January, Advantage Entertainment raised $620,000 by selling stock to the 
public. The funds were used to help launch the print and radio advertising 
campaign. CigArrest's stock, which is traded on the Vancouver Stock Exchange, 
is not listed in daily over-the-counter trading reports. The stock recently 
traded for about $1.25 a share. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Product's Future Uncertain 
</P>
<P>
Despite CigArrest's sales surge, the product faces an uncertain future as an 
advertised smoking deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
The active ingredient in CigArrest, lobeline sulfate, has been marketed since 
the 1950s as a stop-smoking aid under the brand name Bantron. Dep Corp., a Los 
Angeles County firm that manufactures Bantron, does not advertise the product. 
</P>
<P>
In its marketing literature, Advantage Entertainment says lobeline sulfate is 
derived from the native American plant known as Indian tobacco and is "a 
powerful, non-prescription, non-addictive aid to help break the cigarette 
habit." The company says the substance is "reported to be one of the most 
successful non-prescription drugs in treating nicotine addiction." 
</P>
<P>
But the FDA contends that the results of a number of clinical tests of the drug 
so far have failed to demonstrate to the agency's satisfaction that lobeline 
sulfate is useful in helping people stop smoking. 
</P>
<P>
FDA spokesman Bill Grigg said the agency expects to publish a list of drugs 
that it considers safe and effective as smoking-cessation products within a 
year. If the FDA does not receive more convincing data about the effectiveness 
of loeline sulfate, he said, the manufacturers of CigArrest, Bantron and any 
other stop-smoking products containing lobeline sulfate will have a year after 
publication of the list to remove unauthorized products from the market. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Grigg said, the only product that the FDA has found to be effective in 
helping people break the cigarette habit is Nicorette, a nicotine chewing gum 
that must be prescribed by a physician. Manufactured by a unit of Dow Chemical 
Co., Nicorette is by far the leading smoking cessation product, generating $81 
million in sales in 1988, up 37% from 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the FDA's reservations, Sleichter said he has confidence in the 
effectiveness of the CigArrest "system." He said the cassette tape and pamphlet 
are designed to help break a smoker's psychological addiction, while lobeline 
sulfate helps relieve the physical craving for nicotine. 
</P>
<P>
Bancroft, the CigArrest manufacturer, said a controlled clinical study of the 
system's effectiveness is under way. He said he doesn't expect any meaningful 
results from the study until sometime next fall. But he said he has received 
thousands of testimonial letters from satisfied customers. 
</P>
<P>
Lobeline sulfate "is probably not going to hurt people, but it is not a proven 
therapeutic aid," said Jack Henningfield, a nicotine expert and researcher for 
the National Institute on Drug Abuse in Baltimore. "I think it is roughly in 
the category of carrots and knitting" as stop-smoking aids, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Terry Pechacek, acting chief of the Smoking Tobacco and Cancer branch of 
the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, said lobeline sulfate probably has a 
"placebo effect," meaning that people who take it may succeed more often in 
breaking the cigarette habit than those who don't simply because they believe 
the drug works. 
</P>
<P>
"If it helps someone to quit, it is worthwhile," Pechacek said. 
</P>
<P>
But Dr. David P. L. Sachs, director of the Smoking Cessation Research Institute 
in Palo Alto, said it would be preferable for smokers who want to quit to try a 
system with a better track record. "You don't like putting someone through a 
cessation treatment you know has a low probability of being effective," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently undaunted, Advantage Entertainment is forging ahead. It has come out 
with a new packaging design for its line of CigArrest products. And it will 
soon introduce a chewing gum containing lobeline sulfate to compete more 
directly with Nicorette. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the CigArrest system, the gum will not be marketed as a stop-smoking 
product, Sleichter said. Rather, he said, the gum will be marketed as a smoking 
alternative for people who want to cut back, who are temporarily in a 
no-smoking situation or who have quit smoking but feel tempted to start again. 
</P>
<P>
He said that even if the FDA ultimately prohibits the advertising of CigArrest 
as a smoking cessation product, the gum could continue to be sold as a 
cigarette substitute. He said test marketing of the gum is scheduled to begin 
next month.

FORMER HAAS SECURITIES CHIEF INDICTED IN TS INDUSTRIES STOCK FRAUD CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER and JOHN CHARLES TIGHE, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The former chairman of the defunct Haas Securities Corp. was indicted in New 
York Monday on stock fraud and other charges involving the securities of a 
former Orange County company and two other firms. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene K. Laff, 51, was indicted on 15 counts of fraud, conspiracy and other 
charges stemming from an alleged scheme to manipulate the prices of 
over-the-counter stocks between January, 1986, and May, 1988. The counts also 
include a charge of obstructing an investigation of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Among the companies whose securities were involved in the alleged manipulation 
was TS Industries Inc., an insulation manufacturer headquartered in Huntington 
Beach before relocating to Salt Lake City last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Former Haas President Stanley Aslanian Jr. has already pleaded guilty to 
conspiracy in the case, which came to light as Haas was liquidated in the 
aftermath of the stock market crash of October, 1987. The market collapse 
yielded evidence of stock manipulation at a number of other securities firms 
that federal prosecutors are also investigating. 
</P>
<P>
Acting U.S. Atty. Benito Romano said Laff and co-conspirators used a number of 
means to raise and maintain the prices of the shares of the small companies, 
commonly called "penny stocks." 
</P>
<P>
To create the appearance of demand for the shares, they sold stock into 
accounts in the name of Henry Lorin, a stock promoter associated with the firm, 
according to prosecutors. They allegedly kept share prices from declining by 
buying up most of what came onto the market. 
</P>
<P>
These means enabled them to raise and maintain prices, even when orders to sell 
the stock exceeded those to buy it. The companies involved were TS Industries, 
Flores de New Mexico Inc. and Big O Tires Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Laff, of Greenwich, Conn., also published inaccurate information on Big O Tires 
in an effort to keep its stock prices up, the indictment said. On occasion, 
Haas also discouraged or refused to accept sell orders from customers for some 
of the stock. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of the manipulated stocks collapsed when Haas went under. 
</P>
<P>
TS Industries stock plunged from $34.50 per share before the 1987 market crash 
to $2 a share in the following quarter. The stock currently trades at about 53 
cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
TS Industries Chairman Harry Woodcock once owned 2 million shares of the 
company's stock. He said the price collapse caused a significant personal loss 
and damaged the reputation of the businesses that he and his wife founded in 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
"We were battered. We lost customers when they learned what was going on in New 
York, and they didn't want to be involved with us," Haas said by telephone 
Monday from his home in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
Woodcock said he hasn't followed the investigation closely in recent months. He 
said he couldn't comment on the indictment because he didn't know the specific 
charges brought against Laff. 
</P>
<P>
"We've tried to go on with things," said Woodcock, who has stepped down from 
his position as TS Industry's chief executive and is not involved in the 
company's day-to-day operations. Stung by its decline in business, the firm has 
consolidated and is selling off its foam insulation operation to reduce debt. 
</P>
<P>
Woodcock, 55, said he is chagrined by the stock-related events that began in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of years ago, things seemed wonderful," he said. "Now I don't have a 
job." 
</P>
<P>
As TS Industry's stock price rose, the firm was making investments that turned 
sour. For example, the company spent more than $2 million to build an 
insulation plant in Grenada as part of a U.S. government program that faltered. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know Wall Street, and I never cared to know it," Woodcock said. "In 
1985, we were a private company that made $1 million. (Haas) approached us 
about going public, and initially we said no." 
</P>
<P>
Woodcock, who testified before the grand jury, said he doesn't plan to file a 
lawsuit against Haas Securities. "We don't know that they did anything to us 
that was illegal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Securities Dealers, a self-regulatory organization that 
oversees activities of the over-the-counter stock market, has fined Laff 
$15,000, censured him and suspended him for 2 years from any supervisory 
position at another NASD member firm. 
</P>
<P>
John Lang, an attorney for Laff, said his client is "completely innocent" and 
confident he will be exonerated. The indictment is based in part on the 
testimony of witnesses, including Aslanian, who were given special deals by 
prosecutors in exchange for their cooperation, Lang said. 
</P>
<P>
Laff faces up to 5 years in jail and a maximum fine of $250,000 on each count, 
Romano said. Aslanian is awaiting sentencing.

PRINTRONIX INC. ADOPTS STOCK PURCHASE PLAN DESIGNED TO DETER TAKEOVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by David Olmos, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Worried that its low stock price could entice an unwanted takeover attempt, 
Printronix Inc. has approved a plan designed to frustrate unfriendly suitors 
who may try to gain control of the Irvine manufacturer of computer printers. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-takeover plan would make any hostile bid more difficult to succeed, 
said Robert A. Kleist, the company's president. 
</P>
<P>
Kleist said he is not aware of any activity indicating that the company is a 
target for a takeover, but recent takeover activity in the computer industry 
and "the low price of our stock" prompted the company's directors to adopt the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
Printronix stock, which has traded as high as $11 per share during the past 52 
weeks, recently has traded at about $7 per share. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-takeover plan would be triggered 10 days after someone acquires 20% or 
more of Printronix's stock or starts a tender offer that would result in the 
acquisition of 30% or more of the company. Under the plan, Printronix 
shareholders would receive the right to purchase a number of Printronix shares 
equal to the number they hold. The price for each "right" would be $35 a share. 
</P>
<P>
"The rights are designed to assure that all Printronix shareholders receive 
fair and equal treatment in the event of any proposed takeover of the company 
and to guard against partial tender offers and other abusive tactics to gain 
control of the company without paying all the stockholders the fair value of 
their shares, including a 'control premium,' " Printronix said.

CAR MECHANICS LEARN ANOTHER SKILL -- COMMUNICATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nobody loves to hate people like people love to hate auto mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
If your car is broken, you need it fixed right away. But you sometimes can't 
get it fixed right away and it costs too much when it is fixed -- if it was 
fixed right. 
</P>
<P>
And you can't really understand what that mechanic is saying anyway. Is all 
that gobbledygook just the cover for a rip-off? 
</P>
<P>
It's all a matter of communication, according to the head of an award-winning 
school for auto mechanics, who says communication skills are just as important 
in the curriculum as gaskets and spark plugs. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most difficult things is to be able to communicate in a two-way 
fashion," said Richard Diklich, coordinator of the automobile technology 
program at Longview Community College. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a basic element of distrust on both sides. I've found that customers 
often don't want to have their cars fixed because it is going to be an 
inconvenience and expensive. So they let it go, and the problem gets worse and 
it becomes more expensive." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Liberal Arts Classes 
</P>
<P>
The Longview auto tech student spends about two-thirds of the time working on 
mechanics and about one-third in liberal arts classes. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to work with the technical student on communication skills, consumer 
attitudes, work ethic and attitude as a part of what we do," Diklich said. 
</P>
<P>
Students study, for example, composition and reading or speech or American 
history along with courses on diagnosis and repair of automotive brake systems. 
</P>
<P>
Longview this year won the annual competition of the Motor Vehicle 
Manufacturer's Assn. and the American Vocational Assn. Industry Planning 
Council. The school had finished second in the prestigious competition last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Students enrolled at Longview have the option of following one program that is 
closely linked with General Motors, Ford or Toyota. They get half their 
training at the school and spend half their time working in the shop at a 
manufacturer's dealership. They later find jobs working for a dealership. 
</P>
<P>
Students can also get a more general training that qualifies them to work in 
other repair shops, such as service stations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Latest in Equipment 
</P>
<P>
On a tour of the school's new 22,000-square-foot building, instructor Bill 
Fairbanks shows off a huge garage with several ports for cars, the latest in 
diagnostic equipment, well-equipped classrooms and well-stocked parts rooms. 
</P>
<P>
"They won't find anything out there (in equipment) that we don't have here," 
said Fairbanks. 
</P>
<P>
The parking lot at Longview is filled with cars donated to the school for 
students to work on, including a late model Cadillac with the latest in 
on-board computer technology. 
</P>
<P>
"The technology of the car has increased," said Diklich. "The amount of 
material we have to teach has more than doubled since the 1970s. But they come 
from the high school and now have had experience with computers and with 
electronics. It is still basically using diagnostic procedures to find out what 
is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Demand for qualified mechanics is high, particularly in rural areas. General 
Motors estimates a shortage of 125,000 mechanics qualified to work on its cars. 
</P>
<P>
"Training has become more necessary," Diklich said. "The manufacturers 
recognize this, and they have begun looking to the colleges and universities 
for help. The manufacturers can train the current model technology. But they 
can't develop the background for the future."

ENTERTAINMENT FIRMS TURN IN BEST SHOWING FOR QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Fernando Valley-area companies posted mixed results in their most recently 
completed quarters, with entertainment companies showing the strongest profits 
and some large savings and loans posting declines in earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Among financial results for 37 of the largest public companies in the area, 21 
showed an increase in earnings, 12 posted lower earnings and four recorded 
losses. The companies are those with publicly traded shares and headquarters 
between Glendale and Camarillo. Nearly all of the fiscal quarters ended in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed, the Calabasas aerospace giant, said its profits fell 22% to $104 
million because of $55 million in special charges against the company's 
results. The charges were taken largely to reduce the value of investments in 
computer software companies and to settle an air-traffic control contract with 
Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disney Profits 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment companies in the Valley area enjoyed healthy profits. In Burbank, 
Walt Disney Co.'s earnings, helped by higher profits for its theme parks and 
resorts, rose 48% from year-earlier levels to $148.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Videocassette sales of Steven Spielberg's "E.T. -- the Extra-Terrestrial" 
pushed MCA's quarterly profit to a record $75.7 million, more than triple the 
Universal City entertainment firm's profits in the same period a year earlier. 
MCA has never specified the videocassette's total sales, although figures for 
the company's video and pay television operations show revenue soared to $268 
million in the quarter, up from $72 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Clark Productions, boosted by new television series and specials, reported 
a $738,000 profit, contrasted with a $1.2-million loss a year earlier for the 
Burbank company. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest loser among all Valley area companies was Micropolis, a Chatsworth 
maker of computer disk drives that lost $15.1 million in the quarter. 
Micropolis and other disk-drive makers have suffered from intense competition, 
price-cutting and manufacturing glitches. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
51% Rise on Higher Sales 
</P>
<P>
Another high-tech company, Dataproducts Corp., reported a 51% jump in its 
profit from a year earlier, to $1.6 million. The Woodland Hills computer 
printer maker, which is being shopped around to potential buyers after an 
investment group bought more than 7% of the company's stock, attributed the 
profit increase to higher sales. 
</P>
<P>
Financial institutions reported mixed results, with Valley-area banks enjoying 
strong profits, whereas savings and loans continued to have problems. 
</P>
<P>
Fast-growing Lincoln Bancorp, the Encino parent of Lincoln National Bank, 
reported a 78% rise in its profit to $1.4 million. Lincoln's net interest 
income, or the amount of interest it earns minus the amount it pays for 
deposits, soared to $5.8 million from $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
The quarterly profit for Citadel Holdings, the Glendale parent company of 
Fidelity Federal Savings &amp; Loan, fell 44% to $4.9 million, in part because 
of interest rates that increased its costs for money. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Glenfed, the parent of Glendale Federal Savings &amp; Loan, saw its 
earnings fall 27% to $35.2 million. Valley Federal reported a slim $116,000 
profit, contrasted with a $2.4-million loss a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
20th Century Gains 
</P>
<P>
Insurance results were mixed. 20th Century Industries, the Woodland Hills 
parent of 20th Century Insurance, reported its profit in the quarter more than 
quadrupled to $14.8 million from $3.1 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
20th Century's profits were helped by higher premiums, which boosted operating 
profits to $4.9 million, as well as by $15.2 million from investment income. 
The company said its premiums could be lowered, depending on the outcome of the 
legal challenges to Proposition 103, the insurance rate reduction initiative 
that passed last year. 
</P>
<P>
Zenith National Insurance's latest quarterly profit fell 20% to $9.2 million. 
The company's results included a $974,000 loss on investments, contrasted with 
a gain of $358,000 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
One of the area's fastest-growing and most profitable companies continues to be 
Martin Lawrence Limited Editions. Profits of the Van Nuys chain of art 
galleries jumped 75% in its most recent quarter to $1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Art on Monthly Payments 
</P>
<P>
The company, which is expanding rapidly, enjoys healthy profits in part because 
it buys art rather than selling it on consignment, which enables it to sell 
works after they have appreciated in value. The company also sells art on 
monthly installments, much like appliance stores sell refrigerators, which 
broadens its potential market. 
</P>
<P>
Cherokee Group, a Sunland clothing firm that is being bought by an investment 
group that includes some of the company's managers, reported that it lost $1.6 
million in its latest quarter. Most of the loss stems from expenses involved in 
the pending $174-million buyout of the company. 
</P>
<P>
Newhall Land &amp; Farming, a real estate development concern whose profits 
fluctuate with house and land sales, reported that profits fell 38% in the 
quarter to $10.1 million from $16.3 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Industries, a Van Nuys maker of wheel rims, said its earnings rose 60% 
to $4.3 million as it continued to enjoy strong orders from car makers. 
</P>
<P>
Amgen, a Thousand Oaks biotechnology company, reported that its earnings 
plunged 50% to $177,000, mostly because of expenses stemming from the expected 
launching of its first commercial drug, an anti-anemia drug called 
erythropoietin. The company is expecting to receive federal approval shortly 
from the Food and Drug Administration to sell the drug.

CRITIC AT LARGE: STAN FREBERG STILL REVERES IRREVERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, Times Arts Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arriving for lunch, Stan Freberg paused to greet an old friend, a woman from 
CBS who remembered "The Matter of the Harp." It was a long time ago, in the 
'50s, when his radio show was a summer replacement for Jack Benny's. 
</P>
<P>
He was planning a sketch called "Gray Flannel Hat Full of Teen-Age Werewolves." 
It satirized some current movies, but the big bang was that the otherwise 
normal werewolf turned into an advertising man when the sun rose. His work, the 
werewolf explained, "that nameless terror of which I dare not speak." 
</P>
<P>
Freberg wanted a harp to underscore the werewolf-to-adman transition. No harp, 
CBS said; it was over-budget. The battle raged for some time. Freberg finally 
said he would pay for it out of his own pocket. The network finally gave in. 
</P>
<P>
"You win a few," Freberg said at lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Freberg has won quite a few over the years. Almost single-handedly he invented 
the throw-away, soft-sell commercial that brought new prosperity to everything 
from aluminum foil to prunes ("Today the pits, tomorrow the wrinkles"), tomato 
paste ("Who puts eight great tomatoes in that little bitty can?") and Chinese 
food. "Nine out of 10 doctors prefer Chun King chow mein," said the voice-over 
and a photograph showed 10 white-coated and solemn men, nine Asians and one 
Caucasian. 
</P>
<P>
Currently Freberg has orchestrated a plan to take the stuffiness out of the 
Encyclopaedia Britannica. Sales are up, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Next Monday, the Nuart Theatre in West Los Angeles is presenting an evening of 
Freberg's work, "A Freberg Mixed-Media Festival." In early April, Capitol 
Records is releasing a compact-disc version of "Stan Freberg Presents The 
United States of America," his musical history whose smash single was "Take an 
Indian to Lunch Today." Teachers still use the LP version, Freberg says, to 
ease the initial pain of studying history for their reluctant students. 
</P>
<P>
Freberg has also recently published the first volume of his autobiography. 
Called "It Only Hurts When I Laugh" (Times Books), it carries his life through 
1963 and his disastrous association with producer David Merrick. Merrick wanted 
to do Freberg's history as a Broadway musical. They fell out when, among other 
things, Merrick wanted to move Barbara Fritchie from the Civil War to the 
Revolutionary War because the latter lacked strong women, and insisted on 
taking Abraham Lincoln out of the Civil War entirely "because he doesn't work" 
(which Freberg says was Merrick's exact quote). 
</P>
<P>
The son and grandson of ministers, raised in Pasadena, Freberg seemed oddly 
cast as an irreverent satirist. But he grew up on Fred Allen and the other 
great radio voices, started clowning in high school, entertained while he was 
in the Army (after a stint as a reporter on a post newspaper edited by Sgt. 
Forrest J. Ackerman who later became the foremost collector of sci-fi and 
monster memorabilia). 
</P>
<P>
Freberg got a tentative start in radio doing animals, rushing off to the Los 
Angeles Zoo to check out what a marmoset sounded like. His first wide attention 
came on the long-running puppet show "Time for Beanie," which he did with the 
late Daws Butler for Bob Clampett, creator of the characters. 
</P>
<P>
The commercials came a bit later and his approach, Freberg says, "was that I 
always tried to write ads for myself. E. B. White said the true writer always 
plays to an audience of one." Freberg was weary of the hard sell, and fond of 
making virtues out of weakness. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser aluminum foil had almost no distribution. Freberg came up with a cartoon 
salesman bonging grocers with a mallet to win them over. Henry J. Kaiser, 
living in Hawaii, was appalled at the impudence, Freberg says, but the campaign 
produced more than 40,000 new retail outlets for the foil. 
</P>
<P>
His conversation, and his book, record the resistance to irreverence he has 
encountered at ad agencies, radio and television networks and even at Capitol 
Records, where his broadside against the commercialization of Christmas, "Green 
Chri 
</P>
<P>
ma$," made everyone very, very nervous until it became a hit. 
</P>
<P>
CBS forced him to re-do the major skit on his first network radio show within 
hours of show time. It documented a rivalry between the El Sodom and the Rancho 
Gomorrah hotels in a not-quite mythical city he called Las Voraces (the 
greedy). The competition ended when one hotel hydrogen-bombed its rival, and 
indeed all of Las Voraces, into infinity. The network made Freberg settle for 
an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you lose," Freberg has said. 
</P>
<P>
What has become clear is that Freberg has honored his ministerial origins. He 
has a true satirist's contempt for the shabby, exploitative and meretricious 
but the contempt has been expressed as humor. 
</P>
<P>
These days he is a creative consultant, working from offices in his home in 
Beverly Hills and doing a good deal of teaching and lecturing. He still uses 
the award-winning logo Saul Bass designed a few years ago for his Stan Freberg, 
Ltd. (But Not Very). 
</P>
<P>
The company seal shows a seal, wearing dark glasses (this is California) and a 
medal with a fish on it. "A bass," Bass explained at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Freberg's motto, "Ars Gratia Pecuniae" means "Art for the Sake of Money." "I 
usually have to translate the joke," he says, "but I was talking at a Catholic 
college in Minnesota and they laughed at the Latin." 
</P>
<P>
Recently Freberg devised a show for the Disney Channel called "Light Bulb," 
about inventors and inventions, aimed at children but watchable by the whole 
family. "You can do it. 'Time for Beanie' was like that," says Freberg; "Albert 
Einstein watched it while he was staying at Caltech." But the channel rejected 
the show, to Freberg's considerable disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
Prospects look better for a radio show he is discussing with the Smithsonian 
Institution, a 13-week series that would become the centerpiece of an audio 
exhibit at the Smithsonian in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Contemplating the trend to funny commercials that he launched, Freberg says, "I 
let all the creative people out of the closet. Now I think we got to get 'em 
back in the closet and start again." 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, Freberg is doing commercials about learning disabilities, 
and it is clear that what you sell funny is as important to him as how you sell 
funny.

CIGARETTE FIRMS UNDER FIRE FOR PAID DISPLAY IN MOVIES

Tobacco companies that pay to have their cigarettes displayed prominently in 
major motion pictures -- as in "Superman II," "Supergirl" and the upcoming 
James Bond movie, "License to Kill" -- may be breaking the law if the movies 
are shown on TV or without a health warning, a congressman charged Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Thomas Luken (D-Ohio) called the promotional spots in movies, which he 
said amount to paid advertisement, a violation of congressional bans against 
cigarette advertisement on television or elsewhere without a health warning by 
the surgeon general. 
</P>
<P>
Luken, chairman of the House subcommittee on transportation and hazardous 
materials, said tobacco company Phillip Morris agreed to pay $350,000 to the 
makers of "License to Kill" to have Lark cigarettes used in the film as one of 
James Bond's secret weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"Tobacco companies are on the attack seeking to increase their power and 
influence while continuing to recruit new addicts to the smoking habit," Luken 
said. "These movies reportedly do not carry the surgeon general's warning (and) 
the movies are shown on television, which is absolutely prohibited by law." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Phillip Morris called Luken's press conference "an attempt to 
curtail people who make artistic decisions," and said the "film maker has 
absolute discretion as to the content of the film and we stand behind that 
100%." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Taylor, director of communications for Phillip Morris, said that in the 
last 10 years, her company has only paid for movie promotions twice and 
defended the James Bond deal by saying that the movie is being produced outside 
the United States and will be distributed internationally. 
</P>
<P>
However, Luken called that argument "the usual evasion" and predicted it would 
not hold up in court if the case were brought to trial. 
</P>
<P>
Luken said he has written a letter to U. S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh asking 
him to consider "prosecution of those persons and companies involved in 
contracting for blatant advertising of cigarettes in movies." 
</P>
<P>
The letter requests that the attorney general investigate whether federal laws 
are being broken and to determine what steps, if any, could be taken to stop 
the activity. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that paying to have a particular cigarette appear in a movie is in 
fact an advertisement," he said in the letter. "I request that you investigate 
these payments." 
</P>
<P>
No one at the Justice Department was available for comment on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The practice of paying for visibility in movies has become fairly common in 
recent years, most notably in the smash success "E.T.," where Reese's Pieces 
candies were prominently displayed. 
</P>
<P>
But Luken said that deals involving tobacco products violate laws that do not 
apply to other products. "It is a federal crime to violate any provision of the 
Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertisement Act," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In "License to Kill," Luken said, James Bond uses Lark cigarettes as a secret 
weapon, while a spokesman for the Coalition on Smoking or Health said that 
"Lois Lane smokes constantly" in the Superman movie.

The Chevy Chase name still appears to guarantee a big opening. Chase's "Fletch 
Lives" enjoyed the second largest opening of the year so far, behind Tom Hanks' 
"The 'burbs." "Fletch Lives" grossed $8 million at 1,479 screens, or $5,440 per 
screen. That's a strong showing, considering this is a a slow time of year for 
the movie business. It's also slightly better than "Fletch" did when it opened 
in spring, 1985. Columbia's "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen," now playing 
on 46 screens, dropped 26% from the previous week, grossing $432,1237 for a 
current total of $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
* The opening of "Rooftops" was not an auspicious one for the newly reorganized 
New Visions Pictures. The film grossed only $1.1 million, despite a wide 
release to 1,043 theaters.

JOHN GLINES: DEVELOPING POSITIVE SELF-IMAGES FOR GAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On June 5, 1983, John Glines accepted a best play Tony Award for his production 
of Harvey Fierstein's "Torch Song Trilogy." 
</P>
<P>
In his nationally televised speech, the producer thanked everyone who'd been a 
part of the show -- including his then-partner and lover Lawrence Lane. At the 
end of the heady evening, Fierstein's limo deposited Glines in front of his 
Brooklyn apartment, where cheering neighbors had festooned the building with a 
banner and streamers. On June 7, there was a death threat on his answering 
machine. The curb outside was spray-painted with the words "Die, Faggot, Die." 
</P>
<P>
"I had thanked my lover on television," Glines, 55, explained calmly. "There 
are people who bash fags, kill them. Sure, I was frightened. How do you get 
over it? You read Martin Luther King and think, 'My God, a man lived with that 
his entire life.' So you do what you have to do. I knew what I was saying on 
television was crucial to gay people. And on the other end of the death 
threats, was the outpouring of mail from all over the country -- people saying 
how much what I'd done had meant to them." 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland native -- a small, pale man with a ready smile -- didn't set out to 
be a crusader. "When I was growing up and thought I was maybe that way (gay), I 
went to the library and found out what you did: You killed yourself," he said 
sardonically, referring to such cautionary tales as "The Children's Hour." 
"That was the mid-'40s, and I knew it would be very difficult. But I also knew 
I wanted to change things." 
</P>
<P>
His latest contribution to the cause is "On Tina Tuna Walk" (opening Thursday 
at the Callboard Theatre), the Fire Island-set story of a group of former Yale 
roommates who decide to help one of their buddies out of his writing slump by 
hiring an actor to seduce him. Offered Glines, "It's about creativity and love 
-- all the different kinds of love: passionate love, love of friends, the 
platonic love of a gay man and a straight man." 
</P>
<P>
Developing positive gay self-images to replace negative stereotypes ("We're not 
all in drag; we don't all climb into leather") was the impetus behind the 
writer-producer's founding of the542008695riginated. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, Glines, who had originally gone East to study acting at Yale, had 
worked as an actor, dancer and director -- but was earning his living writing 
for children's television. The move to producing came after the failure of one 
of his own plays. Glines decided it was the producer's fault and determined to 
learn that end of the business. The attraction was immediate. "I was running on 
all cylinders," he said happily. "As the creative producer, you have your 
fingers in all the pieces of the pie." 
</P>
<P>
From that vantage, he also has been able to enjoy watching the evolving 
attitudes toward gay theater. "When I started the Glines (Company), it was 
tough," he said. "I thought I'd never write for children's television again. 
But it was also one of the reasons I used my own name -- to say, 'Look, we're 
here.' In those days, actors and playwrights often used a different name when 
they were involved in a gay project. The first audition I did, six people 
showed up." 
</P>
<P>
The resistance was entrenched. Glines recalled that in 1976, the New York Times 
refused to use the word gay to describe him or his subject matter. "Now it 
doesn't matter," he said with a shrug. "Doing a gay play on Broadway is not a 
big deal, thanks to 'Torch Song.' Then came 'Cage aux Folles,' 'M. Butterfly,' 
Derek Jacobi in 'Breaking the Code.' They don't even tell you the lead (in 
"Code") is a gay man' -- it's just accepted. At least on the New York stage." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Glines said, the challenge has been in going back to writing. 
</P>
<P>
"For a while, children's television was challenging," he said. "Then I got good 
at it, then I loved it, then it got to be a job. The show I did, 'Sesame 
Street,' had set characters. They didn't follow a script, they followed an 
outline. There was the premise, the development and the payoff. That's what you 
did for Bert and Ernie or Big Bird and Mr. Hooper: You played structure, not 
wit. This play ("Tina Tuna") is very witty, very wordy, very multisyllabic . . 
. all those things I couldn't do for years on television." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Glines believes the two worlds -- children's TV and gay theater -- 
are not that far apart. 
</P>
<P>
"They both have to do with enlightening," he said, noting that "Tina Tuna's" 
producers refer to him as "Mother." "It comes from the idea of Father being the 
stern one, and Mother being the one who you can go to -- who's loving, 
empathetic, holds your hand. If I had not gone into theater, I would have been 
in psychology: learning and helping and teaching others." 
</P>
<P>
Having picked theater, however, Glines has no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the things life offered," he said simply. "I was dealt certain cards 
and I played them. Someone called me: Did I want to write for 'Captain 
Kangaroo'? Well, I'd never seen the show. But I watched it the next morning -- 
then went in, auditioned and got the job. Then my first plays were 
unsuccessful, so I learned production. That was the first time my personal life 
was absolutely matched with my professional life. Now it's all a part of me. 
It's who I am."

PHOTOGRAPHY CENTER SETS LECTURE SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In honor of the 150th anniversary of the art of photography, the Los Angeles 
Photography Center will launch a lecture series that will feature nine Southern 
California photographers next month. 
</P>
<P>
Called "Visual Statement," the series will take place each Wednesday and 
Saturday night, 7:30-10 p.m., at the center, 412 South Park View St. Each 
program will consist of a slide show, lecture, exhibition and 
question-and-answer period. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt it was a good opportunity to spotlight photographers who work in 
Southern California, and give the community a chance to interact with them. Too 
often, the only place you see the works of these photographers is in books and 
we want to let the public see them in action," said Willie Middlebrook, 
director of the center, which currently boasts 500 members. 
</P>
<P>
The schedule: 
</P>
<P>
April 1, Bruce Barnbaum, nature photography; April 5, Jose Galvez, Los Angeles 
Times photographer; April 8, Kenda North, on the 24x24-inch Polaroid; April 12, 
Robert Glenn Ketchum, landscape photography; April 15, Laura Parker, fine art 
photography; April 19, Ray McSavaney, landscape/nature photography; April 22, 
Bruce W. Palamon, photojournalism (covered the '84 and '88 Jesse Jackson 
presidential campaigns for Time magazine); April 26, Meibao Nee, Asian-American 
culture photography; April 29, Jan Pietrzak, nature photography.

<P>
YEAR'S MOST BORING FILMS (YAWN) ANNOUNCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The winners of the fifth annual Most Boring Films of the Year Awards have been 
announced by the Boring Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Murphy took top honors for his two 1988 releases, "Raw" and "Coming to 
America." "Murphy's films are unquestionably successful, but they're also 
unrelentingly tasteless," said Alan Caruba, the institute's founder. 
</P>
<P>
In the action film category was "Above the Law," a film written, produced, and 
starring Hollywood newcomer Steven Seagal. " 'Above' was way below par, mostly 
for its excessive, tiresome violence," said Caruba, noting that "1988 was a big 
year for mindlessly muscle-bound films." Others nominated included "Rambo III," 
"Braddock: Missing in Action III" and "Red Heat." 
</P>
<P>
Comedies in 1988 fared no better. "Switching Channels" was named most boring 
comedy by the institute. "A major embarrassment for its stars," said Caruba. 
Other comedies nominated as top bores were "Hot to Trot," "Arthur 2," 
"Caddyshack II," "Police Academy 5," "High Spirits" and "Overboard." 
</P>
<P>
Replacing the category of most boring performance by an actor or actress, the 
institute introduced a new category, big stars -- big flops, which takes in 
"most of the films" made by Whoopi Goldberg and Chevy Chase. "We know they have 
talent," says Caruba, "so why are they making films like 'Clara's Heart' and 
'Funny Farm?' " 
</P>
<P>
Serious drama took a drubbing in 1988. "The Unbearable Lightness of Being," 
according to the institute, "is bearable only if you watch it on your VCR using 
the fast-forward speed." Others included "Barfly," "Betrayed," "Cry Freedom" 
and "The Moderns." 
</P>
<P>
Noting that there were more than 500 films released in 1988, Caruba said, "It's 
astonishing how many were so bad they went straight from the theaters to the 
video stores in just under 72 hours."

Two men armed with a pistol and a sledgehammer stole $132,000 in jewelry from a 
Northridge discount store, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
The men, who are still at large, entered the Best Products store at 19358 
Nordhoff St. about 8:30 p.m. Monday, ordered a clerk to open a display case and 
emptied the jewelry into a pillowcase before speeding away in a stolen 1979 
Buick, according to detective Damon Loomis of the Los Angeles Police 
Department. The car was found minutes later abandoned several blocks away, he 
said. The men were picked up by a second getaway car driven by a third person, 
who also has not been apprehended, Loomis said.

More than 1,200 flight attendants with Continental Airlines, like Eastern 
Airlines a subsidiary of Texas Air Corp., have gone on strike, a union 
spokeswoman said today on the second day of a walkout. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had 1,207 flight attendants either walk off of aircraft or not show up 
for work. We're very encouraged," spokeswoman Myra Clayton said. "Those are not 
people who are sick or have days off." Continental has had to delay a number of 
flights, she said, and called in all its reserve employees. 
</P>
<P>
Continental, however, said in a statement that only about 2% of its 6,500 
flight attendants have responded to the call by the Union of Flight Attendants 
and said the action has had no effect on its operations.

Dozens of students were rescued from a third-floor ledge during a smoky fire in 
a hall at UC Santa Barbara, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
One student suffered two sprained ankles, apparently in leaping onto the ledge, 
and two others suffered minor smoke inhalation, said Keith Collum, spokesman 
for the Santa Barbara County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters responding to a 7:23 p.m. alarm found smoke pouring from the third 
floor of Phelps Hall and 20 to 40 students awaiting rescue on a third-floor 
ledge, Collum said. "Firefighters evacuated all the students from the building 
safely," he said, and the blaze was controlled in 35 minutes. The cost of the 
damage was estimated at $30,000.

JUSTICES GIVE CREDITORS OF FAILED S&amp;LS GO-AHEAD TO SUE FOR FUNDS

The Supreme Court ruled today that creditors of failed savings and loan 
associations may sue those institutions without first waiting for any action 
from the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. 
</P>
<P>
In a significant victory for the thousands of creditors owed billions by failed 
S&amp;Ls nationwide, the court said federal courts may hear such lawsuits 
before the bank board, the federal agency that regulates the industry, takes 
any action. 
</P>
<P>
The 9-0 ruling rejuvenated a $113-million federal court claim made by a Texas 
land deals group against an Arkansas-based S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
In an opinion by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the court said federal courts -- 
and not the Federal Savings Loan Insurance Corp. -- have the initial authority 
to review disputes between failed S&amp;Ls and their creditors. 
</P>
<P>
"We hold that Congress did not grant FSLIC such (exclusive) power and that the 
creditors of a failed savings and loan association are entitled to . . . 
consideration of their claims in court," O'Connor said.

Coroner's investigators are attempting to identify a man who was fatally shot 
in the head and left near the railroad tracks in North Hollywood, authorities 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
The man, who appeared to be a transient between 25 and 35 years old, died last 
Friday night or early Saturday, said Detective Paul Stewart of the Los Angeles 
Police Department's Van Nuys division. An employee of a nearby business 
discovered the body Monday morning in an industrial area in the 12500 block of 
Raymer Street, near the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks, Stewart said. An 
autopsy by the Los Angeles County coroner's office is scheduled for Wednesday, 
he said.

A 26-year-old pregnant subway rider, declaring "I am ready," gave birth today 
in the tool room of a bustling mid-town Manhattan subway station with the help 
of two Transit Police officers.

Martha Davis, who is homeless, left the train during the morning rush hour and

ready to give birth to her sixth child. The two officers whisked the woman to a 
tool room in the station where she gave birth to a girl 10 minutes later. She 
and the child were then taken to Roosevelt Hospital where both were reported in 
good condition.

A court today rejected an appeal to free dissident playwright Vaclav Havel, but 
the judge reduced one charge and trimmed his nine-month jail term by a month. 
</P>
<P>
The decision concerning Havel, convicted and jailed in connection with a 
protest in January, was greeted with cries of "Shame!" and "Release him!" from 
a crowd of about 150 supporters who jammed a corridor outside the courtroom. 
Havel's fellow Charter 77 activist Vaclav Maly, allowed into the courtroom to 
translate for an Austrian legal expert, termed the verdict "prefabricated."

In an extraordinary public confession, Prime Minister Bob Hawke tearfully 
admitted to a national TV audience today that he had been unfaithful to his 
wife of 33 years. 
</P>
<P>
Hawke made the admission in a taped interview on Channel 7's Newsworld program. 
His confession made headlines in every Australian newspaper this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Hawke, 59, acknowledged reports of his womanizing, saying it was in the past. 
He pledged his love for his wife, Hazel, calling her an "incredible woman." 
</P>
<P>
The last time Hawke broke down on television was when he referred in 1984 to 
drug problems among members of his family. Hazel Hawke later went on television 
to explain that their daughter, Roslyn, and her husband, Matt, had been treated 
for heroin addiction. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Hawke said today's admission is not new. "All this has been 
said before," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
Hawke has said he will seek a record fourth term as prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Hawke was asked what people mean when they accuse him of 
being a womanizer. 
</P>
<P>
"They mean I was unfaithful to my wife," Hawke replied. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson: "Is that true?" 
</P>
<P>
Hawke: "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
Robertson: "Did you stop that?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Hawke replied in tears, and then, "I guess there are not many women who 
would have put up with me all that time. But my love for her never changes. I 
have always loved Hazel, always will." 
</P>
<P>
Hawke also referred to his past drinking, which his biographer Blanche 
d'Alpuget says earned him an entry in the Guinness Book of World Records when 
he drank 2 1/2 pints of beer in 12 seconds while studying at Oxford University 
in Britain. Hawke quit drinking in 1979.

TRIDENT 2 TUMBLES, BLOWS UP IN FAILURE OF FIRST SEA LAUNCH

<P>
A Trident 2 missile somersaulted end over end and exploded in a spectacular 
fireball four seconds after launch from a submarine today in a major failure 
for the first sea test of the Navy's deadliest weapon system. 
</P>
<P>
With a Soviet trawler on hand to witness the brief flight, the three-stage 
$26.5-million missile, carrying a load of dummy warheads, was fired from the 
Tennessee at 11:20 a.m. while the giant submarine was cruising submerged east 
of Cape Canaveral. 
</P>
<P>
Propelled from one of the Tennessee's 24 missile tubes by a powerful charge of 
compressed gas, the first stage of the 126,000-pound solid-fuel missile ignited 
as planned seconds after the rocket cleared the ocean surface. Almost 
instantly, the big missile began cartwheeling through the sky, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
"It went up just like normal, it popped out of the water and then it spiraled 
around twice and then it exploded," photographer Bill Mitchell said by 
radiotelephone from an observation ship 5,000 yards from the submarine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Two Quick Loops' 
</P>
<P>
"It got about two missile lengths above the water. It was like the engine 
gimbaled over to one side and then it made two quick loops, end over end. It 
cartwheeled . . . and then it exploded." 
</P>
<P>
An Air Force spokesman, reading a statement, said the first stage fired as 
planned and that a "malfunction during first-stage powered flight" caused it to 
"veer off course." 
</P>
<P>
"It self-destructed after about four seconds of flight," he said. "Exact cause 
of the malfunction can't be determined until telemetry data is studied." 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth failure of a Trident 2 test flight in 20 launches dating back 
to January, 1987, and was especially disappointing to the Navy because it came 
during the first sea test of the new weapon system. The others were launched 
from a ground pad at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
6,900-Mile Range 
</P>
<P>
The 44-foot missiles are thought to have a maximum range of up to 6,900 miles, 
depending on how many warheads are carried, and they are believed to be so 
accurate they can deliver an independently targetable nuclear bomb to within 
400 feet of a target. 
</P>
<P>
Critics claim that with such pinpoint accuracy the Trident 2 could be used to 
knock out "hardened" enemy command posts and missile silos and as such, it 
should be viewed as a "first-strike" offensive weapon. 
</P>
<P>
The missile system has been a frequent target for protesters at the Cape 
Canaveral Air Force Station since test flights began in January, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The Trident 2 is built by Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. of Sunnyvale, Calif.

A Transbrasil Boeing 707 cargo plane slammed into an apartment house and then 
into a crowded shantytown slum today in a crash that officials said killed at 
least 18 people and injured up to 200 others. 
</P>
<P>
The plane crashed about one mile from Sao Paulo International Airport, doctors 
at the scene said. 
</P>
<P>
They said the plane's crew of three and at least 15 people on the ground were 
killed and dozens more injured. Television reports said up to 200 were hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"There was an explosion and a lot of smoke. I could feel the heat in my house 
(130 feet) away from the crash," said local resident Maria Idalina. 
</P>
<P>
At the crash scene, the jet's tail was intact. But the rest of the Boeing 707 
was just scattered wreckage among the remains of eight houses and many 
shantytown shacks. 
</P>
<P>
Rescuers at the scene said they pulled children alive from the wreckage. "But 
there are many dead," said one. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Child Saved 
</P>
<P>
Television reports said doctors had operated on a pregnant woman killed in the 
crash and managed to save her child. 
</P>
<P>
Boxes of television sets, radios and toys, some undamaged, lay on the ground. 
The plane had been carrying goods from factories in a manufacturing zone that 
the government has set up in the Amazon town of Manaus. 
</P>
<P>
An official of the private Transbrasil airline said the plane had been 
regularly serviced with the help of Boeing technicians. 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials said the pilot of the Transbrasil plane on a flight from 
Manaus radioed the control tower just before the crash requesting an emergency 
landing, but they did not know why.

The White House today announced appointment of a task force to review 
environmental considerations in two areas off California and one off Florida 
where President Bush has postponed offshore oil leasing. 
</P>
<P>
The task force will look into potential environmental damage from drilling in 
federal waters off Northern California, Southern California and the southern 
Gulf Coast of Florida, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Establishment of the task force keeps a promise Bush made when he made his 
budget proposal to Congress last month. He said he would postpone leasing in 
the three areas pending the report of a committee of representatives of the 
Interior and Energy departments and the National Academy of Sciences. The task 
force report is due on the President's desk by Jan. 1, 1990.

CONSUMER PRICES POST MODERATE RISE; 
</P>
<P>
0.4% INCREASE IN FEBRUARY HELPS CALM INFLATION FEARS IN FINANCIAL MARKETS

<P>
Consumer prices, despite a huge jump in gasoline costs, rose a moderate 0.4% in 
February, the government said today in a report that helped calm inflation 
fears that had gripped financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
The boost in the Labor Department's consumer price index followed a 0.6% 
January increase that had been the largest monthly advance in two years. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the moderation in February, consumer prices in the last two months have 
risen at a compound annual rate of 6.1%, sharply higher than the 4.4% increase 
turned in for both 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
That acceleration has economists worried that inflation, which has been tamed 
for the last seven years, is starting to get out of control again. 
</P>
<P>
Financial markets, however, took today's report on consumer prices more calmly 
than they did last Friday after the government reported that inflation at the 
wholesale level shot up 1% in February. 
</P>
<P>
Some economists said the report on consumer prices showed that while inflation 
will be higher this year, the country is not in danger of entering another 
inflationary spiral. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Premature' Fears 
</P>
<P>
"There is evidence that the jump in food prices resulting from last year's 
drought is now tapering off and energy prices are unlikely to go higher," said 
Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist for the National Assn. of Manufacturers. 
"Fears of inflation accelerating out of control appear to be premature." 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Forman, an economist for the WEFA Group, an economic consulting firm, 
said retail prices will be climbing higher in coming months as the increases at 
the wholesale level flow through to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"Inflation has ratcheted up a notch, but it hasn't moved into the inflationary 
spiral that a number of people were concerned about," Forman said. 
</P>
<P>
The consumer price increase last month was held back by a better performance 
for food costs, which advanced 0.5% in February, down from a 0.7% gain a month 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
However, gasoline costs shot up 1.7% last month, the biggest increase since a 
1.8% rise last August. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oil Prices 
</P>
<P>
Economists were braced for even sharper price advances in coming months as the 
effects of recent rises in world oil prices filter through to motorists. Crude 
oil prices, reflecting the success of petroleum producers to restrain output, 
have risen to a 17-month high of $20 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
The slight moderation in food costs reflected price declines for poultry, fish 
and eggs and smaller increases than in January for beef and pork prices. 
</P>
<P>
Beef prices rose 0.5%, following a 1.2% January increase, while pork prices 
rose 0.4%, after also being up 1.2% in January. 
</P>
<P>
Labor Department price economist Patrick Jackman said meat prices will probably 
continue to rise for several more months, reflecting the herd reductions that 
occurred last summer during the severe drought. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increases Not Expected 
</P>
<P>
But Jackman said the drought's impact on other food costs has already passed 
through to consumers, with further increases not expected. 
</P>
<P>
Also helping to hold back consumer prices in February was a 0.2% dip in 
clothing costs, as a 0.7% drop for men's apparel offset a 0.9% jump for women's 
garments and a 2.8% increase in infants' clothes.

<P>
In the weeks leading up to the NCAA tournament, more than a few fans in this 
basketball-mad city grumbled quietly about this year's version of the Runnin' 
Rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Seven losses and a No. 15 ranking may go over well in some parts, but for 
spoiled Nevada-Las Vegas fans it's almost a wasted season. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just to the point where Vegas fans expect us to be great every year," 
UNLV coach Jerry Tarkanian said. "We can't be great every year. No one can." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe not great, but the Runnin' Rebels are good enough to make the NCAA's 
round of 16, where UNLV gets the dubious distinction of facing No. 1 Arizona on 
Thursday in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
The game is a rematch of a December contest in Tucson won by Arizona 86-75. But 
both Arizona and UNLV will be different teams this time around. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV has found an inside game and some consistency among its young players, 
while Arizona also is peaking at just the right time with two blowouts to open 
play in the West Regional at Boise, Ida.. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at their scores, and they're burying people," Tarkanian said after a 
practice session. "They've really come a long ways."

UNLV has won eight straight games itself and 13 of its last 14. The last UNLV 
loss came at the hands of Louisiana State on a 3-pointer at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference now is that he (Tarkanian) has his team rounded into shape," 
Arizona coach Lute Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
The game figures to be a match-up between UNLV's quickness and man-to-man 
pressure and Arizona's dominating inside game, led by All-American Sean 
Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott had 32 points and 15 rebounds in the first game between the two teams. 
</P>
<P>
"He played that night like he invented the game," Tarkanian said. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona had 15 turnovers in the first game, but that was before steady Matt 
Muehlebach was inserted into the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"Unlike some teams, we have more than one guy who can handle the ball," Olson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV's 28-7 record may not be as good as some of the rabid fans might like, but 
five of the losses were by a total of seven points and UNLV played its toughest 
non-conference road schedule ever. 
</P>
<P>
Consistency for Tarkanian means his fifth appearance in the sweet 16 and a 
chance to go to the Final Four for the second time in three years. 
</P>
<P>
"We're fortunate we've been so good for so long," he said. "But we've already 
got people calling us and asking when the playoffs are for next year so they 
can plan their vacations. That's ridiculous."

Calgary Flames right wing Mark Hunter was suspended for three games without pay 
today for hitting New York Rangers defense man Michel Petit with his stick in a 
game March 13, the NHL announced. 
</P>
<P>
League Executive Vice President Brian O'Neill said Hunter "deliberately swung 
his stick at the back of his opponent and with sufficient force to cause him to 
fall to the ice. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though the blow did not result in serious injury, the player must be 
responsible for his actions." 
</P>
<P>
The suspension would take effect March 28 but can begin immediately if the 
Flames agree to waive the seven-day period in which an appeal may be filed. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, 26, has 22 goals and eight assists in 62 games with Calgary this 
season.
