NAMIBIA: MAJOR U.N. ACHIEVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Africa's last colony, Namibia, became free today, setting a new standard for a 
smooth and constructive transition to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
The achievement is the work of many, most important the United Nations, which 
has overseen 33 years of decolonization in Africa. It was the United Nations 
that developed the plan to free Namibia, prodded South Africa to abandon its 
illegal hold on the territory, organized the repatriation of 40,000 exiles, 
supervised the election and now will help coordinate the assistance that will 
be necessary for years to come. Other remarkable contributions have come from 
both black and white political leaders of Namibia, none more influential than 
Sam Nujoma. It was he who led the South-West Africa People's Organization in 
its long war of resistance to South African control, and then won a stunning 
election victory to become leader of the new nation. He used his power to 
develop consensus, resulting in a constitution based on multiple parties and a 
market-oriented economy. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has had a special role. It was President Woodrow Wilson who 
devised a trusteeship under the League of Nations that ended German control of 
Namibia (then known as South-West Africa) at the end of World War I. Donald F. 
McHenry, while deputy U.S. representative to the U.N. Security Council, played 
a key part in drafting the 1978 U.N. plan for independence. The role was more 
controversial after 1980, as the Reagan Administration linked independence to 
the withdrawal of Cuban troops from neighboring Angola and, with its policy of 
"constructive engagement," may have encouraged the obstinacy of South Africa. 
But ultimately the State Department played a central role in negotiating South 
Africa's agreement to free the vast territory. 
</P>
<P>
In Namibia, as in another neighboring nation, Zimbabwe, the black majority has 
exercised moderation and treated the white minority with respect. It is a model 
that could help South Africa chart its new course to majority rule. It is a 
model that could inspire all the nations of Africa.

ALASKA CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I agree that the penalty be fair and not vindictive, but the problem with a 
plea bargain in this case is that it can hide the facts, the truth, about what 
happened from the public. 
</P>
<P>
What's fair in this case doesn't have to do with dollars, it has to do with the 
dishonesty of Exxon in saying that it had the resources available to handle a 
spill of this nature and didn't. Exxon has demonstrated almost unbelievable 
greed and arrogance throughout this whole matter, and whatever decision is 
reached it needs to be one that is most likely to protect the public. Perhaps 
it's time to start considering prison terms for corporate executives.

ALASKA CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your suggestion ("Why Rule Out a Plea Bargain?" editorial, March 7) that Alaska 
be made partner to the settlement of Exxon's plea bargain is to suggest Alaska 
help settle a crime in which it shares blame. Alaska, Exxon and Alyeska 
Pipeline Corp. neglected their duty to protect a national treasure, the Prince 
William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
Alyeska, responsible for continuing operation of the pipeline, accepted the 
state-mandated obligation to maintain cleanup equipment and quick response 
teams in the Port of Valdez. The response teams included much of Valdez's 
population who were practiced and drilled regularly. That is until Alaskans 
allowed their legislature to repeal the quick response teams. Legislatures 
don't move today without a lobbying push and oil spill damage is minimized with 
fast cleanup as seen with the British Petroleum spill. Therefore, blame for 
much of the Exxon spill damage must fall on Alyeska, Alaska's legislature, and 
by extension the citizens of Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
The board of directors of Exxon, Exxon Shipping and Alyeska as well as Alaskan 
legislators and the skipper of the boat should be sentenced to swabbing the 
shore. A corps of Alaskan citizens should be enlisted to aid the convicts, 
everyone healing their psyche through penance.

Don't you just love it when the American Medical Assn. jumps into the parade 
with its own desperately fabricated float after all the genuine floats put 
together by the real contributors have gone by ("AMA Urges Care for All 
Workers," Part A, March 8). 
</P>
<P>
Here they are with a "sweeping package" for health care which they "decline" to 
put a price on. 
</P>
<P>
Tucked in at the end of this altruistic stuff is the stinging tail of the AMA 
scorpion. The AMA also "would revise medical malpractice laws to reduce 
liability insurance cost for physicians." 
</P>
<P>
AMA, you have been so remiss in governing yourself -- you are, after all a 
"doctors' club" not a consumer protective agency -- that you have come in with 
too little too late.

NICARAGUA'S ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I must take exception to William Goodfellow's mendacious account ("Others Await 
the Arias Cure," Op-Ed Page, March 2) of the road to Nicaragua's recent 
elections. It is so rife with error and untruth I'm not sure where to begin. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Goodfellow informs us that "standing for election before economic 
recovery turned out to be (President Daniel) Ortega's biggest miscalculation." 
Economic recovery? This is the same regime that drove the Nicaraguan economy 
into the ground with its 19th-Century Marxist theories. 
</P>
<P>
Another salient deception is Goodfellow's attempt to portray the Sandinista 
junta as being almost eager to hold elections, when in fact they had to be 
dragged into them kicking and screaming, while attempting to intimidate the 
opposition with their roving bands of thugs. It was not Sandinista integrity 
that guaranteed a fair election, but instead intense international scrutiny and 
the presence of Jimmy Carter and other independent election observers, coupled 
with the knowledge that the Soviet Union would no longer finance and arm their 
bankrupt revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Let the battalion of Sandinista apologists camped out in Washington wail and 
moan over their heroes electoral thumping. Nicaragua, and the world, will be 
better off without K-mart Castros like Daniel Ortega who brutalize and 
impoverish their subjects.

JIMMY CARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There has been considerable negative clamor about the prospects of Richard 
Nixon returning to political activism. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Carter has recently been involved in the Nicaraguan electoral process 
(taking advantage of the news coverage to criticize the policies of the Reagan 
and Bush Administrations). 
</P>
<P>
Currently, he is adventuring into the "Mideast peace process" situation. 
</P>
<P>
Lest we forget, this is the same Jimmy Carter whose ineptness brought the 
United States to its knees with regard to our international posture and 
domestic economy. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, his policies (or lack of them) led to the fall of the shah of 
Iran (one of our best allies), the hostage situation, the hostage rescue 
fiasco, the Soviet incursion into Afghanistan, the communization of Nicaragua, 
the negotiated loss of the Panama Canal, the highest domestic inflation rate 
(that we have ever suffered), the gutting of our defenses and intelligence 
agencies -- all occurred on Jimmy Carter's watch! 
</P>
<P>
It is naive to perceive Carter's activities as altruistic (including his 
poverty area home-building projects). He is obviously maneuvering for political 
gain.

GUAM'S GROTESQUE MUDDLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If its potential consequences were not so serious, it would be tempting to 
dismiss the constitutional drama now being played out in Guam as theater of the 
absurd. However, when the first legal action taken under the island's 
restrictive new anti-abortion statute seeks not to halt termination of a 
pregnancy but to prohibit speech, it is clear that what's in progress is comedy 
too dark for laughs. 
</P>
<P>
Guam is a self-governing U.S. territory. Its residents, most of whom profess 
Roman Catholicism, are American citizens. Earlier this month, Guam's 21 
territorial senators -- all but one a Catholic -- passed America's most 
restrictive anti-abortion legislation shortly after the island's archbishop 
threatened anyone who voted against the measure with excommunication. Monday, 
Guam's governor signed the bill into law, despite the opinion of his attorney 
general that the statute is patently unconstitutional. It prohibits termination 
of any pregnancy unless two doctors declare that the mother's life is in danger 
or that her health will be gravely impaired by giving birth. Under the law, 
anyone who performs an abortion can be prosecuted as a felon; women who undergo 
abortion face misdemeanor charges, as does anyone who advises or solicits 
terminating pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, during a speech to the Guam Press Club, Janet Benshoof, director of 
the American Civil Liberties Union's Reproductive Rights Project, advised 
pregnant women that they could leave the island and obtain abortions in Hawaii. 
She has been charged with soliciting abortion. If convicted, she may be jailed 
for one year and fined $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Cooler heads will sort out the grotesque muddle created on Guam, but not before 
the right to privacy established in Roe vs. Wade and delicate questions of free 
speech are put to a burdensome and dangerous test. If there is any value to 
this distasteful exercise, it is that it reminds us again that a woman's right 
to decide her fate in the private sanctuary of her own conscience and the right 
of any person to speak his or her mind are threads inextricably interwoven in 
the fabric of individual liberty. Pull one such thread away and the entire 
fabric frays to rags, leaving us all to shiver in the cold wind of tyranny.

HANDS ACROSS THE BORDER AT BARNSDALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINE McKENNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"L.A./Brazil Projects '90," an art exhibition on view at the Municipal Art 
Gallery at Barnsdall Park through April 29, is an exercise in cultural exchange 
that inadvertently suggests that when it comes to art, the world is a tiny 
global village. A group show that juxtaposes recent work by eight Brazilian 
artists with pieces by eight prominent Los Angeles artists, "L.A./Brazil 
Projects '90" reveals that all over the world (or at least in Brazil and 
America), artists are trudging the same path, obeying the same road signs and 
regulations, and paying homage to the same modernist saints as they inch 
towards immortality. 
</P>
<P>
Jointly curated by Brazilian art critic Sheila Leirner who selected the 
Brazilian participants, and Municipal Gallery curator Ed Leffingwell, and 
director of the Frederick R. Weisman Art Foundation Henry T. Hopkins, who 
picked the American artists, the show purports to be an inquiry into "painterly 
painting," however it veers off that track on several occasions. The thing that 
really unites the work is its reverence for European art of the 20th Century. 
In her gushingly wet catalogue essay, curator Leirner explains that "the issues 
and styles introduced by artists such as Duchamp, De Chirico and Malevich are 
the concerns of the new generation of Brazilian artists" -- and that's 
immediately evident in this rather conservative work. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly every artist in the show, in fact, cites Duchamp as a primary influence 
and the rigorous intellectualism of the high priest of Modernism is clearly 
apparent here. Proposing that the point isn't to reshape the world into art, 
but rather, to retool the mind into a machine capable of perceiving the art in 
everything, Duchamp left an indelible mark on the art of this century, and his 
presence hovers like a benevolent ghost over "L.A./Brazil Projects '90." 
Benevolent, but a bit intimidating. It's clear by their work that these artists 
are steeped in history, and the struggle to remain in touch with ones instincts 
in the face of intellectual and historical self-consciousness is a leitmotif in 
the show. 
</P>
<P>
One hates to reveal a regional bias, but the strongest work in the show does 
hale from California, and three luscious field paintings by Joe Goode take top 
honors. Resonating with weight and authority, these canvases are freighted with 
a purity of form, surface, and color evocative of the best work of Jasper 
Johns. Two paintings by Nelsen Valentine -- one of a cloudy night sky, the 
other of the same sky by day -- exude a lyrical serenity that comes as a 
welcome tonic, surrounded as they are by explosive Expressionist canvases 
wildly waving their arms for attention. Metaphysical landscapes evocative of 
early work by Vija Celmins, the work of this young painter (Valentine is just 
29) shows great promise. 
</P>
<P>
Jill Giegerich shows mixed media works incorporating construction materials she 
first encountered as a child in her father's workshop, while David Amico (who 
describes his work as "a quest for freedom") offers staunchly traditional 
figurative abstractions. John Millei shows an untitled installation that 
involves dozens of small paintings on tin of various shape and size (they 
resemble Mexican retablos), installed salon style on a large wall. Millei sees 
himself as a mannerist, and this piece -- rife with references to art history 
-- is mannered indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Herman shows loosely painted Expressionist canvases depicting the facades 
of sterile modern buildings. In the catalogue text, Herman explains that he 
strives to be uninvolved with the images he depicts, and goes on to announce 
with pride that after years of practice he's succeeded in emptying his work of 
emotion. I guess this is sort of like grooving to the rhythm of a song rather 
than the words. Herman also comments that he sees his work as a reaction 
against the freeze-dried intellectualization of art, but his work looks pretty 
freeze-dried to me. Pauline Stella Sanchez explains her mixed media wall 
sculptures as "an attempt to demystify the heroism of painting," but me thinks 
she doth protest too much. With the scandalous prices going down at the auction 
houses and so forth, neither art nor artists have been receiving very good 
press lately, and it's highly debatable whether anybody considers painting a 
heroic activity. 
</P>
<P>
Sergio S.T. Romagnolo shows sculptural works made of molded plastic that give 
off a rank stench of decay evocative of work by New York artist Izhar Patkin. 
Like tacky figurines left out in the sun too long, these melted pieces are 
really creepy. Jorge Guinle shows explosive Abstract Expressionist canvases 
that, for all their bluster, reek of nostalgia; this style of painting -- at 
least in Guinle's hands -- seems wan and spent. Nonetheless, curator Leirner 
describes Guinle's work as "a colored handbook of Freudian Angst." Oh dear. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Roberto Aguilar shows stunning figurative abstractions based on Dante's 
"Nine Visions of Paradise" that pulsate with the wild, cosmic humanism of A.R. 
Penck. Antonio Dias shows formalist mixed media works made of graphite, rubber 
and wood on canvas, while Flavia Ribeiro shows minimalist field paintings of 
asphalt and encaustic on canvas. Ribeiro's handsome canvases explore the same 
issues that occupy Joe Goode, and the work of these two artists complements 
each other nicely. This is the one instance where the shows hands across the 
border theme really coalesces.

SAKAMOTO'S 'NEO GEO' FEELING DISAPPEARS AT PALACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When composer/actor/pianist Ryuichi Sakamoto was writing portions of the score 
of "The Last Emperor," director Bernardo Bertolucci kept telling him to give it 
"more feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Bertolucci should have been around for Sakamoto's performance at the Palace on 
Monday to offer similar advice. 
</P>
<P>
Sakamoto's eight-piece ensemble devoted most of the program to a reading of the 
music from his new album "Beauty." But the energy, subtlety and feeling of the 
record virtually disappeared in the cavernous, reverberating sound of the 
Palace. 
</P>
<P>
Interesting moments surfaced from time to time: "You Do Me" managed to generate 
some rhythmic vigor, and Sakamoto's solo piano work revealed some provocatively 
dissonant (if oddly disconnected) harmonic ideas. Three vocalists added piquant 
touches of Japanese classical-style singing, especially on "Calling From 
Tokyo." 
</P>
<P>
"Rose," however, one of the album's best tracks, wilted in the mushy sound, 
with Sakamoto's singing a virtual monotone. And keyboardist/singer Nicky 
Holland's efforts to cover the R&amp;B aspects of the music lacked the spirit 
and vitality of the album's Jill Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Sakamoto describes his current creative efforts -- a melange of Japanese pop, 
American rock, jazz, contemporary classical music, R&amp;B and various 
world-music sounds -- as "Neo Geo." Monday's program suggested that he's 
managed to get most of the musical elements in place. But Neo Geo still sounds 
like a recipe that's light on soul. DON HECKMAN

A MUTT-LIKE MIX FROM LES NEGRESSES VERTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
We're getting hit by bands from all over these days -- Eastern Europe, Brazil, 
Africa -- with most making at least minimal concessions to the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
Not Les Negresses Vertes. 
</P>
<P>
When the Paris-based folk-punk aggregation played at the Roxy on Sunday, the 
only attempts to communicate directly with the Hollywood crowd were sweaty 
singer Helno explaining his condition ("It's hot!") and another band member 
stating a curt "Thank you very much" at the show's conclusion. Otherwise it was 
parlez en Francais all the way. 
</P>
<P>
For those who parlez only un peu de Francais: Yes, the name translates as the 
nonsensical "the Green Black Women" (of the 11 people on stage there were two 
women, but no one who appeared green or black). The music is a similarly 
mutt-like mix -- a vibrant, willfully sloppy melange of Franco-Gypsy and 
Algerian styles played on mostly acoustic instruments, but with a rock 'n' roll 
attitude. 
</P>
<P>
So if the music is sort of the Pogues meet the Gipsy Kings, frontman Helno 
seemed like the Pogues' Shane MacGowan meets Charles Aznavour, with his ruffled 
lavender shirt and lounge parody manner, while the rest of the band mugged and 
clowned -- this is, after all, a band that was started by former circus 
musicians. 
</P>
<P>
But Les Negresses is no joke: This is life music, even more so in the spirited 
concert presentation than on the new album "Mlah." And that needed no 
translation. STEVE HOCHMAN

BRAZIL'S BOSCO BURSTS WITH CREATIVITY IN KICKOFF CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joao Bosco made a quick stop in town Saturday night. It was just long enough to 
provide a tantalizingly short sampling of the music of this extraordinary 
Brazilian singer/songwriter/guitarist. 
</P>
<P>
Bosco and the instrumental group Uakti appeared at the Los Angeles Municipal 
Art Gallery in Barnsdall Park for the kickoff of "L.A./Brazil Projects '90," a 
series of events designed to showcase Brazilian music and art in the United 
States, Japan and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
Although he is one of the most important artists in the post-bossa nova MPB 
(musica popular brasileira) period of Brazilian music, Bosco has had little 
visibility in this country. It's hard to understand why. His performance was a 
virtual one-man explosion of creativity. 
</P>
<P>
Working only with his guitar, his voice and the sheer magnetism of his physical 
presence, Bosco performed a set that mixed his provocative originals (mostly 
written with lyricist Aldir Blanc) with fascinating readings of " 'Round 
Midnight" and "Bahia." His guitar figures ranged from hypnotically repetitious 
patterns to lushly harmonized chording, while his singing managed to 
incorporate percussive pops, squeals and shouts with romantic balladeering. 
</P>
<P>
The total effect was stunningly rich and inventive -- music that reached out to 
touch both the mind and the body. 
</P>
<P>
Uakti, a group from the eastern Brazilian state of Minas Gerais who appear on 
Paul Simon's newest recording, played a colorful array of instruments handmade 
from plastic tubing, gourds, bamboo, rubber and wood. Many of their pieces 
reverberated with the sounds of jungle and forest. Perhaps most fascinating, 
however, was Uakti's whimsical reading of Ravel's "Bolero," performed on a 
metal pot and a collection of gourds floating in basins of water. 
</P>
<P>
Uakti will appear April 1 at Le Cafe in Sherman Oaks.DON HECKMAN

SILVER, LINDROTH PREMIERES AT JAPAN AMERICA THEATRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fresh hope, the kind of optimism associated with the advent of spring, rose 
again at the latest event by the Los Angeles Philharmonic's New Music Group 
Monday night at Japan America Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
And, appropriately on the eve of a change of seasons, that optimism was not 
misplaced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Five works by North American composers, works dating from 1974 to 1990, were 
heard, three of them utilizing instrumental ensembles numbering over 20 
players. And all five gave pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
Most engaging was the piece receiving its world premiere performance, Sheila 
Silver's "Dance of Wild Angels," a 17-minute, tuneful, motif-laden work of easy 
and old-fashioned accessibility. 
</P>
<P>
Closer inspection, i.e., further hearings, may reveal esoteric or crafty inner 
goings on in this composition; a first encounter gleaned surface charms hard to 
resist. David Alan Miller led 21 well-employed players. 
</P>
<P>
At one-third the length of Silver's piece, and using only half the players, 
Lindroth's "Stomp" (1988) accomplishes similar fascination. It is a work of 
apparent perpetual motion, moving along steadily and sometimes irritatingly. At 
times it becomes noisy; at no time is it not percussive and colored by seeming 
belligerence. But it stops short of causing hostility in the listener. Jacob 
Druckman, the other conductor on this program, led a punchy performance. 
</P>
<P>
Druckman's own "Lamia," a dramatic essay for singer and a large body of 
instruments, ended this program in an energetic, compulsive manner. Mixing 
texts -- words dealing with witchcraft -- in several languages, the 19-minute 
piece boldly describes a world of magic and incantation in a rich musical 
vocabulary. Mezzo-soprano Nancy Assaf was the assured soloist. 
</P>
<P>
With the composer present, Michael Daugherty's "Snap!" a pops-derived, eclectic 
confection of real complexity yet simple profile, opened the evening in a 
hyperactive way. 
</P>
<P>
The small item here, Rand Steiger's "ReSonata" for cello and piano, did not 
suffer in this company. Merely eight minutes in length, it represents one part 
of a projected, three-movement work. If the rest turns out this tight and 
compelling, the total will command attention. Cellist Gloria Lum and pianist 
Gloria Cheng were the authoritative protagonists.

100 CHEVRON WORKERS FACE LAYOFFS, TRANSFERS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: RESTRICTIONS ON OFFSHORE OIL PLATFORMS PROMPT THE COMPANY TO MOVE 
ITS REGIONAL HEADQUARTERS TO BAKERSFIELD, WHERE MANY WORKERS WILL BE RELOCATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Unhappy with restrictions on offshore oil platforms, Chevron officials are 
moving forward with plans to lay off or transfer half the company's 200 
employees in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those facing transfers may be relocated at a new regional headquarters 
being set up in Bakersfield, company officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron spokesman Mike Marcy said the move from Ventura County has been 
prompted by regulatory hurdles imposed on Chevron by Santa Barbara County and a 
realization that offshore oil production in Southern California is unpopular 
with politicians and the public. 
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult for any politician to say they are in favor of ongoing oil 
production, let alone future development," Marcy said. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron's Ventura County employees will learn in May whether they will be asked 
to move, stay in Ventura or find new jobs, Marcy said. He added that the 
company's plans include consolidating three offices in the city of Ventura into 
one, which would employ 100 or so workers who would remain in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"Just like everybody else, I have no idea what the future holds for me," Marcy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Chevron broke ground on what was to be an $18.5-million building 
for its Ventura County employees. But in November, it abandoned those plans and 
instead will let the leases run out on two of its three buildings in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron owns the building on County Square Road in which the remaining 100 
employees will work. 
</P>
<P>
For Ventura County employees, news of the layoffs came as no surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Many Chevron employees who spoke with The Times said they are waiting to hear 
their fates with mixed emotions. They said they will miss the climate but not 
the political atmosphere of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not so much if, as when. It just comes down to the fact that Southern 
Californians don't like oil wells; they just like gas pumps," said Tim Cooper, 
a gas process specialist. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the positive aspects about moving to Bakersfield is that the cost of 
living is lower, and it is a friendlier environment," Cooper added. 
</P>
<P>
"There are other areas of the world where oil is people's bread and butter; 
it's considered as respectable as any job," said 1engineer Fred Brownlee. 
</P>
<P>
Electrical engineer Susan Trunnelle said she is confident that she will keep 
her job with the company, whether in Ventura or Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand it's hot there, but it's an adventure to live somewhere else," 
she said. She and her fiance, who also works for Chevron, are ready to go 
wherever they are sent, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The cutbacks in Ventura County are part of a company restructuring announced in 
February that will eliminate 800 to 1,000 jobs, or 10% to 12% of the company's 
U.S. exploration and production forces, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
The company's failure to date with the Point Arguello project off the coast of 
Santa Barbara illustrates the industry's frustrations, Marcy said. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1979, Chevron has sunk $2.2 billion into the project, which includes two 
never-used Chevron offshore platforms and an onshore processing plant at 
Gaviota. 
</P>
<P>
Permit problems developed when the oil that was to be shipped ashore by 
pipeline contained too high a content of toxic hydrogen sulfide, said Lauren 
Urbias, Santa Barbara County planner. 
</P>
<P>
To date, Chevron has been unable to work out a method of allowing oil to be 
piped ashore that is acceptable to Santa Barbara officials. The company, in the 
interim, has applied for a permit from the county to use oil tankers to bring 
the oil to the Gaviota plant, and then on to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara County is writing a supplemental environmental impact review 
statement on the issue. Urbias expects the process to be complete by November. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chevron has not produced oil from its platforms. The employees 
brought to Ventura County to work on Point Arguello and other projects are 
being transferred, Marcy said. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact of the matter is that offshore development has been made so untenable 
by local governments that the oil industry is withering away on the West 
Coast," Marcy said. "We know the public expects a risk-free environment and 
unfortunately, we cannot guarantee that."

POINT MUGU'S PLAN TO CLEAR AIR LEAVES SOME SMOKERS IN A HUFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
Beginning April 1, the Pacific Missile Test Center at Point Mugu will implement 
a smoking ban in most indoor areas at the base -- a prospect that has some 
employees fuming. 
</P>
<P>
"I respect other people's wishes, and I am considerate of nonsmokers," said 
Sheila Lloyd, a civilian resource assistant at Point Mugu. "But I think some of 
this is going too far." 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd, 51, said that rather than force people to go outside to smoke, the base 
should provide designated smoking rooms so that employees can be close to their 
work space and be protected from extreme weather conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see where we bother those people that don't smoke," Lloyd said. "But I 
think if we take the time and the effort to cooperate so that their work area 
and the air they breathe is clean, then they should at least make concessions 
for us, so that we can have a place to go other than outside. It's just like 
being treated like a leper." 
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted last year of 5,000 civilian and U.S. Navy personnel at the 
base, including Rear Adm. George H. Strohsahl, a nonsmoker, showed overwhelming 
support for the ban, said Bob Hubbard, a Point Mugu spokesman. The base employs 
about 9,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard said a committee was formed in August to look into the possibility of 
implementing a ban after a number of supervisors reported complaints about 
smokers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to consider the health of others," Hubbard said. "If one employee 
says, 'I can't work because of smoke,' that employee has to be accommodated." 
</P>
<P>
Many areas at the base -- including sophisticated computer and engineering labs 
as well as restaurants and clubs -- have long had smoking restrictions in 
place, Hubbard said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the ban, smoking will only be permitted in living quarters and designated 
smoking areas in restaurants and clubs, Hubbard said. 
</P>
<P>
"What you do on your own time is your business," Hubbard said. "What you do 
that affects others in an office environment is our business." 
</P>
<P>
Although reactions about the ban have been mixed, Marge Hays is one civilian 
employee at the base who is overjoyed with the new policy. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it," said Hays, who suffers from chronic sinus problems that are 
compounded by cigarette smoke. "I was just relieved to see it happen." 
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old office clerk said she previously served at air stations in 
Alaska and Washington where smoking was not permitted and "just assumed" that 
there was a similar policy in place when she arrived at Point Mugu in August. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I ever considered how important it was until I came here," said 
Hays, who had to share her office with a smoker. 
</P>
<P>
After enduring months of headaches, a runny nose and sore throats, she finally 
complained to her supervisor and the smoking stopped. Her colleague now goes 
outside when she wants to light up. 
</P>
<P>
The smoking restriction put a strain on her relationship with her co-worker, 
Hays said, but she had no choice but to complain. 
</P>
<P>
"My basic theory was that her cigarette smoke made me sick," Hays said, "and 
I'm using my sick leave in support of her habit." 
</P>
<P>
Many Point Mugu smokers interviewed recently empathized with nonsmokers, such 
as Hays, and said they supported the ban. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a good idea," said Bradley Oberg, a 23-year-old sailor. "I don't 
think it's fair to make other people breathe your secondhand smoke." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a nasty, dirty habit," said Oberg, who has been smoking since he was 
about 13. "If you want to do something that has obviously been proven to be bad 
for you, I don't think it should be promoted. I think it should be 
discouraged." 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd, who has been smoking for 30 years, said she has tried many times to quit 
smoking. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll quit and go for two months, and I'll say I can't take it anymore," Lloyd 
said. "It's a crutch, but it makes me feel better to know that that cigarette 
is burning. For a nonsmoker, it's hard . . . they just can't understand." 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd said the ban will be hard on some of her colleagues as well, particularly 
one man who likes to smoke in his office. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll probably be climbing the walls or move his desk outside," she said, 
laughing. 
</P>
<P>
For those who see the ban as an opportunity to quit smoking altogether, there 
is help. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-smoking clinics are held on the base every three months, with the next 
scheduled April 3, said Dave Talley, one of three clinic instructors. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been getting a lot of calls from people wanting to get in the clinics 
since word has spread about the ban," Talley said. 
</P>
<P>
About 70% to 80% of the people who attend the classes, held during lunch break, 
are able to quit, Talley said.

IMPROVEMENT PLAN FOCUSES ON ROADS, WATER, NEW POOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The Ventura City Council has approved a six-year, $104-million program to 
improve roads, build a swimming pool complex, identify new sources of 
freshwater and build barbecue areas in city parks. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 residents, including dozens of schoolchildren, attended a Monday 
public hearing to voice support for the swimming pool complex. 
</P>
<P>
As debates on other items pushed the council meeting past 10 p.m., Mayor 
Richard Francis conducted an impromptu, informal vote on the swimming pool 
issue so that the children in the audience would not have to stay up too late. 
</P>
<P>
Amid loud applause, all seven council members said they supported the concept 
in principle, four of them without reservations. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, the children and their smiling guardians paraded triumphantly 
out of the auditorium, leaving a dozen or so council watchers to witness the 
final debate. 
</P>
<P>
But little discussion followed. After City Manager John Baker made his 
recommendations -- and a few speakers lobbied for their pet projects -- the 
council quickly proceeded to approve the city staff's program without changes. 
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for more than one-third of the capital improvement funds -- 
$37.5 million through 1996 -- to be spent on road improvements and traffic 
mitigation programs. About $6.7 million is earmarked for widening the Santa 
Paula Freeway overpass at Kimball Road, and another $3 million on nine traffic 
improvement and signal projects. 
</P>
<P>
Water projects account for $17.3 million, much of which will go to studies and 
projects to help Ventura deal with its water shortage as it enters the fourth 
year of a severe drought. 
</P>
<P>
About $600,000 will be spent on a feasibility study for construction of a 
pipeline to bring state-owned water from Northern California; $150,000 to study 
new freshwater sources and $2.5 million to be spent on a new well in Saticoy. 
The city is completing construction of one well in that area at a cost of $3.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Sewer improvements account for $4.5 million in expenditures, including $550,000 
for odor-control covers, $600,000 for sewer line replacements and $100,000 on a 
study to expand the use of treated sewage water for irrigation. 
</P>
<P>
The Parks and Recreation Department would receive about $10 million. Most of 
the funds would be used for construction of the swimming pool complex, 
including a 25-meter indoor pool and a 50-meter outdoor pool. The city has yet 
to identify a site for the project. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Cathy Bean and Todd Collart expressed reservations about 
building the swimming pools during the water crisis, but three speakers at the 
hearing said the pools would have to be filled only once every five to 10 years 
as long as they are continually cleaned and maintained. 
</P>
<P>
More money would be spent on improvements to playgrounds, parks and parking 
lots, including $450,000 for barbecue areas at three city parks -- Arroyo 
Verde, Camino Rio and Grant. 
</P>
<P>
Another $2.8 million would be spent on renovations at the city's two public 
golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
Capital Improvement Program Coordinator Barbara Fosbrink said the program in 
part shows "the council's high priority of expanding the inner city greenbelt 
and preserving open space." 
</P>
<P>
The plan also reflects the need to create a climate that facilitates the growth 
of local businesses, which provide the bulk of the city's revenues, Fosbrink 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't start bankrupting your ability to do business," she said. "We have 
to balance our natural resources with our financial resources."

STABBING VICTIM REFUSES TO COOPERATE

A man who was stabbed as he apparently attempted to break up an armed robbery 
in a Santa Paula park has refused to cooperate with authorities, police said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Robles, 40, was listed in stable condition at Santa Paula Memorial 
Hospital Tuesday after he was stabbed about 5 p.m. Monday at Veterans Park at 
100 S. Mill St. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula police said Robles apparently tried to stop a robbery attempt in 
which several people, one armed with a handgun, had confronted James Fuller, 
39. Robles was stabbed and Fuller received a minor abdominal injury. The 
suspects fled on foot. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Servin, 25, of Santa Paula was arrested and booked for robbery and 
assault with a deadly weapon. Police said further arrests and prosecution have 
been hindered by lack of cooperation from the participants in the altercation, 
including Robles. 
</P>
<P>
"The parties directly involved know what's going on, but they won't tell us 
anything," said Cmdr. Bob Gonzales of the Santa Paula Police Department. 
</P>

Police said the park is used regularly for narcotics transactions. Fuller made 
a statement to police but did not identify any of the suspects, Gonzales said, 
and Robles has said "very little." 
</P>
<P>
The detective investigating the case, Sgt. Mike Saviers, said that Robles 
apparently approached the altercation and shouted at the robbers to leave 
Fuller alone, and that he "got stabbed for his efforts."

"We're not really sure we're getting the whole story," Gonzales said. CAROL

AUXILIARY BISHOPS APPOINTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Camarillo priest has been named one of two new auxiliary bishops of the 
sprawling Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, Archbishop Roger Mahony 
announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Monsignor Sylvester D. Ryan, 59, rector of St. John's Seminary College in 
Camarillo, was appointed bishop by Pope John Paul II, along with Monsignor 
Stephen Blair, the moderator of the curia and chancellor of the Los Angeles 
Archdiocese, who will remain in that position. Ryan said he was overwhelmed. 
"It's a big responsibility," he said. "Also, it was not in my plans." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan said he had planned to go back to being a parish priest before the 
appointment, which will make him the new director of the archdiocese's 
Secretariat for Church Ministerial Services. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony said the additions reflect the Pope's recognition of the growth of the 
archdiocese, which is home to about 3.5 million Catholics and sprawls over 
8,762 square miles of Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. 
</P>
<P>
"There are new parishes to be added," Mahony said. "There is going to be plenty 
of work for us for some time." 
</P>
<P>
Mahony said Ryan will work with him to add impetus to vocational efforts and 
direct the archdiocese's three seminaries. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a different kind of mind set," Ryan said. "I will be working with Our 
Lady Queen of Angels, St. John's Seminary College and St. John's Seminary 
Theology." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, who has been with St. John's Seminary College for more than four years 
and will officially end his duties as rector there when he is appointed bishop 
May 31 at St. Vibiana's Cathedral, said he does not believe his absence as 
rector will be detrimental to the seminary. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan said his successor, Father Rafael Luevano, is "very capable and will do an 
outstanding job." 
</P>
<P>
As for the new responsibilities he will undertake, Ryan said some of his work 
will be the "enabling of young men interested in the priesthood" and that he 
would also be working with the multi-ethnic community. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan said his new position will also require a move to the Los Angeles area so 
he can have access to the seminaries. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the archdiocese in Los Angeles said the appointments are part of a 
complex and confidential process that involves the archbishop and other bishops 
who send their recommendations to Rome. The Pope makes the final decision. JEFF

BELEAGUERED DEFENSE FIRM SOLD, TO LEAVE SANTA CLARITA; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: SOS'S DECLINE STEMS FROM ITS 1984 CONVICTION FOR ILLEGALLY DUMPING 
TOXIC CHEMICALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Space Ordnance Systems, the troubled Santa Clarita Valley defense contractor 
that was convicted of illegally dumping toxic chemicals, has been sold to an 
Arizona firm and will relocate to Phoenix sometime this year. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with TransTechnology Corp., the parent company of SOS, traced the 
firm's decline and eventual sale to the discovery of tainted soil and water at 
two Santa Clarita Valley plants in 1984 and the ensuing controversy and expense 
surrounding the cleanup of the plants. 
</P>
<P>
"We have never really been able to overcome the environmental problems that we 
had," Burl Alison, a TransTechnology vice president, said Tuesday. "It just 
hurt for a lot of years." 
</P>
<P>
Disclosures of the illegal dumping caused annual company revenues to fall from 
$30 million in 1984 to $9 million today, Alison said. The company, which once 
employed 400 workers, now has 67 employees. 
</P>
<P>
SOS was purchased at an undisclosed price by Universal Propulsion Co. of 
Phoenix. The purchase, announced Monday, becomes effective May 31. SOS, which 
moved to the Santa Clarita Valley from El Segundo in 1967, produced flares and 
explosive devices used in the aerospace and defense industries. 
</P>
<P>
The sale marks another chapter in one of the more bitter and controversial 
episodes in the Santa Clarita Valley in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
The problems at SOS produced tumultuous public hearings attended by hundreds of 
valley residents, lawsuits against the company by homeowners living near the 
plants and accusations that the toxic chemicals had caused four cancer deaths 
in one family. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy began in March, 1984, when health and law enforcement officers 
raided the company's two plants in Placerita and Mint canyons during an 
investigation of hazardous waste violations. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators found that SOS had improperly stored 1,000 barrels of waste and 
illegally disposed of water tainted by solvents, dumping it into creek beds and 
spraying it from sprinklers. 
</P>
<P>
SOS paid fines of $300,000 for misdemeanor violations of hazardous waste rules, 
and two company executives served brief jail terms. 
</P>
<P>
SOS suspended operations for two years as it tried to comply with a state order 
to clean up contaminated water and soil, Alison said. The principal contaminant 
in ground water was trichloroethylene, a solvent used to degrease metal and a 
suspected carcinogen. 
</P>
<P>
Universal Propulsion is offering workers a chance to move to Phoenix and some 
have already agreed to relocate, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The cleanup, which cost about $1.5 million, is virtually complete, Alison said. 
SOS will continue to monitor conditions at the sites for many years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Mint Canyon plant, near Agua Dulce, was closed last year because the 
company's flare business had fallen off. The Placerita Canyon plant, which is 
still in operation, is east of the Antelope Valley Freeway near Sand Canyon, 
where Tudor mansions and Arabian horse ranches are commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
TransTechnology leased the Placerita Canyon site from Special Devices Inc., 
another defense contractor. Tom Treinen, president of Special Devices, said it 
was too soon to say how the site will be used. 
</P>
<P>
Residents living near the plants lambasted SOS after the raids. But over time, 
members of a citizens committee that helped develop the cleanup plan conceded 
that the company had responded to the committee's complaints. 
</P>
<P>
A new controversy over SOS erupted last June when a family living about a mile 
from the Placerita Canyon plant charged that toxic chemicals had led to four 
cancer deaths in the family since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
State and Los Angeles County health officials said there was no evidence to 
back up the allegations, but federal investigators affiliated with the Centers 
for Disease Control in Atlanta are now reviewing earlier studies on the 
potential hazards of the contamination in Placerita Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
A series of lawsuits filed against SOS by residents living near the plants were 
settled out of court this year. Terms of the settlements were not disclosed.

DISCOUNT BROKER'S $15,000 SETTLEMENT UPHELD BY COURT; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: A BROKER WINS A COURT ORDER THAT PAYS HER DAMAGES AND BARS ANOTHER 
BROKER FROM TREATING HER UNFAIRLY BECAUSE OF HER DISCOUNT RATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Santa Clarita Valley real estate broker has won a court order against another 
broker she had accused of blacklisting her firm for its discount rates, 
refusing to pay her agents market rates on shared property sales. 
</P>
<P>
In a ruling Monday, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge David Workman upheld an 
out-of-court settlement reached last month between discount broker Jeannette 
Sharar and the broker she accused in the state antitrust lawsuit, Marcia 
Gaskill, owner of two Realty World franchises. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement orders Gaskill to pay Sharar $15,255 in damages and barred 
Gaskill's firms from treating Sharar or her agents differently than others in 
the business, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
Sharar's attorney, Marvin G. Claitman of Encino, called the ruling a victory 
for consumers and discount brokers. Sharar's firm, Sharar Associates, 
advertised 2% commissions instead of the standard 6%. 
</P>
<P>
Claitman said the ruling "puts a stop to a practice that we felt was 
retaliatory. The primary goal was not a matter of recovering monetary damages 
but trying to put a stop to the discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Gaskill declined comment and Gaskill's attorney, David L. 
Candeaux of Encino, could not be reached Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The case, filed in January, 1989, claimed Gaskill's firms -- Valencia Homes 
Inc. and Cheyenne Properties Inc. -- offered Sharar's agents what industry 
calls "punitive splits," or a lower commission than generally extended in 
shared sales. For example, Sharar claimed, her agents were offered 1% 
commissions although most others would be offered a 3% fee. 
</P>
<P>
Sharar, a Santa Clarita planning commissioner, argued that the lower 
commissions not only discriminated against her firm for its discounts, but also 
discouraged other brokers from following her example. 
</P>
<P>
Although industry representatives contended that 6% commissions are no longer 
prevalent in today's competitive market, consumer advocates agreed with Sharar, 
saying most real estate brokers remained resistant to cutting their fees. 
</P>
<P>
The case was settled out of court last month. But Sharar's appearance on a Feb. 
18 radio talk show prompted Gaskill to claim that the terms of their agreement 
had been improperly disclosed and she refused to comply with the settlement, 
Claitman said. 
</P>
<P>
In a hearing Monday, Workman said he had listened to a tape recording of the 
radio program and found no violation of the Feb. 16 settlement agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Claitman said he and Candeaux were still working out the final language of the 
judgment, which has yet to be signed by the judge and become official.

BANK IN VALENCIA WILL BE PURCHASED BY SECURITY PACIFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Security Pacific Corp. said Tuesday it agreed to pay $52.5 million in stock to 
buy Santa Clarita National Bank, giving it a foothold in one of Southern 
California's fastest-growing areas. 
</P>
<P>
The Valencia bank is the second small to medium-sized institution in the area 
to be acquired recently by one of the state's largest banks. In January, Wells 
Fargo &amp; Co., the San Francisco-based parent of Wells Fargo Bank, acquired 
Valley National Bank in Glendale for about $55 million. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo and Security Pacific, which is based in Los Angeles, are 
aggressively buying smaller banks to expand in areas where their presence is 
thinnest. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clarita has five branches in the Santa Clarita Valley and six in the San 
Fernando Valley. The bank is considered by banking officials to have the 
largest market share in the Santa Clarita Valley, where Security Pacific has 
three branches now. Santa Clarita National earned $4.2 million during 1989 and 
had $258.2 million in assets. 
</P>
<P>
Jim McDevitt, Santa Clarita's executive vice president, said "there is no talk 
of layoffs" as a result of the merger. Santa Clarita has 285 employees, about 
50 of whom work in its headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is headquartered in the fast-growing Santa Clarita Valley, the bank 
has succeeded by concentrating on loans to small and medium-sized business, not 
home mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
The price Security Pacific is paying comes to 2.3 times Santa Clarita's fully 
diluted book value, a measurement calculated by deducting an institution's 
liabilities from total assets. While that is considered a healthy price, it is 
below many of the recent acquisitions of medium-sized banks, which typically 
have sold for 2.5 times their book value or higher. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition must be approved by regulators and Santa Clarita shareholders. 
Security Pacific said it expects to issue as part of the sale from 1.1 million 
to 1.5 million shares, an amount that will be determined according to Security 
Pacific's average stock price prior to the date the sale closes. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific is the fifth-largest banking company in the United States, 
with more than $84 billion in assets. Its main subsidiary, Security Pacific 
National Bank, is the second-largest bank in California and has 557 branches.

VENTURA BLVD. MERCHANTS DIVIDED ON ROAD-TAX PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several property owners and merchants along Ventura Boulevard gave mixed 
reviews Tuesday to a proposal that could require all commercial property owners 
to pay a special street-improvements tax to alleviate traffic congestion along 
the busy street. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, Los Angeles city planners had recommended that developers of 
projects along the boulevard pay for improvements designed to reduce traffic. 
But on Monday, planners released a revised version of the specific plan that 
called on all property owners to share the cost of the improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Austin, a financial consultant who heads a group of small business 
owners, said many property owners would resist such an assessment fee because 
much of the traffic is caused by motorists who are not doing business on 
Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not fair to assess property owners to widen the street so that 
long-distance commuters can use it to get over the hill into Los Angeles," 
Austin said. 
</P>
<P>
Ranee Spina, the manager of a Studio City clothing store called Urban Art, said 
the fee would result in higher rents, which would force her to raise her 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
But other business owners felt the fee was needed. "We need to have a program 
like this, because without it, the streets will be gridlocked," said Bill 
Hirsty, the owner of Studio City Volvo and Studio City Saab. "I was upset about 
it at first, but we've got to do it for everyone in the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Reznik, the owner of an office building in Encino and an attorney for 
several developers, said he supported the assessment district. 
</P>
<P>
"I approve of it, but whether it's politically feasible is another matter," 
Reznik said. "However, as a property owner, I think it's only fair that those 
of us who are here and helped create this traffic should pay to make the street 
run smoother." 
</P>
<P>
The concept of imposing developer fees on new projects -- which the Planning 
Department originally proposed as part of an overall plan to control growth 
along Ventura Boulevard -- had to be sharply revised because the department 
would have faced legal challenges, officials said. The city attorney's office 
had warned that developers could only be assessed fees to mitigate traffic 
problems directly related to their projects. 
</P>
<P>
The revised plan is scheduled to be reviewed by the city's Planning Commission 
on Thursday. The plan faces final approval by the City Council as well. Setting 
up an assessment district would require a two-thirds vote of the 15-member City 
Council. That action, however, could be blocked by a majority of the affected 
property owners. 
</P>
<P>
Projects to prevent gridlock on Ventura Boulevard would include widening 30 
intersections to permit right- and left-turn lanes and installing a 
computerized traffic signal system.

TEACHERS REJECT CONTRACT SETTLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura teachers have rejected a tentative contract settlement, primarily 
because they don't want to pay for retired teachers' medical benefits, union 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
John Gennaro, a spokesman for the Ventura Unified Educators Assn., said a straw 
poll of the Ventura Unified School District's more than 600 teachers last week 
showed that about 75% opposed a tentative three-year contract worked out early 
this month by the district and union. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement called for the district to stop paying for the benefits, which 
last year cost $885,000, said Richard Averett, the district's negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
Under the tentative agreement, the cost of medical, dental and vision benefits 
for teachers over age 65 would have come from funds now used to pay teachers' 
salaries, benefits and unemployment insurance, Gennaro said. The money for the 
retirees' benefits would have come from the teachers' 58% share of general fund 
revenues of about $25 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
School district and union officials said negotiations will resume later this 
month. The previous contract expired June 30. TRACEY KAPLAN

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL OKS TEMPLE AFTER OPPONENTS REACH 
COMPROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles City Council panel approved plans Tuesday for a temple and school 
in Woodland Hills after Councilwoman Joy Picus helped reach a compromise to end 
a feud between the congregation and residents worried about traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise appears to end the three-year dispute over the plans of Temple 
Shir Chadash to build a 450-seat temple, a 750-seat social hall and a religious 
school for 300 children in the 19900 block of Topham Street, on 17.5 acres the 
temple leases from Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
After the agreement was disclosed, the council's Planning and Land Use 
Management Committee voted 2 to 0 to approve the project, which next goes to 
the full council. 
</P>
<P>
Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization Vice President Sy Spalter said his group 
got "most of everything we had wanted" under the compromise, worked out during 
the past week by Picus. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners have said they fear the temple's plans for its Pierce College 
property, which include a proposal to build 23 homes on the site, would dump 
more traffic on nearby residential streets. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Spalter said, his group got pledges from Picus to keep 
nearby Calvert Street one way; to review the possibility of making three 
adjacent residential streets cul-de-sacs; and to get the city to study 
neighborhood traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, however, permits the temple to have a membership of 600 "family 
units," 100 more than originally permitted by city zoning officials.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CRASH, DIESEL SPILL CLOSE FREEWAY 5 HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All northbound lanes of the Golden State Freeway in Burbank were closed for 
about five hours Tuesday after a semi-trailer truck struck a disabled tanker 
truck, rupturing it and spilling a small amount of diesel fuel, the California 
Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
There were only minor injuries. The truck crash occurred in the outside lane 
and shoulder of the freeway near the Alameda Avenue exit at 1:30 a.m., but 
about 60 gallons of diesel fuel spilled across all lanes, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
The lengthy closure occurred while the spill was cleaned up and the remaining 
9,000 gallons in the ruptured tank were pumped into another tanker truck, Sgt. 
Ron Ainsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
Ainsworth said the tanker truck was being driven by Cesar Ernesto Acuna of 
Norwalk, who tried to pull off the freeway after a tire blew out. The tanker 
truck could not completely fit on the shoulder and partially blocked the 
outside lane of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Ainsworth said Acuna went to the rear of the disabled truck in an effort to 
warn other motorists to go around it. But a semi-trailer rig driven by George 
F. Kilby of Nipomo was unable to stop in time and hit the rear corner of the 
tanker. Acuna was not injured. Kilby was treated at the scene by paramedics for 
minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The tank was ruptured and knocked off its rear axle, making it unsafe to move 
until the fuel was pumped out, Ainsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
CHP officers rerouted northbound traffic off the freeway at Western Avenue in 
Glendale and back on at Orange Grove Avenue in Burbank. All lanes of the 
freeway were reopened at about 6:30 a.m., but the CHP still reported a traffic 
backup of more than a mile before the opening. 
</P>
<P>
No one was cited in the accident, which remains under investigation, the CHP 
said.

A registered nurse convicted of hiring a co-worker to murder her roommate hired 
the same man seven years ago to attack another nurse so she could get the 
victim's job, the hired killer testified Tuesday in Van Nuys Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
James Flores Luna testified that Maureen McDermott offered him money to break 
DeWayne Bell's arm or leg so that Bell would be forced to give up his job as a 
private duty nurse. McDermott said she wanted the job, Luna said. 
</P>
<P>
Luna, 36, testified as a prosecution witness before a jury that convicted 
McDermott on March 2 of first-degree murder for hiring Luna to stab to death 
McDermott's roommate, Stephen Eldridge, in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The jury has the option of recommending a sentence of death or life in prison 
without parole. 
</P>
<P>
Until her arrest, McDermott, 42, of Van Nuys, was a nurse at County-USC Medical 
Center, where Luna was an orderly. 
</P>
<P>
Luna testified that McDermott told him she wanted Bell disabled so she could 
take over Bell's job as a private nurse for a stroke victim. 
</P>
<P>
Luna testified that he enlisted two accomplices and in April, 1983 attacked 
Bell at Bell's Van Nuys apartment. They were unprepared for Bell's size and 
strength, however. He could not break Bell's arm, so he slashed Bell's face and 
chest with a knife instead, Luna said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his injuries, Bell showed up for work the next day, Luna testified, and 
McDermott told Luna to make a series of anonymous threatening phone calls to 
the patient's home, which resulted in Bell being fired. McDermott then took his 
job, Luna testified. 
</P>
<P>
Luna, who pleaded guilty to both crimes in a deal with prosecutors that spared 
his life, testified during the trial that he was hired by McDermott to kill 
Eldridge so McDermott could collect a $100,000 mortgage insurance policy.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COHEN QUITS RACE FOR HIDDEN HILLS COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chairman of the Hidden Hills Planning Commission announced his withdrawal 
Tuesday from the town's City Council race, citing health reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Cohen, 56, said a back injury could prevent him from regularly attending 
council meetings if he were elected. 
</P>
<P>
"I am reluctant to take on a job that I physically may not be able to 
complete," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Chris K. Van Peski and incumbent council members Colleen M. Hartman and 
Warren H. McCament are seeking reelection in the city's April 10 election. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen had been among four challengers. He threw his support to the incumbents, 
who have backed a controversial development proposal for lower-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates Susan Norris Porcaro, David G. Stanley and Howard Klein are opposed 
to the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen's announcement comes too late to have his name removed from the ballot.

NEW TAX CALLED ANSWER TO LAYOFFS

<P>
The Beverly Hills school district has sent layoff notices to 60 teachers and 
other employees, prompting a community group to call on voters Tuesday to 
support a new property tax. The proposed parcel tax, if passed by voters in 
June, would generate $22 million for public schools over five years, enough to 
offset the lack of funds that threatens 48 full-time positions at the end of 
the school year and others in the future, school district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The district sent layoff notices last week to 60 employees, district 
spokeswoman Hali Wickner said. Districts are obligated to give several months' 
advance notice of possible layoffs and they routinely do so nearly every year 
in times of budget uncertainty. A community group of parents and activists, the 
Yes on Schools Committee, stepped up efforts Tuesday to rally support for the 
property tax.

Charges were filed Tuesday against a Long Beach attorney and an Orange County 
social worker, accusing them of conspiracy in a baby-selling scheme in which 
between $5,000 and $20,000 allegedly was offered to pregnant welfare recipients 
for newborns. The attorney, Ira M. Aspiz, 34, and the social worker, Youda 
Huor, 33, have agreed to appear in court April 13 for arraignment on the 
charges, which were filed in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Aspiz and Huor are each charged with two felony counts of conspiracy to offer 
payments to a parent for adoption, and one misdemeanor count of attempting to 
offer such payments. If convicted, each could receive a maximum prison sentence 
of three years and 8 months. Paul S. Meyer, Aspiz's attorney, said the charges 
were "grossly exaggerated."

NOTHING LEFT BUT PROBATION FOR MARYLAND 
</P>

The University of Maryland basketball team returned early Tuesday to a 
near-empty campus and an uncertain future. The season ended for the Terrapins 
Monday night at Penn State, with an 80-78 loss to the Nittany Lions in the 
second round of the National Invitation Tournament at Rec Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"This loss will eventually fade," said Maryland Coach Gary Williams. "And then 
they can think about all the positive things they accomplished this year." 
</P>
<P>
But as the reality of their 19-14 season sets in, so will the fact that the 
Terrapins are about to embark on three-years' probation from the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
Included in that probation is a two-year ban from postseason competition, 
beginning in 1990-91, and a one-season ban from live television appearances. 
Maryland also will be prohibited from playing in next year's Atlantic Coast 
Conference tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to go back and start talking about next year," Williams 
said. "We could have a pretty good team. We're going to have to replace Tony 
Massenburg. I think there are a lot of positives here for the other guys." 
</P>
<P>
The most significant other guys are sophomores Jerrod Mustaf and Walt Williams. 
Under NCAA rules, both players can play immediately if they transfer to other 
schools because the postseason ban runs through the remainder of their college 
eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
The first obstacle Maryland will have to overcome is getting the NCAA Executive 
Council to hear its appeal in April, rather than in August. David Berst, the 
NCAA's assistant executive director for enforcement, said Tuesday that the 
university would know by sometime next week if its appeal would be put on an 
already crowded agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mustaf and Williams will use their spring break to talk with their 
parents. Mustaf has given mixed signals, and Williams has not played his hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I get asked 100 times a day, 'What are you doing, Jerrod?' " said Mustaf, who 
finished as Maryland's top scorer and second-leading rebounder this season. 
"I'm just going to have to talk with my family and go from there." 
</P>
<P>
Said Walt Williams, "I haven't really thought about it while we were playing." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Williams plans to stress the development of both toward potential pro 
careers, as well as the fact that being from the area, the players can have 
their families watch a majority of their games. 
</P>
<P>
"They know what they have here, in terms of their roles, their minutes," 
Williams said. "Any time a player transfers, there's a lot of uncertainty. And 
they are in unique situations. Both have pro potential. They know how far their 
games have come this year." 
</P>
<P>
With less than a month left from the start of the spring signing period, 
Maryland also will find out how it stands with its recruits. The Terrapins have 
signed one player, 6-foot-7 forward John Leahy of Stone Harbor, N.J., and 
recently received an oral commitment from another, 6-7 forward Garfield Smith 
of Coffeyville (Kan.) Junior College. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the NCAA sanctions is a reduction from 15 scholarships to 13, meaning 
that Maryland has one scholarship available. After the sanctions were announced 
this month, Williams said they could cost the team a number of blue-chip 
recruits. 
</P>
<P>
But for now, Williams and his players would like to savor their season. 
Although it ended on a disappointing note, it turned out to be better than most 
had predicted. "If somebody said we would have won 19 games and would go to the 
NIT, they would have been laughed at," Williams said.

FORD SAYS IT PAID 5 TIMES FAIR VALUE FOR JAGUAR PLC

<P>
The price of Ford Motor Co.'s $2.5-billion acquisition of Jaguar PLC was five 
times the British car maker's actual net asset value, Ford disclosed in its 
annual report. 
</P>
<P>
The annual report, which was sent out March 19, said Ford paid $2 billion more 
than what it said was the fair value of Jaguar's net assets, which it pegged at 
$500 million. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the acquisition last December, some auto analysts said Ford was 
paying a significant premium for the British company. But Ford defended the 
purchase by saying it expected to significantly increase Jaguar's sales. 
</P>
<P>
"There is significant potential for sales increases for Jaguar in Europe, North 
America, the Far East and other areas," said Ford Chairman Harold Poling and 
President Philip Benton in a statement included in the annual report. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the purchase, Ford also said it was willing to pay for an entry 
position into the worldwide premium car market, which it expects will grow 
rapidly in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts applauded that reasoning, saying it would cost Ford substantially 
more that $2.5-billion to develop its own premium luxury marque. 
</P>
<P>
In the report, Ford said the $2 billion it paid over Jaguar's net asset value 
will be spread over 40 years.

<P>
WOMEN'S ISSUES: SOME PASADENA WOMEN'S CONFERENCE ORGANIZERS CRINGED AT ADDING A 
SEMINAR ON FINDING A MAN. IT PROVED TO BE POPULAR. 
</P>

<P>
Jewell Winlock Henderson faced a roomful of about 50 eager, single women at the 
Pasadena Women's Conference Saturday and gestured to the 10-point game plan she 
had tacked up on a chalkboard. 
</P>
<P>
"Ladies, if you want to meet Mr. Right, you have to go about it logically, not 
emotionally," she advised. "Design your man and then find him. If you had money 
to purchase a Cadillac, would you show up at a VW place?" 
</P>
<P>
Half an hour into her seminar, titled "Finding Mr. Right," Henderson offered 
living proof that her plan really works. The doors opened and in walked her Mr. 
Right -- her husband, Charles Henderson -- to a chorus of ooohs and aaahs from 
the participants. 
</P>
<P>
Not exactly what you would expect from a gathering with the theme "Women of the 
'90s: Taking Control." But the 13th annual conference, held at Westminster 
Presbyterian Church, was a study in diversity. 
</P>
<P>
Across the hall from Henderson, a different group of women gathered to discuss 
"Lesbian Issues of the '90s," an overview of the psychological and legal 
aspects of homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
Downstairs, three women told yet another group how they succeeded in 
male-dominated careers, from police officer to priest to bus driver. 
</P>
<P>
"There seems to be more pluralism in the '90s," said Karen Fite, an attorney 
who led the lesbian seminar along with psychologist Mary Hayden. "There's not 
quite a politically correct way to be a feminist anymore." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, although coordinator Lara Larramendi Blakely said some of the event's 
coordinators initially cringed at the addition of the seminar on finding a man, 
it was one of the best-attended workshops of the conference and did not seem to 
offend any of the participants. 
</P>
<P>
"I like that they had something for everybody," said Kristin Neville, 28, of 
Highland Park. "It's an advance for women, not a retreat." 
</P>
<P>
Theresa Wisda, 37, of Pasadena, said she felt the Mr. Right seminar was a 
signal that the women's movement may have been influenced by recent 
conservatism. 
</P>
<P>
"I think feminists are softening a bit around the edges," she said. "We've had 
this superwoman image, thinking that we can have it all, and we are finding out 
that we're ending up with a big mess." 
</P>
<P>
Feminist leader Betty Friedan, a pioneer of the women's movement, laughed 
heartily and exclaimed "Good Lord!" when told about the inclusion of the 
man-hunting seminar at the women's conference. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas such a topic might have raised feminist hackles a few years ago, she 
said, finding a mate is a preoccupation of many women, even if they are 
politically savvy professionals. 
</P>
<P>
"The women's movement isn't over; it's still evolving," said Friedan, who was 
not affiliated with the Pasadena conference and did not attend. "If 'Finding 
Mr. Right' is in the context of the totality of women's issues, like child care 
and parental leave, I think that's OK." 
</P>
<P>
More than 300 people attended Saturday's conference, choosing from 21 workshops 
on various themes, from financial planning and entrepreneurship to image 
enhancing and fitness. 
</P>
<P>
Gerda Steele, producer and host of the "Ebony '90" radio show on KPCC, 
instructed women about how to speak, dress and walk with confidence. Questions 
from the audience included how to ask for a raise, how to deal with an 
opinionated mother-in-law and how to supervise men in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
"Women are not taught how to be very direct and straightforward. You have to 
come from the position where you feel you deserve whatever you're asking for 
before you will get it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Mateer, a financial counselor, told women how to commit to goals in 
financial planning and how to control their financial futures. Leilia Bailey 
talked about how difficult it was to gain the respect of the thousands of male 
employees she supervises as director of transportation for the Southern 
California Rapid Transit District. 
</P>
<P>
In a different way, Henderson's Mr. Right session advocated gaining the respect 
of the opposite sex. The 51-year-old member of the Pasadena Commission on the 
Status of Women, which sponsored the conference, said women looking for a 
partner should zero in on the type of man they are attracted to and then seek 
him out. 
</P>
<P>
"If you like plumbers, subscribe to plumbing trade magazines, go to a plumber's 
convention and check out the plumbers," she said. "If you're at a convention, 
nobody knows if you're there looking (for a man) or you're there for something 
else." 
</P>
<P>
Miffy Ruggiero, a first-grade teacher who attended Henderson's seminar, said 
that integrating personal and professional needs is going to be a new goal for 
women of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
"I think so many women are trying too hard to maintain their careers. It's kind 
of nice that they fit this (personal) workshop in."

RENOVATING A ROUGH-AND-TUMBLE BUT TRENDY PASADENA TAVERN

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For almost three decades, no beer in a bottle has been sold at the thirtyfiver. 
The proprietors were afraid that a barroom fight would mean broken glass and 
bloody heads. 
</P>
<P>
Now, though, the owners of this windowless, smoky watering hole are determined 
to attract a crowd more accustomed to Brie than brawls. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the thirtyfiver's impending switch from cans to bottles is just one 
sign of the changes taking place at the rough-and-tumble tavern -- and, in a 
grander sense, to all of Old Pasadena as it continues to shake its Skid Row 
past and move forward with a trendy transformation. 
</P>
<P>
The changes won't come easily. For Jennine and Vince Terzo, who inherited the 
thirtyfiver from their father and grandfather, the challenge is how to renovate 
the bar without losing the grubby, blue-collar feel that has endeared it to its 
patrons, both young and old. 
</P>
<P>
But even if the face lift means hanging ferns and brass rails -- which clearly 
it does not -- the thirtyfiver's day drinkers would continue to show up. They 
have been coming, after all, since the two-story structure at 12 Colorado Blvd. 
was bought by the late Vincent Terzo and his son Freddie in 1962. They sold 
shots of whiskey for 35 cents then, giving the bar its name. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our place," says Larry Mesa, 55, sipping a $1 draft beer one recent 
Sunday. "It's a family." 
</P>
<P>
Still, there is concern that an upscale look will alienate some of the bar's 
newer clientele: students from the nearby Art Center College of Design, who 
have dubbed the thirtyfiver "the dirtydiver" and embraced it as their own. 
</P>
<P>
"It's become 'in' because it's not 'in,' " says Justin Bua, a student from the 
art center who was hanging out with friends on a crowded Saturday night 
recently, listening to loud rock music on the jukebox. 
</P>
<P>
But even that has changed. Compact discs have replaced the 45s. 
</P>
<P>
Although they are keenly aware that the unpolished ambience is precisely what 
draws the college crowd, the Terzos say the bar's deteriorating equipment can't 
keep pace with its new-found popularity. "The crowd is overwhelming," says 
Jennine Terzo, 27. "It's a hangout." 
</P>
<P>
Terzo adds that she feels pressure from city officials to keep up with Old 
Pasadena's metamorphosis. The bar has no building or health code violations and 
is not considered a problem by police, city officials said. However, John 
Andrews, a senior planner in the city's Housing and Development Department, 
says it is no secret that the city would like to see the thirtyfiver spruced 
up. 
</P>
<P>
"The city has frowned on this bar for a long time," Jennine Terzo says. "Old 
Town is being called the 'Westwood of the east.' We don't fit in." 
</P>
<P>
But fitting in could be their ruin, says Ray Oldenburg, a sociology professor 
at the University of West Florida whose new book, "The Great Good Place," 
bemoans the loss of hangouts such as bars, coffee shops, pool halls, beauty 
parlors and general stores in America. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a healthy night-time crowd because of the way the bar is now," 
Oldenburg says, after learning in a phone interview about the thirtyfiver's 
situation. "With the remodeling, they could be just another bar. If they start 
competing with posh places that sell imported beers, they could well go under." 
</P>
<P>
Oldenburg says that in the past 40 years, the number of taverns in the United 
States has shrunk from 152,000 to fewer than 50,000. And, he adds, as city 
planners and developers continue to restore old neighborhoods, the tavern -- as 
local hangout -- could disappear. 
</P>
<P>
That, of course, would be unfortunate for those who have come to think of the 
thirtyfiver as a place "where everybody knows your name," the same as "Cheers," 
the famed television bar. Make no mistake, the thirtyfiver is far dumpier than 
the sitcom saloon. But, like it, the Old Pasadena haunt attracts people of 
different classes, ethnicities and ages, all of whom have found a way to get 
along. 
</P>
<P>
"The bums, the artists, the oldsters, the preppies, all feel comfortable here," 
says Tom Taylor, 22, who regularly shoots pool in the back room. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the recent Saturday night. The bar was filled with the likes of Leon 
Yantz, a homeless man who used to work in the steel mills of Pittsburgh; Ray 
Hall, a hard hat who is doing work on a nearby building; Tom Coston, who 
promotes local artists, and Sarah Bennett, a 42-year-old Pasadena native, clad 
in a Kelly green slicker and Top-Siders. "It's a not tea place, it's not a 
cappuccino place," Bennett says. "It's a real place." 
</P>
<P>
But since inheriting the tavern about two years ago from their father, the 
Terzo children have added a few imported beers, blush wines, diet sodas, fruit 
juice and bottled waters to the menu. 
</P>
<P>
They also have plans to replace and extend the bar, and want to tear the red 
carpet from the walls and replace the ripped Leatherette bar stools. With the 
help of an architect, there also are plans to turn the basement, now used for 
storage, into a hangout with a second bar and more pool tables for "the kids," 
while renovating the upstairs as a lounge. 
</P>
<P>
Although Jennine Terzo vows "it won't be a ritzy, fancy place," the scruffy 
hardwood floors may be replaced "with something that's easier to clean." 
</P>
<P>
And while the details are as yet unclear, the Terzos say they'll also try to 
make the thirtyfiver's dreary stone and black-glass facade more welcoming. 
"Some people are afraid to come in here because the place looks scary," says 
25-year-old Vince Terzo. 
</P>
<P>
But many who have frequented the thirtyfiver despite its forbidding appearance 
say there isn't a friendlier bar in town. "It's a place where people care about 
each other," says John (Jaybird) Legat, 56, who has been drinking bourbon and 
Coke at the thirtyfiver every day for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The tavern's day drinkers, mostly senior citizens who live in the area's 
retirement hotels, are especially loyal to the Terzo family. That's because the 
late Freddie Terzo always let customers run tabs when they had no money. As one 
story goes, he even paid for the funeral of one regular customer who had no 
family.

Their father's legacy is something that will not be lost in the changes, the 
Terzo children pledge. Yantz, the homeless man who has been coming to the 
thirtyfiver for about eight years, still runs a tab each month. "If I have 
money, I pay," Yantz says, sipping a Jack Daniel's and Coke. "If not, I pay at 
the end of the month when I get my disability check." 
</P>
<P>
And like their father, the Terzo children help out when they can. When their 
uncle recently died, they packed a box full of pants, shirts, shoes and socks 
and gave it to Yantz. "It was enough clothes for a year," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Although most patrons say they like the thirtyfiver just the way it is, there 
is one change in the works that no one seems to mind. The bar's new logo, on 
bartenders' T-shirts and the sign outside, will read: "freddie's 35er."

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: BRODERICK JUDGE WANTS TV VIEWERS TO HEAR NO EVIL, BUT 
STATIONS SEE RED 
</P>

<P>
An unusual ruling by the judge in Betty Broderick's preliminary hearing has 
left San Diego's three major television stations sputtering. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Court Judge E. Mac Amos Jr. ruled that the stations could tape the 
prelim but could not broadcast the audio of any testimony without his approval. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, when Broderick's boyfriend, Bradley T. Wright, testified that Broderick 
admitted to the rage killing of her ex-husband and his new wife, television 
viewers could see Wright but not hear him. Reporters had to summarize his 
testimony in a "voice-over." 
</P>
<P>
Amos explained that he wanted to avoid the kind of dramatic sound-bites that 
could prejudice potential jurors in the highly publicized case. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an emotion-packed proceeding in which statements by some witnesses 
could have a substantial impact on the jury pool," Amos said. 
</P>
<P>
Amos said his ruling did nothing to hinder media coverage, noting that he 
allowed television and newspaper reporters to tape the proceedings to ensure 
the accuracy of their quotes. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think you can have a full and complete account of the court (session) 
without broadcasting certain statements that could be prejudicial," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 10 anchor Michael Tuck, in a Monday night Perspective, accused Amos of 
trying to "muzzle reporters and deny your right to know what was happening in 
his courtroom." 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Huff, a San Diego attorney representing channels 8, 10 and 39, hopes to 
get an order from the 4th District Court of Appeal overturning Amos. 
</P>
<P>
The stations want to use the Broderick audio tape in continuing coverage and 
also to prevent the "Amos rule" from being followed by other judges in other 
cases. Huff says Amos is trying to exercise an illegal prior restraint by 
requiring the stations to seek his permission before using their audio tapes. 
</P>
<P>
Stay tuned. 
</P>
<P>
There will be film at 11. Whether there will be sound will be decided by the 
appeals court.

Bone to Pick With Councilwoman 
</P>
<P>
The political whirl. 
</P>
<P>
Encinitas Councilwoman Anne Omsted made a less-than-flattering offhand remark 
about chiropractors at a recent council meeting, 
</P>
<P>
Presto, the Sacramento-based California Chiropractic Assn. sent her a scolding 
letter and a packet of information explaining that chiropractors are the 
backbone of the health care system. 
</P>
<P>
A San Diego City Council committee this morning will vote whether to recommend 
a ban on the sale of cheap wine in several mid-city neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Last time, Councilman John Hartley, who has political supporters among liquor 
store and grocery owners, bottled up the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Now there are thought to be enough votes to send it to the full council for 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
The council Tuesday rejected a neighborhood appeal that would have blocked a 
seven-unit low-income development in Encanto sponsored by Habitat for Humanity. 
</P>
<P>
That's the housing project favored by former President Jimmy Carter, who will 
be here in June to pound nails. 
</P>
<P>
A number of people attending a Catholic retreat last weekend in Imperial Beach 
were annoyed when Bud Brooks, a Democratic candidate in the 78th Assembly 
District, used the occasion to ask for votes. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks was one of 14 persons invited to speak to the three-day retreat that 
attracted about 70 Catholics to discuss matters of faith. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks, a county probation officer and Operation Rescue member, won't discuss 
what happened, except to say, "Spirituality is a private concern."

BRODERICK HELD FOR ARRAIGNMENT IN MURDER CASE; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: JUDGE SAYS THERE IS ENOUGH CAUSE TO BELIEVE DIVORCEE IS GUILTY OF 
SHOOTING HER EX-HUSBAND AND HIS NEW WIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Betty Broderick, the former wife of a prominent San Diego malpractice attorney, 
was ordered Tuesday to appear April 3 in Superior Court to be arraigned on 
charges that she murdered her ex-husband and his new wife. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge E. Mac Amos Jr. said that less than 1 1/2 days of testimony had 
established sufficient cause to believe that the 42-year-old divorcee is guilty 
of shooting Daniel T. Broderick III and his wife, Linda, as they slept in the 
early morning of Nov. 5. Amos also ordered that Betty Broderick continue to be 
held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear that the homicide was committed from the evidence that I heard and 
that the defendant committed the killings," he said, adding that he was denying 
a bail request from Broderick's lawyer because "I am very concerned about the 
defendant's mental stability." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Kerry Wells said she will disclose at the arraignment 
whether she will seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Amos' rulings were the final step in what was a brief but emotional preliminary 
hearing. On Monday, seven witnesses had taken the stand, each of them 
elaborating on Betty Broderick's state of mind before, during and after she 
allegedly emptied her .38-caliber, five-shot revolver into her ex-husband's 
darkened bedroom, ripped a telephone out of the wall and fled. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the prosecution called its final witness, Ronnie Brown, a friend 
whom Broderick called on the day of the shootings. Brown merely repeated what 
previous witnesses had said about Broderick's "distraught" state of mind that 
day, when she went to her daughter's Pacific Beach apartment, calling friends 
and family, before contacting an attorney and turning herself in. 
</P>
<P>
According to Broderick's boyfriend, Bradley T. Wright, and to her two 
college-age daughters, Kim and Lee, Betty had made no secret of her hatred for 
the slain couple, who she maintained had begun an affair while she and Daniel 
were still married. Broderick frequently had said she wanted to kill Daniel and 
Linda, they said, and in recent months has admitted committing the murders. 
</P>
<P>
After testimony was completed Tuesday, Jack Earley, Broderick's lawyer, asked 
Amos to set bail, claiming that his client was not a threat and would not flee. 
</P>
<P>
"Ms. Broderick did turn herself in. She had an opportunity to leave, and she 
did not avail herself of the opportunity," he said, adding that, if freed on 
bail, she could aid in her own defense by sifting through the voluminous paper 
work associated with the Brodericks' lengthy, complicated divorce. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult for her to be able to defend herself while she is in 
custody," Earley said. 
</P>
<P>
But Wells countered that Broderick was indeed a threat -- even to Wells 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence has shown, at least to a limited extent, the defendant had a 
significant long-term hatred for the victims in this case and she ultimately 
killed them," Wells said. "She is still filled with hate, and she has directed 
that hate toward other members of the community." 
</P>
<P>
Wells submitted a letter, written in Broderick's hand, that she said threatened 
Wells herself. To give the court "a flavor" of the defendant's attitude, Wells 
then read from a handful of letters Broderick has written from jail. 
</P>
<P>
One letter accuses Larry Broderick, Daniel's brother and the court-appointed 
guardian of the Brodericks' two minor sons, of kidnaping the boys. 
</P>
<P>
"Right after this happened, my husband's brother went to court with no notice 
to me and seized physical custody of my youngest two children and whisked them 
off to Colorado and is telling them they will never see or speak to me again," 
Wells read, quoting Broderick. "I think I've heard this tune before! Even 
though my husband is gone, his friends are still here and if anything, my 
husband's influence in legal circles has grown." 
</P>
<P>
In some letters, Betty called Larry Broderick "scum . . . the exact words she 
used to describe her ex-husband," Wells said. "If she is released from custody 
. . . there are other people out there that she might do bodily harm to." 
</P>
<P>
Amos denied the bail request. He also denied Earley's request that he continue 
the hearing to give Earley time to refile several subpoenas. Earley had sought 
to subpoena Daniel Broderick's bank records, but had executed the documents 
improperly, making them invalid. Amos said that Earley should feel free to 
refile the subpoenas, but that he did not see how the victim's finances would 
be relevant to the defense's case. 
</P>
<P>
Earley later questioned the fairness of the ruling, noting that the prosecution 
had successfully subpoenaed Broderick's bank statements. Earley said the ruling 
indicated "there's going to be a number of things that are uphill battles. If 
she does something, it's going to have to be 100% by the book." 
</P>
<P>
He also said he will probably file disqualification motions against the bench 
at the arraignment.

SCHOOLS CUT RENT TO ENCOURAGE NONPROFIT CHILD-CARE SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nonprofit child-care providers who wish to rent space at San Diego city schools 
will be charged 30% less under a fee structure approved Tuesday by trustees as 
a way to expand the number of programs offered at their 106 elementary sites. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-0 decision establishes a set of charges exclusive to such child-care 
organizations, and trustees hope that the move will allow these providers 
either to increase the number of children they serve or lower charges to 
parents. The average fee now is about $400 a month. 
</P>
<P>
The move represents the first major step to improve child-care offerings in the 
district after two major board discussions last fall on the lack of programs -- 
district or private -- available to parents in the nation's eighth-largest 
school system. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees also indicated that they will proceed with a series of related 
recommendations presented to them Tuesday by administrators. 
</P>
<P>
Among other points, the staff report calls for: easier use of auditoriums and 
other multipurpose space at schools by child-care providers; easier use of 
playground and other space for placing privately owned portable buildings for 
child-care use; use of available federal money to teach low-income students 
skills in more district-operated preschool programs. 
</P>
<P>
The district operates 27 state-subsidized Child Development Centers for 2,128 
low-income students at elementary schools, but it has a waiting list of more 
than 2,000 students. It also allows nonprofit, before- and after-school 
child-care programs at 25 schools. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators said Tuesday that space could be made available in multipurpose 
rooms and auditoriums of 23 uncrowded schools. Programs using portable 
buildings on playgrounds could also be expanded from the present five sites to 
as many as 48, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Board members praised staff efforts, but said they want to make sure that low- 
and middle-income families hard-pressed to afford private child care will 
benefit from the new efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a better sense of how we can do advocacy and reach out to those who 
need child care the most," trustee Susan Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Colleague Shirley Weber asked that the board try to ensure that the lower fees 
for nonprofit providers will be passed along, either in lower charges to 
parents or in expanded programs at schools with many low-income families unable 
to afford private care. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Selverston, who coordinates child care for the private nonprofit Social 
Advocates for Youth, which operates programs at 12 schools, told the board that 
the group already plans to expand at Horton and Valencia Park elementaries, 
both in low-income areas. 
</P>
<P>
She praised the board's new fee structure, saying it will allow Social 
Advocates not only to offer more programs but also to lower the student-staff 
ratios in their centers. 
</P>
<P>
The Childcare Resource Service, a nonprofit San Diego organization, estimates 
that 80,000 students up to age 14 nationwide have child-care needs, based on a 
study by a consortium of providers last year. Many smaller county school 
districts already provide before- and after-school child care on a 
fee-for-service basis. But they do not have the wide range of socioeconomic 
levels served by San Diego Unified, where many parents cannot afford to pay 
more than a token amount.

PARENTS WANT PRINCIPAL WHO CAN SIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several parents of deaf and hard-of-hearing children who attend Lafayette 
Elementary School asked San Diego city schools trustees Tuesday to require that 
a new principal know sign language in order to communicate better with the 
students. 
</P>
<P>
About 140 of Lafayette's 634 students are deaf or hearing-impaired. 
</P>
<P>
The school's principal died this year, and the process of picking a replacement 
is under way. 
</P>
<P>
The school district, in soliciting applicants from among district employees, 
has said that fluency in American Sign Language for the deaf would be preferred 
but not required. 
</P>
<P>
The parents who spoke Tuesday said that fluency would help improve both the 
social and academic performance of their children. A principal without signing 
ability is unable to communicate effectively in disciplining students or in 
evaluating the special teachers for the deaf, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Tom Payzant, along with the board, said that the existing selection 
process will continue but indicated that the board may determine none of the 
present applicants is qualified and decide to solicit from outside the 
district. There are only two district employees knowledgeable in sign language 
who would be eligible to apply for the Lafayette principal's post.

2 ESCAPEES CAUGHT; 4 FROM BREAKOUT STILL FREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Two more inmates who participated in a mass escape from County Jail in Chula 
Vista were recaptured Tuesday in North Park by San Diego police. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests bring to nine the number of escapees from the March 7 breakout who 
have been recaptured. Four others remain at large. 
</P>
<P>
Police identified one of the men apprehended Tuesday as Larry Rodriguez 
Dominguez, 18. A suspected gang member, he was considered one of the most 
dangerous of the escapees. He was in jail on suspicion of murder, attempted 
murder, robbery and weapons violations. 
</P>
<P>
The other escapee caught Tuesday was Jesus Humberto Lopez, 21, who was in 
custody on charges of assault with a deadly weapon and sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez and Lopez are close friends, according to Police Department spokesman 
Bill Robinson, and the two men were arrested at the home of relatives of 
Dominguez in the 440 block of Park Boulevard, where they were living. 
</P>
<P>
About 11:30 a.m. Tuesday, detectives saw Lopez get in a car with another man, 
who took him to a McDonald's restaurant on El Cajon Boulevard near Interstate 
805. As they placed orders at the drive-through window, police used their 
vehicles to block them off. The driver, Frank Amador, was arrested on suspicion 
of harboring a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives later returned to the house. Working with a task force of officers 
from homicide, special investigations, patrol units, plus a police helicopter 
unit, officers forced their way into the house about 1 p.m. and arrested 
Dominguez without incident. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Gordon Redding said several people were in the house, but the owners were 
not home. He said charges of harboring a fugitive are pending against the 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the escape took place, (Dominguez) made statements to people that he 
would kill any police officer that tried to arrest him," Redding said. 
"Sheriff's deputies at the Chula Vista facility warned us after the escape." 
</P>
<P>
Still at large are Francisco Yacumba, 19, who was in custody on drug charges; 
Audias Gomez, 36, held on murder charges; Benjamin Tapia, 21, accused of being 
a burglar, and Sergio Martinez, 22, an alleged murderer.

CROW, FERNANDEZ ENJOY GETTING DEFENSIVE 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While they're joking, needling and poking fun at each other, it's easy to see 
there is a lot of mutual respect mixed in. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Crow and George Fernandez, all-star defenders for the Sockers, enjoy a 
good laugh off the field. On it, they combine with teammates Ralph Black and 
Cacho to put a lot of detours in the path of opponents. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent afternoon after practice, Crow and Fernandez got together to shoot 
the breeze about playing defense in the Major Indoor Soccer League: 
</P>
<P>
Question: You guys seem to be injured less than a lot of players on the 
Sockers. Is there a reason for that? 
</P>
<P>
Crow: I think we're fit, which helps. I also think it's a little bit of the 
nature of the position. It's not quite as demanding as the midfield, and you're 
not getting kicked as much as forwards. But I think the guys in the back train 
hard, and I think they take care of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What about the iron man over here? You're up to about 117 (now 120) games in 
a row now, right? 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez: Uh, I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
Crow: He knows, he knows, he knows. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez: I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
Crow: He knows. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez: Yeah, it's something like that. I try to keep in shape. I think 
that's the key, really. Once you get out of shape, there are so many things 
that can happen to you. 
</P>
<P>
Crow: I really think it all starts in preseason. If you get hurt in preseason 
because you're out of shape . . . it's like you never catch up. 
</P>
<P>
I think that happens to some players. They take lousy care of themselves into 
the preseason and they think "OK, I'll be ready when the season starts." But 
they get hurt because they're carrying 10 extra pounds. The body's not used to 
playing with that. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You've got quite a few in a row too, don't you, Kevin? (He had played in 87 
in a row before Friday's game with Kansas City, which he missed to attend his 
grandmother's funeral). 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez: He knows, he knows, he knows. 
</P>
<P>
Crow: What am I, like 20 behind you? 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez: Yeah, something like that. 
</P>
<P>
Q: The last one you missed was because you played on the national team? 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez: Oh, I don't want to hear that. 
</P>
<P>
Crow: You don't want to hear that because you know I'd destroy you. I'd be up 
to three hundred and something. I've missed one game in eight years because of 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez: That's amazing. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How do your styles of play contrast? 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez: I'm more aggressive. I take a lot more chances than I think Kevin 
does. Kevin's more the laid-back, thinking type. 
</P>
<P>
Crow: I think he's more of an aggressive, emotional defender. I sit back and 
read the situation and then kind of decide what I'm going to do. 
</P>
<P>
Socker Coach Ron Newman is asked to assess the technical differences of his 
four starting defenders. 
</P>
<P>
Of Crow: "He's great when you have a battle on the board, because he's got so 
much strength. I've never seen anybody muscle him off the ball. And yet for a 
big player, he's got a nice touch." 
</P>
<P>
Of Fernandez: "He's got this tremendous courage. He'll throw himself into the 
most horrendous shots that I think I'd be ducking." 
</P>
<P>
Of Black: "He's hard-nosed. He just doesn't take any mucking about from anyone. 
He's also got a very nice left foot." 
</P>
<P>
Of Cacho: "He's got a lot of experience. He can handle people who have got all 
sorts of tricks up their sleeve. He's very comfortable with the ball and very 
deceptive with his passes." 
</P>
<P>
Q: What's the most effective way to block a shot? 
</P>
<P>
Crow: You ever see the way he blocks shots? 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez: Come on, man. I'm leading the team. (Fernandez has 76, Crow 70). 
</P>
<P>
Crow: You wouldn't want to teach any kids this technique. He just lies down. He 
leans over and his weight gets a little too far going one way, and he ends up 
lying down. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez: It takes up more room. 
</P>
<P>
Crow: I've always been high on the team in blocked shots. But a lot of that is 
just because when you play on the defensive power play, especially in the 
position in the back, their position is the high pressure, to force bad shots 
and force bad passes. My position is to back them up and to block shots . . . 
The blocked shots I like are when I block someone else's man's shot. Someone 
else is taking someone on, and I leave my man to block the shot. To me, that's 
a good blocked shot. 
</P>
<P>
Q: The defenders on the Sockers always seem to work well together and get in 
fewer arguments than the rest of the guys. Is there a reason for that? 
</P>
<P>
Crow: The defenders have always been sort of like a little unit. Nobody really 
cares who starts the game. It doesn't matter to us. That's why we've always 
joked when the other guys on the team argue about playing time or who's not 
passing who the ball or "I got this assist, you shouldn't have gotten it." We 
sit back and say "Who cares?" 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez: The bottom line is we want to win. We don't care what it takes. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers defenders don't fight among themselves, but Black has never been 
opposed to getting in a scrape if he feels the situation calls for it. He 
serves as sort of a bodyguard for the rest of the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to mix it up," Black said. "I don't care about size or anything. I'll 
mix it up, and I don't care who I mix it up with. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just the way I was brought up. (San Bruno) was a tough place to grow up. 
You had to be tough. There were always fights going on and if you couldn't take 
care of yourself you'd get killed." 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago in Dallas, Black got into a scuffle with Sidekick defender Doc 
Lawson, a martial arts expert. Lawson ended up kicking Black in the head. Black 
says it really didn't faze him too much. 
</P>
<P>
"I never took karate or nothing," he said. "But I had a lot of friends who were 
black belts and all that. A kick to my head doesn't mean (anything). 
</P>
<P>
"When you get to a point where you blow up, he can stick his black belt up . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
Let's leave it at that, but suffice it to say he didn't finish the sentence 
with "on his mantle, next to his MISL championship trophy." 
</P>
<P>
Black says the defender's job has become more difficult with elimination of a 
rule that prohibited a pass from crossing both the red lines and the white 
midfield line in the air. A defender used to be able to allow a forward to get 
behind him inside the red line and not worry about a pass being chipped over 
his head from the other end. He must now be more cautious to prevent opponents 
from getting one-on-one breakaways. 
</P>
<P>
Black, in his ninth MISL season, has seen a lot of change, which has made it 
essential for defenders to cultivate good ball-control skills rather than just 
an aggressive attitude and a pair of strong legs. 
</P>
<P>
"The game's changed so much," he said. "Back when I started it wasn't as 
skillful. The NASL took some of the good players away. There was a lot more 
running. Now it's probably as good as it's going to get in terms of skill." 
</P>
<P>
Q: Who is the toughest player in the league to defend? 
</P>
<P>
Crow: Right now I'd probably say Tatu (Dallas) is one of the more difficult 
ones, especially when he's hot. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez: He's got an unbelievable first step. Low center of gravity, strong 
and agile. I'll tell you who gives me problems is (Jan) Goossens (Kansas City). 
When you try to block his shot, he always comes right back and plays it through 
your legs. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What is the difference in the way you play now compared with when you first 
started in the MISL? 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez: It's all emotion, really, when you're just starting out. 
</P>
<P>
Crow: Like Don Cogsville (Socker rookie defender). When he goes out he's 
running 100 miles an hour right now. In two or three years, you watch, he'll 
slow down and pick and choose when to run and when to pressure. I think when 
you're young, you tend to get dragged out of position, you mark your man almost 
too much and don't back up other people enough. Things like that take time. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Compare playing defense outdoors with defense indoors. 
</P>
<P>
Crow: In this game, you let people take shots because the goals are smaller, 
and the angles are different than outdoors, where you can't let a guy shoot 
because the goals are so big. In outdoors you always want the player to make 
that pass wide. Here it's almost better to let a guy take a shot from the top 
of the box instead of passing to the far post. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What's the strangest goal you've seen the Sockers allow? 
</P>
<P>
Crow: Ade Coker passed a harmless ball back to the keeper from the halfway 
line. Nobody was even around for 20 or 30 yards, and Alan (Mayer) was in goal. 
He put his heel up to stop the ball and he took his eye off the ball. His heel 
was too high and the ball rolled underneath his foot and into the goal. I was 
laughing so hard. You're just sitting there saying "No, that didn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
Q: What's the most important thing about playing defense in the MISL? 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez: Communication and confidence in each other. To realize that if you 
get beat somebody's going to help you. You have to feel good about that person 
and not have any qualms about what's going to happen. Our defenders get along 
really well. I think we respect each other. 
</P>
<P>
Crow: I think that's one of the biggest things right there. You've got to have 
respect for the guys you're playing with. I think the defenders have always 
respected each other and what we can do. We're all better at different things. 
I think everyone's gotten their share of recognition playing defense as a team.

BASEBALL: AFTER BACK SURGERY IN AUGUST CLOUDED HIS FUTURE, THE PADRE 
RIGHT-HANDER SAID TUESDAY'S EYE-POPPING COMEBACK IS JUST THE START OF THE BEST 
YEAR OF HIS CAREER.

<TEXT>
<P>
The whispers spread throughout the complex. Fans elbowed one another to get a 
closer look. Cameras flashed. Reporters began scribbling. 
</P>
<P>
It had been just 60 minutes since the Padres walked onto the practice field 
Tuesday for their first spring-training workout, but as incredulous as it 
sounds, they were calling this perhaps their most important moment of the 1990 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Show, the man who has created more rumors about his well-being than Elvis, 
was taking the mound. 
</P>
<P>
It had been nearly nine months since Show had last pitched for the Padres. The 
date was June 25, 1989, to be exact. He pitched three innings against the San 
Francisco Giants, and left the field after three innings complaining of lower 
back pains. 
</P>
<P>
Since that day, he went on the disabled list, changed his telephone number, 
underwent back surgery, changed his phone number, threw on the side a couple of 
times, changed his phone number, had what he thought was a relapse, changed his 
phone number, began working out again, changed his phone number, and arrived 
Tuesday morning at the Padre clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody knew what Eric was up to because hardly anyone had seen him, or even 
talked to him," Padre outfielder Tony Gwynn said. "It was like he wanted to 
keep everything a big secret. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any of us had his number because he kept changing it." 
</P>
<P>
Said one Padre pitcher: "I don't know how he does it. The guy changes his 
number every three weeks. I've got trouble remembering my number now, and I've 
had it for years." 
</P>
<P>
Show was the most talked-about Padre pitcher during the off-season. His name 
came up when the Padres went after free-agent Mark Langston. His name came up 
when the Padres lost bullpen stopper Mark Davis. His name came up at the winter 
meetings. His name came up in every preseason prospectus. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody knew how he'd be," said Jack McKeon, Padre Manager and vice 
president/baseball operations. "I heard some good reports, in fact, even from 
my own son, but until I saw him, I had no idea how he'd throw." 
</P>
<P>
Show, who envisioned this day for the past seven months, ever since Aug. 2 when 
he had the lumbar 5 disk removed from his lower back, kept reminding himself 
with each step he took toward the mound to calm down. 
</P>
<P>
"That was my biggest fear," Show would say later, "getting too excited and 
trying to do something I shouldn't. I didn't want everything I worked for 
ruined." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, how could he not be nervous? How could he not be apprehensive? Heck, it 
had been so long since the last time he pitched in a Padre uniform that there 
were 29 new players who have been invited to camp who Show never had played 
with. 
</P>
<P>
If this was just a routine spring-training outing, then why was McKeon flanked 
to his left and Las Vegas pitching coach Gary Lance flanked to his right? 
</P>
<P>
Slowly, he began warming up, throwing to a catcher he had never met, Pedro 
Lopez, a 20-year-old minor leaguer. He threw fastballs. He threw curveballs. He 
threw sliders. He even threw changeups. 
</P>
<P>
He was supposed to warm up for only five minutes, but it was 10 minutes before 
Lance could pull him away from the mound. 
</P>
<P>
Now, it was time for the real stuff. Live batters. First up, Tony Gwynn. On 
deck, Fred Lynn. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't matter who was batting on this day. Nobody was going to be getting 
their knocks off Show. He threw fastballs past hitters. He fooled them with his 
new changeup. He dazzled them with his slider. 
</P>
<P>
This is the guy who's supposed to be the biggest question mark on the club? 
Sorry, the secret's out. If his first workout is any indication, pay attention 
baseball world. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Show is back. 
</P>
<P>
"To tell you the truth, if I hadn't been told, there was no way I would have 
known that he had back surgery, or that there was anything wrong with him," 
Lance said. "He had great stuff, especially that nasty slider. And now that 
he's got that changeup working, it wouldn't surprise me a bit to see the guy 
win 18 to 20 games. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no one else that was pitching like that today." 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn could only shake his head at Show's performance, saying, "I just knew 
Eric was going to come back like this. He wanted to keep it a big secret, keep 
everyone wondering what he was up to, but I just knew he'd do this. 
</P>
<P>
"Eric has got a lot of pride in what he does. You can tell this year is going 
to be important to him. He wants to prove to everyone what kind of pitcher he 
really is. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of us hadn't even seen him since the summer. He didn't spend a lot of 
time around the ballclub once he got hurt, and guys thought he didn't care. 
</P>
<P>
"But today, you could tell guys were excited about seeing him come back. I can 
start talking to him about baseball again, but you know, anything else I'll 
stay away from." 
</P>
<P>
Show always has been a little different. 
</P>
<P>
Like his claim that he doesn't read the newspaper or watch the TV news, and 
instead gathers his information from an alternative newspaper called the New 
American. 
</P>
<P>
For proof, someone casually asked him about Pete Rose. 
</P>
<P>
His reply? 
</P>
<P>
"What happened to Pete? Seriously, what happened?" 
</P>
<P>
"You didn't know that he was suspended from baseball?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, I mean, I knew they were mad at him, but did they really suspend him for 
life? I think that's too much." 
</P>
<P>
Like, that the disk that was removed from his back now sits in a bottle of 
formaldehyde in the office of his home. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like crabmeat, only it tastes better," he said. "No really, I wanted 
it so that I could see what it looks like. People in the hospital didn't think 
it was that strange of a request, but I can tell, I'm sure people in here do. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sort of a sentimental smell for me, actually. I haven't smelled that 
stuff since I dissected frogs." 
</P>
<P>
Like, the fact that he's a member of the John Birch Society, has a love for 
studying philosophers, historians and theorists, and enjoys studying ancient 
civilization, . . . just for starters. 
</P>
<P>
There are times when his teammates wonder if this guy is for real, but 
listening to him Tuesday discuss his fears, dreams and anxieties, he sounded 
just like any other player in the game of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I was scared, I was plenty scared," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Show first felt the back pains in January, 1989, and after extensive testing, 
three millimeters of a protruding disk was discovered. Exercises were 
prescribed, and Show kept pitching. 
</P>
<P>
"But the pain kept getting worse, and worse," Show, 33, said. "When I had 
another test done in July, it (the protruding disk) had increased to over 7 
inches. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to three different specialists, and each one of them said that if I 
didn't get something done, I'd have nerve damage. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, baseball is one thing, walking is another." 
</P>
<P>
Show had no choice. He had to have surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of anxieties on my part," he said. "But you look at Dave 
Dravecky, and you look at his thing, and it's not a valid comparison. I mean, I 
just talked to Dave the other day, and I guess it's 50-50 whether he still has 
the cancer, can you believe it? 
</P>
<P>
"You begin to wonder how much one person can take." 
</P>
<P>
The surgery was performed Aug. 2, and he began throwing again in December. Yet, 
he started feeling pain while running, and learned that he now had to build up 
the muscles around his lower back. Slowly, he felt better, and quickly he 
progressed on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
What was accomplished and displayed Tuesday for all of the Padres to see, he 
said, is just the start of the best year of his career. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always felt I had something to prove in baseball because I haven't thrown 
the ball as well, or consistently as I should," said Show, who is the Padres' 
all-time leader in victories, but never has won more than 16 games in a season. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why that is. I'm sure some is the mental aspect, and some is the 
physical aspect. Those are just two things I've been bothered with my entire 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I feel I have something to prove this year, now, more than ever. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess that's why I'm so happy today. Today was like a perfect practice. In 
fact, for a first practice day, I can't remember having felt any better. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this is just the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Padres likely will open their 1990 season at 1:05 p.m. April 9 in Los 
Angeles against the Dodgers, and then return to San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium 
for a three-game series. The Players Assn. and Player Relations Committee are 
studying the proposal, and are expected to make the announcement today. . . . 
The Padres had 29 players in camp Tuesday, but oddly, still missing were San 
Diego residents Benito Santiago and Roberto Alomar Jr. Other veterans who have 
yet to arrive include outfielder Joe Carter, first baseman Jack Clark, pitcher 
Ed Whitson and third baseman Mike Pagliarulo. Padre batting coach Amos Otis, 
who lives in San Diego, is not expected until Thursday because of recent oral 
surgery. . . . Padre catcher Mark Parent is expected to begin throwing today. 
He suffered a sore right shoulder during winter ball in Puerto Rico, and has 
been receiving treatment at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium for the past two 
months. "It's getting better," Parent said.

MORNING BRIEFING: DON'T BEAT AROUND THE BUSH, BOBBY, GIVE US YOUR OPINION 
</P>

Indiana basketball Coach Bob Knight is always obliging with an opinion, and 
here are a few he expressed in an interview in the Louisville Courier-Journal: 
</P>
<P>
 -- On Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls: "He's head and shoulders above 
anyone else who ever played the game." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On Notre Dame Coach Digger Phelps: "He's a good friend of mine, and I'm his 
only friend." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On TV analyst Dick Vitale: "He's got a heart like an elephant and a mouth 
to match." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On TV analyst Al McGuire: "He was an outstanding coach because he had a way 
of getting people to do things. But he knows nothing about basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Ouch: Announcer Barry Tompkins was quoted in the Atlanta Journal as saying of 
Nevada Las Vegas: "They play like thugs. They have a lot of guys you wouldn't 
want to bring home unless everything is bolted down." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: With Bo Kimble succeeding Hank Gathers as the NCAA scoring 
champion, Loyola Marymount becomes the second school to have two different 
winners in successive seasons. Which was the first? 
</P>
<P>
Longest inning: The subject was old-timers' games, and former pitching star Jim 
Bunning told the St. Petersburg Times: "The first time I played, I got two 
quick outs in the inning and couldn't get the third one. There were 11 straight 
people up. Nine runs and I still didn't get them out. They finally had to come 
and get me. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody asked our catcher, Joe Garagiola, how hard I was throwing. He said, 
'I don't know, I haven't caught one yet.' " 
</P>
<P>
20 years ago today: On March 21, 1970, Curtis Rowe scored 18 points, and Sidney 
Wicks and Steve Patterson had 17 each, with Wicks getting 18 rebounds, as UCLA 
defeated Jacksonville, 80-69, in the NCAA basketball championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Boo-som buddies: When the Detroit Pistons last visited Atlanta, Jerry 
Glanville, new coach of the Falcons, went to the game with the hope of meeting 
Detroit center Bill Laimbeer. 
</P>
<P>
Glanville: "I wanted to meet him, because he's the only guy I know who gets 
booed more than me." 
</P>
<P>
Conditional surrender: Chicago Cub Manager Don Zimmer on spring training: 
"Pitchers will tell you that first day, 'I'm ready to go.' Then you throw them 
for 10 minutes, run them around the field a few times, and half of them will be 
on their knees, throwing up." 
</P>
<P>
Grave question: From Phil Jackman of the Baltimore Evening Sun: "If promoters 
Don King and Bob Arum disappeared from the fight scene, would anybody even 
bother dragging the river?" 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Furman. Frank Selvy won it in 1953-54, Darrell Floyd in 1954-55. 
Actually, Selvy and Floyd each won two titles, giving Furman four in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Paul Westhead, Loyola Marymount basketball coach, on keeping Bo 
Kimble in the game after he picked up his fourth foul with 25 minutes left 
against New Mexico State: "That's my style. Besides, Bo's a very good talker. 
If he'd gotten his fifth, he would have talked his way back into the game."

Jean Fleurian went into his match against Boris Becker with reservations. 
</P>
<P>
He had to cancel them. 
</P>
<P>
Fleurian upset the second-ranked Becker, 7-6 (7-3), 6-1, Tuesday in the third 
round of the International Players Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Fleurian, seeded 32nd in the tournament and ranked 46th in the world, had 
trailed 3-1 in the first set when play was suspended Monday because of rain. 
</P>
<P>
"I was supposed to take my plane flight home Monday night, and I was really mad 
because I didn't make it," the Frenchman said. 
</P>
<P>
"So I made it for tonight. Unfortunately, I won, and now I have to cancel it 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Fleurian said he was being realistic, not pessimistic, in booking a flight 
before the match. 
</P>
<P>
"When you play Boris, you'd better get ready to go back home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fleurian also had to borrow a pair of shorts that were too big for him. He had 
to use a safety pin to get them to fit. 
</P>
<P>
Another upset winner was 30th-seeded Javier Sanchez of Spain, who beat No. 4 
Brad Gilbert, 6-3, 6-7 (14-12), 7-6 (7-4). Gilbert delayed his defeat by 
surviving five match points, including four in the second set. 
</P>
<P>
Top-ranked Ivan Lendl advanced to the fourth round over Uruguay's Marcelo 
Filippini, 6-0, 6-2, in another match suspended Monday because of rain. 
</P>
<P>
Fifth-seeded Andre Agassi defeated Jan Gunnarsson of Sweden, 6-1, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
In a women's quarterfinal match, No. 1-seeded Gabriela Sabatini, who has yet to 
lose a set in nine matches this month, beat Susan Sloane, 6-2, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Also, No. 3 Monica Seles beat No. 13 Rosalyn Fairbank, 6-3, 6-4, and No. 4 
Manuela Maleeva eliminated No. 10 Raffaella Reggi, 6-1, 3-6, 6-2.

DOGGED EFFORT BY SHARP LIFTS KENNEDY OVER TAFT, 5-3

Kennedy High Coach Manny Alvarado tagged pitcher Cody Beaumaster with the 
nickname "Pup" last season, and after Beaumaster jumped to a 3-0 start this 
year, there were those who thought the junior right-hander had shown the teeth 
needed to assume the role of staff ace. 
</P>
<P>
Not so fast, says senior left-hander Denny Sharp, winner of seven games in 
1989. Sure, Sharp struggled in his first three starts, but he says he's still 
the top dog in these parts. Especially when his curve is biting. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm gonna be the ace this year," Sharp said, grinning. "He can wait until next 
season." 
</P>
<P>
Sharp shrugged off a sluggish start Tuesday, tossing a five-hitter and striking 
out 11, to lead Kennedy to a 5-3 win over visiting Taft in a Northwest Valley 
Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
Slow starts have been Sharp's bane all season, and the trouble has been largely 
of his own doing: Entering the week, Sharp had walked 14 batters in 19 innings. 
Against Taft, however, he walked just two. 
</P>
<P>
Taft (4-5, 1-3 in league play) jumped to a 2-0 lead in the first inning, 
scoring a pair of unearned runs. Brett Reisner, who had two hits, led off with 
a single and took second when Sharp walked Sean Collins on four pitches. 
</P>
<P>
One out later, Sharp struck out Jamie Zeichick, however, the ball got past 
catcher Lazaro Campos, who pounced on the ball but heaved his throw well over 
the head of first baseman Troy Bourne, allowing two runs to score. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 3-1, Kennedy (8-1, 4-0) struck for three runs in the bottom of the 
fourth, and, once again, the rally was sparked by Palmer Drain, who was two for 
two. 
</P>
<P>
Drain, who last week keyed a pair of late-inning victories, led off with a walk 
and strolled to second on a passed ball. After tagging and moving to third on a 
fly ball to center, Drain scored on a two-out single by Jack Moussa. 
</P>
<P>
Moussa promptly stole second and took third on a wild pitch. After Campos 
walked and stole second, Richard Trujillo, batting eighth in the lineup, 
drilled a liner that caught second baseman Warren Stewart between bounces for a 
two-run, bad-hop single. 
</P>
<P>
Staked to a lead, Sharp (3-1) settled down. In the final five innings, he faced 
just three batters over the minimum and struck out six. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to see the old Denny back," Alvarado said. "With Pup throwing the 
way he has, I don't think there's a better 1-2 punch around."

ROYAL RUNS WIN STREAK TO 22 MATCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Royal High boys' volleyball Coach Bob Ferguson thought 1990 was going to be a 
rebuilding year. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe he meant the Highlanders were going to add on another Southern Section 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
Royal, the defending Southern Section 2-A Division champion, won its 22nd 
consecutive match Tuesday and fifth this season, upending visiting Crespi in 
three games, 15-3, 15-12, 15-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Highlanders, 38-4 since the inception of their volleyball program three 
years ago, have won all 24 of their home matches. 
</P>
<P>
"Our streak is still alive," Ferguson said afterward. "We're actually probably 
better now than we were last year at this time. Everything we tried today 
worked." 
</P>
<P>
Crespi will vouch for that. The Celts (4-1) trailed by just 4-3 in the first 
game when Royal broke away, capitalizing on Crespi mistakes to score the final 
11 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Celts collected themselves in the next game and led, 12-8, behind Mike 
Palumbo's five kills. But Royal scored seven points in a row to win the game. 
</P>
<P>
In the third game Royal, behind Jeff Colton's five kills, jumped to a 9-1 lead 
and coasted to the win. 
</P>
<P>
"The big factor was they played better defense than we did, and their kids 
wanted it more than our kids did," Crespi Coach Kevin Slattum said. 
</P>
<P>
"We just came out fired up and took them out of their game from the start with 
some tough serving and good defense," said Royal's Adam White, who had eight 
kills. 
</P>
<P>
Colton led Royal with 12 kills. Miguel Ramirez and Kevin Hambly each added 11 
kills and Travis Ferguson had 30 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Palumbo led Crespi with 10 kills.

NBA ROUNDUP;

KNICKS' WOES CONTINUE TO EXPAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even a threatened shakeup could not snap the New York Knicks out of their worst 
slump of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks, not so long ago considered a threat to the Detroit Pistons' crown, 
were beaten by Orlando, 121-118, Tuesday night at New York. 
</P>
<P>
Before losing their fourth in a row, the Knicks built a 12-point lead in the 
third quarter. The Magic ended a nine-game losing streak and an 11-game road 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
This loss and the previous two by a team that was playing so well early in the 
season that they won 22 of their first 24 at home, are hard to explain. Last 
Thursday, they were humiliated by the other expansion team, Minnesota, 102-82. 
Saturday night, Milwaukee, missing three of its best players, won handily at 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
The Magic had several stars, not the least of whom was Scott Skiles. Skiles had 
his first triple-double: 23 points, 12 rebounds and 17 assists. Michael Ansley 
had all 16 of his points in the fourth quarter when the Magic came from seven 
points behind. Nick Anderson scored 29 points. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, Patrick Ewing led the Knicks. Coming back from a first-quarter ankle 
injury, the center had 17 of his 28 points in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks trail Philadelphia by a game in the Atlantic Division they have led 
almost all season. They are only a game ahead of third-place Boston. 
</P>
<P>
"These are games we're supposed to win and build some momentum for the 
playoffs," said Ewing, who had only four points in the first half. "But I'm 
very disappointed in the way things are going." 
</P>
<P>
Before the game, General Manager Al Bianchi gave first-year Coach Stu Jackson a 
vote of confidence. Unless the Knicks straighten out soon, it may be withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
Skiles was given his chance because guards Reggie Theus and Sam Vincent are 
hurt. Skiles played the entire 48 minutes and didn't have a turnover. 
</P>
<P>
Portland 120, Houston 110 -- Clyde Drexler is doing his part in the Trail 
Blazers' drive to overtake the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
He scored eight of his 41 points in the last three minutes at Houston and had 
16 rebounds to lead the Blazers to their 10th in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The Rockets, in danger of missing the playoffs despite the presence of one of 
the NBA's great players, Akeem Olajuwon, built a 14-point lead in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio 128, Seattle 106 -- There are seven teams in the NBA with winning 
records on the road, five of them in the West. 
</P>
<P>
With successive wins at Phoenix and Seattle, the Spurs, bouncing back after a 
mild slump, are one of them at 18-16. 
</P>
<P>
David Robinson scored 20 of his 39 points in the fourth quarter as the Spurs 
romped and pulled to within 2 1/2 games of Utah in the Midwest Division. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 117, Milwaukee 96 -- It just keeps getting easier for the NBA champion 
Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
With James Edwards getting 21 points in 29 minutes, the Pistons took command 
early in the second quarter against the crippled Bucks and were never in danger 
at Auburn Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons have won 12 in a row and 25 of their last 26 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Bucks, playing without their two big men, Jack Sikma and Greg Anderson, 
jumped in front, 29-21, in the first half, but were out of it by halftime, 
trailing, 57-41. They were only five for 23 in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 122, Washington 97 -- Michael Jordan, playing one of his infrequent 
poor games, sent out a call for help in the third quarter at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Scottie Pippen and rookie Stacy King answered the call and the Bulls broke open 
a tight game. 
</P>
<P>
Pippen made two free throws to break a 75-75 tie late in the third period and 
King ignited a 12-4 run with a resounding dunk to start the last quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan had 21 points on eight-of-19 shooting. Pippen and King each had 24 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana 112, Miami 98 -- Detlef Schrempf scored 20 of his career-high 29 points 
in the first half at Miami as the Pacers snapped a five-game losing streak with 
an easy win. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State 105, Minnesota 101 -- Mitch Richmond had 18 of his 24 points in 
the second half at Oakland and the Warriors ended a two-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors were without Chris Mullin, who has a virus. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Campbell scored 34 for Minnesota. DAN HAFNER

COLLEGE ROUNDUP;

PRESTON'S BIG DAY LEADS MASTER'S TO 18-9 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Squeezing a season's worth of statistics into one game, Jeff Preston of The 
Master's had a day to remember in his team's 18-9 nonconference baseball win 
over Chapman at The Master's on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Preston went four for four, scored five runs, had two doubles, a triple, a home 
run (his second) and drove in seven runs to lead the rout. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Cole was the beneficiary of Preston's outburst, picking up the win in 
relief. Joining Preston in the offensive fireworks were teammates Kevin Backes 
(three for four, four runs batted in) and Mark MacArthur (two hits, two RBIs). 
</P>
<P>
Master's improved to 10-12. 
</P>
<P>
In other baseball games: 
</P>
<P>
Glendale 7, Moorpark 6 -- Art Chute knocked in Victor Ramirez with the winning 
run on a two-out single in the bottom of the ninth against visiting Moorpark, 
which entered the game leading the Western State Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale starter Matt Whisenant (4-3) pitched his way out of a one-out, 
bases-loaded jam in the top of the ninth inning to earn the win. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Leighton (4-1) went the distance for Moorpark (12-7, 7-2). 
</P>
<P>
Chute had a two-run single to spark a five-run third inning for Glendale (9-15, 
4-5). Moorpark's Don Smith hit a solo home run in the seventh, and the Raiders 
pulled into a 6-6 tie in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Valley 3, Bakersfield 1 -- Dan Carroll recorded the final two outs, including a 
bases-loaded strikeout to end the game, as the Monarchs held for a win in a WSC 
game at home. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll, who recorded his first save, took over for starter Colin Hines 
(7-14-2, 3-5), who struck out four and allowed three hits in 8 1/3 innings to 
earn the win. 
</P>
<P>
E. J. Pape's bases-loaded single in the third gave Valley a 1-0 lead. Vladimir 
Pajcin drove in the second run of the inning with a bases-loaded smash that the 
right fielder could not handle. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Demyon singled in the sixth to score Chris Greenamyer for Valley's third 
run. 
</P>
<P>
SOFTBALL 
</P>
<P>
CS Northridge 6-3, Mankato State (Minn.) 0-0 -- Debby Dickmann and Heather 
Lindstrom delivered a one-two punch for Cal State Northridge as the Lady 
Matadors punched out Mankato State (Minn.) in a nonconference doubleheader at 
Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Dickmann, a senior, pitched a four-hitter, striking out six and walking two. 
Lindstrom, a sophomore, pitched a two-hitter with three strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Erickson was three for four with two runs scored to lead the offense in 
the first game. Anna Getherall was two for three in the second game. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran 6-4, Christ College-Irvine 0-6 -- DeeAndra Pilkington (8-3) fired 
a three-hitter in the first game, then watched as Christ College's Lisa Merenda 
picked up a win of her own in the nightcap, as the teams split an NAIA District 
3 doubleheader at Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
In the opener, Kim White homered, tripled and drove in two runs. But she then 
lost her 11-game hitting streak to Merenda in the second game.

DIGEST: FALSKEN CHOOSES CS LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tim Falsken, a senior infielder and pitcher at Westlake High, has committed 
orally to attend Cal State Long Beach in the fall. He chose the 49ers over UCLA 
after visiting both schools. 
</P>
<P>
Falsken, 5-foot-9, 160 pounds, has played a key role in Westlake's 7-0 start 
this season, the best in school history. Falsken is batting .476 and has scored 
13 runs. In addition, he is 3-0 with an 0.53 earned-run average in 13 1/3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
He is the second Westlake player to commit to a four-year school. Catcher Mike 
Lieberthal committed to Arizona State last month. The next signing period for 
high school seniors begins April 11. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Gudzunas of Fullerton Troy High, an All-Freeway League selection last 
season, has made an oral commitment to play football at Cal State Northridge in 
the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Gudzunas, 6-foot-2, 195 pounds, was a lineman in Troy's 5-2 defense but is 
projected as an outside linebacker at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
"Speed was (Jason's) biggest asset," Troy Coach John Turek said. "He could 
really run to the football. He was always around the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Gudzunas had 57 tackles, five sacks and recovered four fumbles last season. He 
also led Troy's special teams in tackles. 
</P>
<P>
Matthew Carinio, a senior at Santa Clara High, finished sixth in a field of 54 
cyclists this month in the Fountain Grove Circuit Race in Santa Rosa, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Carinio was one of 13 racers who finished the event. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff and Ernie Thorpe's J-24, Color Blind, was the overall winner in the 
spinnaker division of the Ventura Yacht Club's Frostbite Series that concluded 
earlier this month in Ventura Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Races of two, five and 10 kilometers will start from Fallbrook Mall in West 
Hills on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The 5K run begins at 8 a.m., with the 10K and 2K runs scheduled to begin at

HOMELESS MISSION STOPPED BY HARBOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mission College, the vagabond of junior college baseball, is still searching 
for a home to call its own. 
</P>
<P>
The Free Spirit, which has no campus and, therefore, no campus facility, 
utilizes Valley College for home games -- unless, of course, Valley has a home 
contest scheduled for the same day. 
</P>
<P>
That was the case Tuesday when Mission was forced to entertain top-ranked 
Harbor at Pierce College while Valley played host to Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
Mission lost, 12-5, in a Southern California Athletic Conference game that 
wasn't really decided until Ryan Karp blasted a three-run home run in the 
eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor improved to 23-6 and 6-0 in conference play. Mission is 13-7-1 and 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
Mission entered the game battling for first place and while the Free Spirit may 
not have a home under second-year Coach John Klitsner, it has established 
residence among the competitive teams in the junior college ranks. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're the most improved team in the state from last season," Harbor 
Coach Jim O'Brien said of the Free Spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Mission was 10-23 overall and 8-12 in conference play last season. 
</P>
<P>
Klitsner, a successful coach at Sylmar High, has turned around Mission's 
program by recruiting successfully, teaching fundamentals and forcing his 
players to take pride in their effort. 
</P>
<P>
The difference in Mission is evident. Billy Picketts, a former standout at 
College of the Canyons who now plays at Cal State Los Angeles, was in the 
bleachers Tuesday and flatly stated what everybody already knew: "Mission used 
to be an automatic win." 
</P>
<P>
Note the past tense. 
</P>
<P>
The Free Spirit, which launched successful comebacks against East Los Angeles, 
Valley and Pierce, once again had victory within its grasp against Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 6-3, Mission rallied for two runs in the seventh on consecutive 
singles by Chris Romo and Shawn Fontenot and a run-scoring single by Rich 
Ortiz. 
</P>
<P>
Mission reliever Jose Garcia issued consecutive walks to open the eighth before 
he was chased by Karp, who crushed a pitch over the right-field fence. Harbor 
added another run in the eighth and two more in the ninth for its final margin 
of victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an experienced team with a lot of sophomores," O'Brien said. "These 
guys don't fold if the game is close or we get behind." 
</P>
<P>
In defeat, Mission still demonstrated several of the elements that have made 
the Free Spirit a contender for the playoffs -- and possibly a conference 
title. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore left-hander Nick Lymberopoulos, who transferred from Canyons, held 
Harbor hitless for 4 2/3 innings before surrendering a double to Matt Nuez. 
</P>
<P>
Ortiz had three hits and Fontenot had two hits and drove in a run. 
</P>
<P>
Had it been any school except Harbor, probably the deepest team in the state, 
Mission might have scraped out another victory. But the Free Spirit will get a 
chance to avenge the defeat when Mission travels to Harbor on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Klitsner is confident that his team will continue to improve and that the Free 
Spirit is no longer a prisoner to its past. 
</P>
<P>
"People are saying Mission isn't going to quit and you hope that your kids buy 
into that," Klitsner said. "I'm not surprised at where we're at."

The financially troubled La Jolla Playhouse and the well-heeled Orange County 
Performing Arts Center have decided to become co-producers. 
</P>
<P>
Theater officials announced Tuesday that they will collaborate on a revival of 
"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum." 
</P>
<P>
The 1962 musical comedy, with score and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and a book 
by Burt Shevelove and Larry Gelbart, will play for six weeks at the Playhouse's 
492-seat Mandell Weiss Theatre, July 3-Aug. 12, followed by two weeks at the 
2,996-seat Costa Mesa Center, Aug. 17-26. 
</P>
<P>
"This bond we're forging with the Center is the wave of future," Playhouse 
artistic director Des McAnuff, who will stage the revival, said in a prepared 
statement. "We need inventive partnerships to produce (musicals because) 
they're beyond the scale of most theaters." 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit Playhouse had to raise $500,000 by last December to ensure that 
it could mount its six-play 1990 season. It managed $560,000 in donations and 
pledges, but must secure $500,000 more by June to achieve stability. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County center, though it too has nonprofit status and must raise 
funds to offset operating expenses, has been so financially successful by 
contrast that two years ago it was able to set aside $500,000 in a special 
account reserved just for investment in musical and/or dance productions. 
</P>
<P>
The center presents a five-play subscription offering called the Broadway 
Series, and officials there long have complained of a scarcity of well-produced 
touring shows. Previous investments with other organizations have included such 
revivals as "Strike Up the Band," "Anything Goes" and "Babes in Toyland," 
although not necessarily for subscription. "Forum" will be presented outside 
the Broadway Series. 
</P>
<P>
Neither McAnuff nor center president Thomas R. Kendrick would disclose the 
expected cost of the revival, but Kendrick said the Playhouse and the Center 
will be 
</P>
<P>
"50-50 partners in the capitalization of the production." The show is being 
designed only for the stages at La Jolla and Costa Mesa, they added, noting 
that a tour is "not under consideration." 
</P>
<P>
McAnuff, who has yet to cast "Forum," is no stranger to musicals. He staged the 
original "Big River" at the Playhouse in 1985 and won a Tony Award for 
directing it on Broadway, where it garnered five other Tonys, including the one 
for best musical. 
</P>
<P>
The original "Forum" opened on Broadway on May 8, 1962, starring Zero Mostel, 
and ran for 967 performances. It won six Tonys in 1963, including best musical 
and best actor. Ironically, Sondheim wasn't even nominated for the score and 
lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
Shevelove's and Gelbart's farcical book, very loosely inspired by the comic 
Roman writer Plautus, revolves around a slave trying to obtain his freedom by 
procuring a courtesan for his master. The most famous song associated with the 
show is the opening number, "Comedy Tonight." "Forum" was made into a movie in 
1966, also starring Mostel, and was revived on Broadway in 1972 with Phil 
Silvers. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, productions frequently have been done in California and across the 
country at all levels of expertise. 
</P>
<P>
When San Francisco's American Conservatory Theatre took a version to Stratford, 
Conn., last August, the troupe discovered three summer stock revivals being 
done in Connecticut alone. A professional version was staged at the Pasadena 
Civic Auditorium last June, and a touring revival starring Mickey Rooney played 
both the Pantages Theatre in Los Angeles and the Civic Theatre in San Diego in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
The reviving interest in "Forum" has coincided with Sondheim's increased 
acclaim, particularly in recent years. The show is not only one of his earliest 
-- the first to have both his score and his lyrics -- but is also one of his 
most accessible. Moreover, a production can be staged relatively economically 
for a musical because it requires just one set. 
</P>
<P>
McAnuff said he was unaware of the recent Southern California productions but 
that he doesn't think they will hurt the appeal of the Playhouse's production 
because "we'll do the physical comedy 1990-style." 
</P>
<P>
Further, he said, he will be doing "serious dramaturgical work" on the play -- 
which he rated as "one of the top 10 musicals" of the American theater -- and 
claimed that Sondheim, though not formally participating in the production, is 
"already giving advice" by telephone.

CUTLER FINDS HIS PLACE IN SUN WITH 'RAINDOGS' 
</P>

<P>
For Mark Cutler, making an album was a dream too long deferred. 
</P>
<P>
He had been primed since the early 1980s, when he began weaving excellent rock 
'n' roll in a small domain -- Rhode Island -- hoping that the bigger world 
would take notice and give him his chance. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, last year, the chance arrived. After fruitless and increasingly 
frustrating years as singer, songwriter and lead guitarist of the Schemers, one 
of those classic regional bands whose number never gets called in the great pop 
lottery, Cutler finally had found his ticket. 
</P>
<P>
His new band, Raindogs, had the sort of intriguing pedigree and unusual musical 
premise that was bound to draw attention. 
</P>
<P>
The Boston-based band -- which opens for Warren Zevon tonight at the Bacchanal 
-- began with a bassist and drummer, Darren Hill and Jim Reilly, who had played 
together in the New Orleans band, Red Rockers. 
</P>
<P>
Transplanted to Massachusetts, they decided to form a folk-tinged rock group 
that would reflect Hill's Louisiana roots and Reilly's Irish background (Reilly 
also played in the Belfast punk group, Stiff Little Fingers). In a fortunate 
accident, they stumbled upon Scottish fiddler Johnny Cunningham playing off by 
himself in a pub across the street from their Boston apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham was well-known in traditional folk circles for his work with the 
Celtic bands Silly Wizard and Relativity. But after hitting it off with Hill 
and Reilly, he bought into their dream of making Celtic sounds that rocked. 
Raindogs set about wooing Cutler as their songwriter and front man. He joined 
early in 1987, and later recruited Emerson Torrey, his long-time guitar partner 
from the Schemers, as the fifth Raindog. 
</P>
<P>
The result of all this multinational chemistry is a rock band that takes 
Cutler's root sources -- the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan and Hank Williams -- and 
transplants them on Wuthering Heights. Cunningham's highland fiddle darts and 
soars and twists, lending new dimension to Cutler's melodically inventive 
guitar rock. That sometimes sweet, sometimes stormy backdrop supports Cutler 
songs about the moral choices that await us at every turn -- the 
disappointments and derailments, the aspirations and unsatisfied hungers that 
make living such a precarious but involving business. 
</P>
<P>
By last May, signed to Atco Records, Cutler and the other Raindogs were in a 
New York City studio with Neil Dorfsman, producer of Dire Straits' "Brothers In 
Arms," one of the most successful albums of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Cutler was about to have his dream un-deferred in a big way. And then one of 
those stubborn moral choices he was always singing about popped off the lyric 
sheet and into his life. 
</P>
<P>
Early work on the album was not going well, Cutler, 32, recalled in a recent 
phone interview from a tour stop in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
"(Dorfsman) started hinting about wanting to bring other musicians in. It was 
obvious he didn't think of us as a band" with a group personality that wouldn't 
brook the use of studio aces as pinch hitters. 
</P>
<P>
That left Cutler in a dilemma. His own career album sales stood precisely at 
zero. Dorfsman, with a proven platinum touch, was telling him that by bringing 
in some polished outside expertise, he could have a hit. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Cutler said, one of the veteran musicians whom Dorfsman was 
thinking of bringing in, drummer Anton Fier, talked to all the Raindogs and 
laid out the moral choices in stark terms. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Mark, it's up to you whether you want to be famous and feel terrible 
for a few years, or stick up for your band.' " 
</P>
<P>
Cutler decided to stick up for the band. He placed a call to Atco, telling 
company bosses that the label's untested new band wanted to fire its proven, 
blue chip producer. 
</P>
<P>
Label head Derek Shulman was unruffled, Cutler said, and simply recommended a 
new producer, Englishman Peter Henderson, whose best known credits included 
Rush and Supertramp, two bands that had nothing in common with Raindogs. 
Recording at an inexpensive studio outside Boston, Raindogs finished its debut 
album, "Lost Souls," without further incident. 
</P>
<P>
"Lost Souls" never minimizes how painful it is to be playing out the innings of 
an unfair game. Even when Cutler tries to invoke a sense of home and hearth, on 
the countrified, splendidly melodic "This Is The Place," he starts thinking 
about the ghosts that haunt the tenement neighborhood he regards so fondly. 
</P>
<P>
With "May Your Heart Keep Beating," Cutler says he set out to write an 
affirmative benediction for the whole world: "May your heart keep beating, may 
your pulse stay strong/May you run for miles, may your life be long." But in 
creeps the uneasy, all-too-realistic clincher line that undermines those heroic 
hopes with a sense of life's inevitable frustration: "I used to run for miles 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
"You have to throw a little of the pain in there," Cutler said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Singing about such matters as moral crises and the nature of creative 
inspiration is not the conventional ticket to success in the music business. 
Cutler said he sometimes wonders whether his songs are too philosophical or 
abstract. 
</P>
<P>
"That always occurs to me. You do have doubts, 'Am I getting too heavy here?' I 
ask the guys in the band and they say, 'Yeah, it's heavy, but it's good."' 
</P>
<P>
Raindogs open for Warren Zevon tonight at 8:30 at the Bacchanal, 8022 
Clairemont Mesa Blvd., Tickets: $16.50. Information: (619) 560-8022.

ENDLESS STREAM OF IDEAS FLOWS FROM JAZZ PIANIST 
</P>

<P>
Hank Jones isn't the best known jazz pianist, but in his work you can hear how 
much he influenced the generations that followed him, such pianists as Tommy 
Flanagan, Kenny Barron and Barry Harris. 
</P>
<P>
During his first set last Thursday night at Elario's, Jones, the older brother 
of jazz drummer Elvin and trumpeter Thad, turned out an endless stream of ideas 
proving that, at 71, he deserves to be ranked among the greats. 
</P>
<P>
Jones doesn't rely on a raw physical attack like McCoy Tyner's. His creations 
aren't spacey and abstract like Cecil Taylor's, nor does Jones go in for a 
lightweight, romantic approach, like some young New Age-jazz types. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he uses his floating, feathery touch to produce a bright, clear sound, 
reminiscent at times of Barron. As a timekeeper, Jones has few equals. His 
swinging style always implies the beat, no matter how far his improvisations 
stray from home base. 
</P>
<P>
The pianist was in high spirits, bantering with the audience between songs, 
ending some numbers tongue- 
</P>
<P>
in-cheek by fading the piano down to such a whisper you weren't quite sure 
whether the music had stopped or not. All the while, Jones grinned at his 
listeners playfully. 
</P>
<P>
At times, his improvising was almost classical in its elegance, the melodic 
inventions flowing from his fingers so fully formed that they sounded like 
careful compositions. Most phrases had a beginning, middle and end, and, 
although Jones takes risks, he never seems to miss. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Jones hit "Star Eyes," San Diego drummer Jim Plank had joined local 
bassist Bob Magnusson after being delayed, and the trio quickly settled in. 
After rolling through this tune's Latin introduction, the group soon made the 
transition to a straight, driving beat, and Jones sent his right hand on a 
series of nimble ascents up the keyboard. His solo became increasingly complex, 
heading into freer, yet melodic, territory, then less-structured ideas. Plank 
kept the music simmering with delicate brush work. 
</P>
<P>
Along with a versatile right hand, Jones plays interesting left-hand 
variations. His left is concise but not forceful, and he keeps things 
interesting, changing from strings of single notes to progressions of chords. 
</P>
<P>
On Cole Porter's "Love for Sale," Jones' left grooved while his right found the 
signature melody in chords. On this tune and others, Jones showed a real knack 
for bluesy, funky swing, hanging just a little behind the beat when he wanted 
more grit. Magnusson bounced along stride for stride, sometimes plucking his 
strings forcefully enough to give them an audible snap. 
</P>
<P>
Jones's repertoire is an eclectic bag, indeed. Compositions by Duke Ellington, 
Mary Lou Williams and Toots Thielemans rounded out the set, along with the 
standard "On Green Dolphin Street." 
</P>
<P>
According to Magnusson, Jones is extremely well organized. He knows what he 
wants to play and how, and he supplies the musicians with his own detailed 
arrangements. This was evidenced by the consistency of the music. Although 
Jones had never played with the locals, the trio showed remarkable consistency 
over a variety of quirky beginnings, bridges and endings. 
</P>
<P>
Jones and company will be at Elario's nightly through Sunday.

DAVID PECK'S BUSHEL OF ROCK FOOTAGE IN HEAVY DEMAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS K. ARNOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Peck picked up a program from last January's annual Rock 'n' Roll Hall of 
Fame induction ceremony in New York City and proudly pointed to his name in the 
production credits. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave them footage of Simon and Garfunkel, the Four Seasons, the Kinks and 
the Platters," Peck said. "They called me up a few weeks before the show; I 
guess they got my name from somebody who'd heard of me and told them I'd 
probably have what they were looking for." 
</P>
<P>
None of this is very surprising. After six years of avid collecting, the 
23-year-old San Diegan is considered one of the foremost rock 'n' roll video 
archivists in the country. He's got more than 1,000 hours of vintage tapes, 
ranging from TV appearances and movie outtakes to promotional films and concert 
footage. 
</P>
<P>
Peck trades with, and occasionally buys from, collectors all over the world. 
From time to time, he puts on public screenings -- in San Diego and other 
cities around the country -- focusing on a particular era, genre or artist. 
</P>
<P>
Coinciding with the Warner Brothers Records release on compact disc of several 
old Jimi Hendrix albums, Peck has assembled a 90-minute program of the late 
guitar master's infrequent TV appearances. 
</P>
<P>
"Hendrix Live on TV: 1965-1970" will screen Thursday and Friday at San Diego 
State University's Backdoor. Among the dozen-plus clips included are a 1967 
performance on Belgian television of "Stone Free," a promo film of "Burning the 
Midnight Lamp" that aired on a French music show in 1968, and an eight-minute 
interview on the Dick Cavett show from 1969 in which Hendrix defends his 
controversial rendition of the national anthem three weeks earlier at 
Woodstock. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to start out with a rare clip of Hendrix playing guitar with 
Little Richard's band on a 1965 episode of 'Night Train,' a local Memphis rock 
show," Peck said. "That was before anybody knew who he was. He was a nobody, so 
they didn't really focus on him, but still, there are a few good shots." 
</P>
<P>
"Another rare clip is his appearance in 1969 on a British TV show, in which he 
refused to stop playing. It was a live broadcast, and he was told he could only 
perform 'Voodoo Child' and 'Hey Joe.' 
</P>
<P>
"But in the middle of 'Hey Joe,' he stops and goes, 'Hey, we're gonna stop 
playing this rubbish and dedicate a song to Cream,' and then he goes right into 
'Sunshine of Your Love.' 
</P>
<P>
"Now, you can't see the cameramen waving him off, but they are, and at one 
point he looks right into the camera -- you know he's making eye contact -- and 
says, 'Na.' He keeps playing, and then he leans over to (drummer) Mitch 
Mitchell and you can see him mouth the word slow." 
</P>
<P>
Peck's first public video show, "Rock on TV," took place in July, 1987, at the 
La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art. The program consisted of TV footage of the 
Beatles, the Kinks, the Who, the Rascals and other 1960s bands on such 
long-gone series as "Shindig," "Hullabaloo" and "The Ed Sullivan Show." 
</P>
<P>
Peck has since produced six more shows at the museum: "Soul on TV" in December, 
1987; "The Beatles: Rare Tapes" the following April and again in June; "Rare 
Stones: 1964-1974" in September, 1988; "Progressive Rock" last April, and 
"Troubadours of Rock" last June. 
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with the museum's film curator, Greg Kahn, and Reader pop music 
writer John D'Agostino, Peck has put on three rock-video shows at the Northwest 
Film and Video Center in Portland, Ore., and one at the Scottsdale Center for 
the Arts in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Peck recently decided to go it alone. 
</P>
<P>
"The museum isn't really that much into doing the shows anymore, because 
they're primarily an art museum, and John's real busy doing writing and stuff," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Peck said he already has several shows lined up, including a Rolling 
Stones-James Brown double-header at Webster University in St. Louis, a James 
Brown show at the Kennedy Center in Washington, and a blues and "Rock on TV" 
shows at the Athens (Ohio) Center for Film and Video. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sending out resumes right and left, and once they read my resume, they're 
usually interested on the spot," Peck said. "I'm also getting a lot of calls 
from TV production companies, asking for footage. 
</P>
<P>
"There's only so much of this stuff around, and I'm fortunate to have as much 
as I do." 
</P>
<P>

DIPLOMACY: TROOP MOVEMENTS WORRY WASHINGTON. THE WHITE HOUSE URGES MOSCOW TO 
USE CAUTION. SHEVARDNADZE RULES OUT THE USE OF FORCE.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration, deeply worried by Soviet troop movements in and around 
Lithuania, warned Moscow on Tuesday against creating an "atmosphere of 
intimidation and increasing tension" in the Baltic republic. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater issued the unusually tough 
statement, warning Moscow against using its army to enforce Soviet control of 
Lithuania, which declared its independence March 11. 
</P>
<P>
"The activities and statements of the Soviet government over the past few days 
are cause for concern," Fitzwater said, noting "troop movements that have been 
sighted along the border, around certain institutions (and) public facilities." 
</P>
<P>
"The United States notes that the Lithuanian government has expressed its 
readiness to address all legitimate Soviet interests, including economic 
interests, through negotiations," Fitzwater said, adding a call for "the Soviet 
government to address its concerns and interest through immediate negotiations 
with the government of Lithuania." 
</P>
<P>
Despite rumors in Lithuania, Soviet authorities deny that there have been any 
extraordinary or unscheduled troop movements in or near the republic. But on 
Monday, Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov ordered various government ministries 
to take steps to prevent the Lithuanians from disengaging their economy from 
that of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the Soviet Parliament have declared 
the Lithuanian assertion of independence illegal and invalid, and Gorbachev 
said that there can be no negotiations over the issue. But Lithuanian President 
Vytautas Landsbergis, acknowledging that his republic cannot survive 
economically if it wrenches itself away from the SovietUnion, continues to 
express confidence that there will be talks. 
</P>
<P>
In Windhoek, Namibia, where he met with Secretary of State James A. Baker III, 
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze sought to reassure the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"We are against the use of force in any region and particularly against using 
force domestically," Shevardnadze told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said he accepted the Soviet official's words. "The minister made it very 
clear to me that they are hopeful that questions involving Lithuania will be 
handled through dialogue," Baker said after his four-hour meeting with 
Shevardnadze. 
</P>
<P>
"He said that force would not be a solution to the problem," Baker added. "I 
thought he was fairly definitive. . . . There is no reason that we know of not 
to take him at his word." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, however, Administration officials were voicing a far more 
skeptical line. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet use of force against the Lithuanians would "kill perestroika with the 
West" and complicate negotiations on issues from arms control to German 
unification, an Administration official said. Perestroika is the term used to 
describe the economic and political reform effort under way in the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
A forcible suppression of the Lithuanian independence movement would raise 
again the fears, for now subdued, that the Soviet leadership "is a bear that 
really hasn't filed down its fangs," the official added. 
</P>
<P>
As one of the republics that make up the Soviet Union, Lithuania has a separate 
government with limited powers. That government is now controlled by 
pro-independence forces. Although the United States has not formally recognized 
the new government as an independent sovereign state, American officials never 
officially accepted Soviet rule over the region, which was taken over by the 
Soviet army during World War II after a deal was struck with Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, the Administration official said, had specifically raised the 
issue of the use of force in the Baltics when he met with Gorbachev in Malta in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
"The President raised the issue of self-determination" and "noted the use of 
force would be counterproductive," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, in turn, assured Bush that force would not be used. He and other 
Soviet officials have repeated that pledge since then, even after the 
Lithuanian assertion of independence. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Gorbachev have not specifically discussed the situation in Lithuania, 
Latvia and Estonia, the three Baltic Republics, since their Malta meeting. But, 
said Fitzwater, the Soviets "are aware of our position" through other 
diplomatic contacts. 
</P>
<P>
For the last several days, the Administration had been taking a hands-off 
stance toward Lithuania, hoping that negotiations leading to a peaceful 
settlement would soon begin between Moscow and Landsbergis' pro-independence 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, commenting to reporters before a meeting with congressional leaders 
Tuesday morning, repeated that hope. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been very good about it -- the Soviets have -- all through Eastern 
Europe," the President said. "That's what everyone wants to see, a peaceful 
evolution in Lithuania." 
</P>
<P>
But the Soviet troop deployments around Lithuania have sent a shudder through 
the Administration, which has invested substantial political and diplomatic 
resources in supporting Gorbachev and his reform efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The United States appears willing in some situations to accept the Kremlin's 
use of its armed forces to put down internal unrest. Earlier this year, for 
example, Administration officials offered generally supportive statements about 
the use of troops to end unrest in Soviet Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania, however, is a "different case," the Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're tied down with the political aspects of 40 years" of U.S. statements 
supporting Lithuanian independence, this official said. In addition, the 
movements for independence in the Baltic states enjoy considerable support 
among their neighbors in Eastern Europe, the official noted. 
</P>
<P>
Widespread violence in Azerbaijan and neighboring Armenia allowed the Soviets 
to claim their military presence was needed to restore order in that situation. 
In Lithuania, however, the independence movement has been peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
Although partially overshadowed by the concern about Lithuania, the meeting 
between Baker and Shevardnadze concentrated on German reunification and Third 
World issues. 
</P>
<P>
Officials on both sides said the talks, which took place at the home of the 
U.S. ambassador to Namibia on a hill overlooking Windhoek, were part of the 
complex process of fixing the agenda for Bush's summit meeting with Gorbachev, 
tentatively scheduled for Washington in June. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said that at least two more such foreign minister-level meetings 
will be required, the first scheduled for April 4-6 in Washington and the 
second, not yet set, presumably in the Soviet Union. The two men largely left 
arms control matters for those later meetings.

CENSUS BEGINS WITH THE NATION'S HOMELESS; 
</P>
<P>
COUNT: 15,000 FAN OUT FOR MONUMENTAL OVERNIGHT TASK. MANY MEET DIFFICULTIES. 
INCOMPLETE COUNT EXPECTED. 
</P>

<P>
The 1990 U.S. census began Tuesday night on a somber note, as census takers set 
out to measure the size of a successful nation's conspicuous failure -- its 
population of homeless citizens. 
</P>
<P>
With a budget of $2.7 million and a staff approaching 15,000, the U.S. Census 
Bureau attempted to count on one night a population that has been estimated to 
number anywhere from 250,000 to more than 3 million. Census takers went to 
11,000 shelters and an equal number of outdoor haunts, from heating grates in 
New York City to San Francisco's Golden Gate Park; from river banks in Colorado 
to "spider holes" -- man-made burrows in Southern California canyons. 
</P>
<P>
The monumental effort marked the first time the census has counted homeless 
people separate from the rest of the population, most of whom are to receive 
census forms in the mail later this week. 
</P>
<P>
Counting the homeless was not expected to go smoothly, and it didn't. 
Throughout the day, there were glitches and missed opportunities by the score. 
</P>
<P>
In Vermont, 22 inches of snow slowed the count. In Detroit, there weren't 
nearly enough census takers to take inventory of the army of squatters living 
in the city's 10,000 abandoned buildings. There were plenty of people who 
refused to be counted, and a few who caused consternation by the answers they 
gave to the census. 
</P>
<P>
In New York City, there was a man who insisted he is Jesus Christ. 
</P>
<P>
"He was nice and cooperative," said census taker Craig Lebin, "but he kept 
telling me he was married to God." 
</P>
<P>
Census officials conceded their count of homeless people is not expected to be 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
At a Washington press conference Tuesday, Census Bureau director Barbara Bryant 
said that while the homeless count would not be exhaustive, it will "get the 
vast majority . . . these numbers will be believable. Is it hundreds of 
thousands? Is it millions? We're going to show that kind of scope." 
</P>
<P>
Byrant herself, however, encountered evidence of flaws in the counting. She 
toured New York's Port Authority bus terminal, where she found at least 100 
homeless persons -- but no census takers to count them. Bryant promised to 
dispatch counters to the terminal tonight. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, John Reeder, head of the Census Bureau's California operations, 
said the count would be a conservative one. 
</P>
<P>
Reeder said the bureau was prepared to continue counting homeless people every 
night this week if it became apparent Tuesday that there were more people than 
the census takers could handle. 
</P>
<P>
But he made it clear census takers would not take certain risks. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going on rooftops, looking in abandoned cars or peering into 
dumpsters," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the novel exercise was shaping up as an all-night, national 
spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, the census takers, wary of ambush, planned 
to keep to the park's lighted perimeters, calling out for any homeless persons 
hiding in the bushes to come forward and be counted. 
</P>
<P>
In the nation's capital, wary homeless advocates were attempting to thwart the 
census, refusing to allow counters inside a shelter where more than 1,000 
homeless were said to have congregated. 
</P>
<P>
In Detroit, several homeless people telephoned the Census Bureau from the 
office of a wrecking company, where they said they had broken in to spend the 
night. They invited census takers to come out and count them. Five enumerators 
were dispatched, and the survey was completed with the promise that police 
would not be informed of the callers' whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
And in Los Angeles, buses were being hastily arranged to haul homeless from the 
rougher streets of South-Central to armories and emergency shelters for 
counting. 
</P>
<P>
Reeder said that six units of U.S. naval reservists would be patrolling the 
streets of Los Angeles to help ensure the safety of census takers. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we are concerned about security. We cannot take police because it 
would breach confidentiality," he said. But he added that there would be an 
increased police presence on the streets of the city while the homeless census 
was in progress. 
</P>
<P>
In big cities, small towns and everywhere else American homeless congregate, it 
was clear Tuesday evening that the census takers had their work cut out for 
them. Finding the homeless posed one major difficulty, convincing them to 
cooperate was another. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want them countin' me," said a man named Jesse, standing beside the 
tarp covered lean-to he shares with his friend Marco Katz on the banks of the 
Platte River about a fourth of a mile from downtown Denver. 
</P>
<P>
"I came back from 'Nam and they called me a baby killer, so I don't want them 
counting me," Jesse said. 
</P>
<P>
In Houston, a pony-tailed young man named James, who declined to reveal his 
last name, said the census takers' questions "stunk. A lot of the questions 
didn't apply to us -- like, 'Are you here on business or vacation.' " 
</P>
<P>
Toni Davis, 32, worried that census questions would probe too deeply into her 
past. Davis said that she and her husband were prospering from a methadrine 
lab, allowing them and their five children to own a house, "until we were 
arrested." She said that the census form asked "whether we had income from this 
or this. They didn't ask about illegal activities," she said with a sigh of 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
The all-night homeless census took place in three phases. From 6 p.m. to 
midnight, census takers went to armories, shelters, missions, church basements, 
flop houses and hotels that cost $12 or less a night. 
</P>
<P>
Between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m., the effort focused on bus stations, night owl 
theaters, subways, bridges, highway underpasses and the myriad outdoor 
locations favored by the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
In the final phase, lasting until 8 a.m., the census takers were to station 
themselves near dumpsters and abandoned building, waiting to interview people 
as they emerged in the morning light. 
</P>
<P>
Census Bureau officials said that people found asleep on the streets were not 
to be wakened. Instead, census takers were to note their presence and try to 
guess sex and race. 
</P>
<P>
California presented a host of challenges to census takers who were responsible 
for canvassing streets and parks frequented by gangs and drug dealers as well 
as making their way to the river banks, canyons, beaches and orange groves that 
provide hideouts to the rural homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the obstacles, the homeless count was the most ambitious ever 
undertaken. To entice the homeless to come in out of the cold and be counted, 
emergency shelters were opened around the country. Soup kitchens offered free 
dinners and shelters gave away blankets to people who showed up Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Traveling in teams, carrying walkie-talkies, wearing uniform vests, census 
takers attempted to count people in every city with a population of 50,000 or 
more and in smaller cities where local governments provided lists of homeless 
habitats. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Taeuber, who coordinated the nationwide homeless census from the bureau's 
Washington headquarters, said she was more confident of the accuracy of 
counting in shelters and other indoor locations and somewhat pessimistic about 
finding people in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"We just haven't been able to come up with a reliable means of coming to grips 
with the hidden homeless," she said. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the homeless census, the Census Bureau funded monitoring operations 
in five cities, including Los Angeles. The monitors were stationed in a number 
of outdoor homeless enclaves to check whether census takers actually visited 
those locations and to assess how diligent they were when they did visit. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. census is taken every decade. A decision on whether to count homeless 
separately every decade has not been made. 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau received widespread cooperation from shelters and homeless 
advocates. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the Homeless Outreach Program in Los Angeles and Los Caballeros, 
a businessmen's organization, sponsored a dinner for 1,000 homeless people, 
served them steak and pudding pie and urged them to take part in the census. 
</P>
<P>
Census takers were welcomed at the Miami Rescue Mission, a 250-bed building and 
the largest transient shelter in Florida. But the manager, Stan Cagle, said he 
didn't think the Census Bureau had done enough to alert homeless people to the 
count. 
</P>
<P>
"They say, 'What's this all about?' And I just tell them to do it," Cagle said. 
"I don't think the bureaucrats on the street did enough on the street to 
explain what the census is for." 
</P>
<P>
In some cases misinformation about the census caused people to be left out. In 
Alondra Park, outside Los Angeles, a group of about 25 men who had read about 
the census in a Spanish-language newspaper arrived to be counted at 10 a.m. -- 
eight hours ahead of time. 
</P>
<P>
After an hour of panhandling, the group gathered money to purchase some beer. 
When they ran out at 1 p.m., the men became disgruntled, lost interest in the 
census and wandered away. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Monica's Memorial Park, census takers arrived to count homeless 
congregated at a temporary shelter only to discover that they had forgotten a 
crucial tool: their pencils. 
</P>
<P>
There also were protests by people who do not believe that a complete count is 
possible and who believe that an undercount will be used to justify spending 
cuts for affordable housing and for the social services that many homeless 
people rely on. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, members of the Community for Creative Non-Violence dumped sand 
in front of the Commerce Department's Herbert Hoover Building near the White 
House and displayed a banner that read, "Like Grains of Sand, the Homeless 
Cannot Be Counted." 
</P>
<P>
Just before 8 p.m., a contingent of census workers were turned away from a 
shelter operated by the Community for Creative Non-Violence, an organization 
formed by Mitch Snyder, one of the nation's prominent homeless advocates. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder, who sees the homeless count as a political ploy to understate the 
national problem, estimated that there were 1,400 people at the center in 
northwest Washington. However, Snyder said that about 80 of the shelter's 
residents filled out census forms, and he turned over the completed forms to a 
Census Bureau official. 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, Stephen Switzer, a spokesman for the Homeless Organizing 
Committee, said he thought the count was likely to find only 15% to 20% of the 
homeless. Switzer said that many who live in the brush and on the banks of the 
Sacramento and American Rivers have been intimidated by recent police sweeps of 
their camps and would not emerge to take part in the census. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout Northern California about 1,000 white-vested census takers were 
provided with the addresses of more than 40 shelters and cheap hotels and 60 
outdoor locations. In San Francisco, more than 200 census takers set out to 
count a homeless population that has been estimated at 5,000 to 10,000, many of 
whom reside among the bushes of the city's sprawling Golden Gate Park. 
</P>
<P>
In the southern part of the state, about 2,000 census takers attempted to cover 
over 3,200 places where homeless people are known to live. About 1,000 census 
takers fanned out across Los Angeles in an effort to count an estimated 35,000 
homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles has spent close to $1 million on efforts to publicize 
the census and to ensure all its citizens are counted.

Questions for the Homeless 
</P>
<P>
Census-takers seeking to count the nation's homeless Tuesday carried a list of 
33 questions to ask of those who chose to cooperate. Among the questions were: 
</P>
<P>
When did you come to the United States to stay? 
</P>
<P>
Have you ever been on active duty military service in the armed forces of the 
United States? 
</P>
<P>
Do you have a physical, mental or other health condition that has lasted for 
six or more months and . . . prevents you from working at a job? 
</P>
<P>
Because of a health condition that has lasted for six or more months, do you 
have any difficulty going outside alone (or) taking care of your own personal 
needs, such as bathing, dressing or getting around inside the home? 
</P>
<P>
How many babies have you ever had, not counting stillbirths? 
</P>
<P>
When did you last work, even for a few days? 
</P>

BONN MOVES TO STEM FLOOD OF EAST GERMANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
BONN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The West German government announced Tuesday that, in hopes of discouraging 
would-be immigrants, it will crack down on benefits extended to East Germans 
moving to the federal republic. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the benefits will be withdrawn July 1, the government said. But Bonn 
officials added that the government expects the weak East German ostmark to be 
replaced by the West German deutschemark this summer -- under terms favorable 
for millions of East Germans now worried about the future value of their 
savings. 
</P>
<P>
They said that West Germany expects to agree on a currency union with East 
Germany by May 1, although they did not spell out how that would be achieved. 
</P>
<P>
Such a step would presumably remove the pressure that many East Germans feel to 
resettle in West Germany as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said that to discourage 
would-be East German immigrants, Bonn will ask Parliament to repeal a 1950 law 
setting up the benefits program under which 4.5 million people have been 
resettled in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Schaeuble declared that currency union would bring with it economic and social 
union, thus making East Germany a much more desirable place to live until full 
German reunification. 
</P>
<P>
"With these measures," Schaeuble said, "the need for a reception procedure will 
disappear." 
</P>
<P>
Schaeuble said West Germany wants to send a "psychological signal" to East 
Germans thinking about moving to the West and that it is possible those who had 
already come over would be encouraged to return voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that the dozens of reception camps in West Germany that 
temporarily house incoming East Germans will be closed by July 1. At that time, 
East German immigrants will no longer receive the immediate cash gift of $120 
or be eligible for loans of up to $2,400. Instead, they will be treated the 
same as West Germans who move inside the country. 
</P>
<P>
The settlers will still be allowed "assimilation money" of about $600, since 
that one-time payment, introduced in January, is considered less expensive than 
alternative health and unemployment benefits. East Germans settlers already 
receiving social assistance apparently won't be affected. 
</P>
<P>
About 344,000 East Germans looking for freedom and a better life moved to the 
federal republic last year after first Hungary and then Czechoslovakia opened 
their borders with the West, sparking an exodus that led to an economic crisis 
in East Germany. That crisis in turn brought down the hard-line Communist 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
About 145,000 East Germans have already arrived this year, a rate of more than 
1,800 a day. But West German officials said Tuesday that in the 24-hour period 
after Sunday's first free elections in East Germany, the rate of newcomers 
dropped significantly: 1,593 registered at reception camps, versus 2,712 in the 
same period a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
However, some West German state officials complained that the Bonn government's 
action comes too late to ease the burden of caring for thousands of settlers 
and that it should have been made effective long before July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition Social Democratic leader Oskar Lafontaine declared: "If it is true, 
as members of the government constantly repeat, that many people in East 
Germany are still sitting on their suitcases, then the date set must be like an 
invitation to more settlers." 
</P>
<P>
The Saarland state, of which Lafontaine is premier, or governor, announced that 
it would enact such anti-settler measures immediately. Bremen, which is a land 
(state) as well as a city, already has taken that step. 
</P>
<P>
Other state premiers also said the deadline should be moved up from July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Harald Viss, a West Berlin official, predicted Tuesday that there will be an 
increase in the number of settlers in the coming days as East Germans rush to 
beat the July 1 deadline.

VAN DE KAMP TV ADS FOCUS ON DEATH ROW, WILL AIR TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp joins the battle of the advertising airwaves 
tonight with a commercial that brashly credits him with keeping San Quentin's 
Death Row full to the brim. The lagging Democratic contender is the last of the 
big-three would-be governors to undertake an advertising campaign in this state 
where media advertising is crucial. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-second television commercial presents Van de Kamp as a champion of four 
issues that have emerged as important elements of his campaign -- gun control, 
the death penalty and his ballot initiatives on the environment and 
governmental ethics. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign manager Richard Ross described the elements of the commercial on the 
eve of its airing in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento. Next, it is to 
spread to San Diego and the state's lesser television markets. 
</P>
<P>
Most eye-catching and eyebrow-raising is the commercial's reference to the 
death penalty and its background footage of the gas chamber. The announcer 
declares that as two-term district attorney of Los Angeles County and two-term 
attorney general of California, Van de Kamp "put or kept 277 murderers on Death 
Row," virtually its entire condemned population. 
</P>
<P>
This presumably has two goals: To catch the rising wave of public attention on 
the death penalty, now that California's first contemporary execution is 
scheduled to occur in two weeks. Also, it is to show that Van de Kamp is 
hard-line on the emotional subject even while critics seek to fault his 
personal opposition to capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
One of Van de Kamp's most dramatic campaign moments so far was his appearance 
last year before the state Assembly with an AK-47 rifle as he argued for a ban 
on assault rifles. This event introduces the commercial, and the announcer 
notes that Van de Kamp was sued by the National Rifle Assn. for his efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The commercial says that Van de Kamp is sponsor of a major environmentalist 
ballot proposal to crack down on "cancer-causing pesticides" and to protect the 
coast. The on-screen image for viewers shifts to Time magazine, which uses the 
nickname 'Big Green" for the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the advertisement mentions Van de Kamp's sponsorship of an 
ethics-in-government initiative, which would limit the terms of office for 
state politicians. 
</P>
<P>
The tag-line or slogan is: "Take a stand -- John Van de Kamp." 
</P>
<P>
Commercials are being watched extra closely this year because of the early 
success achieved by Van de Kamp's Democratic rival, Dianne Feinstein. She went 
on the air first with a powerful biographical commercial just at a time when 
Van de Kamp's campaign seemed to lose its focus. The result was dramatic -- she 
surged ahead in the polls and he slipped badly. Feinstein still remains on the 
air in smaller markets. 
</P>
<P>
Republican Pete Wilson, the two-term U.S. senator who has no serious opposition 
for the GOP nomination, nonetheless joined the advertising fray last week with 
a 60-second biographical spot. It also remains on the air. 
</P>
<P>
So far, all the candidates are following the conventional political advertising 
path. That is, their opening ads seek to define their own campaigns. Next down 
this path, the candidates can be expected to switch to the attack.

Guam's law, signed by Gov. Joseph Ada on Monday, is the most restrictive 
abortion legislation in the United States and has riveted national attention on 
this tiny South Pacific island. 
</P>
<P>
The law makes it a felony to perform an abortion even in cases of rape, incest 
and fetal abnormality. An abortion is allowed only if two independent doctors 
determine a pregnancy would endanger the life of a mother or gravely impair her 
health. 
</P>
<P>
It also makes it a misdemeanor to have an abortion or "knowingly solicit" 
pregnant women to have one. 
</P>
<P>
In the complaint filed in Superior Court here, Atty. Gen. Elizabeth 
Barrett-Anderson said that Janet Benshoof, director of the Reproductive Rights 
Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, violated the law when she 
encouraged pregnant women seeking abortions to leave Guam for Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett-Anderson had previously advised both the governor and the Guam 
Legislature that the abortion law was unconstitutional and said Tuesday that 
her action was designed to force a constitutional test. 
</P>
<P>
"My decision to bring a criminal charge under the new law will provide the 
basis for the courts to decide the question as quickly as possible. I believe 
this will be in the best interests of the government and of all persons 
affected by the new law," Barrett-Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Voters in Guam have an opportunity to repeal the legislation in a referendum 
scheduled in November. The law was passed by the territorial Legislature after 
the archbishop of Guam had threatened to excommunicate those who opposed the 
measure, although most of the legislators said they were unaware of the threat. 
More than 90% of the population on the island is Roman Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
In signing the legislation on Monday, Gov. Ada had insisted the law was a local 
issue. "I am not taking this action today to affect anyone's life in the 50 
states. I believe that this is a community issue and a community concern, first 
and foremost." 
</P>
<P>
But abortion foes and abortion rights supporters have seized upon the law as a 
possible test of the Supreme Court's willingness to temper or undo its historic 
Roe vs. Wade decision, which guaranteed women a right to an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Idaho and Maryland are currently studying abortion legislation, but the Guam 
law caught activists by surprise. Benshoof arrived in Guam over the weekend 
proclaiming that the new statute cannot coexist with Roe vs. Wade and likened 
the bill to a "Pearl Harbor for women." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday she acknowledged that she was breaking the law in providing the 
name, address and phone number of a Honolulu group that could help women get an 
abortion. The attorney general's complaint was filed Tuesday afternoon. 
Benshoof's arraignment was set for today.

DOLE PROPOSES TOUGHER SAFEGUARDS FOR PENSIONS; 
</P>
<P>
RETIREMENT: SECRETARY OF LABOR SUGGESTS A BOUNTY FOR THOSE WHO DISCLOSE LAW 
VIOLATIONS. SHE ALSO WANTS AUDITORS TO REPORT ANY ILLEGALITIES THEY FIND.

Labor Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole, seeking to combat fraud and abuse in 
the nation's $1.7-trillion pension industry, Tuesday proposed paying a bounty 
to people who report violations of federal pension laws. 
</P>
<P>
Under Dole's proposal, anyone supplying information on violations to the Labor 
Department would be awarded up to 10% of the penalty collected by the 
government. Similar rewards for reporting wrongdoing are offered by the 
Internal Revenue Service and the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was part of a package of steps outlined by Dole to toughen the 
enforcement of laws protecting the retirement benefits of 76 million workers 
and retirees in nearly 900,000 pension plans. 
</P>
<P>
Dole said that the department will also ask Congress to double the civil fine 
for violations and require accountants to report illegal activity uncovered 
during routine pension audits. Earlier this year, the department said that 100 
investigators will be added to monitor pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
Many of Dole's enforcement proposals were suggested last year by the 
department's inspector general, who said that fraud losses have risen sharply 
at pensions funds in recent years as the department's enforcement program has 
weakened. 
</P>
<P>
He touched off a controversy by comparing potential fraud in pension funds with 
the problems of the savings and loan industry. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't even begin to make that kind of comparison, and the (pension) system 
is healthy," Dole said at a breakfast session with Times reporters. "But we're 
going to do what we can to be ahead of the curve in terms of trying to provide 
more enforcement personnel and making sure that we do (halt) this fraud and 
deception to the extent that we can." 
</P>
<P>
Dole said also that a crackdown will continue on businesses where young 
teen-agers are working illegally. Last week, Labor Department investigators 
staged a three-day nationwide sweep that found 7,000 violations of child labor 
laws. Most involved 14- and 15-year-olds who cannot work during school hours, 
from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. or more than 18 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed that was the best way you could get people's attention and educate 
them as to what the laws are," Dole said, adding that such sweeps will be 
repeated and that the department is examining ways to increase the fines for 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
Dole said abuses have grown in recent years as employers have been forced to 
rely more on young workers because the adult work force is declining. "They 
can't get enough workers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Dole's proposals for tougher enforcement of pension laws were delivered Tuesday 
to Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), chairman of a House subcommittee that heard 
testimony last year on problems in the industry. Most of the proposals, 
including instituting the bounty, require congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
"I am delighted that Secretary Dole is willing to make the commitment of 
personnel and tougher enforcement of the law to begin solving these critical 
problems," Lantos said. "Pensions are not dessert for retired Americans. 
Pensions mean three good meals a day." 
</P>
<P>
Dole said that the bounty program was designed to encourage participants and 
beneficiaries of pension plans to bring evidence of abuses to the Department of 
Labor. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the department proposed changes that would make it easier for 
people to bring lawsuits against pension plans, including requiring courts to 
reimburse successful plaintiffs for fees to lawyers and expert witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
The inspector general's office has proposed requiring outside auditors who 
examine pension plans to report illegal activities they uncover. The proposal 
has been opposed by employers and accountants. Currently, auditors are required 
to disclose illegal activity only if they determine it has a significant impact 
on the plan's financial health.

INTERIOR WILL RETURN REMAINS OF INDIANS TO TRIBES, LUJAN SAYS

Saying the skeletal remains of Indians belong to their tribes, Interior 
Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. on Tuesday ordered plans drawn for returning to 
tribes the bodies from thousands of Indian burial sites under the jurisdiction 
of five Interior agencies. 
</P>
<P>
He also called on the Defense Department, the Agriculture Department and the 
Environmental Protection Agency to join in helping prevent further looting of 
Indian burial grounds on public lands. 
</P>
<P>
"From now on, our policies will affirm the rights of American Indian groups to 
determine the handling of their remains," Lujan said. 
</P>
<P>
As much as a change in federal policy, Lujan's announcement was intended to 
stress disapproval of the public display of Indian remains by thousands of 
privately owned museums across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan ordered the National Park Service to develop specific steps to implement 
the policy and called on each Interior agency to inventory remains in its 
custody. The remains of perhaps thousands of Indians are held by the five 
agencies: the Park Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of 
Reclamation, the Bureau of Land Management and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Indians' movement to recover the remains took Lujan's 
announcement as a positive step but suggested that a new law will be required 
before all the federal agencies return the remains. 
</P>
<P>
Under a 1979 statute, such remains are considered "archeological resources" and 
are required to be permanently preserved in a suitable public institution. 
Three bills now pending before Congress would remove the bodies of Indians from 
the archeological resource category. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Echo Hawk of the Native American Rights Fund estimated that federal 
agencies may have the remains of as many as 100,000 American Indians, many of 
them in agencies such as the Agriculture Department and the Tennessee Valley 
Authority, which are beyond the reach of the Interior policy announced by 
Lujan.

MUDDY WATERS FLOOD FLORIDA'S PANHANDLE, FORCE 2,000 TO FLEE

<P>
Muddy waters surging through Florida's Panhandle region on Tuesday forced more 
than 2,000 people to flee their homes, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,500 people were evacuated in three Florida counties flooded by the 
rising Choctawhatchee River and about 500 others were moved from other 
Panhandle river basins flooded by runoff from Alabama and Georgia, where heavy 
rains fell last week. 
</P>
<P>
The worst flooding in the South was in Alabama. At Selma, about 500 people were 
evacuated Tuesday as the Alabama River became a miles-wide lake. 
</P>
<P>
At Elmwood Cemetery in Selma, about half a dozen coffins popped out of the 
ground Monday. Workers in rowboats tied them to trees to keep them from 
floating away.

OATH-TAKING CAPS 30-YEAR STRUGGLE FOR NUJOMA

WINDHOEK, Namibia

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Sam Nujoma took the oath as president of this newborn nation today, it 
marked the end of a personal battle for liberation that began almost exactly 30 
years ago when the rebel leader slipped out of the territory to launch a bush 
war against South African colonialists. 
</P>
<P>
Nujoma, a stocky man of 60 years with a thick white beard, has been called 
uneducated and ruthless by his opponents and a kindly man of the people by his 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
A former assistant and now political opponent has said Nujoma is "a very dull 
person, basically." But Nujoma's closest comrades in the South-West Africa 
People's Organization describe him as a charismatic leader with shrewd 
political skills who has survived several challenges to his leadership while in 
exile. 
</P>
<P>
Nujoma has been welcomed since his return to Namibia six months ago as a 
conquering hero, especially in the most populous north, home of his Owambo 
people and the center of SWAPO's support. His cherubic, smiling face looks out 
from posters, flags and T-shirts all across the country. And his speeches have 
drawn tens of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel Shaffishuna Nujoma, whose formal education ended with primary school, 
got his start in politics in the late 1950s, when he was fired from his job as 
a steward on the South African railway for union activity. When the Windhoek 
municipality decided to relocate blacks near the city to what is now the 
township of Katutura, Nujoma joined a resistance movement that led to the 
police massacre of 13 demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
Nujoma spent a week in jail for his part in the protest, was released and fled 
the country in April, 1960, appearing in New York a few months later to testify 
before the United Nations. He was the founding president of SWAPO in 1960 and 
helped push through a U.N. resolution that declared South African control over 
Namibia illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Pretoria had fought the U.N. resolution, contending that SWAPO leaders were in 
self-imposed exile. To test South Africa's claim, Nujoma and a colleague 
chartered a plane to Windhoek in 1966. He was arrested at the airport and 
deported the next day. 
</P>
<P>
When the World Court overruled the U.N. decision, Nujoma launched SWAPO's armed 
struggle. Seven years later, the World Court reversed itself, but South Africa 
refused to relinquish control. 
</P>
<P>
Nujoma's SWAPO, a liberation movement little known outside of Africa, did not 
have an enviable record in its war against the South African army. In 23 years 
of war, Nujoma's ill-equipped fighters, operating from the desolate wilderness 
of southern Angola, suffered about 20,000 casualties. 
</P>
<P>
Nujoma himself spent his years in exile traveling the world to plead for money 
for his cause. His image was boosted in 1978, when the United Nations declared 
SWAPO the "sole and authentic representative" of the Namibian people. (It was a 
declaration that the United Nations was forced to ignore last year in order to 
maintain its objectivity in the elections, in which SWAPO was one of 10 parties 
participating.) 
</P>
<P>
But Nujoma almost scuttled the entire peace process last April when he sent 
several hundred of his fighters into the country as dawn broke on the first day 
of the U.N.-supervised timetable for independence. About 300 SWAPO troops were 
slaughtered in the ensuing week while Nujoma was denying that his fighters had 
entered Namibia. The fighting ended when he ordered his troops to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
Now Nujoma urges Namibians to lay aside their past differences and work 
together for the future of the country.

BAKER REPORTS GAIN IN ENDING ANGOLA WAR

<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III met Tuesday with Angolan President Jose 
Eduardo dos Santos and reported substantial progress toward bringing an end to 
the long-running civil war between U.S. and Soviet-backed armies there. 
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos told Baker he is ready to drop preconditions and agree to an early 
cease-fire in the war that has pitted the Angolan government, backed by the 
Soviets, against U.S.-backed insurgents of the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola (UNITA). A cease-fire could take effect within several 
days, a senior U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
The official said he does not know if Moscow has persuaded Dos Santos to ease 
his position but noted that Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze met 
Monday with Dos Santos. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, after a meeting between Baker and Shevardnadze, the Soviet 
minister said it is time for Washington and Moscow "to go from just mutual 
understanding to cooperation" and that the superpowers' joint efforts to bring 
independence to Namibia could serve as a model for future actions in the Third 
World. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said that a joint effort might help solve conflicts in Afghanistan 
and Angola. However, a senior U.S. official said later that the two men did not 
reach any specific agreements concerning either conflict. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official, who sat in on the meeting, said that the Angolan president 
previously had demanded that rebel leader Jonas Savimbi agree to at least the 
broad outlines of an overall settlement before a truce in the latest round of 
fighting, which began late last year. The official said that Dos Santos now 
seems to agree with the United States that "a cease-fire is a prerequisite for 
political negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
Also, the official said, Dos Santos exhibited more flexibility on all issues of 
the Angolan peace process than he has in the past. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Baker told Dos Santos that Washington is ready to upgrade its 
diplomatic relations with Angola "in the context of national reconciliation" 
between the government and UNITA. The United States and Angola now have no 
formal diplomatic ties. 
</P>
<P>
Baker also conferred with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak about the stalled 
Middle East peace process, although both men conceded that nothing can be done 
until Israel ends its present government crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters, Mubarak made clear his frustration at Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's refusal to go along with a complex peace formula 
advanced by Baker.

LEADERS OF SOVIET PARTY SAY SPLIT IS INEVITABLE; 
</P>

COMMUNISTS: TWO OR MORE BRANCHES ARE FORESEEN AFTER A CONGRESS IN JULY. 
GORBACHEV'S CRITICS SAY HE IS WEAKENING IDEOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS.

<P>
Leaders of the Soviet Communist Party, themselves deeply divided over 
fundamental principles as well as the course of the nation's political and 
economic reforms, say that a split in the party that has ruled the country for 
more than 70 years is now inevitable, the party newspaper Pravda reported 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In an angry debate over the party's strategic goals and basic policies, members 
of the policy-making Central Committee predicted with little qualification that 
the Communist Party will break into two, or perhaps more, parties following its 
congress in July. 
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev came under harsh attack at the same time for his 
advocacy of "democratic humane socialism" and "common human values," rather 
than "class struggle" and "dictatorship of the proletariat," as the ideological 
basis for his reforms, according to accounts of the speeches at last week's 
Central Committee meeting. 
</P>
<P>
This had been "a clear concession to those who want not to revise but liquidate 
outright -- to liquidate outright -- the ideological foundation of our party," 
Gorbachev was told by one regional party leader. 
</P>
<P>
He was accused of allowing the destruction of the party's ideological 
foundation, if not participating in it himself, and turning the party away from 
communism even as a distant and perhaps rhetorical goal. Another participant 
charged Gorbachev with abetting an effort "to destroy the party from within" by 
weakening its ideological rigor and searching for expedient solutions. 
</P>
<P>
Such great differences have developed among the party's 18.8 million members 
that the long-cherished principle of party unity, which has helped to keep the 
Communists in power here, is all but dead, speaker after speaker contended at 
the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as there is a party platform and rules, a split is inevitable," Yuri 
A. Prokofiev, the Moscow party first secretary, told the Central Committee, 
according to Pravda. "And by now it is clear that the Communist Party can no 
longer be considered the party of the entire people because, were it so, it 
would have to express the interests of those who no longer subscribe to 
socialism but are still among us." 
</P>
<P>
The party is already breaking into factions, Prokofiev asserted, and remains 
nominally united only because it has yet to adopt a program declaring its goals 
and plans to achieve them. That move, due at the congress, is certain to split 
the party from top to bottom. 
</P>
<P>
"Let us be honest -- the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has ceased to be a 
party of those who think alike," V. V. Chikin, the party secretary at a watch 
factory in Minsk, declared. "In its ranks are people with positions that are 
diametrically opposed." 
</P>
<P>
The party has become paralyzed, Chikin said, by a deep ideological divide 
between radicals, such as the populist Boris N. Yeltsin, and conservatives 
adhering to traditional socialist values and party discipline. 
</P>
<P>
"Both I and my political opponents try to know the position of the center and 
where it is leading us in order to know whether we can travel the same route," 
Chikin said, echoing a common complaint among participants in the meeting. 
"Meanwhile, both right- and left-wingers can only guess over many of the 
maneuvers undertaken by the party leadership and try to crack the crossword 
puzzles that we now have as party documents." 
</P>
<P>
The most immediate threat to the party's unity, several speakers at the meeting 
said, is the Democratic Platform, a group of liberal-to-radical Communists 
whose alternative program would take the party even further from classic 
Marxism toward social democracy, the moderate wing of the working class 
movement in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Yuri N. Shogin, the party first secretary in Zhukovsky, a town outside Moscow, 
said that the program was widely discussed in his area and at least 30% of the 
people already support it in preference to the party's proposed platform, which 
itself is highly reformist and therefore controversial.

The result, said Brent Cole in closing arguments at Hazelwood's criminal trial, 
was "a captain's worst nightmare" and a massive oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
But defense attorneys, who acknowledged that Hazelwood had a few drinks before 
sailing, challenged the alcohol impairment allegations as "absurd." 
</P>
<P>
The critical mistakes that doomed the supertanker were made by others, said 
Fairbanks attorney Dick Madson, who pointed to the performance of the helmsman 
and third mate on watch when the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"Captain Hazelwood is not perfect . . . he made mistakes," Madson told jurors 
in his summation. However, he said, Hazelwood's errors were not sufficient "to 
brand him a criminal." 
</P>
<P>
The closing arguments marked the end of more than seven weeks of trial. 
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., is charged with one felony, criminal 
mischief, and three misdemeanors: reckless endangerment, operating a vessel 
while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil. If convicted, he could 
receive 7 1/4 years in prison and $61,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
Following arguments, Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone instructed jurors on 
the law for about an hour, then told them to select a foreman and begin their 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
They spent about 10 minutes behind closed doors, then retired for the day. They 
were to resume this morning. 
</P>
<P>
The six-woman, six-man jury faces two key questions: 
</P>
<P>
Was the captain drunk, and was he reckless when he left the bridge in control 
of his third mate while steering around ice floes? 
</P>
<P>
The trial produced substantial conflicting evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Hazelwood stayed in a bar all afternoon drinking before he 
sailed. But shipmates said he had only two or three drinks and a Valdez florist 
produced a receipt showing Hazelwood had been in her shop ordering flowers for 
his wife when a prosecution witness claimed he was drinking. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators and others noticed alcohol on Hazelwood's breath, but 21 
witnesses who saw him before and after the accident testified that they noticed 
no signs of impairment. 
</P>
<P>
A blood alcohol test produced a reading of .061%, a level well below the 
state's .10% minimum to presume he was drunk, but the test was taken more than 
10 hours after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
A state expert, using a controversial "retrograde extrapolation" formula, said 
the captain could have had a blood alcohol level of .14 to more than .20 at the 
time he boarded the ship. 
</P>
<P>
Madson scoffed at that, showing jurors pictures of the narrow gangway that 
Hazelwood had to cross to board his ship that night. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the toughest sobriety test you'll ever see," Madson said, further 
citing what he called the "one, solid, uniform voice" of witnesses who 
unanimously testified that they saw no physical evidence that Hazelwood was 
impaired by alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Cole also said that Hazelwood was not considering the ship's safety when he 
left the bridge in Cousins' sole control. At the time, the ship was changing 
course to go around glacier ice that had spread into the shipping lanes. 
</P>
<P>
But Madson argued that Hazelwood left a qualified and competent mate in charge 
of making what he called a routine and simple maneuver. What Hazelwood could 
not foresee, Madson said, was that the helmsman would fail to follow the mate's 
orders to turn the ship. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Cole said that Hazelwood himself had admitted responsibility for the 
accident. He referred to earlier testimony by an Exxon supervisor that 
Hazelwood, in a phone call an hour after the accident, "indicated that it was 
his fault, he was to blame, that he had just gone down to do some paper work 
when this happened and he should have been on the bridge." 
</P>
<P>
The defense has taken pains to point out that Hazelwood considered himself 
responsible in the timeless tradition of maritime captains who have lost their 
ships. But his attorneys vigorously deny that he is a criminal in the fashion 
of a drunk and criminally negligent driver. 
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood, accompanied to the courtroom by his wife and father, listened 
impassively as Cole declared that the since-fired captain "did not have safety 
first on his mind when he drank" before sailing. 
</P>
<P>
Cole, describing tankers as "ecological time bombs," said that when Hazelwood 
drank he "chose to be a gambler . . . a risk-taker" who jeopardized the safety 
of his ship. 
</P>
<P>
"He gambled that . . . his drinking would not adversely affect his judgment and 
decision-making that night. He was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Madson argued that drinking had nothing to do with the accident, that 
Hazelwood's orders were proper and prudent and that he had no reason to doubt 
the ability of his third mate, Gregory T. Cousins, to handle "a routine 
maneuver." 
</P>
<P>
During the trial Cole was sometimes frustrated by prosecution witnesses -- 
particularly crew members -- who often seemed to support defense claims that 
the captain wasn't drunk or responsible for the grounding. In one surprising 
attack during his final arguments Cole blamed the Exxon corporation. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing to Exxon attorneys in the audience who have been present throughout 
the trial, Cole suggested that the company had pressured employees to give 
testimony favorable to Hazelwood. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't take a brain surgeon to see Exxon's interest . . . in seeing 
Captain Hazelwood get acquitted," Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
The assertion brought a scornful response from Madson, who said Exxon is one of 
several entities -- including the state of Alaska and the Coast Guard -- who 
have tried to make Hazelwood the scapegoat for their own failures. 
</P>
<P>
"Politics . . . is the reason we're here today," Madson said.

Rep. Gus Savage was leading a Democratic challenger in his fight to keep his 
job after allegations of sexual misconduct, and Secretary of State Jim Edgar, a 
pro-choice moderate, defeated an anti-abortion conservative Tuesday to claim 
the Republican nomination for Illinois governor. 
</P>
<P>
In the 2nd Congressional District, with nearly 85% of the precincts reporting, 
Savage had 51% of the vote to 44% for newcomer Mel Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
Ernest Washington, a follower of political extremist Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr., 
had a small percentage. The district represents parts of Chicago's heavily 
Democratic South Side and some suburbs, and the winner of the primary will be 
strongly favored in November. 
</P>
<P>
In another race, attorney Richard Phelan, whose ethics investigation prompted 
the resignation of House Speaker Jim Wright, won a four-way Democratic primary 
for the powerful Cook County Board presidency.

BILL TO BAN NEWS VENDING OF PORN BURIED

Worried about possible infringement on First Amendment guarantees of free 
speech, a state Senate committee on Tuesday moved to bury a bill that would ban 
the sale of sexually explicit tabloids from sidewalk news racks. 
</P>
<P>
The intent of the measure, sponsored by Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport 
Beach), was to keep pornography out of the hands of minors. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by the county of Los Angeles and the state PTA, Ferguson's bill called 
for curtailing the sale of the sex newspapers from coin-operated racks. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson's measure gained surprising support from some civil libertarians in 
the Assembly, which passed it in January, and seemed to be gaining 
behind-the-scenes momentum on the Senate side before Tuesday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
But the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 5 to 4 to stop the Ferguson bill in 
its tracks and instead hold onto it for interim study -- a move that many 
acknowledged was the death knell for the controversial measure this year. 
</P>
<P>
In voting to hold the bill over for study, Sen. Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) cited 
possible legal problems with the bill's restrictions against the vending 
machine sales of any publication showing seven specific sexual acts. Such 
restrictions could be held to violate the First Amendment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sympathetic to families trying to inculcate values that they believe in 
their children," Lockyer said. "I'm not sure that state intervention in 
people's lives is the way to accomplish that." 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson, however, said his measure was aimed only at relocating the sale of 
the explicit tabloids, not regulating their contents. 
</P>
<P>
"It might be more obvious to them if there's a loophole in the law that allowed 
liquor, whiskey, to be sold from a vending machine from which they (minors) had 
access," Ferguson said. "They would quickly see that that's a loophole, and 
they would do away with it."

STATE SEEKS FULL CONTROL OVER WATER IN ITS RIVERS 
</P>

<P>
Attorneys for California urged the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday to give the 
states broad new authority to regulate the water flowing into hydroelectric 
power plants. 
</P>
<P>
In court briefs supporting the state, environmentalists argued that states 
should have full control of water flowing in their rivers and streams so they 
can protect fish, wildlife and recreational opportunities. In a rare show of 
unanimity, all 49 other states and the nation's major environmental groups have 
lined up on California's side. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side, the federal government and the utility industry argue that 
the Federal Power Act of 1920 gave federal regulators "exclusive authority" 
over all matters affecting hydroelectric power plants. Utility officials fear 
that in dry seasons states will reduce their water supply and force plants to 
shut down. 
</P>
<P>
This case, which could rewrite the law on water power, began quietly enough. In 
1987, a small investor-owned power plant was set to begin operation near 
Placerville. Officials of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had granted 
the plant a license to operate and the permission to divert water from the 
South Fork of the American River. 
</P>
<P>
But state water officials balked, contending that a trout spawning area in the 
river would be harmed. 
</P>
<P>
This issue is particularly significant on the West Coast because half of the 
nation's hydropower is in California, Oregon and Washington, the court was 
told. California has 492 licensed plants. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe Congress (in the 1920 law) intended to preserve the state's 
traditional control over its water rights," state Deputy Atty. Gen. Roderick E. 
Walston argued. 
</P>
<P>
For more than four decades, the high court has taken the opposite view. A 1946 
ruling said federal regulation of hydropower preempts the state's authority, 
and the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals relied on that precedent in ruling 
against California in this case. 
</P>
<P>
Several justices Tuesday suggested that the state's attorney should take his 
plea to Congress. "Is this the first place you go to change the law?" asked 
Justice John Paul Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
But the states also have a powerful advocate. Chief Justice William H. 
Rehnquist, a longtime defender of states' rights, appeared to take up 
California's side. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, Rehnquist wrote an opinion saying that the states should have 
authority to control water flowing into federal reclamation areas. Lawyers for 
California, citing that opinion, say the same principle should be applied to 
hydropower projects. 
</P>
<P>
But the court's conservative allies often split on federal-vs.-state cases. 
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, a former state legislator, typically sides with 
Rehnquist in support of the states. However, Justices Byron R. White and 
Antonin Scalia, who served in the U.S. Department of Justice, usually side with 
federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday morning, the justices will vote behind closed doors on this case, 
California vs. FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission), 89-333. An opinion 
is expected within three months.

<P>
Here's a look at Tuesday's effort to count the nation's homeless: 
</P>
<P>
 Who: About 15,000 Census Bureau workers visit an estimated 11,000 shelters and 
an equal number of identified street locations. 
</P>
<P>
What: They interview homeless people if possible, and at the very least count 
them for inclusion with all other Americans in the 1990 Census. 
</P>
<P>
This special homeless count is costing about $2.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
When: From 6 p.m. to midnight enumerators visit shelters and low-cost hotels 
and motels. From 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. they go to predetermined street and other 
outdoor sites where the homeless are known to congregate. From 4 a.m. to 8 a.m. 
they are outside abandoned buildings to count those coming out. 
</P>
<P>
Where: The effort includes every city of 50,000 or more residents and smaller 
towns and rural areas where local officials reported having a homeless 
population. 
</P>
<P>
Why: Homelessness has become an increasingly noticed problem in America, but 
there are no good statistics showing the extent. Estimates of the number of 
homeless vary from 250,000 to 3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Results: The effort is to find out how many people are homeless. But the bureau 
will not try to define that term. Instead, it will simply report finding so 
many people on the streets, so many in shelters or hotels, so many doubled up 
in apartments, etc. The results will be part of the general national population 
and housing analysis, expected to published in late 1991.

U.S. census workers searched for the homeless in Los Angeles' ritziest 
neighborhoods and in its most dreadful flophouses Tuesday night, and they found 
the homeless to be a skeptical, elusive and not always willing bunch. 
</P>
<P>
On Skid Row, poverty-stricken families were bedding down for the night and huge 
lines of the disowned and dysfunctional sat on sidewalks as $7-an-hour census 
workers hit the streets. 
</P>
<P>
One young mother, clutching two tiny girls in pigtails, joined 1,000 others in 
a blocks-long line for free food and insulating "space blankets" at the 
Homeless Outreach Project. She did not know that a census was under way in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, that sounds like a good idea, but why are they giving us out space 
blankets when we can't even find a place for children to use a bathroom down 
here?" she said, disappearing with the children into an alleyway. 
</P>
<P>
At the Los Angeles Mission, Jackie Dunbar, 32, homeless for three years, 
entered the shelter at 7 p.m. "Is there anything to eat?" she asked. When a 
census taker approached the rail-thin woman, she fled out the door and 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
A few blocks away, Arelio Ramos, 47, sat in the Union Rescue Mission, holding 
all his possessions in a small blue duffel bag. Keeping a firm grip on the bag, 
he said: "We are human beings. Maybe the census will let the rich people out 
there with nice homes and cars know we exist. Maybe it will bring some change." 
</P>
<P>
But at the Salvation Army shelter in an industrial sector of Bell, where the 
homeless took showers, played pool and enjoyed free bacon sandwiches and 
instant noodles, they were less than enamored of the count. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a crock," said Charles Davey Boynes Jr., 29, who said he has been 
homeless for 1 1/2 years. "The government doesn't want to help the people. 
We've been neglected all this time and now what's the census going to do to 
help us?" 
</P>
<P>
Still others became overnight activists, imploring their fellow homeless to get 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
A 31-year-old homeless man at the West Los Angeles armory said he'd been 
promoting the census to vagrants and the homeless along the beachfront in Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"They need to know how many there are of us, so those of us who want to get off 
the streets can get the help we need," said the man, who declined to identify 
himself. "A lot of them are scared. They think it's going to be turned over to 
the police. . . . Everybody's going to be hiding." 
</P>
<P>
Confusion was expected in the first comprehensive count of the homeless since 
the United States began keeping census records in 1790 -- and there was 
confusion aplenty in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
At the Ventura County Rescue Mission, a religious emergency shelter for single 
men in Oxnard, three census workers -- two elderly white men and one elderly 
white woman -- spoke no Spanish but had to interview a predominantly Latino 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
As the congregation sang spiritual hymns, census workers walked up and down the 
pews asking if anyone spoke English. Time after time, they were waved away by 
one wagging finger after another. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the stupidest thing I've ever seen," said Ventura County Supervisor 
Madge Schaefer, who donned a white Census Bureau smock to supervise the count. 
An interpreter was eventually summoned. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles had to make last-minute changes after Mayor Tom Bradley 
learned that a huge area of South-Central was left out of the planned count. 
</P>
<P>
He ordered city vans to pick up the homeless and take them to a local church to 
be counted, but it was not clear whether the plan would work. 
</P>
<P>
"We are reaching out to people on the streets," said Bob Vilmur, the city's 
homeless coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
As the evening wore on, the sheer size of the job of counting the homeless 
began to sink in. Fifty-thousand people are believed to be homeless in Los 
Angeles County alone. 
</P>
<P>
At the Culver City armory, the 15 census takers outnumbered the 10 homeless 
people who showed up, and one of them, a woman, refused to be counted. 
</P>
<P>
"Forget it, Charlie," she barked. "You're wasting the taxpayers' money."

2 DEPUTIES BALK IN DRUG SCANDAL, ARE SUSPENDED; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTIGATION: THE SHERIFF'S NARCOTICS OFFICERS REPORTEDLY REFUSED TO ANSWER 
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MONEY-SKIMMING PROBE WITHOUT HAVING AN ATTORNEY PRESENT. 
</P>

<P>
Two more Los Angeles County sheriff's narcotics officers have been suspended 
after balking at questions posed by investigators probing a widening 
money-skimming scandal, an attorney for the two deputies and sheriff's 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The officers were abruptly relieved of duty last Friday after refusing to 
answer questions about the alleged theft of seized drug money until their 
attorney could be present, said Richard Shinee, chief counsel for the Assn. for 
Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs. 
</P>
<P>
Shinee, who refused to identify the deputies, claimed the suspensions violated 
the rights of the deputies and were part of a "squeeze play" by sheriff's 
officials to try to pressure narcotics officers into cooperating with the 
money-skimming investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The scandal, which has already led to the indictment of 10 veteran officers and 
the suspension of eight others, has shaken the nation's largest sheriff's 
department and has spotlighted theft allegations against members of the elite 
narcotics squads that once handled major drug investigations. 
</P>
<P>
But Shinee said he is unaware of any evidence that the two newly suspended 
officers have been involved in any thefts. Instead, he said the deputies were 
questioned merely in an attempt to intimidate them and other officers into 
cooperating with investigatators. 
</P>
<P>
"My understanding is that these deputies were fully willing to participate in 
interviews, but with counsel present to ensure that their rights are 
protected," Shinee said. "And for simply attempting to secure that right, they 
were relieved of duty." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's officials also refused to identify the two deputies. 
</P>
<P>
"They were relieved because they chose not to talk to us as potential 
witnesses," said Undersheriff Robert Edmonds, who claimed the men disobeyed a 
direct order to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the officers were the targets of any theft allegations themselves, 
Edmonds said, "I don't want to characterize that any further except to say they 
were potential witnesses." 
</P>
<P>
Shinee, however, said he had listened to a tape-recording of the interview with 
one suspended deputy and disputed Edmonds' contention that the men were ordered 
to respond directly to questions. Shinee said the deputy was asked to respond 
voluntarily and asked for his attorney only after being told that theft 
allegations had been leveled against his entire crew. 
</P>
<P>
"Upon being advised that he was a possible suspect, he invoked his rights," 
Shinee said. 
</P>
<P>
The Times learned that the two deputies, who average nearly 20 years in the 
department, were among the estimated 40 officers on four teams investigating 
major narcotics cases. The crews were disbanded last fall after it was 
disclosed that some narcotics officers were accused of stealing drug money 
confiscated from narcotics traffickers and money launderers. 
</P>
<P>
A grand jury indictment alleges that the members of one major narcotics crew 
alone had stolen more than $1.4 million during an 18-month period. 
</P>
<P>
All nine members of that crew plus another deputy who worked on another major 
violators team were indicted last month on charges of conspiracy, theft and 
income tax violations. 
</P>
<P>
While Sgt. Robert R. Sobel pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with 
prosecutors, the remaining nine officers and the wife of one deputy -- who was 
also indicted -- pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
In an affidavit filed by the federal government and made public last week, 
investigators from the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service said that officers 
from three of the four narcotics investigation crews were involved in taking 
drug money and laundering the stolen cash or were aware of that activity. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth team was not cited in the federal affidavit. However, sources said 
the two deputies relieved of duty last weekend were assigned to that last crew 
before the teams were dismantled. 
</P>
<P>
The new suspensions are the first in several months and come amid more 
disclosures about the massive investigation that began in October, 1988, and 
escalated last year after the FBI and IRS joined the probe. 
</P>
<P>
According to the first of 57 search warrants and seizure documents unsealed 
this week, federal agents used a videotaped sting, wiretaps, information from 
drug dealers, tips from fellow deputies, financial records, interviews and the 
cooperation of Sobel to build their case against the suspected deputies. 
</P>
<P>
In a sweep last fall of homes and businesses owned by the indicted officers, 
sheriff's investigators and federal agents reported seizing tens of thousands 
of dollars in cash from private safes, bedroom drawers, briefcases and on 
tables. 
</P>
<P>
As much as $13,280 was found in one deputy's home, the search warrants said. 
Another $13,069 was discovered in another home and $11,706 in cash was found on 
a kitchen counter, in bedroom drawers and in a safe at another deputy's home, 
the warrants said. Some of that money, federal investigators claimed, came from 
stolen drug cash or was part of money that had been taken during an undercover 
FBI sting last August against the deputies.

CITY AND COUNTY REACH COMPROMISE ON COST OF JOINT ELECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles city and county officials Tuesday reached tentative settlement in 
their dispute over election costs, paving the way for a June public vote on a 
sweeping city ethics reform package. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise was approved Tuesday by county supervisors in a closed-door 
meeting. It now goes to the City Council for expected approval. 
</P>
<P>
Under the tentative agreement, the county will withdraw its threat to bar the 
city from participating in the June 5 county-run election. In return, the city 
will drop a lawsuit against the county over billing for the 1988 election. 
</P>
<P>
The city and county also agreed to "split the difference" in their dispute over 
the city's 1988 bill, Supervisor Ed Edelman said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement follows a month of intense behind-the-scenes negotiations, 
including rare face-to-face meetings between members of the City Council and 
the county board. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman said the supervisors agreed to the settlement "in the interest of 
harmony." 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a good time to keep fighting with the city," he said, pointing out 
that the county is seeking city approval for development of county-owned land 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
At Supervisor Pete Schabarum's urging, the board last month voted to block the 
city from consolidating with the county's election unless the city agreed in 
advance to pay its share of the costs and dropped the lawsuit against the 
county for billing in the 1988 election. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the county established a new formula for billing cities for the costs 
of consolidating elections. The city, whose bill for the November, 1988, 
election shot up 822%, to $755,654, compared to the November, 1986, fee of 
$78,223, sued the county last December challenging the statement. 
</P>
<P>
Under the tentative agreement, the city will pay the county $401,129 for the 
1988 election, Edelman said. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum cast the lone vote against the settlement, Edelman said. Schabarum 
could not be reached for comment, but the San Gabriel Valley supervisor had 
complained that many small cities paid a higher bill in 1988 but did not file 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
County Registrar-Recorder Charles Weissburd said that those cities will now be 
entitled to rebates. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Council President John Ferraro described the chances for 
council approval of the settlement as "very, very good." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good deal for the city," Councilman Mike Woo added. 
</P>
<P>
The council has approved placing four measures on the June ballot, including 
the ethics package. It would ban outside work for elected city officials while 
increasing the annual pay of council members to $86,157 from $61,157. It would 
also establish public financing for city campaigns.

HOSPITAL UNIT SHAKES OFF RARE INFECTION; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH CARE: KING/DREW'S SURGICAL ICU REOPENS AFTER A MONTHLONG SHUTDOWN. TEN 
PATIENTS WERE AFFLICTED BUT CAUSE IS STILL UNKNOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center's surgical intensive care unit has 
reopened after a monthlong shutdown in which 10 chronically ill patients were 
infected by a rare and highly resistant bacterial infection. 
</P>
<P>
The outbreak triggered an investigation by infection-control experts and forced 
postponement of numerous elective surgeries and isolation of infected patients 
in a neighboring wing of the 430-bed county facility, according to King's 
medical director. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials discovered the first strains of Acinetobacter anitratus 
during a routine laboratory culture study on Jan. 5. During the next five 
weeks, a number of other tests revealed a cluster of other intensive care unit 
patients infected with the opportunistic bacterial organism, although no 
additional cases have been found since Feb. 11. 
</P>
<P>
The patients have been treated and are no longer infected, though some remain 
in isolation, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But numerous laboratory tests have failed so far to uncover the source of the 
infection, which preys primarily on ill patients with weakened immune systems 
and thrives on damaged skin. Infectious-disease experts believe that the 
organism, which exists primarily in the throat, the groin, and on hands, 
probably was transferred through human contact. The infection has been known to 
cause pneumonia, but most patients carry it without showing any symptoms, 
according to infection-control investigators. 
</P>
<P>
King hospital officials have downplayed the significance of the outbreak, 
saying the patients suffered no further health problems as a result of the 
infection. But the incident has rekindled questions about the standards at the 
medical center, which last year was cited by state and federal health 
investigators for a high incidence of hospital-borne infections and fundamental 
inadequacies in the hospital's infection-control program. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody likes to hear that there has been an outbreak; it's like a nightmare 
for infection control," said Dr. Jessie L. Sherrod, director of infection 
control at King. "But people are human and they occasionally get lax (with 
sterilization procedures), although it remains to be seen if that was what 
caused it to spread here." 
</P>
<P>
The outbreak has so baffled infectious-disease experts that Sherrod said the 
hospital plans to do a detailed study of the case and publish it in a medical 
journal. A. anitratus has intrigued infectious-disease detectives like Sherrod 
because of its resistance to all but a few antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not terribly surprising," Dr. Shirley Fannin, associate deputy 
director of the disease control program for the Department of Health Services, 
said of the outbreak at King. "If you put in another hospital's name and 
another type of bacteria, it wouldn't alarm anybody. All hospitals have 
outbreaks at one time or another." 
</P>
<P>
Four cases of the bacterial infection were discovered during the first week of 
January, but hospital officials said they wanted to check the extent of the 
outbreak and waited until five additional cases were found in the first week of 
February before they closed the unit. 
</P>
<P>
The last infected patient was confirmed on Feb. 11, after the ICU was closed to 
all patient admissions and discharges. 
</P>
<P>
The unit reopened March 14. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. James G. Haughton, King's medical director, said that after the outbreak 
was reported to county health officials in early February, the patients were 
immediately transferred to another surgical ward, which had been closed last 
year because the hospital could not hire enough nurses to staff it. 
</P>
<P>
Patients requiring intensive care after emergency surgery were placed in the 
hospital's post-anesthesia recovery area, Haughton said. Those patients, who 
required long-term hospital care, will remain in isolation until hospital 
officials are convinced the infection has not spread elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping to find the one thing that triggered the outbreak," Sherrod said. 
"When you deal with something like this, where an organism turns up, doesn't go 
away (in a short time) and it's a type that is especially difficult to treat, 
that's when you get really scared." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center was placed on conditional 
accreditation last month after a team of medical investigators from the Joint 
Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations found widespread 
problems in staffing, record-keeping, quality assurance programs and patient 
care. In addition, a turnaround by the hospital staff to bring it into 
compliance with most national health-care standards last year was enough to 
persuade federal health officials not to withhold $60 million in Medicare and 
Medicaid funds that had been threatened.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CSUN COMMENCEMENT WILL RETURN TO CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Graduation at Cal State Northridge will return to campus this spring in the 
wake of last year's problem-plagued ceremony, which was at the Hollywood Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Commencement is scheduled to be held at 10 a.m. May 25 at the stadium, located 
on the university's North Campus. Seating will be available for about 20,000 
students, parents and other guests, said commencement planner Heidi Levy. He 
said problems last year -- which included an hours-long traffic jam that 
delayed the arrival of participants and guests, including university President 
James W. Cleary -- had little to do with the change. "The desire was always to 
hold it on campus whenever it could be," Levy said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CHARGES FILED AGAINST 2 IN BABY-SELLING 
SCHEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charges were filed Tuesday against a Long Beach attorney and an Orange County 
social worker, accusing them of conspiracy in a baby-selling scheme in which 
between $5,000 and $20,000 allegedly was offered to pregnant welfare recipients 
for newborns. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney, Ira M. Aspiz, 34, and the social worker, Youda Huor, 33, have 
agreed to appear in court April 13 for arraignment on the charges, which were 
filed in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Aspiz and Huor are each charged with two felony counts of conspiracy to offer 
payments to a parent for adoption, and one misdemeanor count of attempting to 
offer such payments. If convicted, each could receive a maximum prison sentence 
of three years and 8 months. 
</P>
<P>
Paul S. Meyer, Aspiz's attorney, said the charges were "grossly exaggerated."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: REMOVAL OF 7 OAK TREES AT MOUNTAIN SITE 
BARRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge Tuesday barred a developer from destroying or removing 
seven oak trees on a controversial construction site in the Santa Monica 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The temporary restraining order was sought by members of the Topanga Assn. for 
Scenic Community and the Woodland Hills Homeowners Assn., who said they feared 
the developer was planning to remove the trees without a permit. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Rosemary Woodlock, representing the groups, told Judge John Zebrowski 
the trees have been labeled with aluminum removal tags. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for Grupe Developers Inc., Joshua Rosen, denied that the developers 
planned to remove the trees and said they had been tagged by accident. The firm 
has already received a permit to remove 57 other oaks to make way for an 
83-house tract, Rosen said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: INTERIM RELOCATION PLAN FOR CITY WORKERS 
OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council approved a plan Tuesday to provide space for city 
workers while sprinkler systems are installed in six city buildings, including 
the Parker Center, which may be razed to make way for a more modern facility. 
</P>
<P>
The council unanimously approved the $23-million acquisition and renovation of 
a three-story building at 212 N. Vignes St. to provide office space while the 
city buildings are brought up to code. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who introduced a motion that called on city 
officials to seek less costly methods of bringing the buildings up to fire 
safety standards, noted that the city Police Department is developing a 
proposal concerning replacement of its 35-year-old headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
But Yaroslavsky added that a voter-backed bond measure would be necessary to 
fund such action, which could cost more than $100 million.

SPRING BREAKS;

SIGNS ABOUND AS SEASON OF REBIRTH OFFICIALLY ARRIVES

OK, so the sun is shining, the palm fronds are swaying ever so gently and the 
surfers are catching waves down at the beach. In Los Angeles, says Kristin 
Zabawa, that's not enough to tell it's spring. 
</P>
<P>
For Zabawa, an animal keeper in the bird nursery of the Los Angeles Zoo, spring 
means baby birds. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just starting to get eggs," she said Tuesday afternoon, shortly after 
feeding a 3-week-old black-footed South African penguin named Art. "Right now 
we have a king vulture egg -- they're from South America -- and a tawny 
frogmouth." 
</P>
<P>
Spring officially arrived in Southern California on Tuesday at 1:19 p.m., 
marking the vernal equinox, when the sun crosses the celestial Equator. Yet in 
a region where the weather may be the same on New Year's Day as it is on the 
Fourth of July, the season of rebirth and renewal is, as Zabawa says, heralded 
by changes that transcend the climate. 
</P>
<P>
The fragrance of night-blooming Jessamine (a cousin of jasmine, which won't be 
blooming for another few weeks) sweetens the warm evening air. Rookie school 
begins for would-be Los Angeles County lifeguards, and the Baywatch boats get a 
fresh paint job. The fashion-conscious pull their crisp linen whites out of the 
closet. On the city's Westside and in the Fairfax district, Passover matzo 
begins appearing on the supermarket shelves. 
</P>
<P>
At Dodger Stadium, Bob Smith, director of stadium operations since 1962, is 
hurriedly preparing for the first cry of "Play Ball!" 
</P>
<P>
"We've got gardeners and landscaping people, they're working on the field, 
getting everything ready, planting flowers on the slopes, mowing and edging," 
he says. "We're hiring all our employees, the ushers, security people, ticket 
takers. . . . Everybody's busy. The switchboard is lit up like a Christmas 
tree." 
</P>
<P>
At the Immaculate Conception School near downtown Los Angeles, paper Easter 
eggs are popping up on classroom walls and bulletin boards. "The kindergartners 
and first-graders have been growing plants for spring," says Principal Mary Ann 
Murphy. "It's been real exciting for them to watch new life happen." 
</P>
<P>
At Cal Poly Pomona, nursery technician Don DeLano sees spring in the colors of 
his flowers: bright red roses, dazzling yellow daffodils, paper white 
narcissus. "During the winter," he says, "you get your muted colors. I call 
them somber shades -- burgundies, bronzes, tans. You get mixes of brown into 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
And lest you entertain the false notion that there are no weather changes 
associated with springtime in Los Angeles, Scott Entrekin -- a meteorologist 
for the National Weather Service -- will happily set you straight. 
</P>
<P>
According to Entrekin, long-term climatological studies show that in Southern 
California, the average chance of precipitation peaks during mid-February and 
then again in March -- specifically on the 20th, the day winter turns into 
spring. Beginning today, he said, those chances embark on a downward slide 
toward summer. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally," he said, "when spring starts to roll around we become a lot drier. 
The chances of precipitation start to dwindle. The fog and low clouds 
increase." 
</P>
<P>
But that is of no interest to Pete Trilling, who along with his wife and young 
daughter, was wandering about the zoo Tuesday -- a day when the temperature, 
which hit a high of 90 degrees in downtown Los Angeles, was more reminiscent of 
summer than spring. 
</P>
<P>
Trilling, a Los Angeles police officer, said he moved here last year from South 
Dakota for one simple reason: "So we could have spring all the time."

But in a region where the weather may be identical on New Year's Day and the 
Fourth of July, the change is marked subtly: Rookie school begins for would-be 
lifeguards and Passover matzoh start appearing on supermarket shelves. And of 
course, the flowers bloom at florist shops all over. ; Photo, Al Meyers, left,

SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES INVESTIGATE DEATH OF CYPRESS GIRL, 16 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies were investigating Tuesday whether a 
16-year-old Cypress girl whose body was found buried beneath a pile of pine 
needles near a flood-control channel in Lakewood was a murder victim. 
</P>
<P>
The fully clothed body of Zuleima Valdez was discovered at 5:45 p.m. Monday by 
two teen-agers riding bicycles near a paved trail on the Lakewood side of the 
Coyote Creek flood control channel, Sheriff's Deputy Chris Wahla said. The 
channel marks the border between Cypress and Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
There were no visible signs of trauma on the body, Wahla said. An autopsy was 
scheduled for later this week to determine the cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
The body was found in a hollow dirt area about 50 feet from the paved path and 
was partially buried under a pile of pine needles, leading sheriff's 
investigators to believe someone attempted to hide the remains, Wahla said. 
Pine needles from evergreen trees rimming Forest Lawn Memorial-Park in Cypress 
are lightly scattered throughout the area. 
</P>
<P>
Valdez's parents had reported her missing to Cypress police at 1:25 a.m. 
Monday, Cypress Police Lt. John Schaefer said. She was last seen at 9:30 p.m. 
Sunday, when she left her home with a friend to go to the beach, according to 
Wahla. 
</P>
<P>
Jack D. Weber, the principal at Cypress High School where Valdez was a 
freshman, described the girl as an average to above-average student who was 
quiet and well-behaved. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, she seemed to be doing fine," Weber said. "Her attendance record was 
good. We had no knowledge of any conflict . . . in her life." 
</P>
<P>
Valdez had moved with her family from New York to Cypress just before she 
started eighth grade at Lexington Junior High School, Principal Pat Savage 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At Cypress High School, Weber announced the news of Valdez's death over the 
school's public address system and said counseling will be available for 
students. The flag was lowered to half-staff and a memorial service in the 
school theater was scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
Group counseling sessions held throughout the day drew many of Valdez's friends 
as well as students who barely knew her, Weber said. 
</P>

The "Nerd Herd" has taken top honors in this year's Los Angeles Unified School 
District's Academic Pentathlon. 
</P>
<P>
The nine-member team from Sepulveda Junior High School -- which bestowed the 
moniker on itself during training last fall -- finished ahead of Porter Junior 
High School of Granada Hills and 78 other schools in the seventh annual battle 
of the brains, district officials said Tuesday. The Los Angeles Center for 
Enriched Studies, a district magnet school, finished third. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a lot of work, but it was worth it because we won," said Jason Chen, 
14, of Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second consecutive first-place finish for the Sepulveda team. 
</P>
<P>
The Feb. 24 competition, which drew more than 700 participants from 80 schools 
throughout the Los Angeles Unified School District, tested students in math, 
science, history and essay writing. The fifth event, called the Super Quiz, 
required students to answer questions about a John Steinbeck book, "The Red 
Pony." 
</P>
<P>
"I had students who read that book four or five times, right up to the night 
before the competition," said team coach Kathy Floor, a health and science 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
The Sepulveda school, which has 2,000 students, has finished no worse than 
third place since the district began the academic competition in 1984. The 
school team finished first last year, as well as in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The Sepulveda team members, who by contest rules are divided evenly among A, B 
and C students, also include Katie Unterman, Gabriel White, Miriam Kim, Teja 
Fox, Jonathan Kirzner, Shawn Park, Chris Allen and Kimberly Burr. 
</P>
<P>
The school board is scheduled to honor the team during an April 2 reception. 
</P>
<P>
The Sepulveda school is a finalist for designation by the state as a 
distinguished school, Principal Wilbert Whitaker said. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real High School in Woodland Hills earlier this month finished second 
in the statewide Academic Decathlon competition for high school students. There 
is no statewide event for junior high school students.

INOFFENSIVE U.S. BLANKED BY HUNGARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

BUDAPEST, Hungary 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Normally, Hungary would have no incentive against the United States, one of 
soccer's Third World nations. Indeed, the only other time the two teams met, 11 
years ago, the Hungarians were so carefree that they lost. 
</P>
<P>
But Tuesday night at Ulloi Stadium, the Hungarians put their best feet forward 
in a 2-0 victory over the United States before a crowd of about 15,000 and 
cameras from two national television networks, their own and one in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in 20 years, the Hungarians will not be in the World Cup, 
soccer's most prestigious championship. So they were eager to prove they are 
better than at least one of the 24 teams that will play in Italy this summer. 
</P>
<P>
But Italian fans, astute enough to know that much without having to watch this 
game, probably had changed the channel by halftime. Except for a hit crossbar 
here and a hit post there, the score could have been as one-sided as the game. 
For previous reference, see the Soviet Union's 3-1 victory over the United 
States last month at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
"We know we're students of the game," said U.S. forward Chris Sullivan, who is 
from the University of Tampa via Redwood City, Calif., but is doing his 
postgraduate work in the Hungarian first division. 
</P>
<P>
"We Americans can make cars well, and we can promote well, but now we want to 
do something new well." 
</P>
<P>
As one of two American players who have played in Hungary, Sullivan said he 
knew before the game how the United States might beat the Hungarians. Or more 
accurately, how the Hungarians might beat themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"If they score one or two goals, they will work together like a family," he 
said. "But if they get down, there's a negative feeling throughout the team. 
They start yelling at each other." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, the Hungarians were one big happy family. They scored in the 
39th minute on a left-footed shot by Tamas Petres after a crossing pass lured 
U.S. goalkeeper Tony Meola out of position. In the 74th minute, Zsolt Limperger 
scored on a left-footed scorcher from 25 yards out that Meola did not see until 
too late because he was shielded by one of his own men. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary had 10 other solid shots, six of which Meola was forced to save. In 
contrast, the United States, as meek offensively as usual, took six shots, only 
three of which caused goalkeeper Istvan Brockhauser much concern. 
</P>
<P>
"Early in the second half, we started getting some momentum so that maybe they 
were thinking they weren't really that dominant," Sullivan said. "But once they 
got the second goal, it was a festival for them." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it was the type of performance the Hungarians needed to win back their 
fans. There were about 10,000 empty seats in the stadium, which soccer 
officials here attributed, in part, to the political rallies downtown Tuesday 
night for Sunday's historic free elections. But they also admitted that the 
team has lost support since not qualifying for the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary had one of the sport's legendary teams in the early 1950s, losing, 3-2, 
to West Germany in the '54 World Cup championship game after leading 2-0. All 
national teams have suffered by comparison since then, although Hungary still 
was able to qualify for all four World Cups between 1974 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But in the '86 World Cup in Mexico, the Hungarians lost, 6-0, to the Soviet 
Union, something they never overcame. They have had four coaches since then, 
including Kalman Meszoly, who was hired in January after Hungary failed to 
advance to the World Cup from a difficult qualifying group that included Spain 
and Ireland. Two ties against lowly Malta sealed Hungary's fate. 
</P>
<P>
Meszoly, who also had the job from 1980 through '83, was implicated in a 
game-rigging scandal as the coach of a Hungarian first-division team in 1988 
but was exonerated after an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"As the political changes opened up the freedom of the press, they blew it out 
of proportion," he said last week. 
</P>
<P>
He also said he believes that the liberalization of Hungary has contributed to 
the country's decline in soccer. 
</P>
<P>
"Young people in the past didn't have a chance to go to discotheques," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that, Meszoly has put together an extremely young team in hopes of 
qualifying for the 1992 European Championship. Only two players in Tuesday 
night's starting lineup had participated in more than three games for the 
national team. 
</P>
<P>
"They have to realize they are playing for the Hungarian national colors," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that means more than it has in the past. Tears came to a Hungarian 
soccer federation official's eyes this week when he saw a picture of the U.S. 
players holding their hands over their hearts during the national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
"Our players must start doing that," he said, "now that we are a free country."

NORTH STARS ARE SKATING ON THIN ICE IN MINNESOTA 
</P>

<P>
This is the land of 10,000 lakes and one failed National Hockey League team 
that is a monument to mismanagement and miscalculation. 
</P>
<P>
Hockey will outlast the North Stars in Minnesota because lacing on skates and 
whacking a puck across those 10,000 frozen ponds are traditions passed on from 
generation to generation. 
</P>
<P>
The tradition is not only alive, but healthier than ever: The annual state high 
school tournament, just completed, attracted sellout crowds for its 
preliminary-round games and to the finals at the St. Paul Civic Center. 
Round-the-clock telecasts showed roaring crowds, vibrant enthusiasm, lively 
games. 
</P>
<P>
The University of Minnesota Golden Gophers draw the same response, averaging 
more than 7,000 fans a game, and the Western Collegiate Hockey Assn. playoffs 
averaged 11,962 fans a game at the Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
It's the same game but a different scene in suburban Bloomington. There, the 
North Stars skate before a crowd that might, if it's a Saturday and if there's 
a giveaway and if the roads are free of ice, fill 10,000 of the Met Center's 
15,093 seats. Starting with a base of 3,800 season tickets, one of the smallest 
bases in the NHL, the North Stars this season have been averaging only 11,274 
fans a game. 
</P>
<P>
That's more than 3,000 below the NHL average but it's an increase over last 
season's average of 9,795. 
</P>
<P>
"Minnesota isn't the wrong place for hockey," said Jack Ferreira, the North 
Stars' general manager. "It's just wrong for the Minnesota North Stars." 
</P>
<P>
How could a professional hockey team go wrong in a state that is home to 45,000 
registered amateur hockey players and the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame? How could 
the North Stars miss in a state that has sent a steady stream of players to the 
NHL and this season has 19 in the league? 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't easy, but they've managed to extract nothing but fool's gold from a 
gold mine. 
</P>
<P>
The team has been on a financial and aesthetic decline since 1981, when it made 
its only appearance in the Stanley Cup finals and lost to the New York 
Islanders. The North Stars averaged 15,784 fans a game that season and topped 
15,000 a game each of the next three seasons, but fans soured after getting too 
many failed promises and postseason failures. 
</P>
<P>
The team lost $6.5 million last season and $16 million over the past four 
years, despite paying a paltry annual rent of $175,000 and keeping parking and 
concession revenues. Its television revenues for 40 games this season will be 
less than the $1.58 million a local TV station paid the Minnesota State High 
School League to televise portions of the state hockey tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"We were going 85, 86 (points) and every year we dropped season tickets," said 
Lou Nanne, the team's general manager from 1977 to 1988 and now its president. 
"We sold winning the Stanley Cup rather than professional hockey as 
entertainment. Maybe we encouraged them to expect too much after we went to the 
finals in '81." 
</P>
<P>
Team owners George and Gordon Gund forced the issue in late January when they 
announced they would sell the team or move it to the San Francisco Bay Area 
unless the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission -- which owns Met Center 
-- agreed to make $15 million in improvements to the building. George Gund, who 
lives in the Bay Area, and his brother, Gordon, who is head of a financial 
investment corporation in Princeton, N.J., assumed controlling interest in the 
team in 1978 after their Cleveland Barons -- nee California (Oakland) Seals -- 
merged with the North Stars. Their net worth is estimated at $1.1 billion by 
Forbes magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The price they set for the franchise was $50 million. Not surprisingly, they've 
gotten few offers. 
</P>
<P>
One was from Minneapolis businessman and author Harvey Mackay, who has a 
supporting cast that includes, among others, Carl Pohlad, owner of the Twins; 
Northwest Airline, the Pillsbury Company, insurance companies and a TV-radio 
station. 
</P>
<P>
The other was from Compuware, a Michigan-based computer company. Compuware is 
considered the more serious of the two and has the financial resources, but an 
NHL insider said: "Once (Compuware officials) check over the books and see it 
isn't going to work, they're going to withdraw their offer." 
</P>
<P>
That would leave the Gunds with one option: moving to the Bay Area. Approval by 
the NHL's Board of Governors would be required, and a meeting was held Monday 
in Chicago to discuss the situation, but the team's relocation application 
won't be formally considered until April. The governors showed their 
receptiveness to a move earlier this month when they passed an amendment to the 
league's bylaws that would allow a team to move with a majority vote by the 
Board. 
</P>
<P>
The Gunds referred questions about the team to Arthur Savage, who is Gordon 
Gund's financial adviser. Savage wouldn't say whether the brothers prefer to 
keep or sell the team, but he said they won't stay in Minnesota simply because 
of sentiment within the NHL that a team can and should succeed there. "If 
there's someone out there who would like to buy the team and keep the North 
Stars there, let them have a try at it," Savage said. "If there isn't, we don't 
feel we should be forced to stay there and be forced to lose $5 to $6 million a 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Although Oakland spurned Charles O. Finley's Seals in the 1970s, the Gunds 
believe hockey will succeed this time around. 
</P>
<P>
"That was 15 years ago. The Oakland A's were drawing 700,000 and the (San 
Francisco) Giants weren't drawing, and this year they both combined to draw 5 
million," Savage said. "The Warriors (of the NBA) sell out every game and 
they're not even a playoff team. There's a big interest in sports. Our research 
indicates the Bay Area will support a team." Savage said the area's avid 
interest in amateur hockey has hurt the North Stars. 
</P>
<P>
"There's so much other hockey that's available, from junior to high school to 
college, and there's only so much room and so much time to devote to 
professional hockey," he said. "This is more hockey country for the amateur 
level than the professional level. Unfortunately, we have to make payrolls. 
This is a business. They don't have to make payrolls in high school and 
college. . . . There's too many choices, if you will. College hockey is equally 
interesting to people there and it's much less expensive." 
</P>
<P>
One of the North Stars' most costly mistakes was not hiring Herb Brooks as 
coach in the early 1980s. Brooks, who was born in St. Paul, coached the 
University of Minnesota to three NCAA championships and became an unassailable 
hero when he coached the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team to the gold medal at 
Lake Placid, N.Y. He coached in Switzerland and then in New York before joining 
the North Stars' bench in the fall of 1987. Brooks was not retained when 
Ferreira succeeded Nanne. 
</P>
<P>
"Letting Herbie go was a PR disaster," Nanne said, "but the owners said the new 
manager should be able to pick his coach." 
</P>
<P>
As absentee owners, the Gunds could not grasp the extent of Brooks' popularity. 
Brooks would not comment about his stint with the North Stars, and about the 
team's plight, saying only that he doesn't buy the theory that the team is the 
victim of a hockey glut. 
</P>
<P>
"Amateur and professional hockey can coexist in a real positive way," said 
Brooks, a commentator for NHL telecasts on SportsChannel America. Nonetheless, 
the North Stars' departure seems inevitable. The vacuum it creates probably 
would be filled in the next wave of expansion, leaving another owner to learn 
from the Gunds' mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
Or repeat them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The Minnesota North Stars were one of six teams added to the NHL before the 
1967-68 season -- the Kings, California (Oakland) Seals, Pittsburgh Penguins, 
Philadelphia Flyers and St. Louis Blues were the others. The Seals moved to 
Cleveland and became the Barons for the 1976-77 season, then merged with the 
North Stars for the 1978-79 season. Since then, the team has played its home 
games in Bloomington, Minn. If a Minnesota buyer cannot be found, the team 
probably will move to the San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
WHERE HAVE ALL THE FANS GONE? 
</P>
<P>
The Minnesota North Stars set a team attendance record in 1980-81, when they 
reached the Stanley Cup finals. Since then, average attendance at North Star 
games in Met Center has dropped considerably. In the same period, average 
attendance at all NHL games has risen to record levels annually.

Cal State Long Beach's best basketball season in 16 years came to an end here 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers lost to the University of Hawaii, 84-79, in the second round of the 
National Invitation Tournament before a sellout crowd of 7,617 in Blaisdell 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach finished the season 23-9. 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii (25-9), which will advance to play at New Mexico Thursday night, got 
three-point plays from Chris Gaines and Vincent Smalls in the last 2:12. 
</P>
<P>
Those gave the Rainbows a 77-72 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Tyrone Mitchell's two free throws then cut it to 77-74 with 1:09 to play. 
</P>
<P>
But Terry Houston of Hawaii made one of two free throws to make it 78-74. 
</P>
<P>
Frankie Edwards then went to the line for the 49ers with 42 seconds left and 
made two shots to pul the 49ers within 78-76. 
</P>
<P>
After a Long Beach timeout, the 49ers fouled Houston with 38 seconds left and 
then called another timeout. 
</P>
<P>
Houston made both ends of a one-and-one. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach guard Lucious Harris, who had scored only one point in the second 
half after scoring 15 in the first half, then shot an air ball. 
</P>
<P>
After a scramble, the 49ers got the ball back and Harris was fouled. He made 
the first shot, missed the second and the 49ers lost the rebound out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
Gaines clinched the victory with two free throws with 13 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers did not appear intimidated by the screaming Rainbow fans who waved 
the two-foot-long green leaves of the ti plant for good luck. 
</P>
<P>
After a power move inside by Mitchell, the 49ers had a 13-7 lead with 14:50 
left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
The 49er press bothered Hawaii and forced four early turnovers. With about 12 
minutes left in the half, Bobby Sears made a steal in the backcourt that led to 
a reverse dunk by Troy Joseph that gave the 49ers a 17-13 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Masucci came off the bench to score three baskets for the 49ers, his third 
giving Long Beach a 26-20 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But Hawaii's Troy Bowe, the smallest player on the court at 5 feet 10, scored 
after grabbing a rebound and then, 20 seconds later, he made a driving layup to 
cut the lead to 26-24 with 8:28 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell was unstoppable inside, but his inability to make free throws -- he 
missed the rim on one attempt -- got the crowd and the Rainbows back in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
After two missed free throws by Mitchell, Hawaii went on a 6-0 run to take a 
30-28 lead as the 49ers had trouble keeping them off the offensive boards. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell came back with a drive to tie the score at 30-30, then Harris, who had 
scored 90 points in his last four games, began to take over. 
</P>
<P>
He made two free throws, a layup and a bank shot, then lobbed a perfect pass to 
Frankie Edwards, who dunked. 
</P>
<P>
That surge, followed by a rebound basket by Masucci, put the 49ers ahead, 
42-36. 
</P>
<P>
A bank shot from three-point range at the buzzer by Darrell Faulkner gave the 
49ers a 48-43 lead at the half. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach went into the locker room knowing it was 18-0 this season in games 
in which the 49ers led at the half.

SO WHAT'S THE HURRY? ONLY 8 PLAYERS ATTEND FIRST REGULAR WORKOUT

Those spirited, champing-at-the-bit Dodgers charged into the official opening 
of spring training Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
All eight of them. 
</P>
<P>
"There's more writers here than players," observed pitcher Orel Hershiser, one 
of the handful of Dodgers on the major league roster to show up for Tuesday 
morning's first regular workout after the owners' 32-day lockout. 
</P>
<P>
On a day when many major league clubs welcomed 20 or more impatient players -- 
opening-day opponent San Diego had 29 -- the Dodgers couldn't even field a 
team. Batting practice consisted of three hitters. The pitchers threw one at a 
time. During morning calisthenics, there were more photographers stretching 
than players, perhaps explaining why Hershiser tackled one. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected a few more people here," Hershiser said, and he was not alone. 
</P>
<P>
If official projections are true that just 10 more Dodgers will arrive in time 
for today's workout, with most of the remaining players planning to begin 
workouts Thursday, the Dodgers will effectively have two fewer days of spring 
training than most teams. Most years, that would be no big deal. This year, 
with just 20 spring training days available, it's different. 
</P>
<P>
Excusing the few Dodgers who live on the West Coast and must spend a day 
traveling here, could it be that the rest of them did not know about the end of 
the lockout? 
</P>
<P>
"I called a lot of people when the lockout ended, but I got a lot of answering 
machines," said Hershiser, who lives in Vero Beach. "And I thought I was tough 
to get ahold of." 
</P>
<P>
But he added: "I do understand how a lot of guys have family problems; they 
have to get packed and pay bills and take care of all their stuff for the 
summer. It's hard for some people, sure." 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser was joined by pitchers Ray Searage, Zak Shinall, Mike Hartley and 
Mike Maddux. Also in attendance were first baseman Eddie Murray, infielder 
Lenny Harris and catcher Rick Dempsey. Two other members of the 38-man major 
league roster appeared later in the afternoon, pitchers Dan Opperman and Pat 
Perry. 
</P>
<P>
The players were greeted with the usual hugs and headlocks and shouts by 
Manager Tom Lasorda, who clearly could have used more company. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not fair to compare anyone to me," Lasorda said, when asked if he was 
among the first players at camp in his playing days. "But I would have been 
here today." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the absent players said their reasons have nothing to do with 
enthusiasm, but logistics. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to close up my house for the summer in one day?" Jeff Hamilton asked 
late Sunday from his Phoenix area home. "I can't do that, and I can't always be 
leaving my wife alone to do it. I've got to take care of business; I can't just 
throw stuff in suitcases and go. (The owners) keep us out so long, they have to 
understand that." 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser sighed. "There is going to be residue from the lockout," he said. 
"There is going to be a fallout." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers spent most of Tuesday addressing that fallout, figuring out 
everything from exhibition games to pitching rotations. A summary: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Freeway Series will be held one week later than scheduled, with a 
change in locations. The Dodgers and the Angels will play at Anaheim Stadium on 
Friday, April 6, at 7:30 p.m., then move to Dodger Stadium for games on April 7 
at 7 p.m. and April 8 at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the originally scheduled March 30 game will be honored for the 
April 8 game. Tickets for the March 31 game will be honored for the April 7 
game. Either ticket can also be refunded or exchanged for tickets to any game 
during the 1990 season. Tickets for the April 1 game had not been printed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The exhibition season will begin next Monday against the Minnesota Twins at 
Orlando, Fla. It will continue with one game a day until the Dodgers break camp 
after an April 4 game against the Montreal Expos and return to Los Angeles for 
an April 5 Dodger Stadium workout before the Freeway Series. 
</P>
<P>
 -- There is a chance that the Dodgers will open the season on April 9 at 
Dodger Stadium against the Padres before going to San Diego for a three-game 
series. The date, previously an off day, was awaiting approval from the league 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ron Perranoski, Dodger pitching coach, hopes his starting pitchers will be 
able to go four innings on opening day, with two starters pitching each game 
until they can get stronger. This type of rotation would require six starting 
pitchers, meaning that Mike Morgan would at least begin the season as a 
starter, along with Hershiser, Tim Belcher, Fernando Valenzuela, Ramon Martinez 
and John Wetteland. 
</P>
<P>
The pitchers' biggest problem, according to Hershiser, could be not in their 
arms, but in their heads. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one thing to be careful in spring training, it's another thing to listen 
to your body when you are pitching in front of 50,000 people in a big league 
park and the adrenaline is hitting you," he said. "That's why that 
three-innings-for-a-win rule is so good. If they didn't have that, I could see 
guys going four innings, feeling good, trying to push it to five innings so 
they could get a win, and then getting hurt."

RADER'S BUNCH SPRINGS INTO SERIOUS MODE

That the first day of spring training fell on the first day of spring seemed 
poetic justice, of sorts. The Angels were too busy stretching and straining to 
notice the coincidence, but the fans who flocked to Gene Autry Park Tuesday to 
watch the team's first workout feared that poetic justice would be the only 
justice they'll get in this lockout-tainted season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think all baseball fans will probably forgive, but they won't forget," said 
Mesa resident Sam Hartzler, a lifelong fan. "That's the way I am now. You don't 
forget something like this." 
</P>
<P>
While the fans can choose to forget the lockout, the Angels can't. Forced to 
cram the customary six weeks' work into three, they began Tuesday with a 
four-hour session that set the tone for a brisk and intense camp. 
</P>
<P>
Only six players were absent Tuesday -- second baseman Johnny Ray, designated 
hitter Brian Downing, outfielders Chili Davis and Claudell Washington, pitcher 
Chuck Finley and Tony Armas, a non-roster invitee. All are expected in Mesa 
today. 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Mike Port viewed the robust attendance as a sign of the 
players' enthusiasm for the season and said his eagerness to get going matched 
theirs. "It's nice to have things under way," he said. "The bats, the balls, 
the weather -- this is the essence of the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
Time is of the essence, too, with the exhibition opener next Monday and the 
season opener less than three weeks away, and that sense of urgency translated 
into a businesslike attitude among the players. 
</P>
<P>
Even the fans felt it. "I wish the players were friendlier," said Cathy Haught 
of Mesa, whose 4 1/2-year-old son, Houston, was distraught when Wally Joyner 
didn't stop to give him an autograph on the way to the field. "It's a big 
thing, living around here, to see the players come in every spring." 
</P>
<P>
Manager Doug Rader was pleased with what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
"It was awfully serious out here," said Rader, who plans to streamline the 
team's drills to eliminate seldom-used pickoff plays and other unnecessary 
exercises. "There wasn't really a whole lot of time to do anything but work. We 
had a full day and we utilized all the fields. Everybody involved on each field 
got a full day. . . . I don't think anybody had the energy to goof around too 
much." 
</P>
<P>
That's not to say there weren't smiles displayed when players greeted teammates 
they hadn't seen over the extended winter. Rader himself had a handshake or a 
joke for many as they filed out of the clubhouse and onto the field for a team 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Good to see you," pitcher Kirk McCaskill said to Rader, who pretended not to 
recognize McCaskill at first. "Good to see you," Rader said. "Hey, did you let 
your hair grow? You look like that guy . . . Kevin Costner? No, better than 
that. That Australian guy -- Mel Gibson. It looks good. Don't cut it." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the addition of Mark Langston gives the Angels depth they can use to 
obtain the leadoff hitter or power-hitting outfielder they have long sought. 
Port described his ongoing trade talks, which resumed when baseball resumed 
after the lockout, as "simmering, bubbling, not boiling." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Manager Doug Rader said that the second base job belongs to Johnny Ray "at the 
moment," and that he may use Mark McLemore elsewhere. Ray and McLemore have 
competed at second the last two several springs: McLemore opened the season at 
second in 1987 and 1988 but Ray won out in 1989, despite McLemore's .345 spring 
batting average. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing we need to address is we'll never know the capabilities of Mark 
McLemore if he continues to get so much playing time in the minor leagues and 
gets shuffled around," Rader said. "He needs to pass the test at the 
majorleague level. We need to have Mark on the major league club and give him 
quality at-bats to see if he's the player we think he is. One of our real goals 
this year is that we provide that for Mark."

MELVIN DURSLAG: WILL DODGERS STAND TEST OF (SHORT) TIME?

Mickey Mantle was having a quiet talk not long ago with Tom Lasorda, field 
commander of the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
"The money that Bo Jackson didn't get this year," said Mantle, "is more than I 
made in my lifetime as a player." 
</P>
<P>
Mantle was referring to the arbitration in which Bo asked $1,900,001 from 
Kansas City, only to be consigned to bread and water. 
</P>
<P>
He got but a million. 
</P>
<P>
It is the contention of today's entertainers, though, that they deserve greater 
riches, not only because the economics of sports has changed, but because those 
in it are a better-conditioned breed than those appearing earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why this season is an interesting test," says Lasorda. "The players 
have three weeks to do in training what they previously did in six. We'll find 
out if they're in the shape they always claim they are." 
</P>
<P>
It is rare that the major league player of today demeans himself between 
seasons tending bar, laying brick, or selling cars, as predecessors did. 
</P>
<P>
"Their commitment is to their body," says the Dodger manager. "Always working 
out, they tell us. They're running, lifting weights, dieting scientifically. 
We're about to find out how many shin splints, hamstring pulls and blisters 
show up around here. How many of our finely tuned machines will be ready 
opening day?" 
</P>
<P>
Because of the way things have gone this year, form becomes a fragile matter. 
</P>
<P>
"During the lockout," says Lasorda, "some teams, I'm sure, had players who did 
more to get into condition than others. Which teams they are I don't know, but 
they are the ones that are going to jump out in front when the season gets 
under way." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 38 players composing the Dodgers' major league roster this spring, only 
eight appeared in camp Tuesday in this palm-lined precinct. 
</P>
<P>
The others promised to report during the week, their departures from home no 
doubt delayed by last-minute meetings with their brokers. 
</P>
<P>
Orel Hershiser, who bought a home in Vero Beach as a winter convenience, 
reported to camp the first day after dropping off his 5-year-old son at school. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you playing because you changed the rules?" the kid asked his father. 
</P>
<P>
"Both sides changed the rules," Orel explained, patiently. 
</P>
<P>
A near-genius, young Hershiser wanted to know, if both sides were willing to 
change the rules, why they didn't do it before so that everyone could have come 
to play earlier. 
</P>
<P>
As proceedings resume, the Dodgers are happy to report that the work stoppage 
resulted in only 1% of their ticket clients asking for refunds. 
</P>
<P>
They have sold their customary 27,000 season seats, cutting off traffic at the 
figure. Always leveling an eye on a bank note, the Dodgers are bullish on 
attendance prospects if they produce a team that doesn't embarrass the art. 
</P>
<P>
"Why are the Dodgers successful?" we once inquired of Walter O'Malley, late 
owner of the troupe. 
</P>
<P>
"The Dodgers are successful," he answered, "because people always know where to 
find us." 
</P>
<P>
By that he meant, the cerebral trust of the Dodgers wouldn't be found on the 
golf course, in steam rooms or at lingering lunches featuring the dry martini. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't easy to sell a team that won only 77 games the previous season, but 
the Dodgers have ladled out money for a free agent named Hubie Brooks, gambling 
that his presence will be an asset. 
</P>
<P>
They are gambling, too, that yielding Mike Marshall and Alejandro Pena to the 
Mets for Juan Samuel won't result in a bust. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel steals a good base, but at bat last year for Philadelphia and New York, 
he hit 25 points below Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
And what appears to be the status of Kirk Gibson, whose artistry was offered an 
adoring public last year in only 71 games? 
</P>
<P>
Gibson has informed ownership that he would require a minimum of three weeks to 
attain condition approximating his professional standards. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers figure three weeks isn't bad, considering it took Michelangelo 
three years to do the Sistine Chapel. 
</P>
<P>
With six weeks of conditioning last year, Gibson hit .213, meaning he might 
have overtrained. 
</P>
<P>
Aiming to profit from Kirk's misadventure, baseball this time has arranged a 
shorter training period. 
</P>
<P>
And do those beloved fans, purported to be the losers, have recourse? 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, they do. If they have between two and three years' experience watching 
baseball, they can take their case to arbitration.

Illinois quarterback Jeff George, who completed 474 of 789 passes for 5,189 
yards in two seasons, said he would forgo his final year of college eligibility 
to make himself available for the NFL draft.

Christian Lacroix showed how to think '60s and dress '90s in one of the 
strongest collections of this season. He presented it Sunday morning in his 
couture salon that featured orange walls and shrimp-colored fashion runway. 
</P>
<P>
Using warm shades of pink, violet, moss green and chestnut, with bits of 
chartreuse thrown in, he built a collection around unitards and leggings; 
short, trapeze-shape dresses and coats; fitted suits, and long, full evening 
skirts. 
</P>
<P>
Without question, the unitard is about to become as basic to a modern woman's 
wardrobe as a slip used to be. Every top European designer now uses it as a 
starting point for a wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
Lacroix's versions were in harlequin prints, shown with only a silk velvet hood 
-- for women in perfect shape -- or, as a first layer followed by a suit or a 
hooded duffel coat. 
</P>
<P>
His daytime wardrobe relied on suits, some in Lurex-shot patchworks of plaids 
and checks, some with floral-print velvet jackets and nubby wool checked 
skirts. A new-looking pantsuit had a longer, fitted jacket and full trousers in 
matching moss green plaid, spiced up with a metallic tapestry vest. 
</P>
<P>
The best evening suits were cut close to the body with knee-baring skirts in 
mahogany-colored silk brocade. 
</P>
<P>
Lacroix added ponchos, velvet hobo hats decorated with small gold charms, and 
knee-high, black suede boots appliqued in gold leather for day and night. He 
used lots of thick, cable-stitched tights under boots for his favorite 
trapeze-shaped dresses made of fluid woolen prints. 
</P>
<P>
For informal formal wear he revived poor boy sweaters (heavily ribbed, with a 
crew neck) shot with Lurex, to wear with enormous, iridescent taffeta evening 
skirts. His two-layer dresses in gold lace and sheer silk had a dressier feel. 
</P>
<P>
Romeo Gigli has reduced his philosophy about modern dressing to its basic 
ingredients: cocoon coats, short and narrow pants, and redingotejackets. 
</P>
<P>
His fall line is built around these unusual components, in uncommon fabrics -- 
especially iridescent silk, wool and suede, richly embroidered with Moroccan, 
Middle European and Middle Eastern stitchery. 
</P>
<P>
The focus of nearly every outfit was one of his extraordinary cocoon coats. 
People consider them collector's items that ought to be hung on the wall, but 
Gigli and his assistant toss them on over blue jeans. 
</P>
<P>
This is the Italian-based designer's second season in Paris. (Gigli used to 
show in Milan.) But his decorative, romantic, ultra-feminine approach to 
fashion fits in well with the French. 
</P>
<P>
Both Karl Lagerfeld and Gianfranco Ferre designed one collection under their 
own names and another collection for a long-established French fashion house 
(Lagerfeld for Chanel; Ferre for Dior). 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the danger is that they will design old, venerable clothes for old, 
venerable houses. 
</P>
<P>
But both men seemed more comfortable than ever borrowing good ideas from their 
signature line and adapting them to their new fall collections for the other 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
It worked out well. 
</P>
<P>
For Chanel, Lagerfeld showed elongated jackets over very short pleated skirts, 
a look he used often in his own line, shown earlier this week. Evening suits 
that mixed sheer with solid black silk were part of both collections, too. All 
his variations for Chanel were a little more structured and ladylike. 
</P>
<P>
He used the gold chain links of Chanel handbags to trim little black suits with 
cropped jackets and short narrow skirts. Red woolen suits were trimmed in 
multiple rows of black and white rickrack, as were some new-looking, short, 
narrow coats worn over skirts just an inch or two longer. 
</P>
<P>
The bold houndstooth jackets he introduced several seasons ago were in strong 
supply. This time they were shown in black and ivory, over short black skirts, 
some narrow, some pleated. 
</P>
<P>
One strong new look for evening was an off-the-shoulder tunic in bright yellow 
satin with a slightly bell-shaped black satin skirt. High-heeled black satin 
shoes with a strap across the instep added some sizzle. 
</P>
<P>
Ferre's fall collection is his second for Dior. Unlike the first, this one 
showed off more of his personal talents and tastes. 
</P>
<P>
Ferre's skill with uncluttered sportswear in luxury fabrics translated to black 
leather turtleneck tops tucked into narrow wool pants, camel colored leather 
parkas with mink-trimmed hoods, and a number of straight-line narrow suits, 
especially one in red with covered buttons down the back of the skirt. The 
clothes were simple but not boring. 
</P>
<P>
A long, narrow jacket with a high button closure was more Italian than French 
(Dior probably would have put a curve at the waist), but Ferre is, after all, 
based in Milan. 
</P>
<P>
Ferre is not to be envied, having to work his own talents into the 
long-established Dior look. And there were some misses, especially in the 
evening wear that had too much or not enough going on. But this season Ferre 
seemed more comfortable with integrating his personal style into the Dior 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Valentino could have ended his show just after it began, with the suits. They 
looked energetic, modern and easy to wear, and they were the best part of his 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
He used a narrow-cut shirttail jacket in woodsy green tweed over a pleated, 
checked skirt. He put a small-checked blouson jacket over a short, circle skirt 
in rose tweed. Both options looked even newer, worn with over-the-knee-suede 
boots. A day-into-evening-suit had a sequined, wool checked skirt with 
sewn-down pleats, and a waist-length plaid jacket. 
</P>
<P>
Some evening wear ideas worked much better than others. Knife-pleated skirts 
worn with a pair of lace tops modeled after sweater sets had a sporty elegance. 
But a group of black silk evening dresses sequined with images from ancient 
Etruscan vases didn't work as well primarily because the clothes they decorated 
fought for all the attention. This may not prove to be one of Valentino's most 
important collections, but women who love his clothes will have more than 
enough to choose from.

A REFEREE IN THE CORNER OF L. A.'S ELDERLY

<P>
Doris Lindsey of Woodland Hills recalled the time she was summoned by an 
octogenarian woman in a nursing home. The problem was a hearing aid. 
</P>
<P>
"She had been having trouble adjusting hers. And for some reason, her 
conservator, who was her cousin, would take the hearing aid home with him after 
every time he visited. 
</P>
<P>
"She complained to me, and when I had verified that the story was true . . . I 
sought out the cousin, and now that woman has her hearing aid with her in the 
nursing home all the time." Lindsey is a Los Angeles city volunteer in a 
nationwide program that provides residents in nursing, retirement and day-care 
homes -- and their relatives or friends -- with someone to turn to if problems 
crop up: the Long-Term Care Ombudsman. 
</P>
<P>
The federally funded program has been in effect about 10 years, according to 
the city's program coordinator, Charisse Anderson-Rollins, but it has only been 
with the recent, continuing increase in the number of older people in the 
population that its caseload has grown tremendously. 
</P>
<P>
The city has about 480 licensed skilled nursing homes, residential care 
facilities for the elderly and adult day health centers, with about 35,000 
residents, according to Natalie Miles-Thompson, associate executive director of 
WISE Senior Services in Santa Monica, which administers both the city and 
county ombudsman program. And the other incorporated cities and unincorporated 
areas of the county have an additional 500 homes and care facilities, 
Miles-Thompson said, with about 40,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
(The toll-free phone number for general program information and to learn the 
location of a specific local office is (800) 334-9473.) 
</P>
<P>
According to state law, each facility must conspicuously post a notice 
regarding the availability of a public ombudsman, who is empowered to serve as 
an advocate and to assist with complaints. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, for example, might involve a person with diabetes who feels he or 
she is getting foods containing sugar. The individual will be interviewed, 
medical records may be checked. Sometimes the complaints have a basis in fact, 
sometimes not, Anderson-Rollins said. 
</P>
<P>
This is the way the city program works, according to Anderson-Rollins (the 
county setup is similar): 
</P>
<P>
"When we get a complaint, either by phone or in the mail, we assign a staff 
ombudsman or a volunteer to investigate. It is a state law violation per se if 
a facility denies access (to the ombudsman) or interferes with the 
investigation." 
</P>
<P>
The problem is a shortage of people to investigate complaints. The city, for 
instance, has five part-timers on the staff. It has 25 active volunteers -- at 
least 90 are being sought. The office receives about 375 complaints a month. 
The county averages 480 a month, has 120 volunteers and needs 200. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers must complete a 36-hour training class and are asked to donate four 
hours a week. "The attrition rate of ombudsmen is high," Anderson-Rollins said. 
"It's the stress and burnout." 
</P>
<P>
In the state of California, she added, the number of volunteer ombudsmen has 
dropped from about 1,000 to 700 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsey, a volunteer for three years, said she usually winds up putting in 
eight to 10 hours a week. Although, eventually, everything is investigated, a 
facility isn't always found to be at fault: 
</P>
<P>
"One lady in her 70s had bumped her head on the bedrail and had blackened her 
eye. A couple of days later, a worker was feeding her, and she bit one of his 
fingers. Her daughter called, thinking the black eye had resulted from the 
biting," Lindsey said, meaning abuse was involved. 
</P>
<P>
Allegations of elder abuse get top priority, Miles-Thompson said, but in this 
instance the ombudsman determined the black eye had occurred two days before 
the biting. 
</P>
<P>
Eleanor Countee, one of the city staff members, commented: "We are the foot 
soldiers. We go out and do the fighting. Sometimes I have a nursing home 
representative, and the patient, and a family member together -- and I act as 
the referee." 
</P>
<P>
She added that she currently has 40 cases at different stages of resolution. "I 
do only 20 hours a week -- on purpose. After about 16 hours of it, I start 
feeling the depression and stress." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson-Rollins said there are occasional cases where some patients "will 
decide to gang up on the administration, out of frustration and loneliness. 
That is why it is important to have resident council meetings where gripes can 
be aired and to have a good social activity calendar." 
</P>
<P>
Julia Biderman, a staff ombudsman whose area encompasses the East San Fernando 
Valley, said one of her cases involves a 76-year-old widow who claims that when 
she left one retirement facility for another, the former one refused to refund 
her $280 deposit. 
</P>
<P>
Biderman said she has gotten in touch with the administrators at the home and 
that they have promised to refund the money. 
</P>
<P>
Eileen Greene is a former volunteer who now teaches volunteers during their 
required training. 
</P>
<P>
"We need them, but I have to know their motivations. I want to see if they 
truly care about older people, if they have compassion, and an average amount 
of intelligence." 
</P>
<P>
Years ago, she said, "if there was a problem at a facility, there was nobody 
for a resident to turn to. So you didn't rock the boat." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson-Rollins said there has been an increase in complaints regarding 
over-medication and the administering of improper medication. 
</P>
<P>
"The residents themselves often don't know, that's the sad part," she said. "We 
get complaints from people visiting them and noticing physical or personality 
changes. Also, we get anonymous tips from people inside a facility, who are 
afraid of retaliation." 
</P>
<P>
Richard L. Thorpe, executive vice president of the Alexandria, Va.-based 
American College of Health Care Administrators, noted that good facilities 
welcome the presence of an ombudsman. 
</P>
<P>
Thorpe, whose society of long-term care administrators has 6,500 members 
nationwide, added that the highest level of care "can be done only with the 
collective action of staff, patients, families, and their representatives -- 
the ombudsmen. We also view the ombudsman as a mediator, not only representing 
the patient, but the facility."

SCHOOL GUNS: Guns are becoming more common in Orange County schools, according 
to Presiding Juvenile Court Judge C. Robert Jameson. Jameson says he is hearing 
about one firearms case a day now, compared to one a week five years ago. . . . 
Principals in South County high schools have also noted the increase; students 
say they carry the weapons for protection. . . . "Now it's happening in 
community schools in economic and racial areas where it may not have been 
happening before," Jameson said. Mark I. Pinsky and David Reyes

O.C.'S HOMELESS ARE IN DEMAND ON CENSUS NIGHT

The minibus arrived promptly at 6 p.m. in front of St. John's Lutheran Church 
and the passengers, familiar with the shelter routine, quickly formed a line at 
the door. 
</P>
<P>
The church's aging gymnasium seemed vast, dotted with a dozen or so cots, the 
floor covered with a blue tarpaulin. But within minutes, the home of the church 
basketball team, choir club practice and the potluck dinner became a temporary 
refuge for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The immediate concern for the 25 or so men and women was cots: Were they 
assigned, were there more? And blankets? And where were the showers, and when 
would dinner be served? 
</P>
<P>
Among this disparate collection of Orange County's street people, there was 
very little talk about the first-ever count of the nation's homeless. But St. 
John's opened its doors Tuesday to help census takers reach as many homeless as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
City and county officials have urged shelter operators and their clients to 
cooperate with the census, as the area's claim to federal aid for homeless 
programs will depend in large measure on the number of people surveyed. Across 
the country, civic leaders raced Tuesday to round up homeless people, many of 
whom crave their anonymity, and shuttle them to areas where census workers 
could reach them. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way that everyone will be counted," said Susan Oakson of the 
Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force. "But we know that policy decisions 
and funding will be based on this information, and for our community it is 
important to make as accurate a count as possible. What has to be understood is 
that this information will be just a slice." 
</P>
<P>
Across Orange County, homeless people by the hundreds came in from the 
darkness. Some of them complied nervously, others with unfounded fears that 
being uncooperative would get them arrested. 
</P>
<P>
St. John's was one of two churches that opened their doors to the homeless in 
conjunction with Tuesday night's count. 
</P>
<P>
Orangethorpe United Methodist Church in Fullerton was the other, and it was 
there that Richard Martinez, who showed up in search of a place to sleep, 
agreed to be counted. But he remained skeptical of the promise that his lot 
will improve because of his cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a political thing," he said. "They say that there will be more money for 
social programs just to get us to fill it out." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Driber, program coordinator of the Anchor House in San Clemente, said 
many of the homeless people with whom he spoke were wary of the census. "Some 
are willing to be very cooperative," he said. "Others have the feeling: 'Why 
bother? The system hasn't done anything for me, and it's getting worse.' " 
</P>
<P>
Still, all the residents of Anchor House cooperated, egged on by census 
officials who informed them that "they had no choice," Driber said. Although it 
is illegal to refuse to cooperate with census takers, such cases are rarely 
prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the reservations, many homeless people gathered in the lobbies, 
gymnasiums and corridors of shelters filling out forms that would document 
their homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a good idea to acknowledge these people and myself, to find out what the 
reality is," said Eugene Binau, 35, who has mostly slept on the concrete steps 
of Santa Ana Civic Center during the four months he has been homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Binau, a Santa Ana native and an unemployed auto painter, said this is the 
first time that he has experienced living on the street. "It only takes one or 
two things to go wrong. Like if you can't find a job quick enough, then you can 
lose it all," he said, standing on the steps of the church. 
</P>
<P>
Gezabel Burke, 28, sat with a towel wrapped around her just-washed hair at the 
Martha House in Orange. Burke, a student at Golden West College, became 
homeless after her boyfriend threatened to kill her and she sought refuge in a 
shelter for battered women. 
</P>
<P>
"They should have asked other questions, like 'are there drug problems in the 
home?' and 'is there alcoholism in these places?' ".

CENSUS BEGINS WITH THE NATION'S HOMELESS; 
</P>
<P>
COUNT: 15,000 FAN OUT FOR MONUMENTAL OVERNIGHT TASK. MANY MEET DIFFICULTIES. 
INCOMPLETE TALLY IS EXPECTED.

<P>
The 1990 United States census began Tuesday night on a somber note, as census 
takers set out to measure the size of a successful nation's conspicuous failure 
-- its population of homeless citizens. 
</P>
<P>
With a budget of $2.7 million and a staff approaching 15,000, the U.S. Census 
Bureau attempted to count on one night a population that has been estimated to 
number anywhere from 250,000 to more than 3 million. Census takers went to 
11,000 shelters and an equal number of outdoor haunts, from heating grates in 
New York City to San Francisco's Golden Gate Park; from river banks in Colorado 
to "spider holes" -- man-made burrows in Southern California canyons. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, more than 200 census takers fanned out for the homeless 
tally, checking about 500 different spots that ranged from shelters and 
flophouses to freeway underpasses and hillside encampments of migrant workers. 
Although no figures were available from the count Tuesday, previous estimates 
have placed Orange County's homeless population at 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
The monumental effort marked the first time the census has counted homeless 
people separate from the rest of the population, most of whom are to receive 
census forms in the mail later this week. 
</P>
<P>
Counting the homeless was not expected to go smoothly, and it didn't. 
Throughout the day, there were glitches and missed opportunities by the score. 
</P>
<P>
In Vermont, 22 inches of snow slowed the count. In Detroit, there weren't 
nearly enough census takers to take inventory of the army of squatters living 
in the city's 10,000 abandoned buildings. There were plenty of people who 
refused to be counted, and a few who caused consternation by the answers they 
gave to the census. 
</P>
<P>
In New York City, there one man who insisted he was Jesus Christ. 
</P>
<P>
"He was nice and cooperative," said census taker Craig Lebin, "but he kept 
telling me he was married to God." 
</P>
<P>
Census officials conceded their count of homeless people was not expected to be 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
At a Washington press conference Tuesday, Census Bureau director Barbara Bryant 
said that while the homeless count wouldn't be exhaustive, it will "get the 
vast majority . . . these numbers will be believable. Is it hundreds of 
thousands? Is it millions? We're going to show that kind of scope." 
</P>
<P>
Byrant herself, however, encountered evidence of flaws in the counting. She 
toured New York's Port Authority bus terminal, where she found at least 100 
homeless persons -- but no census takers to count them. Bryant promised to 
dispatch counters Wednesday night 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, John Reeder, head of the Census Bureau's California operations, 
said the count would be a "conservative" one. 
</P>
<P>
Reeder said that the bureau was prepared to continue counting homeless every 
night this week if it became apparent Tuesday that there were more homeless 
people than the census takers could handle. 
</P>
<P>
He made it clear census takers would not take certain risks. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going on rooftops, looking in abandoned cars or peering into 
dumpsters," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the novel exercise was shaping up as an all-night, national 
spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, the census takers, wary of ambush, planned 
to keep to the park's lighted perimeters, calling out for any homeless persons 
hiding in the bushes to come forward and be counted. 
</P>
<P>
In the nation's capital, wary homeless advocates were attempting to thwart the 
census, refusing to allow counters inside a shelter where more than 1,000 
homeless were said to have congregated. 
</P>
<P>
In Detroit, several homeless people telephoned the Census Bureau from the 
office of a wrecking company, where they said they had broken in to spend the 
night. They invited census takers to come out and count them. Five enumerators 
were dispatched, and the survey was completed with the promise that police 
would not be informed of the countees' whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
And in Los Angeles, buses were being hastily arranged to haul homeless from the 
rougher streets of South-Central to armories and emergency shelters for 
counting. 
</P>
<P>
Reeder said that six units of U.S. Naval Reserves would be patrolling the 
streets of Los Angeles to help ensure the safety of census takers. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we are concerned about security. We cannot take police because it 
would breach confidentiality," he said. But he added that there would be an 
increased police presence on the streets of the city while the homeless census 
was in progress. 
</P>
<P>
Security in Orange County was less intense. Census officials briefed police 
departments, but there were no unusual measures taken and no problems reported 
by late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In big cities, small towns and everywhere else American homeless congregate, it 
was clear Tuesday evening that the census takers had their work cut out for 
them. Finding the homeless posed one major difficulty, persuading them to 
cooperate was another. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of people who won't be counted, and I'm one of them," said 
Arthur Young, 34, a resident of the streets and shelters of Orange County since 
October. "I don't feel like they need to know a thing about me. They're not 
doing anything for me." 
</P>
<P>
Young said he didn't believe the count would be accurate. Walking outside the 
YMCA in Santa Ana, he pointed to homeless people sleeping on a ramp around a 
building that disappeared into darkness. 
</P>
<P>
"I know they won't be counting there" because of the potential danger, Young 
said. "I wouldn't go there myself." 
</P>
<P>
In Houston, a ponytailed young man named James, who declined to reveal his last 
name, said the census takers' questions "stunk. A lot of the questions didn't 
apply to us -- like 'Are you here on business or vacation.' " 
</P>
<P>
Toni Davis, 32, worried that census questions would probe too deeply into her 
past. Davis said that she and her husband were prospering from a methadrine 
lab, allowing them and their five children to own a house, "until we were 
arrested." She said that the census form asked "whether we had income from this 
or this. They didn't ask about illegal activities," she said with a sigh of 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
The all-night homeless census took place in three phases. From 6 p.m. to 
midnight, census takers went to armories, shelters, missions, church basements, 
flop houses and hotels that cost $12 or less a night. 
</P>
<P>
Between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m., the effort focused on bus stations, night owl 
theaters, subways, bridges, highway underpasses and the myriad outdoor 
locations favored by the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
In the final phase, lasting until 8 a.m., the census takers were to station 
themselves near dumpsters and abandoned buildings, waiting to interview people 
as they emerged in the morning light. 
</P>
<P>
Census Bureau officials said that people found asleep on the streets were not 
to be wakened. Instead, census takers were to note their presence and try to 
guess sex and race. 
</P>
<P>
California presented a host of challenges to census takers who were responsible 
for canvassing streets and parks frequented by gangs and drug dealers as well 
as making their way to the river banks, canyons, beaches and orange groves that 
provide hide-outs to the rural homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the obstacles, the homeless count was the most ambitious ever 
undertaken. To entice the homeless to come in out of the cold and be counted, 
emergency shelters were opened around the country. Soup kitchens offered free 
dinners and shelters gave away blankets to people who showed up Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Traveling in teams, carrying walkie-talkies, wearing uniform vests, census 
takers attempted to count people in every city with a population of 50,000 or 
more and in smaller cities where local governments provided lists of homeless 
habitats. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Taeuber, who coordinated the nationwide homeless census from the bureau's 
Washington headquarters, said she was more confident of the accuracy of 
counting in shelters and other indoor locations and somewhat pessimistic about 
finding people in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"We just haven't been able to come up with a reliable means of coming to grips 
with the hidden homeless," she said. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the homeless census, the Census Bureau funded monitoring operations 
in five cities, including Los Angeles. The monitors were stationed in a number 
of outdoor homeless enclaves to check whether census takers actually visited 
those locations and to assess how diligent they were when they did visit. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. census is taken every decade. A decision on whether to count homeless 
separately every decade has not been made. 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau received widespread cooperation from shelters and homeless 
advocates. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, The Homeless Outreach Program in Los Angeles and Los Caballeros, 
a businessman's organization, sponsored a dinner for 1,000 homeless people, 
served them steak and pudding pie and urged them to take part in the census. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, authorities set up temporary shelters in a pair of churches 
to lure the homeless out of the cold and make it easier on census takers. 
</P>
<P>
At Orangethorpe United Methodist Church in Fullerton, counting took place in a 
large auditorium-like room. Some of the 44 men who participated were given 
sleeping bags as a gift for showing up. 
</P>
<P>
"They are very friendly," said Ed Paul, 49, a revenue manager for the city of 
Fullerton who is part of the city's census team. "This is an easier group to 
deal with than, say, a lunch crowd if you've got monitor duty at a high 
school." 
</P>
<P>
In some cases misinformation about the census caused people to be left out. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Monica's Memorial Park, census takers arrived to count homeless 
congregated at a temporary shelter only to discover that they had forgotten a 
crucial tool: their pencils. 
</P>
<P>
There also were protests by people who do not believe that a complete count is 
possible and who believe that an undercount will be used to justify spending 
cuts for affordable housing and for the social services that many homeless 
people rely on. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, members of the Community for Creative Non-Violence dumped sand 
in front of the Commerce Department's Herbert Hoover Building near the White 
House and displayed a banner that read "Like grains of sand, the homeless 
cannot be counted." 
</P>
<P>
Just before 8 p.m., a contingent of census workers were turned away from a 
shelter operated by the Community for Creative Non-Violence, an organization 
formed by Mitch Snyder, one of the nation's prominent homeless advocates. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder, who sees the homeless count as a political ploy to understate the 
national problem, estimated that there were 1,400 people at the center in 
northwest Washington. However, Snyder said that about 80 of the shelter's 
residents filled out census forms, and he turned over the completed forms to a 
Census Bureau official. 
</P>
<P>
Census workers had mixed reports about the cooperation they were receiving from 
the homeless. Mike Roberts, a census worker in Washington, said he encountered 
hostility to the census among the city's street people. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got a lot of folks out there -- even though there has been a lot of 
attention to the count -- not wanting to cooperate," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another census worker, Cheryl Marshall, said she sensed a different 
spirit: "I think we're having a real good turnout judging from the phone calls 
we've been getting from people saying they need more forms and materials." 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, Stephen Switzer, a spokesman for the Sacramento Homeless 
Organizing Committee, said he thought the count was likely to find only 15% to 
20% of the homeless. Switzer said that many who live in the brush and on the 
banks of the Sacramento and American Rivers have been intimidated by recent 
police sweeps of their camps and would not emerge to take part in the census.

<P>
Questions for the Homeless 
</P>
<P>
Census-takers seeking to count the nation's homeless Tuesday carried a list of 
33 questions to ask of those who chose to cooperate. Among the questions were: 
</P>
<P>
When did you come to the United States to stay? 
</P>
<P>
Have you ever been on active duty military service in the armed forces of the 
United States? 
</P>
<P>
Do you have a physical, mental or other health condition that has lasted for 
six or more months and . . . prevents you from working at a job? 
</P>
<P>
Because of a health condition that has lasted for six or more months, do you 
have any difficulty going outside alone (or) taking care of your own personal 
needs, such as bathing, dressing or getting around inside the home? 
</P>
<P>
How many babies have you ever had, not counting stillbirths? 
</P>
<P>
When did you last work, even for a few days? 
</P>

FERGUSON BILL AIMED AT ADULT NEWS RACKS FAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Worried about a possible infringement on First Amendment guarantees of free 
speech, a Senate committee on Tuesday moved to bury a bill sponsored by 
Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) that would all but ban the sale of 
sexually explicit tabloids from sidewalk news racks. 
</P>
<P>
The intent of the measure was to keep graphic pornography out of the hands of 
minors, whom Ferguson and others claimed have used their school lunch money to 
buy the tabloids from the stands found near doughnut shops, post offices and 
grocery stores in places such as Huntington Beach and Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by Los Angeles County and the state's PTA, Ferguson's bill would curtail 
the sale of sex-related newspapers by requiring those showing sex acts or lewd 
depictions of genitalia to post adult supervisors at the coin-operated stands 
-- an economic burden designed to drive the publications out of business or 
into private establishments such as adult bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
The measure gained surprising support from some civil libertarians in the 
Assembly and seemed to be gaining behind-the-scenes momentum on the Senate side 
before Tuesday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
But the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 5-4 to stop the Ferguson bill by 
holding onto it for interim study, a move that many acknowledged was the death 
knell for the measure this year. 
</P>
<P>
"At least it's gone for the time being," said Margaret Pena, legislative 
director for the American Civil Liberties Union, which opposed the bill. 
"You've seen the proponents on the bill. They'll be here next year and the year 
after that." 
</P>
<P>
In voting to hold onto the bill, Sen. Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) cited possible 
First Amendment problems with the way it tried to restrict the sale of the 
tabloids. Instead of concentrating on the "time, place and manner" of the news 
rack sales, the measure instead dwelt on the contents of the publications, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sympathetic to families trying to inculcate values that they believe in 
their children," said Lockyer. "I'm not sure that state intervention in 
people's lives is the way to accomplish that." 
</P>
<P>
"It probably means that a family has already failed when it hasn't taught the 
kid before: 'This is junk. You're not interested in that,' " he said. "And if 
they (minors) have an interest in it, they're going to find a way to get it." 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson, however, said his measure was aimed at relocating the sale of the 
explicit magazines, not regulating their contents. He said state laws already 
ban the sale of such sex-related tabloids near schools and parks. 
</P>
<P>
"It might be more obvious to them if there's a loophole in the law that allowed 
liquor, whiskey, to be sold from a vending machine from which they (minors) had 
access," Ferguson said. "They would quickly see that that's a loophole and they 
would do away with it." 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson also said Tuesday's vote was a "shocking surprise" because he had been 
led to believe by some senators that they would be voting for his bill. 
Although he declined to name names, he added: "I'm disappointed by the Los 
Angeles vote." 
</P>
<P>
Among those voting to shelve the bill were President Pro Tempore David A. 
Roberti (D-Los Angeles) and Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles). Others were 
Lockyer, Milton Marks (D-San Francisco) and Barry Keene (D-Benicia). 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, Ferguson said he received a telephone call from a 
representative of Catholic Archbishop Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles, whose 
office has decided to "try to intercede" with Roberti and Torres to switch 
their votes and unearth the proposal before the end of the legislative session 
on Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson's effort is his third since 1987, and is follow-up legislation to his 
1988 bill that prohibited the sex-related newspapers from putting "harmful 
matter" on their covers to spur news rack sales. 
</P>
<P>
Senators voting to approve Ferguson's bill were Ed Davis (R-Valencia); Robert 
Presley (D-Riverside), Edward R. Royce (R-Anaheim) and John Doolittle 
(R-Rocklin).

DIANNE KLEIN: CLASSROOM CIVILITY CRUMBLES WHEN WAR TOYS SURFACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dianne Klein 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Children's Center at Cal State Fullerton, daytime home to more than 200 
infants, toddlers and preschoolers, puts into practice what assistant director 
Susan Hopkins calls a "non-sexist, non-aggressive, anti-bias curriculum." 
</P>
<P>
This means lots of good things, which I saw the other morning in Jan 
Sheffield's class of 4- and 5-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
Boys and girls play with Legos and blocks, or pretend to be shopping for 
costume jewelry at the store. They draw pictures, fiddle with a doll house and 
mold clay. Smiles are easy, giggles abound. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, everybody is getting along. When they don't, problems are 
talked, rather than shouted, out. No hitting is allowed. Apologies for misdeeds 
and hurt feelings are given and accepted. This is how many think childhood is 
supposed to be. 
</P>
<P>
This is also what they call a controlled environment -- until I came along and 
messed it all up. 
</P>
<P>
 I had been wondering about all these New Wave war toys: all the dire warnings 
about what they do to impressionable young minds. There are lots of studies and 
books being written about this today. 
</P>
<P>
So the Children's Center said that I was welcome to witness a little 
experiment, before and after, to see if war toys change the way that kids play, 
or alter the way that they think. 
</P>
<P>
Jan assembles her class and explains that I am from the newspaper. Then she 
indulges in what we grown-ups call a white lie. 
</P>
<P>
She says that I've brought along a bag of toys -- they really belong to Susan, 
who uses them in professional workshops -- and that I'd like to see what they 
think. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, how many of you know what this is?" Jan asks as she pulls out a packaged 
G.I. Joe Dreadnok Cycle, a menacing replica of some Road Warriorish motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, wow!" the boys yell, almost in unison. "I have it! I have it at home!" 
</P>
<P>
"You can use it to throw bombs!" Sean says. "I like it." "Does it shoot fire?" 
Jan wants to know. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah!" comes the chorus of young male voices. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly the GI Joe Dreadnok Cycle is one of the coolest things around. Nine 
little boys tell me as much with their expressions and their words. But the 
girls, all eight of them, are aghast. 
</P>
<P>
If they got one for their birthdays, they say they would dump it in the trash. 
</P>
<P>
By this time, of course, the kids are getting the idea. The code has crashed. 
Not only has the lady from the newspaper brought toys, but she has brought the 
really good bad stuff, the kind of thing that they see on TV. Until now, 
they've never seen this kind of thing here. 
</P>
<P>
A My Little Pony, a pink plastic horse with a long mane and tail, is next out 
of the bag of tricks. The girls gush. They love it, they say. They've got scads 
of Little Ponies at home. The boys are grossing out. Some say that the first 
thing they'd do is whack off its hair. 
</P>
<P>
A Thundercats doll, a grotesque looking creature armed to the hilt, is what Jan 
displays now. 
</P>
<P>
The boys are thinking that things can't get much better than this. Yeah! Yeah! 
They want one of those for their birthdays. They see Thundercats on TV! 
</P>
<P>
Now everyone's forgetting the rule about sitting down. It's unenforceable, Jan 
sees. In a flash, the kids are on their knees, then their feet, crowding around 
for a better look. 
</P>
<P>
"What would you do with this?" Jan asks. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd go chchchch with the gun!" says Patrick, spraying his classmates with 
imaginary firepower. 
</P>
<P>
Then out comes the G.I. Joe tissue paper, what in another reincarnation could 
be just an average pocket pack used for some peaceful pastime like wiping a 
runny nose. From the pictures on the front of the G.I. Joe tissues, however, it 
looks like you're supposed to use them to soak up lots of blood. 
</P>
<P>
The boys are enthralled. They're elbowing each other, shouting out of turn. The 
girls are whining that the lady from the newspaper didn't bring enough girl 
toys. Everybody's forgetting the rules about staying put and doing what they're 
told. 
</P>
<P>
"How come we can't keep these toys at school?" Patrick says. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Masters of the Universe book appears. The boys hoot with glee. The 
girls, a little slower on the uptake, join in too. There's He-man and Sheera 
and Battlecat and Orko and Skelatar! 
</P>
<P>
"How many of you watch this on TV?" Jan asks. All but two of the children flail 
their arms in the air. 
</P>
<P>
Then Jan flips through the pages of the book. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, they're fighting!" says one of the young voices, indistinguishable from 
the others competing to be heard. "Yeah! Go get 'em." 
</P>
<P>
Jesse and Andrew, by now, are play fighting themselves. Another little boy is 
in tears. The girls are banding together, off to the side. Things are close to 
out of control. 
</P>
<P>
"Why do you like these toys?" I ask. 
</P>
<P>
Eager preschoolers nearly stampede in the rush to tell me why, why, why. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it because He-man fights the bad guy and punches his ears out!" Sean 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it cause it has bombs and lots of people and fire coming out and things 
blow up!" Jesse shouts. 
</P>
<P>
Then all the kids show and tell what the bad guys look like. Fingers go in 
mouths, push up noses, contort eyes. One little girl says bad guys have 
dreadlocks. A boy says they are big and ugly. 
</P>
<P>
He-man, well, you can tell that he's good. He's tall and blond and handsome. 
That, they suggest, is what being good is all about. 
</P>
<P>
So you draw your own conclusions. I already have mine. 
</P>
<P>
National sales of war toys top $1 billion a year, up 200% over the past 10 
years, and the average American child watches about four hours of action-packed 
cartoons, a veritable blitzkrieg of automated violence, every day. 
</P>
<P>
Kids go crazy for the stuff. Except then they start acting that way too. Kill 
him, zap her; burn, slash and bomb. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, I know, children have always played war. It's natural and it's fun. 
</P>
<P>
But there's a meaner, more technologically hip edge to it all today, one that I 
didn't notice growing up with Bugs Bunny and that bumbling hunter, Elmer Fudd. 
</P>
<P>
As I'm leaving the Children's Center, Jan, Susan and I start talking about what 
we've observed: rising aggression levels and lots of "them vs. us." 
</P>
<P>
They've never seen these kids act quite like this before.

IT'S NO YOKE -- SPRING IS HERE; 
</P>
<P>
A LITTLE MADNESS IN THE SPRING IS WHOLESOME EVEN FOR THE KING. -- EMILY 
DICKINSON 
</P>

<P>
Or even for a city councilman. 
</P>
<P>
For example, on Tuesday afternoon, the Honorable Earl J. Prescott was on his 
hands and knees on his patio deck in Tustin, his face nearly scraping the 
concrete. 
</P>
<P>
He was carefully balancing six dozen eggs upright on the broad ends of their 
shells. They stood at attention like a marching band. 
</P>
<P>
This is what Prescott likes to do on the first day of spring. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an old Chinese tradition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some say it's Japanese. Others say it's Scandinavian. Some say it's doo-doo. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, believers insist that on the vernal equinox, when the sun is 
directly over the Equator, the alignment of Sun and Earth affects gravitation, 
allowing eggs to balance more easily. 
</P>
<P>
It also happens to be the official beginning of spring. 
</P>
<P>
It occurred Tuesday at 1:19 p.m. Pacific time, when Prescott was just about 
done erecting his eggs. A breeze made the task more difficult and, by 2 p.m., 
had blown them all over, but they stood long enough for Prescott to claim that 
he had scientifically proved his point. 
</P>
<P>
He said he first heard about equinox egg balancing on a TV newscast and tried 
it successfully during the autumnal equinox, the beginning of fall. And when he 
tried at an off-time, during the winter, he failed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real phenomenon. It's something you can't do at other times of the 
year," he insisted. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists tend to put this "phenomenon" in the category of old wives' tales. 
Prescott's wife, however, insists that her husband "has both oars in the 
water." 
</P>
<P>
"I challenge anyone to refute this," Prescott said. "I challenge anyone three 
months from now to duplicate what I did today." 
</P>
<P>
To duplicate it will require a research grant totaling $13.26, or the cost of 
two dozen extra-large white eggs, two dozen extra-large brown eggs and two 
dozen jumbo white eggs. 
</P>
<P>
It also will require an impartial observer because there are ways to cheat: 
like shaking the egg to break the yoke and concentrate more weight at the 
bottom; or cracking the egg slightly at the bottom to flatten it; or sticking 
wax to the bottom. Prescott swears he didn't do any of that. 
</P>
<P>
How serious is Prescott, really? 
</P>
<P>
"I intend to make this a family tradition," he said. "It's to celebrate, to 
welcome in spring." 
</P>
<P>
To others less occupied with ritual, Tuesday must have seemed more like summer 
than spring. Inland temperatures soared -- 88 in Santa Ana, 87 in Anaheim, 85 
in El Toro -- falling just short of the 90-degree record two years ago for this 
date. 
</P>
<P>
"Hot and muggy," reported Paul Leighton at Caspers Wilderness Park east of San 
Juan Capistrano. "It feels like summer." he said.

REQUEST TO FORCE ELECTION VOTE DENIED 
</P>

<P>
A court ruling on Tuesday prompted cries of victory from both sides in a battle 
over the scheduled April 10 election. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a decision by the 4th District Court of Appeal in favor of John Kelly 
and Earl J. Prescott, who hope to stop the April election, preparations for the 
election are proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
The court denied a request by the Tustin city clerk to force Kelly and Prescott 
to vote for a resolution setting precinct boards and other election details. 
But City Atty. James Rourke said that a preliminary appeals court ruling last 
week said the city clerk appears to have the authority to establish the 
precinct boards on her own. And indeed, following a denial of her suit at the 
Superior Court level, the city clerk set the polling places and workers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going ahead with the election. The court gave us the nod," Councilwoman 
Ursula E. Kennedy said Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Prescott said he is pleased with the court ruling but unhappy with the 
situation. "What really upsets me is that twice we've been in court now and 
twice we've had a legal victory and twice they've tried to claim a political 
victory," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although this battle is over, the war over the election issue continues. 
Earlier this month, Prescott filed a complaint in Superior Court asking that 
the ordinance moving the election from November to April be ruled invalid. He 
and Kelly allege that it was illegally approved. That action is still pending.

CITY ADOPTS BROADER ANTI-GRAFFITI EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council this week approved a new graffiti-removal program that 
includes rewards of up to $300 for people who report those who deface public or 
private property. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a far more aggressive program than we've had in the past to deal with 
the problem of graffiti in our community," said City Manager George Tindall. 
</P>
<P>
This week's action broadens the city's existing graffiti-removal program. The 
key points include: 
</P>
<P>
A public relations campaign to promote the program through news releases, a 
speakers bureau and information sheets with the city water bills. 
</P>
<P>
* The establishment of an annual graffiti cleanup day in May and a graffiti hot 
line number. 
</P>
<P>
* New provisions in the municipal code for removal of graffiti from private 
property with the permission of the owner. 
</P>
<P>
* A reward system under which those who report graffiti will receive rewards of 
up to $300 but limited to $1,500 a year for information leading to the arrest 
and conviction of people applying graffiti. The funds for the rewards would be 
donated by local civic and service groups. Tindall said about $1,300 has 
already been raised for the program. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is modeled on a similar program in Anaheim, where $500 rewards are 
given. JAMES TORTOLANO

COUNTY TO FIGHT OVER RETIREE INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE ELLEN O'CONNOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors agreed Tuesday to fight a judge's order that the 
county provide medical coverage for thousands of retired county workers whose 
insurance benefits were slashed more than a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors reached an agreement to appeal the March 9 ruling by Superior 
Court Judge Claude M. Owens during a closed-door executive session after 
Tuesday's regular board meeting in Santa Ana, county officials said. Board 
members declined to comment on their decision because of the litigation. 
</P>
<P>
In his ruling earlier this month, Owens chastised the county for its "cavalier" 
decision to discontinue the insurance coverage and said its actions violated an 
obscure state law governing medical benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"We very respectfully disagree with the judge's opinion," said Lois Jeffrey, 
special counsel to the county. "As far as we know, no one has ever interpreted 
the statute that way and it's been on the books for 27 years." 
</P>
<P>
If Owen's ruling is not overturned, the cost of paying insurance premiums for 
the county's 4,600 retirees could climb to $90 million annually by 1995, 
Jeffrey said. In addition, county officials have estimated that reimbursing 
retirees for benefits denied them since 1982 could cost another $42 million to 
$50 million. 
</P>
<P>
The county stopped paying insurance benefits for workers who retired after 
1979. But the Orange County Employees Assn. did not file suit until 1985 and 
the claims are limited by a three-year statute of limitations. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the cost to the county would be prohibitive, the county's special 
counsel said. 
</P>
<P>
"The county doesn't have the revenues," Jeffrey said. "They would have to look 
at potentially laying people off or canceling some existing programs." We're 
limited as to what we can do with taxes by Proposition 13 and assorted other 
laws." 
</P>
<P>
Among retirees fighting the county is Rachel Hill, 79, the first female to work 
as a sergeant in the county marshal's office. Hill said she was considering 
retirement in 1963. But that same year the Legislature enacted a law requiring 
public agencies to offer retirees insurance benefits comparable to the coverage 
offered employees still on the job. 
</P>
<P>
As Hill understood the law, she would be eligible for full medical coverage if 
she hung on for another three years to complete her 20 years of service. She 
did, and the county extended her full coverage in 1966, the first year of her 
retirement and the first year the county offered the benefits to retirees under 
the new state law. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the cost of full coverage for Hill and her husband was $44 a 
month. But health insurance costs began soaring in the mid-1970s and, while the 
county increased its contributions for active employees, it required retirees 
to pay the difference themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Hill now pays the bulk of her $215 monthly insurance payment for herself and 
her husband, who is in a nursing home, out of her retirement income. 
</P>
<P>
But Hill said she considers herself fortunate. Employees who retired after 1979 
must pay the entire cost of their insurance coverage, ranging as high as $300 
monthly. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys in the case said Tuesday that the appeal could take another year or 
two to resolve and that additional appeals to the state Supreme Court could 
drag the case out even longer. 
</P>
<P>
Richard S. Rockwell, an attorney for the employees association, disputed the 
county's contention that it has no money to meet retirees insurance needs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they could reorganize their priorities a little bit and get this thing 
covered handily," Rockwell said. "The total county budget is $4.5 billion. One 
billion of that is discretionary." ROSE ELLEN O'CONNOR

INVOCATION FLAP APPEARS RESOLVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHANNON SANDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council this week laid to rest a monthlong controversy over prayer 
before its meetings by unanimously passing a resolution that appears to satisfy 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution emphasizes the city's support of freedom of speech and says that 
the city's use of invocations is not intended to endorse any particular 
religious belief. 
</P>
<P>
Although city officials say there have never been problems with invocations in 
the past, a letter from the mayor asking local clergy to refrain from using 
language that might endorse a particular religious belief during invocations 
sparked a protest last month. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. James Rourke, whose memo prompted the mayor's original letter, said 
later, "Speaking about Jesus Christ is obviously identifying a particular 
religion." But Mayor Richard B. Edgar later wrote another letter backing off 
from that stance. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution was drafted by an attorney for the Christian Coalition, the 
group that led the protest. 
</P>
<P>
When asked whether saying "Jesus Christ" during an invocation would violate the 
new resolution, City Atty. Rourke declined to comment. "What do you think?" he 
asked. "I'm not going to add anything more to it. It really was a non-issue." 
</P>
<P>
But Rourke did say that the city would probably not take any action against 
anyone who violated the policy. 
</P>
<P>
The two invocations given since the flap began have not identified specific 
deities, and the resolution seems to change little. But Christian Coalition 
spokesman Frank Kazerski said it was a victory for the group. 
</P>
<P>
"It changes things 180 degrees," he said. "The original letter that the mayor 
put out was instructing clergy that they were not supposed to endorse any 
particular religion. This says the city of Tustin is not endorsing any 
particular religion." 
</P>
<P>
At Monday night's meeting, Edgar said he was glad to accept the resolution. 
"Truly, we don't have a conflict," he said. "But we do need to be careful." 
</P>
<P>
In urging the council to adopt the resolution, Tustin attorney Nova D. Pack 
said: "We do feel that invoking God in passing legislation is important, for it 
is the wisdom of God that will prevail rather than the wisdom of the world."

LA PLACITA: RISING AMID THE BARRIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The smell of homemade tortillas and menudo suddenly fills the air south of 
Chapman Avenue, where wrought iron and old brick replace peach and mint 
mini-malls, and signs appear in both Spanish and English. For the merchants who 
dreamed that it would be this way, Placita Santa Fe, a newly renovated downtown 
district, has become a reality. 
</P>
<P>
Raul Davis, owner of the Tlaquepaque restaurant and Placentia Bakery, is one 
such dreamer. Like his father before him, Davis is working for a Placita Santa 
Fe -- a place for entire families to live, work and shop. 
</P>
<P>
His father "opened this restaurant and bakery 75 years ago to supply the local 
people who had no services, but he dreamed of this area as another Olvera 
Street," Davis said. "The idea was always here, but the money wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
In those days, "the orange groves were still here, the citrus packinghouses 
were in full bloom, employing three to four thousand Mexicans, and Santa Fe was 
the main street, the main strip." 
</P>
<P>
But as Placentia grew to the north, Santa Fe Street south of Chapman Avenue, 
once the center of town, became a barrio with gangs and crime. In 1989 alone, 
87 people were arrested in the area for violations related to drunkenness, 
Police Chief H.A. Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
As the downtown deteriorated, so did its image. Although merchants wanted 
redevelopment, residents feared their homes would be taken if the city got 
involved, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
"We always had the idea, but I never knew how to do it constructively," he 
said. However, Davis, who has been running the restaurant since he was 19, 
began knocking on the doors of his neighbors and fellow merchants to get them 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
Forming a group that they called the Placita Santa Fe Merchants Assn., Davis 
and a fistful of business owners began working to get city redevelopment money 
for renovation and restoration of the city's oldest buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Barely a year later, they are closer than ever to their dream of a tourist 
attraction and shopping area similar to the Fiesta Marketplace on 4th Street in 
Santa Ana, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, there's a real feeling of camaraderie, and we have the support of the 
City Council," said Davis' wife, Rosalina. "Everyone can see the positive 
things we've done." 
</P>
<P>
"The image will change," Davis said. "It's going to keep changing." 
</P>
<P>
More than $300,000 has been spent in redevelopment of the La Placita area, 
Mayor Norman Z. Eckenrode said, and there are plans to spend more. 
</P>
<P>
Last October, the area was rededicated during the city's annual Heritage Days 
Festival. This June, it will host Placentia's first Festival of Cultures. 
</P>
<P>
Although Placita Santa Fe is blossoming, many of the building owners are not 
Mexican-Americans and don't share the dream of mixing business with heritage, 
according to Jose Zepeda, owner of the Kraemer Building and an active member of 
the merchants association. 
</P>
<P>
"Every owner has to take pride in redoing his building," Zepeda said. 
"Redevelopment has scared away merchants because it's so expensive to bring 
these old buildings up to code." 
</P>
<P>
Zepeda is restoring his 60-year-old building, one of Placentia's first hotels. 
He planned to open a meat market, laundry and apartments, but he now wonders if 
office space might not benefit the community by bringing professionals into the 
downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
"A doctor or dentist would be fantastic for the people," Zepeda said. "They 
don't want to go to a cold hospital or doctor's office; they want the community 
feeling of bringing the whole family, which they can't get unless they go to 
Santa Ana." 
</P>
<P>
The city is also trying to eliminate a number of bars by making it increasingly 
difficult to obtain a liquor license, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
"We know the downtown image is not the best, but we're trying to change that," 
Rosalina Davis said. "We are a gem down here that's really untapped. . . . The 
beauty of the business is that we get people from all walks of life -- 
businessmen, students and families, Hispanics and Anglos. 
</P>
<P>
"When you can attract people from all walks of life, you must be doing 
something right," she added.

<P>
COUNCIL REAFFIRMS BEACHES TEST CLEAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has reaffirmed its belief that the city's shores are 
completely clean of oil. 
</P>
<P>
"Our beaches are cleaner than before" the Feb. 7 oil spill, said Mayor Thomas 
J. Mays during Monday night's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Mays was responding to a resident's allegation that officials had opened the 
beaches prematurely. Mays and other council members said no part of the city's 
eight miles of beaches was opened until an environmental testing company had 
spot-checked the sands. The inspections were then reviewed by state and federal 
agencies, as well as county health officials and city staff, according to Fire 
Chief Raymond C. Picard. 
</P>
<P>
Picard, who was in charge of the city staff's response to the oil spill, said: 
"Testing was conducted at 500-foot intervals along the beach, and there would 
always be three samples for each test. One sample would be at the waterline, 
one at the berm and one in the water itself." 
</P>
<P>
He said that water samples were checked for hydrocarbon parts per million and 
that no part of the beach was opened until hydrocarbon levels were deemed about 
normal. 
</P>
<P>
Mays noted that hydrocarbon levels fluctuate in the ocean, even without a 
man-made spill. Some oil seepage occurs naturally on the ocean floor, and some 
becomes "tar balls," Mays said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, about 15 tar balls have been found on city beaches, Picard 
said. He added that they were chemically analyzed and that just two of the 15 
tar balls were found to be from oil of the same kind that was leaked by the 
ruptured tanker, American Trader, on Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Picard said another natural-occurring ocean factor in recent days that some 
residents mistakenly believed was related to the spill was a "red tide" that 
hit parts of Huntington Beach and Newport Beach. That is the name given a mass 
of small sea life called plankton, which forms together and washes ashore. BILL

CITY MAY EXPAND EMINENT DOMAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council will hold a public hearing next month to discuss expanding 
eminent domain in a redevelopment project area on Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Six parcels are subject to eminent domain in the area known as the 
Entertainment Corridor, which extends along a one-mile stretch of Beach 
Boulevard from Orangethorpe Avenue to Crescent Avenue and includes Knott's 
Berry Farm. 
</P>
<P>
If the City Council agrees, eminent domain will be expanded to include 26 more 
parcels. A hodgepodge of businesses are in the proposed expanded area, 
including the Movieland Wax Museum and a Po Folks Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city has no plans for those 26 parcels now, it expects to have 
plans in the future, said May Hui, acting director of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
Under eminent domain, public agencies may buy private property at fair market 
value without consent of the owners. Fair market value, if disputed, is settled 
by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing will give the property owners a chance to voice their opinion on 
the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Beach Boulevard, which plays host to more than 5 million visitors each year, is 
the heart of the city's tourist trade. During the last two years, the 
Redevelopment Agency has aggressively pursued varied projects in the 
Entertainment Corridor to complement such existing tourist attractions as 
Knott's. Several new restaurants have opened, and existing businesses have 
remodeled to meet redevelopment requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing is scheduled for 5:30 p.m. April 16 at the City Council chambers. 
The proposal will then go before the council for final approval. LYNDA NATALI

OIL COMPANIES MUST FOLLOW STRICTER CODE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Moving to de-emphasize the city's image as an oil town, the Huntington Beach 
City Council this week adopted a new oil and gas production code with new 
environmental and aesthetic requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The code changes, approved unanimously, are intended to improve oil companies' 
accident response and prevention procedures, improve the appearance of oil 
fields and wells, and speed the removal of aging wells. 
</P>
<P>
The move represents the latest effort to make Huntington Beach "more of a 
residential community and less of an oil town," Mayor Pro Tem Peter M. Green 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new code, oil companies will be required to eliminate old wells 
producing less than 90 barrels every three months, rather than the current 
minimum standard of 20 barrels.

"If the wells are going to be out there, we want them producing," said Mark 
Bodenbender, the city's oil field specialist. "We don't want a situation where 
there is just a well on the land and they're letting it go." 
</P>
<P>
The changes, devised by a committee of city staff and oil-industry officials, 
also include a ban on future use of internal-combustion motor engines to power 
oil pumps near developed areas. They are to be replaced by electric pumps, 
which are quieter and non-polluting. 
</P>
<P>
Other code changes include requiring more landscaping and fencing around oil 
wells and additional steps to improve appearances and prevent pollution. JOHN

FIGURE IN JUDGE CASE SOUGHT IN MOLESTATION CONVICTION

Authorities are searching for Richard J. McLane, a convicted child molester who 
failed to turn himself in to begin a prison term. McLane's 1987 case drew 
attention when he became a key figure in a corruption investigation of two 
Municipal Court judges. 
</P>
<P>
McLane, 58, was supposed to report to Superior Court in January to begin 
serving a five-year sentence for his 1987 conviction on two counts of child 
molestation, four counts of furnishing cocaine to minors and another drug 
count. 
</P>
<P>
McLane had been free on $10,000 bail, pending an appeal of his conviction, 
which was denied in November by the 4th District State Court of Appeal. His 
attorney, Alex J. Forgette, told the court that he has no idea where McLane is 
and that he last talked to his client after the appellate court refused to 
overturn the conviction. McLane was living in Arizona at that time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope I am able to reach him," Forgette said. "I think he's making a big 
mistake. He's only complicating things for himself." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Kenneth O. Chinn expressed confidence that McLane will be 
found: "If he's stopped for a traffic problem anywhere, and the police run a 
computer check, they'll see he is wanted on a nationwide warrant." 
</P>
<P>
Several prostitutes told Newport Beach and Fullerton police that McLane had 
promised that he could arrange lenient treatment in Harbor Municipal Court in 
Newport Beach if they would perform sexual favors for Municipal Judge Calvin P. 
Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
Another Harbor Court judge, Brian R. Carter, allegedly called a prostitute and 
said he was collecting a sexual favor owed to Schmidt, the prostitute told 
police. 
</P>
<P>
Carter said he is innocent, but he resigned from the bench -- in part, he said, 
to avoid a review from the state Commission on Judicial Performance. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt was reprimanded by the commission for using his authority to help the 
daughter of a close friend. But Schmidt was cleared of the allegations by the 
prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County district attorney's office conducted an intermittent, 
four-year inquiry into allegations against both judges. The probe concluded in 
1988 with no charges being filed.

ANAHEIM TO DROP SUIT AGAINST COUNTY OVER CANYON JAIL SITE

<P>
The City Council Tuesday night decided to drop a lawsuit against the county and 
the Board of Supervisors that contested the proposed $1-billion Gypsum Canyon 
jail in the east Anaheim area. 
</P>
<P>
The council's action followed a recent Sacramento Superior Court ruling that 
determined the county's proposed method of financing the jail -- through the 
use of sales tax funds -- was unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
"The city of Anaheim has no interest in spending hundreds of thousands of 
taxpayers' dollars to fight a jail that will in all probability never be 
built," Mayor Fred Hunter said. "That money will be more wisely spent serving 
the needs of the citizens of Anaheim." 
</P>
<P>
A state bill was passed in October, 1989, that allowed the Orange County Board 
of Supervisors to place a half-cent sales tax increase for jails and other 
criminal justice facilities on this year's ballot. The measure would have 
required only a simple majority to be approved. 
</P>
<P>
But a Sacramento Superior Court judge ruled that the legislation violates 
Proposition 13, which requires a two-thirds majority for approval of new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman William D. Ehrle said the council decided to abandon the lawsuit 
against the county because the Gypsum Canyon jail facility plan is "not going 
to go anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a moot case," Ehrle added. 
</P>
<P>
The property for the proposed jail is owned by the Irvine Co.

SANTA ANA PANEL SAYS ARM PARK RANGERS; 
</P>

CITY GOVERNMENT: A CITIZENS ADVISORY BOARD SAYS GANG VIOLENCE CAN'T BE MET WITH 
JUST BILLY CLUBS. SIMILAR RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE BEEN REJECTED IN THE PAST, 
THOUGH.

The city's park rangers, who now carry batons, mace and two-way radios, should 
also be armed with guns, a citizens committee told the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Gang violence in city parks is increasing, and the rangers need guns to protect 
themselves, said Sean Mill, chairman of the city's Recreation and Community 
Advisory Board. Gang members go to parks such as Madison on South Standard 
Avenue and El Salvador on Civic Center Drive in the evenings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"All (rangers) have against these gang members are their billy clubs and their 
two fists," Mill told the City Council Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman John Acosta said he supports the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"They face danger every evening," Acosta said. "If these young gang members see 
the rangers without any weapons, they won't give them respect." 
</P>
<P>
Acosta asked City Manager David N. Ream and the City Council to explore the 
proposal. But Ream said city officials have already studied the idea several 
times and have decided against it. 
</P>
<P>
"If they were assigned firearms, we feel it would be necessary to place them 
under the administration of the Police Department to get the proper training 
and supervision," Ream said. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the park rangers are under the supervision of the city's Recreation 
and Community Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana has five permanent park rangers and eight part-timers who patrol the 
city's 38 parks, said Allen Doby, executive director of the agency. Each 
carries a baton, a can of mace, handcuffs and a two-way radio. They are 
required to undergo 360 hours of reserve officer classes, which include 
training in firearms. 
</P>
<P>
Doby would not say whether he favors the committee's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Some city officials expressed disapproval of arming park rangers because they 
have not had enough experience with weapons to carry them. 
</P>
<P>
One city official, who asked not to be identified, recalled that in 1988 a park 
ranger beat a homeless man at Santiago Park with a baton. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you imagine if the ranger had a gun instead? We would have a dead man on 
our hands," the city official said. 
</P>
<P>
But the rangers are vulnerable to weapons that gang members carry, said James 
Wild, a member of the advisory board. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ludicrous having them endangering their lives without protection," he 
said. "A billy club sure doesn't give them much protection against a gun." 
</P>
<P>
The park ranger program was begun in Santa Ana nine years ago to combat 
vandalism in the parks, Doby said. Since then, vandalism has decreased from 
9,000 incidents a month to about 1,000 a month, he said. Besides patrolling, 
the rangers are also in charge of locking restrooms and closing parks at night. 
</P>
<P>
No city in Orange County allows its park rangers to carry firearms.

MIKE PENNER: IT'S A LOCK: HOOPS TAKE OVER SPRING

Reading between the datelines . . . 
</P>
<P>
NEW YORK -- Four months after the Berlin Wall, baseball's locked gates come 
down. 
</P>
<P>
Just in the nick of time? 
</P>
<P>
Or does anyone even care anymore? 
</P>
<P>
Last time we checked, everybody was watching Bo Kimble and Ball State. 
</P>
<P>
Great timing, this lockout. While the owners and the players haggled 32 days 
over the arbitration rights of 14 players, the rest of the country got hooked 
on hoops. 
</P>
<P>
Let's see what's on the tube tonight: Donald Fehr with sweat stains under his 
armpits or Loyola running up 149 points on Michigan. No baseball in Mesa? How 
about that Arizona-Alabama game? 
</P>
<P>
Baseball may be back, but it's going to have to play catch-up. There's a new 
national pastime in town and this one doesn't spit tobacco juice. 
</P>
<P>
FULLERTON -- Augie Garrido returns to Cal State Fullerton, bringing his 
nationally ranked University of Illinois team with him for a Thursday game at 
Titan Field. 
</P>
<P>
After much mulling, Fullerton officials have decided not to mark the occasion 
by retiring Garrido's jersey. But then, what did Augie ever do for Fullerton? 
</P>
<P>
Two College World Series championships. Tim Wallach, Greg Mathews, Mike 
Schooler, Mike Harkey and nine other Titans in the major leagues. A baseball 
stadium and a baseball program, both built from the ground up, both built on a 
shoestring. 
</P>
<P>
But these are sensitive times for Fullerton baseball and, somehow, an honor for 
Garrido is viewed as a slam at the current Titan program. How, I'm not quite 
sure. If the majors conducted their business the same way, the Atlanta Braves 
never would have retired Hank Aaron's number. And Bob Feller would still be 
waiting in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Carroll, the opportunity is yours. Do the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
OAKLAND -- Mater Dei and Servite high schools win the State Division I and III 
basketball championships. 
</P>
<P>
So what happened to Bishop Montgomery? 
</P>
<P>
During the regular season, the Knights tied Servite for second place in the 
Angelus League, four games behind Mater Dei. That Angelus must be a heck of a 
league -- one league, two state titles -- but, hey, Bishop Montgomery has to 
get with the program. 
</P>
<P>
INDIANAPOLIS -- Eric Dickerson, 29, says he's planning to quit pro football 
because running behind the Indianapolis Colts' offensive line is "like taking a 
revolver and putting a bullet in it and spinning it around and sticking it to 
my head and sooner or later, a bullet is gonna come out and kill me." 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson used to have the best line in football in Anaheim, but he wanted more 
money. Now, he has the money but wants the line. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, more thought should have gone into "Let him run 47-Gap." If you have 
your health, Dick, you have everything. 
</P>
<P>
OAKLAND -- After the Brea-Olinda High School girls' team lost the State 
Division III basketball championship, a Brea-Olinda parent says there will be 
no postseason celebration because "we don't celebrate second place." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, and hopefully, this was said in the heat of the moment. No doubt, 
the defeat had to be disappointing, but if a 55-game winning streak, a return 
trip to the state title game and a final record of 33-1 isn't worth 
celebrating, some priorities ought to be rethought. 
</P>
<P>
With a little reflection, the Lady Cats should be proud of the reflection in 
the mirror. 
</P>
<P>
NEW YORK -- Because of an abbreviated spring training, baseball will play the 
first two weeks of the regular season under different rules, allowing starting 
pitchers to receive credit for a victory after completing three innings. 
</P>
<P>
And Commissioner Fay Vincent wants a regular season with no asterisks attached? 
</P>
<P>
We can see it now: 
</P>
<P>
 Bret Saberhagen becomes the first pitcher since Denny McLain to win 30 games 
in a single season.* 
</P>
<P>
 (* Saberhagen pitched a total of nine innings for his first three victories.) 
</P>
<P>
 KNOXVILLE, Tenn. -- UC Santa Barbara shoots 33% from the field and commits 14 
turnovers in a 62-58 loss to Michigan State in the second round of the NCAA 
Southeast Regional. 
</P>
<P>
Could Cal State Long Beach have done better? 
</P>
<P>
Some thoughts: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Long Beach beat Purdue, which placed second to Michigan State in the Big 
Ten. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Long Beach beat Texas, which beat Purdue in the second round of the Midwest 
Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Long Beach has more sources of point production than Santa Barbara. When 
Michigan State clamped down on center Eric McArthur, the Gaucho offense was 
down to Carrick DeHart and nothing but. Long Beach's better balance, and better 
athletes, might have been better equipped to handle the Spartans' aggressive, 
oppressive defense. 
</P>
<P>
And that might have landed two Big West teams in the round of 16. 
</P>
<P>
Which would be two more than the Big Eight.

BOYS' BASKETBALL COACH AT BREA-OLINDA QUITS

<TEXT>
<P>
Rick Jones has resigned as boys' basketball coach at Brea-Olinda High School. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot teach world history effectively, be in the classroom and direct a 
total (basketball) program," Jones said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too much for one person." 
</P>
<P>
Jones, a four-year coach, said his letter of resignation will be submitted to 
the Brea-Olinda school board tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, who has taught world history at Brea-Olinda for 16 years, was a junior 
varsity coach and varsity assistant at Brea-Olinda for nine seasons. He 
replaced Gene Lloyd as basketball coach after the 1984-85 season. 
</P>
<P>
Jones was 79-31 during his four seasons. The Wildcats won three Orange League 
championships and finished second once. They also reached the quarterfinals of 
the Southern Section playoffs twice. CHRIS FOSTER

Jesse Rosas was the winning pitcher in Santa Ana High School's 4-2 Century 
League baseball victory over Foothill Tuesday at Foothill. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
Rosas (3-2) threw more than 100 pitches and walked six but finished with a 
three-hitter. He needed only 68 pitches Friday at Canyon, but lost, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
"Jesse was all over the place today," Santa Ana Coach Bill Ross said. "But I 
guess he threw it in the right places at the right times." 
</P>
<P>
Foothill also hit the ball at the right people at the right times for Santa 
Ana. That often meant within diving range of Octavio Medina, Santa Ana's 
slick-fielding shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
With two outs in the first, Medina sprawled to his right to knock down a 
chopper by Shawn Sousa, and threw in time to retire Sousa. 
</P>
<P>
In the second, Medina turned an acrobatic double play to help Rosas out of 
trouble again. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana got just enough timely hitting. Trailing, 2-1, in the third, Santa 
Ana tied the score when Rosas drove in Bill Johnson with a single to center. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth, Medina and Jeff Fuentes walked with two outs, and both scored on 
John Morales' line single up the middle. That gave Santa Ana the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams are 4-4 overall, 1-1 in league. STUART MATTHEWS

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: SPEAKMAN'S CHANGES SEEM TO BE A BIG HIT SO FAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Willy Speakman figured this baseball season at Fullerton College would be like 
on-the-job training. 
</P>
<P>
He spent all his baseball life as a right-handed hitting shortstop, but this 
spring he decided there were too many players like him vying for spots on 
four-year college and professional teams. 
</P>
<P>
So Speakman went for the complete makeover and emerged as switch-hitting 
catcher. 
</P>
<P>
He thought he could pick up hitting from the left side pretty quickly, but 
never dreamed he'd do as well as he has. 
</P>
<P>
Speakman is hitting with a .479 average (34 for 71). He also is leading in 
doubles (12) and has 22 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a goal this year not to hit a home run," said Speakman, 19. "I just 
want to hit line drives. It's been pretty amazing what has happened so far." 
</P>
<P>
Speakman's average becomes more impressive, when you figure in an 0-12 slump 
that lasted three games. But he came out of that slide with a vengeance, going 
15 for 21 with seven doubles in the next five games. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little apprehensive about him going up left-handed at first," 
Fullerton Coach Nick Fuscardo said. "I didn't want him to go right into a slump 
and not be able to get out of it. But, needless to say, that hasn't happened." 
</P>
<P>
Speakman has proven to be equally talented as a catcher. 
</P>
<P>
"He's always talking with or asking questions about pitchers," Fuscardo said. 
"He's done a really nice job back there as well. We let him call his own game 
and he's pretty good at it." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, having two of the best pitchers in the conference -- Steve Trachsel 
(6-1) and Tom Kelly (5-1) -- to work with hasn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to be in every single pitch of the game," Speakman said. "That's what I 
like most about catching. Now I don't lose my concentration." 
</P>
<P>
Speakman came to Fullerton in the summer of 1988 after graduating from South 
Hills High School in Covina, where he played shortstop. He said he first 
thought of catching that summer in the Metropolitan League, but didn't because 
Fullerton had a catcher but needed infielders. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Speakman started the season at shortstop, but switched to third 
base about midway through the season. He ended up hitting .313 with three 
doubles, two home runs and 14 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after the season, he had a talk with Fuscardo. 
</P>
<P>
"He came to me and said he wanted to try to catch," Fuscardo said. "Not too 
many people make the switch from shortstop to catcher but I said that he could 
try it. He worked really hard and that's why he's done so well. It's no fluke." 
</P>
<P>
Speakman struggled over the summer and during the fall. 
</P>
<P>
But in January, things started to click for him and he earned the starting 
catching job. 
</P>
<P>
"I really can't explain why things started to go so well but they did," 
Speakman said. "I want to have the opportunity to have a college scholarship in 
one hand and pro baseball (contract offer) in the other hand. That's my goal 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Basketball honors: Rancho Santiago's Matt Lien, Fullerton's Rashone Lewis and 
Cypress' Vince Hizon were first-team all-state selections in men's basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Kreps of Golden West was an honorable mention selection. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Small, a former standout at Bolsa Grande High School, also made the first 
team for College of the Sequoias. Small, a guard, led the state in scoring this 
season with a 25.4 a game average. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Thomasson of Skyline and Otis Mixon of Mt. San Jacinto were named 
co-state players of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Harris, a longtime local baseball fan and the announcer for Cypress games 
the past six years, died Monday of heart failure. He was 79. Harris had been in 
Fountain Valley Hospital for three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I first met him in 1974," Cypress Coach Scott Pickler said. "He was just a 
great fan and loved the kids. He adopted baseball and made it his life." 
</P>
<P>
Community College Notes 
</P>
<P>
Donna Gondringer, a 6-foot-1 forward from Golden West, has made an oral 
commitment to attend Hawaii. Gondringer, who was the most valuable player in 
the Orange Empire Conference,, helped lead Golden West to the state title this 
month. Shawna Armstrong, also a starting forward at Golden West, has made an 
oral commitment to attend Cal State San Bernardino. . . The Orange Coast men's 
volleyball team plays at L.A. Pierce at 7 tonight in a match for first place. 
The teams are tied for the South Coast Conference title at 10-1. . . . Bob Van

IRVINE CITY S&amp;L DECIDES TO SWITCH AND STOP FIGHTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Irvine City Savings &amp; Loan has changed its name to Irvine City Bank and 
switched to being a federally chartered institution from a state-chartered one. 
</P>
<P>
While the move will allow the S&amp;L to offer certain banking services it 
couldn't offer as a thrift, it also is an attempt to solve an old problem that 
has plagued it since it opened in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Located in a city that has seen its share of thrift disasters, Irvine City 
S&amp;L found that its name, or at least a close approximation of it, 
frequently ended up in newspaper and broadcast headlines. 
</P>
<P>
When Consolidated Savings Bank fell to regulators in 1986, for instance, 
headlines typically blared something to the effect that "Irvine S&amp;L Fails." 
And Irvine City's depositors quickly called to find out what was going on. 
</P>
<P>
James P. Giraldin, the S&amp;L's president, and Douglas Weeks, his predecessor, 
were quick to call the media and point out the problem. Every now and then, 
however, a similar headline called unwanted attention to Irvine City S&amp;L. 
The most upsetting for Giraldin occurred last year with the collapse of Lincoln 
Savings &amp; Loan, an "Irvine S&amp;L" that could become the nation's most 
costly thrift bailout with an estimated cost to taxpayers of $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"The very name itself, 'savings and loan,' has become a liability, making it 
difficult for all savings and loans to successfully compete with other 
financial institutions," Giraldin said. 
</P>
<P>
The name and the charter changes come as Irvine City Bank opens its third 
office in Irvine. The new branch at Heritage Plaza, like the others, will 
continue to provide home mortgages, which make up 95% of its portfolio, 
Giraldin said.

New address: Frank B. Hall &amp; Co. Inc., one of the nation's largest 
insurance brokerage firms, has moved its West Coast regional office to Costa 
Mesa from downtown Los Angeles "because Orange County is fast becoming an 
important international center for business and commerce within the Pacific 
Rim," said Ron Jackson, chief executive for the Costa Mesa office. The new 
regional office is in the Imperial Bank building near South Coast Plaza.

ROMANIAN MARVELS AT HIGH-TECH TRADE SHOW; 
</P>
<P>
COMPUTERS: A SCIENTIST FROM THAT CONFLICT-RIDDEN COUNTRY "OOHS" AND "AHHS" OVER 
THE EQUIPMENT ON DISPLAY AT AN ANNUAL CONFERENCE IN ANAHEIM. 
</P>

ANAHEIM 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Following the December revolution in his country, Romanian computer scientist 
Mihai Bocarnea was happy just to have the freedom to write a letter to the 
National Computer Graphics Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The "old regime of fear, darkness, and stupidity," he wrote, had left Romanian 
electronics in a sorry state, and he hoped that the American group might send 
him some technical papers from its annual conference in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
To his astonishment, the NCGA executive committee responded by offering to pay 
his way to the show and helped arrange a visa through the American embassy in 
Bucharest. 
</P>
<P>
The bearded, soft-spoken Bocarnea has been walking the show floor this week 
like any other visitor, except that he's probably the only one who feels as if 
he's in a wonderland. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a miracle, of course, that I am here," said Bocarnea, 30, who works at 
the Romanian Electronics Research Institute in Bucharest. His only previous 
trip abroad had been to East Germany. He said he had never conceived of 
actually attending a U.S. computer show, which began Monday and ends Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"To put your hands on these high-class, brand-new machines is like touching the 
untouchable," Bocarnea said. "It's astonishing. Everything we knew from the 
books is really true." 
</P>
<P>
In Romania, Bocarnea explained, computer technology is 10 years behind the 
times -- a virtual millenium in the fast-paced electronics industry. The 
country doesn't import any equipment, and the computers it makes are mostly 
based on imitations of the old Z-80 microprocessor that's used in antiquated 
machines, such as the Commodore 64. 
</P>
<P>
The political situation in Romania remains in flux after the popular uprising 
that led to the overthrow and execution of longtime dictator Nicolae Ceausescu 
in December. But Bocarnea is hopeful that he and his colleagues may begin to 
close the technical gap. He said he is not a political person and has never 
been a Communist party member and added that institute was relatively immune 
from the current political turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
To Bocarnea's amazement, Romanian authorities were enthusiastic about his trip 
and issued him a passport immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to know what's going on in the outside world, and they were very glad 
about this opportunity," he said, observing with an impish grin that 
"opportunity" was a word he had heard a lot since coming to the United States. 
But he has no illusions about the difficulties ahead: "We have to start from 
the beginning -- there's inertia, and there's the problem with money." 
</P>
<P>
Bocarnea said it's not yet clear whether scarce hard currency will be available 
to import computer equipment and make the desperately needed transition to 
IBM-compatible computers. He emphasized that he's not a businessman and isn't 
here to negotiate deals, but said he hoped to help arrange a program allowing 
Romanian engineers to study in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Parra, the NCGA executive vice president who invited Bocarnea to the 
show, also said there was no special business agenda for his visit. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a chance for us to get a better sense of what they've been going 
through," Parra said. "There's a satisfaction just in seeing the guy walk the 
floor." 
</P>
<P>
The invitation came as a result of Bocarnea's moving letter and was "more of an 
emotional decision than a strategic one," Parra said. But he also noted that 
the association was trying to establish a presence in Europe and hoped 
eventually to have contacts in Eastern Europe as well. 
</P>
<P>
For Bocarnea, of course, seeing the fancy graphics workstations and other 
products on display at the show was just one of the highlights of his trip. 
</P>
<P>
"When I arrived, I felt like I was in a film," he said, explaining that most 
Romanians' impressions of American life come from movies. The Hilton Hotel, 
where he is staying, was "another miracle -- excellent, super, first-class," he 
said. And he was struck by what he considered the general friendliness of 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Bocarnea said he was grateful to the NCGA and the people who arranged his trip. 
He has only one lament -- that his 5-year-old daughter wasn't with him when he 
spent the weekend at Disneyland.

KEEPING SCORE BEHIND SCENES; 
</P>
<P>
FILM: COMPOSERS WALK A FINE LINE IN DECIDING WHEN THE MUSIC SHOULD ENHANCE OR 
STAND OUT ON ITS OWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

"There's an old truism (that says) a good score is something you don't really 
notice," said film music composer Hans Zimmer, "There's nothing worse than 
going to see a film and suddenly the score belts you over the head and rips you 
out of whatever the emotion of the film is, and you can't watch it anymore 
because you're listening to the music." 
</P>
<P>
Zimmer's fellow composer Michael Kamen agreed:"By definition, scores are 
supposed to blend in with the scenery." 
</P>
<P>
In that way, composing for films fits in with the other "invisible" branches on 
the Oscar tree -- those quiet, fellow-suffering categories of editing, 
cinematography, special effects and art direction, all disciplines of which a 
captivated audience is expected to remain blissfully unaware. 
</P>
<P>
One big difference, though: You can't buy a copy of the editing and take it 
home. 
</P>
<P>
You can quite often purchase a sound-track album of a musical score, though. 
And audiences and Oscar voters alike may make judgments of a score's quality 
based more on how it stands alone than on how it actually works to contextually 
enhance the movie, a far more subtle achievement. 
</P>
<P>
"What music is supposed to do in a film is fairly mysterious for most people," 
said veteran Elmer Bernstein. "And it's really no less mysterious to a lot of 
people in the academy. The general membership of the academy tends to go for 
something they just recognize and like; sometimes they like it because it has a 
nice tune or something. What they're supposed to be looking for is that score 
which most brilliantly served the purposes of the movie it was in." 
</P>
<P>
Among voting composers surveyed, John Williams' work on "Fourth of July" seems 
most strongly felt to have served that purpose among this year's score 
nominees, followed closely by James Horner's music for "Field of Dreams." 
</P>
<P>
Noted Danny Elfman, taking a cynical view of the voting: "Scores that are 
strong on the sentimental side are heavy, heavy favorites. Things that tend to 
be lighter or more frolicky but still very imaginative quite often are 
overlooked. Weightiness goes a long way, and an association with a very 
important movie goes a long way." 
</P>
<P>
Hence, Elfman's prediction of a win for "Fourth of July," which -- as a "very 
effective, very simple, very memorable" score -- is also, coincidentally, his 
own personal pick as the best of the nominees. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein, meanwhile, saves his greatest enthusiasm for Horner's non-orchestral 
"Field of Dreams" nomination: "A lot of us who don't use electronic music and 
are more conservative in that way have been either not wanting to admit it 
exists or sort of turning a blind eye to its possibilities. But when you hear 
the score to a thing like 'Field,' you have to say wow -- there's an 
extraordinary use of electronic instruments in what I thought was an amazing, 
very different sort of score." 
</P>
<P>
There are extenuating circumstances to explain the lesser enthusiasm for the 
other three nominees: Only that music in "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" 
which was not reprised from the two previous Indie films is eligible, according 
to academy rules. Also, much of what people fondly remember most about "The 
Little Mermaid" or "The Fabulous Baker Boys" are actually songs, which are 
technically not a part of the score. 
</P>
<P>
"I guarantee you that nine out of 10 people you ask who vote on the music will 
talk about these wonderful songs," says Elfman. "Technically, they're supposed 
to distinguish between score and songs, but most people really don't. I loved 
the songs in 'Little Mermaid,' but I couldn't even remember the score when I 
left the movie, and I'm usually pretty receptive to that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
For many of the voting composers, it isn't catchiness that counts on their 
ballots. 
</P>
<P>
"What I look for in a score is simply something that helps me enjoy the picture 
more than I would've without it," noted Bernstein, who won an Oscar for 
"Thoroughly Modern Millie." Bernstein's chief criterion is that a score make 
its film "more emotionally accessible." 
</P>
<P>
Said Kamen ("Lethal Weapon," "Brazil"), "If there's some bits of tune that 
stick in people's minds, that's great. Everybody walked out humming 'Gone with 
the Wind.' I try to do that as a composer too. I like it when melodies are 
recognizable, but that isn't always the job. Sometimes the job is to make 
something scary or tense or uncomfortable, or to set a mood for a whole picture 
so you walk out profoundly influenced by the score but not necessarily humming 
it." 
</P>
<P>
And so, the great paradox of film-score appreciation: To enjoy or not to enjoy? 
To be consciously aware of the musical component, or let it work its subliminal 
wiles and get lost in the film as a whole? What of that maxim that if it's a 
good score, you won't notice it? 
</P>
<P>
"I would have said OK to that 20 years ago," answered Bernstein. "But music is 
much, much more a part of everybody's life today, and therefore I think it has 
an effect on people's awareness of film. You're dealing with much more 
sophisticated audiences today, and it's perfectly proper that a sophisticated 
audience should notice the acting, the cinematography, the costumes, the music, 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
Elfman, a rock singer/songwriter with Oingo Boingo and the scorer of 
"Beetlejuice" and the upcoming "Dick Tracy," takes a more qualified view of how 
far a score should stand out. 
</P>
<P>
"That depends on the movie," Elfman said. "If it's a movie about characters and 
emotions, then the score should maybe play a more subliminal role. If it's a 
very visual movie, like Spielberg or Tim Burton or many people who work in the 
fantasy vein do, then I think it's much more within the tradition for the music 
to stand up on its own and make a bold statement. 
</P>
<P>
"In the movies I grew up on, the wonderful science-fictions that Bernard 
Herrmann scored, for me the music always stood out and stood up on its own, and 
I loved that. But the movies were able to withstand that. It wasn't a film 
about two guys sitting in a bar and having a dialogue about their lives. It 
completely depends on the movie how much a score should stand out or not. 
Obviously, I went to great lengths to make the score to 'Batman' make a 
statement on its own, but in a movie like 'Midnight Run,' I was trying to stay 
more out of the way." 
</P>
<P>
The most obvious way to stay out of the way is to know when not to score a 
scene at all, points out Zimmer ("Rain Man," "Driving Miss Daisy"). "The 
European tradition of scoring is quite different from the American," he said. 
"We have far less music in a European film usually. In a way that's part of the 
scoring process: Where are we not going to have music? Why do you have music 
when a guy walks down the street? If you think about it, it doesn't make sense, 
so what are you trying to say with that? Sometimes it's that you don't score 
something; you leave it empty, and it has an amazing effect as well." 
</P>
<P>
Zimmer counts himself as a fan of Williams' judicious "Fourth of July" choices: 
"This may just be that European thing, but the hospital scene wasn't scored at 
all. I thought that was quite impressive, that they didn't plaster the film 
wall to wall with music, which seems to happen all the time these days. So what 
he did write actually meant something." 
</P>
<P>
Film composers have their pet peeves and biases, like everyone else, and 
certain types of films rarely show up in their category. 
</P>
<P>
"I think comic is a recipe for disaster if you want to get yourself nominated," 
said Zimmer. "From what I can tell, the academy thinks comedy is cheap and not 
art, without realizing that if you really want to do something comic, it's much 
harder than writing another big, sentimental number. It's much harder to make 
people laugh in a non-contrived, non-manipulative way than it is to make them 
cry. We all know how to make 'em cry." 
</P>
<P>
Most folks, of course, still aren't consciously hit by film music at all. Kamen 
foresees a time not far off when sound-track albums are more actively promoted 
and "there you'll find more opportunity to have people analyze the actual 
components of a score. Because really, when the whole film's going on, it's 
wonderful to not have to pay attention to what the strings are doing." 
</P>
<P>
Zimmer, for one, doesn't mind the invisibility of his craft. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way that's the fun of it, playing and sneaking around in a movie, hiding 
behind the shots and hiding behind the sound effects -- and then occasionally 
doing something which people do notice."

The "Festival of Britain Orange County -- 1990," a countywide retail promotion 
and cultural event scheduled for Oct. 12 through 28, has hired an executive 
director and has announced 21 local arts and entertainment organizations that 
will participate. The festival is being co-sponsored by Costa Mesa's South 
Coast Plaza mall and the British consulate in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The executive director is Bruce Joseph, who coordinated "UK/LA '88 -- A 
Celebration of British Culture," a 12-week, $7.2-million gala that included 
presentations by Los Angeles and British arts organizations. Joseph also was 
artistic coordinator of a Soviet arts festival staged in San Diego last fall. 
</P>
<P>
He will coordinate the festival's arts component, which is being organized by a 
committee of local arts officials. Judith Peterson, director of Fullerton's 
Muckenthaler Cultural Center and co-chair of the committee, said works with 
British artists, themes or both are expected from: 
</P>
<P>
The Art Institute of Southern California, Ballet Pacifica, Bowers Museum, 
Fullerton Museum Center, Garden Grove Shakespeare Festival, Garden Grove 
Symphony, Children's Museum at La Habra, Laguna Art Museum, Muckenthaler 
Cultural Center, Newport Harbor Art Museum, Orange County Performing Arts 
Center, Orange County Philharmonic Society, Pacific Symphony, Poets Reading 
Inc., Saddleback College art gallery, South Coast Repertory, South Coast 
Symphony, Stop-Gap theater troupe, and the UC Irvine Chamber Music Series. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards Theatres and the Pacific Amphitheater also will participate "in some 
way, but we don't know how yet," Peterson said. Peterson said specific arts 
events will not be announced for a "couple of months," when participants have 
finalized their plans. All arts events will take place at participants' venues. 
Peterson said 150 groups had been sent applications. 
</P>
<P>
A budget of about $500,000 has been proposed to support the arts projects 
through grants to the groups, Peterson said, adding that organizers plan to 
raise the money from public and private sources in Southern California and 
Britain through a newly formed nonprofit organization. She would not name any 
specific funding sources but did say that Joseph, who was not available for 
comment, already has begun work on the effort. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson also declined to give a budget for the entire festival, which will 
include educational programs on British culture and a British retail promotion, 
described by organizers as one of the biggest ever staged in the United States, 
centered at South Coast Plaza mall. Officials have said that all eight mall 
department stores and more than 50 smaller shops have agreed to take part by 
selling British products.

DETAIL IS THE KEY TO ARCHITECTURE, STEVEN HOLL TELLS UCI FORUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
New York architect Steven Holl had not been to Newport Beach for 24 years, he 
told his listeners at the start of a lecture Monday night in UC Irvine's 
Beckman Center. His last visit was a post-high school surfing adventure during 
which the powerful waves pulling against his paddling suddenly made him feel 
his life was about to end. 
</P>
<P>
The obligatory anecdotal opener was oddly revealing. In a talk filled with 
abstruse ideas and illustrated with slides of arresting images that sometimes 
had no apparent connection with architecture, Holl's big theme was the 
importance of understanding the way spaces are experienced by the body. 
</P>
<P>
The subject (with fellow architect Emilio Ambasz) of an exhibition at the 
Museum of Modern Art in New York last year, Holl is considered one of America's 
leading young architects. Founded in 1977, his firm has won seven citations 
from Progressive Architecture magazine. He is the author of "Anchoring," a book 
about his work published by Princeton University Press. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't experience (architectural) plans," Holl said. "They experience 
the detail." 
</P>
<P>
In the design of a clothing shop in New York, Holl said he wanted to create the 
maximum sense of density on the exterior and the maximum quality of lightness 
on the interior. For the storefront, he used cast glass ("almost a kind of 
ice") and created door handles that were literally peeled out of the brass 
plates that form the door, revealing the thickness of the door. Inside, he used 
"the thinnest" countertops and reveled -- in his spare, disciplined way -- in 
the "tactility" of wire mesh. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to explain his intellectually complex yet innately poetic 
approach to architecture, the 42-year-old architect rambled freely through the 
broader world of culture and everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
One slide of a woman biting into the stone toe of a statue from a film by Luis 
Bunuel evoked Holl's notion of "the physicality of material." A captioned image 
of a Japanese man brushing his teeth "using only a finger and a little salt" 
illustrated Holl's awareness of the forms of traditional culture when he set 
about designing a Japanese apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
One of the guiding lights of Holl's particular vision is the phenomenon of 
parallax, according to which an object appears to change position depending on 
where you are when you look at it. A fanciful-sounding project of his for the 
city of Paris involves "ultra-thin towers" that create changing spatial 
relationships among themselves as the viewer walks through neighboring streets. 
</P>
<P>
Designing an addition to a public library in Berlin, Holl was intrigued by what 
he called the "browsing circuit": the paths visitors take as they seek out 
books that might interest them. The ramps and asymmetrical boxes that surround 
the original building take the circuit into account while "shearing" the space 
to create a sequence of different views. 
</P>
<P>
A retail-office-residential complex in Seaside, Fla., was a routine project; 
the problem, as Holl saw it, was "how to intensify meaning." He imagined five 
of the apartment-dwellers as "boisterous types whose balconies face the 
(public) square, who toast the sunset and have Jacuzzis." Each unit would be 
identical since the residents all drive BMWs. 
</P>
<P>
But the other three residents would be "melancholic types who face the rising 
sun." He conceived of one as a tragic poet whose apartment had skinny windows 
and a skimpy awning on the roof like a rag on a pole. Another would be a 
musician, and the third, a mathematician in whose living spaces "everything is 
slightly warped." 
</P>
<P>
Other dreamlike solutions are everywhere in Holl's work. "Hinged spaces" in a 
Japanese apartment building can open up select portions of the walls to create 
shifting patterns of light and space. ("The sun brings (these apartments) to 
life, not the architect's gesture.") Grandest of all is a visionary plan for 
Phoenix, Ariz. -- part of a project to reverse the creeping sprawl of cities -- 
to "bracket the desert" with a Maginot Line of 30-foot-wide adobe-like 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Holl's talk was part of "California and Beyond; the State of Design in the 
'90s," a series presented by the Architecture and Design Council of the Newport 
Harbor Art Museum. Next on the schedule is graphic designer April Greiman, 
speaking at UCI on March 28 at 7:30 p.m.

MARKET BEAT: WHY JAPAN MARKET CHAOS WORRIES U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the Japanese stock market continues its spectacular plunge, many folks on 
Wall Street are at once smug and relieved: smug that the Japanese market 
finally has stopped defying gravity after all these years and relieved that the 
debacle there hasn't pulled down U.S. stocks. 
</P>
<P>
But the lower Japan goes, the higher the worry level here. Many experts see a 
growing risk of spillover damage to U.S. stocks and other assets if Japan goes 
into a free fall over the next few weeks. And the danger of such a panic may be 
greater than anyone could have imagined even a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
One widespread myth is that there's some fundamental strength supporting U.S. 
stock prices as Japanese stocks crumble. While the Tokyo exchange's 225-stock 
Nikkei index has plunged nearly 21% this year, the Dow Jones industrial index 
is off just 0.5% -- and the Dow has been rising in recent weeks as the Nikkei 
has taken its worst hits. 
</P>
<P>
From those numbers, one would assume that the United States has the stronger 
outlook for economic growth and that Japan has the weaker outlook. Of course, 
just the opposite is true. So it isn't inherent economic strength or weakness 
that are driving stock prices there or here. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Japan is being ravaged by fear of the unknown: Political leadership 
seems paralyzed, and the Bank of Japan's campaign to raise interest rates -- 
largely to halt a slide in the yen's value -- seems too little, too late. A 
full-point rise in the bank's discount rate Tuesday, to 5.25%, failed to 
reverse the yen or the Japanese stock market. 
</P>
<P>
The net effect is that U.S. stocks are winning by default, not for fundamental 
reasons, many experts argue. Investors here who bet on a rising U.S. market 
"have gotten it right for the wrong reason -- the yen," said Jeff Bahrenburg, 
Japan market strategist for Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
As the yen plummets and the dollar strengthens, U.S. investments look more 
appealing to Japanese investors and other foreign investors. If a Japanese 
investor bought $1 worth of stock here when it took 140 yen to purchase a 
dollar, that same $1 worth of stock now is worth 154 yen. And if the stock has 
since risen in value, it's gravy for the Japanese investor. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street traders say they haven't seen a dramatic surge of Japanese money 
into U.S. stocks in recent weeks, but they say there's no question that some of 
the yen from stock sales in Japan are making their way to the United States. 
"The way the currency is going, it just makes sense for them to hold 
dollar-denominated investments," said Rodd Anderson, a trader at Shearson 
Lehman Hutton. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a strong rally in U.S. Treasury bonds was attributed partly to 
buying by Japanese investors who are convinced that the yen is headed still 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
Bahrenburg argues that Japanese investors' disenchantment with their own 
markets is likely to bring even more money to our shores. Japanese corporate 
investment trusts, a major source of fuel for their stock market, "are very 
underinvested in foreign securities," he said. Those rich accounts have just 8% 
of their assets in foreign stocks and bonds now, versus 15% early in 1987, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
If the yen continues to weaken, the lure of overseas investments may prove 
overwhelming for the Japanese. And one key attraction of U.S. stocks is that 
they are far cheaper than Japanese stocks relative to corporate earnings. The 
average U.S. stock is priced at about 13 times last year's per-share earnings. 
In contrast, many of Japan's biggest stocks sell for about 20 times earnings 
even after their declines this year -- and those are the Japanese stocks that 
are considered bargains. (The average price/earnings ratio for major Japanese 
stocks is 48.) 
</P>
<P>
What seems to translate into great opportunity here because of Japan's chaos, 
however, also is fraught with risk for U.S. markets. The greatest risk is that 
Japan's market simply melts down. 
</P>
<P>
The betting now is that Japanese stocks will continue to fall but in an orderly 
fashion. George Hersh, Japan market strategist for Daiwa Securities in New 
York, said the next "support" level for the Nikkei is around 28,000, or 9% 
below Tuesday's close of 30,807. 
</P>
<P>
But could the decline rapidly turn into an uncontrolled selloff? No one wants 
to think about that. Most experts take the Bank of Japan's view: that what's 
happening to Japanese stocks is a normal correction after nearly a decade of 
superheated gains. In fact, one of the bank's arguments in raising interest 
rates, besides defending the yen, is that speculation must be wrung out of 
Japanese stocks. 
</P>
<P>
As rational as that may sound, however, Hersh notes that many big investors in 
Japan are terribly distressed by the paper losses they've suffered. Those 
losses are calling into question the strong buy-and-hold philosophy that has 
always guided Japanese investors, Hersh contends. "They're asking, 'What should 
we do now?' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
If the selling spirals out of control, the United States could quickly feel it. 
A meltdown could produce massive paper losses in Japan that could force 
investors there to sell overseas assets to raise capital. And U.S. assets would 
be easiest to dump. 
</P>
<P>
Even without a meltdown, a severe enough decline in the Japanese market could 
leave many Japanese investors feeling far less wealthy. "And if they feel less 
rich, we'll experience less in direct investment here -- not just the West 
Coast but the entire country," said Kathleen Cooper, economist at Security 
Pacific Corp. in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the longer-term risk for the U.S. stock market is worth keeping in 
mind, too: Once the Japanese market stabilizes and the yen stops falling, our 
market no longer will win by default. At that point, U.S. stocks will have to 
stand on their fundamentals. And if our interest rates continue to rise, and 
corporate profits continue to slump, the fundamentals may prove very rickety.

JAMES FLANIGAN: NEW UAL DEAL MAY SET THE PATTERN FOR '90S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By James Flanigan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Questions come easily. Will United Airlines employees finally get to own the 
airline as a result of the proxy fight launched on Monday for UAL Corp., the 
airline's parent company, by the investment firm Coniston Partners? 
</P>
<P>
And if so, what does that mean for the employees? If some of United's unions 
were willing to offer wages and work rule concessions last October in support 
of a $300-a-share offer to buy UAL -- a bid that fell through for lack of 
financing -- would employees be getting a bargain today? All the company unions 
are now backing an offer that would give shareholders $150 a share in cash, 
plus perhaps $40 more in notes and non-voting stock. 
</P>
<P>
Also, what does it mean for the airline? After a takeover, would United become 
a debt-burdened company, losing out at home and abroad to better-financed 
competitors, such as American and Delta? 
</P>
<P>
Finally, what does the UAL proxy contest say for companies and takeovers in the 
1990s? 
</P>
<P>
Answers come harder and are necessarily tentative. But on United, probably yes, 
the employees one way or another will get to own some major part of the 
airline. It is their backing that gives the Coniston bid credibility -- and 
credibility is all important, says a New York arbitrage trader in takeover 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
If a bid looks as though it can succeed, company managements generally don't 
let it come to a vote, says the arbitrager. "It's like Russian Roulette, you 
lose and you're out." That's why UAL management and directors are considering 
some action -- in cooperation with employees -- to recapitalize the company and 
boost the stock price. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, one way or the other the three-year battle for control of 
United Airlines will be resolved in the next few months. And it would be a 
blessing for United if it could put takeover fights behind it and concentrate 
on global opportunities in the travel business. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since last October, when a $300-a-share bid by UAL management, British 
Airways and United's pilots and flight attendants -- but not its machinists 
union -- failed, United stock has been held by unhappy shareholders. The stock 
fell from $294 a share to just above $140 a share before Monday's bid (it 
closed Tuesday at $152 a share). The Coniston group is still sitting with a 
loss of about $23 million on its holding of 11.8% of UAL stock. 
</P>
<P>
If a deal can be done with as much as $150 in cash -- plus notes and such -- 
those unhappy shareholders won't make a killing, but they'll be able to get out 
with some cash in hand. And instead of impatient shareholders, the company 
would be owned in large part by its own people through employee stock ownership 
plans (ESOPs). 
</P>
<P>
True enough, the costs of financing employee ownership would be heavy -- $4 
billion or more. But the ESOP form would help lighten them because it has tax 
advantages designed to encourage employee ownership. Thus, banks could offer 
lower interest rates because half the interest they collect on ESOP loans is 
tax deductible. 
</P>
<P>
And the company can deduct loan principal for tax purposes, too. That plus the 
fact that United owns many of its airplanes -- allowing collateral for lenders, 
or for sale-leaseback deals to lower total borrowing -- makes the financing 
do-able, says analyst Daniel Hersh of Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, a Los 
Angeles brokerage firm. 
</P>
<P>
A leading international banker agrees in principle, saying that though debt 
markets are extremely cautious these days, a lower price for UAL and the fact 
that all the company's unions are on board could well make a difference. "The 
right deal can be done," says the banker. 
</P>
<P>
Still, if United is not to be crippled by the burden of debt repayments, 
employees will have to earn their ownership by sacrifice. Through wage and work 
rule concessions, they will have to reduce United's $3-billion-a-year labor 
costs by $300 million to $400 million annually. That means all employees will 
have to do more work for the same or lower pay and eliminate obstructive work 
rules -- pilots would agree to fly two to a cockpit, for example, instead of 
insisting on rules requiring three. 
</P>
<P>
What would they get for their sacrifice? They'd get ownership of the company 
through their ESOPs. Under the Coniston plan, UAL employees would own 75% of 
the company, and public shareholders would own the other 25% in the non-voting 
shares to be issued. 
</P>
<P>
And quite possibly employees would get a bargain. Last year, analysts valued 
United's assets at $240 to $260 a share and more. Those values really haven't 
changed, even though the stock price has tumbled. Which means that United's 
employees stand right now to buy more than $5 billion worth of company for $4 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
A bonanza? Not really. The value in United's assets -- like those of any going 
business -- is potential, capable of being realized over time but not in a 
quick sale. A bust-up auction of UAL's property and planes today might bring 
little more than $3 billion. But skillful operation of the airline can produce 
more than $500 million in income per year plus appreciation of the company's 
value. And that's why the UAL proxy contest could be a model for the '90s -- 
because it might shift the emphasis back to hard-working, patient ownership. 
</P>
<P>
If its employees keep United tops among world airlines, they can not only get 
rich but prove that the long term is a better bargain than the short.

CONSUMER PRICES LEAP 0.5%; WEATHER FLUCTUATIONS CITED

Consumer prices jumped 0.5% in February as retailers introduced higher-priced 
spring and summer clothes earlier than usual because of warm winter weather in 
much of the country, the Labor Department reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Energy prices, which fueled a 1.1% surge in January's consumer price index, 
dipped somewhat last month in another reflection of the unusually mild weather 
patterns. Food prices, however, continued to rise in February. 
</P>
<P>
Economists, viewing the recent ups and downs as the consequence of a warm 
January and February following a record cold December, have not altered their 
consensus: Inflation is still running at an annual rate of 4.5% to 5%. 
</P>
<P>
"Weather was the distorting factor here," said Irwin L. Kellner, chief 
economist at Manufacturers Hanover in New York. "The warm January and February 
made people all over the country want to dress like Californians, so there was 
a clamor for spring and summer clothes and the lines were brought up a month or 
two early." 
</P>
<P>
Bureau of Labor Statistics analysts estimated that fully 40% of February's 
advance in retail prices was caused by a 3.3% jump in apparel prices. 
</P>
<P>
Although government statisticians normally adjust their numbers to account for 
such events as the introduction of new product lines, February's clothing price 
hikes were subject to no seasonal adjustments because fashion introductions 
normally occur in March or April. 
</P>
<P>
"That 3.3% increase could not be corrected by the normal seasonal adjustments, 
and that kind of increase is unlikely to continue," Kellner noted. 
</P>
<P>
Energy costs, which jumped 5.1% in January as buyers rushed to replenish oil 
and gasoline inventories depleted by December's record cold snap, dipped 0.7% 
in February, the Labor Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
But food prices, which gained 1.8% in January, advanced another 0.5% last 
month. Both increases reflected big jumps in the price of freeze-damaged fresh 
fruit and vegetables, which rose 10.2% in January and another 0.9% in February. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile food and energy elements, the "core" inflation rate in 
February was 0.5%, the same as the overall rate. In January, core inflation was 
0.6%, considerably below the energy-distorted overall rate. 
</P>
<P>
Before seasonal adjustment, consumer prices in the Los Angeles-Long 
Beach-Anaheim metropolitan area rose a steep 1%, compared to 0.4% nationwide.

MEATPACKER, OSHA SETTLE ON MOTION INJURIES; 
</P>
<P>
WORKPLACE: MORRELL &amp; CO. ACCORD ON TREATING REPETITIVE-STRESS AILMENTS MAY 
SERVE AS A MODEL FOR THE INDUSTRY.

<P>
John Morrell &amp; Co., one of the nation's largest meatpacking companies, has 
reached a settlement with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
that is expected to serve as an industry model for treating repetitive-motion 
injuries, sources said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, which is scheduled to be announced today, Morrell will pay 
a fine of $990,000 and will make a $250,000 grant to the National Institute for 
Occupational Safety and Health. A year ago the company was fined $4.3 million 
for safety conditions at its South Dakota plant. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department has targeted the nation's red meat industry in an effort 
to deal with the often crippling repetitive-motion injuries, which range from 
bursitis to carpal tunnel syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement with Morrell covers the operations of its slaughtering and 
processing operations at Sioux Falls and is similar to an agreement signed in 
late 1988 with IBP Inc., the nation's largest meatpacker. The Morrell agreement 
calls for the appointment of 15 "ergonomic monitors" to be picked by the United 
Food and Commercial Workers union, which represents company employees, and a 
study of all jobs in the plant by an outside expert in ergonomics. 
</P>
<P>
Ergonomics is the science of making the workplace conform to the physical needs 
of the worker. 
</P>
<P>
But sources said the medical treatment program agreed to by Morrell goes far 
beyond the agreement with IBP and requires the company to hire a noted 
neurologist from Johns Hopkins University to oversee the medical operations of 
the plant. Sources said the agreement would give the medical consultant wide 
discretion to change the Morrell program as she saw fit. 
</P>
<P>
Injured workers at the Morrell plant, which slaughters and "disassembles" more 
than 1,000 cows and pigs a day, will be allowed to seek treatment from their 
own doctors. In the past, injured workers were required to seek treatment from 
company doctors at a Sioux Falls clinic that has a contract with the company. 
Employees who did not use the company doctor risked losing workers' 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new agreement, workers can not only seek treatment from their own 
doctors, but can automatically go to a doctor after just two visits to the 
plant nurse. In the IBP agreement, workers have to wait a specific amount of 
time before they can see their doctors.

U.S. Weighs New Type of S&amp;L Support: Savings and loan regulators are 
considering a controversial program that would pump taxpayer dollars into 
ailing thrift institutions before they fail. The Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corp. chose eight states whose institutions would be eligible for open thrift 
assistance but postponed until next week approval of the program itself. The 
states, selected because they are economically depressed, are: Alaska, Arizona, 
Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas.

Taste Test: Monsanto's new fat substitute, Simplesse, will debut in Simple 
Pleasures frozen dessert late this spring, going up against Breyer's Light and 
Sealtest Free Nonfat Ice Cream in a sector that saw sales in 1988 grow 43%, 
from $140 million to $200 million. Monsanto is also marketing Simplesse to 
other companies as an ingredient for nonfat or low-fat products; Kraft already 
has agreed to use it in a mayonnaise. How does Simplesse taste? Comments from a 
panel of tasters at the Boston Globe: "Good but not the real thing," "chalky, 
slightly furry aftertaste," "tastes like what a synthetic fabric would taste 
like if it melted" and "terrific for someone who can't eat ice cream." St. Paul

Healthy Chain: The largest-volume, deep-discount drug chain in the United 
States, Phar-Mor Inc. of Ohio, is also the fastest growing, with more than 70 
outlets scheduled to open in 1990. It has outpaced competitor Drug Emporium and 
plans to continue expanding. Flush with a stock offering rumored to have netted 
$80.5 million, the company can expand while reducing its bank debt and spending 
on general business needs. Chain Drug Review

Irate Shoppers: J. C. Penney's decision to polish its image and go after a more 
upscale consumer is beginning to pay off, but now it must placate its 
traditional customer, who is older and more conservative. The company received 
an avalanche of mail from shoppers irate over flashy new ads and catalogues and 
confused by changes at the stores. To keep both sides happy, Penney's 
advertising and store ambience must attract a younger crowd willing to pay more 
for brand-name goods and still retain products and prices that appeal to its 
customer base. Thus far, compromises have been successful, but the real test 
will come as Penney attempts to further update its look. Adweek's Marketing

Green Choice: One retail company not afraid of the green market is Loblaw Cos. 
of Toronto. Last year, it introduced about 100 "environment- and body-friendly" 
house brands under the President's Choice label. The products, some of which 
outsell national brands, range from peanut sauce to pet foods, diapers to soda 
crackers. While no other major grocery chain has come up with a similar line, 
some, including Great Scott! in Chicago and D'Agostino's in New York, are 
beginning to pick up some of the President's Choice products. Boston Globe

On Board Again: After airlines raised fares in late 1988, air travel took a 
noticeable dive, as would-be fliers waited for prices to drop. Late last year, 
however, they became resigned to the higher fares and resumed air travel. 
Boardings increased 5% in November and 6% in December. Domestic travel in 
December and January showed the greatest jumps since November, 1988. The 
increases are also a tonic for the soft hotel and rental car markets.

<P>
Forceful anti-inflation action by President Fernando Collor de Mello has 
sharply reduced the Brazilian money supply, curtailing financial and commercial 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
After taking office last week, Collor froze 80% of all the money deposits in 
bank accounts and financial funds -- an estimated $85 billion. The freeze 
amounted to a moratorium on most of the government's $70-billion domestic debt, 
because the debt was being turned over on the "overnight" financial market at 
interest rates that reached 83% a month. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday the "overnight" rate dropped to 18% a month. 
</P>
<P>
Many Brazilian analysts said they expect the money shortage to cause a 
recession. Jose Augusto Savazini, an economist with the University of Sao 
Paulo, predicted a drop of 6% to 7% this year in industrial production. 
</P>
<P>
Collor, in a television interview Sunday night, said the government could avoid 
recession by releasing blocked deposits into the economy as needed to stimulate 
commercial activity. 
</P>
<P>
"There is not going to be a recession," he said, emphasizing that the tough 
measures were necessary to stop inflation that was racing at more than 70% a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Stock markets in Rio and Sao Paulo were paralyzed Monday and barely stirred 
Tuesday, and commerce went into a deep slump. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper O Estado de Sao Paulo said supermarket sales Monday in Brazil's 
largest city were 30% to 40% below normal levels. Silvio Cunha, president of 
the Store Directors Club in Rio, said retail sales there have dropped by 90%. 
</P>
<P>
"Without sales, we'll have to lay people off," Cunha said. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials, however, said if widespread layoffs begin, authorities 
will take countermeasures such as increasing the period of advance notice 
required to dismiss employees. 
</P>
<P>
"The president, the minister of economy and the minister of labor have insisted 
to businessmen that they not practice dismissals," Labor Minister Antonio 
Rogelio Magri said. "The government has mechanisms to prevent this from 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
The freeze on deposits applies to amounts of more than about $1,200 in savings 
and checking accounts. It also blocks 80% of individual investments in 
financial funds or investments of more than $600, whichever amount is higher. 
</P>
<P>
The "provisional measure" says the government's central bank will retain the 
frozen deposits for 18 months, paying real interest of 6% a year and returning 
them in 12 monthly installments. Officials said deposits could be returned 
early if the anti-inflation plan is successful. 
</P>
<P>
Companies with money in financial funds will be permitted to draw up to $12,000 
of it to pay salaries and, if that is not enough, to use blocked deposits as 
collateral for loans, officials said. Many middle-income Brazilians are upset 
over the freeze on deposits. Some commentators called it a confiscation. But 
Collor said the freeze will affect only about 10% of the population. 
</P>
<P>
To distinguish between frozen funds and circulating money, the government 
changed the name of Brazil's currency from novo cruzado back to cruzeiro, the 
name it had until 1986. The cruzeiro has the same value as the novo cruzado. 
</P>
<P>
The new president also froze prices temporarily. In mid-April, authorities will 
calculate a pre-set indexer that will set legal price increases for the 
following 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Federal police and other government agents monitored stores Tuesday throughout 
Brazil, enforcing an official price list. Another measure provides for fines 
and up to five years in jail for "economic abuses," including overpricing. 
</P>
<P>
The provisional measures must be approved by the Congress to stay in effect for 
more than a month.

</P>

INSURANCE: THE FIRM, WHICH SOUGHT BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION IN 1989, ALSO SAYS 
REVISED FIGURES FOR '88 SHOW ITS LOSS WAS $611.8 MILLION.

Maxicare Health Plans has lost half of its enrollment since filing for Chapter 
11 bankruptcy protection a year ago. Enrollment declined to about 320,000 from 
about 650,000 enrolled last March, the company said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The company also revised its 1988 annual loss from the previously reported 
$267.8 million to $611.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
The figures compare membership in the health maintenance organizations that the 
Los Angeles-based company decided it wanted to keep after emerging from Chapter 
11 proceedings. Overall, Maxicare began last year with more than 1 million 
members, but it sold or closed several plans as part of its efforts to 
reorganize into a financially healthier company. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare spokesman Jim Lucas said the company lost about a third of its 
enrollment in the first three months after the Chapter 11 filing. It lost 
another 50,000 or so members during the open enrollment season between last 
September and Jan. 31, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare began an aggressive advertising campaign in November designed to 
persuade members to stay with the plan and used the bankruptcy proceedings to 
force companies that wanted to drop the plan to offer it again to members. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the drop in membership, Maxicare Chairman and Chief Executive Peter J. 
Ratican said in an interview that the company is still a relatively large one 
in the industry. The drop in enrollment has not been a major problem and in 
fact "may have improved our services," he said, adding, "The system is working 
at maximum efficiency." 
</P>
<P>
The revised loss figures for 1988 were contained in a disclosure statement the 
company filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana on the first 
anniversary of the March 16, 1989, bankruptcy filing. They were audited 
results, while the figures reported shortly after the bankruptcy filing last 
year were unaudited, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of 1989, unaudited figures filed in the same 
disclosure statement showed a net loss of $22.3 million on revenue of $412.3 
million. Revenue in 1988 was $1.6 billion (audited), Maxicare said. 
</P>
<P>
Ratican said the company is optimistic despite the financial losses and drop in 
enrollment. "We believe that 1990 is a year when we'll show profitable 
numbers," he said. "We are moving steadily toward our goal of emerging from 
reorganization in 1990 as a financially strong competitor," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 1988 losses were incurred by health maintenance organizations the 
company either sold or closed, Maxicare said. Losses during 1989 were due 
primarily to the expense of the Chapter 11 reorganization and to overhead cost 
that the company was unable to cut as fast as the decline in revenue, Lucas 
said. He said the company had to keep some staff members to take care of 
service commitments it retained even after it closed or sold some plans. 
</P>
<P>
The company in January finally reduced its corporate staff to about 640 people. 
The positive effect of those cuts should be reflected in 1990 results, Ratican 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said about $11 million of the 1989 loss was attributed to legal expenses 
from the Chapter 11 proceedings, and the company had some writedowns. The 
company, however, has a positive cash flow, Ratican said. "We have been cash 
flow positive since March of 1989," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy filing suspended Maxicare debts prior to that date, but Ratican 
said Maxicare has since paid current bills on time. He said health-care 
providers are being paid within 10 days of billing. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare in January announced a reorganization plan that would result in 
health-care providers owning about 40% of the reorganized company. Under the 
plan, formally filed with the court along with the disclosure statements, 
creditors overall would own about 98% of the 10 million new shares the company 
plans to issue when the reorganization plan is approved. Doctors, hospitals and 
banks would also receive cash and 10 year, 13.5% notes. Bondholders would 
receive cash and stock. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing on the plan is scheduled for April 23. Maxicare said Tuesday that the 
creditors committee that initially reacted favorably to the plan has now 
decided to recommend its approval.

Officers of First Executive Corp. have declined to appear voluntarily before an 
Assembly committee investigating the life insurance company's extensive junk 
bond investments, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Johnston (D-Stockton), chairman of the Assembly Finance and Insurance 
Committee, seeks legislation to protect policyholders against the insolvency of 
their life insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based First Executive in January announced a $515-million writeoff 
against fourth-quarter profit to reflect the lower value of its junk bond 
portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Johnston subpoenaed Fred Carr, First Executive's chief executive, 
and Doug Marcian, its chief investment officer, regarding their use of a 
strategy of junk bond investments engineered by Michael Milken. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter, First Executive President Alan Snyder told Johnston that Carr and 
Marcian would not testify because of the time needed for preparation and "the 
adverse publicity that would be generated by a hearing in which the central 
focus is the company's standing in the insurance community."

ADVISER PLEADS GUILTY TO THEFT AND EVADING TAXES

An adviser to some of the most prominent takeover specialists of the 1980s 
pleaded guilty Tuesday to stealing $1 million from clients and evading and 
falsifying state income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Donald C. Carter, 41, chairman and founder of the Carter Organization Inc., 
waived indictment and pleaded guilty in state Supreme Court in Manhattan to 
grand larceny and filing a false and fraudulent personal income tax return. 
</P>
<P>
Among those Carter worked for as a proxy solicitor were T. Boone Pickens Jr., 
Saul P. Steinberg, Irwin A. Jacobs and Sir James Goldsmith. 
</P>
<P>
The firm, which had suspended Carter from his duties on Monday, announced later 
Tuesday that it had fired Carter. In a news release, the firm said that until 
Carter's statement published in Monday's Wall Street Journal that he intended 
to plead guilty to the charges, "Mr. Carter denied that he stole from some of 
the clients of the Carter Organization." 
</P>
<P>
"The Carter Organization, as Mr. Carter's former employer, said it is committee 
to cooperating with those clients to remedy any damage caused by Mr. Carter's 
criminality," the statement read. "The company is also committed to ensuring 
that this kind of conduct can never reoccur." 
</P>
<P>
The Carter Organization also stated it would take "appropriate action" if 
Carter was found to have defrauded the company. 
</P>
<P>
James W. Wetzler, commissioner of the state Taxation and Finance Department, 
called Carter's plea a "symbol of the greed that motivated so much of the 
'80s." Officials made the announcement at a news conference here. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Goldstock, director of the New York State Organized Crime Task Force, 
which headed the Carter investigation, said business records seized at Carter's 
Manhattan office and at a Brooklyn warehouse showed a "systematic pattern of 
greed and fraud." 
</P>
<P>
He said that between 1984 and 1989 Carter routinely billed his clients for 
non-existent or inflated expenses and when questioned about the expenses, he 
supplied fraudulent documentation to justify them. 
</P>
<P>
The corporate clients he was said to have defrauded included Union Carbide 
Corp., Shell Oil, Caesars World Inc. and MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Group Inc., 
which owns the Revlon cosmetics company. 
</P>
<P>
Carter had faced up to 11 years in prison, but Justice George F. Roberts 
promised him a prison term of 16 months to 4 years and a fine of up to $2 
million when he is sentenced May 2.

CITICORP MARKETING MOVE: S&amp;LS WILL BE CALLED BANKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Seeking to distance itself from the thrift crisis and enhance its marketing 
clout, Citicorp announced Tuesday that it plans to change the names of its 
Citicorp Savings subsidiaries in California and other states to "Citibank, 
Federal Savings Bank." 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that research says the name 'bank' has a distinctively 
stronger appeal than does 'S&amp;L,' " Citicorp Chairman John S. Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
Reed made the announcement during his "State of Citicorp" speech here before 
securities analysts, in which he warned of continuing short-term losses from 
bad real estate loans and from the company's Los Angeles-based Quotron Systems. 
But he said he hoped for annual earnings of $5 billion by the end of the 
decade, up from $498 million in 1989 and $1.86 billion in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Citicorp Savings' 140 branches in California, the name change 
will apply to Citicorp thrifts in Florida, Illinois and Washington. Despite 
being called banks, the subsidiaries will still operate as savings and loans. 
</P>
<P>
The company plans to eventually link the 252 thrift branches to the entire 
Citicorp network and include Citi-One, a service that will integrate a wide 
variety of accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Recent changes in federal laws removed limitations that had restricted Citicorp 
from using the name of its flagship New York bank, Citibank, with its S&amp;L 
units. 
</P>
<P>
Citicorp entered the California market in the early 1980s when it bought 
Fidelity Federal Savings &amp; Loan and later thrifts owned by Sears, Roebuck 
&amp; Co. Citicorp, the nation's largest bank holding company, has made it 
clear that it would like to expand in California, already its second-biggest 
domestic market behind New York. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Reed nor Citicorp spokesman John Maloney would say what properties the 
company is interested in, but the company has traditionally bought ailing 
thrifts and then bolstered them with cash infusions. 
</P>
<P>
Reed said he expects Quotron, an international securities-market data system 
provider, to be out of the red by the mid-1990s. He predicted that the division 
will start to rebound as new data services are introduced. 
</P>
<P>
Citicorp, like so many other banks, has also suffered from the sluggish real 
estate market. The company's renegotiated and non-performing domestic real 
estate loans rose 112% last year, to $1.6 billion from $548 million. And Reed 
said he expects losses to continue at least for the next six months. 
</P>
<P>
"We are clearly going through a tough patch in the U.S. marketplace," Reed 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas G. Labrecque, president of Citicorp rival Chase Manhattan Corp., also 
said Tuesday that he expects to see a steady increase in problem real estate 
loans over the next several months as sluggishness in many commercial and 
residential markets continues. 
</P>
<P>
But Reed denied recent newspaper reports that Citicorp plans to de-emphasize 
lending to large real estate ventures, adding, "We have a long-term commitment 
to this business."

NEW KIDS IN COURT: FAN PHONE LINES SPARK SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The New Kids on the Block pop group filed an unusual lawsuit on Tuesday, 
accusing USA Today, Star magazine and three other companies of unfairly 
profiting from the singers by urging fans to pay up to $2 a minute to phone in 
to voice their opinions on the group. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, which also names promoters Star Talk, Media Promotions and 
Merry-Go-Round Enterprises as defendants, seeks combined damages of more than 
$50 million. It alleges that each of the defendants leased 900-prefix lines 
from the telephone company to earn revenue from toll charges on fans' incoming 
calls. The lawsuit also alleges that the 900-prefix telephone service unfairly 
competed with the New Kids on the Block's own 900 service lines that have been 
in operation for several months. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pure commercial exploitation," said Philip Heller, the group's attorney. 
The group has sold more than 14 million records. 
</P>
<P>
None of the defendants could be reached for comment late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
When the 900-prefix information service lines were first introduced by 
telephone companies in the early 1980s, they were mostly used by news 
organizations to poll viewers and readers about various current affairs issues. 
</P>
<P>
But in recent years, the telephone numbers have been used by a growing number 
of entrepreneurs as well as many rap and dance music groups, who use the 
900-prefix numbers as marketing devices to build fan support. The service 
differs from toll-free 800-prefix telephone lines in that callers are usually 
assessed toll charges of about $2 for the first minute and a $1 or more for 
each additional minute. 
</P>
<P>
A key legal issue in the dispute will be "to what degree the polls were 
'information gatherers' as opposed to 'money generators,' " said Lionel S. 
Sobel, a Loyola Law School professor and editor of the Entertainment Law 
Reporter in Santa Monica. On the other hand, he said, "The New Kids on the 
Block get a lot of (free) publicity out of these kinds of things."

PRICE OF MATZO FIXED, N.J. INDICTMENT CLAIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The B. Manischewitz Co., one of the nation's leading kosher food manufacturers, 
was indicted by a federal grand jury for conspiring to fix wholesale prices in 
the U.S. matzo market, Department of Justice officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The one-count indictment alleges that Manischewitz and a group of unnamed 
co-conspirators illegally agreed to increase the price of "Kosher for Passover" 
matzo products for at least five years. 
</P>
<P>
Manischewitz officials denied the charge and said in a written statement 
Tuesday that the company will "vigorously defend" itself. 
</P>
<P>
A Newark grand jury charged in the indictment, which was filed Monday, that the 
matzo maker conspired to fix prices from 1981 through at least April, 1986. The 
Jersey City, N.J., firm and other kosher food companies have been under 
investigation for more than two years. The investigation is continuing, said 
Joe Krovisky, a Department of Justice spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"During the period of time covered by this indictment, the defendant and 
co-conspirators were the major manufacturers of Kosher for Passover matzo 
products in the United States," the indictment said. "Their customers were 
primarily distributors of kosher food products who sold to supermarket chains 
and independent grocery stores." 
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, Manischewitz and its co-conspirators sold roughly 
$25 million worth of special matzo -- a flat, unleavened bread -- during the 
course of the alleged Passover plot. 
</P>
<P>
What makes Passover matzo different from all others is that, during 
preparation, Jewish employees carefully remove a small piece of dough from each 
batch to be burned as a symbol of offerings made at temples in ancient times. 
</P>
<P>
Manischewitz was founded in 1888 in Cincinnati, then a center of Jewish 
culture, by Rabbi Dov Behr Manischewitz. Matzo was the company's first -- and 
for many years only -- product. Today it accounts for half of the company's 
annual sales of about $30 million. The company also makes a full line of kosher 
foods for Passover and daily use. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury charged in the indictment that Manischewitz and its cohorts 
conspired to fix prices in the following fashion: The companies discussed the 
amounts by which matzo prices would be increased; they agreed to increase matzo 
prices; the prices they charged their customers reflected the hikes agreed upon 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"Manischewitz denies the charges and maintains that its prices have been 
independently and fairly determined and have never been set pursuant to any 
agreement with any competitor," company officials said in a written statement.

Technology center -- A Tuesday story incorrectly reported that the San Diego 
city Planning Department recommended against a 56.4-acre research campus on 
Torrey Pines Mesa. The department recommended approving the La Jolla Pines 
Technology Centre -- despite findings that it would add to traffic congestion, 
air pollution and the fouling of water in Los Penasquitos Lagoon -- because the 
project would promote job opportunities and encourage the development of 
facilities for research in the life sciences.

A Cypress motorcyclist was listed in stable condition this morning after 
suffering moderate injuries when he slammed into an 18-wheel truck, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Johnson, 18, was pulling out of a parking lot on Katella Boulevard east 
of Beach Boulevard in Stanton about 8:10 p.m. Tuesday when he collided with the 
truck, Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Jay Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson apparently was not aware that the truck was attempting to turn right 
into a private driveway, Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
"When he noticed that the truck was turning, he tried to go around it, but hit 
the rear of the truck," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson received moderate injuries to his head and back and was taken to UCI 
Medical Center in Orange, Mendez said.

U.S. Census officials in Orange County said today that the ambitious nationwide 
effort to count the homeless went off without a hitch locally but that several 
of the 200 census takers who fanned out across the area expressed surprise that 
more people weren't discovered living on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Although final figures had yet to be compiled, census officials said field 
enumerators reported spotting far fewer homeless people during the survey than 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
Surveys of homeless people in shelters on Tuesday night produced the sorts of 
totals authorities anticipated. However, there were relatively few people found 
sleeping on the streets when the enumeration effort shifted early this morning 
to the back alleys, fields and parks of the county, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've read too many stories -- they had us believing the homeless 
would be swarming all over the place," said Joe Montes, Fullerton census 
district manager. "We could be coming face to face with an exaggeration of the 
(homeless) population. We'll find out when we pool our numbers."

IRVINE FIRM SUED ON FAULTY HEART VALVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A consumer group sued two manufacturers of medical devices today, demanding 
that about 80,000 people implanted with potentially defective heart valves be 
individually warned of the risk of life-threatening failures. 
</P>
<P>
The Public Citizen Health Research Group filed its lawsuit in Los Angeles 
Superior Court on behalf of recipients of the Bjork-Shiley heart valves. 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit consumer group asked the court to order the maker of the valve, 
Shiley Inc. of Irvine, and its parent firm, Pfizer Inc. of New York, to notify 
all people who received the "convexo-concave" mechanical valve of its potential 
dangers. 
</P>
<P>
Shiley and Pfizer officials today called the suit "completely without merit." 
Doctors who implanted the valves "have been notified repeatedly of the very 
small fracture risk and have been advised to educate and monitor their 
patients," they said. 
</P>
<P>
Shiley pulled such valves from the market in November, 1986, more than five 
years after the first reports of life-threatening valve fractures in patients. 
Although the valves are no longer available, about 80,000 people -- about 
40,000 of them in the United States -- still have the devices implanted in 
their hearts, and reports of fractures continue. 
</P>
<P>
As of Feb. 20, Shiley had reported 394 fractures with 252 deaths, one occurring 
just six months ago, linked to its convexo-concave valves. Congressional 
investigators say those numbers may be 50% too low. 
</P>
<P>
A report by the Democratic staff of a House subcommittee recently accused 
Shiley of failing to report valve fractures promptly to the Food and Drug 
Administration and of playing down the risks in a warning letter sent only to 
the surgeons who implanted the devices. 
</P>
<P>
"Shiley and Pfizer have engaged in a longstanding and continuing course of 
deceptive and fraudulent conduct in order to conceal the valve defects and 
their risks," said Dr. Sidney Wolfe of Public Citizen. 
</P>
<P>
Besides directly warning valve recipients, the Public Citizen suit demands that 
Shiley and Pfizer pay for medical consultation so patients can be advised of 
symptoms of imminent valve failure and benefits of possible valve removal.

Despite warnings it was weakening existing law, the Senate refused today to 
require the Environmental Protection Agency to impose smog cleanup plans on 
cities that do not adopt tough enough anti-pollution measures. 
</P>
<P>
In another important victory for Senate leaders determined to protect their 
compromise clean air bill with the Bush Administration, senators voted 53-46 
against a plan by Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) to preserve the mandatory EPA 
enforcement provisions in the current Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
Kerry's amendment also would have wiped out controversial sections of the 
compromise bill that would allow states to obtain emission reduction waivers 
from the EPA if necessary pollution control measures cost more than $5,000 per 
ton of pollutants eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental groups and more than a dozen governors lobbied senators to 
support Kerry's amendment, saying the compromise bill was too weak to ensure 
speedy cleanup of urban smog.

BUSH SHUNS ROLE OF CENSOR OVER ARTS FUNDED BY U.S.

<P>
The Bush Administration told Congress today it would not seek to control the 
content of art supported with federal tax dollars. The decision seemed sure to 
anger right-wing Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Controversy over whether to restrict content of federally financed art received 
extensive publicity last year because of two photographic exhibits supported by 
money from the National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
One, by Robert Mapplethorpe, included depictions of sadomasochism and 
homoerotic acts. Another, by Andres Serrano, depicted a crucifix in a jar of 
urine. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, this year's spending bill contained restrictions, inspired by Sen. 
Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), on financing obscene works and gave a definition of 
obscene within limits set by the Supreme Court. The restrictions were effective 
for one year only. 
</P>
<P>
In submitting legislation today to extend the existence of the arts endowment 
another five years, starting Oct. 1, the Bush Administration chose not to 
include "content restrictions" similar to those that apply this year. 
</P>
<P>
John F. Frohnmayer, chairman of the arts endowment, spelled out the 
Administration's reasoning in testimony before the House Education and Labor 
subcommittee on post-secondary education. 
</P>
<P>
He said the content restrictions in effect this year caused "much concern and 
confusion" within the arts community. 
</P>
<P>
"After much careful thought and discussion, it is our conclusion that the 
legislation proposed here which contains no content restrictions, along with 
measures discussed earlier, will best serve the American public," Frohnmayer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The other measures mentioned by Frohnmayer include ways to improve the system 
for evaluating grants. The NEA will develop a "grid" to assure that all 
geographic areas are represented and that as many cultures as possible are 
represented. The makeup of the evaluation panels also will be diversified. 
</P>
<P>
"Will these modifications in the panel process eliminate controversy?" he 
asked. "Probably not. I do not see as a desirable goal that the art which the 
federal government supports be so bland that no one even notices it." 
</P>
<P>
Anne G. Murphy, executive director of the American Arts Alliance, which opposes 
content restrictions, said she was pleased by Frohnmeyer's comments but 
cautious about whether the Administration will succeed in keeping NEA free of 
such restrictions.

President Bush today reaffirmed U.S. support for Poland's present borders and 
assured Warsaw that it will have a voice in any issues, including German 
reunification, that affect Poland's future. 
</P>
<P>
"In all decisions affecting the fate of Poland, Poland must have a voice," Bush 
said at a state welcoming ceremony for Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz 
Mazowiecki. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who met with Mazowiecki for more than one hour and asked the prime 
minister to come back for further talks Thursday, restated Washington's backing 
of Poland's borders. He pledged to work for "a new Europe in which the security 
of all European states and their fundamental right to exist secure within their 
present borders is totally assured." 
</P>
<P>
In a bid to attract investment into Poland, Bush and Mazowiecki signed an 
agreement committing Poland to standard Western business practices regarding 
expropriation, currency transfers, patents, intellectual property and other 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who pledged continued U.S. aid to help Poland's movement toward a market 
economy, also approved the opening of a Polish consulate in Los Angeles and 
lifted all travel restrictions on Polish diplomats in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
His border comments were a bid to allay Warsaw's fears that a powerful, 
reunified German state might make demands on Polish territory that once 
belonged to Germany. 
</P>
<P>
But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater made clear that the United States 
opposed Polish admission to the so-called "two plus four" German unification 
talks among the two Germanys and the four World War II victors -- the United 
States, the Soviet Union, France and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the current structure is the correct one. That it should remain two 
plus four, not two plus five or six, not additional countries," the spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Secretary of State Raymond Seitz, who briefed reporters after the 
talks, described Bush's promise to give Poland a voice as "simply a statement 
that we understand Polish concerns and we will listen to Poland's concerns and 
we will respond to Poland's concerns." He said there are a number of forums in 
which Warsaw could be heard.

The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum said today it had received a ransom inquiry 
for a dozen priceless works stolen from the unique gallery in the biggest art 
heist in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI, meanwhile, was expected to release composite pictures later in the day 
of the two thieves who robbed the Gardner in a daring pre-dawn heist Sunday, 
cutting two Rembrandts from their frames, and walking off with a Vermeer -- one 
of the fewer than 40 known to exist. 
</P>
<P>
Museum Director Anne Hawley told reporters the ransom inquiry was relayed by a 
woman in the art world whose work she was familiar with. 
</P>
<P>
She said the woman, whom she would not identify, had received an anonymous call 
from someone who claimed to know the whereabouts of the stolen artworks. 
</P>
<P>
"The call was from out of the city and was from an individual who claimed to 
have had an anonymous phone call from someone who knew where the works were and 
what the amount of the reward was," Hawley said outside the museum's 
cordoned-off Dutch Room, from which five works were stolen. 
</P>
<P>
The call was made an hour before the museum announced Tuesday that a $1-million 
reward, underwritten by the international auction houses Christie's and 
Sotheby's, would be offered for the safe return of the artworks. 
</P>
<P>
Hawley said she had "no way of knowing" if the tip would pan out. Many calls 
have been received by the FBI and the museum and "every tip is followed up," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The museum also disclosed that a 13th item had been discovered missing -- a 
gilt eagle finial from the pole of a silk Napoleonic flag. 
</P>
<P>
None of the works were insured for theft. 
</P>
<P>
The museum, which reopened today for the first time since the theft, was robbed 
by two men posing as Boston police officers who persuaded two guards to let 
them in. The guards were then sprayed with Mace, handcuffed and gagged. 
</P>
<P>
In the Dutch Room, blank spaces could be seen today where Vermeer's "The 
Concert," and Rembrandt's "Lady and Gentleman in Black" and "The Storm on the 
Sea of Galilee," his only known seascape, once hung.

Commerce Secretary S. P. Shukla said Coke's application to build a $3-million 
plant in an export zone had been rejected. "The reasons for our move will be 
explained in a letter to the applicant," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Commerce said "protection of India's domestic 
market played a major factor in the decision." 
</P>
<P>
A request by PepsiCo. Inc. for an additional plant probably would also be 
rejected, she added, speaking on condition of not being identified in keeping 
with government practice. 
</P>
<P>
Coke left India in 1977 when it refused to give the government details of its 
secret syrup formula. An Indian company, calling itself Campa Cola, adopted 
Coke's logo but not the taste. 
</P>
<P>
The Coca Cola Co. applied two years ago to manufacture its syrup in an export 
processing zone. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, only 25% of its output would have been sold in India to 
local bottlers. As an added incentive, Coke offered to invest in a joint 
venture in southern India to export tea concentrate to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Coke's goal was to break into India's $350-million soft drink market which is 
now controlled by three domestic soda companies.

<P>
A Greyhound bus carrying 50 people on Interstate 81 in Virginia was hit by 
three shots fired from a passing car, but no one was injured, state police said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting was the 14th incident of violence in the often heated strike since 
about 9,000 Greyhound workers walked out on strike March 2. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiators for Greyhound and its striking drivers have been talking to federal 
mediators but not to each other and remained far apart in efforts to cement a 
contract that could bring the employees back to work. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia State Trooper E. R. Adams, who was investigating the Interstate 81 
incident that occurred between Roanoke and Christiansburg, said three small 
holes were found in the windshield of the bus, possibly from a small-caliber 
rifle.

<P>
De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the world's biggest diamond producer, 
announced today that it will raise prices for uncut stones by 5.5% next Monday 
to cash in on strong demand. 
</P>
<P>
The South African mining firm controls about 80% of world trade in rough, or 
uncut, diamonds through its London-based Central Selling Organization. 
</P>
<P>
It noted exports were running at record levels, particularly from manufacturing 
centers like Israel and India, for polished stones of up to 1 carat in weight. 
</P>
<P>
"The market shows strong, sustained and sustainable demand," a De Beers 
spokesman said. "It's not a flash in the pan." 
</P>
<P>
This had led to premiums being charged on stones of up to 1 carat sold in the 
open market outside CSO control, which influenced the organization's decision 
to raise its prices.

BAT Industries PLC, the British conglomerate fighting a takeover bid from Sir 
James Goldsmith's Hoylake Investments Ltd., today reported a 38% jump in 
profits during 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The results were helped by record earnings from the group's tobacco interests 
and a near doubling of profits at its financial services division. 
</P>
<P>
BAT said last year's net income totaled $2.07 billion, compared with $1.5 
billion in 1988. The latest results included a $197-million one-time gain from 
restructurings. 
</P>
<P>
Annual sales increased 25% to $35 billion from $28 billion. 
</P>
<P>
BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy described the results as excellent in light of the 
"distractions forced on us by Hoylake." 
</P>
<P>
The $21-billion Hoylake bid has been suspended while U.S. state insurance 
regulators review the effect a change of ownership would have on BAT's Farmers 
Insurance Group Inc. of Los Angeles.

CRITICAL 'NUNS' REVIEW ANGERED FOX, SISKEL SAYS

Film critic Gene Siskel said today 20th Century Fox suggested that he and 
fellow critic Roger Ebert "went over the edge" in criticizing the Fox film 
"Nuns on the Run." 
</P>
<P>
The studio has indefinitely banned the pair from screening previews of its 
films after they panned the movie. 
</P>
<P>
"They're accusing us of not having a sense of humor and I'm accusing them of 
not having one," Siskel said on the CBS-TV program "CBS This Morning." "They 
are suggesting we went over the edge, but we did take the film seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Siskel, a Chicago Tribune film critic, and Ebert, a film critic for the Chicago 
Sun-Times, were guests last week on the "Live -- Regis &amp; Kathie Lee" 
television show and panned the Fox movie by saying it didn't contain a single 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can find a laugh in this film, I'll give you a shiny new dime for every 
one," Ebert said. "And you'll not become a rich man." 
</P>
<P>
What really caused the Fox fur to fly was when Ebert held up a newspaper ad for 
the movie with a quote from the Village Voice calling it "the funniest 
anti-clerical transvestite comedy of the decade." 
</P>
<P>
"I know you're a very clever man -- I wonder if you can spot the fallacy," 
Ebert quipped. 
</P>
<P>
"How many others have there been?" Siskel asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, this is 1990. How many other transvestite, anti-clerical comedies have 
there been so far in this decade?" Ebert continued. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure the (Village Voice) critic meant it as a joke and it was a launching 
point for our discussion of the film," Siskel said. 
</P>
<P>
Siskel and Ebert said they would still review Fox movies on their syndicated 
television show. The only difference will be that viewers will not be able to 
see the film clips. 
</P>
<P>
What will they do without the clips? 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we'll act out the parts," Siskel said.

There's an environmental tie-in with the new book on drums by Mickey Hart, one 
of the Grateful Dead's two drummers. 
</P>
<P>
"Drumming at the Edge of Magic: A Journey into the Spirit of Percussion," which 
will be published in September by Harper &amp; Row, is about the history and 
significance of drumming and Hart's travels around the world in pursuit of 
ancient and endangered drumming traditions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a natural progression from learning about endangered music to caring 
about our endangered planet," says Hart. Therefore, because of Hart's concern 
for the environment, particularly rain forests, his publisher will plant two 
trees in a South American rain forest for every one tree required to produce 
his book. 
</P>
<P>
"Although obviously the paper used for book production doesn't come from rain 
forest trees, we see this action as a powerful symbol of our joint 
responsibility for replenishing natural resources," said Clayton Carlson, 
publisher of Harper &amp; Row in San Francisco.

Tom Scholz, leader of the rock group Boston, did not breach a contract with CBS 
Records when the group failed to deliver a record album, a federal jury has 
ruled. 
</P>
<P>
Ending a seven-year court battle, the U.S. District Court jury also ruled 
Tuesday that CBS Records did not engage in a conspiracy against Scholz when it 
tried to stop other record companies from signing him. 
</P>
<P>
CBS Records sued the entire band in 1983, charging it with failing to deliver 
the requisite number of albums under a 1976 contract. Charges against other 
band members were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
The band's first two albums, released in the 1970s, "Boston" and "Don't Look 
Back," went platinum. 
</P>
<P>
CBS expected a third album by 1981. Despite promises by Scholz to CBS 
executives and rock magazines that the third album was imminent, no record was 
made. CBS suspended Scholz's royalties in 1983, then sued. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for both sides said the jury apparently believed Scholz's argument that 
the delay in producing the third album was rooted in the creative process. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel great," said Scholz, the group's founder. The jury "somehow picked up 
that I didn't care about the money."

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: THE HUMBLE ASPIRIN MAY BE THE WORLD'S WONDER DRUG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GRAEDON, TERESA GRAEDON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a wonder drug in your medicine cabinet and the chances are you don't 
even appreciate it. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest medication of all time was introduced in 1899 and even after 90 
years, medical science is still discovering new uses for the humble aspirin 
tablet. 
</P>
<P>
Back around the turn of the century, aspirin earned a reputation for relieving 
pain, lowering fever and reducing inflammation. Eighty years later researchers 
are discovering that aspirin may prevent heart attacks, migraine headaches, 
diabetic complications and maybe even Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
In the Physicians' Health Study, 22,000 doctors were recruited. Half took one 
aspirin tablet every other day, while the other half received a placebo. The 
study was halted prematurely because the results were so impressive. 
</P>
<P>
The physicians receiving aspirin had only half as many heart attacks as the 
others, and the researchers felt it would be unethical to deprive their MD 
guinea pigs of this powerful prophylactic. 
</P>
<P>
Further analysis of the data reveals that the doctors on aspirin also suffered 
20% fewer migraine headaches. Although one aspirin every other day wouldn't 
halt a migraine in progress, it seemed to discourage these vicious headaches 
from getting started. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers suspect that aspirin works this magic by keeping blood platelets 
from sticking together. These cells are often responsible for blood clots that 
can trigger a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Richard Peto reported equally encouraging results from a study of British 
doctors. Aspirin-users had almost 30% fewer migraines. He suggests, "A migraine 
patient should consider taking a baby aspirin a day." 
</P>
<P>
Such a dose (80 mg -- one-fourth of a regular aspirin tablet) may end up being 
the optimal dose against heart attacks as well. Although most people find it 
hard to believe that such a tiny amount of ordinary aspirin could do anything, 
these very low doses have profound effects on the blood. 
</P>
<P>
A study of diabetics demonstrated that aspirin could slow deterioration of the 
tiny blood vessels feeding the retina of the eye. As a consequence, aspirin may 
help hold off damage to eyesight that is one of the serious consequences of 
diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most extraordinary new use for aspirin may come from theories about 
Alzheimer's disease. Researchers are speculating that inflammation in the 
nervous system may be part of the process behind this destructive disease. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Patrick McGeer, professor of psychiatry at the University of British 
Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, observes that aspirin may prevent inflammation 
that leads to cell death in the brain. "I've never seen a rheumatoid arthritis 
patient with signs of Alzheimer's on autopsy," he notes.

<TEXT>
<P>
Margaret Waldron, 74 and legally blind, made holes-in-one on the same hole on 
consecutive days at Amelia Island Plantation, using the same iron and the same 
scarred golf ball. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't sunk in yet. If it happens as infrequently as my husband says, I'm 
going to go out and buy some lottery tickets," she said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Waldron, who has only peripheral vision and relies upon her husband, Pete, to 
tell her direction and distance, mastered the Long Point Course's 87-yard No. 7 
hole using a 7-iron and an old Ultra golf ball she had found several days 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"I've retired it now," she said of the ball. "It's kind of beat up, so it won't 
putt straight." 
</P>
<P>
The two organizations that track holes-in-one, the Golf Digest Hole-In-One 
Clearing House and the National Hole-In-One Assn., have no statistical odds on 
the same person making one on the same hole on consecutive days, much less a 
74-year-old legally blind woman. 
</P>
<P>
The aces were made in the company of her husband and others. 
</P>
<P>
The first, on Sunday, was witnessed by club members Jack and Beverly Hegeraty. 
The second was witnessed by Jay and Dale Gress, vacationers from Ft. 
Washington, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Waldron did not begin playing golf until age 43 but developed into a 
12-handicapper. She recorded her first hole-in-one 15 years ago at Fernandina 
Beach Muncipal Course, and she made another three years later near Pell City, 
Ala. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 years ago, she developed macular degeneration in both eyes and has 
only peripheral vision. 
</P>
<P>
She relies on her husband to give her the distance, direction and pin 
placement. On long putts, he will tend the pin and she will putt toward his 
white golf shoes. 
</P>
<P>
On drives, she will look for something about five or six feet in front and try 
to swing to that point. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her vision problem, she plays golf four times a week, usually shooting 
between 87 and 95 for 18 holes. 
</P>
<P>
She returned to the course Tuesday to see if she could hit a third hole-in-one 
on the No. 7 but bogeyed the hole. 
</P>
<P>
"I missed a 10-foot par putt, like a dummy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The worst thing about the holes-in-one was that she was unable to see them. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't see it, of course," she said of her Sunday ace. "But the woman I was 
playing with said, 'Ohhh, that's pretty! Ohhh, it's in the cup!' I didn't 
believe her."

arena in which he hopes to eventually house two new professional sports 
franchises. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Buss said he has been scouting North County sites to build a home for a 
National Basketball Assn. team and a National Hockey League expansion 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
"If I can get a grant on some land and the franchises, the rest of it is a slam 
dunk," said Buss, the owner of the Forum in Inglewood, where the NBA Lakers and 
NHL Kings play. 
</P>
<P>
Buss said he has put together an unidentified group interested in relocating an 
NBA team or procuring an expansion team for his new building. He said the 
Lakers would not be involved in the San Diego arena project. 
</P>
<P>
Buss also said he has applied to the NHL for an expansion franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Buss' disclosure places him in direct competition with Harry Cooper and Richard 
Esquinas, the operators of the existing San Diego Sports Arena, who are in the 
process of applying for city permits to build a new arena downtown.

NEW ORLEANS TRACK CUTS BACK ON MEETING

The Fair Grounds race track will cut back to four-day weeks next season to have 
bigger purses for its winners. 
</P>
<P>
"Less doesn't have to be less," majority owner Louie Roussel III said Tuesday. 
"Less days is what the industry needs. We want to have less days and give the 
public better races. We want to give the horsemen better purses." 
</P>
<P>
This season, before a freeze cost the track two days and led to 12-race weekend 
cards, a typical five-day week called for 11 races a day. A 98-day season was 
scheduled, with some 12-race days. 
</P>
<P>
Next season will have 82 days -- from Thanksgiving, Nov. 22, 1990, to April 7, 
1991 -- with 12 races a day, Roussel said. 
</P>
<P>
Roussel said the track can increase purses to an average of $120,000 a day by 
eliminating Wednesday racing. He called Wednesday and Thursday "bleeding days" 
when handles don't pay for purses. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should a man stay here and run for $90,000 a day when he can go to Oaklawn 
Park and run for $160,000? The whole economy suffers when we lose 100 trainers. 
We've got to hope that by getting the purse structure up to $120,000 a day, we 
can keep some of these people," Roussel said. 
</P>
<P>
For the first 85 days of the current meeting, purses averaged $91,728 a day, 
not including quarter-horse races. On days without stakes races, daily purses 
averaged $75,039 a day; on days with stakes races, they averaged $115,571. 
</P>
<P>
The new schedule will let the track raise stakes purses, Roussel said. He said 
most $25,000-added stakes races will be boosted to $30,000-added. The Fair 
Grounds Oaks will be boosted by $10,000 to $100,000-added. And allowance 
features will be increased from $15,000 to $17,500 so the winner gets at least 
$10,000, Roussel said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that track officials considered a five-day, 45-race schedule but that 
the proposed four-day, 48-race week is more feasible.

OLYMPICS TOO BIG, PRINCESS ANNE SAYS

The Olympics have become too big for their own good, according to Princess 
Anne, one of Britain's two International Olympic Committee members. 
</P>
<P>
The princess, president of the British Olympic Assn. and the International 
Equestrian Federation, said trimming the size of the Games presented the most 
difficult decisions facing the IOC and other international sports bodies. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest danger to the movement is that it is getting too big in sheer 
weight of numbers," she said. "Other sports will become more popular in terms 
of numbers and everyone will want to be involved in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"Some very hard decision-making will happen very shortly."
