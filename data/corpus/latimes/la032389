 When Warner Bros. made only lukewarm efforts to promote Edward James Olmos for 
an Oscar nomination, the actor and his friends took matters into their own 
hands. They felt Olmos should be a nominee at the March 29 ceremonies for his 
portrayal of East Los Angeles math teacher Jaime Escalante in "Stand and 
Deliver." 
</P>
<P>
They mounted their own Oscar campaign in the Hollywood trade press. It paid off 
as Olmos won a best actor nomination for what Times film critic Sheila Benson 
called "his beautifully shaded and unsparing portrait" of Escalante. 
</P>
<P>
While Olmos has his eye on an Oscar, the awards just keep coming for Jaime 
Escalante. The California Bicentennial Commission saluted the advanced calculus 
teacher by delivering six bronze plaques commemorating the 200th anniversary of 
the drafting of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights to predominantly Latino 
Garfield High. 
</P>
<P>
"Arriba el mariachi," Linda Ronstadt said when "Canciones de Mi Padre," her 
Spanish-language "personal project," won a Grammy award in the Mexican-American 
category. Carlos Santana took the Rock Instrumental Performance award for 
orchestra, group or soloist for his "Blues for Salvador," and Roberto Carlos 
won the Latin Pop award for his album, "Roberto Carlos." Ruben Blades y Son del 
Solar captured the award in the Tropical Latin category for "Antecedente." 
</P>
<P>
KMEX-TV, Channel 34, has begun airing Spanish-language "movie specials" with 
English subtitles for the first time. The films broadcast were "La Historia 
Oficial," a painfully personal portrait from Argentina's "Dirty War," and 
"Volver a Empezar," the story of a Spanish professor who returns home after 40 
years in this country. Both won Academy Awards for best foreign film. EDWARD J.

1990 CENSUS HOLDS PROMISE FOR LATINO POLITICAL ACTIVISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Leo Estrada recalls the pitched battles of the 1970s between a band of Latino 
activists and the U.S. Census Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Back then, Estrada, who was a college professor from Texas, and his Latino 
allies inside and outside government, had a difficult time convincing East 
Coast officials "that we existed," he recalled. Estrada, a demographer, knew 
what was at stake, and he took it upon himself to persuade Latino leaders 
across the country to push for an accurate count. 
</P>
<P>
The decade-long effort paid off: The 1980 census was the best count ever of 
Latinos. It recorded a 61% population explosion nationwide, including an even 
more dramatic 87% increase in California. 
</P>
<P>
America discovered Latinos. The media touted "The Decade of the Hispanic." And 
the phrase "numbers are on our side" became a slogan among Latino activists. 
</P>
<P>
Census-based reapportionment of congressional, state and local districts is 
credited with a doubling of Latinos in Congress and the election of hundreds of 
Latino officials across the country. Because the distribution of billions of 
dollars in federal funds is also based on the census, cities and states with 
large Latino populations received additional money. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 census holds even greater promise for Latinos, according to Estrada, 
now a renowned UCLA demographer and chairman of the Hispanic advisory committee 
of the U.S. Census Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
"The 1980 census gave us a visibility we never had before on a national level," 
said Estrada. But today, he added, Latinos are better prepared to make the 
census numbers count, "to move from bragging about our growth to understanding 
how to use the numbers to improve conditions for ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Already, with census day -- April 1, 1990 -- still a year away, Latino 
organizations have begun gearing up for the decennial count and to monitor the 
reapportionment that will follow. They are also keeping a close watch on two 
lawsuits against the Census Bureau that pit the interests of states with large 
minority and immigrant populations, like California and New York, against 
states that have neither. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 census is expected to show an increase over the decade of more than 5 
million Latinos nationwide, for a total of nearly 20 million. About 1.3 million 
of that increase is expected to occur in Los Angeles County, where Latinos are 
projected to become one-third of the population. In California, Latinos are 
projected to reach 7 million, or about one-fourth of the population. 
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he also expects the census to show unprecedented changes in the 
composition and distribution of Latinos. For the first time, it will provide a 
complete breakdown by country of origin. In 1980, Central and South Americans 
were lumped into a category of "other" Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
The census will also measure whether income and education levels have improved. 
And it will reveal a lot about the "shadow" population of 3 million illegal 
immigrants who applied for amnesty under the 1986 Immigration Reform Act. 
According to census estimates, about half the growth among Latinos is 
attributable to immigration. 
</P>
<P>
Census officials say they are gearing up for their most intensive effort at 
counting hard-to-reach segments. Despite dramatic improvement in the 1980 
census, the bureau estimates that it still missed 7% of Latinos, compared to 1% 
of the general population. 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau is devoting "more staff, money and resources" to reaching 
minorities than it did in 1980, said Jose Bermea, who is coordinating the 
Census Bureau's Latino promotion campaign. 
</P>
<P>
A focus of the promotional campaigns, scheduled to begin in late spring, will 
be to encourage hard-to-reach illegal immigrants to be counted. The appeal to 
illegal immigrants will stress the census' strict confidentiality, Bermea said. 
</P>
<P>
Census questionnaires will be available in Spanish, upon request, as will 
Spanish-speaking operators and census takers for those who need assistance. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) is launching 
its own media campaign this spring across California, parts of the Midwest and 
possibly Texas. The campaign will focus on the hardest Latinos to reach -- 
illegal immigrants, day laborers, the homeless, those living in garages or 
doubled up in apartments. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge will be greater this time, said the campaign's director, Arturo 
Vargas, because the numbers of the poor and the homeless are greater. 
</P>
<P>
Concern among cities and states that stand to lose most from an under-count of 
minorities and poor led to the suit demanding that the Census Bureau correct 
the anticipated under-count with a follow-up survey. Besides Los Angeles and 
California, other plaintiffs include the city and state of New York, Chicago 
and Dade County, Fla., as well as Latino and black organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau argued that there is not enough time to conduct the 
additional survey and meet its deadline of delivering the census to the 
President on Dec. 31, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
In the other case, an anti-immigration organization, 41 congressmen and three 
states without sizable immigrant populations are demanding that illegal 
immigrants be excluded from the count for reapportionment. The organization, 
the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), filed a similar suit 10 
years ago, but without congressional backing. It lost on a legal technicality. 
</P>
<P>
Plaintiffs in both cases agree that timing is crucial if either of the court 
rulings are to be implemented in time for the 1990 census. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the cases' outcome, Latino organizations say they are preparing for 
the count and preparing early. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the next two years, we're going to be setting our political potential for 
the next decade in concrete," said Andrew Hernandez, president of the Southwest 
Voter Registration and Education Project. The organization has begun training 
groups in 150 communities nationwide to monitor redistricting, which begins in 
1991, Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
"The monitoring groups will ensure that redistricting plans brought forward at 
the local level are fair to Latino voters," he said. Historically, he noted, 
political districts have been gerrymandered at the expense of Latinos. This has 
been particularly "atrocious" in California, he added, where the proportion of 
Latinos elected to office is substantially smaller than in other southwestern 
states. 
</P>
<P>
A Justice Department lawsuit filed in September charges that the Los Angeles 
County Board of Supervisors has gerrymandered supervisorial districts to 
prevent the election of a Latino. The board -- five white men representing one 
of the largest Latino constituencies in the nation -- has vowed to fight the 
discrimination suit. They have argued that redistricting should wait until 1991 
when new census numbers are routinely used to redistrict anyway. 
</P>
<P>
But Latino advocates counter that two supervisorial elections are scheduled 
before then and should be conducted with corrected district lines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
California's Latino Population Growth 
</P>
<P>
The Latino population in California is projected to reach approximately seven 
million in the 1990 Census, one-fourth of the state's total. The number of 
Latinos, which grew steadily in the early 20th Century, rose dramatically in 
the 1950s, '60s and '70s, with a population nearly doubling each decade.

LATINO ART EXHIBITION A COLORFUL MILESTONE; ARTIST CHIDES MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Latino art exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art is a landmark 
event. The show, on national tour, is the largest art exhibition of U.S. 
Latinos ever assembled. 
</P>
<P>
"This exhibition did not happen by accident," said Howard Fox, the museum's 
curator of contemporary art. "This exhibition is an idea whose time is here." 
</P>
<P>
But at least one prominent artist complains that the museum's attention to 
Latino art is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
"The museum has demonstrated a lack of genuine interest and support for the 
Hispanic artistic community," said Carlos Almaraz, whose work is part of the 
exhibit. He pointed out that the last major Latino art exhibition there was 15 
years ago, when the museum featured "Los Four" -- local Chicano painters 
Almaraz, Frank Romero, Gilbert Lujan and Roberto de la Rocha. 
</P>
<P>
So while a large crowd toasted the exhibition on opening night, Almaraz 
boycotted the gala. "Why go to the opening?" Almaraz asked. "To say what great 
things it (the museum) has done for Hispanics? No!" 
</P>
<P>
However, he commended Jane Livingston and John Beardsley, who organized the 
show for Houston's Museum of Fine Arts. The two, curators of the Corcoran 
Gallery of Art in Washington, were "instrumental and supportive for the 
creation of this exhibition. They had the critical eyes to look at art and not 
at the politics." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, "Hispanic Art in the United States: Thirty Contemporary 
Painters and Sculptors," continues until April 16. 
</P>
<P>
The art in the exhibition is gripping. It is vivid. It is powerful and real. 
With exuberant colors, the paintings seem to scream from the walls. The exhibit 
covers the spectrum from the photorealist narrative to the abstract. Although 
its roots are in the past, it is unapologetically contemporary. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a richness in this exhibition that defies categorization. Every 
artist shown here is an artist of merit. This is a robust, diverse, impassioned 
exhibition," Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an exhibition of American and Latino art in a slightly different 
language," Beardsley said. "It is a language of forms and contents that 
portrays the Latino experience in the United States. Its strength consists in 
that it is both American and Latino art. 
</P>
<P>
"Something in the tension between the so-called dominant culture and the other 
contributes to the strength in the work," Beardsley said. "The hybridization in 
the language is one of the real strengths. Tension between cultures generates 
power in the artistic expression that emerges from it." 
</P>
<P>
There is a growing consensus that art does not have to be created by "the 
in-crowd" in New York City to be acceptable. Los Angeles artist Romero, whose 
painting "The Closing of Whittier Boulevard" is in the exhibit, says, 
"Corporate America is very insecure with images. I'm breaking into corporate 
collections with narrative pieces that tell a story, which makes the art 
controversial. In this way, the mainstream is coming to Hispanic art, and not 
the other way around." 
</P>
<P>
In the context of this exhibition, however, Fox said, "There is no way to 
identify a mainstream within the art world, any more than it is possible to 
identify a mainstream culture." 
</P>
<P>
Gronk, a Los Angeles Chicano artist who uses only one name, said, "Chicano art 
is part of the American culture, and it goes unrecognized in the United States. 
I'm out to break the stereotypes of what it is that we Latinos are supposed to 
be like. In its diversity, this exhibition communicates that visually. 
</P>
<P>
"A contemporary plastic artist is a visual philosopher for our time," added the 
artist, whose works are part of the exhibition. "This show is a success because 
it brought this point to the attention of a lot of people in the United 
States." 
</P>
<P>
Another artist, Texas-born Carmen Lomas Garza, considers herself a curandera, a 
healer. "I want to depict in a fine art form all those aspects of my culture 
that are positive and important for others to see and gain an understanding of 
who I am as a Chicano artist," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Through one of her paintings, the "Curandera," she attempts to convey a special 
message. "In South Texas, we'd all go to medical doctors to get prescriptions 
for drugs. But we'd go to the curandera for the final cleansing. It is a 
spiritual cleansing. A healing. 
</P>
<P>
"Artistically, I have tried to heal myself and other Chicanos and Latinos from 
the damage that was done to us in the form of discrimination and oppression," 
she said. "I continue the tradition of making home altars honoring the Day of 
the Dead. I paint scenes depicting family customs. My art work shows the 
dignity of my humanness." 
</P>
<P>
The 145 paintings, sculptures and assemblages in the exhibition portray 
survival, anxiety and hope; confusion, identity, anger and love. These are all 
expressions of deep-seated feelings, convictions, struggles and emotions that 
reflect Latino life in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Diversity is also present in the materials and techniques employed by these 
artists. Among the artists, John Valadez, a Chicano muralist and a colorful 
urban painter, displays "La Butterfly," a realistic reflection of Chicano 
street scenes in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Gonzalez's oil paintings draw from landscape imagery of her native 
Colombia. Felix Lopez and Luis Tapia, both from the Southwest, make brightly 
colored religious wood carvings known traditionally as santos. Gregorio Marzan 
of Puerto Rico constructs mixed-media animal figures in vivid colors. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Jimenez of El Paso works on painted animal sculptures and human figures on 
painted fiberglass. Californian Manuel Neri's sculptures involve the human 
figure with rough surfaces. Robert Graham, who was born in Mexico City and is 
best known for his 1984 Olympic bronze statues, stands out as the most 
realistic sculptor of this group. 
</P>
<P>
The first thing that strikes the attention of a viewer at the entrance to the 
show is Lujan's elaborately decorated 1950 Chevy. Lujan two-door sedan features 
a "flaming jalapeno paint job" in the front and a Chicano couple along the 
side. "Our Family Car," Lujan said, is symbolic of "the social dynamics, an 
entire culture built around cars." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the artists believe that this tour will be looked upon as a turning 
point of art in the United States. In the future, Gronk said, "labels, such as 
Hispanic, will fall on the wayside. People will see that this is American art."

ELECTION LEAVES LATINOS WITH CHALLENGES IN 1989 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Normally, a presidential election year like 1988 is followed by a respite from 
politics. Activists of all political parties are tired from the arduous 
campaign just completed, and they need some time to rest and recuperate. 
</P>
<P>
But Latino political activists don't have that luxury in 1989. For a variety of 
reasons, Latinos from Southern California to Washington are going to be busy 
all year keeping tabs on political developments. 
</P>
<P>
On the national level there is a great deal of interest in how President Bush 
will respond to expectations among Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
A former Texas resident with many business connections in Mexico, Bush made a 
strong appeal for Latino voter support in the campaign. His most visible 
campaigners were his son, Jeb, and his Mexican-born wife, Columba. But Bush 
also had help from several Latinos in campaign staff positions. 
</P>
<P>
The President is off to a good start, having named two Latinos to his Cabinet. 
He reappointed Ronald Reagan's last secretary of education, Lauro F. Cavazos of 
Texas, and he selected former U.S. Rep. Manuel Lujan of New Mexico to be his 
secretary of interior. But while both men are sure to be sources of pride to 
most Latinos, they could face rough going in their highly visible jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Cavazos must persuade the President to spend more federal money on education, 
despite a large budget deficit left by Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
The political tensions that Cavazos' appeals for more money have generated are 
already in the open. Some Republican conservatives say Cavazos, a Democrat, is 
too liberal. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan could have difficulty trying to strike a balance between the 
environmentalists who want to protect the federal lands and forests controlled 
by the Interior Department, and the businessmen, loggers and ranchers (many 
from the West) who want access to those valuable properties. 
</P>
<P>
Here in California, Latinos in both major parties are going to be involved in 
the early maneuvering among candidates who plan to run for governor in 1990. 
The campaign is beginning so early because Gov. George Deukmejian has already 
announced that he will not seek reelection, and a wide-open governor's race is 
likely to attract many candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, Latino activists will be busy, not in a political campaign, but in the 
courts. They will be monitoring the progress of a lawsuit that will affect the 
five seats on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Filed against the county by the U.S. Justice Department and the Mexican 
American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, among others, it aims to force the 
county to create a new supervisor district -- one in which a Latino might be 
elected. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Latinos have become increasingly restive with the fact that while 
one of every three people in the county is Latino, all five supervisors are 
white men. They want a Latino voice on the powerful board, and look to 
Supervisor Gaddi Vasquez in neighboring Orange County as a model. 
</P>
<P>
But county officials have vowed to fight the lawsuit to the bitter end, so it 
could be some time before a Latino sits on the county board. Should the county 
give in on the lawsuit and create a new district, some of the prominent Latinos 
being talked about as possible candidates include Los Angeles City Council 
members Richard Alatorre and Gloria Molina, state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los 
Angeles) and Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente). 
</P>
<P>
While it may not be as dramatic as all the political maneuvering, perhaps the 
most important political effort that will start up in 1989 is the effort by 
MALDEF and other Latino advocacy groups to help the U.S. Census Bureau get a 
more accurate count of Latinos when the national census is taken in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Many Latinos, especially those who are recent immigrants, tend to shy away from 
census takers and other government officials, but cooperation with the 1990 
census is going to be vitally important for the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
An accurate count of the population will make it easier for Latinos to push for 
more political representation. The larger our population, the more it is likely 
that new Latino-majority legislative districts can be drawn at all levels of 
government. Such districts could elect many new Latino political leaders in the 
1990s, especially if the many Latino immigrants who applied for amnesty under 
the 1986 Immigration Reform Act become citizens and start exercising the right 
to vote. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the 1990 census issue illustrates the one overriding reason why Latino 
activists can't afford to take a break from politics in 1989: For all the 
progress Latinos have made in recent years, we are still behind where we should 
be, given our fast-growing population. We will begin to catch up when we are 
accurately counted -- and then put our numbers to work by fully participating 
in the civic life of this nation.

RECKLESS ACT SENDS LAWYER ON A CRUSADE FOR IMPROVED SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It was just past 11 a.m. on Day 5 of the Wittmans' Colorado ski vacation, and 
the Poway family was in fine spirits. Avid, experienced skiers, Steve and Sandy 
Wittman and their sons, Scott and Russell, were poised high on the slopes of 
Steamboat Springs, debating which hill to tackle next, when it happened. 
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly, out of the corner of my eye, I saw this object coming at us at about 
50 m.p.h. -- airborne, like a bat out of hell," recalled Steve Wittman, a 
lawyer once active in San Diego politics. "I yelled, 'Russell! Watch out!' But 
it was too late." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Terrible Thud' 
</P>
<P>
A split-second later, 38-year-old skier Terrence Coghlan plowed into young 
Russell, landing on the boy's right leg, just above the boot. There was a 
terrible thud, a horrifying scrape of metal. The major bones in Russell's leg 
were shattered, and Coghlan's pole punctured the limb, leaving a deep gash 
requiring 12 stitches. 
</P>
<P>
The family's horrifying Feb. 24 ordeal has sparked a surprising flurry of 
events that Steve Wittman, for one, hopes will reduce the risk of such 
tragedies to skiing enthusiasts throughout the West. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the district attorney in Grand County, Colo., filed felony charges 
against Coghlan in connection with the mountain collision. That case and a 
second one brought this week after the death of an Iowa girl at another 
Colorado resort are believed to be the first of their kind. 
</P>
<P>
Two Colorado state lawmakers, meanwhile, have tentatively pledged to sponsor 
legislation requiring ski resorts to report serious-injury accidents on their 
slopes to law-enforcement authorities, who would decide whether to press 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
And associations representing Steamboat Springs-area deputy sheriffs and 
district attorneys -- who have long been irked that reckless skiers are rarely 
held accountable for their actions -- plan to push for legislation to tighten 
skier safety laws. 
</P>
<P>
At the eye of this storm is Wittman, an energetic, 42-year-old business and tax 
lawyer. A former San Diego City Council aide who lost an election against Mike 
Gotch in 1979, Wittman acknowledges being "something of a crusader" on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my first real cause," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The obvious impetus was his son's injuries: "It's the kind of experience that's 
devastating for any parent," Wittman said in an interview Wednesday. "We all 
thought my son was killed, frankly." 
</P>
<P>
The family's shock deepened when they learned that 11-year-old Kari Meylor had 
been struck and killed by another skier at Winter Park, Colo., a resort near 
Steamboat Springs. Prosecutors have filed felony manslaughter charges in that 
case, and Wittman said news of the death strengthened his resolve to rein in 
irresponsible skiers. 
</P>
<P>
But Wittman said he was also spurred by the countless "war stories" he heard 
from others who had either been struck or experienced close calls. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone from the pharmacist who gave us pain pills for Russell to taxi 
drivers and doctors said they had been through something like this," Wittman 
said. "I really started to wonder why something hadn't been done to protect 
people from these crazies." 
</P>
<P>
Wittman soon concluded that, despite signs on ski slopes warning that reckless 
skiing will result in confiscation of a lift ticket, resort operators do very 
little to prevent accidents. Though surveys by ski associations show a decline 
in injuries on the slopes, Wittman believes the danger has grown as crowds have 
increased. Resort operators, he argues, have failed to respond. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is there are guys like this Coghlan character causing problems all 
over the slopes, but if anybody reports anything, it ends up in a file and the 
police never find out about it," Wittman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Letters Sent to Key People 
</P>
<P>
Concerned about their image, "resorts discourage reporting of any accidents and 
try to convince people everything's beautiful and blissful on the mountain," he 
said. "They figure those people who get hurt will just go . . . home and lick 
their wounds." 
</P>
<P>
Wittman was not about to do that. After returning to Poway, he began firing off 
letters to resorts, legislators and consumer groups, demanding that something 
be done. Once Coghlan's criminal case is settled -- he faces a stiff prison 
term if convicted of felony charges of second-degree assault and child abuse 
and a misdemeanor charge of reckless endangerment -- Wittman plans to file a 
civil lawsuit against him. 
</P>
<P>
"I figure I owe it to my son," said Wittman, noting that Coghlan, a Steamboat 
Springs resident, has "shown no remorse and has never apologized to my son." 
</P>
<P>
Russell, meanwhile, hopes to return to third grade at Painted Rock Elementary 
School in Poway next week, but he still suffers nightmares and frequent pain. 
He may need surgery to repair his leg. 
</P>
<P>
As for skiing, the boy is not exactly pining for powder. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a great skier, but right now he's very frightened, and he doesn't 
understand how he could have been hit while just standing there," said Wittman, 
who spends several weeks each winter on the slopes. 
</P>
<P>
"After this, I know I'm going to look uphill a lot more than I used to." 
</P>

2 MORE TEENS SURRENDER IN SERIES OF FIRES SET AT ESCONDIDO SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By NANCY RAY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<P>
Two more Escondido teen-agers have surrendered to police in connection with 
four school fires that caused more than $1 million in damage at three Escondido 
schools within the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Parents of a 16-year-old Valley Continuation High School student surrendered 
their daughter to police Monday night. The girl has been taken to Juvenile Hall 
in San Diego, where she is being held on suspicion of involvement in two fires 
set Saturday night at Del Dios Middle School and Orange Glen High School. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a fourth arson suspect, a 17-year-old boy also from Valley High, a 
school for problem students, was taken to police headquarters by his parents. 
He is implicated in a March 10 fire and burglary at an Escondido High School 
trailer only, according to Lt. Earl Callander, Escondido police spokesman. He 
said the parents of the youths were contacted by police and told to take them 
to the Escondido police station. 
</P>
<P>
Two other teen-age boys were arrested at their homes by police Monday and will 
be charged with three felony arson counts in three school fires that occurred 
within three hours last Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Callander said the two original suspects, who are scheduled for hearings in 
Juvenile Court today, may face more counts in connection with the March 10 
burglary and fire at an Escondido High outbuilding. Damages in the earlier fire 
first were estimated at $15,000 and later revised to $55,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Escondido police detective would not comment on the source of the 
information that led to the arrests of the latest two suspects Monday night and 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Callander also refused to comment on whether other suspects are being sought in 
the school arsons that destroyed the theater arts part of the Escondido High 
multipurpose room and damaged other areas of the building, as well as gutting 
three classrooms and damaging others at Orange Glen High and damaging a 
portable classroom at Del Dios Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been generally established that boredom was the main motive for the 
three fires last Saturday," Callander said. The March 10 fire, he said, 
involved a burglary and has been linked by physical evidence with the fires set 
at the three schools last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, students and faculty at Escondido High won quick approval Wednesday 
from the Escondido City Council to use the new City Hall to stage a black-tie 
gala May 23 to climax a fund-raising effort for restoration of the dramatic 
arts facility at the school. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 dramatic arts students from the school, led by John L. Cooper, 
district superintendent, and Escondido High staff members Donna McArdle and 
Jane Rattmann, told council members that planning for the "rise from the ashes" 
drive began before embers cooled from the Saturday night fire that did more 
than $750,000 damage to the combined cafeteria and theater arts building. 
</P>
<P>
Offers of aid have come from all segments of the Escondido community, from 
Lawrence Welk Village, from the community's sister city of Vista and elsewhere, 
McArdle said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ashes for Sale 
</P>
<P>
The fund raising will start April 18 and will include sale of the ashes from 
the destroyed multipurpose building, an idea that came from restoration drives 
after the Mt. St. Helens disaster, McArdle said. (Entrepreneurs sold ash after 
the Mt. St. Helens volcano erupted in Oregon several years ago.) 
</P>
<P>
Offers of talent donations for the fund-raiser, including a North County group, 
are being gratefully accepted, McArdle said, "but the night belongs to the 
students who are behind this whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
May 23 was chosen for the final fund-raiser because it is the 60th anniversary 
of the fire in l929 that destroyed an earlier Escondido high school. At that 
time, there were 52 students in the school, McArdle said. Now there are more 
than 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said the fire damage at the two high schools is covered by the 
district's insurance, but that there is a $10,000 deductible amount on each 
fire plus the cost of replacing some of the contents that were not covered by 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
The aim of the student effort is to completely restore the theater arts program 
and facilities at Escondido High, he said.

REPORT PROMPTS CALL FOR CIVILIAN REVIEW OF SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A stinging report from the San Diego County Grand Jury documenting assaults of 
jail inmates by deputies has sparked calls for the creation of a civilian 
review board to monitor the County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Butler, one of the inmates allegedly beaten in the County Jail in Vista, 
said he appeared before the Grand Jury on Wednesday and repeated the call for a 
review board. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Human Weaknesses' 
</P>
<P>
"I told them that, because of human weaknesses, it is necessary to have checks 
and balances with a police review board," he said. "And I told them that, if we 
don't have that, then power will continue to corrupt and we will have a police 
state." 
</P>
<P>
The Grand Jury report, released Tuesday, lambasted the Sheriff's Department for 
its operation of the six county jails. 
</P>
<P>
The panel found that inmates were frequently assaulted by deputies, that 
internal cover-ups were conducted to conceal those activities and that Sheriff 
John Duffy and his top leaders did not assert adequate leadership to 
investigate the allegations and stop the abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Using the El Cajon jail as an example, the Grand Jury said a "Rambo Squad" of 
deputies roamed the jail and routinely assaulted and harassed inmates in 
conduct that was "totally reprehensible and inexcusable." 
</P>
<P>
Duffy has been out of town this week and unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
His spokesman, Lt. Alan Fulmer, said the sheriff will hold a press conference 
soon to address the concerns in the 20-page report. 
</P>
<P>
On the issue of a civilian review board for the department, Duffy has in the 
past said he is opposed to allowing his staff to be scrutinized by any 
outsiders. Instead, he has defended his in-house Internal Affairs Division as a 
capable unit for investigating misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Grand Jury did not call for an independent civilian review board, 
the panel's report did conclude that the Internal Affairs Division is woefully 
understaffed and unable to properly ferret out misbehavior by deputies. 
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the sheriff's Internal Affairs Division has one 
lieutenant and three sergeants for a department of 1,200 deputies, whereas the 
San Diego Police Department's counterpart has two lieutenants and 12 sergeants 
for a force of 1,700 officers. 
</P>
<P>
The report also noted that the sheriff's unit recently had a 50% increase in 
its caseload. And, the report added, "the backlog is building." 
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, the issue of civilian review has dogged the San Diego 
Police Department. One panel was created but then sharply criticized for being 
weak and ineffective. Now, officials are attempting to determine whether one or 
both of the two new proposals for a city review board should be carried out, as 
approved by voters in November. 
</P>
<P>
John Crew, director of the Police Practices Project for the ACLU in Northern 
California, said that, though review boards are increasingly being established 
to oversee local police procedures in the state, he knows of no panels to 
monitor deputies in jail settings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Reasons Why 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
"In the jail, it's a closed society," he said. "And the complainants are often 
considered less credible because they are inmates. 
</P>
<P>
"And misconduct is difficult to prove when you're dealing with people 
incarcerated in jail. Witnesses will be less likely to speak up. And there is a 
built-in bias against people who are incarcerated." 
</P>
<P>
For a review board monitoring jail activities to be successful, he said, the 
panel must be granted subpoena powers. It should also hold open public 
hearings, make final decisions on misconduct and decide whether discipline is 
warranted for errant officers. 
</P>
<P>
Crew discounted common complaints by peace officers who argue that review 
boards are no good because civilians cannot be properly trained to study police 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
"Come on," he said. "This is not brain surgery. Civilians already make 
decisions about water bonds and streets and sewers. So why should a police 
agency be an exclusion from democracy?" 
</P>
<P>
Michael Crowley, a San Diego attorney, helped set up a special telephone hot 
line for victims of jail abuse after the allegations began surfacing. And he 
said many of the victims who called the hot line have expressed frustrations 
because they feel as though no independent watchdog has monitored the Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
"We have every indication that the abuse is continuing and has been non-stop," 
he said. "And now, we are demanding that, based on the Grand Jury's report, a 
review board be established." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lack of Charges Noted 
</P>
<P>
Tom Adler, another lawyer who has represented inmates allegedly beaten by 
deputies, said the frustrations have deepened because federal and state 
prosecutors have refused to file criminal charges against deputies. 
</P>
<P>
"No one has been watching what's been happening in those jails," he said. "A 
handful of lawyers have filed lawsuits over brutality cases. Occasionally, the 
Grand Jury issues a report like this. But other than that, the U. S. attorney 
has turned his back on the problem, and the county district attorney doesn't 
want to get involved.

JEWISH COUNCIL SUED BY RABBI'S FOLLOWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Followers of the ultra right-wing Israeli Rabbi Meir Kahane are suing the 
Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles, contending they were 
wrongfully excluded from two upcoming Jewish festivals. 
</P>
<P>
Kach International, which says its members look to Kahane as a spiritual 
leader, contends that it was improperly denied permission to set up booths at 
Jewish festivals scheduled at Pierce Community College in Woodland Hills on 
April 9 and Rancho Park in West Los Angeles on June 4. 
</P>
<P>
Kahane, an American who emigrated to Israel, is a leader of the radical Kach 
Party, which advocates expulsion of Arabs from Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The federation excluded Kach International because it represents an unpopular 
point of view, said Barry Fisher, an attorney for Kach International. But 
federation spokesman Ron Rieder said the organization has the right to keep 
politics out of its festivals.

HIT-RUN KILLS ILLEGAL ALIEN NEAR BORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unidentified man was killed Tuesday night in a hit-and-run accident as he 
attempted to run across Interstate 5 near the U.S.-Mexican border, marking what 
CHP officials say is the eighth illegal alien killed this year trying to cross 
a San Diego freeway. 
</P>
<P>
A coroner's spokesman said the man, believed to be in his 20s, suffered 
multiple injuries and was found dead about 8 p.m. after being struck in the far 
left lane of southbound Interstate 5 about a quarter of a mile south of Dairy 
Mart Road. He said there were skid marks leading up to the body. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wearing Black Clothes 
</P>
<P>
California Highway Patrol investigators said Wednesday there were no witnesses. 
The man was wearing black jeans, a black leather jacket and white, high-top 
tennis shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Since Jan. 1, 1985, 72 undocumented aliens have been killed while trying to 
cross Interstate 805, Interstate 5 and nearby roadways. About 39% of those 
cases involved a hit-and-run driver, according to CHP statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all of the fatalities -- 98% were of Mexican nationals, the rest 
Central Americans -- have occurred within 5 miles of the border, and 60% of 
them occurred in northbound lanes. 
</P>
<P>
About 62% of those illegal aliens killed while crossing San Diego freeways 
since 1985 have been 21 to 30 years old, according to CHP statistics. Most of 
the rest have been from 31 to 40. 
</P>
<P>
The carnage on the freeways has attracted growing public attention and has 
prompted authorities to take action. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Move Begun to Cut Danger 
</P>
<P>
In the first step of what state officials say is a multipronged effort to 
reduce the growing traffic hazard to illegal-alien pedestrians, a flashing sign 
-- warning "Watch for People Crossing Road" -- was posted earlier this year 
along the grid of freeways just north of the border. 
</P>
<P>
State transportation officials have also begun trimming back bushes along the 
freeways where illegal aliens hide while waiting for a chance to cross. State 
officials are also providing U. S. Customs agents at the border crossing with 
handouts that warn northbound motorists to "watch out for pedestrians who may 
be illegally crossing the freeways for the next 5 miles."

SCRIPPS SHIP COULD BE FREED BY WEEKEND; LIABILITY NOT AN ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN FAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Scripps Institution of Oceanography research ship, seized this week by the U. 
S. Customs Service in Honolulu after 4.5 grams of marijuana was allegedly found 
on board, may be on its way by Saturday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Customs authorities and Scripps administrators continued discussions over the 
release of the ship, which is owned by the Navy but operated by Scripps, 
including an initial demand by Customs that the research institution admit 
"full guilt in this matter," according to Tom Collins, associate director for 
administration at Scripps. 
</P>
<P>
But by Wednesday afternoon, Collins said it appeared that the boat would be 
released in time for a scheduled research trip. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Never a Question of Guilt 
</P>
<P>
Customs officials said there was never a question of guilt on Scripps' part and 
the institution will not be held liable. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the ship would be released by Saturday, Customs spokesman Art 
Morgan said: "I can't speculate on that. . . . The U.S. Customs Service is 
doing whatever it can to expedite the process." 
</P>
<P>
The research vessel Thomas Washington was seized in Honolulu on Monday after 
federal agents using drug-sniffing dogs said they found a small amount of 
marijuana hidden in the berth of Kenneth G. Racca Jr., 28, of San Diego, who 
works as a wiper on the ship. The seizure was conducted under the government's 
controversial "zero tolerance" anti-drug campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Collins said the ship was in "constructive seizure," a process in which the 
Customs Service allows the seized property to remain in use and in the custody 
of the owner or operator. 
</P>
<P>
"They have softened their position somewhat," Collins said. "The status is now 
that they're talking about this constructive-seizure arrangement, which really 
means we'll be able to take our ship and do our cruise. We have been assured 
that we are not admitting guilt to anything." 
</P>
<P>
But Morgan, who is assistant district director for the Customs Service in 
Honolulu, would not confirm that the ship was in the constructive-seizure 
process. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Study of Greenhouse Effect 
</P>
<P>
The boat is scheduled to leave Honolulu on Saturday with a team of scientists 
for a 30-day trip to study carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect in the 
mid-Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Collins said that so far, the delay has cost Scripps, which is part of UC San 
Diego, about $20,000 in legal counsel expenses and staff overtime. If the ship 
is delayed beyond Saturday, costs of keeping the crew and the scientific team 
waiting could increase to $15,000 a day, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the boat is in an "administrative petition process" that will give 
the ship's crew an opportunity to tell their side of the story in writing, 
without having to go through court proceedings, Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
Racca is scheduled to be arraigned today in connection with one charge each of 
importation and possession of a controlled substance. A court spokeswoman has 
told the Associated Press that Racca will probably be fined and released. 
</P>
<P>
Collins would not discuss whether Scripps would take any action against Racca. 
</P>
<P>
"He will be dealt with fairly within university policy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Separate Processes 
</P>
<P>
Morgan said the seizure of the ship and the charges facing Racca were two 
separate processes. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Racca is involved in a court case, and a ship's seizure is in an 
administrative process. One does not necessarily hold up the other. They're 
independent of each other." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) said he was disappointed in the action taken by 
Customs and criticized the zero-tolerance policy as cosmetic. 
</P>
<P>
"It's image over substance. . . . It doesn't work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) said that, though the search was 
necessary, "There needs to be some flexibility on what punishment should be 
inflicted on the boat owner when he's done everything possible" to ensure that 
there are no drugs on board. 
</P>
<P>
"By law, the (Customs Service) has to at least react," said Wilson aide Bill 
Livingstone. "Our concern is that the procedure ought to be reasonable. . . . 
Is a fine even necessary at this point? The skipper appears to be trying to 
comply with the law." 
</P>
<P>
Collins said Scripps paid a company that used dogs to check the ship for drugs 
when it was in San Francisco last June. In addition, all crew members signed a 
statement acknowledging the institution's anti-drug policy and promising to 
abide by it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Were Shocked' 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we've gone to extraordinary lengths to ensure that this kind of thing 
wouldn't happen," Collins said. "When we found out, we were shocked." 
</P>
<P>
The Thomas Washington, Collins said, had just returned from Pago Pago in 
American Samoa. 
</P>
<P>
The government last year relaxed its zero-tolerance policy for commercial 
fishing vessels so as not to place "undue hardship" on innocent owners who 
might be unaware of the actions of their crew.

WOMEN'S DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In your description of a speech by Raisa Gorbachev, you refer to International 
Women's Day as a Soviet holiday (Part I, March 8). Given that the whole month 
of March is designated National Women's History Month across the U.S., I think 
your readers deserve a clarification about the origin of International Women's 
Day, particularly since the holiday originated in this country. 
</P>
<P>
The holiday, which is observed all over the world, commemorates a March 8, 
1908, march of many thousands of young women and their supporters. Their 
demands were twofold -- women's right to vote, and an end to child labor in the 
sweatshops of New York City's garment district. The march took place in New 
York City.

DEATH OF WRITER EDWARD ABBEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was very sad to read in your paper that author Edward Abbey ("Thoreau of the 
American West") had died (Part I, March 16). In your detailed obituary, I was 
astonished that no mention was made of his book, "The Brave Cowboy." 
</P>
<P>
I came across a paperback edition of this book around 1960, and was deeply 
moved. I bought the movie rights and finally persuaded Universal to allow my 
company, Bryna, to make the film, which was brilliantly written by Dalton 
Trumbo and produced by Eddie Lewis. In the cast with me were Gena Rowlands, 
Walter Matthau, and William Shatner, and introducing Carroll O'Connor in a 
small role. They all gave marvelous performances. 
</P>
<P>
In the opening scene, I played Jack Burns (Edward Abbey), who rides across a 
wide plain and comes up to a large wire fence. I get off my horse, taking a 
pair of pliers, cut the fence and ride on. In your article you quote Abbey: "I 
am the one who loved un-fenced countries." 
</P>
<P>
I never met Mr. Abbey, but we wrote to each other several times. I apologized 
to him that the studio insisted on changing the title of "Brave Cowboy" to 
"Lonely Are the Brave." 
</P>
<P>
In the more than 80 films that I've made, this is my favorite. I am very 
pleased when I get a letter, or someone comes up to me saying it is also their 
favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood was capable of transferring the feelings of this great 
environmentalist to film. People will always be able to see as well as read the 
beliefs of this great man in "Lonely Are the Brave."

DEATH OF WRITER EDWARD ABBEY

<TEXT>
<P>
It was with great sadness that I learned of the death of author Edward Abbey. I 
will not be able to think of the arid beauty of northern Arizona or Utah's 
Canyonlands without his writings coming to mind. 
</P>
<P>
I hope that his publishers will release the draft of his last novel. A sequel 
to "The Monkey Wrench Gang" will be welcomed with open arms. 
</P>
<P>
Thank you, Mr. Abbey, for your thought-provoking plots and rich characters that 
will continue to defend the red rock country from the fences and pavement of 
land developers, and rest assured that Hayduke lives!

TEEN RECOGNITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year the media have focused on gang activity in the 
region. Every day we read and hear about another youth dying in our streets. 
The daily reports have made the average citizen numb to the grief and horror. 
However, I have not written this letter to criticize the media but to show 
positive progress within their reports of despair. 
</P>
<P>
I am a teacher at Pater Noster High School, a small Archdiocese high school in 
northeast Los Angeles. My students took steps towards eliminating gang 
violations recently. Sixteen seniors took weapons of paint and brushes into the 
community to cover gang slogans and remarks. 
</P>
<P>
The community has been elated with this push coming from our school. The 
seniors have agreed to work with the Northeast Field Patrol Division of the Los 
Angeles Police Department to paint over graffiti on walls throughout the 
community. My students are hoping this action will prompt other high schools in 
the area to pick up the brush and do the same. 
</P>
<P>
I am very proud of these students, not because I know them (that is an honor in 
itself), but that they organized and developed this themselves. I think that 
when students take this type of action they deserve more media recognition than 
the gangs. After all, these are the type of students we will look to as our 
future leaders.

DRACONIAN STEP ON FAMILY PLANNING; 
</P>
<P>
BY ELIMINATING OFFICE, GOVERNOR WOULD DENY CARE TO NEEDIEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

for Women, a nonprofit community clinic in Los Angeles' Crenshaw district.

<P>
Few social or political issues have inspired more divisiveness in recent years 
than those involving reproductive rights. Despite the raging controversy, 
however, broad consensus has developed on at least one crucial point: 
Intelligent family planning improves the quality of individual lives and 
strengthens the social fabric. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing those clear benefits, then-Gov. Ronald Reagan in 1971 approved a 
bill adding family planning services to California's maternal and child-health 
program. Before 1971, the needs of large numbers of people, especially 
teen-agers, were not being met. 
</P>
<P>
With the establishment of the state Office of Family Planning in 1973, 
low-income women and men were offered family planning services without regard 
to age or marital status. Birth-control techniques, cervical and breast cancer 
detection, diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, HIV (AIDS) 
testing and a range of other counseling and referral services have been 
provided on an ability-to-pay basis. (Family-planning funds are not used for 
abortions, nor do they subsidize abortion services.) 
</P>
<P>
Through its education program, state-funded family-planning agencies help 
low-income teen-agers and their parents learn about reproductive health care. 
This educational campaign is vital in a state where unplanned parenthood among 
adolescents accounts for 80% of female high school dropouts and 40% of male 
dropouts, and where one in every five births to a teen-ager is a second child. 
A UC San Francisco study recently estimated that California's one-year public 
cost for women who had their first children while still in their teens was 
$3.08 billion. Had these births been delayed until the mother was 20 years old, 
40%, or $1.23 billion, could have been saved. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, approximately 500,000 low-income Californians received 
family-planning services through agencies funded by the state Office of Family 
Planning. Nearly one-third were teens. Another report from UC San Francisco 
estimates that for every dollar spent on family planning, California taxpayers 
saved $6.60 in additional health and social services. 
</P>
<P>
Now Gov. George Deukmejian proposes abolishing the state Office of Family 
Planning. His 1990 budget includes draconian cuts in various health and welfare 
programs. The plan for family planning is not just a cut, but total 
elimination. And leaving no doubt about his intentions, the governor has 
already served notice on the Legislature that, should it fail to go along with 
his proposal, he will use his line-item veto to reduce the allocation for 
family planning by two-thirds. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's apparent rationale is that family-planning agencies are 
receiving an influx of new federal grants resulting from the Immigration Reform 
Control Act (IRCA) of 1986. Also, funds from the new cigarette and tobacco tax 
initiative (Proposition 99) supposedly will generate additional revenues for 
local health care. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, neither of these sources can replace the state appropriation for 
family planning. Proposition 99 revenues are not legislated to go to community 
health clinics, where one-third of family- planning services are rendered. 
Immigration assistance funds are specifically earmarked for amnesty-eligible 
immigrants and cannot be used to serve others. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the state legislative analyst has pointed out that the governor's 
estimates for immigration funds coming into California may be unrealistic, and 
the program itself is only geared to last until 1992. What funds will cover 
newly legalized applicants then? What funds will cover the rest of the 
low-income population who require family planning now? 
</P>
<P>
Even with state funding at its current level, clinics and other health 
providers are able to reach only half of the low-income women in California 
eligible to receive birth-control services. The governor's action seriously 
jeopardizes the health of these women. It also threatens to destroy a fragile 
infrastructure of family-planning providers in the state. After decades of 
cost-effective health delivery to California's neediest citizens, many local 
clinics and other facilities that depend on state funding to serve their 
communities may have to close their doors forever. 
</P>
<P>
The timing of the governor's proposal is especially ominous. Just this month, 
the March of Dimes issued a report identifying the rate of infant mortality for 
blacks in Los Angeles County as the highest in the nation. Another study, 
conducted by researchers at UCLA and USC, found that rates of cervical cancer 
for black women and Latinas in the county are 50% higher than for white women. 
The prenatal care and cancer screening necessary to reverse such horrific 
statistics are among the central services that community clinics provide. 
</P>
<P>
Few constituencies have less political clout than those served by local 
family-planning agencies. Minorities, immigrants, low-income women -- these are 
the groups who will suffer most if the state Office of Family Planning is no 
longer available to address their needs. Maybe that is why the governor feels 
he can abolish it with a stroke of the pen. If he succeeds, however, he will 
also be abolishing a primary line of defense in the battle to control disease, 
break the cycle of poverty and ensure a healthier future for all Californians.

CLINICS GIRD FOR ABORTION PROTESTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anxiety is often written on the faces of women seeking abortions or other 
services at the Planned Parenthood Clinic in Sherman Oaks. And the clinic's 
staff of more than 20 does its best to soothe. 
</P>
<P>
But as a citywide anti-abortion protest neared, it was clinic staff members who 
needed reassurance and advice. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all anxious," Stephanie Alexander, Planned Parenthood's director of 
clinical programs, said Wednesday. "We've never dealt with something of this 
magnitude." 
</P>
<P>
Operation Rescue is a small but highly visible group of anti-abortion 
activists. Its members have shut down clinics in other cities by staging 
sit-ins and getting arrested. Operation Rescue has estimated that as many as 
2,100 protesters nationwide will participate in three days of demonstrations 
scheduled to begin today. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Secret Plans 
</P>
<P>
The Sherman Oaks Planned Parenthood clinic, potentially a target for those 
protests, is one of the busiest in Los Angeles, seeing more than 20,000 women a 
year -- more than 50 a day. Operation Rescue is keeping its plans secret, and 
Los Angeles police said the clinic in the 14100 block of Magnolia Boulevard is 
but one of as many as 17 in the San Fernando Valley that may be on the 
protesters' list. 
</P>
<P>
But the Sherman Oaks clinic is also the gathering point for several hundred 
pro-choice activists who will be dispatched to any clinic in the Valley that is 
the scene of a protest. Their aim will be to keep the clinics open. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander and other staff members said preparations for the anti-abortion 
protest have been extensive. 
</P>
<P>
They have included emergency drills to deal with bomb threats and intruders. 
Typical Operation Rescue tactics, which include crawling between staffers' legs 
to enter blockaded doors, have been discussed at staff meetings. And the clinic 
is no longer divulging by telephone when it schedules abortions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Degree of Confidence 
</P>
<P>
All of that has instilled a degree of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all anxious, but it's exciting in a way," Alexander said. "We've been 
preparing for this for so long that in some ways we'll be disappointed if we 
don't get hit." 
</P>
<P>
Undercutting that confidence at the Sherman Oaks clinic, as well as at eight 
other Los Angeles Planned Parenthood clinics that provide abortion services, 
has been a series of events that clinic workers believe that Operation Rescue, 
or the group's sympathizers, is behind. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander said women have been telephoning and asking clinic staff members 
unusual questions, aimed more at eliciting information about the clinic's 
policies and abortion schedule than about its services. 
</P>
<P>
Others have tried to bypass Planned Parenthood's required consultation and set 
up appointments for abortions, she said. And some women have shown up without 
appointments, looked around the clinic and then left, she said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Planned Parenthood clinic in Pomona, a woman who was not pregnant sought 
an abortion, expecting the clinic to agree to perform the operation without 
questioning the claim, Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
Operation Rescue members in other cities have used such tactics. 
</P>
<P>
"We're having to scrutinize everyone who comes through the door," Alexander 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the tension this week, hot tar being used to repair the clinic's roof 
ignited the roofing crew's truck and the clinic had to be closed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Staff members at other clinics are concerned as well. Representatives of 
clinics operated by Family Planning Associates in North Hollywood and 
Northridge refused to comment on any preparations for the protests. 
</P>
<P>
An administrative assistant at a clinic in Canoga Park, who asked not to be 
identified, said: "We've been totally unscathed so far, and that's the way we 
want to keep it. Every clinic that has the word woman in the title is a 
target." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Beliefs Reviewed 
</P>
<P>
Preparations for the protests have also caused some clinic workers to 
re-examine their beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
Colleen Hatzer, manager of the Planned Parenthood clinic in Canoga Park, which 
does not perform abortions, said she endorsed Operation Rescue's right to 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
"All we ask in return is that they . . . not deny anyone medical care," she 
said. "A protest which blocks access to health care . . . is a very selfish act 
and it is therefore sad."

TENANTS OF ILLEGAL UNITS MAY RECEIVE EVICTION FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Property owners who illegally convert garages or other portions of their 
buildings into rental units would have to pay up to $5,000 to tenants who must 
move because of substandard conditions under an ordinance approved Wednesday by 
the Los Angeles City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Tenants' rights attorneys praised the measure because it would require 
relocation assistance for renters who are evicted from illegal dwellings as the 
result of Building and Safety Department inspections. 
</P>
<P>
"This is literally going to help thousands of poor people who before today did 
not have any protection from evictions," said Mary Lou Villar, an attorney with 
the East Los Angeles Legal Aid Foundation. "Up until now, if you were kicked 
out of a garage, you were out on the street." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
4,500 in East Valley 
</P>
<P>
East San Fernando Valley Councilman Ernani Bernardi, who co-sponsored the 
ordinance with Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, estimated that there are about 
4,500 illegal garage dwellings in his district. He said the number is derived 
from an informal survey of Department of Building and Safety complaints in his 
district in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
"At least now these tenants will have a little money to get a start someplace 
else," Bernardi said. "Now we can penalize landlords for the benefit of those 
people whom they have been feeding on." 
</P>
<P>
City law requires landlords of legal dwellings to pay for tenant relocation 
when renters are evicted for extensive renovation or for repairs that have been 
ordered by the Department of Building and Safety. But a loophole in the law did 
not require property owners of illegal units to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
"The law has to apply equally to every landlord, whether it's an illegal unit 
or not," said Flores, who introduced the measure after learning about a 
Wilmington apartment owner who illegally converted a three-car garage into 
three apartments. 
</P>
<P>
"Now greedy landlords who don't care about humanity but only care about the 
almighty dollar are going to have to think twice before they rent out an 
illegal apartment," Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, passed on a 12-0 vote by the council, was sent to Mayor Tom 
Bradley for consideration. Bradley has not taken a position on the measure. 
</P>
<P>
It would largely affect homeowners who convert back-yard garages into 
apartments or build illegal additions to their homes, said Barbara Zeidman, 
director of the city's rent stabilization unit. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this very clearly says we are not going to turn our back and look the 
other way when it comes to illegal dwellings," Zeidman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neighbors Make Reports 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors commonly report such units to city building inspectors because the 
dwellings often pose sanitation and other hazards, such as poor plumbing, 
exposed wiring and bootlegged gas lines. 
</P>
<P>
Under the ordinance, renters who are disabled, 62 or older or have children 
would receive $5,000. Single adults would receive $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
A tenant who reports his landlord to building officials would be eligible to 
collect relocation assistance if inspectors ordered the tenant to vacate an 
illegal unit for safety reasons, according to Mel Bliss, chief of the Bureau of 
Community Safety. 
</P>
<P>
City officials and tenant attorneys did not express concern over this 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to attach a financial penalty to those who rent illegal units," 
Zeidman said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the number of illegal dwellings in Los Angeles is not known, a Los 
Angeles Times investigation in May, 1987, revealed that about 42,000 illegal 
garage dwellings shelter about 200,000 people throughout Los Angeles County. 
The garage homes, an outgrowth of the region's lack of affordable housing, lie 
in a swath of mostly low-income Latino neighborhoods from Sylmar through East 
Los Angeles into Long Beach, The Times study showed. 
</P>
<P>
Landlords usually collect between $200 and $400 a month for a garage dwelling, 
depending on the extent of improvements.

VINCENT CASE 1ST MAJOR TEST OF STATE CAMPAIGN FUND LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before the attorney general's office accused him this week of using campaign 
contributions for his personal benefit, Mayor Edward Vincent expressed 
disbelief at the official attention focused on his campaign spending. 
</P>
<P>
In several interviews, Vincent described his campaign fund as "my money." 
</P>
<P>
But under a 1981 state law, it's not his money to spend any way he wants. The 
law says campaign contributions must be used for political or governmental 
purposes, not personal benefit. 
</P>
<P>
The 1981 law does provide considerable leeway, experts said, and confusion 
sometimes arises -- among officeholders and even enforcement agencies -- over 
what constitutes personal use of campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
But they also said the conduct alleged in the attorney general's suit against 
Vincent illustrates the need for the legal barrier between personal and 
political funds that was established only after intense debate. The suit 
alleges that Vincent spent more than $5,000 on travel, truck repairs, clothes 
and a veterinarian's bill, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent has declined to comment since the suit was filed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Stern, head of the nonprofit California Commission on Campaign 
Financing, was a leader in the fight for passage of the personal-use 
prohibitions. In 1981, Stern said, outrage peaked over disclosures that 
politicians used campaign funds to pay for items such as divorce proceedings 
and video recorders. Some legislators even paid their campaign war chests to 
themselves when they left office, calling the transactions "retirement pay." 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to force a reluctant Legislature's hand, Tom Houston, then the 
chairman of the state Fair Political Practices Commission, proposed a new FPPC 
regulation barring personal uses of campaign funds, to be enforced by the state 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
Legislators balked. The compromise that emerged was a somewhat weaker bill that 
provided for enforcement by the state attorney general, Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
The law, Election Code Section 12401, prohibits campaign spending that creates 
a substantial personal benefit and "does not have more than a negligible 
political or legislative purpose." It provides a fine of $500, or twice the 
violation, whichever is greater. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tough to Prove 
</P>
<P>
Successful prosecution requires that an officeholder's misuse of funds be 
"willful and knowing," a standard that investigators describe as tough to 
prove. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the suit against Vincent marks the first prosecution of an elected 
official under the law. State officials are seeking fines from Vincent 
amounting to twice the more than $5,000 he allegedly misspent during the past 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
In commenting on the Vincent case, Stern noted that previous investigations 
have ended with politicians being allowed to repay their campaign war chests 
for questionable expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, most people comply with the law," Stern said. "Second of all, 
the law is fairly generous. And finally, I think, when people are close to the 
line, the attorney general has been forgiving." 
</P>
<P>
Given that history -- and the apparent reluctance of elected officials to 
prosecute other elected officials -- the attorney general's hard line on the 
Vincent case reflects what investigators termed systematic and clear-cut 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
"You are taking money out of the system that could be used for campaigns," 
Stern said. "The idea was that if you couldn't use the money for personal use, 
you wouldn't raise it. Whereas if you could do it, people would be out raising 
money all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Stern noted that elected officials must disqualify themselves from voting on 
issues involving individuals who have given them more than $250 in direct gifts 
or income. However, he said, officials do not have to disqualify themselves in 
the cases of campaign contributors, no matter how much is given. They only have 
to report the contribution on campaign disclosure forms if it is $100 or more. 
</P>
<P>
The suit against Vincent may help establish more concrete limits on how far 
elected officials can go, Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you bring an enforcement action," Stern said, "you send a signal to 
others."

ROBBER KILLS MAN AT TELLER MACHINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY,, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man was shot to death in a struggle with an armed robber moments after he 
made a withdrawal from an automatic teller machine at a Northridge savings and 
loan, Los Angeles police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Aflam Hafham, 29, of Canoga Park was fatally shot at 8:45 p.m. Tuesday in the 
Coast Savings parking lot at Nordhoff Street and Tampa Avenue, across from the 
Northridge Fashion Center shopping mall, said Detective Jack Dillard. 
</P>
<P>
Dillard said Hafham and two friends, whom he would not identify, drove into the 
parking lot, and Hafham got out of the car and walked to the automatic teller 
machine at the side of the bank building. 
</P>
<P>
After making a withdrawal from the machine, which is under an outdoor light and 
in view of Nordhoff, Hafham was stopped as he walked to his car by an armed man 
who demanded his money, Dillard said. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, another man approached Hafham's car, pointed a gun at Hafham's 
friends and demanded their wallets, Dillard said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Struggled With Robber 
</P>
<P>
Hafham struggled with the man robbing him and was shot twice in the upper body, 
police said. After Hafham was shot, his friends turned over their wallets to 
the two gunmen, who fled on foot, police said. The two friends were not 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
Hafham was taken to Northridge Hospital Medical Center, where he was pronounced 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
Police refused to say how much money was taken in the robbery. They said they 
did not have clear descriptions of the suspects but were attempting to 
determine if other ATM robberies may have been the work of the two gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been several others, but we don't know if they are related," 
Dillard said. 
</P>
<P>
Police would not say how many ATM robberies have occurred in the area in recent 
weeks, but one detective pointed out that the crimes are "very prevalent 
nowadays" because customers are easily accessible to robbers.

RECOUNT DOESN'T AFFECT RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A recount Wednesday by Redondo Beach election officials failed to change the 
outcome of the March 7 City Council contest in District 4, in which no 
candidate gained a majority. Candidates Valerie Dombrowski and Terry Ward will 
face each other in the May 16 runoff. 
</P>
<P>
The recount added one ballot to Dombrowski's column, leaving her with 468 votes 
-- still three short of the 50%-plus-one total that she needed to avoid the 
runoff and be declared the winner. Ward lost one vote in the new tally, and the 
total for the third candidate, Barry Ogle, remained the same. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Clerk Linda Gregory said Ward lost a vote when election officials 
discovered a miscount in one precinct's absentee ballots. They gave another 
vote to Dombrowski when the hand count turned up one ballot that had not been 
tallied by a computer March 7, possibly because a loose speck of paper had 
blocked a hole in the ballot card, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory said Dombrowski, who requested the recount, will be billed $180 to 
cover the costs. The races for mayor and for the District 2 council seat will 
also be decided in the May 16 runoff.

COUNCIL INCREASES AIRPORT FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Torrance City Council voted unanimously this week to increase by about 20% 
the rental fee to tie down a plane at the municipal airport. 
</P>
<P>
The increase, which was approved Tuesday night, will take effect May 1 and will 
raise the monthly rate from $65 to $80 for planes with a wing span of 30 to 40 
feet, and from $104 to $125 for wing spans of 40 to 50 feet. 
</P>

The recommendation came in January from David M. Griffith &amp; Associates, a 
Sacramento-based consulting firm. The 304 tie-downs at the Torrance Airport 
bring the city about $196,000 in revenue each year, according to city 
officials. The new rates are expected to increase annual revenue by $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
A staff report showed that the average tie-down rate charged at airports in 
Santa Monica, Long Beach, Van Nuys, El Monte, Hawthorne and Compton is $79 and 
$113, respectively, for the two types of aircraft. Van Nuys, owned by the City 
of Los Angeles, charges the most: $115 and $130, respectively.

FUNERAL FOR RETIRED PRINCIPAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Funeral services will be held at 9:30 a.m. today for Andrew Deliman, a retired 
Redondo Beach school principal. He was a candidate for the local school board 
earlier this month. The services, following a Rosary Wednesday night, are at 
St. James Catholic Church in Redondo Beach, with burial at Green Hills Memorial 
Park in Rancho Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
Deliman, 68, died, apparently of a heart attack, while playing golf Monday at 
Victoria Park in Carson. Howard Huizing, his friend and golfing partner of 
nearly 30 years -- and the school trustee to whom he lost his March 7 election 
bid by nine votes -- said Deliman collapsed without warning at the 16th hole. 
Helen Deliman said her husband had a heart condition, which had not prevented 
him from leading an active life in his retirement years. 
</P>
<P>
A Pennsylvania native, Deliman taught in Ohio and Hawaii before coming to the 
Redondo Beach City School District in 1956. He served the district for 29 
years, as principal of the Beryl Heights, Franklin, Patterson and Alta Vista 
elementary schools. He retired in 1985, and after some traveling, worked as a 
substitute teacher in the Torrance Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
"Andy's goal was to keep involved, especially in education, because he always 
loved to work with children and their parents and teachers," Helen Deliman 
said. "The election campaign, walking door-to-door, gave him a chance to meet 
many of his former pupils who are now of voting age." 
</P>
<P>
Besides his wife, Deliman is survived by his daughter, Janet, who lives in the 
family's Redondo Beach home, and two brothers, Albert of Tennessee and Edward 
of Pennsylvania.

MCGUIRE WINS COUNCIL SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jacqueline McGuire, 42, opponent of a group of longtime council members in 
Rolling Hills Estates, won a special council election Tuesday, defeating 
candidates who had adopted more conciliatory positions. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire won with 56.5% of the vote. Defeated were William Ailor, with 33.6%, 
and Robert Schacter, with 9.9%. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire, a special education teacher with the Palos Verdes Unified School 
District, supported the recall movement that ousted veteran Councilman Jerome 
Belsky in a recall election last November and created the vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
Endorsed by the leaders of the recall movement, McGuire campaigned by attacking 
the present council, which she said does not adequately represent residents, 
and the city administration, which she said is not responsive to residents 
requesting information. 
</P>
<P>
Elected to complete Belsky's term, McGuire said she intends to run in November 
for a full four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
Ailor, 44, an engineer with Aerospace Corp. in El Segundo, said during the 
campaign that he had no problem with council members. Endorsed by Belsky and 
Mayor Nell Mirels and Councilmen Hugh Muller and Warren Schwarzmann, Ailor had 
said he would work "within the system." 
</P>
<P>
The third-place finisher, Robert Schacter, 38, an attorney, said during the 
campaign that he would be willing to listen to all sides.

MAN KILLED BY TRAIN FLIRTED WITH DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who was struck and killed by a train in Reseda was apparently playing 
"chicken" on the railroad tracks and waited too long to jump to safety, Los 
Angeles police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Anthony Brown, 22, of Reseda was fatally injured about 10 p.m. Tuesday on 
the Southern Pacific tracks north of Roscoe Boulevard near White Oak Avenue, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police ruled the death accidental. Detective Sandra Palmer said Brown, who may 
have been intoxicated, was standing on the tracks and apparently attempted to 
jump to safety as the train went by. 
</P>
<P>
Brown managed to jump clear of the tracks but was hit by a handrail on the side 
of the train and knocked into a ditch, where he was found dead, police said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: LA JOLLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eager to save a cluster of deteriorating cottages in La Jolla threatened by the 
wrecker's ball, the San Diego Historical Site Board agreed unanimously 
Wednesday to recommend that the City Council take tough measures to transfer 
the historic Green Dragon Colony to a new owner. 
</P>
<P>
With the Chart House restaurant chain stepping into the fray as a potential 
buyer, the board proposed that the city staff help mediate the sale of the 
former arts enclave. 
</P>
<P>
The board also recommended that the council consider acquiring the property 
through condemnation and selling it to a buyer willing to preserve the 
structures. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of the cottages, built from 1895 to 1906, has remained clouded since a 
potential deal fell through last year between wealthy La Jolla preservationist 
Bob Barrymore and a bank representing the trust that owns the 1-acre site off 
Prospect Street. 
</P>
<P>
With a one-year hold on demolition of the structures set to end April 22, the 
Chart House chain has surfaced as a potential buyer willing to preserve the 
cottages. 
</P>
<P>
The chain, which operates a restaurant in a renovated structure next to the 
four remaining cottages, has hired an appraiser to determine the property's 
worth, according to Tony Ciani, a La Jolla preservationist eager to see the 
enclave saved.

FIRST CONVICTION IN DREXEL PROBE: AIDE AT BEVERLY HILLS OFFICE IS GUILTY OF 
PERJURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The federal investigation of Drexel Burnham Lambert claimed its first guilty 
verdict Wednesday when a jury convicted a 26-year-old trading assistant from 
the firm's Beverly Hills office of perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
A jury deliberated for only four hours before concluding that Lisa Jones of 
Sherman Oaks had lied repeatedly in January, 1988, during testimony to a grand 
jury investigating Drexel, the head of its "junk bond" department, Michael 
Milken, and a small securities firm, Princeton/Newport Partners. She was 
convicted on five counts of perjury and two of obstruction of justice. But the 
jury acquitted her on one obstruction count. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, who had cried during her testimony and had again been in tears during 
the brief deliberations, was comforted after the verdict by two women friends 
who had accompanied her from Los Angeles. She was then led silently from the 
courtroom by her lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Jones faces a maximum sentence of 35 years in prison and a fine of up to $1.7 
million. Under new federal sentencing guidelines, she will almost certainly 
have to spend time in prison, although prosecutors said they hadn't yet 
calculated the minimum possible sentence. But if she had been convicted on only 
one count she would have been required to serve from 10 to 16 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The conviction raises the possibility that Jones could receive a longer 
sentence than was imposed on either Dennis B. Levine or Ivan F. Boesky, the two 
Wall Street figures whose guilty pleas and cooperation with the government led 
to the Drexel investigation and a chain of other Wall Street cases. Levine was 
sentenced to two years in prison and Boesky to three years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rejected Plea Bargain 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand set sentencing for May 22. He allowed Jones to 
remain free on bail. 
</P>
<P>
Brian O'Neill, Jones' defense attorney, throughout the trial had portrayed her 
as a "scapegoat" and "victim" in the government's quest to prosecute higher-ups 
at Drexel and Princeton/Newport. He said after the verdict that she "got stuck 
paying the price for whatever occurred." He called the outcome "tragic" and 
said Jones was "a little person run down by a truck." O'Neill said he plans to 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
But Bruce Baird, head of the securities fraud unit in the U.S. Attorney's 
Office in Manhattan, said: "We think justice was done." He added: "We think 
that whenever people lie to the grand jury, we're not doing our job if we don't 
prosecute them." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Hansen, the prosecutor who tried the case, rejected criticism by Jones' 
supporters that the government had been unduly harsh in bringing the charges 
and vigorously prosecuting her. He said that during the grand jury proceedings 
she had repeatedly rejected chances offered to her by prosecutors to change her 
testimony and tell the truth. 
</P>
<P>
"She is nobody other than a foolish young woman who made a dumb choice despite 
numerous opportunities to make the right choice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jones had been called to New York in January, 1988, to testify before a grand 
jury looking into charges that Princeton/Newport Partners had illegally 
"parked" bonds with Drexel in a complicated scheme meant to help 
Princeton/Newport evade taxes. Under the scheme, the trades between 
Princeton/Newport and Drexel allegedly were rigged so that Princeton/Newport 
would get the securities back at a fixed price. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Presented as Scared, Confused 
</P>
<P>
Jones denied to the grand jury that that she was aware of any illegal parking. 
But during the trial, prosecutors presented tape recordings of telephone 
conversations between Drexel and Princeton/Newport, including one tape in which 
Jones was heard discussing the trades with William Hale, a Princeton/Newport 
trader. Hale testified against Jones during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
He presented Jones as a scared and confused minor employee at Drexel who had 
been intimidated by government investigators and wasn't aware that she was 
involved in any illegal activity. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony in the trial disclosed that Jones had run away from her New Jersey 
home at the age of 13 and obtained a job as a bank teller in Los Angeles by 
lying about her age. She eventually was offered a job at Drexel and worked her 
way up to being a trading assistant in the junk bond department, working in the 
same trading room as Milken. In 1988, she earned $117,000 in salary plus a 
$45,000 bonus, helping Drexel traders execute their transactions. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of her grand jury testimony, Jones had been represented by the law 
firm of Cahill Gordon &amp; Reindel, which was Drexel's main outside law firm. 
</P>
<P>
Five Princeton/Newport partners have since been named in a separate indictment 
that includes racketeering and securities fraud charges. They deny any 
wrongdoing and are awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drexel Backs Jones 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Drexel has agreed to plead guilty to six criminal counts, 
including one involving Princeton/Newport. But the firm hasn't formally entered 
its plea yet pending settlement of separate civil charges brought by the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, who as head of Drexel's junk bond department in Beverly Hills was 
behind much of the firm's success and also much of its legal problems, has been 
notified by prosecutors that he too is likely to be indicted soon. But he 
denies breaking any laws. 
</P>
<P>
While the deliberations were under way, Richard Sandler, a longtime friend of 
Milken's who is one of his main attorneys, stopped in the courtroom to offer 
sympathy and encouragement to Jones. He said he was present because "she is a 
person that I care about." Drexel, too, has been supportive of Jones throughout 
the case, continuing to pay her salary even though she is on leave and picking 
up much of her travel and legal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement after the verdict, Steven Anreder, a Drexel spokesman, said: 
"Lisa Jones was fondly regarded as a warm and highly industrious individual" by 
the people she worked with. He said: "The verdict today, therefore, is a very 
sad event which causes us a great deal of sorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Anreder said that Jones was still officially on leave and that he didn't know 
if her employment status would change as a result of the verdict.

AMERICAN ORDERS UP TO 255 JETS FROM BOEING AND FOKKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In its second major purchase of airliners in just over a month, American 
Airlines said Wednesday that it will buy up to 150 Dutch-made Fokker jets, an 
order that could ultimately be worth as much as $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the airline announced two new deals with Boeing, the Western 
world's dominant airliner manufacturer, that could eventually be worth several 
billion dollars more. 
</P>
<P>
American Chairman Robert L. Crandall said at a news conference here that the 
short- to medium-range Dutch aircraft will allow the airline to "economically 
serve the many smaller routes which support hubs at Nashville, Raleigh/Durham 
and San Jose." The new two-engine planes, capable of carrying 95 passengers, 
will enable American to rapidly retire its fleet of older Boeing 727s and will 
meet the noise requirements of such noise-sensitive airports as John Wayne in 
Orange County and National in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
American said it has reached agreement with Boeing to turn options that it had 
obtained earlier for the purchase of 25 757-200s and 10 767-300ERs into firm 
orders. The 757-200 is a two-engine, narrow-body jet. The 767-300ER, a 
two-engine wide-body, is the carrier's basic international airplane. 
</P>
<P>
Further, American acquired 70 additional options for either 757s or 767s, 
giving it a total of 85 firm orders and 85 options with Boeing, with deliveries 
extending into the late 1990s. The 70 new options are so-called convertible 
options, which American can use to buy either 757s or 767s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$1.5 Billion in Firm Orders 
</P>
<P>
Paul Karos, an airline analyst with First Boston Corp., a New York investment 
firm, said 757s sell for about $38 million, making the firming of the orders 
for 25 of the planes worth about $950 million. He estimated that 767s cost $52 
million each, making the 10 new firm orders worth about $520 million. Using 
these figures, the total for the 35 planes would be almost $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
It is not possible to calculate the value of the 70 new options because it is 
not known how many of each type of plane American will eventually buy. But if 
it buys half 757s and half 767s, the order would be worth another $3.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Crandall said American had made firm orders for 75 of the Fokker jets with 
options to buy another 75. On Feb. 7, American ordered eight of McDonnell 
Douglas' long-range MD-11 wide-body jets, with options for an additional 42. At 
the same time, American took options for 100 MD-80s, another smaller plane 
intended to replace 727s. 
</P>
<P>
Crandall said the first Fokker planes will be used to replace American's six 
British-made BAE-146 planes that it acquired when it bought AirCal in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
American will take delivery of 11 Fokker 100s in 1991, with 24 more to follow 
in 1992, 29 in 1993 and at least 11 in 1994, Crandall said. Optioned aircraft 
are scheduled to be delivered between 1994 and 1998, he added. 
</P>
<P>
USAir, a major competitor of American on West Coast routes, has ordered 20 of 
the Fokker planes, and Braniff Airlines has said it will order a dozen. 
</P>
<P>
The Fokker 100 has a range of more than 1,500 miles and operates at a maximum 
cruise altitude of 35,000 feet. It has a wingspan of about 92 feet. Each plane, 
analysts estimate, sells today for about $21 million. 
</P>
<P>
Crandall would not disclose how much American will pay for any of the planes, 
saying that such transactions are "proprietary." He added, however, that "we 
believe that we have acquired all these airplanes on competitively attractive 
terms." He said the acquisitions "finish the task of positioning ourselves for 
the 1990s." 
</P>
<P>
The Fokker 100 will be powered by Rolls-Royce engines. American's fleet is 
already one of the youngest in the industry, with its planes averaging 9.4 
years old at the end of last year. Crandall said that with the retirement of 
its 727s the figure will decline to eight years by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The 70-year-old Fokker company, which was near collapse as recently as 16 
months ago, said it has orders for 390 Fokker 100s, with 184 of the orders 
having been made in the past 30 days. The American Airlines order is the 
biggest in its history. 
</P>
<P>
E. J. Nederkoorn, an official of the Dutch company, said its assembly lines 
could turn out 46 planes annually. The company was studying the possibility of 
a joint building venture with a number of European companies as well as with 
Lockheed.

GREENSPAN: FULL EFFECT OF RATE HIKES YET TO BE FELT 
</P>

<P>
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said Wednesday that the full 
impact of higher interest rates has yet to be felt, and he defended the central 
bank's gradual credit-tightening by saying the policy will allow the economy to 
continue growing at a modest pace. 
</P>
<P>
In congressional testimony, he answered critics who say either that the Fed has 
been too stringent for the beleaguered thrift industry or too lax to snuff out 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"The best way to stabilize the economy is to make sure disruptive inflationary 
pressures don't take over," Greenspan told the House banking financial 
institutions subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
He said there is a "significant lag" between the time the Fed raises interest 
rates and the impact that action has on the economy. He was answering a 
question on why the economy has shown signs of inflating despite tighter Fed 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
The comment was taken by some dealers as a sign that the Fed will wait before 
raising interest rates further, causing the dollar and credit market interest 
rates to ease in afternoon trading. 
</P>
<P>
The central bank has been gradually pushing up interest rates since last March 
in an effort to cool inflationary pressures that Greenspan said were building 
in the economy. But recent economic data suggests that higher rates have had 
little impact to date on cooling inflation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Holding Rates Down 
</P>
<P>
Interest rates would be even higher now had the central bank done nothing, 
Greenspan said in defense of the central bank's tight policy, since the Fed's 
yearlong tightening has kept inflation from getting out of hand and kept market 
rates from rising even more. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the actions we have taken so far, rates at the long end are 
significantly lower than they otherwise would have been," Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fed is trying to minimize the rise in real interest rates," Greenspan 
added. 
</P>
<P>
He said the rise in short-term interest rates engineered by the Fed, from 6.5% 
last March to nearly 10% today, was aimed at extending the current economic 
expansion, now in its seventh year, into 1990 and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
"Our job is to suppress inflationary forces that would destabilize the 
economy," Greenspan said. "To the extent that we can do that, we can prolong 
the recovery through this year and well beyond," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Fed chairman's first public comments on inflation since Friday's one 
percentage point jump in wholesale prices for February and the more moderate 
0.4% rise in consumer prices announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said the Fed was aware that an unchecked rise in interest rates would 
increase the cost of resolving the savings and loan crisis, estimated by the 
Bush Administration at $157 billion over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
But he said the Fed was concerned that the ultimate cost to the thrift industry 
and to the taxpayer would mount if it allowed inflation to get out of control.

ESCROW FIRM SEIZED FOR ALLEGED MISUSE OF CASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State officials said they seized an Encino escrow company, the Escrow Shoppe, 
on Wednesday after alleging that the company made $3 million in unauthorized 
payments and was missing $87,000 it was supposed to be holding in a customer's 
trust account. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas H. Warden, a lawyer for the company and its owner, Sandra Bianco, denied 
the allegations by the state Department of Corporations and said no money was 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer acknowledged that there were some "unauthorized uses of escrow 
checks" but said that in most cases the checks were never cashed and money was 
never lost. He blamed the problem on some former employees and said the Escrow 
Shoppe is cooperating with state officials. 
</P>
<P>
Escrow companies are used by buyers and sellers of real estate to help ensure 
that certain conditions are met, such as a property's title search, before a 
sale is finalized. The escrow firms also hold any payments between the parties 
until then. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Handled Thousands a Year 
</P>
<P>
The Escrow Shoppe was one of the biggest escrow firms in the San Fernando 
Valley and had operated since 1974, Warden said, and Judy L. Hartley, a lawyer 
with the Department of Corporations, said the firm handled thousands of escrows 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
The department froze the Escrow Shoppe's assets Monday and took possession of 
the firm Wednesday, Hartley said. The department also appointed a conservator 
to manage and eventually liquidate the firm, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The actions came after a department audit of the Escrow Shoppe's books revealed 
the alleged unauthorized payments and the missing cash, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We received some complaints into our office that prompted us to go out there 
and conduct a special examination of their books and records," Hartley said. 
</P>
<P>
She noted that the company had "stripped their premises. We don't know where 
the accounting records are now. They even took the phones out of the walls. Our 
first task is to try and find everything." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sold Accounts 
</P>
<P>
Warden, however, said Bianco had voluntarily closed the firm Friday and 
surrendered her operating license Tuesday, before the state took action. "The 
state technically does not have jurisdiction to appoint a conservator," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He also said the Escrow Shoppe had already sold its remaining escrow accounts 
and trust funds to the Santa Monica branch of another firm, Townsgate Escrow, 
which is based in Westlake Village. He declined to reveal the terms of the 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
Warden said the Escrow Shoppe last week "had shown evidence" to auditors "that 
all monies in fact were in trust accounts for the benefit of buyers and 
sellers." But Bianco "elected to go out of business" after discovering the 
alleged misuse of some escrow checks by former employees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bianco knew "that she would ultimately have to bear the blame for any 
wrongdoing of her employees," Warden said. 
</P>
<P>
Warden alleged that some former employees used escrow company checks "to make 
misrepresentations . . . for their own personal gain," but no money was ever 
lost from customer accounts. In most cases, he said, "the checks were never 
cashed and the money was never spent." He declined to provide additional 
details but said the former employees allegedly involved were fired.

JUDGE ORDERS EASTERN MACHINISTS TO STOP HARASSMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT E. DALLOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal bankruptcy judge Wednesday ordered Eastern Airlines' striking 
machinists to stop harassing customers and employees who cross picket lines at 
New York's LaGuardia Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The airline accused the strikers of spitting at employees and passengers, of 
throwing nails in front of cars in attempts to puncture tires, of damaging cars 
in a variety of ways and of making threats and assaults. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern lawyers appeared Wednesday morning before Judge Burton R. Lifland with 
videotapes that they said supported their claims. The judge, who issued a 
temporary restraining order, set next Wednesday for a hearing on Eastern's 
request for a preliminary injunction. 
</P>
<P>
Lifland ordered the leadership of the International Assn. of Machinists and 
Aerospace Workers to notify rank and file members that they must "refrain from 
engaging in any violence, threats, mass picketing, assaults, nuisance, 
trespass, verbal abuse, disorderly conduct, defamation, disturbing the peace 
and/or other tortious acts directed at Eastern, its officers, agents, 
representatives, employees, customers or others having business dealings with 
Eastern." 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to all members, the IAM said they must "strictly comply with the 
requirements of the order. A violation of the restraining order will have 
far-reaching consequences." 
</P>
<P>
The court action came a few hours before a U.S. trustee appointed a 15-member 
committee composed of creditors, two unions and one individual to help oversee 
the airline's reorganization under provisions of Chapter 11 of the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code. Eastern filed March 9 for protection from creditors while it 
reorganizes. 
</P>
<P>
About 400 creditors appeared in a hotel ballroom for the meeting to hear from 
Eastern's lawyers what the airline's present financial condition is and to get 
an idea of how its reorganization will take place. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Jones, U.S. trustee for the Judicial Districts of New York, Connecticut 
and Vermont, had predicted to reporters that the session, which began about 2 
p.m., would last until late in the evening. However, only four questions were 
asked and the session was completed in about 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Jones said the committee "will act as the fiduciary body for all the unsecured 
creditors and will also negotiate for all creditors." He said he sought to 
include the airline's largest creditors as well as a variety of others. 
</P>
<P>
Duties of the creditors committee include coming up with its own plan of 
reorganization for Eastern and negotiating with the airline on one that it will 
propose. The bankruptcy judge will administer the steps taken toward 
reorganization and must approve any sale of assets "outside of the ordinary." 
Sale of a landing slot, a gate or an airplane would not require his approval. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the unsecured creditors, which range from ticket holders and food 
vendors to aircraft engine manufacturers, there is a large group of creditors 
whose loans are secured by collateral. Of Eastern's $1.2 billion in debt, 25% 
is held by secured creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Miller, the airline's bankruptcy lawyer, told the assembled creditors 
that Eastern has $1 billion in assets "over and above" its $4.5 billion in 
liabilities. The airline had said earlier that it filed under Chapter 11 
because the strike was rapidly draining it of cash. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern is flying 9% to 10% of the 1,040 daily trips it flew before the 
machinists' strike began March 4, Miller said. Most of the unionized pilots and 
flight attendants have observed the machinists' picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
The committee of creditors includes Airbus Industrie, which is owed $95.9 
million by Eastern; General Electric, $75.5 million; Boeing, $54 million; 
United States Trust of New York, $58.7 million; UT Credit Corp., $22.3 million; 
IBJ Schroder Bank &amp; Trust, $19.6 million; American National Bank &amp; 
Trust of Chicago, $12.8 million; Rolls-Royce Credit Corp., $5.9 million; 
Marriott Corp., $1.1 million, and AT&amp;T Communications, $800,000. 
</P>
<P>
The other five members are Citicorp and Rohr Aero Services, which are creditors 
but were not on the list of Eastern's 20 largest creditors that was filed with 
the bankruptcy statement; the International Assn. of Machinists; the Air Line 
Pilots Assn., and Mary Grace Shore, an Eastern ticket agent in Richmond, Va., 
who represents the company's non-striking employees.

More Layoffs at Law Firm: Pillsbury, Madison &amp; Sutro said it is initiating 
a second round of layoffs among its secretarial and support staff. The San 
Francisco law firm, which last week said 35 secretaries had been terminated, 
said up to an additional 24 clerks, possibly including several in the Los 
Angeles branch office, will be let go as part of its new cost control program. 
Last week, the firm acknowledged that its 170 partners would skip their regular 
March profit sharing check because of soaring expenses, in part caused by a 
costly computer conversion and the opening of new Los Angeles and San Jose 
branch offices.

Emhart Will Consider New Bid: Officials of Black &amp; Decker Corp., which has 
agreed to buy Emhart Corp. in a $2.8-billion takeover, said they were not 
worried about Emhart's indication that it still would consider a higher bid 
from a rival suitor. In an SEC filing, Emhart said it offered New York-based 
investment partnership Topper L.P. the chance to review internal company 
documents if the information would help Topper formulate a higher bid. Emhart 
has rejected as inadequate Topper's unsolicited $2.4-billion buyout offer. 
Topper investors include oil heir Gordon P. Getty.

Westin Hotels &amp; Resorts has named Chieko N. Aoki chief executive, in

dozen years in those posts. 
</P>
<P>

"I've been with the company for 48 years," said Mullikin, who started working

DIGITAL'S STOCK PLUNGES ON EARNINGS OUTLOOK

Digital Equipment Corp. on Wednesday became the latest technology giant to fall 
victim to lowered earnings estimates as its stock plunged more than $10 a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
The stock closed down $10.625 at $96.375 in consolidated New York Stock 
Exchange trading, a decline of about 10%. It was the most heavily traded issue 
on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
Digital's decline came after the Maynard, Mass., computer maker indicated to 
analysts that its order rate in the current quarter was likely to be lower than 
some analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Despite success in the marketplace, the world's second-biggest computer company 
after IBM has been a serious disappointment to investors. Its stock price is 
half its peak of $199 a share in August, 1987, which was the time of the stock 
market's all-time high. 
</P>
<P>
Digital's fall followed similar drops in recent months by Apple Computer Inc., 
Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said there was no single factor accounting for all the reductions in 
earnings estimates.

Wall Street's blue chip stocks crept lower Wednesday as weakness in the 
technology sector highlighted fears of a recession in a market already worried 
about higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 3.04 to 2,263.21. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 146.57 million shares, against 
142.01 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported that new factory orders for durable goods 
dropped 3.6% in February, surprising analysts who had expected an increase. 
</P>
<P>
The news was interpreted as a fresh signal that the economy was beginning to 
lose the momentum that has created upward pressure on inflation and interest 
rates in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts said many traders remained unconvinced that inflation was ready to 
abate after back-to-back increases of a full percentage point in the producer 
price index of finished goods in January and February. 
</P>
<P>
Also, some investors apparently are beginning to worry about the implications 
of slower growth for corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
Digital Equipment, the most active NYSE issue, tumbled 10 5/8 to 96 3/8 as 
several analysts scaled back their earnings estimates for the company. 
</P>
<P>
International Business Machines, which has been under pressure since it issued 
a downbeat first-quarter earnings projection last week, fell 7/8 to 109 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the technology sector, Hewlett-Packard dropped 1 3/4 to 52; Compaq 
Computer fell 1 1/4 to 68 1/8, and Microsoft, traded in the over-the-counter 
market, dipped 7/8 to 49. 
</P>
<P>
Comprehensive Care fell 1 3/8 to 9 3/4. The company reported lower quarterly 
earnings and omitted its dividend. 
</P>
<P>
Gerber Products Inc. rose 1 7/8 to 66 3/4. The company is expected to report 
higher earnings for the fiscal year ending March 31. 
</P>
<P>
Honeywell Inc. shares also were up, gaining 1/2 to 64 3/8. Two Wall Street 
analysts reiterated buy recommendations, citing strong orders, good cash flow 
and an attractive share price. 
</P>
<P>
Communications Satellite Corp. rose 1 1/2 to 28. Comsat attributed the rise to 
news that rival Spectradyne Inc. is being bought out for $635 million. 
</P>
<P>
National Patent Development, traded on the American Stock Exchange, slumped 7/8 
to 6 1/4. The company suspended its dividend. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilshire index of 5,000 equities closed at 2,873.261, down 6.192, or 0.22%, 
from Tuesday's close. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks dipped 0.39 to 
163.41. 
</P>
<P>
Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 1.31 to 334.54, and S&amp;P's 
500-stock composite index was down 0.84 at 290.49. 
</P>
<P>
The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market lost 1.20 to 400.57. 
At the Amex, the market value index closed at 325.88, down 0.61. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo stocks closed lower Wednesday after investors, jittery about inflation 
and interest rates both here and abroad, sold stocks and took to the sidelines. 
The Nikkei share index fell 211.56 points, or 0.67%, to close at 31,443.24. 
</P>
<P>
Worries about worldwide interest rates also pushed share prices sharply lower 
on the London Stock Exchange. The Financial Times 100-share index fell 23.6 
points, or 1.1%, to 2,048.6.

President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has staked his reputation on his 
government's ability to negotiate a substantial reduction in Mexico's 
$102-billion foreign debt, and officials say he must do so by the end of July, 
when an anti-inflation package of wage and price controls expires. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe Armella has visited the United States, Canada and 
Japan to put forth the Mexican government's position that the $10 billion a 
year that Mexico pays to service its debt is a major obstacle to economic 
growth and must be reduced. Fernando Solana Morales, Mexico's secretary of 
foreign relations, was in Washington this week on a similar mission. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank in Amsterdam this week, 
Aspe applauded a new U.S. policy emphasizing debt relief. But "for us, 
solutions must be found quickly," he said. "It is obvious that our people 
cannot and should not wait any longer." 
</P>
<P>
When U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady announced the new policy earlier 
this month, the Mexican government called it "a positive response to the 
proposals Mexico's negotiators have been making." Bankers and economists said 
the new policy made it unlikely for the time being that Mexico would declare a 
moratorium on debt payments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Threatened to Halt Payments 
</P>
<P>
But in the weeks since, economic analysts have grown wary of the newly powerful 
role of the International Monetary Fund that is implicit in the plan and are 
impatient for details. They say the sketchy plan offers fewer specifics than 
the Mexican government had hoped for by this time, nearly four months into 
Salinas' term and three months into President Bush's. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a proposal of good intentions, but it falls short of the dimensions of 
the problem in the world and in Mexico," said economist Rosario Green, 
co-director of the private Bilateral Commission on U.S.-Mexico Relations. 
</P>
<P>
"The Brady plan proposes more supervision by the IMF, which in the end is more 
of the same. The IMF conditions a reduction of debt on a policy of adjustment 
(austerity). Either there is a new proposal by the creditors, or Mexico is not 
going to be able to grow." 
</P>
<P>
When he was campaigning for election last year, Salinas threatened to halt debt 
payments if they prevented Mexico's stagnant economy from growing. After his 
relatively poor showing at the polls, the lowest ever for a ruling-party 
presidential candidate, bankers feared that he would succumb to pressure from a 
newly strengthened leftist opposition and take radical steps. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, officials of Salinas' government took to the road to meet with foreign 
governments. The Mexican government has been pushing for a six-year agreement 
combining debt relief with new loans to reduce the "net transfer of resources" 
by $7 billion a year, a total of $42 billion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bankers Irked 
</P>
<P>
For the past six years, officials say, Mexico has paid 6% of its gross national 
product to service the debt. They want to bring that down to about 2%. Such a 
reduction is essential, they say, to reach the annual growth of 4.5% that is 
needed to get the economy back on its feet and the ruling Institutional 
Revolutionary Party back in the good graces of most Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
"From the beginning," Green said, "Salinas tried to show that there would be no 
unilateral measures. He tried to establish a negotiation, but one that leaves 
the door open if circumstances dictate otherwise. The Brady plan says to the 
Mexican government, 'We are going to help you dialogue with the banks, but 
there are no guarantees.' This generates space. It buys time." 
</P>
<P>
While commercial bankers feel temporary relief from the threat of a moratorium, 
they are irked because they have been unable to meet with Mexican officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We have tried to contact authorities, but we get no answer," said one American 
banker, asking not to be identified by name. "They have tried to make an 
economic problem a political problem, and to involve other countries . . . to 
pressure banks into accepting terms that, from an economic point of view, are 
not acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
The bankers expect Mexican officials to agree to talks after Aspe returns from 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
They say that they, too, are waiting for more details of the Brady plan -- 
specifically, what percentage of debt reduction he contemplates and what kind 
of guarantees they will get from multinational institutions for the remaining 
debt. They add that they would like to see a "menu" of debt-reducing options 
from the Mexican government. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Japanese bankers are pressing hard for debt-for-equity swaps and for 
access to financial services markets in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opened to Imports 
</P>
<P>
In Amsterdam, Aspe adamantly opposed swaps. He said they are inflationary and 
inhibit investment, and he argued that they amount to a subsidy to foreign 
investors when Mexico is under pressure to reduce subsidies that aid the poor. 
But he said swaps may be offered for investments that require a fiscal 
incentive or for assets that the government wants to sell. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican officials say the IMF cannot demand any more major austerity measures 
because Mexico already has made more sacrifices than any other country in Latin 
America. It has dramatically reduced government spending through layoffs, as 
well as eliminated most subsidies and sold off hundreds of state-owned 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico has been opened to imports by the elimination of most tariffs and the 
reduction of those that remain from 100% to a maximum of 20%. Officials say 
that in the coming weeks they will publish new regulations liberalizing foreign 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
Economics analyst Rogelio Ramirez de la O, however, points to Mexico's current 
account deficit -- $3.3 billion last year and expected to be higher for 1989. 
"The IMF has a structural mission to preserve international payments on an 
orderly basis," Ramirez said. "The IMF is not going to be happy about Mexico's 
current account deficit." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials seem satisfied with the changes in the Mexican economy but 
question the need for $7 billion a year in debt relief. They say this figure 
was based on an average price of $10 a barrel for Mexico's oil, which they 
consider low, and on 11% growth in imports this year, which they believe is 
high. 
</P>
<P>
"If the economy is going to recover, why do they need $7 billion in relief for 
1995?" an American source asked. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials and banks emphasize that Mexico must come up with a way to 
repatriate capital that has fled the country -- as much as $40 billion to $60 
billion, by some estimates. Mexico, in turn, argues that the money will not 
come home until there is a debt agreement to bolster confidence in the Mexican 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Mexican officials argue that they will not be able to negotiate a new 
anti-inflation pact with businessmen and unions unless they have a debt 
agreement by July. The pact has brought inflation down from more than 50% last 
year to the 18%-to-25% range this year -- but businessmen are pressing the 
government to lift price controls, and disgruntled workers are struggling with 
wages, the value of which has been eroded by 50% over the last six years. 
</P>
<P>
The left, led by former presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, continues 
to push for a unilateral halt in debt payments before any negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico's reserves have dropped dramatically from a high of $16 billion last 
spring, analysts said. The government announces its reserves only twice a year, 
but several economists estimate that they are now about $8 billion; one put the 
figure as low as $4 billion to $5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Without a debt agreement, Ramirez says more capital will flee the country in 
fear of a devaluation.

NEW PARAMOUNT UNIT WILL DO COMMERCIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paramount Pictures, perhaps best known for making movies such as "Raiders of 
the Lost Ark" and the Star Trek films, said Tuesday that it will soon begin 
filming something else -- television commercials. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood studio, which is a division of Gulf &amp; Western Corp., has 
created a new unit, Paramount Images, that will exclusively produce commercials 
for television. Commercials will be filmed on the Paramount lot in a studio 
directly across from the sound stage where the TV show "Cheers" is filmed. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make better use of Paramount's facilities," said Paul Babb, who was 
named executive producer of Paramount Images. "The purpose is to take advantage 
of the things that are already here -- the stages, the facilities and even the 
construction crews." 
</P>
<P>
Since the facilities are already in place, Paramount will spend very little to 
set up this new unit, which hopes to film as many as 100 commercials annually, 
Babb said. Although Babb would not project first-year revenues, industry 
executives estimate that the new division could post annual revenues of $6 
million or more. 
</P>
<P>
"The commercial business is a very solid, working business," said Babb. "You 
don't have the runaway costs of a few years ago. If done properly, you can do 
very well making commercials." 
</P>
<P>
Paramount, however, is not the only motion picture studio to attempt to make a 
profit from commercials. For nearly 25 years, Columbia Pictures operated a TV 
commercial production unit, EUE Screen Gems, which it sold in 1983. Also, MGM, 
Universal Studios and 20th Century-Fox all formerly operated TV commercial 
divisions. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them closed up because, in the end, it wasn't profitable," said Ted 
Goetz, president of the Assn. of Independent Commercial Producers/West and 
executive producer at the Studio City production company Filmfair. "For a major 
film studio, the money to be made in a TV commercial is penny ante, but the 
executive attention that must be devoted to it is considerable." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Odyssey Entertainment operates a TV commercial production 
company, Odyssey Filmakers, which has filmed ads for advertisers including 
General Tire and Del Taco/Naugles. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody in this industry is affected when another production company opens," 
said Sherry Seckel, vice president and executive producer at Odyssey. "There 
are already too many directors dividing up too small of a pie." 
</P>
<P>
But she said that Paramount could have some advantages. After all, Paramount 
will be competing against many much smaller production companies that generally 
have tiny budgets and small staffs. And historically, some smaller production 
companies in Los Angeles have been known to appear on the scene one day and 
disappear the next. "There is solidarity in a name like Paramount," said 
Seckel. "There is an inference that they can weather the storm." 
</P>
<P>
To attract ad agencies and advertisers, Paramount has hired several directors 
who are well known for their past TV commercials, including Victor Haboush, who 
has filmed ads for McDonald's and for the Kibbles 'n Bits and Tender Chops 
brands of pet food. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Paramount has also lured actor and director Leonard Nimoy -- 
of Star Trek fame -- to direct his first TV commercials. Nimoy recently 
directed the Touchstone hit "Three Men and a Baby." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what ads Leonard will do yet," said Babb, "but I can assure you 
they will be glitzy."

* Allen H. Neuharth, chairman of Gannett Co., has announced his resignation as 
a member of the Gannett board, effective April 27 at the annual shareholders' 
meeting in Chicago. Neuharth, 65, retires as chairman of Gannett on March 31. 
He will be succeeded by John J. Curley, president and chief executive. 
Neuharth's term as a director expires in 1991. Under Gannett's bylaws, he would 
be eligible for election to another three-year term at that time. Neuharth said 
that he is resigning as a director to avoid "inhibiting" his successor or the 
board by his presence.

JAPANESE FIRMS ONLY BIDDERS FOR FAA JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A $1-billion contract to build advanced radar screens for the U.S. air traffic 
control system is likely to go to a Japanese television manufacturer because no 
American company is ready to bid on the project, a House panel was told 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Zenith Electronics Corp. Chairman Jerry K. Pearlman said only two companies -- 
both Japanese -- bid on the contract to provide high-resolution picture tubes 
for 31-inch terminals in the Federal Aviation Administration air traffic 
control centers. 
</P>
<P>
Pearlman said the terminals are to be installed in 1992 and 1993 but that 
American electronics companies were unable to bid because they don't yet 
possess the technology. 
</P>
<P>
"There is not presently an American solution available," Pearlman said. 
</P>
<P>
He called the contract "the largest high-resolution display purchase in the 
world" and said it was part of the $3-billion upgrade the FAA plans for its air 
controller equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Pearlman's testimony drew swift responses from members of the House Science, 
Space and Technology Committee, which held the hearing to consider ways the 
government can spur U.S. entry into what proponents of advanced television say 
will be a $140-billion business in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Robert A. Roe (D-N.J.), the committee chairman, said the panel would look 
into the case and said Pearlman's testimony may provide the issue he needs to 
attract public attention to the dilemma facing the U.S. electronics industry as 
Japanese and European competitors race to gain the upper hand in the TV 
technology of the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
He urged witnesses before the hearing to expand their discussion of advanced 
television technology to its many possible uses, such as in medicine, education 
and the military, "so I can tell the Congress of the United States that this is 
not just a bigger, brighter picture on a television tube." 
</P>
<P>
Pearlman said the American company Zenith, which has combined with IBM to build 
a high-definition television system, might be able to bid on the FAA contract 
if the installation schedule were delayed about a year and if Zenith could find 
$21 million in research funds. 
</P>
<P>
He said the $30 million in seed money the Pentagon is offering private 
enterprise for the system's development "will only scratch the surface." 
</P>
<P>
He said $100 million a year for three to four years, "matched by an equal or 
greater amount by industry, is required. I assure you that the industry is 
ready, willing and able to make these investments."

ART BUCHWALD: THOSE WOMANIZERS NEED LOVE, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Art Buchwald 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sen. Tower is gone but the word womanizer lives on. The senator was falsely 
accused of being one. Even Sam Donaldson doesn't know what a womanizer is. 
</P>
<P>
My Webster's dictionary doesn't seem to know either. It defines womanizing as 
"to pursue freewheeling relationships with women." 
</P>
<P>
I decided to ask some friends what they thought a womanizer was. 
</P>
<P>
Ella Brennan told me, "A womanizer is a man a woman can't stand." 
</P>
<P>
"Supposing she likes him?" 
</P>
<P>
"Then he's a teddy bear." 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Johnson said, "A womanizer is someone who has no respect for anybody. For 
example, if a guy in my office takes me out on a date and then the next night 
has a date with my roommate -- he is a low-life rat." 
</P>
<P>
"And if he called you two nights in a row, what would he be?" 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Right." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Hefty spoke up, "The whole business of courting is full of jokers. I enjoy 
dating girls, but so far my mother hasn't liked any of them. Does that make me 
a womanizer?" 
</P>
<P>
I replied, "People believe that if a man has to go from woman to woman, he is 
fatally flawed." 
</P>
<P>
Bob protested, "But if a man's not married, there is nothing wrong with going 
out with a lot of women. Everyone has to go somewhere to eat." 
</P>
<P>
I asked Sarah Temple if she thought womanizers were evil people or just poor 
little sheep who had lost their way. 
</P>
<P>
"I deal with it on a case-by-case basis. Some guys who start out as womanizers 
can easily be tamed. In a way, it's more fun because it's a challenge to win a 
man over for yourself. Then there are men who are incorrigible and will never 
change. They should not even be confirmed as a member of Bush's Cabinet." 
</P>
<P>
John O'Donnell was sputtering mad. "The whole mating game is based on female 
pursuit. Everything from Opium perfume to Victoria's Secret is used to trap us. 
After spending so much money on themselves, women get mad if the bait doesn't 
work. So they start bad-mouthing males around the water cooler. What do they 
call a woman who dates more than one guy?" 
</P>
<P>
"An environmentalist?" I suggested. 
</P>
<P>
I then asked Arthur Buckingham, the lobbyist, "Do certain professions have more 
womanizers than others?" 
</P>
<P>
"Of course they do. Defense consultants are in a very high stress business and 
womanizing is the only way they can wind down." 
</P>
<P>
Roz Ripple thought womanizers should be hung. 
</P>
<P>
"They serve no useful purpose, and they're always spoiling your fun on a 
Saturday night." 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds as if you're bitter because there are no messages on your answering 
machine," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"I can get all the womanizer dates I want. But I wouldn't waste my time with a 
man who is interested in going to a movie with me one night and validating his 
parking ticket with someone else the next." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Trilling added, "You can't label a person a womanizer just because he 
wants to take you out. Underneath his Ralph Lauren sport jacket, he might be as 
honorable as Ollie North." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Hefty couldn't have agreed more. "What everyone forgets is that men who 
take out more than one woman need love, too."

TOXIC SUBSTANCE CRISIS IN THE HOME; 
</P>
<P>
CHILDREN ARE CHIEF VICTIMS OF CARELESSLY STORED POISONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SIMROSS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though last week's news on toxic substances was dramatic -- cyanide in grapes, 
chemicals on apples, illegal pesticide dumping in a Burbank stream and fumes 
from a chemical tanker truck shutting 10 miles of Interstate 5 for hours -- 
your home can have just as many hazardous substance worries every day for you, 
your children and your pets. 
</P>
<P>
The typical home, apartment or condominium, experts say, contains all manner of 
potential poisons, including household cleaners, paints, furniture polishes, 
wood strippers, charcoal lighter fluids, pesticides, perfumes and prescription 
or over-the-counter drugs stored in unsafe places. 
</P>
<P>
Toxicologists note that almost any substance can be poisonous if misused. 
</P>
<P>
"Most poisonings occur at home, the majority of them in children under 5, boys 
twice as often as girls," said Dr. Marc Bayer, a toxicologist and director of 
the Los Angeles County Medical Assn.'s Poison Center on Wilshire Boulevard. 
"Every 30 seconds in this country, a child is poisoned." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Poison Prevention Week 
</P>
<P>
This week, National Poison Prevention Week, is a good time to safety-check the 
house, garage, workshop and garden. 
</P>
<P>
It also may be time to get tips by visiting the "Name Your Poison" exhibit at 
the California Museum of Science and Industry on Exposition Boulevard near the 
Los Angeles Coliseum. Sponsored by the Olive View Medical Center Foundation in 
Sylmar, the exhibit is free, open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and lasts through 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The display, for example, shows medicines that look exactly like candies and 
could be mistaken by a child or adult. 
</P>
<P>
Poison center experts' advice on medications: Never refer to medicine as 
"candy." Never let a child take it unsupervised. Don't save medicine. Check 
expiration dates and flush leftover drugs down the toilet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Child-Proof Caps 
</P>
<P>
Keep medications in bottles with child-proof caps. A bad trend that poison 
center personnel have detected is that many children are poisoned accidentally 
after taking medicine found at their grandparents' home. "The elderly may have 
arthritis and just can't open the child-proof tops, so they leave them open," 
Bayer said. "Then the visiting child takes it." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, national statistics show, 35% of accidental drug poisonings of small 
children occurred at an elderly relative's home. That's why the U.S. Consumer 
Product Safety Commission is funding research at Western Michigan University in 
Kalamazoo to create a better child-resistant cap, one easier for older adults 
but not children to open. 
</P>
<P>
Just this week, researchers unveiled a prototype, a cap that must be opened 
with the end of a spoon. "We're trying to come up with a concept that the 
adults will use on medicines, so it is easier for the adults to use, but the 
kids can't figure it out," said Ken Giles of the safety group. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1972, when safety caps were introduced, poisoning death rates in children 
are down almost 80%, he noted, adding, "We're saving lives . . . but we're not 
making much of a dent in actual poisoning incidents." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Storage Safety Tips 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, there were 107,000 children under age 5 accidentally poisoned in 
1987, the safety group and the Poison Prevention Week Council in Washington 
report. 
</P>
<P>
To improve the safety of garages and workshops, experts say owners should 
ensure that cleaning supplies, paints, solvents, pesticides and pool and spa 
chemicals have hard-to-open lids. They should be stored out of reach of 
children or pets, preferably in a locked cupboard. They never should be stored 
in unlabeled soda bottles or jars. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the home, experts from the Los Angeles County Medical Assn.'s Poison 
Center advise, parents should consider poison perils from a child's point of 
view: Crawl on hands and knees to check what's stored under those kitchen and 
bathroom sinks. It may seem silly conduct but it could be a lifesaver. 
</P>
<P>
At the science museum, exhibits show another poison pitfall: kitchen products 
that youngsters or those not fluent in English might confuse, like a plastic 
milk container that resembles a drain cleaner bottle or a green cleanser 
container that looks like a box of cheese. Beware of these. 
</P>
<P>
And remember, any chemical or poisonous substance that will make people ill 
also will sicken pets. Animal experts say that motorists should keep antifreeze 
-- which tastes sweet and is a favorite of dogs and cats -- stored in a locked 
cupboard and wash it from areas where it has leaked or been drained. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tough to Predict 
</P>
<P>
Many homeowners poison themselves by mixing toxic substances, for example, 
bleach and ammonia, which combine to create a poisonous gas cloud that can 
cause respiratory and eye problems. The best advice: Never mix household 
products because it's tough to predict what toxic fumes may be produced. 
</P>
<P>
If there's reason to suspect you, your child or pet has ingested a poison, or 
you've created a toxic mixture, call the nearest regional poison center for 
help. 
</P>
<P>
Why call such centers, all of them 24-hour operations? "Because we can provide 
information about first aid advice and direct them to the appropriate source, 
hospital, doctor, or vet," Bayer said. "Something they ate, for instance, 
Vaseline or a bite of a jade plant, is nontoxic, so they wouldn't need to rush 
to an emergency room and have a bill for medical treatment." 
</P>
<P>
There are 104 poison centers nationwide. Locally, the LACMA Poison Center 
handles about 80,000 calls annually from residents of Los Angeles, Ventura and 
Santa Barbara counties. If you live in the 213 area code, call 484-5151; 
outside it, call (800) 777-6476. 
</P>
<P>
If you are a resident of Orange, San Bernardino, Riverside, Inyo or Mono 
counties, contact the Orange County Regional Poison Center at (800) 544-4404. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego residents in the 619 area code may call the San Diego Poison Center 
at 543-6000; from northern parts of the county or Imperial, residents may call 
(800) 876-4766. 
</P>
<P>
Getting rid of unused poisons, garden pesticides, solvents, oil-based paints 
and automotive fluids can be harder. But they should not be dumped into 
toilets, drains, sewers or soil because they can seep into the water supply and 
pollute it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recycling Hot Line 
</P>
<P>
Check with the California Waste Management Board's recycling hot line -- (800) 
553-2962 -- for possible places to recycle or dispose of small quantities of 
motor oil or pesticides. They also can tell where to recycle aluminum, glass, 
newspapers, cardboard and plastics. 
</P>
<P>
City or county sanitation or waste management offices also can advise if they 
have programs to dispose of or recycle hazardous household waste; several 
Southern California cities have monthly roundups at school parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles' Public Works Dept. recently began such a program, which runs every 
30 or 45 days. Call (213) 74-WASTE for information. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County has a similar program. For information, call the Orange County 
Hazardous Material Program Office (714) 744-0516. In San Diego, call county 
offices at (619) 236-2222 or (619) 235-0281. 
</P>
<P>
If you're planning to take a product to such an event, be sure it is properly 
identified. Officials at landfills will not take substances unless they know 
what they are. 
</P>
<P>
In January, Los Angeles began a pilot program of home pickups in Council 
District 1 (represented by Councilwoman Gloria Molina) and District 14 
(represented by Councilman Richard Alatorre). Those in either district may call 
74-WASTE to set up an appointment to have products collected.

HONORING MESSAGE OF AIDS WRITERS; 
</P>
<P>
AWARDS DINNER ALSO RAISES MONEY FOR SERVICE PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A small gathering of the literary community provided a powerful evening at the 
first Words Project for AIDS awards dinner. 
</P>
<P>
The 8-month-old organization gave awards to writers for their outstanding works 
on the subject of AIDS and raised money for the human-service programs of AIDS 
Project Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 people turned out for the event Monday night at the Crystal Room of 
the Beverly Hills Hotel, including Words Project co-founders Eric Latzky and 
Mallory Tarcher Dougherty, who were also co-chairs. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that literary people, the people who read and write, might be the 
one group with the greatest singular power to instruct and to teach," said 
Latzky, a fiction writer. "The message we want to send out is that people in 
the publishing industry have gotten involved with this, and everyone can do 
what they do best. This is an industry that has an effect on the population. 
There's even a very simple message that a literature of AIDS exists." 
</P>
<P>
Latzky and Dougherty, a publicist, met at a women's literary club, and both 
shared a desire to do something to get the literary community involved with 
AIDS awareness. 
</P>
<P>
The awards, which grew out of an early plan to give a reading, were presented 
in fiction/poetry and nonfiction categories. A special recognition category 
cited scholarly works and social commentary, children's AIDS literature and 
AIDS care-givers' literature. 
</P>
<P>
"Love Alone: Eighteen Elegies for Rog" by Paul Monette, published by Stonewall 
Inn Editions of St. Martin's Press, won for best fiction/poetry, and "AIDS: The 
Women," edited by Ines Rieder and Patricia Ruppelt and published by Cleis 
Press, received the nonfiction award. 
</P>
<P>
"The elegies are very raw, very angry and hard," Monette said about his book, 
written after the death of his lover, Roger Horwitz. "I tried to reflect the 
pain and grief; there was no distance from it at all." 
</P>
<P>
Monette had written poetry in his 20s, only to give it up for fiction and 
screenplays. "When the real pain of Roger hit me," he said, "I went back to 
poetry. I feel so glad it's down, but sometimes I'm embarrassed by the 
intensity and the emotion of it. It's ironic to be in black tie accepting a 
prize for a book that is so full of pain. But life is full of ironies. And I 
want people to be touched." 
</P>
<P>
Rieder and Ruppelt were not able to make it to the awards because of a book 
tour, but co-publisher Frederique Delacoste had driven from San Francisco that 
day to attend the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted the book to be a forum not only for women afflicted with AIDS," she 
said, "but women who are care-givers as well. It's important to give a face to 
these women." 
</P>
<P>
Among the guests were WPA advisory board member Michael Dougherty, publisher 
Jeremy P. Tarcher, Michael Cart of library and community services of Beverly 
Hills, BettyClare Moffatt of IBS Press and Mothers of AIDS Persons, Robert 
Welsch and Liz Williams of J. P. Tarcher Inc., Amy Scholder of City Lights 
Publishers in San Francisco, attorneys Stephen Kramer and Jeffrey Pugh, Ira 
Silverberg of Grove Press, Miriam Bass of Crown Books, Joan Singleton of Lone 
Eagle Productions, Elena Irving who designed the awards (glass sculptures) and 
David Wexler, chairman of APLA. Shari Lewis served as emcee. 
</P>
<P>
Also on hand were members of the awards selection committee: Jack Miles, book 
editor of the Los Angeles Times; Gregory Kolovakos of the New York State 
Council on the Arts; Silverberg; Scholder and Sasha Alyson of Alyson 
Publications.

YOUR FAMILY TREE!: MYERS COMES FROM MANY SOURCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRA V. GORMLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Could you tell me something about the surname Myers? I know that many 
people of different nationalities have this name, but my line came from 
Maryland and I have them traced back to the early 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: You are correct about the name having several origins. However, Myers 
or Myer frequently came from Germany. It means an overseer or head servant and 
later meant a farmer -- thus its popularity as a surname. It also is an English 
surname, sometimes spelled Mires. It derived there as a locality surname 
meaning "at the mire (swampy, low-lying land, or bog)." In England it was a 
north-English surname. In America, the name could have come from ancestors from 
this area in England or from German or German-Jewish ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
In Jewish names with a combination of "Meyer," such as Meyeroff, they are 
usually an elaborated form of Meir (meaning "light" in Hebrew, according to 
some sources). Some forms of this surname would be: Meyerfeld, Meyerheim, 
Meyers, Meyerstein, Meyerhardt and Meyersicht; many may have been shortened to 
Meyer. According to Dan Rottenberg in his "Finding Our Fathers, A Guidebook to 
Jewish Genealogy," he lists Meyers, Meier, Meyerowitz, Meierovics, Meyerson, 
Myer, Myers, Myerson and Meir as Ashkenazi names taken from the Hebrew word for 
"wise" or "scholarly." 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am interested in finding an authentic copy of my family coat of arms. 
Could you recommend a reputable company from which I could obtain this? 
</P>
<P>
A: Coats of arms were not granted to families, but rather to individuals and 
only diligent research and careful documentation will determine whether you are 
entitled to such. The Augustan Society, P.O. Box P, Torrance, Calif. 
90507-0210, offers a search of coats of arms for a fee of $15. You will need to 
know the name and the primary residency. 
</P>
<P>
The research department of this society will make photocopies of as many 
references as found to arms for individuals bearing the surname you give, but 
it will not undertake to prove your genealogical connection to the individuals 
who have borne the arms of any it locates. 
</P>
<P>
There are several commercial companies that market reproductions of coats of 
arms to Americans. However, just because there is a coat of arms with the same 
surname as yours does not mean that you are related to the person who bore 
those arms.

AIDING THE INNER HEALING OF BURN VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL KORNMAN, Kornman is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten-year-old Damon Kimball does not remember the accident in which his father 
backed over him in the family car, causing injuries that have permanently 
scarred his face and chest. 
</P>
<P>
Damon was only 2 1/2 when the accident occurred. His father, who had a stroke 
and died two years ago, thought that his son was in the back seat when he 
pressed his foot on the accelerator. 
</P>
<P>
Today, after several corrective surgeries and the passage of time, Damon's 
burn-like scars on his left cheek no longer impair his vision or limit the use 
of his mouth. But when he is among strangers, some still stare or point and 
murmur, making it hard for the scars inside to heal fully. 
</P>
<P>
Damon's father was separated from his mother, Pat Kimball, when the accident 
occurred during an outing with two of his three young sons. Somehow, Damon 
survived, with deep-tissue abrasions -- "tire burns" -- over 90% of his face 
and chest. During his hospital stay, the outer layers of his skin were removed 
repeatedly in scrub baths to prevent infection and help the skin to heal 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
For two years, Damon wore a ski mask-like bandage over his head in an attempt 
to reduce the scarring. He also wore a pressure bandage around his chest to 
keep the reddish welts of scar tissue from swelling during the long healing 
process. 
</P>
<P>
"The initial trauma is horrendous," Pat Kimball said recently at the family's 
Granada Hills home. "It follows you forever." 
</P>
<P>
But Damon and his family eventually found some relief from an unexpected 
source. Last year, a representative of the Alisa Ann Ruch California Burn 
Foundation visited Damon's school as part of a public education program 
designed to teach schoolchildren how to prevent burn injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation, which has headquarters in Canoga Park, provides prevention 
programs to schools, businesses and community groups, and services to burn 
survivors and their families throughout the state. It also funds burn care 
research and operates a summer camp at Wonder Valley Ranch, about 30 miles east 
of Fresno, for burn survivors ages 5 to 18. 
</P>
<P>
During the talk at Tulsa Elementary School in Granada Hills, Damon said he 
learned how to "stop, drop and roll" should he catch fire. 
</P>
<P>
Soon afterward, he learned about the ranch. Pat Kimball says a week at summer 
camp last year went a long way to help her son renew his confidence and focus 
on a goal: Damon says he wants to be a member of a police SWAT team when he 
grows up. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation, which operates with a small full-time staff and a large number 
of volunteers, was created in 1971 in the memory of an 8-year-old Southern 
California girl who was fatally burned in a back-yard barbecue fire. It is 
supported solely by contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Although much of the foundation's efforts are aimed at burn prevention and 
helping children, the staff and volunteers also work with adult burn victims, 
their families and even their co-workers to help build understanding and 
cooperation when a burned person returns to work. A similar in-school program 
is conducted to prepare a child's classmates and teachers for an injured 
child's return to school. 
</P>
<P>
After Damon's accident, Kimball said, she did what she could to make sure that 
her son got the medical care he needed. While her marriage foundered, she went 
back to school and got a degree in early childhood education. 
</P>
<P>
When her husband died suddenly two years ago, she filed for bankruptcy and 
began again, moving to Granada Hills from Sepulveda with Damon, Ethan, 14, and 
Justin, 18. She works full time with young disabled children in the Glendale 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Before Damon went to camp, Kimball said she did what she could to be a model 
for her son when they were in public, showing him ways to manage on his own. 
</P>
<P>
"I see you notice my son's scars. We're so lucky he's alive," she would tell 
adults and children who stared at Damon while they were shopping. The 
rehabilitation period was long and painful. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a special education teacher, and I talk to parents all the time about 
their kids' handicaps," Kimball said. "It's a very different story when it's 
your own child." 
</P>
<P>
To be eligible for the camp, children must have sustained burns or burn-like 
injuries. They do not have to be severe. Foundation officials said the most 
important consideration is: Can a child benefit from spending time at camp, 
like other children, swimming, riding horses, playing with go-carts and playing 
games? 
</P>
<P>
"Champ Camp" gives each child a week away from home under medical supervision. 
No one stops and stares; no one asks how or why. "Campers aren't permitted to 
ask about the nature of each other's injuries," said Tom Kiefer, the 
foundation's director of burn services. A registered nurse is on duty 24 hours 
a day. 
</P>
<P>
Although the camp is in a rural setting, the facilities are not rustic. 
"Children with burn injuries must keep their skin especially clean," Kiefer 
said. "All rooms are equipped with showers, and children are monitored by the 
nursing staff to make sure they take proper care of their healing wounds. Those 
who require medications receive them, under supervision and with the child's 
doctor's permission." 
</P>
<P>
The week at camp last summer marked the first time that Damon and his mother 
were separated, and Kimball said she was concerned about sending her son to 
camp with children who had suffered devastating, disfiguring injuries. She was 
afraid that he would "see other kids with limitations and feel a part of this." 
</P>
<P>
But she decided that the potential benefits outweighed the risk that Damon 
would identify himself as disfigured and disabled. "I knew I had a child who 
was very distressed about everything in his life. His father died. We moved. He 
transferred schools. I had a new job." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the week at camp was "the greatest thing that ever happened to 
him," Kimball said. "For one week, he was a little boy who didn't have a scar. 
He didn't have to worry. . . . That experience has sustained him all year. The 
nurses, the firemen at camp are all so understanding." 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters and their wives make up the largest segment of volunteer 
counselors at the camp; they use their special understanding of the trauma of 
burn injuries to help children have fun without being self-conscious. Some 
firefighters return year after year, Kiefer said. 
</P>
<P>
"The experience really helps rebuild a fragmented person," Kimball said. "I'm 
not saying camp solved all his problems, but it gave Damon a chance to depend 
on other people. They enjoyed him for who he is." 
</P>
<P>
Damon says he loved his time at camp and wants to return this summer. Kiefer 
said that although invitations to camp haven't been issued, each year the 
number of campers increases as donated camperships rise. Children who could 
benefit from a return visit do go back, and "Damon will go to camp this summer 
if I have anything to say about it," Kiefer said. 
</P>
<P>
The week at camp ends each year with a trip to Disneyland to help the children 
test the coping skills they learned. 
</P>
<P>
Damon recalls that some people at Disneyland stared at the campers. They 
wouldn't have, though, if they hadn't worn their Champ Camp T-shirts, he said. 
Damon had forgotten about the scars. 
</P>
<P>
Kiefer said Champ Camp, in its fourth year, expects to have 100 youngsters this 
summer, giving children "a week without scars," a "pure camp experience," a 
chance to experience new successes, try new things and meet new people. 
</P>
<P>
The severity of the burn injury is not an issue, Kiefer said. "We're much more 
interested in the child and what the burn means to them." 
</P>
<P>
(In the Los Angeles area, the foundation oversees a support group for adult 
burn survivors and the parents of burn survivors. It meets at Westside 
Pavilion. The foundation refers residents of the San Fernando Valley to Sherman 
Oaks Community Hospital's support group for burn survivors; the foundation 
doesn't attempt to duplicate the hospital's service.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How to Prevent Burns 
</P>
<P>
The Alisa Ann Ruch California Burn Foundation of Canoga Park gives the 
following tips during presentations on burn prevention: 
</P>
<P>
* Cool a burn. Put burned skin under cool water for at least 20 minutes. Use a 
faucet, shower, whatever is handy. Do not use butter, ice or grease. They will 
only further damage tissue. 
</P>
<P>
* Avoid scalds. Most burns are the result of scalds, and most scalds are 
suffered by children. Be careful when cooking or drinking hot liquids. Keep pot 
handles, cups of coffee or tea out of the reach of children. 
</P>
<P>
* Cook with care. Keep children out of the way when cooking. If grease catches 
fire, place a lid over the pan and turn off the burner. Never use water to try 
to extinguish a grease fire. Make sure pot handles are turned toward the back 
of the stove, out of the reach of children. 
</P>
<P>
* Stop, drop and roll. If your clothes catch fire, stop where you are, drop to 
the ground or floor, and roll over and over until the flames are out. 
</P>
<P>
* Install smoke detectors. Install at least one smoke detector on every level 
of your home and one outside each sleeping area. Test them once a month. 
Replace batteries at least once a year, and keep detectors free of dust and 
cobwebs. 
</P>
<P>
* Plan a home escape route. Find two ways out of each room in the house. Make 
special provisions for infants, elderly and disabled members of your family. 
Establish a place outside where everyone will gather. Practice the escape plan 
with all family members. 
</P>
<P>
* Check electrical cords. Replace cords that are frayed or broken. Do not place 
extension cords beneath rugs or carpet where they can be stepped on and broken. 
</P>
<P>
* Turn water heater thermostats down. Most water heaters are set at 170 
degrees. Hot liquid at 150 degrees can cause a third-degree burn in one second. 
Water heaters should be set between low and medium (120 to 130 degrees) to 
prevent scalding. 
</P>
<P>
* Watch out for smokers. If you permit smoking in your home, make sure that 
cigarettes are extinguished in large, deep ashtrays. Empty ashtrays into the 
toilet. Never smoke in bed. 
</P>
<P>
* Be careful with flammable liquids. Use only approved gasoline storage cans. 
Avoid contact with battery acid, hot oil and radiator steam.

ORAL HISTORY REPOSITORY CHRONICLES THE COMMONPLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By R. DANIEL FOSTER, Foster is a Woodland Hills free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James Dodson considers himself an archeologist of ordinary memories. 
</P>
<P>
From recollections of some "old bums" who lived under a lettuce shed to 
memories of building a four-bedroom house for $75, Dodson's oral history 
library at Valley College is a catchall of commonplace life in the San Fernando 
Valley during the first four decades of this century. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to find out what life was like for the average person in the 
Valley," said Dodson, curator of the college's Historical Museum, where the 
library is housed. "I just wanted to know what people ate, what they raised in 
their gardens, what clothes they wore and so on." 
</P>
<P>
Dodson, who lives in La Crescenta, became the museum's volunteer curator -- it 
is financed by private donations -- and started the oral history project in 
1975, after 25 years of teaching history on the Van Nuys campus. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just one of the exhibits here," he said, shying away from mention of his 
age. 
</P>
<P>
Seated in a back room of the museum, Dodson fingered his collection of 70 
audiotapes and glanced at the history around him: a panoramic photograph of the 
Valley taken in 1912, an egg basket from the Lankershim Ranch in North 
Hollywood and wooden mailboxes used by Valley College's first faculty in the 
late 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
Then he turned on the tape recorder. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, my name is Rose Bundy, and I've lived in the Valley since 1923," one 
tape begins. It was recorded in 1977, when the subject was in her 80s. 
</P>
<P>
Bundy chronicles the trials of managing a chicken ranch in North Hollywood on 
the corner of Lankershim and Victory boulevards during the 1920s, '30s and '40s 
and raising rabbits there. During World War II, "we went through the rationing 
period and rabbit wasn't rationed," Bundy recalls. "Well, I could sell rabbits 
before they was born." 
</P>
<P>
Others in Dodson's collection also cite memories of life at the chicken ranch, 
which seemed to be a gathering spot for Valley residents. Dodson interviewed 
one man who remembers playing on the ranch as a boy. 
</P>
<P>
"He used to take a rooster to the top of the silo, tie a sheet to it for a 
parachute and toss the rooster off," Dodson said. "I'll bet that rooster hated 
the sight of that kid." 
</P>
<P>
Dodson finds his subjects, who range in age from 60 to more than 90, through 
associates who know of older residents in the area. They are sent a list of 
questions -- which focus on social life, religion, education and politics, 
among other topics -- a week before Dodson visits their homes. 
</P>
<P>
"The questions help them consider things they haven't thought of in 30 or 40 
years," Dodson said. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Canby, who recorded a tape in 1977, said: "I think I was able to give 
him some information that otherwise would have been lost." 
</P>
<P>
Canby's father, Dr. Charles B. Canby, arrived in Van Nuys in 1918 and became 
the area's third doctor, according to his son, 75, who also practiced medicine. 
</P>
<P>
On his tape, Canby tells of the Los Angeles River when it was a "little, 
meandering creek" that wound through the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to go down there and fish for little minnows and catch crawfish and 
collect butterflies," he says, adding that stands of black walnut, apricot and 
orange trees were once abundant in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Dodson recorded his own tape in 1977 to chronicle early life at Valley College. 
On the tape, he speaks of rival basketball games played between the faculty 
("senior citizens") and the students, calling Mighty Ben McFarland and Walter 
(Long Arms) Coulters among the faculty's better players. 
</P>
<P>
Austin Conover, who once served as Valley College's public information officer, 
said Dodson has been meticulous in assuring that tape transcriptions are 
accurate. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants it absolutely correct," Conover said. "He's done so much for the 
museum. He's recognized that we're all mortal and will pass on. That's why it's 
so important for oral history to be translated." 
</P>
<P>
Dodson hopes that his tapes and transcriptions will be used as reference 
material by future historians. But he would prefer that they listen to the 
tapes before thumbing through transcriptions. 
</P>
<P>
"A careful researcher will want to listen to the sound of a person's voice," 
said Dale Treleven, director of UCLA's oral history program. "In no way can 
there be a one-to-one transfer of inflection, nuance, accent, emphasis and 
irony in a person's voice when reading a transcription." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's oral history program, which began in 1959, is financed by the California 
State Archives Government Oral History Program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Projects 
</P>
<P>
Other oral history projects in the Valley include a library of 30 tapes begun 
by the Conejo Valley Historical Society in 1975. The tapes are kept at the 
Stagecoach Inn Museum in Newbury Park, and copies can be found at the Thousand 
Oaks Library. 
</P>
<P>
The Chatsworth Historical Society began its collection of 21 tapes in 1982. 
They are kept in the archives at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
The San Fernando Valley Historical Society began an oral history project in 
1986 and now has a collection of 12 tapes, which are kept at the Andres Pico 
Adobe museum in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Early Resident 
</P>
<P>
In Valley College's museum, Dodson switched on a tape recorder to listen to one 
of the Valley's earliest residents. 
</P>
<P>
"My name is Lillian Rockwell Van Winkle. I've lived in the Valley since 1918," 
she begins. The voice cracks with 91 years of age, on a tape that was recorded 
in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
"I came to the San Fernando Hotel and lived and had my meals at Mother Van 
Winkle's, who had lived here since 1887. I taught in the Mexican quarter." 
</P>
<P>
Van Winkle pauses, then sighs deeply as she recalls her first view of the 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a beautiful open valley, lovely stretches of beauty to me," she says. 
"It was a joy. . . . It was heaven -- literally."

THE NEW: FLOWER POWER REDUX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Get out your daisy chain and petal on down to your nearest boutique because the 
daisy -- as a fashion statement -- is showing up in a big way on hats, in pins, 
earrings, and on prints for dresses, camisoles, blouses, pants and skirts. 
</P>
<P>
"The daisy is a very big thing this spring," says Teddy Tsatzkes, owner of Body 
in Sherman Oaks. "We have hats with fake daisies on them, and the top of the 
hat is covered with silk. Almost every girl who walks in here has fainted when 
she's seen the hats because they're so gorgeous," says Tsatzkes, who sells the 
hats for $50. 
</P>
<P>
At Kean's, also in Sherman Oaks, manager Renee Kean says the flower is getting 
a lot of power in prints. "It's kind of a '60s look," says Kean, whose 
daisy-printed clothes range from $84 to $158. "We do a lot of the daisy print 
in rayons, chiffons and cotton. It's a black background with a very bright 
yellow daisy print." 
</P>
<P>
Some of Kean's customers are wild or daring enough to wear a complete daisy 
ensemble, but most women are choosing a daisy-covered camisole or halter top as 
an accent piece. "Although we have sold the outfit together, most people are 
choosing a daisy camisole with, say, the solid black jersey skirt," Kean says. 
</P>
<P>
Some customers are dizzied by the daisies. "People say, 'Oh, look! Are those 
really coming back?' They say, 'It's the '60s. Look, remember that?' " she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Daisy Mae would be proud.

LIFE IN THE TV PRESSURE COOKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NIKKI FINKE and DIANE HAITHMAN, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kim Le Masters calls it "the civilian equivalent of war." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Silverman calls it "a constant merry-go-round." 
</P>
<P>
Tony Thomopoulos calls it "a terrific opportunity for anyone to have." 
</P>
<P>
Brandon Stoddard just called it quits. 
</P>
<P>
The unexpected resignation of the ABC Entertainment president Tuesday served to 
put the spotlight on one of the most powerful yet pressure-packed jobs in the 
entertainment industry -- the television networks' chief programmers, whose 
responsibility it is to try to satisfy not only their medium's insatiable 
appetite for thousands of hours of television shows a year but also their 
bosses' constant hunger for bigger ratings and even bigger profits. 
</P>
<P>
But is the job itself satisfying? Stoddard, ultimately, decided no. 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that "it's been a joy and a privilege in the last 19 years 
as a broadcaster to put television shows on the air that hundreds of millions 
of people have enjoyed and learned from," the 51-year-old executive concluded 
that along with the power came too much frustration and aggravation. In short, 
he said, "it's just no fun anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Stoddard, who has been at ABC since 1970 and will remain there as president of 
its in-house production division, said that the job is more difficult now than 
ever before because of the "new realities" of network television, in which 
audiences and profits are harder to come by as the competition for cable TV, 
independent stations and videocassette recorders increases. 
</P>
<P>
Past and present programming chiefs agree. 
</P>
<P>
"I know exactly what he's talking about," said Kim LeMasters, president of CBS 
Entertainment for the past year. "There are days when it looks so dark and 
gloomy that it's not fun to even get out of bed." 
</P>
<P>
And Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBC Entertainment since 1981, admitted 
Wednesday that, "If you catch me on the wrong Tuesday in February, I'd complain 
far worse than Brandon Stoddard did in the press about how hard these jobs are. 
It does get to you. But the thing that gets you into your car early in the 
morning is some of the shows you work on and some of the people you get to work 
with." 
</P>
<P>
With all this complaining, it's hard to believe that Martin Starger, who was 
head of programming at ABC from 1970-1975, recalls that he didn't feel that way 
at all. "I never thought of it as horrendous. Not at all. It was very exciting 
for me. I have to say I had fun," he said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Starger was quick to admit, however, that his tenure "was a little different in 
those days than it is now. I don't know if it was worse. But it was a different 
world in the sense that in the '70s there were three networks in competition 
with one another and you programmed only against your two competitors. Cable 
was still in its infancy, and videocassette was a phrase that no one used at 
that time. Now, the competition is a lot more than two networks." 
</P>
<P>
Another difference, Starger noted, is the fact that as an executive he probably 
had more autonomy than his counterparts today (when it is reported that even 
CBS Inc. president Laurence Tisch sometimes overrules his executives on 
programming decisions). 
</P>
<P>
"The people I worked for rarely interfered with the programming department's 
recommendations," recalled Starger, now president of Marstar Productions. 
"Sure, there were the usual problems with budgets and money. But never 
autonomy." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the programming departments themselves were smaller and less 
bureaucratic. "They were very vital, very exciting places to work, with 
one-third and one-fourth the executives that networks have now," said Starger, 
whose staff included Barry Diller (now chairman of Fox Inc.) and Michael Eisner 
(now chairman of Disney). "I think that's part of the frustration." 
</P>
<P>
Another change has been the increasing attention that the news media has paid 
to television and its top entertainment executives. 
</P>
<P>
Fame has its price, LeMasters noted. Now, instead of journalists simply 
reporting that a CBS or ABC program failed, "we hear that it was Kim LeMasters' 
dumb idea, or Brandon Stoddard's dumb idea -- and that does wear and tear on 
you." 
</P>
<P>
"The job is more identified with the person, or the personality of the guy who 
runs the entertainment division," he said. "The irony of ironies is that, 
although we who run the division may want to think we are the Il Duce, we all 
work off committees. But people can be quite vicious, and if you have any 
sensitivity at all, it plays on you." 
</P>
<P>
Tony Thomopoulos, president of ABC Entertainment from 1978 to 1982, pinpointed 
the start of the fame game as 1975, when Fred Silverman jumped from CBS to ABC 
and landed on the cover of Time magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"When he went on the cover of Time, the whole function of the job changed," he 
recalled Wednesday. "Before, we'd gotten exposure within the entertainment 
community but never on a national basis. All of a sudden we were media figures 
rather than just guys or gals doing a job." 
</P>
<P>
And with the new interest in the personalities of the executives came a new 
interest in the work they did. "All of a sudden, the ratings games became a way 
of life not only for industry people but for the general audience. Just pick up 
a newspaper and you can find Nielsen overnights. For many people, it's like 
reading the box scores in sports." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Shephard, who was senior vice president of programs at CBS from 1980 to 
1986, called this phenomenon "one of the great spectator sports in our country. 
Even my father in New York one day said to me, 'Boy, did you bomb on Tuesday 
nights!' "$ 
</P>
<P>
NBC's Tartikoff said he only recently has found a way to deal with being 
written about -- he's now reading a book byt Richard Nixon instead of reviews 
by The Times' Howard Rosenberg. "I've adapted a little bit," he shrugged. "I 
don't read everything I get my hands on anymore." 
</P>
<P>
One thing that hasn't changed about being programming chief over the years is 
the hours it requires. All 24 of them. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing about the job is that it never ends. You solve one problem and 
three more take its place," lamented Fred Silverman, who was head of 
programming for CBS from 1970 to 1975 and then president of ABC Entertainment 
from 1975 to 1978. "You're living to work instead of working to live." 
</P>
<P>
Silverman recalled with horror those days of the constantly ringing phone and 
the constantly filled appointment calendar. "Once," he said, "I was flying on a 
plane to somewhere, and a (program) supplier bought a seat on the flight so he 
could sit next to me and sell a show." 
</P>
<P>
Thomopoulos agreed: "It's the kind of job that, to do it properly, you must 
live, breathe and sleep with it. The sheer magnitude of it becomes all 
time-consuming." 
</P>
<P>
Another is the constant pressure created by having that "report card" of 
ratings follow you day in and day out. 
</P>
<P>
Shephard, now president of Warner Bros. Television, recalled said that even for 
the five years when CBS was No. 1, "People would say you must enjoy it, but in 
reality, you couldn't. It was expected that the following year, you would have 
to repeat that success, and you couldn't even look to weekends to unwind and 
relax, because there was no hiding from the ratings." 
</P>
<P>
Thomopoulos, former president of United Artists, believes the stress is greater 
in television than in motion pictures because of the ever-present Nielsens. "In 
the final analysis, you're also judged by the quality of the product and the 
box office results. But it comes in better intervals so you have time to 
regroup." 
</P>
<P>
Given all this, the burn-out factor associated with the job is considered high 
by most standards. LeMasters, for instance, said that while he wants to "savor 
this for awhile," he knows that in three years' time he'll be looking in the 
mirror "to see if the psychological damage is too great, or can I stand some 
more and go on from there." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, he noted, "people would argue that in my case it was six months." 
</P>
<P>
Tartikoff, for his part, admitted that being programming chief is "like 
relationships -- you fall in and out of love." 
</P>
<P>
So what keeps him going? "I think that what you've got to have motivating you 
at all times are two things. One, you've got to have a love for the medium of 
TV. And, two, you've got to have some sort of vision that you're hoping to 
accomplish, and if you accomplish that vision, you're leaving it a better 
place." 
</P>
<P>
Stoddard did all that, but still the job began to close in on him. "Frankly," 
he said, "it's like swimming faster and faster in a pond that's getting smaller 
and smaller." 
</P>
<P>
What happened to Stoddard might have been similar to what Silverman felt in the 
final analysis. "You turn around one day and say, 'A piece of my life is gone 
and there isn't a hell of a lot to show for it.' "

The largest audience for a single episode of a series in Italy tuned into the 
finale of "La Piovra" ("The Octopus") this week and watched as a beloved 
anti-Mafia police commissioner was assassinated. A record 17.2 million 
Italians, nearly 60% of the TV viewing audience, saw the TV hero, Corrado 
Cattani, walk out of a Milan hospital and fall victim to 70 rounds of 
ammunition from Mafia killers' guns. Though fans protested the death (one 
threatened suicide if the character was killed off), Michele Placido, the actor 
who played the part for four seasons, was not upset. "I couldn't bear the 
thought of doing another season. I'm glad Cattani is dead, for me it's a 
rebirth," said Placido, who wants to move on to other projects. "La Piovra" 
will be back for a fifth season, with a tough and beautiful anti-Mafia judge 
swearing revenge. ALEENE MacMINN

Look for a parade of real-life TV journalists to shmooze with CBS' "Murphy 
Brown" soon. Linda Ellerbee comes to town Monday to tape an episode for this 
season. "And Walter Cronkite is committed to doing a show next season," 
promised show creator Diane English at a Museum of Broadcasting salute to the 
new hit series Tuesday night at the County Museum of Art. Murphy alter ego 
Candice Bergen also will be visiting with Kathleen Sullivan and Phil Donohue 
next season.ALEENE MacMINN

With Connie Chung headed for CBS News, NBC News executives plan to use the 
$900,000 they've been paying her to hire three "seasoned correspondents," 
possibly one in New York and two in Washington bureau. An NBC official said the 
network decided to let Chung go rather than meet her demands, which included 
complete editorial control over a new prime-time news magazine program, the 
right to name her own executive producer, assurance that she would be its sole 
anchor and a significantly higher salary. At CBS, she'll take over as anchor of 
"West 57th." ALEENE MacMINN

Three more shows have been added for Neil Diamond's upcoming stand at the 
Forum. With the first three concerts (June 28-30) having sold out within three 
hours, additional shows were added for July 5-7, and there may be more to come. 
In 1983, Diamond's seven-night stay at the Forum sold-out just as quickly.

'TROOP': THE RICH WERE NEVER THIS LOVABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "Troop Beverly Hills" (citywide), Shelley Long plays the Beverly Hills ditz 
as secular saint. Her hair is a flaming mass of just-out-of-bed baby-doll salon 
curls, her eyes twinkle with elfin lust. After a while, dipped into one 
cheerfully grotesque Theodora Van Runkle costume after another, she looks both 
nutty and scrumptious, like a human fruit fondue. 
</P>
<P>
Long is cast as Phyllis Nefler: a Beverly Hills housewife with a name that 
vaguely suggests "Double Indemnity" and a mania for Rodeo Drive shopping. 
Phyllis' muffler-salesman husband (Craig T. Nelson) is leaving her in disgust 
and her daughter is part of a notorious troop of failed scouts, or "Wilderness 
Girls," whom Phyllis, in another attack of dilettantism -- like her former 
enthusiasms for saving whales or Jane Fonda's workouts -- has agreed to head. 
</P>
<P>
If you know the rules of this kind of movie game, you know immediately that: 
</P>
<P>
a) Phyllis' girls will be eccentric but lovable, cutie-pie cliches just like 
Phyllis herself. 
</P>
<P>
b) Phyllis will take them on eccentric but lovable adventures, shot in pricey 
locales. 
</P>
<P>
c) Phyllis will have an opposing martinet (Betty Thomas as the insidious butch 
madwoman Velda Plendor), who will stop at nothing to humiliate her and drive 
her girls out of the Wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
Also: 
</P>
<P>
d) Everybody will wind up loving Phyllis to pieces and loving her girls to 
pieces, and everyone's family problems -- including the dictator's daughter -- 
will get straightened out and, more than likely, Phyllis will wind up back 
again with her husband, who will love her to pieces too. (Love. Ain't it 
wonderful!) 
</P>
<P>
e) Hopefully, we in the audience, would-be Wilderness Girls or not, will emerge 
happier, wiser and, like Phyllis, ready for the next shopping spree. 
</P>
<P>
f) While all this is going on, and while the speedy, gorgeous Shelley is 
zipping and stripping from one Van Runkle creation to the next (What a mad, 
whirling little fashion dervish she is!) we will be forced to see and hear more 
bad jokes than we would have thought humanly possible. 
</P>
<P>
What can you say about a movie that purports to satirize, however gently, the 
life styles of the rich and jaded, and winds up dragging in Robin Leach, Pia 
Zadora and a charity fashion show? What about a high concept which wants us to 
react to these super-rich children as if they were waifs besieged by an evil 
world of K mart-crazed bullies and sadists? What market researcher dreamed up 
this mix of lewd slapstick and smarmy sentimentality? Are we really expected to 
reflect on poignant pauses in the acting career of Edd (Kookie) Byrnes? Wonder 
what preposterous new gown lissome Long will peel into next? 
</P>
<P>
Part of this movie is like a sermon against greed delivered by a preacher in a 
snakeskin tuxedo with a diamond-studded cummerbund. Do we believe his oratory 
or his couturier? 
</P>
<P>
"Troop Beverly Hills" has been very gaudily well-dressed -- by Van Runkle and 
Hitchcock's frequent production designer Richard Boyle -- and director Jeff 
Kanew ("Revenge of the Nerds") gives it a little phony gloss and zip. Kanew is 
good at grotesque stage business, and he's encouraged Long into a symphony of 
dizzy ditz-shtick. Long is an actress who can't throw away a line -- though 
this is one case where she should have thrown away the whole script. But she 
gets points for sheer, daffy energy and rampaging pulchritude. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Mary Gross, who recently has been amusing in movies where 
almost everyone else seemed to be sinking in a sea of flop sweat ("The Couch 
Trip," "Feds") has been handed a tailor-made Mary Gross part, but with no 
jokes. It's a technical challenge you wouldn't wish on Meryl Streep; Gross is 
finally reduced to showing off her cleavage in a pink tutu, while Long does 
bellyflops in the swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
"Troop Beverly Hills" (rated PG, despite much bawdy innuendo) was based 
partially on the reminiscences of its producer, Ava Ostern Fries, once a

STAGE WATCH : UNRULY SCENE AT BOX OFFICE UPSETS TICKET BUYERS FOR 'PHANTOM'; 
THEATERS' PAY-WHAT-YOU-CAN POLICIES ARE GROWING IN POPULARITY 
</P>

<P>
Fans of the "Phantom" are out in full force this week. 
</P>
<P>
The opening of the "Phantom of the Opera" box office on Monday, at the Ahmanson 
Theatre and at Ticketron locations, brought them out of the woodwork. Total 
"Phantom" sales for the first day reached $894,273 for 18,182 tickets, and 
another $275,734 was paid for tickets by noon Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
When prior telephone and mail order sales are added to these figures, the 
"Phantom" advance has reached $13 million -- and counting. The show doesn't 
begin previews until May 18. 
</P>
<P>
But not everything is A-OK in "Opera"-land. 
</P>
<P>
Later, interviews with some of the people who weathered the first-day line 
indicated that many were stil fuming. 
</P>
<P>
"I represent hundreds of us who are infuriated," declared Michael Smith, a 
would-be ticket buyer from Hollywood. "A mass of scalpers butted into line, 
causing such congestion that the line just wasn't moving." And he was as angry 
at the management as he was at the brokers: "There was very lax security. I 
thought there would be a riot." 
</P>
<P>
"The brokers were very effective in getting around whatever rudimentary devices 
we had to keep the lines orderly," conceded Music Center coordinator Roger 
Parrell. "They were able to coerce, cajole or otherwise intimidate the others 
in line." 
</P>
<P>
When Parrell arrived 45 minutes before the scheduled 7 a.m. opening of the box 
office Monday, he found the first part of the line (which had begun forming 
Saturday) dominated by "150 to 200 fairly young people, not well dressed, not 
what we would consider normal theatergoers. They had partied and been there all 
night long." 
</P>
<P>
Parrell asserted that the young people were working for brokers "who may not 
have had seeing the show uppermost in their minds -- I'm understating this -- 
but who had dollar signs in their eyes." 
</P>
<P>
The lack of interest in "Phantom" by some of the young people in line also was 
noted by Noah Alexander, who had waited in the line since early Sunday. During 
the night, said Alexander, someone turned on a "Phantom" tape and was greeted 
with hoots from others in line. "God, I can't stand that kind of music!" 
shouted one of the would-be ticket buyers. 
</P>
<P>
One guard, who declined to identify himself, said he observed a child, whose 
head barely reached the ticket counter, paying $400 for eight tickets. 
</P>
<P>
The brokers themselves were obvious, said Parrell: "People carrying cellular 
phones, pagers, large amounts of cash. There was no attempt at subterfuge." 
</P>
<P>
Buying tickets for later off-the-premises resale by licensed brokers is not 
illegal. But what upset the more conventional ticket buyers were the attempts 
to buy more than the eight tickets permitted to each purchaser. 
</P>
<P>
Upon witnessing one shirtless youth attempt to rejoin the line, some of those 
who had been waiting for hours started chanting "Out! Out! Out!" The offender 
was ejected from the line -- but only after a woman pleaded with a nearby 
security guard to take action. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 12 private security officers and county and city police officers 
monitored the line at any one time Monday, and employees of the Ahmanson and 
the Music Center also tried to spot those who were cutting in or talking their 
way back into the line for another chance at buying tickets. About 20 
individuals were ousted from the line, Parrell said. 
</P>
<P>
But Parrell also said he had heard of brokers' claims that they had paid guards 
to look the other way. The security agency that employs the guards is 
investigating such claims, he said. However, a spokesman for the firm said 
supervisory personnel observed the guards Monday and "we're confident that our 
officers were not involved in any exchange of money for preference in line." 
</P>
<P>
Parrell added that "Ahmanson authorities unfortunately rejected my suggestion 
for a numbering system," in which everyone in the line would have been issued a 
number. "Of course some of the people might have tried to purchase numbers," he 
acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
"We hadn't anticipated the numbers who would show up," responded Ahmanson 
general manager Ellen Fay. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another attempt to check the flow of tickets to brokers occurred 
away from the line. From the computer, Fay noticed that one of the Ticketron 
outlets that also began selling "Phantom" tickets on Monday "was doing 
gangbusters business in a short period of time." Suspicious that this outlet 
was selling more than the four tickets per customer permitted by Ticketron, Fay 
removed that outlet's access to "Phantom" tickets. Access was restored several 
hours later after a Ticketron investigation revealed no violation of the rules, 
but Fay remains suspicious: "I would not want this outlet to sell our next 
(show)," she said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Another sign of "Phantom" mania was a classified ad that appeared this week, 
offering two orchestra tickets for May 18, "the first night" of "Phantom" 
(actually the first preview; the opening is May 31) for $5,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
When contacted at her Arizona telephone number, the seller said she was not a 
broker. She had bought the $50 tickets for the May 18 performance for herself, 
she said, but then realized she couldn't use them. She had heard of Super Bowl 
tickets selling for $8,000 and "these should be more valuable than tickets to 
the Super Bowl. This is probably the greatest show since 'My Fair Lady'." 
</P>
<P>
REVERSE SCALPING: Ticket prices can deviate downward, as well as upward, from 
the fixed rate. Recently, the Mark Taper Forum joined La Jolla Playhouse in 
establishing a "Pay What You Can" policy for selected performances. Ticket 
buyers get to choose how much they'll pay. 
</P>
<P>
At La Jolla, where normal ticket prices range from $18 to $28, every seat in 
the house is sold on a pay-what-you-can basis for one Saturday matinee per 
production. There have been 10 such performances in the past two seasons, and 
the payments have ranged from 25 cents to $18. In 1987, the average 
pay-what-you-can ticket price was $4.25; in 1988 it dropped to $2.28. The show 
that drew the most money on this basis was "A Walk in the Woods"; "The Fool 
Show" took in the least. 
</P>
<P>
There will be six such performances at La Jolla in 1989; information is at 
(619) 534-3960. 
</P>
<P>
The Taper, where tickets usually cost $20 to $26, releases 100 pay-what-you-can 
tickets at one or two performances of each mainstage production, including the 
Friday and Sunday evening performances of "Sansei" this week. Pay-what-you-can 
tickets to "Sansei" were virtually sold out at press time. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the average ticket price chosen for "Sansei" was $3.44. The range of 
prices extended from 25 cents to $10. This contrasts with an average of $2.91, 
and a range of three cents to $11, paid for "Dutch Landscape," the first Taper 
show offered as part of this program. Information on future Taper 
pay-what-you-can performances: (213) 972-7373. 
</P>
<P>
South Coast Repertory and the Pasadena Playhouse are considering 
pay-what-you-can policies. Said South Coast marketing director John Mouledoux: 
"Obviously somebody in a seat is better than a seat that's empty." 
</P>
<P>
But representatives of the Old Globe and Los Angeles Theatre Center said no 
pay-what-you-can plans are being considered. All of the theaters cited an array 
of discounts already offered -- to students, seniors, last-minute buyers, union 
members, groups. The Old Globe reported that it sometimes gives free tickets to 
special interest groups and charities, within one or two days of the 
performance -- when it's apparent that the house won't sell out.

JUDGE AWAITS VERDICT ON OSCAR TICKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Call it the Case of the Disappointed Jurist. Or, the Case of the Confusing 
Telephone Calls. Either way, here it is just six days to Oscar, and one of the 
most famous judges in America -- "People's Court" Judge Joseph Wapner -- can't 
seem to get in on the show. 
</P>
<P>
All the retired Superior Court judge -- whose show is the basis of a running 
gag in the front runner "Rain Man" -- wanted, it seems, was some tickets to 
Wednesday's show. But, as is often the case of getting on the A list in 
Hollywood, it's not a case of who you know, but who knows you. 
</P>
<P>
When Oscars show producer Allan Carr was told earlier this week that he had a 
call from a representative of Judge Wapner, Carr, who says he doesn't watch 
much daytime TV, thought he had a legal problem on his hands. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked, 'Why, are one of my couples having matrimonial problems?' I thought 
he wanted to be a consultant in case of a domestic tiff over the weekend," Carr 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But there was some confusion in Carr's office. An assistant to the producer was 
told that Wapner had been so taken by Dustin Hoffman's repeated references to 
him in "Rain Man," that he thought the Oscars might want him around to perform 
in the event. Carr politely declined. 
</P>
<P>
"My case rests on Judge Wapner," Carr said. "It's plain and simple. I don't 
think he's a member of the Screen Actors Guild. I don't think he's been 
nominated for anything." 
</P>
<P>
But Eddy Jo Bernal, a publicist for Wapner's program, said that the judge 
merely wanted tickets to attend the Oscars show -- not be in it. He had 
mentioned it to a Warner Bros. representative at a recent television 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody at Warner misinterpreted and went to Carr and asked if he could be on 
the show," Bernal said. "That's not what the judge wanted at all. He's not a 
star, he's a judge. 
</P>
<P>
"He just wanted to be in the audience and he admires Dustin Hoffman's work." 
</P>
<P>
As of Wednesday, Wapner still hadn't made the A list.

VENTURA JUDGE TO DECIDE IF DNA HOLDS UP IN COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Law enforcement officials in California are awaiting the decision of a Ventura 
Superior Court judge on whether to allow evidence from a new and controversial 
scientific technique called DNA "fingerprinting" into a murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
Although courts in 13 states have admitted evidence from the technique, no 
California court has done so. If Judge Lawrence Storch decides to admit the 
evidence, his decision would set a precedent for other courts in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury wants to use the technique to 
establish the identity of the person who fatally stabbed George White, a 
63-year-old handyman, last year at a Ventura hamburger stand. 
</P>
<P>
Storch ordered the hearing, which began Monday, to determine whether DNA test 
results are sufficiently accurate to allow as evidence. Because of the 
complexity of the case and the difficulty in scheduling testimony from 
scientific experts, the hearing is expected to continue into April. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing has drawn prosecutors and defense attorneys from outside Ventura 
County as spectators. They are preparing for trials in which DNA fingerprinting 
may be sought as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
DNA, which stands for deoxyribonucleic acid, is found in the cells of human 
tissue, such as blood, hair, skin or semen. Scientists say they can translate 
the extremely intricate genetic makeup of tissue into DNA patterns that 
resemble supermarket bar codes. The chances of two people having the same DNA 
structure are more than a billion to one, said Carol J. Nelson, the senior 
deputy district attorney who is prosecuting the first-degree murder case 
against Lynda Axell, 34. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County prosecutors have spent a year preparing for the hearing and are 
flying in molecular biologists and other experts from around the country. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be nothing spared," Bradbury said. "It's important that a 
significant foundation be laid so that the admissibility of DNA be unassailable 
on appeal." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Richard Roberts, a molecular biologist who is assistant director for 
research at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, testified that the DNA 
patterns from hair belonging to Axell identically matched the DNA patterns from 
15 hairs found at Top Hat Burger after White's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
The Harvard-trained biologist also testified that DNA fingerprinting is used 
regularly in genetic research. 
</P>
<P>
White was killed on Feb. 24, 1988. Axell, who worked at a costume shop on the 
same block and has admitted that she is a crack addict, was allegedly linked to 
the crime by a police informant. She has maintained her innocence and sits 
quietly, dressed in white, as the hearing inches forward. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, San Diego defense attorney Patricia W. Robinson took notes. She 
said she is preparing for a death penalty case in which the prosecution is 
seeking to introduce DNA evidence that purportedly would link her client to a 
San Diego murder. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, the prosecution is trying to introduce such evidence based on one 
hair, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I question the methods, and the way the sample is stored and if it's 
destroyed. This technology is just too new," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
At times, the Ventura courtroom resembled a high school biology class as the 
molecular biologists explained such terms as loci, restriction enzymes, the 
twinned DNA helix and electrophoresis. 
</P>
<P>
In the typing process, DNA is extracted from the cells, cut into fragments by 
an enzyme and separated into bands using electrophoresis -- a well-established 
procedure that scatters the DNA with an electric current. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting DNA pattern is transferred onto a nylon membrane. X-ray film and 
radioactive chemicals that bind with specific DNA sequences are then applied to 
make the bands visible to the naked eye. These bands, which record DNA patterns 
that are different for each individual, are known as the DNA fingerprint. 
</P>
<P>
The test was developed in 1985 by Alec Jeffreys, a geneticist at the University 
of Leicester in England. It was first used in a celebrated British case in 
which a Leicester-area baker named Colin Pitchfork was 
</P>
<P>
found guilty of raping and strangling two 15-year-old girls. That case is the 
subject of a new book, "The Blooding," by ex-policeman and best-selling writer 
Joseph Wambaugh. 
</P>
<P>
Willard P. Wiksell, one of Axell's two court-appointed attorneys, said he 
believes that the scientific procedure has "a number of flaws." 
</P>
<P>
"The day has not yet arrived when you can look at a hair found on the floor and 
say it came from a specific individual," Wiksell said. He compared DNA 
technology to lie detector tests and voice analysis machines, which have been 
disallowed in many courts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a brand-new procedure. It just hasn't had the scrutiny, and most of the 
people who are in favor of it have a financial interest in it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He and James M. Farley, Axell's other attorney, said they plan to call their 
own experts to discredit Nelson's experts. 
</P>
<P>
The defense, which is not cross-examining the prosecution witnesses this week, 
has asked for more time to research the case. The attorneys have received 
Storch's approval to cross-examine Nelson's experts in their labs, which are in 
Berkeley, Washington and New York. The testimony will be recorded both by a 
video camera and a court stenographer. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing will then reconvene in Ventura. The defense will play the 
videotaped evidence for Storch, call its own witnesses and join Nelson in 
closing arguments. Only then will the judge issue his decision. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, law enforcement officials in California are already hailing the 
technique. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the most significant development since fingerprints," Bradbury said. "It 
retains our life codes. It's proof beyond any possible doubt." 
</P>
<P>
State Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp has called DNA a major breakthrough in 
crime-solving. 
</P>
<P>
A second trial involving DNA fingerprinting is expected to start next month in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Charges were filed against 41-year-old rape and burglary suspect Danny Harris 
after DNA tests allegedly matched tissue found at the crime scene with his 
tissue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DNA FINGERPRINTING 
</P>
<P>
DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is found in cells of human tissue such as blood, 
hair, skin or semen. Scientists say the genetic makeup of tissue can be 
translated into intricate DNA patterns, and the chances of two people having 
identical DNA structure are more than a billion to one.

NORWALK ALLOCATES FUNDS FOR FIX-UP, ANTI-GANG EFFORTS 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday voted unanimously to provide more than $400,000 in 
federal grant money to fund programs to combat gangs and spruce up 
neighborhoods and commercial buildings in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The action came two weeks after the council approved a mid-year budget that 
reassessed Norwalk's financial condition and anticipated reorganizing some city 
programs to better serve the community. The council deferred or eliminated 
funding for several programs, including one that provided subsidized loans to 
renovate the interiors of local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The council allocated $100,000 to develop a program to combat gangs in Norwalk. 
The city has eight gangs with about 2,500 members, said Sgt. Al Grotefend, who 
heads the anti-gang detail in the Sheriff's Department's Norwalk substation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Activity on Rise 
</P>
<P>
Gang activity is on the rise, contributing to crime and graffiti problems in 
Norwalk, said Ernie Garcia, deputy city manager for community services. 
</P>
<P>
Grotefend said the crimes are usually vandalism and assaults on other gang 
members, but have included an occasional drive-by shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact we've doubled in gangs in the last couple of years makes it (the 
anti-gang program) very important," said Mayor Marcial (Rod) Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
The council must still give final approval to a specific anti-gang program, 
which is expected to use neighborhood counselors to steer youths toward jobs 
and recreational activities, Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cooperate With Schools 
</P>
<P>
The city also hopes to work with the Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District 
and the Little Lake City School District to educate third-grade students about 
the dangers of gang involvement, Garcia said. Norwalk officials also will 
consider providing funds to bring the Sheriff's Department's drug and alcohol 
abuse program for fifth-grade students into the Norwalk and La Mirada schools. 
Little Lake, which includes a portion of Norwalk, already has the program. 
</P>
<P>
The city hopes to have a gang program in full operation by September, Garcia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said he has received reports that fourth- and fifth-grade students have 
joined gangs. "We're finding out from the school district that younger and 
younger kids are getting involved in gangs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The council also allocated $130,000 to improve Norwalk's program to encourage 
residents to maintain their properties. The Mr. SUN (Spruce Up Norwalk) program 
was created in April, 1987, to promote maintenance by giving awards to the 
owners of the best-kept homes and yards. The program's budget for the current 
fiscal year is $3,000, said Jeffrey A. Bruyn, deputy city manager for community 
development. 
</P>
<P>
While the specifics of the new Mr. SUN program also must be approved, the money 
allocated Tuesday night will probably be spent to purchase materials such as 
paint for low- and moderate-income residents, and to deliver and pick up 
dumpsters for all residents who are cleaning up their yards, Bruyn said. The 
city also plans to organize a volunteer force to provide labor to help elderly 
and disabled residents fix up their homes. The program is for house and yard 
maintenance and does not provide for extensive structural repairs, Bruyn said. 
</P>
<P>
The other major reallocation adds $175,000 to a city program that provides 
grants for the exterior renovation of commercial buildings in several areas of 
the city. The program's budget was $120,000, Bruyn said. 
</P>
<P>
The city reallocated the money for the new and existing programs from others 
that had not yet been started, and those that generated little participation. 
</P>
<P>
About $50,000 was freed by eliminating the program that provided subsidized 
loans for interior renovation of commercial buildings. Bruyn said no property 
owners had applied for the loans in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
Another $130,000 was federal grant money set aside to install street lights in 
a residential area bounded by the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5), Firestone Boulevard, 
San Antonio Drive and Pioneer Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The city also took $21,000 of $30,000 that had been budgeted to build curb 
ramps for wheelchairs on city sidewalks. Bruyn told the council that, based on 
current progress, the city would be able to build only $9,000 worth of ramps 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Bruyn said the council could consider re-funding those programs if need be with 
future grant money. 
</P>
<P>
No residents or business owners spoke in opposition to the funding cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The city received $1.2 million in federal Community Development Block Grant 
funds for 1988-89 and expects to receive $1.5 million next year. The fiscal 
year runs from July 1 to June 30. 
</P>
<P>
City officials fear some of the federal grant money may dry up in 1990-91. If 
that happens, new funding would have to be found or programs would have to be 
scaled back, City Manager Richard R. Powers said. But the anti-gang program 
would probably be protected. 
</P>
<P>
"The gang program is so critical, we'd just have to make adjustments," Powers 
said.

LOW-INCOME FAMILIES FACE RELOCATION IF SHELTER OKD

James and Scherry Moore know what it's like to be homeless. Evicted from their 
Oxnard apartment, they spent four years living in an 18-foot camper, seeking 
refuge in state parks and struggling to feed their three children from 
on-again, off-again work in Ventura oil fields. 
</P>
<P>
Without the Social Security checks their 8-year-old son received in 1986 after 
undergoing complicated heart surgery, there would have been no way for the 
family to finally leave their camper and return to apartment life.

The old De Anza Hotel on Ventura Avenue turned out to be far from luxury 
quarters and today, at $550 for a one-bedroom apartment, not all that 
inexpensive. But it represented stability for the Moores, who soon learned that 
Scherry was suffering from cancer. 
</P>
<P>
That's why this hard-luck family cannot understand why anyone would want to 
force them from their refuge to convert the building into a shelter for the 
homeless. Even though they and the other low-income residents of the De Anza's 
14 units have been told that they will be compensated, the idea strikes Scherry 
Moore as painfully ironic. 
</P>
<P>
"I finally got my house and my home and my life as I want it," she said, 
sitting in a living room decorated with Easter bunnies, inspirational sayings 
and a rifle propped in the corner. "Now they're kicking us out to make room for 
the homeless? That's a dirty deal." 
</P>
<P>
But for two nonprofit agencies, each with more than a decade of serving Ventura 
County's poor, it is an ambitious plan that will ultimately benefit people such 
as the Moores. 
</P>
<P>
Project Understanding and Cabrillo Economic Development Corp. have launched 
efforts to raise $1.7 million to buy the hotel and use it to shelter the 
growing number of families joining the ranks of the county's estimated 2,000 
homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
The project -- which faces daunting economic hurdles, public hearings and 
scrutiny from city officials before it can be approved -- envisions the top two 
floors of the three-story building divided into 21 rooms with a total of 84 
beds. The first floor would become a center for social service agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Present residents would receive about $4,800 in relocation compensation per 
apartment, which leaders of the two agencies say would probably be sufficient 
to land them in at least equal, if not much improved, living conditions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tide of Gentrification 
</P>
<P>
And in the process, both Project Understanding and Cabrillo hope that the 
shelter will help slow the tide of gentrification that is sweeping the Ventura 
Avenue area. Any other buyer of the building, they say, would probably raise 
rents and drive out most residents anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though it's unfortunate that we have to displace a few families, in the 
long run it will be a benefit to the avenue as a whole," said Rodney Fernandez, 
executive director of Cabrillo, which has built several housing projects for 
low-income farm workers. "We're trying to make a statement with this project." 
</P>
<P>
The project's fate, however, could depend almost entirely on how the Ventura 
City Council chooses to divvy up $238,000 in funds that have been earmarked to 
help the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The De Anza shelter is one of four proposals being considered by city 
officials. Without a large chunk of the money, it would be nearly impossible to 
get the state and federal funds necessary to buy the $855,000 building and to 
pay for the extensive earthquake-proofing it requires, Fernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Don Villeneuve, a member of the city's affordable housing 
subcommittee, which is preparing to make a recommendation on spending the 
money, said it was unrealistic for Project Understanding or Cabrillo to expect 
a hefty grant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Other Good Proposals' 
</P>
<P>
"There's so many ifs and uncertainties about their project that I don't see any 
way the city is going to kick in the whole $238,000 on the outside possibility 
they can pull this together," he said. "There's other good proposals out there 
too." 
</P>
<P>
Even though the shelter has yet to be funded, residents have found little 
solace. 
</P>
<P>
"We're already overrun with transients now, and they want to bring in more?" 
said Lady Blue, owner of the Ventura Tattoo Studio, one of four commercial 
spaces that would have to be relocated from the first floor of the building. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's fair. I have a good clientele, not your typical tattoo shop 
trash. We're all here trying very hard to lead respectable lives," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Pompa, who has run his Imperial Upholstery shop in the building for 18 
years, agreed. "This building is going to be a white elephant," he said. "It's 
foolish." 
</P>
<P>
Although leaders of the two agencies conceded that it would be preferable to 
construct such a project without displacing anybody, they said the high cost of 
real estate and strict zoning requirements left them with few options. 
</P>
<P>
"We realize these are real people and they have real concerns," said Thomas G. 
Buford, an attorney representing Cabrillo. "But you're never going to find a 
site where no one is inconvenienced and no one objects in this day and age."

SCHOOLS TOLD BASKETBALL SHOULD BOUNCE EQUALLY FOR BOYS AND GIRLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The U.S. Department of Education has notified Glendale school officials that 
their past practice of scheduling girls' basketball games at less desirable 
times than boys' games violates federal civil rights laws. 
</P>
<P>
The department will take no action against the district, however, since school 
officials have already guaranteed changes in the schedule, which the department 
said would be adequate to correct the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling represents a negotiated settlement between the Department of 
Education and Glendale Unified School District. The district agreed last month 
to guarantee that girls' varsity basketball games would not be played at less 
desirable times than boys' games. Traditionally, girls have played afternoons 
and weeknights, and boys have played Friday and Saturday nights. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, parents of several girls on the Hoover High School basketball team 
filed a complaint with the Department of Education contending that the 
district's schedule violated players' rights to fair treatment under the law. 
Their complaint followed several others made to Glendale school officials. 
</P>
<P>
For more than five months, district officials had contended that they were not 
responsible for the equitability of scheduling since the games are scheduled by 
an interscholastic basketball league, not by the district. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights ruled that since 
the league is made up of representatives from member schools and since those 
schools receive federal funds, the school district is responsible for ensuring 
against discrimination in sports scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
In January, district Supt. Robert Sanchis guaranteed that changes would be made 
in the schedule to make it fair. Those changes include scheduling girls' games 
right before or after boys' games in the same location, scheduling girls' and 
boys' games on the same day or night but at different sites, and alternating 
Friday and Wednesday night games between girls' and boys' teams. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the district will guarantee that bands, pep squads and drill teams 
perform at both girls' and boys' games, Sanchis said in a letter to the 
Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
Parents of girls on the basketball teams and attorney Gloria Allred, who has 
spoken to Glendale school officials on the parents' behalf, were cautious in 
praising the department's ruling. Allred and the parents have asked that girls' 
games be played on the same night and in the same location as boys' games. But 
the department ruling said a number of district remedies -- of which such 
scheduling is only one -- would be equitable. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any information about what the schedule is going to be next 
season, so we don't know whether it's going to be equitable or not," Allred 
said. "We are going to adopt a wait-and-see attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Allred and the parents have said games played in the afternoon do not generate 
the excitement or interest of night games and make it more difficult for 
parents and friends to attend.

TILED HILL HOME GROWS, PIECE BY PIECE

<P>
Forty-two years ago, Robert Johnson bought a lot that slithered up a steep 
canyon at a bend where a narrow, winding road ascended into the wild country of 
Elysian Park. 
</P>
<P>
It's been a perfect spot for whimsy. Johnson built his own house on the edge of 
the slope, a simple, brown wood-sided box that was modern for its time. 
</P>
<P>
He then began to encircle it with a lattice-work of gray cinder-block walls 
forming terraces that intersected up the hill at kaleidoscopic angles. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, whimsical Landa Street somehow stayed clear of the Los Angeles 
building boom, leaving Johnson and his wife, Helena, who came along in time, 
free to pursue their fractured vision of domestic beauty. 
</P>
<P>
Their medium is marble. They like it because it's colorful and warm and tactile 
and as varied as snowflakes. And especially they like it because it's cheap. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Applied Piece by Piece 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't pay a dime for this," Johnson said, smiling innocently and waving 
his hand like a wand over the marble fascia that he and Helena have applied 
piece by piece, like quilt work, over thousands of square feet of wall. 
</P>
<P>
He exaggerates slightly. 
</P>
<P>
There was the time that he and Helena were driving along the highway in Arizona 
and saw a nice piece of rose quartz at a roadside stand. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife bargained with the guy and we bought it for $3," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Far more typical, though, was the time in Flagstaff when they happened across a 
large quarry of precious stone in a landfill, where it was apparently deposited 
by the widow of a departed lapidary. 
</P>
<P>
All it cost them was a major repair bill. 
</P>
<P>
"We burned out our transmission on the drive back from Flagstaff to Los Angeles 
with about 1,000 pounds," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Their big strike came 10 or 12 years ago at California Marble Co., somewhere in 
the city nearby. 
</P>
<P>
The owner had 11 tons of odds and ends. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Insurance Pays for It' 
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, a marble man has a lot of broken pieces brought in by 
people," Johnson said. "They want them to be replaced. Generally, the insurance 
pays for it." 
</P>
<P>
And, generally, they leave the broken pieces behind. 
</P>
<P>
The yard owner had once contemplated doing something with them. Then he had to 
move. He made the Johnsons a bulk rate offer: no charge. 
</P>
<P>
"It took us 30 or 40 trips back and forth with our sedan," Johnson said. "You 
can get about 400 to 500 pounds and then the tires look kind of thin." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the pieces are quite substantial. The largest are up to four feet long 
and almost as wide. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst part is carrying it up the steps," Helena Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband downplayed the effort. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have a person on each end, it moves," he said. "You learn." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Johnson was not unprepared for this calling. 
</P>
<P>
"I brought in a little talent in the form of being an apprentice mason," he 
said. That's when he was 17. 
</P>
<P>
He later became a civil engineer and worked until retirement for Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Those days, the weekends were an extension of his work. 
</P>
<P>
"Often on Friday, when he came home from the office, I had everything ready so 
we could do something in the evening," Helena said. "It takes teamwork, too." 
</P>
<P>
Her job was to mix the cement. He designed the forms, sometimes using doors, 
and invented the structural system to bind them to the walls. 
</P>
<P>
"We have learned that if you put enough iron and steel, it stays well enough," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
He found that coat hangers work best, and are also free. 
</P>
<P>
"They're very easy to come by," he said. "People throw out old hangers in the 
trash." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson estimates that he has used 10,000 hangers. 
</P>
<P>
He won't guess the number of pieces of marble, quartz, onyx, granite and desert 
stone. 
</P>
<P>
They wrap all the way around the back of their house and up the canyon behind 
it, cascade down from the front door to the deck above the garage and 
completely encase the garage. All that is in the Johnsons' private world, out 
of public view. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'For Our Own Pleasure' 
</P>
<P>
"We do this for our own pleasure, you see," Robert Johnson said. "We don't do 
it for any other reason." 
</P>
<P>
And yet they haven't denied the world a peek at what they do. In the last phase 
of their project, they covered every square foot of a fanciful stairway and 
terraced garden leading down from their canopy of trees to the sidewalk below. 
</P>
<P>
The Johnsons are known to their neighbors as the nice couple who smile and wave 
as they work. They have no pretensions about the meaning of their masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nothing special," Robert said. "It's something to fill in your time." 
</P>

COUNCIL REVIVES PLAN TO BAN SALE OF ASSAULT RIFLES 
</P>

<P>
A proposal to ban the local sale of semiautomatic assault weapons was 
unexpectedly resuscitated this week by the City Council amid complaints that 
the council was making end runs around its own committees. 
</P>
<P>
By a 7-2 vote, the council refused to go along with a recommendation by two 
committees to shelve the proposal, and instead asked the city attorney to draw 
up an ordinance outlawing the sale of the kind of rapid-fire weapons that last 
year were used to kill 10 people in the city. The proposal will be considered 
at the council's April 4 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Acceptable' 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the council's Legislation and Public Safety committees 
concluded there were too many questions about such a ban's legality and 
effectiveness. But the full council was considerably more enthusiastic about 
regulating semiautomatic assault weapons, commonly used in the drive-by gang 
shootings that plague inner-city areas. 
</P>
<P>
"These military-type weapons are not acceptable on the streets . . . anywhere 
in Long Beach," Councilman Warren Harwood said. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the schoolyard killings of five Stockton children by a gunman 
firing an AK-47 assault rifle, the cities of Los Angeles and Compton recently 
outlawed the guns' sale and possession. The Senate and Assembly have each 
passed versions of a statewide ban, but the legislation must be reconciled 
before it can be sent to the governor. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the majority of the council appears inclined to have Long 
Beach take its own stand against the military-style guns, which can be 
purchased across the counter with the ease of buying a tube of toothpaste. 
</P>
<P>
As outlined Tuesday, the proposal would outlaw the sale of assault weapons, but 
not their possession -- an apparent concession to the difficulties of getting 
such weapons out of the hands of current owners. 
</P>
<P>
The move to revive the ban raised objections from three councilmen who 
protested that their committee work was being ignored and that the council was 
acting too hastily. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not a Local Issue' 
</P>
<P>
"What we are seeing here is an end run," insisted Councilman Les Robbins, a 
veteran member of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department who advocates a 
state ban. "This is not a local issue. . . . We need a state law," contended 
Robbins, who along with Councilman Jeffrey A. Kellogg voted against the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Kellogg and Councilman Ray Grabinski angrily argued that they had no inkling 
there would be an attempt to revive the gun ban at this week's council meeting. 
"What we're doing again is coming up with instant government," Grabinski said, 
although he later voted with the majority to draw up an anti-assault rifle 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Grabinski appeared particularly irritated with Councilman Evan Anderson Braude, 
who joined Councilman Clarence Smith and Vice Mayor Wallace Edgerton in leading 
the vote to revive the assault rifle proposal. Braude, Grabinski pointedly 
noted, is chairman of one of the committees that recommended the proposal be 
shelved. 
</P>
<P>
Braude later said he was in favor of local regulation of assault weapons when 
the matter was considered by his committee, but knew he was alone in his 
support of it. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who made the motion to draft the ban, said: "I have kids in my community 
who are afraid to go out and play and can't sleep at night . . . I don't know 
about instant government, but this killing has been going on for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
After hearing his colleagues exchange verbal shots, Edgerton attempted to 
downplay the friction. "The council is not divided. . . . We are all together," 
he insisted.

<P>
COUNCIL RACE HEATS UP WITH 13 CONTENDERS

<P>
The campaign for the Glendale City Council turned more intense and at times 
more hostile this week, with candidates beginning their final drive in 
anticipation of the April 4 election, in which an unprecedented 13 contenders 
are vying for three seats. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the candidates addressed a senior citizens umbrella organization, 
a forum that contenders consider crucial because senior citizens accounted for 
about 50% of the vote in the last election. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a group of long-established political figures announced the 
formation of a new political action committee to back the two incumbents and 
Richard Jutras, their choice to replace outgoing Councilman John F. Day. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday afternoon, a challenger took her campaign to the City Council. 
Candidate Nida Solana Brown presented her platform and chastised the 
incumbents. At the same meeting, a representative of a developers group accused 
the council of manipulating the city's apartment building moratorium to aid the 
incumbents' reelection campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday evening, four candidates exchanged charges and countercharges before 
one of city's largest and most powerful homeowners groups, the Chevy Chase 
Canyon Estates Assn., considered the home turf of incumbent Ginger Bremberg, 
who lives in the canyon. The association in the past has also been a strong 
backer of incumbent Mayor Carl Raggio. 
</P>
<P>
Bremberg issued the first attack at the homeowners forum, lashing out at Brown 
for sending a letter to supporters urging them to vote only for Brown, instead 
of voting for three candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"I find this outrageous and reprehensible," Bremberg told an audience of 200, 
the campaign's largest crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"She's obviously on an ego trip," said Bremberg, who introduced herself as a 
Chevy Chase Canyon resident and the councilwoman "who's been fighting for the 
Chevy Chase Canyon Estates Assn. for the past eight years." 
</P>
<P>
Brown responded by saying "the incumbents are slipping, that's why they're 
getting dirty," attacking Brown personally because they are losing support. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley Griffin followed by blasting the incumbents and Jutras for attending a 
"lovely wine-and-cheese fund-raiser" at the home of developer Ken Doty, who she 
said was committed to developing the city's hills. She denounced the "hillside 
hackers" and "guerrilla developers" who she said are ready to "rape" the 
hillsides with the incumbents' tacit approval. The audience exploded in 
applause. 
</P>
<P>
Robin Westmiller promised that, if elected, she would call for the immediate 
resignation of City Atty. Frank R. Manzano, Senior Assistant City Atty. Scott 
H. Howard and Zoning Administrator Regina Good. "I've seen them at work and 
they're an embarrassment," she said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the assaults apparently failed to dent much of the group's traditional 
support for incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
The group's senior director, Michael Dickerson, predicted that while many of 
the 4,000 canyon residents are growing increasingly concerned about the city's 
rapid growth, the incumbents will retain the vote of a great majority of 
homeowner association members. 
</P>
<P>
"If you drive around the canyon, most of the signs on the yards support the 
incumbents," he said. However, he warned, if the current pace of development 
continues, "it will be very difficult" for incumbents to retain the homeowners' 
support. 
</P>
<P>
A measure of the importance that Glendale politicians place on the powerful 
homeowners group is that council members Jerold Milner and Larry Zarian 
attended the forum at the Chevy Chase Country Club. Their seats are not up for 
reelection until 1991. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the candidates appeared before a forum sponsored by the Greater 
Glendale Council on Aging, which produced few surprises and no clear-cut 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Matthews emerged as a crowd favorite among the 150 in attendance. His 
strong commitment to the creation of a senior citizens commission and his 
avowed concern for the elderly -- "ever since as a little boy my father told me 
to give up my seat in the bus for an older person" -- drew the biggest applause 
of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, voicing views supported by most of the challengers, said there is no 
question that the elderly need more housing, transportation and their own 
commission, but they are low on the City Council's priority list. "The 
solutions are there and everybody knows them," Brown said. "The council just 
needs to provide the necessary funding." 
</P>
<P>
Bremberg answered that while she would like to satisfy every request made by 
Glendale's elderly, to do so, the council would have to "sacrifice some of the 
fine services" it proudly provides to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Bremberg was the only candidate to oppose creation of a senior citizens 
commission. She argued that adding such a bureaucracy to the city government 
would simply add red tape to an otherwise fluid relationship between the 
Council on Aging and the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
While the remaining 10 candidates enthusiastically supported creation of a 
commission, Raggio and Jutras offered only lukewarm support. They said they 
thought that it was a bad idea, but would support it because the elderly wanted 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The Greater Glendale Council on Aging represents 36 senior citizen groups in 
the city, spokesman Charles Cressy said. While the elderly make up close to 
50,000 of the city's population of about 165,000, they accounted for about half 
of the 11% voter turnout in the last municipal election, Cressy said, citing 
statistics gathered by his group. 
</P>
<P>
"Their vote is crucial in every election," Raggio said. "Senior citizens are 
avid voters." 
</P>
<P>
However, the council will make no attempt to steer the senior citizen vote 
toward one candidate or another, Cressy said. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday the incumbents were endorsed by a group of influential friends, but 
challenger Joe Ayvazi immediately questioned the motives behind the 
endorsement. The group of longtime business leaders and community activists, 
led by former mayors Bob Garcin and Jim Perkins, announced the formation of 
Glendale Citizens for Quality of Life, a political action committee to support 
Raggio, Bremberg and Jutras. 
</P>
<P>
"We represent people who have a long-term involvement in city affairs," said 
the group's spokesman, Natt Read. "Our group likes the way the city has been 
governed so far, and we feel that the incumbents and Jutras offer us the best 
chance of continuing the present leadership's policies." 
</P>
<P>
The group held a kickoff press conference Wednesday morning at the Brand 
Library, a symbol of traditional Glendale. About a dozen or so community 
leaders and former city government officials held a sign that read, 
"Experience, not Experiments." 
</P>
<P>
"We are Glendale," Garcin told reporters. "And we want to keep Glendale the way 
it is." 
</P>
<P>
Committee members would not comment on how much money they have raised, how 
they intend to spend it or what will happen to the group after the election. 
"All I know is that we will send a mailer in support of our candidates, but it 
won't be citywide." He would not say what areas the mailer would target. 
</P>
<P>
Ayvazi questioned the motives behind the last-minute formation of the political 
action committee. "As far as I'm concerned, it is an organized effort to keep 
things status quo," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are decision-makers involved in running the city who want to remain in 
the decision-making process," even though they no longer hold elective office, 
Ayvazi said. 
</P>
<P>
At the City Council meeting, Raggio and Bremberg were the targets of criticism 
by Brown and Haik Vartanian, spokesman for the Fair Growth Coalition, a group 
of developers 
</P>
<P>
Brown said the incumbents were "out of touch with what Glendale wants," and 
urged that they pay attention to many issues, including the needs of senior 
citizens and the budget for the city's anti-graffiti campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Vartanian said his coalition would not comment on the proposed zoning changes 
the city is evaluating because it is "tired of political games and using the 
coalition as a target for your political attacks." 
</P>
<P>
In February, the Fair Growth Coalition presented a detailed analysis of the 
proposed zoning changes, which was largely ignored by the City Council, the 
council's planning staff and the Planning Commission until Raggio last week 
invited Vartanian's group to make a presentation to the council next week, just 
a week before the elections. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Vartanian welcomed the mayor's invitation, but later changed his 
mind. Raggio responded to the developer's statement by saying that Vartanian's 
announcement was a political ploy to damage the incumbents' campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
In a related campaign development, GlenPac, the city's oldest political action 
committee, Wednesday disclosed campaign contributions of $2,500 each to Raggio 
and Jutras and $1,000 each to challengers Ed Dorris, Ayvazi and Matthews. 
</P>
<P>
The Tri-City Restaurant Assn. (formerly the Glendale Restaurant Assn.) 
announced Wednesday that it was endorsing the incumbents and Jutras. "We feel 
they are the more stable and experienced candidates," said spokesman Frank 
DeSantis. "They have done a lot for the restaurant community in Glendale."

MANAGEMENT TEAM QUITS DEAL TO RUN BELL CARD CLUB 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With city officials close to completing their purchase of the California Bell 
Casino, a management group that agreed to handle day-to-day operations has 
suddenly pulled out of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
The breakdown of the 4-month-old pact with California Casino Properties Inc. -- 
led by several veteran casino operators -- was announced this week after the 
management group failed to make a good-faith deposit of $1.2 million, City 
Administrator John Bramble said. The deposit was supposed to have been made by 
March 15. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Didn't Want to Go Forward' 
</P>
<P>
"They kind of backed out of the deal," Bramble said on Tuesday. "They just felt 
that given their financial position, they did not want to go forward." 
</P>
<P>
City officials had been on the brink of scheduling a bond issue that would have 
raised an estimated $7.1 million to pay off the beleaguered card club's 
creditors and a block of limited partners, Bramble said. The bond issue was the 
last hurtle in the city's 18-month effort to take over the club so it might 
again provide a steady flow of tax revenue, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was technically a default," Bramble said. Members of the management group 
forfeited a $10,000 deposit after claiming that the signed operating agreement 
would not prove as profitable as they had hoped, Bramble said. 
</P>
<P>
"(The breakdown) was pretty much on friendly terms," Bramble said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said they intend to proceed with the casino purchase. But they 
acknowledge that the transition will probably be delayed by at least two months 
as they search for a new club operator. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are not back to square one," Mayor George G. Mirabal said, "we are 
pretty close to it." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, casino attorney Howard Manning said the club's current owners are 
"disappointed that this (takeover) process is taking so long." 
</P>
<P>
He said the general partners -- California Bell Club Management -- are 
considering keeping the club if the city cannot close a deal soon. 
</P>
<P>
"The time has dragged on quite a long time," Manning said. "This is to the 
detriment of the club. The question as to what lies in the future for the 
California Bell Club has had a negative effect on the club's operation." 
</P>
<P>
Mirabal said that city officials have begun negotiating with three other 
management groups. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to move on this fairly quickly," Mirabal said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just as strongly resolved today as we were a year ago," Mirabal 
continued. "You cannot ignore how lucrative the tax is on the casinos." He 
declined to name the other management groups, but said they were not from any 
of the other, more profitable casinos in neighboring cities. 
</P>
<P>
Mirabal said California Casino Properties backed out of the pact largely 
because of a "black cloud hanging over the head" of pai-gow, a high-stakes 
Asian game that generates as much as 25% of the revenue of area card clubs, but 
that may soon be outlawed by the state. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Bernstein, an attorney for the management group, declined comment this 
week. But at a recent City Council meeting, the lawyer said his clients were 
concerned about the uncertain future of the controversial Asian game. 
</P>
<P>
Pai-gow and two similar Asian card games are played at all seven Southland card 
clubs, but their legal status has been challenged in the courts by the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies contend that the games violate the century-old state gambling law 
because they allow the dealer to enjoy a slight advantage over the other 
players. 
</P>
<P>
A coalition of city managers from Bell, Bell Gardens, Huntington Park, Commerce 
and Gardena -- where the clubs are located -- are supporting a bill that would 
update the state law, outlaw pai-gow, but permit the other games, Asian poker 
and super pan 9. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of California Casino Properties also expressed fear that rising bond 
interest rates would have lowered the group's profit margin, city officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The operating agreement called for the $7.1-million bond issue to be paid back 
from the club's gross receipts. The management group would have received a 
percentage of whatever was left -- so the higher the bond interest, the smaller 
their profit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Profits Are Down 
</P>
<P>
And these days, the California Bell Casino's profits are far from what they 
used to be. The club opened to standing-room-only crowds in 1980 and once 
generated about $2 million in annual tax revenues and fees for the city. 
</P>
<P>
But in recent years, other casinos have opened in Huntington Park, Commerce and 
Bell Gardens, giving the Bell club stiff competition. Now, the city receives 
only a small fraction of that $2-million high, Bramble said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bicycle Club in Bell Gardens, the largest card club in the state, is less 
than two miles from the California Bell Casino, located in the industrial 
section of the city. 
</P>
<P>
California Bell operators have complained that the glitzier Bicycle Club, run 
by Cathedral City Mayor George Hardie, has lured thousands of gamblers from the 
California Bell Club. 
</P>
<P>
City officials moved to take over the Bell club in September, 1987, after it 
became mired in a series of financial and legal problems as well as a bitter 
dispute between shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Officials agreed to pay the club's general partners the $7.1-million to be 
raised by the sale of development bonds. 
</P>
<P>
But officials have run into several snags in their attempt to find a suitable 
management team to handle day-to-day operations. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between the city and Southwest Gaming of Las Vegas fell apart last 
year after that management group became involved in a criminal profit-skimming 
investigation that also touched some of the Bell club's general partners. 
</P>
<P>
On March 3, several members of Southwest Gaming were charged with conspiracy to 
commit grand theft and attempted grand theft, said Los Angeles County Deputy 
Dist. Atty. David Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Casino operators Don Speers, Michael Riordan, John Vukasian and James Salerno 
were arraigned in Los Angeles Municipal Court and released on an unspecified 
amount of bail, Conn said. Southwest Gaming acted as a consultant to the Bell 
Club, casino attorney Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
No charges have been filed, however, against the general partners of the Bell 
casino, Conn said. The investigation is continuing, he added.

AN OFFER OF 26-FOOT-TALL SCULPTURE OF A MUSHROOM CLOUD TURNS INTO DEBATE OVER 
PUBLIC ART IN PARKS, POLITICS OF ARTIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Beverly Hills, where public art has been a touchy topic since the 
installation of a cluster of rusty metal objects in a park last year, a debate 
is brewing over the offer of a 26-foot-tall sculpture of a mushroom cloud. 
</P>
<P>
This time, politics is part of the debate. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Fine Arts Committee is scheduled to discuss the offer from Los 
Angeles Times cartoonist Paul Conrad at its April meeting. But several letters 
from people angry about the proposal have appeared in local newspapers, and the 
city has received one letter objecting to the sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
The criticism appears to be prompted as much by Conrad's cartoons on the 
Palestinian struggle against Israeli occupation as by his vision of a nuclear 
holocaust, city art officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complaints From Residents 
</P>
<P>
"Better that he set it near the sanitation department where it properly 
belongs, along with the rest of the garbage posing as art on Santa Monica 
Boulevard," wrote David Levy of Beverly Hills in a letter to a local newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"As his cartoons have been outrageously vicious, anti-Semitic and anti-Israel, 
he is hardly the one to receive fame as a peacemaker," wrote Lillian Gilbert in 
another letter to a newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
But Ellen Byrens, chairwoman of the Fine Arts Committee, said politics would 
not be a factor in deciding whether to accept the sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
"The objection is to Mr. Conrad as an anti-Semite," Byrens said. "I don't know 
if Mr. Conrad is an anti-Semite or if he isn't one. My own feeling is that that 
is not the basis for judging a work of art." 
</P>
<P>
Conrad said: "No, I'm not an anti-Semite. I could deny it for the rest of my 
years, but it wouldn't do any good. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm an anti-Semite, so, too, are at least 50% of the Israelis who differ 
with the Shamir government," he said, referring to Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Shamir. 
</P>
<P>
The protests, he said, are "based on cartoons I've done on the (Palestinian) 
uprising. The sculpture's got nothing to do with that." 
</P>
<P>
Estimated to cost about $250,000, the work would be underwritten by an 
anonymous donor. But a suitable site has yet to be found in Beverly Hills or in 
Santa Monica, which also is interested in the sculpture and since early last 
year has been considering Conrad's offer to place it there. 
</P>
<P>
For now, "Chain Reaction," the cartoonist's dream of a memorial to the age of 
nuclear anxiety, is no more than a yard-high model on a wooden crate outside an 
office in the Beverly Hills Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
And the artist is getting impatient. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard the political process was slow, but jiminy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Missed Deadline 
</P>
<P>
Conrad said he had hoped to have the piece finished by Aug. 6, the anniversary 
of the 1945 bombing of Hiroshima, but he won't meet that deadline. He will not 
start the sculpture until a site is selected, and he estimates that the 
sculpting will take eight months. 
</P>
<P>
"Around the base of it I want to put that this is a statement of peace and the 
phrase, 'May it never be an epitaph,' " Conrad said. "I think it symbolizes the 
last 40 years." 
</P>
<P>
If built, "Chain Reaction" probably would loom high above a large, open space, 
perhaps Roxbury Park in Beverly Hills or Clover Park in Santa Monica, 
surrounded by trees whose leaves would be reflected in the greenish patina of 1 
1/2-inch copper tubing fashioned into hundreds of chains. 
</P>
<P>
"What I wanted was . . . the immensity of it," Conrad said. "Twenty-six feet 
was as high practically as I could go." 
</P>
<P>
According to George Herms, one of the three artists who reviewed the piece for 
the city of Santa Monica, "(Conrad) is an editorial cartoonist, so we had to 
look at it and make sure it's not just a one-liner (joke) in space. 
</P>
<P>
"And it was more than just a one-liner in space. It would be very impressive. 
You look up at the sky through those links of chain, and (there is) the idea of 
the chains that bind us to this fragile thing called life. I think there's a 
lot of poetry in it. I don't think it's just there for shock value." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Previous Controversy 
</P>
<P>
Herms knows about shock value. It was his work, "Moon Dial," an assemblage of 
five rusted buoys, a rusted window frame and a winch, that detonated the debate 
over public art when the sculpture was placed in Beverly Gardens Park as a 
temporary exhibit last year. 
</P>
<P>
After a flurry of complaints, the city asked Herms to remove the work before 
the end of its planned 18-month run, but he declined to take it down, arguing 
that it was "a salute to the Beverly Hills I know." 
</P>
<P>
Byrens said there is no intention of installing Conrad's mushroom cloud in the 
same location. "Everything on Santa Monica Boulevard (the site of the Beverly 
Gardens Park exhibit) is on loan and temporary," she said. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Conrad piece, "we have not made any promises," she said. "We have 
said that if a suitable place should ever be found, it might be considered. . . 
. Something of that size requires a gigantic space." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conditional Acceptance 
</P>
<P>
Michael Cart, the city staff member assigned to the Fine Arts Committee, said 
that although the panel granted a conditional acceptance two months ago, no 
action is expected on Conrad's offer before the next meeting, April 12, when 
its possible placement is likely to come up for debate. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Agajanian Quinn, another member of the Beverly Hills Committee, said she 
thought that the mushroom cloud was beautiful, even if it did make some viewers 
think of death and destruction. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what people think. . . . But Mr. Conrad says it stands for peace, and I 
think that when it's constructed and you stand underneath it and look at the 
sky and life around you, you get a very peaceful quality," she said. "People 
get art confused with politics." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica's art mavens agreed. "It's not cartoon-like at all," said Paul 
Leaf, chairman of the Santa Monica Arts Commission. "It's very sculptural, it's 
very dramatic, and its intent is obviously anti-nuclear explosion, or anti-war. 
And it's a very beautiful piece." 
</P>
<P>
But despite the Santa Monica panel's vote last summer to recommend acceptance 
of the sculpture, there has been little progress toward agreement on a site, 
which would be the next step before the Recreation and Parks Commission and the 
City Council consider the offer. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the fact that this opportunity to have it in Santa Monica has been 
moving very slowly, we certainly wish him the best wherever he wishes to place 
it. But we're still working on it," said Henry Korn, arts administrator for 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Conrad, a three-time Pulitzer Prize-winner, said he has not placed any of his 
sculptures on permanent public display. He has shown some bronze works in 
galleries and at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, however. 
</P>
<P>
In the unlikely event that both cities accept the offer, Conrad said, he would 
place the statue at the site that seemed best.

COLLEGE SEEKS FEDERAL GRANT FOR DRUG PREVENTION PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cerritos College will apply for a federal grant of nearly $150,000 to help with 
a campus drug prevention program. The college Board of Trustees gave unanimous 
approval Tuesday to an application requesting the money from the U.S. 
Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
The money would be used to start an education and drug prevention program at 
the 18,000-student school in Norwalk. The college would contribute more than 
$230,000 to the project. 
</P>
<P>
The program would include drug prevention counseling for faculty and students 
and information on drug prevention throughout the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to develop a program to prevent drug use among students and teachers. 
We hope we can impact generations of students, parents and grandparents," said 
Jan Dennis-Rounds, college administrative dean of educational support services.

BLUFFS CONSTRUCTION OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Planning Commission approved plans for construction of 142 
homes on two parcels of land totaling 23 acres on Westchester Bluffs. 
</P>
<P>
However, a spokeswoman for a neighborhood group called Save Our Bluffs said the 
decision will be appealed to the City Council. If the appeal is lost, the 
spokeswoman said, the group will pursue legal action to stop the development. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Hughes Realty Inc. originally proposed building 205 homes on two parcels 
totaling 42 acres. But last year, the Planning Commission staff rejected those 
plans, siding with Councilwoman Ruth Galanter and a community advisory group 
that opposed the project because of its size. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter, the community advisory group and the developer met and reached 
agreement on new plans. 
</P>
<P>
Little opposition to the revised plans was expected, but the Save Our Bluffs 
group appeared just before the Planning Commission hearing and said the 
advisory group did not reflect the views of the majority of the community. 
</P>
<P>
The group is pushing for preservation of the entire site, which overlooks the 
proposed Playa Vista project.

FIRE STATION SITES STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council, acting as the city Redevelopment Agency, voted Monday to 
consider two sites for the relocation of Fire Station No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
One is the "Meralta II" site, which is near City Hall on the back half of 
property owned by the Redevelopment Agency, south of Culver Boulevard between 
Irving Place and LaFayette Place. The other is on the police station parking 
lot behind City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
City staff had preferred the Meralta II site, partly because relocation at the 
police station parking lot would require the acquisition of seven residential 
lots to the east. 
</P>
<P>
Jody Hall-Esser, assistant executive director of the Redevelopment Agency, said 
relocating to the police station site would require a $4-million to 
$4.5-million cut in the agency's activities. Several projects would have to be 
canceled or postponed to make up for the cost of moving to the site, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Hall-Esser asked that the council postpone a decision on the project until a 
financial analysis is made in 30 to 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
Some council and agency members preferred the police station site because they 
said the Fire Department might operate better if it was located closer to City 
Hall and the Police Department. Others favored it because they wanted a civic 
center where all city buildings would be clustered together.

CITIZEN FORUM WAS 'WORTH EVERY NICKEL,' MAYOR SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 100 people turned out for a daylong Community Congress last Saturday 
that had participants break into discussion groups and brainstorm ways to 
combat crime and other major problems facing the "Keystone City." 
</P>
<P>
Norwalk officials spent much of the day just listening to residents, and in the 
end declared that the $12,000 city-sponsored session had been valuable. "It has 
been worth every nickel," Mayor Marcial (Rod) Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
Two topics often raised by participants were public safety and human services. 
Several people recommended that City Hall do a better job of making residents 
aware of available services. And they also called for city officials to pay 
more attention to drug-abuse problems, improve Neighborhood Watch programs and 
increase police emergency response time.

6-SCREEN THEATER COMPLEX OPENS; ANOTHER PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
East side, west side, all around the town of Lakewood there will be movies. 
</P>
<P>
A six-screen theater that seats 2,000 people was opened this week by United 
Artists at the site of an old shopping center on the western edge of Lakewood 
at South Street and Palo Verde Avenue. It is the first United Artists theater 
to open in the area since the Los Cerritos Twin opened 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
On the east side of the city, at the corner of Carson Street and Paramount 
Boulevard, Pacific Theaters is proposing an eight-theater complex. There is a 
bowling alley on the site now and Pacific wants to renovate and expand that, in 
addition to building the theaters, said Don Waldie, director of public 
information for Lakewood. The Pacific proposal, he said, is being reviewed by 
the city.

CONEJO VALLEY WOMAN'S ZEAL OFFERS TIPS FOR SIMI VALLEY, VENTURA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERRY BRAILO SPENCER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Pat Mason, happiness is a container for bottles, a container for cans, a 
container for paper and a free flatbed truck. 
</P>
<P>
Mason, the undisputed recycling queen of the Conejo Valley, can probably offer 
a few tips to officials in Simi Valley, who are scheduled to start a pilot 
curb-side recycling program next month. Ventura is expected to follow suit this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
Through cajolery, praise or whatever else works, the 47-year-old Thousand Oaks 
homemaker has made recycling a way of life in her 131-home subdivision, and has 
sparked the movement in a couple of others. She serves on various recycling 
committees and was nominated for an award from the California Waste Management 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Personal Contact' 
</P>
<P>
"I try to make personal contact," she said, "and use a guilt trip if necessary 
-- in a joking way, if anyone lets me push them just a little. I encourage them 
to recycle by telling them it's important." 
</P>
<P>
Mason is not shy about criticizing what she calls "our throwaway society." She 
points to the two major Ventura County landfills nearing overflow. She speaks 
somberly of "the crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Her zeal persuaded the Simi Valley Recycling Center to dispatch a truck and 
driver to her neighborhood one Saturday a month to pick up cans, bottles and 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
"She's kind of like save-the-whales," said Wade Schlosser, the center's 
manager. "She's a person who truly wants to do good." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Mason -- who is so hooked on the concept of re-use that she brings 
paper bags back to the grocery for refills and saves Styrofoam take-out 
containers for future use -- talks about recycling with a certain passion. 
</P>
<P>
"We find it's a chance for neighbors to get to know one another," she said. "We 
notice what kinds of trash people have, what they are drinking, and we laugh 
and giggle about collecting garbage. We're constantly surprised how many times 
we fill up the truck." 
</P>
<P>
Mason spent a year trying to persuade both Simi Valley Recycling and her 
homeowners association that they needed each other. The company, she argued, 
would get ton after ton of recyclable trash, and the association would get a 
monthly check for its efforts. She protested that she "couldn't stand the 
amount of" recyclable trash she saw on strolls past overflowing trash cans 
awaiting pickup. 
</P>
<P>
In the program's first month, November, 1987, the haul was one ton. Now it's 3 
1/2 tons monthly. 
</P>
<P>
Two other recycling programs started by Mason in Thousand Oaks ended recently 
because the price of recycled newspapers dropped so low that the rubbish 
company doing the pickup could not operate the program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Used to Recycling' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm rather disappointed the service pulled out," said Ward Dixon, a resident 
of the Lynn Ranch area of Thousand Oaks, where Mason started one of the 
programs. "We have always been used to recycling, but it's a real pain to haul 
the stuff, even though you get a few pennies for it." 
</P>
<P>
But recycling is still going strong in Mason's neighborhood. Simi Valley 
Recycling Center donates the truck and driver in exchange for Mason's 
representing the company on various recycling committees. Helping hands are 
needed to pick up the refuse as the truck goes through the area, and they are 
supplied by "15 or 20 people as the truck moves down the street," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mason concedes that there are those who resist recycling. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, there are people I cannot budge. I call them my 'reluctant recyclers.' 
There are 12% in the tract that I intend to work on. They are hard-core 
non-recyclers." 
</P>
<P>
That's a better track record than the one racked up by San Jose, one of the 
cities that Ventura is using as a model for its forthcoming attempt at 
curb-side recycling. In San Jose, 55% to 60% of the residents regularly sort 
their trash, according to Chris Velez, that program's manager. 
</P>
<P>
But curb-side recycling at best reduces waste by only 4% to 8%, according to 
Kay Martin, manager of Ventura County's Solid Waste Management Department. For 
that reason, she said, a county task force is exploring alternatives -- 
primarily a $25-million trash-processing plant that would churn out compost and 
fertilizer. Remaining, non-biodegradable garbage would be buried, but that 
would require only a small portion of the massive area now required for dumps, 
Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps only 20% of what goes into the front door will come out the back," she 
said.

BROTHERS FIND WAY TO KEEP CAPS CAPTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTINA BOXALL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his younger years, Bill Zamboni demonstrated the family penchant for 
invention by designing a pressurized wineskin. He developed a prototype with a 
hose to squirt the wine into his mouth, then abandoned the idea after 
concluding "the market would be a little too small." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps he gave up too easily, for more recently he has cultivated a market for 
an invention that at first blush seems even more obscure: a hat leash. 
</P>
<P>
It's a 10-inch-long strip of nylon cord with a badge clip attached to one end 
and a loop at the other. Bill has taken out a patent on it. Last year, he and 
his younger brother, Don, sold more than 10,000 of them. It will keep your 
baseball cap attached to your collar, if not your head. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Following Footsteps 
</P>
<P>
With such an unlikely product, the Zamboni brothers are following in the 
creative footsteps of their grandfather, Frank J. Zamboni, who invented the 
Zamboni ice resurfacing machine that has become a fixture at intermissions of 
hockey games, as well as a standing gag in the "Peanuts" cartoon strip. 
</P>
<P>
Just as Frank Zamboni designed the resurfacing machine because he wanted a 
quicker way to groom the ice in his Paramount skating rink in the 1940s, Bill 
Zamboni dreamed up his hat leash because he tired of losing his favorite 
baseball caps to the ski slopes. 
</P>
<P>
"I just needed it myself," said Bill, 30, who lives in Long Beach. "I used to 
work at a ski resort. I love to ski with a baseball hat, I always have." But 
when he whizzed down the ski slope, the hat would whiz off his head. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demand Grew 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in 1985, he took action: He got a piece of string and a couple of 
alligator clips, attaching the back of his cap to the back of his collar. From 
such humble tinkering came what is now officially known as the Kap Keeper. 
</P>
<P>
His friends asked him to make some for them. Then a buyer from Mammoth 
Mountain, a ski resort in the Sierra Nevada, inquired about them. He and his 
brother started assembling them in his brother's Bellflower garage. They were 
in business. 
</P>
<P>
At a suggested retail price of $3, the Kap Keeper is perhaps the cheapest thing 
to be found on a skier. But it's not just an inexpensive gadget, Bill stresses, 
"It's a functional product" that can save untold heartache along with your cap. 
He recounts the tale of the man who lost his cap this winter while on the 
slopes. "He went to get it and skied into a tree and broke his leg." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Marketing Dreams 
</P>
<P>
If only he'd had a Kap Keeper. 
</P>
<P>
Both brothers work part-time on their hat leash enterprise, while holding jobs 
elsewhere: Bill with a liquor distribution firm in Hollywood, and Don with a 
company that manufactures machines that wash airplanes. They also have a 
part-time employee who handles marketing, and they pay someone in Bellflower to 
make the hat leashes on a piecework basis. 
</P>
<P>
They have dreams of getting bigger, of going beyond the skier market to rein in 
the other wandering caps of this world. They are introducing the leash to 
boaters and fishermen, and they have approached professional baseball players, 
but there seems to be some concern that a $3 hat leash may get in the way of a 
multimillion-dollar home run swing. 
</P>
<P>
But there's always the Little League.

"Recalling 'Forgotten Genocide,' " Feb. 9, we were treated to the half truths 
and historical revisions propounded by Justin McCarthy. McCarthy's livelihood 
depends on Turkey, whose propaganda machine he has become. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a large amount of space was dedicated to parroting Turkish 
government propaganda regarding the Armenian genocide.

If the point of the article was not our recently published handbook on the

FRENZY AMID SKYROCKETING WESTSIDE PRICES; 
</P>
<P>
BUYING A HOUSE IN BOOM TOWN AN ORDEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH J. GARCIA, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Each year, the traffic gets more congested. New commercial construction blots 
out residential views. Developers and environmentalists battle for every 
remaining piece of open space. Parking becomes increasingly scarce. Homeowner 
groups raise their voices in protest. 
</P>
<P>
And real estate prices in the Westside continue to soar to new heights. 
</P>
<P>
Forget the complaints about the crumbling quality of life on the Westside. 
Hordes of affluent home buyers are lining up, sometimes with millions in cash, 
to grab a chunk of land as close as they can to the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outpacing the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
The prices are staggering. Middle- and upper-income families are being frozen 
out of the modest Westside neighborhoods. Former blue-collar communities are 
becoming havens for starch-collared corporate executives. And in a city as 
celebrity-conscious as Los Angeles, real estate agents are becoming stars, 
sought after by the rich and famous. 
</P>
<P>
Economists predict that real estate prices in the section of Los Angeles County 
bordered on the north by the Santa Monica Mountains, on the south by Los 
Angeles International Airport and on the east by Western Avenue, will continue 
to outpace all but a few communities in the United States during the next few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The average sale price of single-family homes jumped more than $100,000 in at 
least 10 Westside areas over the past year, according to sales reported through 
multiple listing services. The average sale price in several other communities 
jumped more than $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
In the sharpest increase reported, the average sale price of a single-family 
home in Playa del Rey rose 63% in 1988, leaping to a new high of $603,000. And 
that's with airport noise. The listing prices were even higher. 
</P>
<P>
And the homes for sale on the Westside were on the market only half as long as 
they were a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Although the real estate boom engulfed numerous areas of the Southland, 
particularly such hot spots as Pasadena, Glendale, and the West San Fernando 
Valley, the surge pumped up the already-steep prices in numerous Westside 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
The average sale price of single-family homes in Beverly Hills and Bel-Air 
already top the $1 million mark. Next year, Brentwood probably will join that 
list. Malibu and Pacific Palisades are only a few years away. 
</P>
<P>
Why the house-buying frenzy? What is driving up the asking and selling prices 
of Westside bungalows to mansion levels? 
</P>
<P>
Industry experts say it's a simple imbalance between supply and demand. 
Available Westside land is almost used up, and with a booming regional economy 
luring people from around the country to Los Angeles, more and more people are 
lining up to try to buy the best properties. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the only thing that would make the escalation stop would be if the 
financial services community doesn't make as much money available to home 
buyers," said Michael Salkin, an economist and senior vice president at First 
Interstate Bank. "But I don't think the trend will reverse until the state of 
California no longer attracts households for economic reasons." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little New Housing 
</P>
<P>
Although population growth on the Westside has lagged behind the rest of Los 
Angeles County -- rising only 8% since 1980, compared with 12% countywide -- 
the fixed housing supply has dramatically lifted sale prices. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same phenomenon that occurs in San Francisco, where even if the 
population rises only slightly, there is still very little new housing being 
built," said Salkin. 
</P>
<P>
"Prices won't stop increasing until the population drops or the economic 
strength shifts to other parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental fact is that you've got a lot more people chasing houses than 
there are houses available." 
</P>
<P>
In the past 12 months, while the demand for housing surged throughout Southern 
California, the Westside was targeted by a huge influx of home buyers. Industry 
analysts say that the already limited inventory of housing previously has been 
sold in only three months. In the last few years, it would have taken eight to 
12 months to exhaust the supply of single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
"The price pressures on the Westside are reflective of much of coastal 
California," said Joel Singer, chief economist for the California Assn. of 
Realtors. "You will continue to have rising prices on the Westside because of 
the scarcity of land. As the job market on the Westside continues to grow, it 
will promote a further demand for housing, but it's not going to generate new 
housing." 
</P>
<P>
The result will be a continuing trend of what real estate agents call multiple 
bid offers, where groups of prospective buyers try to outspend each other for 
newly listed properties. Singer and other economists say they haven't seen 
anything like it since a similar housing boom in the late '70s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few New Homes 
</P>
<P>
Ben Bartolotto, director of the Construction Industry Research Board, said the 
small supply of new homes on the Westside will continue to drive existing home 
prices up. 
</P>
<P>
"Of all the construction in Los Angeles County, the Westside accounts for less 
than 10%," he said. "The only things that are being built are either condos or 
very large and prestigious single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
"When you combine that with the already high land prices, you're talking about 
a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
Real estate market watchdogs point to foreign investment in Westside properties 
as another reason house prices are jumping off the charts. 
</P>
<P>
"The increase of foreign capital is the wild card," Singer said. "Clearly it 
increases the demand and pushes the prices even higher. But there's no way to 
quantify it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Last Year Was Crazy' 
</P>
<P>
However, industry experts say that although they expect Westside real estate 
prices to continue to rise, they will rise at a much slower rate than they did 
in 1988, when home prices rose an average of 23%. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year was crazy," said Jon Douglas, president of the real estate company 
which bears his name. "I've never seen anything like it." 
</P>
<P>
Some industry analysts are concerned that the rising price of homes throughout 
the Westside may begin to change the character of the community. They say that 
the elements that make the area so desirable -- good weather, lots of cultural 
offerings, new jobs and overall panache -- are shifting the base of the 
community from just very expensive to nearly exclusive. 
</P>
<P>
"What the numbers mask is that you've got a different population in the 
Westside now, more affluent," said Salkin. "In a situation like that, the 
cultural, the ethnic and the employment characteristics will change, but it 
doesn't happen overnight." 
</P>
<P>
The overall effect of the decrease in moderate housing could be a reassessment 
-- and ultimate rejection -- of Westside properties by prospective home buyers, 
according to some real estate experts. But even they predict it will be years 
before there is any significant drop in the price of housing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drop in Value? 
</P>
<P>
"The future housing situation depends on a lot of different scenarios such as 
the increasing traffic problem and the effect that has on new building in the 
area," said Kathleen M. Connell, chair of the Center for Finance and Real 
Estate at UCLA's Graduate School of Management. "If there continues to be a 
lack of affordable rental housing and people can no longer afford to work on 
the Westside, then I do think you will see a revaluation of what has been a 
substantial premium of living on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't anticipate a great drop in value, but whether it increases as rapidly 
as in the past is doubtful," she said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Douglas said the factors that make Westside housing so expensive are 
not likely to change. He said that in the last decade, the price of detached 
single-family homes there has risen an average of 16% each year. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the rent-control atmosphere that exists in places like Santa 
Monica, you're not going to see much new development," Douglas said. "So the 
existing base price of residences in the area will continue to go up. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the last 20 years, with the exception of a couple of recessions, Westside 
real estate values have never gone down. I think that will continue to happen 
as long as people can continue to afford those properties on the Westside." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Highly Affordable 
</P>
<P>
If that's the case, Westside properties will sell at at escalating rates for a 
long time. First Interstate's Salkin said, however, that by world standards, 
the Westside is highly affordable. 
</P>
<P>
"When you compare it to places like Tokyo and Hong Kong, it's not expensive," 
he said. "America is still fairly underpriced compared to the rest of the 
industrial countries. We're a bargain basement society when it comes to 
houses." 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, the median sales price of a home rose from $150,000 in January, 
1988, to $177,000 in December, 1988, and $185,000 in January, 1989, according 
the the California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 850,000 California homes were sold, 250,000 of them new. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Fairly Unique' Market 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at whether housing is overpriced in California, all you have to 
see is that nearly 1 million people bought homes at these prices," Salkin said. 
"So are housing payments exaggerated here? It's tough . . . to say yes." 
</P>
<P>
Although Singer said the Westside was a "fairly unique" market, he said a few 
other areas in the country are comparable, such as Stamford, Conn., 
Westchester, N.Y., and the Peninsula communities outside San Francisco, such as 
Hillsborough, Palo Alto and Atherton. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at the prices in the Westside, it really is incredible," Singer 
said. "But there doesn't appear to be any shortage of people here who can 
afford it."

LATE ARMEN SARAFIAN REMEMBERED WIDELY; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATOR'S TOUCH MADE SOME LASTING IMPRINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The day after the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, 
some students gathered in front of the Pasadena City College cafeteria and 
threatened to storm it. 
</P>
<P>
That was the tenor of the times when Armen Sarafian, a distinguished San 
Gabriel Valley educator who died recently after a heart attack, was president 
of the college. In 1976, he had told an interviewer from The Times: "They were 
at a mob tension level." 
</P>
<P>
Sarafian, who always maintained a deeply personal touch with students 
throughout his 42-year career, confronted the would-be demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
"One told me they were so full of grief that they had to relieve it by helping 
themselves to the food," he said. "Another yelled, and I can still hear it, 
'I'm willing to die or go to jail but I have to do this!' That showed me how 
symbolic this was." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Helped Students 
</P>
<P>
But Sarafian was unrelenting. Taking food without paying for it? That would be 
a misuse of public funds, he told the students. But he understood their 
anguish, he quickly added. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel so terribly full of grief, let's go in together and share the grief, 
and I'll pay for it," he told them. 
</P>
<P>
The students filed into the cafeteria, took food and drinks and, after a 
cashier toted up the bill, Sarafian dished out about $200. 
</P>
<P>
The incident is often cited as an example of the uncanny ability of Sarafian, a 
former president of the University of La Verne and a former member of the State 
Board of Education, to turn problematic situations into positive ones. 
"Conflict resolution," Garbis Der Yeghiayan, president of the American Armenian 
International College in La Verne, calls it. 
</P>
<P>
"When there were problems, he felt them before they even arose," said Der 
Yeghiayan. 
</P>
<P>
Although the King assassination touched off bloody disturbances all across the 
country, the Pasadena incident became the impetus for the creation of a fund to 
assist economically deprived minority students. The first money to go into the 
Martin Luther King scholarship fund came from black students who subsequently 
apologized to Sarafian and insisted on reimbursing him for their lunches. 
</P>
<P>
Teacher, administrator, college president, member of the State Board of 
Education, education innovator, Armen Sarafian died March 11 at 69 after 
suffering a massive cardiac arrest while attending the Big West Conference 
basketball tournament at the Long Beach Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Sarafian, a longtime Pasadena resident, was there to root for his friend, 
University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Coach Jerry Tarkanian, whose team beat New 
Mexico State for the conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian, who coached at Pasadena City College between 1966 and 1968, was one 
of many who said they had felt Sarafian's personal magnetism. "He was like a 
second father," said a stunned Tarkanian after Sarafian's death. "He talked to 
me before the game. And he said he'd see me afterward. He knew my mother and 
father. We've been close for 50 years." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ex-La Verne President 
</P>
<P>
Besides his 11-year tenure as college president, Sarafian put in nine years as 
president of the University of La Verne, where he founded the American Armenian 
International College in 1976. At both Pasadena and La Verne, he was credited 
with turning ailing institutions into healthy educational centers. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Van Nuys of Armenian immigrant parents, Sarafian earned his bachelor's 
degree magna cum laude at La Verne College, where his father, Turkish-born 
Kevork Sarafian, was head of the foreign languages department. 
</P>
<P>
Sarafian earned his master's at Claremont Graduate School and his Ph.D at USC. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of his presidency at Pasadena, where Sarafian had begun teaching in 
1947, the school's enrollment had doubled. While there, Sarafian was the 
driving force for the Southern California Consortium for Community College 
Television, an alliance of 18 colleges that first brought instructional 
television to the region. 
</P>
<P>
"What other people saw as dreaming blue skies, he put into action," said David 
Ledbetter, Pasadena's assistant superintendent for instructional services. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Father's Dream 
</P>
<P>
Under Sarafian's guidance, La Verne evolved from a small liberal arts college 
near financial collapse to a university that had achieved both financial 
solvency and academic respect. It had been the dream of Sarafian's father to 
build an Armenian college in La Verne, said Der Yeghiayan. "Armen turned it 
into a reality," he said. "That made a big difference in his decision to come 
to La Verne and accept the presidency." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, despite his complaint in 1984 that he was "tired of 
presidenting," Sarafian had served as interim president of Colorado Mountain 
College and interim chancellor of Peralta Community College District in 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
He also became deeply involved in fund raising for Armenian studies. A trip to 
Armenia in 1984 was a revelation to him, said Der Yeghiayan. "He had not spoken 
Armenian in 60 years, but he was carrying on conversations in Armenian," said 
Der Yeghiayan. "He was so proud to be visiting the motherland for the first 
time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unobtrusive Style 
</P>
<P>
Sarafian's style as an educator was unobtrusive. "He was one of those people 
who did things in a silent, efficient way," said U.S. District Judge Dickran 
Tevrizian, a fellow member of the Pasadena Armenian-American community. "You 
never read in the newspaper that Armen Sarafian had done such-and-such. It was 
always Pasadena City College. He did things not by the use of his name but by 
the use of the institution." 
</P>
<P>
But the college president never got so engrossed in institutional details that 
he forgot about people, friends and colleagues say. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't a William Jennings Bryan orator," said Bill Goldmann, Pasadena's 
dean of education services. "But he communicated his interest and concern." 
</P>
<P>
Goldmann was a social science teacher at the college (then Pasadena Junior 
College) when he became the object of Sarafian's unsolicited generosity. 
</P>
<P>
"He arranged a scholarship for me to study economics at the Claremont Graduate 
School," he said. "Knowing about a person's needs or desires and then doing 
something about them -- they're really light years apart." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Encouraged Escalante 
</P>
<P>
Bolivian-born Jaime Escalante, the inspirational math teacher at Garfield High 
School who became the subject of the movie "Stand and Deliver," recalled 
Sarafian's encouragement when, as a Pasadena City College student, he was 
struggling with English. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a class called 'American Institutions,' which was a required 
course," Escalante said. "The teacher said I didn't have enough English to 
perform, and he suggested that I drop the class." 
</P>
<P>
Sarafian, hearing of Escalante's difficulties, called him into his office. "He 
told me not to give up so easily," Escalante said. "They were beautiful words 
of encouragement." 
</P>
<P>
Despite having enough honorary degrees to fill a book and having been appointed 
to state-level panels, there were some honors that Sarafian resisted. When it 
was suggested in 1976 that Pasadena City College name its new paramedic 
sciences building after him, he strongly opposed the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"It is far better to name buildings for what they contain and offer, rather 
than to worry about names," he said. "I certainly don't want to saddle people 
with an unpronounceable name and one they can't spell."

GUN GROUP TELLS O'CONNELL HE IS RECALL TARGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERRY BRAILO SPENCER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) has been targeted for recall by a 
group of local gun enthusiasts because he favors banning military assault 
rifles. 
</P>
<P>
A group calling itself the Ventura County Freedom Coalition served O'Connell a 
notice of intent to recall Monday in Fillmore, where he was visiting 
constituents. The leader of the organization is Charles Townsend, a part-time 
astronomy instructor at Oxnard and Moorpark colleges. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell said he was not surprised when he was served the papers while holding 
"sidewalk office hours" in his district. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been tipped off late last week about this. As far as I know, I am the 
only legislator that has been served. Mike Roos was told that he would be 
recalled, but as far as I know, I'm the first. 
</P>
<P>
"I stand by my vote," O'Connell said. "There is just no justification for these 
paramilitary assault weapons to be so widely available on the streets. The 
hoods are better armed than the law." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, O'Connell, along with the majority of the Assembly, voted for a bill 
to ban military assault rifles. That bill, introduced by Michael Roos (D-Los 
Angeles), would ban 36 models of rifles, eight types of pistols and three types 
of shotguns. The Senate also passed a broader bill on gun control. At present, 
a conference committee is working on a compromise between the two bills. 
</P>
<P>
The recall group has 160 days to collect 21,992 signatures once their petition 
has been approved by the secretary of state's office, according to a 
spokeswoman there.

LONG BEACH DROPS CHARGES IN POLICE 'STING' BY ACTIVIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTINA BOXALL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Admitting the case was weak, the Long Beach city prosecutor Wednesday dropped 
charges that Don Jackson, a self-styled crusader against police brutality, 
resisted arrest during a secretly filmed "sting" in which a police officer 
appeared to shove Jackson's head through a plate glass window. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Municipal Judge Gary R. Hahn quickly agreed to the prosecutor's 
request for dismissal of the case against Jackson, who in turn claimed 
vindication of his efforts to expose police brutality. 
</P>
<P>
Videotaped by a hidden NBC television crew and later broadcast on the "Today" 
show, Jackson's Jan. 14 encounter with two Long Beach police officers focused 
national attention on allegations that the city's police force routinely 
mistreats minority members. The case drew the interest of black community 
leaders, entertainment celebrities and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who rallied to 
Don Jackson's side, donating money for his legal defense and lauding him as a 
hero. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very elated," Don Jackson said outside the courtroom, where his trial on 
the misdemeanor charges was scheduled to start Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
He later said he is considering suing Long Beach and the Police Department over 
his arrest and prosecution and will seek a formal censure of the city 
prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's shocking they even took the case this far. . . . I'm requesting 
that my attorney seek some form of ethical sanction against the lead attorney 
for this malicious prosecution," said Jackson, a Hawthorne police sergeant on 
disability leave. 
</P>
<P>
John A. Vander Lans, the city prosecutor, said he never would have filed 
charges against Jackson in January if he had all the information he now has. 
"The facts we had after the 20th of March changed my mind," said Vander Lans, 
who declined to specify exactly what had prompted him to seek the case's 
dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said it was not until last Friday that he had received all tapes of 
the incident from NBC, and it was not until Monday that he received an official 
transcript of a state Senate oversight committee hearing on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Both Jackson and Mark Dickey -- the officer who appears to push Jackson into 
the window on the tape -- testified at that hearing, and Dickey admitted he had 
filed an inaccurate report on the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, Vander Lans said, his office would file a misdemeanor charge the day 
after the arrest. But in Jackson's case, he waited several more days, until "we 
thought we had all the facts." 
</P>
<P>
The videotaped arrest occurred late on a Saturday night, when Jackson and an 
off-duty corrections officer donned dirty old clothes and drove into Long Beach 
with a television crew following discreetly at a distance. Their mission was to 
demonstrate police abuse and capture it on film. 
</P>
<P>
Dickey and his partner pulled Jackson over, allegedly for a traffic violation. 
Moments later, as the cameras rolled, Dickey cursed Jackson and appeared to 
push him into a shop window, shattering the glass. 
</P>
<P>
Dickey, saying Jackson had used profanity and been belligerent, arrested 
Jackson on a charge of interfering with a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
It was not Jackson's first self-styled sting, nor, apparently will it be his 
last. Despite his career in law enforcement, he has stopped hundreds of times 
to watch police make arrests and sometimes used himself as bait. 
</P>
<P>
In Westwood last year, he was arrested after allegedly blocking a sidewalk, but 
the prosecutor for that community never filed charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who has filed a lawsuit accusing the Hawthorne Police Department of 
racial discrimination, said Wednesday he will renew his sting efforts after a 
brief respite. He added that he intends to establish a foundation to monitor 
civil rights abuses by any government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
After Wednesday's dismissal, Jackson's attorneys insisted that Vander Lans 
never had grounds to file charges against their client. They claimed the 
prosecutor had pressed the case in an attempt to fend off a possible lawsuit by 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
"The case was filed maliciously," insisted Thomas E. Beck, one of Jackson's 
attorneys. Beck attributed Vander Lans' abrupt about-face to Dickey's Senate 
testimony, in which the officer admitted that Jackson had never sworn at him, 
as he stated in his police report. 
</P>
<P>
Dickey, who attributed the errors in his report to a faulty memory, said he had 
so little faith in his own police report that he would not want it used against 
him if he were suspected of a crime. 
</P>
<P>
Dickey, who could not be reached for comment Wednesday, has been reassigned 
from patrol duty to desk duties pending the outcome of the Long Beach Police 
Department's internal investigation of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office and the FBI also launched 
their own investigations of the officers' conduct, and spokesmen for all three 
agencies Wednesday said the investigations will continue, unaffected by the 
prosecutor's decision to drop the case against Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Completions Foreseen 
</P>
<P>
Curt Livesay, assistant district attorney, and Long Beach Police Chief Lawrence 
L. Binkley both said they expect their investigations to be completed within 
the next couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Binkley, while complaining that Vander Lans had not informed him that he 
planned to dismiss the case, said he could not comment on the prosecutor's 
decision. "There's very little I can say about the actions of the elected 
official," Binkley said, referring to Vander Lans, who has been reelected to 
the prosecutor's post several times since first winning the position in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Long Beach Police Officers Assn. was freer with his opinion 
of the case's dismissal. "This has been a real big slap in the face, not just 
to police in Long Beach, but all over the state and throughout the country," 
complained association spokesman Mike Minton. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, he continued, "The Don Jacksons of the world are going to go out 
there and try to intimidate police officers, and somebody is going to get 
hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach officials seemed relieved that the case was over, questioning 
whether Vander Lans ever should have pursued it in the first place. "I kind of 
felt he had a weak case to begin with, but thought maybe he knew something I 
didn't know," Mayor Ernie Kell said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called Isolated Incident 
</P>
<P>
Kell, noting that the publicity surrounding the case was not the kind the city 
wanted, termed the Jackson-Dickey episode "an isolated incident, an unfortunate 
incident." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Davis, chairman of a city commission that advises the City Council on 
public safety issues, called the dismissal "a good sign" that the community was 
prepared to deal with the brutality allegations raised by Jackson and others. 
</P>
<P>
"I think any reasonable citizen in this town on Jan. 16 could have reached the 
same decision it took (the prosecutor's office) 60 days to reach," Davis added.

BUSH STAYING OUT OF ETHICS FIGHT -- WRIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK NELSON, Times Washington Bureau Chief 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.), branding as "ridiculous" and "outrageous" a 
proposal that the Justice Department seek an independent counsel to investigate 
him, Wednesday declared that President Bush has given him personal assurances 
that his Administration will take no part in the controversy over possible 
ethics violations by the Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic-controlled Senate's bruising rejection of Bush's nomination of 
former Sen. John Tower to be defense secretary had led to concern among 
Democratic leaders that the Administration might retaliate by joining House 
Republicans in pressing ethical allegations against Wright to weaken him or 
strip him of the Speaker's post. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assured by Bush 
</P>
<P>
But the Speaker, in an hourlong interview with The Times, said that Bush 
personally told him that he would have nothing to do with the ethics 
controversy. Sources close to the President also said that the President had 
made clear that he wants his Administration to stay out of the House fight. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative activist Paul M. Weyrich, whose allegations of drunkenness and 
womanizing against Tower contributed to the Senate's rejection of his 
nomination, has sent a six-page letter to Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh urging him 
to seek appointment of an independent counsel to investigate Wright. He said 
that such an independent inquiry is warranted because "it would be impossible 
for the executive branch to be immune from the political pressure and threats 
of political retaliation" from the Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, lashing out at what he termed an increasingly "meaner" political 
environment in Washington, blamed "vicious" right-wing Republicans for his 
problems. But he said that he has refused to seek revenge and has "talked 
various Democratic members out of bringing retaliatory ethics charges against 
five different Republican members." 
</P>
<P>
"I told them I thought that was unnecessary and unbecoming and it would simply 
raise the decibel level of bitterness and anger and would not be productive to 
the institution, and I talked them out of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Speaker, a fierce partisan who has many political enemies on Capitol Hill 
and some critics in his own party, said that the political environment "is mean 
and it's been turning that way for several years, and it has gotten meaner. I 
regret that. I have not been a party to it, certainly not intentionally or 
knowingly. I regretted what was done to John Tower . . . I thought he got a bum 
rap on a couple of things." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Letter Based on Allegations 
</P>
<P>
The Weyrich letter rested heavily on allegations presented last May 26 to the 
House Ethics Committee by Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.). It contended that the 
charges amount to "specific and credible information" alleging a violation of 
federal criminal law, a condition required before an outside prosecutor can be 
sought. 
</P>
<P>
David Runkel, a Thornburgh aide, said that Weyrich's letter has been referred 
to the "proper people," presumably the Justice Department's public integrity 
section. The section has 15 days to decide whether the information is both 
specific and credible. 
</P>
<P>
Weyrich said that the current House committee's investigation does "not include 
investigation of criminal law" and it "is institutionally incapable of making a 
fair and impartial determination concerning criminal violations by one of its 
own members." 
</P>
<P>
He charged that Wright "has brought enormous political pressure on members of 
Congress to exonerate him of his wrongdoing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Claims GOP Supporters 
</P>
<P>
Wright, interviewed in the Speaker's office, declared that he has not even 
asked his colleagues to speak up in his defense. He professed to be heartened 
by Democrats who have spoken out voluntarily in his behalf and added that even 
some Republicans in the House have told him privately: "Jim, we're sorry you're 
having to endure this vicious attack. We know in our minds that you've not done 
anything wrong. We'll be glad when it's all over with." 
</P>
<P>
Leaning forward and angrily shaking his finger as he responded to a question 
about the Weyrich proposal, Wright declared: "It's ridiculous! Outrageous! 
We've had an outside counsel in the House. He has taken nine months. He's gone 
over the last 40 years of my life. He's had the power of subpoena and $1.6 
million with which to do it. Nobody could say this was anything but the most 
exhausting investigation that's ever been made, I guess, of any member of the 
House . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The House Ethics Committee, which has been poring over a bulky investigative 
report by independent counsel Richard Phelan, a Chicago attorney, is expected 
to make its recommendations in early April. Under House rules, the committee 
could exonerate Wright or find him guilty of violations not serious enough to 
justify sanctions. Or it could issue a statement of alleged violations similar 
to an indictment and invite him to reply at a committee hearing. 
</P>
<P>
If violations are found, possible penalties include a reprimand, censure or 
expulsion from the House. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Denies Violating Rules 
</P>
<P>
The Speaker, insisting that he expects to be exonerated of any serious 
wrongdoing, said: "I have not knowingly violated any House rules, and I don't 
believe that I have unknowingly violated a House rule. I know I haven't done 
anything dishonest." 
</P>
<P>
Although conceding that he has made "slips in judgment," Wright said that, if 
the House wants "a person of flawless and impeccable judgment and knowledge for 
Speaker, if they want the immaculate conception in the Speakership, then it 
isn't I. I'm very human. Of course, I make a lot of mistakes as I go along . . 
. I've done a lot of things which in retrospect I wish I hadn't done." 
</P>
<P>
Wright suggested that Phelan, despite conducting a thorough investigation, 
"probably misunderstood some of the rules of the Congress" concerning ethics. 
</P>
<P>
"If Mr. Phelan misunderstands some of the rules, if he thought it would be a 
violation of the rule for a member of Congress to intercede in behalf of 
constituents, then he just has not been familiar with the practice here," 
Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
If Phelan believes that the rules forbid a House member to use "an aide to 
assist him in compiling and putting together his own writings in a book, the 
congressman's own writings, then he thoroughly misunderstands," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Among the allegations before the Ethics Committee are that Wright pressured 
federal bank regulators on behalf of Texas savings and loan firms that were 
under federal investigation and that he may have improperly evaded limits on 
outside income when he arranged for publication of his slim volume, 
"Reflections of a Public Man." The book was published by his political campaign 
printer and he received $55,000 under an extraordinarily lucrative royalty 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cites 52 Other Books 
</P>
<P>
Wright disclosed that he had presented to the committee 52 books in which 
congressional authors, including Gingrich and other GOP conservatives, 
"acknowledge in the forward assistance from members of their staff." 
</P>
<P>
In Wright's case, however, the allegation involves not only a staff member's 
help in compiling the book but the charge that he evaded a House limit on 
honorariums through bulk sales of the book to lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, dismissing concerns by some Democrats that his support in the party is 
eroding and that he could lose his Speaker's post if the Ethics Committee finds 
any violations, said that his colleagues have assured him he will emerge from 
the ethics controversy "stronger than ever." 
</P>
<P>
"I walk out there on the (House) floor," he declared, "and, before I get off 
the floor, a dozen colleagues will come and pat me on the back and say: 'Hang 
in there. We're with you. We know there's nothing to these charges. We're with 
you hell or high water. Hang in there. This will pass and you're going to be 
stronger because of it.' "

GOP ELECTS GINGRICH AS HOUSE WHIP; 
</P>
<P>
CONFRONTATIONAL CONSERVATIVE WINS PARTY'S NO. 2 POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frustrated by decades of Democratic domination, House Republicans Wednesday 
elected confrontational conservative Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia to their 
second-ranking leadership post over the opposition of House Republican leader 
Robert H. Michel of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
Backers of Gingrich said that his 87-85 victory over the more traditional and 
less colorful Rep. Edward R. Madigan (R-Ill.) reflected a widespread demand for 
more aggressive tactics in dealing with the Democratic majority. 
</P>
<P>
An elated Gingrich, contrasting his strategy to the current Republican 
approach, said that it would be "closer to a UCLA full-court press." 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich's new title is minority whip, the post held by Rep. Dick Cheney of 
Wyoming until President Bush named him defense secretary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Seeking 'Nice Guys' 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich's backers rejected the view that the minority Republicans must 
cooperate with Democrats to influence legislation, as Madigan often did as a 
member of the Agriculture Committee. "Ed Madigan is a nice guy," said Rep. 
Chuck Douglas (R-N.H.). "And nice guys aren't what we were looking for." 
</P>
<P>
Michel, clearly downcast by the defeat of Madigan, said that he would "go with 
the flow" and make changes where necessary in the Republican high command. But 
he also noted that a minority party with 80 fewer votes than the Democrats must 
carefully select the issues where it can fight and have a chance to win. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic leaders were quietly jubilant at Gingrich's success. They view him 
as the Republican most likely to unify the often-splintered factions of their 
party if he continues his highly partisan attacks in his new post. 
</P>
<P>
It was Gingrich who filed the charges that have led to a House Ethics Committee 
investigation of the financial affairs of the House's leading Democrat, Speaker 
Jim Wright of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"We're obviously going to have a delicate and difficult relationship at best," 
Gingrich said of the Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
For the record, Wright extended congratulations and best wishes to Gingrich. 
Told that Gingrich had promised to treat him with courtesy, however, Wright 
laughed before saying: "I look forward to that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Foley Avoids Prejudging 
</P>
<P>
House Democratic Leader Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) said that he would not 
prejudge Gingrich, who has charged that the Democrats are run by a "corrupt, 
left-wing machine." 
</P>
<P>
But Rep. Tony Coelho (D-Merced), who ranks third in the Democratic leadership 
behind Wright and Foley, could hardly conceal his joy at Gingrich's selection, 
calling it "manna from heaven." He said that Democrats could exploit Gingrich's 
ultraconservative positions on Social Security and other issues now that he is 
in the GOP hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
Coelho, who as majority whip will be Gingrich's counterpart on the Democratic 
side, pointed out that Gingrich's job will be to count votes and build 
coalitions with members of the other party. "He can no longer bomb bridges, he 
has to build bridges," Coelho said. 
</P>
<P>
Even Rep. Lynn Martin (R-Ill.), who voted for Madigan out of home-state 
loyalty, said that Gingrich won because of his hard work, enthusiasm and 
ability to command media attention. "Of course, if you live by the press, you 
can die by the press," she noted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Are Dismayed 
</P>
<P>
Some Republicans, however, were dismayed by the outcome. Rep. Silvio O. Conte 
(R-Mass.) said that it was a "tragedy" to divide the minority party over the 
whip contest. Other GOP veterans complained that Gingrich was largely untested 
in legislative negotiations and the intricacies of counting how Republicans 
would vote on closely contested bills or amendments. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot to learn about the inside game," acknowledged Gingrich, a former 
history professor better known as a debater and gadfly than a craftsman 
familiar with the nitty-gritty details. 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich, seeking to reach out to moderates in his party, arranged for veteran 
Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota to nominate him for the whip's job, with 
seconding speeches by Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt of Arkansas, a friend of 
President Bush, and the widely respected Rep. Olympia J. Snowe of Maine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'He'll Mature' 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.), a staunch conservative, predicted that Gingrich 
would do well in the whip's job. "He's smart enough to know we have to achieve, 
not just fight. You can say what you want about Newt, but he's smart. He'll 
mature to the job," Hyde said. 
</P>
<P>
After his election, which was greeted with whoops and hollers in the staid 
Republican Capitol Hill Club two blocks away from the Capitol, Gingrich 
promised to be a team player. He said that his victory was not a rejection of 
the way the more easy-going Michel has led House Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
"If the question had been a test of Bob Michel's leadership, I wouldn't have 
got 40 votes," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
As Gingrich defined it, the issue was whether to build a "much more aggressive, 
more activist party" in the House, where Democrats outnumber the GOP by 258 to 
174, with three vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very hard to be a Republican in the House," explained former Rep. Jim 
Jones (D-Okla.). "You're not in charge and never will be in charge. . . . Those 
Republicans elected in the Reagan era are very conservative firebrands who 
insist that their leaders be confrontational."

POLICE GIRD FOR CONFRONTATIONS OVER ABORTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON and CAROL McGRAW, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police and protesters headed for a showdown as militant anti-abortion 
demonstrators and pro-choice activists marshalled their troops and completed 
their war plans on the eve of what promises to be three days of tense 
confrontations at Southern California clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Crusaders on both sides of the abortion issue were to begin fanning out before 
dawn today to family planning clinics. Locations in many cases were kept secret 
until the last minute to stymie police -- and the other side. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sit-Ins, Pickets 
</P>
<P>
Members of the New York-based Operation Rescue anti-abortion organization, 
moving a national campaign to the Los Angeles area, said they will stage 
sit-ins and put up pickets at three to five clinics each day to prevent women 
from obtaining abortions. 
</P>
<P>
"Operation Rescue is going to have to obey the law," Mayor Tom Bradley said 
Wednesday in pledging that police will arrest demonstrators who interfere with 
patients. "The public needs to know that we're not going to permit someone to 
come into this town, violate the law, disrupt this community and think they're 
going to get away with it." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department, stung by charges that it has been too 
lenient on Operation Rescue members in the past, promised to keep clinic doors 
clear of rallying demonstrators who illegally try to block them. 
</P>
<P>
Police opened an emergency operations center downtown to coordinate security 
efforts and planned to set up command posts -- complete with field jail units 
-- wherever protests spring up. Extra officers will be on patrol or on standby 
in Los Angeles and in other suburban cities and will be deployed as needed, 
police spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
Four City Council members also announced that they will attend demonstrations 
to guarantee that police safeguard the clinics. "Operation Rescue is kind of 
like the Ayatollah Khomeini approach to public policy," Councilman Richard 
Alatorre said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Arrests Made 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department came under fire last month when Operation Rescue staged 
protests that forced two clinics to close, yet no arrests were made. Members of 
the City Council two weeks ago demanded -- and finally received -- assurances 
that police will enforce trespassing and other laws to keep anti-abortion 
demonstrators at bay. A federal court on March 2 ordered demonstrators to 
remain 15 feet from clinic entrances. 
</P>
<P>
Several clinic operators and pro-choice organizations, in meetings leading up 
to this week's events, questioned whether some police leaders were sympathetic 
with the anti-abortion forces, especially since several top commanders, 
including the department's second in command, Assistant Chief Robert L. Vernon, 
are fundamentalist Christians. 
</P>
<P>
Vernon, who is in charge of security operations during the days of protest, 
said anti-abortion activists will not be allowed to break the law. "I'm going 
to uphold the laws of this city," Vernon said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Operation Rescue has stood out among anti-abortion groups because of its 
militant, '60s-style tactics. On Wednesday, the Right to Life League of 
Southern California, one of largest such groups in the nation, said it 
understood Operation Rescue's frustration and the "sense of urgency to end this 
American holocaust" but said it could not support its methods. 
</P>
<P>
In another attempt to place a last-minute obstacle in the path of the 
anti-abortion forces, the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California 
filed civil contempt charges against Operation Rescue in federal court on 
Wednesday. The ACLU contends that Operation Rescue has defied the court order. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators have disrupted health care services at various clinics in Fresno, 
Chico, San Diego and Oakland and have "terrorized health-care clinic clients 
and flagrantly disregarded the law," Carol Sobel, ACLU attorney, charged during 
a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing in U.S. District Court is set for April 24, and the suit will be 
amended to include the names of those arrested during this week's 
demonstrations, she added. The suit names Operation Rescue and its Southern 
California organizers, Jeff White, Joseph Foreman and Randy Adler, and 100 
other unnamed people. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe they need more than a $25 fine and a slap on the wrist," Sobel 
said. "If they face losing their homes and jobs they will think twice about 
what they are doing." 
</P>
<P>
But Operation Rescue has ignored thousands of dollars in fines as a result of 
similar incidents throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
Operation Rescue leaders, meanwhile, held what they billed as a press 
conference in a hotel in Orange, near their headquarters. Rather than answer 
questions, however, Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry displayed what he 
said was a 19-week-old fetus that had been aborted. 
</P>
<P>
"Ask the dead baby your questions," the 29-year-old former car salesman told 
startled reporters before he and his entourage rushed out. 
</P>
<P>
The organization is predicting that about 3,500 of its members -- many flown in 
from other parts of the country -- will join the demonstrations, designed to 
coincide with Holy Week. 
</P>
<P>
The organization, made up mainly of religious fundamentalists, has justified 
its sometimes illegal tactics by contending that it is "saving lives and will 
only obey higher laws." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tension High at Clinics 
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the planned protests, tension was high at the approximately 90 
clinics in Southern California. Many clinic directors reported that their 
clients have been frightened away from scheduled appointments out of fear of 
confronting Operation Rescue picketers. 
</P>
<P>
At the nine clinics run by Planned Parenthood of Los Angeles, the staff has 
been calling all clients with scheduled appointments to let them know of the 
possible confrontations, and to give them the option of rescheduling. 
</P>
<P>
"A few have rescheduled but the majority (have) not," said Janice Sinclaire, 
Planned Parenthood spokeswoman. "More often than not, the women have gotten 
very angry because their right to privacy and health care is at stake, and they 
say they will not be stopped." 
</P>
<P>
Pro-choice forces promise to be out in numbers to escort women trying to enter 
clinics and discourage Operation Rescue operatives. 
</P>
<P>
"It's siege mentality. Isn't it sick?" said Patricia O'Neil, associate director 
of the Feminist Women's Health Center in the mid-Wilshire area. "How would the 
public react if this were happening in a cancer clinic? The public would not 
tolerate it." 
</P>
<P>
In scores of sit-ins around the country during the last year, including 
Atlanta, Boston, Philadelphia and Sunnyvale, Calif., Operation Rescue claims 
20,000 arrests of its members, straining courts and jails in each targeted 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles county and city officials are bracing for what a flood of arrests 
will do to already-overburdened facilities. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, arrested demonstrators will be booked at field jail units, 
temporary processing posts that are not designed to actually hold people. Some 
will be released and others, including those who refuse to give their real 
names, will be jailed.

CONTRACT SPURS YOSEMITE RUSH

Tourists flocked to Yosemite National Park after park concession workers 
overwhelmingly approved a new labor contract. The ratification vote eliminated 
the threat of a strike by hundreds of hotel, recreational, custodial and retail 
workers in the park during the usually busy Easter Week. Union members voted 
301 to 14 to accept the new, three-year contract with Yosemite Park and Curry 
Co. The pact includes a 10.5% wage increase over three years along with 
improved health care benefits and improved housing benefits. "Once people heard 
there was a tentative agreement, a lot of them decided to come to the park for 
Easter," said park spokeswoman Mallory Smith.

The United States said it has sent a high-level delegation to Iraq to press for 
compensation that Baghdad promised to families of American sailors killed in 
the 1987 attack on the frigate Stark. State Department spokesman Charles Redman 
said the delegation was led by Abraham D. Sofaer, the department's legal 
adviser, to persuade the Iraqis to pay the claims. After an Iraqi warplane 
fired two Exocet missiles at the Stark in the Persian Gulf on May 17, 1987, 
Baghdad promised to pay compensation to the families of the 37 sailors killed. 
The U.S. government presented its claims last April, asking Iraq to pay each 
victim's family $800,000.

NEWSMAKERS: INDIAN HEEDS A CALL OF THE BEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Cree Indian has completed a 2,700-mile run from Edmonton, Canada, to New York 
City to lay claim to a sacred relic stored in the American Museum of Natural 
History. Carrying a curved staff draped with eagle feathers for strength and 
wearing a wolf pelt for protection, Jim Thunder said he was driven by a 
recurring dream in which Chief Big Bear of the Crees instructed him to retrieve 
the artifact -- a parcel of calico holding bear claws, a clump of sweet grass 
and a plug of tobacco. Big Bear, leader of the Plains Cree, made the sacred 
bundle about 150 years ago when he was about 13 years old and wore it into 
battle for strength and guidance. In 1934, Big Bear's son gave it to a museum 
researcher in western Canada for safekeeping. Since that time, the museum has 
kept it as part of a research collection but has never put it on display. 
Thunder and a small delegation of Indians were to meet with museum officials 
who will decide whether to give up the parcel. Thunder told about 100 Indians 
and supporters: "We are confident that we will get the bundle back because 
since the 1930s there have been prophesies that it would return."

 -- After 40 years, 11,000 performances and 500 stitches, legendary tiger tamer 
Gunther Gebel-Williams has decided it's time to call it quits before his skills 
start to fade. The 54-year-old performer, who is beginning his two-year 
farewell tour with Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, said: "I'm 
still very strong, but when you get older your eyesight begins to go and I have 
to wear glasses offstage. But I can't wear them in the ring." Williams became 
famous for his ability to control animals without the usual whip, chair or 
pistol. In his current show, he puts Bengal and Siberian tigers through their 
paces, stands on the back of a charging elephant and puts Lippizaner horses 
through a ballet routine. "I am very close to my cats," he said, "but I can't 
ever let down my guard because while I can succeed in training them, I can 
never tame them."

 -- The name Endeavor, one of 18th-Century British explorer Capt. James Cook's 
ships, tops the list of suggested names for the next space shuttle in a 
competition among the nation's schoolchildren. The second most popular choice 
is Resolution, the name of another of Cook's vessels, followed by Victoria, the 
name of the ship used by Ferdinand Magellan, the 16th-Century Portuguese 
navigator. More than 6,100 teams, formed by 71,650 students, submitted research 
projects supporting and justifying the names selected. NASA is letting 
schoolchildren choose the name of the shuttle to replace Challenger, which 
exploded in January, 1986. The final choice will be announced in May. DEBORAH

The House debated legislation to raise the minimum wage, with Democrats who 
long have sought an increase praising President Bush for supporting a raise but 
saying the amount he has suggested is too low. "It is the first positive sign 
of cooperation on this issue that we have seen in eight years between the White 
House and the Congress," said Rep. Austin J. Murphy (D-Pa.), who managed the 
floor debate for the Democrats. "Democrats and Republicans have made an honest 
effort to work out our differences." The Democratic-controlled chamber is 
expected to vote on the measure today. The legislation would raise the minimum 
wage from its current level of $3.35 an hour to $4.65 by 1992, but Murphy plans 
to offer an amendment today scaling back the final target to $4.55.

U.S. Civil Rights Commission Chairman William Barclay Allen said that President 
Bush will have to come to him directly if he wants him to resign. The White 
House said Bush has no intention of asking Allen to quit but made it clear that 
a replacement was being readied. "It would make no sense for me to do it 
(resign voluntarily)," Allen said in the wake of reports that Bush planned to 
replace him with Arthur A. Fletcher, a moderate Republican and one of Bush's 
early black political supporters. Allen said he has been trying to meet with 
Bush since the election, but has received no response from the President or 
anyone else at the White House. His term does not expire until 1992.

The Navy said it hoped to find and correct the cause of a Trident 2 missile 
explosion in time to fire the next missile in April and complete a series of 
submarine tests by year's end. The Navy's goal is to have the long-range 
missile operational by December. That goal could be jeopardized if the problem 
is not found quickly, but a Navy statement said it would be premature to 
suggest the missile would not be ready for deployment then. The first submarine 
launch of the Navy's newest and most powerful weapon ended in fiery failure 
shortly after one of the 44-foot missiles vaulted out of a tube in the deck of 
the submerged Tennessee and shot to the surface. The first stage ignited and 
the projectile immediately spun like a burning pinwheel and exploded four 
seconds after launch about 100 feet above the Atlantic Ocean.

Women who smoke marijuana during pregnancy may stunt the growth of their 
fetuses, producing babies who are smaller than normal, a study published in 
today's New England Journal of Medicine shows. The research found that mothers 
who smoked pot while pregnant produced babies who averaged three ounces lighter 
and two-tenths of an inch shorter than non-users' newborns. Although their 
study does not definitely prove that marijuana slows growth in the womb, the 
researchers said that pot smoking is common during pregnancy, and women should 
be cautioned about the link. "It definitely supports the case that marijuana 
has an effect on the fetus," said Coryl Jones, a research psychologist at the 
National Institute on Drug Abuse in Bethesda, Md.

Poland's Parliament began debate on a reform package that would, among other 
things, legalize the banned Solidarity trade union and provide for important 
political freedoms. The six bills embody reforms agreed to in talks between the 
government and the Solidarity-led opposition. One bill would liberalize 
elections to Parliament, including a deal by which the opposition would take 
35% of the seats and the Communists would give up their absolute majority. 
Another bill would create an upper house, with elections to be held in June. 
The package, which would also give greater freedom to form associations and 
political clubs but no new political parties, is expected to be approved in 
about two weeks.

GROUP PROPOSES NO-FRILLS AUTO POLICY FOR $160 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal by a coalition of minority groups for making available to all 
Californians a no-frills, no-fault auto insurance policy that would satisfy the 
state's mandatory insurance law and cost only about $160 per automobile won 
backing Wednesday from state Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal probably faces an uphill fight because it would require assent by 
the Legislature to changes in the legal system that have been resisted by the 
California Trial Lawyers Assn. and its powerful friends in the state Senate and 
Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for getting insurance at such a low rate, buyers would have to 
agree to give up all pain and suffering damages except for the most serious and 
permanent injuries, and they would voluntarily agree to severely restrict 
lawsuits against others. 
</P>
<P>
But Gillespie said Wednesday that actuaries in the state Insurance Department 
have told her that the $160 price would allow insurance companies to break even 
without a state subsidy. She said she has agreed to convene a high-level 
meeting, including Deukmejian Administration officials and representatives of 
the insurance industry, the trial lawyers and consumer groups, to settle on the 
details. 
</P>
<P>
"We reviewed the work that had been done, and there is definitely a lot of 
logic in what they have put forth, and we feel very strongly it's a point of 
departure to obtain the input of the interested parties and go forth with such 
a basic plan," Gillespie said. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to John Gamboa, executive director of the Latino Issues Forum, 
Gillespie said, "I would like to wholeheartedly congratulate your group for the 
approach that you have taken." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, for which a legislative sponsor has yet to be named, is being 
made by the Latino Issues Forum; the California Council of Urban Leagues; the 
Oakland Citizens Committee for Urban Renewal; Mario Obledo, the national chair 
of Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition; the Interdenominational Ministerial 
Alliance, and the League of United Latin American Citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The no-frills, no-fault policy being proposed by these groups would cost 
drivers the same amount no matter where they live. Under the so-called 
territorial rating system now used by insurance companies, policyholders who 
live in certain areas -- heavily congested cities, for instance -- pay much 
more for insurance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Keep People Out of Jail 
</P>
<P>
Under a no-fault system, people who have accidents collect for their injuries 
from their own insurance companies, regardless of who is at fault in the 
accident. Gillespie said that her actuaries have told her that "if you have a 
first party system for that portion, you do not need territorial-based 
pricing." 
</P>
<P>
Gamboa declared: "The $160 no-frills policy will keep 500,000 Californians out 
of jail and provide affordable insurance to 6 million low- and moderate-income 
Californians. It could also lower auto insurance rates for all Californians." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that those wanting additional coverage, beyond the equivalent of the 
$15,000 individual/$30,000 group liability limits required now by the state, 
would be free to buy excess insurance. 
</P>
<P>
George Dean, president of the California Council of Urban Leagues, said, "We 
hope that everyone involved in the insurance crisis will work toward a 
compromise that ensures that the working poor do not have to make the choice 
between jail and high-cost insurance that exceeds all their discretionary 
income." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, very few Californians have gone to jail for not carrying the required 
liability insurance, but the state Department of Motor Vehicles recently 
revealed that during 1988, the first full year of toughened mandatory insurance 
enforcement, more than 550,000 drivers had had their licenses suspended. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Equal Treatment' 
</P>
<P>
Obledo, meanwhile, said that the proposed no-frills policy would "eliminate the 
gap in Proposition 103" as far as assuring an affordable policy for everyone, 
and thereby "ensure equal treatment for all." 
</P>
<P>
First reaction from the legal community, however, was very cool. Some attorneys 
at a meeting of defense counsel for the insurance companies in Los Angeles on 
Wednesday questioned whether the suggested price was too low. They said a major 
state subsidy might have to be provided to make such a plan financially viable. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Trial Lawyers Assn., Patti Levine, said the trial lawyers 
would "probably" oppose a plan that allowed accident victims even voluntarily 
to give up their rights to sue, although she said the association had formed a 
committee to examine such proposals for "mini-policies." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Stingy' Benefit Package 
</P>
<P>
"Our understanding is that this proposal has a very stingy no-fault benefit 
package and as any mini-policy they tend to discriminate against the poor by 
saying poor people should not be compensated as well as others," Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance industry officials who have been involved in discussions with the 
minority coalition have said they believe that if a no-frills, no-fault policy 
were offered, a large majority of Californians, interested in low prices and 
not really expecting to have accidents, would select it. But some have also 
expressed concern that once people had accidents, they might be dissatisfied 
with the level of benefits they received.

ROGERS TELLS PARENTS SHE'S NOT A RISK IN TEACHING JOB

The wife of Navy Capt. Will Rogers III has sent a letter to the parents of each 
of her former students at the La Jolla Country Day School saying that she does 
not pose a security risk, had planned to return to the school, but was 
"terminated" by school officials. 
</P>
<P>
A school official, who asked not to be named, told The Times on Wednesday that 
Sharon Rogers was ordered not to return in part because of concerns about the 
safety of the children, but also because administrators were worried that 
parents would pull their children out of the exclusive private school. 
</P>
<P>
She has not taught at the school since a bomb went off under the van she was 
driving March 10, prompting an investigation into whether she was the intended 
victim of a terrorist attack. Her husband skippered the guided missile cruiser 
Vincennes that mistakenly shot down an Iranian airliner down over the Persian 
Gulf last July, killing 290 people. Iran vowed revenge at the time. 
</P>
<P>
The La Jolla school official estimated that the school might lose as many as 
100 of its 702 students if Rogers had returned. "You lose 100 kids at $6,000 a 
head, hey. . . ," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the school administration also was "afraid for the children's lives. 
I'm afraid for my life. If she came back to the school I would consider 
resigning." 
</P>
<P>
Whether Rogers agreed to leave or was fired has been a matter of controversy 
since her departure was announced as a "mutual decision" by the school last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Stewart, a spokesman for the school, said Wednesday she was not fired. 
"We're just not renewing her contract," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Stewart added, "No matter what kind of furor she expresses, she's not 
coming back. Period." 
</P>
<P>
In her letter to parents dated Saturday and obtained by The Times on Wednesday, 
Rogers said she was "terminated" by the school last Thursday. She said in the 
letter that earlier, in consultation with school officials, she had requested 
that the words "mutual decision" appear in the school's press release "to help 
ensure integrity of the board's decision." At that time, according to sources 
who have spoken to Rogers, she wanted it to appear that she had not been fired. 
</P>
<P>
She said in the letter that federal agencies had done "an in-depth threat 
assessment" and found that "no evidence exists of a direct or implied threat 
against me or the school." As a result, she said, she was "prepared to resume 
(her) full classroom schedule." 
</P>
<P>
Two teachers who work at the school said that they and other teachers were 
angered by the administration's decision to fire Rogers. "Most of them feel the 
decision was made entirely too soon because they don't even know for sure who 
did it (the bombing). There was no reason to fire her. All they had to do was 
say, 'Mrs. Rogers is on an administrative leave,' and then make the decision." 
</P>
<P>
"I think they were reacting to the pressure of the media and a real minority of 
the parents who were hysterical," said one teacher, who spoke on the condition 
that her name not be used. "None of us ever felt scared. . . . We were 
horrified for Sharon but most of us didn't feel like they were going to bomb 
the school." 
</P>
<P>
The teacher said that at a faculty meeting last week, administrators said 
keeping Rogers could "choke a school to death" financially. The school's 
handling of the incident was "disgusting and it doesn't make me proud to teach 
here," she said.

ALTERED MEMOS FOR NORTH, HALL TELLS COURT 
</P>

<P>
Fawn Hall, the former secretary of Oliver L. North, said in federal court 
Wednesday that she systematically altered top-secret documents at North's 
direction in November, 1986, a day before Justice Department investigators 
began interrogating him about his role in the Iran-Contra scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Although her testimony at North's trial largely paralleled her account at 
televised congressional hearings two years ago, Hall added some new details, 
including assertions that North had joked about "going to jail." 
</P>
<P>
Also, she told prosecutor John W. Keker that she had no "qualms" about 
shredding original copies of the altered documents because she trusted North 
and "I knew there was a reason why we were doing this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Perks Up Jurors 
</P>
<P>
The appearance of the attractive blonde perked up jurors on a drowsy spring 
afternoon and caused the judge to lose his composure momentarily. 
</P>
<P>
As Hall took her place in the witness chair, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. 
Gesell forgot to give her the standard admonition he has given to 23 previous 
witnesses. A few minutes into her testimony, Keker gently reminded the 
78-year-old jurist of his oversight. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell, grinning broadly, leaned forward and told Hall that she was only to 
testify about her first-hand knowledge of events and not to base any of her 
answers on North's own testimony at the congressional hearings in July, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tells of Instructions 
</P>
<P>
Hall, 29, who is now working on a book in Los Angeles, said that North gave her 
instructions on Nov. 21, 1986, "to make some changes in a few System Four 
documents," the most sensitive category of records kept by the National 
Security Council, where North was a staff official. 
</P>
<P>
She said that the documents turned out to be a set of memos North had written 
the year before to his boss at the time, National Security Adviser Robert C. 
McFarlane, detailing the troubles of Nicaragua's rebels in the wake of a 
congressional cutoff in U.S. aid. 
</P>
<P>
McFarlane, in trial testimony last week, referred to the documents as "problem 
memos" because he said they indicated that North was actively raising private 
funds for the Contras and helping them purchase military equipment -- 
activities that McFarlane believed were questionable in light of the 
congressional prohibition. 
</P>
<P>
But McFarlane said that North insisted he simply had written the memos too 
loosely and that he actually was complying with the mandate of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, testifying under a grant of immunity from prosecution, said that North 
marked sections for her to retype, mainly to remove references to private 
fund-raising efforts for the Contras and sometimes to substitute language 
saying that the White House must obtain new funding from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
After a new memo was created, Hall said, North often would direct her to put a 
check mark in a box labeled "approve," as McFarlane had done. McFarlane had 
left the White House 11 months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if North had joked about going to jail, Hall said: "Yes, Col. North 
made jokes and there were jokes made about that. . . . He had a great sense of 
humor." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calls Action Unusual 
</P>
<P>
"This was a very unusual thing, wasn't it, to change original System Four 
documents?" Keker asked Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"I had not done it before," Hall replied. 
</P>
<P>
Her testimony supported at least three of 12 criminal charges on which North is 
being tried, including obstruction of Congress and a presidential inquiry and 
destruction of official records. 
</P>
<P>
Hall said that, when former President Ronald Reagan fired North and sealed off 
his office during an initial investigation into diversion of Iranian arms-sale 
profits to the Nicaraguan rebels, she smuggled out to North other sensitive 
documents that had been overlooked in their earlier shredding. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, Willard I. Zucker, an American-born lawyer living in Geneva, 
testified how he had set up secret Swiss bank accounts for North and two 
associates, former Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord and Albert A. Hakim, 
an Iranian-born businessmen, to handle the flow of Iranian arms-sale profits 
and other funds for the Contras.

The government Wednesday directed makers of prescription pain pills to add new 
warnings informing doctors that such drugs may increase the risk of 
life-threatening gastrointestinal problems such as ulcers. 
</P>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration announced that it had ordered manufacturers to 
add a warning citing studies that show that up to 4% of people who receive 
continued therapy with pain-relieving drugs may develop serious 
gastrointestinal reactions. 
</P>
<P>
The side effects, which include peptic ulcers and intestinal perforation, 
sometimes occur in people without any warning symptoms, the FDA noted. 
</P>
<P>
The prescription drugs in question are called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs, or NSAIDs. They generally are considered safer than steroid treatments, 
which they have largely replaced, and often are essential in treating serious 
arthritis. Some are approved for pain and menstrual cramps also. 
</P>
<P>
FDA data shows that the drugs are being prescribed for conditions, such as 
tendinitis, sprains or joint and muscle pain, that can be treated with other 
therapies bearing fewer side effects, according to the new labeling. 
</P>
<P>
FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young urged doctors "to discuss with their patients 
the risks and benefits of using these drugs." 
</P>
<P>
The drugs for which the new labels are required include: Voltaren, Nalfon, 
Tolectin, Indocin, Dolobid, Meclomen, Feldene, Ponstel, Anaprox, Naprosyn, 
Orudis, Butazolidin, Rufen, Motrin, Ansaid and generic versions of ibuprofen, 
indomethacin and phenylbutazone.

FREEZE URGED ON ROCKET FUEL SHIPMENT 
</P>

House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.) on Wednesday urged 
both President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III to freeze the 
shipment of a scarce rocket fuel component allegedly sought by Iran. He called 
it "a matter of grave national concern" and "extreme urgency." 
</P>
<P>
In joint letters, Aspin and another member of the military panel, Rep. James H. 
Bilbray (D-Nev.), expressed alarm that a federal judge in Houston may soon 
release 286,000 pounds of ammonium perchlorate to a Tampa shipper. 
</P>
<P>
The chemical, used as an oxidizer in fuel for rockets and missiles, was seized 
last year by the U.S. Customs Service when it was being transferred from an 
American ship to an Iranian freighter in the Dutch port of Rotterdam. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sizable Shipment' 
</P>
<P>
"Top Air Force officials have expressed reservations that securing adequate 
supplies of (the chemical) would assist the (Ayatollah Ruhollah) Khomeini 
regime in refueling its Soviet rockets and its own short-range 
surface-to-surface missiles," the letters said. "In the past, the Khomeini 
regime has used similar missiles to target cities" in its war with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The letters said that the "sizable shipment" is "desperately needed for 
domestic use" because one of the two U.S. producers of the chemical, Pacific 
Engineering &amp; Production Co. of Henderson, Nev., was destroyed in an 
explosion last May. 
</P>
<P>
The sole remaining producer, Kerr-McGee Corp., has offered to buy the impounded 
shipment, Aspin and Bilbray said. U.S. military and space programs require an 
estimated 60 million pounds of ammonium perchlorate each year, they added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seized by Customs 
</P>
<P>
Girindus Corp. of Tampa bought 286,000 pounds of the chemical from Pacific 
Engineering &amp; Production in January, 1988, and shipped it from Houston to 
Europe. The bill of lading showed that it was bound for a buyer in Basel, 
Switzerland. About a month later, however, Dutch authorities and the Customs 
Service seized the shipment as it was being loaded on an Iranian freighter. 
</P>
<P>
Girindus sued to get it back. Two weeks ago, U.S. District Judge Sim Lake ruled 
that the shipment had been illegally seized. He said that the government had 
offered no evidence of any diversion to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
But the judge set another hearing for Monday after the Customs Service filed 
papers demanding that the shipment be forfeited to the government on grounds 
that the listed destination was false. 
</P>
<P>
Customs Commissioner William von Raab has been unsuccessful in trying to get 
the State Department to withdraw an export license that was issued for the 
shipment last year. He also has encountered resistance from the Justice 
Department in his efforts to block the shipment on national security grounds. 
Officials at State and Justice have declined to explain their stands. 
</P>
<P>
Robert K. Givens, a Houston attorney representing Girindus, has denied that the 
firm was selling the chemical to Iran. He suggested that the intended buyer was 
connected to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Europe but would not 
give any details.

116 NATIONS ADOPT TREATY ON TOXIC WASTE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Delegates from 116 nations on Wednesday adopted an unprecedented treaty 
designed to restrict the international movement of toxic wastes. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-four of the delegates promptly signed the treaty, which was approved 
after 18 months of negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations. Among 
the countries that did not sign was the United States. Its delegates said that 
formal acceptance, as with any treaty, will be up to the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Other countries' delegates also said they will have to refer the treaty to 
their governments. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best we could do," said Andrew Sens, director of the State 
Department Office of Environment Protection, who was a member of the U.S. 
delegation. "There are a number of useful features. We will take it home and 
look at it." 
</P>
<P>
Many countries hailed the treaty, particularly members of the European 
Community, although the British delegate, the Earl of Caithness, who is an 
official of Britain's Environment Ministry, declared: 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the treaty doesn't go far enough. We should deal with all waste 
material, not just that considered hazardous." 
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace, the international environmental organization, expressed strong 
objections to the treaty. It had called for a complete ban on the export of 
toxic wastes. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Stairs, who headed a Greenpeace observer delegation, said: "The delegates 
didn't come close to realizing the potential of this conference. The convention 
as written is so weak that it will encourage the trade in hazardous wastes." 
</P>
<P>
Members of Greenpeace summed up their view of the conference's outcome by 
draping a huge banner across a building opposite the conference center with the 
message: "Danger. Basel Convention Legalizes Toxic Terror." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Geared to Protect Poor Nations 
</P>
<P>
In essence, the treaty is intended to prevent the wealthy industrial countries 
from dumping hazardous waste in the poorer nations of the Third World. But 
Mostafa Tolba, an Egyptian scientist who is executive director of the U.N. 
Environment Program, said: 
</P>
<P>
"Our agreement has not halted the commerce in poison. But it has signaled the 
international resolve to eliminate the menace (that) hazardous wastes pose to 
the welfare of our shared environment and to the health of all the world's 
peoples." 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said the most important provision of the treaty is a prohibition 
against hazardous waste being shipped to a country without that government's 
written consent. It also bans shipments through third countries without 
government authorization. 
</P>
<P>
These strictures are designed to end what some African nations have called 
"garbage imperialism." 
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace, and some African diplomats, complained privately that without a 
total ban on the movement of hazardous waste, corrupt governments will be 
tempted to accept toxic materials in exchange for large fees. 
</P>
<P>
The ambivalent attitude of many governments toward the treaty -- approving its 
concept by consensus yet harboring doubts about ratification -- was summed up 
by a delegate from Turkey, which has been a victim of dumping. 
</P>
<P>
"Turkey," he said, "has agreed to sign the global convention but believes that, 
as it stands, it has a number of weaknesses and that unless strengthened 
through appropriate instruments in the future, it has little chance of 
addressing and solving effectively the real issues." 
</P>
<P>
He urged tougher measures to deal with the problem. 
</P>
<P>
All the delegates accepted that toxic wastes, if not properly disposed of, can 
cause birth defects, miscarriages, various diseases including cancer and 
contamination of the Earth and water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the toxic waste transfer industry has become a big 
international business, for many developed countries have strict regulations 
against the local disposal of such contaminants. 
</P>
<P>
In the last year or so, public attention has been drawn to cargo ships that 
have loaded toxic waste materials for secret offloading in Third World 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
Poisonous ash has been dumped on Haitian beaches, drums of toxic industrial 
waste in Lebanon, lethal garbage in Djibouti and other African sites. The deals 
have usually been worked out through waste contractors with operators in the 
unwary host countries. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, once people realized that their country was being used as a 
dumping ground, the ships were forced to take back their noxious cargoes, and 
some have been forced to move from port to port in a vain effort to find a 
willing recipient. 
</P>
<P>
One ship, the Karin B, recently dumped its cargo contaminated with carcinogenic 
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from Italy at Koko Beach, Nigeria, then was 
forced to take it back. It was last reported swinging at anchor off the Italian 
port of Leghorn, its cargo still on board. 
</P>
<P>
But another cargo ship, the Khian Sea, appears to have beaten the game. 
According to Greenpeace researchers, the Khian Sea carried toxic ash from 
Philadelphia around the Caribbean Sea for two years, then made its way to the 
Indian Ocean and recently reappeared -- empty. 
</P>
<P>
The Greenpeace people believe the cargo was simply dumped at sea.

SOVIET ELECTION CAMPAIGNING UNLEASHES YEARS OF FRUSTRATION 
</P>

<P>
Years' worth of pent-up political frustration are pouring forth in the Soviet 
Union's current parliamentary elections as candidates and their supporters 
scramble for their first real chance at power in decades. 
</P>
<P>
From working-class suburbs to such august institutions as the Soviet Academy of 
Sciences, people are starting to say "no" to the diktats of Communist Party, 
government and other bureaucrats and not only insisting that they be heard but 
also asserting their right to elect their own candidates for the nationwide 
elections this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
In a rare rebellion at the Soviet Academy of Sciences, one of the most typical 
organizations of the Soviet Establishment, nearly half the members, 
corresponding members and other delegates to its electoral meeting refused this 
week to vote for any of the 23 candidates nominated by the academy leadership 
for its 20 special seats in the new legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they crossed out most or even all the nominees' names -- only eight 
candidates received enough votes to be elected -- and thus forced another round 
of voting next month, when liberals such as Andrei D. Sakharov, the Nobel Peace 
Prize winner, can be nominated. 
</P>
<P>
On Moscow's Gorky Street, across from the City Hall, more than 7,000 supporters 
of Boris N. Yeltsin, the former Moscow party leader who is running in virtual 
opposition to the party, rallied Wednesday evening for the second time this 
week to protest what they called unfair and illegal restrictions on his 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Yel-tsin! Yel-tsin!" they called in a rhythmic chant that could be heard down 
in Red Square and the Kremlin. The party's attempts to defeat Yeltsin, ousted 
from the ruling Politburo a year ago for his radical populism, appear instead 
to have boosted his standing, among blue-collar workers and intellectuals 
alike, adding to his challenge to the party leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"Down with Ligachev!" the demonstrators shouted, denouncing Yegor K. Ligachev, 
the Politburo's leading conservative, who is widely seen as Yeltsin's main 
antagonist in the party's Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
In the political shorthand of this campaign, which is already a unique event in 
Soviet history, Yeltsin has come to represent the common man's deep and 
difficult-to-express resentment of the party, its leadership and its 
apparatchiki for all that they have bungled over the years and are still 
bungling today -- and Ligachev has become the personification of all that they 
resent. 
</P>
<P>
Pulling out their red party membership cards, still the passports to privilege 
in a have-not society, many of the demonstrators said they are ready to quit if 
Yeltsin is defeated. Police contained the unauthorized demonstration but did 
not actively intervene. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the quiet chambers of the Soviet Peace Committee, where the carefully 
scripted talk is usually of the brotherhood of man, the common values of 
humanity and the need for reconciliation, delegates choosing the committee's 
representatives in the Congress of People's Deputies rebelled in their own 
small way this week. 
</P>
<P>
They unhesitatingly dropped Georgy A. Arbatov, the longtime director of the 
Institute of the U.S.A. and Canada, after public complaints that he was an 
autocrat and a man who reflected the old "time of stagnation" rather than the 
present "new political thinking." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, to the surprise of the official Soviet news agency Tass, which had 
expected Arbatov's election, they chose a medical researcher from Siberia, the 
editor of a rural magazine from Byelorussia and the patriarch of the Russian 
Orthodox Church as well as the Peace Committee's chairman and vice chairman to 
represent it in the congress. 
</P>
<P>
"People are sick and tired of being dictated to," a speaker at Wednesday's 
rally for Yeltsin declared as a city official stood by, glowering ferociously 
but not intervening. 
</P>
<P>
Although Soviet voters have no ability, even under the latest political 
reforms, to work big changes in the country's leadership through the 
parliamentary elections, they are finding, as much through experimentation as a 
thought-out strategy, that they can at least use the contests to say things 
that in the past could not have been said. 
</P>
<P>
But they are also finding that, when they focus their efforts on narrow 
targets, such as the election of Yeltsin or the rejection of the Academy of 
Sciences' slate of deputies, they do have at least a bit of power. 
</P>
<P>
"This rejection of the 'party list' was necessary, though there were worthy 
people on it," Sakharov said after the Academy of Sciences meeting concluded 
Wednesday. "Now we can make our own choice. We can choose 12 new people or 
remain with the previous ones if we wish." 
</P>
<P>
Sakharov, along with other leading liberal scientists, was nominated by a 
number of "work collectives" at major research institutes but was excluded from 
the officially proposed list of candidates from the Academy of Sciences. 
Attempts to reopen the nominations were frustrated by the academy leadership, 
and a public demonstration by angry scientists last month brought little 
result. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a new political system, and we are still discovering how it works, 
when it works, if it works," a participant in the Academy of Sciences meeting 
commented. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Soviet voters will go to the polls in 1,500 territorial 
constituencies for two houses of the Congress of People's Deputies in the 
country's first contested national elections since the earliest days of the 
Soviet state. Although about a quarter of the candidates, usually local party 
officials, are unopposed, most of the other races are being fiercely fought to 
the end. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new political reforms, 750 additional seats in a third house of the 
congress are being filled with representatives of "public organizations." These 
range from the Communist Party and the trade union federation, which each chose 
100 deputies, through a variety of scientific and artistic unions to a number 
of small groups, such as temperance campaigners and stamp collectors. 
</P>
<P>
From among these 2,250 deputies, about 450 will be chosen as members of the new 
and strengthened Supreme Soviet, which will become a full-time legislative body 
whose chairman, certain to be Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the party's general 
secretary, will be the country's president.

JAPAN TO CHALLENGE U.S. SHIFT IN FSX DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Japan is preparing to ask the Bush Administration to soften its bid to change 
the terms of a controversial agreement for joint U.S.-Japanese development of 
the new FSX fighter plane, intended to be an advanced version of the American 
F-16, U.S. officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The message will be delivered by Japanese Vice Minister of Defense Seiki 
Nishihiro, who is flying here today to meet with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney 
and Brent Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Nishihiro's sub-Cabinet rank, his visit is intended as a signal of how 
much political importance Japan attaches to the FSX deal. He will be traveling 
here as the personal envoy of Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said that, if the two governments cannot come to agreement on 
the terms, Japan probably will seek to fill its defense needs temporarily by 
manufacturing more F-15 fighters, which it now co-produces under U.S. 
franchise. It then would develop a new fighter on its own. 
</P>
<P>
But the officials said that the rejection would have a major impact on broader 
U.S.-Japanese relations. Japan almost certainly would begin viewing the United 
States as an unreliable supplier of technology. And the sense of alliance 
between the two countries would be undermined, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Approval of the FSX project would mark the first time that the United States 
and Japan have joined forces to develop a new military weapons system for 
Japan. Critics fear that it also will give Tokyo the technology it needs to 
build a civilian aircraft industry to compete with that of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The developments came as congressional opponents, including several 
Republicans, intensified their criticism of the agreement in the face of Bush's 
decision to go ahead with the deal, pending some changes in the agreement that 
the two sides negotiated last year. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.), one of the most vocal critics of the 
arrangement in recent weeks, called the accord "a bad deal for America and for 
American workers." And Sen. Alan J. Dixon (D-Ill.) said he is "disappointed" 
that Bush is not scuttling the deal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bush Sure of Congress 
</P>
<P>
Bush Administration officials said that, despite the opposition, the President 
still is confident that Congress will not overturn the FSX deal. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration says it plans to formally notify Capitol Hill of the accord 
as soon as Japan has agreed to the proposed changes. The two houses would have 
30 days to express disapproval, either by resolution or by formal legislation 
designed to block the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Bush told the Japanese on Monday that he wants Tokyo to guarantee in advance 
that it will allocate a major part of the eventual production work on the new 
FSX -- U.S. officials cited a minimum of 40% of the total -- to American firms 
and workers. 
</P>
<P>
And he wants the accord to spell out the existing technology that will be used 
in the project so that the United States can better claim access to new spinoff 
advances developed by the joint project. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Kichiro Tazawa, head of Japan's defense agency, said after a Cabinet 
meeting in Tokyo that the United States should "respect the joint-development 
memoranda of understanding" that the two sides developed after 18 months of 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The original accord "is not something that should be changed, and we want to 
ensure that it is not changed," Tazawa said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said that rejection of the FSX would probably benefit some 
American companies, such as New York's Grumman Corp. and Calabasas-based 
Lockheed Corp., which would probably obtain some contracts if Japan decides to 
go it alone on its own fighter. 
</P>
<P>
But they said that the total U.S. share in such a case would be nowhere near 
the 40% that American firms such as General Dynamics Corp. of St. Louis already 
are guaranteed during the development of the FSX fighter.

IN COLORADO, RECKLESS SKIING IS PURSUED AS A FELONY

Concluding that reckless skiing is tantamount to reckless driving, a Colorado 
prosecutor is pressing felony charges against two out-of-control skiers who 
collided with children in separate accidents that left an 11-year-old Iowa girl 
dead and an 8-year-old San Diego boy seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
The charges are believed to be among the first of their kind, but "I suspect 
they won't be the last," said Dist. Atty. Gregory Long, who filed them this 
week in Grand County. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any difference between this and being hit by a car on a sidewalk 
or in a school parking lot," Long said. "You don't get magical exemption from 
responsibility because you're on a set of skis." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Believes in Licensing 
</P>
<P>
Concerns about reckless skiing were echoed at resorts around the nation 
Wednesday, and one expert doing a study for Mammoth Mountain said his research 
has convinced him that skiers should be licensed. 
</P>
<P>
Charged in Colorado Tuesday were Howard Hidle, 31, of North Richland Hills, 
Tex., and Terrence Coghlan, 38, of Steamboat Springs, Colo. Both could face 
stiff prison terms if convicted. Neither could be reached for comment 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Hidle is accused of manslaughter in the Feb. 17 death of Kari Meylor, a Sioux 
City, Iowa, girl who died of head injuries after being struck at the base of a 
practice hill at the Winter Park resort. 
</P>
<P>
Coghlan is charged with second-degree assault, child abuse and reckless 
endangerment in an incident a week later at Steamboat Springs, where Russell 
Wittman was seriously injured while vacationing with his family. 
</P>
<P>
Long said both defendants skied past signs and barriers. "The witnesses felt 
their conduct was beyond mere negligence or mistakes," Long said. Hidle and 
Coghlan both escaped serious injury, he added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calls for Stiffer Laws 
</P>
<P>
Steve Wittman, a San Diego attorney, has been pushing for tougher laws on the 
slopes since the Feb. 24 accident that left his son with a shattered leg. 
</P>
<P>
Reckless skiers are not held accountable in part because it is not mandatory to 
report accidents on the slopes, Wittman believes. He has written Colorado 
legislators and ski industry officials to urge such legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"Ski resorts naturally want everyone to think it's a glowing, beautiful day on 
the slopes," Wittman said. "The hope is that everyone will lick their wounds, 
go away from the ski resort and not get involved in any litigation." 
</P>
<P>
He said Coghlan "appeared out of nowhere" and flew 40 feet through the air 
before hitting Russell Wittman at a speed later estimated at 50 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Coghlan sent a friend back up the slope to retrieve his ski, which Steve 
Wittman was clutching. When he confronted the frantic father, Coghlan "was 
smiling" and "denied ever seeing Russell," Wittman recalled, adding that 
Coghlan never apologized. Russell may eventually need surgery to repair his 
leg. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Applauds Charges 
</P>
<P>
At Winter Park, resort spokeswoman Paula Sheridan applauded the criminal 
charges in the Meylor death. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to get word out that reckless skiing just will not be tolerated, and 
this is ultimately what can happen," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Several ski resorts said that they have extensive skier education programs and 
patrols to combat recklessness and that the slopes are actually safer than 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
The National Ski Areas Assn., a Springfield, Mass., trade organization 
representing the nation's 600 ski resorts, reported a 300% decline in the 
number of injuries over the last 38 years. 
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Lynn Murphy said there are currently about 2 1/2 injuries per 1,000 
skiers, and one fatality per 2 million. About 54 million lift tickets are sold 
around the country each year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We would support the concept of prosecuting reckless skiers where proper laws 
apply," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
Concern over reckless skiers prompted Mammoth Mountain to commission a study 
profiling the offenders. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Tikalsky, a psychology professor and insurance industry consultant from 
Dillon, Mont., and his wife, former Olympic skier Linda Meyers, have 
interviewed more than 500 people and reviewed more than 2,500 accident reports 
from Mammoth so far and expect to submit their report next month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Focus Is on Men 
</P>
<P>
They found that most reckless skiers are men between 18 and 26 who have been 
skiing about three years and have accidents while skiing in groups. 
</P>
<P>
Tikalsky, a skier himself, favors tough measures to combat the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you should have to have a license to ski," he said, adding that 
mandatory ski schools would also help. Criminal charges would also be a 
deterrent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you have to do it too many times for the community to get the 
message." 
</P>
<P>
But resorts "are stuck between a rock and a hard place," said Jim Mitchell, who 
manages Crystal Mountain Resort, about 75 miles east of Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we have a sport here for people who are looking for something 
different, fast, exciting, the wind in your hair . . . and, as we all know, 
mountains have inherent dangers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But at the same time we're inviting them, we're slapping rules and regulations 
on a large element of the population that's affecting a small element of the 
population, and taking some of the fun out of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Crystal Mountain tries to reward caution by giving away daily passes to 15- to 
25-year-olds "who we feel are exhibiting the right kinds of behavior," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At Killington, Vt., the largest ski resort in the East, spokeswoman Laura 
Wittern agreed that criminal "charges might make people stop and think twice." 
</P>
<P>
Researcher Lisa Romaine also contributed to this story.

Bones thought possibly to be the remains of a 17-year-old victim of serial 
killer Ted Bundy turned out to be those of animals, a sheriff said. 
</P>
<P>
Utah State Crime Laboratory examiners determined that the bones found Friday 
outside Capitol Reef National Park were those of a cow and coyote, Wayne County 
Sheriff Kerry Ekker said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bundy was executed on Jan. 24 in Florida. Before he died, he told detectives 
that he had killed eight women in Utah but identified only three of them. One 
was Nancy Wilcox, whom he said he had buried near the park, 200 miles south of 
Salt Lake City.

7 CITED IN RAIDS AGAINST ILLEGAL KEEPING OF FERRETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN BRAUN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After an 11-month undercover investigation, state game wardens cracked down on 
ferret fanciers over the last week, raiding homes in Los Angeles, Orange and 
San Bernardino counties and issuing citations against seven people accused of 
illegally keeping 36 of the weasel-like animals as pets. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the State Department of Fish and Game said those cited in the 
raids, including three in Los Angeles County, would be charged with violations 
of state laws that prohibit the possession, transportation and importation of 
ferrets. Officials also seized six desert tortoises, three polecats and a 
raccoon. 
</P>
<P>
Curt Taucher, a department spokesman, said the raids were carried out between 
last Thursday and Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
He said the investigation began in April after agents saw a newspaper ad 
featuring ferrets for sale and a state undercover agent bought one, then 
continued making contact with underground breeders of the animals. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrets, also known as "European polecats," are in the weasel and raccoon 
family. State officials estimate that there are 250,000 to 500,000 being kept 
illegally in California and say they sell for as much as $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Although owners say the animals make good pets, state laws forbid the breeding 
and sale of ferrets because they pose a hazard to children and wildlife, 
Taucher said. Ferrets carry a strain of rabies that cannot be eliminated by any 
known vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Richards, a Yucaipa woman who heads the Southern California Ferret 
Assn., was one of those cited by state game wardens, who also raided homes in 
Los Angeles, Lawndale and Sherman Oaks. Richards, who lost 22 ferrets, accused 
state agents of a setup. 
</P>
<P>
Taucher said that although Richards has "every right to advocate legalizing 
ferrets," she is not free to own them. 
</P>
<P>
Each violation she and the others face carries a maximum penalty of six months 
imprisonment and a $1,000 fine.

N. Y. GOVERNING BOARD ILLEGAL, JUSTICES RULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the structure of the Board of 
Estimate, New York City's unique central governing body, is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
In deciding that the board's voting procedures violate the "one person one 
vote" provisions of the equal protection clause of the Constitution, the court 
set the stage for a major governmental overhaul in the nation's largest city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Major Challenge' 
</P>
<P>
"It is clear we will have to make major changes," said Peter L. Zimroth, New 
York's corporation counsel. ". . . It will be a major governmental challenge." 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, it is expected the 88-year-old Board of Estimate will 
operate as usual while a Charter Revision Commission proposes alternatives 
either to be added to the ballot in this year's hotly contested mayoral 
election or in a special election. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-member Board of Estimate has far more influence than the 35-member 
City Council. The board is made up of the mayor, the city comptroller and City 
Council president, who have two votes, and all five borough presidents, who 
have one vote each. 
</P>
<P>
Among its key duties, the board approves contracts, determines the use of land, 
grants franchises and takes part in a limited way in the budget-making process. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Touch Residents' Lives 
</P>
<P>
Its powers widely touch the lives of New York's 7 million residents in such 
matters as deciding whether to lease a city building as a homeless shelter, 
establishing a drug counseling center in a neighborhood or voting whether a 
block in Manhattan is suitable for a high rise apartment house. 
</P>
<P>
The case was brought by a group of voters in Brooklyn, the borough with the 
largest population in New York, who challenged the doctrine that other boroughs 
with smaller populations should have equal representation on the board. 
</P>
<P>
"The highest court in the land has spoken," said Brooklyn Borough President 
Howard Golden. "Now, we all must work together to develop a system of weighted 
voting for the Board of Estimate which better protects the rights of all our 
people." 
</P>
<P>
"The charter commission now has to move full speed ahead," said Mayor Edward I. 
Koch after being informed of the court's decision. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal lawyers said they believe federal courts will allow the Board of 
Estimate to continue to operate as usual until a new structure is approved by 
the voters.

A car swerved into a group of bicyclists riding the shoulder of U.S. 101, 
killing one, cutting off the leg of another and causing minor injuries to a 
third Wednesday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Eugene Bishop, 56, of Buellton, was booked for investigation of 
vehicular manslaughter with alcohol involved, said California Highway Patrol 
Officer Tom Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
The bicycle riders were believed to include members of a cycling club from 
nearby Goleta, west of Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Five cyclists were riding south on the eight-foot-wide shoulder of the coast 
highway, when the car swerved into them. The car hit one rider, cutting off one 
of his legs just below the hip. It then struck and killed a second bicyclist. 
One other rider suffered minor injuries from flying debris, Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
The name of the dead cyclist was withheld. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Foraker, 23, of Goleta was in critical condition because of the loss of his 
leg and internal injuries. Shari Rogers, 24, of Goleta received minor injuries. 
The other two cyclists in the group were not hit. 
</P>
<P>
The cyclists were struck just south of this seaside town 15 miles northwest of 
Santa Barbara. The scenic route near Gaviota State Park and along the Santa 
Barbara Channel is popular with cyclists.

ROSE MAY GET NEWS TODAY: A SUSPENSION IS EXPECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
PLANT CITY, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pete Rose spent another day surrounded by cameras and guards and questions, but 
Wednesday night there were indications that his third day of twisting in the 
wind would be his last. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Peter Ueberroth is expected to make a statement about Rose today, 
and barring a last-minute development, the manager of the Cincinnati Reds 
likely will be suspended for at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
He is accused of gambling and associating with gamblers, and as the scandal has 
unfolded there have been revealing stories about both his debts (huge) and his 
relationship with his children (distant). 
</P>
<P>
Owner Marge Schott of the Reds said Wednesday by telephone from Cincinnati that 
she is in contact with Ueberroth's office and has not been told what he will 
decide. She denied published reports that she might fire Rose. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what will happen, but I want him to win a World Series for me," 
Schott said. "We have a good relationship. We have the same hometown. We're 
dealing with a hero here. But at the same time, I told the commissioner's 
office, 'We don't need this in baseball.' " 
</P>
<P>
A decision by Ueberroth would end three nervous days for the Reds that began 
late Monday when major league baseball issued a mysterious announcement that 
Rose was being investigated for "serious allegations." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, his life has been one of minicams and tape recorders and 
photographers. A television crew interrupted his breakfast at a local 
restaurant Wednesday, and armed guards accompanied him through much of his day. 
</P>
<P>
When he took the two-minute stroll to the dugout at Plant City Stadium 
Wednesday afternoon, he had a policeman on either shoulder. He had crews of 
minicams behind him. He had a middle-aged woman leaning over a dugout rail 
yelling, "Hang in there, Pete." He had dozens of fans offering applause or 
cheers or other words of encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, he smiled and motioned toward his entourage. "Me and my shadows," 
he began to sing. 
</P>
<P>
Later, in a more private aside, he said, "I feel like a fresh piece of meat." 
</P>
<P>
Six Red pitchers made fun of the situation, putting pieces of tape with the 
word, "Press," on their caps. 
</P>
<P>
After a day when he walled himself off from much of the outside world, Rose 
returned Wednesday, sitting in the dugout and answering questions for an hour 
before a 7-6 exhibition loss to the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Already the subject of an investigation of "serious allegations" by major 
league baseball, he was hit full bore with several embarrassing and serious 
charges this week. 
</P>
<P>
The most serious is that he bet on major league baseball games, and even if 
nothing else is found to be true that would get him a one-year suspension. If 
it's found he bet on games involving his Reds, he'll be barred for life. 
</P>
<P>
There was more. The Dayton Daily News reported that a federal grand jury will 
call him to answer questions about illegal gambling and tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported that Rose had sold the bat and ball from his 
record-breaking 4,192nd hit to a Cincinnati collector for $175,000. A Corvette, 
a gift from Schott that bore the license plates "PR4192," was also sold. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also said he had taken out a second mortgage for $150,000 on his 
home in the exclusive Indian Hill section of Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Post said in Wednesday's editions that Rose's activities have the 
attention of the Internal Revenue Service, plus the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation and the Cincinnati police. The New York newspaper quoted an 
unnamed source as saying Cincinnati police estimate the Red manager owes 
bookmakers between $500,000 and $750,000. WLWT-TV in Cincinnati said it spoke 
with Michael Fry, who was tied to Rose's gambling in a Sports Illustrated story 
this week. The station said that Fry, who is serving a prison term for cocaine 
trafficking and income-tax evasion, said that Rose bet up to $40,000 on 
football weekends.

At the same time that news reports were describing his gambling debts and 
alleged financial problems, the April issue of "Gentleman's Quarterly" presents 
an unflattering portrait of his private life, saying he barely has time for his 
children. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about being described as a bad father, he said Wednesday, "What are 
you talking about? I'm a great father. I bought my daughter a Mercedes Benz 
last year. Those statements were probably made 10 years ago. My son just spent 
15 days with me, and we were together 20 hours a day."

NCAA BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT;

ALL IN ALL, MOSTLY IT HAS BEEN A BALL FOR FORGOTTEN SETON HALL

The autograph hounds by the tunnel entrance to the McNichols Arena floor did 
not turn out for Seton Hall. They came instead for Indiana and Arizona and 
Nevada Las Vegas, the teams that have done this sort of thing before. 
</P>
<P>
For the Pirates, it is all gloriously new. Seton Hall made its first trip to 
the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. tournament last season and lost in the 
second round. Now the Pirates are in the Sweet 16, and they play Indiana 
tonight for a sweeter spot, a place in the West Regional final Saturday. Here 
at the West Regional, they are the only team that has never been to the Final 
Four. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona and UNLV play in the second game today. 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall's lone claim to national prominence was as the National Invitation 
Tournament champion in 1953, back when that tournament still meant something. 
</P>
<P>
Was it 14 months ago that Seton Hall Coach P.J. Carlesimo was booed at the 
Meadowlands, where the Pirates play their home games? And just a month ago that 
he was cheered there for merely walking past the court during a game between 
Arizona and Duke? 
</P>
<P>
Now, he is -- by his own somewhat baffled admission -- one of the game's hot 
young coaches, along with Xavier's Pete Gillen and Evansville's Jim Crews, 
among others. 
</P>
<P>
After running his team through a public shootaround in McNichols Arena so loose 
and full of ease that it ended with Carlesimo attempting three 75-foot shots in 
a friendly bet with his players, he paused to reflect. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, before a strong finish helped Seton Hall into the tournament, his 
job was on the line. The season's culmination earned him Big East Conference 
coach of the year honors, and he was awarded a five-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
Things changed fast. 
</P>
<P>
"It could change again 14 months from now if we don't win too many more games," 
Carlesimo said. 
</P>
<P>
His attitude is colored in part by reaction to numerous recent firings of 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a disgrace the caliber of coach that has been forced to resign," 
Carlesimo said. "The quality of people let go in the past couple years is a 
disgrace. I'm just proud that Seton Hall gave me a chance. I'm very sensitive 
to the fact that it could be someone else sitting up here." 
</P>
<P>
Could be, but isn't. Tonight, he will take his team against Bob Knight, who was 
coaching at Army while Carlesimo was still a benchrider at Fordham. 
</P>
<P>
"He couldn't remember me playing," Carlesimo said. "He'd be lying if he saw me 
play. He might have seen me there, but not in the game. Those were close 
games." 
</P>
<P>
Knight's association with Carlesimo also stems from a friendship with 
Carlesimo's father Pete, who until recently was the director of the 
organization that runs the NIT. 
</P>
<P>
"I've know P.J. since he was this high," Knight said. "I think he's done a 
great job putting this team together." 
</P>
<P>
Carlesimo has put this team together, drawing together a group that can 
challenge Big East rival Georgetown for Olympic flavor. Georgetown may have 
U.S. Olympic Coach John Thompson and Olympian Charles Smith, but Seton Hall has 
two Olympians of its own. 
</P>
<P>
Neither one, however, is American. Carlesimo first saw Andrew Gaze, who played 
for Australia in the Olympics and averaged 24 points a game, when Gaze was 
making a tour of the Big East with an Australian team in 1986. He scored 46 
points against Seton Hall, and averaged more than 30 against Big East teams. 
</P>
<P>
"It was, uh, evident he could help us," said Carlesimo, who finally was able to 
persuade Gaze to join up only after the Seoul Olympics. Although this is 
considered Gaze's final year of eligibility, the school is appealing to the 
NCAA for an extra year. Whether Gaze would take it is uncertain. His first 
loyalty clearly is to his national team, of which he is the hero. 
</P>
<P>
The other Olympian is Ramon Ramos, the 6-foot-8, 250-pound center from Puerto 
Rico whom Carlesimo first saw when Ramos was about 14 and Carlesimo was 
coaching for the summer in a Puerto Rican league. 
</P>
<P>
The other three starters -- Darryl Walker, John Morton and Gerald Greene, are 
from New York. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the group has forged a 28-6 record that includes three losses to 
Syracuse -- and a victory at St. John's, the school's first in 75 years. 
</P>
<P>
For a victory over Georgetown, the Pirates sold out the Meadowlands for the 
first time ever for a college regular-season game. 
</P>
<P>
All this recent success has turned heads to Carlesimo, who isn't taking much 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a different coach than I was a few years ago," he insists. "It's just 
that the players are playing better." 
</P>
<P>
Next season, with five starters likely gone, no telling what will happen in the 
Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
Carlesimo has a standard response to that kind of talk. "No point in worrying." 
</P>
<P>
That is precisely the easy manner and lack of obvious egotism that has made him 
universally well-liked by Big East coaches, a bunch known for internal 
squabbles. Apparently, they have set other things aside to agree on one thing 
the past two seasons -- Carlesimo as conference coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
West Regional Notes 
</P>
<P>
Arizona beat Nevada Las Vegas, 86-75, in December in a game in which Sean 
Elliott had 32 points and 15 rebounds. Much speculation Wednesday centered on 
how UNLV would try to defend Elliott this time. Said UNLV's Greg Anthony: "I 
don't understand why (anyone) thinks we'll do anything different. Well, I guess 
I could. All we've done in practice is stabilize our strengths, our man-to-man 
defense and pressure. He's a great player. We're going to have to have as much 
help as possible because he's so versatile, because of his size and because of 
his ability on the perimeter." . . . Seton Hall's Ramon Ramos, who injured his 
back in a first-round game against Southwest Missouri State, is less than 100% 
-- he termed it 95% -- but is expected to play as usual. "Even at less than 
100%, he's still an effective player," Coach P.J. Carlesimo said.

ROZELLE'S SURPRISE -- HE RESIGNS; 
</P>
<P>
NFL COMMISSIONER WANTS TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH FAMILY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Pete Rozelle chose a warm afternoon on the desert, in the midst of a convention 
of people he has known for decades, to step down as commissioner of the 
National Football League, an office he has held for the last 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
The end for Rozelle was as abrupt and as surprising as the beginning. Almost no 
one expected him to be elevated in 1960 -- when at 33 he was a relative child 
among the men of the NFL -- and his resignation Wednesday was equally 
unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
As the league's club owners began making plans to replace him this summer with 
two people -- a president as well as a commissioner -- Rozelle said that his 
health at age 63 had nothing to do with his decision, which was prompted, he 
added, by just one consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to spend some stress-free time with my family," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Exhibiting the same astuteness in geography that he often showed as a 
commisssioner, Rozelle said that after helping with his successor's transition 
period, he will relocate to San Diego from Rye, N.Y., where he has lived in 
recent years with his wife, Carrie. 
</P>
<P>
The first NFL move Rozelle made in 1960 was to transfer the league's 
headquarters from Philadelphia to New York -- "because that's the capital of 
America," he said then. 
</P>
<P>
But he had been born in California, in the South Gate area of Los Angeles, and 
30 years in the suburbs of New York were obviously enough. His first move in 
retirement will be to come home. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes called the most influential sports commissioner in America, Rozelle 
was a prime developer of a league that has grown so expansively -- in so many 
complex ways -- that no one person could lead it in the 1990s. Or so many 
owners believe. 
</P>
<P>
They prefer a league with two equally responsible chiefs, a president and a 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
"The president would deal with the business aspects of the game," said 
Cleveland's Art Modell, one of the owners favoring twin leadership. "He could 
be someone like Jack Kemp." 
</P>
<P>
A former Buffalo Bills quarterback and congressman, Kemp is now in President 
Bush's cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
"The commissioner would be responsible for the integrity of the game," Modell 
said. "He could be someone like (Judge) Matt Byrne or (Justice) Byron White." 
</P>
<P>
Doing it all has kept Rozelle hopping, Modell said. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete grew up with the league," he added. "Pete was there when the changes were 
made. That's how he could stay abreast. I don't see that anyone else can. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a president to represent the owners in labor negotiations, in 
television negotiations, and in all our other business affairs. And we need a 
commissioner to represent all the people of the league in the integrity things 
-- gambling, street drugs, steroids and all the rest." 
</P>
<P>
It is a measure of Rozelle that he has been able to make the commissioner's 
office effective in both business activities and in areas of integrity. 
Financially, he negotiated the first billion-dollar TV contracts in sports, 
persuading all three networks -- CBS, NBC and ABC -- to join in and work 
together. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete led pro football's march into the realm of television," Ram President 
Georgia Frontiere said. "He made our game accessible to all Americans." 
</P>
<P>
Rozelle has also been a restless opponent of gambling, once banishing two 
popular players, Paul Hornung and Alex Karras, for a year for making small bets 
on their own teams. 
</P>
<P>
Drugs have been more difficult. The centerpiece of Rozelle's war against street 
drugs was random testing, which has been thrown out by the courts. But this 
week, in his last official move, he outlined a tougher anti-steroids program 
that will begin this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Raider owner Al Davis, Rozelle's main antagonist in the courts, said: "He was a 
great competitor and we had our competitions, but I always respected him and I 
think he respects me. We got caught in a Vietnam affair for the past 10 years 
and that was unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
Rozelle came into sports as a publicist, beginning as a Ram public relations 
assistant in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
By 1952, he was in charge of Ram public relations. And in 1957, after a brief 
vacation from football as an airline publicist, he became general manager of 
the Rams. He had turned 30 that year. Three years later, he was NFL 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Rozelle is remembered in Los Angeles as no more than an average public 
relations man and as a somewhat better general manager, but his old friends 
have always said that he found his real home in the commissioner's office. 
"Pete was born to be a commissioner," Times football reporter Frank Finch said 
a quarter-century ago, after disagreeing with some of Rozelle's judgments as a 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, Rozelle's long suit as an NFL executive has been his facility in 
bringing opponents together. "The thing that makes (him what he is) is his 
ability to get everyone on the same page," said Lamar Hunt, owner of the Kansas 
City Chiefs, who as president of the American Football Conference will be on 
the search committee for Rozelle's successor. 
</P>
<P>
Wellington Mara, owner of the New York Giants and also a member of the search 
committee as president of the National Football Conference, said the NFL 
constitution provides for a two-thirds vote for commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
With 28 clubs, 19 votes will be required, said Mara, who 30 years ago was 
instrumental in Rozelle's election. 
</P>
<P>
In other important NFL matters, the requirement is 21 votes. "Don't ask me 
why," Mara said. "That's the way (the constitution) reads." 
</P>
<P>
Modell, placing Rozelle in NFL history, said: "We've had two giants, George 
Halas and Pete Rozelle. Halas founded the league, and Pete played the biggest 
role in our (development)." 
</P>
<P>
Art McNally, supervisor of officials, said Rozelle's announcement "came as a 
shock to all of us." 
</P>
<P>
Taking note, Rozelle said: "Carrie and I are in trouble with all our friends. 
They won't believe this." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Browne, the NFL's director of communications, was informed just a few hours 
before the public announcement. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll remember that Carrie's son, Jack -- Jack Kent Cooke II -- died suddenly 
in January," Browne said. "They felt very close to him, and I think that was a 
(major factor) in Pete's decision. It made him realize how important a man's 
family time is." 
</P>
<P>
Rozelle leaves with two years left on his $1-million-a-year NFL contract. "He's 
as healthy as he tells people he is," Browne said. "Since he stopped smoking 
(more than a year ago), his voice has come back strong." 
</P>
<P>
The problem with discarding cigarettes, Rozelle said, is, "I've put on 30 
pounds." 
</P>
<P>
Asked what it takes to make an effective commissioner, Rozelle thought a moment 
before responding with one word: "Patience." 
</P>
<P>
One of the things that he remembers most fondly was his 1960 ascension -- 
"Being elected by a ringing mandate." 
</P>
<P>
The hardest thing he has done? "Leaving after 30 years." 
</P>
<P>
His verdict on the Rozelle Era? "I did my best." 
</P>
<P>
This time next year, Rozelle said, he will be playing tennis or fishing, and 
reading about the latest sports problem, instead of trying to solve it. He is a 
deep-water fisherman who expects to have his own boat in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Today, on the last day of his last convention, Rozelle will preside over a 
group that is bitterly divided over whether to continue instant-replay 
officiating. 
</P>
<P>
The vote will come before noon. 
</P>
<P>
Rozelle is in favor.

MICHIGAN COACH STEVE FISHER ISN'T A ROOKIE, HE'S NOW 2-0 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Michigan and Missouri have more in common these days than the design of their 
jerseys, which feature oversized block M's followed by the other seven letters 
in their names in smaller script. 
</P>
<P>
Both were guided through the opening weekend of the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. basketball tournament by assistant coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri's Rich Daly, though, had at least several weeks to prepare for the 
tournament, taking over Feb. 9, when Coach Norm Stewart became ill on a 
Missouri flight to Oklahoma and was hospitalized for colon surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan's Steve Fisher had only 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher was promoted March 15, when former coach Bill Frieder resigned and 
accepted an offer to coach at Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher will be in charge for only the third time on the collegiate level 
tonight at Rupp Arena, where the 10th-ranked Wolverines (26-7) play 
fifth-ranked North Carolina (29-7) in the semifinals of the Southeast Regional. 
</P>
<P>
His opponent, Dean Smith, has coached more than 850 games at North Carolina, 
winning more than all but six other coaches and reaching the round of 16 in the 
NCAA tournament each of the last nine seasons. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't too long ago, Fisher said, that he stood in a crowd at a coaching 
clinic in Chicago and asked Smith for his autograph. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher, though, is not awed by tonight's matchup. 
</P>
<P>
"When you start to play, I don't think you feel like you're matching wits with 
anyone," he said. "You're just trying to make good decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Outwardly, at least, not much seems to faze Fisher, who is described by friends 
as quiet and unassuming and by his players as cool and calm. 
</P>
<P>
And why shouldn't he be? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a rookie coach," he has stressed repeatedly in countless interviews 
with reporters this week and last. "I've coached for 21 years. I've been a head 
coach for eight years. Yes, (I was a head coach) on the high school level. But 
I think coaching is teaching. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter if you're at Rich East High School (in Park Forest, Ill., 
where he started), or coaching in a CYO rec league, where my 10-year-old plays, 
or coaching at the University of Michigan." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Michigan Athletic Director Bo Schembechler placed Fisher in a difficult 
position last week when he named him interim coach, decreeing that Frieder 
would not be allowed to coach the Wolverines in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher, 43, had been an assistant for 10 years, including the last seven at 
Michigan, where he served as Frieder's right-hand man. 
</P>
<P>
But Schembechler said: "I don't want someone from Arizona State coaching the 
Michigan team. A Michigan man is going to coach Michigan." 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, with Schembechler, Frieder and another former Michigan coach, 
Johnny Orr, watching from the stands, the Wolverines overcame a six-point 
deficit in the last 10 minutes of a 92-87 victory over Xavier. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, they defeated South Alabama, 91-82. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines, who lost to North Carolina in a regional semifinal last season, 
have advanced as far in the tournament as Frieder ever took them. 
</P>
<P>
The former coach, in fact, does not seem to be missed. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday at the Omni in Atlanta, a fan held up a sign that read: "Michigan 
Without Frieder Equals Final Four." 
</P>
<P>
And, when asked to compare the two, Michigan center Loy Vaught described Fisher 
as more level-headed than Frieder. 
</P>
<P>
Frieder, he said, was uptight. 
</P>
<P>
"He walked around, he paced the locker room," Vaught said of his former coach. 
"He was always thinking about ways to get an advantage. He seemed kind of 
frazzled at times. Coach Fisher, he's really laid-back. He's a lot calmer. A 
little bit cooler." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher won't go that far. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm firm, but hopefully fair," he said. "I think I'm demanding. But I 
also know that sometimes you've got to give a little extra rope to this guy or 
that guy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just like with your own kids: You've got to know when to push and when to 
pull, and when to pat and when to kick." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher seems to know. 
</P>
<P>
He said the transition between coaches has been smooth because Frieder 
entrusted him with a great deal of responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't like I was an assistant in name only and didn't do anything other 
than show up and shut up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He did more than keep track of the Wolverines' timeouts. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people don't realize that when Coach Frieder was our coach, Coach 
Fisher made a lot of the substitutions in games and called plays," Vaught said. 
"He's always had a load of responsibilities, so as far as we're concerned, he's 
the same guy. He's just got a new hat." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher planned and often ran practices. He also addressed the team before every 
game, standing in front of a chalk board and discussing individual matchups. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember (Missouri's) Rich Daly said that he had not conducted a practice in 
eight years," Fisher said. "I have conducted practices with regularity for the 
last seven or eight years." 
</P>
<P>
If he has left his mark on the Wolverines, Fisher said, he has left it not just 
in the last week, but over a period of time. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of the way we've played and I feel like I've contributed to some of 
the success," he said. "But I felt that same way as an assistant. I was in 
Frieder's ear all the time, making suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, instead of suggesting, I'm making decisions. That, to me, has been the 
only difference." 
</P>
<P>
On the court, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't ready for the constant demands on his time, or the stress. His 
appetite has waned. Usually a sound sleeper, Fisher has tossed and turned. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a little difficult," he said Wednesday at a news conference. "Doing 
these kinds of things are what's new for me." 
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, he said, several secretaries in the Michigan athletic department 
kidded him about his television appearances last weekend and advised him on 
what to wear and how to better present himself in front of a camera. 
</P>
<P>
That was new to him, too. 
</P>
<P>
It's not easy going from unknown to well known. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, though, everything has gone well. His players' kind words, 
he said, are a product of the team's success. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to say when you win," Fisher said. "We've all creatures of habit. 
When you win, you have good, positive feelings." 
</P>
<P>
Michigan is running the same offense and the same defense it ran under Frieder, 
he said. Also unchanged is the substitution pattern. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Fisher must be doing something right. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm preparing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, he has prepared for this day for 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
A reserve guard on an Illinois State team that reached the Division II Final 
Four in 1967 -- "I was the guy who jumped up and cheered while the other guys 
played" -- Fisher started his coaching career as an assistant at Rich East High 
School, in a suburb south of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
His first two years at Rich East, he worked for Les Wothke, who now coaches at 
Army. Fisher then worked for a year under Gene Smithson, who coaches at Wichita 
State, before being promoted to head coach in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
In eight seasons at Rich East, Fisher's teams compiled a 141-70 record and won 
four conference championships. Among his best players was Craig Hodges, who now 
plays for the Chicago Bulls and remains a friend. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hodges, the easygoing Fisher was more of a disciplinarian in those 
days, but he has since lightened up. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're an assistant coach, you have to be more mellow because you deal 
with the players on a more friend-like basis instead of being the one who has 
to set the rules," Hodges said. "That helped him." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher said he would have been content to spend the rest of his career at the 
high school level, but Wothke lured him away from Rich East in 1979, hiring his 
former assistant to assist him at Western Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Frieder hired him at Michigan three years later. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very knowledgeable basketball man," Frieder said. "He's meticulous and 
a stickler for detail. He's very organized." 
</P>
<P>
Rarely, though, was Fisher ever mentioned as a candidate for a head coaching 
vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
That may soon change. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler has said that he will consult his friend, Indiana Coach Bob 
Knight, and will conduct a national search for a new coach. 
</P>
<P>
But Frieder said: "I will be very disappointed if Steve doesn't get the job. 
I'm disappointed already that it hasn't been announced." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher will be disappointed, too, if somebody doesn't offer him a job. His alma 
mater, Illinois State, has an opening. It did not renew the contract of Bob 
Donewald, who was released after 11 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher, though, would prefer to remain at Ann Arbor. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping and praying I'm the head coach at Michigan," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, he hasn't done anything to hurt his chances. 
</P>
<P>
He is 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
"The best darn winning percentage in the nation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Southeast Regional Notes 
</P>
<P>
In the other semifinal tonight, top-seeded Oklahoma (30-5) will meet Virginia 
(21-10), which has lost only to Duke in its last seven games. . . . Oklahoma 
beat Virginia last season in Hawaii, 109-61, as guard Mookie Blaylock scored 33 
points and center Stacey King scored 32.. . . In victories last weekend over 
Providence and Middle Tennessee State, Virginia's Richard Morgan scored 66 
points, making seven of 11 shots from three-point range, and his running mate 
in the backcourt, sophomore John Crotty, scored 49 points, had 24 assists and 
shot 82.6%, including six of seven three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina has reached the regional semifinals in nine straight seasons, 
but has not advanced to the Final Four since 1982, when it won its only NCAA 
championship in 27 seasons under Coach Dean Smith. . . . North Carolina has 
eliminated Michigan from the tournament each of the last two seasons, beating 
the Wolverines in a regional semifinal last season and in a second-round game 
two years ago. . . . North Carolina's J.R. Reid didn't have much to say about 
missing curfew and being suspended for Sunday's 88-81 victory over UCLA. "I 
missed not playing," said Reid, who is expected to play tonight.

Top-ranked Ivan Lendl lost his concentration but still won his second-round 
match in straight sets Wednesday at the International Players Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl said his mind wandered as he swept Jim Pugh, 6-3, 6-1, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
"That was my biggest problem -- concentration," Lendl said. "I was letting it

SEATTLE SEAHAWKS CATCH RAMS' JOHNNIE JOHNSON IN FREE AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The winds of change, blowing briskly through Anaheim these days, swept out 
another Ram Wednesday when veteran free safety Johnnie Johnson announced that 
he was taking the money and running his 32-year-old body to the Seattle 
Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a nine-year veteran and a mainstay of the Ram secondary for nearly a 
decade, has agreed to terms with the Seahawks on a two-year contract. Johnson 
was one of 19 Ram players left unprotected last month when the National 
Football League loosened its chokehold on the terms of "free agency." Johnson, 
thus, was free to negotiate with any team and was not subject to compensation. 
Terms of his deal were not immediately known, though he will reportedly earn at 
least double his annual Ram salary of $200,000, which Johnson was to receive 
this year and next. His total package, including reachable incentives, could be 
worth in excess of $500,000 a season. 
</P>
<P>
It was an offer Johnson couldn't refuse. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have been really disappointed if I would have played 10 or 12 years 
and never got the chance to at least test the free-agent market once," Johnson 
said. "I was lucky enough to come off a good enough year where there were teams 
that were interested in me." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it wasn't as easy as that. Johnson said he anguished over his 
decision to leave the Rams, mostly because his roots are firmly entrenched in 
Orange County, where Johnson has recently married and started his own real 
estate company. 
</P>
<P>
"I have strong feelings for the Ram organization," Johnson said. "I have strong 
feelings for (owner) Georgia (Frontiere). I feel I've got one of the better 
images of any athlete around here. I'd like to thank the fans and the coaching 
staff for being as great as they have to me in my nine years. But I'll be down 
here to play the Raiders." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams could have prevented Johnson's escape by including him among the 37 
players they were allowed to protect. They chose not to, gambling that 
Johnson's age and community ties would keep him in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see why they did it," Johnson said. "But it backfired. It didn't work 
out for them." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams didn't seem quite so stunned. 
</P>
<P>
"It was expected," Ram Coach John Robinson said from the NFL owners meeting at 
Palm Desert. "Johnnie was nearing the end of his career. This is a real 
opportunity for him. When players come to the end of their careers, sometimes a 
new environment is a catalyst for them. He's been a great Ram, and a great guy. 
It's probably in his best interests. We expected him to have offers. He's still 
got some quality years left in him." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams are presently in the roster-clearing business, having to make room for 
five more first- or second-round draft choices again this summer. As Johnson 
moves out, James Washington, 24, and Michael Stewart, 23, form the line that 
leads to his vacated job. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Johnson started all 16 games at free safety for the Rams last season and 
even played cornerback in a pinch. He led the team with four interceptions and 
was the team's third-leading tackler with 47. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he gravitated to the Seahawks. The first attraction was Chuck 
Knox, the former Ram coach, who holds nothing against players born in the 
1950s. 
</P>
<P>
"Knox loves veterans, and I can still run," Johnson said. "That had the biggest 
impact on them." 
</P>
<P>
The second incentive was the Seahawks' recent hiring of former Raider coach Tom 
Flores to run the team's football operations. And the clincher? Seattle's 
defensive backs coach is none other than Rod Perry, the former Ram cornerback 
and Johnson's close friend. 
</P>
<P>
"If somebody gave me deck of cards, I couldn't have picked a better hand," 
Johnson said. "And I'm confident they're only a couple of players away (from 
the Super Bowl)." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson created quite a stir in 1980 when the Rams made the University of Texas 
star the 15th pick in the NFL draft. His six-year, million-dollar contract 
prompted the famous training-camp holdouts of angered veterans Jack and Jim 
Youngblood, Larry Brooks and Dennis Harrah. Johnson, though, soon proved his 
worth and became one of the team's most consistent players of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson played strong safety until Robinson arrived in 1983 and switched him to 
free safety. 
</P>
<P>
"I owe quite a few things to Coach Robinson," Johnson said. "He allowed me to 
become the player I am. He made the move from strong to free; it was the best 
move anyone could have made for me. And he did not hesitate to move me to 
corner, which allowed people to see what I could do." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson had perhaps his best season in 1983, when he made some All-Pro teams. 
He leaves the Rams with 21 career interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be weird, not being a Ram," Johnson said. "But that's something I'll get 
used to. I played here nine years. But this is an excellent opportunity for me. 
They expect big things out of me." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Johnnie Johnson becomes the seventh unprotected Ram to sign with another NFL 
team, upstaging reserve cornerback Mickey Sutton, who said Wednesday that he 
has agreed to a two-year deal with the Green Bay Packers. Sutton, who earned 
$115,000 last season, said he will more than double his salary with the 
Packers. Sutton will also be asked to return punts. But what about that 
weather, Mick? "The snow doesn't bother me," he said. "I'll still keep my place 
in Irvine. I couldn't let weather hinder my decision." If you've lost track, 
other Rams lost to free agency were receiver Michael Young (Denver); defensive 
linemen Gary Jeter (New England), Greg Meisner (Kansas City) and Fred Stokes 
(Washington); tight end Jon Embree (Seattle), and running back Keith Jones 
(Cleveland). That leaves 11 unprotected Rams with seven shopping days left in 
free agency. All deals must be completed by April 1. The remaining free agents 
are linebackers Jim Collins, Carl Ekern and Mark Jerue, quarterback Mark 
Herrmann, running backs Charles White, Tim Tyrrell, Buford McGee and Mike 
Guman, tackle Mike Schad, tight end Eric Sievers and snapper Mike McDonald.

WHATLEY GIVES CLIPPERS LIFT IN WIN OVER DALLAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ennis Whatley, who was averaging about 45 minutes a game for Wichita Falls, 
Tex., when the Clippers plucked him from the Continental Basketball Assn. on a 
10-day contract, was not tired. Just surprised. 
</P>
<P>
"Very surprised," said Whately, who was brought in to help at the guard 
position. "Thankful, though." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers are, too, after Whatley came off the bench to play the final 17:33 
of the game and contribute eight points -- including two free throws to tie the 
score at 108-108 -- and four assists in a 116-112 victory over the Dallas 
Mavericks Wednesday night before 9,721 fans at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Norman scored six of the final eight points for the Clippers, who have won 
three of their last five games. The two losses were by six and three points, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The addition of Whatley, who is with his sixth National Basketball Assn. team 
in a five-year pro career, has already brought a new element to an act that was 
getting older by the game. History says he can't sustain it, but the Clippers 
have already squeezed something from him, even after only two days of practice. 
</P>
<P>
"He adds juice that we need," Coach Don Casey said. "He's a little hungry kid 
coming in. You've got to be happy for him, and it's a little zip into our 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe he doesn't know all the plays, but he did well. He and Gary (Grant, the 
starter at point guard) will be a good complement, and I think Tommy Garrick 
looks better at shooting guard. So now we have a good rotation." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers also have good feelings again after breaking a two-game losing 
streak, and winning for only the fourth time in 47 outings when behind after 
three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers (14-51) had four players each score 20 points or more -- Benoit 
Benjamin (23, and 12 rebounds), Norman (21) and Charles Smith and Quintin 
Dailey (20 each). They shot 55.7%, the team's best percentage since a Dec. 8 
victory over Houston at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Things have been going the Clippers' way on the schedule, if nowhere else. 
After playing -- and losing to -- the expansion teams last week, Dallas came to 
town with a seven-game losing streak, which included a 14-point quarter in each 
of the last two games. 
</P>
<P>
The Mavericks, who averaged 93.5 points during the streak, looked the part at 
the outset, falling behind, 49-40, with 6:30 to play in the first half. But 
against a team it had beaten 13 straight times coming in, Dallas closed the gap 
at 55-55. 
</P>
<P>
The Mavericks took the lead on their next possession, which ended in a Derek 
Harper layup with 2:34 left in the second quarter. Harper, who shot 38.5% in 
the first four games of the trip, made two more baskets, one a three-pointer, 
to help put Dallas ahead, 64-60, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Teammates have been giving Clipper forward Rob Lock, a 1988 Kentucky graduate, 
a bad time about his ties to the Wildcats, a program being investigated by the 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. "They ask me what I signed for to go to 
college. They ask me if I had to take a pay cut to play in the pros," Lock 
said. "To tell you the truth, at first it was funny. But now, it's to the point 
where it is embarrassing. We go on the road, and I hear it from fans, too. We 
were introduced before the game in Detroit, and the announcer said, 'Rob Lock, 
a rookie from Kentucky,' it was like the crowd went, 'Ooooooh." Lock said he 
spoke to NCAA investigators twice during his sophomore year, after a newspaper 
series showed widespread corruption in the program, but when they wanted to 
talk to him last April he declined. "I was through with my college career, so 
they couldn't make me," he said. "I would just have told them I never got 
anything to play there, which is the truth. I wasn't good enough in high school 
to get any offers."

CAVALIERS GAIN A FIRST, THEN FALL INTO SECOND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was of little solace to the Cleveland Cavaliers that they became the first 
team in the National Basketball Assn. to clinch a playoff position Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers qualified for postseason action when Indiana knocked off 
Washington, but when the rejuvenated Philadelphia 76ers held off a late surge 
to earn a 100-97 victory at Philadelphia, it sent the Cavaliers reeling into 
second place in the Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
Buoyed shortly before the game by reports that center Mike Gminski had agreed 
to a contract that would keep him in Philadelphia for four more seasons, the 
76ers snapped out of a mild slump. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Barkley scored 27 points and had 21 rebounds to lead the 76ers, but it 
was two free throws by Gminski with eight seconds left that clinched the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers, trailing by 17 points in the second quarter, made a spirited 
rally, and baskets by Brad Daugherty and Mark Price cut the deficit to 98-97 
with nearly two minutes left. The only points the rest of the way were 
Gminski's. Craig Ehlo missed a three-point shot in an effort to tie, and 
Barkley pulled down the rebound at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the 6-foot 11-inch Gminski, who is 
eligible for unrestricted free agency at the end of the season, has agreed to 
terms. The paper said the announcement would be made next week. 
</P>
<P>
Gminski figured to get numerous offers, including one from the Lakers, if he 
decided to become a free agent. Good centers are hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
The 76ers had lost two games in a row, and Barkley had played without spirit in 
recent games. Moreover, the 76ers' once-comfortable margin over the Boston 
Celtics in the battle for the seventh playoff spot in the East was down to two 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night, Barkley controlled the boards at both ends, enabling the 76ers 
to win despite shooting only 43.4%. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers shot 55.2% but they were badly beaten on the boards and had 32 
fewer shots than the 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
"We had not been rebounding well," Barkley said, "ands I decided it was up to 
me to take charge. I finally got my share." 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers are 48-18 but trail Detroit, which is 47-17, by .007. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 112, Phoenix 111 -- The move of scoring champion Michael Jordan to 
point guard appears to be paying off for the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
With Jordan leading the way, the Bulls followed the stunning win over the 
Lakers at the Forum Tuesday night with another victory at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan scored 18 of his 32 points in the second half as the Bulls, who led most 
of the way, barely held on. 
</P>
<P>
The win gave the Bulls a 39-26 record and sole possession of fourth place in 
the tough Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat ended the Suns' five-game winning streak and dropped them 3 1/2 
games behind the Lakers in the Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
Miami 107, New York 103 -- The Knicks' slim hopes of finishing with the best 
overall record became slimmer when they couldn't beat the Heat at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Edwards scored 26 points to lead the expansion team to its 11th victory 
in 66 games. The Heat made its last 19 free throws to prevail in a tight 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
Miami led, 97-93, when Patrick Ewing scored five points in a matter of seconds 
to put New York ahead. Ewing sank a turnaround jumper, then stole the inbounds 
pass and converted it into a three-point play. He gave the Knicks a 98-97 lead 
with 2:14 left. 
</P>
<P>
But Edwards hit a jumper, and Scott Hastings extended the lead to three with 
another jumper. The Knicks never caught up. 
</P>
<P>
The Heat shot only 41.1% from the field, but the Knicks weren't much better at 
42.4%. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 115, San Antonio 94 -- The Pistons, after a tough game Tuesday night at 
Atlanta, were slow to begin at San Antonio. But Joe Dumars scored six of his 20 
points in a 17-3 second-quarter spurt that broke the game open, and the Pistons 
breezed into first place in the Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
The win put the Pistons 30 games above .500 (47-17) for the first time in 
franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Laimbeer had 21 points and 10 rebounds for Detroit, while Frank Brickowski 
had 20 points for San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana 101, Washington 92 -- Detlef Schrempf came off the bench at 
Indianapolis to score 22 points, and the Pacers dealt a severe blow to the 
Bullets' playoff hopes. 
</P>
<P>
The Bullets, still without Jeff Malone, their injured leading scorer, fell 
three games behind Boston in the fight for the final playoff spot in the East.

SOCKERS LOSE SEGOTA TO INJURY, THEN GAME BY A GOAL TO WINGS

<P>
The Sockers' offense, or at least a very big part of it, will be taking a 
10-day leave of absence. 
</P>
<P>
Branko Segota strained his right hamstring in the second quarter of Wednesday 
night's game against Wichita in front of 11,410 at the Sports Arena. Then 
things got very strange. 
</P>
<P>
The final score: Wichita 5, Sockers 4. It wasn't as simple as it sounds. 
</P>
<P>
First, there's Segota, who has been hot lately. He has six goals and seven 
assists in the past three games. His services were sorely missed and will be 
when the Sockers leave this morning for a two-game trip to Dallas and 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
"That hurts," Newman said. "If we'd have had Branko there (the game) would have 
been different. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers (21-18) were trailing, 2-1, early in the fourth quarter but finally 
took a 4-2 lead on goals by Alan Willey, Kevin Crow and Paul Wright. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, Socker Coach Ron Newman liked what he saw. He said after the game 
his team had played one of its best games of the year. But the Sockers 
slumbered through the final six minutes. First, Daryl Green scored. Then Chico 
Borja scored. After that, Borja scored again. All within 1:38. Borja's second 
goal ended the scoring with 4:21 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a crazy game," Newman said. "Terrible defensive work on our part. We're 
not working as a unit." 
</P>
<P>
Ask Crow -- he'll say the Sockers were too tired in the fourth quarter to work 
together and effectively stop the Wings' assault. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't think we're as physically fit as other teams," Crow said. "When 
we play a high-pressure game, we can't last for four quarters. I bet we've lost 
13 (of 18 losses) in the last three or four minutes of the game or in 
overtime." 
</P>
<P>
The return of Brian Quinn, who has been sidelined with a strained arch, helped. 
But Quinn, whose wife, Sharon, gave birth to a girl Tuesday, was only able to 
play in spurts after being out since Feb. 3. 
</P>
<P>
So now the Sockers take to the road five games behind first-place Baltimore and 
wondering what's ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had won that game, the road trip would have been that much easier," 
Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
The score at halftime was 0-0. The Sockers haven't been held scoreless in the 
first half for 12 games. Last time the Sockers played Wichita (17-22) at the 
Sports Arena, they won, 10-6. 
</P>
<P>
Players from both teams did their share of running in the first half, but 
scoring opportunities were scarce. Credit each team with one legitimate almost. 
Wichita's came midway through the second quarter when midfielder Mike Fox 
launched a shot from beyond the penalty arch that required Socker goalie Victor 
Nogueira to dive to his left and knock the ball away with one hand. 
</P>
<P>
Socker defender Ralf Wilhelms nearly scored on a bicycle kick four minutes 
later, but goalie Cris Vaccaro knocked it down, and an attempt by Crow to head 
it in was unsuccessful.

NCAA WOMEN'S TOURNAMENT;

<P>
OHIO STATE TAKES ON CS LONG BEACH AGAIN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The staff and players of Ohio State's women's basketball team remember the 
first -- and last -- time they played Cal State Long Beach. It was a game they 
would just as soon forget. 
</P>
<P>
It was two years ago at Pauley Pavilion, in the final of the West Regional of 
the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. women's tournament. The 49ers won, 
102-82, and went to the Final Four. The Buckeyes went home. 
</P>
<P>
Fate and the NCAA selection committee have thrown the teams together here, in 
the East Regional of the postseason tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach, the region's No. 2- seeded team, will play No. 3-seeded Ohio State 
today at 4 p.m., PST, in Western Kentucky University's E.A. Diddle Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Tennessee will meet Virginia in the second game. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State Coach Nancy Darsch was in her second season at the school when the 
Buckeyes were blown out by the 49ers. Asked what she remembered from that game, 
Darsch scrunched her face as if recalling a particularly bad dream. 
</P>
<P>
"Long Beach is a team of transition and a team of spurts. It seemed like every 
time I looked at the scoreboard, they were stretching the lead from 10 to 20. 
This time around, I hope we are a little more experienced and a little more 
mature." 
</P>
<P>
Four of Ohio State's five starters played in that game. The two best players 
from that team remain -- 6-foot forward Nikita Lowry and 5-11 guard Lisa Cline. 
Lowry is averaging 18.5 points per game, and Cline leads the team with a 19.7 
average. "We remember the game," Lowry said. "We all expect Long Beach to run 
the fast break, just like they did two years ago. We can run if we have to, and 
we can play halfcourt if we have to." 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State players and Darsch naturally allude to the Long Beach fast break, 
run by the backcourt of Penny Toler and Traci Waites. The seventh-ranked 49ers 
are the nation's highest-scoring team at 89.6 points per game. Few teams have 
been able to upset Long Beach's tempo. "We just want to control the tempo of 
the game," Darsch said. "We are just going to have to dig in." 
</P>
<P>
While other teams key on Toler and Waites, Long Beach Coach Joan Bonvicini 
continues to point out her team's balance. In fact, it has been the emergence 
of the 49er front line that has helped build the team's 22-game win streak. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach is 29-4, and the 14th-ranked Buckeyes are 24-5. 
</P>
<P>
"People talk about our offense," Bonvicini said, "but it's our defense that 
sets the tempo." 
</P>
<P>
Waites says the team is ready, which for the 49ers means loose, confident 
players. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to stay relaxed," Waites said. "We don't want to treat this like a 
business. We're not overconfident. We're not looking past Ohio State. We just 
want to go out and play like Long Beach. We want to win." 
</P>
<P>
Toler put it this way: "Before, we would come to play. Here, we have come to 
win." 
</P>
<P>
No doubt Ohio State has made similar plans. 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach senior Cheryl Dowell, who is from Evansville, Ind., said Wednesday 
that she expects more than 50 family members and friends to make the two-hour 
drive to the game. Many have never seen her play college ball. "I'll think 
about it, but I'll try not to let it bother me," Dowell said. . . . Western 
Kentucky was also expected to play in this regional. School officials said the 
absence of the Hilltoppers may lead to a small turnout. Estimates Wednesday for 
the semifinals began at 1,500 for the 12,370-seat arena. . . . The semifinal 
winners will meet Saturday, with the winner of that game advancing to the the 
Final Four, March 31-April 2, at Tacoma, Wash.

Notre Dame tailback Tony Brooks, who faces two misdemeanor charges in a 
hit-and-run accident last month and was suspended from spring practice, has 
withdrawn from the university, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks, 19, left voluntarily for personal reasons and returned home to Tulsa, 
Okla., athletic department spokesman John Heisler said. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Lou Holtz said Brooks' future at Notre Dame is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks was charged Feb. 26 with leaving the scene of an accident and driving 
with a suspended driver's license. He had already been prohibited from 
extra-curricular activities, including spring practice, for an undisclosed 
infraction of university rules. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that he was looking at certain options and felt this was the best thing 
for him right now," Holtz said. "It wasn't a situation where he came to me for 
advice."

NEWSWIRE: WASHINGTON BASKETBALL COACH QUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andy Russo, presumably under fire after two consecutive losing seasons, 
resigned as the University of Washington's basketball coach Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Russo was not at a news conference called by Athletic Director Mike Lude to 
announce the resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Russo, 40, came to Washington after coaching Louisiana Tech to a 29-3 record in 
1984-85. He had a 61-62 record in four seasons at Washington, but the Huskies 
were 12-16 this season after going 10-19 in 1987-88. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies lost to Arizona, 116-61, and Arizona State, 121-90, on the road in 
December and never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Relations between Russo and his players reportedly soured. However, in 
Washington's final home game three weeks ago, the players wore T-shirts that 
read, "We believe in our coaches." 
</P>
<P>
Russo had two years left on his contract, worth $77,160 a year. 
</P>
<P>
St. Mary's Coach Lynn Nance, who played for Washington in the 1960s, is 
reportedly a leading candidate for the job. Other names mentioned as possible 
candidates included Loyola Marymount's Paul Westhead, UC Santa Barbara's Jerry 
Pimm and Evansville's Jim Crews.

FORFEIT LIKELY TO STAND DESPITE RESEDA'S PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coach Mike Stone's failure to lodge a protest at the appropriate time 
apparently has doomed Reseda High's chances of reversing the forfeiture of a 
baseball game at Monroe on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Stone filed a protest with the City Section on Wednesday, the morning after the 
Mid-Valley League game that was called in the top of the eighth inning with the 
score tied, 6-6. Umpire Ted Comerford ordered the game forfeited to Monroe when 
he ruled that Reseda pitcher Tony Valdez faked an injury in order to force a 
pitching change. 
</P>
<P>
Stone admits that he ordered Valdez to fake the injury after he threw one 
warm-up pitch in the eighth inning. Comerford, a 23-year-old Cal State 
Northridge student who has officiated for six years, admitted Wednesday that he 
was wrong when he refused to allow the change. Valdez already had pitched 1 2/3 
innings and could be removed at any time. 
</P>
<P>
However, Comerford called the forfeit for what he called Reseda's willful 
violation of the rules. 
</P>
<P>
"They were making a mockery of baseball," he said. "To see a coach do that, to 
see him set that kind of example for a team, it broke my heart." 
</P>
<P>
Because the forfeit was based on an umpire's judgment, a protest has little 
chance of succeeding, according to City Section Commissioner Hal Harkness, who 
added that Reseda's case would have been strengthened had Stone protested when 
he was forbidden to change pitchers. The protest will be officially reviewed at 
next month's meeting of the Interscholastic Athletic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd do the same thing tomorrow," Stone said in defense of his actions on 
Tuesday. He may get his chance. The teams play again today at 3 p.m. at Reseda.

TACKETT LIFTS CAMARILLO TO VICTORY, 2-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It seems that for Westlake High Coach Rich Herrera, the baseball world is 
indeed a small one. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera, a first-year coach at Westlake, saw two former players from his 
American Legion District 16 championship team lead Camarillo past Westlake, 
2-1, Wednesday in the consolation championship game of the Thousand Oaks 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Tackett, a junior right-hander who pitched for Herrera's Camarillo legion 
team last summer, threw a five-hitter and also drove in the winning run in the 
seventh inning when he singled in ex-Legion teammate Steve Biggs. 
</P>
<P>
Junior infielder Mike Lieberthal accounted for Westlake's (5-6) only run when 
he hit a solo home run in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
In other games: 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley 7, El Camino 3 -- Andy Hodgins and Chadd Johnson each had two hits 
to lead Simi Valley in a semifinal game of the Serra tournament in San Mateo. 
Hodgins had two runs batted in to give him 12 in three tournament games. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Hill relieved Simi Valley starter Kenny Hood (2-1) with two out and the 
bases loaded in the sixth, got the first batter he faced to ground out and went 
on to earn a save. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley (11-1) plays St. Francis of San Francisco for the championship 
today at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Chaminade 8, St. Bonaventure 1 -- Sophomore Greg Galloway pitched his second 
complete game and picked up his first win in the nonleague game at St. 
Bonaventure. 
</P>
<P>
The left-handed Galloway (1-1) scattered seven hits, struck out eight and 
walked two. He gave up an unearned run in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Chaminade (2-6) broke the game open with a five-run fourth, the key hits being 
Tony Collatos' two-run single and Pete Miller's RBI single. 
</P>
<P>
Collatos was one for three with three RBIs, Aaron Weis was one for two with two 
RBIs and Colin Havert was one for four with two RBIs as the Eagles won their 
second consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
St. Francis 15, St. Genevieve 1 -- Right-hander Mitch Bowen had a no-hitter 
through five innings and finished with a four-hitter in a nonleague game at St. 
Francis. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Loretta's three-run home run in the first inning sparked a nine-run 
outburst for the Golden Knights (3-4-1). 
</P>
<P>
St. Genevieve managed only a ground single to lead off the sixth and three 
singles in the seventh off Bowen (1-0), who walked three and struck out three. 
</P>
<P>
Crescenta Valley 6, Kingman (Ariz.) 4 -- Eric Berger had three RBIs and Shane 
Cowsill went two for three for the Falcons in a fourth-round game of the 
Eldorado tournament in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Cowsill started the fifth inning with a double and Mike Starkey walked. Both 
advanced on Scott Gleason's sacrifice bunt and scored on a single by Eric 
Berger to turn a 2-0 Crescenta Valley lead into a 4-0 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Kingman cut the Falcons' lead to 4-2 in the bottom of the fifth, but Crescenta 
Valley scored twice in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
De La Salle 7, Agoura 6 -- Alex Vasquez hit a two-run home run in the bottom of 
the eighth to give De La Salle of Concord a victory in the third-place game of 
the Thousand Oaks tournament. 
</P>
<P>
With two out, Steve Wilkalis walked and Vasquez teed off on Zac Miller's 
two-and-two pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura claimed the lead, 6-5, in the eighth when Brian Smith hit a home run. 
Nelson Townes was two for four with three stolen bases and two runs scored for 
the Chargers.

THE COLLEGES; 
</P>
<P>
A GAME BETWEEN ARIZONA, INDIANA WOULD HAVE DISTINCT VALLEY FLAVOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Should an Arizona-Indiana match-up materialize in the NCAA West regional 
championship basketball game Saturday, there is a good chance a former 
Valley-area high school standout will play a major role in the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
For top-ranked Arizona, there is center Anthony Cook and guard Harvey Mason. 
For the eighth-ranked Hoosiers, there is guard Joe Hillman and forward Mark 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Cook, a senior from Van Nuys, and Hillman, a senior from Hoover, are starters. 
Mason, a junior from Crescenta Valley, and Robinson, a junior from Simi Valley, 
come off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona (29-3) and Indiana (27-7) must both win tonight to advance to the 
regional final. Indiana will meet Seton Hall in a game that will be televised 
by CBS at 5 p.m. Arizona and Nevada Las Vegas will play immediately afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Cook leads the Wildcats in rebounding with a 7.3 average. He is second on the 
team in scoring with a 17.7 average, behind only All-American forward Sean 
Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
Mason, a Southern Section scoring champion with a 28.5 average in 1986, plays 
about 10 minutes a game as the fourth guard in a four-guard rotation. He is 
averaging 4.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
For Indiana, Hillman, a two-year starter, is averaging 12.7 points, 3.9 assists 
and 3.5 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson has played in 28 of the Hoosiers' 34 games, averaging 3.8 points and 
2.6 rebounds. In two tournament games he has scored seven points and grabbed 
seven rebounds in 32 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Two-timing: A new NCAA rule that trimmed from 26 to 24 the allowable number of 
days on which tennis matches may be played and also eliminated eight scrimmage 
days prompted Occidental Coach Brian Newhall to schedule three double-match 
days. 
</P>
<P>
A double-match day is similar to a doubleheader in baseball with one major 
difference: It entails playing a morning match against one school and an 
afternoon match against another. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the format has worked well. All 14 members of the Occidental team have 
been able to play and the team has scheduled mostly weekend matches to avoid 
academic conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
Sizzling Sisco: Steve Sisco, who plays second base for Moorpark College, 
abandoned any hope of being a power hitter after his first sample of college 
pitching. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a line-drive hitter now," said Sisco, a former Thousand Oaks High 
standout. "The college pitching put an end to my power." 
</P>
<P>
Sisco, whose nine home runs was second best among high school players in 
Ventura County last season, has not been stifled by college pitching, however. 
He is batting .444 in Western State Conference play and has a 20-game hitting 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Sisco collected five hits, scored four runs and knocked in two as 
Moorpark defeated Valley College, 16-11. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of threes: Darin Furlong already has set a Moorpark single-season 
record with six triples. His most recent came against Valley on Saturday and 
broke Dave Patterson's record of five set in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Dandy De: De Dow is on the same pace that earned her WSC Pitcher of the Year 
honors at Moorpark last season. 
</P>
<P>
The sophomore right-hander is 10-3 and leads the team in complete games (12). 
She also has seven shutouts and an 0.65 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
Class act: It may have been the only time Bill Kernen instructed one of his 
baseball players not to go to class. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of last summer, Craig Clayton was preparing for a good night's sleep 
before starting school the next day at Cypress College when he received a call 
from Kernen who was recruiting players for his first season as coach at Cal 
State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
"I had seen Craig at a tryout for an Orange County all-star team, but he was 
playing third base and I already had recruited a third baseman," Kernen said. 
"But then I went to watch a Palomino tournament up north and he played the 
outfield and pitched. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got back, I called him and asked him to put off going to class for a 
day so he could come look at the campus." 
</P>
<P>
Clayton arranged for his teachers at Cypress to hold his place in classes. 
There was no need. He ended up enrolling at Northridge and has become the 
Matadors leading hitter with a .347 average. 
</P>
<P>
He also has two home runs and 12 runs batted in.

The curveball was giving Patrick Henry High School catcher Mike Coleman fits. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just had a lot of trouble hitting left-handers' curveballs," Coleman said 
after Wednesday's 15-3 victory over Monte Vista, which put the Patriots into 
the AAA Division semifinals of the 39th Mike Morrow/Lions tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman's problem is now in the past tense. He pulled two home runs over the 
right-field fence against two left-handers Wednesday at Monte Vista. 
</P>
<P>
And both times, he picked on a curveball. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman's first home run came in the second on a 1-0 pitch. It was the second 
consecutive curve Jason Beckstrand had tried to sneak by him. 
</P>
<P>
"I recognized the spin on the second pitch," Coleman said. "I didn't think he'd 
throw me another curve." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman waited on it and drove the ball high onto the bank beyond the 
right-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth, Coleman hit a two-run homer off Jack Rickey. 
</P>
<P>
"I was guessing curveball all the way there," Coleman said. "And once I 
recognized the spin, I just waited on it and . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Coleman didn't need to finish the sentence. The ball ended up near where the 
first one had landed, some 25 feet up the embankment. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Henry also got home runs from Brian Simmons in the second and Shannon 
Webb, to the opposite field, in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew this team could hit," Coach Bob Imlay said. "I knew we could swing the 
bat, but I thought my pitching would be a lot better. We're throwing a lot of 
balls." 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Henry pitchers issued seven walk. Two of Monte Vista's runs were scored 
by runners who reached base on walks. 
</P>
<P>
But the Patriots' pitching has been good enough to get them into today's 10:30 
a.m. semifinal game against San Dieguito, which will match hot hitting against 
a well-rested pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs will go with Erik Luna, who is 3-0 and has not pitched since 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be a good test for us," said Imlay, whose team had lost five in a row 
coming into the tournament. JOHN GEIS In other Lions tournament AAA Division 
games: Southwest 8, San Dieguito 7 -- San Dieguito, which clinched a semifinal 
spot Tuesday, scored five runs in the top of the seventh, but Southwest came 
back with four in the bottom of the inning. Tony DelaTorre had the game-winning 
RBI. Bryan Thistle and Nat Fleck each had two hits (including one homer), two 
runs and two RBIs for the Mustangs. Orange Glen 9, Chula Vista 1 -- Scot Porter 
and Matt Taylor hit bases-empty home runs to help lift the Patriots (5-6). 
Point Loma 4, Mt. Miguel -- Point Loma scored three runs in the first inning to 
finish 2-1 and tied with Poway in pool play. The Pointers advanced because of a 
5-4 victory over Poway Tuesday. Poway 7, Montgomery 6 -- Poway scored in the 
bottom of the eighth. Bruce Matthes (2-0) was the winner. Granite Hills 4, 
Morse 3 -- Granite Hills finished pool play 3-0 and advanced to the semifinals 
against Point Loma. San Diego 10, Sweetwater 9 -- Claudio Moreno scored on an

Sweetwater. Mira Mesa 6, Santana 5 -- The Marauders scored on a throwing error 
in the bottom of the eighth. Lions AA Division Valhalla 10, San Marcos 4 -- 
Eight of the Norsemen's 10 runs were the result of home runs. Mark Iveson went 
three for three, including a grand slam in the sixth, and Dave Angotti was 
three for four with a three-run homer in the fourth. Iveson and Angotti knocked 
in seven of Valhalla's runs. Valhalla (6-4-1) went 3-0 in pool play and meets 
Castle Park today in the semifinals. Castle Park 9, Grossmont 5 -- At 
Grossmont, 11 of 14 runs were result of home runs; all of Grossmont's runs came 
on homers. For Castle Park, Joe Carrillo was two for four with four RBIs and 
two home runs. Grossmont's Todd Cady went two for four with three RBIs and two 
home runs. Juan Beltran (3-0) was the winner. Helix 10, Vista 9 -- Helix 
finished its pool play with 54 runs and three victories and will play Hilltop 
in the semifinals. Hilltop 11, El Cajon Valley 3 -- The Lancers scored 10 runs 
in the second. Hilltop's Paul Stojsavljevic went three for four with two RBIs, 
and Gus Chavarin was two for three with three RBIs, including a triple. Hilltop 
improved to 3-6 and advanced to the semifinals. San Pasqual 10, USDHS 9 -- Mike 
Escarcega had a nine-game hitting streak on the line and was zero for three 
when he came up with two outs and the bases loaded in the bottom of the 
seventh. Escarcega (23 for 34 on the year) lined a single to right, driving in 
Erin Sutton and Eric Marsh to finish San Pasqual's come-from-behind victory. 
USDHS (7-2) had scored four runs in the sixth to go ahead, 9-5. Escarcega (3-1) 
was also the winning pitcher. University City 9, Hoover 8 -- The Centurions 
scored in the top of the eighth to break an 8-8 tie. Jeff Sevier hit a leadoff 
single, reached second on a passed ball, advanced to third on a fielder's 
choice and was sacrificed home by Scott Clark. Brett Punches went three for 
four with a bases-empty home run for University City (2-8). Hoover dropped to 
5-5-1. Fallbrook 15, Serra 6 -- Nino Storniolo's grand slam in the seventh 
completed the Conquistadors' scoring, but Serra's six errors helped give 
Fallbrook (7-2) the edge at Grossmont. Serra fell to 4-6. Lions A Division St. 
Augustine 6, Coronado 2 -- Mike Mossuto hit a two-out two-run double in the top 
of the sixth to give St. Augustine (5-4) a 3-2 lead. After giving up a home run 
to Rich Bledsoe and two singles in the first inning, Mark Jackson (1-0) allowed 
Coronado just one hit the rest of the way. Juan Lopez had three hits, two runs 
and an RBI for the Saints, who advanced with a 3-0 pool record to the 
semifinals against Mission Bay. Mission Bay 4, Oceanside 0 -- Mo Aviles, Pat

two for three with an RBI as the Cougars improved to 6-3. El Camino 12, Julian 
5 -- Todd Swanson collected two triples and Ricky Spears hit a bases-empty home 
run for El Camino (3-6) at La Jolla. Swanson and Spears were four for five. 
Lincoln 11, Marian 8 -- Lonnie Field went three for three, and Ron Jones was 
three for four with three RBIs. Both players are batting over .600 for the 
tournament. For Marian, JamaarBrown hit a three-run homer in the seventh. Sun 
Devil tournament Las Vegas Valley 4, El Capitan 0 -- Las Vegas Valley was 
averaging 16.8 runs per game and had not been held under 11 runs all season. El

MADISON COMPLETES COMEBACK IN THE SEVENTH TO REPEAT AS ORANGE GLEN SOFTBALL 
CHAMPION

<P>
As if the mid-day sun wasn't enough, Ocean View High School's five 
second-inning runs really made Madison softball Coach Steve Miner sweat. 
</P>
<P>
Madison fell behind, 5-1, but began a comeback with two runs in the fifth and 
finished with four in the seventh to defeat Ocean View of Huntington Beach, 
7-5, in the championship game of the Tough Time division in the Coca-Cola 
Orange Glen Easter tournament at Kit Carson Park. 
</P>
<P>
"The comeback surprised me. It was a total team effort," said Miner, whose team 
is 7-2. "Most close games are lost (by mistakes), not won, especially in a 
fast-pitch high school softball." 
</P>
<P>
Kim Lester singled in a run to begin Madison's seventh-inning scoring. Jennifer 
Booker followed with another RBI single to tie it, and Jennifer Land then hit a 
two-run single to win the game for Madison. 
</P>
<P>
Booker (3-1) pitched seven innings except for the brief substitution of Natalie 
Hurlburt in the second. After Ocean View scored three runs, Miner replaced 
Booker with the intention of returning her to the game. Booker had allowed just 
two hits in the last two innings of Madison's 1-0 victory over Ocean View 
(8-7)in a tournament in Irvine last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted their team to see something different and let her calm down," Miner 
said. "She needed a break. The girls get rattled and start pressing themselves. 
This is the luxury of having two pitchers you can count on." 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View's momentum was slowed in the middle of its second-inning scoring 
blitz. The trouble began when Sharon Pouelsen, Ocean View's first batter of the 
inning, was replaced with a pinch-runner at second. When Pouelsen went to bat a 
second time in the inning, it was called to Miner's attention by Madison's 
scorekeeper that she had never officially re-entered the game. Neither Pouelsen 
nor the pinch-runner was allowed to return. 
</P>
<P>
Miner took advantage in the bottom of the seventh when, with one out and one 
on, he had Marla Pickard walked intentionally so Pouelsen's replacement, 
Jennifer Schneller, would hit. Schneller was tagged at first for the second 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Madison won last year's tournament with a veteran team that ended up 28-2. Six 
of this year's starters played on the junior varsity last season. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a credit to our younger girls coming through in a clutch situation," 
Miner said. "It's definitely a confidence builder. We're a good softball team 
but not a dominant team right now." 
</P>
<P>
Lester was three for four against Ocean View and batted .600 in the tournament. 
Hurlburt was four for four Wednesday and .438 for the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View had defeated El Capitan, 3-2, to earn the right to play Madison for 
the title. 
</P>
<P>
Monte Vista scored the game's only run in the seventh to defeat Marina for the 
varsity division championship. Mt. Miguel defeated Carlsbad, 7-2, in the 
consolation final.

GOP ELECTS GINGRICH AS HOUSE WHIP; 
</P>
<P>
CONFRONTATIONAL CONSERVATIVE WINS PARTY'S NO. 2 POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Frustrated by decades of Democratic domination, House Republicans on Wednesday 
elected confrontational conservative Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia to their 
second-ranking leadership post, over the opposition of House Republican leader 
Robert H. Michel of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
Backers of Gingrich said his 87-85 victory over the more traditional and less 
colorful Rep. Edward R. Madigan (R-Ill.) reflected a widespread demand for more 
aggressive tactics in dealing with the Democratic majority. 
</P>
<P>
An elated Gingrich said his strategy, in contrast with the current Republican 
approach, would be "closer to a UCLA full-court press." 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich's new title is minority whip, the post held by Rep. Dick Cheney of 
Wyoming until President Bush named him defense secretary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Seeking 'Nice Guys' 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich's backers rejected the view that the minority Republicans must 
cooperate with Democrats to influence legislation, as Madigan often did as a 
member of the Agriculture Committee. "Ed Madigan is a nice guy," said Rep. 
Chuck Douglas (R-N.H.). "And nice guys aren't what we were looking for." 
</P>
<P>
Michel, clearly downcast by the defeat of Madigan, said that he would "go with 
the flow" and make changes where necessary in the Republican high command. But 
he also noted that a minority party with 80 fewer votes than the Democrats must 
carefully select the issues where it can fight and have a chance to win. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic leaders were quietly jubilant at Gingrich's success. They view him 
as the Republican most likely to unify the often-splintered factions of their 
party if he continues his highly partisan attacks in his new position. 
</P>
<P>
It was Gingrich who filed the charges that have led to a House Ethics Committee 
investigation of the financial affairs of the House's leading Democrat, Speaker 
Jim Wright of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"We're obviously going to have a delicate and difficult relationship at best," 
Gingrich said of the Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
Wright extended congratulations and best wishes to Gingrich. Told that Gingrich 
had promised to treat him with courtesy, however, Wright laughed before saying: 
"I look forward to that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Foley Avoids Prejudging 
</P>
<P>
House Democratic Leader Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) said that he would not 
prejudge Gingrich, who has accused the Democrats of being run by a "corrupt, 
left-wing machine." 
</P>
<P>
But Rep. Tony Coelho (D-Merced), who ranks third in the Democratic leadership 
behind Wright and Foley, could hardly conceal his joy at Gingrich's selection, 
calling it "manna from heaven." He said Democrats could exploit Gingrich's 
ultraconservative positions on Social Security and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
Coelho, who as majority whip will be Gingrich's counterpart on the Democratic 
side, pointed out that Gingrich's job will be to count votes and build 
coalitions with members of the other party. "He can no longer bomb bridges, he 
has to build bridges," Coelho said. 
</P>
<P>
Even Rep. Lynn Martin (R-Ill.), who voted for Madigan out of home-state 
loyalty, said that Gingrich won because of his hard work, enthusiasm and 
ability to command media attention. "Of course, if you live by the press, you 
can die by the press," she noted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
O.C. Delegation Backed Winner 
</P>
<P>
All five Orange County congressmen backed Gingrich. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad) said he went into Wednesday's vote uncommitted 
but decided that Madigan is too similar to other House Republican leaders, whom 
he called "consensus builders." 
</P>
<P>
"We need someone who can go toe to toe with the Democrats and fight them in 
their own style," Packard said, explaining why he finally voted for Gingrich. 
"They've got their Newt Gingriches. . . . We've not had anyone who would take 
them on." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), who as chairman of the House 
Republican freshman caucus helped round up votes for Gingrich, said he was "as 
excited about today's vote as I was on the night of my own election." 
</P>
<P>
"Without a doubt, House Republicans will now be offering a legislative agenda 
of their own which will be forward looking and responsible and in favor of 
growth and jobs," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Are Dismayed 
</P>
<P>
Some Republicans were dismayed by the outcome. Rep. Silvio O. Conte (R-Mass.) 
said it is a "tragedy" to divide the minority party over the whip contest. 
Other GOP veterans complained that Gingrich was largely untested in legislative 
negotiations and the intricacies of counting how Republicans would vote on 
closely contested bills or amendments. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot to learn about the inside game," acknowledged Gingrich, a former 
history professor better known as a debater and gadfly than a craftsman 
familiar with the nitty-gritty details. 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich, seeking to reach out to moderates in his party, arranged for veteran 
Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota to nominate him for the whip's job, with 
seconding speeches by Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt of Arkansas, a friend of 
President Bush's, and the widely respected Rep. Olympia J. Snowe of Maine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'He'll Mature' 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.), a staunch conservative, predicted that Gingrich 
would do well in the whip's job. "He's smart enough to know we have to achieve, 
not just fight. You can say what you want about Newt, but he's smart. He'll 
mature to the job," Hyde said. 
</P>
<P>
After his election, which was greeted with whoops and hollers in the staid 
Republican Capitol Hill Club two blocks from the Capitol, Gingrich promised to 
be a team player. He said his victory was not a rejection of the way the more 
easy-going Michel has led. 
</P>
<P>
"If the question had been a test of Bob Michel's leadership, I wouldn't have 
got 40 votes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Madigan holds that Republicans will benefit not from confrontation, but from 
reapportionment of congressional districts after the 1990 census, picking 
better candidates and sound campaign financing.

ROSTON CONVICTED OF KILLING WIFE ON THEIR HONEYMOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scott Roston, a Santa Monica chiropractor who claimed that his bride was 
murdered by Israeli agents in a campaign of terror against him, was convicted 
Wednesday of strangling her himself and throwing her overboard on the last 
night of their honeymoon cruise. 
</P>
<P>
Roston, 36, sagged when a Los Angeles federal court jury found him guilty of 
second-degree murder on the high seas. His lawyer said he would challenge the 
authority of American officials to prosecute the killing, which occurred 
outside U.S. territorial waters. 
</P>
<P>
"He's disappointed," defense attorney David Kenner said after the verdict. 
"Scott feels that it's incomprehensible for anyone to believe that he would 
have killed his wife that he loved very dearly." 
</P>
<P>
But Assistant U.S. Atty. Kendra McNally described Roston as a man who made up 
elaborate stories to cover up the "violent and brutal killing" of the woman he 
professed to love. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scoffed at Claim 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors scoffed at Roston's claim that Israeli agents drugged him and then 
framed him for Karen Roston's Feb. 13, 1988, murder because of a book he wrote, 
"Nightmare in Israel," which alleged that he had been arrested on false 
burglary charges in Israel and abused in a mental hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense was absurd. His claim was absurd," U.S. Atty. Robert C. Bonner 
said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
After the verdict, which ended 2 1/2 days of deliberations, Roston was led away 
by federal marshals. He hesitated briefly near his mother, who was biting back 
tears. "I love you," he mouthed. 
</P>
<P>
On the opposite side of the courtroom, Karen Roston's mother, Roberta Seaquist 
of Lantana, Fla., sat crying. 
</P>
<P>
The defense presented no witnesses during the trial, but did introduce a 
passenger list of those aboard the Stardancer cruise from San Pedro to Mexico, 
which included the names of two Israeli nationals who had booked passage after 
the Rostons. 
</P>
<P>
Kenner claimed that he was unable to locate either of the men. But the 
prosecution called one of them on the last day of trial as a surprise witness. 
The man, a Jerusalem photographer, laughingly denied any connections to the 
Israeli government and said he was simply on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
Kenner questioned him closely about his extensive world travels and then asked 
the jury how a wedding photographer could afford to journey around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
After the verdict was read, jurors said they never took Roston's claims about 
the Israeli agents seriously. Many said they were most troubled by Roston's 
conflicting stories, in which he first said his wife had been blown overboard 
by the wind, then asserted that he hadn't seen what happened, then said the 
Israeli agents had done the killing. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he damned himself," said juror Patricia Kellogg, a Lake Elsinore 
housewife. "I think if you take the whole thing, it just didn't make a picture 
of a normal relationship and a normal, stable person." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors never alleged that the killing was premeditated and they also never 
pointed to a motive. But McNally suggested that Roston, a fitness enthusiast, 
had been constantly irritated by his wife's indulgence in sweets. 
</P>
<P>
Other passengers testified that Roston frequently seemed annoyed at his wife, 
on one occasion because of her eating habits, on another because she was unsure 
what silverware to use. 
</P>
<P>
Forewoman Theresa Mahadocon, an accountant from Riverside County, said the 
deliberations were prolonged somewhat by one juror who kept looking for a 
reason for the killing. "She couldn't understand why on a honeymoon would a man 
take his wife's life," Mahadocon said. "I think that bothered all of us." 
</P>
<P>
Karen Roston's mother made a brief statement, saying she and her husband were 
"very happy" about the outcome of the trial. "It won't bring my daughter back," 
she said, "but under the circumstances, it couldn't have worked out any better, 
and I do feel great compassion for Dr. and Mrs. Roston," referring to the 
convicted man's parents. 
</P>
<P>
Kenner said he will appeal the conviction, arguing that U.S. authorities had no 
jurisdiction to try the case because it occurred on a ship under Bahamian 
registry. "I also think there's an insufficiency of the evidence argument to be 
made," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But McNally said the U.S. had clear authority to prosecute Roston because the 
ship was at least in part owned by American citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Under federal sentencing guidelines, Roston faces 11 to 14 years in prison. But 
U.S. District Judge James M. Ideman could sentence him to up to life in prison 
if he finds the case raises special issues not considered in the guideline 
range. Sentencing was set for June 5.

ACCORDIONS SQUEEZE OUT A COMEBACK 
</P>

<P>
When the curtain parted, 32 youthful musicians appeared on the crowded stage, 
each clutching a small accordion to his or her chest. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that when the band of fourth-graders began playing, some had 
forgotten to unclip the leather strap that releases the instrument's bellows. 
The simple tunes, learned during a 10-week program at four Los Angeles public 
schools, were music to their parents' ears. 
</P>
<P>
Warm applause accompanied doting laughter from the mostly Asian, Latino and 
black recital audience, largely unfamiliar with the traditionally European 
instrument. Nearly 300 parents and supporters attended, surpassing anyone's 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
To the Italian government officials who organized the "Accordion Extravaganza" 
held earlier this week at Barnsdall Park, it all represented a welcome sign 
that the long-forgotten accordion may be making a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
The event culminated a pilot project by the Italian Consulate's Trade 
Commission, which provided accordions, teachers and weekly lessons. 
</P>
<P>
It also represented a victory in the newly launched effort by the Italians to 
recapture some of the popularity of the instrument's American heyday during the 
1950s, when accordion studios offered lessons in every neighborhood and 
Lawrence Welk was the polka king. 
</P>
<P>
The recital's success will also be good news to the townspeople of 
Castelfidardo, Italy. According to the trade officials, Italy is the "homeland 
of the accordion" and Castelfidardo is its accordion-making center. 
</P>
<P>
A delegation from the town visited Los Angeles recently to meet with Italian 
Trade Commissioner Francesco Paterno. 
</P>
<P>
"They came to my office and told me, 'Listen, you have to do something to help 
revive the use of the accordion in the United States,' " Paterno said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Completely Dependent 
</P>
<P>
He explained that the town is completely dependent on accordions. 
</P>
<P>
"If they don't sell accordions, the whole town is out of work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Dustin, performing arts director for the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, observed that the advent of electronic instruments spelled the 
accordion's "virtual death" in the United States. Although the district was 
"delighted" to participate in the project, he said he could not remember the 
accordion ever being a part of the district's music program. "Serious musicians 
have traditionally looked upon the accordion as not quite legitimate," he said, 
because it lacks the classical musical tradition of the violin or piano. 
</P>
<P>
Some accordion enthusiasts, however, see signs of a revival. 
</P>
<P>
At the recital, Randy Martin, president of the Accordion Federation of North 
America, lauded the instrument's versatility, portability and natural 
attraction for youngsters. His own jazz combo, which includes seven accordions 
and a drum, performed a raucous trilogy of such rock 'n' roll standards as 
"Twist and Shout." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Varied Combos 
</P>
<P>
Other accordion performers at the recital included a chamber ensemble and a 
jazz trio. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of performers are rediscovering the accordion," Martin said, pointing 
out that such stars as Bruce Springsteen, Paul Simon and Los Lobos, have 
included the accordion in recent recordings. "It's like a mini-renaissance." 
</P>
<P>
Paterno said Los Angeles was picked for the pilot project because it is a 
"trend-setter . . . and because people are easier to convince here; they are 
more willing to experiment." 
</P>
<P>
When the trade commissioner approached the district with his proposal, he 
intentionally chose elementary schools from ethnically diverse neighborhoods -- 
including Castelar near Chinatown, Loreto in heavily Latino Cypress Park, 
Marvin Avenue on the Westside and 32nd Street south of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole point is that we don't want to identify the accordion as an Italian 
ethnic instrument, rather as a universal instrument," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Must Find Sponsors 
</P>
<P>
Paterno added that the success of the pilot project will probably lead to 
programs in other Los Angeles schools. Much will depend on finding sponsors to 
pay the $25,000 bill for each program. 
</P>
<P>
Eight youngsters from each school who showed interest and exhibited the most 
promise were picked by teachers and administrators. Oblivious to the history of 
the accordion's popularity, or to issues of international trade, most of the 
young musicians said they thought the accordion was "fun," although it took 
some a while to warm up to. 
</P>
<P>
Some had never seen or heard an accordion before. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was weird," said Sabrina Yaras, 9, recalling her first 
impression. "But when I heard it, I liked the sound." 
</P>
<P>
The consensus was that the accordion was easy to play. Other advantages are 
that "you can walk with it," and "it makes a lot of noise." 
</P>
<P>
A few, however, remained unconvinced. Kim Lim, 9, of Castelar School, explained 
why she plans to stick with the violin: "The accordion is too heavy to carry 
and my parents think it's too loud."

MAN HELD IN GIRL'S KILLING IS RELEASED AS ALIBI HOLDS; 
</P>
<P>
FOR NADIA'S CLASSMATES: GRIEF, WARINESS 
</P>

Michelle Sherman and her grandmother have a code word. No one -- police 
officer, teacher or family friend -- will ever convince Michelle to get into a 
car unless he utters that code word, she and her grandmother say. 
</P>
<P>
Like many of her classmates at Diamond Elementary School in Santa Ana, Michelle 
was reminded of that Wednesday, a day after the body of schoolmate Nadia Puente 
was found in a garbage can in Los Angeles' Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
The mood around the Diamond school campus was somber Wednesday as psychologists 
talked to students in classrooms to help them cope with their grief and discuss 
their fears, according to Diane Thomas, spokeswoman for the Santa Ana Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers had been told at a morning staff meeting how to identify children who 
might need to talk with a counselor about what they were feeling, Thomas said. 
Several children had sessions with a psychologist, she said, but she did not 
know how many. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a day of grieving" for those at the Diamond school, Thomas said 
Wednesday. "There is a lot of grieving going on today. Because this is a 
student who was very visible on campus." 
</P>
<P>
One of Nadia's close friends was so upset that she stayed home from school, the 
girl's mother said. "She couldn't sleep last night," Teresa Padilla said of her 
8-year-old daughter, Valerie, who she said was very close to Nadia. Padilla had 
stopped at the campus to let school officials know that her daughter would be 
absent. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Girls Club of Santa Ana, where Nadia had been a member, said 
that many of the girls who were on Easter break from their own schools had gone 
to the year-around Diamond school across the street to take advantage of the 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
"The counselors have helped us deal with our emotions and with our grief," said 
Sandee Gordon, executive director of the club, who said she spoke with the 
counselors herself. "We had a couple of girls here who were extremely close to 
Nadia," Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
There were plenty of parents walking their children to school Wednesday 
morning. But school employees said that was not unusual. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the people here walk their kids to school," said 58-year-old Salvador 
Becerra, who has been the school's crossing guard for 2 years. Becerra, who 
monitors the crosswalks at the intersection of Greenville Street and Edinger 
Avenue, said he sees very few children walking alone to the school. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warnings Reinforced 
</P>
<P>
Parents and older siblings who walked younger children to school Wednesday said 
the only difference in their activities since Nadia's kidnaping and slaying was 
to reinforce warnings to come straight home after school and to beware of 
people who might harm them. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to parents' instructions to beware of strangers, police and school 
officials said Wednesday that youngsters should also be wary of people they 
know -- including family friends and casual acquaintances. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally parents say, 'Don't go with strangers,' " said Laurie Clemons, a 
detective who investigates sex crimes for the Westminster Police Department. 
"But to tell a child not to get into the car with a friend of the family is 
something a lot of parents don't do." 
</P>
<P>
Police Department officials said that criminals prey on children's innocence, 
trust and desire to be helpful. Officers who teach safety to children said that 
these people frequently fool children by telling them that their parents are 
ill, by offering candy or money, or by asking children for help. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Use Anything' 
</P>
<P>
"They use anything that would appeal to a child," Clemons said. 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Plettinck, who coordinates children's safety programs for the Anaheim 
School District, emphasized the need for communication between parents and 
their children to establish strict safety guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents should give their children the specific names of people they can ride 
with, any day, any time. If any other person offers, (just say) 'No thank you.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Plettinck said her district's programs teach children to stay at double their 
arm's length away from any adult who might pose a threat, and to run in the 
opposite direction if they are approached. A block-parent program where adult 
participants agree to look out for children who need help is also used in the 
city, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of children feel that because it's a friend of mom and dad, it's OK to 
get in the car," Plettinck said. 
</P>
<P>
So parents must reinforce clear guidelines for their children, she stressed. 
The more a child knows about whom he or she can trust, the safer the child will 
be, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Instruction from school is not enough. "Parents must reinforce it," she added.

WATER CUTBACK TO BE ASKED OF 600,000 OVER 4 DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MITCHELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 600,000 residents of areas scattered from Brea to El Toro will be asked 
to cut back their water use starting Monday as the county shuts down a key 
water-processing station for improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Regions affected are the canyon areas of Brea and Yorba Linda, the eastern 
portions of the cities of Orange and Tustin, the northern half of Irvine, the 
city of Mission Viejo and the communities of Laguna Niguel, El Toro and Lake 
Forest. 
</P>
<P>
The 4-day closure will allow modifications to increase the efficiency of the 
Robert B. Diemer Filtration Plant. The plant normally pumps about 400 million 
gallons of water a day to local water districts, which in turn distribute to 
county residents, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Work Rescheduling Asked 
</P>
<P>
Residents will be asked to curtail their normal water usage starting Monday 
evening and ending Thursday. During that time, residents will be asked not to 
water their lawns or gardens or wash their cars. They also will be asked to 
reduce water usage for washing clothes and dishes. 
</P>
<P>
Local construction companies have been asked to reschedule some work. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Orange County Municipal Water District said the 25-year-old 
plant must be upgraded because of booming growth in the south county. The plant 
will get a new chlorination device, water pumps and several new reservoir 
gates, increasing water-processing capacity by 25%. 
</P>
<P>
Repair crews will work day and night on the project. Service should be restored 
to normal by noon Thursday, according to Stanley Sprague, water district 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
During the shutdown, the communities will continued to receive water from two 
Metropolitan Water District plants in Los Angeles County, Weymuth in La Verne 
and Jensen in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Additional supplies of water will come from area ground water reserves and in 
part from small reserve tanks that are normally used as a backup in case of 
natural disasters, according to Timothy H. Skrove, a spokesman for the 
district.

MAN HELD IN GIRL'S KILLING IS RELEASED AS ALIBI HOLDS; 
</P>
<P>
FREED IN HOURS AFTER FRIENDS BACK STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Just hours after a news conference heralding his arrest, Santa Ana police 
Wednesday released the man they had called a suspect in the abduction and 
slaying of a 9-year-old schoolgirl. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Antonio Gonzalez, 27, of Garden Grove was released Wednesday afternoon 
after friends substantiated his story that he was not at the street corner 
where Nadia Puente was kidnaped Monday as she walked home from Diamond 
Elementary School, Santa Ana Police Capt. James L. Dittman said. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez was released about 2:30 p.m., less than 5 hours after officers 
arrested him as he left his apartment and got into his car. Police announced 
his arrest at an 11 a.m. news conference, saying that a wealth of physical 
evidence linked Gonzalez to Nadia's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Although he was released, police said they have not eliminated Gonzalez as a 
suspect in the girl's death. Police also said they have no other suspects in 
the tragic crime. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth-grader's body was found early Tuesday morning, about 11 hours after 
her abduction, stuffed in a trash bin near the Griffith Park Observatory in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Although police originally believed that she had been strangled, an autopsy 
Wednesday determined that death was caused by asphyxia due to chest 
compression. The chest apparently was compressed against a solid object, 
according to the report by the Los Angeles County coroner's office. There also 
was evidence of sexual molestation, a coroner's office spokesman said, but he 
did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Wednesday that they believe that Nadia's abductor lured her into 
his vehicle, described by witnesses as a small silver car with black stripes on 
the sides, by posing as a teacher who needed help with his books. Dittman said 
a man "had approached other (children) the same day, using the same ruse." 
</P>
<P>
Dittman said Gonzalez is a waiter who worked until 2 p.m. on the day of the 
abduction, "but that's not his alibi." 
</P>
<P>
Dittman would not reveal where Gonzalez said he was at the time of the 
abduction. But he said there were "multiple people who were with him" and added 
that friends who were with Gonzalez when he was arrested "voluntarily came to 
the police station" to corroborate his alibi. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Dittman said, "we have to do some additional work on his alibi," adding 
that police "haven't ruled him out completely" as a suspect in Nadia's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Lt. Robert Chavez described Gonzalez as "cooperative" during 
his questioning at the police station. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Confident' in Morning 
</P>
<P>
At the morning news conference, Police Chief Paul M. Walters said he was "very, 
very confident that this is the person that perpetrated this crime." 
</P>
<P>
Dittman in the afternoon press conference defended the department's earlier 
arrest, saying the earlier evidence "was so strong in pointing to Mr. Gonzalez 
. . . we would have been derelict not to" arrest him. 
</P>
<P>
Police also defended their highly publicized announcement of Gonzalez's arrest. 
It was important to let people know that a suspect had been arrested "to relax 
the fear" in the community, Dittman said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Wednesday afternoon conference, police released a composite drawing of 
the suspect that differs slightly from the original description of the man seen 
by other schoolchildren when he lured Nadia into his car. The earlier 
description was of a Latino man with short, dark, curly hair and a goatee. The 
new drawing shows a clean-shaven man with straight hair and feathery bangs. The 
discrepancy, Dittman explained, is the result of police dealing with "multiple 
witnesses with numerous descriptions." 
</P>
<P>
As for the release of Gonzalez, Dittman said the police are "not at all" back 
to the beginning point in their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Police have collected physical evidence from among the crime scenes, but they 
would not elaborate on whether the evidence was from the abduction or murder 
scenes, or from the Griffith Park site where Nadia's body was found. They would 
not say whether fingerprints were obtained from the trash can. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez Car Impounded 
</P>
<P>
Dittman said police have impounded Gonzalez's car, which is silver with black 
stripes. It matches the color and size and has the same number of doors as the 
vehicle described by witnesses to Nadia's abduction, police said. They said 
they have not 
</P>
<P>
ruled out the possibility that someone else was driving his car. 
</P>
<P>
At the Puente home Wednesday, 20 friends and family members squeezed into the 
living room of the mint green house to watch the 5 p.m. news broadcasts 
chronicling the flip-flopping case. They were silent as Gonzalez's release was 
announced. Some shook their heads. 
</P>
<P>
Nadia's parents, Sara and Armando Puente, were too upset to talk. 
</P>
<P>
The family initially had been heartened by Gonzalez's arrest in the morning. 
"We know it won't bring Nadia back, but it was a relief," said Barbara Arreola, 
Nadia's aunt. The family did not want the ongoing torment of seeing Nadia's 
case unsolved, like that of Patricia Lopez, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia, also 9, disappeared nearly 2 years ago, not far from where Nadia was 
abducted, and was later found slain. No suspects have been arrested in the 
Lopez case, and police have said they are investigating whether the two 
murders, which have both similarities and differences, are related. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez did not immediately return Wednesday to his apartment in the 100-unit 
complex where he lives with several roommates. 
</P>
<P>
One of the roommates, Ismael Bobadilla, 21, said Gonzalez told him in a 
telephone call Wednesday afternoon that he would not return to the apartment 
that night "because of the police and reporters." He said Gonzalez might be 
away for 2 days and possibly was staying with cousins in Downey. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wife, Family in Mexico 
</P>
<P>
Another roommate, Francisco Urena, said Gonzalez did not show up at the 
apartment Tuesday, the day Nadia's body was found, until about 9 p.m., and he 
did not know Gonzalez's whereabouts before then. He said Gonzalez works as a 
waiter at a Mexican restaurant in either Costa Mesa or Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Urena's brother, Humberto, who used to live at the apartment, said Gonzalez is 
married and has no children, but his wife and family live in Guadalajara, 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Humberto Urena said he did not "think that (Gonzalez) had anything to do with 
this (the slaying)," and that Gonzalez had never shown abnormal behavior 
towards children. 
</P>
<P>
"No. Never have I seen anything like that. He's never done anything like that. 
This is my good friend," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another roommate, also named Jose Gonzalez but not related, said he and his 
roommates are "scared." 
</P>
<P>
"He (Jose Antonio Gonzalez) is a good person. He's never caused any problems," 
said the roommate, who did not give his name. 
</P>
<P>
A neighbor who asked not to be identified described Gonzalez as "nice," adding 
that Gonzalez sometimes would translate for him when he needed to talk with 
Spanish-speaking residents. 
</P>
<P>
Of the girl's slaying, the neighbor said, "I knew right away he couldn't have 
done it." 
</P>
<P>
At the time of Gonzalez's arrest, a special task force of officers had worked 
43 hours straight, combing a 10-mile circle around the intersection of 
Greenville and Pomona streets, the site of Nadia's disappearance, for witnesses 
and evidence, and to set up a command post near the girl's house. Police also 
set up a bilingual hot line for anyone to call with information. Police had 
received about 20 calls including what they described as "critical information" 
in the case by mid-morning Wednesday, Dittman said. The hot line, (714) 
647-5495, remains open. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Efforts Praised 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana City Councilwoman Patricia A. McGuigan praised the police efforts at 
the afternoon news conference, adding that she had been at the police command 
post Tuesday when word came in that the body in Griffith Park was Nadia's. The 
officers' faces, she said, were filled with pain. 
</P>
<P>
Two trust funds have been set up for the Puente family, which is unable to pay 
for Nadia's burial costs. Nadia's father is a welder, and her mother works as a 
receptionist. 
</P>
<P>
One trust fund, set up through Diamond Elementary School, has been established 
through the Bank of America branch at 16192 Harbor Blvd., Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The other was established by Luckow Circuit Breakers in Santa Ana, which 
employs Nadia's mother. Owner Ted Luckow said contributions can be mailed to 
the Puente Family Memorial Fund at the business, 2708 S. Grand Ave., Santa Ana, 
Calif. 92708, or at the Wells Fargo Bank, 24791 Alicia Parkway, Laguna Hills, 
Calif. 92653. 
</P>
<P>
"She's like family here," Luckow said of 27-year-old Sara Puente. "I can't tell 
you what this (Nadia's death) has done to the people working here." 
</P>

SCHOOL BOARD RAISES FEES FOR DEVELOPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Education has approved a slight increase in fees that the Los 
Angeles Unified School District can impose on developers for school 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
The increase will generate an additional $1.5 million for school construction, 
a district report said. 
</P>
<P>
Effective June 1, fees on residential development will rise from $1.53 to $1.56 
per square foot, while commercial development fees will increase from 25 cents 
to 26 cents per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
State law requires districts to levy the fees in order to qualify for state 
school construction money. The state authorized the fee increase as an 
inflation adjustment.

VICTIM IDENTIFIES RAMIREZ AT TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman tearfully testified Wednesday that accused Night Stalker Richard 
Ramirez is the man who shot her husband in the head and then raped and 
sodomized her in the bedroom of her Sun Valley home. 
</P>
<P>
"Right there," she said, pointing to the 29-year-old Ramirez. "That's the man 
that killed my husband." 
</P>
<P>
At several points during her 90 minutes on the stand, the woman reiterated that 
she is certain that Ramirez is the man who broke into her three-bedroom house 
just before dawn on July 20, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
She was the fifth prosecution witness to identify Ramirez as the so-called 
Night Stalker. He is on trial for 13 murders and 30 other felonies in a string 
of night-time residential attacks throughout Los Angeles County, mostly in the 
spring and summer of 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The woman said Ramirez also beat up her 8-year-old son, but did not bother the 
couple's 2-year-old daughter, who slept through the attack.

SUPERVISORS OK PLAN FOR CHILDREN'S COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has adopted a plan to build a 
$52.3-million Children's Court and agreed to set aside $3.5 million to purchase 
a site in Monterey Park for the new facility. 
</P>
<P>
A 25-court children's facility will be built on the 4.17-acre site to 
accommodate a program in which judges decide whether children should be placed 
in foster care, as well as deciding on counseling and therapy. 
</P>
<P>
"This court will deal exclusively with cases involving abused, abandoned and 
neglected children -- youngsters who have been removed from their homes because 
of the situations in those environments," said Supervisor Ed Edelman. 
</P>
<P>
The project cost is $7.2 million higher than estimates, which officials blamed 
on inflation and increases in architectural and engineering requirements.

MAN SUFFERS BURNS IN PROPANE EXPLOSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The owner of an automobile tuneup shop suffered severe burns on the chest, 
face, back and arms when a propane tank erupted into flames Wednesday, 
spreading fire through the building, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire caused $25,000 damage to the Accutune Auto Electric building in the 
15100 block of Moran Street, and another $30,000 to its contents before the 
fire was brought under control, Westminster Fire Department Battalion Chief Don 
Herr said. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the business, Steve Oliver, was treated at the scene by 
paramedics, then taken by an ambulance helicopter to the burn unit at UCI 
Medical Center in Orange. He was listed in serious but stable condition with 
second-degree burns over 30% to 40% of his body. 
</P>
<P>
Herr said Oliver was fixing a leaking propane tank in his shop and that it 
exploded while Oliver was working on it. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred at 4:54 p.m., about 100 yards from a Westminster Fire 
Department station, which meant firefighters were able to get there quickly, 
Herr said. It took only about 10 minutes to control the blaze, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The firefighters "were inside the fire station when they heard a knock on the 
door. Workers from the area said there was a fire down the street. They got on 
their rigs and drove down the street," Herr said. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't pull hose that far," he explained.

AUTHORITIES WARN OF ANOTHER AMNESTY FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Men describing themselves as government officials are going door-to-door in 
Latino neighborhoods of Orange County offering guaranteed seats in non-existent 
English and civics classes in exchange for a deposit, authorities said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In a joint news conference, Gerald G. Johnston, Orange County deputy district 
attorney, and Harold Ezell, western region commissioner for the U.S. 
Immigration and Naturalization Service, said they want to alert Latinos to the 
fraud. English and civics classes are required for permanent residency status. 
</P>
<P>
They said well-dressed men are passing themselves off as representatives of the 
"Department of Education" and telling amnesty applicants that they must put 
down deposits ranging from $10 to $50 to reserve seats in the classes. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said authorities have received seven complaints from residents in 
Anaheim, Stanton and Santa Ana who were victimized by the scam. Those 
complaints were forwarded to his office Friday by the Orange County Coalition 
for Immigration Rights. The victims told authorities that the men spoke with an 
Argentine accent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our suspicion that several hundred people have put down deposits," 
Johnston said. He urged that anyone who has been victimized come forward. "Once 
people come forward, we'll have enough information to catch those crooks," he 
said.

PRIVATE GROUPS PLAN OWN LOW-COST HOUSING PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A coalition of church leaders and community organizers, stressing the dearth of 
new affordable housing in Los Angeles, have decided to press forward themselves 
by seeking funds to construct their own development of 500 low-cost homes in 
South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Using a much-praised, church-based housing program in a run-down New York City 
neighborhood as its role model, the group is hoping to provide homes for 
$50,000 to families with annual incomes of $18,000 to $26,000. 
</P>
<P>
As yet unclear is the site for the 25-acre project, to be called Nehemiah West. 
Also still to be determined is where much of the $27 million needed to build 
the homes will come from. 
</P>
<P>
At a City Hall press conference Wednesday, Archbishop Roger M. Mahony, flanked 
by Mayor Tom Bradley and leaders of the South-Central Organizing Committee and 
the United Neighborhoods Organization, pledged $3 million of Los Angeles 
Archdiocese funds to the development. The Roman Catholic leader said he also 
will seek to raise an additional $5 million from other church and community 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, for his part, announced his support of the plan but he added that he 
could not offer any city funds or land at this time. Rather, the mayor said, he 
will "lead the drive" to seek state and federal subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal as currently conceived calls for construction of at least 500 
three-bedroom, 1,150-square-foot houses. Mahony's $3-million commitment and 
other funds he raises would be used for a no-interest, five-year construction 
loan. Coalition leaders said they would try to keep per-home costs at a minimum 
through government subsidies and the hiring of builders willing to work for 
minimal fees. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the SCOC and UNO expressed hope that Nehemiah West would serve as a 
pilot project for a series of affordable housing projects in working-class 
neighborhoods across Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Free of Gangs, Drugs' 
</P>
<P>
"Our housing is run-down, dilapidated, decrepit and owned by others," said 
Bishop E. Lynn Brown of the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church. "Because this 
will be a community and not a scattering of houses, it will be safe and free of 
gangs and drugs." 
</P>
<P>
SCOC board member Gwen Cordova added that at this juncture a grass-roots 
approach appears necessary to stir government action. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody should be doing more -- the federal, the state and the city 
governments," Cordova said after the news conference. "I would say there has 
been a hopeless feeling -- that nothing was happening to make the changes 
needed." 
</P>
<P>
Coalition members said they are exploring several possible sites for Nehemiah 
West, but want to keep most of them private so landowners won't hike their 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
The Wednesday news conference was called after Bradley, stuck in traffic Sunday 
afternoon, missed a large South-Central rally organized by the community 
groups, where he was to have announced his support of the program. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley drew criticism for missing the rally, as he has previously for the 
city's lagging efforts to construct affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
A report issued last December by the mayor's Blue Ribbon Committee for 
Affordable Housing called for the city to increase its current housing 
resources by 300%. The report said that 40,000 Los Angeles families live in 
garages and 150,000 households spend more than half of their paychecks for 
rent. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the city builds about 1,500 low-rent apartments a year, using a 
combination of local property tax funds, private credit investment and federal 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is modeled after the nationally recognized Nehemiah development in 
Brooklyn, which has provided 1,200 low-cost brick row houses since 1982. The 
New York development, named after the Biblical prophet sent to rebuild 
Jerusalem, was funded with an $8-million revolving construction fund and city 
subsidies of free land, tax abatements and cash.

RELOCATION FEE EXTENDED TO ILLEGAL RENTAL UNITS; 
</P>
<P>
CITY COUNCIL APPROVES ORDINANCE TO REQUIRE LANDLORDS TO PAY UP TO $5,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Property owners who illegally convert garages or other structures into rental 
units must pay up to $5,000 to tenants who are forced out because of 
substandard conditions under an ordinance approved Wednesday by the Los Angeles 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Tenants' rights attorneys praised the law because it will offer for the first 
time relocation assistance to renters of illegal, substandard dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Source of Protection 
</P>
<P>
"This is literally going to help thousands of poor people who before today did 
not have any protection from evictions," said Mary Lou Villar, an attorney with 
the East Los Angeles Legal Aid Foundation. "Up until now if you were kicked out 
of a garage, you were out on the street." 
</P>
<P>
City law already requires landlords of legal dwellings to pay for tenant 
relocation when renters are evicted for necessary improvements or when the unit 
is declared unsafe by city inspectors from the Building and Safety Department. 
But a loophole in the law did not require property owners of illegally 
converted units to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
"The law has to apply equally to every landlord, whether it's an illegal unit 
or not," said Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who introduced the measure. 
</P>
<P>
The council passed the ordinance 12-0 and sent it to Mayor Tom Bradley for 
approval. Bradley has not yet studied the ordinance or taken a position on it, 
a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Focus on Illegal Units 
</P>
<P>
It will largely affect homeowners who turn garages into apartments or build 
illegal rental units onto their homes, said Barbara Zeidman, director of the 
city's rent stabilization unit. 
</P>
<P>
These units sometimes come to the attention of city officials after neighbors 
report substandard conditions, such as poor plumbing, exposed wiring and 
makeshift gas lines. 
</P>
<P>
Under the ordinance, renters who are disabled, 62 or older or have children 
will receive $5,000. Single adults will receive $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
A Times investigation in May, 1987, revealed that roughly 42,000 illegal garage 
dwellings shelter about 200,000 people throughout Los Angles County. The garage 
homes, a disturbing outgrowth of the region's affordable housing crisis, lie in 
a swath of mostly low-income Latino neighborhoods from Sylmar through East Los 
Angeles into Long Beach, the Times study showed. 
</P>
<P>
The number of illegal dwellings in Los Angeles is not known. But the city's 
Building and Safety Department receives about 500 complaints a month, many of 
which concern garage and other illegal dwellings, said Mel Bliss, chief of the 
Bureau of Community Safety.

BOGGS' OFFER TO SETTLE CONTAINS A GAG CLAUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, Times Staff Writer, 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Margo Adams accepts baseball star Wade Boggs' surprise offer of $20,000 to 
drop her palimony lawsuit against him, the Costa Mesa woman would also have to 
stop talking publicly about the suit, Boggs' lawyer said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The stipulation, however, is not an attempt to stop publication of the second 
installment in May of an interview Adams gave to Penthouse magazine, said 
Jennifer J. King, a Tustin attorney representing Boggs. 
</P>
<P>
The Penthouse interview, the first installment of which appears in the 
magazine's current April issue, is off limits, said King, because it is "a part 
of a contract" between Adams and Penthouse and to try to quash it "would be 
inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Talk Show Tour 
</P>
<P>
The already published portions of the interview detail Adams' 4-year 
relationship with the married Boston Red Sox third baseman and describe sexual 
antics she attributes to Boggs and some of his teammates. Adams has embarked on 
a talk show tour to promote sales of the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Boggs has said in the past that he would not negotiate with Adams. But King 
said he has changed his mind and offered to settle her lawsuit last week solely 
because he wanted to "relieve pressures" on his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
The teammates "are concerned that they would be required to give depositions 
and have to interrupt their season and not without justification," King said. 
</P>
<P>
Adams, a 32-year-old former Miss Stanton, filed the Superior Court suit in 
Santa Ana last June charging Boggs with breach of an oral contract and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Adams says Boggs had promised to give her money to offset her expenses and loss 
of income from her travel around the country to meet him when he was playing 
road games. Her attorney has said Adams quit her job as a mortgage broker on 
Boggs' promise that he would make up for her lost income. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement offer, which King said was formally made last week, was made 
public in Wednesday's editions of the Boston Globe. The offer has been 
acknowledged by Adams' Irvine-based lawyer, James F. McGee, but King said no 
formal response has been received. 
</P>
<P>
McGee did not return calls Wednesday and Adams could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
A woman identified by police as Adams was arrested last weekend on a 
shoplifting charge at Costa Mesa's South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
King said Wednesday that the arrest and Adams' earlier conviction on a credit 
card offense would probably have no bearing on the lawsuit because misdemeanors 
are not admissible as character evidence in civil cases.

MOTHER IN CUSTODY AFTER FATAL SHOOTING OF ONLY DAUGHTER, 29 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Fullerton woman was in police custody Wednesday after she allegedly shot and 
killed her 29-year-old daughter following an argument, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Toni McKay, 54, was arrested on suspicion of murder in connection with the 
death of her only daughter, Carla Vravis, who died after being rushed to UCI 
Medical Center shortly after the incident Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Police said McKay had gone to her daughter's house in the 1600 block of East 
Redwood Avenue about 8 p.m. Shortly after she arrived, they began arguing and 
her daughter ordered her to leave. 
</P>
<P>
As McKay left the house, she allegedly pulled a .25-caliber handgun and fired 
several shots into the front door, killing her daughter, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an ongoing thing where they simply weren't getting along," Anaheim 
Police Sgt. Chet Barry said. "Obviously the feelings were running very deep." 
</P>
<P>
McKay jumped into her car and fled after the shooting, Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
Vravis' husband, Gregory, 32, grabbed a gun, ran outside and fired an 
undetermined number of shots at the car's tires, Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton police, who heard a radio broadcast describing McKay's car, spotted 
it outside a restaurant at the intersection of Placentia and Nutwood avenues 
several hours later. 
</P>
<P>
When police entered the restaurant, they found McKay talking on a pay 
telephone. She was asking police at Vravis' home about her daughter's 
condition. Police said she was carrying the gun they believe was used in the 
shooting. McKay was arrested without incident and was being held at Anaheim 
City Jail in lieu of $25,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Vravis' brother, Paul, said Wednesday that the shots McKay allegedly 
fired may have been intended for Gregory. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Vravis said that his brother was reading in the den when he heard his wife 
and McKay arguing. 
</P>
<P>
"Greg came to the front door as she (McKay) was leaving," Vravis said. "She 
pulled a gun and Greg jumped aside, slammed the door and yelled she had a gun," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Carla Vravis was standing behind her husband. 
</P>
<P>
One bullet pierced a small windowpane on the right side of the wooden front 
door and another penetrated the door's left corner. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point, Carla yelled that she had been hit and was going to call 
police. Greg said he was going to stop her from leaving. He took a pistol and 
tried to shoot a tire out. He fired once and then realized that there were 
other people in the vicinity. 
</P>
<P>
"When he came back in she was unconscious and the phone was dangling and the 
operator from 911 was yelling over the phone to apply CPR," Paul Vravis said. 
</P>
<P>
Police yesterday confirmed that Gregory Vravis fired an undetermined number of 
shots at McKay's car but said they did not intend to charge him because he was 
trying to stop the suspect from leaving the scene. 
</P>
<P>
About eight children were playing hide-and-seek across the street from Vravis' 
home when the shots rang out, according to neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"We heard four to five gunshots" at first, said Larry Rawley, 29, who lives 
with his wife across the street from the Vravises. 
</P>
<P>
"We went to the front door and saw a Honda Accord backing down our street all 
the way to the end of the block," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory and Carla Vravis, who grew up and met in Las Vegas, had been married 
for 8 years, Paul Vravis said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very sad," he said. "They were just very happy people. They really 
enjoyed one another."

AZTECS UPSTAGE KENNEDY TO WIN TOURNAMENT TITLE

La Quinta High School stole the spotlight from Kennedy Wednesday, defeating its 
Garden Grove League rival, 7-1, for the championship of the Anaheim Lions 
tournament at Glover Field. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy -- the preseason favorite to win the Garden Grove League title -- had 
not allowed a run in 25 consecutive innings. And Robert Espinoza, fresh off a 
no-hitter over Riordan of San Francisco in the first round, was on the mound 
trying to extend that streak. 
</P>
<P>
But the Aztecs pounded out seven hits for seven runs in the first two innings, 
while Corey Giuliano, the tournament's most valuable pitcher, tossed a 
four-hitter, striking out six and walking one. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tough situation to have to play against a team they consider the best 
in your league," La Quinta Coach Dave Demerest said. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll use this as an incentive 10 days from now (when the teams meet in 
league play). 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope our kids have enough intelligence to realize the score is 0-0 
again in 10 days." 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta (10-2-1) took care of that in a hurry Wednesday, as Jason Parsons 
lined a triple to the right-field alley, driving in two runs with one out in 
the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
Before the inning was over, the Aztecs had scored five runs (three earned) on 
four hits, chasing Espinoza (1-2). 
</P>
<P>
Parsons, the tournament MVP, was two for four with two runs scored and two 
RBIs. Left fielder James Johnson was one for two with two RBIs and two walks. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's Scott Walker entered the game in the second inning, allowing two runs 
(one earned) before settling down with 3 1/3 hitless innings. Mike Stenner 
pitched a perfect final two-thirds of an inning for the Fighting Irish. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy (8-3) managed just a run in the second off Giuliano (5-1), who also 
pitched a four-hitter in the first round against University. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted this one," said Giuliano, a senior left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I could complete it. I like to throw a lot of innings, the adrenaline 
was flowing and I felt really good. 
</P>
<P>
"Pitching is supposed to be our weak spot, but we have been really great." 
</P>
<P>
In other Anaheim Lions tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos 8, Canyon 0 -- Tony Coto pitched a three-hitter, striking out six, for 
Cerritos in the consolation final at Glover Stadium. Ricky Craddle had a solo 
home run for Cerritos. Canyon is 5-6 on the season. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster 7, Dana Hills 4 -- Brett Grebe was three for four with two RBIs to 
help Westminster rally for the victory in the third-place game at Glover 
Stadium. Chris Larson was two for four with a double, a steal and two RBIs for 
Westminster (8-2-1). Lance Marks hit a two-run homer in the first inning to 
give Dana Hills a 2-0 lead. Mike Oetinger was two for three with a double for 
Dana Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Troy 15, Garden Grove 3 -- The Warriors scored 11 runs in the second to erase a 
2-0 lead in a consolation-round game at Glover Stadium. Craig Cochell hit a 
bases-loaded double to drive in two runs in the second and Tom Furukawa 
followed with a double to drive in two more. Tom Wilson (3-0) pitched a 
three-hitter, striking out 12, for the Warriors (6-2). Wilson allowed three 
unearned runs. LARRY NISTA

GOLDEN WEST'S PAQUETTE STRENGTHENS TEAM WITH MOVE TO SHORTSTOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Kresal 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Craig Paquette has made a somewhat unexpected return to his boyhood baseball 
home -- shortstop -- this season for Golden West College. 
</P>
<P>
Paquette played shortstop in youth leagues. He was the starting shortstop as a 
junior at Rancho Alamitos High School. But he was moved to third base as a 
senior and continued to play third last season at Golden West. 
</P>
<P>
Paquette played third last summer in practice and also spent most of the winter 
practices at third. But as the winter season progressed, Golden West Coach Burt 
Villarreal got an idea. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a feeling that we would be a better team with him at short," said 
Villarreal. "I'm not sure why, but he needed to be there for us to win." 
</P>
<P>
Paquette was pleased by the move, which came a few weeks before the start of 
the season. Last season's starting shortstop had graduated. 
</P>
<P>
"I played shortstop all my life," he said. "It's not that new. The only thing 
new is that I give signs on who's covering second. But that's good. It keeps me 
more involved and in the game on every pitch." 
</P>
<P>
Paquette has had a bit of trouble fielding with seven errors in 18 games for 
Golden West (12-6). Despite the errors, Villarreal has no intention of moving 
Paquette back to third base. 
</P>
<P>
Paquette hit .386 last season with seven home runs and 58 RBIs. He came into 
this season with one goal -- to improve his numbers. 
</P>
<P>
But as one of only two returning starters this season, Paquette said he pressed 
early, tried to do too much and got off to a slow start. Although he still 
hasn't found any consistency, he is starting to improve. Paquette, a 
right-handed hitter, is batting .333 with a team-leading six home runs and 21 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
After not hitting a home run in Golden West's first nine games, he hit two in a 
6-4 loss at Cerritos. He hit two more home runs the next day as the Rustlers 
defeated Saddleback, 12-5. 
</P>
<P>
Paquette is being recruited by Cal State Fullerton, Cal State Long Beach and 
Arizona State and also is considering the professional draft. Paquette was 
picked in the 36th round by the Minnesota Twins out of high school. He plans to 
sign with a college right away -- the first day to sign is April 15 -- then 
wait for the draft. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to stay aggressive and keep swinging," Paquette said. "I'm hoping 
to get a little more consistent." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Single has been named coach of the Saddleback women's basketball program. 
Saddleback didn't have a team last season because of a lack of players. 
</P>
<P>
Single worked last fall and winter as an assistant to Ernie Carr on the men's 
team. He was the boys' basketball coach at Downey High School from 1982-88 with 
a record of 104-47. He still teaches there. 
</P>
<P>
"The challenge of starting a program from the ground up is intriguing," Single 
said. "The main thing is that we get the top girls in the area involved, bring 
the program back and build some credibility." 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast's Dareck Crane was voted by the coaches to the 20-member all-state 
men's basketball team. Crane, a 6-foot-3 sophomore guard, was the co-most 
valuable player of the Orange Empire Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Crane averaged 17.5 points, 5.1 rebounds and 4.3 assists this season. He played 
at Compton High School before coming to OCC. Crane hasn't decided where he will 
play next season. 
</P>
<P>
Markus Muller-Stach of Golden West was an honorable-mention selection. 
Muller-Stach, a 6-5 forward from Corona del Mar High School, averaged 22.2 
points a game this season. He has signed a national letter of intent to attend 
University of the Pacific next fall. 
</P>

Community College Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tania Ziegert, a former Golden West swimmer who is now at Cal Poly San Luis 
Obispo, became an All-American when she finished third in the 500- and 
1,650-meter freestyle in the Division II national swimming championships in 
Buffalo last week. Her times of 5:00.15 in the 500 and 17:13.0 in the 1,650 set 
school records. . . . Noble Franklin has been named the running back coach at 
Rancho Santiago. Franklin replaces Bruce Rollinson, who left to become football 
coach at Mater Dei High School . . . Outfielders Jason Young and Eddie Pierce 
of OCC will play for the Brewster Whitecaps this summer in the Cap Cod League 
for college baseball players. . . . The men's state basketball tournament is 
scheduled to be played at UC Irvine next season. . . . Dion Evans and Eric 
Turner of Rancho Santiago have signed letters of intent to play football next 
fall. Evans, a running back, will play at San Francisco State. Turner, a 
quarterback, will play at Southwest Texas State.

<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Guccione gave up only three hits in seven innings as Orange Coast College 
defeated Los Angeles Harbor, 3-1, Wednesday in the first round of the Long 
Beach tournament at Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Guccione (1-0) struck out five and walked five. Eddie Pierce replaced him in 
the eighth inning with no outs and a runner on first. Pierce retired the last 
six batters, striking out two, for the save. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates (16-8-1) took a 1-0 lead in the third. Consecutive singles by 
Isidro Maldonado and Mike Kelly put runners on first and second with no outs. 
Maldonado later scored on a sacrifice fly by Craig Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
In the fifth, Mike Kelly walked and went to third on a single by Hector Santa 
Cruz. Kelly scored on a sacrifice fly by Pierce.

<P>
In the eighth, Nixon led off with a triple and scored on a groundout by Marty 
Cordova.

after the ball got away from the shortstop, John McTaggart also scored. 
McTaggart was three for five with three runs scored, two homers and four RBIs 
for Rancho Santiago (15-8). The Dons play Moorpark today at 2 p.m.

LIGHTS FANTASTIC, TOMORROWLAND TECH TO REPLACE DISNEYLAND'S 1959 MARQUEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Disneyland marquee is changing, but the message will remain the same. 
</P>
<P>
In 60 to 90 days, Disneyland will be replacing its 30-year-old sign at the 
front entrance. In its place will be a new marquee 30% bigger -- 1,761 square 
feet -- with electronic display boards to flash messages about the park and 
traffic instructions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to look great," said Bob Roth, park spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the reader board with messages, the new sign "will have fiber 
optics, where we can change colors and do color combinations on the letters," 
so colors can be switched from purple sheen to red to yellow, Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
What will not change is the message. The new sign will still proclaim 
Disneyland to be "The Happiest Place on Earth." 
</P>
<P>
The current sign has greeted Disneyland patrons since about 1959. The new one 
is designed to better match the high-tech look of Captain EO and Space 
Mountain. "This is going to be state of the art," Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
After all, he said, "the sign is the first thing people see when they come to 
Disneyland. It should be the best it can be."

DECLINE IN QUARTERLY EARNINGS CAUSES COMPREHENSIVE CARE TO CANCEL DIVIDEND 
</P>

<P>
Directors of Comprehensive Care Corp. said Wednesday that they will not pay a 
quarterly shareholder dividend in light of a 55% decline in the firm's 
third-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine-based operator of alcohol and drug abuse treatment programs reported 
net earnings of $860,000 for the third quarter ended Feb. 28, compared to $1.9 
million in the year-earlier period. The company said the earnings included a 
gain of about $500,000 from the sale of the company's CareUnit of DuPage, Ill., 
a treatment center facility. 
</P>
<P>
The company has issued quarterly dividends since 1976. In recent quarters, the 
company has issued a 10-cent quarterly dividend for each of its shares, worth 
about $1.1 million for all 10.1 million of the firm's shares outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials, who could not be reached for comment, said in a prepared 
statement that "restrictions in loan agreements" were another reason directors 
decided against paying a dividend. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Cash on Hand 
</P>
<P>
One industry analyst said Comprehensive Care also might have decided against a 
dividend so that more cash would be available within the company to help a 
prospective buyer finance an acquisition of the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Comprehensive Care said it had appointed a special committee of 
directors to evaluate strategic alternatives, including a possible financial 
restructuring, asset sale or acquisition by another firm. 
</P>
<P>
Comprehensive Care's third-quarter earnings were way down despite a 4% increase 
in revenue. The firm posted revenue of $54.5 million, compared to $52.4 million 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
The company said pretax operating earnings for the quarter declined about $2.3 
million compared to the year-earlier period. Much of the decline was attributed 
to higher costs and less than expected occupancy at its facilities in December. 
</P>
<P>
For the first 9 months of fiscal 1989, Comprehensive Care's net earnings 
declined by 15% to $5.6 million, compared to $6.6 million in the year-earlier 
period. Revenues for the period were up 12% to $171.9 million, compared to 
$152.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
A decline in patient count in March will reduce fourth-quarter expectations, 
the company said. Patient count had improved in January and February. 
</P>
<P>
The company's stock lost $1.375 per share Wednesday, closing at $9.75, in 
unusually heavy trading of 254,600 shares on the New York Stock Exchange.

<P>
On stage and off, comedian Steve Mittleman is the epitome of understatement, 
which belies the ambition and career drive that have given him, at 33, numerous 
impressive credits and may propel him to even loftier career heights. 
</P>
<P>
His list of credits is as long as Kareem's arm and includes the two top 
stand-up showcases on television ("Late Night With David Letterman" and "The 
Tonight Show"), as well as acting work in top-drawer comedy films (Steve 
Martin's "Roxanne" and Woody Allen's "Radio Days"). 
</P>
<P>
These achievements are the product of a burning desire -- make that burning 
need -- to perform that first lured him on stage in New York almost 13 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I was addicted," Mittleman said. "Every night I went on stage, it was getting 
a fix. I really needed it. I wanted it so badly when I started, that if I 
didn't get on (stage that night), I would go on after the show and do my act to 
nobody." 
</P>
<P>
This compulsion was so potent that he decided he didn't have the time or 
interest to pursue stand-up and continue attending classes at the University of 
Buffalo. So he quit school. 
</P>
<P>
Mittleman -- who performs this weekend at Coconuts in Anaheim -- then plunged 
headlong into learning his craft, constantly writing and performing around town 
before hitting the road and further honing his act in various American, 
Canadian and European venues. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, he locked into his low-key style: clever, understated material 
imparted with a retiring, kill-'em-with-softness delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Mittleman faces a significant challenge by working subtly, which can 
be a tougher sell in an age when many of his compatriots are high-energy 
jokesters with an edge. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, then you've got to put it into more of a high gear," explained 
Mittleman, who now lives in Los Angeles. "I like to do subtle material that has 
a big punch. . . . The greatest thing is selling material that is unique and 
dry and different. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure there are a lot of comedians who are doing the same material that 
they started years ago but found a little niche that made them able to sell 
it," he continued during an interview at Gio's in Hollywood after a recent 
performance. "Like Emo Philips. I'm sure he had tough times over the years, and 
then he came into his own." 
</P>
<P>
Mittleman enjoys shaping his subtle material into various lengths and contexts. 
He might do quick, hit-and-run observations or he might spin a lengthy yarn. He 
might joke about himself, especially his height (6-foot-4) or his recessed chin 
("The worst thing about having a weak chin is it takes me 3 to 4 hours to 
change a pillowcase."). He might do some variation -- or combination -- of 
these tacks. 
</P>
<P>
When he steps off stage, he's just as likely to be hunched over a desk turning 
out a screenplay. "Script writing is as much a priority as anything," he said. 
"I love it more than anything else I've ever done." 
</P>
<P>
That, apparently, is no joke. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the neighborhood plumber and all the other screen-writing dilettantes 
around, Mittleman understands the grueling effort necessary to make a good 
script -- and seems to relish it. That's why he's put stand-up on the back 
burner (he has cut down on his road work and even local appearances), to devote 
more time to screen writing -- even rewriting. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, the man who was once addicted to stand-up performance says he's 
finding it more satisfying "to sit down 4 or 5 hours a day and rewrite this 
(current screenplay) for 6 weeks, do it sanely and know what I was doing." If 
it appears that Mittleman aspires to become a full-fledged Hollywood Hyphenate 
-- in his case: comic-actor-writer -- you're getting the hang of his ambitious 
game plan. 
</P>
<P>
"They all help each other," he said. "When you study acting, it has to help 
your stand-up and your writing because you're developing an ear for the 
characters and your own stage character. Writing has to help the stand-up and 
the acting. And stand-up has to help the writing." 
</P>
<P>
And what helps all of those things is an uncompromising work ethic. This is a 
concept Mittleman has long understood, but gained new appreciation for through 
his associations with Steve Martin and Woody Allen. 
</P>
<P>
"Working with them," Mittleman recalled, "I learned I have to work harder. I 
started working harder, and now things are starting to pay off." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Mittleman will perform Friday at Saturday at 8:30 and 10 p.m. at 
Coconuts in the Ramada Inn, 1331 E. Katella Ave., Anaheim. Tickets: $5. 
Information: 714-978-0521.

PREMIERE OF WORK BY ZELMAN BOKSER, UCI PROFESSOR, HEARD AT THE BILTMORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NATHAN WANG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It must be a delight for a composer to have formidable and sensitive musicians 
to give the world premiere of a work. Such was the case for Zelman Bokser on 
Tuesday evening at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The second concert of Pacific Serenades' third season featured Bokser's new, 
commissioned piece, "Behind the Darkening Clouds," as played by violinist 
Rochelle Abramson, cellist Sebastian Toettcher and pianist Gayle Blankenburg. 
An atonal composition of three movements, the work weaves vigorously through 
lyrical passages, punctuated by forceful, whole-tone statements. The trio 
played decisively and brooded where the music demanded it. 
</P>
<P>
The most challenging movement is the last, where Bokser, a UC Irvine music 
faculty member skilled at creating tension, miraculously kept motion constant, 
even through silent moments. As well written as it is, "Behind the Darkening 
Clouds" somehow seems more a showcase for the instrumentalists' technical and 
musical prowess than the composer's writing talent. 
</P>
<P>
The program began with Ravel's Sonata for Violin and Piano. Abramson succeeded 
in capturing the jazzy charm of the piece, while Blankenburg ably supported on 
the keyboard, although her playing sometimes seemed too reserved. 
</P>
<P>
Smetana's Piano Trio in G minor was performed by all three with sensitivity and 
energy. Still, the ensemble at times was not balanced precisely -- too much 
violin and not enough cello. 
</P>
<P>
For an encore, the group played the Scherzo of Mendelssohn's Trio in D minor. 
Technically, it was all there, but the tempo was so swift that the music became 
glossed over and sacrificed for dazzle. 
</P>

COMEDY TAKES AIM AT THE TEMPERAMENTAL ACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Jitters" is a comedy, all right, but it also feels like a playwright's 
good-humored revenge on temperamental actors. 
</P>
<P>
Playwright David French apparently has first-hand knowledge of actors' foibles, 
and he puts them on parade in "Jitters." French isn't too mean about it, but he 
is insistent. Just about everybody in this near-farce is an actor (or former 
actor), and just about everybody is a little foolish. 
</P>
<P>
They're also self-absorbed, preeningly proud, amazingly insecure -- and often 
funny, especially under Craig Fleming's wide-open direction in the Laguna 
Playhouse production that runs through April 9 at the Moulton Theatre in Laguna 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Jitters" is not a great comedy -- the last act seems to go on and on -- but 
it's not bad. Fleming works at giving the audience a good time. 
</P>
<P>
The plot revolves around rehearsals for a drama at a Canadian playhouse in need 
of a hit. The theater, known for its artistry but skimpy box office, brings 
together some of the country's best actors, including the grand Jessica Logan 
(Katherine Rodecker). 
</P>
<P>
Logan has even ventured to Broadway, which irks the respected but irascible 
Patrick Flanagan (George Woods), who has to assume second billing when she 
joins the party. But there's more than just marquee-status friction at hand. At 
least Logan left the provincial safety of Canada to see whether she had the 
stuff. Flanagan's too chicken, and that irks him. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, they battle almost nonstop. Into this tempest-in-a-theater is tossed 
a band of stage folk including a neurotic character actor (Jeffrey Markle), a 
young first-timer (Rich Jackson), a martinet of a stage manager (Tony Crowell), 
an intense playwright (Dan Finn) and a fatherly director (Bob Kokol). 
</P>
<P>
Fleming gets good performances from his cast, especially Woods in the pivotal 
role. This guy is all bluff and blather, and Woods makes him as windy as can 
be. Woods also gets us to see his nastiness without separating us from the 
character -- not a minor accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
Rodecker's Logan is both strong and emotional, and Markle, as the character 
actor, Phil, plays it pretty big but is funny nonetheless. Rich Jackson brings 
an appropriately antic restlessness to the young actor; Kokol is a vision of 
exasperation, and Finn is broodingly distracted. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Maddy's set, of a set and the backstage dressing room, is more 
serviceable than special. Both D. Scott Linder's lighting and Marthella 
Randall's costumes fit the show. 
</P>
<P>
'JITTERS' 
</P>
<P>

Fleming. With George Woods, Katherine Rodecker, Jeffrey Markle, Bob Kokol, Dan 
Finn, Rich Jackson, Tony Crowell, Wendy Abas and Joan Lorenzen. Sets by Steve 
Maddy. Lighting by D. Scott Linder. Costumes by Marthella Randall. Sound by

WINE NOTES: WHAT'S IN A NAME? ASK SEBASTIANI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, Times Wine Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The application for a fictitious business name, filed with the Napa County 
Clerk's office, said merely that the Sutter Home Winery, the largest marketer 
of White Zinfandel in the world, wanted to use 19 new brand names. 
</P>
<P>
Among them was the name Domaine White Zinfandel. 
</P>
<P>
After the recent flap created by Sebastiani Vineyards over the use of a 
varietal designation in a brand name, it was clear what Sutter Home was doing. 
</P>
<P>
But first the background. 
</P>
<P>
Late last year, Sebastiani president Don Sebastiani applied for, and gained 
approval to use the brand name Domaine Chardonnay on a line of white table wine 
that would sell for about $5 a bottle or less. 
</P>
<P>
He announced that the wine itself would contain no Chardonnay at all. 
</P>
<P>
The idea, he said, was to make a wine that tasted more like Chardonnay than 
some of the $5 Chardonnays now on the market that are technically entitled to 
carry the name Chardonnay but contain up to 25% of grapes like Riesling and 
Muscat. Such wines have an aroma that's nothing at all like Chardonnay. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consumers Outraged 
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF), the branch of the Treasury 
Department that controls wine, gave Sebastiani approval for the use of the name 
Domaine Chardonnay, never asking if the wine itself would have any Chardonnay 
in it. 
</P>
<P>
Screaming foul and fraud, wine consumers and members of the industry were 
outraged. Two consumers even sued Sebastiani to prevent the wine from hitting 
store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
Even field office officials of BATF admitted the approval to use the brand name 
by their Washington office was probably a serious error, and one pointed out 
what could likely happen if it were permitted. "We could have Chateau Cabernet 
and the wine would have no Cabernet in it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Such obfuscation could "wreck the credibility of the varietal designation as we 
know it," said one Sonoma County wine maker, who was so irate he said he was 
prepared to "run down there (Sonoma) and let the air out of Don's tires." 
</P>
<P>
Sutter Home Winery didn't say boo, it just acted. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as I saw a copy of the (Sebastiani) label and heard all the hoopla, I 
said, 'It looks like they're going to allow it,' so I decided to apply for all 
those names," said Roger Trinchero, president of Sutter Home. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we have a lot of equity built up in the name of Zinfandel, and we 
don't want to risk the possibility that someone could capitalize on what we've 
developed. So we applied for all these names, not because we're going to use 
them, but just to make sure someone else doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
Among the names listed on Sutter Home's application with the county were White 
Zinfandel Cellars, White Zinfandel Vineyard and Winery, and even Zinfandel Hill 
Cellars. (Sutter Home is located on the Napa Valley floor.) 
</P>
<P>
Since the Domaine Chardonnay controversy arose, BATF has ruled that Sebastiani 
may not use the name after all, but, "At the time we applied for this, our 
indication was that Sebastiani was going to be permitted to market a Domaine 
Chardonnay," said Trinchero. 
</P>
<P>
Trinchero said he has no plans to use any of the names, and that he registered 
them to prevent anyone else from using them. 
</P>
<P>
Flora Springs Winery in the Napa Valley eschews the term reserve for its 
top-of-the-line, limited-quantity Chardonnay, preferring instead to call the 
wine Barrel Fermented. 
</P>
<P>
The phrase, first used on a Flora Springs Chardonnay in 1980, unfortunately 
doesn't tell the whole story of the time and effort that this family-owned 
property has invested trying to come up with a classic. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 Flora Springs Barrel Fermented Chardonnay has just been released and 
it is wine maker Ken Deis' magnum opus in terms of style and quality, better 
than anything the winery previously produced. 
</P>
<P>
There is a delicate spice and sandalwood character to the initial aroma and 
then an extremely rich, complex scent follows it. The taste is layered with 
multiple elements and the aftertaste is a pure delight of warmth and richness 
with a lean, crisp finish. There's no overt buttery quality here, just deep, 
rich Chardonnay flavors and a note of oak. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Magnificent Wine 
</P>
<P>
This is a magnificent wine, worth the $21 price tag. Better still is a 
limited-quantity (200-case) Flora Springs Chardonnay made even better by aging 
the wine an additional length of time on its yeast lees (the traditional French 
"sur lie" process). 
</P>
<P>
This wine, which will be available only at the winery, was made from the same 
wine as the Barrel Fermented, but the added aging in barrel makes it truly 
marvelous, with a vanilla creaminess added to the other elements. 
</P>
<P>
For those who can't find Chateau Woltner Chardonnays mentioned here recently, 
or who find the Woltner wines too pricey (at $25 to $54 a bottle), the Flora 
Springs Barrel Fermented Chardonnay is made in a similar style and is equally 
impressive. The "sur lie" wine has not yet been priced. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a curious story that is amusing for those who remember their periodic 
chart of elements from chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
At the National Orange Show Wine Competition held earlier this month, wines 
were served blind to all judges in coded glasses. After the first 26 glasses 
had been served in a group from A to Z, lettering codes proceeded AA, AB, etc. 
</P>
<P>
By coincidence, in a class of Cabernet Sauvignons, a wine coded AU was awarded 
a gold medal and a wine with the code AG got a silver medal. 
</P>
<P>
Since the wines were coded, results weren't immediately released so I haven't 
yet found out who made AU and AG.

 ABOUT WINE: TIGHTENING THE SCREWS ON TANNIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, Times Wine Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The tannin found in most red wines has been the bugaboo of wine evaluators for 
decades. Many wine evaluators ignore it. They make believe it's not there, or 
they alibi for the wine by saying the wine has "ample tannin to age well." 
</P>
<P>
When a wine has good fruit but a slug of astringent, bitter tannins, a lot of 
people say: "Give the wine time; it'll improve." A decade later, someone opens 
the wine to find the tannin still having a party. Actually, it's a wake for the 
fruit. 
</P>
<P>
I evaluate a lot of young wine and I find a lot of tannin. Yet for years I too 
have ignored the obvious. I have kept silent. But I can keep still no longer: 
</P>
<P>
California Cabernet Sauvignon is simply too tannic. There, I've said it. I feel 
better already. 
</P>
<P>
Cabernet is California's greatest achievement with wine. At its best it holds 
its own against the best of Bordeaux. And some of them age beautifully. 
</P>
<P>
But often Cabernet is made rough and astringent by wine makers who worry not 
about tannin. There is much mass blindness on this subject. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these tannic wines show opulent fruit early. Wine makers assume that 
tannin -- which is an anti-oxidant -- will help preserve the wine. Frequently 
such wine is marked "unfined and unfiltered," which is vinspeak that wine 
makers use as a sort of quality statement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overrated Protector 
</P>
<P>
Yet wine scientists say tannin is overrated as a protector, and that what's 
truly necessary for a wine to age well is good balance of all elements, 
including the acid and pH. 
</P>
<P>
When gonzo Cabernets get some bottle age, they begin to lose their fruit. But 
the tannin drops out of the wine far more slowly than the fruit. The result is 
often a wine that is lifeless; in vinspeak, it is "dried out." 
</P>
<P>
Chewy, unctuous, tannic wines are not the best wines for long-term aging. Those 
that age best have fruit, lower tannins and a silky quality. These are wines 
that some tasters (especially those with short-term tasting experience) rate as 
wines to drink young because of their balance. And they rate the tannic wines 
as those worth holding onto. 
</P>
<P>
This, I contend, is the reverse of what it should be. Balance pays dividends; 
bigness rarely does. (As proof, I challenge any of those who still revere the 
overblown 1980 and 1982 Cabernets to taste them side-by-side with the elegant 
1981s. Simpler proof: Taste any 20-year-old Louis Martini red wine.) 
</P>
<P>
Yet I see a ray of hope, and it is in wine that is not all -- or not even 
mostly -- Cabernet Sauvignon. It is in the premium blended red wines that have 
boomed in the market in the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A More Complete Cabernet 
</P>
<P>
The blended premium wine came about not because of concerns about tannin. It 
came about because wine makers realized that by blending in some of the cousin 
grape varieties that also come from Bordeaux, such as Merlot, Cabernet Franc, 
Malbec and Petite Verdot, they could make a more complete Cabernet, a wine with 
more depth of flavor and complexity. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, they spent more time worrying about whether that complexity would 
show, and to make sure it did, they began fining and filtering the wine to make 
it more silky. This stripped away the rough tannins, leaving behind only the 
softer tannins that help the wine age. 
</P>
<P>
The first such silky blended wine was the 1979 Opus One, the first vintage of 
the joint venture between the Robert Mondavi Winery and France's Chateau 
Mouton-Rothschild. It was the first super-premium blended red wine to accent 
lower tannins, a bold stroke, not to mention a great wine. 
</P>
<P>
Each succeeding Opus One has been lean and delicate, more refined than 
Mondavi's own Cabernet Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
And Opus One is more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Before long, Lyeth in Geyserville began making a red wine, blended from the 
classic Bordeaux varieties, that was relatively less tannic than it could have 
been. And others began to hone their blended wines. Then two months ago, an 
association of these wineries, called the Meritage Assn., was formed to give a 
name to this type of blended wine. 
</P>
<P>
The one wine that seems not to fit the pattern is Dominus, a joint venture of 
the John Daniel Society in the Napa Valley and Christian Moeuix of Chateau 
Petrus fame. The first release of Dominus, from the 1984 vintage, was fairly 
tannic. It's a wine I don't expect to age gracefully. The soon-to-be-released 
1985 is a bit better, but still pretty tannic. (It does have better fruit than 
the '84, a big plus.) 
</P>
<P>
I suspect that the regime used to make Dominus is similar in some ways to the 
methods used to make Chateau Petrus. The wines appear to have similar structure 
when young. 
</P>
<P>
Two more super-premium blended wines are soon to hit the market, and both are 
structured with less tannin. In fact, one of the best Meritage wines I have 
ever tasted is the 1985 Cain Five from Cain Cellars, high atop the Napa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The wine is spectacular, combining marvelous blackberry and violet flavors with 
notes of toasty oak and a long, pleasing finish. What's most noticeable about 
this wine is that the aftertaste isn't terribly tannic. Higher acidity and 
perfect balance should help it age a long time. 
</P>
<P>
The blend is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, with small amounts of Merlot, Cabernet 
Franc, Malbec and Petite Verdot blended in. (The "Five" in the title refers to 
the number of varieties used in the blend, and to keep the theme going, Cain 
will release this wine only in five-bottle wooden cases on the fifth day of the 
fifth month of the year.) 
</P>
<P>
A second new Meritage wine, from Hacienda in Sonoma Valley, is called Antares. 
Named after the red star that is the brightest in the Southern Hemisphere, 
Antares is composed of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Cabernet Franc and 15% 
Merlot. It has a cherry and cedar aroma and deep, rich, fairly dry flavors. 
Again, the tannins are not excessive. 
</P>
<P>
Cain Five is a marvel of fining skill. I tasted the wine 18 months ago when it 
was still in barrels, and its tannin level was so high I didn't give it much 
hope. But wine maker Lester Hardy said he worked hard to not only trim the 
tannins out but to find the best blend of lots. 
</P>
<P>
He said that occasionally, two lots of wine that are fairly tannic on their own 
can actually make a smoother wine when they are blended, sort of like matching 
up the two rough edges of a jigsaw puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
As for Antares, Hacienda didn't intend to make it. Winery owner Crawford Cooley 
said it was a product of wine maker Eric Lauman's imagination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Over a Barrel 
</P>
<P>
"One day, Eric came up to the office and said: 'We've got some barrels that are 
very interesting, and I think if we handled them separately, we could make a 
very fine wine.' But we also knew it was going to be an expensive wine, because 
we had to buy new French oak barrels, and we're using a high-shouldered bottle, 
and each bottle will be tissue-paper-wrapped." It will be released in 
six-bottle boxes, mainly in California. 
</P>
<P>
The new 1985 Flora Springs Trilogy is another superb wine. Trilogy is a 
one-third blend of each of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot. 
</P>
<P>
The '85 Trilogy is an amazingly complex wine with a cherry-like tone, a hint of 
dusty/toasty elements from oak aging, and extremely refined, in the manner of a 
classic Bordeaux. It is smoother than the '84 Trilogy, a tribute to wine maker 
Ken Deis' fining ability. 
</P>
<P>
The 1985 Opus One, to finish the analogy, is the best Opus One to date. It is 
loaded with fruit, but as is the house style, the wine is restrained and has a 
finely honed tannin structure for long aging. 
</P>
<P>
Meritage wines are not cheap. Opus One is $50, for example (though it hasn't 
increased in price since the first vintage, 1979). Trilogy is $35. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that Cain Five is $26, one of the lowest-priced Meritage 
wines; Antares is only $28, even though only 181 cases were produced. 
</P>
<P>
From this discussion, one might guess there's something wrong with varietal 
wines on their own. Of course, this isn't true. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan Winery in Alexander Valley proved that with a string of successful 
Cabernet Sauvignons that rarely are very tannic, yet appear to have a wide 
following, especially in restaurants. The reason is obvious: You can drink 
Jordan Cabernets younger than many other wines, but they appear to age as well 
as their more-tannic brethren. 
</P>
<P>
Recently I tasted the 1986 Arrowood Cabernet Sauvignon and the 1986 Ferrari 
Carano Merlot. Both are sensational varietal wines that offer less tannin than 
I might have seen in past years. 
</P>
<P>
The Arrowood ($19) has a huge amount of fruit (more cassis and black cherry 
than anything) and amazing length in the finish, a wine that has some 
noticeable tannin but is held well in check by the balance. 
</P>
<P>
The Ferrari Carano ($14.50) offers an intriguing fresh tarragon, spice and 
cedar aroma and classic silkiness in the finish; it's a marvel of balance. 
</P>
<P>
Wine of the Week: 1987 Franciscan Oakville Chardonnay ($11): Slight tropical 
fruit and citrus tones are filled out with toasty, oaky notes and a creaminess 
rarely found in wines of this price.

MICROWAVE . . .: GUIDELINES FOR SOUFFLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN ANDERSON and ELAINE HANNA, Anderson and Hanna are nutritionists and 
cookbook authors specializing in microwave cookery. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's been plenty of discussion about whether you can -- or cannot -- 
microwave souffles successfully. We say you can, and we've got the recipe to 
prove it. 
</P>
<P>
Microwave souffles may not rise as high as those made the old time way, but 
they will puff about three-fourths of an inch above the rim of the souffle dish 
and won't collapse the instant they come from the oven. 
</P>
<P>
Microwaved souffles don't brown, it's true. But they are exquisitely moist and 
velvety; and with an appropriate sauce, they are superb. For perfect microwave 
souffles, read -- and abide by -- these guidelines: 
</P>
<P>
1. Follow the recipe exactly. Although you can safely substitute one herb for 
another, never change the basic proportions of butter, flour, liquid, egg and 
principal flavoring (cheese, fish, chicken, for example). 
</P>
<P>
2. For a slightly more stable souffle, use evaporated milk in place of light 
cream. 
</P>
<P>
3. To stabilize egg whites and make them climb to greater heights, beat them 
with a bit of cream of tartar. 
</P>
<P>
4. For a more evenly risen, evenly cooked souffle, use an ungreased 
straight-sided, microwave-safe souffle dish in the size specified, never one 
larger or smaller. Also, smooth the surface of the souffle batter lightly; 
peaks will only dry during microwaving. Finally, use a turntable. It eliminates 
the need to rotate the souffle frequently and gives it a professional look. A 
turntable can sometimes speed cooking as much as two to three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
5. For maximum volume, microwave a souffle uncovered. The top will dry faster, 
too -- a definite plus. 
</P>
<P>
6. To allow a souffle to rise slowly and evenly and to keep its edges from 
overcooking before the center is done, microwave on MEDIUM-LOW or DEFROST.

THE BUTCHER: GENETICS TENDERIZES TOUGH EYE OF ROUND INTO A DIFFERENT BREED OF 
CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MERLE ELLIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At one time in this country, as recently as 20 years or so, three or four 
breeds of cattle provided us with some of the best beef in the world. 
</P>
<P>
The English breeds, Hereford, Angus and Shorthorn, were the cattle that made us 
a nation of beef eaters. They were small cattle by today's standards, and slow 
to reach marketable weights. But they were giants in providing top-quality meat 
with the rich beefy flavor that comes from a more mature animal. 
</P>
<P>
Today, there are 74 breeds of beef animals registered in the United States, 
many of them giants in size. Some of the new European breeds reach marketable 
weights even before they reach maturity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Where's the Beef? 
</P>
<P>
They are babies, barely more than veal, when they become meat for tables. As a 
result, they don't have the rich beefy flavor of a more mature animal. In my 
opinion that is why it is getting harder and harder to find a great steak. But, 
at the same time and for the same reason, beef today is leaner and generally 
more tender than the beef of 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In my opinion the cut of beef has gained more as a result of today's beef 
cattle genetics and crossbreeding than the eye-of-round. Once a tough cut that 
required long, slow cooking to make it even much more tender than the sole of a 
boot, it is now a different breed of cut. 
</P>
<P>
The eye-of-round is one of the four muscles of the beef round (the hind leg of 
the beef animal). It is not now, nor has it ever been, one of the most tender 
muscles of the animal, but from today's larger, younger beef cattle, it is far 
more tender than it was from yesterday's more mature animals. Cuts that a 
generation ago required three and four hours of cooking can be done in a third 
of the time or less. 
</P>
<P>
You will often find eye-of-round in the steak section of the supermarket meat 
case cut thin and labeled "breakfast steak" or "sandwich steak," but that's not 
the place to buy it. Go to the roast section and buy an eye-of-round roast. It 
will almost certainly cost you less per pound and you can easily slice your own 
thin steaks for breakfast or sandwiches, although those are not the best uses 
for eye-of-round. Tender though it now is, it is still not really tender enough 
to be fried or grilled with much success. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family Favorites 
</P>
<P>
The following recipes are family favorites. They have been for years, but they 
have been updated to take into account the new breed of eye-of-round. 
</P>
<P>
Boliche Relleno is a specialty of the house at the Columbia Restaurant in the 
heart of Old Tampa's Latin Quarter. I got the original recipe from Cesar 
Gonzmart, fourth-generation proprietor of the Columbia, more than 10 years ago. 
The recipe has been changed some over the years for two reasons: The first is 
to simplify it a bit; I don't have the staff in my kitchen that Cesar has in 
his. The second is to shorten the cooking time. Today's eye-of-round does not 
need the 3 1/2- to 4-hour cooking time called for in Cesar's 
great-great-greatgrandma's recipe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BOLICHE RELLENO 
</P>
<P>
1 (approximately 2-pound ) eye-of-round roast 
</P>
<P>
1 piece Chorizo or smoked sausage approximately 1 inch in diameter and as long 
as eye-of-round 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon black pepper 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon paprika 
</P>
<P>
2 strips bacon, diced 
</P>
<P>
1 large onion, chopped 
</P>
<P>
1 large green pepper, chopped 
</P>
<P>
4 cloves garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon dried oregano 
</P>
<P>
4 bay leaves 
</P>
<P>
2 cups beef broth 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup cold water 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon flour 
</P>
<P>
Cooked black beans and rice 
</P>
<P>
With blade of long, thin carving knife, pierce hole through length of roast by 
first inserting blade through meat horizontally, then vertically to make cross 
cut. Be careful to keep as much to middle of meat as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Carefully insert sausage into eye-of-round by starting at one end of roast and 
gently pushing sausage into meat, turning from side to side as necessary. 
Combine salt, pepper and paprika and rub mixture well into all sides of meat. 
</P>
<P>
Fry bacon in heavy Dutch oven to render couple tablespoons of fat. Brown 
Boliche well on all sides in hot fat. Lightly saute onion and green pepper in 
same pan. Add garlic, oregano, bay leaves and beef broth. Return roast to pan, 
cover and roast at 325 degrees 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Remove roast from pan. Strain pan juices into saucepan. Mix water and flour, 
stir into pan juices. Cook, stirring, over medium heat until thickened 
slightly. 
</P>
<P>
Slice Boliche into thin slices and spoon sauce over. Serve with black beans and 
rice. Makes 4 to 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: If time permits, place sausage in freezer for 1 hour to firm before 
inserting into meat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LEON'S MAMA'S GRILLADS 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 to 2 pounds beef eye-of-round 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons salt 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon black pepper 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 
</P>
<P>
4 to 5 cloves garlic, very finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
Flour 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons butter 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon oil 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups chopped onions 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup finely chopped celery 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup finely chopped green pepper 
</P>
<P>
1 (16-ounce) can tomatoes, chopped 
</P>
<P>
1 1/4 cups beef broth 
</P>
<P>
Cooked grits or rice pilaf 
</P>
<P>
Cut eye-of-round into 1-inch-thick slices. Mix together salt, black and cayenne 
peppers and chopped garlic. Sprinkle spice mix over both sides of beef pieces 
and press in well with fingers. 
</P>
<P>
Coat each piece well on both sides with flour and, with edge of plate or meat 
tenderizer, pound flour well into meat. Each piece should end up about 1/2-inch 
thick. After meat is pounded, dip once again in flour and shake off any excess. 
</P>
<P>
Place butter and oil in heavy Dutch oven and brown grillads on both sides. 
Remove to platter and set aside. Add onions, celery and green pepper to pot and 
cook, stirring, 3 to 4 minutes or until vegetables are tender. Return meat to 
pot, add tomatoes and beef broth. Cover and simmer 30 minutes. Serve with grits 
or rice pilaf. Makes 4 to 6 servings.

JOSEPH N. BELL: ANY PROFIT MUST BE MEASURED BY LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I wish newspapers would stop running stories about Orange County housing costs 
being the highest in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
I live in a modest house in a modest neighborhood. But in Orange County in 
1989, any house is worth a king's ransom, and when I'm reminded of that, it 
always sets me speculating about what I could do with all that money. 
</P>
<P>
It would be suicidal, of course, to sell our house if my wife, my stepson and I 
planned to stay in Orange County, because we'd simply be making a lateral move 
-- or worse. But frequently these housing stories list prices in other cities 
-- and that's where my fantasies start. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of weeks ago, for example, I learned that if we sold our house in 
Santa Ana Heights at the going rate, we could buy 2 1/2 comparable or better 
houses in Victorville, Fresno or Bakersfield, 2 houses in Sacramento and 1 1/2 
houses in Riverside or San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
But the thought of moving anywhere else in California -- except San Francisco, 
which is the only place as expensive as Orange County -- is depressing. Even as 
the richest kid on the block, I don't think I could cut it in Fresno or 
Bakersfield, because Orange County would still be just down the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
So my fantasies take me farther away. For the price we could get from our 
current house, we could buy three houses in Toledo, Ohio; Grand Rapids, Mich.; 
Wichita, Kan., or Des Moines, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
I've been to all of those places and know some of them rather well. I've also 
lived in comparable cities a considerable part of my life. So I know what the 
residue from selling our house would buy there. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, we could pay cash. No mortgage. No monthly payments for housing. 
We could probably live in one of the better residential areas and even join the 
country club. Everything would be close by, traffic problems would be minimal, 
services cheaper and better, air quality cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
We would spend much less of our time getting from here to there, and tension 
would be commensurately reduced. 
</P>
<P>
The pace would be slower, the life style less demanding. We wouldn't be 
entirely cut off from cultural events, because all of these towns are either 
close enough to a major city or large enough themselves to support some such 
things. 
</P>
<P>
From a distance, these advantages can seem pretty gauzy and seductive. But. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
First, there's the weather. I've done my time in cold climates. I've heard 
natives of northern states -- usually people who are stuck there -- say life 
without drastic changes in season would be unbearably monotonous. I don't try 
to tell them anymore that we really do have changes in season in Orange County. 
I just tell them that's the kind of monotony I like. 
</P>
<P>
The outdoor life style we enjoy here because of our weather is something I 
would find exceedingly difficult to give up. 
</P>
<P>
Then, of course, there's the ocean: Even if I don't visit often, it's always 
there. So are the mountains and the desert -- when we can fight our way through 
freeway traffic to reach them. 
</P>
<P>
My stepson would find schools as good or better in these faraway towns and 
would probably adapt readily to the change. And I can write anywhere. But my 
wife would be forced to give up a good job for something probably considerably 
less satisfying and certainly less remunerative. 
</P>
<P>
There would be no major league baseball or concerts or professional theater 
close by. And the reduction of tension theoretically resulting from a slower, 
less demanding life style would be a mixed blessing. I know; I've been there. 
The dynamics of life are simply very different, and those of us who find our 
juices stirred by all the excesses of Orange County -- social, political, 
philosophical and geographic -- would find a new kind of tension to deal with: 
the tension of looking for action that isn't readily at hand. 
</P>
<P>
That wouldn't be a drawback to everyone, but it is to me. The knowledge that on 
any given day I have all sorts of options open to me that grow out of the 
climate, the natural resources, the people, the universities, the recreational 
facilities of Orange County hones my senses and sharpens my energies. 
</P>
<P>
Take a look sometime at the difference between older people in Orange County 
and those in virtually any other place in the world, and you'll get a real 
sense of what this vibrancy can mean. 
</P>
<P>
So I'm going to try to stop reading those housing stories and then fantasizing 
moves I know I won't make -- at least not the way I feel today. 
</P>
<P>
If I deny myself the dreams, then about all my inflated housing price means is 
higher taxes. But that's OK. I've got a tennis game now. I'll think about taxes 
later.

ANN CONWAY: FINE LITTLE ART CATCHES EYE AT BENEFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ANN CONWAY

<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Tierney dubbed them "the only affordable housing in Orange County" at 
Tiffany &amp; Co. in South Coast Plaza on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Tierney was talking about the homey sculptures of Gifford Myers, creator of the 
Multiple Listings collection, some of which were on exhibit at the jewelry 
store's benefit for the Fine Arts Gallery at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Myers' ceramic works -- displayed in built-in wall cases -- received almost as 
much attention as Tiffany's heart-stopping trinkets. One piece in particular, 
"Hold Out/Holding On," got a lion's share of stares from guests. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about the little guy," said Myers, peering into the showcase at the 
teensy house he had sandwiched between two skyscrapers. "He's been offered over 
a million bucks for his property, but money has no meaning to him. Emotional 
value does. So he says: 'Let them build on either side. The hell with you guys. 
We're going to hold out!' " His sculptures are priced from $3,500 to $5,000, 
said Myers, who teaches art at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the Fine Arts Gallery gathered at 6:30 p.m. to be wined and dined 
and, along with Myers' works, enjoy the whimsical displays of artist Gene 
Moore, master window designer for Tiffany &amp; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
(It was Moore who did the windows for the movie "Breakfast at Tiffany's." "We 
filled them with miniature chandeliers. They were beautiful," said Moore, who 
noted that he saw Audrey Hepburn recently.) 
</P>
<P>
Among the guests was UC Irvine Chancellor Jack W. Peltason, attending with his 
wife, Suzanne, and their daughter, Nancy Elliott. "The art gallery is a gem," 
he said. "It's especially appropriate for the campus since it involves 
teachers, students, audiences and continuing discussion about what goes on. 
It's a hidden treasure that is becoming less hidden." 
</P>
<P>
For the gallery's director, Melinda Wortz, it's a place to spotlight 
"cutting-edge art." On Wortz's dream list: a gallery large enough to display 
California light and space sculptors, such as Robert Irwin, Larry Bell and 
Bruce Nauman. 
</P>
<P>
"Giuseppe Ponza of Milan, Italy, is a collector of these artists," said Wortz, 
an avid art collector who has known Ponza for several years. "Our goal is to 
accommodate his collection." 
</P>
<P>
Renee Segerstrom was honorary chairwoman of the benefit, which raised more than 
$8,000. 
</P>
<P>
Red hot: He plays it cool on the podium, but he sure knows how to heat up a 
party. 
</P>
<P>
Having mixed with music lovers at the Center Club after his performance with 
the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra on Saturday, Zubin Mehta sat down to dine. 
</P>
<P>
While his table partners watched with fascination (and uttered nary a word), 
the dashing maestro brought forth a tiny gold filigree box from deep inside his 
coat pocket. 
</P>
<P>
Delicately, he opened it and produced two of the skinniest objects this side of 
a pair of chopsticks. Placing the red peppers on his plate, he minced them, 
then folded the flecks into his spinach crepes and saucy chicken. 
</P>
<P>
What was it all about? No one dared ask. But one Mehta-watcher ventured a 
guess. "I figure since he is Indian, he must love spicy food," said Erich 
Vollmer, executive director of the Orange County Philharmonic Society. (The 
society co-sponsored the champagne and petit buffet with the Orange County 
chapter of the American Jewish Committee.) 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the evening, Mehta -- whose appearance at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center marked his first since he starred at its opening -- had 
received a nod from Lewis Janowsky, vice president of the local committee. But 
first, Mehta had told the arts-loving crowd that he felt uncomfortable about 
receiving the International Cultural Diplomacy Award. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't deserve this," he said. "What I've given of my artistry to the 
state of Israel, the state has given me back a hundred times. 
</P>
<P>
"I have just come from a month of concerts there. We try to show the world that 
there is a side of Israel other than the one we read about on the front pages 
of world newspapers. And it is our fervent wish that Israel will once and for 
all be wiped off the front pages, or exist there only for cultural and 
scientific reasons. Because in cultural and scientific areas, Israel is on par 
with everyone else in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Life is a stage: Talk about a soft sell. It was fizzy champagne and snazzy 
canapes for members of the Theatre Guild of South Coast Repertory on Saturday 
when they gathered to raise money at I. Magnin at South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Rubbing elbows in the tony department store's Miss Magnin and Fine Apparel 
departments, guests got to ogle the latest in daytime wear while they ogled 
each other in the latest in cocktail wear. (For benefit committee members, 
spangled, ruffled and poufed knits by St. John were the hands-down favorites.) 
</P>
<P>
But the soft sell had as much to do with what's new for spring as it had to do 
with marketing Magnin. Chiffon scarfs are what's triple hot in accessories, 
said Noddie Weltner, special events coordinator for I. Magnin's southern 
region. 
</P>
<P>
"The chiffon scarf is the accessory item," she noted. "And you can wear it with 
anything -- a suit, a blouse and skirt . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
And you can drape it several ways: around your neck, over your shoulder, even 
around your waist. "It's really new to tie a scarf around your head and throw 
on a pair of shades," Weltner said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sunglasses are another important accessory this season. There are the kind you 
hide behind, and there are the kind you buy to make a fashion statement." 
</P>
<P>
After yummies, guests rode the escalators to watch a first-floor fashion show 
that featured the spring silhouettes of such designers as Claude Montana, 
Geoffrey Beene and Bill Blass, a favorite of the First Lady (as if you didn't 
know). 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds were estimated at $5,000. Rosemary Sieve is Guild president. Catherine 
Steisel and Donna Gaglia were co-chairwomen.

HABERDASHERY AFFAIR PASSES HAT FOR CHARITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

When you've got an award for "Most Likely to Bid for an Evening With Dan Quayle 
to Swap War Stories," who but Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, Orange County's own 
up-and-coming boyish Republican, would even be considered? 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez was one of the high-powered models to receive awards at last Thursday's 
10th Annual Gentlemen's Haberdashery Luncheon at the Irvine Hilton &amp; 
Towers, sponsored by fellow Supervisor Thomas F. Riley. 
</P>
<P>
The off-the-wall awards, chosen by a panel of female judges, also included such 
distinctions as "Most Likely to Get a Date at the Bachelor Bid," won by Joseph 
D'Ambrosio, vice president of American Airlines' Western Division; "Most Likely 
to Commute in a Helicopter Complete With Phone and Fax," awarded to Alan 
Cummins of Shapell Industries Inc., and "Most Likely to Buy a Lifetime 
Membership From Tans R Us," which went to George O'Connell of O'Connell 
Landscape Maintenance and Bill Harris of Rampart General. 
</P>
<P>
The luncheon itself fell into the most-likely-to-succeed category, having 
raised about $100,000 to benefit the Heart of Jesus Retreat Center operated by 
the Sisters of the Society Devoted to the Sacred Heart in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the more than 700 guests who paid $100 each to attend the 
luncheon, 31 people also contributed $1,000 each to join the center's Heart of 
Gold Club. 
</P>
<P>
"There's something very magical about these nuns," Riley told the gathering. 
"You can tell that God's hand is on their shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
The retreat center is the only such facility for children in Southern 
California, according to Sister Susan Blaschke, one of 47 members of the order. 
About 5,000 Catholic children from public, private and parochial schools visit 
the center each year, she said. The center is also used for religious programs 
by Catholic and non-Catholic groups. 
</P>
<P>
"We want children to know that when they hear the name Prince, that's not only 
a seductive rock star but the Prince of Peace," said Sister Jane Stafford, the 
order's Superior General. "We want them to know that Madonna is not just a teen 
idol, and that Jesus is not just a word you use at the end of a joke or the 
beginning of an argument. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an uphill struggle, because we're offering them an invisible reality in a 
very physical, proof-giving society," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The luncheon began a decade ago, the brainchild of Riley's wife, Emma Jane. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to have to beg guys to be in the fashion show," said Anthony Moiso, 
president of the Santa Margarita Co. and one of the people involved from the 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"This year we tried to keep it to 50 (models), but we ended up with 66," Riley 
said. "And we turned away 100." 
</P>
<P>
There were a few cutups among those who made the cut, including Orange County 
Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates, who was dressed as a marshal from the Wild West; 
Harbor Municipal Court Judge Calvin P. Schmidt, who walked down the ramp in a 
clown costume, carrying the suit he was "modeling" on a hanger, and priests 
Kenneth A. Schmidt and Michael Harris, who appeared in surfer attire and were 
dubbed "our favorite unwed fathers" by show coordinator Kitty Leslie of Fashion 
Island, who served as commentator along with announcer Paul Salata. 
</P>
<P>
Other models included hamburger mogul Carl Karcher, Supervisor Don R. Roth, 
Orange County Republican Party Chairman Thomas A. Fuentes, former Supervisor 
Ralph Clark, Tom Nielsen, Richard O'Neill, Gilbert Aguirre, Terrance Barry, Jim 
Dale, John Crean, Thomas Malcolm, Peter Muth, Stanley Pawlowski, Tim Strader, 
William D. Lusk, Ernie Vitucci and Bill Yacobozzi.

SPOUSAL ABUSE: DO RESTRAINING ORDERS HELP? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the volatile, real-life world of family violence, there are happy endings 
and sad endings after one spouse gets a restraining order against the other. 
</P>
<P>
Scott McGuire credits his wife's decision to get an order against him with 
awakening him to the seriousness of his plight. He did not violate the order 
that was granted last year, and he and his wife say they believe their marriage 
now is back on track. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Melendez was not so lucky. Last month, she got a restraining order 
against her husband, Carlos. The order forbade him to come near her residence 
or the motel where she worked. 
</P>
<P>
But on Feb. 13, only 10 days after the order was made final, Carlos Melendez, 
armed with a revolver, went to the motel near Anaheim Stadium where his wife 
was a night desk clerk, engaged her in a brief argument and then fatally shot 
her. He then shot himself to death, leaving three orphaned children. 
</P>
<P>
The news was particularly devastating to a group of employees in the county 
courthouse who work for the private, nonprofit Community Services Program. They 
help women fill out the cumbersome forms for restraining orders and had worked 
with Sandra Melendez. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime you've had contact with someone where something tragic happened, 
you're going to feel it a bit more even if it's not someone you're personally 
acquainted with," said Maxine Rutkowski, a supervisor in the Domestic Violence 
Assistance Program of the Community Services Program. 
</P>
<P>
"When you know they've come into the office, you kind of feel, 'Was there 
something more we could have done?' Even when you think back and think you had 
done everything possible, you wonder if maybe there wasn't something more you 
could have done. You just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
For those like Carlos Melendez who are intent on mayhem, restraining orders are 
not worth the paper they're printed on. But the overwhelming consensus of 
people who work in the domestic violence field is that restraining orders are 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
"We still live in a society where most people are law-abiding," said Jan Shaw, 
director of mediation and investigative services for the Orange County Superior 
Court. "It's unfortunate that we don't live in a society where everyone is. But 
the fact that the court has intervened in the affairs of a family seems to make 
the batterer realize that this isn't something society accepts or condones." 
</P>
<P>
While domestic violence is a felony, violating a restraining order is a 
misdemeanor. Since that may mean little or no jail time, some experts are 
lukewarm about the impact of such an order. 
</P>
<P>
"I have mixed feelings about the orders," said Mary Walton, executive director 
of the Interval House shelter in west Orange County. "It gives the woman a 
sense that she's able to do something to protect herself. There was a time when 
it was the only thing she could do. Until there is a consistent first response 
and arrest for family violence, then a restraining order is valuable as the 
next best thing we have. But so far in our society, and that filters down to 
our county, the notion of arrest being the first response has not caught on." 
</P>
<P>
Figures provided by the Orange County Commission on the Status of Women support 
her theory. Of more than 10,000 domestic violence calls reported by police 
departments in 1987, only 209 resulted in arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Police departments over the years have made no secret of their dislike for 
handling domestic violence calls. "You can take a Caspar Milquetoast and given 
stimulus about family, money, children -- it brings out the worst in people," 
said Orange Police Sgt. Timm Browne. "I've been doing this job for 18 years and 
from the day I started, this has been the biggest problem -- you just don't 
like to handle family fights, because everybody's got their emotions up front. 
There are no fuses, just buttons." 
</P>
<P>
Complicating matters for police are the combatants themselves. Many times, 
police will be called to a family fight, only to have the abused spouse 
suddenly join forces with the other after officers attempt to arrest or subdue 
the abuser. 
</P>
<P>
That same pattern can interfere with the intent of the restraining orders. "The 
thing you have to understand about family violence is that a woman will 
separate six or seven times before she finally separates from him for the final 
time," according to Jan Shaw. "So what will happen is, she'll come in and 
obtain the restraining order, which is good for 3 years, and during that time 
there will be all these reconciliations and it ends up defeating the original 
intent of the order." 
</P>
<P>
Because restraining orders require filling out a lot of paper work and 
documenting past cases of abuse, some people need help with the forms. Since 
1982, the Victim Assistance Center in the county courthouse has provided that 
kind of assistance. In the most recent full year of record-keeping, more than 
2,300 people have sought help for family violence situations. 
</P>
<P>
While murderous assaults such as that of Carlos Melendez make people wary of 
the value of restraining orders, experts say that is a misleading impression. 
</P>
<P>
"Like all of us, abusers come from all walks of life, all educational levels, 
all philosophies," said Barbara Clippinger, program director at the Women's 
Transitional Living Center shelter in north Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"Some are very law-abiding citizens who have a cultural or social or family 
belief system that says they have the right to beat their wife, but they still 
follow the other rules of society, with that exception. Most of the abusers 
would be looked at by their neighbors as regular guys, pleasant people to be 
with, socially acceptable. Their rage is usually kept within the confines of 
the home."

ONLY INJURIES CAN STOP PINT-SIZED POOKEY, AND THEY HAVE 
</P>

<P>
Nine days earlier he had undergone surgery on his right knee for the third 
time. And there wasn't much cartilage left in the knee, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
So it was no surprise that Pookey Wigington out of Morningside High didn't make 
the trip from New Jersey two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Wigington's Seton Hall University basketball team was in town to play 
Providence College in Rhode Island, and the Hall prevailed, 80-68, in a Big 
East Conference skirmish. The Pirates could have used Wigington off the bench 
but weren't hurt without him. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at it this way," Wigington says. "When I get back, every game is gonna 
be my game." 
</P>
<P>
Tall players would glance at his 5-3 frame and snicker. But he'd show them. "I 
was really quick. I could go by anyone," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
And he still can. Until the pain gets in his way. 
</P>
<P>
It hit a few months after Wigington graduated from Morningside High School in 
1984. He tore cartilage while playing for Midland, Texas, junior college, and 
some of the damaged tissue had to be removed. 
</P>
<P>
He sat out a year, hoping his problems would go away. And for a while, they 
did. 
</P>
<P>
Wigington moved on to Ventura College in 1986 and averaged 11 points, 8.3 
assists and 5.4 steals. His knee started acting up toward the end of the season 
but not enough to stop him from claiming Most Valuable Player honors in 
California's JC postseason tournament. Seton Hall grabbed him and said he would 
start. So he wasn't worried. 
</P>
<P>
Before he left for New Jersey, he played in a summer league at Morningside 
without much pain. But someone stepped on his foot, prompting him to wrench his 
knee again; he figured it was a minor twist. 
</P>
<P>
By September, however, he was back in surgery, this time to remove most of the 
cartilage on the damaged side of the joint. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me it was so crushed and torn that they had to remove it. All I 
could do was try to understand, but I was really hurt," Wigington recalls. "I 
knew I would never play up to my capabilities again." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors opened Wigington's knee a third time in February to remove torn 
cartilage from the other side of the joint. Some grinding of bones has resulted 
with so little cartilage left. "Early arthritic changes" now are occurring in 
Wigington's knee, according to his doctor, Gary Gallick. And that means more 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
Ask Wigington if his statistics at Seton Hall (1.7 points, 1.9 assists and 8.7 
minutes a game this season) are low mostly because of his injury, and he says: 
"Not mostly. Only." 
</P>
<P>
Wigington acknowledges that it wouldn't be fair for him to start since he has 
practiced only about 20 times. His role now is to spell point guard Gerald 
Greene. "We definitely miss him," says shooting guard John Morton. 
</P>
<P>
But not as much as Wigington misses the game. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first came to Seton Hall, I felt it was gonna be my program and my 
show," Wigington says. "I looked forward to playing all the guards in the 
conference. I felt like I was better or just as good. I just wanted to prove 
it. Without the injury, I think I would have been a totally different player. 
But I guess it wasn't meant to be." 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall made its first-ever trip to the NCAA tournament in Wigington's first 
season when he averaged 1.7 points and 1.7 assists in 31 games and committed 
only one turnover in 21 minutes as the Pirates upended Georgetown in the Big 
East tournament. He also was named MVP of this season's Great Alaska Shootout. 
</P>
<P>
And Seton Hall received another NCAA bid, partly because of Pookey. The Pirates 
play Indiana Thursday in a third round game at Denver, and Pookey is hoping for 
playing time. He played in each of Seton Hall's first two wins. "In two years, 
he's been taken advantage of twice," says Seton Hall Coach P. J. Carlesimo. "By 
Charles Smith (of Georgetown) and Sherman Douglas (of Syracuse). His size 
creates more problems for others than for us. He is a big-time player, no 
question, and there is no way of telling how effective he could be without the 
injury. People just don't understand how his knee has limited him." 
</P>
<P>
Others probably wonder how Wigington, shortest player in the Big East, 
overcomes his lack of height. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Ventura Coach Phil Matthews didn't think Wigington could play even 
junior college ball, and who could blame him? Wigington had not played in a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"When I met him, his height was an issue," says Matthews. "I told him he 
couldn't play for me, and he said he could. We went round and round, and he 
won." 
</P>
<P>
Wigington made Matthews a believer two days into practice. Now they chat at 
least once a week. And how does Matthews feel about budding Pookeys? "I don't 
care how big they are," he says. "If they can play, they can play." 
</P>
<P>
There have been other converts, too. 
</P>
<P>
Wigington went to elementary school in South Central Los Angeles and most of 
his friends were Crip gang members. When he moved to a Blood neighborhood in 
Inglewood, he had trouble. "You tended to use Crip slang back then," he 
remembers, "and when I moved to Inglewood, some guys didn't like me and some 
guys wanted to jump me." 
</P>
<P>
Basketball arbitrated the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
"My school didn't have a team, but when I went to play in PE, no one could stop 
me. The teacher formed a team because of me and they started to like me after 
that. They started to put me on a pedestal," Wigington says. 
</P>
<P>
Wigington was determined to prove he could play, so he went to many 
neighborhoods for a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
He laughs thinking about those times. "I went out expecting guys to try to take 
advantage of me, and I wanted to show them they couldn't. It was like I had a 
chip on my shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
Back in elementary school, Wigington's team scored about 39 points a game. He 
averaged 33. 
</P>
<P>
"No one else was allowed to shoot the ball," he recalls. "My coach used to say, 
'Get the ball to Leland.' I was the man." 
</P>
<P>
Leland. His real name. His father nicknamed him Pookey after a relative. It 
stuck. 
</P>
<P>
It's as big now as that of any of his high school peers. Wigington and Oval 
Miller, who played at Cal State Fullerton, led Morningside to a 25-4 record and 
a berth in the CIF 4-A semifinals in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
In high school and earlier Wigington also played against former St. Bernard 
standouts Corey Gaines, Eric Knox and Brian Williams. Gaines, who progressed to 
Loyola Marymount, is now with the New Jersey Nets. Wigington also joined Elden 
Campbell, another Morningside teammate now at Clemson, last summer as a member 
of the Nike/NIT All-Star team that compiled a 7-1 record in Soviet Union and 
Scandinavia. "They loved him there," says Ron Randle, Wigington's coach at 
Morningside. 
</P>
<P>
Now, it's as if the game has been taken from Wigington, along with the inside 
of his knee. 
</P>
<P>
He knows there are alternatives. "I realize that school has to be my key," says 
Wigington, a third-year accounting major. But he says he feels somewhat cheated 
by his knee problem. See, Wigington believes he once had a shot to become 
another Spud Webb or Muggsy Bogues, the tiny havoc-wreakers of the NBA. "I 
never really wished I was taller," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Just healthier.

Photo, Last Rites for Holy BooksAbout 500 worn-out Jewish prayerbooks were 
buried during a ceremony at the Eden Memorial Park WHERE IS THIS?? last week. 
Children and members of Temple Beth Am, 1039 La Cienega Blvd., gathered around 
the site, while Rabbi Harry Silverstein, left, and Howard Pilch, ritual vice 
president of the temple, delivered boxes of holy books to be buried. Jewish 
tradition forbids the books to be thrown away or burned because that would 
desecrate the name of God contained on their pages, said Rabbi Joel Rembaum, 
below, who led the group in prayer. Instead, the books must be kept in a 
storehouse or buried. "The same as human beings are shown respect when they die 
by returning them to the ground, so too a holy book must be shown respect," 
Rembaum said. Rafi Leib, 11, stood atop a mound of dirt to view the burial. 
Afterward, rabbinic intern Amy Wallk bottom left, directed children around the 
site. Also buried were worn-out prayer shawls and other religious objects.

'COLD WARRIORS' DRAW CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was with a feeling of revulsion that I read the article "Regrouping in the 
Cold War" (Times, March 16). 
</P>
<P>
My disgust was caused, not by Times Staff Writer Mike Ward's journalistic 
style, but by the subject. How depressing it is to be reminded that there are 
among us radical groups such as the John Birch Society, members of which 
continue to embrace McCarthyism. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the great majority of people in this country reject the kind of 
political depravity espoused by such organizations as the Birchers. The only 
redemption I find in the article is that I can offer it to my students as an 
example of what Samuel Johnson meant when he said: "Patriotism is the last 
refuge of the scoundrel."

COUNCIL IS 'BEST SHOW IN TOWN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite a stormy protest by residents of Monterey Park's Highlands 
neighborhood, the City Council has approved the sale of city land on the west 
side of the Long Beach Freeway to Los Angeles County for construction of a 
children's dependency court. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiations have been under way for two years, generally without the 
public's knowledge. The deal seemed to have been set between the city and the 
county by the time a hearing was held on March 13 at a City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Barry Hatch and other City Council members depicted themselves as sincere 
listeners. Opponents had a hero in Councilman Christopher Houseman, who was 
reluctant to join the deception. 
</P>
<P>
Each council member in turn expressed his or her compassion for abused children 
and took credit as the savior of these unfortunate children. The hard reality 
of dealing with the influx of over 1,000 disturbed people and other criminal 
elements each day to our small city was missing. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is full of humor, passion, warmth, flag-waving and good acting 
to make the meetings the best show in town. No admission charged.

<P>
TOUR BUS SCHEDULE OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tour bus operators and city officials have reached an informal agreement as 
part of a plan to eliminate traffic congestion from buses and passengers 
crowding city streets. 
</P>
<P>
City officials met with the half-dozen major tour bus companies that operate 
vacation tours originating in Monterey Park and traveling throughout the 
Southwest and California. 
</P>
<P>
The bus companies agreed to load and unload on off-street locations and to 
separate these spots as much as possible. The operators also agreed to have 
buses depart before 8:30 a.m. and to return to Monterey Park on staggered 
schedules. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem was that 10 to 12 buses would be in one place, loading up on a 
Saturday morning, blocking visibility and with pedestrians running all over the 
street to get to a bus," said Assistant City Manager Stan Soo-Hoo. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea was to address the problem and not overreact in a police kind of 
way." Bus operators last year complained that city officials had arbitrarily 
issued citations to buses that had allegedly committed zoning violations by 
improper parking on city streets.

PAROLE OFFICE PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Directors has decided to lodge a protest with Gov. George 
Deukmejian over the state's plan to put a parole office in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor William Thomson and Director Jess Hughston will deliver the city's 
objections to Sacramento and are expected to leave in the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Corrections recently began considering opening an 
office on Rosemead Boulevard near the Hastings Ranch neighborhood. Four other 
locations, which have not been made public, are also being considered. 
</P>
<P>
The new office will replace the one in Alhambra, which is scheduled to close in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 residents turned out Monday for a meeting with state officials. 
Residents said a parole office, serving about 1,000 parolees, would increase 
crime in the area.

PAY COMPROMISE SUGGESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state-appointed fact-finder, called in to mediate a contract dispute between 
the Mountain View School District and its teachers, has recommended giving the 
314 teachers a 4.5% pay increase retroactive to July. The recommendation is not 
binding on the school board, which will consider it at an April meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The district, which serves El Monte and South El Monte, has offered a 2.5% 
raise if the teachers agree to give up the right to 30 minutes of weekly class 
preparation time. The teachers have refused to give up the time and have 
demanded an 8.5% increase. 
</P>
<P>
Since school began in September, the dispute has become heated. Teachers' union 
representatives have accused Supt. Julian T. Lopez of being tightfisted in 
denying their pay request but lavish in spending at least $12,000 to redecorate 
his office since he took the post this year. Lopez, a nonsmoker, said the work 
was needed because the former superintendent was a heavy smoker.

PACT TO LEASE BUSES APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Foothill Transit Zone this week approved a $5.5-million lease agreement for 
30 new buses, which will allow the agency to add three lines in the San Gabriel 
Valley by mid-1989. 
</P>
<P>
The bus purchase, to be made on a lease-purchase option from Gillig Bus Co., 
will be underwritten by the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission. The 
commission gave approval in 1987 for Foothill to eventually take over service 
on 20 Southern California Rapid Transit District lines within three years. 
</P>
<P>
Since late last year, Foothill Transit buses have been doing standing-room-only 
service on two former RTD park-and-ride routes from the eastern San Gabriel 
Valley to downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
At the Monday meeting, the zone also approved a $75,294 annual contract with 
Foothill Executive Director William P. Forsythe, the county consultant who 
helped bring the zone into being. 
</P>
<P>
Trial is slated to begin in May in Los Angeles Superior Court on a lawsuit 
brought by RTD drivers and mechanics, challenging Foothill's existence. The 
union says Foothill Transit threatens RTD jobs and represents an illegal 
breakup of the massive transit operator.

$4.55 MINIMUM WAGE BILL SENT TO U.S. SENATE FOR OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The House passed legislation today to raise the hourly minimum wage to $4.55 
after rejecting President Bush's more modest offer of an increase to $4.25, 
sending the partisan battle to the Senate for another round next month. 
</P>
<P>
The vote was 248 to 171. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't enough but it certainly is better than nothing," House Speaker Jim 
Wright said of the legislation during a floor speech in favor of the Democrats' 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
Passage came after a 240-179 vote to amend the legislation to set the final 
level of the minimum wage at $4.55 an hour and add a provision allowing 
employers to pay new entrants in the job market a sub-minimum wage for two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Bush's proposal, offered by Republicans as a substitute for the 
Democrats' bill, was defeated 218 to 198, with more than 40 Democrats joining 
the GOP effort. 
</P>
<P>
"I see no defensible argument to say that is adequate," Rep. Augustus F. 
Hawkins (D-Los Angeles) said of Bush's offer of an hourly minimum wage of $4.25 
by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins was the sponsor of the Democratic bill, which originally called for the 
minimum wage to rise to $4.65 an hour by 1992. But he supported the amendment 
rolling back the final target by a dime while at the same time moving the 
effective dates of the increases forward, each by three months. 
</P>
<P>
Under the amendment, the first increase -- from $3.35 an hour now to $3.85 -- 
would take effect Oct. 1.

<P>
A machinery manufacturing plant in Anaheim was destroyed Wednesday night by a 
fire that started on the roof. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Fire Department spokesman Bob Young said no one was inside Rawley 
Machinery Inc. in the 1100 block of North Tustin Avenue when firefighters 
arrived shortly after 8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
It took 40 firefighters, who wore oxygen masks because of heavy smoke, about 
two hours to control the blaze in the 75-by-100-foot building. The fire caused 
$800,000 in damage, officials said. The cause is under investigation, Young 
said.

The power struggle between President Pieter W. Botha and the new leader of the 
National Party, F. W. de Klerk, has been resolved, and Botha will retire after 
an election later this year, a newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
"The fight is over," an unidentified government source told The Star, South 
Africa's largest-selling daily. The compromise was reached in a meeting 
Tuesday. Botha, 73, suffered a stroke Jan. 18 and spent eight weeks 
recuperating. He resigned as leader of the governing National Party on Feb. 2 
and was replaced by De Klerk.

FAA WARNS OF POSSIBLE HIJACK TRY IN EUROPE

<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration has warned U.S. airlines of a possible 
hijacking attempt by Palestinian terrorists in Europe, the U.S. Embassy and the 
FAA said today. 
</P>
<P>
But officials at the U.S. Embassy in London, the FAA and the White House denied 
a report today in the tabloid Daily Express that U.S. diplomats and military 
personnel had been notified of the warning. They also denied that the warning 
said the hijacking could occur over Easter weekend. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the U.S. European Command in Stuttgart, West Germany, said it 
was aware of the warning but did not pass it along to military personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The front-page Daily Express report came during a political debate in Britain 
over whether airlines were properly informed about a radio-cassette bomb before 
Pan Am Flight 103, a Boeing 747 bound for New York, was blown apart over 
Lockerbie in Scotland on Dec. 21, killing 270 people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater Comments 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater acknowledged today 
that the warning was issued March 16 and that it was "similar to many, many 
similar kinds of information and security bulletins that go out." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said that "it was not given to any military or diplomatic personnel 
but rather just to security experts at aviation airports and airlines." The 
notice did not mention any specific time period, such as Easter, Fitzwater 
said, nor did it mention a specific airline or airport.

Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger is outraged by "smart-alecky" 
journalists investigating activities of his international consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
He said Wednesday night that he resents insinuations of impropriety in work 
done by Kissinger Associates Inc., a New York firm he founded four years after 
leaving government service in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"Every smart-alecky newsman is asking my clients what I did for them, and I 
think it's an outrage," Kissinger said at a news conference before addressing 
an audience at a Jewish temple forum. 
</P>
<P>
"When we do not represent foreign governments, when we do not lobby in 
Washington, when we do not represent anybody in the United States government, 
what is the problem?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Newsweek magazine reported this week that Kissinger's firm sells access to 
powerful world figures to about 30 big-business clients and estimated it 
grosses more than $6 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Kissinger's former associates in the firm, Brent Scowcroft and Lawrence 
S. Eagleburger, are now serving in the Bush Administration, Scowcroft as 
national security adviser and Eagleburger as deputy secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
At his Senate confirmation hearings last week, Eagleburger declined to reveal 
publicly his clients or say what advice he had given. Eagleburger was president 
of Kissinger Associates.

A boy who tried to save his mother's life by offering a robber $4 listened 
helplessly from his bedroom as the man stabbed her to death, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
Joanna Woods, 39, was slain in her home Wednesday by a knife-wielding man who 
knocked on the door around 4 a.m. and forced his way in when she answered, 
investigators said. The intruder demanded money and started beating the woman. 
</P>
<P>
Her 12-year-old son told police he ran into the living room after hearing his 
mother scream, then went to his bedroom and got the only money he had and 
offered it to the man, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy told police that the man threw it on the floor and said, "I don't want 
that. I want some money." 
</P>
<P>
After begging for his mother's safety, the boy was ordered to his room by the 
intruder. The boy came out one more time and saw his mother being stabbed, 
officers said. When the man left, the boy called police. 
</P>
<P>
The dying woman used her last word to tell her son she loved him, investigators 
said.

Former First Lady Nancy Reagan has been suffering from "walking pneumonia" but

Mark Weinberg, spokesman for former President Ronald Reagan, said Mrs. Reagan, 
who has been recovering at home, is "feeling better." 
</P>

Weinberg added that the former First Lady has not had "10 minutes to catch her 
breath" since the Reagans left the White House and moved back to California in 
January. He said she had to unpack and move into their new Bel Air home and 
travel to New York to work on her book with biographer William Novak. The 
Reagans spent last weekend at their mountaintop ranch near Santa Barbara, 
Weinberg said, "and loved it."

Queen Elizabeth II distributed purses of specially minted "Maundy" money today

In a ceremony dating to the 12th Century, she gave out purses to 63 men and 63 
women -- one for each year of her life -- who were chosen as community leaders 
in England's second largest city. A crowd of about 5,000 people watched as she 
gave out the purses, each containing 63 pence ($1.08), at St. Philip's 
Cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
Each year a different cathedral is chosen for the ceremony, which is always

President Kurt Waldheim today dismissed suggestions that Austria has suffered 
international isolation during his presidency and said he does not rule out 
running for a second term. 
</P>
<P>
"I have made more trips in 2 1/2 years than my predecessor," Waldheim said in 
an interview with Austrian radio during a visit to the Persian Gulf and Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
Waldheim, elected in 1986, has been shunned by other Western leaders because of 
controversy over his wartime service with Hitler's army. Asked whether he 
thinks he will eventually be invited to visit Western countries, Waldheim said: 
"That will come. . . . I am in the middle of my term. I have 3 1/2 years to 
serve and I can still make many such trips."

An American Airlines jet took off from the wrong runway in Houston today and

International Airport, federal officials said. 
</P>

There were no injuries on Flight 508, which arrived on time at Dallas, its 
intended destination, the airline said. The Federal Aviation Administration 
said more than 90 people were on board. The MD-80 jet mistakenly took off from 
a runway undergoing construction at Houston's Hobby Airport and marked for use 
by light planes only, said Geraldine Cook, spokeswoman for the FAA's regional 
office in Fort Worth.

Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. said today that its manufacturing plant in Smyrna, Tenn., 
was operating at about 83% of capacity and was expected to double output by the 
early 1990s. 
</P>

The Smyrna plant now delivers 220,000 vehicles a year, versus capacity of 
265,000 vehicles, Nissan Chief Financial Officer Atsushi Muramatsu told an 
automotive conference.

Nissan hopes to produce 40,000 vehicles a month, or 480,000 units a year, by 
the early 1990s, Muramatsu said. The company hopes ultimately to achieve 75% 
local content in vehicles made in Smyrna, a Nissan executive added.

Holly Farms Corp., the chicken processor embroiled in a five-month takeover 
battle, said today that its board has rejected a sweetened $1.15-billion bid by 
its rival Tyson Foods Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Holly shares soon jumped 75 cents to $62.125 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Traders said the board's rejection may prompt Conagra Inc. -- Holly's "white 
knight" in the chicken war -- to raise its own $1.06-billion offer for the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Conagra, a giant food products concern, agreed to a $59.25-a-share stock swap 
with Holly in December to rescue the company from Springdale, Ark.-based Tyson. 
Tyson, the nation's top chicken producer, had been offering $63.50 a share for 
Holly, which ranks fifth in the field.

Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said today that inflation seems to be 
cooling off and suggested there may be no reason to raise interest rates 
further. 
</P>
<P>
Although the White House and the Federal Reserve have sometimes squabbled in 
recent months over the inflation threat, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan indicated 
Wednesday that he, too, wants to wait and see what impact the central bank's 
recent credit tightening will have on the economy. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the National Assn. of Manufacturers, Brady acknowledged 
differences of opinion but said the Administration is as determined as the 
Federal Reserve to curb inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"It is possible to have different interpretations of the same economic 
statistics and still share the same goal of fighting inflation," he said.

Toshiba Corp. and Fuji Photo Film Co. said today that they will jointly develop 
a new type of electronic camera that can show photos on TV monitors immediately 
after the picture is taken without processing. 
</P>
<P>
A similar camera was introduced by Sony Corp. last year, but the Toshiba-Fuji 
system is aimed at recording images as digital signals, enabling easy 
transmission of pictures using personal computers and telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
Digital electronic signals will be stored on a floppy disc inside the camera. 
Because it is recorded digitally, pictures can be stored in personal computers, 
Iijima said. 
</P>
<P>
The camera will be too costly for broad commercialization.

investigation is still continuing." 
</P>
<P>
Rose has refused to discuss allegations that have linked him with gambling and 
that could jeopardize his future in baseball. One of the allegations reported 
under investigation is that Rose may have bet on baseball, possibly his own 
team. (Story, Part III, Page 1.) 
</P>
<P>
If proven true, Rose would be suspended or even banned for life.

Bears defensive lineman William (the Refrigerator) Perry is back up to about 
360 pounds and may return to a center for eating disorders, Coach Mike Ditka 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"Perry is trying. . . . He's working out and we're checking his progress," 
Ditka said Wednesday. "It is not going as good as he wants it to go and it is 
not going as good as we want it to go." 
</P>
<P>
Ditka, attending the National Football League owners meetings in Palm Desert, 
Calif., said a decision on the chronically overweight Perry could come as early 
as next week when the staff returns to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Ditka said an understanding exists between Perry and the Bears about what will 
happen if Perry is not in shape by training camp. In January, Ditka said Perry 
would be released if he did not get in shape in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
One possibility is returning him to a clinic for eating disorders, Ditka said. 
</P>
<P>
Perry probably will have to get down to 320 again in order to be invited to 
training camp July 28, Ditka said.

TRACK STAR LEWIS SEES TAINT ON MANY MEDALS, URGES RANDOM TESTING

Track superstar Carl Lewis said today it is his "guess" that as many as 10 
Olympic medals last summer went to athletes using anabolic steroids, and he 
urged random testing at all levels of sports competition. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to elevate ourselves ethically to the point where everyone sacrifices 
ourselves to make the sport clean," the three-time Olympian and winner of six 
gold medals told a congressional subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis received a gold medal in the 100-meter dash at last summer's Olympics in 
South Korea after the first contestant to cross the finish line, Canada's Ben 
Johnson, tested positive for anabolic steroids, compounds that develop strength 
and speed but which are banned as dangerous drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis told members of the House Judiciary Committee's crime subcommittee he 
feels certain that other medal winners also were steroid users. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say at least five to 10, if I had to guess . . . and some of those 
were gold medals," said Lewis, in answer to a question from Rep. Bill McCollum 
(R-Fla.). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legislation Debated 
</P>
<P>
Members of the subcommittee, which is weighing proposed legislation to ban 
mail-order steroids, did not ask Lewis the names of other users who may have 
won medals. He ducked the question when reporters asked him after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not the issue," he said. "The issue is that it should be zero." 
</P>
<P>
He departed from the view of a number of other athletes as well as civil 
liberties groups when asked about testing. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're getting to the point where we have to randomly," Lewis said. 
"It's at every level." 
</P>
<P>
He also called for investigation of coaches who may be working with steroid 
suppliers and forcing athletes to use the substances. He said some coaches 
deliberately train athletes the wrong way if they refuse to take the drugs as a 
way of prodding them to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Other coaches may be slipping steroids into the vitamins of the athletes under 
their supervision, Lewis said.

FORTNER RETURNS AS TOROS' SPIKER COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nancy Fortner of San Pedro will return to Cal State Dominguez Hills to take 
over the school's women's volleyball program, Athletic Director Dan Guerrero 
announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Fortner, 45, replaces Jennifer Gorecki, who resigned in December. 
</P>
<P>
Fortner guided the Lady Toro volleyball program from 1973 through 1978. In her 
last season the team was 18-6 and won the Pacific Coast Athletic Conference. 
She moved to Loyola Marymount in 1979 and in seven years mounted a 144-89 
record that included one Western Collegiate Athletic Assn. title. 
</P>
<P>
"(Nancy) is one of the most respected volleyball figures in Southern 
California," Guerrero said. 
</P>
<P>
Fortner's husband, Ron, is the women's basketball coach at Pepperdine.

1989 ALL-COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL; 
</P>
<P>
FOUR TEAMS PLACE TWO PLAYERS EACH; SIX PLAYERS REPEAT

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four of the dominant teams in San Diego high school basketball placed two 
players each on The Times' 1988-89 All-County teams. 
</P>
<P>
The Torrey Pines and Lincoln boys and Point Loma and Vista girls each had a 
pair of players picked, and four of the eight were repeat selections. 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines' Courtie Miller and Kevin Flanagan were named to the boys' team 
for the second consecutive year. Lincoln's Joe Temple and Aaron Wilhite were 
selected for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Returners Chris Enger of Vista and Monica Filer of Point Loma led their teams 
to section championships and into the Southern California Regional finals. 
Enger was joined by teammate Dana Christofferson, Filer by Tyeast Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Other repeaters were Madison's Robby Robinson and Mission Bay's Cristina 
Willis. 
</P>
<P>
Players and coaches of the year will be announced at The Times' awards 
breakfast April 2 at the Anaheim Hilton Hotel and Towers. 
</P>
<P>
BOYS 
</P>
<P>
Tony Clark, 6-7 junior forward, Valhalla 
</P>
<P>
Clark's talent was most apparent after teammate Rafid Kiti suffered a collapsed 
lung and missed several games late in the season. 
</P>
<P>
Clark had been used to relying on Kiti and his 24-point average to take 
pressure off the inside game. But when adversity struck, Clark got better. He 
scored 55 points in one game -- the highest of any player in the county this 
season and third on the all-time section lists -- and 47 in another. He led 
county scoring for much of the season and finished with a 30.4-point average, 
second on the section all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who utilizes a strong power game and his rebounding skills, also showed 
he could score from the outside. He shot 59% from the field and 77% from the 
line and was named the Grossmont League 2-A player of the year as Valhalla won 
its first basketball title. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Flanagan, 6-9 senior center, Torrey Pines 
</P>
<P>
A former teammate called Flanagan "the toughest guy in the world." Maybe a 
slight exaggeration, but Flanagan was tough enough, averaging 10.9 rebounds and 
18.1 points to help the Falcons to the Division II championship. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan, a three-year starter, was recently selected to play on the McDonald's 
Western All-Star team. In the fall, he will attend Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Clark James, 6-4 junior guard/forward, San Diego 
</P>
<P>
Control Clark James, and you have a chance to defeat San Diego, or so it was 
this season. In the Cavers' four regular-season losses, James averaged just 
nine points. But in 17 victories, he averaged 26. 
</P>
<P>
James led the young (one senior starter) and talented Cavers to a second-place 
finish in the City Central League behind Lincoln, which defeated San Diego 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
He was even more important in the playoffs, leading San Diego to the Division I 
championship game (a 64-49 loss to Poway) after two regulars were declared 
ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
Ray McDavid, 6-2 senior guard, Clairemont 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the only guy in town who can polish off McDavid in a one-on-one pickup 
game is his coach, Greg Lee, who started on two national championship teams at 
UCLA. But with Lee at courtside, McDavid was virtually unstoppable in the City 
West League this season, finishing fourth in the county in scoring with a 
25.1-point average. 
</P>
<P>
McDavid led his team to the Division III championship game at the Sports Arena, 
where it lost to Lincoln. A three-sport athlete who also competes in football 
and baseball, McDavid balanced his game between powerful dunks and a smooth 
jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
Erik Meek, 6-9 sophomore center, San Pasqual 
</P>
<P>
Meek is the youngest member of The Times' All-County team but has always 
performed beyond his years in basketball. He averaged 22.6 points (ninth in the 
county) and 11.8 rebounds a game. In two years, he has scored more than 1,000 
points, and schools such as Arizona and Syracuse have shown an interest. 
</P>
<P>
"He is the most promising basketball player out of San Diego in a long time," 
San Pasqual Coach Tom Buck said. "San Diego is in for a treat the next two 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Buck said Meek needs to get better defensively but that he has already vastly 
improved: "He's starting to get his whole game together." 
</P>
<P>
Against Madison in the playoffs, he scored 39 points and had 26 rebounds and 
eight blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
Courtie Miller, 6-8 senior forward, Torrey Pines 
</P>
<P>
A three-year starter for Torrey Pines, Miller has earned respect from his 
teammates and coaches for being a team player who places winning before 
individual accomplishments. John Farrell, the Torrey Pines coach, says he 
watched a great progression over the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
"Courtie has really matured, not only as a basketball player but as a person," 
Farrell said. "He has been a real pleasure to be around." 
</P>
<P>
Miller was The Times' boys' player of the year last season. This season, he 
averaged 21.1 points, 10.9 rebounds, 4.5 assists and 4.1 blocks. 
</P>
<P>
He led Torrey Pines to the section Division II championship and the semifinals 
of the Southern California Regionals, where the Falcons lost to Dominguez 
despite his 31 points. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, who will play for San Diego State, was chosen a preseason Street and 
Smith honorable mention All-American. 
</P>
<P>
Robby Robinson, 6-4 senior guard/forward, Madison 
</P>
<P>
Robinson was a man without a position but a master of all this year. As the 
lone returning starter, Robinson played point guard, shooting guard, low post 
and even some center. He finished second in the county in scoring (27 points a 
game) and led the Warhawks in assists as well. And he guarded the opponent's 
best player in every game. 
</P>
<P>
"For a while, (not having a position) used to bug me," Robinson said. "I'd 
practice at guard all week and then get moved down low in the game, and it 
frustrated me. But I've learned to do what it takes." 
</P>
<P>
Will Tate, 6-0 senior guard, Southwest 
</P>
<P>
Gifted athletes often must choose the sport for which they will accept a 
college scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
Tate is one such athlete. In basketball, he was Metro Conference player of the 
year this season and co-player of the year in the Mesa League last season. In 
football, he was named Metro offensive player of the year and to The Times' 
All-County team last season. 
</P>
<P>
He will play football for San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
"Basketball was his No. 1 sport at first," Southwest Coach Steve Selland said, 
"but then he came to like football more." 
</P>
<P>
Tate averaged 16.4 points, 6.4 assists and five steals to help lead the Raiders 
(21-8) to the section Division I quarterfinals and school's best record ever. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Temple, 6-3 senior guard/forward, Lincoln 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln Coach Ron Loneski is running out of adjectives to describe Joe Temple, 
and with good reason. 
</P>
<P>
Temple set section records for steals in a game (15), season (173) and career 
(301), was third in the county with 25.8 points per game, averaged 11.3 
rebounds and three assists and led Lincoln to a 26-1 regular-season record and 
its second consecutive Division III title. 
</P>
<P>
He scored 30 or more points in eight games and was held under 20 just twice (he 
had 17 against Madison and 15 against Poway). Despite having never played 
basketball before the ninth grade, he was a three-year starter for the Hornets, 
averaging in double figures in points and rebounds all three years. 
</P>
<P>
Temple also is a 6-foot-6 high jumper in track and received a scholarship offer 
to play tight end for San Diego State's football team. He has a 3.0 grade-point 
average at Gompers, a math/science/computer magnet school. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Wilhite, 6-8 senior center, Lincoln 
</P>
<P>
The only thing bad about Aaron Wilhite this season was timing. Against 
Christian, Wilhite had 27 rebounds and 31 points, but Temple scored 35 points 
and set a section record with 15 steals. 
</P>
<P>
In the Hornets' next game, Wilhite set a section record with 39 rebounds, but 
that too went largely unnoticed because it was the final game of the regular 
season and Lincoln already had wrapped up its fourth consecutive City Central 
title. 
</P>
<P>
Said Loneski of his three-year starting center: "Aaron is the greatest 
overachiever I've ever coached." 
</P>
<P>
Like Temple, Wilhite averaged in double figures in scoring and rebounding for 
three seasons. In 1988-89, he was sixth in the county in scoring with a 23.9 
average and had 15 rebounds, three assists and 3.5 steals per game. 
</P>
<P>
GIRLS 
</P>
<P>
Rebecca Aase, 5-8 junior guard/forward, Santana 
</P>
<P>
Aase came on strong in the second half and finished as the Grossmont 
Conference's leading scorer with 16.9 points per game. She also led the 
conference in free throw shooting (48 of 64, 75%). 
</P>
<P>
Aase led Santana to a 6-0 Grossmont 2-A League record and was named the 
league's most valuable player. She was especially effective when center 
Stephanie Thompson missed several games with an injury. Santana finished the 
regular season with a No. 3 county ranking and went to the section Division I 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Tyeast Brown, 5-11 senior center, Point Loma 
</P>
<P>
Brown had 538 rebounds this season, second most in San Diego Section history. 
</P>
<P>
"She's probably the best defensive low post player I've ever coached," Point 
Loma Coach Lee Trepanier said. "Even better than Terri Mann (former Point Loma 
All-American). Tyeast played against players much bigger than her all year. She 
had to play good technical defense." 
</P>
<P>
Brown also averaged 15.6 points. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Christofferson, 5-9 1/2 senior forward, Vista 
</P>
<P>
Although overshadowed by Chris Enger, Christofferson was Vista's defensive 
catalyst and went about her business quietly but intensely. 
</P>
<P>
"She was our best defensive player," Vista Coach Joe DeMaria said. You don't 
get a lot of recognition on defense, but she was really effective on both sides 
of the court." 
</P>
<P>
She came on strong in the second half and scored in double figures in 17 of the 
last 18 games. She averaged 12.9 points (14.2 in the playoffs) and 7.8 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Christofferson was named to the Palomar League first team and will most likely 
play basketball at UC San Diego. She has a cumulative 3.9 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
Dasheila Dixon, 6-3 sophomore center, Lincoln 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln Coach Dorothy Robinson said before the season, "With all the kids I've 
converted from track to basketball, we've got speed." Robinson also had height 
in 6-3 Dixon, the only sophomore on the girls' All-County team despite her 
having played basketball for just 1 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said Dixon is far from reaching her potential and is just starting to 
realize she can dominate. Late in the season, she became only the fifth girl in 
section history to score 50 or more points in a game, when she had 50, 
including 26 in the third quarter, against Christian. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon was third in county scoring (26-point average) to go with her 10-plus 
rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Enger, 6-4 senior center, Vista 
</P>
<P>
More often than not, Enger inside the key meant points for the Panthers. She 
averaged 28.2 points during the regular season and 32 in the playoffs and was 
the Panthers' leading rebounder with a 14.6 average (19.7 in playoffs). 
</P>
<P>
Enger averaged 8.5 blocked shots per game, 9.5 in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"She's the most talented player in the county," DeMaria said. "She runs the 
ball better than most guards. She's very diversified. She runs, she shoots 
inside and out and defensively she's a problem for other teams." 
</P>
<P>
She might attend Oregon State or the University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive year, Enger was voted the Palomar League player of 
the year. Vista (28-4) won its first Division II section title and reached the 
Southern California Regional Division II final before losing to Anaheim 
Katella. 
</P>
<P>
Monica Filer, 5-7 senior guard, Point Loma 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma finished 32-2 this season, largely because of the play of this slick 
point guard. Filer dished out a state-record 390 assists this season, pushing 
her career total to 773. She also averaged 22.1 points. 
</P>
<P>
"Having Monica on the court is like having six players on the court," Trepanier 
said. "She took care of the other girls, making sure they were doing their 
jobs. She was a true captain -- a real leader." 
</P>
<P>
Mesega Johnson, 5-6 senior forward, Southwest 
</P>
<P>
Johnson kept the Raiders from self-destructing after they lost four starters 
during the course of the season. She finished as the county's No. 4 scorer 
(25.6 average), behind three other All-County selections. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest finished 15-9 and tied for third in the Metro Conference, and "that 
was directly attributed to Mesega and her stabilizing influence," Coach John 
Boone said. 
</P>
<P>
Her best game was against Morse, where she set a school scoring record (48) and 
pulled down 21 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson is strong and quick -- she was the league 100-yard dash champion her 
freshman year -- and still learning. "We haven't even scratched the surface yet 
with her potential," Boone said. 
</P>
<P>
Rochelle Johnson, 5-11 senior center, Patrick Henry 
</P>
<P>
Johnson averaged better than 20 points and about 16 rebounds a game for an 18-8 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"She probably has more raw talent than anyone I've ever coached," Patrick Henry 
Coach John Ferguson said. "She was the team most valuable player, high point 
and rebound person, and she was a real team leader. She worked real hard." 
</P>
<P>
Susie O'Brien, 6-0 senior forward, San Marcos 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien finished with a 29.9 average to lead the county in scoring but had 
pushed that average to 30.5 at midseason. She also averaged 15 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
She led San Marcos (21-7) to the Avocado League championship and the section 
Division II title game (won by Vista) and was the league player of the year. 
She is a three-time first-team all-league selection. 
</P>
<P>
Cristina Willis, 6-1 senior forward, Mission Bay 
</P>
<P>
Willis started for three seasons for her father, Larry. She finished this past 
regular season fifth in county scoring with 24.4 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
Willis also averaged 12 rebounds and four assists. Teams figured out quickly 
she was the player to stop and often triple-teamed her. 
</P>
<P>
"That was just typical," Larry Willis said. "When she had the ball, she had 
three people on her. She got used to that." 
</P>
<P>
Willis led the Buccaneers to the semifinals of the Division II playoffs, where 
they lost to San Marcos.

LAKEWOOD, DOMINGUEZ AND MILLIKAN EACH PLACE 2 ON BOYS ALL-SOUTH COAST TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The boys 1989 Times All-South Coast High School Basketball Team, composed of 
talented all-around veteran players who know how to win, is a coach's dream. 
</P>
<P>
CIF Southern Section champions Dominguez and Millikan each placed two players 
on the team, as did Moore League champion Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
Xavier Edison and DiJon Bernard led Dominguez to the Southern Regional finals 
of the state tournament. 
</P>
<P>
From Millikan are forward Jeep Jensen and guard Terry Hilliard, and from 
Lakewood are Brian Camper, the Moore League's most valuable player, and his 
cousin, Victor Camper. 
</P>
<P>
Zachary Allison of Centennial, Russell May of Mayfair, David Mitchell of Jordan 
and Earnest Killum of Lynwood round out the team. 
</P>
<P>
Killum, the only junior on the team, is its top scorer. He averaged just under 
30 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard, the Campers and May made the team last year. 
</P>
<P>
The All-South Coast team: 
</P>
<P>
Brian Camper, Lakewood -- The MVP of the Moore League, Camper averaged 20.3 
points a game. "His biggest attribute is his all-around game," Lakewood Coach 
Tim Sweeney said of Brian, who can shoot, rebound and pass. "He's not a Dr. J 
flashy type player, he's more of an overall blue-collar fundamental player." 
Camper has signed with Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Camper, Lakewood -- Brian's cousin, he averaged 13 points and was a real 
force inside with seven or eight rebounds a game. "There's probably not a 
stronger inside player in the CIF," Sweeney said of the 6-8, 230-pound center 
who is headed for Lamar University in Beaumont, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
DiJon Bernard, Dominguez -- The Dons' point guard, he averaged 13.8 points, but 
on a less-balanced team could easily have averaged 20. A great shooter who 
scored 27 points in a playoff game, he also led the Dons in assists and was a 
leader on defense. 
</P>
<P>
Xavier Edison, Dominguez -- Relentlessness is what marked this 6-4 senior 
forward, according to Dons Coach Russell Otis. "He's hard-nosed, is a great 
defender and gives 110% every time he steps on the floor," Otis said. Edison 
averaged 14 points and 10.6 rebounds a game for the 26-5 Dons. 
</P>
<P>
David Mitchell, Jordan -- A left-handed player, this 6-3 senior guard averaged 
18.3 points a game and made All-Moore League. He is a good jumper, passer, 
long-range shooter -- and student. He scored 38 points against Sunny Hills in 
the El Dorado Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Earnest Killum, Lynwood -- Displaying great shooting range, he averaged 29.8 
points a game. "The kids all respect him and look up to him," Lynwood Coach 
Bill Notley said of his junior co-captain. "He has a good temperament, he is 
not up one day and down the other." Killum has been contacted by about 100 
colleges. "He is a great jumper who will play off-guard in college," Notley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeep Jensen, Millikan -- An All-Moore League forward on the Southern Section 
5-AA champion Rams, this left-hander averaged 13.5 points and eight rebounds a 
game. Very intelligent, Jensen plays hard, likes to shoot outside but can also 
score inside. He had 26 points against Loyola in the second round of CIF 
playoffs and 21 against Saddleback in the championship game. He also was one of 
the Rams' best defensive players. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Hilliard, Millikan -- A solid guard with Division I college potential, 
Hilliard averaged 14.6 points a game and probably was the Moore League's best 
point guard. Not flashy, he does a workmanlike job with good quickness and a 
good jump shot. He was a leader on a championship team, and scored 26 points 
against St. Monica in the playoff semifinals. Like Jensen, he is left-handed 
and all-league. 
</P>
<P>
Russell May, Mayfair -- A very aggressive 6-6 center with good post moves and a 
soft outside shooting touch, he averaged 24 points and 16 rebounds a game and 
made the all-Suburban League team for the second straight year. "A great kid 
with good grades . . . a perfect gentleman," Mayfair Coach Joe Tereschuk said. 
He may play at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
Zachary Allison, Centennial -- A 6-3 left-handed guard, he loved to penetrate 
into the lane for a 12-foot jump shot. He averaged 18.6 points, 6.7 assists and 
6.3 rebounds a game and was the MVP of the Ocean League. "It's very difficult 
to stop him from penetrating," Apaches Coach Willie Emanuel said of Allison, 
who also is accurate from 3-point range. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1989 ALL-STARS 
</P>
<P>
The all-star boys and girls teams, each consisting of 10 members, their coaches 
and parents will be guests of The Times at 9 a.m. Sunday, April 2, at the 
annual Times High School Basketball Awards Brunch where all-stars teams from 12 
circulation areas will be honored at the Anaheim Hilton. The featured speaker 
will be George Yardley, a former All-American at Stanford University, who went 
on to become the first player ever to score more than 2,000 points in an NBA 
season. The players and the coaches of the year from each area will be 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
The teams were chosen on the basis of a poll of area coaches, who are asked to 
fill out ballots nominating their own players and opponents, plus the 
observations of college scouts and sportswriters. Each player will recieve the 
traditional Times golden basketball plaque and award certificate.

GIRLS ALL-SOUTH COAST TEAM INCLUDES 4 JUNIORS, ONE OF WHOM IS AN ALL-AMERICAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
There are two exceptional junior basketball players at Lynwood High School -- 
Earnest Killum, who averaged almost 30 points a game for the boys team, and 
Linda Watson, who averaged 22 for the girls team. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she'd beat Earnest (in a shooting contest)," Lynwood girls Coach 
Maurice Roberson said of Watson, one of the players on the 1989 Times All-South 
Coast High School Basketball Team. 
</P>
<P>
Watson, a guard-forward, made 72 3-point shots (from beyond 19 feet) this 
season, breaking the CIF girls record of 55. She was named by Parade magazine 
as a first-team All-American. 
</P>
<P>
"She can do everything," Roberson said. "And she works on continually 
developing her skills. She's not satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
Watson also averaged 9.5 rebounds, five assists and three steals as she led the 
21-7 Knights to the San Gabriel Valley League championship and the second round 
of the CIF playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
She made The Times' All-South Coast Team for the second year in a row, as did 
another junior, Iesha Smith of Artesia. Altogether, there are four juniors on 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
Compton, St. Joseph and Poly High each placed two players on the team. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the All-South Coast all-stars: 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Hill, Compton -- At 5-foot-8, she held her own against taller players 
and averaged 13 points and 12 rebounds a game. "She's very aggressive on the 
boards, and has a good attitude," said Tarbabes Coach Carolyn Montgomery. Hill 
is effective either facing the basket or posting an opponent. She started last 
season as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
Sharnette McMillan, Compton -- "If she keeps her head together, look for her to 
be a Division I player," Montgomery said of this junior who averaged 14 points 
and five assists. She led her team in scoring as point guard and is a very good 
offensive player, adept at shooting and leaping. 
</P>
<P>
Miko Montgomery, Poly -- Known as the Charles Barkley of girls high school 
basketball, the 5-8 Montgomery once weighed 220 pounds but now is about 195. 
"The only thing she doesn't do (that Barkley of the Philadelphia 76ers does) is 
dunk," said Jackrabbits Coach Orlando Larracuente. "She handles the ball, goes 
coast to coast and can shoot with anyone, including boys." Montgomery averaged 
10 points and five rebounds for the Moore League champions. There's a good 
chance she will go to Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Yvonne Vanlandingham, Poly -- The Moore League's MVP, she averaged 13 points, 
eight rebounds and two blocked shots. A center who can also shoot 3-pointers, 
she did not start playing basketball until the middle of her sophomore year. 
Larracuente expects her to be a Division I player, possibly at San Jose State 
or Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Fernandez, St. Joseph -- Most valuable player of the Angelus League, this 
sharp shooter played all positions, averaging 20 points, nine rebounds, four 
assists and 4.6 steals. "She is not weak in anything," Jesters Coach Margaret 
Bos said of Fernandez, who had five triple doubles. An outstanding pitcher, 
Fernandez is going to UCLA on a softball scholarship and wants to play 
basketball there. "I think she can make it," Bos said. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Montoya, St. Joseph -- "She loves to play defense," Bos said of the very 
quick Montoya, a guard who had six steals a game. She also averaged 10.9 
points, 3.5 rebounds and 4.8 assists. "Dana and Lisa are both a coach's dream 
players, they play with their hearts," Bos said of Montoya and Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
Tameesha Hayes, St. Anthony -- Hayes had a great year for a 15-8 team. She 
averaged 19.8 points a game, eight assists and five steals, shot 56% from the 
field and 78% from the foul line. "She plays a complete game, comes through in 
the clutch and doesn't make many mistakes," St. Anthony Coach Candy Gomez said. 
Hayes beat out Fernandez of St. Joseph for MVP of the St. Anthony Tournament. 
She also has a 3.8 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
Iesha Smith, Artesia -- The leader of the 19-5 Suburban League champions, this 
5-10 junior averaged 25 points and five assists a game. She also shot 60% from 
the field and 70% from the free throw line. A player with great athletic 
ability, she is particularly effective in the open court, either driving to the 
basket or pulling up for a jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
Minnie Blalock, Jordan -- A three-year starter, this point guard played an 
up-tempo game and averaged 15.5 points, six assists and two steals for the 
15-10 Panthers. In two seasons she made 89 shots from 3-point territory. 
</P>

GLENDORA'S MURRAY HAS RECORD YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As high school basketball seasons go in the San Gabriel Valley, this was one 
for the record books. 
</P>
<P>
At least when the subject is Tracy Murray, the brilliant 6-8 forward for 
Glendora High School who led the Tartans to a 31-3 record and the state 
Division II finals. 
</P>
<P>
In his final season, Murray established CIF Southern Section single-season 
records for most points and highest scoring average and surpassed the career 
mark for most points. Murray saved his best for last, pouring in a 
state-tournament-record 64 points in his team's loss to Menlo Atherton in the 
state final last week. 
</P>
<P>
So it is no surprise that Murray tops the list of players on The Times All-San 
Gabriel Valley high school all-star basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
Charter Oak, which won the Sierra League and finished at 21-5, is the only team 
with more than one player on the squad. The Chargers placed 6-9 center Jeff Von 
Lutzow and 6-5 forward Shane Bowers. 
</P>
<P>
Other team members are guards Jason Ferguson (6-0) of Workman, Jason Giambi 
(6-2) of South Hills, Idris Jones (6-3) of Pasadena, Carlos Lopez (6-1) of 
Rosemead and Corey Rogers (6-3) of Nogales and forwards Tony McGee (6-7) of 
Azusa and Pablo Patino (6-7) of Bishop Amat. 
</P>
<P>
There are no juniors on the squad. Murray is the only repeater from last year. 
</P>
<P>
Murray is the first player to make the all-valley team three years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Murray averaged 23.1 points and 10.4 rebounds as a sophomore and 31.3 points 
and 11 rebounds last year. This season he averaged 44.3 points -- best in the 
nation -- and 14 rebounds, four assists and four blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
That gave him 3,053 points -- the first CIF Southern Section player ever to 
surpass the 3,000 plateau. He also finished with Southern Section single-season 
records of 1,505 points and a 44.3 average and finished in the Southern Section 
top 10 for his career in rebounds and scoring average. 
</P>
<P>
The three-time league most valuable player has been named to the McDonald's 
All-American team and Gatorade state and regional player of the year. He has 
narrowed his list of schools to UCLA, UNLV, Villanova, Louisville and New 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Bowers hasn't nearly received the attention of Murray or even his teammate, Von 
Lutzow, but has quietly emerged as one of the valley's top players. A two-time 
All-Sierra League selection, Bowers averaged 18.6 points and 10 rebounds as a 
senior. 
</P>
<P>
He is an all-around athlete, captain on both the basketball and baseball teams 
at Charter Oak. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson enjoyed a big year. He was one of the best shooters in the valley, 
averaging 28.4 points, and averaged a valley-leading 12.6 assists and 5.3 
rebounds. An All-Valle Vista League selection, he will probably attend Mt. San 
Antonio College for one season and transfer to a four-year program. 
</P>
<P>
Another standout named Jason from the Valle Vista League was Giambi, who led 
South Hills to its best season in recent years. The Huskies won their league 
title and finished at 19-6 as Giambi averaged 22.9 points and 10.9 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Selected most valuable player of the Valle Vista League, he is also one of the 
top pitchers in the valley, having led the Huskies to the CIF 4-A Division 
finals last season. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to shooting guards, there may not have been anyone better than 
Jones. He averaged 20.2 points, five rebounds, three assists and three steals 
to lead resurgent Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
With Jones earning Pacific League most valuable player honors, the Bulldogs won 
their first league title in seven years and were ranked No. 1 in the CIF 5-A 
Division most of the season before losing in the semifinals of the playoffs and 
finishing at 24-3. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, who was also named most valuable player of the Glendale and Bishop Amat 
tournaments during the season, is considered one of the top college prospects 
in the valley and has signed a letter of intent to attend UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Another outstanding shooter was Lopez, one of the premier players from the 
three-point line in the Southern Section with 103, including 10 against 
Mountain View. He made five or more three-pointers in a game 13 times in his 
senior season. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez finished the season with averages of 21.7 points and 4.8 rebounds to lead 
Rosemead to a 19-5 record and its first league title and the second round of 
the 4-A playoffs. He was selected the league's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
McGee has followed a path of steady progress in three years as a starter for 
Azusa. He averaged 17.3 points as a sophomore, 22.6 points and 8.5 rebounds as 
a junior and 26.9 points, 11 rebounds and six assists this season. 
</P>
<P>
He earned All-Montview League honors for three straight years and was named 
league most valuable player the last two seasons. An outstanding offensive 
player from both inside and outside, McGee was heavily recruited by Division I 
programs and has signed a letter of intent with Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
This was supposed to be a rebuilding year for Bishop Amat. But with Patino 
leading the way, the Lancers finished at 16-10 and reached the 4-A 
quarterfinals before losing to Barstow. 
</P>
<P>
An all-league first-team selection in the rugged Angelus League, Patino 
averaged 19 points and 10 rebounds. He has been recruited by numerous Division 
II and III programs, including Cal Poly Pomona, UC San Diego, Redlands and 
Pomona-Pitzer. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers stamped himself as one of the top guards in the valley. He averaged 15.2 
points, 4.4 rebounds and 3.3 assists as a junior before improving to 25.9 
points, 6.1 rebounds and 2.7 assists as a senior. An outstanding outside 
shooter, he finished third in the CIF in three-point baskets with 92. 
</P>
<P>
He was named to the All-Sierra League first team two years in a row and earned 
all-tournament selection three times as a senior. He signed a letter of intent 
last November with Northern Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Von Lutzow, perhaps the top center in the valley, averaged 24.5 points and 12.3 
rebounds to lead the Chargers to a 21-5 record and the second round of the 4-A 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Von Lutzow, a two-time all-league selection, was second to Murray in balloting 
by valley coaches. He is considered an excellent college prospect and has 
signed with UC Irvine. He also plays baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Receiving honorable mention are Don Mitchell, Chris Henson and Burl Irby of 
Pasadena, Ryan McKee of Pasadena Poly, Jason Green of Bishop Amat, Kenny Hall 
of Garey, Clyde Jordan of West Covina, Johnny McWilliams of Pomona, Kevin Cable 
of Covina, Criss Freeman of Baldwin Park, Rod Taylor of San Dimas, Derrick 
Cooper of Blair and Hung Duong of Alhambra.

STANDOUT MUIR ONLY SCHOOL TO GET 2 ON TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From all standpoints, it has been a memorable year for the girls basketball 
team at Muir High School in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs won the Pacific League title, finished second in the CIF Southern 
Section 4-A Division -- their best result since 1986 -- and reached the 
semifinals of the state Division II regional playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Not to mention the honors that are starting to mount for the Mustangs off the 
court. Muir, which finished with a 24-5 record, is the only team to place two 
players on the Los Angeles Times All-San Gabriel Valley girls high school 
all-star basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs, a perennial valley power, are represented by center Lisa Salsman 
(6-2) and forward Karin Banks (5-10). 
</P>
<P>
Other team members are forward Rachel Acuff (5-7) of Temple City, forward 
Jennifer Allen (5-9) of St. Lucy's, center Ingrid Dixson (6-2) of West Covina, 
guard Sachi Ezaki (5-3) of Covina, guard Betty Lee (5-2) of Keppel, center 
Stacey Oughton (6-2) of Bishop Amat, forward Susan Peters (5-11) of Los Altos 
and guard Elizabeth Sirchia (5-6) of Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
Banks and Dixson are juniors. The only repeater from last year is Peters. 
</P>
<P>
Acuff was described by one opposing coach as "the whole team" and, while that 
may be a bit of an overstatement, she meant a lot to the fortunes of Temple 
City. 
</P>
<P>
In leading the Rams to second place in the Rio Hondo League and the second 
round of the 4-A Division playoffs, Acuff averaged 20.5 points, 13.5 rebounds, 
nine assists and four steals to earn most valuable player honors in the league. 
</P>
<P>
It was a successful season for St. Lucy's, which finished with a 19-9 record 
and advanced to the 3-A quarterfinals before losing to eventual champion 
Brea-Olinda, and the team was led by all-around play from Allen. 
</P>
<P>
An all-league first-team selection in the Baseline League, Allen averaged 18.6 
points and 10.6 rebounds, leading the Regents in both departments. Among 
colleges recruiting her are Loyola Marymount and La Verne. 
</P>
<P>
Banks may have been overshadowed by Salsman on the Mustangs. She averaged 18.7 
points and 6.2 rebounds to place second on the Mustangs in both categories. 
</P>
<P>
A first-team All-Pacific League selection, Banks has attracted recruiters from 
Cal State Fullerton, Oregon State and Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Another junior who has attracted recruiters is Dixson, a strong inside player 
who paced West Covina with 17.5 points and 11.3 rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
Dixson, who carried the Bulldogs into the 5-A quarterfinals, has been a 
two-time All-Sierra League first-team selection and was named most valuable 
player of the La Puente Tournament. She has been recruited by UC Irvine, San 
Jose State and St. Mary's. 
</P>
<P>
At 5-3, Ezaki was among the shortest players on the court. But she rarely came 
up short statistically for Covina. She averaged 15.3 points, 8.6 assists and 
6.3 rebounds as the Colts advanced to the 3-A quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
She also earned Valle Vista League most valuable player honors and was selected 
all-league for the third year in a row. Also an excellent student with a 3.9 
grade-point average, Ezaki expects to attend Claremont McKenna. 
</P>
<P>
In a similar manner, the 5-2 Lee was the biggest force at Keppel for three 
years. An outstanding floor leader, she averaged 20.7 points and 7.3 assists 
and also led the Aztecs in steals last season. 
</P>
<P>
That earned her the most valuable player award in the Mission Valley League for 
the second consecutive season. She is a three-time all-league selection. She 
said she is leaning toward attending Azusa Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Amat has not been known for its girls basketball teams, but the Lancers 
made dramatic improvement from 4-16 two years ago to 16-8 this season, and the 
development of Oughton was a major reason. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior, Oughton averaged 20.5 points and 12.6 rebounds and was selected to 
the All-Angelus League first team. Considering a promising Division I prospect, 
she has signed a national letter of intent to attend Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
More than one opposing coach called Peters the best player in the valley, and 
there certainly is evidence to support the statement. As a senior, she averaged 
about 23 points and 10 rebounds to carry Los Altos to a 26-2 record and the 4-A 
quarterfinals after the team reached the 3-A finals the year before. 
</P>
<P>
An excellent shooter who plays well underneath and away from the basket, she 
was named the most valuable player of the Sierra League the last two years. As 
a junior she was The Times' San Gabriel Valley section player of the year and 
CIF 3-A player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
One of the top all-around athletes in the valley, Peters was also an All-CIF 
selection as a setter in volleyball and has signed a letter of intent to attend 
USC on a volleyball scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to dominant inside players, no one made more impact this season 
than Salsman. The latest in a long line of outstanding front-line players for 
the Mustangs, Salsman was the leading rebounder in the valley at 18.5 a game 
and was among the scoring leaders with a 20.7 average. 
</P>
<P>
So it is not surprising that she was selected most valuable player of the 
Pacific League. Salsman has signed a letter of intent with Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
Sirchia, nicknamed "Bits" because of her size when she was younger, ranks among 
the top outside shooters in the valley with 54 three-point baskets as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
She was more than simply a strong shooter, though. Sirchia averaged seven 
rebounds and five assists in addition to 17 points and was a first-team 
selection in the Sierra League. 
</P>
<P>
Players receiving honorable mention are Natalie Kramer of San Dimas, Tristin 
Alfred of Walnut, Rose Jong of Muir, Judy Gilliam of Glendora, Grace Tellez of 
Sierra Vista, DeOndra Naulls of Pomona, Lisa Sloan and Chris Mendoza of West 
Covina, Teresa Tyler of Diamond Bar, Jonna Steffens of Los Altos, Debbie 
Macciola of Maranatha, Kadra Oliver of Marshall Fundamental, Amy Schroeder of 
Western Christian and Kristin Triepke of St. Lucy's. 
</P>

WESTCHESTER'S MASON NAMED FOR 3RD YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY RIPTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are not a lot of big-name players on this year's Times All-Westside high 
school boys basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
Only Zan Mason of Westchester has developed the reputation accorded to such 
all-stars of the recent past as Chris Mills and Sean Higgins of Fairfax High 
and former St. Monica players Jason Matthews, Earl Duncan and Brian Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Mason, named All-Westside for the third straight year, is headed for UCLA. 
Mills is playing for Kentucky, Higgins at Michigan and Matthews at Pittsburgh. 
Duncan started out at Syracuse and is now at Rutgers. Williams played a year at 
Maryland and was a redshirt this season at Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
But all of this year's all-stars probably can play in college. 
</P>
<P>
The stars include Eric Clark of University, Adam Clayton of Bel-Air Prep, Chris 
Cotton of St. Monica and Sam Crawford of Westchester. Others are Fred Dardashti 
of Beverly Hills, Jason Edwards of Palisades, Norman Francis of Fairfax, 
Cleveland Jackson of St. Monica and Michael Moore of Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Mason and Crawford are repeaters from last year. Moore was named to The Times' 
1988 All-Westside football team at wide receiver and received a football 
scholarship to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Capsule descriptions of each player: 
</P>
<P>
Clark -- Also a top tennis player, he averaged 17.1 points and 5.6 rebounds a 
game and was the top nominee of University Coach Jim Nakabara. 
</P>
<P>
Clayton -- He sparked Bel-Air to the Division V Southern California regional 
championship. He averaged 18.8 points, 8.3 assists and 5.1 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Cotton -- He was outstanding for St. Monica, one of the best teams at the 
highest level (5-AA) in the CIF-Southern Section. He averaged 15.1 points, 5.5 
assists and nearly four rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford -- The ignition system for strong Westchester teams of the last three 
years, he averaged 17 points and eight assists this season. 
</P>
<P>
Dardashti -- An All-Bay League guard, he averaged 13.2 points and 7.1 assists 
and gave a lift to a scrappy Beverly Hills team. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards -- He shot 51% from the field and 88% from the foul line and averaged 
18.1 points, 7.5 assists and 4.1 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Francis -- A two-year starter, he was named All-Metro League after averaging 
13.5 points and 7.5 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson -- A star at forward and center, Jackson averaged team-high marks of 17 
points and 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Mason -- One of the nation's outstanding inside players, he averaged 22 points 
and 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Moore -- An All-Bay League selection and an all-around athlete who also stars 
in baseball, he averaged 20 points and 6.5 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Honorable mention: 
</P>
<P>
Bel-Air -- Jason Plazola, Zaid Al-Hakim. 
</P>
<P>
Culver City -- Tunde Jefferson.

<P>
Palisades and Crossroads, among the strongest teams in the area, each have two 
selections on The Times' All-Westside high school girls basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
Both went undefeated to win their league championships, Palisades in the Los 
Angeles City 4-A Metro League and Crossroads for the sixth straight year in the 
Delphic League. Most of the Delphic teams competed at the 1-A level in the 
CIF-Southern Section playoffs; the Roadrunners played at the 2-A level. 
</P>
<P>
Palisades is represented by point guard Valerie Agee and guard Tamara Battle, 
Crossroads by guard Jamila Banks and point guard Faye Stapleton. 
</P>
<P>
Other all-stars are forward-center Melissa Punch of Culver City, point guard 
Judy R. Nakashima of Venice, guard-forward Terry Ginoza of University, guard 
Lisa Cohen of Los Angeles Westlake, center Nicole Harper of Marlborough and 
Princess Murray, who played point guard, forward and center for Fairfax. 
</P>
<P>
Repeaters from last year are Agee, Banks and Cohen, who was named All-Westside 
for the third consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
Capsule descriptions of each player: 
</P>
<P>
Agee -- She wanted the ball when the game was on the line. She averaged 24 
points, 12 rebounds and eight assists -- all team-high marks for the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
Banks -- The most valuable player in the Delphic League, she averaged 20.2 
points and 10 rebounds and had 45 blocks and 62 steals to lead the Roadrunners 
in all four categories. 
</P>
<P>
Battle -- The Metro League's most valuable player, she averaged 16.4 points, 
eight rebounds and two steals. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen -- Once again, she did almost everything for the Westlake Wildcats, the 
undefeated champions of the Sunshine League, and was her league's most valuable 
player after sharing the honor in 1988. She averaged 16.7 points, seven 
rebounds, 2.7 assists, 4.4 steals and 1.7 blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
Ginoza -- She shared most valuable player honors with Nakashima in the Western 
League, having averaged 18 points, six rebounds and four assists and shooting 
80% from the free throw line. 
</P>
<P>
Harper -- Marlborough Coach Ann DeBoe called her a "super inside player," and 
opposing coaches agreed. She averaged 16 rebounds and 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
Murray -- Played anywhere on the court, and her averages reflect her 
effectiveness: 14.3 points, eight rebounds, 3.6 steals and 2.8 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Nakashima -- She and Ginoza were the Western League's most valuable players. 
Her averages: 15.3 points, 3.4 steals, 3.7 assists and 4.3 rebounds. That's a 
lot of rebounding for a 5-foot, 2-inch point guard. 
</P>
<P>
Punch -- The All-Ocean League player gave Culver City its punch. She averaged 
17.7 points and 9.5 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Stapleton -- Crossroads Coach Larry Weiner said that his All-Delphic League 
player is "an outstanding point guard who controls the tempo of the game" and 
that her defense "is extremely good." She didn't score much (six points a 
game), but she averaged six assists, which meant that she was responsible for 
18 points a game. 
</P>

Crossroads -- Amy Gandin.
