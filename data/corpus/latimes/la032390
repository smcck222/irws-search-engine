Photo, 3 Cars Destroyed in Gasoline Blaze A tanker truck ignited while 
refilling underground tanks at the Thrifty Oil Co. gas station at Topanga 
Canyon Boulevard and Bassett Street in Canoga Park about noon Thursday. The 
fire was extinguished in about 15 minutes but closed a portion of Topanga 
Canyon Boulevard for about an hour. No one was hurt. Fire Department officials 
blamed the fire on gasoline that overflowed in one of the underground tanks and 
formed a pool along a Bassett Street curb. The gasoline was ignited when a 
driver parked her car there and turned off the engine. That car and two others 
were destroyed. STEWART HALUSKI / For The Times

MAN RECEIVES 14-YEAR SENTENCE FOR SHOOTING ARMORED CAR GUARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 28-year-old man was sentenced to 14 years in prison this week after a jury 
convicted him of gunning down an armored car guard during a foiled robbery 
attempt in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
After three days of deliberation in the second trial of Alfred Giordano, a 
Pasadena Superior Court jury found him guilty of attempted robbery and 
attempted murder in the Dec. 31, 1987, shooting that left security guard Howard 
White paralyzed. But the jury rejected an allegation that the shooting was 
premeditated, thereby reducing the maximum penalty from life in prison to 14 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Several hours later, Judge Terry Smerling issued a $100 fine and sentenced 
Giordano to the maximum 14 years, citing "the carefully planned nature of the 
robbery . . . the viciousness of the shooting . . . the racial overtones." 
</P>
<P>
White, a 34-year-old father of two who is black, was not present for the 
verdict or the sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly the robbery was premeditated," Smerling said as Giordano's mother 
and father looked on. "And incredibly serious injuries were suffered by Mr. 
White. It could very well have been a murder case." 
</P>
<P>
It was a quick and clear-cut ending to an unusual and sometimes bizarre court 
saga. 
</P>
<P>
Both Alfred and his brother, Peter Giordano, 33, were charged in 1988 with 
attempted murder and attempted robbery after White was shot outside a 
check-cashing service on San Fernando Road. Deputy Dist. Atty. Jo Ann Glidden 
contended that Alfred, using a Uzi semiautomatic rifle, gunned down White and 
unsuccessfully searched his canvas bag for money while Peter, 33, drove the 
getaway car. 
</P>
<P>
In a trial last May, no one could identify Peter Giordano as the getaway driver 
and he was acquitted. But three witnesses said they saw Alfred Giordano shoot 
White. Kimberly Giordano, Alfred's wife, testified that he told her how he had 
committed the crime and that he laughed about White's injuries and his race. 
</P>
<P>
But Kimberly Giordano also told jurors that Officer Joseph Jimenez, the 
Glendale police investigator in the case, had sex with her and coerced her to 
testify against her husband. White, when asked to point out his assailant, 
looked at the brothers, who were sitting together, and pointed at Peter 
Giordano. When asked by the prosecutor if he was sure, White said that he had 
meant to point at Alfred Giordano and had made a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, a mistrial was declared on the charges against Alfred Giordano 
after jurors deadlocked 11 to 1 in favor of conviction. The dissenting juror, 
prosecutors have said, was swayed by the testimony of Jeanette Russell, a 
witness who said Alfred was visiting her at the time of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Russell repeated the same testimony in the second trial, which began Feb. 15. 
But jurors said Tuesday her testimony was discounted. It was mainly the 
testimony by Kimberly Giordano that convinced them of Giordano's guilt, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
During the second trial, Kimberly Giordano reluctantly corroborated much of her 
earlier testimony about her husband's confession to her. 
</P>
<P>
"We went with the three eyewitnesses, and by and large, everyone seemed to buy 
Kimberly's story," said Richard McKinney, a dialogue writer for the TV show 
"L.A. Law." 
</P>
<P>
"No one for an instant believed Jeanette Russell" because she did not come 
forward with the alibi until long after Alfred Giordano's arrest, McKinney 
said.

OTTERS SERVE STUDY IN SURVIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Alaskan sea otter No. 600 arrived at Sea World in San Diego nearly one 
year ago, he was an oily mess. Rescue workers in Alaska had attempted to bathe 
him, but the otter's thick fur remained matted with a gooey coating of crude 
oil -- the spilled cargo of the grounded tanker Exxon Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
More life-threatening than No. 600's soiled pelt, however, were his own efforts 
to clean it. To maintain buoyancy and warmth, otters continually lick and groom 
their coats, and No. 600, like many otters caught in the worst spill in 
history, had ingested potentially fatal amounts of oil. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily for him, the March 24 disaster had prompted Sea World to develop an 
emergency antidote: powdered charcoal that absorbed the toxins and saved 
otters' lives. Today, as No. 600 and five other Valdez survivors tumble and 
frolic in a Sea World exhibit pool, the charcoal discovery stands out as one of 
the few positive results of the devastating spill. 
</P>
<P>
"As unpleasant an experience as the Valdez spill was, it proved to be a 
valuable learning tool," said Jim Antrim, Sea World's senior curator of marine 
mammals. "The treatments we developed in response to this spill could be 
instrumental, for example, in saving the threatened California sea otter, were 
a spill to occur in their habitat." 
</P>
<P>
According to Antrim, only 3,000 California sea otters remain -- a fragile 
population that could be wiped out by a large spill. In contrast, there are 
about 180,000 Alaskan sea otters, of which at least 1,000 died in the Valdez 
spill. 
</P>
<P>
Another 300 Alaskan sea otters were rescued from the shores off Bligh Reef in 
Prince William Sound, rehabilitated and returned to the wild, Antrim said. 
</P>
<P>
But the nine otters at Sea World are unlikely to return to the wild. No. 600 
and No. 599, whose names correspond to identification numbers that rescue 
workers assigned in Alaska, exhibit no obvious lingering symptoms, but are 
being monitored for long-term effects of oil ingestion. Babe, a 52-pound 
female, is nearly blind. Katie and three other pups were quite young when 
captured and have not learned survival skills. Brownie has a bone disease of 
the rear flippers, and Old Blue has an arthritic spine. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of repopulating Alaska's waters, then, these otters are helping teach 
park visitors the importance of protecting habitats. Since Sea World put the 
Valdez otters on display last summer, the exhibit has developed quite a 
following -- even a group that Antrim calls the "otter spotters," who visit 
regularly. 
</P>
<P>
The otters don't disappoint their fans. Whether chewing on shrimp, crab and 
clams or doing "whirlies," rapid underwater somersaults, the otters appear to 
delight in their 50-foot, 70,000-gallon outdoor pool. Even at rest, floating 
lazily on their backs as if atop invisible rafts, they are completely at home 
in the water. 
</P>
<P>
"Talk about the ultimate water bed," Antrim said, pointing at an otter who 
seemed to be napping afloat. "They have evolved so they can do literally 
everything in the water: eat, sleep, mate, give birth, nurse." 
</P>
<P>
Evolution had not prepared the otters for the 11 million gallons of crude oil 
that gummed up their home one year ago Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a like a curtain coming down on them," said Ron Britton, a biologist 
with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service who worked on the animal rescue effort 
in Alaska for five months. "Even if they tried swimming under it, they couldn't 
swim that far. So they'd surface, draped with this sticky goo, with oil in 
their eyes, in their mouths. There were probably some that just plain 
suffocated." 
</P>
<P>
Others died of exposure when the oil rendered their fur useless. Unlike other 
marine mammals, sea otters rely on their dense fur -- not an insulating layer 
of blubber -- for waterproofing and warmth. Oil-coated otters faced almost 
certain death from hypothermia or drowning. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, at the behest of the U.S. Department of the Interior, the Sea World 
Research Institute had studied techniques for removing oil from otters' fur. In 
experiments on 12 otters taken from the wild, scientists applied crude oils to 
fur and then tried to remove it. Over months, they discovered that repeated 
applications of dish-washing detergent and water would remove the residue. 
</P>
<P>
So, when five Valdez survivors arrived in San Diego on April 4, 1989, Sea World 
technicians knew how to clean their coats. They were unsure, however, how to 
remedy the internal damage suffered by otters that had swallowed oil, and, one 
by one, four of the five otters died of irreparable liver damage. 
</P>
<P>
Don Kent, executive director of the park's Research Institute, said that, once 
ingested, the oil began a vicious cycle in the otters' bodies. From the 
stomach, it went to the intestine, where it was absorbed into the blood. Once 
the blood was contaminated, the liver attempted to cleanse it by secreting 
bile, which ended up in the intestine and was absorbed into the blood again. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the activated charcoal mixture broke that cycle. By binding 
with the toxic hydrocarbons in the otters' intestinal tracts, the mixture 
allowed the animals to expel the poisons from their systems and begin to heal. 
Nine of the 13 otters that were flown to Sea World have survived. 
</P>
<P>
What long-term effects, if any, the crude oil will have on the otters is the 
subject of a continuing study, sponsored by Exxon Shipping Co. and conducted by 
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service in cooperation with the marine park. Of 
particular interest is the reproductive ability of the surviving otters. 
</P>
<P>
"A partial success will be if these otters produce young," Antrim said, as he 
watched No. 600 and one of the female otters engage in a frantic underwater 
embrace. "A total success would be if their young could reproduce also. We want 
to know -- were they genetically damaged?" 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lousy thing to have to learn," Kent said of the animal rescue 
techniques his staff helped develop. "We were cleaning up somebody else's mess 
instead of doing science. . . . But what it really taught us is there's no way 
to totally clean up the mess afterwards. You have to prevent it from happening 
in the first place."

EX-ADVERSARIES UNITE TO BACK ALL-YEAR CLASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Less than a year ago, Los Angeles schools Supt. Leonard Britton and teachers 
union President Wayne Johnson were opposing generals in the city's nine-day 
teachers strike, exchanging insults that to many seemed to demonstrate a 
genuine dislike between the two men. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, at one point during the strike, remarked that Britton was a 
"second-rate bozo" and the comment was aired on local television news shows. 
And Britton said publicly that his adversary was lying about negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
But with the strike long over, with teachers winning big raises, Britton and 
Johnson have apparently made their peace. They talked genially while eating 
chef's salads during a luncheon Thursday in Encino and put up a united front 
against criticism of year-round schools, as well as suggestions that the 
610,000-student school system be separated into smaller districts. 
</P>
<P>
"We are probably viewed as terrible adversaries," said Johnson, speaking to 
members of the Encino Chamber of Commerce. "But we do have a common goal: to 
make the changes in the district necessary to raise the achievement level of 
our students." 
</P>
<P>
Britton told the assembled business leaders that he and Johnson "are very much 
alike" in their beliefs of how best to improve the ailing school district. 
</P>
<P>
The chamber billed the event as a debate on year-round schools but it came 
closer to being a joint pitch for more local spending on Los Angeles public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
The school board last month voted to relieve classroom overcrowding by 
operating city schools on year-round schedules, beginning in the 1990-91 school 
year. Britton and Johnson said they agreed that running year-round schools is 
the most efficient way to handle the district's population boom, which is 
projected to continue through the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
West San Fernando Valley board member Julie Korenstein, who also spoke at the 
luncheon, said the only long-term solution is to build schools, but she said 
that this cannot be accomplished without higher local taxes. 
</P>
<P>
An $800-million statewide school construction bond is scheduled to go before 
voters in June, but district officials say that Los Angeles' share of that 
amount would be inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein said the district is hoping to put a measure on the June, 1991, 
ballot asking Los Angeles voters to approve a tax hike to pay for school 
construction. She said state law, however, must first be changed to allow such 
tax increases to be approved with a simple majority vote. Currently, such 
measures require a two-thirds majority, which is usually impossible to muster. 
</P>
<P>
Britton and Johnson said they oppose efforts based in the Valley to break up 
the school district, saying that plans to shift more power to local schools 
through governing councils of parents, teachers and school employees would 
accomplish much the same result by reducing district bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, displaying a bit of his past antagonism, told the group that many at 
the union office still describe the district's teaching philosophy as "stack 
'em deep and teach 'em cheap."

COMMISSION OKS 20-YEAR PLAN TO LIMIT GROWTH ON VENTURA BOULEVARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Planning Commission on Thursday formally endorsed a 20-year 
plan to control growth along Ventura Boulevard, saying that existing commercial 
property owners should help pay for traffic improvements to relieve traffic 
congestion caused by development. 
</P>
<P>
The five-member panel voted unanimously for the plan after more than four hours 
of discussion and comments from homeowners and developers, who seemed divided 
on the proposal. But several members of both camps urged the commission not to 
delay approving the plan, which took more than three years to formulate. 
</P>
<P>
"This plan is long overdue and balances all the affected interests -- 
homeowners, merchants and developers," Commission Vice President Theodore Stein 
Jr. said after the meeting. "While it may not be perfect, it's fair and it's 
equitable. If we worked on this plan for another year, we couldn't make a 
better one." 
</P>
<P>
Senior City Planner Bob Sutton agreed. "We're very pleased with the 
commission's action," he said. "They didn't make any substantial changes." 
</P>
<P>
Although some applause greeted the commission's approval, some homeowners and 
developers expressed dissatisfaction with the decision. Developer attorney 
Benjamin Reznik said the commission "rushed through" the plan without giving it 
proper consideration. "There are lots of loose ends in this," he said. "It's a 
patchwork plan." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Kramer of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. and Gerald Silver of 
Homeowners of Encino said the plan was not restrictive enough on development. 
"The way they've got it, developers can put tall buildings on top of three- to 
four-story parking structures," Kramer said. 
</P>
<P>
The plan now goes to the city attorney's office for analysis before coming to 
the Los Angeles City Council for final consideration. The city attorney's 
office will study the plan for about three or four months, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The plan would establish a limit of 8.6 million square feet of additional 
commercial development along the San Fernando Valley's main artery. That much 
new development would produce about 30,000 extra auto trips per hour during the 
afternoon rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
The existing 19 million square feet of commercial development along Ventura 
Boulevard generates about 70,000 auto trips a day. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed plan, about $42 million of the $200-million cost of proposed 
improvements would be divided among all commercial property owners along the 
boulevard, including developers of new projects. The fees to be assessed on 
developments are a critical element of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Planning Department had originally proposed last month to require 
developers of new projects to pay the entire cost of upgrading Ventura 
Boulevard to make it possible for it to handle more traffic without strain. 
</P>
<P>
But that plan would have faced legal challenges, according to the city 
attorney's office. Officials said that developers of new projects could only be 
assessed fees to mitigate the impact of traffic directly related to their 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Planners said lowering the fees that had been proposed for new development 
leaves a gap in the funding of the needed traffic improvements. But, they said, 
they are looking for new sources of money and are confident they will be able 
to make up the difference.

CEMENT COMPANY UNABLE TO FIND RADIOACTIVE GAUGE; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTIGATION: STATE AND FEDERAL OFFICIALS HUNTING FOR THE SENSOR NEAR GORMAN 
SAY IT DOESN'T POSE A HEALTH HAZARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A radioactive gauge is missing from a cement manufacturing plant near Gorman 
that is already under fire from environmentalists because it burns hazardous 
waste, and a two-week search has failed to find any trace of the gauge, company 
and state officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The National Cement Co. plant in Lebec is being investigated by state health 
officials, who said they expect to cite the company for mishandling the device. 
</P>
<P>
State and federal officials said the amount of radioactive material contained 
in the device is so small that it does not pose a public health hazard. 
</P>
<P>
The radioactive material was sealed inside a container that would prevent 
harmful exposure. And even if the material were somehow released, the level of 
radiation would not be strong enough to harm anyone nearby, said Greg Cook, a 
spokesman for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The missing gauge is just the latest in a series of problems for the cement 
plant, the only one in California permitted to burn hazardous wastes as fuel. 
Earlier this month, state health officials fined its operators $350,000 for 
burning too much waste in 1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest incident, plant workers and a state health inspector dug up areas 
of the nearby Lebec Landfill in Kern County on Monday thinking the gauge might 
have been accidentally thrown out, said Donald Bunn, an official with the state 
Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
Bunn, who is in charge of compliance for the state's radiologic health office, 
said the company will be cited for this incident and could face sanctions on 
its operating license or other legal action. 
</P>
<P>
The company reported the device missing on March 9. Plant Manager Byron 
McMichael said it had been removed from one building sometime earlier and was 
taken to a shop on the plant site to await reinstallation elsewhere. "We went 
to install it and we couldn't find it," McMichael said. 
</P>
<P>
Bunn said he believed the company was not authorized to remove the device and 
should not have left it in a shop. The company and a state health inspector 
searched the plant without success. Although the search has been suspended, the 
company is still questioning its employees about what might have become of the 
device, McMichael said. 
</P>
<P>
The device is described as a lead pipe about a foot long, containing 20 
millicuries of the radioactive material cesium-137. It was one of 19 sensors 
used at the plant that contains varying amounts of radioactive material. Such 
sensors are fairly common in industrial manufacturing uses, state officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the shielding were removed, a person would have to be closely exposed 
to the material for more than 83 hours to exceed the NRC's established annual 
exposure threshold for an individual, the NRC's Cook estimated. 
</P>
<P>
However, state and federal officials also said their policy is to keep 
radioactive material out of the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, a Gardena business that unknowingly melted what state officials believe 
may have been a similar device had to be temporarily closed and decontaminated 
last spring, Bunn said. 
</P>
<P>
The news that the plant had radioactive materials on site came as a surprise to 
local environmentalists. They said the loss of the gauge illustrates the 
unreliability of the plant's operations. 
</P>
<P>
"It just goes to show they can't be trusted with what they're doing," said 
Helen Thornburg, who is a leader of a local environmental group that has 
repeatedly protested that the burning of hazardous wastes endangers the health 
of area residents.

PANEL OKS SAN PEDRO REZONING PROPOSAL; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: MEASURE THAT WOULD EXCLUDE APARTMENT AND CONDOMINIUM DEVELOPMENT 
FROM OLD SAN PEDRO IS REJECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAY EVANS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Pedro citizens committee Wednesday night approved a detailed rezoning 
proposal, ending for now debate on the most contested section of a long-awaited 
community plan. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which downzones much of the community, is largely the same as the 
one presented in January to the San Pedro Community Plan Advisory Committee by 
its zoning subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
The committee rejected an amendment that would have excluded apartment and 
condominium development from the Old San Pedro area. That issue had caused 
angry exchanges between committee members at a meeting last month. 
</P>
<P>
In approving the plan -- based on a block-by-block review of the seaside 
community's zoning -- the committee limited comment among members and the 
public on specifics of the proposal, acknowledging that its decisions are not 
set in stone. 
</P>
<P>
"As (Ulysses S.) Grant said, 'I am prepared to fight this out all winter,' " 
said Noah Modisett, chairman of the advisory committee. "But we all know this 
is going to be changed, and we need to move ahead." 
</P>
<P>
When the community plan is finished -- including a proposed historic zone and a 
specific plan for the downtown business area -- it will go to Councilwoman Joan 
Milke Flores and then to the Planning Department, which must hold public 
hearings. 
</P>
<P>
The limited debate at Wednesday's session was considerably toned down from the 
contentiousness in San Pedro about these issues, which include preserving 
historic homes, encouraging construction of low-cost senior housing and saving 
the Barton Hill area for low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents and committee members backed off previous hard-line positions on 
those issues after Modisett passed around a letter from a city planner praising 
the committee's work. 
</P>
<P>
"The important fact is that your committee has given us a good point to start 
this process," wrote Don K. Taylor of the Planning Department. "The proposal 
must still go through a long public hearing process. The decision will 
eventually be made by the City Council. You should expect that even your best 
proposals may be subject to modification as we hear from the public during this 
process." 
</P>
<P>
The committee was appointed by Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores in 1988 to help 
guide future growth in an area of Los Angeles that has undergone dramatic 
growth and development in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
Zoning recommendations approved Wednesday include: 
</P>
<P>
Permitting developers in most of Old San Pedro -- the neighborhood that runs 
from 10th to 21st streets between Palos Verdes Street and Pacific Avenue -- to 
build three units on a lot, subject to "certain design standards to be 
established by the committee." 
</P>
<P>
Substantially increasing the density allowed on the block bounded by 8th, 9th, 
Centre and Mesa streets, but "only if the property is developed for senior 
citizens." 
</P>
<P>
Zoning Rancho San Pedro, a city-owned, low-income housing project, for 
single-family housing as a way of preserving the project. Any other type of 
development would be subject to a public hearing process. It is now zoned 
mostly for duplexes. 
</P>
<P>
Allowing commercial and manufacturing development on Harbor Boulevard from 3rd 
Street north to the Harbor Freeway on-ramp to discourage development of housing 
there. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, in a 12-5 vote, defeated an amendment to the plan that would 
have virtually excluded development of anything but single-family homes in the 
Old San Pedro area after nearly an hour of discussion. 
</P>
<P>
Committee member Doug Shepardson proposed the amendment last month, saying 
single-family zoning would encourage the preservation of older houses. He said 
that under the recommendations accepted Wednesday night, it would be more 
profitable for developers to raze older homes for apartments and condominiums. 
In recent years, hundreds of old homes have been torn down by developers 
attracted to the area by soaring land values. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the amendment argued that many older houses in the area are 
dilapidated, and said new, controlled development of condominiums would be the 
best way to improve the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the amendment's defeat, most preservation advocates cautiously endorsed 
a wording change that ensures the committee will determine design and setback 
restrictions for any condominium development in the area. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, some preservationists found a grain of victory in the defeat 
because some of the amendment's opponents had begun to speak openly of the 
importance of preserving single-family homes in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
"Now they are all talking about historic preservation. There is a definite 
change in the tone of this committee," said Bill Manuel, a local lawyer and 
preservation advocate. "That's a victory of sorts." 
</P>
<P>
Preservationists hope to create a historic preservation zone in Old San Pedro 
to set architectural and landscaping requirements for the area. Manuel, who is 
chairman of the historic preservation subcommittee, will present 
recommendations for the establishment of the historic zone at the committee's 
April meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Though the committee seemed content to approve the entire zoning plan in the 
interest of moving forward, some members said the proposal to downzone the 
Barton Hill neighborhood to allow only single-family homes could push out 
lower-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
"If we change the zoning in that neighborhood (to allow only single-family 
homes), we will gentrify the area. We will place people who live there out of 
the market so they cannot live there," said committee member Armando Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez said the proposed change could prevent the residents in the mostly 
Latino area from building rental units on their property, which they do to 
supplement their income, and said it would also encourage its "yuppification." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to change the . . . area so much that we don't recognize it 20 
years from now," said Barton Hill resident Nadine Janisee. 
</P>
<P>
But Leron Gubler, chairman of the zoning subcommittee and executive director of 
the Chamber of Commerce, said the proposed zoning changes would protect the 
Barton Hill area because it would trigger a public hearing process for any 
multiunit development. 
</P>
<P>
Having put the hotly contested zoning questions behind it, the advisory 
committee will meet again in April to take up discussion of the Historic 
Preservation Overlay Zone and other issues.

PROSECUTOR SAYS PEARCE SHOULD DIE FOR 'VILE' ORCHESTRATION OF MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Roberta Pearce should die in the gas chamber because she not only premeditated 
the killing of her estranged husband but also hired two teen-agers -- "boys in 
men's bodies" -- to do the job, the prosecutor said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In closing arguments for the case's penalty phase, Deputy Dist. Atty. Tim 
Casserly told a Vista Superior Court jury that Pearce is unworthy of sympathy 
and a life sentence because the way she orchestrated the killing of Wayne 
Pearce was "evil, vile and calls for the death penalty." 
</P>
<P>
But Pearce's attorney, Brad Patton, making a final bid to save the life of the 
42-year-old former Escondido teacher's aide, implored jurors to consider how 
Pearce was devastated and irrational when her husband of 14 1/2 years left her 
and she realized she would never have his baby. 
</P>
<P>
"She was down on her knees, it was her lowest point," he said, describing the 
two weeks she contemplated the crime as a "period of aberration" in an 
otherwise normal, decent life. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors will receive instructions from Judge Franklin Mitchell Jr. early Friday 
and begin deliberations on their two choices -- death or life in prison without 
the possibility of parole for Pearce. 
</P>
<P>
She was convicted March 12 of first-degree murder with special circumstances 
and conspiring to commit murder in her husband's death on Jan. 31, 1989. The 
special circumstances that could bring the death sentence are murder for 
financial gain and lying in wait. 
</P>
<P>
The jury agreed that Pearce had her husband killed to get his $200,000 life 
insurance benefits so she could keep the couple's Valley Center ranch house for 
herself and her pets. 
</P>
<P>
In choosing the penalty, Casserly argued Thursday that jurors shouldn't base a 
decision on her formerly productive life, but on her crime. "There's no way you 
can insulate yourself from the death penalty by hiring someone else to do your 
dirty work for you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Who did she hire in this case? Kids!" he said. "Not sophisticated hit men, she 
involved kids in her crime, boys in men's bodies." 
</P>
<P>
Doing that was especially sinister considering that Pearce had been a teacher's 
aide, Casserly said. "For a teacher to use and abuse (her) position of trust . 
. . that's particularly vile," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As for the actual killing Jan. 31, 1989, by Isaac Hill and Anthony Pilato, who 
were 15 then and were sentenced to the California Youth Authority for their 
first-degree murder convictions, Casserly said, "There are ways of killing that 
are quick, efficient and painless." 
</P>
<P>
But Pearce, he stated, knew the boys intended to stab her husband. He received 
23 wounds from a kitchen knife and a carpenter's hand ax, and later died at the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Casserly said that, when the hospital called Pearce about her husband, she 
showed no remorse, but was angry with Hill and Pilato, telling them, "You guys 
blew it."' 
</P>
<P>
The nature of the crime and the motive, money, were aggravating factors that 
outweighed other factors such as Pearce's clean record and previously 
constructive life, Casserly argued. Thus, there isn't sufficient reason to 
spare her from the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
However, Patton maintained that in cases involving a potential death penalty, 
only aggravating factors that weren't an element of the crime can be considered 
in sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
He declared that Pearce is hardly among "the worst of the worst" who deserve 
the death sentence. That is usually reserved for serial or random killers who 
act without feeling and without motive, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Patton depicted Pearce as a woman whose life and ability to reason simply came 
apart when her husband walked out, leaving her without hope of having another 
child -- she had two by a previous marriage -- and unable to support herself or 
keep the house for her and her pets. 
</P>
<P>
She was in a "tailspin" and "thinking crazy things," he said.

JUDGE WAGNER IS DEAD AT 54 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Andrew G. Wagner has died after a lengthy illness, court 
officials said Thursday. He was 54. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner, a family law expert who served as a judge for about three years, died 
Wednesday night at his home after a months-long fight with cancer, court 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Andy will be sorely missed by everyone who knew him," said Judith McConnell, 
the court's presiding judge. "We treasured his sense of humor, and he was an 
extraordinary judge." 
</P>
<P>
Wagner's death leaves the 71-member Superior Court with two vacancies. Judge 
Don Martinson retired Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner was appointed to the bench April 29, 1987, initially handling family law 
matters at Vista Superior Court. Later, he supervised the civil law and motion 
department at the downtown San Diego courthouse and also heard criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Wagner was one of nine San Diego judges serving on a special 
program designed to speedily resolve civil cases. Under the program, control of 
a case is assigned to a single judge, a departure from the traditional system 
under which a case floats from judge to judge as it moves toward trial. 
</P>
<P>
Before taking the bench, Wagner practiced law for 18 years with the San Diego 
firm of Milch, Wolfsheimer &amp; Wagner. He practiced four years before that 
with the firm of Prochazka, Conaway &amp; Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
From 1969 to 1987, Wagner also taught family law at Western State University in 
San Diego. When he was appointed to the bench, he was a director of the San 
Diego County Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner earned his law degree in 1964 from Cal Western. He graduated in 1963 
from San Diego State University. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner is survived by his wife, Municipal Court Judge Marge Wagner; three 
children, Alison Ann Wagner, Holly Jennifer Bryan and Melissa Stephanie Bryan; 
his mother, Edna Wagner of Milford, Conn.; a sister, Joan Matosko of Stratford, 
Conn., and a brother, John Jaeckel of Paso Robles. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service is scheduled for Wednesday at United Methodist Church in 
Encinitas, court officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Flags at the county courthouses will be lowered to half-staff in Wagner's honor 
for a week, McConnell said.

... BUT JUSTICE GRINDS TOO SLOWLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peace may be rapidly approaching in El Salvador, but justice is moving too 
slowly. The Cristiani government must not delude itself into thinking it can 
delay bringing the murderers of six Jesuit priests to justice until the United 
States loses interest. Unless the current investigation into the killings comes 
to a prompt, conclusive and convincing end, Congress should cut off the $1.5 
million in U.S. aid that country gets each day. 
</P>
<P>
The priests, all of whom were on the faculty of the respected and influential 
University of Central America, were dragged from their quarters and shot to 
death during heavy fighting last November. Two bystanders, the clerics' cook 
and her 15-year-old daughter, also were killed because they witnessed the 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
Despite initial government claims that the atrocity had been carried out by 
Marxist rebels, suspicion quickly focused on the Salvadoran military. The 
murderers were dressed in uniforms and carried standard Salvadoran army-issue 
rifles. The area around the university was firmly controlled by government 
troops the night of the killings, and a general curfew was in force. 
</P>
<P>
After much delay, charges finally were filed against five enlisted men and four 
officers, including Col. Guillermo A. Benavides Moreno, who commanded the 
country's military academy at the time of the massacre. Since then, according 
to a report by Times correspondent Kenneth Freed, the investigation into the 
case against the soldiers has slowed to a judicial crawl. Even the U.S. Embassy 
in San Salvador has become frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
American diplomats are angry not only with the pace of inquiry but also with 
the official solicitude being shown Benavides. The colonel reportedly receives 
daily visits from brother officers, who are said to assure him that he will not 
be punished. Those familiar with Salvadoran politics aren't surprised, as 
Benavides is a ranking member of the military academy graduating class whose 
members currently control the armed forces' high command. No Salvadoran officer 
ever has been convicted of a human-rights abuse. To this day, for example, the 
men suspected of involvement in the infamous 1980 assassination of Archbishop 
Oscar Romero remain free. 
</P>
<P>
No such miscarriage of justice is acceptable now. One benefit of communism's 
global retreat is that rightist thugs like those who lurk within the Salvadoran 
military and Cristiani's Arena party no longer command automatic U.S. support 
as the lesser of two evils. The Jesuits killed last November were not only 
leading intellectuals; they were powerful voices for moderation and peace in El 
Salvador. If the Cristiani government fails to call the murderers to account, 
it will forfeit all claim on U.S. support.

LITHUANIAN INDEPENDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In part your editorial "Terrific -- But Go Slow, Please," March 13) on 
Lithuania's independence was terrific, in part it was not so terrific. The 
important issue to the U.S. and the world is not the speed but the peaceful 
parliamentary approach used to re-establish Lithuania's independence. 
</P>
<P>
There is no question that the new parliament will safeguard the rights of the 
minorities since this policy has always been stressed by Sajudis, Lithuania's 
reform movement, in control of the new government. 
</P>
<P>
We hoped that your editorial would urge the U.S. to firmly support Lithuania's 
independence without antagonizing the Soviet Union, to invite the new president 
to Washington and to promise humanitarian aid in case of an economic blockade. 
We expected you to urge Gorbachev to withdraw the Soviet army and the KGB from 
Lithuania and to negotiate economic issues. 
</P>
<P>
We wanted you to urge other countries and the United Nations to support 
Lithuania in its extremely difficult struggle to regain independence.

LITHUANIAN INDEPENDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In speaking of events in Lithuania and the Soviet Union, the CNN reporter said 
of Gorbachev: "Lithuanians will provide an early test of his presidential 
mettle." Well, the same applies to President Bush! 
</P>
<P>
We want to see some proof that he is not the wimp that some people have accused 
him of being. 
</P>
<P>
Will he have the guts to stand up for the freedom of Lithuania? He seems to 
have conveniently forgotten that the United States had never recognized the 
Baltic states to be legally part of the Soviet Union. We heard him talk on CNN: 
"Well, we have to wait and see, who'll be in charge of this territory . . . and 
it must all be peaceful. . . ." Since when is there any question about the land 
of Lithuania belonging to its people? They certainly have gone about their 
declaration of independence in a peaceful and orderly fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Does Bush now mean that if the Russians send in their tanks and start killing 
people in the streets as they did in Hungary and Czechoslovakia "things won't 
be peaceful" and therefore he washes his hands of the whole thing? 
</P>
<P>
There were suspicions about his behavior at the time of the Tian An Men Square 
massacre and subsequent covert dealings with the Chinese government. Now his 
abandonment of Lithuania will serve as further proof of his lack of strength to 
stand up against the true enemies of the free world. It's easy to throw your 
weight around invading poor run-down countries like Panama or Libya, but now 
that he has to match his strength against that of Gorbachev he might come off a 
poor second in the eyes of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Will he show his mettle and support free Lithuania, or remain sitting on the 
fence?

UC ADMISSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the University of California notifies freshmen applicants of their admission 
status, a pattern of discrimination becomes increasingly obvious. Asians and 
whites are rejected in favor of blacks and Hispanics with far lower GPAs and 
SAT scores and fewer advanced placement courses. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, only 60% of the incoming freshman class is accepted solely on the 
basis of competitive GPA/SAT criteria. 
</P>
<P>
UC officials invariably cite Assembly Concurrent Resolution 83 to justify such 
admission policies. ACR 83, however, calls for actions that "will strengthen 
the college preparation of low-income and under-represented minority students." 
It does not call for racial preference in admission policies. 
</P>
<P>
Racial admission quotas were expressly prohibited by the Supreme Court in the 
1978 Bakke decision. While UC speaks in terms of "goals" and not the forbidden 
word "quotas," there appears little distinction between the two in practice. 
</P>
<P>
Practicing discrimination in the name of fighting discrimination is wrong. To 
assert otherwise is to deny equal protection of the laws and affirm the 
proposition that two wrongs make a right.

OK, WE STILL DON'T KNOW; 
</P>
<P>
CENSUS BUREAU TRIED, BUT COUNTING HOMELESS IS TOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How many homeless people live in the United States? Seven million, insists 
Mitch Snyder, an advocate who works on behalf of the homeless in Washington. 
Others say that the number may be as low as 250,000. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Census Bureau Tuesday night tried for the first time to determine what 
the true number is. The enumerators concentrated initially on canvassing 
shelters and cheap hotels before fanning out to parks, alleys, highway 
underpasses and far more dangerous places. The ambitious effort was flawed. 
Census monitors found many homeless people who were not counted. Still, the 
tally was the first systematic attempt to count the nation's down and out. 
</P>
<P>
Census officials made no pretense of coming up with a complete count. They had 
hoped for a fairly accurate picture of the nation's shelters and flophouses, as 
well as a glimpse of who the homeless are. But if more such efforts are 
necessary in the future, a second survey of the shelters should be taken within 
a week to provide a comparison, and allow for an estimate that could make up 
for any undercount. 
</P>
<P>
And, let there be no doubt, there was an undercount. Wide areas went unchecked 
in South-Central Los Angeles, for example. Census officials have acknowledged 
an undercount of migrant workers in North San Diego County, and a recount is 
planned there -- possibly the only one in the nation. Finding people who sleep 
in canyons and fields, sometimes literally in holes in the ground miles from a 
road, is one of most difficult tasks for census workers and will require 
special procedures. The accuracy of the count in Orange County was complicated 
by the tendency of homeless people there to drop out of sight, especially at 
night. Field enumerators were surprised they found so few of the homeless 
living on the streets. Many retreat to cars or cheap motels after dark. 
</P>
<P>
Homeless people are mobile. Some are cynical about contact with government 
institutions. Others are mentally ill or just plain scared. But they are also 
among the poorest Americans and stand to benefit from a more equitable 
distribution of the $30 billion in federal aid allocated to cities and counties 
based on census figures. 
</P>
<P>
There may be no way to determine, without controversy, how many homeless people 
the special tally missed. But while the totals are incomplete, the needs are 
clearly there, and they are great. That alone must prompt the government to 
invest more in health care, job training and affordable housing to help them.

LITHUANIAN INDEPENDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sajudis, the Lithuanian grass-roots political organization, has conducted a 
policy of non-discrimination toward minorities in that country. 
</P>
<P>
A brief examination of the record would reveal not a single incident of 
religious or ethnic discrimination on its part. 
</P>
<P>
Admonitions from the White House in this regard are, therefore, unnecessary and 
unwelcome. White House support for the full restoration of independence to 
Lithuania, on the other hand, would be most welcome. It would be a courageous 
act for the United States to give unqualified support to democratic movements 
in the countries forcibly incorporated into the Soviet bloc 50 years ago.

ROHRABACHER'S OIL STANCE CRITICIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With chagrin I read about Rep. Dana Rohrabacher's (R-Lomita) current 
pro-offshore oil-drilling stand. This lack of concern for the environment, this 
utter disregard for his constituents' wishes, this unconscionable about-face, 
(his office was contacted before his election and we were assured of his 
anti-drilling stance) exhibit extremely poor judgment and disqualify him as our 
representative in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Rohrabacher has been ill-advised. Voters are independent thinkers and 
cannot be led by the nose, regardless of party affiliation. The matter of 
offshore oil-drilling is of vital importance to us. Unless Rep. Rohrabacher 
clearly restates his position, it is with great regret that, for the first time 
in decades, my family and many fellow concerned Republicans will have to vote 
for a Democrat.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A consulting firm that last month dismissed the feasibility of putting a major 
commercial airport at Brown Field reported Thursday that a new facility there 
might be possible if aircraft could occasionally approach over Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Haney, senior manager for KPMG Peat Marwick, told a San Diego Assn. of 
Governments panel that a two-runway airport on Otay Mesa could handle 200,000 
takeoffs and landings yearly, or about the number of airliners accommodated at 
Lindbergh Field last year. 
</P>
<P>
The airport would have to be part of a multiple-airport configuration using 
both an expanded Brown Field and Lindbergh to handle the region's air traffic, 
Haney said. 
</P>
<P>
In a March 12 letter distributed at Thursday's meeting, Haney told a Sandag 
official that "we recently submitted a report indicating that two suggested 
sites on (Otay) Mesa do not appear feasible because of airspace problems. We 
hope that we did not convey the impression that there were not alternatives 
that might prove attractive." 
</P>
<P>
Haney proposed an airport consisting of a realigned 12,000-foot runway at Brown 
Field parallel to Tijuana International Airport, and a 9,000-foot 
northwest-to-southeast runway east of Brown Field. 
</P>
<P>
The configuration would require aircraft landing from the southeast to approach 
over Mexican airspace about 25% of the time, necessitating "a combined 
U.S./Mexican air traffic control arrangement." Planes bound for Mexico and the 
United States could alternate using the approach area, Haney said. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Haney's firm told Sandag that two proposed layouts for an Otay Mesa 
airport are not possible because the nearby San Ysidro Mountains would force 
much steeper than normal takeoffs and landings.

GERMANY NEUTRAL FROM WHAT?;

<P>
THAT 'SPECIAL PATH' LEADS NOWHERE;

<P>
 THE SUCCESS OF A UNIFIED NATION WILL NOT BE IN SWAYING BETWEEN TWO WORLDS BUT 
IN STANDING WITH ITS NEIGHBORS.

International Peace as a senior associate after seven years as deputy director

<P>
Despite the public posturing, the bottom line is that no one really wants a 
neutral Germany -- not the Russians, not the Germans, not Germany's European 
neighbors, not the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet position calling for neutrality has been hammered out in heated 
debate between the entrenched conservative bureaucracy in Moscow, which has 
ruled German policy for decades, and a looser grouping of advisers to Mikhail 
Gorbachev, many with extensive German backgrounds. Faced with the breathtaking 
pace of German unity, however, the second group is now gaining the upper hand. 
They would prefer that the United States remain in Europe as an element of 
stability, and they would like to see a Germany bound to Western structures 
rather than an independent Germany obliged to none, provided that Germany 
pledges to reduce its military forces to a low level and not produce atomic, 
chemical and biological weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The Germans also reject neutrality. The hype that continues to surround the 
issue stands in stark contrast to West German government statements and public 
opinion polls that clearly oppose neutrality. Chancellor Helmut Kohl has 
repeatedly reaffirmed West German opposition to any "special German path." Kohl 
and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher understand very clearly the core 
element of Germany's success in the past and for the future -- a process of 
change toward a more open, prosperous and free Europe in which the nation in 
the center, Germany, is bound tightly to its neighbors in a dense network of 
economic, political, social and military linkages. The chancellor has stated 
over and over again that the history of the 20th Century "shows that nothing is 
more detrimental to the stability of Europe than a Germany swaying between two 
worlds, between West and East." 
</P>
<P>
Kohl is right. The basic fact remains that due to history and geography, 
Germany's world will always be complicated by the necessity of balancing 
seemingly conflicting interests and by the possibility of rekindling resentment 
and fear. West Germany's success has been due in large measure to its efforts 
to stand together with its neighbors rather than stand apart. 
</P>
<P>
To be neutral is to be aloof. A true neutral must prove constantly that it is 
dependent on no one else and subject to no one else's rule or laws. The 
emergence of a boldly independent Germany, obliged to none, would be a 
dangerous and de-stabilizing development. Such a Germany could switch 
coalitions and alliances, shifting the balance of power with each turn. Such a 
Germany would be a source of anxiety and a target of manipulation. Such a 
Germany would be incalculable -- the very opposite of the rather predictable 
West Germany that has been both product and pillar of the Western Alliance. 
Such a new Germany would become the arbiter of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
During the Cold War, neutrality was a symbol for various, often conflicting, 
desires. In East Germany the vision of neutrality, which was linked to the 
vision of a "third way" between Stalinist socialism and raw capitalism, gained 
a certain appeal as an expression of emancipation from the Soviet Union. In 
both East and West Germany, the term also reflected an exhaustion with being 
the militarized front line in the Cold War. For the peace movements in both 
Germanys, neutrality was the buzz word for a new German mission to heal 
Europe's divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the East Germans have emancipated themselves and Europe's divisions 
are being overcome and the frozen military blocs are melting, the idea of 
neutrality itself, defined only in terms of membership in such blocs, is 
already out of date. Neutral from whom? Or, more importantly, neutral from what 
-- from what values? The values of democracy, freedom and the rule of law have 
not only swept through all of Germany, they are sweeping through Eastern Europe 
to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The end of the blocs has already dissipated the traditional notion of 
neutrality itself. All of the current European neutrals -- Austria, 
Switzerland, Finland, Sweden and Ireland -- have lost part of their modern 
identity and are now scrambling for new roles. They are all discovering the 
prohibitive cost of insisting on complete independence in an interdependent 
world. 
</P>
<P>
By focusing on terms defined by the 40 years of the Cold War, we ignore the 
more significant challenges before us. We are not facing German or Soviet 
pressure for a neutral Germany swaying between two well-defined blocs. Our 
challenge, for which we do not yet seem prepared, is quite another -- to move 
beyond the current European security order to a durable, self-regulating, 
democratically legitimized system of pan-European security in which the notions 
of neutrality and blocs become irrelevant.

WHEN COLD FUSION GOT HOT, IT RAPIDLY FIZZLED; 
</P>
<P>
SCIENCE: THE PROMISE OF UNLIMITED ENERGY SET OFF A FRENZY OF ACTIVITY. BUT 
PUBLICITY ALONE COULDN'T MAKE CLAIMS OF A BREAKTHROUGH TRUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Cold fusion" was born a year ago today when chemists Martin Fleischmann andB. 
Stanley Pons at the University of Utah held a press conference to announce that 
they had tamed the process of nuclear fusion. 
</P>
<P>
Their claim was novel and the apparatus simple -- a rod of palladium, a battery 
and a jar of water. The promise of unlimited energy set off a frenzy of 
activity and publicity as researchers everywhere rushed to confirm the Utah 
results. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists would have been ecstatic if cold fusion had been real. But publicity 
alone didn't make it true. Confirmation by independent researchers was the only 
way to be sure. Regrettably, the present consensus is that Pons and Fleischmann 
were simply wrong. This follows not from prejudice, but from many careful 
experiments performed and thoroughly documented by interdisciplinary teams 
using apparatus far more sophisticated than that available to the Utah 
researchers. The continuing claims of a few "believers" are plagued by 
irreproducibility, inconsistencies and the absence of peer-reviewed 
publication. Most telling, however, is that nobody else can make cold fusion 
work. 
</P>
<P>
The research community responded as it should have. Chemists, physicists and 
materials scientists dropped work in progress and focused on the fusion claims. 
Results emerged -- with surprising speed -- from universities, national 
laboratories and industry. While it is disappointing that this effort came to 
naught, validation is an integral part of the scientific process. Any 
phenomenon that doesn't fit our understanding of the physical world stimulates 
a scientist's curiosity. High-temperature superconductivity is an example where 
the process had a more favorable outcome. 
</P>
<P>
Cold fusion underscores the interdisciplinary nature of today's science. The 
concept intertwines chemistry, materials science, condensed-matter physics and 
nuclear physics. Complete knowledge of all these fields is simply too much for 
any one scientist to master. This doesn't diminish the role of individual 
initiative and creativity, but today's science requires cooperation among 
experts in the various disciplines. Indeed, scientists racing to test the Utah 
claims immediately formed teams to pool their talents and experience. If Pons 
and Fleischmann would have done so in their early experiments, cold fusion 
might have expired quietly. 
</P>
<P>
Instantaneous communication among scientists is now possible through the fax 
machines and computer networks that link laboratories around the globe. These 
tools hastened cold fusion research, but the giant game of "telephone" also 
corrupted information and spread rumors. It accounted for the speed with which 
the scientific community moved to test the idea, as well as for much of the 
confusion in the days after the Utah announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Manipulation of the popular media was instrumental in creating and sustaining 
the furor. Spectacular claims, such as the observation of nuclear reactions, 
were publicized without sufficient details to allow informed judgment by other 
scientists. Reports of heat production greatly exaggerated the tiny effects 
that researchers had actually measured. Reporters who sought independent 
assessments were hampered by scientists' natural hesitation to judge the work 
of others without knowing the details. As the facts became fully known, all of 
the highly touted claims were withdrawn or severely qualified. The usual 
procedure of peer review and full publication in a scientific journal is 
circumvented only at one's peril. 
</P>
<P>
Pressure for funding distorted the scientific process but couldn't derail it. 
The Utah Legislature committed $5 million to a National Cold Fusion Institute 
on the assurances of a panel made up largely of businessmen, lawyers and 
publicists. To its credit, the federal government sought better scientific 
advice. An expert group commissioned by the Department of Energy visited all of 
the laboratories claiming to have observed cold fusion. Its members didn't see 
a single "working" device, even in the lab of Fleischmann and Pons. Qualified 
peer review remains the best method to allocate our precious and limited 
research funding. 
</P>
<P>
Modern science is a most exciting endeavor. While progress occurs at an 
astounding rate, most advances are not widely publicized. Similarly, the errors 
that do (and must) occur are quietly corrected through the scientific process. 
True progress withstands the test of time. Although cold fusion excited our 
imagination, in the end it was just another corrected mistake. Thus, the 
lessons it teaches are more important than the experiments themselves. We 
scientists, the media and the curious public would do well to remember them 
when trumpets herald the next unverified discovery.

ANOTHER HIGH-ROLLER WITH FEET OF CLAY; 
</P>
<P>
COVENANT HOUSE: THE RECTOR OF THE RUNAWAYS KNEW HOW TO TUG THE HEARTSTRINGS. 
HIS TROUBLES CAME WITH PURSE STRINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN McCARTHY, Colman McCarthy is a syndicated columnist in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Giovanni Francesco Bernadone, the 13th-Century Italian soldier who gave up 
war-making to serve the poor and became St. Francis of Assisi, advised his 
followers to avoid money, power and fame. After that, do it twice as hard. 
</P>
<P>
For a time, America's favorite Franciscan was Father Bruce Ritter. Like the 
founder of his order, the priest reached out to the scorned and wretched. In 
1969, he took in homeless kids, most of them runaways barely surviving on New 
York's streets: They came to his East Greenwich Village tenement apartment. 
When the flow increased, he founded Covenant House near Times Square. It would 
quickly become both a legend and a beacon. 
</P>
<P>
Now, after months of publicity over allegations of sexual liaisons, shady money 
deals and favoritism, Ritter has resigned as director of his organization. Last 
week, new charges about a secret trust fund of nearly $1 million and payments 
of $350,000 in contract fees to relatives placed Ritter still further away from 
the Franciscan spirit that was part of his early appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The priest is the latest in a wide pew of high-rolling reverends who, with 
computerized donor lists for electronic panhandling, access to politicians and 
CEOs, and a media given over to press agentry, turn out to have feet of clay -- 
and legs, upper trunk and arms, too. 
</P>
<P>
Americans, with a national penchant for hero worship, had in Ritter a model for 
something higher: saint worship. A 1981 front-page story in the Wall Street 
Journal took everything that Ritter said as gospel. By then, he was well into 
major fund-raising, taking both foundation and government money, along with the 
widow's mite. The $12-million budget in 1981 would rise to $85 million by the 
end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Every tax-deductible, nonprofit organization with an income over $25,000 is 
required by the IRS to provide a financial statement to anyone asking for it. 
Maybe all was well during the buildup years, maybe not. Who was checking -- 
staffers earning $90,000? Ritter's operation in 1988 was nearly twice the size 
of the federal government's funding for runaway-youth programs, except no 
General Accounting Office was on hand to monitor what happened to money sent in 
by some 650,000 donors. While Ritter passed the hat, an unquestioning media 
passed the buck. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the secular press has trouble holding the popular clergy to standards 
routinely applied to other public figures. Religion, like entertainment, can be 
a business of appearances. It shouldn't be a sacrilege to look at one of the 
haloed and wonder, "If we give him a free ride will we end being taken for a 
ride?" 
</P>
<P>
Ritter was a favorite of Ronald Reagan. In 1984, the President stationed the 
priest in the gallery for the State of the Union address and had him take a bow 
as an "unsung hero." The next year Ritter signed on as a member of Edwin 
Meese's commission on pornography. George Bush toured Covenant House last 
November, shortly after Georgetown University conferred an honorary degree on 
Ritter. 
</P>
<P>
If the political right was thanking the Lord for a man known as the Rector of 
the Runaways, so was the religious right. Such Catholic money men as J. Peter 
Grace, the billionaire chemical CEO, and William Simon, Treasury secretary 
under Richard Nixon, became Covenant House angels. 
</P>
<P>
Although not frequent, it is common enough in Catholic religious orders that 
members become untethered to the community after hearing the applause of 
secular society. Instead of staying on their knees, they stay on their toes -- 
for the big donation, the fatter grant and the splashier promo. In the 
mid-1960s, the award-winning novel "Morte D'Urban," by J. F. Powers, told the 
tale of a religious-order priest who was snared not by wine, women or song but 
by the thrills of fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
Ritter, who denies all charges of wrongdoing, became too big for the humble 
Franciscans. He was also beyond the control of another group -- social workers 
who ran programs for runaways. They criticized his establishing large-size -- 
not small -- shelters, and then locating them in prostitution zones. That, said 
a runaway-youth official in a 1983 federal survey, is like using a tavern for a 
meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
Ritter, whose mass-mail fund-raising letters were models of unction speaking of 
God's mercy toward "His kids whom He loves so much," brought in gobs of money. 
He knew how to tug the heartstrings. His troubles came with purse strings.

'WHY NOT PADRES?' MCKEON ASKS

<P>
It's happening. Right before their eyes. Once again. 
</P>
<P>
Pick up any preseason baseball publication. Turn to any TV channel. Read any 
newspaper. Scan the radio dial. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, who broke the hearts of their fans and made fools of the experts 
last year, are once again the overwhelming pick to win the National League 
West. 
</P>
<P>
The prognosticators ignore the fact that the Padres lost their Cy Young winner 
in the off-season when reliever Mark Davis took his 44 saves to Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
They forget that the Padres lack an everyday player in left field and have a 
crap shoot at third base and a risk at shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
They disregard the team's history of winning only one division title in its 21 
years, finishing higher than fourth just four times. 
</P>
<P>
There are hundreds of reasons that Jack McKeon, manager and vice 
president/baseball operations, can reel off as to why the Padres should not be 
picked to win the division. 
</P>
<P>
Who wants the kiss of death anyway, right? 
</P>
<P>
But Thursday morning, after addressing his complete squad for the first time 
this season, McKeon couldn't help himself. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe he was fired up by his own 20-minute pep talk, the one that he concludes 
each year by saying, "Winning is fun, and fun is winning." Maybe it was the sun 
baking down upon his head. Maybe it was the breakfast cereal. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reason, McKeon dared anyone to go ahead and come up with reasons 
why the Padres won't win the division. Pick the Dodgers, he said, they should 
be favored anyway. Pick the Cincinnati Reds, they have the most talent. Go on 
the limb and pick the Atlanta Braves . . . they figure to be the league's most 
improved team. 
</P>
<P>
But if you're smart, if you must pick a team to win the National League West in 
your office pool, McKeon said to go ahead and write down the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
Don't get him wrong. McKeon doesn't want quotes showing up on an opponent's 
bulletin board. But he can't remember his confidence soaring to such a level 
before opening day. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres are going to win the division, grab the pennant and take their 
chances in the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon knows it. 
</P>
<P>
He's convinced of it. 
</P>
<P>
He just won't come out in so many words and say it. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys know we can win this thing, they're convinced they can," McKeon 
said. "We're not going to guarantee it, but there's an attitude now that we 
know we can do it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to be just a good club, we're going to be a great club. I'm 
telling you now, we've got more guys who are winners on this ballclub than any 
team I've ever been associated with." 
</P>
<P>
Even the '84 Padres, who won the National League pennant? 
</P>
<P>
Without a moment's hesitation, McKeon said, "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
So there you have it. The man who was irritated by all the prognosticators a 
year ago, who thought it stupid for anyone to consider the Padres the favorite, 
actually welcomes media confidence in his team. 
</P>
<P>
"Early predictions are like the (NCAA) basketball pool," McKeon said. "Who 
would have picked some of those clubs to win, and a team like Missouri to lose? 
</P>
<P>
"Shoot, I picked what I thought were the favorites, and my secretary, who 
doesn't know anything about basketball, is winning the thing. She picked Ball 
State to go this far, can you believe it?" 
</P>
<P>
But McKeon challenges anyone to come up with a valid reason why the Padres 
won't be playing in mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
Go ahead, try. 
</P>
<P>
 You lost the man, Davis, who saved 44 games for you. Doesn't this make your 
team actually weaker than a year ago? 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't get me wrong, he's a good pitcher, and I'd like to have him back, but 
one guy doesn't make a club. I don't see him having that kind of year again. I 
just don't see it. He was in an ideal situation. It was a career year is what 
it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Your club has been doomed by miserable first halves each of the past two 
seasons. What makes you think it won't happen again? 
</P>
<P>
 "We learned our lesson. I learned a lesson. And it won't happen again. I was 
no different than the fans and the rest of you guys, I was waiting for Jack 
(Clark) to hit one out and take care of us. Then everybody started putting too 
much pressure on themselves. Now, I know that we have to be aggressive, we've 
got to make things happen, we can't just sit around and wait for one big swing. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that after you put together your greatest exhibition record in 
franchise history last year, you also thought the Padres would go all the way. 
What makes this year different? 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, we were just hoping, that's all. We were hoping (Carmelo) Martinez 
would get off to a good start. We were hoping (John) Kruk would bounce back. We 
were hoping about a whole lot of things." 
</P>
<P>
On and on, McKeon went. He talked about all of the Padres' strengths. And if 
anyone needed any further convincing, he pointed at the late arrival who 
strolled into camp Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Clark. 
</P>
<P>
This is the man who led the Padres with 26 homers and 94 RBIs, with 14 homers 
and 42 RBIs in the last two months when the team found itself in a pennant 
race. 
</P>
<P>
He took his time getting to camp, staying in the Bay Area on Tuesday to watch 
his son play T-ball and stopping in for a haircut and visiting with his agent 
on Wednesday before finally arriving late Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Clark vows it will be his final late start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to pick up where I left off," he said. "The whole team finished on a 
high note, so we just have to continue what we had going. We're not searching 
for a new lineup or having a guessing game, so there's no reason why we can't 
keep it up. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though we're all behind schedule, there's a certain excitement in the 
clubhouse that wasn't here last spring." 
</P>
<P>
Said Padre starter Bruce Hurst: "I don't know if it's just me, but I feel a 
difference in this clubhouse. It's an air of confidence, a feeling of success. 
I think last year we proved to ourselves we can't just step on the field and 
turn it on and off, and we're going to benefit from that lesson." 
</P>
<P>
Said Padre outfielder Tony Gwynn: "It seems like there's a whole lot of guys 
who have something to prove. There's that feeling like this could really be 
something special." 
</P>
<P>
Hmmm. Could it be that McKeon really is into something, here? 
</P>
<P>
"You make your own judgment," McKeon said. "I'm just going on what I'm seeing. 
</P>
<P>
"And what I'm seeing, I like a whole hell of a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Even if the baseball commissioner's office had not decided to play a full 
162-game schedule, Padre Manager Jack McKeon said he disagrees with baseball 
purists who claim it would have tarnished the season. "Hey, what's the 
difference?" he said. "We were going to play 158 games anyway, and whoever is 
the best team over that long of a period deserves to be champion. Now, if 
you're talking about a 126-game schedule, yeah, that's a difference. But being 
the best over a 158-game season wouldn't take away anything." . . . Padre 
outfielder Tony Gwynn can't provide any explanations, but this first week of 
camp, he says, is the best of his career. "Usually the first week of camp I 
can't even get the ball out of the cage, but now I'm hitting the ball better 
than I ever hit it. Maybe it's the urgency of having a short camp. It's hard to 
say if that's a good sign or not, really, because I've always done pretty good 
the other way (.332 career batting average)." . . . Padre pitcher Eric Show, 
who underwent back surgery seven months ago, pitched for the third consecutive 
day without pain. "I'm feeling absolutely great," he said. "I feel so good, 
it's almost scary." . . . Who was the most impressive pitcher in camp Thursday? 
Try Jon Matlack, a 40-year-old who just happens to be the Padres' double-A 
pitching coach at Wichita. Matlack, a three-time All-Star who pitched West Palm 
Beach to the Senior League championship, left a half-dozen Padres shaking their 
head in amazement. "Hey, the guy could win 15 games right now," Padre catcher 
Mark Parent said. "I'm dead serious." Shortstop Garry Templeton yelled to 
Matlack: "You sure you don't want to help us this year? We sure could use you." 
. . . Tim Flannery, who retired from the Padres at the end of last season, 
arrived at camp today for his job with Ch. 8. When asked if he felt funny being 
in spring training without a uniform, he said, "You kidding me? I didn't even 
want to be in spring training last year." Flannery arranged a film clip in 
which he warmly greets everyone and promptly is kicked out of the clubhouse by 
McKeon, ignored by his teammates and neglected by a small boy seeking 
autographs. "This is great," Flannery said. "I told my wife I still get the 
same rush as when I played, only I'm not hurting afterwards." . . . Jack Clark, 
Ed Whitson, Thomas Howard and Dan Murphy arrived in camp Thursday, leaving 
pitcher Mike Dunne as the lone wanderer.

NOON PUTS 70-FOOT MARK BEHIND HIM; 
</P>
<P>
TRACK AND FIELD: FALLBROOK SENIOR TOPS HISTORIC SHOT SERIES AT 73-3. 
</P>

FALLBROOK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fallbrook High School's Brent Noon found out on Thursday that there is such a 
thing as a psychological barrier. 
</P>
<P>
Noon's was 70 feet in the shot put. Until Thursday, only five high schoolers 
had ever surpassed it. Until Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Noon spent last spring striving toward it, battling injuries and slumps. The 
battle continued into this season. Last week in a dual meet, Noon's best effort 
was just shy at 69-feet-11 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Noon finally reached the magic number Thursday on his first throw of a meet 
against Mt. Carmel, just passing the barrier at 70-0 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
With that behind, Noon then threw over 70 on his next five puts, saving his 
best for last: 73-3, making him the third-best high school shot-putter ever. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I would get it today," Noon said. "Just from the last few days of 
practice, I knew I'd hit something really big." 
</P>
<P>
Noon bettered his state best of 69-11 1/2 but did not set a San Diego Section 
record. At least five teams must compete in a meet for a mark to be considered 
for the section book, so Noon's 68-9 1/2 in last year's Orange Glen 
Invitational still stands. 
</P>
<P>
Noon's other accomplishments: 
</P>
<P>
 -- He became the second high schooler in history to surpass 70 feet on a 
series of six puts, according to Jack Shepard, high school expert for Track 
&amp; Field News. National record-holder Michael Carter, now a nose tackle for 
the San Francisco 49ers, did it on numerous occasions while competing for 
Dallas' Jefferson High in the late 1970s, Shepard said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Noon now is the season national leader by more than eight feet. Scott 
Petersen of Acadiana High in Lafayette, La., is second at 65-2. The two will 
meet at the Arcadia Invitational on Saturday, April 7. 
</P>
<P>
Petersen is the least of Noon's worries. After the 73-3, Noon took no deep 
breaths, no sighs of relief, instead setting his sights on new distances. 
</P>
<P>
There is the National Federation of State High School Assns. record of 77-0 set 
by Carter in 1979. Carter also threw 81-3 1/2 several days after graduation; 
that is recognized as the national best by Track &amp; Field News. 
</P>
<P>
The only athlete between Noon and Carter is Arnold Campbell of Airline High in 
Bossier City, La., who threw 74-10 1/2 in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Noon is taking aim at Carter's 77-footer. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything is possible," Noon said. "If I thought I didn't have a shot at it, I 
wouldn't throw the shot. But obviously (Carter) did it, so it can be done." 
</P>
<P>
Passing Campbell on the way might be little more than a minor hindrance. The 
season is early, and Noon says he is still perfecting his technique. 
</P>
<P>
"Brent has still not hit the ball," said Jim Noon, Brent's father and coach. 
"And once he does, he'll get that 500-pound bench press behind it, and the ball 
is going to take off." 
</P>
<P>
Noon said he is convinced that shot putting is a skill in which he can not go 
backward. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that way," Noon said, "but who knows if I were to come out here with a 
cold or something?" 
</P>
<P>
And if he remains healthy? 
</P>
<P>
"My goal is 77," Noon said. "And I think I'm going to hit it on every next 
throw -- on every throw, I have a chance of breaking that now." 
</P>
<P>
Noon also was hoping to become only the second high schooler to surpass both 70 
in the shot and 200 feet in the discus on the same day but fell short of that 
goal. His best discus throw was 188-3. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NOON'S BIG DAY 
</P>
<P>
Brent Noon's record-setting series: 
</P>
<P>
70- 1/2, 71-5, 72-11, 71-7 3/4, 72-2 1/2, 73-3 (third best ever)

MORNING BRIEFING: HE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS FUNNY, SO HE SUPPLIED A PUNCH LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARLEY TINKHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bruce Jenkins of the San Francisco Chronicle recalled one spring at Vero Beach, 
Fla., where Sandy Koufax and Reggie Smith were playing lob-toss. 
</P>
<P>
"Reggie was coming off shoulder surgery and he could barely get off a 20-foot 
throw," Jenkins wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"Nearby, a couple of shirtless men, maybe 20-22 years old, were watching the 
scene, working on a six-pack of beer. One of the guys got a little belligerent 
and started riding Smith. 'You're throwing like a girl,' he said. 
</P>
<P>
"After another nasty remark or two, Reggie calmly set down the baseball, walked 
over to the foul-mouthed one and floored him with one brutal punch. On with the 
show." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Elgin Baylor, Jerry West and Wilt Chamberlain were the only Lakers 
to have their numbers retired before Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. What were their 
numbers? 
</P>
<P>
Golden touch: Announcer Tom Kelly, telling Tom Harmon stories at Riviera 
Country Club, said that the inebriated fan who tried to tackle Harmon in the 
1940 California-Michigan game at Berkeley was saved from the hoosegow when 
Harmon asked the cops to bring him to the Michigan locker room. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy turned out to be the president of an insurance company," Kelly said. 
"Harmon wound up being a spokesperson for the company and made a ton of money." 
</P>
<P>
Great stuff: Wrote Larry Guest of the Orlando Sentinel when Fred Couples 
returned to Orlando, Fla., after his victory in the Los Angeles Open: "Freddie 
was proudly brandishing his most-cherished new possession. The tournament 
trophy, you say? Nahhh. Freddie seemed proudest of a hockey stick autographed 
by Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems, several (PGA) Tour pros took in a King game one night while in L.A. 
and were ushered into the locker room afterward to meet the Great One." 
</P>
<P>
Look out: From Philadelphia forward Charles Barkley: "New York is my kind of 
town because I have a gun." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Baylor 22, West 44, Chamberlain 13. 
</P>
<P>

Bird is over the hill: "Bird is still the only one who actually gives me a 
headache." HARLEY TINKHAM

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: CBS IS AT RIGHT PLACE AT RIGHT TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Larry Stewart 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CBS might have fallen asleep at the switch last weekend in covering the NCAA 
tournament, but the network was on top of things Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
The key move came when CBS left the North Carolina-Arkansas game in order to 
pick up the final 2:15 of Connecticut's improbable last-second victory over 
Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
Then CBS switched back to North Carolina-Arkansas, and, after UCLA's loss to 
Duke, CBS gave us the end of Texas' victory over Xavier. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the evening, 83% of the country was getting North Carolina-Arkansas 
and 17% was getting Connecticut-Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
When Connecticut was ahead by 19 points, only 12% of the country was getting 
that game, with 88% getting North Carolina-Arkansas when it was close. 
</P>
<P>
But later, as Clemson closed in on Connecticut and Arkansas pulled away from 
North Carolina, every state except Texas, Arkansas and North Carolina got to 
see the Huskies pull out a one-point victory. 
</P>
<P>
CBS' Mike Francesa offered an interesting stat during halftime of the UCLA-Duke 
game. 
</P>
<P>
He pointed out Scott Burrell, the Connecticut player who threw the pass to Tate 
George, is a baseball pitcher with a 95 m.p.h. fastball. 
</P>
<P>
Burrell was good enough to be a first-round draft pick of the Seattle Mariners 
in June, but opted to go to Connecticut rather than sign with the Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
Also, it was a good move by KCBS to bring in USC Coach George Raveling to 
provide analysis on Thursday night's postgame show. 
</P>
<P>
Commentator Dick Vitale on ESPN losing its share of the NCAA tournament to CBS 
next season: "This is not ESPN's obituary. We'll be involved all year with a 
smorgasbord of coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have the appetizer, and (CBS) will have the main course. I'll be chef 
Dickie V., setting the table for Billy P." 
</P>
<P>
Billy P., of course, is Billy Packer, who will be working with Brent Musburger 
on the co-main events on CBS tonight -- Loyola Marymount vs. Alabama at 5:25 
p.m., followed by Nevada Las Vegas vs. Ball State. 
</P>
<P>
Was Meldrick Taylor robbed on Saturday when referee Richard Steele stopped his 
fight against Julio Cesar Chavez with two seconds left in the final round? 
</P>
<P>
A lot of knowledgeable boxing observers, after further review, have said no, 
that Steele did the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
But ABC boxing commentator Alex Wallau, who was at ringside, said Steele should 
not have stopped the fight. "I don't blame Richard Steele for not knowing how 
much time was left," he said, "but I think he should have judged Taylor on how 
he looked when he went down and how he looked when he got up. That's the 
important thing, not what he says or doesn't say. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Taylor looked OK. He knew where he was. He grabbed for the rope as 
he went down. I don't put a lot of stock in asking a fighter how he feels. How 
he appears is much more important. 
</P>
<P>
"Steele should have stepped back and waited to see how Taylor reacted before 
stopping the fight." 
</P>
<P>
Wallau said he asked Steele after the fight if he saw the red lights, which 
signal that only 10 seconds are left in a round. Steele told Wallau he did not. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, a review of the HBO coverage showed that five seconds remained 
when Steele signaled the fight was over, not two as announced. 
</P>
<P>
HBO commentator Larry Merchant agreed with Wallau, saying that Steele should 
not have stopped the fight when he did. 
</P>
<P>
"Steele made a narrow, technical, by-the-book decision," Merchant said. 
"Taylor, who had shown no previous signs of distress, should have been given 
the benefit of doubt, but he didn't get it. 
</P>
<P>
"Steele should have used better discretion. It's like a Highway Patrol officer 
stopping a driver for doing 85 m.p.h., then finding out the driver's wife is 
about to give birth. 
</P>
<P>
"If he follows the book, the CHP officer gives the driver a speeding ticket. 
But more than likely he shows discretion and lets the driver continue on." 
</P>
<P>
Add fight: ABC has the replay rights and will show the bout on "Wide World of 
Sports" on March 31 after a live John Mugabi fight in Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Wallau said ABC will try to devote as much time as possible to the 
Chavez-Taylor replay. 
</P>
<P>
"We go on the air at 4:30 p.m., and the Mugabi fight is scheduled to start at 
4:33," Wallau said. "We can't get a much quicker start than that. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if the Mugabi fight goes the distance, we'll be able to show five 
rounds," Wallau said. 
</P>
<P>
That's hardly enough, though. 
</P>
<P>
It's too bad that HBO doesn't have the replay rights. The pay-cable network 
would be able to devote two hours to the fight, which it deserves. 
</P>
<P>
Last add fight: Merchant and HBO blow-by-blow announcer Jim Lampley have taken 
some heat for coming across as pro-Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to cop a plea and totally disagree with that," Merchant said. 
"Maybe we didn't give Chavez enough credit along the way. 
</P>
<P>
"But the story line of this fight until the very end was that Taylor was 
beating this great champion." 
</P>
<P>
With a little over a minute left in the fight, Lampley said, "It doesn't appear 
at this moment that Chavez has the stuff to get it done." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Lampley was proven wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Said Merchant at the time of the knockdown, "If he gets up in time, he probably 
wins the fight." 
</P>
<P>
He got up, but the fight was stopped anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Lampley, believing the pictures told the story, said nothing when Taylor went 
down, then went wild when Steele signaled the fight was over. 
</P>
<P>
"Unbelievable! Unbelievable!" he screamed at viewers. "You're going to watch 
Lou Duva go crazy now, you're going to watch Lou Duva go absolutely berserk." 
</P>
<P>
But we didn't see Duva do anything. It wasn't until later that Duva began 
protesting. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the most unusual calls in the history of the sport," Lampley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It will be debated for years. 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
HBO's next fight will be Michael Nunn vs. Marlon Starling at the Mirage in Las 
Vegas on April 14. . . . Showtime will televise the April 28 bout between 
Thomas Hearns and Michael Olajide. A twist here is that, for some cable 
subscribers who don't have Showtime, the fight will be offered on a 
pay-per-view basis. Those who sign up will also get a month of Showtime on a 
trial basis. 
</P>
<P>
Due to time restraints and technical difficulties, plans have fallen through to 
announce the winner of the Los Angeles Athletic Club's John Wooden Award on 
national television on April 1. The winner will now be announced on April 4 at 
a noon news conference at the club, with a banquet to be held that night at the 
Biltmore Hotel. Votes are due by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 4 will televise the start and finish of the ninth annual Long Beach 
Marathon on May 6 and will break into regular programming with five-minute 
reports along the way. Fred Roggin will be the host of the coverage, with Nancy 
Ditz serving as one of the commentators. Another commentator will be named 
later. Phil Olsman, who has produced all five of the Los Angeles Marathon 
telecasts on Channel 13, will produce this telecast. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN opens its spring training coverage next Monday with the Cleveland Indians 
playing the San Francisco Giants at noon. . . . ESPN's seven-nights-a-week 
"Baseball Tonight" program began this week. The show will air at 8 p.m. unless 
preempted by a game telecast. When that's the case, it will usually follow the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 5 will televise the Freeway Series game on April 6 from Anaheim 
Stadium, with Joe Torre and Reggie Jackson reporting. . . . SportsChannel will 
televise the Dodgers' season opener against the San Diego Padres on April 9 at 
1:30 p.m., with Joel Meyers and Ron Cey reporting. The Angels will be on 
SportsChannel the following night, with Joe Garagiola and Torre. SportsChannel 
will still televise 35 Dodger games and 35 Angel games this season. Two Dodger 
telecasts, originally scheduled for next week, will have to be made up. 
</P>
<P>
The first CBS telecast will be the Dodgers' game against the Astros at Houston 
on April 14, as originally scheduled.

LOYOLA WOMEN'S COACH SHOPPING FOR A BETTER BENCH; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: COACH TODD CORMAN IS SCOUTING HIGH SCHOOLS AND JUNIOR COLLEGES FOR 
BETTER RESERVES TO IMPROVE ON THIS SEASON'S 14-14 RECORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Loyola Marymount women's basketball program is looking for a few good 
players. 
</P>
<P>
After a season that saw the Lions post an overall record of 14-14 and finish in 
third place in the West Coast Conference at 7-7, Coach Todd Corman is not 
pleased. 
</P>
<P>
Poor play by reserves this season has made Corman step up his recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
"I need to find players who can help me now by going out and playing a good 
game off the bench," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, Corman said, he looks only for high school talent, but this year he is 
scouting the junior colleges for players who have already developed their 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
"Several (junior college) players are definitely looking like good prospects to 
shore up the bench," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the top of his shopping list is a post player to replace Michelle 
Bettencourt, who averaged 7.8 points and 5.9 rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now I'm talking to a few kids, but I don't have any firm commitments 
yet," Corman said. "I think that we need to expand the area from where we 
recruit our players, and that's what I'm trying to do this year." 
</P>
<P>
He said he has a good shot at the two or three players he needs to upgrade the 
defense and get more consistent shooting from the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the Lions' current reserves averaged less than 2.5 points and 2.5 
rebounds per game, Corman said, adding that poor rebounding hurt the team the 
most. 
</P>
<P>
The season started with high hopes for the Lions, who were coming off their 
best year (17-11) since Corman took over, though they faced a tougher schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"We played well the first half of the season," he said. "Once we hit the 
conference, though, things began to fall apart." 
</P>
<P>
Early in conference play, the Lions were challenging for first place. But they 
didn't finish strongly, especially having problems on the road, and finished at 
.500 in the WCC, a distant third behind St. Mary's. 
</P>
<P>
Corman said the team often wasn't ready to play and seemed distracted on the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
The core of that team will be back next year, including its two scoring 
leaders: two-time all-conference guard Kristen Bruich, who averaged 14.3 points 
per game, and guard Lynn Flanagan, who averaged 12.4. Bruich also led the team 
with five assists and four steals per game. 
</P>
<P>
A disappointment, Corman said, was the play of 6-3 junior center Tricia Gibson. 
She averaged nine points and 6.6 rebounds per game -- virtually the same as the 
previous year -- but was expected to do more. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Corman said, he hoped that Gibson would assert herself offensively, 
but she was slowed by injuries most of the season, though she still set a 
school record for blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
No players have been cut, but there will be competition for spots on the team 
next year, Corman said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of two things is going to happen next year," he said. "The first is that 
the current players will come back with an attitude that will allow them to 
focus on basketball. The second is that they will again be distracted by things 
outside of basketball and not be ready to contribute."

AN AUTO MOTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
RACE DRIVERS STEER QUARTZ HILL STUDENTS TOWARD A CAREER AND AWAY FROM THE MEAN 
STREETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It begins as just another routine day for the 15 boys in Mr. Engstrom's 
fifth-period automotive lab at Quartz Hill High. The youths take a quiz on the 
"Fundamentals of Magnetism." Then they do grunt work in the bowels of a compact 
Nissan. Nothing very exciting or glamorous, just future auto mechanics 
dissecting a fuel-injected carburetor and trying to understand the mysteries of 
vapor lock. 
</P>
<P>
Then Mike Winchester and Will Harper drive up with their trailers. Class is 
over. It's time to visit fantasy land: the interior of a genuine, battle-dented 
stock car. Maybe it sort of looks like dad's old clunker, but there are roll 
bars inside and a monster motor under the hood. The boys climb into the 
streamlined cockpit, imagine the beast underneath them, and rock to the music 
that roars from Harper's 355-horsepower engine. 
</P>
<P>
Winchester, wearing a bright blue, fire-retardant racing jumpsuit, and Harper 
are at Quartz Hill to get boys interested in auto racing, the high-tech end of 
auto mechanics, and by the time they leave about a dozen boys have signed up to 
be apprentice members of pit crews at Saugus Speedway this racing season. They 
will make trips, wear team coveralls and caps and learn the teamwork necessary 
to keep a car going in a fender-bending, gear-grinding stock-car race. 
</P>
<P>
After literally crawling all over Harper's red '89 Camaro and Winchester's blue 
'70 Chevelle for about 30 minutes, the boys are sufficiently enthralled with 
auto racing to want to hear Winchester's pitch. Along with some 60 other 
students attracted by the commotion, the class returns to the auto lab and sits 
at tables in front of a blackboard. Then Winchester stands, uncoils his 
6-foot-6, 260-pound body, and explains that his reasons for starting the 
pit-crew program go deeper than merely providing them with an entry-level 
opportunity to get into racing. It's something the boys don't expect to hear. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an ex-drug addict and alcoholic," he says. That gets their attention. "I 
was using before you were born." Winchester, a 37-year-old Vietnam veteran who 
works as a financial consultant for auto dealerships, goes on to detail the 
depths of his addiction. "I would panhandle for food. I would call McDonald's 
and say they messed up my order. If people hadn't helped me, I'd be dead." 
</P>
<P>
Winchester, who tells them he has been clean and sober for 15 years, says he 
started the pit-crew program, called Antelope Valley Outreach, "as an 
alternative to drugs and the gang scene, 'cause that stuff ain't happening, 
guys. Our intent is to keep you out of trouble." With an imposing presence, a 
booming voice that fills all corners of the four-bay, cinder-block lab and 
street-talking demeanor, Winchester holds his audience. 
</P>
<P>
"There's more of a high racing and working with these cars than doing drugs," 
he says. "After a race, that feeling of accomplishment is unbelievable, a rush, 
even for members of the pit crew." 
</P>
<P>
Winchester has the blessing of the high school and the Antelope Valley Union 
School District, Principal Ray Monti says. "We feel that it's worthwhile that 
he's trying to reach kids," says Monti, who adds that the program will not be 
part of the school curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
Speedway general manager Ray Wilkings has not ironed out the final details with 
Winchester but sees no problems with the program. "It sounds like a pretty good 
deal to me," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Winchester expects 70 to 100 students, mostly boys, to take part in the 
program. They will work in five-man rotations for three drivers: Harper, last 
season's champion in the Sportsman division; Brian Kelley, Hobby Stock 
champion; and Winchester, an experienced Go-Kart and motocross racer who will 
be a rookie at Saugus. Winchester explains to them that they will have to get a 
waiver of liability signed by a parent, they must be at least 16, they can't 
drive the race cars, and they need to know how to follow directions. His. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm no pushover," Winchester says, "and you should know this: we don't drink, 
we don't smoke, we don't party, we don't tolerate anybody playing games. We 
expect you to be at the track on Friday nights to help prepare the car for 
Saturday's race. This is serious business." 
</P>
<P>
By now, the boys are beginning to squirm -- teens do that when adults use the 
word "serious" -- but Winchester lightens up. "We'll be making a trip to Las 
Vegas for a race," he says. "You'll have a blast." Then he and Harper hand 
around some expensive racing gear, including a radio-equipped helmet, and 
Winchester sets the racing hook deeper. 
</P>
<P>
"That blue Chevelle out there belongs to you," he says, "if you're interested 
in working on it. I live in the second cul-de-sac up the road. We can work on 
the car at my house." 
</P>
<P>
When the speeches are over, the boys again go outside and check out the cars. 
Harper's $30,000 Camaro still has the scratches and bruises from last season's 
racing campaign. As the boys crowd around, he tells them that only his crew's 
expertise enabled him to stay in many important races on his way to the title. 
Then he removes the hood and the boys whistle at the sight of the power-packed 
engine. 
</P>
<P>
"See, guys, electronic ignition -- no points," auto teacher Rick Engstrom says. 
</P>
<P>
"What kind of compression ratio does it have?" a boy in a blue shirt asks. 
</P>
<P>
"Fourteen and a half to one," Harper says. 
</P>
<P>
A few boys chime in: "Fourteen and a half to one!" 
</P>
<P>
Just in case anyone was getting the wrong idea, Engstrom says, "Fellas, this is 
not legal on the street." 
</P>
<P>
A couple of seniors, Pete Knapp and Clint Sonntag, sign up with the program. 
"It will probably be a good experience," says Knapp, whose father is a 
mechanic. Sonntag wants to work on race cars even though he may have a conflict 
with his part-time job as a waiter, but, he says, "I have a lenient boss who'll 
let me take a lot of time off." 
</P>
<P>
Winchester watches a boy wriggle though the window of the Chevelle and sit in 
the driver's seat. The boy wants to wrap his hands around the steering wheel 
but looks at Winchester for approval. Winchester smiles at him and says, "Do 
anything you want. It's your puppy."

LEDERMAN STAYS HOT FOR EL CAMINO REAL; 
</P>
<P>
PREP BASEBALL: CONQUISTADORE INFIELDER KNOCKS IN THREE RUNS IN A 6-2 VICTORY 
OVER GRANADA HILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Greg Lederman's theory on hitting is as rudimentary as wearing blackout under 
the eyes, rubbing dirt on the bat handle, receiving the occasional splinter in 
the back pocket. 
</P>
<P>
Lederman learned a lot about the latter in his first two seasons on the El 
Camino Real High varsity, during most of which he sat. So if it sounds as 
though there is a parallel between his ideas on hitting and just plain getting 
to take some turns at-bat, that's understandable. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to put the bat on the ball," Lederman said. "I just want to put it 
in play." 
</P>
<P>
In his first season as a starter, Lederman has done much more than make 
contact. Through five games, the 5-foot-6 junior infielder has hit safely in 10 
of 16 at-bats and leads the team with a .625 average. Lederman was at it again 
Tuesday at Granada Hills, banging out two hits and driving in three runs to 
lead El Camino Real to a 6-2 victory in a Northwest Valley Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
"He's hitting the ball real well," El Camino Real Coach Mike Maio said in what 
might be the biggest understatement of the young season. "He has a lot of 
desire and he's very intense. He's learned how to use that to his advantage." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real -- which tied Granada Hills, 3-3, on Tuesday -- had to work 
through a disadvantage too. Senior right-hander Pat Treend (3-0) was 
uncharacteristically wild, walking seven in five innings while striking out 
seven and allowing five hits. Treend, it seems, was suffering from a sinus 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Wobbly or not, Treend pitched four scoreless innings and several times was 
timed by a radar gun at 85 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Treend's stint lasted longer than planned. Junior right-hander Sean Boldt 
took the mound in the bottom of the fifth, started his warmup tosses . . . and 
was sent back to the bench by the plate umpire. Maio had forgotten to list 
Boldt on the lineup card. 
</P>
<P>
With his team leading, 5-0, Treend trudged back to the mound and gave up a 
two-out single to Jon Condos. Gabe Padilla then drilled a run-scoring triple to 
right-center. It was the first earned run allowed by Treend in 20 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"My brain jiggled every time I let go of the ball," Treend said. "I was worn 
out by the fourth or the fifth." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real (4-0-1) scored three times in the first inning, and quickly at 
that. Herman Merchan walked, stole second and scored on Jeff Marks' single to 
right. Marks moved to second on a passed ball and scored on Ryan McGuire's 
single to center. Two outs later, Lederman slammed a single into left to drive 
home McGuire, who had stolen second and moved to third on a wild pitch by 
Highlander starter Gabe Miller (1-2). 
</P>
<P>
Lederman drilled a run-scoring triple into the gap in right-center to give El 
Camino Real a 4-0 lead in the third. Lederman added a sacrifice fly in the 
seventh for his 11th RBI in five games. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like I haven't hit them very hard, but they've been dropping," 
Lederman said. "And every time I come up, runners are in scoring position." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the key part of this phrase is every time I come up. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just glad to be getting to play," Lederman said. "I just want to come out 
here and win some games."

LA REINA ROUTS BISHOP DIEGO BEHIND PERFECT GAME, 37-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
La Reina High crushed Bishop Diego, 37-0, Thursday in a Tri-Valley League 
softball game at Bishop Diego that was shortened to five innings because of a 
10-run rule. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman right-hander Michelle St. Pierre pitched a perfect game and the 
Regents (7-3, 2-0 in league play), who scored 15 runs in the third inning, 
collected 18 hits and capitalized on 22 walks and 11 errors by Bishop Diego 
(3-3, 0-1). 
</P>
<P>
Last season, La Reina hammered Bishop Diego, 41-1, in a game featuring a 23-run 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good about the pitching and defense, but the rest of it. . . . It 
doesn't do you any good," La Reina Coach Don Hyatt said. "How do you say, 
'Congratulations, you played a nice game' ?" 
</P>
<P>
St. Pierre (3-2) was four for five with five runs batted in and five runs 
scored. Carolyn Russo was four for six with five RBIs and four runs scored. 
Sheri Sisco hit a three-run home run in the third inning.

EASTVIEW LITTLE LEAGUE NEEDS MORE THAN $1 MILLION TO COMPLETE FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Pedro Baseball Inc., which needs $1.6 million to build a new home for the 
Eastview Little League, is still more than $1 million short of its goal despite 
breaking ground for the new facility recently. President Gary Miley said San 
Pedro Baseball has raised slightly more than $320,000 so far, most of it in a 
lump sum of $300,000 from Unocal. Miley indicated, however, that the group 
expects to receive several other grants soon. In addition, he said, local 
businesses have agreed to donate labor and supplies at cost to build the 
facility. The 15-acre site at Gaffey Street and Capitol Drive is being prepared 
for grading. It is expected to hold five fields, including four with lights, 
and seating for 500 people. Opening is slated for spring, 1991. Miley is 
accepting donations at 1931 N. Gaffey St., Suite F, San Pedro 90731. Or call 
(213)-5-FIELDS. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro resident Herbert Bobo, who has an eight handicap, still remembers the 
day two years ago when he recorded the only hole in one of his golfing career. 
Bobo, now 78, put his tee shot in the middle of the cup on the 120-yard seventh 
hole at the Palos Verdes Shores Mobile Estates Ltd. nine-hole course on April 
12, 1988. Bobo, a resident of the Estates, began playing the game when he was 8 
years old and still gets out twice a week.

The Division 4 boys all-star team from Redondo Beach Region 34 of the American 
Youth Soccer Organization recently advanced to the first round of the Southern 
California Sectionals before being eliminated. Coached by Gemma Scharfenberger

Cartlidge, Matthew Hammer, John Lockhart, Jason Funes, Nicholas Plancich, Nicky 
De Crescenzo, Matthew Miles, Aron Kogan, Jason Linley, James Zelenay, Jeff

BASKETBALL STANDOUT MCRAE NETS BASEBALL VICTORY FOR CLEVELAND

<TEXT>
<P>
Bobby McRae, an All-City Section forward for the Cleveland High basketball 
team, didn't wait long to show his mettle as a baseball pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
In his first start since joining the team 10 days ago, McRae hurled a 
two-hitter with six strikeouts Thursday as Cleveland defeated Chatsworth, 5-1, 
in a Northwest Valley Conference game at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
McRae, a right-hander, struck out six and walked seven while holding Chatsworth 
(8-2, 3-2 in league play) scoreless until the fourth inning. By that time, 
Cleveland (2-3) led, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers scored three times in the first inning on a two-run single by 
Dave Cipolla and a run-scoring groundout by senior Pat Bryant. Bryant was one 
for two with a run batted in and a stolen base.

It was more than just chat, hors d'oeuvres and some Brazilian music at last 
week's fund-raiser for the Rainforest Alliance staged by Hermes in Beverly 
Hills. General manager Francine Bardot says 30 specially designed "Equateur" 
scarfs were sold for $195 each, with Hermes donating $5 of every purchase to 
the Alliance. The Rainforest Alliance went home with a tidy bundle: $10,000 in 
proceeds from the $50-per-person event. And two students, Balencia Erskine and 
Zena Hefti, from the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising, walked off 
with scholarships of $2,500 and $1,500, their prizes from Hermes for submitting 
outstanding rain-forest-inspired textile designs.

GUMBEL'S FASHION GAFF: "Today Show" host Bryant Gumbel's sartorial savvy was 
called into question earlier this week (the crew from NBC's morning show will 
be broadcasting live from L.A. through Tuesday). Gumbel, dressed like an 
adolescent skate boarder from Iowa in hot lime sunglasses and a fluorescent 
pink and green hat, interviewed local beachwear designer Shawn Stussy on Venice 
Beach. When asked to relay white-hot fashion trends, Stussy replied that 
bright, garrish-colored beachwear is definitely out.

LOUNGE LIZARDS ON MELROSE: Henry Lizardlover Schiff with Schiff (no quote marks 
here, that's his real name) and his live lizards will be at the Melrose Avenue 
children's store, Joys and Toys, Saturday and Sunday from 11:00 a.m. to 6:00 
p.m. to promote Schiff's Lovin' Lizard line of children's clothing. The dozen 
lizards will perform their lounging act on miniature furniture. Schiff will 
donate 10 percent of all Lovin' Lizard's gross sales to the entertainment 
industry's ecology group, Earth Communications Office.

LITTLE MORE FUNK: Tawny Little, co-host of "A.M. L.A.," is getting an on-air 
makeover. J. Gerard of West Hollywood will now be outfitting Little. Julia 
Gerard, sole owner of the 5-year-old boutique, says she is mad for the 
opportunity to dress Little. "She's funkier and much more interesting than her 
job allows her to appear."

STRANGE CLUB FELLOWS: What do Tom Jones, George Harrison and Pia Zadora have in 
common? A harmonic fashion convergence at Spice, the club were international 
night crawlers convene. Austrian designer Paul Prinz, whose clothes are 
featured at Los Angeles' M.G. Designs, dazzled the celeb-studded crowd at a 
recent Spice fashion show with his leather, suede and Persian lambswool 
sportswear.

SAVING FACE: Are you a stickler for cosmetics and skin care products not tested 
on animals? Head to Barney's New York's new Orange County shop at South Coast

Brown, Martin de Candre and Kiehl's of New York. The latter brand is a favorite 
with New York super models Cindy Crawford and Christie Brinkley.

The streets of the Roppongi neighborhood stay alive deep into the night. The 
area is home to the Lexington Queen, a favorite hangout for musicians, celebs, 
models and young Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
"The Lex" is a few steps from Roppongi Square Building, a 10-story structure 
that houses eight discos, a jazz club, a restaurant and a game center. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular club in the building is Java Jive, a restaurant-disco that is 
decorated "Jamaica-style" and features a Jamaican band and a deejay playing 
international disco hits. 
</P>
<P>
Buzz, also in the building, is Tokyo's hottest video dance club with a huge 
screen at one end and monitors showing the latest music videos scattered around 
the club. 
</P>
<P>
But most young Japanese, and many foreigners who live in Japan, prefer pubs, 
especially Charleston's and Paradisio, both in the Roppongi area. 
</P>
<P>
The music is pretty much the same as in the States. The Japanese also keep up 
with the latest U.S. dance crazes. BILL HERSEY

If New York is a pulse for fashion, then surely its dance clubs set the beat. 
Parody and fantasy are the name of the game. 
</P>
<P>
So take a 100-year-old former meatpacking plant, add an "Afrotech" dance floor 
that combines leopard skins and a computer motif, and give the nightspot a 
far-out name -- in this case, "Mars." 
</P>
<P>
Vintage clothes, recalling other eras, are the perfect foil. 
</P>
<P>
"The clubs are all about retro-everything," says fashion designer Dianne Brill. 
Important sightings include Jacqueline Kennedy pillbox hats and gloves, hippie 
love beads, boxy handbags with handles, and hairpieces. Clunky, chunky jewelry, 
be it Lucite or antique stone, is a look. Then there are '70s platform shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Black leather motorcycle jackets with jeans are popular and abundant at Horatio 
113. And many club kids are still kicking around in ripped jeans with 
air-conditioning at the knees, although party promoter Brinton Brewster 
cautions: "They're so passe, the only reason they got in was because they had a 
reservation." FRANCINE PARNES

Los Angeles is an industry town like any other -- except that the biz here is 
the fast and eccentric entertainment trade. Clubs like Bordello cater to the 
rock 'n' roll hordes: youthful urbanites clad in leather, denim and fringe. 
</P>
<P>
Young women wear tattoos and dresses that are short, tight and leave nothing to 
the imagination. Some clubs, like Club With No Name and Scarlet Letter, add a 
twist -- the former caters to the black-clad underground crowd while the latter 
features Harleys as fashion accessories. 
</P>
<P>
While the rockers take their looks from metal-music icons such as Axl Rose, 
other club-goers look to fashion plates in magazines. At Club Louis, once 
Madonna's Friday-night choice for dancing, pricey blouses, coats and shirts hit 
the floor as the crowd works up a dance sweat. For those more inclined to drink 
than dance, there's Small's, a cozy bar on the wrong end of Melrose (that's 
east) where night owls wear what they will and it's too dark to see anyway.

who decided which people, films and TV shows they found the most difficult to 
swallow in 1989. "Turkey of the Year," given to the biggest "schlemiels," went 
to "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation" and the now-defunct sitcom "Chicken 
Soup." The "Pastrami on White Bread with Mayonnaise of the Year" award for

A COMING-OUT PARTY FOR FISCHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recital presented by Clare Fischer and his Latin Jazz Quintet, in the 
Student Union Center at Cal State Northridge, was a coming-out party for the 
veteran pianist and composer. It marked his first public concert since he 
suffered serious injuries, including a fractured skull, in an accident last 
July. 
</P>
<P>
Though he apologized for supposed memory lapses, Fischer on Sunday showed no 
signs of diminished assurance. Seated at a Roland electric keyboard in the 
large room, which was set up in cabaret style, he seemed completely in command 
as his group went through its exotic samba, merengue, bossa and Cuban motions. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Mitchell was a key figure in the ensembles. In Fischer's lightly Latin 
flavored "Gentle Breeze," he was heard first on soprano sax, in octave unison 
with the leader's son, Brent Fischer, and later on flute, in tandem with Clare 
Fisher's full-bodied chording. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Fischer is developing into a virtuoso on both four-string and 
six-string electric bass. He used the latter in a duo number with his father, 
the rhythmically intriguing "Curumin." 
</P>
<P>
The propulsive undercurrent of the combo was vigorously supplied by Bernie 
Dresel on drums and Billy Hulting on congas. Mongo Santamaria's "Afro Blue" 
provided them with a splendidly built workout. LEONARD FEATHER

'FEAR' ECHOES WOODY ALLEN, MINUS THE LAUGHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Todd Solondz, the young writer-director-star of "Fear, Anxiety and Depression," 
(Goldwyn Pavilion) wants to be the new Woody Allen so badly, he should walk 
around with a sandwich board emblazoned, "Generic Woody: All the urban 
neuroses, One tenth the cost." And, unfortunately, less than one tenth the 
laughs. Of "Interiors." 
</P>
<P>
Solondz, a recent NYU graduate, has a subject ripe for satire: the proto-punk 
Lower Manhattan scene, not quite-starving artists in a landscape of creeping 
gentrification. But, with all this Allen mimicry, he's like Rich Little run 
amok. He sees everything through a double screen: the world as a Woody Allen 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
Solondz appropriates everything: glasses, shaggy wardrobe, nervous oververbal 
dialogues, anhedonia and self-pity. He uses that draggy, nasal whine. He flops 
his arms, stammers. At one point, he even does Woody's little blissed out 
mating dance: those stiff-legged, dopey, smirky pirouettes. His own frizzy mop 
is black, but otherwise, he's copied everything but the freckles. And the soul. 
</P>
<P>
Given this performance, one might expect the major character, Ira Ellis 
(Solondz), to be a young film school graduate obsessed with Woody Allen. But 
Solondz shows greater hubris. Instead, Ira is fixated on Samuel Beckett; he's a 
struggling playwright, a nebbish-in-excelsis who inexplicably gets bad plays 
produced at the Public Theater. 
</P>
<P>
Ira's neurasthenic roundelay of sexual encounters also swarms with Allen 
archetypes. His stud-buddy Jack, the poseur pop painter (Max Cantor) is 
Solondz's Tony Roberts. His clinging, sniveling girlfriend Sharon (Jill Wisoff) 
suggests Louise Lasser. The coldly promiscuous punk performance artist, Junk 
(Jane Hamper), whom Ira vainly pursues, is not an obvious Diane Keaton clone -- 
though Jack's failed actress girlfriend Janice (Alexandra Gersten) is in the 
ballpark. And there's a smarmy yuppie success named Donny (Stanley Tucci), who 
suggests any number of Allen nemeses from Paul Simon to Alan Alda. 
</P>
<P>
Some of this is clever, but little of it is funny. Solondz has the husk of 
Woody, but not the heart or the mechanics. The movie is frenetic, pushy, thin, 
obvious -- and Solondz's comic sense tends toward overblown, over-telegraphed 
slapstick. 
</P>
<P>
But, though "Fear, Anxiety and Depression" (Times-rated mature for theme and 
language) is a pretty complete failure, its stabs at wit, Angst and Manhattan 
occasionally nudge their targets and cinematographer Stefan Czapsky ("Vampire's 
Kiss") and Solondz get some zippy-stylish long-take scenes and sidewalk 
tracking shots. And Tucci, Gersten and Cantor have their moments. Unfortunately 
for all of them, Woody still owns the franchise.

INNOCUOUS EAR CANDY BY THE TOTO OF THE '90S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A better moniker for the L.A. septet known as Venice might have been borrowed 
from a cleaner, more generically pleasant adjoining town, but as a band name 
Marina Del Rey doesn't really have the same rock 'n' roll ring. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Venice the band came to Hollywood the town for a showcase on 
Wednesday at the Roxy, a performance polished enough that it may not be too 
soon to posit this well-scrubbed, long-haired, highly professional outfit as 
the Toto of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
Like that "faceless" but very successful predecessor, this is a band anchored 
by siblings who put on a strong, united vocal front in an aggressive, hit-ready 
setting that's easy on the ears but almost never hits you in the gut. 
</P>
<P>
Earnest, friendly, slick and a little hokey, Venice hit on some big topics, but 
even numbers about racism, drug addiction and bay pollution came off sounding 
like the same sort of innocuous ear candy as the love songs. An exception: 
"People Laugh," an AIDS-themed ballad that takes a knock at comedians who 
wrench guffaws out of terminal disease. Anyone who pulls off an anti-Sam 
Kinison song is at least rowing down the right canal. CHRIS WILLMAN

LORRY: BROODY BRITS THAT ARE HARD TO DISMISS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM

<TEXT>
<P>
Red Lorry Yellow Lorry has no truck with levity. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the British band's show on Wednesday at the Coach House in San Juan 
Capistrano (they also play Helter Skelter in Hollywood tonight) was a cut above 
much of what has come out of the sorrow-and-gloom school of post-punk Anglo 
rock. 
</P>
<P>
When broody Brit bands like the Mission U.K. come over and start acting like so 
many baleful Young Werthers, the first reaction is to wish they'd quit the 
posing, buy some Chuck Berry records and lighten up. 
</P>
<P>
It was harder to dismiss the haggard-looking lead Lorry, Chris Reed. At his 
best, Reed's deep, harsh voice fairly seethed with existential anger, set 
against the quartet's rumbling march rhythms and a wash of guitar distortion 
and feedback that occasionally recalled the Velvet Underground and the Jesus 
and Mary Chain. 
</P>
<P>
The Lorrys' 55-minute set did include a few numbers intended to introduce a 
degree of optimism. "The Rise" had an assured rhythmic surge and lyrics in 
praise of individualism and independence, and the slow and stately "Shine a 
Light" offered a prayerful reach in its refrain. But Reed's voice always 
remained low and clenched, precluding any convincing sense of uplift. Velocity, 
rather than emotional tone, was the main source of variation in a monolithic, 
but intense set. MIKE BOEHM

DAVID BINTLEY'S 'WANDERER' OFFERED BY SAN FRANCISCO BALLET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While still in his 20s, David Bintley became resident choreographer of the 
Royal Ballet, bastion of British classical tradition. Since then, he has 
produced full-length narrative works as well as abstract ballets and, at 32, is 
widely considered the creative heir to Sir Frederick Ashton. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Bintley remains largely unknown in the United States. San Francisco Ballet 
acquired his "Sons of Horus" two years ago and, this season, currently in 
progress at the War Memorial Opera House, Bintley made a new work expressly for 
Helgi Tomasson's dancers. 
</P>
<P>
Or, rather, Bintley used San Francisco Ballet as a surrogate for his usual 
company. Certainly his intelligent, sensitive "The 'Wanderer' Fantasy" speaks 
the language of ballet with a distinct British accent and explores an 
unmistakably British obsession with eroding, oppressive grandeur. 
</P>
<P>
A plotless, one-act suite for eight soloists, the work has been given an 
elegant, faded backdrop and rich, dowdy costumes (both by Terry Bartlett) that 
make it look like a repertory relic. The choreography is also deliberately 
backdated, with references to Balanchine's "Serenade" and an overall emphasis 
on the rigidity of pose that was once the hallmark of British style. 
</P>
<P>
Sight and sound clash strangely. Liszt's arrangement for piano and orchestra of 
music by Schubert restlessly surges -- but Bintley's dancers continually pause, 
like mannequins, to define The Motif: a single, curved and upraised arm. At the 
height of the score's passion and Bintley's most fluid invention, The Motif 
suddenly appears on the backdrop in silhouette: shadows that help suggest a 
paralyzing tradition or legacy, the oppressive weight of the past. 
</P>
<P>
Provocative in its implications, "The 'Wanderer' Fantasy" also challenges the 
dancers' stamina and control: a test that several of the SFB men could not pass 
on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
However, the moody central adagio (a trio that developed into a duet) had 
superb command and flow in the performances by Joanna Berman, Wendy Van Dyck 
and Anthony Randazzo. Jean-Louis LeRoux conducted the fine company orchestra 
and Michael McGraw was the excellent pianist. 
</P>
<P>
Completing the program: familiar principals in Balanchine's effervescent "Ballo 
della Regina" and William Forsythe's abrasive "In the Middle, Somewhat 
Elevated," both group vehicles of the utmost difficulty that have evolved into 
company staples. 
</P>
<P>
New to the pageboy-ballerina role of the Forsythe, however, was Muriel Maffre, 
a glamorous, young Parisian ballerina with pale skin, perfectly symmetrical 
features and a way of making the fierce technical bravado of the choreography 
seem a sensuous caprice.

MOVABLE FEASTS: SPECIAL DELIVERIES FROM THE CREATIVE GOURMET IN WEST L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By L.N. HALLIBURTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I once read a paper in an anthropology journal on "Shopping on Fairfax." The 
author, who had clearly done her fieldwork, noted that the majority of 
customers would look at the offerings on the counters and shelves, then take 
the butcher, the fishmonger or greengrocer aside and ask for a "nice" piece of 
meat, fish, chicken or fruit to be pulled from the back or from an unpacked 
box. Who wants the "ordinary"? We all want the "special," the cream of the 
crop. 
</P>
<P>
The Creative Gourmet, which delivers to homes and offices throughout the 
Westside, carries this state of mind. 
</P>
<P>
What's a "nice" takeout meal? It doesn't mean knock 'em down fabulous; it means 
plentiful, fresh, with some extra touch. The Creative Gourmet's presentation 
alone puts it into this class: You'll find black plastic ware, hard black 
patent-leather-look plates, decorated napkins, mints, sandwiches wrapped like 
favors for a Sweet 16 party, cookies tucked into shiny black "nice store" 
shopping bags. 
</P>
<P>
The Creative Gourmet's large menu (you can call and have it sent to you) 
abounds in salads that make a full-sized lunch. The fruit salad, a lush 
still-life against those black plates, is a real doll of a meal -- and clearly 
depends on what's hot at the market that day. Mine came full of really sweet 
pineapple, large potent strawberries and raspberries, baby apples and pears, a 
little pot of yogurt with real blueberries and a short course in melons, one 
more beautiful than the next. Called Fruit Paradise, it's $7.95. 
</P>
<P>
The Greek salad ($7.30), normal and "nice" with ripe feta and calamata olives, 
was out of the ordinary for one reason: a mountain of oregano-suffused bow-tie 
pasta underneath the salad soaks up the dressing in a gorgeous midnight-raid 
combo kind of way. 
</P>
<P>
The Caesar ($3.95 and $5.95) and the Salade Nicoise ($7.95) are both impeccably 
fresh and generously portioned, but the former was salty and topped with 
packaged croutons while the latter, with a wonderful creamy vinaigrette and a 
good 7 ounces of moist tuna, used dumb canned olives. 
</P>
<P>
The mixed green Garden Patch ($3.95 and $5.95) arrives with a lilting raspberry 
vinaigrette and, supposedly (not in my order), a piece of "gourmet cheese." 
Plain, lightly marinated zucchini, broccoli, cauliflower and carrots ($7.95) 
were admirably crunchy and served on a delicious large platter of basil-laden 
long-grain rice. 
</P>
<P>
The "nice" quotient fell considerably with the turkey primavera ($8.95), a 
great mass of salty processed turkey, frozen peas and carrots, perfectly 
respectable fettuccine and altogether too much mayonnaise. Curry chicken 
($8.95) was full of deeply flavored real chicken, cut fruit and too much rich 
sour-cream-based dressing. 
</P>
<P>
Shanghai shrimp ($11.95), full of big fat sweet juicy shrimp, peanuts, 
carefully cut vegetables and a large tangle of chive angel hair pasta, was 
"nice." Jade scallops ($11.95) came with a generous portion of moist scallops, 
more of that unusually good long-grain rice served with the vegetable plate 
and, unfortunately, an odd medicinal-tasting orange sauce. 
</P>
<P>
If I had to have lunch at my desk, I think the look alone of the sandwiches 
would cheer me up: Their long, soft rolls come wrapped in glitzy pink tissue 
paper with an olive, sailing like a flag off a yacht, at one end. A "Santa Fe" 
roast beef sandwich ($5.75), niftily spiced with cumin (but not one whit of the 
mentioned cilantro), has the merest filaments of mild jalapenos: It's more 
Phoenix than Santa Fe. The Seafood Treasure ($5.75) with itsy shrimp, faux crab 
and a slaw with a commercial tang, tastes like the kind of unfortunate "ladies" 
sandwich I would have with my mother when we went to try on coats. The salmon 
mousse and nearly ineffable dill dressing in the Chic Conspiracy are a rich mix 
that, on top of the dark roll, taste like a dead ringer for soft pumpernickel 
bagel and lox cream cheese. 
</P>
<P>
A bag full of just-baked oatmeal and chocolate chip cookies is unimpeachably, 
totally "nice." 
</P>

TIVOLI IN PACIFIC PALISADES: ITALIAN NEVER TASTED SO HEALTHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Mom," asked the young boy at the next table, "can I have a Diet Coke?" 
</P>
<P>
His parents, dressed as if for a hike in the Rockies, beamed indulgently. We 
were in Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, you'd have to call Tivoli Cafe a sort of Italian diner. It's a 
crowded, brightly lit place with tiny tables where you pick your wine not by 
poring through a printed list but by grabbing one of the bottles stacked around 
the wall. But as the diet-conscious family was wearing the best quality hiking 
gear, you'd have to call Tivoli a high-class Italian diner. Even a diet Italian 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
It starts out with very good bread, which could be expected, since the 
proprietors' husbands own Il Forno in Santa Monica. The soup might be mushroom: 
a pure, intense mushroom puree, with no cream. Or it might be corn with a 
fragile hint of cilantro. 
</P>
<P>
Tivoli's version of calamari is distinctive, the squid mixed with shrimp, 
yellow and red sweet peppers, black olives and capers. The white bean salad is 
a wholesome item that could certainly be recommended to the diet-conscious 
hiking family: cold Italian white beans and tuna with basil, mild red onions 
and vinaigrette. The vegetable plate is doubtless healthful: carrots, squashes 
and a broiled tomato, not grilled as one might expect. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly what's going on here, though, is pizzas, a long list that incidentally 
includes a dietarily inspired model called the Ken: shiitake mushrooms and 
tomato sauce, but no cheese. Whatever you order, you may get handed a sample. 
The idea of a cheeseless pizza takes getting used to, but it's actually light 
and enjoyable on its own terms. 
</P>
<P>
The pizzas, all on tasty medium-thick dough, include most of the designer 
favorites of recent years: "Popeye" (spinach and goat cheese), quattro 
stagioni, quattro formaggio and so on. Several have local names. The Santa 
Monica uses low-fat cheese; the Malibu is topped with quite smoky mozzarella 
and lamb sausage; the Palisades is a very tasty model combining duck sausage, 
dried tomatoes and sharp goat cheese. 
</P>
<P>
The non-pizza entrees include some sandwiches, including a very satisfying lamb 
sandwich on a crusty bun with lettuce, tomatoes and brown gravy. There are 
always some specials as well, possibly whitefish with a slightly spicy sauce 
consisting of chopped tomatoes, red bell peppers and a little bit of hot 
pepper. The version of Dijon chicken comes in a somewhat peculiar sauce that 
tastes slightly of mustard and strongly of chicken broth. 
</P>
<P>
There's a cheesecake with a lot of integrity, and certainly a lot of cheese 
flavor. As an alternative to the usual tartuffo ice cream dessert, there are 
some fruit sherbets of impressive purity: just frozen fruit pulp, with no sugar 
or dairy products. The papaya ice comes in a hollowed-out papaya, and tastes 
pretty good for something so blamed healthful. 
</P>
<P>
The best dessert, though, has no health excuse at all. It's the tirami su made 
by the mother of one of the owners: ladyfingers soaked in espresso, mixed with 
creamy sweetened mascarpone cheese and stacked like cordwood. It is one of the 
most authoritative versions of tirami su around. No health excuse at all. 
</P>
<P>
Madam, listen to me. Give your son a break. Just once, give him a little tirami 
su. There'll be time enough for papaya ice. 
</P>
<P>
 Tivoli Cafe, 15306 Sunset Blvd., Pacific Palisades. (213) 459-7685. Open for 
lunch and dinner Monday through Saturday. Wine only. Street parking. MasterCard 
and Visa accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $22-$48.

SELLARS SHAPES OWN VERBAL REALITY IN MOYERS INTERVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"For most people, the only reality is a verbal reality," director/impresario 
Peter Sellars says early in a two-part "World of Ideas" interview with Bill 
Moyers, beginning tonight at 7:35 on KCET Channel 28. (Part 2 is scheduled for 
March 30 at the same time.) 
</P>
<P>
Sellars is attacking our society's exaggerated trust in words over other forms 
of expression. However, his own verbal manipulation of reality throughout the 
hour amounts to a highly revealing virtuoso performance. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Sellars attacks painter Norman Rockwell for distortions of detail 
that, he says, result in falsification. Yet in a lengthy art-versus-racism 
parable about the 1988 Festival of Pacific Arts in Townsville, Australia, 
Sellars manages to falsify nearly all the evidence he cites. 
</P>
<P>
He describes the event as being staged in a wild and desolate place, with no 
money, as an aboriginal protest against the Australian Bicentennial. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Townsville is a popular tourist center near the Great Barrier Reef, 
the event is a pan-Pacific festival held every four years in a different 
country -- and it involved performers from many cultures, not just aboriginals. 
Finally, the 1988 funding included private contributions, heavy subsidy by the 
24 guest nations, plus a grant from the Australian government of $4.8 million 
Australian. 
</P>
<P>
Moyers accepts Sellars' Aussie bull (guff) without question -- though, 
elsewhere, he does comment on Sellars' rhetoric and even ventures a memorable 
career analysis of his subject: "You've been fired from more jobs than George 
Bush has held and you just keep going. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Southern California viewers will be especially intrigued by Sellars' opinions 
of Los Angeles and his plans for the 1990 L.A. Festival. (He is the artistic 
director of the September event.) He sees the city as "either the ultimate 
Tower of Babel that will completely collapse in on itself or it's the start of 
a new society. 
</P>
<P>
"More different types of people are living here now than have ever lived in any 
city in the history of the world," he says. However, he also finds Los Angeles 
"the most segregated city I've ever lived in . . . neighboring city-states with 
hostile border regions." 
</P>
<P>
His festival will reflect the diversity of Los Angeles, he says, and maybe help 
integrate it. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had my druthers," he says with a laugh, "I would send out all the tickets 
to the festival and send everyone the wrong tickets . . . and have people 
showing up at things they never wanted to see." Who said talk is cheap? LEWIS

<P>
OIL SPILL: AN ANCHORAGE JURY FINDS THE EXXON VALDEZ SKIPPER CULPABLE ONLY ON A 
MINOR POLLUTION COUNT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former tanker skipper Joseph Hazelwood, accused of being drunk, reckless and 
most responsible for the nation's worst oil spill, was acquitted of all but a 
minor pollution charge by an Alaskan jury Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In a crowded courtroom that included his wife and father, Hazelwood, 43, was 
found not guilty of felony mischief, operating a vessel while under the 
influence of alcohol and reckless endangerment. 
</P>
<P>
The lone guilty verdict was for the negligent discharge of oil, a misdemeanor 
carrying a maximum penalty of 90 days in jail and a $1,000 fine, far less than 
the 7 years and $61,000 fine he faced if convicted on all counts. 
</P>
<P>
The verdicts came two days before the anniversary of the grounding of the Exxon 
Valdez, which spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil into Alaska's Prince 
William Sound after slamming into a reef and ripping open its hull. 
</P>
<P>
The jury deliberated less than 11 hours. Bursts of applause greeted each "not 
guilty" verdict read by Judge Karl Johnstone. Attorney Michael Chalos 
triumphantly slammed the defense table with his fist when the felony charge 
fell first. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not done. We're going to appeal that misdemeanor, but we're very happy 
that all the serious charges were rejected," Chalos said later. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing was set for this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the appeal results, however, legal problems stemming from the 
grounding of the Exxon Valdez will continue to haunt Hazelwood and his former 
employer, Exxon Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The company still faces federal criminal charges, and Hazelwood is named in 
about 150 civil lawsuits seeking financial damages for the oil spill that 
polluted hundreds of miles of Alaskan shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear how Hazelwood's exoneration on serious criminal charges might 
affect those other cases, but state prosecutors had argued at the close of 
Hazelwood's trial that Exxon would benefit from an acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors were clearly swayed by defense arguments that the disastrous grounding 
was an accident, not a crime. Some members of the panel said after the verdict 
that they felt Hazelwood had been negligent, but not criminally reckless, when 
he left the bridge about 12 to 15 minutes before the accident. 
</P>
<P>
The bearded Hazelwood was as stoic in victory as he had been through more than 
seven weeks of trial, but he smiled broadly as reporters and television cameras 
mobbed the defense table moments after the jury was polled. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just relieved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been long and difficult. I was a pretty anonymous character up until 
about a year ago," Hazelwood told reporters outside the courthouse. "I'm going 
to try to get on with my life now. I'd like to go back to sea. . . . It's what 
I do." 
</P>
<P>
His attorney said that Hazelwood may talk to Exxon about reinstatement and 
would fight an expected U.S. Coast Guard effort to revoke his master's license. 
"The only job he ever had was working on tankers owned or operated by Exxon, so 
I suspect that's what he wants to do is go back to work as a captain," Chalos 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Morakis, a spokesman for Exxon in New York, said the company, which has 
fired Hazelwood, was "pleased that the ordeal of the trial is over for captain 
Hazelwood and his family. 
</P>
<P>
"The verdict would seem to confirm the view that the grounding of the Exxon 
Valdez was an accident," Morakis said. "In light of pending litigation, any 
other comment would be inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
After the verdict, jury foreman Lori Wing stood and smiled at Hazelwood, 
wishing him "good luck" before disappearing into the judge's chambers with her 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood's tearful father, airline pilot Joseph O. Hazelwood, pushed through 
the media throng to embrace Chalos and greet his son. Suzanne Hazelwood, the 
former captain's wife, reached through the crowd to squeeze her husband's hand, 
then hurried from the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courtroom, Hazelwood at one point broke away from his attorneys to 
shake hands with one of the jurors, Jeffrey Sage, a 28-year-old grocery 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad to see justice done, Mr. Hazelwood," Sage said. "So am I. Thank you," 
Hazelwood responded. 
</P>
<P>
Sage, whose sister was killed by a drunk driver more than 10 years ago, 
ridiculed the state's drunk driving case against Hazelwood. He noted, for 
example, testimony of the 21 witnesses who saw Hazelwood before and after the 
grounding, all of whom said he did not appear to be under the influence of 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
"For him to have had as much to drink as the state said he did, he would've had 
to crawl back to the ship," Sage scoffed. "He would've been dead." 
</P>
<P>
The key sobriety test, taken 10 hours after the grounding, proved only that the 
captain's blood alcohol level was .061%, slightly above the Coast Guard's 
permissible level but well below the state's .10% minimum standard. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors brought in an Oklahoma toxicologist who used a complicated, and 
scientifically controversial, formula to estimate that Hazelwood was legally 
drunk when he sailed from Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
The defense argued that Hazelwood, alone in his cabin and believing that his 
career had just ended on Bligh Reef, drank after the accident and skewed the 
test results. No evidence of that was presented during the trial, however, and 
Hazelwood did not testify. 
</P>
<P>
Sage also said the panel concluded that Hazelwood's orders before and after the 
grounding "all were prudent and precise. He was not impaired." 
</P>
<P>
Fellow juror Terrill Smith said the panel was leaning to acquittal from the 
very first ballot, although it took some time to reach unanimous agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The incident that provoked the most discussion, the two jurors said, was 
Hazelwood's absence from the bridge, leaving his third mate responsible for 
steering around ice floes. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Brent Cole had argued that was an example of criminal recklessness. 
The jury agreed with the defense, which noted that Hazelwood had given the 
correct course instructions and was not behaving differently than other 
captains in similar situations. 
</P>
<P>
Both jurors also criticized the Coast Guard, which operates a $70-million 
vessel traffic center in Valdez. Coast Guard radar operators had failed to 
alert the Exxon Valdez that it was heading for the rocks of Bligh Reef. 
</P>
<P>
"They obviously weren't doing their jobs," Sage said of the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the issue of who is to blame for the disastrous effects of the spill 
remains unresolved, at least to some extent. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers had complained since the outset that Hazelwood was being held 
responsible not only for the grounding -- which they conceded was "a tragic 
accident" -- but also for the "botched containment and cleanup." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people shared the blame for what happened, but all sides were trying 
to sink captain Hazelwood. The state of Alaska, the Coast Guard, the federal 
government, they all wanted him to be their scapegoat," said Tom Russo, another 
defense attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps now people will look beyond the captain." 
</P>
<P>
Environmental groups quickly reacted to the verdict by agreeing with the 
defense characterization of Hazelwood as a scapegoat. "Exxon, not one of its 
employees, should have been tried," said Robert H. Sulnick, executive director 
of Santa Monica-based American Oceans Campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Manheim, spokesman for the Environmental Defense Fund in Washington, 
D.C., said "we think Mr. Hazelwood has been to some extent set up by that 
corporation as a scapegoat and that Exxon is the real culprit in this 
disaster," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska Atty. Gen. Douglas Baily said at a news conference in Juneau that he was 
pleased with the verdict and had congratulated the prosecutors on the single 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
He said the prosecution had proceeded against Hazelwood "certainly not as a 
scapegoat, but as a result of his own involvement as we saw it. It was always 
my view that the captain of that vessel is ultimately responsible." 
</P>
<P>
Former Valdez Mayor John Devins said Hazelwood was never the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"The real issue confronting the state of Alaska is whether industry is prepared 
to prevent another oil spill," said Devins, now a candidate for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood's legal battles began within a few days of the grounding. He was 
still in Valdez when the Coast Guard served a summons notifying the captain 
that his license would be reviewed. Exxon immediately fired the skipper. 
</P>
<P>
Relieved of command and a job, and with his personal security in some doubt, 
the grounded captain drove to Anchorage and flew home to Huntington, Long 
Island, apparently unaware that local law enforcement officials were preparing 
a criminal action against him. 
</P>
<P>
In the next few days, Hazelwood would become the object of a highly publicized 
manhunt launched by embarrassed Alaskan officials who didn't know he had left 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, however, accompanied by his attorneys, Hazelwood surrendered 
to a court near his Long Island home. Amid a circus of reporters and TV 
cameras, a Suffolk County judge accused Hazelwood of complicity in an 
environmental disaster comparable to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. 
</P>
<P>
Bail was set at $1 million. Hazelwood spent a night in the county jail before 
an appeals court reduced it to $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Last May a grand jury in Alaska added the most serious charge -- a felony count 
of criminal mischief that carried a potential penalty of five years in prison 
-- setting the stage for the trial that began Feb. 5.

JAPANESE MAY BUY 7-ELEVEN'S PARENT FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The financially strapped parent of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain, 
Southland Corp., announced Thursday that it has agreed to sell 75% of the 
company to its longtime Japanese partner in a tentative deal roughly valued at 
more than $750 million. 
</P>
<P>
If completed, the acquisition would be the biggest Japanese investment ever in 
a U.S. retailer. The proposal was announced one week after another Japanese 
company disclosed plans to buy a major stake in the fashionable Saks Fifth 
Avenue clothing chain. 
</P>
<P>
However, some called the buyout agreement between Southland and Ito-Yokado Co. 
simply the beginning of negotiations among the companies and investors holding 
the Dallas firm's junk bonds. The current terms call for Ito-Yokado and its 
7-Eleven Japan Co. subsidiary to invest $400 million in cash and assume the 
junk bond debt remaining from the deal that turned Southland into a private 
company in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
For the Southland acquisition to succeed, investors owning at least 95% of 
various categories of Southland junk bonds would have to give their approval. 
</P>
<P>
That consent, analysts said, could be hard to obtain because the proposal 
offers relatively little in the way of financial incentives to bondholders. 
Under the current plan, bondholders overall would get 10% of the company and 
some securities, but they would have to give up bonds paying interest of more 
than 15% annually. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the negotiating positions of all the parties are flexible. Otherwise, 
this could end up in bankruptcy," said Robert E. Lupo, head of high-yield bond 
research at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Southland, parent of the world's biggest network of conveniences stores, has 
been brought to the brink of collapse largely by the huge interest payments 
stemming from the $4.9-billion management buyout in 1987. At the time, 
Southland was maneuvering to avert a takeover by Canadian investor Samuel 
Belzberg. 
</P>
<P>
But Southland, along with the Campeau Corp. department stores and others in the 
currently battered U.S. retailing industry, took on junk bond debt after 
overestimating how much business it would do in coming years. "It was part of 
the frenzy of the '80s," said Carol Palmer, an analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps 
in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of prospering, Southland was hit hard by stepped-up competition from 
supermarket and drugstore chains and from oil firms that opened up convenience 
stores of their own. 
</P>
<P>
In November, Southland acknowledged that it faced a cash crisis and began 
working on a corporate overhaul. As part of that overhaul, it sold its 58 
stores in Hawaii for $75 million to Ito-Yokado's 7-Eleven Japan unit. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Southland entered into negotiations to sell its 50% stake in Citgo 
Petroleum Corp. for $661.5 million to Petroleos de Venezuela S.A., the 
state-owned oil company. 
</P>
<P>
Still, with big bond interest payments coming due in June, Southland kept 
looking for an acquirer. 
</P>
<P>
In Ito-Yokado, Southland is working with what it termed the second-largest, but 
most profitable, "superstore" and supermarket chain operator in Japan. Along 
with its 50.3% stake in 7-Eleven Japan, Ito-Yokado owns a 51% interest in 
Denny's Japan Co. Overall, Ito-Yokado employs more than 38,700 full- and 
part-time workers. 
</P>
<P>
The 7-Eleven Japan unit is the largest convenience store company in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Southland is the owner or franchiser of 7,000 convenience stores and 
has agreements with affiliates that operate an additional 5,900 outlets in the 
United States and 21 other countries. 
</P>
<P>
The company, founded 62 years ago, has long been considered a pillar of Dallas' 
business establishment and is 94% owned or controlled by the city's Thompson 
family. Observers said the purchase of majority control of the company by 
Japanese interests might in some circles be considered a blow to the community. 
The Thompsons would be left with only 15% of Southland. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure there'll be people who express concern, but you have to remember that 
this is a company with whom Southland has had a long-term relationship," Robert 
Mead, a Southland spokesman, said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Japanese investors have spent enormous sums in U.S. real estate, banks 
and industrial companies, they have been reluctant to make large direct 
investments in American retailers. So far, the biggest such investment has been 
Jusco's purchase of Talbots, an apparel chain, for $325 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts have said that Japanese retailers have shied away from U.S. 
investments out of concern that they are not familiar enough with American 
consumer tastes. On Thursday, however, some industry experts suggested that 
Japanese buyers may now be on the prowl for U.S. merchandisers. 
</P>
<P>
Louis J. Grabowsky, a partner in the Dallas office of the accounting firm 
Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., said that Japanese investors with long-term 
strategies are likely to be interested in some U.S. retailers with short-term 
cash problems, such as Southland and the Campeau chains.

BIG ADVANCE IN GENETIC TREATMENTS REPORTED; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: RESEARCHERS SAY NEW TECHNIQUE COULD ALLOW DOCTORS TO FIGHT DISEASES 
SUCH AS MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY SIMPLY BY INJECTING MATERIAL DIRECTLY INTO MUSCLE 
TISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Researchers have developed a revolutionary way to treat genetic diseases that 
could greatly accelerate human gene therapy, which has been delayed for a 
decade by ethical considerations and technical problems. 
</P>
<P>
Special genetic material would simply be injected into muscle tissue every few 
days or weeks in much the same fashion that insulin is now injected daily to 
treat diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
The technique, developed by San Diego and Wisconsin scientists, could apply to 
a wide range of genetic diseases for which there is now no adequate therapy, 
ranging from muscular dystrophy to rare diseases of the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
It might also serve as a way to deliver genetic engineering products, such as 
human growth hormone, much more cheaply than is currently possible. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, according to researchers, it could be a valuable tool in the 
search for an AIDS vaccine or to help fight infections by the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
Conventional gene therapy involves using genetic-engineering techniques to 
replace a defective gene that causes illness with a healthy one. Geneticists 
have not yet received approval from regulatory agencies to attempt such therapy 
in humans. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, scientists have experimented with replacing defective genes by using 
special viruses to insert healthy genetic material into an individual's own 
DNA. But researchers and critics have feared that the viruses would insert the 
genes at the wrong site in DNA, thereby disrupting healthy genes. 
</P>
<P>
In the surprisingly simple new technique, the researchers would simply inject 
specially prepared genetic material into the person's muscle tissue, 
stimulating production of an enzyme or protein whose absence is the cause of 
the disease. The protein would be carried by the bloodstream to body tissues 
where it is needed. 
</P>
<P>
Because a virus is not used, the injected material would pose no risk to the 
recipient's genes. 
</P>
<P>
The added genetic material would break down in a period of days to weeks, so 
the genetic therapy would be reversible if adverse effects should appear. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers, from Vical Inc. in San Diego and the University of Wisconsin 
Medical Center in Madison, report in today's Science magazine that they have 
used the technique successfully to produce proteins in mice. They hope to 
extend the studies to humans within five years, most likely for the treatment 
of muscular dystrophy. 
</P>
<P>
"We are ushering in a very major change . . . that is going to push gene 
therapy ahead much faster in the next decade," said biochemist Philip L. 
Felgner of Vical. 
</P>
<P>
Although the researchers were looking for a way to introduce genetic 
information into cells, their discovery was serendipitous. 
</P>
<P>
Felgner and his colleagues were working with messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), 
which serves as a sort of working copy of the genetic information contained in 
DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) that is used by the cell's protein-making 
machinery. 
</P>
<P>
The mRNA has certain potential therapeutic applications in its own right, and 
many laboratories are looking for ways to get it inside cells. Vical has been 
working with liposomes, microscopic globules of fat that would encase the mRNA 
and carry it into cells. To test how well the liposomes worked, researchers 
decided to inject naked mRNA into tissues, assuming that none of it would make 
it into cells. 
</P>
<P>
They were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
The naked mRNA was taken up by the cells faster than the mRNA in liposomes. "I 
didn't believe it at first," said medical geneticist Jon A. Wolff of Wisconsin. 
"It was a total surprise," Felgner added. "Nobody would have even thought to 
(try it)." 
</P>
<P>
After they convinced themselves that the mRNA was being taken up, research 
progressed rapidly. "The procedure is extremely simple," Felgner said. "It's 
simple to administer the mRNA, and it's simple to make it. It's straightforward 
molecular biology." 
</P>
<P>
They do have to modify the mRNA, though. Special segments of RNA must be added 
to the ends of the RNA gene for the cells to make proteins from it. Additional 
segments must be added if the cells are to secrete the proteins into the 
bloodstream. 
</P>
<P>
The mRNA is broken down and absorbed by the cells within two or three days, so 
continuous replacement is necessary. But Felgner and Wolff have been able to 
circumvent that problem by modifying the genetic information so that it 
persists for as long as six months. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most promising uses of the technique might be for treating muscular 
dystrophy, which causes progressive weakening and wasting of muscles. About one 
in every 3,500 males develops the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers discovered two years ago that the muscle cells of muscular 
dystrophy victims lack a specific protein, called dystrophin, that is necessary 
for muscle function. Felgner speculates that the new technique could readily be 
used to have muscle cells produce the protein right where it is needed. He is 
now preparing experiments in which the dystrophin gene will be injected into 
dystrophic mice, and hopes to have them completed by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The technique theoretically could also be used to treat any genetic disease 
requiring that a protein or enzyme be released into the blood. In one type of 
rare immunodeficiency disease that genetic engineers are contemplating 
treating, for example, the victims are missing a crucial enzyme called 
adenosine deaminase. 
</P>
<P>
Felgner speculates that such a condition could be treated easily with the new 
technique, so that muscle cells would secrete the missing enzyme. 
</P>
<P>
Other missing hormones and biological agents that now must be injected on a 
regular basis, such as human growth hormone, could be produced in the same 
fashion. Because injections of a plasmid would be required only every six 
months or so, rather than daily or several times a week, the cost would be 
greatly reduced. 
</P>
<P>
The technique probably could not be used for treating diabetes, however, 
because the production of insulin must be much more closely regulated than is 
possible in muscle cells. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the technique could be used to produce vaccines against the AIDS virus 
and others. If muscle cells could be induced to produce certain AIDS proteins, 
speculated immunologist Howard Gray of Cytel Corp. in San Diego, a much more 
effective immune response would be produced against the virus.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS GOVERNOR; 
</P>
<P>
VAN DE KAMP TO FIRE ON FEINSTEIN WITH FIRST NEGATIVE AD IN RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEITH LOVE, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pow! 
</P>
<P>
It didn't take long for the TV commercials in the California governor's race to 
turn negative. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the earliest such attacks in recent state political history, Democrat 
John K. Van de Kamp plans to run ads this weekend that accuse Dianne Feinstein 
of mismanaging San Francisco when she was mayor from 1978 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp once ignored Feinstein, his opponent in the June 5 primary, and 
concentrated on the presumptive Republican nominee, U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
But he started attacking her record after she rocketed to a 19-point lead over 
him in the most recent Los Angeles Times Poll. 
</P>
<P>
She also led Wilson by 11 points in the same survey. A dramatic biographical ad 
she ran about herself in February was credited with her rise in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp spokesman Duane Peterson refused Thursday to discuss the negative 
commercial with a Times reporter who has seen it and said at one point: "It is 
not on the air yet and it is our private property and whoever showed it to you 
is breaking the law." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson also refused to grant an interview with the person who did the 
research for the Van de Kamp ad, deputy campaign manager Vicky Rideout. 
</P>
<P>
The Van de Kamp attack on Feinstein's record is standard in the TV-dominated 
world of modern politics, where negative spots have been found to be very 
effective. The ad is not a personal attack on Feinstein, which distinguishes it 
from the most controversial ads of the genre. 
</P>
<P>
But the cassette of the Van de Kamp ad provided television stations is labeled 
"bio/Van de Kamp campaign" even though it is not a biography of Van de Kamp. 
This makes it difficult for anyone reading the label to know that it is an 
attack on Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
But the ad most definitely is not about Van de Kamp. It is about Feinstein and 
it is tough. 
</P>
<P>
"She was cited for dumping a billion gallons of sewage in the Bay," it begins, 
showing a photo of Feinstein alongside a newspaper headline reading: "Billion 
Gallon Sewage Spill -- SF Faces Fine." The ad goes on to make five other 
specific charges about Feinstein's stewardship of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
But the Van de Kamp attack takes some liberties with the record of Feinstein, 
who was named one of the top municipal executives in the nation by an industry 
magazine in 1987. For one thing, Feinstein actually built a sewage treatment 
system for the city during her tenure and the Bay is cleaner today than it has 
been in years. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-second spot, produced for Van de Kamp by the Washington firm of Doak, 
Shrum &amp; Associates, ends with a tagline that says: "Dianne Feinstein: If 
she couldn't manage a city, how could she manage California?" 
</P>
<P>
The attack is a sharp departure in strategy for Van de Kamp, who said several 
months ago that he hoped the governor's campaign would be a discussion of the 
issues, including the November ballot initiative on the environment, which he 
is sponsoring. 
</P>
<P>
Word of the Van de Kamp attack ad reached the Wilson campaign Thursday, where 
there was jubilation. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson press secretary Bill Livingstone said he fully expected Feinstein to "go 
negative now and point out John Van de Kamp's record in the Hillside Strangler 
case." 
</P>
<P>
That was a reference to Van de Kamp's decision as Los Angeles County district 
attorney a decade ago not to seek a murder conviction of Hillside Strangler 
Angelo Buono. The judge turned the case over to the state and it got the 
conviction. Van de Kamp has since called his decision "an error in judgment." 
</P>
<P>
But Feinstein's chief consultants, William Carrick and Hank Morris, said 
Thursday they had not decided whether to attack Van de Kamp in TV ads. 
</P>
<P>
"This attack on Dianne is right in line with the Van de Kamp strategy," Morris 
said. "Just as his campaign tried to emphasize the ballot initiatives he is 
sponsoring, the plan all along was to do anything but emphasize Van de Kamp 
himself. They know if they do that they will lose." 
</P>
<P>
Carrick charged that "Van de Kamp has no credibility for these attacks on 
Dianne" because Van de Kamp's own biographical spot implies that he supports 
the death penalty by showing a photo of a gas chamber and saying that as 
attorney general Van de Kamp has kept 277 people on Death Row in California. 
</P>
<P>
"But it is totally fraudulent because Van de Kamp is opposed to the death 
penalty and said on Century Cable recently that he would not vote for capital 
punishment if he were in the Legislature." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp's attack ad is scheduled to run in Los Angeles, San Francisco and 
Sacramento, according to TV industry sources, but he could change that today. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: THE TV CAMPAIGN The race: Governor. Whose ad? Democratic 
candidate and current Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp. Target of ad: His 
opponent, former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
What the ad says, with an analysis by Times political writer Keith Love: 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "She (Feinstein) was cited for dumping a billion gallons of sewage in the 
bay." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: The city was cited when it had an antiquated sewage treatment system 
that was in place when Feinstein became mayor in November, 1978. What the ad 
does not say is that Feinstein built a state-of-the-art sewage system that now 
gives primary and secondary treatment to all effluent dumped into San Francisco 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "The D.A. found her administration in daily violation of laws on hazardous 
waste." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Under Feinstein, the city of San Francisco was told by the district 
attorney in 1985 -- seven years after she became mayor -- that the handling of 
toxic wastes was badly in need of upgrading. She eventually appropriated money 
to hire more toxics inspectors and specialists. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "Pressured by oil interests, she refused to campaign for Proposition 65, 
the toxics initiative." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Feinstein actually held a press conference on Sept. 20, 1986 to 
endorse Prop. 65. But Feinstein acknowledges that she later met with Chevron 
Oil Co. executives and discussed Prop. 65. Asked if she had then tried to get 
out of the campaign, she said could not remember -- "This wasn't a huge 
incident in the life of a busy mayor." 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "The federal courts found her Fire Department out of control." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: That was a judge's complaint about the city Fire Department's alleged 
racial bias. A federal court found that her Fire Department was guilty of 
discrimination, a situation that had plagued previous mayors. Feinstein's final 
budget appropriated $2.5 million to hire 48 new firefighters, most of which 
were minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "And hundreds died due to city ambulance failures." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: The San Francisco Chronicle reported that cardiac arrest victims were 
dying needlessly because the city's ambulances were slow to respond and were 
not equipped with defibrillators to help revive heart attack victims. But San 
Francisco Director of Health Dr. David Werdegar said Thursday that the 
newspaper report contained "inflammatory charges." He also said, "When we went 
to Mayor Feinstein and told her we needed to upgrade our ambulance services, 
she immediately found the money in the budget to make a number of changes, 
including buying the defibrillators and having our firemen respond to medical 
emergencies." 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "She left behind a $180-million deficit the Chronicle called the worst in 
history." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Feinstein did not leave behind a $180-million deficit, according to 
both Feinstein and current city budget officials. Her final budget was 
balanced, as required by law, and actually left a surplus of $16 million. 
However, the first budget of Mayor Art Agnos for fiscal 1988-89 did project a 
deficit of $180 million, which was blamed on Feinstein's use of budget 
surpluses for capital expenditures in the 1980s. Feinstein says the deficit was 
caused by several factors beyond her control, including a decline in the sale 
of hydroelectric power and the settlement of lawsuits that will force Agnos to 
give millions of dollars in back pay to some city employees.

President Bush has declared a disaster in the state of Alabama and ordered 
federal recovery aid because of damage caused by severe storms and flooding. 
</P>

The storms and flooding struck the southeastern part of the state beginning 
March 15. 
</P>
<P>
Elba, Ala., in Coffee County, was inundated Saturday when a levee along the Pea 
River burst after the region was pummeled with up to 16 inches of rain. Across 
the South, the flooding forced hundreds to be evacuated and was blamed for at 
least 11 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Rescuers on Thursday found two missing servicemen along the Pea, where the pair 
had launched a canoe Wednesday to view flood damage. The search continued to 
the northeast in Dale County for a third soldier missing for four days. All 
three were based at Ft. Rucker, Ala., the U.S. Army's main flight training 
base. 
</P>
<P>
Rivers in Alabama continued to recede Thursday, but towns on the Florida 
Panhandle and in southern Georgia prepared for the bulge of water from last 
weekend's storms working its way downstream. 
</P>
<P>
In Florida, flooding along several rivers across the Panhandle caused about 
2,500 residents along the lower Choctawhatchee to flee. 
</P>
<P>
In Georgia, forecasters predicted that the Ocmulgee River would crest at seven 
feet above flood stage today in Hawkinsville.

Let it not be said that George Bush is indecisive. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not like broccoli," Bush declared at the end of a press conference 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't liked it since I was a little kid and my mother made me eat it, and 
I'm President of the United States, and I'm not going to eat any more 
broccoli." 
</P>
<P>
So there. 
</P>
<P>
California broccoli growers, irked by an item in U.S. News &amp; World Report 
disclosing that Bush had banned broccoli from Air Force One, on Tuesday 
dispatched to Washington 20,000 pounds of the green vegetable, which is high in 
calcium and vitamin A. 
</P>
<P>
But "I refuse to give ground," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are truckloads of broccoli at this very minute descending on 
Washington," he said. "For the broccoli vote out there, Barbara loves broccoli 
. . . . So she can go out and meet the caravan." 
</P>
<P>
"The broccoli growers of America are up in arms against me," Bush told visiting 
Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki at a White House state dinner 
Wednesday night. "Would you be interested in having the (shipment) in Poland?" 
</P>
<P>
"Just as Poland had a rebellion against totalitarianism, I am rebelling against 
broccoli," Bush told Mazowiecki, who looked somewhat baffled, according to 
reporters present at the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Bush "is a total totalitarian -- on broccoli only," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
"You're darn right I am," Mrs. Bush replied later. "Anyone who eats pork rinds 
(a favorite presidential snack) can't be all good." 
</P>
<P>
The broccoli shipment is expected to be turned over to a Washington-area food 
bank when it arrives in the capital on Monday. The White House is considering 
holding a welcome ceremony.

A decade-old medical mystery that has confounded investigators in the United 
States and Southeast Asia by killing young, apparently healthy Asian men in 
their sleep has taken a new turn with the deaths in a single day of two Thai 
construction workers in the island republic of Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
The two men, Wichit Khamwaen, 45, and Sitthi Sataisong, 27, apparently died in 
their sleep before dawn Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Sitthi's roommate told authorities that Sitthi had trouble breathing during the 
night, but he could not revive him. 
</P>
<P>
A third Thai died Wednesday, bringing to 13 the number of Thai workers who have 
died this year in Singapore under similar mysterious circumstances -- heart 
failure in the middle of the night, with no apparent symptoms or causes. 
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Ministry of Health said in a statement Sunday that about 200 
young Thais have died of the mysterious illness since 1983; about 20 young and 
seemingly healthy Thais died last year. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta have told the 
Singaporeans of similar deaths in the United States involving Southeast Asian 
immigrants. The U.S. deaths from the so-called Sudden Unexplained Nocturnal 
Death Syndrome average nearly four a month. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Thai Ministry of Labor reported Wednesday that of the 1,000 
Thais who have died in Saudi Arabia in the past two decades, about 60% died of 
unexplained heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
The unexplained deaths have stunned the estimated 200,000 Thais in Singapore, 
where they provide mainly low-cost labor as domestic servants and construction 
workers. Concern is so great that the Thai government dispatched a team of 
medical investigators from the Public Health Ministry to Singapore last week, 
but they returned home Tuesday without having solved the mystery. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't come up with any conclusion," said Ong-art Klamphaiboon, the public 
health official who led the delegation. 
</P>
<P>
Ong-art said the circumstances of the deaths in the Singapore cases appeared 
similar to those reported among Southeast Asians in the United States, a large 
percentage of whom live in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
One clue that was examined and then rejected was a method used by Thai 
construction workers to cook sticky rice, a staple of their diet. The workers 
used sections of plastic pipe as a steamer for the rice. When burned, the 
plastic material, also known as PVC, can give off poisonous gases. 
</P>
<P>
But Handrick Ng of the Singapore Health Ministry said the Thai workers were not 
raising the pipes to sufficiently high temperature to produce those gases. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides, an autopsy would show toxicity in the tissues but we found no such 
toxicity," Ng said. 
</P>
<P>
Another possible link being investigated is that all of the men who have died 
in Singapore are apparently from the same northeastern region of Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
Ng said researchers are considering the possibility that the workers succumbed 
because of some reaction to stressful work in the different climate. Northeast 
Thailand is primarily highland terrain, while Singapore is flat and tropical. 
</P>
<P>
Thai authorities, meanwhile, have arranged for the installation of more 
telephones at work camps in Singapore to help communicate with workers in case 
of emergency. They are also urging Thai workers there to learn cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation in the event further cases occur. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like playing Russian roulette, not knowing when a bullet will hit me," a 
young Thai worker told the Singapore Straits Times.

MULRONEY URGES UNITY, OFFERS PLAN ON QUEBEC

<P>
In a rare televised speech, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney on Thursday urged 
Canadians to "join together," and he proposed ways of resolving linguistic and 
constitutional arguments that have raised the possibility of Quebec splitting 
off from the rest of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt at compromise, Mulroney said he will introduce a new set of 
constitutional amendments into the Canadian House of Commons next week. His 
gesture was a tacit admission that another constitutional package that he 
himself had wanted is unacceptable. The compromise amendments are intended to 
be added to Mulroney's original ones, which were crafted in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Mulroney's remarks came at a time of growing public uneasiness and frustration 
in Canada over the political leadership's inability to agree on what the 
country stands for and how to embody those principles in law. 
</P>
<P>
Canada has been unable to get all 10 provinces to sign its constitution, as 
required. Over the last few months, arguments about the constitution have grown 
so bitter that prominent businessmen and politicians now routinely speculate on 
what the future would be like without Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
The current discord stems from 1982, when Canada "repatriated" its constitution 
from Britain. (Before then, its constitution was essentially an act of the 
British Parliament.) Each of Canada's 10 provinces was supposed to sign the 
constitution, but Quebec refused. 
</P>
<P>
To bring Quebec aboard, Mulroney oversaw the drafting of a set of amendments in 
1987 -- a package that has come to be known as the Meech Lake accord, after the 
Quebec resort where it was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
The Meech Lake amendments were mainly about redistributing economic and 
political power between the federal government and the provinces. However, they 
also recognized Quebec as a "distinct society" within Canada. Quebec was 
satisfied with this. All 10 provinces are required to ratify the accord by June 
23. 
</P>
<P>
At first, there was little controversy, but then elections were held. Three 
newly elected provincial premiers began expressing strong doubts about the 
accord. 
</P>
<P>
One of the worst sticking points was the clause declaring Quebec a "distinct 
society." Quebec had just enacted a law barring the use of any language except 
French on outdoor signs. That action fueled suspicions that the Meech Lake 
clause would encourage other divisive acts, such as the province establishing 
its own foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
Canada has been mired in this debate for months. Quebec has insisted that the 
accord be ratified as written, Mulroney has backed Quebec and the three holdout 
provincial premiers have said they won't sign unless the accord is modified. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ordinary Canadians have been steaming over the energy spent on what 
has appeared to be a hopeless impasse. 
</P>
<P>
By announcing that he would make additions to the Meech Lake accord to get 
things moving again, Mulroney made a nod toward the dissatisfied 
English-speaking provinces. But he risked incurring the wrath of Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
The new amendments would still grant Quebec a "distinct society" status, but 
they would also make the federal government responsible for promoting 
bilingualism all across Canada. And that would displease Quebec, where 
French-speakers have argued that their language must be shielded from English 
if it is to survive. 
</P>
<P>
Mulroney's new package of amendments was first introduced by New Brunswick 
Premier Frank McKenna earlier this week. McKenna, who was one of the three 
holdouts on the Meech Lake accord, told reporters, "It's time for all of us to 
spike our guns with flowers." 
</P>
<P>
But there was no guarantee that Mulroney's attempt at compromise would take 
root and grow. 
</P>
<P>
Just hours before the prime minister delivered his address, Newfoundland 
Premier Clyde Wells, another Meech Lake holdout, moved in his provincial 
legislature to kill the accord.

BUSH'S NEW SECURITY-STRATEGY PLAN SIDESTEPS ISSUE OF SOVIET TARGETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite sweeping changes in the East Bloc, President Bush's first National 
Security Strategy differs little from previous plans and makes no mention at 
all of Soviet targets that would be attacked in a nuclear war. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration was expected to begin revising the existing nuclear war 
plans because of the radically changed political atmosphere and the anticipated 
U.S.-Soviet strategic arms treaty to cut nuclear arsenals up to 50%. 
</P>
<P>
For example, at least hundreds of targets in Eastern Europe -- such as 
Bulgarian steel mills and Polish seaports -- are expected to be eliminated, now 
that political changes have loosened those countries' ties to the Soviet Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Since previous strategy reports have outlined Soviet target policy, the 
omission in the Bush report sent to Congress on Tuesday initially raised 
speculation that the Administration had begun a targeting review. However, a 
senior Administration official said the omission had "no particular 
significance." And other officials confirmed that the Pentagon under Bush is 
following the same guidance on targeting inherited from the Reagan 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
That guidance calls for attacking leadership bunkers occupied by party leaders, 
including Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whose reforms are supported by 
the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Various experts said the White House omitted any reference to targeting because 
a review of basic targeting concepts could undercut the Pentagon's request for 
new weapon systems, such as the B-2 Stealth bomber, which are designed to carry 
out the attacks as now planned. 
</P>
<P>
The President wrote that his strategy report comes at a time of "truly 
breathtaking" change and "historic opportunity" in international affairs. 
</P>
<P>
A report "fact sheet" highlighted 14 policies. When presidential aides were 
asked to identify one policy that was new since the Berlin Wall fell in 
November, they could not do so. 
</P>
<P>
"The report doesn't break a lot of new ground," one official admitted. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan Administration's language on targeting is apparently still reflected 
in the Pentagon's super-secret nuclear war plans. Reagan's 1988 strategy report 
said that targeting policy is to "hold at risk Soviet war-making capabilities, 
including both the full range of Soviet military forces and the war-supporting 
industry. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
It adds that the policy also is to "place at risk . . . the mechanisms for 
ensuring survival of the Communist Party and its leadership cadres. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
In its section on deterring nuclear war, the Bush report did not address 
targets. Instead, it reiterated the call for funding multibillion-dollar 
weapons programs: the B-2 Stealth bomber, the D-5 Trident submarine-launched 
missile and the MX and Midgetman mobile intercontinental missiles. 
</P>
<P>
"The Administration just doesn't want to raise the subject of targeting," said 
one expert. 
</P>
<P>
A European expert who recently talked with Administration officials said: "They 
don't want to rock the boat just now. It might cost them support for their 
program." 
</P>
<P>
A targeting review would certainly find that a significant portion of the 
current targets could be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way to bring the East Europeans into a war on the Soviet side today 
would be to attack them," one analyst said, expressing dismay that U.S. nuclear 
weapons apparently are still aimed at the newly reformed governments in 
Czechoslovakia and Poland. 
</P>
<P>
More important, a targeting review could raise doubts about aiming so many U.S. 
weapons at Soviet weapons because if the Soviets launched a surprise attack, 
the Soviet missiles would probably be en route rather than in their silos when 
U.S. warheads struck. 
</P>
<P>
"If they decided that such targeting doesn't make sense, it would undermine 
funding for the D-5 missile and maybe even the MX," another expert said.

TO AZERBAIJANIS, A TANK BY ANY NAME IS STILL A THREAT; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: ARMENIANS IN TROUBLED NAGORNO-KARABAKH HAVE PURCHASED 14 WITHOUT 
GUNS AND TURRETS AS 'AGRICULTURAL TOWING VEHICLES.'

<P>
With their heavy armored plating and tractor treads, they may look like tanks. 
With the full-throated roar of their engines, they sound like tanks. And, as 
they speed cross-country at 20 m.p.h., virtually unhindered by the hilly 
terrain, they certainly move like tanks. 
</P>
<P>
But, in the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh in the southern Soviet 
Union, these tank look-alikes are officially designated "agricultural towing 
vehicles." 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating further troubles with their Azerbaijani neighbors, Armenians in 
Nagorno-Karabakh have purchased 14 surplus T-54 main battle tanks from the 
Soviet Defense Ministry and deployed at least half of them last month, the 
newspaper Sovetskaya Rossiya reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Although their guns and turrets had been duly removed by military workshops 
before delivery to Nagorno-Karabakh, the tanks remain very formidable fighting 
vehicles, able to withstand automatic weapons and even artillery fire, to crash 
through walls and other obstacles and to travel easily across the territory's 
difficult terrain, according to the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, despite their official designation as agricultural vehicles, the 
tanks have been specially equipped at the Armenians' request with reinforced 
armored plating, high-power military radios and night-vision devices, 
Sovetskaya Rossiya reported. 
</P>
<P>
And, although the order was placed by the chief engineer of the agricultural 
department of Nagorno-Karabakh, an autonomous region in the southern Soviet 
republic of Azerbaijan, it appears to have been approved, financed and overseen 
by the road transport ministry of the neighboring republic of Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
Armenia and Azerbaijan have been in virtual conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh for 
two years, and the centuries-old enmity between their peoples has led to direct 
hostilities, involving armed militias on both sides, along their common border 
and in and around Nagorno-Karabakh in January. The contract for the 
decommissioned tanks, originally signed in December, 1989, led to a larger 
contract signed in February, but only seven of the tanks were actually 
delivered before higher authorities intervened. 
</P>
<P>
Recalling "how much concern and how much effort" went into the recovery of four 
tanks that were hijacked by militiamen while being delivered to soldiers at one 
Azerbaijani town in January, Sovetskaya Rossiya commented, "Even without their 
guns and ammunition, these tanks could do a lot of damage to the other side." 
</P>
<P>
In January, Armenian militias methodically attacked ordnance depots, emptying 
them of everything from pistols and rifles to mortars, howitzers, anti-aircraft 
artillery and armored vehicles. Azerbaijanis similarly built up large arsenals 
of weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"Both sides would clearly love to have tanks and armored vehicles," Sovetskaya 
Rossiya continued, "and they are ready to go to any lengths to obtain them. . . 
. The question is how they managed to do so." 
</P>
<P>
That answer is long, involved and, as Sovetskaya Rossiya's team of three 
correspondents found, often hard to believe. 
</P>
<P>
As told by army officers assigned to sell off the Defense Ministry's surplus 
equipment and material, Nagorno-Karabakh sent the chief engineer of its 
agricultural department to a sales fair in December and later signed a contract 
to buy 14 decommissioned T-54 and T-55 tanks, which it said were to be used to 
tow agricultural equipment once their turrets and guns were removed. 
</P>
<P>
That such tanks cost four times as much as a heavy-duty tractor, required 
special fuel and lubricants obtainable only through military channels and would 
still last only a few years, not a decade, was of little consequence, the paper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Economically, this vehicle is hopeless as agricultural equipment," an army 
colonel said. "The tank consumes far more fuel than any tractor, and its 500 
horsepower just does not have near the pull of a tractor with only 106 
horsepower." 
</P>
<P>
Another scam, uncovered only at the last minute, involved the shipment of a 
dozen of the Soviet Union's newest tanks to a Middle East purchaser, which 
would pay for them with shipments of computers and condoms. That already had 
imperiled the government's military conversion program. 
</P>
<P>
But the Nagorno-Karabakh chief engineer, R. Ayriyan, signed a $1.7-million 
contract in December to buy 14 tanks and asked that they be fitted with 
additional armor plating and other equipment. He later pledged to buy a total 
of 40 this year. 
</P>
<P>
The military, under heavy political pressure to convert as much of its 
equipment as possible to civilian use, should not be blamed for signing such a 
contract, Sovetskaya Rossiya said, noting that its original intention had been 
to write an article about "how tanks are changing their profession" in a time 
of peace. 
</P>
<P>
But the intended use in Nagorno-Karabakh -- namely, the apparent development of 
a local armored corps which could be used against Soviet security forces as 
well as neighboring Azerbaijanis -- showed the dangers of unsupervised sale of 
weapons, the paper commented. 
</P>
<P>
"If that is conversion, what are we going to tell the Americans?" the 
correspondents ask, recalling that the Soviet Union has made a major issue out 
of its reduction of tank forces. "But then, what are we going to tell our own 
countrymen down in the Caucasus?"

HUNGARY: A CANDIDATE'S OFFICIOUS SHOW OF SPEED AND POWER ATTRACTS HOWLS.

ZALASZENTGROT, Hungary 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A four-car caravan, headlights blazing in the bright morning sunshine, barrels 
along the back country roads near Lake Balaton -- a pair of sleek black 
Mercedes sedans with security cars fore and aft -- scattering the chickens and 
the barnyard dogs in the swirling dust of its passage. 
</P>
<P>
Some irony and perhaps a dash of pathos attends this whirlwind, unseen by the 
VIP passenger in the second of the sedans. It is laughter, from the kerchiefed 
old women sweeping their walkways with twig brooms, from a gang of children 
hanging out of schoolroom windows, all of them pointing down the road, big 
grins on their faces, howling with laughter. 
</P>
<P>
It's funny, it seems to them, to see the Communists racing to their last 
hurrah. 
</P>
<P>
For, indeed, it could only be a high-rolling Communist politician who would 
sweep through the countryside with such a conspicuous display of speed and 
power. In this case, it was Imre Pozsgay, 54, in his final days as minister of 
state in the Hungarian government, and once one of the most powerful political 
figures in Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
To be fair to Pozsgay (pronounced POHZ-GOY), he is no longer a Communist; he is 
one of the founding members of the Hungarian Socialist Party, the reconstituted 
Hungarian Socialist Workers Party. But, as Pozsgay himself says, "there is no 
gratitude in politics" and he is stuck, along with the rest of his fellow 
Socialists, with the Communist label, the most crippling liability possible for 
a politician fighting for a place in the elections to be held here Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
There is little encouragement in the news these days for men such as Pozsgay, 
even though they are at pains to suggest that they do find encouraging that in 
the East German elections last Sunday, the socialist vote amounted to 16%. In 
Hungary, polls predict that in the first free elections since 1945, the 
Socialists -- most Hungarians persist in calling them Communists whatever their 
official designation -- will get no more than 10% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Pozsgay is standing for election to Parliament from a constituency in Sopron, a 
city on Hungary's Western border. He is up against a young firebrand from the 
national youth party called Fidesz. The Fidesz candidate, Jozsef Szajer, an 
assistant law professor at a Budapest university, is a native son of Sopron. 
Cockily referring to Pozsgay as a "political coward," Szajer is convinced that 
he is headed for a big victory. 
</P>
<P>
He may be right, but because of complex election laws, Pozsgay is virtually 
assured a seat in Parliament anyway, as a part of his party's "national list." 
Still, for a man with Pozsgay's political ambition and still-considerable 
political muscle, the specter of defeat in a head-to-head race is unpleasant. 
</P>
<P>
Pozsgay wants to be president of Hungary, an ambition that many political 
analysts here now believe is beyond his grasp. A year ago, before the full 
blossoming of Hungary's new politics, his chances seemed much stronger. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Pozsgay was still one of the most popular politicians in the country, and 
easily the best known, by virtue of his long campaign to get out in front of 
the reform wing of the Communist party. 
</P>
<P>
It was Pozsgay who led the drive to force the party to reconsider the darker 
days of communism in Hungary, the 1956 revolution, a bloody national trauma 
that ended in a Soviet invasion. He was the first Communist politician to urge 
the historical rethinking, always an ordeal for Communists, and to flatly 
declare that, contrary to official dogma, the events of 1956 amounted to a 
"popular uprising," and not a "counterrevolution," as it had been in the 
orthodox view. 
</P>
<P>
It was Pozsgay, as well, who threw his early support behind the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum, now one of the parties opposing the Socialists in the current 
election campaign. Pozsgay formed his own reform group inside the Hungarian 
Socialist Workers Party and, largely because of his leadership, the reformers 
essentially took over and renamed the party last October. 
</P>
<P>
In all the sweeping changes that took place in Eastern Europe last year, 
Hungary was quiet, and made its own vital contribution to the upheavals in the 
East Bloc by throwing open its western borders to fleeing East Germans. Hungary 
was quiet in large part because the reforms being won in neighboring countries 
were already in motion here. And they were in motion not because of pressure 
from opposition groups, but because of reformers, Imre Pozsgay prominent among 
them, in the ruling Communist party. 
</P>
<P>
Pudgy, sallow-faced, gray-haired, Pozsgay looks like a middle-aged Charles 
Laughton, impeccably dressed in gray suit and muted tie, and moves through a 
crowd with a slow, soft, catlike grace. This week, traveling through small 
towns in rural Hungary, he looked like an urban grandee, stepping out of the 
fancy car to be greeted by local party workers, with their work clothes and 
ill-fitting sports jackets. 
</P>
<P>
Here, among the party faithful and unknown office-seekers, Pozsgay was 
applauded lustily. "It's an honor just to sit next to such an important 
personality," said one young candidate receiving Pozsgay's endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
But the rooms were small and so were the crowds, and the four cars full of 
aides and security men seemed to go with a campaign geared for higher power and 
a bigger scale, like an American gubernatorial campaign, say, dropped down in a 
bucolic village of Central Europe, overwhelmed by dogwood blossoms and the 
paralyzing splendor of a soft spring day. 
</P>
<P>
Like any politician, Pozsgay has his version of The Speech, delivered again and 
again in a succession of rooms like the one in Zalaszentgrot, where a banner 
hanging behind the speakers' table proclaims the party's motto for the 
campaign, "Nation, Progress, Security." 
</P>
<P>
Security, in the sense of stability, is the main thrust for the Socialists, an 
argument that suggests that the Socialists, with their links to present and 
past power structures, can somehow ensure change that is manageable, progress 
that will not be too great a wrench from the past. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been asked why the Hungarian Socialist Party is not shouting as loud as 
the others," Pozsgay began in Zalaszentgrot. "Well, we do not have a reason to 
hide ourselves and feel guilty, but we have no obligation to take part in a 
campaign of loud shouting and threats. . . . We don't want to get into that 
style of hostility." 
</P>
<P>
He admits, in his talks, that the party -- he means the old party -- made 
"mistakes" and "found itself on a dead-end street." But he argues that "without 
the Socialists, (change) would have happened here the way it happened in Bu 
charest. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if this party contributed nothing more than this, it is a significant 
contribution." 
</P>
<P>
But even in an audience full of friendly faces, there are some who reflect what 
is probably the larger view outside the party, which is, indeed, that the party 
is due more scorn than gratitude. 
</P>
<P>
One man spoke up in the question period and told Pozsgay that the "whole 
system" of the past was wrong, that he had worked "like an animal" all his life 
and now had nothing to show for it but a pensioner's income inadequate to keep 
up with steadily rising prices. "Now my wife is sick and I am too old to work 
any more. What do you have to say to this?" 
</P>
<P>
"There are lots of people like you and me," Pozsgay said with the politician's 
fluid knack of placing himself in the company of the impoverished, "who have 
worked all their lives for democracy. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Pozsgay admits that the campaign is difficult, the crowds sometimes small and 
the sensation frequent that the tide is running against him. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously," he said, "it is not a good feeling." 
</P>
<P>
But, declaring himself a one-man crusade against Hungary's natural pessimism, 
he believes he will win the election in Sopron. 
</P>
<P>
"As for defeat," he said, "you have to have that possibility in a democracy." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, he still plans, he said, to run for president when that election 
is held, probably in September. 
</P>
<P>
"In half a year," he said, "it is possible that the people will see our 
contribution." In six months of the new politics, he hopes, perhaps Imre 
Pozsgay will again look like a good bet for the Hungarian presidency. 
</P>
<P>
As though in practice for that once and future campaign, an aide came to 
extract him from the meeting and usher him out to the car, idling at the curb, 
its door held open. Pozsgay shook a few more hands, the door slammed shut, and 
the caravan roared off in a cloud of dust.

<TEXT>
<P>
Leaders of the feuding Romanian and ethnic Hungarian communities in this 
divided Transylvanian city agreed on some moves Thursday to end tensions that 
resulted in six deaths, hundreds of injured and a wave of strikes. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Gelu Voican headed compromise talks between the Hungarian 
Democratic Union and the Vatra Romanesca nationalist movement. 
</P>
<P>
While confrontations in the city's central square continued to flare, the 
Rompres news agency said the Hungarian minority had won a demand for students 
to be educated exclusively in Hungarian. 
</P>
<P>
A statement said Vatra Romanesca accepted that the Hungarians, outnumbered four 
to one by Romanians in Transylvania, did not want to separate the northern 
province from Romania. 
</P>
<P>
It said both sides called for an end to political strikes apparently called 
mainly by Hungarians. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators on Thursday taunted soldiers trying to keep peace between 
Romanian nationalists and ethnic Hungarians. About 1,000 youths approached 
tanks guarding Tirgu Mures' central square, shouting, "Transylvania is 
Romanian" and "We want justice -- no privileges."

DEMOCRATS READY EAST EUROPEAN AID BILL; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS: A PROPOSED ASSISTANCE PACKAGE OF $2 BILLION OVER THREE YEARS IS MUCH 
HIGHER THAN ADMINISTRATION REQUESTS. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a direct challenge to President Bush, key Senate Democrats are drafting a 
three-year, $2-billion aid package for Eastern Europe that is far more than the 
Administration has requested for nations emerging from Soviet domination. 
</P>
<P>
A proposal prepared by Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
would provide the lion's share of the additional funds -- $1.2 billion -- for a 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development now being formed by Western 
European countries. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Poland and Hungary, already targeted in a $738-million aid 
measure enacted last fall, the draft plan would authorize aid for 
Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Romania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. It allows the 
President to decide how the funds should be divided. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Bush has asked only for $300 million in aid for a single year, starting 
Oct. 1, and has deferred a decision on whether to join the European Bank as a 
regular member. Under the Senate Democrats' tentative proposal, however, the 
United States would contribute $400 million to become a bank member and also 
establish a special $800-million trust fund under Washington's control to 
target assistance to Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The draft, which could be voted upon by the committee within the next two 
weeks, reflects Democrats' belief that the President has been too timid in 
extending a helping hand to the emerging nations and in establishing a foothold 
for American business firms in the region. 
</P>
<P>
"As our military presence in Europe is reduced, the United States must greatly 
enhance its economic presence," said Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), 
chairman of a subcommittee on international economics and trade of the Foreign 
Relations panel. "Without presidential leadership, change will certainly occur 
in Europe, markets will be created, new businesses will prosper, but the United 
States could well be left out." 
</P>
<P>
The bank was proposed by France to finance public works and new private firms 
in the former state-run communist economies. The Administration has said it 
will take part in the bank only if it refuses to lend to private or public 
projects in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
In discussing the draft bill, Biden said no funds would be provided directly to 
the Soviet government. But it would allow the President to allocate funds for 
private or government organizations to help promote democratic institutions in 
the Soviet Union, he added. 
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, the President would be able to allocate funds to the 
AFL-CIO for helping to create more effective trade unions for Soviet workers, 
Biden said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a penetration program, not an aid program," he said. "The goal is to 
penetrate the Soviet Union with American values." 
</P>
<P>
Under the Democrats' tentative plan, the President would be authorized to 
appoint a director for American business initiative in the region, with 
ambassadorial rank, to promote U.S. firms' interests. 
</P>
<P>
The draft legislation also would create American business centers in former 
Soviet Bloc countries to help promote U.S. exports and investment. 
</P>
<P>
A committee aide said the panel may include Bush's request for $800 million in 
aid for Nicaragua and Panama in the legislation to step up aid to Eastern 
Europe. The funds for the Central American aid would be deducted from proposed 
defense spending, Bush has said. 
</P>
<P>
While the draft bill does not say where the additional $2 billion for Eastern 
Europe will come from, Democratic sources said it would also be taken out of 
the Pentagon budget request.

FDA EXPANDS L-TRYPTOPHAN RECALL, CITES A MAJOR RISK; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: THE ACTION APPLIES TO EVEN SMALL DOSAGES. NINETEEN PEOPLE HAVE DIED OF 
A BLOOD DISORDER LINKED TO THE DIETARY SUPPLEMENT. 
</P>

<P>
The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday expanded its recall of the dietary 
supplement L-tryptophan to include even small dosages, declaring that the 
substance poses a "major public health problem" and can be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
The agency cited 1,411 reported cases of the newly recognized condition 
eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, or EMS, which has been linked to L-tryptophan. 
Nineteen deaths have been reported. 
</P>
<P>
"EMS can cripple. It can cause great pain. It can kill," Health and Human 
Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan said in a statement. "It has had long-term 
effects on some unfortunate individuals, and some patients are not responding 
to treatment." 
</P>
<P>
EMS is a blood disorder that can cause breathing problems, coughs, skin rashes, 
swelling of the extremities, fever and muscle weakness. Some patients have 
displayed signs of congestive heart failure or have developed a potentially 
fatal condition, ascending polyneuropathy. The condition involves gradual 
progressive weakness, often starting in the legs and moving upward, sometimes 
to the point of complete paralysis. 
</P>
<P>
"I urge everyone to stop taking these supplements immediately," Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
L-tryptophan has been sold over the counter and has been used for insomnia, 
depression, stress reduction, premenstrual syndrome and appetite control. 
</P>
<P>
Until Thursday's action, the Nov. 17 recall was confined to L-tryptophan 
products that would result in a daily intake of 100 milligrams or more of the 
amino acid. This was based on information from the federal Centers for Disease 
Control and state public health agencies that those suffering from EMS had 
taken from 150 to 17,000 milligrams a day. 
</P>
<P>
But the FDA said there is at least one reported instance where an individual's 
intake was believed to be less than 100 milligrams. 
</P>
<P>
The only products with L-tryptophan not subject to recall are some protein 
supplements, infant formulas and special dietary foods, in which minute amounts 
of the substance are needed for nutrient fortification. There have been no 
reported cases of EMS from the use of these products, the FDA said. 
</P>
<P>
The expanded action was taken at the recommendation of the agency's Health 
Hazard Evaluation Board, a panel of scientists within the FDA's center for food 
safety and applied nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
"The risk of contracting EMS due to the consumption of any dietary L-tryptophan 
product far outweighs any perceived benefit . . . in any dosage form," the 
board said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
By mid-November, the CDC had recorded 287 illnesses and four deaths. 
</P>
<P>
The precise relationship between L-tryptophan and the disorder is not clear. 
EMS involves abnormally high levels of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell. 
A normal count is less than 500 cells per cubic millimeter of blood, while 
individuals taking L-tryptophan have experienced levels up to more than 32,000. 
</P>
<P>
J. B. Cordaro, president of the Council for Responsible Nutrition, the trade 
association for the nutritional supplements industry, endorsed the stepped-up 
recall. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe this suggests the FDA must be closer to identifying the nature of 
the problem, which we suspect is a contaminant," he said. "We are hopeful that 
the specific problem is identified in the very near future so that we can 
reintroduce L-tryptophan into the marketplace."

WHITE HOUSE FAULTS BILL TO ELEVATE EPA

The White House, which proposed elevating the Environmental Protection Agency 
to Cabinet level, declared Thursday that it opposes the House bill to bring 
about the change because it contains provisions that "raise serious 
constitutional concerns." 
</P>
<P>
In particular, the Administration said it objects to creating a 
semi-independent Bureau of Environmental Statistics over which the executive 
branch would have limited control. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless these provisions are deleted or modified satisfactorily, the 
President's senior advisers, including the administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency and the attorney general, would recommend that the bill be 
vetoed," the Administration said in a formal "statement of Administration 
policy" sent to Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Under the House bill, the new statistics bureau would be given the power to 
collect data on environmental hazards and would be required to widely publicize 
its findings. 
</P>
<P>
Presidential appointees, including the head of the new environmental 
department, would be forbidden to review the statistical bureau's reports, and 
the head of the bureau would be protected from firing. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration maintains that those provisions would make it impossible for 
the secretary of the environment to run the department. Administration lawyers 
said the bill also infringes on the President's constitutional power to run the 
executive branch of the government. 
</P>
<P>
However, congressional Democrats said that the independent status is needed to 
make sure that environmental information dispensed to the public is credible 
and nonpartisan. During the Ronald Reagan Administration, the Democrats point 
out, political appointees at EPA were accused of hiding information that 
conflicted with White House policy. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a sham and a shame to place another chair around the Cabinet table 
with a law that places a gag on the department's ability to protect the 
environment in an effective and nonpartisan way," House Majority Leader Richard 
A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) said, noting that he "deeply regrets" the Administration 
veto threat. 
</P>
<P>
The threat was made at an unusually early stage in the legislative process. 
Bills to create the new environment department are being considered by 
committees in both the House and Senate and could face months of consideration 
before a final vote is taken. 
</P>
<P>
But Administration officials, who have been widely criticized on environmental 
issues in the last several months, do not want to be put in the position of 
threatening to veto an environmental bill once its passage is imminent. By 
taking a strong stand now, an Administration official said, the White House 
hopes to head off potential problems early.

8-DAY ABORTION FILIBUSTER NEARS END

A tentative agreement was reached Thursday to end the 8-day-old filibuster of 
an bill that would allow virtually unrestricted access to abortions in 
Maryland, the president of the state Senate said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement would place both an abortion rights and an anti-abortion proposal 
before voters this fall, said Senate President Mike Miller. 
</P>
<P>
If the Senate approves the agreement, it would still have to win approval in 
the House of Delegates. 
</P>
<P>
At stake in the battle was a measure that would allow unrestricted access to 
abortions until the point in a pregnancy when a fetus is able to survive 
outside the womb. After fetal viability, abortions could be performed to save 
the life of the mother or to protect her health. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would also require doctors to notify parents when unmarried teen-age 
daughters seek an abortion.

One of Cuba's longest serving prisoners has been released, family members said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
They said Jose Alfredo Mustelier, 46, was freed Wednesday and was at his home 
in Havana. 
</P>
<P>
The Cuban news agency Prensa Latina reported Wednesday that the Supreme Court 
reduced his sentence to 20 from 25 years and noted that he had already served 
20 years. The decision followed a formal appeal by him and his family. 
</P>
<P>
Mustelier was jailed in 1969 for involvement in a murder and robbery. The 
authorities describe him as a "counterrevolutionary." 
</P>
<P>
Human rights groups in Cuba and the United States had campaigned for his 
release.

CIVIL RIGHTS REPORT ALLEGES ALIENS DENIED JOBS BY LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<P>
In an effort to force changes in landmark immigration legislation, a coalition 
of civil rights advocates Thursday charged that provisions of the law have led 
to employers denying jobs to people who look or sound foreign -- even though 
they are entitled to work in this country. 
</P>
<P>
A provision of the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act -- which punishes 
businesses and individuals who knowingly hire illegal immigrants -- has caused 
employers to improperly deny jobs to workers -- immigrants and citizens -- who 
look or sound foreign, the coalition charged. 
</P>
<P>
"This backs up what we feared all along, that employer sanctions have caused a 
great deal of harm," said Anne Kamsvaag, an attorney for the Coalition for 
Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, which issued an 18-page report that 
documents 1,085 cases of alleged workplace discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition is fighting to end the sanctions and plans to use the report to 
lobby Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Fearing they will be fined or jailed for hiring illegal immigrants, employers 
frequently refuse to hire an applicant they think is foreign, the report said. 
Or, employers require the applicant to supply more proof than is legally 
necessary to show he or she is entitled to work in this country. 
</P>
<P>
The employer might also refuse to recognize documents that, in fact, are 
legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
While the charges are not new, the timing of the report -- the latest in a 
string of surveys that describe alleged ethnic discrimination -- was 
significant. Next Thursday, the General Accounting Office is scheduled to 
release its third and final progress report on the provision of the immigration 
law that establishes employer sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
If the GAO report finds "widespread" instances of discrimination as a result of 
the law, Congress must act to review the legislation. In its 1988 report to 
Congress, the federal agency concluded that although 16% of employers have 
discriminated against workers who look or sound foreign, this did not 
constitute widespread discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
With the final report now due, advocacy groups across the country, among them 
the Los Angeles coalition, are stepping up their campaign to have the sanctions 
overturned. 
</P>
<P>
"We are here to tell Congress, 'I told you so,' " Linda Wong, president of 
California Tomorrow, an immigrant advocacy group, said in labeling the 
sanctions provision a failure that has not fulfilled the government's stated 
goal of stemming the tide of illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service said the agency is 
confident the sanctions are working. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, employers too are speaking out against the sanctions, saying the 
complicated law is too costly and confusing. 
</P>
<P>
Josie Gonzalez, a private lawyer who has represented several businesses that 
have been fined by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said employers 
often would rather risk a discrimination complaint than the "wrath" of 
immigration agents. 
</P>
<P>
"They (employers) find this law quite burdensome to comply with," Gonzalez 
said. "They tend to err on the side of not hiring if there are any doubts." 
</P>
<P>
She said she knows of six cases of people who applied for political refugee 
status and were entitled to work, but they were denied jobs because the INS 
form they were given was mistakenly printed with the word "Sample." 
</P>
<P>
Rene Martinez, who came to Los Angeles from El Salvador in 1983, is not 
eligible for amnesty but has applied for political asylum. He carries a letter 
from the INS that says he is entitled to work, but no potential employer 
respects it, he said. "I was better off before, without any permit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The report released Thursday was actually the compilation of several studies 
conducted over a three-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Among the studies was one conducted in Los Angeles which described 
discrimination against Latinos who speak English with an accent. By comparing 
employers' reactions to paired individuals posing as job applicants -- one who 
spoke English with an accent and one without -- the study found that in nearly 
one-third of the cases, the accented speaker was treated less favorably. In one 
out of five cases the accented speakers were not even considered for the job.

"It's embarrassing that I have to introduce a bill," Assemblyman Lloyd Connelly

CHILD-SUPPORT DOCTRINE TO BE REVIEWED; 
</P>
<P>
SUPREME COURT: STATE JUSTICES WILL DECIDE WHETHER A DIVORCED FATHER MUST PAY A 
16-YEAR-OLD JUDGMENT THAT HE WAS NEVER NOTIFIED ABOUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to decide whether a divorced father 
must pay a 16-year-old, $18,200 child-support judgment -- even though he was 
not notified of the award and his former wife never sought it. 
</P>
<P>
The justices said they would review a longstanding judicial doctrine that says 
child support is inherently at issue in divorce cases and can be awarded 
without notice and without being requested. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for a San Francisco man contesting the judgment say the 84-year-old 
doctrine is outdated and that courts can no longer presume divorced mothers 
need child support because they cannot earn as much as men. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers note further that in no other area of the law can judges, in 
uncontested proceedings, make awards in excess of those sought. "There is no 
reason to make an exception and say that litigants (in divorce cases) do not 
have the same due-process rights as other litigants," Berkeley attorney Richard 
I. Sherman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But a city prosecutor defended the doctrine, saying courts need such authority 
to protect the interests of children affected by divorce. The prosecutor also 
rejected the contention that the rule no longer is needed because of the 
increasing opportunities for women to gain income. 
</P>
<P>
"That's fallacious reasoning," San Francisco Assistant Dist. Atty. Lynn P. 
Fitzer said. "Particularly after a divorce, women tend to become much more poor 
than they were before." 
</P>
<P>
The case arose from the 1971 divorce of Ronald and Angela Lippel of San 
Francisco after less than a year of marriage. A petition she filed sought 
custody of their young daughter but asked for neither spousal nor child 
support. As often occurs in such proceedings, Ronald Lippel did not formally 
respond and a default judgment was entered by a San Francisco judge. 
</P>
<P>
According to the father's current suit, the judge, in addition to granting 
custody to the mother, for unknown reasons also entered an order requiring 
Ronald Lippel to pay $100 a month child support. The father received notice 
that "a judgment" had been entered but was not told -- and had no reason to 
suspect -- he was also liable for child support, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
Through the years, Ronald Lippel saw his daughter frequently, paid some of her 
expenses. The mother never raised the subject of child support, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
The support order apparently came to light when the mother applied for welfare. 
San Francisco officials sought then to enforce the order and, after a lengthy 
and unexplained delay, obtained a court order in 1987, taking a share of the 
father's wages. That, according to Lippel, is when he first learned he owed 
$18,200. 
</P>
<P>
Lippel brought suit asking that the child-support and wage orders be set aside. 
But last December, a state Court of Appeal ruled against him, even though it 
conceded that his contentions had "logical appeal." The panel noted that 
child-support judgments -- even when not requested -- had been upheld by the 
courts since 1906. While the wisdom of the rule might be questioned, any change 
in the law should be made by the state Supreme Court, the appeal court said. 
</P>
<P>
In their petition for review to the high court, Lippel's attorneys argued that 
the father had been deprived of fair notice of the child-support order.

SEIZED TAPES MAY BE EXCLUDED IN MENENDEZ MURDER CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Tape recordings believed to be the central piece of evidence in the case 
against Beverly Hills brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez, accused of murdering 
their parents, may be excluded from their trial because of legal proceedings 
initiated by the defendants' psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
Therapist L. Jerome Oziel, who already is on probation with the state 
psychology committee for ethics violations in another case, is contesting the 
constitutionality of the seizure of records from his home and the breach of 
doctor-therapist confidentiality their admission as evidence would create. 
</P>
<P>
"He is obligated (by California law) to submit the issue of confidentiality to 
a Superior Court," his attorney, Bradley Brunon, explained to reporters after a 
90-minute closed-door meeting with Santa Monica Superior Court Judge James 
Albracht, attorneys for the Menendez brothers, and Deputy Dist. Atty. Elliott 
Alhadeff, who will prosecute the case. 
</P>
<P>
Albracht said the situation is so unusual that he was at a loss as to what to 
call the motion, which seeks the records' return. The judge set a hearing on 
the matter for April 4, and ordered that all related documents and motions be 
sealed in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very serious issue," the judge added, because it involves "potential 
prejudice to the defendants and violation of legal rights." 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution contends that the confidentiality usually accorded 
therapist-patient exchanges does not apply "where there is a continuing threat 
of violence to others," in this case alleged threats against Oziel. 
</P>
<P>
The defense argues that such exchanges are protected by law and should neither 
be made public nor used in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, the two brothers reported finding the bodies of their parents, 
entertainment executive Jose Menendez and his wife, Kitty, in their Beverly 
Hills mansion. Both victims had been hit repeatedly with shotgun blasts fired 
at close range. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that the two were slain by their sons for financial gain, an 
estate estimated at $14 million. A $400,000 life insurance policy already has 
been paid to the brothers. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants are to be arraigned Monday in Beverly Hills Municipal Court on 
two counts each of murder with special circumstances that, if they are 
convicted, could send them to the gas chamber. They are being held without 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner has characterized the psychologist's 
tapes as "very important." 
</P>
<P>
However, Alhadeff said the prosecution has other evidence and will go forward 
with or without the tapes, which were seized in a search of Oziel's Sherman 
Oaks home hours before the arrest of Lyle Menendez, 22, earlier this month. His 
19-year-old brother, Erik, was playing in a tennis tournament in Israel, but 
returned to Los Angeles to surrender. 
</P>
<P>
The search was carried out by a "special master" -- an independent attorney 
appointed by the court when a search warrant involves the records of a 
psychotherapist who is not a suspect in a crime. 
</P>
<P>
Under the procedure, the special master is to seize and seal such records, then 
take them to court. 
</P>
<P>
However, in the Menendez case, the police reviewed the materials before they 
were turned over to the special master, according to a law enforcement source. 
The defense contends such a review violates their clients' right to a fair 
trial.

RICHARD PRYOR SUFFERS A MINOR HEART ATTACK IN AUSTRALIA

Comedian Richard Pryor was in stable condition today in a Brisbane hospital 
after suffering a minor heart attack three days ago, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Pryor was admitted Tuesday to Wesley Hospital after complaining of chest pains, 
according to hospital spokeswoman Janice Wyatte. 
</P>
<P>
She said doctors diagnosed a "minor heart attack" after conducting tests on the 
49-year-old entertainer. She said Pryor has been in "very stable condition" 
since his admission, and has suffered no complications. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital doctors expect to release Pryor by early next week, Wyatte said. She 
said he was visiting Brisbane, 600 miles north of here, on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
Pryor recovered from an earlier heart attack while visiting his grandmother in 
Peoria, Ill., in late 1977. In the past, the stand-up comic-actor has suffered 
from addictions to drugs and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1980, he nearly died after he caught fire while free-basing cocaine.

STUDENT RECORDS FOUND IN DISARRAY AT 3 HIGH SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state investigation of student records at three Inglewood high schools has 
uncovered serious record-keeping problems that apparently allowed some students 
to graduate even though their transcripts showed they had not completed 
required course work. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the study found numerous discrepancies between grades on teachers' 
logs and those recorded in the transcripts. 
</P>
<P>
The most significant problem uncovered in the review by the state Department of 
Education occurred at Morningside High School, where records indicate that four 
of 16 randomly selected seniors who graduated last June had not completed all 
the graduation requirements. 
</P>
<P>
One graduate's records showed the student had completed only half of the 20 
required science credits. Another was missing five credits of mathematics. 
Investigators said they do not know whether the records are incorrect or the 
students graduated without completing required work. 
</P>
<P>
"This is pretty serious," said James Smith, deputy superintendent for 
curriculum and instructional leadership in the state Department of Education. 
"Everybody who sees a diploma relies on the integrity of the process. It's not 
at all trivial. It's one of the more egregious errors a school can make." 
</P>
<P>
The investigation, requested by Supt. George McKenna last September, is a 
follow-up to an internal audit conducted by the district last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he forwarded a copy of the report, dated March 9, to McKenna earlier 
this month. McKenna could not be reached for comment but district spokesman 
Maurice Wiley confirmed that the report had been received. 
</P>
<P>
The state made a copy of the report available to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
At both Morningside and Inglewood high schools, the review team also found 
discrepancies between the grades recorded in teacher log books and those on the 
final student transcripts. At Hillcrest Continuation High School, where the 
investigators found the fewest problems, there were no grade discrepancies. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said in the report that all the irregularities appeared to be 
inadvertent and were probably the result of carelessness by a combination of 
administrators, teachers, counselors and record clerks. 
</P>
<P>
The review team recommended that teachers in the Inglewood Unified School 
District exercise more care in recording grades and that the schools improve 
their filing systems. To ensure confidentiality, the team said, the schools 
should stop leaving transcripts in cardboard boxes on counselors' desks during 
the day. The investigators also said the district should strengthen its system 
for determining if a student qualifies for graduation. 
</P>
<P>
"To grant a diploma to a student who failed to meet these requirements degrades 
the value of the diploma for those students who have met all the criteria," the 
investigators said.

School board members and principals at the three high schools reacted with 
surprise when informed Thursday of the report's results. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Larry Aubry said there will be "definite responses to this 
situation," which he characterized as serious. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm horrified," board member Zyra McCloud said. "The school district is in a 
state of emergency. The ship is sinking." 
</P>
<P>
Board Vice President Joseph Rouzan said he had not seen the report. "I'm 
shocked to hear the superintendent has not notified us of it. What can I say 
except 'Wow!' " 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood High School Principal Lawrence Freeman angrily disputed the report's 
results.

WALL OF NAMES HONORS FALLEN IN EL SALVADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Inspired by the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington, a wall of 10,000 names was 
unveiled Thursday in Exposition Park as a tribute to the men, women and 
children who lost their lives in El Salvador's ongoing civil war. 
</P>
<P>
For one Salvadoran immigrant, the wall offered a chance to remember the deep 
personal tragedy he suffered on a November day six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Vietnam Memorial, which has names of U.S. casualties chiseled into 
black marble, the Salvadoran memorial consists of names painted on wooden 
panels. With a thin brush and a bottle of black paint, 38-year-old Jose Casco 
of Los Angeles painted in the name of his wife, Candida, who was killed, he 
said, by Salvadoran army troops in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Beneath Candida's name, he painted the names of their four children -- Maria 
Yanira, Santos Inocente, Maira and Jose Salvador -- who also were killed that 
day. The names of his brother, sister and five nieces and nephews followed. In 
all, Jose Casco painted 12 names on the panels that make up the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Casco said the killings took place when soldiers surrounded his village near 
the Guazapa Volcano, a leftist guerrilla stronghold in Northern El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
"I am the survivor of a holocaust," Casco said in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of U.S. policy in El Salvador, Salvadoran immigrants, along with a 
group of Vietnam veterans, constructed the wall this month with the support of 
Los Angeles City Councilman Robert Farrell. 
</P>
<P>
The wall will remain on a lawn next to the Museum of Natural History until 
September. The groups that built the wall said they hope to establish it as a 
permanent memorial at a still undetermined site in the Pico-Union district, the 
heart of Southern California's 350,000-strong Salvadoran community. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Kandel of El Rescate, a support agency for Central American immigrants, 
said the wall also has a political motive -- to stop U.S. military aid to the 
government of Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani and to push for a 
negotiated settlement of the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
The long list of names chronicles many of the violent episodes in El Salvador's 
recent history. Poets, university students, trade unionists and human rights 
activists make up the list of the dead or "disappeared," including Herbert 
Anaya, the president of the Salvadoran Human Rights Commission. Anaya was shot 
to death in a San Salvador parking lot in October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the names were of peasants who suffered the brunt of the rural 
guerrilla war. One entry read only: "Familia Nieto, 3 muertos." (Nieto family, 
three dead.) 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the names were of Salvadorans, however. Also included were three 
American nuns and a church lay worker who were raped and shot to death in 
December, 1980. The killings of the nuns, along with the assassination of 
Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero a few months earlier, created an international 
outcry. 
</P>
<P>
Among those present at Thursday's unveiling were Ross Yosnow, 42, a former 
platoon sergeant in Vietnam and now a member of Veterans for Peace, a group 
opposed to U.S. policy in Central America. Yosnow compared the wall to the 
Vietnam Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
"If the U.S. government had learned their lessons from Vietnam, there wouldn't 
be any need for us to be here today dedicating a wall to El Salvador," Yosnow 
said. "Much like the names on the Vietnam Memorial, we need to ensure that 
these people haven't died in vain." 
</P>
<P>
Joaquin, a 33-year-old Salvadoran immigrant, spent a few minutes circling the 
wall, looking for the name of a cousin, Humberto Rodezno. He had painted the 
name several days earlier but couldn't find it among the thousands of names. 
</P>
<P>
"We spent our childhood together. He wasn't just a cousin, he was like a 
brother to me," said Joaquin, who asked that his last name not be published.

MOTHER HAD LONG TALKED OF SUICIDE; 
</P>
<P>
TRAGEDY: RESEDA WOMAN WHO KILLED HER THREE CHILDREN AND HERSELF HAD CLOAKED HER 
REMARKS IN RELIGIOUS REFERENCES. APPARENTLY NO ONE TOOK HER SERIOUSLY.

<P>
Roxanne Jones, the Reseda woman who shot her three children to death as they 
slept and then turned the gun on herself, talked of killing herself and taking 
her children with her for as long as two months before carrying out the threat, 
police and acquaintances said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
None of those who heard her discuss suicide took her seriously enough to 
contact authorities or to steer her toward counseling. Some hints that she was 
suicidal went unrecognized, apparently misinterpreted as part of her fervent 
new religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks before the murder-suicide, Jones' 7-year-old son Jeremiah told his 
first-grade teacher that his mother was taking him to "a good place, where God 
is, and there are no worries." But the teacher took that to mean a religious 
retreat. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of Jones, 32, daughters Brandy Fernandez, 15, and Leticia Fernandez, 
13, and Jeremiah were found Wednesday afternoon in the family's small house on 
Tampa Avenue in Reseda. Los Angeles police said Jones had shot the children 
while they slept Tuesday morning, then turned the .22-caliber rifle on herself. 
The family dog was shot to death in the house as well. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, who separated four months ago from her husband, Jeff Jones, 31, left 
behind a five-page suicide note in which she asked for God's forgiveness and 
outlined the family and financial problems that burdened her, police said. They 
said that Jones had previously told several friends and relatives that she was 
contemplating suicide. 
</P>
<P>
"She would mention possibly killing herself and she said if she ever did she 
would take the children with her," Detective Rick Swanston said. "It wasn't 
taken seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Jones said in an interview Thursday that he had not picked up any hint 
from his wife that she was suicidal, nor did he ever hear his son talk 
obliquely or directly about it. "If he would have, I would have known right 
away," Jones said. "I cannot explain this at all." 
</P>
<P>
He said his wife was consumed by a desire to be "someplace better" and turned 
to religion for solace and guidance. "She was into nature and wanted to go to 
God, where the trees and grass were nice," Jones said. "I hope she's there." 
</P>
<P>
Jones said he and his wife of nine years 
</P>
<P>
met in the San Fernando Valley. "(She) had proposed to me and I accepted 
because I loved her." 
</P>
<P>
Though separated, Jones visited the family often. He said their problems were 
"nothing major" and that the couple had attempted to reconcile. He last saw 
Roxanne on Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"She seemed OK," he said. She told him she was leaving the state for "a couple 
months" and wanted Jones to "hug her and hold her. She said goodby and that was 
the last I saw her." 
</P>
<P>
Jones said his wife was religious but "didn't quite interpret the Bible the way 
it should have been. She comprehends things her way and no way else. Whatever 
she thinks is right is right." 
</P>
<P>
Last week Roxanne Jones went to the Convenant Faith Center in Northridge, a 
church that practices faith-healing and which she had attended a decade 
earlier, before her marriage. She sought counseling from the pastor, but he was 
not unduly alarmed at her situation, according to a church secretary who asked 
to remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks before the deaths, Jones apparently told her son that the family 
would soon be going to the "House of David," which Jeremiah then described to 
his first-grade teacher, Madeleine Bellomo, at Blythe Street Elementary School. 
He said it was a "peaceful place," and suggested that "maybe you should go 
there, too," Bellomo recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Bellomo said she interpreted his comments as meaning the family was going to 
"physically leave the scene" and move somewhere else. The child, who was often 
late to school and rarely completed his homework, did not seem concerned or 
troubled about the impending move, so she did not feel the need to report his 
comments to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the boy mentioned that he had started attending church and Bible 
study sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Jeremiah's last day of school was Monday. He was late, and Jones had given him 
a note that "was rambling and reflected a sense of struggling and turmoil," 
Bellomo said. 
</P>
<P>
School officials said they were aware of Jones' struggle to provide financially 
for her children. 
</P>
<P>
"She was quite open" about her money troubles, Principal Maureen Banks said. 
"She was having problems making ends meet." 
</P>
<P>
When Bellomo spoke recently with her, Jones said she was trying to "keep them 
from losing the house, and to keep the children off the street." Banks said 
that two weeks ago the mother asked for a job as a playground supervisor, but 
the position had already been filled. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Jones, a house painter, said he gave money to his family as often as he 
could. And the Los Angeles County district attorney's office said that her 
first husband, Joaquin Fernandez of San Fernando, had made child-support 
payments totaling $600 already this year -- more than called for under their 
1979 divorce agreement. 
</P>
<P>
As an unemployed single mother, Jones received welfare payments from the 
county, but those records are confidential, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Several friends and neighbors said Jones had turned increasingly to religion 
since her separation and the onset of financial problems. Though police said 
she spoke specifically about suicide to some acquaintances, other friends only 
now recognize the hints of desperation in her religious expressions. 
</P>
<P>
"She got pretty heavy into God," said Crystal Erickson, a 15-year-old friend of 
the family who found the bodies. "She would start reading Scripture to everyone 
when we were . . . around." 
</P>
<P>
Doreena Pacheco, another family friend, said Jones often said that if "she died 
and went to heaven, she would take the children with her. . . . She wanted to 
go to heaven so bad, and she wanted the kids to be with her." 
</P>
<P>
Jones often talked of going to a "better place," friends said. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think she meant this," said Pacheco. "I thought she was moving." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, police said, it is not unusual for suicidal hints to go 
unrecognized or outright threats not be taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"Among the lay public a threat of suicide is not often taken seriously because 
they don't want to believe it," said Martin Reiser, chief psychologist for the 
Los Angeles Police Department. "They want to believe it is just a feeling of 
the moment, something that will pass with time." 
</P>
<P>
But one friend told detectives she had severed ties with Jones because she felt 
Jones might harm someone.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TEACHERS GROUP LOSES BID TO STOP BILINGUAL 
BONUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of United Teachers-Los Angeles, the union representing 33,000 teachers 
and other school professionals, defeated a measure that would require bilingual 
teachers to turn down $5,000-a-year bonuses from the school district, union 
President Wayne Johnson said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
An initiative by Learning English Advocates Drive, a statewide group started by 
Los Angeles teachers opposed to the district's bilingual education program, was 
defeated by a 2-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
The group had sought to block the bonuses, arguing they are unfair to teachers 
who speak only English. 
</P>
<P>
The bonuses are part of the teachers' contract signed last June. District 
officials say the bonuses will attract more bilingual teachers to classrooms in 
the 610,000-student district, which has 180,000 students who are learning 
English. 
</P>
<P>
LEAD founder Sally Peterson said she will continue to fight the district's 
bilingual teaching method by lobbying state legislators.

2 TO SERVE SHORT STINTS AS MAYOR

<P>
The Moorpark City Council has settled a four-month squabble over the ceremonial 
title of mayor by agreeing that two council members will take turns in the post 
until the November elections. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Paul Lawrason will continue as mayor until mid-May, when Councilman 
Bernardo Perez takes over, council members decided on a 4-1 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Perez will be the city's ninth mayor. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, Moorpark voters will select a mayor in November. The mayor 
had been selected by the City Council since incorporation in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Eloise Brown opposed the move, saying that Perez had indicated in 
November that he did not want to accept a short-term position. 
</P>
<P>
The decision settles a dispute that broke out at a council meeting Nov. 15 when 
Councilman Scott Montgomery suggested that three people who had not served as 
mayor share the post. Until that point, Lawrason, Montgomery and Perez had not 
served as mayor. At that time, Perez and Councilman Clint Harper opposed the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
However, Montgomery on Wednesday said he decided to give up his ambitions to 
the post to resolve what has become a sometimes comic debate referred to as 
"musical mayors." 
</P>
<P>
The position of mayor carries no benefits other than presiding over council 
meetings and representing the city at official functions. PSYCHE PASCUAL

Doctors were able to save the baby of a pregnant woman who was shot and killed 
by a neighbor as she strolled with a toddler near her Lynwood home, police and

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SANTA PAULA; 
</P>
<P>
DEAL OFFERED ON NEW JAIL, ROADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most property owners near a proposed site for a new county jail in Santa Paula 
would not oppose the facility if the county agreed to share the cost of 
improving area roads, a representative for the owners said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Bob Cole, said he represented a majority of about 20 property 
owners in a 160-acre industrial area off Todd Road near Briggs Road, southwest 
of Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
Cole said that the area is serviced by private two-lane roads with high 
commercial traffic and that property owners would be willing to cooperate with 
the county in paying for road improvements if a jail is constructed at the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
"There are certain improvements we would like put in our area, and we thought 
it would be nice if we could share those with the county," said Cole, director 
of the Santa Clara Waste Water Co. 
</P>
<P>
Cole testified on behalf of the property owners at a county environmental 
hearing on the proposed site earlier this week. Cole cited other advantages to 
a jail at the Briggs Road site, including 10-minute access to the Santa Paula 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The site of a new county jail has been controversial. A county environmental 
report recommended using donated parkland east of Santa Paula for the jail. 
Other proposed sites include Pancho Road south of Camarillo, Potrero Road 
farther south and Hueneme Road east of Port Hueneme.

BREAKING TRADITION; 
</P>
<P>
RENEGADE SWALLOWS PASS UP CAPISTRANO FOR A MALIBU ESTATE CALLED HEAVEN'S GATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As tradition would have it, thousands of swallows forsake the Argentine winter 
each year and fly north to nest at the legendary Mission San Juan Capistrano, 
founded two centuries ago by Father Junipero Serra. 
</P>
<P>
There is a song about it. A weeklong festival. And tourists. Busloads of them. 
</P>
<P>
But for two years now, a renegade flock of swallows -- normally sticklers for 
tradition, ornithologists say -- have piloted right past San Juan Capistrano, 
stretching their 6,000-mile flight to Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
The swallow pioneers have chosen to spend their time north at Steve and Pam 
Malin's $3-million French chateau perched high above the Pacific Ocean on a 
pothole-marked private road outside the Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 of them bedded down last year in bottle-shaped nests tucked 
neatly beneath the home's many eaves. And this week -- Swallow Week in San Juan 
Capistrano -- the birds began returning to Malibu to reclaim the weather-worn 
edifices. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought it was a one-year fluke," said Pam Malin, who says she likes the 
nests because they give her home a distinctive European ambience. "Then one of 
them showed up again. Then a few more. It seems strange they would pick our 
house out of all the houses in Malibu." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. The Malins' home looks more like something out of a Grimm brothers' 
fairy tale than out of a history text on California's Franciscan past. 
</P>
<P>
It boasts large French windows, cherubs, a cobblestone driveway and a quaint 
guest house atop the garage. It also has a few contemporary touches, including 
a wrought-iron security fence and a pair of Rotweiler patrol dogs. 
</P>
<P>
Its only apparent link to Mission San Juan Capistrano, 75 miles to the south, 
is the estate's ethereal designation at the front entrance: Heaven's Gate. 
</P>
<P>
"You can call this the mission of Malibu," Pam Malin said. "I could say there 
is a lot of energy that develops here." 
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the wayward flock of swallows in Malibu hasn't exactly 
engendered feelings of inadequacy in San Juan Capistrano, which has its share 
of million-dollar homes, plenty of other swallows and a visitor center official 
who actually left Malibu for the south Orange County city. 
</P>
<P>
"There are enough birds to go around," said Nick Magalousis, director of the 
San Juan Capistrano Mission Museum, which features a special exhibit on 
swallows. 
</P>
<P>
Mission officials insist it would take much more than one nest-infested Malibu 
chateau to undo a tradition first recorded by missionaries in San Juan 
Capistrano in 1777. 
</P>
<P>
"They started coming here long before Malibu," said spokeswoman Sudele Cooper. 
"We have our guarantees." 
</P>
<P>
At the mission's visitor center, Malibu-transplant Brian McInernary said the 
news from his hometown isn't all that surprising. Several years ago, he said, 
there were reports from Pepperdine University -- several miles down Pacific 
Coast Highway from Heaven's Gate -- about swallows arriving there. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, McInernary said, the swallow population has exploded 
because farmers in South America, facing international pressure, have stopped 
using heavy doses of pesticides that were killing the birds. The swallows have 
already invaded much of south Orange County, building nests several years ago, 
for instance, in the May Co. store in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
"Just as Father Serra was a missionary, converting those he met, so too are the 
swallows," said McInernary, the center's communication director. "They are 
expanding to greater areas and spreading the word of Capistrano." 
</P>
<P>
But at least one bird expert expressed surprise at the swallows' new perch. 
</P>
<P>
"Malibu?" queried Mayme Carver, secretary of the South Coast Audubon Society 
and a proud San Juan Capistrano resident. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, they found it more appealing there. More high class," she said. "We 
have busloads of Japanese tourists looking for the swallows. If they only 
knew." 
</P>
<P>
But Carver warned that the birds spread more than the goodwill of Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
"Every spring, my husband tells me he doesn't like the swallows because the 
droppings have a habit of splattering on the bedroom window," Carver said. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly, Pam Malin said, pointing to her upstairs bedroom window. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of our friends say that we should take a blowtorch and take the nests 
off," said Steve Malin, a helicopter pilot. "But the groundskeeper takes care 
of it. We like seeing life fluttering all over. When we paint the place, we are 
going to paint right around their little houses." 
</P>
<P>
Several swallow watchers said Malibu provides an ideal alternative to San Juan 
Capistrano because it is relatively undeveloped and has the gnats, mosquitoes 
and water bugs the birds enjoy. What Malibu will never have, though, Carver 
said, is the "rich and famous" tradition of San Juan Capistrano captured in 
Leon Rene's 1939 song, "When the Swallows Come Back to Capistrano."

MONEY FOR HARBOR PLAN EXPECTED IN '90 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal funding for a $6.5-million project to improve the safety of Ventura 
Harbor's ocean entrance, called the most dangerous in Southern California, 
could begin this year, a harbor official said. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe we will be included in the 1990 budget," said Ventura Port District 
General Manager Richard W. Parsons at a meeting Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The harbor's entrance has been plagued, since its 1963 opening, with sand 
deposits that sometimes create breaking waves for incoming vessels or imprison 
them in the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, the Port supervises a dredging operation to keep the entrance open, 
this year digging out 200,000 cubic yards of sand at a cost of about $400,000. 
On average, 640,000 cubic yards have been dredged a year over the past 17 
years, with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers paying for most of the work. 
</P>
<P>
Parsons said lobbying in Washington, D.C., by a delegation last month yielded 
tentative approval of $750,000 in funding for engineering designs and test 
models on entrance improvements, the first concrete step toward actual work on 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes well and there are no delays in funding, Parsons said, work could 
begin in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The project, an outgrowth of an extensive Corps of Engineers study, will deepen 
the sea entrance to Ventura Harbor from about 20 feet to about 40 feet. 
</P>
<P>
It also will extend the offshore breakwater and the north jetty, plus add a 
650-foot sea wall to the beach about 1,000 feet south of the harbor's south 
jetty. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Ventura Port Commissioner Richard S. Hambleton called the entrance 
"the most dangerous in Southern California" at a meeting of the House 
Subcommittee on Water Resources. The subcommittee voted in favor of the 
project, virtually assuring full committee authorization, Parsons said. JUDITH

GIRL FOUND IN FLOOD CHANNEL WAS VICTIM OF STRANGULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 16-year-old Cypress girl whose body was found near a flood control channel in 
Lakewood died by strangulation, according to preliminary autopsy results 
released Thursday by the Los Angeles County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
The fully clothed body of Zuleima Valdez, a freshman at Cypress High School, 
was found about 5:45 p.m. Monday by two teen-agers riding bicycles near the 
Coyote Creek flood control channel, not far from the mobile home the victim 
shared with her mother. 
</P>
<P>
"The cause of death has been established as strangulation, and it is a 
homicide," Bob Dambacher, a spokesman for the coroner's office, said. 
</P>
<P>
Dambacher said he could not comment on the time of death or if any type of 
implement was used in the strangulation. He said routine toxicological tests 
will be conducted to determine if Valdez was given any substances, such as 
drugs, before she was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Results of Thursday's autopsy will be turned over to the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department crime lab. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Department detectives previously had said the body, which showed no 
obvious signs of trauma, was partially covered with pine needles, leading them 
to suspect someone may have tried to hide it. 
</P>
<P>
Valdez left home Sunday night, telling her mother she was going to the beach 
with friends. When she failed to return, the mother reported her missing to 
police.

COUNTY PROBES FIRE DEPT. TEST CHEATING CLAIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reports that some would-be firefighters have breached the security of an 
aptitude test for the Los Angeles County Fire Department by studying the actual 
examination in advance are being investigated by the county's Internal Services 
Department, authorities confirmed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Internal Services Chief Deputy Director Bill Allen said he has ordered the 
department's testing unit, which prepares and gives the exam, to find out 
whether copies of a qualifying examination may have been used to tutor 
potential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
If it is found that people have cheated, Allen said, his department will 
attempt to determine how the actual test got out and who is responsible. Then, 
he said, he will meet with county fire officials to determine what should be 
done. 
</P>
<P>
The entry-level exam, aimed basically at testing mechanical aptitude, has been 
administered recently to 4,000 to 5,000 people who hope to be included on a 
Fire Department hiring list. The potential candidates also face oral 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
County Fire Chief Mike Freeman said he was informed late Wednesday that a 
number of test takers may have seen the examination in advance. Because his 
department does not prepare or give the exam, Freeman said he asked county 
officials to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be inappropriate to do anything until the allegations are 
substantiated," Freeman said. "I think the important thing right now is that 
I'm taking decisive and appropriate action." 
</P>
<P>
If it is determined that there has been a breach of security and members of the 
Fire Department are involved, Freeman said he will order an investigation and 
contact appropriate law enforcement agencies.

GAS TANKER CATCHES FIRE DURING REFUELING AT CANOGA PARK STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A tanker truck caught fire as it was refueling underground storage tanks 
Thursday at a Canoga Park gas station, closing Topanga Canyon Boulevard for 
about an hour. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
The fire occurred shortly before noon at a Thrifty Oil Co. station at Topanga 
Canyon Boulevard and Bassett Street. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Fire Department officials attributed the fire to gas overflowing 
from one of the station's underground tanks. The gasoline formed a pool along 
the south curb of Bassett Street and was ignited when a young woman parked her 
car there and turned off the engine, Battalion Chief John Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, Cecilia Berberian, 19, of Canoga Park, was lucky to escape from the 
car unhurt, Adams said. That car and two others were destroyed. Five other cars 
were damaged, one severely. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as I turned off the key, the car, it blew up," Berberian said. 
</P>
<P>
Several windows in a two-story commercial building on the north side of Bassett 
Street were cracked from the heat, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters extinguished the blaze in about 15 minutes, Adams said. The fire 
gutted the rear of the tanker truck. A residential area to the west and Canoga 
Park High School to the east were not evacuated because there was no danger of 
a large explosion, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic in the Canoga Park area was slowed for about an hour as authorities 
closed Topanga Canyon Boulevard in both directions.

RADIOACTIVE GAUGE MISSING FROM PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A radioactive gauge is missing from a cement manufacturing plant near Gorman 
that is already under fire from environmentalists because it burns hazardous 
waste, and a two-week search has failed to find any trace of the gauge, company 
and state officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The National Cement Co. plant in Lebec is being investigated by state health 
officials, who said they expect to cite the company for mishandling the device. 
</P>
<P>
State and federal officials said the amount of radioactive material contained 
in the device so small that it does not pose a public health hazard. 
</P>
<P>
The radioactive material was sealed inside a container that would prevent 
harmful exposure. And even if the material were somehow released, the level of 
radiation would not be strong enough to harm anyone nearby, said Greg Cook, a 
spokesman for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The missing gauge is just the latest in a series of problems for the cement 
plant, the only one in California permitted to burn hazardous wastes as fuel. 
Earlier this month, state health officials fined its operators $350,000 for 
burning too much waste in 1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest incident, plant workers and a state health inspector dug up areas 
of the nearby Lebec Landfill in Kern County on Monday thinking the gauge might 
have been accidentally thrown out, said Donald Bunn, an official with the state 
Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
Bunn, who is in charge of compliance for the state's radiologic health office, 
said the company will be cited for this incident and could face sanctions on 
its operating license or other legal action. 
</P>
<P>
The company reported the device missing on March 9. Plant Manager Byron 
McMichael said it had been removed from one building sometime earlier and was 
taken to a shop on the plant site to await reinstallation elsewhere. "We went 
to install it and we couldn't find it," McMichael said. 
</P>
<P>
Bunn said he believed the company was not authorized to remove the device and 
should not have left it in a shop. The company and a state health inspector 
searched the plant without success. Although the search has been suspended, the 
company is still questioning its employees about what might have become of the 
device, McMichael said. 
</P>
<P>
The device is described as a lead pipe about a foot long, containing 20 
millicuries of the radioactive material cesium-137. It was one of 19 sensors 
used at the plant that contains varying amounts of radioactive material. Such 
sensors are fairly common in industrial manufacturing uses, state officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the shielding removed, the NRC's Cook estimated that a person would 
have to be closely exposed to the material for more than 83 hours to exceed the 
NRC's established annual exposure threshold for an individual. 
</P>
<P>
However, state and federal officials also said their policy is to keep 
radioactive material out of the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, a Gardena business that unknowingly melted what state officials believe 
may have been a similar device had to be temporarily closed and decontaminated 
last spring, Bunn said. 
</P>
<P>
The news that the plant had radioactive materials on site came as a surprise to 
local environmentalists. They said the loss of the gauge illustrates the 
unreliability of the plant's operations. 
</P>
<P>
"It just goes to show they can't be trusted with what they're doing," said 
Helen Thornburg, who is a leader of a local environmental group that has 
repeatedly protested that the burning of hazardous wastes endangers the health 
of area residents.

JAPAN'S INVESTMENT IN U.K. SOARING; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: THE JAPANESE SHIFT TO EUROPE IS IN PREPARATION FOR A UNIFIED 
MARKET IN '92. BUT THE U.S. IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN THE NO. 1 INVESTMENT TARGET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA WATANABE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japanese investment has more than quadrupled in United Kingdom real estate in 
the past two years and is also accelerating in other European nations as 
investors seek to position themselves for the community's unified market in 
1992, a new report shows. 
</P>
<P>
In the first comprehensive survey of Japanese investment in Europe, the report 
by the accounting group Clark Kenneth Leventhal found that major institutional 
investors, such as life insurance companies, are turning away from the United 
States and leading the way into Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Europe offers not only a single market with a gross national product rivaling 
America's but also potentially higher rates of return, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
"We were extremely surprised by the acceleration in investment," said Nicholas 
E. Young, executive director of Clark Kenneth Leventhal, an association of 
independent accounting firms whose members include Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. 
of Los Angeles. "I would think it would have to be seen as a rather dramatic 
competition to the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
But Jack Rodman, managing partner of the Los Angeles office of Kenneth 
Leventhal &amp; Co., said an informal survey conducted in Tokyo this week 
suggests that any retreat by Japanese institutional investors from the U.S. 
market would be more than made up by a "staggering" increase in smaller 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
The study estimated that cumulative Japanese investment in European real estate 
reached $6.4 billion last year, which represents just 12% of the investment in 
the United States. Overall direct investment by the Japanese in Europe was 
$27.9 billion, or 40% of the U.S. total. 
</P>
<P>
But in the past few years, investment has spiraled rapidly. In the United 
Kingdom, which has drawn 61% of the investment in Europe, the cumulative totals 
grew to $4.6 billion in 1989 from $2 billion in 1988 and $1.1 billion in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In a pattern similar to their early U.S. investment, the Japanese have 
characteristically purchased "trophy" office buildings in prime London areas 
through joint ventures with local partners. The study found that office 
buildings accounted for 87% of the investment and that 90% was in London. 
Purchases include the old Daily Express building on Fleet Street, Paternoster 
Square, County Hall, the Post Office site at St. Martin-le-Grand and the River 
Plate House in Finsbury Circus. 
</P>
<P>
In France, two major deals have driven a surge in investment to $1 billion in 
1989 from $260 million in 1988. Kowa Real Estate Investment has purchased the 
Shell Oil headquarters near the Champs Elysees in a joint venture and agreed to 
buy two office buildings over the railway line at Montparnasse. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the investment has focused on office buildings, recent 
Japanese acquisitions have also included a 33% share in one of Paris' largest 
shopping malls and the $41.5-million purchase of the Grande Hotel du Cap Ferrat 
in the South of France. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese interest in Spain has centered on hotels and resorts. Notable 
acquisitions include the Ritz Hotel in Barcelona for a reported $80 million and 
the Villa Magna Hotel in Madrid for about $78 million. Those two deals 
accounted for the bulk of the total $182 million investment in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
But the study forecast growing interest in Barcelona because of the 1992 
Olympics; in Seville, which is hosting the World Exposition, and in the Costa 
del Sol, because of the area's warm climate, golf resorts and retirement 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
Investment in West Germany accounted for only $66 million in 1989, but Young 
said several Japanese banks were seeking to locate in Frankfurt as a 
springboard into Eastern Europe. The United Kingdom experience suggests that 
the presence of Japanese banks is closely tied to accelerated investment: Their 
loans on U.K. property leaped to $6.9 billion in November, 1989, from $99 
million in early 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Rodman and Young said Japanese investors have so far preferred the United 
Kingdom over other European nations for several reasons: less red tape over 
foreign investment, use of the English language and the London financial 
market. 
</P>
<P>
But they disagreed on whether Japanese investment in Europe would ever reach 
the level of investment in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel so much of Europe is untapped by the Japanese," Young said. "The 
potential of the single European market must be great and extremely promising. 
And the Japanese feel comfortable there in the same way they feel comfortable 
in the United States. I think they're genuinely liked." 
</P>
<P>
Rodman said some Japanese institutional investors may be turning away from the 
United States because they are generally disappointed by the rates of return on 
their properties. Many targeted returns of 6% to 9% but have actually realized 
average returns of 3%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, rents have been declining in Los Angeles and office space is 
overbuilt in major cities. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the office vacancy rate in London is near zero. The United Kingdom 
also offers "institutional leases," which provide income security without as 
much risk of vacancies. Such leases are typically 25 years long and usually 
have five-year reviews of rents, which may only increase. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Rodman said the United States would continue to attract two-thirds of 
overseas Japanese investment, much of it fueled by a second wave of smaller 
investors who are following the bigger players and reselling their shares to 
others in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"The increase in small investors is just staggering," he said. "Most of their 
clients want to be in the U.S. So many Japanese have invested there. It's 
harder to enter the European market; there's less property, and you can't 
acquire it as readily as in the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
Makio Nishikawa, Los Angeles manager of the real estate finance group for 
Yasuda Trust &amp; Banking Co., agreed that the United States would remain the 
top investment choice for most Japanese. He said investors are moving into 
Europe because of the integrated market, a desire to diversify portfolios 
deemed too heavily skewed toward U.S. assets and a reaction against growing 
criticism of Japanese investment in America. But Europe will not replace 
America, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are still believing in the power of the currency, namely the power of the 
U.S. dollar," Nishikawa said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodman predicted that Japanese investment figures would increase again next 
year after dropping for the first time in 1989. After meeting with about 30 
clients in Tokyo this week, Rodman said the United States could expect 15 to 20 
major office developments, continued investment in residential property, golf 
courses, retail shopping centers and retirement communities.

UAL WILL DISCUSS UNION BUYOUT BUT CALLS OFFER TOO LOW 
</P>

UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines, announced Thursday that it would 
negotiate with the unions and the investment company that are conducting a 
proxy fight for control of the corporation but said their recent offer was not 
high enough. 
</P>
<P>
UAL's pilots, machinists and flight attendants unions, along with the New York 
investment firm of Coniston Partners, on Monday offered about $4.1 billion for 
the company. After an all-day meeting here Thursday, the UAL board of directors 
said, "There is a disparity between the value of the proposal and the otherwise 
realizable value of the company." 
</P>
<P>
The board reiterated that the company and its parts are for sale and directed 
its financial advisers "actively to develop a plan for asset dispositions, to 
consider any proposals for the purchase of the entire company by other parties 
and to address all other alternatives for realizing greater and fair value for 
the shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
If the proxy fight mounted by Coniston and the three unions succeeds, it would 
probably mean the ouster of UAL's chairman, Stephen M. Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
The United board said the unions and Condor Partners, the entity owned by 
Coniston which is waging the proxy fight, had asked Wednesday for negotiations 
in an attempt to reach agreement before the campaign for proxies begins. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite serious deficiencies which the board believes exists in the buyout 
proposal, including its value and financeability," the directors said in their 
statement, "the board has instructed its advisers to enter into the requested 
negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
Coniston said Monday that it and the unions had not arranged financing for the 
proposed deal, saying they would await the outcome of the fight for control of 
the board at UAL's annual meeting, which is scheduled for April 26. 
</P>
<P>
The buyout offer would give shareholders $150 a share in cash, $25 a share in 
10-year notes bearing 15% interest, and non-voting common stock constituting 
25% of the new company's total common equity. The remaining 75% would be held 
by an employee stock ownership plan. 
</P>
<P>
Paul E. Tierney Jr., a partner in Coniston, said in a telephone interview after 
the UAL board's announcement Thursday, "I think it is smart to meet. I hope the 
negotiations are fruitful. It is better to do this in a friendly fashion. Our 
slate (of board nominees) is filed. We are continuing the proxy fight. There is 
no change in our direction." 
</P>
<P>
Coniston, which is UAL's largest single shareholder with 11.8%, said its 
15-member board slate consisted of four union representatives, three Coniston 
partners and eight other people. The unions are the Air Line Pilots Assn., the 
International Assn. of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers, and the Assn. of 
Flight Attendants. 
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that the board had few alternatives and virtually had to talk 
with the unions. 
</P>
<P>
"The board was limited in its range of options," said Timothy Pettee, airline 
analyst in New York with the Merrill Lynch investment firm. "They clearly could 
not dispatch the proposal summarily. They have to entertain the overture, as it 
does represent nearly 12% of the shareholders and the majority of the 
employees." 
</P>
<P>
Pettee added that although financing is harder to get now than it was last year 
and leveraged buyouts are no longer in vogue, a financier might come forward to 
try to buy UAL. He said possible buyers might well be impressed with the fact 
that last year's takeover of Northwest Airlines by a group headed by Los 
Angeles financier Alfred A. Checchi "is going so well." 
</P>
<P>
Observers said they doubt that UAL will be liquidated to fend off the pursuers, 
but they noted that the airline has certain assets that could be sold. For 
instance, they said, it owns half of Covia, the company that operates its 
Apollo computer reservation system, the nation's second largest. The other half 
was sold for $500 million last year to a group of other airlines. United's half 
is estimated to be worth between $600 million and $700 million now. 
</P>
<P>
United could also sell off its lucrative Pacific routes, which it bought from 
Pan Am Corp. in 1985 for $750 million. This is considered doubtful, however, 
since the Pacific division is considered the most valuable part of the airline. 
As another alternative, it could sell older planes, or it could sell some of 
its new planes and lease them back.

Sega Wins Joe Montana Endorsement: Video game maker Sega of America signed 
quarterback Joe Montana -- a self-proclaimed "video nut" -- to his largest 
endorsement deal yet, outbidding industry giant Nintendo with a 
multimillion-dollar offer. The five-year contract gives Sega the exclusive 
rights to make and sell home video games, arcade games and computer software 
using the Super Bowl champion's likeness. 
</P>
<P>
The exact size of the contract was not disclosed, but Montana said it was 
bigger than any other deal he has signed to date, including his contract with 
shoemakers L.A. Gear, which was estimated at $3 million to $5 million, although 
Montana said those estimates were high. Montana will help Sega, based in South 
San Francisco, develop football video games in which he will star.

MARKET BEAT: EAST FINALLY STARTS AFFECTING WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. investors on Thursday finally displayed a little worry about Japan's 
continuing market plunge. But the selling that made up the 32.21-point drop in 
the Dow Jones industrials, to 2,695.72, didn't appear to include much dumping 
of U.S. stocks by Japanese investors themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, traders said some U.S. investors simply got itchy fingers and used 
Japan as an excuse to take some profits. Other investors seemed genuinely 
frightened. "This has really, finally got some people nervous," said Jack 
Baker, trader at Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, though, the decline was far less severe than some investors had 
expected in Japan's wake. 
</P>
<P>
Following another horrendous fall in Tokyo's Nikkei stock index Thursday -- a 
963.85-point decline to 29,843.34 -- concern was high at Wall Street's opening 
that Japanese investors would begin liquidating investments here. 
</P>
<P>
The reason: Many Japanese investors who tried to unload stocks in Tokyo on 
Thursday were unable to do so because of the avalanche of sell orders. So if 
they wanted to raise cash, U.S. markets offered the only real hope. That could 
be the case for the Japanese today as well. 
</P>
<P>
But Shearson's Baker said that while he saw "some selling from overseas" 
Thursday, it was limited. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Ned Collins, a Daiwa Securities trader in New York, said Japanese 
investors "have not been sellers through the Big Four (Japanese brokerages)," 
which are Daiwa, Nomura Securities, Yamaichi Securities and Nikko Securities. 
</P>
<P>
The flip side is that the Japanese weren't heavy buyers of U.S. stocks Thursday 
either. Many analysts expect that Japanese investors ultimately will increase 
their stock and bond holdings here as they exit their own markets, especially 
if the dollar rises further. But traders say many Japanese are unwilling to 
take any new investment positions before the Japanese fiscal year ends next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its loss, the Dow rebounded from a drop of nearly 50 points at midday. 
By the close, the stocks that took the biggest hits were, predictably, those 
that have been strongest lately -- technology issues and industrial issues. In 
that sense, Thursday looked like good old-fashioned profit taking rather than 
the start of a severe market crack. 
</P>
<P>
Caution on Wall St.: Two big brokerages -- Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch -- 
flashed caution lights Thursday, though they didn't get much credit for the 
Dow's fall. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan advised clients to cut stock holdings to 45% of a global portfolio from 
55%, raise cash investments to 15% from 5% and keep 40% in bonds. Merrill 
strategist Charles Clough advised cutting stocks to 40% from 45%, raising cash 
to 10% from 5% and keeping bonds at 50%. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan cited the Japanese market's deterioration as one reason for its caution. 
Clough, meanwhile, said stocks have become overvalued versus bonds and also 
cited worries about the banking system. Though Clough continues to favor such 
stock groups as technology and industrial equipment as prime holdings for the 
'90s, he said those stocks have run up too fast in recent weeks. Better wait a 
bit, Clough advised: "Patience in building positions will be rewarded." 
</P>

Is Mattel a Growth Stock? Some gutsy investors have made a fast buck in shares 
of toy giant Mattel Inc. over the past year. The big question now is whether 
Mattel can persuade Wall Street that it's a turnaround story with staying 
power. 
</P>
<P>
Shares of the Hawthorne-based firm rocketed from $10 early in 1989 to $20 by 
year-end. After falling back a bit early this year, Mattel is back up to 
$20.375. The driving force: Renewed optimism about the company's ability to 
turn a reliable profit from its rich toy chest, which includes Barbie, Hot 
Wheels and Disney infant toys. 
</P>
<P>
In the '80s, Mattel sometimes looked more like a company run by children than 
for them: Toy trends went boom and bust repeatedly, and so did Mattel's 
earnings and stock. "In the early '80s, the mentality was, 'Let's get sales 
volume,' " even if earnings were sacrificed, admits Jim Eskridge, Mattel's 
chief financial officer. Now, he said, "our objective is consistent profitable 
growth." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Mattel's operating earnings jumped 113%, to $1.60 a share from 75 
cents in 1988. Revenue rose 25% to $1.24 billion. 
</P>
<P>
This week, Merrill Lynch analyst Harold Vogel raised his 1990 earnings estimate 
to $2 from $1.85, citing strength in Barbie sales and other lines. Kidder, 
Peabody &amp; Co. analyst Gary Jacobson thinks $2.10 is possible this year. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than chase every new toy trend it sees, Mattel is concentrating on 
extensions of its core lines, such as Barbie, which have never lost popularity. 
New this year: Barbie dolls and accessories designed to appeal to a wider age 
group of girls. Mattel also sees great potential in Europe, where it now is the 
largest toy maker. 
</P>
<P>
It sounds like a growth company, all right. But Mattel stock's price/earnings 
ratio is a mere 10 if Jacobson's 1990 estimate is correct. So Wall Street 
clearly still is treating the firm more like a cyclic company than a growth 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobson believes that attitude will change over time, as Mattel proves that it 
can deliver solid earnings growth year after year. If Mattel just sold for the 
same P/E ratio as the average stock -- now about 13 -- the stock price would be 
near $27 instead of $20. This is one to watch if not own.

STOCK MARKET IN TOKYO REGAINS ITS COMPOSURE

Stock prices in Tokyo were slightly lower after an early surge this morning, 
one day after a hectic selloff that pushed the market's key index to its lowest 
close in 15 months. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar opened marginally lower against the Japanese yen and then rose. 
</P>
<P>
The 225-share Nikkei stock index was down 90.57 points, or 0.30%, to 29,752.77 
in morning trading. The index regained about 400 points shortly after the 
session began, but started falling within 40 minutes of trading. 
</P>
<P>
Kazuyuki Suzuki, a dealer with Daiwa Securities Co., attributed the early 
recovery to the yen's slight increase against the dollar in Tokyo, as well as 
to price stability of Japanese stocks traded overseas. 
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei fell 963.85 points, or 3.13%, to 29,843.34 on Thursday, its lowest 
close since it ended at 29,741.28 on Dec. 24, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In foreign exchange, the dollar started trading at 154.75 yen, down 0.08 yen 
from Thursday's close at 154.83 yen. The currency was changing hands at 155.05 
yen in morning action.

Japan's markets were closed Wednesday for a national holiday.

in the stock and currency markets accelerated market players' fears that the 
situation could seriously damage Japan's economy. 
</P>
<P>
Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading economic daily, reported today that the 
Finance Ministry has requested securities houses to limit certain activities in 
an attempt to prevent excessive market declines. 
</P>
<P>
A Nomura Securities Co. dealer said selling was coming from institutional 
investors, which are attempting to minimize risks and reduce losses before the 
account settlement for fiscal 1989, which ends March 31. 
</P>
<P>
The price of the benchmark No. 119 Japanese government bond was quoted this 
morning at 86.80 points, up from Thursday's close at 86.54 points. Its yield 
was down to 7.180% from 7.235% the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
A morning rush of sell orders Thursday met virtually no buy orders, sending the 
Nikkei down 1,836 points by the midday break, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
But the index rebounded in the afternoon as market players decided it had 
bottomed for the day after breaking the psychologically important 29,000-point 
barrier, said Hisao Yasuda, a dealer with Nikko Securities Co.

CASTLE &amp; COOKE TELLS SEC HOW IT PLANS TO SPIN OFF FOOD UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Castle &amp; Cooke, a Los Angeles-based holding company, has filed documents 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission detailing how it will spin off its 
subsidiary, Dole Food Co., company officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
David H. Murdock, Castle &amp; Cooke chairman and chief executive, announced 
last May that the holding company intended to split into two separate 
corporations -- one for food production and distribution, and the other for 
real estate development. 
</P>
<P>
In a written statement released Thursday, the company said it has filed its 
preliminary statements; final versions have yet to be filed and mailed to 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
"As previously announced, for each Castle share held, shareholders will receive 
an additional share of Dole," the written statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Dole, the world's largest producer of pineapple, also markets other fruits and 
vegetables, some of them grown in California. Castle &amp; Cooke owns an entire 
Hawaiian island, Lanai, and has holdings in California and Arizona.

EASTERN'S PILOTS OK 25% WAGE CUTS, REDUCED BENEFITS; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: WHEN THE INTERIM CONTRACT EXPIRES JULY 1, THE CARRIER SAYS, IT WILL 
NEED MANY MORE CONCESSIONS TO EMERGE FROM BANKRUPTCY.

<P>
Eastern Airlines and its pilots union have agreed to an interim contract that 
calls for a 25% wage cut, but does not call for rehiring pilots who went on 
strike, the company said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
And the carrier insisted that it needs twice that amount in concessions by the 
time the contract expires on July 1 to emerge successfully from Chapter 11 
bankruptcy proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
The wage cut applies to Eastern pilots still being paid at the pre-strike wage 
rate. Eastern had 3,600 union pilots who honored picket lines when a sympathy 
strike with machinists began in March, 1989. Since then, many pilots have 
returned, replacements have been hired at lower wages and the airline has sold 
many routes. 
</P>
<P>
Time to resolve the dispute "regrettably has just about run out, in light of 
the reorganization timetable," said Thomas J. Matthews, senior vice president 
of human resources for the carrier, which is owned by Texas Air Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern Air Line Pilots Assn. spokesman Edward Breen charged that the company 
intends to use the temporary agreement, which was negotiated with the help of 
the National Mediation Board, as a device to crush the union. 
</P>
<P>
He said by demanding more concessions in advance, Eastern hoped to push the 
talks into a final impasse. 
</P>
<P>
"Their first preference would be to have the NMB put us in a cooling-off 
period," Breen said Thursday. "After that, they can impose their own 
conditions." 
</P>
<P>
Breen said ALPA executives had agreed in principle to the contract, but it will 
not be signed until after a formal vote of the Master Executive Committee on 
Saturday in Washington. He said the union leaders reluctantly went along with 
the interim contract to show they were bargaining in good faith and to persuade 
the mediation board to pressure Eastern to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
The wage cuts applies to about 850 Eastern pilots still working at the 
pre-strike average of $72,000 a year. A 25% cut would bring that average down 
to $54,000. But it excludes about 950 replacement pilots hired at an average 
$27,500 when the strike began. 
</P>
<P>
The new wage levels are among the lowest in the country for major carriers, 
Breen said. 
</P>
<P>
"An Eastern pilot after this will make about 50% of what a United Airlines 
pilot makes -- and they still can't make a profit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There was no agreement on the key sticking point of hiring back more of the 
pilots who went on strike. 
</P>
<P>
"The agreement does not cover that -- it covers only wages and benefits," 
Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said. "And the simple fact is that no jobs are 
available now." 
</P>
<P>
The interim agreement calls for a reduction in the airline's contribution to 
the pilots' pension plan, increased pilot contributions to their medical and 
dental insurance, and the preservation of tougher work rules in effect since 
the strike. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern insisted federal mediators would have to continue efforts to reach a 
permanent agreement to cut costs further. 
</P>
<P>
"If expedited mediation is not successful in leading to such an arrangement, 
Eastern . . . will have to promptly seek bankruptcy court permission to achieve 
full cost reductions on a long-term basis," Eastern said in its statement. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern's ALPA contract expired in June, 1988, but its provisions had remained 
in effect under the Railway Labor Act. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern lost $282.6 million in the last quarter of 1989, bringing total losses 
for the year to $852.3 million, or almost all of Houston-based Texas Air's 
$885.6-million loss.

STORE OWNERS VOW TO HELP THE ENVIRONMENT 
</P>

What's a paper bridal gown decorated with household bits and pieces (phone 
cord,cotton swabs, plastic bags, coffee filters) doing in a boutique that 
normally drapes the bride in silk and lace? 
</P>
<P>
Susan Lane, a determined fashion-industry environmentalist and owner of Country 
Elegance in Toluca Lake, hopes the dress will motivate people to recycle. It 
goes on display today in a store where the mainstay of the business is 
Victorian wedding finery for brides, including Cristina Ferrare, Lesley Ann 
Warren and Delta Burke, and TV brides, such as those on "Santa Barbara" and 
"L.A. Law." 
</P>
<P>
"I felt so guilty looking at my plastic trash bags and going to the market and 
bringing home more plastic bags," Lane explains. "I thought: Wouldn't it be 
great if I could use them for something else, if instead of fabric I could use 
plastic? 
</P>
<P>
"A bridal dress is one of the most beautiful garments a woman can wear. I've 
made this one out of things that really aren't very attractive, but they look 
beautiful. The idea is to get people to reuse things they would normally throw 
away. Years ago, people would use old bottles for candlesticks," Lane says. 
"We've gotten away from that. We're all so chic." 
</P>
<P>
Made from paper interfacing (the material used to stiffen garments), the 
deceptively pretty gown is decorated with ruffles and flowers crafted from 
white plastic shopping bags, pink-painted coffee filters and paper plates, 
cotton swabs dipped in pink paint, six-pack rings and green telephone cord. A 
similar scavenger-combination is used for the elaborate bouquet and headpiece. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very labor intensive," says Lane, explaining why she will offer only 
unadorned paper dresses for $180 and leave it up to handy brides to add their 
own recycled extras. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Lane created her first paper garments, all from interfacing, 
to promote recycling for the American Paper Institute. But her latest project 
has affected her just as she hopes it will affect others: "I'm thinking about 
recycling all the time now." 
</P>
<P>
Lane now takes plastic bags back to the market and fills them with groceries. 
In her shop, cans and bottles are separated and sent to recycling centers. No 
plastic foam cups are allowed; employees have their own mugs. And her concern 
about the water shortage has led to new rules at home: Don't let water run 
while brushing teeth; take shorter showers; don't rinse dishes before putting 
in dishwasher. 
</P>
<P>
At Clacton &amp; Frinton -- a bastion of English and old-Hollywood-inspired 
men's wear on La Cienega Boulevard in Los Angeles -- co-owner Hilary Anderson 
explains she got her latest environmental nudge from the same bete noire that 
disturbed Susan Lane: the plastic shopping bag. 
</P>
<P>
But Anderson and her friend Linda Leeds were equally disenchanted with paper 
bags. So they came up with a rugged canvas tote that measures 17 by 12 by 7 
inches and can easily hold 28 pounds of groceries, Anderson says. The bags are 
available in limited supply at two food stores, Erewhon on Beverly Boulevard in 
Los Angeles and Cooportunity in Santa Monica; they retail from $12 to $14.95. 
</P>
<P>
Other environmentally friendly habits for Hilary and her husband-business 
partner, Michael Anderson, include business cards printed on recycled paper. 
They also go to extraordinary lengths to use recycled materials in their 
low-maintenance, drought-resistant gardens. Their agave and aloe plants, for 
example, come from cuttings "I just picked up when people left them out in 
their trash," says Michael. And their fertilizer "is manure we get from a man 
in Pasadena who has a horse. We've been doing it for years," says Hilary. 
</P>
<P>
Leeds, whose goal is "one garbage can a week for a family of three," keeps a 
compost pile of grass and vegetable peels in her back yard for fertilizer and 
makes sure everything, including the computer paper used by her husband, 
screenwriter Jack Baran, goes to a recycling center. Neither Leeds nor the 
Andersons will buy anything that comes in polystyrene containers -- or plastic, 
if possible. 
</P>
<P>
"I preselect. That's more important then recycling," says Leeds. "I don't buy 
anything in plastic if I can live without it." That includes liquid bleach. To 
get clothes whiter, she soaks them in Borax. Hilary also uses Borax -- mixed 
with vinegar -- for a "natural" household cleanser. All of this seems natural 
for two women who searched long and hard for the right way to decorate their 
canvas shopping bags. Their choice: an engraving of a little girl deep in a 
forest encircled with the slogan "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle."

HOOKED ON SHOPPING? THERE'S HELP; 
</P>
<P>
ADDICTIONS: THERAPIST'S BOOK OFFERS A 14-POINT RECOVERY PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANCINE PARNES, Parnes, a free-lance writer, regularly contributes to The 
Times' fashion pages. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Eve" is a shop-'til-you-dropper who regularly controls her urge to charge it 
by placing her charge cards in the freezer. But when she's bent on another 
binge-and-splurge episode, she microwaves the plastic back to life. 
</P>
<P>
"Jessica" lives on a remote island off the East Coast but still packs in six 
hours of shopping every day. This despite the fact that she's limited to one 
department store and a few hotel gift shops. 
</P>
<P>
The source of this information is Carolyn Wesson, a Silicon Valley 
psychotherapist, who found herself with a progression of patients like Eve and 
Jessica and discovered that a lot of beautiful clothes dressed some 
less-than-beautiful stories. 
</P>
<P>
A self-proclaimed shopaholic, Wesson has written "Women Who Shop Too Much: 
Overcoming the Urge to Splurge" (St. Martin's Press). 
</P>
<P>
Wesson found out that the addiction extends far beyond Imelda Marcos, the grand 
lady of conspicuous consumption, with her 508 floor-length gowns, 15 mink coats 
and 2,700 pairs of shoes. 
</P>
<P>
One can easily encounter a shopaholic and not even know it, since many do not 
possess an impressive designer wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
"I buy a lot of things I don't need, mainly because they're on sale," confides 
an Orange County woman, in debt because of her daily lunch hour sprees. 
</P>
<P>
All told, an estimated 59 million American women use shopping as a way of 
coping with psychological problems, "stumbling to the nearest store for retail 
therapy," says Wesson. She limits the scope of her book to women because men 
tend toward other addictions such as alcohol, drugs, work and sports. 
</P>
<P>
Wesson offers a self-assessment quiz, indicating the characteristics of 
addicted shoppers: They routinely shop to avoid their emotions; they begin 
their shopping sprees with heart-palpitating highs but retreat with regret, 
self-recrimination and depression; they suddenly spend more without apparent 
reason; they may fall into substantial debt; they often buy things they never 
use. 
</P>
<P>
If you flunk the quiz, help is available through Wesson's 14-point recovery 
plan and through organizations such as Debtors Anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
The author theorizes that excessive shopping usually stems from the same causes 
as other addictions, such as "low self-esteem, a lonely childhood, parents who 
withheld love, emotional stress, an unhappy marriage or love relationship, a 
recent breakup -- all of which gives rise to feelings of deprivation and the 
urge to acquire possessions, even useless ones." 
</P>
<P>
To develop her theory of shopaholism, Wesson attended conventions and training 
sessions for Adult Children of Alcoholics, a national organization. She did 
numerous studies of addictive personalities she treated in private practice and 
read extensively on the addictive personality. 
</P>
<P>
Wesson notes that Los Angeles has an atmosphere particularly conducive to 
shopaholism. "Because of the movie and TV industry, there is an enormous 
emphasis on looks and appearances," she says. "Rodeo Drive is a mecca, the 
ultimate shopping experience, and one of the L.A. musts for women who shop too 
much."

RECORD CHAIN CLEARS SHELVES OF RAP ALBUM; 
</P>
<P>
POP: MUSICLAND AND SAM GOODY STORES BAN SALE OF 2 LIVE CREW'S 'NASTY,' BUT NOT 
THE GROUP'S CLEANED-UP VERSION OF 'WANNA BE.' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's largest chain of record stores on Thursday ordered all its outlets 
to stop stocking and selling "uncensored" recordings by the controversial 
Florida-based rap group 2 Live Crew. 
</P>
<P>
In a computer memo to the Minneapolis-based Musicland group's 752 stores -- 
including about 90 Musicland and Sam Goody outlets in Southern California -- 
chief executive officer Arnie Bernstein instructed stores to ship 2 Live Crew 
stock back to headquarters in April. 
</P>
<P>
The order applies to the group's expletive-laced "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" 
album and other recordings but not to the group's considerably toned-down 
alternate version "As Clean as They Wanna Be." 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein told the chain's employees that all inquiries about the new policy 
should be directed to him. A secretary in Bernstein's Minneapolis office said, 
however, that he was in a board meeting for much of the day and was unavailable 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Veronica Ronchetti, manager of the Musicland at 725 S. Figueroa St. in downtown 
Los Angeles, said that the computer memo was waiting for her when she opened 
the store Thursday morning, and that she was instructed to tell customers that 
the store now only sold the "clean" versions of the group's material. 
</P>
<P>
Employees at other Musicland stores confirmed the report. 
</P>
<P>
The 2 Live Crew's sexually explicit album "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" has been 
at the center of a storm recently. A call for an obscenity and racketeering 
investigation against the group's Miami-based Luke Skyywalker record label by 
Florida Gov. Bob Martinez led to stores throughout the state pulling the 
group's records from their shelves. 
</P>
<P>
On March 9, a judge in Florida's Broward County, which includes Ft. Lauderdale, 
ruled the "Nasty" album obscene and banned its sale in the county, and on the 
other side of the state last week a 19-year-old clerk at a Sarasota record 
store was arrested for selling a tape of the album to an 11-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously we're not pleased," said Skyywalker public relations director Debbie 
Bennett of the Musicland action. "But we can understand where they're coming 
from. No retailers want to take too much heat over this and we don't want them 
to. But I received a few calls from Musicland employees telling me they don't 
think it's right and they will tell the company. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously there's nothing legally we can do," Bennett said. "You can't make a 
retailer stock anything." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett said that Skyywalker is today filing an amendment complaint to suspend 
the Broward County ruling while a court case is prepared, but has asked 
retailers in Broward not to break the ban as long as it stands. She also 
claimed that the controversy over the group had actually launched the album 
into the top spot among cassette and compact disc sales in the Musicland chain. 
</P>
<P>
The "Nasty" album cover carries a notice warning of explicit lyrics, and 
Skyywalker head Luther Campbell has stated that he does not consider the album 
appropriate for minors. 
</P>
<P>
Several chains, including Albany, New York-based Trans World Music, the 
nation's second-largest chain with 433 outlets, had already pulled the records 
from their Florida stores and instituted an 18-and-over sales policy for sales 
of the recordings elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Musicland's move on Thursday was the first nationwide action against the 
recording, however.

PARAMOUNT'S NET PROFIT CENTRAL TO BUCHWALD SUIT; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: SECOND PHASE OF 'COMING TO AMERICA' CASE COULD JEOPARDIZE 40 YEARS OF 
STUDIO ACCOUNTING PRACTICES. 
</P>

What does net profit mean in Hollywood? 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for both humorist Art Buchwald and Paramount Pictures agree that an 
ongoing legal tug-of-war over an estimated $250 million to $300 million in 
ticket sales, video rights, TV licensing fees and other revenues from the 
studio's 1988 comedy hit "Coming to America" may come down to how a Los Angeles 
Superior Court judge answers that deceptively simple question. 
</P>
<P>
In so doing, Judge Harvey Schneider will have the opportunity to affirm at 
least 40 years of studio accounting practices or throw the entire entertainment 
industry into accounting chaos, according to lawyers for the studio and the 
columnist. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope that (Judge Schneider) does (redefine net profit) because it is a 
grossly unfair system that goes on, year after year, unchallenged," said 
Buchwald's attorney Pierce O'Donnell. "The net profit system in Hollywood is a 
scam. The only question is whether it's legal." 
</P>
<P>
Counters Paramount attorney Charles Diamond: "It's unfortunate that Art 
Buchwald has spent a year and $1 million on a suit that is now relegated to the 
argument that the contract (i.e., the net profit definition) is illegal." 
</P>
<P>
Since Jimmy Stewart negotiated Hollywood's first profit participation deal on 
the 1950 Western "Winchester '73," studios have -- as a matter of course -- had 
to cut their stars, directors, writers and producers in on the profits of 
movies. To get around that bottom line drain, however, studio contracts have 
defined and redefined a film's expenses before it actually goes into profits. 
As a result, contract semantics can often make it impossible for a motion 
picture to ever break even, leaving many of the people who make motion pictures 
with virtually worthless net profit shares of a bottom line that is almost 
always drawn in red ink. 
</P>
<P>
The case of Buchwald vs. Paramount Pictures could change all of that. 
</P>
<P>
Buchwald sued Paramount claiming that he, not Eddie Murphy, authored the story 
for "Coming to America." After a two-week trial in December, Judge Schneider 
ruled in Buchwald's favor. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount's attorneys have maintained all along, however, that Buchwald is 
bound by a contract he signed eight years ago, when he wrote the story that 
"Coming to America" was based upon. Buchwald and his partner Alain Bernheim 
agreed to receive $250,000 plus 19% of the film's net profits. 
</P>
<P>
Buchwald and Bernheim guess that they are owed 19% of at least $2 million. 
Paramount, however, maintains they are entitled to 19% of nothing, for under 
Hollywood's unique accounting system the Eddie Murphy comedy about an African 
prince who comes to New York to find his bride is somewhere between $17 million 
and $18 million in the hole. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning today, using a legal Q&amp;A process called "interrogatories," 
Paramount will start formally answering specific questions posed by Buchwald's 
attorneys about how one of the most successful movies the studio has ever 
released can still remain $17 million in the red. What they will ultimately 
find, said Diamond, is that Paramount was correct in describing the dispute as 
being little more than a squabble over about $50,000 in up-front salary that 
the studio may or may not owe Buchwald and producer Alain Bernheim. 
</P>
<P>
In figures released this week, Paramount has maintained that distribution 
expenses, fees, interest, overhead, production costs and other expenses have 
already eaten up the $125 million that the studio had taken in as of Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Accountants, attorneys and auditors for both sides will spend the next several 
weeks going over Paramount's books before the case actually goes to court July 
9. The July court hearing is the second phase of the trial, in which Buchwald 
will attempt to show that Paramount is hiding profits by bloating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"They're trying to low ball their figures," said O'Donnell. 
</P>
<P>
O'Donnell said the studio has a history of inflating its expenses and will 
introduce profit statements from another hit Paramount movie, "Fatal 
Attraction," during the second phase to show how the studio systematically 
drains its biggest hits of all money before any of its profit participants get 
anything. A studio profit statement on "Fatal Attraction" dated Dec. 23, 1989, 
showed that it had earned $166 million for the studio, but still showed a net 
deficit of $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
O'Donnell maintains that documents he obtained through pre-trial discovery last 
fall show a gross of $151 million as of last October, not $125 million as it 
has reported this week. In an interview, O'Donnell said the studio leaked the 
lower figure to the media this week as part of "a campaign of disinformation" 
prior to the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Diamond said that the figures, which are accurate, were not leaked to 
the press, but, rather, openly given as part of the studio's attempt to set the 
record straight. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not subject to a gag order in this section of the trial, so we can show 
the exaggerated and distorted expressions (of O'Donnell) as what they are," 
said Diamond. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond's figures show that "Coming to America" grossed $125 million (about 
half what it earned at the box office, after splitting worldwide receipts with 
theater owners) as of Dec. 31. Paramount took a standard 35% "distribution fee" 
of $42 million up front as "Coming to America's" distributor, characterized in 
the entertainment industry as a kind of "banking" fee that is always charged 
against any movie a major studio releases. That left $83 million. 
</P>
<P>
Next, according to the Paramount breakdown, the studio took out $36 million for 
distribution expenses: the cost of advertising, making prints of the movie and 
getting it out to theaters around the world. That reduced the bottom line to 
$47 million. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike net profit participants Buchwald and Bernheim, Eddie Murphy and the 
movie's director, John Landis, had "gross" profit deals that entitled them to 
cuts of the film's gross receipts, totaling another $11 million, according to 
Paramount. That reduced the bottom line to $36 million. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount also charged about $5 million interest on the movie's production 
budget or so-called "negative" cost, lowering the profit margin to about $31 
million. 
</P>
<P>
And, finally, the total negative cost for "Coming to America" (i.e., actual 
production cost plus studio overhead) came to $48 million, by Paramount's 
figures, leaving a deficit of between $17 million and $18 million. 
</P>
<P>
Buchwald and Bernheim have stated publicly that they will settle out of court 
for $5 million, but are unwilling to agree to any stipulation that they remain 
silent about the settlement details or any information surrounding Paramount's 
finances that they discovered in the course of their lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Despite being admittedly weary by the extended legal battle, Buchwald remained 
lighthearted when he visited Los Angeles last weekend during an awards 
presentation dinner sponsored by the Writers Guild of America. He characterized 
the audit of Paramount's books as "The search for Red October, and November and 
December . . . ," referring to the studio's current blockbuster "The Hunt for 
Red October," which, Buchwald predicted, will also probably come up profitless. 
According to Daily Variety, the Sean Connery thriller took in $53.9 million the 
first 17 days it was in the nation's theaters. 
</P>
<P>
"If Paramount makes any more money, they're going to have to declare 
bankruptcy," he quipped. 
</P>
<P>
'COMING TO AMERICA' -- THE BOTTOM LINE 
</P>

Worldwide box-office receipts: About $250 million 
</P>
<P>
Film rental income to Paramount: $125 million

HOME TECH / CD CORNER: MOST-WANTED BOWIE ALBUM ALTERED, EXPANDED BY RYKODISC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The wait is over for "Changesonebowie," the David Bowie greatest-hits 
collection that was the catalogue album the public most wanted transferred to 
compact disc, according to a 1988 Billboard magazine survey of retailers. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the ambitious Rykodisc Bowie reissue program that began last year with 
the Grammy-winning "Sound + Vision" box set, the new package -- which has been 
renamed simply "Changesbowie" -- adds seven songs and 27 minutes to the 
original, 11-song, 47-minute "Changesonebowie" album that was released in vinyl 
and cassette by RCA Records in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
The new material includes three songs from Bowie's years on RCA -- "Heroes," 
"Ashes to Ashes" and "Fashion" -- as well as four numbers from his post-RCA 
days on EMI Records. The latter: "Let's Dance," "China Girl," "Modern Love" and 
"Blue Jean." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the original version of "Fame" that was a No. 1 single in 1975, the 
new album contains "Fame '90," a remix that is in the new film "Pretty Woman." 
</P>
<P>
Though these Bowie songs form an essential chapter in the pop-rock story of the 
'70s and '80s, it's interesting to note that fewer than half of them were 
actual Top 40 hits. 
</P>
<P>
That's because Bowie, for most of his career, was considered too radical for 
mass tastes by conservative radio programmers. However, the songs seem like 
familiar "hits" because they were key parts of his albums and live shows. 
</P>
<P>
Next from Rykodisc in the Bowie reissue series: "Ziggy Stardust" in late May. 
</P>
<P>
COUNTRY GEMS: The late Lefty Frizzell, one of the half-dozen most influential 
singers ever in country music, is finally available on CD, though the album -- 
an entry in Columbia Records' "American Originals" budget series -- is little 
more than a third as long as "Changesbowie." 
</P>
<P>
Listen to Frizzell's slightly slurred, bent-note vocal style on some of the 
older tunes on the album -- especially "Always Late" and "Mom and Dad's Waltz," 
both from 1951 -- and it's easy to see how Frizzell was a model for such 
acclaimed country singers as Merle Haggard, George Jones, John Anderson and 
Randy Travis. 
</P>
<P>
The disappointment with the new CD is that Columbia didn't salute Frizzell with 
a more comprehensive package -- something along the lines of the 26-song, 
65-minute Don Gibson CD that has been released in Europe by Bear Family Records 
and is available here in stores that carry import CDs. 
</P>
<P>
Though known outside the country field primarily as the man who wrote such 
pop-country classics as "I Can't Stop Loving You" and "Oh Lonesome Me," Gibson 
demonstrated in these RCA recordings from the late '50s and early '60s that he 
was also a gifted singer whose teardrop style was closer to a blues-country 
merger than the honky-tonk approach of most postwar country singers. 
</P>
<P>
IN THE STORES: Blue Oyster Cult's "Career of Evil" (a greatest-hits collection 
from Columbia Records) . . . John Hiatt's "Slug Line" and "Two Bit Monsters" 
(budget entries from MCA, recorded in 1979 and 1980, respectively) . . . Aaron 
Neville's "Orchid in the Storm" (a highly recommended mini-album re-release 
from Rhino) . . . Donna Summer's "Live and More" (the Casablanca album from 
1978 features "Love to Love You, Baby," "I Feel Love" and "Last Dance").

PREVIEW: CHORALE TURNS TO TRADITIONAL AMERICAN MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WYMA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eastern Europe may seem an odd source for an inspiration about traditional 
American music. But that's where John Alexander's thoughts traveled some months 
ago when he planned the program for Saturday's performance by the Valley Master 
Chorale. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander, artistic director of the 150-voice group, is a staunch advocate of 
classical music. He wouldn't be caught doing a night at the pops. But this time 
around, the chorus is presenting a middle ground of sorts -- a night of 
traditional American songs. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been to the Eastern bloc several times, and in all the countries I've 
found that the traditional music is very important," said Alexander, a music 
professor and chairman of choral activities at Cal State Northridge. "I admire 
that. The choirs use folk music, but it's done in a classical idiom." 
</P>
<P>
In Saturday night's appearance at the Reseda High School Auditorium, the Valley 
Master Chorale will be joined by an orchestra. On the program are Aaron 
Copland's "Old American Songs," Randall Thompson's "Frostiana" and several 
songs from George Gershwin's "Porgy and Bess." 
</P>
<P>
The works range from the familiar -- who doesn't know Gershwin's "Summertime" 
and "It Ain't Necessarily So" -- to some played so seldom that Alexander had 
not heard them. That is the case with the "Frostiana" pieces, Robert Frost 
poems backed by Thompson's music done with full orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
"Randall Thompson is a very conservative classical American composer," said 
Alexander, who also directs the Pacific Chorale of Orange County. "He wrote the 
pieces for piano and choir, then later for orchestra. The later version is 
rarely performed, and I'm looking forward to it very much." 
</P>
<P>
The Copland works are arrangements of traditional American songs. "I Bought Me 
a Cat" is a children's song that has the choir making the sounds of geese, 
ducks, cows, pigs and other animals. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most familiar of the songs is "Shall We Gather by the River." 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of people know that one, but not everyone knows a song like 'Ching-a-Ring 
Chaw,' " the choir director said. "It was very popular in the 19th Century. 
There's evidence of minstrels singing it up and down the rivers on river boats 
and all through the Midwest and the South." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander believes the program is valuable both as music -- he ranks "Porgy and 
Bess" as the world's greatest folk opera -- and as heritage. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important that we keep our American traditions alive," Alexander said. 
"We keep our classical music alive and our new popular music alive. But not 
always the kind of music we'll be performing." 
</P>
<P>
 "An Evening of Americana" by the Valley Master Chorale under the direction of 
John Alexander will be presented at 8 p.m. Saturday at Reseda High School 
Auditorium, 18230 Kittridge St. Tickets are $12-$15 general; seniors and 
students, $10. Call (818) 362-3572 or (818) 885-3093. MIKE WYMA

BYE-BYE, MR. 'AMERICAN PIE' -- DON MCLEAN GIVES HIS PEN A REST 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don McLean first came into prominence for his songwriting. Critics hailed his 
1972 mega-hit, "American Pie," as the musical epitaph for an era; its lyrics 
were analyzed and reanalyzed by Life, Time and Newsweek. Nearly two decades 
later, McLean, now 44, has come out with a double album consisting entirely of 
interpretations of old pop songs. 
</P>
<P>
"For the Memories, Volumes 1 and 2" is a collection of 20 classics from the 
1930s through the early '60s, including Hoagie Carmichael's "Stardust," Irving 
Berlin's "Change Partners," Marty Robbins' "A White Sport Coat" and Sam Cooke's 
"What a Wonderful World." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not just a songwriter, and I've always felt there were certain songs I 
could sing as a singer but never write," said McLean, who will perform Saturday 
night at the Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"They were songs I've always loved, and I felt I could do them in a different 
way, in my way, and interpret them as a pop singer would interpret popular 
songs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just something I felt like doing, and I did it very quickly. I just went 
into the studio and sang and sang and sang, and it took about two days to 
record and mix the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
McLean's attempts to focus attention on his pipes rather than his pen date back 
to 1981, when he scored a big hit with a remake of Roy Orbison's "Crying." 
Since then, he's made a point of mixing covers with originals, both in concert 
and on his albums, to further defy the topical-songwriter categorization that's 
haunted him since "American Pie." 
</P>
<P>
McLean has never felt comfortable with that label, and with good reason: 
Variety has always been the essence of his career. One of the first songs he 
ever wrote, "And I Love You So," was a huge easy-listening hit for veteran pop 
crooner Perry Como. Less than two years after "American Pie," McLean recorded 
an album of songs in traditional folk and bluegrass styles. 
</P>
<P>
On subsequent recordings, he's been backed by everything from rock bands to 
symphony orchestras, and in 1987 he cut a straight-ahead country album, "Love 
Tracks." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a lot of different Don McLeans," he said. "I want to do something 
different with every record I do, so that when I'm dead and buried, you can go 
back and listen to all my records and not find any songs that sound alike. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to use my career, and my chance to record, to express a wide variety of 
my talents, and this has always been my plan, my hope. It's not a great idea if 
you want to be super commercial, but from the first album I ever made (1970's 
'Tapestry'), I decided this is what I want to do. 
</P>
<P>
"If you go back to 'Tapestry,' there's stuff with a quartet, stuff with strings 
and stuff with just me and my guitar. And at the time, nobody else was doing 
that -- the record companies would say, pick a sound and stick with it for 10 
sides. But I could never do that, and I never did." 
</P>
<P>
McLean was born in New Rochelle, N. Y., and grew up listening to such disparate 
artists as Frank Sinatra, the Weavers and Buddy Holly. 
</P>
<P>
"My father died when I was 15, and I was left with a widowed mother who I had 
to support," McLean recalled. "But I was also free to pursue my dream, which 
was to play my guitar and sing, and that's what I did. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was 17, I went on the road and began performing in coffeehouses all 
over the country, but at the same time I was going to school. My father had 
always wanted me to go to college, and I did, studying economics at Iona 
College (in New Rochelle). I was on the road, and I usually had a school book 
with me." 
</P>
<P>
After graduating in 1968 with a bachelor's degree in economics, McLean struck 
up a friendship with folk singer Pete Seeger. The two sang together at a 
benefit concert for the Hudson River Sloop Restoration, and later that year 
McLean was named "Hudson River Troubadour" by the New York State Council on the 
Arts. For six weeks, he traveled the length of the river, playing three 
concerts a day, five days a week, in various towns along the Hudson. 
</P>
<P>
In 1969, McLean landed a recording contract with Mediarts Records, which was 
promptly absorbed by the nationally distributed United Artists label. 
"Tapestry" came out a year later, followed by "American Pie." The title track, 
an 8 1/2-minute saga inspired by the death of Buddy Holly, went on to become 
one of the biggest-selling singles of 1972. 
</P>
<P>
"I had always been a great lover of Buddy Holly's music, and I felt his death 
personally," McLean said. "I kept that with me, and one day it just came out. I 
fused my feelings about his death with a whole bag of other things in my heart 
about this sense of loss, this sense that we were somehow losing America, and 
it just turned into that song." 
</P>
<P>
The overwhelming critical and commercial success of "American Pie" -- which 
ultimately spent four weeks at No. 1 on the national Top 40 charts -- made 
McLean an instant superstar. 
</P>
<P>
But he soon discovered that fame is fleeting. After scoring three follow-up 
hits with "Vincent" (a tribute to artist Vincent van Gogh), "Castles in the 
Air" and "Dreidel" -- and being immortalized by songwriters Charles Gimble and 
Norman Fox in "Killing Me Softly With His Song," Roberta Flack's Grammy 
Award-winning single of 1973 -- McLean pretty much faded from view, although he 
continued to record and tour. 
</P>
<P>
"I really wasn't in a great mental state during those years," he said. "The 
stresses and the strains of many things developed into a situation that wasn't 
happy. The relationship between the people representing me and my label soured, 
and, coupled with the fact that I had a lot of personal problems, I wasn't 
altogether thrilled with the way things turned out." 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, McLean left United Artists and signed with Arista Records. His Arista 
debut, 1977's "Prime Time," was a commercial dud; four years later, he 
resurfaced on the Millennium label with "Chain Lightning," which yielded the 
Top 40 hit "Crying." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, McLean has jumped ship two more times -- first to Capitol Records, 
after a protracted legal battle with his former manager, then to the Gold 
Castle label -- but he has yet to find his way back to the pop charts. 
</P>
<P>
He says that doesn't bother him. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a full concert schedule every year, and I've made enough money to keep 
me set for life," McLean said. "Besides, if your whole life is centered around 
image and show business, you're bound to be a tortured individual. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you've been No. 1, once you've won your Grammys and your gold records, 
there's only one place to go, and that's down. So you really have to have 
another life, which is why I have so many other things I'm interested in aside 
from concentrating on being Don McLean, on recapturing my past success." 
</P>
<P>
McLean is putting together a musical, "Don McLean's America," scheduled to open 
in June at the Chichester Festival Theater in England.

ANN CONWAY: TV'S NEWSY LOVERS TO BE WED OFF THE RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They fell in love in front of millions, but when KCBS-TV co-anchors Bree Walker 
and Jim Lampley tie the knot at the Ritz-Carlton next month, they'll stand in 
the privacy of a seaside gazebo, with only friends and family in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, a doe-eyed blonde who has been twice married, and the GQ-handsome 
Lampley, who has been married as many times, plan to vow forever on April 7 
during an 11:30 a.m. ceremony. Afterward, the newlyweds will dine with guests 
on Norwegian salmon in the hotel's Pavilion room. 
</P>
<P>
The Walker-Lampley affair, which became publicly known when the duo arrived arm 
in arm at last year's Emmy Awards, is Los Angeles' most visible office romance. 
During a recent newscast, the cameras caught the couple holding hands and 
gazing at each other starry-eyed. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened between us was so powerful, and has such a life of its own, that 
we recognized there would be no turning back," Lampley, 40, told The Times last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, 36, the first physically disabled anchorwoman to reach the top of her 
profession, says she "never suspected that we could be a news item." But 
stories about her disorder, syndactylism, which causes deformed hands and feet, 
have been been played out in People magazine and on ABC's "Good Morning 
America." Those accounts made big news of a newswoman's life. 
</P>
<P>
The couple has been shy about revealing details of their impending marriage, 
and those involved in planning the wedding have been equally reluctant. 
</P>
<P>
The Ritz-Carlton, a haven for celebs hungering for a splendiferous kind of 
privacy, has been instructed to say nothing about the nuptials. "And I must 
respect the request of my guests," insists hotel vice president Henry 
Schielein. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel's hush-hush policy is one of the reasons guests such as Barbra 
Streisand, former President Ronald Reagan and the late Malcolm Forbes have 
visited there. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel security measures for the cliff-side gazebo area include blocking off its 
beach-walk entrance and stationing two security guards on the grounds to keep 
crashers at bay. "But security has never been a problem during my five years 
here," says one of 20 guards employed by the Ritz. 
</P>
<P>
Floral creations for the wedding ceremony will be created by Chris Lindsay 
Designs of Costa Mesa, a florist popular with local A-hostesses. When Walker 
takes her place beside Lampley, she'll carry an all-white bouquet of lilacs, 
freesias and tulips. 
</P>
<P>
Luncheon centerpieces will consist of European hand-tied pastel bouquets placed 
in glass bubble bowls. Flowers will also be part of the couple's wedding cake, 
from the petals that will seem to float upon its frosted layers, to the tiny 
bouquet that will be placed on top. 
</P>
<P>
Love letters: They flooded the mail last week, letters inviting friends of arts 
philanthropist Henry Segerstrom to help create an event "that will bring great 
joy to the gentleman who brought the dream of a performing arts center to 
reality here in Orange County." The black-tie gala that will salute Segerstrom, 
who will step down on April 19 as chairman of the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center, will be held on June 22. After a sit-down dinner for 125 couples on 
stage at the Center, pianist-singer Michael Feinstein will entertain. Center 
President Thomas Kendrick chose Feinstein, he says, "because he represents 
American song in the classic sense. He is a classic exponent of American song." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein, who has six albums on the market (with "Pure Gershwin," "Live at the 
Algonquin" and "Michael Feinstein Sings Irving Berlin" among them) is the 
perfect entertainer for such a gala, Kendrick says, "because we want a very 
classy evening." 
</P>
<P>
Kendrick promises that the stage will be decorated to the hilt for the event, 
with the Center taking advantage of "all of the technology we have available." 
(A set from "Don Quixote," perhaps?) The price tag for the historical gala is 
set at $500 per person. "But this is not a fund-raiser," emphasizes Western 
Digital Chairman Roger Johnson, organizer of the event with incoming board 
chairman William Lyon and Kathryn Thompson. "This is a tribute." 
</P>
<P>
Tidbits: TV personalities Ed McMahon, Gary Collins and Mary Ann Mobley, and 
actor George Peppard will be on hand at the Century Plaza Hotel on Saturday 
when Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley receives the Semper Fidelis Award 
from the directors of the Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation Inc. The 
foundation is staging the "1990 Marine Scholarship Ball" that has half of 
Orange County society buzzing north. Up for entertainment: a performance by the 
U.S. Marine Drum and Bugle Corps and Tex Beneke and his orchestra . . . Dr. 
Walter Henry, Dean of UCI Medical School, and painter Maria Del Carmen Calvo 
will be married on April 7. "We're keeping the location a secret," says Calvo, 
whose impressionistic works have been purchased by prominent locals, including 
Joan Irvine Smith. The couple hopes to honeymoon in Spain, Calvo's birthplace.

STYLE: SOFT, MORE FEMININE LADYLIKE LOOK IS IN

<P>
The faithful had gathered in the lingerie department, 300 of them sandwiched 
somewhere between the bras and teddies, to hear Beverly Purcell spread a bit of 
fashion gospel. 
</P>
<P>
"In the '80s, women had to look efficient. We feel it's time to move on. It's 
time for a more feminine look," preached Purcell, a petite blonde in a smart, 
cream-colored jacket. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody doubted her word, for these commandments of spring, 1990, had been 
handed down from a place on high: Vogue magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Purcell, a merchandising editor for Vogue, recently joined with Robinson's in 
South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa, to present a spring fashion preview to benefit 
Priority Living, Professional Women's Division, a personal growth and 
leadership group for business women. 
</P>
<P>
As her visit illustrated, Vogue carries considerable clout in influencing 
fashions. 
</P>
<P>
Purcell serves as a kind of special envoy for the magazine, working with 
retailers such as Robinson's to "plot out Vogue's fashion point of view using 
what's in the store." 
</P>
<P>
She conducts fashion shows in stores around the country to show customers how 
to dress like the women in the pictures of her slick magazine. She acts as a 
liaison between retailers and Vogue's fashion editors, who in turn work with 
designers to stay on top of trends. 
</P>
<P>
If Vogue's predictions for spring prove true, then the season will bring a crop 
of Jackie Kennedy look-alikes. This new-old look, dubbed "Lady's Day" at the 
Robinson's show, calls for softer, more feminine clothing. 
</P>
<P>
While "Camelot" played on a stereo system and photographs from Vogue flashed on 
a small screen, Purcell ushered in the first lanky models. They appeared on the 
runway wearing teased bouffant hairdos, cat-eye sunglasses, strands of pearls, 
short skirts and wide headbands that emphasized smooth foreheads. 
</P>
<P>
"The '60s!" buzzed several women seated on fold-out chairs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very ladylike look," Purcell said. "It's a tribute to Jackie Kennedy or 
Audrey Hepburn in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's.' " 
</P>
<P>
A tribute, but not a carbon copy. 
</P>
<P>
The '90s version of Camelot is softer, Purcell said, lacking the rigid look of 
'60s styles. The sleeveless chemise is back, but designers have tapered in the 
shift at the waist to accent the figure. 
</P>
<P>
"Dresses wrap gently around the body. They don't grab." 
</P>
<P>
Jackets have softer shoulders -- pads are out, Purcell declared -- and they're 
longer, often falling to the thighs. They flow with a pair of walking shorts or 
a short skirt. To convey the look, Purcell chose an elegant lineup of silk 
jackets, blouses, straight skirts and shorts, including a peach-colored set of 
linen shorts and matching jacket with a silk blouse by Anne Klein II. 
</P>
<P>
Vogue shows models wearing the softer clothes with a half-dozen strands of 
choker-length pearls and "gutsy-sized" earrings. 
</P>
<P>
"Accessories are very bold in size. There are lots of big gold bracelets," said 
Purcell, showing a slide of an arm laden with heavy bangles. "Do we really feel 
you should wear 10 bracelets? Only if you're in the mood. It looks pretty in 
the picture." 
</P>
<P>
Vogue predicts sorbet colors will bloom for spring in clothing and cosmetics. 
Instead of a sweet "candy pink," there's a palette of pinks in softer tones and 
stronger textures, such as suede or brushed leather. The editors also expect 
white to replace black as the uniform color in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
"White is key, whether it's pure or in shades of cream. It's less harsh than 
black," Purcell said. She put the models in combinations of white and cream, 
once a fashion no-no, and proved that an ivory silk jacket by DKNY can look 
terrific with a white knit skirt by Liz Claiborne. 
</P>
<P>
Warmer, richer colors and contrasting black and white polka dots will flourish 
through the season as well. Orange, in hot hues or pale corals, is "making news 
for spring," Purcell said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still a lot of Crayola brights, a lot of dots and a lot of florals," 
she said. One model sported a flouncy bustler dress by A.J. Bari in iridescent 
coral taffeta. 
</P>
<P>
Sling-back shoes in pastel colors, hosiery in natural, ivory or champagne 
shades and short hair styles complete the look for spring, she said. Hemlines 
can be short or long, "depending on what's appropriate," although it's clear 
that Vogue's editors prefer them short. To get hemlines as short as the 
magazine portrays them, models who measured 5-feet-9 and up wore skirts from 
Robinson's petite department. 
</P>
<P>
Purcell was a merchandising editor for Vogue in 1968, then she left to raise 
her children and work as an interior designer, before returning to the magazine 
in 1979. She's married to a pediatrician and lives with her combined family of 
six children in San Antonio, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
"I have one of those jobs where most of the work is done on the telephone," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
She spends 12 to 14 weeks in New York planning promotions and holding fashion 
seminars in Vogue's offices, and travels frequently throughout the year, 
appearing at promotions. 
</P>
<P>
She finds out where styles are headed from Vogue's fashion editors. 
</P>
<P>
"They work with actual designers. A designer may do a skirt and the editors 
will say, 'That looks great, but do you think you can . . . ' They can make 
suggestions to the designers. Whether the designers take them or not is 
questionable." 
</P>
<P>
Once the editors identify trends, Purcell contacts retailers to discuss the 
magazine's point of view on the upcoming season. She presents fashion seminars 
for buyers before they purchase their seasonal lines to give them Vogue's 
viewpoints. 
</P>
<P>
Vogue's input is important. 
</P>
<P>
Retailers know they had better buy pearls, if the magazine shows them piled 
high on their models' swan-like necks. 
</P>
<P>
Purcell's in-store fashion shows spread Vogue's word to customers across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Ever the diplomat, she swears no town is more fashion-savvy than the next. 
</P>
<P>
"My own theory is that wherever you go, you'll find that fashion-forward 
customer. It doesn't matter if you're in New York or Montana. You'll find that 
customer who will fly to Chicago to do their shopping." 
</P>
<P>
The most common fashion blunder she sees: People who overdo a new trend or wear 
clothes that aren't right for them, just because they're "in." 
</P>
<P>
"Fashion-victims get carried away by trends," she said. After seeing styles 
come and go for decades, she can take clothes a little less seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be amused by this whole world of fashion," she said.

ASBURY HAS ANSWERS FOR BEATING LOYOLA;

WEST REGIONAL: BUT ALABAMA HASN'T CALLED. AND IF HE HAD THE SOLUTION, HIS WAVES

<P>
As the ranking expert on how to beat Loyola Marymount, Pepperdine basketball 
Coach Tom Asbury has been in demand this week. 
</P>
<P>
Coaches and sportswriters from around the country have called him in the last 
three days -- virtually everyone, he said, except the Alabama staff that has to 
contend with the Lions at 5:25 today in the third round of the NCAA tournament 
at the Oakland Coliseum Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised they haven't called me. But they know I wouldn't share 
(information) with them. I want Loyola to win," Asbury said. Still, he added, 
"I would love to sit in on the Alabama staff's meeting trying to figure out how 
to stop 'em." 
</P>
<P>
As the Waves' coach the last two seasons, Asbury is 2-2 against the Lions. 
Pepperdine administered Loyola's last loss, 131-123, on Feb. 17 after losing to 
the Lions, 131-116, earlier that week. 
</P>
<P>
So how do you beat Loyola? The Lions, playing with emotional fervor since 
teammate Hank Gathers' death, upended an athletic New Mexico State team, 
111-92, then demolished defending champion Michigan, 149-115. 
</P>
<P>
"If you've got your team's attention and can make them do what you want them to 
do, you've got a chance," Asbury said, adding that there are times when the 
game is going to get out of control because of Loyola's fast break and constant 
full-court press. 
</P>
<P>
"I call it the control factor. (Former Wave coach Jim) Harrick used to call it 
'the disease.' There are periods of time you just lose your team. You just lose 
'em. They get away. That happened here in the game we won, for about three 
minutes. I completely lost our team. Luckily, we kept scoring. Michigan lost 
'em for about 30 of the 40 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
And New Mexico State? 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to criticize another coach's strategy, but why they would press them 
and speed the game up even more, I don't know," Asbury said. 
</P>
<P>
Tactically, he said, Loyola likes to play "an east-west game"cross-court passes 
that lead to open three-pointers -- and added: "You want to make them play a 
north-south game. And if a team can successfully hold the ball and use up the 
clock, it makes them crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Most opponents aren't able to do that against Loyola's all-out press, or they 
find themselves with such easy shots that -- if they get past the press -- are 
too tempting to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Coach Paul Westhead was asked how he would defend against his own team. 
"You could run with us if you could sustain it for 40 minutes," he said. 
"Oklahoma was as conditioned (as Loyola). I would either run with us if I were 
in good shape, or I would play very slow. The other thing that would cause us 
to lose would be (for us) to shoot very poorly." 
</P>
<P>
The Lions are among the nation's leaders in field-goal percentage this season 
at 53%. When they lost to North Carolina in the second round of the NCAA 
tournament two years ago, the entire team shot poorly -- a situation influenced 
by J.R. Reid and other superior Tar Heel talent. 
</P>
<P>
In last year's West Coast Conference tournament final, Loyola won in overtime, 
but Santa Clara used stalling tactics to keep the final score at 75-70. In 
their next game, a 120-101 NCAA tournament loss to Arkansas, Loyola shot only 
36%. 
</P>
<P>
This season, the Lions (25-5) have not been held below 91 points and have 
reached triple figures in 27 of their 30 games, an NCAA record. They go into 
today's contest averaging 125.2 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Teams that have not seen the Lions play are often befuddled by their style. 
"We've seen 'em a lot," Asbury said. "When they're not in your conference and 
you only have a day or two to prepare for them, it's tough." 
</P>
<P>
Loyola and Alabama have never met. 
</P>
<P>
Alabama (26-8) plays some of the toughest defense in the nation, giving up an 
average of only 61.4 points and holding opponents to 40.4% shooting. The 
Crimson Tide held Arizona to a season-low 55 points Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Alabama Coach Wimp Sanderson is in the Sweet 16 for the fifth time in his 10 
years as head coach there. 
</P>
<P>
Sanderson and Westhead are longtime friends, going back to the 1970s, when 
Westhead coached at La Salle and Sanderson was an assistant to C.M. Newton at 
Alabama. More recently, they have worked together in summer coaching clinics 
for a shoe company. Their families went to dinner together last weekend. 
Westhead calls Sanderson "a delightful guy." Poking fun at Sanderson's Southern 
accent, Westhead said they don't talk much basketball "because I don't really 
understand what he says." 
</P>
<P>
Sanderson calls Loyola "an unusual team." 
</P>
<P>
Alabama swingman Keith Askins, one of four players on the team averaging in 
double figures, said the Lions "seem not to get tired. It will be a hard job 
for our team to run up and down (the court) like that. The key is to be 
patient. I don't think you can outscore 'em. You've got to outsmart 'em. Get 
the oxygen tank ready." 
</P>
<P>
Westhead expects Sanderson to "try to play like he did against Arizona -- a lot 
of cross-court passes, then cut you up. They're a fine team that Wimp has right 
under his thumb -- when he says jump, they jump. They make the extra pass. 
They're a very athletic, physical, quick team. I think they will try to match 
up and play a game of control." 
</P>
<P>
And that, as Tom Asbury could tell you, is easier said than done. "Hell, if I 
had all the answers, I'd still be playing," he said.

<P>
Ninety-four feet and one second away from defeat, Connecticut hit a home run. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we had the game," said Clemson's Derrick Forrest. 
</P>
<P>
After 39 minutes and 59 seconds, they did. Then a length-of-the-court inbounds 
pass from Scott Burrell, a pitcher for the Huskies' baseball team, landed in 
Tate George's hands. 
</P>
<P>
"Shoot, shoot," screamed Connecticut Coach Jim Calhoun. 
</P>
<P>
In one motion, George spun around and drilled a 15-foot jumper as time ran out 
and the Huskies scored an improbable 71-70 East Regional victory Thursday night 
to move within one win of the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
As Connecticut players streamed onto the court, Calhoun jumped and clenched his 
fists while stunned Clemson players stood motionless. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson Coach Cliff Ellis put his hands on his hips and pursed his lips as 
George's shot dropped through the hoop with the buzzer sounding. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we tasted the thrill of victory and if you play long enough, the agony 
of defeat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Connecticut (31-5) will play Duke (27-8), a 90-81 winner over UCLA, in 
Saturday's regional final. 
</P>
<P>
How the Huskies got there was nothing short of miraculous. 
</P>
<P>
David Young's three-point basket with 11 seconds left had given upstart Clemson 
a 70-69 lead over the top-seeded Huskies. 
</P>
<P>
After George missed badly on a drive, Sean Tyson rebounded for Clemson and was 
fouled with 1.6 seconds left. But Tyson missed the first of a one-and-one free 
throw opportunity and Burrell called time out as he rebounded the ball. 
</P>
<P>
In the Connecticut sideline huddle, Calhoun told his team that it still had 
time. He diagramed an inbounds play that he calls "home run." George and Chris 
Smith took off from midcourt as Burrell threw over the outstretched hands of 
6-11 Clemson center Elden Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
George caught the ball with his back to the basket and Tyson closest to him. As 
George went up to shoot, Tyson leaned away to avoid a foul and George was not 
contested. 
</P>
<P>
"The surprising thing was when I turned, he backed off," George said. "In my 
head and in my heart, I wanted to stroke it as best I could. I lost vision of 
the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"But I heard the crowd roar and saw people on the court so I knew it went in." 
</P>
<P>
For Clemson, first-time champions of the Atlantic Coast Conference, it was a 
crushing end to a 26-9 season that featured a seven-point comeback victory over 
Brigham Young in the last three minutes and a 16-point comeback victory over La 
Salle in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies led, 67-53, with 6:53 left before Ellis called for a full-court 
press that enabled the Tigers to catch up in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson forced four consecutive turnovers and outscored Connecticut, 12-0, to 
get within 67-65 with 3:37 left. When Young's rainbow three-pointer fell 
through, the Tigers led for the first time since the opening minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that hurt us was their press and the thing that got them was our 
press," Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
On Connecticut's next possession, George drove from the top of the free throw 
line and missed badly. He would think about that missed shot one more time. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really upset because I realized for the first time my career was coming 
to an end," George said. "With one second left, it's kind of hard to put it in 
perspective." 
</P>
<P>
Burrell, who was a first-round draft pick of the Seattle Mariners but chose to 
stay at Connecticut, threw a perfect pass. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a pitcher and he threw a strike," Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
Television replays of the last play showed the ball had left George's hands 
before the buzzer sounded. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough, pretty tough," Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
George, who backed up Smith's 23 points with 12 of his own, hit nothing but net 
on his final shot. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a magnificent shot by a magnificent player," Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, Clemson proved to be strong inside with Campbell and 6-11 Dale 
Davis, who combined for 30 points and 25 rebounds. But the pressing Connecticut 
defense forced 20 turnovers and came up with one play for which there was no 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
Burrell's game-winning pass was his only assist of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Games are not 39 minutes and 59 seconds," Calhoun said. "Games are 40 minutes 
long."

A short while later, it was, as Duke played out a 90-81 victory before 19,502 
in an NCAA East Regional semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very good in the last four minutes," said Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski, 
whose team will advance to the Final Four for the fourth time in five years if 
it beats Connecticut Saturday in the final. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA was not good in the last four minutes, which is why the Bruins will board 
a plane this morning and head back to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA overcame a nine-point halftime deficit and twice took the lead, but down 
the stretch, Duke shut down the Bruins' offense and twice exposed the Bruins' 
most glaring weakness, interior defense. 
</P>
<P>
A three-point shot by Gerald Madkins pulled the Bruins to within 72-71 with 
5:04 left, but Duke's 6-foot freshman point guard, Bobby Hurley, then drove 
through the Bruin defense to score on a layup. 
</P>
<P>
As UCLA's next four possessions resulted in a turnover, a missed three-point 
shot, a missed three-point shot and a missed baseline jumper, Duke took control 
by working its offense for a layup by 6-10 center Alaa Abdelnaby and a drive 
from the top of the key by the 6-11 Laettner. 
</P>
<P>
Laettner's dunk gave the Blue Devils a 78-71 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as UCLA continued to fire up three-point shots, Duke made 10 of 12 free 
throws in the last 1:40 to keep the Bruins down. 
</P>
<P>
"They're very good defensively," UCLA Coach Jim Harrick said of the Blue 
Devils, declin-ing to question the Bruins' lack of offensive patience. 
"Sometimes, your offense takes what the defense gives it. And when they gave us 
an open shot, certainly we wanted to take it." 
</P>
<P>
Krzyzewski called the game "a struggle for us because we played an outstanding 
team." 
</P>
<P>
On this night, however, Duke was better, maintaining its composure even though 
Laettner and Abdelnaby both picked up their fourth fouls during a single UCLA 
possession, Laettner with 15:04 left and Abdelnaby with 14:55 left. 
</P>
<P>
Laettner only stayed out for a minute, returning to finish up a strong 
performance that included 24 points and 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were in a spot where we were going to lose the game," Krzyzewski 
said of his unusual strategy. "They had seized the momentum and we were really 
in disarray." 
</P>
<P>
Laettner, he said, "showed great concentration and discipline" in not picking 
up a disqualifying fifth foul. 
</P>
<P>
Duke (27-8) was led by guard Phil Henderson, who scored 28 points, including 16 
in the second half, when he made six of nine shots, including four of five from 
beyond the three-point line. 
</P>
<P>
Abdelnaby scored 14 points and Hurley had 12 points and nine assists. 
</P>
<P>
MacLean led UCLA (22-11) with 21 points and 15 rebounds, making nine of 17 
shots after making only 14 of 45 in the Bruins' previous four games. 
</P>
<P>
"MacLean had a sensational game," Krzyzewski said. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Madkins scored 17 points and had six assists for the Bruins, making five 
of six shots. Trevor Wilson scored 16 points but made only five of 18 shots, 
and Tracy Murray had 15 points and nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
In its first appearance in the Sweet 16 since 1980, UCLA was seen by most as an 
underdog against Duke. "A Loss is 'Bruin' for UCLA," read the message taped 
around the head of the Blue Devils' mascot. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA didn't see it that way. 
</P>
<P>
"I see it as an even game," Harrick had said this week. 
</P>
<P>
And it was from the start as the Bruins burned the highly regarded Duke defense 
for layups in four of their first five possessions. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA trailed 16-15 after Wilson made two free throws with 12:19 left, but with 
Wilson on the bench for a rest, the Blue Devils then outscored the Bruins, 5-0, 
getting a basket from Laettner, a free throw from Bill McCaffrey and two free 
throws from Hurley. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after Wilson returned and committed a loose-ball foul, Henderson made a 
three-point shot to give Duke a 24-15 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Duke stretched its lead to 39-28 on a pair of free throws by Laettner with 
4:13, but UCLA then made a move with Hurley on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
A 9-2 run, including a three-point shot by Madkins, a short jumper by Murray 
and layups by MacLean and Martin, pulled the Bruins to within 41-37, but with 
Hurley back in the game, Duke closed out the half with a 6-1 run to take a 
47-38 edge. 
</P>
<P>
Laettner, who made only one of 11 shots last weekend in Duke victories over 
Richmond and St. John's, made six of nine in the first 20 minutes against the 
Bruins, ending the half with 16 points and nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
MacLean also played a strong half, finishing with 13 points and seven rebounds 
and making five of nine shots.

SEASON WILL BE LONGER TO STAY 162 
</P>

<P>
Baseball will extend its regular season by three days to accommodate a complete 
schedule of 162 games, Commissioner Fay Vincent said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement, reached in cooperation with CBS, which holds television rights 
to the playoffs and the World Series, will force a delay in the start of those 
events. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent had announced a delay in the start of the regular season from April 2 
to April 9 because of the collective bargaining negotiations and 32-day lockout 
that ended Monday. 
</P>
<P>
He said at the time that the teams each would play 158 games and that an 
attempt would be made to have them play all 162. 
</P>
<P>
It is believed that baseball favored extending the season a full week to make 
up the postponed games of the opening week, but CBS, faced with extensive 
rescheduling problems, insisted on the compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the major objectives was to preserve the full 162-game schedule, and I 
am pleased that we have accomplished that," Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
"I thank CBS and the (Major League) Players Assn. for their cooperation in 
making this schedule adjustment possible." 
</P>
<P>
The National League playoffs will begin Oct. 4, instead of Oct. 2. The start of 
the American League playoffs was switched from Oct. 3 to Oct. 6. The World 
Series will begin Oct. 16 instead of Oct. 13. 
</P>
<P>
If the World Series goes seven games, it would end Oct. 24. Last year, after an 
11-day delay because of the Bay Area earthquake, the Oakland Athletics 
completed their four-game World Series sweep on Oct. 28. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent said that complete details of the rescheduling will be announced within 
the next few days. The three-day extension will permit the playing of three or 
four games, he said. Those games that cannot be made up during the extension 
will be made up on off days or as part of doubleheaders. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers, who would have lost a four-game series against the San Diego 
Padres and a three-game series against the San Francisco Giants, already have 
rescheduled one of the Padre games as their home opener on April 9. A club 
official speculated Thursday that the remaining three games of the San Diego 
series would be made up during the extension. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Port, the Angels' general manager, said the rescheduling was being handled 
by the respective league offices, and he expects to know details today. The 
Angels had a six-game trip to Seattle and Oakland scheduled in the first week. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of baseball and CBS said there were no changes in the financial 
terms of the four-year, $1.06-billion contract. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a significant number of issues that we had to look at," CBS Vice 
President Jeremy Handelman told the Associated Press. "We had to sift through 
that and work out a structure having the least adverse effect on us. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of planning and strategy was already laid in at a critical time of the 
year in the television industry, the start of a new season."

Texas guard Lance Blanks fired up nothing but his namesake in the first half of 
the Longhorns' NCAA Midwest Regional semifinal playoff game against Xavier. 
</P>
<P>
Blanks, who loves to talk as much as he loves to shoot, had a lot of explaining 
to do after missing all eight shots he took in the first half. He made just two 
free throws as the Longhorns fell behind by 12 points at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
But Blanks started hitting in the second half, scoring 26 of his 28 points to 
lead the Longhorns to a 102-89 victory Thursday night before 16,413 at Reunion 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Texas (24-8) will play Arkansas (29-4) -- a 96-73 winner over North Carolina in 
Thursday's other semifinal game here -- in the Midwest Regional final Saturday. 
It's the first time the much-maligned Southwest Conference has had two teams in 
the final eight. 
</P>
<P>
The Razorbacks have won five consecutive games from the Longhorns, including 
two this season. But Texas is anxious for a rematch. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all pulling for Arkansas in the first game, not because we wanted to 
play Arkansas but because of what it would mean for our conference," Texas 
Coach Tom Penders said. "Our kids feel like they have closed the gap on 
Arkansas a little bit. If we play really well, we have a chance to beat them. 
But we have to play 40 minutes of great basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Billed as "BMW, The Ultimate Scoring Machine," guards Blanks, Travis Mays and 
Joey Wright combined for 86 points as Texas came back from a 16-point deficit 
and won by 13. 
</P>
<P>
Mays had 32 points, 14 in the first half, and Wright added 26, 11 in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
"We said early on that we had one of the great backcourts in the country," 
Penders said. "All we needed was Dick Vitale to watch us a couple of times. 
Hopefully he was watching us tonight." 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't really get down on myself. I just told myself to pick it up. We 
weren't creating anything," Blanks said of his halftime regimen. "I just 
challenged myself mentally. I went to the locker room and didn't say a lot. I 
got real quiet and told myself that this next half might be the last of my 
career." 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 79-79, with 4:27 remaining, Texas outscored Xavier, 11-0. 
Blanks had seven points in the spurt and Mays added four. 
</P>
<P>
After trailing by 12 points at halftime, Texas shot 57.1%in the second half, 
hitting 20 of 35 shots. 
</P>
<P>
But Penders said the Longhorn defense made the difference. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the kids had a great second half," Penders said. "You look at Lance 
Blanks' numbers, Wright and Mays -- the whole gang -- but defense made the 
difference and our guys know that. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first half, they got the ball inside on us too easily. We weren't 
pressuring their passes. In the second half, I thought our guys created a lot 
of easy baskets. We had some guys in foul trouble. We let Xavier control the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
But the Longhorns controlled the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing by 16 points at the start of the second half, Texas blitzed Xavier, 
34-17, to take a 75-74 lead on Blanks' dunk with 9:06 left. Blanks had 13 
points as Texas ran away from the Musketeers. But Xavier came back to tie the 
score, 79-79, before the Longhorns pulled away for good. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Texas played a tremendous second half. We just couldn't stop them," 
Xavier Coach Pete Gillen said. "They got on a roll and it was like an avalanche 
coming down a mountain. We stopped playing and started 'spectating.' 
</P>
<P>
"All of sudden we hit a brick wall. They kept attacking the basket and we 
didn't have any answers for that. When we were in a zone, they went right by 
us. When we were in a man, they went right by us. We just couldn't move our 
feet at all." 
</P>
<P>
With Blanks misfiring, the Longhorns sputtered in the first half, shooting just 
39.4% and falling behind, 53-41, by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
"We played as well as we could in the first half," Gillen said. "We go up by 16 
and all of a sudden they became tremendously aggressive. We wanted success, 
they were desperate for it."

BRUINS: THEY COULDN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE WHEN DUKE'S BIG MEN GOT INTO FOUL TROUBLE.

<P>
It was a situation made to order for UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Five minutes into the second half, Duke's big men -- 6-11 Christian Laettner 
and 6-10 Alaa Abdelnaby -- each had four fouls. 
</P>
<P>
All season long, the Bruins were vulnerable to teams with tall inside players 
and here they were in the East Regional semifinal with their two principal 
tormentors on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Duke led, 52-50, with Laettner and Abdelnaby only one foul away from taking a 
seat on the bench for the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in trouble," Abdelnaby said. 
</P>
<P>
But in the ultimate twist to UCLA's NCAA tournament hopes, the Bruins failed to 
take advantage of the situation and the Blue Demons wrapped up a 90-81 victory 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, which beat relatively small Alabama Birmingham and Kansas, found itself 
lacking when they reduced Duke to a normal-sized team. 
</P>
<P>
Such irony was not lost on UCLA forward Don MacLean, who had 21 points and 15 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"That something like that would wind up beating us when that was our strongest 
point all year -- playing smaller lineups -- well, it's a funny game 
sometimes," MacLean said. 
</P>
<P>
When his inside game suddenly became smaller, Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski 
shuttled Laettner and Abdelnaby in and out of the lineup before finally using 
them both despite their fouls. 
</P>
<P>
At the four-foul juncture, Krzyzewski made an assessment. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were in a situation where we would lose the game," Krzyzewski 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And although it was Duke's backcourt of Phil Henderson and Bobby Hurley who 
assumed the offensive burden, neither of the Blue Devil big men were challenged 
inside as UCLA struggled to stay close. 
</P>
<P>
Laettner had 24 points and 14 rebounds in 32 minutes and Abdelnaby had 14 
points and seven rebounds in 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Abdelnaby was surprised he wasn't visited more often by UCLA's offense. 
</P>
<P>
"They should have forced the issue, but they didn't do it, thank goodness," 
Abdelnaby said. "They should have come to me and Christian a bit more and put 
us in a position to block a shot or make a spectacular play or foul." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Coach Jim Harrick downplayed the foul trouble of Laettner and Abdelnaby. 
He said their being burdened with four fouls was of no consequence. 
</P>
<P>
"That wasn't the difference," Harrick said. "The difference was Henderson made 
some shots and we missed." 
</P>
<P>
However, Trevor Wilson said the Bruins missed a rare opportunity with Duke's 
big players. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't do a good job of taking advantage of their fouls," Wilson said. "We 
didn't execute our offense like we normally do. But we had the shots. We just 
didn't hit them." 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins shot only 40.6% and MacLean blamed tired legs and a poorly 
constructed offense down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't get the ball inside," he said. "I don't know why. We kind of rushed 
our shots and tried to get the lead back as soon as we could. When the big guys 
went out, it's funny, but we didn't go to the boards the same way. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real late in the season and my legs are shot right now," MacLean said. 
"Maybe that's what happened. All I know is it's a funny game."

MIDWEST REGIONAL: RAZORBACK BOMBS BLOW AWAY NORTH CAROLINA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For three quarters of the game, Arkansas appeared ready to fall into the same 
trap that allowed North Carolina to knock Oklahoma out of the NCAA tournament. 
A plow horse pace, score in the 50s, the lead going back and forth. 
</P>
<P>
But the Razorbacks never thought it could happen to them. 
</P>
<P>
"We're kind of like a time bomb," Arkansas Coach Nolan Richardson said later. 
"Things go right, we kind of blow up." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, just when it seemed North Carolina might pull another tournament 
stunner, the Razorbacks started bombing. In fewer than three minutes, point 
guard Lee Mayberry buried three three-point shots, and forward Todd Day threw 
in another to push the Razorbacks to a 96-73 victory Thursday night and into 
the Midwest Regional final against Southwest Conference rival Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more than anything else, Arkansas, seeded No. 4 in the Midwest, forged 
its victory with its depth. The Razorbacks go nine deep with talented players, 
and the numbers were too much for North Carolina (21-13), seeded eighth. 
</P>
<P>
When sophomores Day and Mayberry got into first-half foul trouble, forward 
Lenzie Howell picked up the slack, scoring 15 points in the first 20 minutes 
and finishing with 25. 
</P>
<P>
With starting center Mario Credit also hampered by fouls, his backup, 6-foot-9, 
270-pound sophomore Oliver Miller, contributed 19 points, 15 in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina Coach Dean Smith said: "You'll see a lot of those guys some day 
in the NBA." 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, however, the Razorbacks (29-4) move into Saturday's 
regional final against Texas, which defeated Xavier, 102-89. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas beat the Longhorns twice during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
"We know exactly what Texas does," Howell said. "They have three great guards. 
We know how to play them well because we've played them so many times." 
</P>
<P>
Even with senior swingman Kevin Madden on the bench because of the knee injury 
he suffered earlier in the week in practice, the Tar Heels were able to stay 
with Arkansas early. In the first half, North Carolina built a 20-13 rebounding 
advantage over the smaller Razorbacks and trailed by five points at the 
intermission. 
</P>
<P>
Day, Arkansas' leading scorer, hit two three-pointers in the first 3:20 as his 
team took a seven-point lead. But he picked up his third foul less than two 
minutes later and spent the rest of the half on the bench. Mayberry wasn't much 
better, scoring eight points before getting his third foul with 2:19 left. 
</P>
<P>
Into the breach stepped Howell, a 6-5 senior from Dallas who has fought off 
personal problems to become a force for the Razorbacks in the tournament. He 
left the team at one point during the regular season because his father had 
lapsed into a coma. Howell was battling an eye infection last week. 
</P>
<P>
But he scored 23 points in Arkansas' second-round victory over Dayton and 
worked inside and out for his 25 against North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just like that Dayton game, when I had (16 points in the) first half 
and had to keep us in the game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Richardson: "Lenzie Howell kept us right there until Lee and Todd put 
their things together." 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina opened the second half with an 11-3 run to lead by three with 
16:51 left. With 10:44 left, the game was tied, 54-54, when the bomb went off. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Richardson went off -- in Mayberry's face -- first. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a timeout right before that," Richardson said. "I don't remember the 
exact time. But I jumped on Lee in the huddle because he was passing up the 
three-point shot." 
</P>
<P>
Mayberry's first three-pointer brought the Razorback crowd into the game for 
the first time. George Lynch made one of two free throws for Carolina, and then 
Mayberry buried another three-pointer. Day forced a turnover and followed with 
his three-pointer. After Carolina's Rick Fox missed a three-point try, Mayberry 
struck again. 
</P>
<P>
"They did get in foul trouble early," Smith said, "but that streak of 
three-point shots was hard to overcome." 
</P>
<P>
Fox's three-pointer brought the Tar Heels to within seven with 7:30 remaining, 
but they couldn't get any closer as the Razorbacks pushed the ball inside to 
Miller down the stretch.

NEVADA LAS VEGAS: DESPITE A BROKEN JAW, ANTHONY CONTINUES TO LEAD REBELS TOWARD 
FINAL FOUR.

<P>
Greg Anthony considers himself a politician, and as such he knows the value of 
words, both those spoken and those withheld. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Nevada Las Vegas' opponents can vouch for that. Anthony is known for a 
certain eloquence on the court, which has drawn him a number of technical 
fouls, including two committed even though his broken jaw was wired late in the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
He also has another way of making his opinions known -- by declining to 
comment, as he did throughout the regular season in response to articles in Las 
Vegas newspapers about the cars UNLV players drive. 
</P>
<P>
But as second-ranked UNLV (31-5) began the chase for a national championship 
that continues against Ball State (26-6) in a West Regional semifinal game 
tonight at the Oakland Coliseum Arena, Anthony has broken his silence, his 
point made. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any hard feelings," he said. "But it was a stance I took, and one 
I had to keep. I'm a man of my word." 
</P>
<P>
For a time late in the season, Anthony's refusal of interviews was more by 
force than choice. After breaking his jaw in two places in a fall, in a game 
against Fresno State on Feb. 12, his jaw was wired, as it still is for games. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors left the decision up to Anthony, who cried when he was told his jaw was 
broken. 
</P>
<P>
"When they said I might be able to play, I thought it was just to make me feel 
all right," he said. 
</P>
<P>
What they told him was that he could play if he could bear it. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would hurt more not to play," Anthony said. 
</P>
<P>
He has lost about 12 pounds, but he is playing, helping the Rebels press 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony, a junior point guard, is one of the more intriguing members of the 
UNLV team. He is an aspiring politician, a man from Las Vegas who hopes to 
become a Republican senator from Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
The party affiliation -- already he is vice chairman of the Nevada Young 
Republicans and has interned in Washington -- has been a point of contention in 
a family that was not traditionally Republican. 
</P>
<P>
"I caught a lot of flak," said Anthony, smiling. "I'm a Reagan Republican." 
</P>
<P>
But he is here this weekend to talk basketball, not politics. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV, seeded No. 1 in the West, must beat 12th-seeded Ball State and the winner 
of the game between seventh-seeded Alabama and 11th-seeded Loyola Marymount to 
reach the Final Four for the second time in four years. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels fell one game short last season, losing to Seton Hall in the West 
Regional final. 
</P>
<P>
"I told our kids that if our team stayed together, we had a chance to do 
something big," UNLV Coach Jerry Tarkanian said. "I never did identify what I 
meant by big, but I think the guys pretty much knew what I was talking about." 
</P>
<P>
He is talking about the NCAA title, the championship of an organization that 
UNLV does not particularly consider a friend, and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA has hung close by UNLV all season, suspending players for unpaid phone 
bills and an unrepaid student loan. NCAA investigators have made eight visits 
to the campus, and sometime after the Rebels' season ends, the NCAA is expected 
to say whether its preliminary inquiry will become a full-scale investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure they're not pulling for us," Tarkanian said last weekend. "I'm sure 
there's someone up there who would like to see me lose." 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
In Ball State, UNLV faces a team that used strong interior defense to beat 
Louisville, which had 7-foot center Felton Spencer. "I don't think they're the 
same as Spencer, because of his height and weight," said Curtis Kidd, who did 
most of the defensive work against Spencer. "This should be a little easier." 
UNLV Coach Jerry Tarkanian sees it differently: "One thing we have that maybe 
Louisville lacked is exceptional quickness inside." . . . Ball State Coach Dick 
Hunsaker invited alumnus David Letterman to join the team here but said 
Letterman declined, saying he would join them if the Cardinals reach the Final 
Four in Denver.

MIESZERSKI SELECTS FIRST SEVEN WINNERS ON CARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Times handicapper Bob Mieszerski had his hottest day of the Santa Anita meeting 
Thursday when he picked the first seven winners on the nine-race card before 
missing in the eighth race when his selection, Excellent Lady, ran third. 
</P>
<P>
Lap Of Luxury, his pick in the ninth, ran out of the money. 
</P>
<P>
Bob's winners were: Pop's Ruling ($4.80) in the first, Terrific Day ($24.20) in 
the second, Flom ($3.40) in the third, Rainbank ($5.20) in the fourth, 
Beautiful Melody ($4.60) in the fifth, Bond ($9.60) in the sixth and Sumthing 
Rare ($5.20) in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
A $2 bet on his selections in the Pick Six, which is made up of the second 
through the seventh races, would have returned $2,189.60.

HOUSEBUSTER WILL STICK TO SPRINTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Based on comparative times for the first half-mile, Housebuster would have been 
about 15 lengths ahead if he had run in the Florida Derby last Saturday at 
Gulfstream Park, instead of in the Swale Stakes on the same track about three 
hours before. 
</P>
<P>
It is unlikely that any of the Derby horses would have been able to catch 
Housebuster with a lead like that, no matter how much he might have slowed down 
in the remaining five-eighths of a mile. Unbridled, the winner of the Florida 
Derby, improved his position by five lengths in the stretch, but he did so not 
because of any rapid acceleration, but because the horses ahead of him were out 
of gas. He ran the last eighth of a mile in just under 13 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
In the seven-furlong Swale, Housebuster beat Summer Squall, who may become one 
of this season's best 3-year-olds, by only one length, but he actually won the 
race more comfortably than that. Craig Perret brought him to the wire under a 
hand ride, while Pat Day, aboard Summer Squall, hit his mount several times. 
</P>
<P>
"My horse was waiting on the other horses," Perret said. "And when they came to 
him, he took right off." 
</P>
<P>
As his trainer, Jimmy Croll, says, Housebuster has no right to be running 1 1/4 
miles -- the Kentucky Derby distance -- because sprinting is the colt's game. 
The odds are astronomical against Housebuster's running in the Kentucky Derby, 
and trainers who get to Churchill Downs on May 5 will breathe easier. A horse 
this fast could still be dangerous in Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
Housebuster is going to Kentucky and eventually Churchill Downs, but not to run 
in the Derby. The plan is to run him in the seven-furlong Lafayette at 
Keeneland on April 11 and in the one-mile Derby Trial on opening day at 
Churchill Downs, the Saturday before the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Croll is not fishing for a reason to consider the Derby. "If he wins the 
Trial," he said, "we'll all go out to dinner and celebrate. Then we'll ship him 
home to New Jersey (and Monmouth Park). To run him a mile and a quarter would 
be asinine." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Levy, the owner of Housebuster, also raced Bet Twice, who finished second 
to Alysheba in the 1987 Kentucky Derby and five weeks later won the Belmont, 
spoiling Alysheba's $5-million bid for the Triple Crown. Levy agrees with 
Croll's assessment of Housebuster's limitations and is an owner who seems 
immune to Derby fever. 
</P>
<P>
Croll said Housebuster is the best pure sprinter he has seen since Mr. 
Prospector, who was one of the fastest horses ever to race. 
</P>
<P>
Croll didn't have the control with Mr. Prospector that he apparently will have 
with Housebuster. As a yearling, Mr. Prospector broke the sales record at 
Keeneland, where Abraham (Butch) Savin, one of Croll's clients, bought him for 
$220,000. 
</P>
<P>
As a 3-year-old in 1973, Mr. Prospector won his first start by 12 lengths at 
Hialeah in Florida. Croll won the Florida Derby that year with Royal and Regal, 
but the talk at Gulfstream that day was about Mr. Prospector, who won the 
following race by 10 lengths in a time of 1:07 3/5, which is still the fastest 
six furlongs ever run at the track. 
</P>
<P>
Savin started thinking about the Kentucky Derby. "The horse had never been 
around two turns," Croll said. "I literally begged him not to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Croll was told that if he wouldn't prepare Mr. Prospector for the Derby, Savin 
would find a trainer who would. 
</P>
<P>
At Keeneland, Mr. Prospector ran in the 1 1/16-mile Calumet Purse and finished 
third, the first loss of his career. In the Derby Trial, which was then run 
four days before the Derby, Mr. Prospector finished second but chipped a bone 
in his ankle. He came back as a 4-year-old to set a six-furlong record at 
Garden State Park, but he was injured again and this time was retired, with a 
modest record that included purses of slightly more than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
At stud, Mr. Prospector has been a wonder. His offspring have earned more than 
$33 million, and besides siring three sprint champions -- Gold Beauty, Eillo 
and Gulch -- he has also accounted for Conquistador Cielo, a Belmont winner; 
Preakness winner Tank's Prospect, and Forty Niner, who won the Travers. 
Fappiano, a son of Mr. Prospector, is one of the top younger stallions. 
</P>
<P>
It was probably just as well that Mr. Prospector didn't make it to the Kentucky 
Derby for another reason: That was the year of Secretariat. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Stein's attorneys are protesting the appointment of Amanda Behe as the 
administrative law judge for a hearing in Los Angeles on April 17. 
</P>
<P>
Behe was the judge who ruled against Stein when the trainer's case first went 
before the California Horse Racing Board early last year. Six trainers were 
charged with running horses that tested positive for cocaine, and all but Stein 
were exonerated. Stein, who received a six-month suspension and a $2,000 fine, 
is suing the racing board and others for $25 million. Another trainer, Laz 
Barrera, is suing the state's testing laboratory for $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Amanda Behe has a special relationship with the racing board's staff," said 
Russell Iungerich, who represents Stein. "It is not part of her normal rotation 
that she be given this case again. We have asked her to remove herself from the 
case." 
</P>
<P>
Although only six horses are expected to run Sunday in the $300,000 San Luis 
Rey Stakes at Santa Anita, the 1 1/2-mile grass race is not an easy one to 
handicap. Included in the field will be Prized, who won the Arcadia Handicap in 
his last start; Hawkster, who set a world record for the San Luis Rey distance 
when he won the Oak Tree Invitational last fall, and Frankly Perfect, winner of 
the San Luis Obispo Handicap this season. 
</P>
<P>
El Senor, who hasn't run since finishing seventh in last November's Breeders' 
Cup Turf won by Prized, has shipped in from Gulfstream Park and is expected to 
stay for the San Juan Capistrano Handicap on April 22. Delegant and Just as 
Lucky are also expected to run Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Present Value will try to become the fourth California invader to win the 
Gulfstream Park Handicap when the $300,000 stake is run at 1 1/4 miles 
Saturday. Other California horses who won the race were Round Table in 1958, 
Pretense in 1967 and Snow Sporting in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jockey Kent Desormeaux won one and lost one this week. On Wednesday, the 
Maryland Racing Commission overruled its stewards and gave Desormeaux a victory 
that had been taken away via a disqualification in a small stake at Laurel last 
November. On Thursday, the stewards at Santa Anita handed Desormeaux a five-day 
suspension, which starts Sunday, for the interference ruling that disqualified 
Delight's Tribute after she finished first last Sunday. The Maryland ruling 
means Desormeaux's record for wins in one year is increased to 598. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Solis, who has never finished higher than 16th in the national money 
standings, ranks fourth with purses of $1.7 million. Three other California 
riders -- Gary Stevens, Chris McCarron and Eddie Delahoussaye -- are ahead of 
Solis. . . . Pat Day got the mount on Florida Derby winner Unbridled after 
Roger Velez suffered multiple pelvic injuries in a spill at Calder.

A Texas district judge awarded $1.6 million and a condominium to the common-law 
wife of New York Yankee outfielder Dave Winfield, who also was ordered to pay 
$3,500 monthly for child support. 
</P>
<P>
In June, a jury found that Winfield's relationship with flight attendant Sandra 
Renfro from 1982 to 1985 constituted a common-law marriage. Winfield said he 
never intended to marry Renfro and will appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Winfield married Tonya Turner in a legal ceremony two years ago. Renfro sought 
about $2.5 million from Winfield in child support for their 7-year-old 
daughter, Lauren Shanel.

TWO O.C. CONGRESSMEN WIN GENEROUS PRAISE FROM TAXPAYER GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WASHINGTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reps. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) and Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) were 
among seven California congressmen singled out for praise by the National 
Taxpayers Union on Thursday for casting votes against increased federal 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
Nine members of California's congressional delegation were classified as "big 
spenders" and seven as "taxpayers' friends" in the group's 17th-annual rating, 
based on recorded votes to reduce or increase government spending on national 
defense and social programs. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer ranked second among all House members on the NTU's list of low 
spenders, with a 72% favorable rating. Rohrabacher, whose district includes 
part of Orange County, had a 60% rating. 
</P>
<P>
California lawmakers on the NTU's spenders list were led by Reps. Glenn M. 
Anderson (D-Harbor City) and Mervyn M. Dymally (D-Compton), both with 26% 
favorable ratings. Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) also made the roster with a 
32% rating. 
</P>
<P>
"The big spenders in Congress are so out of touch with the majority of 
Americans who oppose higher taxes and spending that they are taking a 'let them 
eat cake' attitude toward American taxpayers," said NTU Chairman James Davidson 
at a Capitol press conference. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston, however, disputed the group's characterization of his voting record. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not have time now to analyze each of the 18 votes that the National 
Taxpayers Union objects to," Cranston said in a statement. "But I did take time 
to check the three votes they considered the worst and gave a negative 'vote 
weight' of 10. All three dealt with catastrophic insurance care reform, and in 
each case, I voted to retain many of the Medicare catastrophic benefits while 
repealing or reducing the premium surtax." 
</P>
<P>
The National Taxpayers Union "thinks those were three of my worst votes," 
Cranston said. "I think they were three of my best, and I'm proud of them."

WOMAN TALKED OF KILLING FAMILY, SELF, FRIENDS SAY

Roxanne Jones, the Reseda woman who shot her three children to death as they 
slept and then turned the gun on herself, talked of killing herself and taking 
her children with her for as long as two months before carrying out the threat, 
police and acquaintances said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
None of those who heard her discuss suicide took her seriously enough to 
contact authorities or to steer her toward counseling. 
</P>
<P>
Some hints that she was suicidal went unrecognized, apparently misinterpreted 
as part of her fervent new religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks before the tragedy, Jones' 7-year-old son, Jeremiah, told his 
first-grade teacher that his mother was taking him to "a good place, where God 
is, and there are no worries." But the teacher took that to mean a religious 
retreat. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of Jones, 32, daughters Brandy Fernandez, 15, and Leticia Fernandez, 
13, and Jeremiah were found Wednesday afternoon in the family's small house on 
Tampa Avenue in Reseda. Los Angeles police said Jones had shot the children 
while they slept Tuesday morning, then turned the .22-caliber rifle on herself. 
The family dog was also shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, who separated four months ago from her husband, Jeff Jones, 31, left 
behind a five-page suicide note in which she asked for God's forgiveness and 
outlined the family and financial problems that burdened her, police said. They 
said that Jones had previously told several friends and relatives that she was 
contemplating suicide.

MALATHION OPPONENTS SAY TOURISTS ARE UNAWARE OF SPRAYING DANGER 
</P>

<P>
In their latest attack against spraying for the Medfly, Orange County malathion 
opponents are turning their attention to tourists who may have found themselves 
unwittingly exposed to the Southland's raging Mediterranean fruit fly war. 
</P>
<P>
Local activists opposed to aerial spraying conducted an informal phone sampling 
and say they found that "the vast majority" of hotels contacted in Orange 
County's spray zones did not let guests know that they would be hit with 
malathion and might want to stay indoors, cover their cars and take other 
precautions. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the manager of one Anaheim hotel told The Times: "The guests don't ask 
us (about the spraying), so we don't tell them." 
</P>
<P>
The anti-malathion activists are now demanding that the state force hotels in 
the spray zones to notify their guests about upcoming dousings out of concern 
for health and property. Hotels currently are under no legal obligation to do 
so. 
</P>
<P>
The activists are firing off their latest salvo today during a press conference 
in front of the Anaheim Convention Center, with state Assemblyman Curt Pringle 
(R-Garden Grove), Orange County Supervisor Roger R. Stanton and several local 
city council members. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove resident Robert Taylor, an organizer of local anti-malathion 
activists, said the apparent failure of many hotels to notify guests about the 
malathion campaign could leave the guests and their cars in danger. 
</P>
<P>
State officials, in quarantining massive areas around Medfly finds, have said 
that the insect has probably spread through the careless transportation of 
infested fruit from one area to another. But Taylor said that if tourists are 
not told about the fly problem and the response to it, they may unknowingly 
take contaminated fruit in and out of the area. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle, in urging the state to keep its tourists better informed, said in an 
interview Thursday that "the entire Medfly notification process is faulty, and 
the problem with the hotels and motels is a part of that." 
</P>
<P>
But state officials showed no inclination to yield to their critics' demands. 
</P>
<P>
Gera Curry, spokeswoman for the Department of Food and Agriculture, said she 
sees no need for the state to require, or even encourage hotels and motels to 
notify their guests about the sprayings and the precautions that they can take. 
</P>
<P>
"If the motel people want" to notify guests, Curry added, "that's up to them. 
But if they have no problem with it, why should we throw out problems for them? 
. . . " Ann Hoffman, director of tourism development for the Anaheim Visitor 
and Convention Bureau, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at several of the larger hotels in the spray zones said they have 
adopted a policy of notifying guests of the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, state agriculture officials Thursday signed regulations that would 
give the state permanent authority to quarantine and use pesticides to fight 
the Medfly.

3 LATINOS IN POLL SUIT SUPPORT YUDELSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Republican Curt Pringle defeated Democrat Rick Thierbach in a close race 
for the 72nd Assembly District seat two years ago, the victory was marred by 
the Republican Party's use of security guards at polling places in Latino 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
That incident promises to remain a focal point in this year's race as well. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Garden Grove businessman Jerry Yudelson, one of two candidates for 
the Democratic nomination in the 72nd District race, said at a news conference 
that he has the support of many of the district's Latino leaders, including 
three plaintiffs in a now-settled lawsuit stemming from the poll guards 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
The three plaintiffs -- Tom and Helen Canales and Santa Ana Police Officer Jose 
Vargas -- appeared with Yudelson, along with Zeke Hernandez, leader of the 
local chapter of the League of United Latin-American Citizens, Sam Romero, a 
longtime Latino community activist, and Wally Davis, an attorney and lifelong 
Santa Ana resident. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of feel like Jerry is the little guy's candidate," Romero said. "I've 
seen him everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Yudelson said he has met with Latino groups in the 72nd District on about 40 
occasions in the past year and has the support of "80% to 90% of the 
leadership" of that community. 
</P>
<P>
Yudelson, favored by county Democratic Party Chairman Michael Balmages, 
produced a list of about 20 well-known Latinos who are backing him over his 
opponent, former Assistant U.S. Atty. Tom Umberg. Umberg is supported by many 
past Democratic Party leaders and major contributors, who have been at odds 
with Balmages over his leadership style. 
</P>
<P>
Umberg's campaign manager, Bob Stiens, said the campaign would release a list 
of endorsements in a week or two. 
</P>
<P>
In the first campaign disclosure statements filed since nominations closed 
earlier this month, Umberg on Thursday reported $36,000 in contributions, with 
$26,000 unspent. Pringle reported contributions of $160,494, while Yudelson 
said he met Thursday's postmark deadline but refused to disclose his campaign 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't want the numbers to get lost in the shuffle," Yudelson said. "We 
have our story that we wanted to put out today, which was the endorsement of me 
by the Hispanic leaders." 
</P>
<P>
One Latino claimed by Yudelson as a supporter said Thursday that he recently 
changed his mind and is now supporting Umberg. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't even told Jerry," said Emilio de la Cruz, an outreach coordinator at 
Coastline College. "It's not that I think anything less of him. But I've known 
Tom for some time. . . . We're both military men, and I told (Umberg) that I'd 
be glad to support him." 
</P>
<P>
At least two other prominent Santa Ana Latinos also support Umberg -- Santa Ana 
City Councilman Miguel A. Pulido Jr. and downtown businessman Rueben Martinez, 
a former Democratic Party treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
Both Pulido and Martinez were recently voted out of the county Democratic 
Party's Central Committee after they missed at least three monthly meetings in 
succession. 
</P>
<P>
Balmages said that the expulsions had "absolutely nothing to do" with the 
pair's support of Umberg. 
</P>
<P>
Pulido, whose council meetings are held at the same time as the Central 
Committee meetings, downplayed the significance of the vote to oust him and 
Martinez, but said it probably was related to their support of Umberg. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said being voted out of the Central Committee was "a burden off my 
back," but he also lamented the party infighting. 
</P>
<P>
"It goes on and on and on," Martinez said. "Meantime, Curt Pringle is getting 
stronger and stronger." 
</P>
<P>
However, Amin David, one of Yudelson's Latino supporters, said he did not think 
the split would hurt the party's chances of unseating Pringle. 
</P>
<P>
"Our hope is that two major guns attack Pringle, and that's the way it's been 
lately," David said. BOB SCHWARTZ

OLD IRVINE HOUSE MAY GET NEW HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON TEEBOOM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The house that James Harvey Irvine Jr. built more than 50 years ago may be 
spared the wrecking ball under the terms of a tentative agreement reached this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The ranch house, torn apart by vandals and littered with broken glass, was 
scheduled to be demolished along with one other home in the area to make way 
for an expansion of Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
But the Irvine Ranch Water District tentatively agreed this week to give the 
houses a home. Under the agreement, the Irvine Co. is slated to pay half the 
estimated $37,000 moving costs, and the city of Irvine and the water district 
will split the other half. 
</P>
<P>
"We saved the houses from destruction," said Ranch District President Peer A. 
Swan. 
</P>
<P>
Water district officials have not yet decided on a location for the two houses, 
Swan said. However, the district plans to refurbish the homes and allow 
employees to move in. The homes are scheduled to be moved by April 15, Swan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's an excellent use for them," said Irvine Historical Society President Ed 
Portmann about the houses. "It allows them to be renovated, and ensures their 
upkeep. That's what has been lacking in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Portmann emphasized that details of the agreement are still being worked out. 
He also said the relocation of the houses onto district property is only an 
"interim" solution, adding that the homes may end up being moved again. 
</P>
<P>
"This agreement is a win-win situation for everyone," said Kathleen Campini, 
Irvine Co. spokeswoman. LEON TEEBOOM

<P>
BURGLAR SENTENCED IN 2 JEWELRY THEFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who pleaded guilty to stealing jewelry from posh Newport Beach homes by 
posing as a utility repairman, complete with a truck containing a "cherry 
picker" basket, has been sentenced to 24 years in state prison, authorities 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Principato, 37, of Venice pleaded guilty Wednesday in Orange County 
Superior Court to two counts of residential burglary and one count of attempted 
burglary in Newport Beach, Deputy Dist. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Odwald said. 
</P>
<P>
Principato owned a green-and-white utility-style truck with a mechanized 
attachment commonly used to reach wires strung on power poles. He would knock 
on doors and tell the housekeeper or occupant that he was scheduled to repair 
either cable television or electrical wires, Odwald said. 
</P>
<P>
Once Principato gained entry, Odwald said, "he would usually secret himself in 
a bedroom" and steal jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities recovered jewelry worth $42,000 from Principato's truck and 
clothing, Odwald said. 
</P>
<P>
Principato was arrested June 9 by Newport Beach police.

<P>
BALLOT ARGUMENT ORDERED REWRITTEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM McQUEENEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A residents' group won a legal victory Thursday when a Superior Court 
commissioner agreed that Fullerton's city attorney wrote a flawed summary of 
the group's proposed ballot measure aimed at halting the widening of roads. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. R.K. (Kerry) Fox must rewrite the summary and remove wording that 
seems to argue against the initiative and that includes information not 
contained in the measure, Commissioner Ronald L. Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council will consider appealing the ruling when it meets April 3. 
</P>
<P>
Bauer's ruling provides the first victory to a group of residents calling 
themselves Save Our Bastanchury. The group has been fighting since last summer 
to stop proposed road-improvement projects in the city, which they fear will 
bring more traffic and noise to their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased with the ruling," said Mary B. Homme, president of the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
Homme and other group members have been struggling with the City Council to 
stop the widening of Bastanchury Road and Euclid Street in the city. A one-mile 
stretch of Bastanchury behind Homme's house is scheduled to be widened in 1991 
from four lanes to six. Improvements to a portion of Euclid is slated for later 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
At issue Thursday was a four-paragraph summary Fox wrote of the group's ballot 
measure. The measure, which needs about 6,000 signatures to qualify for the 
ballot, would halt nearly any city road improvement that would cause traffic 
noise to rise above limits set out in the city's general plan. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic on several stretches of Bastanchury and most other large streets in 
Fullerton already exceeds that level, city officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
Fox's summary, which must appear at the top of petitions circulated to qualify 
the measure for the ballot, concludes that "the practical effect of the 
initiative would be to prevent the city from improving traffic circulation and 
safety on a number of existing arterial streets and highways." 
</P>
<P>
Straying from summarizing the measure and delving into its possible effects is 
not Fox's responsibility, Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that's a summary of the petition," he said. "It's an argument." 
</P>
<P>
Fox's summary probably "would cause a lot of people to vote against this 
initiative when they learn this information," he said. "But they shouldn't 
learn it here." TOM McQUEENEY

BID TO CURB ERRANT GOLF BALLS ENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A controversial attempt to reduce the number of golf balls battering a row of 
homes next to the San Clemente Municipal Golf Course was scuttled Wednesday by 
the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing ribbons emblazoned with the single word, golfer, about 20 golfing 
enthusiasts applauded the council's decision not to renew an experiment that 
had reversed the direction of play on two holes across the street from the 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the council unanimously approved a $9,500 plan to install trees and 
sand traps in an effort to encourage golfers to aim away from homes on Avenida 
Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
Although some homeowners said the number of balls striking their homes and cars 
dropped dramatically during the experiment, the altered holes merely shifted 
the problem to another set of houses farther down the street, the council 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Golfers complained bitterly during the 30-day trial, claiming that the changes 
made the holes more difficult to play. 
</P>
<P>
Two sand traps and several trees will be dug into the right side of the 
fairway, which is separated from the homes by a narrow street. 
</P>
<P>
After a 90-day trial, the council will review the situation to see if the 
latest measures reduce the number of errant balls. 
</P>
<P>
The council also directed city staff to look into the cost of erecting a 30- to 
50-foot fence along the street. That option has been strongly opposed by the 
homeowners, who say the fence would destroy the panoramic ocean view from their 
front yards. FRANK MESSINA

TWO LANES OF ALISO CREEK ROAD OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aliso Creek Road, a new street linking El Toro Road with Alicia Parkway in 
Laguna Niguel, is open. 
</P>
<P>
Two lanes of the 4 1/2-mile-long road that winds through Laguna Niguel and 
Aliso Viejo were opened last week, said Tom Mathews, a spokesman for County 
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley said. An expansion of the road to include additional 
lanes will be completed in May, Mathews said. 
</P>
<P>
Aliso Creek Road is being built at a cost of $13.3 million under a development 
agreement between the county and the Mission Viejo Co. The road is part of the 
$120-million Aliso Viejo Development Agreement approved by the Board of 
Supervisors in 1987.

CANDIDATES REPORT ON FUND RAISING

<TEXT>
<P>
Candidate Peter von Elten had the largest bankroll in a field of five 
Republicans seeking the nomination to replace retiring Assemblyman Dennis Brown 
in the 58th Assembly District, according to financial-disclosure statements 
filed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Von Elten's campaign showed a total of $65,197 raised so far. Huntington Beach 
Mayor Thomas J. Mays was the only other candidate who reported any money raised 
since Brown's surprise announcement March 5 that he would not seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Mays campaign had about $30,000, with $22,000 of that transferred from his 
mayoral campaign account. 
</P>
<P>
The 58th Assembly District straddles the boundary between Los Angeles and 
Orange counties and includes Huntington Beach, Seal Beach and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The other Republican candidates are Seymour Alban, a physician from Long Beach, 
and Long Beach City Council members Jan Hall and Jeffrey A. Kellogg. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic candidate Joel R. Bishop said Thursday that he has decided to drop 
out of the race. One other Democrat remains, Luanne W. Pryor, a public 
relations consultant from Long Beach. And there is one Libertarian candidate, 
Scott Stier of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In other campaigns, Republican Assembly candidate Phyllis Badham reported that 
she has $4,207 in cash after raising $16,129 to challenge incumbent Assemblyman 
Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) in the 70th Assembly District. Ferguson's office 
declined to provide his report. 
</P>
<P>
In the Orange County district attorney's race, incumbent Michael R. Capizzi 
reported that he has raised $70,479. The statements from the other district 
attorney candidates were not available. The other candidates are James G. 
Enright, Orange County's chief deputy district attorney, Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Thomas Avdeef and Assistant Dist. Atty. Edgar A. Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
In the sheriff's race, incumbent Brad Gates reported that he has raised a total 
of $95,585. He is being challenged by retired Fullerton police captain Don 
Bankhead, whose campaign report was not available. DAVE LESHER

Blood-stained surgical clothing, blankets and bandages were strewn along a 
one-mile stretch of the San Gabriel River Freeway on Thursday when two boxes 
fell off a passing truck and broke apart, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
Contents of the boxes were scattered by wind and passing traffic between 
Katella Avenue and the San Diego Freeway, said CHP Officer Lyle Whitten. 
</P>
<P>
A private cleanup firm, American Environmental Management Corp., was called in 
by Caltrans officials to remove debris from the 9:30 a.m. incident. County 
public health officials said the items posed no danger to passing motorists, 
Whitten said. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP is investigating the origin of the boxes.

CSUF FACULTY TO STUDY OFFER ON LEADER SEARCH; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: CAL STATE'S ACADEMIC SENATE HAD THREATENED TO PULL ITS MEMBERS FROM 
THE PRESIDENTIAL SEARCH COMMITTEE BECAUSE OF BEING DENIED A MAJOR ROLE IN 
SCREENING CANDIDATES.

California State University trustees offered a last-minute compromise Thursday 
that persuaded the Cal State Fullerton Academic Senate to reconsider its threat 
to pull faculty members from a presidential search committee unless they were 
given a greater role in screening candidates. 
</P>
<P>
In a surprise visit to the 45-member senate, Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds, 
trustee and search committee chairman William D. Campbell and CSU Vice 
Chancellor Caesar Naples offered to give faculty members on the committee 
complete access to the results of background checks and guaranteed them the 
opportunity to request additional checks. 
</P>
<P>
The Academic Senate met Thursday to vote on the issue but postponed it until 
Tuesday after Reynolds and the others made their offer. 
</P>
<P>
"We would receive all the background checks together as a group," Campbell told 
the senate. But he stopped short of meeting a request from faculty members that 
they be allowed to help conduct background checks. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Academic senate passed a resolution to recall its three 
committee members if Reynolds failed to give a "positive response" to its 
demand to participate in background checks. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, faculty members are allowed to participate in discussions when the 
field of applicants is narrowed down to three or four finalists. Only the five 
trustee members on the committee have a vote, and they present their 
recommendations to the entire Board of Trustees, which has the final say. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds responded on Monday to the faculty members' resolution, saying that it 
was unlikely that the Board of Trustees would change its policy and allow them 
to participate in the checks because "the existing process has worked well." 
</P>
<P>
Acting on her response, the senate's executive committee recommended on 
Wednesday that the full body go ahead and recall the members, an action that 
some faculty members said would undermine efforts to find a replacement for 
retiring President Jewel Plummer Cobb. 
</P>
<P>
Although the offer falls short of the senate's original resolution, some 
faculty members were happy that they had at least won a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a movement," John J. Bedell, chairman of the Academic Senate and a member 
of the selection committee, said after the meeting. "It's not what the faculty 
wants, but it's a movement." 
</P>
<P>
Elementary education professor Carol Barnes, another member of the search 
committee, told the senate that perhaps the latest offer "is the wiggle room we 
are looking for." 
</P>
<P>
Many members of the senate were cautious about the offer, and they successfully 
argued that they should study it over the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
The senate also had sought a say in the final recommendation of a candidate 
before the selection is submitted to the Board of Trustees for approval. 
Campbell said they would be allowed to submit their comments after the three or 
four finalists visit the campus in May. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Fullerton Mayor A. B. (Buck) Catlin met with several CSU trustees to 
argue for some city role in the selection process, saying that the city has an 
interest in the new president, given the number of joint projects it has with 
the university.

ANAHEIM HILLS SHOPPING HUB OKD

<TEXT>
<P>
Plans for the east Anaheim Hills' largest shopping center have been approved 
and will include four shopping complexes, a business center and hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council approved the project, 4 to 0, Tuesday night after a public 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the Anaheim Hills Festival, planned for 85 undeveloped acres at 
the southwest corner of Santa Ana Canyon and Roosevelt roads, will begin this 
summer. Developers hope to complete it by the fall of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The $100-million project will offer Anaheim Hills residents convenient shopping 
and the city an estimated $2 million in annual sales tax revenues, said Bradley 
A. Geier of the Trammel Crow Co., which is developing the area. 
</P>
<P>
One resident spoke at Tuesday's public hearing about concerns with some parts 
of the plan, such as rooftop equipment and 24-hour security. 
</P>
<P>
But Patrick Pepper, chairman of the Anaheim Hills Citizens Coalition, told the 
council that his group approved of the project. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a welcome addition to the East Hills area and will definitely be an 
asset to our community," Pepper said.

SHOOTING: THE LAKEWOOD RESIDENT TAKES HIS OWN LIFE WHEN POLICE SHOW UP AT HIS 
HOME TO QUESTION HIM IN THE STRANGULATION OF A LAGUNA HILLS WOMAN, OFFICIALS 
SAY.

<P>
A Lakewood man shot and killed himself early Thursday as officers appeared at 
his front door to question him about a woman who was strangled and dumped in 
Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old man, whose identity had not been released late Thursday pending 
notification of relatives, was to be questioned because investigators had 
discovered that he was either renting or in the process of renting a room in 
his home to the woman, said Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Richard J. Olson. 
</P>
<P>
Olson said sheriff's investigators were following up on their homicide 
investigation and had not classified the Lakewood man as a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys just knocked on the door and 'bang' -- that was it," Olson said. 
"We're just as surprised as everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
The body of the woman, whose identity was not revealed Thursday, was discovered 
about 3 a.m Wednesday by Leisure World security officers behind the Laguna 
Hills Commercial Center in the 23000 block of Ridge Route Drive. The woman, 
fully clothed, apparently had been killed elsewhere and her body dumped, Olson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy performed Wednesday determined that she had been strangled. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have tentatively identified the woman through her fingerprints, 
but Olson added that her relatives have not yet been notified of her death. 
</P>
<P>
Olson said two detectives assigned the murder investigation went to the 11700 
block of East 215th Street in Lakewood at about 3:30 a.m. Thursday to question 
a man living at a rental house there. When they knocked on the door and 
received no answer, Olson said, the investigators returned to their car and 
called the man on their cellular telephone. They told him they wished to speak 
with him about the woman. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators then returned to the front door and, as they were knocking, 
heard a single gunshot from within, Olson said. The investigators called the 
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which determined that the man died of 
a gunshot wound to the head. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Birl Adams said his department was 
investigating only the man's death. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors in Lakewood were perplexed about what had happened. Those interviewed 
said they knew little about the man or anyone else who had been living at the 
40-year-old stucco house he apparently rented. 
</P>
<P>
At the scene late Thursday morning, a Los Angeles County coroner's van remained 
parked in the driveway as Orange County sheriff's investigators sifted through 
the property for clues. As part of their investigation, a van and a junked car 
parked on the property were towed to a police impound yard.

GIRL WAS STRANGLED, CORONER SAYS; 
</P>

CRIME: TOXICOLOGICAL TESTS ARE ALSO PLANNED IN DEATH OF CYPRESS TEEN-AGER. 
INVESTIGATORS SAY THERE ARE NO SUBSTANTIVE LEADS.

Zuleima Valdez, the 16-year-old Cypress girl whose body was found near a flood 
control channel in Lakewood, died by strangulation, according to preliminary 
autopsy results released Thursday by the Los Angeles County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Dambacher, a coroner's office spokesman, said routine toxicological tests 
will be conducted to determine if the girl was given any substances, such as 
drugs, before she was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Results of the autopsy will be turned over to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department crime lab. 
</P>
<P>
Dambacher said he could not comment on the time of death or whether the girl's 
attacker used any type of implement to strangle her. 
</P>
<P>
"The cause of death has been established as strangulation, and it is a 
homicide," Dambacher said. "That's all we've got to say." 
</P>
<P>
Zuleima, a freshman at Cypress High School, left home Sunday night after 
telling her mother, Bertha Velasquez, that she was getting a ride to the beach 
with friends. When Zuleima failed to return home, Velasquez reported her 
missing to police. 
</P>
<P>
Zuleima's fully clothed body was discovered at 5:45 p.m. Monday by teen-agers 
riding bicycles next to a paved path along the Coyote Creek flood control 
channel not far from the mobile home Zuleima shared with her mother. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department investigators previously had said the 
body, which showed no obvious signs of trauma, was partially covered with pine 
needles, leading them to suspect that someone may have tried to hide it. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Sheriff's Department has received a number of tips on the girl's 
death, no substantive leads had been developed, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
A Mass for Zuleima will be celebrated Monday at 10 a.m. at St. Irenaeus 
Catholic Church in Cypress, followed by the burial service. A viewing is 
scheduled all day Saturday at Forest Lawn Memorial-Park in Cypress, with a 
vigil on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Donations to help Zuleima's family offset burial costs may be made in Zuleima's 
name at Cypress High School, 9801 Valley View St., Cypress, Calif. 90630, or 
Lincoln Center Mobile Home Park, 9080 Bloomfield St., Cypress, Calif. 90630. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's investigators ask that anyone with information on the murder call the 
Cypress Police Department at (714) 229-6600 or the sheriff's homicide division 
at (213) 974-4341.

BUENA PARK'S SUNDARA HAS DONE HER HOMEWORK

Orange County girls' badminton players beware: Noy Sundara is watching. 
</P>
<P>
Sundara, a junior at Buena Park High School, is expected to be the top girls' 
player in the county this season, several coaches said. 
</P>
<P>
Her strength is studying opponents, discovering their weaknesses and using them 
to her advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"I played at the Garden Grove tournament and I saw a lot of players," said 
Sundara, who also is playing No. 1 mixed doubles. "I watched them and saw their 
weaknesses so when I play them I can beat them." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, Sundara has a keen eye. She opened the season by winning No. 1 
singles at the Garden Grove tournament on March 2 and is 12-0 for the Coyotes, 
the defending 4-A Southern Section champions. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park Coach Michelle Tafoya said she considers Sundara the favorite to win 
the Southern Section singles title this season. Tafoya, in her second season as 
head coach, should be an accurate judge. She played badminton at Buena Park 
before graduating in 1976, and she sometimes works out against Sundara in 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
"She's really strong and her shots are very accurate," Tafoya said. "I played 
her the other day and her shots were always in. You'd think they were out, but 
they were in. She knows just where to place the bird." 
</P>
<P>
Sundara's accuracy is trouble for opponents. Sundara, 17, said she wears down 
opponents during matches. 
</P>
<P>
"I make them run a lot," she said. "I get them in the back (of the court), 
usually with two shots. Then I use a drop shot. I make them tired. They quit. 
They won't run." 
</P>
<P>
Sundara makes beating other top players sound simple, but two years ago she was 
struggling to learn the game. As a freshman, she played No. 2 singles for the 
junior varsity. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a freshman, I didn't know how to play badminton," said Sundara, who 
was introduced to the sport by two cousins. "Everyone was telling me, 'Do this, 
do that.' I was running all around trying to listen to everybody. I didn't know 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Sundara did not make a good first impression on Tafoya. Then an assistant 
coach, Tafoya said she "didn't really notice Noy as a freshman." 
</P>
<P>
The summer following her freshman season, however, Sundara played in eight 
tournaments and often practiced against older, more-experienced players. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Tafoya and opponents couldn't help but notice Sundara as a 
sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
She moved to No. 1 singles, reached the semifinals of the Southern Section 
tournament and finished the season with a 59-5 record. She was the second-team 
girls' singles player on The Times' all-county badminton team. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, you'll get new kids and they look really good but they stay on that 
plateau," Tafoya said. "Her skills kept on improving. She really improved from 
a freshman to a sophomore." 
</P>
<P>
The improvement came as no surprise to Scott Lee, Sundara's mixed doubles 
partner this season. 
</P>
<P>
"She was just an extra as a freshman, but we knew she was a good athlete," Lee 
said. "She got a lot better her sophomore year and started beating everybody. 
She anticipates real well and she's smart." 
</P>
<P>
Sundara said her backhand is her greatest weakness. Confidence, though, is no 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy with my play this year," she said. "I think I can win CIF. I 
think I can go undefeated." 
</P>

KNOTT'S, MAGIC MOUNTAIN BUILD MORE THRILLS

Knott's Berry Farm promises that its newest attraction will elicit "the primal 
scream" from thrill seekers, while Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia vows to 
provide "the most frightening ride on earth!" 
</P>
<P>
Behold, the battle of the monster roller coasters. 
</P>
<P>
Early next month, both amusement parks will unveil their latest roller coasters 
in announcements timed to coincide with the beginning of spring breaks for 
California schools. 
</P>
<P>
Trainloads of euphoric riders will swoop through upside-down turns and twists 
at freeway speeds, coupled with gravitational pulls strong enough to impress a 
fighter pilot. 
</P>
<P>
The new, multimillion-dollar offerings at two of Southern California's 
best-known theme parks are the latest evidence that the roller coaster is 
making an impressive comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen new roller coasters are expected to open around the country this year, 
more than in any year in recent memory, according to American Coaster 
Enthusiasts, a 2,000-member organization based in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"It just seems like they are taking off in the last couple years," said Randy 
Geisler of St. Paul, Minn., the association's president. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of decades ago, coasters appeared to be headed the way of bumper cars 
and Ferris wheels. From a peak of more than 1,500 nationwide in 1930, the 
number of coasters around the country plummeted during the 1970s as traditional 
amusement parks were replaced by Disneyland-style theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
While such attractions as flume rides, parachute jumps and dinosaurs remain 
popular, parks have returned to the old-fashioned scary thrills of roller 
coasters to lure in customers in the face of increasing competition. 
</P>
<P>
Roller coaster builders say they have record backlogs as the amusement park 
industry grows ever stronger. Even wooden roller coasters, which once seemed 
headed for extinction, are back on track. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Mountain is spending $8 million to build the 188-foot-high, nearly 
three-quarter-mile long Viper Megacoaster. The steel coaster is being marketed 
as "the world's tallest looping roller coaster." 
</P>
<P>
As impressive as it sounds, the Viper falls short of being the country's 
tallest roller coaster. That distinction belongs to the 205-foot-high Magnum XL 
200 at the Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Roller coaster fans say, however, that the height and length are not the most 
important factors in judging the quality of the ride. 
</P>
<P>
"What you look for is the pacing of the ride, the steepness of the drops and 
the severity of the turns -- the sequence of exciting things that the ride does 
to you," Geisler said. "You could have a ride 50 feet tall and it could scare 
the beejeebees out of you." 
</P>
<P>
Those impressions are not lost on executives at Knott's Berry Farm, who readily 
acknowledge that their new $5-million Boomerang pales in size compared to Magic 
Mountain's Viper. They insist, however, that they are not suffering from a case 
of coaster envy. 
</P>
<P>
"During the ride, you have the sensation that you actually have fallen off the 
track," explained Stuart Zanville, a Knott's spokesman. "With ours, it's not 
the height or the speed, it's how you feel when you get off." 
</P>
<P>
A bit nauseated, perhaps? 
</P>
<P>
No, Zanville said. Boomerang is "a very disorienting experience, and we think 
it's going to be extremely popular," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The popularity of a single ride can add significantly to an amusement park's 
bottom line. The opening of Knott's Bigfoot Rapids ride two years ago, Zanville 
said, boosted park attendance by 10%. Boomerang, which will be heavily promoted 
on television, radio and billboards, is expected to raise attendance another 5% 
to 10%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Courtney Simmons, a Magic Mountain spokeswoman, said the opening of the park's 
Ninja roller coaster in 1988 -- in which the rail runs above the cars instead 
of below -- boosted attendance by 8%. 
</P>
<P>
Both parks say the new attractions are being added to keep current with the 
latest in coaster technology. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted a ride that has all the bells and whistles," Simmons said. She added 
that Viper, which joins a stable of four other coasters, "helps position Magic 
Mountain as the roller-coaster capital of the world," 
</P>
<P>
Knott's 110-foot-tall Boomerang replaces an older coaster that had become 
outdated. "Technology has a way of catching up to us," said Diane Greene, a 
Knott's spokeswoman. The new ride will take riders upside down a total of three 
times in a forward direction, then another three times backwards. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Toomer, whose company designed Viper and several other coasters due to open 
around the country this year, said the appearance of true giant coasters has 
been most noticeable in the past five years.

"The amusement industry is really on a roll right now. Attendance is up. 
Earnings are up," said Toomer, president of Arrow Dynamics in Clearfield, Utah, 
which specializes in theme park rides. "For the last 15 years, we've really had 
a steady output of coasters. The last four or five years have seen the advent 
of some really giant coasters."

GOVERNMENT SEEKS TO REVERSE S&amp;L RULING; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: THE WHITE HOUSE ALSO TRIES TO SPEED UP SENATE CONFIRMATION OF ITS 
CHOICE FOR CHIEF S&amp;L REGULATOR.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration, warning that delays in seizing insolvent savings and 
loan associations could cost taxpayers millions of dollars, asked an appeals 
court Thursday to uphold the government's takeover powers. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration said a lower court action Wednesday, blocking the seizure of 
an Illinois thrift, "may irretrievably disrupt the government's regulation of 
the thrift industry." U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth barred the 
impending takeover of Olympic Federal Savings &amp; Loan of Berwyn, Ill., on 
the grounds that the former chief federal thrift regulator, M. Danny Wall, was 
not constitutionally confirmed by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The government asked the appeals court Thursday for an emergency order blocking 
Lamberth's action. The government asked the appeals court to require that all 
briefs be filed by Monday and that a decision be made as quickly as possible. 
Federal regulators fear that a swarm of other ailing S&amp;Ls will sue to avert 
takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
At least one challenge to a seizure has already been mounted. On Thursday, 
Imperial Corp. of America, former parent of San Diego-based Imperial Savings, 
won a promise from regulators to delay imposition of a receivership on the 
thrift until a court hearing next week determines whether the takeover was 
legal. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial Savings had been placed into conservatorship by the government on Feb. 
23. But the temporary agreement with regulators means the government cannot 
force the S&amp;L into receivership, a final step that would allow regulators 
to wipe out ownership in the thrift and sell its assets. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile on Thursday, the Administration officially submitted to the Senate 
the nomination of former Labor Department official T. Timothy Ryan Jr. as chief 
thrift regulator, moving much faster than expected because of the confusion 
generated by Lamberth's ruling. The Ryan nomination was undergoing the lengthy 
clearance process required for high-level appointees. But the White House now 
wants rapid action to get him confirmed, thereby avoiding additional legal 
challenges to regulators. 
</P>
<P>
The confusion and uncertainty should be temporary, predicted Rep. Henry B. 
Gonzalez (D-Tex.), chairman of the House Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"The impact of the (Lamberth) decision should not be exaggerated," Gonzalez 
said. "The regulatory sky is not falling. High fliers in the thrift industry 
should not break out the champagne with the thought (that) the opinion suddenly 
frees them" from the controls of the S&amp;L law, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;L legislation gave the government the power to spend an estimated 
$285 billion over the next 30 years to close or sell insolvent S&amp;Ls and pay 
off depositors. Deposits are insured by the federal government up to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
The law also eliminated the Federal Home Loan Bank Board as overseer of thrifts 
and replaced it with the Office of Thrift Supervision. Wall, chairman of the 
Bank Board, was appointed OTS director without undergoing new confirmation by 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Lamberth said Wall's appointment was unconstitutional and casts a legal shadow 
over the powers of his office. Wall has since been replaced by Acting Director 
Salvatore Martoche. But Lamberth said the unconstitutional appointment of the 
OTS chief means the agency can't take control of Olympic Savings. 
</P>
<P>
Since the thrift bailout became law Aug. 9, the government has seized 137 
thrifts with $97 billion in assets. Twenty-two of the 35 thrifts in California 
operating under government supervision were seized since then. And about 65 
thrifts in the state now fail at least one of the three new federal capital 
requirements, making them possible candidates for a federal takeover if they 
are unable to replenish their capital. 
</P>
<P>
The largest California thrift that appears vulnerable to a seizure is Santa 
Barbara Savings. Its plan to raise additional capital was rejected by 
regulators in February, a move generally regarded as tantamount to a regulatory 
death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the thrift has been placed under some of the most severe operating 
restrictions available short of being seized, including such things as a 
prohibition against making new loans, a freeze on salaries of employees who 
make more than $50,000 a year and strict rules governing transferal of assets 
or entrance into leases. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the thrift's parent, Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara, 
declined to comment on whether the institution plans to file a suit similar to 
the one filed by Olympic Federal. 
</P>
<P>
One former thrift owner closely monitoring the Illinois case is the New York 
investment firm of Castle Harlan Inc., which owned Western Empire Savings &amp; 
Loan in Yorba Linda. When the thrift was seized Feb. 23, the company threatened 
to sue regulators for what it called their "unconscionable abuse of power" in 
reneging on previous agreements and taking the thrift illegally. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not filed suit yet, but we very likely will soon," said Rob Wages, a 
Castle Harlan executive who was a Western Empire director. "We're watching all 
the legal developments. The judge's ruling (in the Illinois case) is important 
and indicative of how sloppy Congress put this (S&amp;L bailout) law together. 
Now we have an agency that has run amok." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1988, Castle Harlan put up $15.8 million in cash to rescue a 
failing Western Empire Savings without any government assistance. Regulators at 
the time approved the company's business plan, which called for a heavy 
reliance on junk bond trading.

JAPANESE MAY BUY 75% OF 7-ELEVEN'S PARENT FIRM; 
</P>
<P>
ACQUISITION: DEAL WOULD REPRESENT THE BIGGEST JAPANESE INVESTMENT IN A U.S. 
RETAILER. TO SUCCEED IT MUST BE APPROVED BY SOUTHLAND CORP. BONDHOLDERS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The financially strapped parent of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain, 
Southland Corp., announced Thursday that it has agreed to sell 75% of the 
company to its longtime Japanese partner in a tentative deal roughly valued at 
more than $750 million. 
</P>
<P>
If completed, the acquisition would be the biggest Japanese investment ever in 
a U.S. retailer. The proposal was announced one week after another Japanese 
company disclosed plans to buy a major stake in the fashionable Saks Fifth 
Avenue clothing chain. 
</P>
<P>
However, some called the buyout agreement between Southland and Ito-Yokado Co. 
simply the beginning of negotiations among the companies and investors holding 
the Dallas firm's junk bonds. The current terms call for Ito-Yokado and its 
7-Eleven Japan Co. subsidiary to invest $400 million in cash and assume the 
junk bond debt remaining from the deal that turned Southland into a private 
company in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
For the Southland acquisition to succeed, investors owning at least 95% of 
various categories of Southland junk bonds would have to give their approval. 
</P>
<P>
That consent, analysts said, could be hard to obtain because the proposal 
offers relatively little in the way of financial incentives to bondholders. 
Under the current plan, bondholders overall would get 10% of the company and 
some securities, but they would have to give up bonds paying interest of more 
than 15% annually. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the negotiating positions of all the parties are flexible. Otherwise, 
this could end up in bankruptcy," said Robert E. Lupo, head of high-yield bond 
research at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Southland, parent of the world's biggest network of conveniences stores, has 
been brought to the brink of collapse largely by the huge interest payments 
stemming from the $4.9-billion management buyout in 1987. At the time, 
Southland was maneuvering to avert a takeover by Canadian investor Samuel 
Belzberg. 
</P>
<P>
But Southland, along with the Campeau Corp. department stores and others in the 
currently battered U.S. retailing industry, took on junk bond debt after 
overestimating how much business it would do in coming years. "It was part of 
the frenzy of the '80s," said Carol Palmer, an analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps 
in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of prospering, Southland was hit hard by stepped-up competition from 
supermarket and drugstore chains and from oil firms that opened up convenience 
stores of their own. 
</P>
<P>
In November, Southland acknowledged that it faced a cash crisis and began 
working on a corporate overhaul. As part of that overhaul, it sold its 58 
stores in Hawaii for $75 million to Ito-Yokado's 7-Eleven Japan unit. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Southland entered into negotiations to sell its 50% stake in Citgo 
Petroleum Corp. for $661.5 million to Petroleos de Venezuela S.A., the 
state-owned oil company. 
</P>
<P>
Still, with big bond interest payments coming due in June, Southland kept 
looking for an acquirer. 
</P>
<P>
In Ito-Yokado, Southland is working with what it termed the second-largest, but 
most profitable, "superstore" and supermarket chain operator in Japan. Along 
with its 50.3% stake in 7-Eleven Japan, Ito-Yokado owns a 51% interest in 
Denny's Japan Co. Overall, Ito-Yokado employs more than 38,700 full- and 
part-time workers. 
</P>
<P>
The 7-Eleven Japan unit is the largest convenience store company in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Southland is the owner or franchiser of 7,000 convenience stores and 
has agreements with affiliates that operate an additional 5,900 outlets in the 
United States and 21 other countries. 
</P>
<P>
The company, founded 62 years ago, has long been considered a pillar of Dallas' 
business establishment and is 94% owned or controlled by the city's Thompson 
family. Observers said the purchase of majority control of the company by 
Japanese interests might in some circles be considered a blow to the community. 
The Thompsons would be left with only 15% of Southland. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure there'll be people who express concern, but you have to remember that 
this is a company with whom Southland has had a long-term relationship," Robert 
Mead, a Southland spokesman, said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Japanese investors have spent enormous sums in U.S. real estate, banks 
and industrial companies, they have been reluctant to make large direct 
investments in American retailers. So far, the biggest such investment has been 
Jusco's purchase of Talbots, an apparel chain, for $325 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts have said that Japanese retailers have shied away from U.S. 
investments out of concern that they are not familiar enough with American 
consumer tastes. On Thursday, however, some industry experts suggested that 
Japanese buyers may now be on the prowl for U.S. merchandisers. 
</P>
<P>
Louis J. Grabowsky, a partner in the Dallas office of the accounting firm 
Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., said that Japanese investors with long-term 
strategies are likely to be interested in some U.S. retailers with short-term 
cash problems, such as Southland and the Campeau chains. 
</P>
<P>
Another analyst added that the yen's weak value recently may be prodding 
Japanese investors to act quickly, before the currency sinks even further, 
driving up the cost of overseas investments. 
</P>
<P>
Southland officials, in a news release, said a restructuring of the company "is 
critical because of changing industry conditions which have strained the 
capital structure of Southland." 
</P>
<P>
They added that the company has already announced that "without a successful 
restructuring of its debt, it will face a significant liquidity crisis," a 
statement some analysts took as a signal of a possible bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ito-Yokado's proposal would give it a majority of the seats on 
Southland's board, officials said current management would continue to run the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Masatoshi Ito, president of Ito-Yokado and chairman of 
7-Eleven Japan, said: "We will maintain and build upon our mutually strong 
market positions by combining the operating skills and strategic thinking of 
the American and Japanese companies. We are looking forward to working even 
more closely with the employees, franchises and licensees of Southland." 
</P>
<P>
John P. Thompson, Southland's chairman, said: "We believe this strategic 
alliance, which will bring an infusion of $400 million in capital to Southland, 
is the best way to achieve the company's goals. 
</P>
<P>
"The infusion will enable the company to go forward with vital capital 
improvements, as well as the advertising and promotion programs that are so 
important in today's competitive convenience retailing environment. We believe 
this transaction is necessary to preserve the business we've built."

HER EXPERIENCE WITH A STEPMOTHER IS NOTHING LIKE CINDERELLA'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not all stepfamilies have to struggle as they work toward love and unity. My 
own experience was happy from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure that my natural mother loved me, and I her, even though I don't 
remember her very well. I was 8 and my sister 12 when our mother died. 
</P>
<P>
But we didn't have the mother-daughter closeness apparent in some families. I 
don't remember listening to bedtime stories while being tucked gently beneath 
the covers or while cuddling on her lap, her cool hands stroking my hair. 
</P>
<P>
When my father announced his plans to remarry a number of months later, I was 
surprised but not unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
I still remember where we were and where we had eaten dinner, how the 
gold-flecked diamonds on the seats of my dad's truck felt under my hand as he 
told us. 
</P>
<P>
Not having spent much time with my natural mother, I was ready to welcome a new 
mother who would be home when I went to bed at night and got up in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
I don't remember too much from the first few months in our revised family. Some 
things do stand out -- getting over the awkwardness of calling a new woman 
"Mom," the Madame Alexander doll with her yellow dotted dress she brought me, 
and adjusting to a new schedule that, for the first time, included regular 
bedtime hours and church. 
</P>
<P>
And all the new rules! 
</P>
<P>
Having been used to spending a lot of time on our own, my sister and I weren't 
used to someone's telling us what to wear, what we could watch on TV and what 
to eat. 
</P>
<P>
No more mornings of Pop Tarts and Cap'n Crunch. We were now awakened to a 
mother who served us oatmeal and wheat toast. The days of wearing shorts and 
flip-flops to school were definitely over. Mom made me some outfits that I 
hated to wear, and I didn't tell her because I didn't want to hurt her 
feelings. They were so out of style! Especially the green pantsuit with the 
gold trim! Junior high, as we all know, is a place where you have to conform or 
die of embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, though, changing a few habits and styles wasn't too much to ask of 
us, and it didn't take me long to adjust to having a new mother. 
</P>
<P>
I'll never forget the time we were making chocolate chip cookies late one 
Saturday morning. In my eagerness to taste the batter, I leaned over just a 
little too far and got my hair tangled in the beaters. 
</P>
<P>
She and sister were sure it was the funniest thing they'd ever seen. They made 
me stand, glaring, for a picture with my gooey hair twisted around the beater. 
</P>
<P>
And the time our dog, Nemo, was killed by a car during a lightning storm. When 
I came home from school, Mom pulled me onto her lap to comfort me. I was crying 
uncontrollably. She was completely at a loss. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll do anything, anything, if you'll just stop crying," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't . . . ," I sobbed, stuttering, "make me wear . . . that green pantsuit 
anymore. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Poor Nemo was temporarily forgotten. How we laugh about that now! 
</P>
<P>
My sister had a tougher time adjusting than I did, but not really because of 
the stepmother situation. It was just that hard time of maturing, leaving 
childhood behind for the new challenges of being a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, not only did we gain a new mother, we also got a new sister 
(already married by that time) and lots of other wonderful new relatives. 
</P>
<P>
I cherish this new family situation. It seems foreign to think of my mother and 
sister as stepmother and stepsister. They're simply family. 
</P>
<P>
It was wonderful, and still is, to have a mother who cared for me as for her 
own. What makes a family, after all, is not merely blood ties. 
</P>
<P>
To me, a real mother is the woman who brings a child up with care, love and 
respect -- regardless of whether she brought him or her into the world.

SCULPTURE MAKES A SPLASH AT BREA MALL; 
</P>
<P>
ART: CITY'S 90TH ART IN PUBLIC PLACES PROGRAM PIECE IS A STAINLESS STEEL 
FOUNTAIN CREATED BY BELGIAN ARTIST POL BURY.

The first sculpture by an internationally known artist commissioned for Brea's 
Art in Public Places program was installed in Brea Mall's Central Court on 
Wednesday. The untitled fountain sculpture by Belgian artist Pol Bury is the 
90th work of art in the 15-year-old program. 
</P>
<P>
The fountain, which is expected to be fully operational by the weekend, 
consists of 15 stainless steel spheres mounted on columns. The action of the 
water circulating through the columns makes the spheres rotate, an activity 
given added luster by the small, mirrorlike concave area in each sphere. 
</P>
<P>
Early in his career, Bury, 67, was an abstract painter. In 1953 he made his 
first movable compositions -- flat black and white planes that could be fitted 
together different ways to produce different patterns. A few years later he 
added electric motors, which he called "form mixers," to his pieces. 
</P>
<P>
The movement in these sprightly and sensual works tends to be almost 
imperceptible. Bury once described one of his pieces as "two slownesses gently 
grazing each other." 
</P>
<P>
His work was included in the 1964 Venice Biennale and has been the subject of 
numerous museum exhibitions in the United States and Europe. But in recent 
decades the sculptor -- who lives in Paris and is married to an American -- has 
been eclipsed by artists working in more contemporary modes. 
</P>
<P>
A compact man with the drooping eyes of a basset hound, Bury was busy 
supervising a work crew on Wednesday. Asked if he found the mall an odd place 
for his art, he said he had made another shopping mall piece a decade ago in 
Short Hills, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
"There are not so many differences between this and the public art of the 
street," he said. He prefers putting the work in public sites rather than 
museums. Why? "More people." 
</P>
<P>
Brea's public art program requires developers of all residential, commercial 
and industrial projects above the $500,000 level to fund a permanent work of 
art for the project site. Proposals are reviewed by city departments and an art 
advisory committee. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to commission Bury was made by the New York corporate office of 
Corporate Property Investors (CPI), owners of the mall. Ken Glowacki, CPI's 
director of development, said the piece cost "more than $100,000." 
</P>
<P>
Early next month, also as part of the Art in Public Places program, CPI will 
install a fiberglass sculpture by Parisian artist Niki de St. Phalle in the 
mall corridor between Robinson's and Nordstrom.

ART: THE 15TH ANNUAL FLORENCE ARNOLD CHILDREN'S ART FESTIVAL RUNS THROUGH APRIL 
8 AT THE MUCKENTHALER CULTURAL CENTER IN FULLERTON.

The bar was pouring fruit punch instead of Chardonnay, and a juggling clown 
replaced the usual string quartet, but to the exhibiting artists, Sunday's 
opening reception at the Muckenthaler Cultural Center was truly intoxicating. 
</P>
<P>
The fun launched the 15th annual Florence Arnold Children's Art Festival, in 
which more than 400 Fullerton grade-schoolers see their art promoted from the 
family bulletin board to the stately Muckenthaler gallery. Twenty public and 
private schools are represented in the show, which continues through April 8. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the museum's Center Circle support group, the festival is the 
brainchild of Florence Arnold, 90, an abstract artist and longtime mover and 
shaker in the Fullerton artistic community. Arnold's work has been shown 
locally at the Newport Harbor Art Museum, the Muckenthaler and the Laguna Art 
Museum, and she has had one-woman shows in galleries in Rome, Florence and 
Milan. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold said she started the festival in 1976 to help give children an 
appreciation for the visual arts. "In school . . . (we) must encourage a love 
of visual art. They don't have to pursue it as a career, but they should learn 
how to view it because all their life they will be looking at it in some form." 
</P>
<P>
The Children's Art Festival is a non-competitive event open to all Fullerton 
pupils in kindergarten through eighth grade. There are no blue ribbons, no 
special prizes. As Arnold sees it, the non-threatening format shows youngsters 
that "they can be accepted for just being themselves, just doing their best. 
</P>
<P>
"Children shouldn't start out competing too early in life; there's plenty of 
that as they grow older," she continued. "Every piece here is a winner." 
</P>
<P>
(There is one exception. Each year, one entry is selected by Arnold and local 
watercolorist Jane Ingalls to be reproduced on announcements for the following 
year's exhibit. This year, the women chose a watercolor by Gabriel Stan, a 
fourth-grader at Acacia School.) 
</P>
<P>
The theme of this year's festival, "A Look at the World and What's Important to 
You," prompted some surprisingly mature responses from participants. Through 
their art, the children supported such concepts as world peace, nationalism and 
family unity. They spoke out against gangs, drunk drivers, pollution and more. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Hinch, a fifth-grader at the Berkeley School, packed a punch in his 
drawing. On the left side of the page, the word "gangs" is scrawled on a 
crumbling brick wall, which looms over a forbidding chasm edged in barbed wire. 
On the right side, another wall (this one in much better repair), towers above 
a pristine rolling meadow. Neatly lettered on the wall: "peace." 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Clark, a fourth-grader at Berkeley, promotes serenity on a global scale. 
In watercolor, she paints a simple blue and green world bearing the words, 
"Peace on Me." 
</P>
<P>
Family seems to take top priority to kindergartners Michelle Burchfiel and 
Michael Favela of Fern Drive School. Their charming crayon drawings feature a 
traditional lineup of moms, dads, kids and pets that would have made Ozzie 
Nelson proud. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Haniszewski and John Mark Geiss demonstrate a little American spirit in 
their works. First-grader Haniszewski of Fern Drive School pays tribute to 
"Long Tall (Abe) Lincoln"; Geiss, of Sunset Lane School's third grade, turned 
in a proud bald eagle. 
</P>
<P>
Papier-mache sculptures from students at the Nicolas School seem to stray a bit 
from the show's theme but drew plenty of smiles from viewers. Fire-breathing 
beasties took the day here, including a two-headed fellow by seventh-grader 
Juan Montes. The hot-pink dragon sports a skull-and-crossbones on his wings and 
spikes; flames spew from his ears and mouth and a set of wicked yellow talons 
adorn his feet. Eighth-grader Matt Sanders followed suit with a spotted green 
monster that resembles Puff the Magic Dragon on his worst day. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15th annual Florence Arnold Children's Art Festival continues through 
April 8 at the Muckenthaler Cultural Center, 1201 W. Malvern Ave., Fullerton. 
Gallery hours are Tuesday through Saturday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; Sunday, noon to 
5 p.m. Admission: free. Information: (714) 738-6595.

COMPANY B WILL PERFORM BENEFITS FOR LP REPERTORY; 
</P>
<P>
STAGE: 'ALL NIGHT LONG' WILL BE PRESENTED TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY TO RAISE FUNDS 
FOR THE FINANCIALLY TROUBLED TUSTIN DINNER THEATER.

<P>
With Tustin's LP Repertory Dinner Theatre on the brink of disaster, Company B 
hopes to ride to the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
Company B, a local 10-person variety troupe, will put on benefit performances 
of its show "All Night Long" today through Sunday at the financially strapped 
company's storefront playhouse. LP Repertory, about $80,000 behind on its rent, 
needs to raise $5,000 to stave off eviction at the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
Trisha Andreatta, the theater's "office administrator-slash-everything," said 
LP Repertory has tried to bring something new to the standard dinner-theater 
fare since opening late in 1988. "You won't see us doing 'Music Man' or 'Man of 
La Mancha,' " Andreatta said. 
</P>
<P>
Managing director William J. Durkin founded the theater as an adjunct to the 
Lilliput Players, a successful children's theater group for more than a decade. 
Sarah Coleman, founder of the Lilliput Players and Durkin's girlfriend, died 
last July of ALS (also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease). 
</P>
<P>
But the theater has struggled since the beginning, canceling as many as half 
its performances because of poor attendance. "Nobody knows we're here," said 
Andreatta, citing the theater's lack of visibility (it can't afford to 
advertise) as its main problem. 
</P>
<P>
Before the 150-seat theater opened, it was forced to divert its advertising 
budget to meet stringent city sanitation codes, even though the theater has its 
meals catered. Many of the improvements later proved to be unnecessary, 
Andreatta said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our theater is having some severe financial problems," Andreatta said. Backers 
need to come up with $10,000 to keep the lease; it has $5,000 in reserve and 
hopes to raise the rest with the shows this weekend. The theater has suspended 
performances of its own production, "El Grande de Coca Cola," to make room for 
the benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Company B Productions is an offshoot of Young Americans Dinner Theater, which 
operated out of a dinner theater of its own in Huntington Harbour until last 
September, when it disbanded. Three of the principals went on to form Company 
B, a five-man, five-woman music, dance and comedy troupe that has toured and 
performed locally at Knott's Berry Farm and the Harlequin Dinner Playhouse (now 
Hamptons). 
</P>
<P>
Company B may make LP Repertory a regular home if the theater remains afloat, 
according to Bob McDonald, the troupe's chief executive officer. Other local 
groups have recently contacted LP Repertory about staging productions there, 
Andreatta said, including Stop-Gap Theatre and the Orange County Black Actors 
Theatre. Neither group currently has a permanent home. 
</P>
<P>
"The space itself is very adaptable to whatever we want to do," said Andreatta, 
who is determined to keep LP Repertory going. "It's a great theater. It's a 
great location." 
</P>
<P>
 "All Night Long" by Company B Productions will be performed tonight, Saturday 
and Sunday at 7 p.m. Also, Sunday at 1 p.m. At LP Repertory Dinner Theatre, 
15732 D Tustin Village Way, Tustin. Tickets: $25, including meal. Information: 
(714) 835-9611.

VERSATILE DESKS DOUBLY ATTRACTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
THE RIGHT DESIGN CAN ADD BEAUTY AS WELL AS FUNCTION TO A HOME 
</P>

Tom Brenneman was browsing through an antique store when a desk in the corner 
caught his eye. He didn't know it yet, but he was hooked. 
</P>
<P>
He circled the Italian Art Deco desk, admiring the classic curved lines, the 
unusual reddish hue and the beauty of the swirling patterns of the walnut burl 
veneer (cut horizontally from a tree stump). Finally, he decided he had to have 
it. Brenneman's wife, Cindy, tried to dissuade him. First of all, this was 1978 
and $1,400 seemed a bit pricey. It was too big, and anyway, he already had a 
desk. 
</P>
<P>
But, he recalls, "I literally couldn't leave the store." He told himself, "I 
gotta do something to tie that desk up so nothing happens to it." 
</P>
<P>
Today, that one-of-a-kind desk is glossy with years of lovingly applied beeswax 
polish and is the most prized piece of furniture in the Brennemans' Costa Mesa 
home. The two say they will never part with it. 
</P>
<P>
Selecting a desk for the home can be a very personal decision. For some people, 
a desk is more than just a place to store papers and pencils. They know the 
right desk can add beauty to their homes and still be functional. 
</P>
<P>
It's true that some still opt for basic pressed-wood economy models that sell 
for less than $200. Others, however, prefer to go upscale for just the right 
desk to complement their home. 
</P>
<P>
For these people, beauty is just as important as function, whether the choice 
is like the Brennemans', a sleek contemporary model, a Southwest style or even 
a custom design. 
</P>
<P>
Martha Martin chose a natural pine desk with a Mexican motif to blend in with 
the comfortable ranch-style interior of her newly remodeled Cowan Heights home. 
The $1,500 desk has a light finish that is slightly rough, drawers with iron 
pulls, hand carving and is topped with a hutch with cubbyholes and drawers. 
</P>
<P>
She placed it in her family room so she could be in the thick of her busy 
family's activities when doing Little League paper work or just paying bills. 
</P>
<P>
Designer Mary Swift of Swift Interiors in Laguna Hills had a physician client 
who needed a desk in a master bedroom, away from his busy family. 
</P>
<P>
The room had a bay window that extended to the floor and left an odd-shaped 
space that seemed ideal for a desk. Swift suggested a custom design. That 
resulted in a 9-foot, 3-inch Philippine mahogany desktop attached to the wall 
on each side, with additional supports underneath and small drawers for pens 
and pencils. It cost about $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Work-space environment is an important consideration when selecting a desk and 
deciding where to put it, Swift says. A work space needs to be "a pleasant 
place where you don't mind working," she says, "a place where people feel 
comfortable when they go there." Otherwise, it's easier to find excuses not to 
use it. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Anne Emett has just that in a cozy 4-foot by 4-foot office with a desk 
designed like a drafting table. Emett needed a place where she could 
comfortably create drawings and paintings as preliminaries for her ceramic 
sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
During the remodeling of the Emett home on Newport Bay, an alcove was created 
between two rooms as a result of a wall that had to be left in place for 
support. The rooms are designed as one large room that can be divided by 
closing a series of floor-to-ceiling sliding Japanese soji screens. 
</P>
<P>
Emett and her interior designer, John Garcia of PLANit Design Studio in Corona 
del Mar, decided it would be ideal for a work space. It's small, but Emett has 
everything she needs there -- desk, phone, books, paper and art materials -- 
within arm's reach. Yet, she doesn't feel closed in. On one wall, she can look 
through soji screens into the den and to the bay beyond. And when guests 
arrive, she can conceal her work by closing the screens. 
</P>
<P>
Emett's cabinetmaker created a 3-foot by 4-foot desk that sits 42 inches high 
and has a top that slants like a drafting table. Because Emett is more than 6 
feet, 2 inches tall, she can stand and work or sit on a tall stool. 
</P>
<P>
The desk cost less than $500, Emett said. The top, framed in natural redwood 
and covered with blue Formica to match the walls in surrounding rooms, is 
hinged and has storage underneath. It also has drawer storage and a niche that 
holds large drawing pads and mailing tubes. 
</P>
<P>
Julia Cunningham of Julia Cunningham Interior Design in Seal Beach also had a 
client with an odd-sized space as the result of a remodel. This area was in 
front of a window with a bay view, in a family room that featured a custom 
cherry wood bar with a granite top. The solution: a custom desk to match the 
bar. It has ample drawer space to accommodate the client's needs, she says, and 
cost less than $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
Function, says Cunningham, is still one of the most important considerations 
when selecting a desk. "What are the needs of the person using the desk?" she 
asks clients. Many people today need space for peripherals such as computers, 
keyboards and screens, printers and fax machines. And many times, she says, 
people opt for something utilitarian, rather than something pretty. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, however, even a pretty desk can have unexpected versatility. 
</P>
<P>
Carmen Olssen, an Irvine interior designer, had a client who wanted to put his 
large contemporary desk in the dining room of his new high-rise condominium. 
The desk was in an adjacent room sometimes inundated with outside noises, and 
besides, the dining room had a view. 
</P>
<P>
As a solution, Olssen designed a room that is an office by day and a dining 
room at night by adding multipurpose black leather chairs on casters, hidden 
storage space for office materials and adjustable lighting. 
</P>
<P>
The glass and chrome desk, which Olssen estimates cost between $7,000 and 
$10,000, has two semicircle end pieces that can extend the three-foot-wide desk 
from a length of six feet to nine feet. The top of the main body of the desk is 
a heavy piece of smoked gray glass on top of a chrome crossbar/pedestal. 
</P>
<P>
When it's time to dine, the man simply unplugs his phone and puts it away and 
hides any paper work in a credenza and a cabinet underneath a planter. 
Extended, the desk will comfortably seat eight for dinner. And, says Olssen, no 
one would ever suspect it's a desk. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Brenneman says her home office has it all -- beauty, function and the 
perfect environment. She uses the desk most now, for her work as an artist and 
photographers' representative. She finds the desk very functional, with plenty 
of work space and drawers that go the full depth of the desk. There's even a 
storage space for portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the desk, which is 3 feet by 6 feet, the 11-foot by 13-foot room 
contains two matching library cases, the largest measuring 8 feet by 7 feet. 
All three pieces are works of art with hand carving and appealing curved lines. 
The matching cases hadn't arrived yet at Steven-Thomas Antiques in Santa Ana 
when the Brennemans' bought the desk, but they purchased them later for $1,800. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, the office does not look cramped in spite of the massive pieces 
-- somehow it all works because of the beauty of the furniture. This is not 
always the case however. 
</P>
<P>
Jim McClure, owner of Orange County Office Furniture in Santa Ana, remembers a 
customer who bought a large desk and a matching credenza topped by a hutch. 
When the furniture was set up in his home, the man's wife had a fit because she 
said it overpowered the room. She made him return it. 
</P>
<P>
That's why McClure urges customers to block out the space a desk and other 
furniture will occupy before going shopping. 
</P>
<P>
McClure also stresses that it's important to measure doorways and hallways to 
see if a desk can be maneuvered into its appointed room. He recalls one 
customer who was irate when his new desk wouldn't go through the narrow door of 
his home office, a converted garage. Then he sheepishly apologized when he 
remembered that his current desk was put in place before the final wall and 
doorway were installed.

NEW INSIGHTS INTO LEARNING DISABILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERRI KOBREN, Gerri Kobren is a writer for the Baltimore Sun. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"I always knew I was smarter than my grades indicated. My teachers didn't tell 
me that: They said I wasn't trying, that I was sloppy. When I couldn't spell 
something, they told me to go look it up. But how can you look it up if you 
can't spell it?" 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Gold, professor of English at Community College of Baltimore and 
co-author of three texts on children with learning problems, is 
learning-disabled. It is not, she says, something you outgrow or cure. 
Learning-disabled children have normal intelligence, but are unable to learn 
the way other children do. That does not, however, mean they cannot learn at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
"There are fantastic alternative ways of teaching," says Frona Roth, associate 
professor in the department of hearing and speech sciences at the University of 
Maryland, College Park. "What the good schools do is identify the particular 
learning pattern and style of the individual child, and work toward that." 
</P>
<P>
Boys are more likely than girls to have learning disabilities; the difficulty 
sometimes seems to run in families. But why it happens is not known. Whether 
all instances of learning deficits are "learning disabilities" is also unclear. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Alan Davick, a privately practicing pediatrician with a strong interest in 
learning disabilities, says it's useful to think of a learning disability as "a 
wiring abnormality in the brain that affects the way they process information." 
</P>
<P>
In some children, the abnormality is so subtle it is unrecognized: The child 
struggles but gets through school and goes into a career that emphasizes talent 
in an area other than the disability. 
</P>
<P>
In others, there is a constellation of deficits: The child might be slow to 
speak, might not fully understand when spoken to, might not remember what he or 
she knew just a short time ago. 
</P>
<P>
School can be a maze. Learning-disabled children might see d where others see 
b; read was instead of saw; recite a cockeyed alphabet; forget how to finish a 
word or letter they've started to write. They might not even be able to control 
the fingers that hold the pencil, might not be able to organize notebooks, 
start compositions, finish assignments. Math might defeat them; foreign 
language is Greek to them. 
</P>
<P>
Some are also unable to pay attention: They have "attention deficit disorder" 
in addition to their other problems. Some are unable to sit still: They're 
"hyperactive." 
</P>
<P>
In the bad old days, they would have been the dumb kids in class, the 
troublemakers, the failures. 
</P>
<P>
Now, learning-disabled children are often recognized very early.

MARRIAGE CAN BE BETTER FOR THOSE TRYING 2ND TIME WITH EACH OTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton did it. 
</P>
<P>
Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner did it. 
</P>
<P>
Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson did it just last year. 
</P>
<P>
And so did Barbara and Bobby Carr. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Carrs, a Maryland couple, cannot be counted among celebrity 
twosomes, they do have the distinction -- as do those Hollywood duos -- of 
having married, divorced and remarried each other. 
</P>
<P>
The Carrs were married the first time on Jan. 1, 1981; that was the second 
marriage for both and brought together his son and her two daughters from their 
respective first marriages. 
</P>
<P>
The two separated in May, 1987, divorced in February, 1989, and remarried 
quietly in a civil ceremony in June, 1989, and in a public, religious ceremony 
Oct. 7. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we're happy and we choose to be together because we want to be, not 
because we need to be," said Bobby Carr, 46. 
</P>
<P>
"We paid a high price, (but) the reward is amazing," said Barbara Carr, 41. 
</P>
<P>
They communicate better now, she says. There is more honesty in the 
relationship, and they realize how lucky they are to have another chance at a 
life that was good for several years. 
</P>
<P>
How many couples get back together after divorcing seems impossible to say. The 
National Center for Health Statistics, which tracks marriages and divorces, 
does not count this subgroup. The Carrs' relationship turned sour on Bobby's 
"alcohol problem," which worsened during the six years of their first marriage, 
he said, "and continued to intrude on our life," especially during the last 18 
months they were together. 
</P>
<P>
When Barbara "got tired of trying," she left, he said. It was May 15, 1987. 
Bobby remembers the date without hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not at all happy about her leaving, but in a way she did me a great 
favor," he said. "It took that kind of emotional shock for me to hit bottom." 
</P>
<P>
Bobby's life took a turn for the better on Sept. 3, 1987, when he began 
attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and "worked that program eagerly." He 
also made up his mind "that there was a way to reconcile with Barb." 
</P>
<P>
But their lives apart took several more turns -- including a new relationship 
for Barbara -- before they turned back to one another. In June, 1988, she filed 
for divorce, but it was not granted because Bobby refused to agree that "there 
was no chance of reconciliation," as the law requires. 
</P>
<P>
Eight months later, in early 1989, Bobby agreed to the divorce and it became 
final. Barbara remembers that she was anything but happy. While still in the 
office of the master (an attorney appointed to review divorce agreements before 
they go to a judge), she recalls thinking: "I don't want this. I really still 
love this person. 
</P>
<P>
"I cried the whole weekend." 
</P>
<P>
"The only remaining link (between them) was the automobile she was driving that 
was in my name," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When Bobby called to suggest that she refinance the car in her name, he found 
out that Barbara had ended the relationship she had been involved in. Bobby 
seized the moment and asked her for a date. She agreed. That was in April. 
</P>
<P>
The former husband and wife continued to date, to talk, to try to work things 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Early in May, Bobby went to Seattle for five days. They missed each other "a 
lot" and began to keep "extremely steady company thereafter," Bobby says, 
although they continued to live apart. "We talked about the possibility of 
getting married again." 
</P>
<P>
Again, Bobby seized the moment. He went to the courthouse and got a marriage 
license, which is valid for six months. When he brought it to Barbara, she put 
it in a drawer. Then, in June, she said, "let's go over to the courthouse and 
get married." It was the day of her older daughter's high school graduation. 
</P>
<P>
So, after the graduation on June 13, Barbara and Bobby Carr were married again. 
But they didn't tell anyone. And they didn't move in together until the end of 
summer. Several weeks after the courthouse marriage, they told the children, 
who were thrilled. (The Carrs had no children from their earlier marriage to 
each other.) Then they told Barbara's parents, who were also happy, and finally 
their close friends. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is nearly impossible to categorize couples who recouple, the Carrs 
fit at least one criteria identified by doctors and counselors who have worked 
with such people. Their relationship underwent an obvious change: Bobby's 
successful battle with the bottle. 
</P>
<P>
Couples who undergo behavioral changes are among those ripe for recoupling, 
says JoAnn Magdoff, a NewYork psychotherapist who has worked with similar 
couples. She identifies two more groups of people predisposed to getting back 
together: 
</P>
<P>
* Those who married young and feel that life is passing them by. These people 
often divorce and go out into the world only to find that the grass wasn't so 
brown at home. So they remarry. "They're sowing their wild oats in the middle 
(of a marriage)," Magdoff says. 
</P>
<P>
* Couples with an extensive history, particularly those with children. "Who 
else was there when your child was born? No one else who you meet later shares 
that," she says.

OKADA LEADS PALOS VERDES TO WIN OVER HAWTHORNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART MATTHEWS , SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Palos Verdes High School Coach Gil Eberhard is still wondering when Chuck 
Okada, his leadoff man and second baseman, is going to hit a cold streak. 
</P>
<P>
But he's hoping he won't. It's a happy form of anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday afternoon, Okada sparked Palos Verdes to a 8-6 Bay League victory at 
Hawthorne with a home run, three runs batted in, and five sparkling defensive 
plays. 
</P>
<P>
"Chuck is tearing it up right now," Eberhard said. "I don't know if he'll stay 
that way, but hopefully if he goes cold we'll have someone else who will get 
hot." 
</P>
<P>
Okada, who reached base nine consecutive times in the preseason, went into the 
game against Hawthorne with a .481 batting average. 
</P>
<P>
He raised that mark in the third inning when he stroked a high fastball from 
Hawthorne starter Angel Fierro (2-1) the opposite way and onto the tennis 
courts behind the right-field fence. Okada's blast scored Chris Heyn ahead of 
him and erased Hawthorne's early 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Okada drove in another run on a fielder's choice in the next inning, then stole 
second and scored on the second of Doug Kay's two doubles. He added another 
base hit -- a sharp ground ball that ate up Hawthorne shortstop Robert Lujan -- 
to sustain a Palos Verdes rally in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
"We're awfully dangerous if we put the bat on the ball like we did today," 
Eberhard said. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe so, but Okada's clutch defense played a big part as well. Okada went 
airborne four times to make the pivot on double plays, and ended three innings 
for Hawthorne in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Hawthorne was able to scrape out three runs to pull to within 8-6 in the 
sixth. 
</P>
<P>
In the final inning, though, Okada was there with another great play to snuff 
out Hawthorne's last-ditch rally. With one out, Hawthorne's Randy Davidson 
reached first on an error by Palos Verdes right fielder Jason Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
Fierro, the next hitter, hit a flare to shallow right that looked as if it 
might drop in for extra bases. But Okada ranged to the outfield grass to haul 
it in with a sprawling, over-the-shoulder catch. Lujan grounded out to Okada on 
the next play to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
Left-hander Josh Leichter (1-0) got the win in relief for Palos Verdes, which 
improved to 6-3 overall and 2-0 in the Bay League. 
</P>
<P>
Left fielder Armando Fernandez led the Cougars (5-5, 0-2) at the plate with 
three hits, including an RBI double in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica 4, Torrance 0 -- Hot-hitting Torrance finally cooled off as 
right-hander Richard Armendariz pitched a six-hit shutout to lead host Santa 
Monica. Armendariz struck out five and walked only two. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance dropped to 7-3 overall and 1-1 in the Bay League. Junior left-hander 
Kris Radcliffe took the loss for the Tartars despite striking out five and 
allowing only five hits. Only two of the runs allowed by Radcliffe were earned. 
</P>
<P>
"Kris pitched well enough to win, but we didn't get the timely hitting today 
like we have in the past," Torrance Coach Jeff Phillips said. "We had base 
runners and opportunities, but their kid pitched a real good game. When he 
needed the outs, he got them." 
</P>
<P>
The key for Santa Monica was a single to center field that turned into a 
three-base error and allowed two runs to score. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance was led by cleanup hitter Eric Gonzales, who went three for three with 
a double. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills, 8, Beverly Hills 3-The Titans, 13-1 losers to Beverly Hills on 
Tuesday, bounced back behind the pitching of Kirt Kishita en route to a Bay 
League victory at Rolling Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Kishita, a junior right-hander, gave up five hits to earn his first win in four 
decisions. He struck out six and walked four. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills (3-5 overall, 1-1 in league play) took a 4-1 lead in the third 
inning on Steve Archibald's three-run homer to center field. Archibald finished 
the day two for two with a pair of walks. 
</P>
<P>
Tristan Paul was three for three for the Titans. 
</P>
<P>
Banning 9, Dorsey 4-Lamont Dobbins, Sal Areyan and Raul Diaz combined for seven 
of the Pilots 10 hits in a Southern-Pacific Conference win at Banning. 
</P>
<P>
Dobbins was three for four with two runs scored and an RBI, Areyan was two for 
four with a triple and two RBIs, and Diaz was two for four with a double. 
</P>
<P>
Banning improved to 6-4 overall and 4-1 in the Pacific League to remain in 
first place. The Pilots committed five errors, leading to three unearned runs 
for Dorsey. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 7, Gardena 3-The Mohicans mounted a late rally, scoring twice in the 
sixth inning and loading the bases with one out in the sixth, but it was not 
enough as they dropped a Southern Pacific Conference game at Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Gardena (5-4, overall, 3-2 in the conference) made it 7-3 on a two-run homer by 
Alvin Thomas in the sixth and sent the potential tying run to the plate in the 
seventh but left the bases loaded.

Municipal merchants ran up $5.8 billion in taxable sales during the second 
quarter of 1989, the most recent period for which information is available. 
That was a 10% increase from the second quarter of 1988, with the biggest jump, 
30%, occurring in San Juan Capistrano. Three cities suffered dips from 1988 -- 
the largest being 8% in Placentia. The $799.5 million spent in Anaheim was the 
largest amount in any one city, 14% of the total.

FIVE-COUNTY COMPARISON 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's overall second-quarter 1989 taxable sales were 9% more than 
second quarter 1988, right in line with the local five-county and statewide 
increases. Riverside and San Bernardino counties both enjoyed much larger 
jumps. Slightly more than half the taxable sales in the state for the second 
quarter of 1989, 53%, took place in either Orange or the neighboring four 
counties.

TAXABLE SALES TREND 
</P>
<P>
The $6.8 billion in taxable sales in second quarter 1989 was by far the largest 
comparable period total for any of the last three years. This most recent 
figure was 9% higher than 1988's second quarter and 14% more than 1987. It was 
also the largest total in the last 10 quarters except for 1988's fourth quarter 
(fourth-quarter spending is normally higher than others because of holiday 
purchases).

BUSH CAUTIONS SOVIETS ON USE OF FORCE IN LITHUANIA, DECLARES IT WILL 'BACKFIRE'

<P>
President Bush warned the Soviet Union today that any attempt to intimidate or 
use force against the breakaway republic of Lithuania "is bound to backfire. 
That is inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
Bush coupled his statement with a declaration that the United States stands 
with the people of Lithuania "and supports their right to self-determination." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet armor rumbled through the Lithuanian capital's streets on Thursday, 
prompting concern that increasing Kremlin pressure would lead to violence. 
Today, Administration officials said the Soviet Union has ordered foreign 
diplomats and at least some journalists to leave Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
Bush told a White House gathering, "Any attempt to coerce or intimidate or 
forcibly intervene against the Lithuanian people is bound to backfire. That is 
inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
Bush spoke about Lithuania as he opened a news conference with editors and 
reporters from out-of-town news media. 
</P>
<P>
Declaring solidarity with Lithuanians, Bush said, "this is a complex and 
sensitive time, when realistic, levelheaded leadership is required on all 
sides." 
</P>
<P>
"Lithuanian leaders have consistently demonstrated their capacity in this 
regard, and the United States will do nothing that will make their task more 
difficult," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We know the Soviet Union has a longstanding interest in Lithuania but those 
interests can only be addressed through dialogue and negotiations," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question, Bush said he has not seen any intelligence suggesting 
"some kind of conflagration over the weekend" in Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, "it is a matter of considerable tension. I hope those 
tensions can be released through negotiation." 
</P>
<P>
On other subjects, the President: 
</P>
<P>
Said that "I don't think this is the time to change the policy on sanctions" on 
South Africa, even though he has been reviewing the sanction issue within his 
own Administration and with congressional leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Said his Administration is looking into ways of shifting shipping lanes off the 
coast of California to keep oil tankers farther away from beaches. He said it 
is impossible to deny access to tankers to West Coast ports, but said "we can 
go the extra mile in terms of environmental protection." 
</P>
<P>
Defended spending money to aid new democracies instead of putting more into 
domestic programs, saying it is important to "help create stable democracies 
that will actively trade with the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Said the federal government should not set itself up as a censor of 
controversial art, but declared, "I am deeply offended by some of the filth 
that I see and to which federal money has gone and some of the sacrilegious, 
blasphemous depictions that are portrayed by some to be art." 
</P>
<P>
He said he had seen "two horrendous examples of what I would call blasphemous 
material that has no business of getting one cent of the taxpayers' money."

<P>
Four suspected car thieves -- who crashed one stolen vehicle and then attempted 
to escape in another -- were seriously injured today when the second vehicle 
collided head-on with a semi-trailer truck, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
The first stolen car was carrying six people when it overturned shortly before 
3:30 a.m. in front of a home on Devonshire Street near Woodman Avenue in 
Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Police were investigating the possibility that the car ended up on the lawn as 
a result of a hit-and-run collision. 
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood residents wakened by the crash saw the car's six occupants climb 
out and attempt to run away. The residents chased and caught two of the 
suspects, Officer Clarence Dean said. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining four ran to the intersection of Sepulveda Boulevard and 
Devonshire Street, where they commandeered a Toyota pickup truck and robbed its 
driver, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The four, two in front and two riding in the bed, drove west to Chatsworth. 
Police said the pickup was traveling at a high speed in the 20500 block of 
Nordhoff Street when it crashed head-on into an eastbound 18-wheel truck. 
</P>
<P>
The front passengers suffered broken legs and internal injuries and the two 
riding in the back also were seriously injured, police said. The driver of the 
semi-trailer truck was not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
The injured, who were not immediately identified, were taken to Northridge 
Hospital Medical Center and West Park Hospital.

FIRST CALIFORNIA CONDOR CHICK HATCHES AT LOS ANGELES ZOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A California condor chick hatched early today at the Los Angeles Zoo, nudging 
the total population of the species up to 35 a day after another condor chick 
hatched in San Diego, a zoo official said. 
</P>
<P>
The latest chick arrived at 4:30 a.m. today and was the first to hatch at the 
Los Angeles Zoo, spokeswoman Cindy Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
The chick, whose gender won't be known for about three months, is named Kareya, 
from the Karok Indian word for "creator of all things." 
</P>
<P>
"Kareya ate its first meal of minced mouse already, and is resting 
comfortably," said zoo spokeswoman Deborah Pollack. 
</P>
<P>
The 5.8-ounce "sparsely feathered, wrinkled and bald" bird emerged after a 
57-day incubation and 72-hour hatching period, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles hatching came 28 hours after a surprisingly strong chick 
hatched without help from keepers at the San Diego Wild Animal Park. 
</P>
<P>
There were only 27 California condors known to exist when all were taken into 
captivity for a breeding program in 1987. Half a dozen more eggs are incubating 
in the captive-breeding programs in Los Angeles and San Diego.

DEMOCRATS RAP BUSH ON BROKEN VOWS, TIMIDITY

<P>
Democratic leaders took the offensive today against President Bush's high 
approval ratings, accusing the President of broken promises and timid 
leadership and vowing to end his "free ride." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the vice presidential nominee on the party's 
losing 1988 ticket, told the Democratic Leadership Council that Bush's campaign 
pledge of no new taxes has become "pure Bushlips." 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen said the Administration has proposed an array of "crypto-taxes" such as 
user fees, surcharges and other levies. He also accused Bush of being too 
worried about public opinion to help emerging democracies around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you imagine Harry Truman hesitating to unveil the Truman Doctrine or the 
Marshall Plan or the Berlin Airlift because he feared public opinion polls? Can 
you imagine John Kennedy doing a poll before he dealt with the Cuban missile 
crisis?" Bentsen asked. 
</P>
<P>
The same theme was sounded by Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) 
</P>
<P>
"Precisely as our principles and values are prevailing throughout the world, 
America's trumpet is sounding an uncertain note," Nunn said. 
</P>
<P>
The often-fractious Democrats were trying to play down their differences today 
as two major party groups met in separate cities to plot strategy for their 
next attempt to recapture the White House. 
</P>
<P>
While the leadership council, dominated by elected officials, met in New 
Orleans, the Democratic National Committee was meeting in Indianapolis.

BAKER BLAMES APARTHEID FOR POVERTY IN S. AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SOWETO, South Africa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III toured this sprawling black township 
today and blamed apartheid for its poverty. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said the contrast between Soweto and the wealth of South Africa's whites 
in nearby Johannesburg is "quite distressing and that's why I said the system 
of apartheid should be abolished as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
The visit came one day after he said the white-run government was committed to 
ending the system of racial separation. 
</P>
<P>
Baker met with Walter Sisulu at the African National Congress leaders' home in 
a neighborhood of small brick houses, visited community centers, a day-care 
center and drove past a squatters' camp erected on an old golf course. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Baker met with South African President Frederik W. de Klerk. A 
senior U.S. official said Baker told him that "what he had done so far was 
courageous in light of the obvious political pressures and restraints he is 
subject to." 
</P>
<P>
In February, De Klerk lifted a 30-year ban on the ANC and released black 
nationalist leader Nelson R. Mandela from jail after 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
Moments before Baker arrived at Sisulu's home today, children, perched on a 
jungle gym, shouted ANC slogans and sang songs honoring Mandela. Baker didn't 
see or hear the children. 
</P>
<P>
Sisulu said: "I told the secretary of state we are very grateful to the people 
of America for the support they gave us over the years and that we are hopeful 
but we are only making a beginning and we will expect more support as the day 
goes by. 
</P>
<P>
"We have particularly mentioned to the secretary . . . lack of facilities for 
proper education, which we consider can be very harmful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have also mentioned . . . the lack of accommodation which is also dynamite 
for violence," Sisulu added. 
</P>
<P>
More than 2 million people live in Soweto but by far the worst conditions are 
in its growing squatter camps such as Mshenguville, which have virtually no 
utilities or drainage. Rows of mobile toilets, inscribed with "Easy Loo Toilet 
Hire," line the garbage-strewn dust tracks between shack dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
Opposite the Sisulu home where the meeting took place, 3- and 4-year-old 
children in a preschool center shook clenched fists in the air and shouted 
"Power, Power" and "ANC, ANC." 
</P>
<P>
Baker, not by nature a spontaneous man, watched some children jumping on a 
trampoline and shook the hands of two infants before being whisked to his next 
appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Baker was flying to Kinshasa, Zaire, for meetings with President Mobutu Sese 
Seko and Angolan guerrilla leader Jonas Savimbi. 
</P>
<P>
Sisulu's organization publicly opposed Baker's meeting with De Klerk but the 
subject wasn't mentioned today until reporters questioned Sisulu, who appeared 
to put the issue behind him. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States realizes no fundamental change has been made but that some 
encouragement should be made. We've had that," Sisulu said.

<P>
The number of AIDS cases in the United States last year increased by 9% over 
1988, the World Health Organization said today. 
</P>
<P>
State and territorial health departments reported 35,238 cases during 1989, 
compared with 32,196 the previous year, WHO's Weekly Epidemiological Record 
showed. 
</P>
<P>
It said the rates of reported cases were highest for blacks and Latinos, for 
people between the ages of 30 and 39, in the Northeast region and U.S. 
territories (primarily Puerto Rico), in the largest metropolitan areas and for 
men. 
</P>
<P>
As in previous years, the report showed, most reported cases occurred among 
homosexuals and bisexual men (56%) and among heterosexual intravenous drug 
users (23%). 
</P>
<P>
The largest proportional declines occurred among children infected with the 
AIDS virus through blood transfusions. It gave no figures.

<TEXT>
<P>
An American who belonged to the Irish Republican Army lost an appeal today of 
his conviction for the 1975 murder of a London policeman. 
</P>
<P>
The Court of Appeal upheld the conviction of William Quinn, 42, who was 
extradited to Britain and sentenced to life in prison in February, 1988, for 
shooting a 21-year-old constable, Stephen Tibble, while fleeing arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn had appealed, claiming faulty identification by a policeman who saw the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
After the shooting, Quinn went to Ireland, where he was jailed for 12 months 
for IRA membership. It was at that trial that he was secretly identified by a 
Scotland Yard detective, Adrian Blackledge, as Tibble's killer. 
</P>
<P>
After his release from an Irish prison, Quinn returned to the San Francisco 
area. Britain requested his extradition, and after a five-year legal fight, he 
was flown to London by the FBI.

U.S. WINS BIG TOKYO CONCESSIONS ON SALE OF SUPERCOMPUTERS

<P>
Negotiators today reported the first breakthrough in the long list of 
contentious trade disputes with Japan -- an agreement designed to open the 
Japanese market to American-made supercomputers. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the U.S. Trade Office said negotiators from both sides 
</P>
<P>
bargained late into the night Thursday, hammering out details of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement represented the first breakthrough on a host of contentious 
trade disputes between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute over sales of supercomputers centered around American demands that 
the Japanese remove various restrictions that have effectively barred U.S. 
companies from selling supercomputers to Japanese universities and government 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"If implemented, we think this will give us full and effective access to the 
Japanese government market," said Timothy O'Leary, an official at the U.S. 
Trade Office. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement reached during two days of talks in Washington, the 
Japanese promised to open up the procurement process for supercomputers to 
foreign firms and to base government decisions on purchases on quality as well 
as price. 
</P>
<P>
The market for supercomputers was one of three areas targeted last year when 
the Bush Administration put Japan on a "hit list" of countries with the most 
onerous barriers to the sale of American products. Talks have also been 
proceeding on the two other products on the list -- U.S. satellites and lumber 
products. But negotiators on those issues have reported that both sides remain 
far apart on American demands to open up those markets. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there have been reports from Tokyo that Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki 
Kaifu is preparing an array of trade concessions in these areas as well. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu and President Bush met last month in California for a hastily arranged 
summit meeting where both leaders pledged to make greater efforts to reduce 
America's huge $49-billion trade deficit with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Access to the government supercomputer market has long been a point of 
contention between the two countries. U.S. firms, in particular Cray Research 
Inc., have dominated the market for the sophisticated machines around the world 
but have been unable to sell their products to the Japanese government. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. negotiators estimate that the potential for sales to the Japanese 
government is about $130 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis McGrath, a spokesman for Cray, said his company will withhold its 
comment until reviewing the details of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope this is more than just a process thing, but something that will 
translate into sales in the marketplace," McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese are under pressure to make concessions on satellites, 
supercomputers and wood products before a June 16 deadline, at which time the 
Bush Administration will have the authority to retaliate by imposing higher 
tariffs on Japanese products. 
</P>
<P>
The talks on specific industries are being conducted under a section of the 
1988 trade law known as Super 301. The Administration is also conducting 
discussions on broader structural impediments.

<P>
Car and light-truck sales by the nation's Big Three auto makers fell 12.2% in 
mid-March compared to the same time last year as the 1990 spring buying season 
got off to a less-than-dazzling start, the companies said today. 
</P>
<P>
The auto makers used incentives and temporary plant closings earlier this year 
to balance production and sales levels, but consumer demand appeared to be 
flagging as the March and April buying season got under way. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler Corp. led the slide, with its combined car and truck sales down 26.6% 
during the period. 
</P>
<P>
General Motors Corp. said sales of its cars and trucks were down 9.5% during 
the period, and Ford Motor Co.'s sales dropped 8.2% 
</P>
<P>
The Big Three sold an average of 31,918 cars and trucks during March 11-20 this 
year, compared to a daily rate of 36,321 during the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
Car sales this year were 13.2% lower than last year and truck sales were down 
10.5%. It was the third consecutive 10-day period that sales dropped compared 
to last year.

An eighth member of Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's new Cabinet today 
acknowledged receiving donations from a company at the center of an 
influence-buying scandal. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to make a sincere apology," said Takashi Fukaya, the post and 
telecommunications minister, at a nationally televised meeting of the upper 
house budget committee. 
</P>
<P>
Fukaya said his support group received more than $5,200 from Recruit Co. over 3 
1/2 years until July, 1988, when the scandal surfaced. He also said his support 
group "mistakenly" continued to receive Recruit money until that November but 
returned all contributions made after August. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve politicians, public officials and Recruit executives are facing charges 
of bribery in connection with the Recruit stock deals. Former Prime Minister 
Noboru Takeshita resigned to take responsibility.

Continuing its buying binge, Crown Cork &amp; Seal Co. Inc. today agreed to buy 
the food and beverage metal canning units of Continental Can Co. Inc. in a 
purchase that will make Crown the nation's biggest maker of metal packaging. 
</P>
<P>
Crown, based in Philadelphia, said it would pay $336 million for the two 
divisions, which have more than 30 U.S. plants and employ 4,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
Continental Can is a unit of Peter Kiewit Sons' Inc. The food and beverage 
metal canning units had 1989 revenues of about $1.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Crown, which had 1989 revenues of $1.9 billion, is already the nation's leading 
maker of crowns and closures for bottles and containers. 
</P>
<P>
In January, Crown bought Continental Can Canada Inc., a unit of CCL Industries, 
for $330 million. The purchase gave Crown more than half of Canada's metal can 
manufacturing market.

The Vatican today unveiled a multimillion-dollar restoration -- paid for by a 
Japanese television network -- of one of the world's greatest art treasures, 
the ceiling Michelangelo painted for the Sistine Chapel. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in hundreds of years visitors will see the whole mammoth 
fresco in its original dazzling colors, freed from four centuries of dust and 
candle smoke. 
</P>
<P>
The Renaissance master took more than 30 years between 1508 and 1541 to paint 
the story of how God created the world and chased Adam and Eve from paradise. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the end result put to rest a bitter controversy over whether the 
$3-million, 10-year restoration damaged the frescoes, project director Fabrizio 
Mancinelli told a news conference: 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to enter into controversy. We did our best, and now we will 
explain what we did with an international conference of experts in Rome." 
</P>
<P>
Smoke from the candles, braziers and torches lighting papal services and 
conclaves to choose a new Pope dulled Michelangelo's work over the centuries. 
</P>
<P>
An exhibition on the restoration, which Pope John Paul II will open Saturday, 
boasts a life-size copy of one section that shows how Michelangelo, standing on 
a platform, had to paint huge, distorted figures to make them look lifelike 
from below.

Doctors moved pop singer Gloria Estefan out of intensive care today and a 
spokeswoman said she was in excellent condition after surgery to fix her back. 
</P>
<P>
"She's excellent . . . feels well and is not in a lot of pain," said Mary 
Costello, a spokeswoman for the Hospital for Joint Diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Costello said the 32-year-old lead singer for the Miami Sound Machine had been 
kept in intensive care as a precaution and was being moved back to a private 
room. 
</P>
<P>
Surgeons operated on the singer for almost 3 1/2 hours Thursday, implanting 
steel rods in her back, which was broken in a highway accident in Pennsylvania. 
She was expected to remain in the hospital for 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
Costello praised Estefan for her unflagging spirit and her concern for other 
patients in the hospital. She kept two dozen white roses and asked that the 
dozens of other floral arrangements and other gifts from fans be shared with 
fellow patients.

"Batman" and "Beetlejuice" director Tim Burton is being deliberately vague 
about his latest project -- "Edward Scissorhands," a suburban fantasy film 
about a man created with shears of metal for fingers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very different," Burton said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to sort of make it up as we go along." 
</P>
<P>
Burton and stars Johnny Depp, Dianne Wiest and Winona Ryder arrived here 
Thursday to start three months of production on the film, scheduled for 
Christmas release. 
</P>
<P>
According to 20th Century Fox, "Scissorhands" is about a man who was created, 
not born. He was given everything he needed to lead a full life, except one 
thing: His inventor's untimely death left Edward with sharp shears of metal 
where his fingers should have been. 
</P>
<P>
He lives in seclusion until he is discovered by an earnest Avon lady and his 
life changes forever. 
</P>
<P>
Preparations for filming have been made in a Tampa neighborhood, where several 
homes have been painted garish colors to create a surreal suburban atmosphere.

One day after reporting the end of a romance between billionaire Donald Trump 
and a former beauty queen, a New York newspaper today said Trump's friend 
secretly lived for weeks in the same building as his wife and children. 
</P>
<P>
The Daily News said Trump had hidden Marla Maples in his luxurious Trump Tower 
building in mid-town Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
"Marla (was) hidden right under Ivana's nose," said the News, calling it, 
"Trump's towering deception." Trump's spokesman declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Maples had eluded the press since news broke last month that Trump's marriage 
with Ivana, a former ski champion, was over. The real-estate developer then 
moved out of the plush family apartment and into a bachelor pad three floors 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
Trump installed the 26-year-old actress-model in an adjoining apartment -- and 
has been visiting her there ever since -- according to the Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
The media's most wanted woman had now moved out, and was again untraceable, it 
said. On Thursday, the News and the New York Post reported that the alleged 
romance between Trump, 43, and Maples was over. Sources close to Trump's 
glamorous 41-year-old wife reportedly told the News that Ivana will file court 
papers Monday that will lay claim to half of Trump's vast empire.

LIZ SMITH: MADONNA TRIES CHANGE OF FACE IN NEW VIDEO

<P>
WHO NEEDS hit movies? That's what I say after getting an advance peek at 
Madonna's to-die-for, utterly fabulous new video called "Vogue." Wait until you 
see Madonna in glorious black and white, singing and vamping in this tribute to 
the glamour goddesses of the past. 
</P>
<P>
The title "Vogue" refers not to the fashion magazine but to the dance style 
where one strikes poses. Madonna says: "It's about attitude . . . giving face . 
. . making the most of what you have!" And does this woman ever "give face"! 
She has never looked so appealing, or so reminiscent of Monroe, Harlow, 
Dietrich. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous videos, this one won't cause any outrageous controversies. 
Madonna is dressed to the teeth (well, OK, let's just say to the bosoms). There 
is no religious imagery and no vulgarity. This is a video even an old-fashioned 
mother might love. 
</P>
<P>
MADONNA'S "Blonde Ambition" tour begins in the summer, to coincide with her 
hotly awaited performance as Breathless Mahoney -- singing and dancing to fresh 
new Stephen Sondheim songs -- in the big-screen movie "Dick Tracy." Oh, yes, 
there's a guy named Warren Beatty in this film, too. There were reports by the 
opposition that Madonna and Warren's romance has died. But last weekend, these 
two took in the new French group Les Negresses Vertes at the Roxy in Los 
Angeles. Madonna sat on Warren's lap, nibbled his ear, and behaved like a woman 
in love. 
</P>
<P>
DON'T SAY I didn't warn you of the possibility that another, very big shoe may 
drop in the Ivana and Donald Trump splituation, and it could happen next 
Monday. But no, Mrs. Trump WON'T be suing for divorce. 
</P>
<P>
BROADWAY HAD another great first night this week when Kathleen Turner sizzled 
into her opening of "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" at the Eugene O'Neill Theater. 
There was a ripple of black-tie civilization that night, hinting of the past 
and making us wonder if civilized theater may really be making a comeback. (We 
had some neat indications of this in "Orpheus Descending," "Grand Hotel," 
"Gypsy," "A Few Good Men," "Tru" and "City of Angels" already this season.) 
</P>
<P>
"Cat" is my least favorite of all Tennessee's plays and I've seen its four 
major versions, including Gadge Kazan's original and the sanitized 1958 movie. 
But who could quibble with any excuse to see Kathleen? 
</P>
<P>
And who can ever resist the poetry of Tennessee Williams, including his great 
closing speech by Maggie about "beautiful weak people who give up too easily"? 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the actor's actor, Charles Durning (coming into his own after a 
long career), as Big Daddy. He brought a truly sensitive and unusual brightness 
to his man-to-man talk with his son Brick, the athletic god who is sinking into 
alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
Don't miss this show. Love it or hate it; you won't be bored.

BEARS SIGN ANDERSON FOR 4 YEARS AT REPORTED $6 MILLION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Neal Anderson, the Chicago Bears' leading rusher and receiver last year, signed 
a new contract today for what a source said was $6 million over four years, a 
figure that would make him the NFL's highest-paid running back. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Rappenecker, Anderson's agent, said from Gainesville, Fla., that the 
agreement will give Anderson more than $5 million over the four years. A source 
close to the negotiations who spoke on condition his name not be used said the 
total actually would be more than $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
That would make him the highest-paid running back in the league on average 
salary per year; Eric Dickerson of Indianapolis made $1.3 million last season. 
Bears' spokesman Bryan Harlan, who did not disclose a salary figure, said the 
deal would make Anderson the highest-paid player in the team's history. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, Anderson had threatened to seek out other teams after the 
Bears withdrew a four-year offer worth an estimated $5.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
"All along I wanted to stay here," he said at the time. "Maybe I made a 
mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Rappenecker said Anderson had been talking to other teams, and "two were very 
interested," though neither provided Anderson with offer sheets. He would not 
name the two teams. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bears were very aggressive in wanting to keep Neal and took the 
initiative," Rappenecker said. "I think Chicago had a good attitude about 
signing Neal from the word go, and even before the word go." 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody's happy. We're happy, the Bears are happy, and hopefully, 
the fans in Chicago are going to be happy," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson was fourth in the NFL with 1,275 yards rushing last season. He also 
led the team with 50 receptions and 15 touchdowns and went to the Pro Bowl for 
the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
Under NFL rules, Anderson had until April 1 to solicit offer sheets from other 
teams, but apparently none materialized. Because he is a restricted free agent, 
the Bears would have the right to match any offer or get two first-round draft 
choices in return if Anderson had signed with another team. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
49ers Sign Center Radloff 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Radloff, an NFL Plan B free agent who was a starting center with the 
Atlanta Falcons from 1986 through 1988, has agreed to a one-year contract with 
the Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Radloff is signing for $275,000 in salary and gets a $40,000 signing bonus 
along with a $50,000 bonus if he is active for the entire season, according to 
the San Francisco Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
John McVay, the 49ers' vice president, said the team would consider using 
Radloff as its starting center and moving Jesse Sapolu, the 1989 starter, back 
to his former position, guard. Radloff, 29, lost his starting job with the 
Falcons last season.

All the Oakland A's regular starters may sit out the spring opener Monday 
against the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure any of our guys are going to be ready for that game," pitching 
coach Dave Duncan said Thursday in naming Joe Slusarski as the Athletics' 
starter against the Cubs at Phoenix Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm considering Stew (Dave Stewart) for the second game. But I'll only let him 
go three innings max, and I'll be counting pitches carefully." 
</P>
<P>
Duncan said he will probably follow Slusarski with roster prospects Joe Klink, 
who led the Class AA Southern League with 26 saves last season, and Reese 
Lambert, who has been in the A's farm system for five years. 
</P>
<P>
Pascual Perez, the last of the New York Yankee's no-show players, is scheduled 
to arrive at spring camp Saturday morning, the club said. 
</P>
<P>
Perez, a 32-year-old pitcher, signed with the Yankees last winter for $5.7 
million over three years. He missed his scheduled appearance at spring training 
camp today. 
</P>
<P>
Perez, delayed by visa problems, originally was expected to fly out of the 
Dominican Republic on Thursday night after picking up his visa that afternoon. 
According to Peter Jameson, the Yankees' assistant to the general manager, the 
pitcher picked up his visa but not his prepaid plane ticket to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Jameson spoke to Perez's wife, Marisela, this morning and was told that Perez 
was "gathering his things." The Yankees then arranged for a flight later today 
out of Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, but Jameson couldn't guarantee Perez 
would make the flight. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Yankees General Manager Pete Peterson said that he was able 
to reach Perez by telephone and that the pitcher had made arrangements to fly 
out Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm satisfied with what he said to us," Peterson said. "He had some personal 
problems that he needed to take care of. We're not overly concerned. We're 
confident that he'll be in shape and ready to pitch." 
</P>
<P>
Dwight Gooden isn't making any predictions about Opening Day. He just wants 
everyone to know he's throwing fine. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, with Mets officials looking on, Gooden threw hard as he pitched 
batting practice for the first time this spring. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt easy," Gooden said. "I'm happy with the way it went." 
</P>
<P>
Gooden pitched for 11 minutes, and Manager Davey Johnson estimated that his ace 
threw in the high 80s m.p.h. Gooden said he was throwing at about 75%.

Former Wisconsin football Coach John Jardine, who underwent a heart transplant 
last year, died this morning of heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
Jardine, 53, who coached the Badgers from 1970 to 1977, was admitted to 
University of Wisconsin Hospital on Wednesday after complaining of shortness of 
breath, hospital spokeswoman Lisa Brunette said. 
</P>
<P>
Jardine's doctor determined that he was in heart failure, but said it wasn't a 
rejection of his transplanted heart, Brunette said. Jardine had a heart 
transplant last June 16 at the hospital after it was determined he suffered 
from cardiomyopathy, a weakening of the heart muscle. He had been on a waiting 
list for a donor heart since December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy will be performed, the hospital announced.

For many baseball executives, the ideal player is a white farm boy from Iowa. 
Many baseball executives were once, not coincidentally, someone very much like 
that themselves. They threw balls against a barn one day and were in the big 
leagues the next. Either that or they played eight years in the Three-I League, 
scratching and spitting and otherwise trying to be the American ideal. 
</P>
<P>
None of them grew up in the Dominican Republic. Or wore heavy gold chains. Or 
spoke Spanish as a first language. Or was dumped at age 16 in a foreign country 
where he couldn't even order dinner. In Pedro Guerrero's first year in America, 
he ordered chicken every night, that being the only food word he knew. He would 
also cry himself to sleep, an experience he shares with virtually every other 
Latin player who makes his way to the United States, where all the fields are 
fields of dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Bautista, raised in a Dominican family of 16 children, arrived at 
Kingsport, Tenn., a farm club of the New York Mets, at age 16. He knew a little 
English, having spent some of his childhood in New York living with an aunt. 
But he didn't know much else, except that he was scared and lonely and couldn't 
figure how he was possibly going to make it. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I cried," he says now. "I cry every night. I want to go home, to be with 
my mother. I was very, very lonely." 
</P>
<P>
He stayed, as many Latins do, because baseball is the most visible route out of 
the poverty that afflicts the Caribbean nations and much of Central America. 
And now, nine years later, Bautista is struggling to find a place in the 
Baltimore Orioles' starting rotation, hoping to be a success story. 
</P>
<P>
But that's hardly the entire story. Here's another part: There was the baseball 
executive who once confided to me that Dominicans were stubborn and 
uncoachable, if not outright dangerous. Then there was a rival general manager, 
in the 1987 season, who said that the Toronto Blue Jays would inevitably fold 
in the stretch because they fielded too many Latin players. 
</P>
<P>
And this, too: Bautista takes aside younger Latin players and warns them 
against speaking Spanish too loudly in the clubhouse. "Some players get mad," 
he says. "They think these guys talking Spanish are talking about them. They 
yell, 'Speak English. Speak English.' " 
</P>
<P>
Latin players are different. Ask anyone. Name your five favorite head cases, 
and I'll bet four of them are Latinos. Who are the hot dogs? Who are the 
malcontents? Who doesn't quite fit in? 
</P>
<P>
"The problem in baseball is that we don't take the time to understand the Latin 
player," Orioles Manager Frank Robinson says. 
</P>
<P>
"We typecast them because that's the easy thing to do. There are cultural 
differences that we don't take into account. Latin culture is different from 
American culture. The language is different. A Latin player might be flashier 
or more flamboyant, but that might be part of his culture. We need to 
understand that." 
</P>
<P>
Bautista has the look. You can't help but notice that. He has a certain swagger 
and wears a certain cut of clothes. Add the gold chains and the designer shades 
and you have a style that was once called machismo. 
</P>
<P>
He pitches that way, too, or so it's popularly understood. He pitches with a 
swagger, trying to fire fastballs past batters who, instead, too often hit them 
out of the park. Last year, he bombed out after some early promise to take his 
place in Rochester. He had a bad back, he says, that he didn't tell anyone 
about, and he had a blistered finger no one could stop from bleeding. No one 
could staunch the bleeding from the mound either. And now, he faces a 
crossroads. 
</P>
<P>
Is Bautista too stubborn to learn? Or is there a language problem that gets in 
the way of the kinds of nuance that make good coaching meaningful? And how can 
you tell the difference? 
</P>
<P>
"For many Latin players, language is the big problem," Robinson said. "They 
can't read a paper. They can't order from a menu. They can't watch TV. And on 
the field, you don't know how much you're saying is being understood. 
</P>
<P>
"Even with Bautista, who speaks pretty good English, you don't know exactly how 
much he understands. A young player is not going to stop you in the middle of 
explaining something and ask you to slow down. If you ask him if he 
understands, he just nods. 
</P>
<P>
"We're asking too much of that player, to be away from home, to speak another 
language when we don't bother to learn his, and then to play baseball, too. 
It's amazing to me how many do make it." 
</P>
<P>
Many do, of course. Just check the rosters. Bautista hopes to be the right kind 
of statistic and says that after nine years the language problems don't amount 
for much in his case. But he says, too, that he translates English into his 
head into Spanish and then answers questions in his head in Spanish and 
translates them back to English. He says it makes him tired sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
He was tired Thursday, but only from running. In the off-season, he pitched 
winter ball, as usual, and worked on straightening out his forkball. He thinks 
he can be a better pitcher this year and is ready to start, relieve or do 
whatever he can to make the club. He isn't worried about not getting a fair 
shake. 
</P>
<P>
"All the players here are treated the same," he says. 
</P>
<P>
They all should be, with Robinson as manager. He understands prejudice, of 
course, having dealt with it. He understands stereotyping, having dealt with 
that, too. In Robinson's day, it was often the black player who didn't fit in, 
who was the hothead, who was the hot dog. And Robinson knows, too, about 
dealing with cultural differences. Once when he was managing in the off-season 
in a small town in Mexico, he left because he couldn't deal with being the only 
person who spoke English. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball must address this situation," Robinson said. "It wouldn't be that 
difficult. In our organization, we should have someone in every town to help 
the Latin players, someone they can turn to when they've got a problem. We 
should have English classes for them, not so they won't speak Spanish, but just 
so they can do the simple things to get along. And why can't managers be 
required to take Spanish classes? We expect them to come over here and adjust 
to us, and we don't make any effort to adjust to them." 
</P>
<P>
Bautista and others try to take in the younger Latin players. They teach them 
how to order from a menu, how to shop at the mall, how to get along with the 
coaches and managers. They talk to them in Spanish about coping in a place 
where only English is spoken, and they talk to them quietly, just so no one 
misunderstands.

Stormy But Valid, winner of two stakes in January, will head a field of six 
older fillies and mares in the $75,000-added Las Cienegas Handicap at Santa 
Anita on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The sprint on the hillside turf course at about 6 1/2 furlongs also has drawn 
Hot Novel, who comes off a victory in the overnight B. Thoughtful Stakes on the 
same layout. 
</P>
<P>
Stormy But Valid opened the winter-spring meeting with victories in the Las 
Flores and Santa Monica Handicaps, both sprints on the main track. Her latest 
start came in the Monrovia Handicap, run on the hill, and she checked in fifth, 
beaten only a length. She had scored in the Life's Magic Stakes at Gulfstream 
Park in November. 
</P>
<P>
With six runners, the Las Cienegas will gross $80,850 and net the winner 
$47,100. 
</P>
<P>
The full field, from the rail: Warning Zone, Alex Solis riding at 116 pounds; 
Hot Novel, Eddie Delahoussaye, 118; Light Ice, Kent Desormeaux, 115; Stormy But 
Valid, Gary Stevens, 120; Sexy Slew, Pat Valenzuela, 113, and Stylish Star, 
117. 
</P>
<P>
Hot Novel was third in both the Santa Monica and Monrovia before capturing the 
B. Thoughtful in her latest try. She has hit the board in each of her three 
starts on this course. 
</P>
<P>
Stylish Star won the Dahlia Handicap at Hollywood Park in December after 
finishing third in the Louis R. Rowan Handicap during the Oak Tree. She 
accounted for the Del Mar Oaks earlier last year. 
</P>
<P>
Warning Zone won the Autumn Days Handicap on the grassy hillside last fall but 
hasn't won since.

YANKS' KELLY HAD SCARE IN PANAMA

Being a major-leaguer might have saved New York Yankees' outfielder Roberto 
Kelly's life during the turmoil this winter in his native Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly said he was stopped by three of then-dictator Manuel A. Noriega's men a 
few days after the United States invaded Panama on Dec. 20. 
</P>
<P>
"I got out of the car and one of them put a gun to my head," Kelly said. "Then 
one of them recognized me and said, 'Are you Roberto Kelly?' I said, 'Yeah,' 
and they let me go." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly, who lives in Panama in the off-season, was driving to pick up his 
brother at the Panama Canal when the incident took place. 
</P>
<P>
"Being a ballplayer saved my life," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
Others were not so fortunate. Kelly lost a good friend, Francisco Rodrigues, 
during the violence. 
</P>
<P>
"He was in the streets and they shot him," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees called their starting center fielder the day after the invasion to 
inquire about his safety and that of his family. They urged him to leave the 
strife-torn country. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted for me to get out, but there was no way I could have gotten out of 
there. The airports were closed," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
He plans to return to Panama after the season. 
</P>
<P>
"As bad as it is down there, I like it. I grew up down there." Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly will have his wife and 2-year-old daughter join him in New York when the 
season begins. His parents, three brothers and two sisters will stay in Panama. 
Noriega may be gone, but Kelly has other reasons to worry about the safety of 
his loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess they're afraid that the police are going to take over, so the police 
have no guns and the thieves run around," Kelly said. "The police are afraid. 
There's no police around to protect you. 
</P>
<P>
"You never know. At any time a gunman can stick you up. You'd better not walk 
around with gold or too much money." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly lost his car in the looting after the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was not unhappy about Noriega's being deposed. 
</P>
<P>
"When we really saw what he was doing, we realized he wasn't the guy for us," 
Kelly said.

NEW YORK POET SHARON OLDS GIVES LAGUNA READING TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PENELOPE MOFFET 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sharon Olds, a highly acclaimed New York writer, will read her poetry in Laguna 
Beach tonight. "As it happens, I've never read in Southern California before," 
she said in a telephone interview. "This will be exciting for me; this will be 
a first." 
</P>
<P>
Although a prolonged bout with bronchitis and flu had forced her to cancel 
several recent East Coast engagements, Olds boarded a plane Wednesday morning 
to be poet-in-residence for three days at Westlake School in Los Angeles and to 
read for the Laguna Poets. 
</P>
<P>
Olds' poetry delves into the dark matrix of relationships within a deeply 
troubled family from the perspective of a younger daughter. She also writes 
poems that address societal issues and poems that celebrate a functional family 
from the mother's point of view. 
</P>
<P>
She has published three books. Her first, "Satan Says," appeared in 1980 and 
won the 1981 San Francisco Poetry Center Award. Her second book, "The Dead and 
the Living," was the 1983 Lamont Poetry Selection of the Academy of American 
Poets and also won the 1984 National Book Critics' Circle Award for Poetry. 
"The Gold Cell," her third book, has also been highly praised. 
</P>
<P>
She is now putting together two new collections and will read new poems 
tonight. "I really like reading work that's pretty fresh," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Olds doesn't have a set time of day for writing but waits until a poem "comes 
to me." "It says to me, 'Don't call us, we'll call you,' " she said. "If I'm 
lucky, a poem will knock on the little door and say, 'I'm ready to be born,' 
and then I'll write it down, I'll take that dictation." 
</P>
<P>
Director of the creative writing program at New York University since 1988, 
Olds "apparently" lives in New York City with her husband, son and daughter. 
"Apparently" is a word that crops up frequently when the conversation turns to 
connections between her disturbing poetry and her life. Fiercely protective of 
her privacy, Olds doesn't want to confirm even the existence of the spouse and 
children who enter so much of her writing. "I've reached a point of complete 
apparent separation between my actual life and my actual work," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Years ago, when she gave readings followed by question-and-answer sessions, 
"the first question would always be 'How old are your children now?' " Olds 
said. "I noticed that I was getting irritated. I wanted to be asked about line 
breaks -- or disarmament. I asked men poets what kinds of questions they were 
asked after readings, and they said, 'Oh, line breaks. Disarmament.' " 
</P>
<P>
The difference, Olds said, "has something to do with being a woman, and 
apparently a mother and a wife. I want to get the center of attention where it 
belongs," on the poems themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Her reticence about her personal life also extends to questions about her early 
family life, which she seems to describe in numerous poems about abusive 
parents and siblings. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know where our poems come from. We don't know what leads them to us, 
and what keeps them from us," Olds said. "It's a gift that's not in our power, 
(although) we can do certain things to try to stay ready for our poems, to 
welcome them. For me, not talking about my life feels sort of superstitiously 
right. It feels like that's part of my bargain, in a way -- I don't know 
exactly what I mean by that. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to protect the poems from the people, and the people from the poems." 
</P>
<P>
Born in San Francisco in late 1942, Olds grew up in the Bay Area. She began 
writing poetry as a child. At 15, she was sent to an East Coast boarding 
school. Later, she earned a bachelor's degree from Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
At 21, Olds moved permanently to New York City. "All my life I wanted to get to 
the Empire State Building and put my arms around it and hang on," she said. 
"I'm in love with New York City. New York is so public. Every day you see a lot 
of strangers. And I like that. It's the opposite of a little house in the 
woods." 
</P>
<P>
She earned a Ph.D. in English from Columbia University in 1972. During graduate 
school, Olds' poetry suffered. "I was trying to write like other people," she 
said. At 30, she found her own voice. 
</P>
<P>
"I was walking away from Columbia with my Ph.D. in my pocket, and I was 
carrying a couple of children, and I was grinning from ear to ear. I had 
finished my degree, and I was free. I would never have to obey anyone again -- 
I thought," she said, laughing. "I made a vow to myself: I'll give up all that 
I've learned, all that this degree represents, just to do my own work and lead 
my own life. What I wanted to do was not let the poem escape, whether it was 
right or wrong, nice or nasty. 
</P>
<P>
"The next day I wrote several poems, and I hadn't written for months. I had hit 
a streak that went on for about five years." During that time, she also taught 
at Sarah Lawrence College, Brandeis University and Columbia, and -- apparently 
-- raised two children. 
</P>
<P>
For the last five years, Olds has supervised a writing program at Goldwater 
Hospital on New York's Roosevelt Island. There, she and a few NYU graduate 
students work with "the Golden Writers," a small group of severely disabled 
poets. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Golden Writers, "no one has the use of their legs; some have some use 
of their hands," Olds said. "Many are quadriplegic, and in addition, some are 
non-speaking. They communicate with devices that range from very primitive to 
very sensitive." 
</P>
<P>
Two poets there can "type" with laser wands strapped around their foreheads and 
directed at light-sensitive computers; for others, the NYU students hold up 
alphabet cards, and the disabled poets indicate the letters of poems with eye 
movements. 
</P>
<P>
"There's lot of remarkable writing being done at Goldwater -- so fearless and 
direct," Olds said. The disabled writers, she said, are "people of very 
exceptional spiritual power. I did desire to learn about that from them." The 
program, initiated by the Very Special Arts Foundation, is now supported 
through fund-raisers, donations from "Friends of the Golden Writers" and 
in-kind support from Very Special Arts, NYU and Goldwater. 
</P>
<P>
Olds gives many readings of her work throughout the year. She also teaches at 
the Squaw Valley Poetry Workshop near Lake Tahoe each summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been teaching without a semester off for 13 years," she said. "I'm 
looking forward to sometime having what I would regard as an ideal writer's 
life, having a year or a semester off to put the poetry at the center" of life, 
rather than always "fitting it in." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, she added, she enjoys traveling and meeting other poets. "I think I get to 
see the best of America, because I see the people who are interested in poetry 
-- people who know they're not going to be rich, but other things matter more 
to them," Olds said. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Olds will read at 8 p.m. at the Laguna Beach Public Library, 363 
Glenneyre St. Tickets are $10.

<P>
they are kids, they are dumb, all they know is they are 
</P>
<P>
innocent, they would never hurt anybody. 
</P>
<P>
I want to go up to them and say Stop, 
</P>
<P>
don't do it -- she's the wrong woman, 
</P>
<P>
he's the wrong man, you are going to do things

<P>
you are going to do bad things to children, 
</P>
<P>
you are going to suffer in ways you never heard of, 
</P>
<P>
you are going to want to die. I want to go 
</P>
<P>
up to them there in the late May sunlight and say it, 
</P>
<P>
her hungry pretty blank face turning to me, 
</P>
<P>
her pitiful beautiful untouched body, 
</P>
<P>
his arrogant handsome blind face turning to me, 
</P>
<P>
his pitiful beautiful untouched body, 
</P>
<P>
but I don't do it. I want to live. I 
</P>
<P>
take them up like the male and female 
</P>
<P>
paper dolls and bang them together 
</P>
<P>
at the hips like chips of flint as if to 
</P>
<P>
strike sparks from them, I say 
</P>
<P>
Do what you are going to do, and I will tell about it.

Accompanied by a small army of companions, including her business manager, 
agent, several Realtors and a reporter, Julia Roberts spent a cold, blustery 
night recently poking around a stylish little home near the top of Benedict 
Canyon. Before the slender young actress could field queries about her 
skyrocketing career, she had a more important decision to make. Should she buy 
the house? 
</P>
<P>
Peppering the owners with questions, Roberts studied the outdoor Jacuzzi, with 
its spot-lit fountain. She eyed the kitchen, stopping to stare at a 
refrigerator with a see-through door. She prowled around the cozy bedroom, 
which offered a spectacular view of the hills. 
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old actress playfully fiddled with a video camera trained on the 
bed. "Geez!" she said, turning to the home-owners with mock surprise. "I wonder 
what y'all have been taking pictures of. Can you show 'em on the TV over 
there?" 
</P>
<P>
After a pair of whispered huddles, Roberts swept out of the house, slid into 
her new BMW convertible and roared off down the canyon. "Hey, the furniture's 
gotta go, but what a great house, huh?" she enthused as she navigated the 
rain-slicked street. "It's beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
Was she going to make an offer? "Make one?" she laughed. "I already did! I'm 
gonna buy it. They told me if I waited till tomorrow, it'd be gone!" 
</P>
<P>
Roberts let out a wild whoop as she slid through a tight turn. "My boyfriend is 
gonna die when he hears I bought a house!" She cackled with glee. "He keeps 
telling me I've got to own things. So first, I bought this car. And then he 
told me I oughta get a house." 
</P>
<P>
She came out of the next turn, pumping the accelerator and speeding down toward 
Sunset Boulevard. Buying a $1 million hilltop house gets the adrenaline 
flowing. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember telling him, 'Why do I need a house?' And he said, 'Well, you gotta 
have a place to park the car!' " 
</P>
<P>
Everything is happening fast for Julia Roberts these days. Barely three years 
after she first earned accolades for her spicy performance in "Mystic Pizza," 
she's won a Golden Globe and been nominated for a best supporting actress Oscar 
for her role in "Steel Magnolias." 
</P>
<P>
According to the current issue of US magazine, she's also one of today's Top 10 
screen goddesses, right up there with Michelle Pfeiffer, Kim Basinger and 
Melanie Griffith. More importantly, the Hollywood Buzz about Roberts has 
catapulted her from a star-struck newcomer best known as Eric Roberts' little 
sister to a formidable member of the elite $1 million-a-movie actress club. 
</P>
<P>
"You could definitely say the phone has been ringing," explains her agent, 
Elaine Goldsmith, a vice president at the William Morris Agency. "The reaction 
we've gotten has been incredibly positive. People really feel she's one of a 
kind." 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to see Roberts' appeal on screen. Whether she's playing a feathery 
small-town beauty in "Steel Magnolias" or a sassy Hollywood Boulevard hooker in 
"Pretty Woman," which opens today, she has a voluptuous voltage that sends 
sparks shooting off the movie screen. Enamored by her spunky personality and 
full-lipped sex appeal, smitten critics have tossed bouquets at her feet. 
</P>
<P>
The Times' Michael Wilmington called Roberts' performance in "Mystic Pizza" "a 
minor triumph," adding that the actress "shows a priceless movie quality: a 
real sense of danger and unpredictability." 
</P>
<P>
In person, devouring a hamburger at her favorite Irish pub, Roberts doesn't 
radiate so much sizzle. A willowy woman with keen, inquisitive eyes, long arms 
and an unruly mane of auburn hair, she has the coltish, Southern charm of a 
character out of a Truman Capote story. 
</P>
<P>
Told that she appears more diminutive than she does on-screen, Roberts seems 
mildly chagrined. 
</P>
<P>
"I know, that's what everyone says -- I feel like such a disappointment," she 
says. "For months after 'Mystic Pizza,' I had 20 different people say, 'Gee, we 
thought you were 6-feet tall.' But I am 5-8. She shrugs. "Even though I always 
did want to be 6-0." 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a baggy jacket and faded jeans, Roberts looks more like a poetry major 
than a budding sex symbol. Spend an evening with her and you'll discover she's 
a free spirit who likes to roam around barefoot, has memorized the entire Elvis 
Costello songbook and enjoys her privacy (she talks endlessly about her 
boyfriend, but never reveals his name, though gossip columns have linked her to 
actor Kiefer Sutherland). 
</P>
<P>
She also takes pride in her ability to keep cool, even in the midst of her 
tumultuous career rise. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm what you'd call a decision-action person," she says, sipping a vodka and 
cranberry juice. "I make a decision and I act on it. If I decide I'm going to 
have dinner or buy a house, I do it. But the last few months have been really 
crazy. I can't have a simple dinner. I don't even have time to read a book. My 
whole life's mapped out for me. I just try to be grateful that I have so much 
work that I can be worrying about all this." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Smyrna, Ga., Roberts comes from a family of actors. But you get the 
feeling she didn't have a storybook childhood. "My childhood was real weird to 
me," she says quietly, with a trace of a Southern accent. "I feel like I grew 
up twice. Once till I was about 10. After that it was completely different." 
</P>
<P>
She tugs at a strand of hair. "My father died around then, which probably 
changed me a lot more than I realized. It was just a rough time. My fondest 
memories are from high school, when I'd hang around with my best friend, Page. 
We'd have tuna sandwiches and Diet Coke, watch soap operas and talk about what 
we wanted to do with our lives when school was over." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts couldn't wait to get out of school -- and out of town. "I knew if I 
stayed in Smyrna I'd have to go to the University of Georgia or get married," 
she said with a wry laugh. "And I gotta tell you -- higher education wasn't for 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, she moved to New York and began studying acting. "I gotta admit I 
really didn't know what else I could do. I'd go to all these auditions and I 
remember getting so excited about getting a call-back or just meeting the 
director." She laughed, half at herself. "Now I'm asking -- is the director 
going to be there? If not, I'm not going!" 
</P>
<P>
After landing a part in "Crime Story" at age 18, Roberts appeared in a string 
of low-budget films, including "Satisfaction," HBO's "Baja Oklahoma" and 
"Mystic Pizza." 
</P>
<P>
"Julia was real smart," recalled Donald Petrie, director of "Pizza" and the 
upcoming film, "Opportunity Knocks." "Before she auditioned, she put a rinse in 
her hair to make it jet black, like the color of the Portugese-descent 
character she played in the film. And hey, it worked. It made her look exotic 
and perfect for the part." 
</P>
<P>
Petrie was especially dazzled by Roberts' screen presence. "She has a wonderful 
spontaneity on screen that really makes her light up. Most actors have that in 
their eyes. But Julia has it in her eyes -- and her face and everywhere. She's 
the kind of actress you want to shoot without a rehearsal because she's so 
quirky that you never know what you'll get." 
</P>
<P>
Petrie said he hopes Roberts doesn't get "locked into the pattern you see with 
someone like Kim Basinger" and be typecast as a sex object. Roberts has similar 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, in 'Satisfaction' I was this boy-crazy peacock. And in 'Baja' I was the 
most gorgeous girl in town. It was like a pattern, always having to look great. 
That's why I loved doing 'Steel Magnolias,' to play a whole different 
character." 
</P>
<P>
For "Pretty Woman," a Touchstone film which features Roberts as a hooker with a 
heart of gold, Roberts spent time with area prostitutes researching her part. 
"It wasn't easy," she said. "They obviously didn't want to talk, so I'd take 
them out to Del Taco -- which is where they liked to eat -- and got to work 
with them, watching them work in a strip joint. 
</P>
<P>
"It was sad because you realized that the girl who took off the most clothes on 
stage got the most money. They have a view of men -- and life -- that no one 
should have to live with." 
</P>
<P>
"Pretty Woman" opts for a glossier version of hookerdom, though Roberts got a 
dose of raw sexism shooting the film, especially when wearing a revealing 
outfit for several on-location scenes from the movie. "Just wearing that dress 
was awful!" she recalled. "I'd get catcalls and stupid remarks from guys on the 
street when we'd be doing exteriors. It wasn't fun at all. I felt so offended. 
I don't get that in real life." 
</P>
<P>
Touchstone Pictures president David Hoberman raved about Roberts' performance. 
"She's very magnetic," he said. "She has that rare ability to invite you into 
the role she's playing." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Roberts had to campaign to get the part. "She was not an automatic," 
said Elaine Goldsmith, her agent. "Disney tested her for the part -- and she 
had to wait till the 11th hour before she got it. The studio was reticent about 
casting her until they'd cast the male lead. Finally, we told them she would 
take another movie, so they finally agreed and signed her." 
</P>
<P>
Since making "Pretty Woman," Roberts has co-starred in "Flatliners," a medical 
school thriller with Kevin Bacon and Kiefer Sutherland that is due out this 
summer. And she's just began shooting "Sleeping with the Enemy," where she 
plays a battered wife who rebels against her oppressive husband. 
</P>
<P>
"She's no flash in the pan," says Hoberman, who downplayed rumors that 
Touchstone is trying to sign her exclusively. "I'd love to tell you she's 
committed to a deal, but she's not. But we'd certainly like to work together 
again." 
</P>
<P>
For now, Roberts is laying low, though if she wins an Oscar Monday, you can bet 
her $1-million asking price will rise. "After 'Sleeping,' she's going to take a 
break," says Goldsmith. "If people want her now, they're going to want her a 
year from now." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts is trying to keep in perspective. "I sometimes lose it a little in the 
middle of a tough day," she said, driving back home at nearly midnight. 
"Winning an award like the Golden Globe made me incredibly giddy and happy, but 
it was also very humbling. 
</P>
<P>
"I told myself, 'What's there to get so carried away with?' I got honored, but 
it was my work. I put my heart and soul into it. And I know that I have to move 
on now and challenge myself to do better." 
</P>
<P>
She flashed a weary grin. "You can't hang on to a Golden Globe forever." 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A shiny black Volvo, complete with chauffeur, takes Vytautas Landsbergis to 
work these days. A uniformed guard stands outside his apartment building, and 
he has traded his corduroy jacket with elbow patches for a rumpled suit. 
</P>
<P>
But Landsbergis, 57, a professor of music known for his political inexperience, 
pedantic speeches and slow, methodical approach to life, is still one of the 
most unlikely national leaders -- a bespectacled, mild-mannered grandfather who 
defied the Kremlin to become president of a Lithuania now asserting its 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
In the last several days, he has been in the eye of the storm, striving to 
maintain calm in his republic as Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev steps up 
pressure on Lithuanians to denounce their Parliament's declaration of 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
But stern warnings from the Kremlin should be viewed as nothing more than a 
negotiating tactic, Landsbergis told his countrymen Wednesday night after 
Gorbachev demanded that all Lithuanians turn in their weapons and ordered the 
KGB to tighten security around the republic's borders. Lithuanians, Landsbergis 
said, should remain firm in the conviction that "wisdom will prevail . . . 
(and) we'll meet tomorrow serene and united." 
</P>
<P>
Landsbergis, who wears a goatee and walks slightly hunched over, became the 
first non-Communist chief of a Soviet republic earlier this month, hours before 
Lithuania's lawmakers adopted a resolution declaring independence. He defeated 
his Communist rival, the popular Algirdas Brazauskas, by a margin of more than 
2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
Many Lithuanians are still asking how he did it. 
</P>
<P>
The answer, his supporters say, can be found in his patient, diplomatic 
approach to resolving the conflicts that could have short-circuited Lithuania's 
two-year drive for independence. This approach earned him the nickname Gudri 
Lape, Lithuanian for Shrewd Fox. 
</P>
<P>
"He is kind of the unity candidate; he brings everyone together," said Stasys 
Kropas, a deputy in the Lithuanian Parliament and a member of the independence 
movement Sajudis, which Landsbergis helped to found. 
</P>
<P>
Another lawmaker and Sajudis member, Mecys Laurinkus, agreed with this 
assessment. 
</P>
<P>
"He has been the main generator of ideas in Sajudis and has maintained 
stability inside the movement," Laurinkus said in an interview. "He is 
analytical and has intuition. The slogans and the facade of Sajudis are very 
well known to Lithuanians. But Prof. Landsbergis has worked behind the scenes, 
trying to do the real work of policy." 
</P>
<P>
But even his supporters, among them Lithuanian-American Jurate Kazickas, 
recognize his weak points. Kazickas, who is visiting Vilnius, described a 
dinner given for Landsbergis last summer in a townhouse on New York's upper 
East Side and attended by a number of New York luminaries. 
</P>
<P>
"When he stood up to speak," she recalled, "people were sort of straining to 
hear, and as he talked, his head seemed to get lower and lower and lower. 
Sometimes you kind of wish he was a Lech Walesa personality, more dynamic, 
which is the same complaint the people of Lithuania have. But he is a good man, 
and that goodness shines through." 
</P>
<P>
His critics are harsher, wondering aloud how he can possibly negotiate the 
terms of independence with a smooth politician like Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
"He talks too long, he has no charisma, he speaks like a professor, kind of 
lecturing all the time," said Brazauskas supporter and former government 
spokesman Ceslovas Jursenas. "We need a leader who can get to the point fast, 
who can be short and sharp. If this man in this elevated position is going to 
talk this way, it is going to bore us." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about himself, Landsbergis is reserved, far more willing to discuss his 
ideals. 
</P>
<P>
"In my speech in which I presented myself as a candidate for the presidency of 
the Supreme Council," he told a news conference last week, "I emphasized what I 
believe to be fundamental, the desire of our people to be free and 
independent." 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, Landsbergis came naturally by his role as a revolutionary leader. 
It was almost his birthright. His paternal grandfather, Gabrielius, was a 
journalist and playwright who struggled against czarist rule in the late 19th 
Century, writing for underground newspapers in the outlawed Lithuanian language 
about the need for a free Lithuania. Imprisoned and deported for his 
activities, he never lived to see his goals realized. 
</P>
<P>
But he passed his values on to Landsbergis. Lithuania's president "has the 
heart and soul of his grandfather," according to his father, a well-known 
architect, also named Vytautas, who fought with the underground against the 
Nazis in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"In some sense, I'm continuing the work of my grandfather, because our goal is 
the same," Landsbergis said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Landsbergis was just 11 years old when his teen-age brother was arrested by the 
Germans for taking part in Lithuanian nationalist demonstrations. By dint of 
repetition, the idea was soon ingrained: For the sake of self-preservation, the 
Lithuanian nation must shake off foreign rule. 
</P>
<P>
But Landsbergis, a man of restraint as well as action, patiently bided his 
time. A studious, serious youth, he was arrested only once and held briefly 
after inadvertently wandering into a restricted zone. 
</P>
<P>
As an adult, he threw himself into music, becoming an accomplished pianist as 
well as a music historian. He has written nine books about music and recorded 
two albums. 
</P>
<P>
But he wove the language of politics into his esoteric work, specializing in 
the study of Miklayos Ciurlionis, a nationalist 19th-Century Lithuanian 
composer and painter whose art was banned by the Soviet government until three 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Only in the last two years, after helping to found Sajudis, has he been forced 
to squeeze in time for his music between political activities -- perhaps one of 
his biggest frustrations in his current role. 
</P>
<P>
"He has become purely a politician, something we never believed would happen," 
said his 35-year-old daughter, Birute Cechanaviciene, an organist and 
musicologist. "But this is a very important time for all Lithuanians, and it 
was not he who came to politics. It was politics that came to him." 
</P>
<P>
The road he has set out on is likely to be a difficult one. The day of his 
election brought his first conflict as president -- with Brazauskas, a fiery 
orator who was urging his countrymen to delay before declaring independence. 
</P>
<P>
The difference in the two men's styles was demonstrated when the Lithuanian 
Parliament opened its historic session this month. As hundreds of people stood 
outside, Brazauskas arrived in a big white car, impeccably dressed, smiling and 
waving as the crowd chanted his name. 
</P>
<P>
While Landsbergis' supporters were wondering when he would show up, the future 
president was already sitting in the chambers, having slipped in through a back 
door. 
</P>
<P>
After losing to Landsbergis, an angry Brazauskas rejected a role in the new 
government and fled to Moscow, returning only three days later. But he has 
softened his stand and agreed to serve as deputy prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Landsbergis lives with his second wife, Grazina, in a two-story, 
five-room apartment, a five-minute drive from the Parliament building and his 
plush new corner office, complete with seven 
</P>
<P>
telephones. 
</P>
<P>
His apartment is cluttered with mementos that give away his aristocratic 
background -- vases, crystal, antiques -- objects his family was able to hide 
when the Soviets were nationalizing the property of the wealthy here after they 
annexed the republic in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
The apartment also boasts a baby grand piano and an imported stereo system. But 
the figurative heart of the home can be found up the wooden spiral staircase, 
on the second floor, in Landsbergis' study, which is decorated with modern art 
and a worn Persian rug and piled floor-to-ceiling with books, newspapers and 
magazines in a variety of languages. 
</P>
<P>
In a corner is his desk, and right next to it a bed, unmade when a reporter 
visited, the sheets and blankets pushed aside as though Landsbergis had leaped 
out and, without looking back, rushed to another session of Parliament, another 
planning meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Life is so hectic now," said his wife, the only person home at the time. "I'm 
very concerned about his sleeping habits." 
</P>
<P>
It is the details as often as the historic resolutions that keep Landsbergis up 
late. His attention to minutiae was made clear in a meeting attended by 
journalists the day before independence was declared. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies were discussing what Lithuania should choose as the melody for its 
new national anthem, "Lithuania Our Homeland." 
</P>
<P>
Someone suggested one tune, but Landsbergis rose to argue. He said that because 
the proposed melody was in F-sharp, it would be too difficult to sing. He led 
the deputies in a half-hour discussion of the topic, as though it were the most 
important issue he faced. 
</P>
<P>
He finally won his point -- a victory that seemed as important to Landsbergis 
the aristocratic musician as winning the presidency a day later would be to 
Landsbergis the revolutionary politician.
