DRUG-TEST DECISIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court last week began the process of 
delineating how far the federal government can go in using blood and urine 
tests to help curb drug abuse on the job. 
</P>
<P>
These cases have propelled the court into a new and perplexing area of 
constitutional law. In one decision, the majority made a convincing argument 
that the need to ensure the safety of railway passengers supersedes traditional 
search-and-seizure strictures. In the other ruling, the minority made what 
seems to us a persuasive argument that, by approving testing as a condition of 
employment, the court had done damage to Americans' freedom from unreasonable 
searches. 
</P>
<P>
In the first case, Skinner vs. Railway Labor Executives, the court upheld a 
federal regulation directing that all crew members of trains involved in 
serious accidents be tested for drug use. In its ruling, the court acknowledged 
that, in most instances, the probable cause which makes a search legal must 
derive from a suspicion of individual wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
However, Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote the majority opinion, argued that 
train crews have a diminished right to privacy because they "discharge duties 
fraught with such risks of injury to others that even a momentary lapse of 
attention can have disastrous consequences." 
</P>
<P>
In the second case, National Treasury vs. Von Raab, the court decided that the 
U.S. Customs Service could make drug tests a condition of employment in some 
jobs. Here, the reasoning of the minority was more compelling. 
</P>
<P>
Writing in dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia called the Customs Services program 
"a kind of immolation of privacy and human dignity in symbolic opposition to 
drug use . . . Symbolism, even symbolism for so worthy a cause as the abolition 
of unlawful drugs, cannot validate an otherwise unreasonable search."

A DATE WITH COUSIN O'KEEFFE; 
</P>
<P>
IN IRELAND, UNDERSTANDING HER IS GENETIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM O'KEEFFE, Tom O'Keeffe is a prize-winning short-story writer who lives 
in Ireland and teaches part of the year at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What I know of Georgia O'Keeffe and her art is almost entirely confined to 
images on calendars. Yet I must celebrate her, if only for personal reasons. 
It's enough for me that she kept intact the beautiful name brought by her 
grandfather from Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
In the middle of the last century, an O'Keeffe rarely survived the Atlantic 
passage without losing some part of his identity. Typically, the double "f" 
disappeared under the pen of some bureaucrat on that shore or this -- beauty, 
if you like, tossed overboard in the interests of utility and speed. So I'm 
happy to encounter the name in its classic shape. And now with an exhibition of 
O'Keeffe's work on Los Angeles' horizon, the signature has set sail for the 
Pacific Coast, though under a very different kind of canvas. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce O'Keeffe must have been a special kind of immigrant. Like many another, 
he could have mutilated or even scuttled his identity. Famine Ireland was a 
country he surely wanted to forget, with his failed wool business and a million 
O's and Mac's dying in the ditches. Yet he neither disowned his name nor 
considered it a thing of movable parts. 
</P>
<P>
Not so long ago at the port of New York, I was false to his spirit. Just off 
the Atlantic along with my trunk, I was bound for the Southern California town 
of Camarillo. All my labels clearly said so. But a dispatcher propelling her 
Magic Marker had other ideas. "Mr. O'Keith," I heard her saying to herself, 
"one trunk, freight, Amarillo." It took another dispatcher to convince her that 
there is indeed a place called Camarillo. But only after I had cried out, 
"Change my name if you must, but for heaven's sake don't change my 
destination!" 
</P>
<P>
So I reached California almost by detour. A bit like the O'Keeffe paintings; 
they'll arrive here after a year on the road, according to reports tracing 
their travels. 
</P>
<P>
But nowhere have I seen mention of the exhibition of O'Keeffes I attended last 
summer, so I'm reviewing it here for the first time. It was held without 
curator's writ and with little advance publicity. Yet Georgia O'Keeffe would 
have been pleased with the event, I think, held as it was in an Irish valley 
that is ancestral home to everyone of her name. 
</P>
<P>
It's a long way from the elegant County Museum of Art beside the La Brea Tar 
Pits to the tiny community hall in the valley of the Blackwater in the County 
of Cork. Not that the Blackwater is without elegance. You can catch the 
reflection of Tudor ruins on the smooth-sliding river. Yes, the Elizabethans 
were here. One of them, Spenser, the famous poet, dispossessed the O'Keeffes. 
The dispossessed responded with their own kind of elegance -- Gaelic lament. 
</P>
<P>
I had heard about the Irish exhibition of O'Keeffes just days before. They 
were, explained the woman on the phone, mustering that weekend. The caller was 
one of them, five names away from me in the Tipperary directory. They were 
spreading the news by telephone tree among thousands of listed O'Keeffes. Would 
I pass the word about our first gathering to five others? Within the hour, I 
had given my five tribal shouts. 
</P>
<P>
When Gathering Day dawned, I rose with the sun. Before me lay at least a 
hundred humpbacked bridges, so I sat down to a sensible breakfast, something 
that would travel well. I ate coarse bread spread with country butter, and a 
spray of watercress. An O'Keeffe tackling ancestral roads must always breakfast 
on watercress. 
</P>
<P>
Then I headed south for the valley of the Blackwater. And only miles into the 
journey, I began to understand something I had never fully understood -- the 
emotion of Americans in Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
There I was, like all my namesakes, pressing madly on the gas, trying to throw 
history into reverse and to repossess for a day the green valley that Edmund 
Spenser and Walter Raleigh had stolen. Something of Georgia O'Keeffe was also 
making the journey. And why not? I know it seems a far cry from that 
well-watered land to her desert home, but in New Mexico some remember that her 
speech carried echoes of the Blackwater valley. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't stop for Spenser's castle, Kilcolman. It's just rubble, the place 
where the poet dined and smoked with Raleigh, and suggested that the Irish must 
ultimately be famished. The famous moat in which the O'Keeffes once beheld 
their reflections is now waterless. 
</P>
<P>
What did those images look like, I wondered. Slightly Basque, like their 
descendant's? There is no classic painting from that time, but there is a 
word-portrait, itself a classic. It is Spenser's picture of the dispossessed as 
they edged toward the greens on his moat: "Out of every corner of the woods 
they came creeping, like anatomies of death. They spake like ghosts crying out 
of their graves. And if they found plot of watercress or shamrock, there they 
flocked as to a feast." 
</P>
<P>
Before long, enough of them had the strength to rise up and burn Kilcolman 
down. Spenser, pursuing his Faerie Queene in London, never went back. 
</P>
<P>
Between the hedges of snowy whitethorn, we the O'Keeffe survivors had our day 
in the sun. Later, inside the community hall, a historian chronicled the name; 
he began with the shadowy Owen and ended with Georgia: "Last year there died an 
American painter -- Georgia O'Keeffe. Her grandfather left Blackwater at the 
height of the Great Famine. Here is her book." Not far from where he spoke, the 
Blackwater still irrigates the garden in which Raleigh experimented with the 
potato that would famish nearly all the O'Keeffes. 
</P>
<P>
Then the packed hall drank to all who had left and to all who had stayed. And 
as I was leafing through "Georgia O'Keeffe's Art and Letters," I was struck by 
her companion Juan Hamilton's recollection: "In the kitchen was a basket of 
dark green watercress that had been freshly picked from a mountain stream."

WHO'S IN CHARGE OF THE INTERIOR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even his political opponents believe Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan Jr. 
of New Mexico is a truly nice and well-meaning person. But more than a few of 
his friends, as well as critics, are convinced that Lujan is in over his head 
as chief of an agency that is instrumental to President Bush's desire to become 
known as the environmental President. 
</P>
<P>
This view was reinforced Thursday by news accounts of a session between the 
former congressman from New Mexico and a small group of reporters invited by 
Lujan to his office to discuss Interior issues. Particularly embarrassing was 
Lujan's failure to understand some of the very basic facts about how his 
department administers the nation's public estate. For instance, Lujan 
incorrectly insisted that the government receives royalty payments on minerals 
gotten from mining claims that had been sold by the government to claim 
holders. 
</P>
<P>
When told of the error, The Times' Douglas Jehl reported, Lujan expressed 
amazement and asked: "We don't get any royalties? We don't get any money?" Then 
he added, "I didn't know what I was talking about. " 
</P>
<P>
An official new to a sprawling department with a $10-billion budget -- Lujan 
was selected for the post in late December and confirmed in February -- might 
be excused for not knowing such seemingly obscure details. But Lujan dealt 
constantly with these very same issues for 20 years as a congressman from New 
Mexico, an important mining state, and as a longtime member of the House 
Interior Committee. The sale of patented claims for as little as $2.50 an acre, 
stemming from the Mining Claims Act of 1872, has been a matter of considerable 
controversy for years. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the same discussion, Lujan seemed confused about how the department 
leases land for coal mining. This is only a symptom of the problems at 
Interior, however, which is described by some insiders as an agency adrift and 
riddled with depression and dissension. 
</P>
<P>
When Lujan accepted the nomination, it was with the understanding that all the 
key officials under former Secretary Donald P. Hodel would be replaced. The 
clean-sweep concept presumably was Bush's way of ridding himself of the 
anti-environment image of Interior under Ronald Reagan's secretaries, including 
James G. Watt and Hodel, a Watt confidant. 
</P>
<P>
But so far, most of the top jobs requiring Senate confirmation have not been 
filled. Career Interior officials say that a few Hodel holdovers, although they 
have been given notice, remain entrenched in key positions and continue to 
exercise authority while they wait for their official departure dates, which 
often are weeks away. News reports have noted that false stories spread by some 
in this clique led to Lujan's firing of the department's respected 
congressional liaison staffer, who had been recommended for a top Interior 
appointment. Word is that Lujan later apologized to the victim, but took no 
other action. 
</P>
<P>
After Thursday's meeting with reporters, a Lujan aide said that at least people 
would know they have a human secretary of the Interior. But that never was a 
question. Lujan was well-liked during his long service in Congress. What the 
people want, and need, is a secretary who will take charge of the Interior 
Department and rescue it from the harshly exploitative and political mind-set 
of the last eight years. Lujan must demonstrate this ability soon.

GROWTH IN L.A. AND 'VIGILANTE PLANNING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Vigilante Planning," editorial, March 7: 
</P>
<P>
In this day of sound bites, story "spin" and media imagery, city planning 
issues are frequently cast in a manner reminiscent of Hollywood Westerns, 
complete with good guys, bad guys and horseback justice. Whether the context is 
an OK Corral or a Lonesome Dove, the flickering image of planning is still the 
same -- that of a community obsessed with conflicts, past and present, and 
having little interest in looking ahead to positive solutions for the future. 
</P>
<P>
The real fact is that the curtain has not opened on the next major scene. 
Planning initiatives are already under way, though not yet before the public 
eye, which seek to resolve differing public perspectives, compel creative 
thinking and require effective long-term solutions in fashioning a city for the 
21st Century. Heralded in November by the LA 2000 report, a series of major 
actions are now being taken to set the stage for effective long-term solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A long-range growth management plan is being fashioned which will look 
beyond current infrastructure shortages and answer the basic questions: How 
much should we grow? By when? In which areas of Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
 -- The rezoning of the city to match the adopted community plans is nearly 
complete. This makes community plans, not zoning, the guiding land use 
documents to be implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An ambitious citizen participation program is being put into place. During 
1989, 10 community plan advisory committees will be formed to help formulate 
revisions to community plans and to monitor the implementation of these 
revisions. Within five years, all 35 community plan areas in the city will have 
citizen committees. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A site plan ordinance will soon be before the City Council for approval. 
This will assure public hearings and careful decision-making on major projects 
which previously only required a building permit without public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Public notice is being extended on public hearings to residents and 
property owners within 500 feet of a proposed development instead of 300 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Design workshops are being held and specific plans prepared to protect and 
enhance the quality of life in our neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 -- New air quality planning under way will bring jobs and housing closer 
together, and provide new ride-sharing and transit opportunities so that people 
can participate directly in cleaning up the air they breathe. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A new transportation plan is being prepared, and a parking ordinance being 
forwarded for City Council approval. Together, these will, over a period of 
time, help lessen traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A child-care ordinance recently approved by the city Planning Commission 
will provide incentives for developers to build child-care facilities on-site 
at the parents' places of employment. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An open space zone will be placed on all publicly owned open space, such as 
parks, to guard against their conversion to inappropriate uses. 
</P>
<P>
We are turning the corner on city planning -- demolishing the makeshift stage 
on which these dramas have been played out for the media and formulating a new 
vision of what this community can become with the help and involvement of its 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
What we are fashioning now is a way to plan our city and communicate with one 
another which will serve us well into the 21st Century, offering the hope that 
our most cherished dreams can be realized, while the past dramas are relegated 
to the old film library.

'ACCEPTABLE RISKS' WITH PESTICIDES USED ON FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to Dr. Whelan's column, I've always had trouble understanding the 
disproportionate increase in childhood cancers. When I was growing up in the 
'30s, cancer was considered in illness of old age; cancer in children was so 
rare it was considered on aberration. 
</P>
<P>
And, even allowing for the fact that our population has more than doubled in 
the last 50 years, there still doesn't seem to be an explanation for today's 
hospital wards full of children with cancer, unless the combination of man-made 
toxins in our water supply, in our food supply and in our air is simply more 
than some young immune systems are able to tolerate.

OPERATION RESCUE AND POLL ON ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to your article "Soldier in a 'Holy War' on Abortion" (Part I, 
March 17), Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry is incorrect in his initial 
assumption. The anti-abortion movement is not about dead fetuses as he would 
like people to believe. 
</P>
<P>
The whole anti-abortion movement actually is about families with more children 
than they can reasonably take care of. It's about irresponsible and incompetent 
parenting and parents who make excuses for their incompetence and the child's 
behavior. It's about an extreme lack of discipline in the home. It's about 
children who are not cared for or wanted from birth and who have to raise 
themselves or join gangs in order to feel as if they're part of a family; it's 
about a generation of children who are drug addicts in order to relieve the 
pain of having no love in their lives. It's about our inner-city schools being 
unable to educate due to the fact that they're essentially "battle zones." It's 
about excessive overcrowding due to irresponsible social and religious 
attitudes and actions. It's about not allowing free access to information on 
birth control. 
</P>
<P>
The emotions that the anti-abortion backers whip up are only a smoke screen for 
the fact that they desire nothing less than to control the minds, lives and 
wallets of multitudes of people. 
</P>
<P>
Strong emotions cloud the mind and obliterate the thinking. Remove the 
emotional content that these people use in their rhetoric and you find nothing 
but manipulation, hostility, and a desire for control.

OPERATION RESCUE AND POLL ON ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your story on Randy Terry of Operation Rescue contained the inevitable quote 
from a civil rights leader from the 1960s, in this case Julian Bond, belittling 
comparisons made between Operations Rescue and the desegregation demonstrations 
of that era. The demurrers of these leaders in general, and Bond in particular, 
cannot be sustained. 
</P>
<P>
In general, the civil rights leaders who object to the comparisons with their 
movement both fail to appreciate this country's long history of civil 
disobedience for various causes and, at the same time, manifest a rather 
condescending attitude. Their attitude implies that the rights that they sought 
to uphold were superior to the rights sought by every other group engaged in 
civil disobedience. Not only is this parochial, it is clearly wrong when 
applied to the right to life itself. 
</P>
<P>
Bond claimed that "civil rights tried to expand life for everyone. These people 
want to restrict life for women." To assert Bond's position is to rebut it. 
Even the most strident pro-choice advocate must admit that life itself is a 
basic right, if not the pre-eminent right. The right is listed first in the 
triad of rights guaranteed in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of those who oppose abortion, whether by the means of demonstrating 
with Operation Rescue or through conventional lobbying, is to expand the 
natural and constitutional right to life for everyone, including unborn 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Surely, the right to live is more deserving of legal protection than the right 
to eat at a Woolworth's lunch counter.

OPERATION RESCUE AND POLL ON ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times Poll and the article by George Skelton ("Most Americans Think 
Abortion Is Immoral," Part I, March 19) reveals the extent to which Americans 
have lost their way. 
</P>
<P>
The first paragraph was a corker! "Most Americans consider abortion to be 
immoral -- in fact, 'murder.' But they also believe deeply that each woman 
should be allowed to decide for herself whether or not to have an abortion." 
</P>
<P>
Do those two ideas in tandem not show a paralysis of analysis or what? 
</P>
<P>
We have all observed the popular practice of settling all issues so that 
everyone's brand of nonsense and evil is accommodated -- but this is not 
necessarily about the issue of abortion, but about the ability to keep our 
thinking straight.

OPERATION RESCUE AND POLL ON ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I applaud your newspaper for the in-depth article on Randall Terry and the 
Operation Rescue movement. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Terry's group carries pictures of "a bloody fetus in four pieces" 
is as the article says "gruesome," but is, nonetheless, reality. When a fetus 
is aborted, there is blood involved. And when a dilation and curettage abortion 
takes place, the fetus is cut into several pieces. 
</P>
<P>
The problem that I have with the pro-choice supporters' argument is that they 
make "choice" the ultimate issue. Let's face facts. No one has absolute freedom 
of choice sanctioned by the law. One can choose to rob a bank, but it is not 
lawful. Others can choose to kill their 1-year-old child, but it is not legal. 
Why then should a woman have the legal right to take the life of her unborn 
child? 
</P>
<P>
There are limits on our choices. We all live with that reality every day. When 
our freedom violates the safety of another individual, the law steps in. I 
don't believe that abortion is a religious issue. It is a matter of respect for 
human life. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe there does need to be some (as Terry puts it) "moral sanity" brought back 
to this country. Certainly, 1.5 million lives taken each year in abortion is a 
harsh reality. There must be a better way.

OPERATION RESCUE AND POLL ON ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I found article regarding the profile of the typical woman who has an abortion 
very refreshing ("Many in Survey Who Had Abortion Cite Guilt Feelings"). I was 
not surprised to read that the majority of women who have abortions are college 
educated, career women, who make over $40,000 per year. This runs totally 
contrary to the feminist, pro-choice, pro-abortion rhetoric of the past 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
We have been told that abortion must be available to low-income, minority women 
so they can break the cycle of poverty and ignorance caused by unwanted and 
poorly timed pregnancies. The truth is that minority women place a higher value 
on life than do feminist and pro-choice advocates. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the poll showed that an overwhelming majority of Americans believe 
that abortion as a convenient form of birth control is just plain wrong.

PERSONAL INCOME UP 1% IN FEBRUARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Americans' personal income shot up 1% last month while consumer spending 
advanced at a more restrained pace, boosting the savings rate to its highest 
level in nearly three years, the government said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Personal income, bolstered by strong growth in employment and wages, rose to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.32 trillion last month after surging 1.7% 
in January, the Commerce Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
But when it comes to spending that money, consumers have been showing more 
restraint. Personal consumption expenditures rose 0.5% in February to an annual 
rate of $3.88 trillion after advancing 0.4% in January. 
</P>
<P>
"The consumer is still getting a lot of dollars placed in his wallet," said 
Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. "But when it 
came to spending, consumers suddenly have decided this income is not going to 
be disbursed as lavishly as it has been." 
</P>
<P>
The uneven advances in income and spending resulted in a healthy jump in the 
personal savings rate -- savings as a percentage of after-tax income -- to 5.9% 
from 5.4% in the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
February's rate matched the savings level set in April, 1986, and hasn't been 
surpassed since May, 1985, when the rate was 6.4%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Economy Shows Strength 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. savings rate has been much lower than that of most other 
industrialized nations. Last year it rose to 4.2% from a 40-year low of 3.2% in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the latest report on personal income and spending demonstrated 
that the economy continued to show strength last month.

INSPECTION PROCEDURES OKD FOR REMAINING CHILEAN FRUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The federal Food and Drug Administration approved inspection procedures late 
Friday for all remaining varieties of Chilean fruit in cold storage since two 
cyanide-tainted grapes were found March 12 in cargo unloaded in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA previously cleared the way for inspection of grapes, berries, 
nectarines and pears, requiring 5% of each boatload to be scrutinized before 
allowing it to move into stores. 
</P>
<P>
The three biggest Southland retailers -- Vons, Ralphs and Lucky -- have said 
they planned to await fresh shipments, not due in Los Angeles until Monday. But 
Judy Decker, a spokeswoman for Lucky Stores, said Friday that Lucky now expects 
to be selling fruit Easter weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The two new freighters, the Americus Rex and Columbian, are carrying about 
5,000 tons of fruits, said Richard Eastes, general manager of the importing 
firm of David Oppenheimer-California. Inspectors already working overtime are 
likely to be swamped by the new arrivals as they work their way through stored 
grapes and berries, then nectarines and pears and now the remaining species -- 
including the season's first Granny Smith apples. 
</P>
<P>
The inspection regime will lighten April 6 with arrival of the Reefer Tiger, 
however. With FDA inspectors now checking fruit in Chile, the agency said 
domestic inspection can drop to 1% samples on ships that left port after March 
17. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not out of it," Eastes said, "but we're working through it."

Sales of California walnuts in the United States are static, but the commodity

In fact, the United States isn't the No. 1 consumer of in-shell California 
walnuts any longer, Turner Oyloe, executive director of the California Walnut

Shipments to West Germany from the 1988 harvest totaled 35.1 million pounds,

ANDRE PREVIN COMES BACK TO PHILHARMONIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, Times Music Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Was there just a hint of guilt in the splendid performance the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic gave Thursday night, when music director Andre Previn returned to 
the podium at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Music Center? 
</P>
<P>
Like a guilty spouse who has had a little fling while the marriage partner was 
out of town, our Philharmonic seemed on terribly good behavior at this reunion 
with its recently absent leader. 
</P>
<P>
Was that merely because the players were happy to see Previn back at the 
podium? Or was it an afterglow from the carryings-on with a guest conductor for 
the past two weeks? Will we ever know? 
</P>
<P>
The program that Previn is conducting this week (ending Sunday afternoon) is a 
bread-and-butter agenda, beginning with Beethoven's Overture to "Fidelio" and 
First Piano Concerto and culminating in Tchaikovsky's Sixth Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
What made it special at this performance was the solidity and jauntiness in the 
music director's bracing approach to Beethoven and the clear conviction he 
brought to the manic-depressiveness of the "Pathetique" Symphony. And the 
orchestra's willingness to give Previn near-complete cooperation in bringing 
these scores to life. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the turgid textures in Tchaikovsky's emotional Sixth emerged 
clarified, or transparent. But the sweep of feeling, and many of the 
corroborative instrumental details, held it all together, even with occasional 
blatting of tone in the climaxes. And the lush string sounds one wants and 
expects at the lyric heights of the work materialized handsomely and 
eloquently. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrating the 35th anniversary of her Philharmonic debut, Alicia de Larrocha 
gave as well-spoken and elegant a reading of Beethoven's C-major Concerto as 
one might ever wish to hear. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish musician -- who made her first United States appearances here in 
February, 1954, with then-music director Alfred Wallenstein and the 
Philharmonic -- continues to serve as a role model for thinking pianists who 
believe in the power of the instrument to produce myriad shades of color and 
specific qualities of tone. She is as much an inspiration today as she was at 
that long-ago but well-remembered series of debut appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Previn and the orchestra provided stylish and attentive support, particularly 
in a generously laid-out and richly songful slow movement.

IT'S ALL IN THE TIMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG, Times TV Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Another weekend, another set of new series. 
</P>
<P>
The newcomers this time are dramas: ABC's "Men," at 10 tonight on Channels 7, 
3, 10 and 42, and NBC's "Quantum Leap," which gets a two-hour introduction at 9 
p.m. Sunday on Channels 4, 36 and 39, and then moves into its regular 9 p.m. 
slot on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The premise for "Quantum Leap" is proven and ever appealing. Only the execution 
remains a question. 
</P>
<P>
"Quantum Leap" aspires to be "The Time Machine," "Twilight Zone" and "Back to 
the Future" rolled into one. A malfunctioning scientific experiment sends Sam 
Beckett (Scott Bakula) bounding back in time through his own life span, 
intermittently accompanied by an holographic observer named Albert (Dean 
Stockwell). 
</P>
<P>
In the two-hour premiere, Beckett awakens in the body of an Air Force test 
pilot in 1956 and faces an immediate crisis because he doesn't know how to fly. 
He'll make two other time stops before the final commercial, allowing us to use 
his experiences to chart our own lives. 
</P>
<P>
As written by executive producer Donald P. Bellisario, "Quantum Leap" for the 
most part is so excruciatingly slow and laborious that you wonder if director 
David Hemmings was trapped in his own time warp. Yet Bakula does nicely, and 
the story ultimately accelerates and even yields some very affecting moments as 
Beckett intrudes on his own past. 
</P>
<P>
Freed of the burden of filling two hours, "Quantum Leap" may work better and 
surely will move faster as a weekly series. It is amazing that a show about 
time, however, would have no concept of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Men," meanwhile, makes a sort of quantum leap from "thirtysomething" to 
malesomething -- very promisingly throughout much of tonight's premiere, only 
to disintegrate next Saturday. After Episode One, you want to know more about 
the mid-to-late 30-ish characters in "Men." After Episode Two, you want to know 
less. 
</P>
<P>
Although the filming is in Toronto, the setting is supposedly Baltimore, where 
Steven the bachelor surgeon (Ted Wass), Paul the divorced newspaper columnist 
(Saul Rubinek), Charlie the married lawyer (Ving Rhames and Danny the single 
cop (Tom O'Brien) are old buddies who hang out and have weekly poker games 
together. 
</P>
<P>
The death of Danny's older brother, who is also a member of the group, has a 
traumatic effect on the men, feeding already existing tensions between Danny 
and Charlie and intensifying the relationships among the characters. 
</P>
<P>
Written by co-executive producer Steve Brown and directed by co-executive 
producer Peter Werner, this is very compelling work -- stylish, textured and 
interesting -- buoyed by nice performances all around. That the story's 
tensions are too easily resolved, however, is unfortunately an omen of what 
awaits in next Saturday's hour, when "Men" softens its edges in a twist toward 
silly farce. 
</P>
<P>
This will be one of those series with no memory, apparently. No longer the 
grieving, angry young man of Episode One, Danny next week is a sort of comic 
pit stop, exceeded in buffoonery only by the clowning Paul (this character is 
really hard to take), who has the hots for the mother of the runaway who has 
the hots for Steven. Got it? 
</P>
<P>
The women are all trivial, but so are the men. The result is a clumsy rendition 
of the kind of breezy, romping nonsense that "Moonlighting" used to pull off so 
deftly. Some of the style is there, but the characters aren't worthy of it.

FACES . . .: MILITARY MAN

Don't be surprised to find Ramon Franco, the actor who plays gun-toting Pvt. 
Alberto Ruiz on CBS-TV's "Tour of Duty," holding a high military position one 
day without ever enlisting in the service. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is Franco in his second season with the 196th Light Infantry Brigade 
on "Tour," but he has played a grunt in Clint Eastwood's "Heartbreak Ridge;" 
was a combat Marine in the play "Wasted" and starred in a National Guard 
commercial. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I should qualify for the GI Bill or something," says Franco. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything started for me with that National Guard commercial," says the 
25-year-old New York native. "They told me I could have the part if I cut my 
hair, which was really long at that point. I did it, got the commercial and a 
couple of months later I got the call for 'Heartbreak Ridge.' That role led to 
'Tour.' " 
</P>
<P>
Franco has since become a student of the Vietnam War. Through "Tour" he has 
developed a platoon of experiences that he calls "some of the most enlightening 
I could have" as an actor. "I have learned about the Vietnam War more than 
anything else in my life," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"I come in contact with a number of vets that have nailed me to the wall with 
some of the frustration they have. One time, when the cast went to a VA 
hospital to screen the show, a bunch of the vets got up and applauded us for 
what we were doing. Then this guy stands up and shouts, 'Hey! What are you 
doing for me? You have your nice cars and homes! What do I get out of this 
except you exploiting me?' And he's right. This led CBS to put a number on the 
screen after our show so people who are disturbed with what we are doing can 
call and release their feelings. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't get much closer to the war than that." JOHN BURMAN

FACES . . .: WELL SEASONED

<P>
You remember Mary Bland. 
</P>
<P>
In "Eating Raoul," she and husband, Paul, did just that -- clobbered that pesky 
Raoul with a skillet and had him for dinner. In the currently-on-hold "Bland 
Ambition," Paul (Paul Bartel) and Mary (Mary Woronov) are back, eyeing a career 
in politics -- and trying to check their old eating habits. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone is bothering us and we don't have the time to deal with him, we 
sort of bop him over the head with the frying pan," says Woronov. "Of course, 
immediately afterward we say, 'We must not do this anymore.' But it's something 
we've learned from the other movie, and haven't quite been able to kick yet." 
</P>
<P>
Woronov's roles since "Raoul" have been equally eclectic. The actress -- an 
alumna of the infamous Andy Warhol Factory, and star of his '60s films, "The 
Beard," "Hedy Lamarr" and "Chelsea Girls" -- is awaiting the release of 
"Warlock," in which she plays a clairvoyant helping warlock Julian Sands 
communicate with his father, the Devil. For her good efforts, "I freeze to 
death and shatter into a thousand pieces." 
</P>
<P>
In the upcoming "Let It Ride," Woronov is back as a soothsayer -- albeit in a 
lighter mode -- playing a burger-stand proprietress cheering on deadbeat 
race-track-betting junkie Richard Dreyfuss. And in the June release of "Scenes 
From the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills," the actress plays opposite 
Jacqueline Bisset as a pampered matron who, after a weekend orgy, decides to 
chuck it all and marry her houseboy. 
</P>
<P>
When she isn't acting, Woronov, who is a Brooklyn native and art graduate of 
Cornell, is most likely to be painting. 
</P>
<P>
"People always ask, 'Which do you really do?' " she says with a sigh. "That's 
not the way it works. They're both integral. Acting is very social; painting is 
so lonely. And I think you need one thing that's all yours, that you do for 
yourself. Even if I became a famous painter, if someone asked me to go out and 
entertain three people on a street corner, I bet I would. I wouldn't do it for 
a year or two, but I'd definitely give it a day. . . ." JANICE ARKATOV

DICKIE BETTS HITS HIGHS AND LOWS IN PALACE SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a few shining moments in the early-to-middle '70s, Dickey Betts was the 
American guitar hero, and never more deservedly so than when the light, lyrical 
twin-lead guitar lines of the Allman Brothers Band's instrumental "Jessica" 
were embedding themselves into the public rock consciousness. Betts was and is 
at his finest when he walks on the sunny side of the street with that original, 
upbeat and peculiarly Southern style of riffing. 
</P>
<P>
This formidable talent still uses "Jessica" to conclude his live set, and has 
some less ancient numbers as well that are not too far off from that sprightly 
style. But Betts also insists -- at length -- on getting bogged down in sub-par 
blues, an overworked genre that is hardly uniquely his. The Dickey Betts Band's 
show Thursday at the Palace alternated between these highs and lows, hitting 
bottom with its banal blues jams but still reaching exquisite peaks when the 
guitarist perked up and moved in a more fusionary direction -- i.e., he did 
what he does best. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, Betts released "Pattern Disruptive," his first recording since the 
last Allman Brothers reunion attempt back in 1981. Both album and tour have 
Betts sharing much of the guitar spotlight with capable hotshot Warren Haynes, 
whose speciality (like that of Betts' one-time partner, the late Duane Allman) 
is slide work. Haynes only sang one lead vocal on the album, but in this 
concert inherited nearly all the singing duties -- possibly because Betts grew 
visibly displeased early on with what he was hearing out of his vocal monitors. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd of a few hundred ax fiends relished most every moment -- especially 
the Allman Brothers tunes, with anticipation of a 20th-anniversary boxed set 
and possible reunion this year no doubt setting fans' juices flowing 
double-time. Curiously, an eight-minute encore call failed to bring the Betts 
Band back on stage for more after the 65-minute set. CHRIS WILLMAN

TROUBLED WATER(S) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have yet to determine why almost everyone I've ever met tacks the letter "S" 
onto the end (ends?) of words when it is totally inappropriate; (witness: "I'm 
Going to Lucky's Market"). However, this may be the final straw. 
</P>
<P>
KCET TV, Channel 28, in an add in the Calendar on March 8 actually touted the 
Simon &amp; Garfunkel concert in Central Park as featuring the song "Bridge 
Over Troubled Waters." 
</P>
<P>
Puh-lease! It's "Bridge Over Troubled Water." Singular . . . not plural. A 
minor point? Yes. But we should all attempt to be as accurate as we can be. 
Let's refer to it as Paul and Art presented it.

DONORS GREAT AND SMALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Randy Lewis' column of March 5 in the Calendar ("Need $10,000? Let's 
See, Just Where's That Wallet?"), I think some clarification may be called for. 
</P>
<P>
South Coast Repertory is a nonprofit organization. Like other nonprofits, we 
depend on gifts from the community in order to operate. These range from $35 to 
major donations of over $100,000. SCR has long understood and noted that we are 
dependent on every gift we receive, regardless of the amount. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the season, as other organizations do, SCR prints letters from the 
officers of its board, updating the audience on various aspects of the 
theater's activities and fund-raising campaigns. Mr. Lewis has attended the 
theater on many other occasions and must be aware that other letters throughout 
the season have encouraged support of any amount. Mrs. Flamson is the vice 
president responsible for raising endowment gifts -- the long-term, 
larger-denomination gifts to build buildings, purchase lighting boards, do 
artistic research and development (i.e., commission new plays). 
</P>
<P>
It is regrettable that Mr. Lewis' column, while admittedly aiming for humor, 
shed negative light on an active volunteer and gave the impression that SCR is 
only concerned with the donors who give large gifts at the expense of others. 
In fact, there are thousands of people whose support keeps SCR thriving. 
</P>
<P>
It takes community partnership and commitment to build a nationally acclaimed, 
professional resident theater. And it takes the support of single-ticket 
buyers, subscribers, volunteers, annual donors and capital donors -- each 
participating at the level at which they are most comfortable -- to make it 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Until one has made that kind of commitment to an organization performing an 
important role in your community, I don't feel it's appropriate to knock those 
who do.

TWO-DAY BICYCLE JAUNT FOR MS: INDUCING EXPERIENCED RIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE Z. COOKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Admit it. Until now, your 10-speed or mountain bicycle rides have been limited 
to a jaunt along the ocean, generally within pushing distance of a telephone 
booth. After all, what happens if your bike -- or you -- break down in the 
great back of beyond? 
</P>
<P>
No problem, if your first two-day ride is the MS-150 Bike Tour, held April 8-9 
and sponsored by the California Chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
The 120-mile ride through the Inland Empire's farmlands and vineyards is 
leisurely, family-style fun -- and the $150 (per rider) you need to collect in 
advance from friends and sponsors is a lot nicer than giving at the office. 
</P>
<P>
Where else can you find a ride that, for a $30 registration fee, reserves a 
power-packed picnic lunch and dinner on Saturday, overnight camping at Lake 
Perris State Recreation Area (site of Indian petroglyphs and live music), 
breakfast on Sunday and a midday farewell dinner at the Murrieta Town Hall? 
</P>
<P>
Trucks will carry your duffel, tent and sleeping bag out, and bring everything 
back, including you and your bicycle. Sag wagons with mechanics aboard and a 
first-aid van will minister to flat tires, broken brake cables and sunburns. 
</P>
<P>
For registration, sponsor forms and a fact sheet, write to MS Society, 229 N. 
Central Ave., Glendale 91203; or call (818) 247-1361, or (714) 824-0563.

GARDENING: PLANTS RETURN TO NATURE IN BOTANIST'S CORNER OF SUN VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHERI RAE WOLPERT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Located in Sun Valley -- an apt location if only for the name -- is the 
Theodore Payne Foundation for Wildflowers and Native Plants. The nonprofit 
organization was incorporated in 1960 to carry on the work of its founder, 
botanist Theodore Payne. 
</P>
<P>
Payne, who studied the nursery and seed business in his native England, moved 
in 1893 to Southern California, where he continued to practice his trade. The 
botanist soon became interested in preserving the natural flora of his new 
home, particularly the wildflowers that were being lost to development even 
then. 
</P>
<P>
He cultivated the seeds of nearly 500 native shrubs, trees and flowers, and 
sold his plants at a succession of nurseries which he owned and operated for 
nearly 60 years. He wrote articles and frequently lectured on the subject of 
preserving wildflowers and native plants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Left His Mark 
</P>
<P>
Payne left his mark on many of the Southland's botanical gardens: He landscaped 
a wildflower garden in Exposition Park; inspired the Santa Barbara Botanical 
Garden, Rancho Santa Ana Botanical Garden, and worked with landscape architect 
Ralph Cornell in the development of what is now Torrey Pines State Park. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the foundation maintains three major goals: to make native plants and 
seeds available to the public, to teach about the culture and uses of native 
plants, and to preserve rare and endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-acre facility includes a nursery and growing yard and selling area, 
nature trails and an alder-and-sycamore-canopied picnic ground. Headquartered 
in a converted house, the foundation offices contain a library, bookstore, 
meeting rooms and a seed room. The phone never stops ringing; calls from 
frantic landscapers searching for natives are deftly handled by propagator Jan 
Busco, who maintains a protective attitude toward her plants. "They are in no 
condition to sell," she states about wooly blue curls. "Maybe in another 
month." 
</P>
<P>
The seed room, complete with an ancient seed cleaner, dusty cabinets and 
refrigerators that house the seeds, is the place where Payne's primary work 
continues today. Leading a tour group into the tiny, cluttered former garage, 
horticulturist Melanie Baer declares: "One of my divine inspirations in life is 
seeds. They have such persistence." 
</P>
<P>
Continuing the tour of the grounds, Baer points out Payne's favorite California 
native, the Matilija poppy, and the California flannel bush, both of which 
should bloom in May. Moving into the cutting garden, she rattles off the 
scientific names of several of the 40 varieties of lilacs, most of which are in 
fragrant bloom. 
</P>
<P>
Several rare and endangered species are preserved here, including the Catalina 
ironweed and a manzanita that is now extinct in nature. "Why should we preserve 
them?" Baer asks rhetorically. "Because we don't know enough about them or what 
their benefits will be. We just don't want to lose them." 
</P>
<P>
Although the gardens are equipped with watering systems, they are watered only 
occasionally. Native plants, Baer reminds the group, are adapted to be drought- 
resistant. "We aren't doing anything revolutionary here," she says. "We're just 
trying to emulate natural conditions." 
</P>
<P>
A dramatic example of the foundation's success in emulating natural conditions 
is "Wildflower Hill," currently displaying a colorful array of at least 25 
native wildflowers. The project was started five years ago when volunteer Kevin 
Connelly began clearing the hill of invasive mustard and grasses. The hill then 
was seeded with wildflowers, and nature took over. 
</P>
<P>
Although the hill has not been reseeded in more than a year, it offers a larger 
display than was seen last year. "This self-perpetuating garden is a good 
lesson for reseeding," Baer observes. An easy zigzag hike up the hill offers a 
delightful assortment of blooms, including poppies, lupine, owl clover, cream 
cups and many more. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation operates a 24-hour wildflower hot line from March through May: 
(818) 768-3533. Updated weekly, the recorded message provides information about 
the location and types of wildflowers in bloom throughout the Southland. Its 
publications include "Exploring Wildflower Country," several maps, general 
information about where to find wildflowers, and the information-packed "A 
Southern California Nature Calendar" by Elna Bakker. 
</P>
<P>
On April 8 from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., the foundation celebrates Poppy Day 
with a full range of activities, including educational displays, guided hikes, 
a sale of selected plants and books and other resources required to create a 
drought-tolerant garden. 
</P>
<P>
The Theodore Payne Foundation is located at 10459 Tuxford St., Sun Valley, 
Calif. 91352; (818) 768-1802. Hours: 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Tuesday through 
Saturday. Tax-deductible memberships and volunteer opportunities are available.

FIRST PERSON: ODYSSEY OF A CITY-DWELLING MAN IN A MAGIC COAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was one of the cold days of early February, the kind of day when 
octogenarians such as I are usually content to remain indoors -- but not 
always. 
</P>
<P>
I had spent my morning and much of the afternoon in bed, absorbed in reading. 
It was 2 in the afternoon when I strayed to the living room of my downtown 
high-rise apartment and found that a neighbor had slipped a magazine, 
Movieline, under my door. As I flipped through the listings of current movies 
and the movie houses,I saw that "Working Girl" was one of the features at the 
Laemmle 4-Plex Theater in the Sheraton Grande Hotel on Figueroa Street. There 
was time to catch the 4:40 p.m. show, but I knew I must dress warmly to brave 
the frigid outdoor temperature. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion called for my magic coat. Of course the coat isn't really magic. 
It's just that it always seems to attract pleasant and unusual encounters. 
</P>
<P>
I first saw -- and subsequently bought -- the Shetland-and-mohair sport coat in 
the '50s as I wandered lonely as a cloud about the streets of London. A product 
of the queen's tailors, it was carefully fitted on a handsome, lifelike 
mannequin in a shop window. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Symbol of British Empire 
</P>
<P>
The lining was a silky cerulean color, and on the right-hand inside pocket of 
the pale gold label was the symbol of the British Empire: two lions in an 
upright position leaning against the shield of England topped by the royal 
crown. In fine black print was: "By appointment to H. M. Queen Elizabeth, the 
Queen Mother," and followed by bold letters: "Aguascutum of London." 
</P>
<P>
By George (no royal pun intended), it was my right to have this special 
garment. Thus began the magic. 
</P>
<P>
While I was garbed in the royal attire, friendly things happened. On the tubes, 
when I was riding in cars with a conductor, the uniformed man usually would 
join me for a chat between stops. If in looking out a window I appeared to be 
unsure of the location, a passenger would rush to my seat. "May I help you? I 
travel this route every day." 
</P>
<P>
So on this cold February day in Los Angeles, I was wearing the coat -- with 
everything carefully coordinated, in case I decided to have a drink in the 
lobby of the Sheraton. I walked south on Hill Street toward the Grand Central 
Market, between 3rd and 4th streets. 
</P>
<P>
Reminiscing about my two years during Word War II on the atoll of Roi-Namur in 
the Marshall Islands, I stopped in the market for a coconut drink, something 
that had been a source of refreshment during those years. It would give me 
strength for the climb to the Laemmle, which is directly west over old Bunker 
Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Back on the street, I pressed the traffic-light button to cross. Excavation for 
Metro Rail made one-way traffic a problem. The wait seemed interminable. 
</P>
<P>
Beside me stood a beautifully dressed woman of about 40, carrying a white 
plastic bag of groceries and looking like someone who would shop at Gelson's in 
Century City rather than a produce market. 
</P>
<P>
I pointed to the nearby mass of high-rise apartments for senior citizens and 
said: "I can tell you are not eligible to live over there." 
</P>
<P>
"That's right. I live in West Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to see the movie 'Working Girl' at the theater in the Sheraton 
Grande," I said. 
</P>
<P>
She gave me a searching look. "Oh, that's a terrible hill to climb. My car is 
parked right there. May I drop you off on my way?" 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you so much," I said, "but I need the exercise and I have plenty of 
time." Score No. 1 for the magic coat. 
</P>
<P>
I turned west on 4th Street, and the incline ahead loomed like Mt. Shasta. How 
did that old ditty go that was helpful in remembering the order of north-south 
streets? It was something like: "From Main you Spring to Broadway and cross 
Hill to pick an Olive on Grand and Hope to smell a Flower on Figueroa." 
</P>
<P>
After about 20 yards, my breathing was labored and the strain on unused leg 
muscles was noticeable. Then, a strong hand grasped my right arm. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the cold, the young man wore a thin white shirt -- sleeves rolled to 
the shoulders and open to the waist. "I'm going all the way over the hill; I 
want to help you." 
</P>
<P>
He took my hand and began to pull me along. Then he thought he could do better. 
He put one arm around my waist and with my feet barely touching the pavement, 
my body was virtually being carried up the block. 
</P>
<P>
With my limited knowledge of Spanish I understood him to say: "Don't be afraid 
of me. I'm a good man." 
</P>
<P>
"Muchas, muchas gracias, amigo," I said, and added that I had to turn south on 
Olive. He stood watching me and shaking his head, then went up the hill alone. 
</P>
<P>
There was time along the way to admire three or four sculptures. One between 
Grand Avenue and Hope Street beside the Wells Fargo Center is a huge, brightly 
painted sculpture of five almost life-size silhouettes of automobiles on a huge 
inverted gray arc. The red car extends into space, perhaps symbolizing the 
transition of Wells Fargo from the days of the Pony Express to the time of the 
internal-combustion engine. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the courtyard of 400 S. Hope St., a white steel obelisk leans skyward 
like the Tower of Pisa. The small plaque says it is by Alexander Liberman, an 
American born in Russia in 1912. "Bravo, Alex," I thought. 
</P>
<P>
At the Stuart M. Ketchum YMCA, erected on the roof of the multistoried Arco 
Plaza garage, I paused to watch through the second-floor glass wall the line of 
men and women working away on stationary bikes and treadmills. It was a lovely 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
A sculpture on a large oval pedestal in a landscaped circle of shrubs caught my 
eye. There's a curved blade of mottled copper on the inner surface, and a 
highly chromed outer surface extends skyward. It revealed my reflection like a 
mirror when it caught the rays of the setting sun. 
</P>
<P>
I took an envelope and pen from my inside coat pocket and began recording 
information from the plaque on the sculpture. As I wrote, a young boy and girl 
lingered to chat with me. When asked if they were going for a workout, the 
young man said: "Oh no, we work here." They seemed pleased by my interest in 
the sculpture, and my mind was saying, "Oh to be young again." 
</P>
<P>
At the entrance to the Y, a bronze statue of three women runners with ponytails 
flying pays tribute to the 1984 Olympics. I jotted down information from the 
plaque: Olympiad 1984, Milton Hebald (Rome) 1986, donated by Aileen Adams, 
Robin Lee Adams and Marv Adams Reinsch. 
</P>
<P>
From the west side of the Y, the only way to reach Figueroa Street would be the 
entrance to the Westin Bonaventure Hotel, high above Flower Street. I crossed 
the sky bridge. A young man who apparently did not speak English was washing 
the glass and polishing the brass at the entrance to the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"Can I get through here to the Sheraton Grande on Figueroa Street?" I asked. He 
seemed puzzled. "El Calle Figueroa," I repeated. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, si, senor." He dropped the tools of his trade, opened the door and 
proceeded over my protests to escort me down the long corridor lined with shops 
to an elevator. He pressed the Down button and waited for the elevator to 
arrive. He reached inside and pressed 2 and pointed westward. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Offered Him $5 
</P>
<P>
I was moved by his courtesy and offered him a new $5 bill, which he refused. 
</P>
<P>
In just an hour, my fourth kind and pleasant encounter. Was it my age -- or the 
magic coat? 
</P>
<P>
It was 4:30 p.m. when I descended the steep stairway to the Laemmle Grande. The 
box office was dark and the doors locked. The sign above the window indicated 
the next show at 7 p.m. It was Friday and there was no early show. It would be 
a long wait. 
</P>
<P>
So I went around to the Sheraton Grande. The palatial doors automatically 
opened into the elegant lobby, where a handsome young man played the piano near 
the bar. A cocktail waitress brought my drink promptly, and there was a glass 
bowl filled with fresh, roasted and salted cashews and peanuts. But after about 
an hour, I realized "Working Girl" would have to wait; surely it would be 
around for an extended run. 
</P>
<P>
I made my way homeward, still making mental notes of the many changes taking 
place throughout downtown. The Central Library site is boarded up and 
excavation in progress for the new structure; the Church of the Open Door has 
been demolished. 
</P>
<P>
The old Mayflower Hotel is sheathed in steel scaffolding from top to bottom, 
and either the owners or the contractors have a sense of humor and poetic soul. 
A sign at the entrance reads: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A little construction 
</P>
<P>
 -- then hip-hip-hooray. 
</P>
<P>
A new small hotel 
</P>
<P>
for Downtown L.A. 
</P>
<P>
Checkers 
</P>
<P>
Opening Spring 1989 
</P>
<P>
Night had fallen in downtown Los Angeles, and I was thinking all the way home 
that small adventures are possible. If the heart feels young, there are 
beautiful things and kind people to add joy along the way. 
</P>
<P>
And in my case, it didn't hurt to have a magic coat.

A LAST DANCE WITH DICK CLARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"American Bandstand' is rock 'n' roll history," Chubby Checker said this week 
as he considered the role that the seminal teen dance show -- the longest 
running show on television -- has played in the rise of rock. 
</P>
<P>
"When you talk about rock 'n' roll dancing, it goes back to 'Bandstand,' " the 
"Twist"-meister said of the show, which helped boost his career in the late 
'50s and early '60s. "Just like the phone starts with Alexander Graham Bell." 
</P>
<P>
At approximately 4 p.m. today, that history takes a turn. 
</P>
<P>
In a Hollywood TV studio, Dick Clark, who has presided over "Bandstand" for 33 
years, will pass his microphone to the man he has picked to succeed him: David 
Hirsch, 26, formerly a segment producer for Clark's "Camp Midnight" series. 
</P>
<P>
In today's "Bandstand" taping, which will air April 8 -- the first outing on 
its new USA Network home -- Hirsh will preside over the familiar trademarks of 
the American TV institution, including the spotlight dance and rate-a-record 
segments. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who at 59 is still known as "America's Oldest Teen-Ager," is stepping 
aside to concentrate on the other tentacles of his huge entertainment empire. 
</P>
<P>
Besides "Bandstand," which Dick Clark Productions will continue to produce, 
Clark has his hands in other television production and syndication packages, 
concert tour packages and other holdings that, as of 1986, had boosted him onto 
the "Forbes 400" list of wealthiest Americans with an estimated worth of more 
than $180 million. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Clark nor Hirsch would comment about the transition, but to many 
associated with the show over the years, today's taping represents nothing less 
than the end of an era. 
</P>
<P>
"Dick Clark leaving 'Bandstand' just doesn't seem right," said Joe Bonsall, a 
member of the Oak Ridge Boys country group who, in the late '50s, sometimes 
danced on "Bandstand" broadcasts in Philadelphia. "Sometimes when something 
lasts so long, you think it will always be there." 
</P>
<P>
The show began as a daily 2 1/2-hour local program in Philadelphia in 1952. 
Clark took the host job in 1956, and ABC picked up the series in 1957. Clark 
moved the operation to Hollywood in 1964, from where the it has originated, 
once a week, since. 
</P>
<P>
To Kent Ferguson, who like Bonsall dressed in a suit and tie and stood in line 
outside the Philadelphia studio hoping to be accepted for the show in the late 
'50s, "Bandstand" and Clark will always represent a lost time of innocence. 
</P>
<P>
"Around the corner from the studio was a soda shop, and the guy who ran it was 
really named Pops," recalled Ferguson, who now is headmaster of the Santa 
Barbara Middle School. "That was the hang-out, where the in-crowd went after 
school and before the show. 
</P>
<P>
"Today it's so different. All during that time, every Saturday night there 
would be a dance you could go to. There would be no liquor or cigarettes and of 
course no drugs. And this was all the impact of 'American Bandstand.' Clark 
really impacted a generation. I think it's sad today that kids don't have a 
wholesome dance environment without all that other crap." 
</P>
<P>
The history of "American Bandstand" isn't all quite that Norman Rockwell-ish. 
</P>
<P>
In 1960, Clark -- along with disc jockey Alan Freed -- was called before a 
congressional committee investigating payola and conflict of interest in the 
music industry. For Freed, the scandal ended a brilliant career; he died a 
broke alcoholic in 1964 at 43. Clark, though, emerged unscathed after divesting 
his interests in record and publishing companies. Many in the industry 
speculated that Clark's smooth, clean-cut image helped him escape the taint of 
scandal that destroyed the more abrasive Freed. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years there have also been stories about Clark being a dictatorial, 
egotistical boss -- though most associated with him speak glowingly of his 
fathomless loyalty to those who have helped him and worked for him. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, the luster of "Bandstand" itself has faded. MTV certainly 
supplanted it as the primary television outlet for pop music and "Bandstand's" 
ratings dropped to the point that, in 1987, ABC would not guarantee a set spot 
on its Saturday daytime lineup and asked for it to be cut from one hour to half 
an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Clark then took the show to the less-visible world of syndication. And the new 
move to cable, with or without Clark, leaves industry observers uncertain about 
the show's value as a place to expose artists. 
</P>
<P>
A recording company publicist, who asked not to be identified, said that it is 
no longer economical to place artists on the show because the program requires 
that the artist pay all transportation and union fees. 
</P>
<P>
However, a publicist for another record company, who also asked not to be 
identified, said "Bandstand" remains part of the regimen of promotional 
outlets, though it's far from the dominant force of old. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think in the '80s there's anything aside from repeated MTV airings of 
a video that has the impact 'Bandstand' or 'Ed Sullivan' had in the '60s. But 
every little bit helps." 
</P>
<P>
For Deon Estus, who will be the first recording artist to appear on the new 
"Bandstand," the change doesn't lessen his thrill. 
</P>
<P>
"I was raised on 'Bandstand,' like we all were," said the musician, whose song 
"Heaven Help Me" is a hot item on the black and dance music charts. "To me it's 
as exciting as it would have been 20 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
And Chubby Checker insists that it's pointless to mourn the changes time has 
brought to the show. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like this," the still-active singer said. "The wheel has already been 
invented, so what's the big deal? Dick Clark taught everybody how to do it, or 
they wouldn't be doing it. And dancing is still going on."

NBC'S TIME TRAVEL FANTASY A 'QUANTUM LEAP' OF FAITH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE HAITHMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I said: 'I'm going to pitch an idea that's going to scare the hell out of 
you,' " writer-producer Don Bellisario recalled, reminiscing about a meeting 
many months ago with NBC Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff, who wanted 
him to create a TV series for the network. 
</P>
<P>
"And then I pitched 'Quantum Leap.' " 
</P>
<P>
Bellisario succeeded in scaring Tartikoff -- who has been burned in the past 
with such science-fiction series as "V," "Something Is Out There" and "Misfits 
of Science" -- but not enough to keep him from encouraging Bellisario to go 
forward with "Quantum Leap," a fantasy series that debuts Sunday at 9 p.m. Its 
regular time slot will be Fridays at 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Describing "Quantum Leap" isn't easy, even for those involved. 
</P>
<P>
Star Dean Stockwell, an Academy Award nominee for "Married to the Mob," 
compares it to the hit film "Back to the Future." Co-star Scott Bakula, who 
previously had the lead in the CBS comedy "Eisenhower and Lutz," likens it to 
"Heaven Can Wait," with an element of Walter Mitty thrown in. 
</P>
<P>
Bellisario quickly points out what "Quantum Leap" is not. 
</P>
<P>
"People look at the press releases and say, 'It's another Don Bellisario action 
show,' " said the producer, whose credits include "Magnum, P.I." "Airwolf" and 
the short-lived "Tales of the Gold Monkey." 
</P>
<P>
"The pilot has action, and there is adventure, but it's not action-adventure," 
Bellisario said during an interview. "I didn't want to do another cop show, 
another adventure-with-helicopter-type adventure show. It's a drama, but it 
really has comedy and heart." 
</P>
<P>
He also is unwilling to call the show science fiction, despite its strong 
fantasy element. 
</P>
<P>
So what is it "Quantum Leap" exactly, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
This 
comedy-drama-but-not-action/adventure-even-though-it-has-action-and-adventure 
show is set in the mid-1990s and concerns a time travel experiment that goes 
awry. Young scientist Sam Beckett (Bakula) becomes trapped between 1956 and the 
present -- roughly the span of his own lifetime -- and bounces from decade to 
decade, always finding himself in the body of someone else. He and his 
scientific colleague, Albert (Stockwell), try to figure out how to get Beckett 
back to the future. 
</P>
<P>
To the viewing audience, Beckett appears as Beckett. His new face -- the one 
everyone around him sees -- is only visible in a mirror. Beckett also loses 
most of his memory after making the leap. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a real case of jet lag, is what it amounts to," Bellisario said. 
</P>
<P>
There is another catch: Wherever Beckett goes, he must do something to correct 
some mistake made in the past before moving on to another time and place. He 
doesn't rescue major political figures from assassination or prevent the 
Vietnam war, Bellisario said; Beckett's tasks are smaller: saving someone from 
marrying the wrong person, winning a baseball game, or making peace with his 
own father, who died in 1974, on a return visit to 1956. 
</P>
<P>
"All the writers come in at first and say, 'But what about the ramifications of 
changing history?' " Bellisario said. "I say, 'Don't worry about that.' Every 
time travel show worries about that. We don't worry about it." 
</P>
<P>
Beckett can reappear as anyone. In the pilot, he makes his first blast to the 
past and turns up as a 1956 Air Force test pilot scheduled to break a speed 
record on an experimental rocket plane. 
</P>
<P>
In upcoming episodes, Beckett will reappear as a black man in the deep South in 
1956 (he does not realize who he is until he faces onlookers' shocked reactions 
as he sits down at a "whites only" lunch counter and catches a glimpse of 
himself in the mirror) and as a woman fending off sexual advances from her 
boss. He also goes back 12 years to meet the young college student who in the 
future would leave him at the altar -- and finds out why. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the time Beckett visits a time and place he likes so much he 
refuses to try to help anybody, because once his task is done, he has to leave. 
</P>
<P>
In his original pilot, Bellisario introduced viewers to Beckett right after his 
first leap back in time, when he awakens to find that he is now an Air Force 
pilot with an 8-year-old son and a pregnant wife. The intention was to keep the 
audience as confused as Beckett about what's going on for about the first 
half-hour. 
</P>
<P>
At NBC's request, however, Bellisario added a prologue showing Beckett making 
the leap, even though he liked the idea of the viewers having to feel the same 
sense of alienation that the memory-less Beckett does. "I'm still not sure that 
was the right thing to do, but I did it," he said with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
Stockwell, for one, thinks viewers will be able to keep up with Beckett as he 
rockets through time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's mysterious," he said. "I think that there's a common psychological, or 
whatever you want to call it, fascination with the idea of going back into the 
past." 
</P>
<P>
Bakula agreed. "Every time you do something a little different, you get a 
little nervous about it -- but to me, that's exciting," he said. "They've done 
series where they've gone back into the past, you know, like 'Almost Grown' and 
'The Wonder Years,' but this is truly a different thing. Every week, you won't 
know what to expect. If we can get an audience to lock into what Dean and I are 
doing, hopefully we can get them to go with us, wherever we go."

A HOLLYWOOD ENDING FOR THE WHEELER OSCAR SAGA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the moment, the brightest star on Hollywood Boulevard is William Kaiser, a 
41-year-old former hospital administrator from Tuxedo Park, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
In a private awards ceremony Friday in the Blossom Room of the Hollywood 
Roosevelt Hotel -- the location of the first Academy Awards ceremony 61 years 
ago -- Kaiser surprised 84-year-old art director Lyle Wheeler by reuniting him 
with the Oscar he won in 1959 for "The Diary of Anne Frank." 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler was assisted to the podium by his son, Brook, and he graciously 
accepted the award for a second time, on this occasion from actress Terry 
Moore, who worked with Wheeler on eight films, including "Daddy Longlegs" 
(1955) and "Peyton Place" (1957). 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't believe I was ever going to see even one of these again," Wheeler 
said, looking down with moist eyes at the golden statuette -- now worn and 
pitted by time -- clutched tightly in his hand. 
</P>
<P>
When asked what he planned to do with the Oscar, Wheeler evoked laughter and a 
warm applause from the small crowd of friends, family and press when he said, 
"Well, I want to put it someplace where it won't be stolen." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kaiser stood proudly and silently behind, letting Wheeler soak up 
the attention, while realizing a personal dream of his own. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser, who flew into Los Angeles only three days earlier, depleted most of his 
savings account of 16 years to come up with the $21,250 necessary to purchase 
the Oscar from a Long Beach couple who stumbled across Wheeler's 24-karat 
plated statuette -- and four more just like it -- three years ago at a storage 
facility auction. 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler, considered the "dean of art directors," has worked on more than 400 
films and was nominated for 29 art direction Academy Awards over his 50-year 
career. He won five of them, his first for "Gone With the Wind" in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
After financial setbacks forced Wheeler out of his home and into a Santa Monica 
hotel room, he packed his belongings -- including all five of the Oscars -- 
into cardboard boxes and placed them in storage. As Wheeler plummeted deeper 
into debt, his storage bill soared to more than $30,000, until the storage 
facility finally auctioned off his goods to pay his bill. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser was having dinner with his wife, Joan, when he heard on the evening news 
that Wheeler's Oscars were in the possession of the Long Beach couple who were 
planning to auction them off. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in his room at the Orchid Hotel in Hollywood Tuesday night, Kaiser 
recalled the moment with a trembling voice: "I couldn't believe it. My wife 
turned to me and said, 'Oh, do you know who he is?' 'Know who he is? Every 
other movie on television has his name on it!' All kinds of emotions flooded 
me: I was angry, I was depressed, I was moved. But mostly I felt very bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaiser, whose words run together faster and tighter than thoroughbreds 
rounding a turn at Churchill Downs, is a man with a boyish face that lights up 
when the theater lights go down. He is an encyclopedia of movie trivia who 
worked as a film librarian for a year before earning a nursing degree to make 
ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
"It was unbearable to think of Lyle reduced to the situation he was in without 
his Oscars," he said. "Tears came to my eyes. I decided right there to act, to 
do everything I could within my power to restore those Oscars to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaiser tracked down Malcolm Willits, an acknowledged Hollywood artifact expert 
who conducts monthly auctions from his Collector's Book Store, one of the 
world's largest collections of Hollywood memorabilia, on Hollywood Boulevard at 
Vine Street. Since last March, Willits has auctioned or sold six Oscars for an 
average price of $12,000. Willits was to auction the "Anne Frank" Oscar on 
March 7 on behalf of the Long Beach couple until a temporary restraining order 
was issued to Willits by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Superior Court order was intended to prevent February's 
scheduled auction of a duplicate of producer Mike Todd's 1956 best picture 
Oscar for "Around the World in 80 Days," put up for sale by his grandson, Cyrus 
Todd. (The original is reportedly locked in a Swiss bank vault belonging to 
Elizabeth Taylor, Todd's wife when he received the award.) Oscar recipients 
sign an agreement upon acceptance that requires them or their heirs to offer 
the gold-plated statuettes back to the academy for the sum of $1 before ever 
attempting to sell or dispose of them. 
</P>
<P>
Until the Todd matter was settled, Willits decided to pull the "Anne Frank" 
Oscar off the auction block. But he did not remove it from private sale. 
</P>
<P>
"The academy bylaws were not carried down from Mt. Sinai by Moses, and they're 
not constitutional," said Willits, who received a 20% commission for sale of 
the "Anne Frank" Oscar. "They're forcing people who want to sell Oscars to 
skulk in back alleys, where real values can't be established. I don't like the 
academy telling us what we can and can't sell. We've never coerced anyone into 
selling an Oscar. They come to us. It's a free market, and I'm an auctioneer." 
</P>
<P>
(In a judgment Friday, the restraining order was upheld and Willits was issued 
a permanent injunction, effectively barring the further sale or auction of the 
Todd Oscar. Willits is considering an appeal.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not condone the sale of Oscars," Kaiser said. "In fact, I'm adamantly 
opposed to them. In this case, I think it was a necessary evil (to participate 
in the purchase). It was the only avenue I had available to restore Lyle's 
Oscar to him." 
</P>
<P>
Although the academy has gone to great lengths recently to prevent the sale and 
auctioning of statuettes, executive administrator Bruce Davis said: "Any 
arrangement that results in the return of Lyle Wheeler's Oscars to the hands of 
their rightful owner is justified with the academy." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, there is a move afoot by a group of older Academy members to 
grant Wheeler an honorary Academy Award during Oscar ceremonies Wednesday 
night. "We feel that Lyle has been maligned by the academy," said 
actress-journalist Vanessa Brown, 61, a longtime academy member. "We feel he 
deserves to be honored with a humanitarian award while he's still living." 
</P>
<P>
At press time, the academy had no plans to present its Gene Hersholt 
Humanitarian Award this year, a spokesman said. The board of governors, which 
selects recipients for the award, last met Feb. 13, two days before the Oscar 
nominations were announced, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The bounty paid for the "Anne Frank" statuette is the most ever for an Oscar. 
Kaiser, who earned about $37,000 a year as a hospital administrator and nurse 
before he quit his job in December, used the money he and his wife had been 
saving since their marriage 16 years ago to honor Wheeler with the award. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not upset where the money is going," said Joan Kaiser Wednesday from her 
home in Tuxedo Park, as she prepared to fly the couple's two children to 
California to be with their father. "We're not taking food out of our mouths. 
It was savings we had in the bank. Bill has always loved movies, and this is 
just a natural extension of his passions. I always knew he would end up in 
Hollywood somehow." 
</P>
<P>
"I think Bill is just an extremely generous movie fan who feels that an 
injustice has been done," said 31-year-old Brook Wheeler, who plans in April to 
move his father into the Motion Picture and Television Country Home and 
Hospital, a retirement home in Woodland Hills for indigent and ill people from 
the entertainment industry. "We can't understand why he's doing this, but 
that's because we're so jaded out here. I sort of wondered why other members of 
the entertainment industry, who are aware of this situation, haven't come forth 
to reckon with it."

 Davis reported that since Wheeler's story was made public last month, a number 
of former award winners have contacted the academy to inform him they are 
making arrangements to bequeath their Oscars back to the academy upon their 
deaths. Wheeler, too, has stipulated that the "Anne Frank" Oscar will be 
returned to the academy when he dies. 
</P>
<P>
One Oscar purchased in a Willits' auction was returned this month. Universal 
Studios theme park in Florida paid the previous record, $17,715, for Thomas 
Little's 1941 black-and-white interior-decoration Oscar for "How Green Was My 
Valley." When the parent company in Universal City got wind of the purchase, it 
reacted quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"I returned the Oscar personally to (academy president) Richard Kahn on behalf 
of MCA," said David Weitzner, Universal's president of worldwide marketing. 
"We're more sensitive to these issues on the West Coast. I'm an academy member 
and take my membership very seriously. If we had known that it was being 
purchased, we never would have approved the sale." 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach couple, Sherry, 42, and her live-in companion, Tom, 31 (they do 
not wish to reveal their surnames), say they have no immediate plans for the 
remaining four Wheeler Oscars. The couple are reportedly going to use their 
share of the $17,000 they received for the "Anne Frank" Oscar to remodel their 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"If we could afford to give up something so valuable, we would," said Sherry in 
a telephone interview she initiated Wednesday. "We couldn't be happier that the 
Oscar is going back to Lyle. And people are happy for us, too. They say, 
'Congratulations, you deserve it.' We're not bad people. But the press has 
turned us into monsters." 
</P>
<P>
 By purchasing the "Anne Frank" Oscar and returning it to Wheeler, Kaiser said 
he hopes to kill the market for future Oscar sales. Willits, who recently put 
his entire memorabilia collection up for sale, has not made it clear whether he 
will give up Oscar auctioning if his store sells. 
</P>
<P>
"People sit there in their easy chair and say, 'Oh, if I had those Oscars I'd 
give them back,' " Sherry said. "But they wouldn't. It's human nature. Money 
isn't what life is all about, but it's important. It's what we need to 
survive." 
</P>
<P>
"There's too much talk of money," Kaiser said. "There's a moral issue involved. 
A human issue. People have to think more about other people. You can't put a 
dollar sign in front of everything. There are some things that just don't have 
a monetary value." 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser quit nursing three months ago to pursue his dream of working in film or 
television production. When asked if the purchase of Wheeler's Oscar was a 
publicity stunt to launch his career, Wheeler's shining eyes went blank. 
</P>
<P>
"I may be naive, but when I called Willits, I figured he probably had already 
received 100 offers just like mine," Kaiser said softly. Willits told The Times 
that he had received no other offers to purchase any of Wheeler's Oscars for 
return to him. "I suppose I didn't know what I was doing," Kaiser said. "I just 
knew what I had to do. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good. Yeah, I feel good about this whole thing. I'm just glad I was 
able to get the Oscar and return it. I felt like if I could just hand the Oscar 
to Lyle and see a smile on his face, that would be enough. If nothing else 
comes of it, I will always carry this feeling with me -- what I was able to do 
for somebody else."

FUSION CLAIM SPARKS RUSH TO DUPLICATE EXPERIMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Claims by two scientists that they have produced fusion at room temperature set 
off a chain reaction throughout the country Friday, as scientists in dozens of 
laboratories began preparing to duplicate the experiment. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people around the country will be trying to do it," said nuclear 
astrophysicist Charles A. Barnes of Caltech. 
</P>
<P>
The flurry of activity followed a dramatic -- and highly controversial -- 
announcement Thursday at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. B. Stanley 
Pons, chairman of the university's department of chemistry, and Martin 
Fleischmann, professor of electrochemistry at the University of Southampton, 
England, claimed to have produced fusion energy from a simple, table-top 
device. 
</P>
<P>
They also said they had produced more energy than it took to run their 
apparatus, which would amount to a breakthrough that no one else in the world 
has been able to do, despite the expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars 
over the last three decades. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was met with what a spokesman for MIT described as "extreme 
skepticism," because the experiment goes against the understanding of the 
physics of fusion and it has not been verified by other scientists. However, 
Pons and Fleischmann picked up some early support Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Teller, director emeritus of the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory and a 
legendary pioneer in fusion research, said the experiment "sounds extremely 
promising." 
</P>
<P>
"Initially, my opinion was that it could never happen," Teller said. "I'm 
extremely happy now, because I see a very good chance that I was completely 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the Livermore facility met with Teller Friday to map their 
strategy for trying to repeat the experiment. 
</P>
<P>
Some other scientists, however, treated the Utah claims with incredulity, 
partly because the scientists announced their findings through a press 
conference, instead of publishing their work in a professional journal where it 
would be subjected to peer review. 
</P>
<P>
"That makes you suspicious," said Robert G. Sachs, professor emeritus of 
chemistry at the University of Chicago and a former director of the Argonne 
National Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Similar Claims 
</P>
<P>
Sachs recalled similar claims nearly two decades ago from three independent 
research teams in the United States, the Soviet Union and China. U.S. 
researchers thought they had achieved fusion at room temperature with a similar 
technique, but Sachs said it turned out that the apparatus had somehow picked 
up high voltage from some other nearby experiment, causing some fusion to occur 
in a very inefficient system. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of years later, he was touring China and was shown a "table-top 
apparatus," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They said they had produced fusion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sachs said he told the Chinese scientists about the earlier U.S. experience, 
and two weeks later they abandoned their experiment after they realized they 
were not getting the results they had thought. 
</P>
<P>
Pons and Fleischmann have done their experiment repeatedly over the last five 
years, sometimes for stretches of 100 hours, and associates say they are not 
likely to have made that kind of mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"Stan Pons and Martin Fleischmann are both brilliant," said Charles Martin, an 
electrochemist at Texas A&amp;M. "I know them well." 
</P>
<P>
He described them as highly professional, dedicated scientists who would not 
have publicized their results had they not been totally satisfied that they are 
right. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people say this doesn't make a lot of sense, but a lot of science 
doesn't make sense initially," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he expected to duplicate the experiment, he responded: 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying it right now." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Newspaper Accounts 
</P>
<P>
He said it will be several days, at least, before he has any results. Martin 
and other scientists are expecting to have some difficulty repeating the 
experiment because -- as several scientists said Friday -- they have to base 
their experiments on newspaper accounts, because that has been their only 
source of information. 
</P>
<P>
Pons and Fleischmann are expected to publish a paper on their work in about a 
month in the British journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
Caltech's Barnes said the results claimed by the Utah team should be fairly 
easy to check. 
</P>
<P>
"A few thousand dollars will get you a few quarts of heavy water (water 
enriched in a form of hydrogen called deuterium) and a few hundred dollars will 
get you the palladium and platinum." 
</P>
<P>
Pons and Fleischmann wrapped a coil of platinum around a small cylinder of 
palladium and inserted it into a glass jar filled with heavy water. They said 
that when they applied a small current to the apparatus, the deuterium in the 
heavy water concentrated in the palladium tightly enough to produce fusion. 
</P>
<P>
Most fusion research projects are far more elaborate, using reactors that heat 
the fuel to hundreds of millions of degrees or powerful lasers that cause fuel 
pellets to implode. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes said the best way to verify the Utah experiment would be to set up a 
simple apparatus similar to Utah's and look for neutrons as evidence of the 
fusion reaction. When deuterium nuclei fuse, neutrons should be released. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Fusion Going On' 
</P>
<P>
"If you detect neutrons, that would tell you that you have fusion going on," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said scientists at Caltech were "certainly talking" about conducting their 
own experiments. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, so were a lot of other people. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Brown, director of technology transfer at the University of Utah, said 
he had been getting so many calls that he finally went home exhausted and took 
the phone off the hook. One was from Teller's office, he said, and two were 
from Fortune 500 companies interested in the technology. 
</P>
<P>
The University of Utah campus was virtually abandoned Friday, with most of the 
students and faculty celebrating spring break, but secretaries in the chemistry 
department said they had been getting calls from all over the world. Many of 
the callers were scientists interested in more details on the experiment so 
that they could try to duplicate it. 
</P>
<P>
The skepticism that has swept the nation as fast as the news of the 
announcement has also surfaced on the Utah campus. 
</P>
<P>
Graduate students took a story about the discovery and pasted it onto the front 
page of the National Enquirer, along with a story headlined "Baby Born With A 
Wooden Leg." Copies were pasted all over the chemistry building. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Initially Skeptical 
</P>
<P>
Ronald J. Pugmire, the university's associate vice president for research, said 
he was skeptical himself initially. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't believe it, because it defies the physics I knew about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Conventional wisdom holds that fuel would have to be heated to temperatures far 
greater than the core of the sun for fusion to occur. That is because deuterium 
nuclei have a positive charge and therefore would repel each other. Heat, 
however, would energize the particles, causing them to travel so fast that they 
could bang into each other and fuse before they could push each other apart. 
Some experiments have been conducted in "cold fusion," but that field was not 
expected to lead to the creation of fusion power plants. 
</P>
<P>
Pugmire began to overcome his skepticism after he did a lot of reading and 
asked a lot of questions, he added. Despite his earlier doubts, "the only 
conclusion one could come to was that fusion was occurring." 
</P>
<P>
Even many of Pons' colleagues at the university did not know of the experiments 
until Thursday's press conference. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been keeping it a pretty good secret," said chemist Peter Armentrout. 
"I've only heard rumors. But the implications are so significantly extensive 
that the secrecy may have been warranted." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Hazards 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other scientists warned that attempts to reproduce the experiment 
are not without some hazards. 
</P>
<P>
John Soures, a fusion researcher at the University of Rochester, said that if 
the Utah experiment actually produced four watts of power, as claimed by the 
two scientists, it would have also emitted a dangerous level of radioactive 
neutron particles. 
</P>
<P>
"It would require some shielding to prevent people in the vicinity from being 
irradiated," he said. "You wouldn't put it out in the open." 
</P>
<P>
But the process cannot be turned into an explosive device, according to 
Fleischmann, even though fusion is the process used in the hydrogen bomb. 
</P>
<P>
"I know of no way you could use this to make a bomb," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many scientists will be trying their own experiments over the next 
few months, especially after basic details are published in the professional 
journal in May. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Department of Energy contractor in Idaho, EG&amp;G Idaho Inc., announced 
plans Friday to conduct its own tests in May or June. 
</P>
<P>
Dough Holland, manager of EG&amp;G's fusion safety program, noted that fusion 
research has a history of "wild, flaky ideas." 
</P>
<P>
But, "we can't dismiss it," he said.

NEW OXFORD DICTIONARY -- IMPROVING ON THE ULTIMATE

<P>
The uninitiated may understandably wonder what all the fuss is about. 
</P>
<P>
Here's novelist Anthony Burgess calling it "the greatest publishing event of 
the century." It is to be marked by a half-day seminar and lunch at that bluest 
of blue-blood London hostelries, Claridge's. The guest list of 250 dignitaries 
is a literary "Who's Who." 
</P>
<P>
All this is to mark the publication next Thursday of the second edition of the 
Oxford English Dictionary -- the OED2 to the cogniscenti -- 61 years after the 
first edition. 
</P>
<P>
Claridge's for a dictionary? With this kind of build-up you might have expected 
at least some newly discovered work of Shakespeare. But then, the Oxford 
English Dictionary is to most other dictionaries what Shakespeare is to a comic 
book, or Stradivarius to a fiddle. 
</P>
<P>
Admirers say the 20-volume second edition should not even be mentioned in the 
same breath with the single-volume compendium of words that most of us keep on 
our bookshelves for help in writing term papers or cheating on crossword 
puzzles. It's like comparing a communications satellite with a walkie-talkie. 
</P>
<P>
This dictionary costs $2,500. It represents more than a century of awesome 
scholarship and has been dubbed no less than "the leading repository for the 
English language." But you can also read it for fun. 
</P>
<P>
The Independent newspaper's Sunday magazine called it "this monumental, 
indispensable, and slightly eccentric work." 
</P>
<P>
What makes the Oxford dictionary so special -- and so long -- are the nearly 
2.5 million quotations it uses to illustrate the evolution in meaning and 
context of each word, from its earliest recorded usage to an appropriate modern 
example. 
</P>
<P>
Like its less ambitious kin, the dictionary has a pronunciation guide, 
etymology, and definitions for each word, too. But the quotations put it in a 
different league by telling the story of a language. 
</P>
<P>
They reveal, for example, that in the 13th Century the word nice meant 
"ignorant." It took hundreds of years for it to take on its modern meaning of 
"pleasant," passing en route through "foolish," "over-scrupulous," and 
"precise." 
</P>
<P>
The dictionary's co-editor, Edmund Weiner described his role as more a 
historian of language than an arbiter of usage. He doesn't usually get upset 
when he hears someone misuse a word, Weiner said in an interview. He gets 
curious, wondering whether it is just part of the mysterious process by which a 
language grows. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Words as Actually Used 
</P>
<P>
The dictionary doesn't judge, either. It records the way words are actually 
used, even if grammarians and scholars disapprove. It also records their 
disapproval. 
</P>
<P>
The word fulsome, for example, used to mean "insincere." But because of 
confusion with the word "full," now it is often used when the speaker means 
"ample" or "generous." Thus, the "fulsome apology" once deemed hypocritical may 
now be acceptable, and that reality is duly noted in the dictionary. 
</P>
<P>
One of the 5,000 new words and meanings in the second edition is bad, which 
means "excellent" in modern American slang. 
</P>
<P>
Other new entries range from "AMEX" and "artsy-fartsy" to "palimony" and 
"yuppification." Medicine contributes "acupressure," "biofeedback," 
"brain-dead" and "passive smoking," while commerce offers "greenmail," "fast 
track" and "plastic money." 
</P>
<P>
Oxford University Press, publisher of both editions of the dictionary, claims 
that the English language grows by at least 450 words a year. Weiner believes 
that is a gross underestimate. Either way, it explains why the publisher has 
been running a losing race with words ever since 1879 when it first signed a 
contract with Britain's Philological Society to produce an authoritative 
dictionary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Self-Taught Lexicographer 
</P>
<P>
James A. H. Murray, a Scottish grammar school teacher and self-taught 
lexicographer, became the Oxford dictionary's first editor with the idea of 
producing a four-volume dictionary in 10 years. By the time he died 36 years 
later, in 1915, Murray had carried his project into the T's. His successors 
finally finished the 12-volume first edition in 1928, and as staggering an 
enterprise as it was, it was already far enough out of date that it needed a 
supplement. 
</P>
<P>
A one-volume supplement in 1933 was followed between 1972 and 1986 by four 
more. But well before the last supplement had appeared, Weiner, co-editor John 
Simpson, and their colleagues were hard at work on the completely new edition 
that debuts March 30. 
</P>
<P>
The new edition includes all the material from the original and the 
supplements, plus the new words and meanings. The additions, said Weiner, 
reflect the way in which the language is growing. 
</P>
<P>
There has been an "explosion" in words that were once proprietary, but which 
have now become "not just proper names, but also items of general culture," 
said Weiner. There were only a dozen or so in the first edition, he noted -- 
words like "Vaseline," "Thermos" and "Hoover." Among the scores of new such 
entries in the second edition are "Diner's Club," "Visa" and "Fortune 500." 
They are the modern equivalent, Weiner said, of the way that the names of 
geographical locations were once applied to generic carpets, wines, and other 
artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
"Rambo" rates more words in OED2 than he has spoken in some of his films. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Growth of Acronyms 
</P>
<P>
Acronyms are another growth category -- "probably one of the most important 
changes in word formation in the 20th Century," according to Weiner. Debuting 
in the second edition, for example, are "AIDS" (acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome), "AMEX" (American Express), "PIN" (personal identification number), 
and "START" (Strategic Arms Reduction Talks). 
</P>
<P>
One of Weiner's regrets about the new edition is its failure to include another 
acronym -- "DINK" (dual income, no kids). When the editors were compiling the 
"D" section of the dictionary a couple of years ago, he said, there wasn't 
enough evidence that the term would catch on. "It looked like it might be 
ephemeral." So it was left out. Now, said Weiner, he's convinced DINK is "a 
word of the '80s." 
</P>
<P>
The first edition, some say, was really a dictionary of British English. But to 
whatever extent that may have been true, it's much less so in the second 
edition. Weiner estimated that at least half the new words and meanings in the 
second edition originated in North America. 
</P>
<P>
"The English language is now really a big federation," the 38-year-old 
co-editor commented. And because it has the largest single concentration of 
native English speakers, North America is where there is the most dynamic 
change in the language. It may be an extraordinary view for an Englishman, 
Weiner acknowledged, but "we can't be Brito-centric and turn our back on the 
rest of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the dictionary's original editor, Murray, would probably be less 
surprised by the changes in his dictionary than by the changes in the way it is 
produced. Thanks to computer technology and international cooperation, the new 
edition required only five years to complete -- about one-tenth the time of its 
predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Printed in Maine 
</P>
<P>
The new edition was printed by Rand McNally in Maine, and computerized in 
Florida and Oxford using some remarkable software developed at the University 
of Waterloo, in Ontario, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the Oxford dictionary is computerized, said Weiner, it will be easier

TANKER SPILLS OIL AFTER HITTING REEF OFF ALASKA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

A Long Beach-bound Exxon oil tanker ran aground on a reef Friday and spilled an 
estimated 8.4 million gallons of crude oil into Alaska's Prince William Sound, 
a pristine Pacific waterway heavily used by kayakers, fishermen and tourists. 
It was the largest Alaskan oil spill ever. 
</P>
<P>
The Exxon Valdez, a 987-foot tanker owned by Exxon Shipping Co., rammed the 
reef about 25 miles from the city of Valdez, the northernmost ice-free port in 
the United States, at 12:30 a.m. Coast Guard officers speculated that the 
ship's captain may have been trying to avoid icebergs from the nearby Columbia 
Glacier when the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leak a Mere Trickle 
</P>
<P>
A representative of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said the tanker had been 
spilling oil at a rate of 10,000 barrels an hour but the Coast Guard said the 
leak had become a mere trickle by 2:30 p.m., Alaska time. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer John Gonzales said in a telephone interview from 
Valdez that the spill was staying "in the mid-channel" and did not seem to be 
moving toward the shore. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had no report of any wildlife hurt at this time," he said. But 
environmentalists feared that if the oil reached the shore, marine birds would 
be threatened. Herring hatch at this time of year and attract up to 20,000 sea 
birds for the feast. Environmentalists also expressed concern about whales, sea 
lions and other wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty people were aboard the ship but there were no immediate reports of 
injuries, said Dave Parish, a spokesman for Exxon USA, in a telephone interview 
from Anchorage. He said three planes from British Columbia, California and 
England had been dispatched to the scene for aerial spraying to dilute the oil. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales said 200,000 barrels spilled into the sea. Another Exxon tanker was 
attempting to pump the oil out of the crippled vessel, and two Coast Guard 
investigators were on board the Valdez, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Nelson, a deputy regional director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 
Anchorage, said the reef ripped a 150-foot gash in the vessel, which was 
carrying 1.2 million barrels of oil, and there was fear that the tanker could 
break apart further. 
</P>
<P>
"If it breaks up on the rocks, then anything could happen," he said in a 
telephone interview. The seas were calm Friday and the forecast was for 
continued calm until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Infuriated local residents and environmentalists complained about the slow pace 
of the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Critical of Efforts 
</P>
<P>
"Where was the crackerjack response team that was supposed to be out there? 
They are moving way too slowly," said University of Alaska professor Richard 
Steiner, who flew over the slick Friday. "There (was) no oil (cleanup 
equipment) out there and it's been 14 hours since it happened. 
</P>
<P>
"It is huge, literally huge," he said in a telephone interview from Cordova. 
"It looks devastating. The slick is probably five miles long by three miles 
wide. Fortunately, there is no wind. . . . We saw six sea lions inside the 
slick, swimming, trying to avoid it, and they had no idea which way to go." 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Lowry, Alaska regional director for Greenpeace, also complained about the 
pace of the cleanup. "It is more than 12 hours later and there is no (cleanup) 
boom, no sweepers. They are bringing equipment from as far away as England. It 
is just absurd that the equipment is not here already. . . . This will affect 
everything in the food chain, from crab larvae to orca whales." 
</P>
<P>
Exxon's Parish said everything possible was being done. "It takes time to get 
activated," he said. The immediate response to the spill was handled by crews 
from the terminal at Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Floating Oil Booms 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales, the Coast Guard spokesman, said the terminal has cleanup equipment on 
site for minor spills. He said employees of the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., 
which operates the trans-Alaska oil pipeline for a consortium of oil companies, 
were getting floating oil booms in place by late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Prince William Sound, home to orcas, sea otters and fur seals, is important to 
both the fishing and the recreation industries. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a gorgeous marine environment and ecosystem, with lots of little islands 
and inlets and bays," said Emily Barneet, Alaska issues specialist for the 
Sierra Club in Anchorage. "It's also a pretty well-established tourist 
attraction, with sailing and glacier viewing trips. Prince William is a gem." 
</P>
<P>
The spill is expected to add fuel to a campaign by environmentalists to prevent 
further oil development in Alaska, particularly in the Arctic National Wildlife 
Refuge. "It's of concern for two reasons: one is the size of the spill and that 
this is such a sensitive, very productive area," said Lisa Speer, senior staff 
scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York. "This is a 
consequence of North Slope oil development that is rarely mentioned." 
</P>
<P>
Valdez City Manager Doug Griffen told the Associated Press that the 800-mile 
trans-Alaska pipeline, which carries oil from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez and the 
marine terminal, has a good environmental record. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expected Worst 
</P>
<P>
"But this could be a catastrophic occurrence, so we're concerned," he said. 
"Living in Valdez, we've always worried that sometime something like this could 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper arrived in Valdez on Friday to evaluate the spill. He 
said that state officials were considering the use of chemicals to disperse and 
sink the oil. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that chemical use can have a bad effect on marine life," he 
said. "It's going to be a tough judgment call." 
</P>
<P>
Cowper said that conventional responses, such as booms, probably would not work 
because the spill is so large. "You probably couldn't do it (contain the spill) 
with all the equipment available in North America. This is a major spill by any 
reckoning. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been able to brag for a long time that there's never been a major oil 
spill in Valdez Harbor. Now, we can't do that anymore."

NEW U.S. POLICY ON CONTRAS TOLD; 
</P>
<P>
BUSH, CONGRESS AGREE TO DROP MILITARY OPTION 
</P>

<P>
Proclaiming a new era of bipartisan foreign relations, the Bush Administration 
and Democratic congressional leaders Friday announced a new policy for 
promoting democracy in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, Secretary of State James A. Baker III told reporters, 
leaders of the Democratic majority in Congress agreed to provide the 
Administration with "flexibility" in choosing how to prod Nicaragua toward 
democracy. In return, the Administration agreed to forswear, at least for now, 
the military option the Reagan Administration pursued both openly and covertly 
for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not claim the right to order the politics of Nicaragua," President Bush 
said. "That is for the Nicaraguan people to decide." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement could bring to an end one of the most divisive foreign policy 
battles of the last decade, and both Bush and the congressional leaders talked 
hopefully of setting a cooperative precedent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Necessary Ingredient' 
</P>
<P>
"Bipartisan foreign policy is something that's essential to a nation of our 
type," said House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.). "I think we're restoring that 
necessary ingredient." 
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan, Nicaragua's Contras will receive an additional $45 million 
in the 10 months before the Nicaraguan elections scheduled at the end of next 
February. That is the same level of support the Contras have received under the 
current aid package that expires at the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
But the new aid cannot be used for military purposes. Under an agreement signed 
by Bush and congressional leaders in the White House Cabinet Room on Friday 
morning, the money will provide food and shelter for the Contras in their 
Honduran base camps and assist them in "voluntary reintegration" into 
Nicaraguan society or "regional relocation." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, said Baker the Administration will use non-military 
"incentives and disincentives" to try to influence Nicaragua. Among the 
incentives is the possibility of lifting some of the U.S. embargoes that 
currently hobble Nicaraguan trade. 
</P>
<P>
The possible disincentives are less clear, however. A senior Administration 
official conceded that for now, "I can't say that we contemplate any." 
</P>
<P>
"We're saying, 'OK, let's go, let's put our chips on diplomacy,' " the official 
said. "If it's demonstrated that it doesn't work, then there would be a more 
conducive climate" for some alternative. 
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan government said in a statement from Managua that it considers 
the new approach an improvement over the policy of the Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bid to Save Face 
</P>
<P>
"We are not unaware that this type of bipartisan declaration was precisely what 
the United States government believed necessary to save face" after its 
previous failures, the Sandinista regime said. It said that it is "willing to 
give the United States government the benefit of the doubt" that serious 
efforts toward a diplomatic solution will be made. 
</P>
<P>
In Honduras, where most of the Contras are now sheltering in camps across the 
border from Nicaragua, Foreign Ministry spokesman Eugenio Castro was quoted by 
Reuters, the British news agency, as saying that the government, a close U.S. 
ally, supports the continuation of humanitarian aid as a means of preventing 
the rebel army from disintegrating into guerrilla bands. But he denied that the 
government had agreed to let the rebels stay until next February. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though the aid has been approved until February that doesn't mean the 
Contras are going to stay until February," Reuters reported Castro as saying. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency said Castro noted that the aid could also be used to demobilize 
and resettle the rebels, and that a timetable for such disbanding would depend 
on Central American presidents, who are due to meet in Honduras in May. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Months of Discussions 
</P>
<P>
The agreement between the executive and legislative branches came after months 
of bipartisan discussions that began almost immediately after the presidential 
election and ended only late this week. 
</P>
<P>
"It was two days after the election that I had a conversation with then 
President-elect Bush and we discussed the possibility of a bipartisan policy in 
Central America," Wright said Friday. In December, Wright discussed policy 
options with Baker over dinner and since then Baker has devoted much of his 
time to working out an agreement that he can now point to as the first major 
accomplishment of his term as secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
By last week, Baker had worked out the general terms of an accord with Senate 
Democrats and a group of moderate House members, but more liberal members of 
the House who have opposed Contra aid were not yet sold. The final breakthrough 
came in a meeting last Friday in Wright's office attended by the Speaker, 
Baker, House Majority Leader Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and Rep. David Obey 
(D-Wis.), chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees foreign programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Administration Agrees 
</P>
<P>
Obey insisted that Congress retain the right to kill the aid program if the 
Administration did not live up to its end of the bargain. On Wednesday night, 
Bernard Aronson, Baker's choice to be assistant secretary of state for Latin 
America, called Obey to say that the Administration had agreed to that 
provision. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Baker has sent a letter to Obey; his Senate counterpart, 
Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii), and the chairmen of the House Foreign Affairs and 
Senate Foreign Relations committees promising that money for the Contras "will 
not be obligated after Nov. 30" without the written approval of the 
congressional committees. 
</P>
<P>
In practice, said Obey, "absent some unanticipated change" in Administration 
policy, that approval will be readily forthcoming. But Democrats, still feeling 
burned by the Reagan Administration's covert efforts for the Contras, felt the 
need for that final provision as a "safety valve." 
</P>
<P>
Since the announcement of the package came after most members of Congress had 
left Washington for the Easter recess, reaction was muted. But backers of the 
plan, and even some of its opponents, predicted that it would prevail swiftly 
after Congress returns next month. Still there was dissatisfaction among some 
strong Contra supporters and some of their most ardent foes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like it," said California Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae), one of 
Congress' most adamant Contra opponents. "This agreement keeps them as a 
standing army," she said. But, she conceded: "Right now I think it will pass." 
</P>
<P>
A similar prediction came from Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas. 
"Not every Republican senator is enthusiastic about this," he said, noting that 
some of his more conservative colleagues worry that the plan will allow Contra 
opponents "to eliminate or take care of the Contras through relocation rather 
than . . . democracy in Nicaragua." But most, he suggested, would follow the 
President's lead. 
</P>
<P>
And on the House side, Rep. Mickey Edwards, a conservative member of the 
Republican leadership from Oklahoma and a chief supporter of the Contras, 
predicted "near unanimous" support for the plan in GOP ranks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aid Linkage Cited 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the program I would have written," Edwards said, but it is "more than 
we could have gotten otherwise." Most importantly from his standpoint, Edwards 
said, the new policy statement explicitly links aid to the Contras with 
Nicaragua's willingness to continue democratic reforms. Nicaraguan officials, 
he said, have been trying to separate the two, saying that the Contras should 
be disbanded first with full democracy to follow later. 
</P>
<P>
If the new policy achieves even partial success in its twin goals of moving 
Nicaragua toward democracy and reducing Soviet influence in Central America, it 
would provide the Administration with a foreign policy triumph that eluded two 
American presidents, Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter, in the decade since the 
Sandinistas overthrew the late dictator Anastasio Somoza. 
</P>
<P>
But even in advance of any results, the declaration of the new policy achieved 
one significant victory for the new Administration. For four years, Contra aid 
has been a constant battle, in large part because "there was an element of 
distrust toward President Reagan" on the part of Democrats, said Edwards, "a 
belief that he would not keep an agreement to end aid." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, by contrast, Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) set a 
far different tone: "I trust the President and the secretary of state," he 
said.

'STAR WARS' SATELLITE PUT IN ORBIT AND QUICKLY SPOTS A TEST TARGET

A Delta Star missile-hunting satellite thundered into orbit Friday and quickly 
spotted a target as it began a key months-long test to develop a split-second 
"Star Wars" defense against nuclear rockets. 
</P>
<P>
The payload's sensors passed their first trial within two hours after launching 
when they successfully tracked the thrusting second stage of the Delta booster 
rocket after separation and during its fiery destruction in the atmosphere over 
the Indian Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"We watched that burn with the sensors; we not only got the second stage 
burning but we also got the re-entry and breakup," said Air Force Col. Michael 
Rendine, program manager for the Strategic Defense Initiative Office. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Perfecting Technology 
</P>
<P>
Over the next several months, the $140-million satellite is to aim its sensors 
at a series of ground-based missile and space launches to help perfect the 
technology for detecting and destroying enemy boosters within minutes after 
they leave their launching pads. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers will seek to gather rocket exhaust data against the background of 
the North Pole region, an area through which attacking Soviet missiles would 
travel. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force officials said that the Delta Star experiment is part of research 
being done for the Strategic Defense Initiative, also known as "Star Wars," to 
develop a space-based missile defense system. 
</P>
<P>
The three-ton satellite carries a laser radar, seven video imaging cameras and 
an infrared imager. A Laser Illumination Detection System is designed to spot 
ground-based laser firings, a capability that would permit future satellites to 
take evasive action. 
</P>
<P>
Using a 48-jet thruster aiming system, Delta Star has the capability to 
maneuver into position to spot the blazing plume of missiles and rockets to be 
launched over the next several months from the space center; Wallops Island, 
Va.; White Sands, N. M.; Poker Flats, Alaska; Barking Sands, Hawaii, and, 
possibly, from Soviet launching sites. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Identifying Exhaust Signature 
</P>
<P>
In addition to quickly sighting a rocket plume, Delta Star sensors are expected 
to gather information to help distinguish the exhaust signature from such 
backgrounds as land, ocean, horizon, space, atmospheric effects and the bright 
aurora borealis in the North Pole region. 
</P>
<P>
The polar background information is critical because Soviet missiles would 
travel through that region in any attack on the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The launching was the third in a series. In a 1986 test, two satellites tracked 
each other and one destroyed the other by crashing into it.

LEBANON'S AOUN VOWS TO OUST SYRIANS

The leader of Lebanon's embattled Christians vowed Friday to drive Syrian 
forces out of the country whatever the price. 
</P>
<P>
As an Arab League peacemaker shuttled between Muslim West Beirut and the 
Christian east side of the capital, Gen. Michel Aoun told a press conference 
that he would not settle for "anything less than a Syrian withdrawal from 
Lebanon." 
</P>
<P>
"I am not afraid of the results of the battle," the 53-year-old leader of the 
mostly Christian Lebanese army said. "It's true that the Syrians are stronger 
militarily . . . but the battle will cost them a high price." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To Seek Foreign Help 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in battle fatigues as he spoke to reporters at the presidential palace 
in suburban Baabda, Aoun, who heads a military Cabinet rejected by Lebanon's 
Muslims, pledged to seek foreign help to oust the Syrian forces, which number 
25,000 in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
"If the United States and Europe are not interested in our cause, other 
countries are," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He mentioned no names. Iraq, Syria's longtime enemy, is an active supporter of 
the Christian forces. The army has also received training from the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, a U.S. Embassy spokesman in Beirut said a military technical 
assistance team of three American officers was being pulled out of Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
"We are withdrawing the . . . team at the Defense Ministry as part of the 
embassy's policy of reducing American personnel due to the current situation," 
the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Beirut and its suburbs have been rattled by artillery battles for more than two 
weeks. At least 80 Lebanese have been killed and more than 250 wounded in the 
shelling, which began when Aoun imposed a blockade on harbors run by the 
country's sectarian militias. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called War of the Ports was aimed at re-establishing government control 
-- and taxation -- at the harbors. 
</P>
<P>
The Muslim artillery of Druze leader Walid Jumblatt and Aoun's Christian 
gunners have done most of the shelling, but this week there have been 
unconfirmed reports that Syrian artillerymen have fired on Christian targets. 
</P>
<P>
The Syrians entered Lebanon during the 1975-76 Muslim-Christian civil war -- to 
protect the Christians -- at the behest of the Arab League. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, a new Arab League peace effort was under way to stem the fighting and 
to try to work out a lasting political settlement in Lebanon. Ahmed Jassim, the 
Kuwaiti ambassador to Syria, crossed the dangerous line from east to west and 
back for talks with Lebanon's two rival ad hoc governments: Aoun's in the east 
and a caretaker Muslim government headed by Salim Hoss in the west. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Central Government 
</P>
<P>
The country has not had a central government since late last year, when a 
parliamentary quorum could not be raised to vote on a replacement for outgoing 
president Amin Gemayel, a Christian. 
</P>
<P>
Jassim would not discuss details of his talks but disclosed that they centered 
on the current fighting. 
</P>
<P>
A Good Friday lull in the artillery battles eased tension in the capital and 
people who had taken cover in basements and other shelters emerged and pressed 
shop owners to open and enable them to stock up on food before the fighting 
resumed. 
</P>
<P>
And, after a 14-hour lull, the fighting did resume. Hundreds of rounds fell on 
both sides of the line dividing Beirut and on Druze and Christian towns in the 
mountains overlooking the capital, police said.

Workers at a cement company discovered explosives inside an Easter cake sent to 
their boss in an apparent extortion attempt, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The extortion racket apparently was linked to the Naples Mafia, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Two unidentified men on Thursday delivered a colomba -- a special Italian 
Easter cake -- addressed to Pasquale Raucci, the owner of a cement company in 
Mercogliano, about 25 miles northeast of Naples. 
</P>
<P>
On opening the package, workers found the cake contained a detonator and 
slow-burning fuse. They called police who defused the bomb. 
</P>
<P>
Raucci, 44, has recently received anonymous telephone threats telling him to 
cancel work contracts in the Port of Naples area, the Italian news agency ANSA 
reported.

CHRISTIAN PILGRIMS MARK GOOD FRIDAY

<P>
Hundreds of Christian pilgrims wept, prayed and sang hymns along the Via 
Dolorosa in Jerusalem's Old City in a Good Friday procession that retraced the 
path that tradition holds Jesus took to his Crucifixion. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen devotees carried heavy wooden crosses to symbolize Christ's walk 
of agony, and many knelt for communal prayers at the 14 stations that mark the 
route. 
</P>
<P>
A costumed group from Southern California, complete with a thorn-crowned Christ 
figure, performed along the way. A minor scuffle broke out when Roman Catholic 
and Protestant groups crossed paths, each demanding right of way. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lower Turnout 
</P>
<P>
The turnout was considerably lower than in past years, reflecting fears over 
the 15-month Palestinian revolt that has torn the Israeli-occupied West Bank 
and Gaza Strip and spilled into Arab East Jerusalem. No major violence was 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
At the Vatican on Good Friday, Pope John Paul II heard confessions from seven 
worshipers at St. Peter's Basilica. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a dark mantle over his white cassock, the Pope spent 70 minutes hearing 
the confessions of a 29-year-old West German religion teacher, two Roman bus 
drivers, two Italian army cadets and a mother and son from the northern Italian 
city of Verona. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Carrying the Cross 
</P>
<P>
In the evening the pontiff carried a 6-foot wooden cross through Rome's ancient 
Colosseum symbolizing Christ's walk to his Crucifixion on Calvary Hill. 
</P>
<P>
The Polish-born Pope started hearing confessions on Good Friday shortly after 
his election in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Holy Week observances culminate on Easter Sunday when the Pope celebrates mass 
in St. Peter's Square and delivers his twice-yearly "Urbi et Orbi" (to the city 
and the world) address from the central balcony of the basilica. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
7 Nailed to Crosses 
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, at least seven people were nailed to crosses and thousands 
of Filipinos drew blood by beating themselves on the back to symbolize the 
suffering of Christ. About 5,000 people attended the ritual in San Pedro Citud, 
40 miles north of Manila. 
</P>
<P>
In Bulacan province, Luciana Reyes, 30, had her palms and feet nailed to a 
wooden cross for the 13th straight year. Another woman was also to have been 
crucified, but she screamed in pain when the nails pierced her palms and the 
crucifixion was stopped. 
</P>
<P>
This year, for the first time, the government's Department of Tourism financed 
the spectacle in San Pedro Citud. 
</P>
<P>
Stalls selling food, soft drinks, beer, straw hats, fans and other souvenirs 
lined the area. 
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, scores of city police and paramilitary border forces armed with 
automatic rifles, tear-gas grenades and riot batons were moved into the Old 
City to ensure security for worshipers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Street of Sorrow 
</P>
<P>
The procession swept through the Via Dolorosa, or Sorrowful Road, to the Church 
of the Holy Sepulcher, where tradition holds Christ was buried after dying at 
the hands of the Roman rulers of the Holy Land. 
</P>
<P>
The main procession was led by 20 Roman Catholic Franciscan monks. About 600 
worshipers followed, a fraction of the crowd that traditionally participates. 
</P>
<P>
The group that provided the street theater was made up of residents of Southern 
California. Ralph Beltran of Los Angeles portrayed Christ, his head crowned 
with thorns. His companions, dressed as Roman guards, pretended to flog him as 
he dragged a wooden cross through the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Joanne Petranela of Brea costumed as Mary Magdalene, ran among astonished 
onlookers shouting, "It's all my fault!" 
</P>
<P>
A German pilgrim from Munich, who identified himself only as Helmut, termed the 
show "a disgrace to Christianity." 
</P>
<P>
A scuffle broke out when the procession crossed the path of a Protestant group 
moving in another direction. Police stepped in to stop fistfights, then quickly 
set up a barricade.

BELGIUM ACCUSES SUSPECT'S LAWYER IN KIDNAPING OF FORMER PRIME MINISTER

The lawyer of an alleged gang leader being hunted for the kidnaping of a former 
Belgian prime minister has been arrested on suspicion of masterminding the 
abduction, the prosecutors office said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Michel Vander Elst, 41, was placed under arrest after nine hours of questioning 
on suspicion of being "the author, co-author or an accomplice in the kidnap" of 
Paul Vanden Boeynants, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Other accusations included extortion and forgery. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer denied the accusations, saying he was faced with the problem of 
professional secrecy in defending himself, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gang Leader Hunted 
</P>
<P>
Vander Elst represents Patrick Haemers, 36, the alleged leader of a gang being 
hunted by police for a string of unsolved violent crimes, including the 
kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
Vanden Boeynants, 69, was abducted in the garage of his Brussels home on Jan. 
14 and released a month later after a ransom of up to $2.5 million had been 
paid. A controversial politician, Vanden Boeynants was prime minister from 1966 
to 1968 and again from 1978 to 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said there were three elements which led to Vander Elst's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
He had seen some of the suspected kidnapers after they had rented a villa in 
the northern French resort of Le Touquet, where Vanden Boeynants was manacled 
to a wall during his captivity. The lawyer had also received phone calls from 
public booths in Le Touquet. 
</P>
<P>
In addition his fingerprints were found in a Brussels apartment police think 
the gang used when it planned the kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
Haemers, billed as Belgium's public enemy No. 1, has been on the run since 
escaping from police custody 19 months ago.

6 CONTRAS EXPELLED IN SLAYING OF SUSPECTED SPY; 1 CONVICTED OF RAPE

The Nicaraguan rebels announced Friday that they have expelled six officers and 
men, including their chief of intelligence and the head of one of their 
regional commands, for complicity in the torture and murder of a suspected 
Sandinista infiltrator. 
</P>
<P>
The chief of the regional command, a guerrilla who went by the nom de guerre 
"Commander Nolan," was also found guilty of raping two female members of his 
own command. 
</P>
<P>
The case grew out of the torture and murder last year of a rebel named 
"Managua," who was suspected of being a secret agent for the Sandinistas. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials learned of the unexplained murder last December and pressed the 
Contras to investigate. The ensuing inquiry turned up evidence of torture of 
several prisoners and mistreatment of Contra troops by the officers of the 
Quilali Regional Command. 
</P>
<P>
Two Contras, code-named "Israelita" and "Pandillero," were found guilty of the 
murder. Another, "Rambo," was found guilty of torture. 
</P>
<P>
The chief of Contra military intelligence, "Commander Mack," was found guilty 
of complicity in covering up the murder, along with an aide, "Ali." 
</P>
<P>
"This was a tragic case, but we have investigated it properly and held a fair 
trial," said Bosco Matamoros, the Contras' Washington spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official noted, however, that some Contra officers had known of the case 
but apparently took no steps to investigate until American officials pressed 
for action.

CHINA'S MILITARY BUDGET TO DROP 6% DESPITE OFFICERS' PROTESTS

<P>
China's military spending will drop about 6% in real terms this year despite 
the opposition of some military officers, it was reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The New China News Agency said officers met with President Yang Shangkun and 
called for higher defense spending and advanced equipment for the army. 
</P>
<P>
Yang denied their requests, saying defense spending would rise only when the 
economy improves. Yang is vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, 
which sets military policy. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency carried two reports on the subject Friday. Both were unusual 
for revealing disagreements between the military, or People's Liberation Army, 
and the government. A series of cuts in defense spending in recent years is 
known to have been unpopular with the military. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, China had released its 1989 budget proposal that grants the 
military $6.5 billion. Last year's budget was $5.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the news agency said that if inflation is factored into the budget, 
China's defense spending will actually fall 6% next year. China is facing 36% 
inflation, the highest since the Communist takeover in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
Liu Mingpu, deputy director of the General Logistics Department of the People's 
Liberation Army, said that in recent years the growth rate of the military 
budget has been much lower than inflation. 
</P>
<P>
He said that from 1950 to 1980, defense spending accounted for 17.2% of China's 
state expenditures. In 1988, he said, it accounted for only 7.49%. 
</P>
<P>
China is undertaking an ambitious program to professionalize its army. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, the army abandoned Mao Tse-tung's "people's war" strategy 
for guerrilla warfare, under which China would use the largest number of people 
in the smallest space and try to overwhelm its enemy. Heavy losses suffered in 
1979 during a border war with Vietnam showed the strategy's weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
In the last nine years, at least 1 million troops have been cut from the 
military, which now has fewer than 3 million in uniform.

U.S. OFFICIAL URGES SUDAN FAMINE RELIEF IN 'RACE AGAINST TIME' 
</P>

<P>
A top U.S. official, saying "it's a race against time," called Friday for 
nations around the world, including the Soviet Union, to do more to support an 
international famine-relief effort organized during a break in Sudan's civil 
war. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wants peace, but peace will be a hollow victory if the people for 
whom peace is the goal are not alive because we can't deliver the food in time 
to save them," said Julia V. Taft, director of the Office of Foreign Disaster 
Assistance in the Agency for International Development. 
</P>
<P>
Taft spoke at a news briefing about the U.S. role in "Operation Lifeline," the 
U.N.-sponsored effort to deliver more than 100,000 tons of food to more than 1 
million people during April. Participants describe the project as the largest 
effort of its kind in a developing nation. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 people face starvation unless the food can be delivered 
during the agreed-upon "month of tranquillity" in Sudan's conflict. 
</P>
<P>
The United Nations estimated that more than 250,000 Sudanese died of starvation 
last year because food deliveries were impeded by both the government and 
southern rebels, who have been battling for more than six years. 
</P>
<P>
The object of the operation is to deliver the food by train, truck, barge and 
air to remote areas in the south before seasonal rains and floods make routes 
impassable. 
</P>
<P>
Taft will be in the region next week with a congressional delegation. On 
Capitol Hill, Rep. Mickey Leland (D-Tex.), a member of the delegation, said 
Friday that he would press for a meeting with the leader of Sudan's rebels to 
seek a permanent settlement of the conflict and assure safe passage of 
emergency food supplies. 
</P>
<P>
"We have seen the demise of food convoys. Airlifts of food have been destroyed, 
planes have been shot down, convoys have been captured," Leland said. "I hope 
to develop routes to facilitate food convoys." 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the emergency relief effort, Taft said: "It's a race against time." 
Unless the Sudanese government, the rebels, the United Nations and the donor 
nations pull together over the next few weeks, she said, "We will see a repeat 
of last year's horror." 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the project is $132 million, $55 million of which still must be 
raised. 
</P>
<P>
Taft said the United States has arranged to provide about $30 million and is 
trying to arrange for an additional $10 million to pay for a "food swap" that 
would trade some foods in Sudan for others that certain Sudanese need. 
</P>
<P>
The $30 million is in addition to $72 million in various forms of aid that the 
United States has pledged to Sudan since February, Taft said. 
</P>
<P>
But the United States is concerned, Taft said, because many nations that have 
pledged to help the U.N. relief program with food now need to come forward with 
cash in the emergency effort. 
</P>
<P>
"We will deliver. But we're quite concerned that the other donors were not 
forthcoming.. . . For some reason, we're out there in front and we would like 
to expand the participation of other donors in this urgent effort," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Taft said the international community is hopeful that nations such as Japan and 
Saudi Arabia can assist the effort. 
</P>
<P>
She said she fears that because the crisis has not had the media coverage of 
the 1984 Ethiopia famine or the Soviet earthquake, the world community is not 
aware of the severity of the tragedy.

It will be a happy Easter for Kaye Clarke and her obedience-award winning dog,

<P>
That's because the Michigan Court of Appeals held Friday that a rule limiting 
the size of dogs in her condominium complex is unreasonable and unenforceable.

The Bear Creek Condominium Assn. filed the suit to force Clarke, 47, to get rid

WHITE HOUSE STAFF'S EARLY FUMBLES MAY BRING QUICK SHAKE-UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
That's John H. Sununu, the new White House chief of staff, coming down the 
slopes on a late winter day in the mountains of New Hampshire, looking a little 
like a friendly, bundled-up pear on skis. He pulls to a neat stop in front of a 
waiting television camera crew to take questions about that weekend's charity 
ski event. 
</P>
<P>
But the reporter wants to know about a much less pleasant topic -- the failing 
nomination of John Tower to be secretary of defense. In a minute and a huff, 
Sununu skis away from the interview -- only to tumble into the snow 10 feet 
away from the rolling camera. Wipeout. 
</P>
<P>
Now, three weeks later, there is mounting concern that Sununu and his staff are 
crashing into snowbanks of a different kind as they try to guide President Bush 
through the political gates of the Washington slalom. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Criticism of Three Areas 
</P>
<P>
In at least three crucial areas -- the personnel shop, the office directing 
Bush's relations with Congress and the team responsible for communicating 
Bush's message to the public -- the staff already has come under sharp 
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"There has got to be some sort of shake-up," said one senior Administration 
official who asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
And one senior White House official, while acknowledging no major problems, 
suggested that changes eventually may be made. "We went into this knowing that 
at some point we might want to bring in a few (new) people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's staff members and other supporters -- more than a dozen of whom were 
interviewed for this report -- unanimously believe that the President and his 
aides have ample time to recover. 
</P>
<P>
"They've had a couple of stumbles," said one close adviser to the President, 
speaking, like many others, on condition that he not be identified. "But 
whatever mistakes might have been made will be corrected. It's a learning curve 
for them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agreement Marks Progress 
</P>
<P>
As one sign of progress, after weeks of behind-the-scenes negotiations led by 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Bush announced Friday an agreement with 
congressional Democrats over renewed non-military aid for Nicaragua's Contra 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
However, complained one former campaign aide as he reviewed the roster of 
generally young and inexperienced White House staff members: "They've taken a 
bunch of grade B ballplayers, and they've taken them to the World Series. They 
have no long-ball hitter." 
</P>
<P>
Staff shortcomings share the blame for a variety of problems that President 
Bush has encountered in his first two months in office. 
</P>
<P>
Most notable was the failure to mobilize quickly enough to save the Tower 
nomination in the Senate. When Bush visited Asia at the height of the 
confirmation battle, none of the most senior staff remained in Washington to 
carry the President's message to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Upsetting' 
</P>
<P>
One long-time Bush supporter, pointing in particular to the handling of the 
Tower nomination, said: "George Bush's Administration is not going to rise or 
fall over what goes on these first few weeks, but it is symptomatic. It's a 
very upsetting thing." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the Administration initially fumbled when the savings and loan crisis 
landed at the White House like a greased watermelon in the opening days of the 
Administration. When one of Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady's initial 
plans -- a tax on savings and checking accounts -- bombed politically, Sununu 
chose initially not to repudiate it but to say that it remained under study. 
</P>
<P>
There are signs that the White House staff is beginning to react more sharply 
to problems. A senior aide to a Cabinet member said that although the staff 
members were late in focusing on the Eastern Airlines strike, "when they did, 
they were ready to go." 
</P>
<P>
More broadly, observers of the White House staff are quick to criticize what 
they perceive as its failure to help Bush communicate a vision of what he wants 
to do as President. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calls Staff Ineffective 
</P>
<P>
"The White House staff is inexperienced, remarkably ineffective in focusing 
Bush, in setting an agenda that can be communicated easily to the American 
public and the world," said a Republican who is well-placed to assess the 
President's aides. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a sense of miscalculating, a lack of accurate information, an 
inability to look forward, an inability to strategize on the mix of issues and 
an inability to get Bush to play offense on the issues." 
</P>
<P>
Sununu, at a recent weekend conference of senior Bush advisers and Republican 
legislators in Charlottesville, Va., was asked about the President's agenda, 
according to one person who was there. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what we're here to find out," Sununu reportedly responded. "What do you 
think it ought to be?" 
</P>
<P>
Another Republican, whose job as a lobbyist puts him in contact with key 
figures throughout Washington, complained that no one is overseeing the effort 
to convey the President's message to the American public. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wants Efforts Concentrated 
</P>
<P>
"That is the job that should shepherd the resources of the presidency and 
marshal them on one, two, three or four big things until they are 
accomplished," said this Bush ally. Instead, "they are doing 48 things and all 
of them badly." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan, said Michael K. Deaver, a former close aide, "had broad themes. He 
didn't want to get stuck in the minutiae of how it happened. A lot of what 
George Bush has to do is refine and clean up and extend what happened (under 
Reagan). He might be the best guy to do that because he understands" how the 
government works. 
</P>
<P>
When Reagan assumed the presidency in 1981, he had the advantage of succeeding 
a Democrat. And, for his staff, he had his pick of Republicans eager to press 
ahead with his conservative agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, by contrast, has moved to the White House at a time when ideological 
fervor has subsided. Consequently, said a former Reagan White House aide who 
was closely involved in the Bush transition, the appeal of working in the White 
House has ebbed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Begins With Roosevelt 
</P>
<P>
The broad structure of the current White House staff dates back to the 1939 
reorganization of the office of the presidency, which gave Franklin D. 
Roosevelt six top-ranking assistants and about a dozen other aides. 
</P>
<P>
Back then, in the words of Samuel Kernell, a UC San Diego political scientist 
who specializes in the staffing of the presidency, the White House staff was 
seen as "insignificant go-fers," described by the wheelchair-bound Roosevelt as 
"my legs." 
</P>
<P>
Now the White House staff numbers more than 300, with about 15 top-ranking 
presidential assistants. "They have enormous power," Kernell said. "The 
President needs them to make decisions for him. Otherwise, he gets 
overwhelmed." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, according to a senior adviser, made it clear that he wanted a Cabinet 
stronger than his White House aides. He did not want the White House staff to 
dictate policy to the departments. 
</P>
<P>
"There are not a lot of heavy hitters over there" at the White House, this 
adviser said when the President took office. "That's the way Bush wants it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sununu Says He's Satisfied 
</P>
<P>
Sununu expresses nothing but satisfaction with the team assembled beneath him. 
</P>
<P>
"I think things are going well," he said in an interview in his White House 
office, just a few paces from the Oval Office. "I'm very happy with the staff. 
They have brought the talent and the commitment and the energy I have 
expected." 
</P>
<P>
Others in the West Wing speak the same sentiments but with less assurance. "I 
actually think it's going OK," said one senior Bush aide. He added, almost 
apologetically: "I may be in a minority on that." 
</P>
<P>
Sununu, the former New Hampshire governor who managed Bush's presidential 
campaign during last year's crucial primary there, has a reputation as a 
short-tempered autocrat. According to the well-placed Republican source, Sununu 
is still learning that while "the governor is king" in New Hampshire, "here you 
have the total opposite, especially in the fishbowl of the White House." 
</P>
<P>
Sununu has become, in Kernell's words, "an easy target." But he has quickly 
earned the loyalty of his staff and is given credit for using a puckish sense 
of humor to "keep people from taking themselves too seriously," said one senior 
aide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Considered Smart Politician 
</P>
<P>
Even his critics agree that he is a smart politician who is likely, one said, 
to "get his act together eventually." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of how effective it has been, the White House staff clearly reflects 
Bush's activist presidential style, said Thomas C. Griscom, a director of 
communications in the Reagan White House who now teaches at the University of 
Tennessee at Chattanooga. 
</P>
<P>
"The White House staff isn't going to be the dominant player" that it was 
during Reagan's eight-year tenure, Griscom said. "It will be a supporting 
player. That works as long as there are no snafus." 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to give the President and the President's team a chance to 
function," he said. "The team right now is like a brand new car. You're still 
kicking the tires. The tests are yet to happen."

LONGHORN BORER BEETLE FOUND IN THE BAY AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The dreaded longhorn borer beetle that has ravaged eucalyptus trees throughout 
Southern California has been found in the Bay Area, the first discovery north 
of Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Originally from Australia, the inch-long pest has no natural enemies here and 
has killed thousands of eucalyptus trees since it was first detected in this 
country five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Forestry officials had hoped to contain its spread by cutting down infested 
trees and regulating the transportation of eucalyptus firewood. But since last 
month, officials have captured some of the insect's larva in three trees in 
Alameda County. 
</P>
<P>
Entomologists are uncertain how well the black-colored insect, which has long 
antennas and zigzag markings on its tough outer shell, will adapt to the cooler 
Bay Area climate. Some experts say it could kill thousands of trees in what was 
once the world's last concentration of eucalyptus groves free of borer 
infestation. 
</P>
<P>
"It has a potential of killing a third of all trees" in the Bay Area, said Jim 
Laughlin, a state forester in San Bernardino County, where the beetle killed 
hundred of trees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wait-and-See Attitude 
</P>
<P>
Bay Area officials say they are taking a wait-and-see attitude about the 
significance of the new pest. 
</P>
<P>
"The environment up here is more favorable to the eucalyptus than in Southern 
California. So the extent of damage shouldn't be as severe. The truth remains 
to be seen," said John Nicoles, a land management specialist for the East Bay 
Regional Park District, where eucalyptus groves cover more than 1,500 acres of 
parkland. 
</P>
<P>
The true impact of the pest will be felt by homeowners who will have to pay up 
to $10,000 for removing eucalyptus trees killed by the beetle from their yards, 
Nicoles said. 
</P>
<P>
Forestry officials fear trees killed by the beetle will become fire and safety 
hazards. 
</P>
<P>
"Very, very hot fires develop from eucalyptus" and are harder to extinguish, 
said David Neff, a state forestry official. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Imported From Australia 
</P>
<P>
Eucalyptus trees were imported from Australia at the turn of the century. The 
trees grew well in California's semi-arid climate. The trees are not grown 
commercially. 
</P>
<P>
The borer typically attacks trees that are older, unhealthy or under 
environmental stress, such as drought and frost damage, said Tim Paine, an 
entomology professor at UC Riverside. Healthy trees can thwart the beetle by 
drowning its larva with sap. 
</P>
<P>
The beetle attacks the trees by laying its eggs beneath their bark. The hatched 
larva bore deeply into the tree, drilling deep holes that eventually kill the 
tree. 
</P>
<P>
Paine said the beetle was probably shipped from Chile to California in wooden 
crates infested with beetle larva. Though the borer beetle can fly, he said it 
most likely made its way to the Bay Area by hitching a ride in a stack of 
firewood. 
</P>
<P>
Pesticides are ineffective against the pest, because the larva are so deeply 
embedded in the tree, Paine said. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers at UC Riverside are experimenting with introducing some of the 
beetle's predators from Australia to keep the beetle population in check. 
Researchers have unleashed the Australian beetle-killing wasp, which preys 
specifically on the longhorn borer's larva. But so far, the wasp has adapted 
poorly to its new environment. "It's simply one of those things you have got to 
shrug your shoulders about. We're going to have to live with it," Nicoles said.

DEATH HOUSE LANDLADY GOT DRUGS FROM DOCTOR, PROSECUTORS CONTEND

<TEXT>
<P>
State prosecutors contend in a series of new court documents that Dorothea 
Puente induced her psychotherapist to prescribe tranquilizers so she could use 
them to "stupefy and kill" seven of the elderly tenants of her boarding house. 
</P>
<P>
The documents said the drug Dalmane, which was found in each of the seven 
bodies exhumed in the yard of the F Street boardinghouse, was prescribed to 
Puente by Dr. Thomas Doody, a Sacramento psychotherapist, and later another 
physician in an aggregate amount that was "more than she needed for herself." 
</P>
<P>
Affidavits said Doody also prescribed the drug for Alvaro (Bert) Montoya, the 
only one of the seven tenants Puente has formally been accused of murdering. A 
source close to the prosecution said one month before Montoya disappeared 
Puente sent Montoya to Doody with a note asking that he prescribe Dalmane "for 
sleeping." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special Hazards 
</P>
<P>
Dalmane is especially dangerous when used in combination with alcohol and poses 
special hazards for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
The new evidence that sketches out the prosecution's case against Puente 
appears in a memorandum filed by Deputy Dist. Atty. Timothy M. Frawley to 
support his request for a warrant to search Doody's records. 
</P>
<P>
In the documents, prosecutors say that Doody is not a suspect in the murders 
but they fault him for prescribing tranquilizers to Puente who had a history of 
"drugging and stealing from elderly victims." 
</P>
<P>
"We make the argument that he should have realized Puente was a danger," 
Frawley said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Frawley said Doody became Puente's psychotherapist in 1978 when she was accused 
of forging 30 Social Security checks belonging to the residents of her 
boardinghouse. She was eventually convicted of one count of forgery and ordered 
as a condition of probation to participate in a mental health program. To meet 
that condition, she began seeing Doody, the documents said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Convicted of 4 Felonies 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Puente was convicted of four more felonies that involved the drugging 
of elderly victims. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very familiar with the circumstances and her history and the type of 
people she victimized and that these were people who had been drugged . . . but 
I don't think that he knowingly did anything to aid and abet a murder," Frawley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In an affidavit attached to the search warrant, Steven M. Lack, a special agent 
for the inspector general of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 
quoted a former tenant of the F Street boardinghouse as telling him that Puente 
used to claim that she dated Doody and boast that "she could call him up 
anytime and obtain any drug she wished." 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit said the tenant, Brenda Trujillo, an ex-convict who had once 
shared a cell with Puente at the California Women's Institution in Frontera, 
observed Puente telephoning Doody and overheard her "ask him for . . . 
Dalmane." 
</P>
<P>
However, Michael Sands, Doody's lawyer, said that Doody's relationship with 
Puente was purely professional. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bragged About Friends 
</P>
<P>
"You have to consider the source of the information . . . an ex-convict 
narcotic abuser," he said. As to the claim that she dated Doody, Sands said, 
"Puente has been known to brag about all sorts of contacts she's had with 
well-known and famous people." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, documents filed by prosecutors say: "It may fairly be inferred 
that Dr. Doody knew the risk Puente posed to elderly and infirm persons over 
whom she had influence. Under these circumstances, Dr. Doody had a duty to 
disclose to the appropriate authority Puente's request for drugs with which she 
could stupefy and kill her victims." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the discovery of the bodies, friends of Puente remembered her 
bragging that she had been the fiancee of the Shah of Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Frawley said he believes that Trujillo's recollection of Puente's statements 
was accurate but he agreed with Sands' characterization of Puente. "I don't 
think that she had a non-professional relationship with Dr. Doody. I see no 
evidence that would support such a claim. She was just bragging," Frawley said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fraud Investigation 
</P>
<P>
Lack had been investigating Puente to determine if she had committed fraud 
against Medi-Cal in obtaining the Dalmane. Medi-Cal, the program that finances 
medical care for the poor, paid for the drugs provided to Montoya and Puente, 
the documents said. 
</P>
<P>
Puente's lawyers have attempted to block the seizure of Doody's records on the 
grounds that Puente's and Montoya's medical histories are confidential. 
</P>
<P>
In a hearing this week, Sacramento Superior Court Judge Ronald W. Tichterman 
ruled that Montoya's records could be disclosed because the doctor-patient 
privilege does not apply to the dead. He scheduled another hearing April 6 to 
determine if Puente's records can be disclosed.

POST-CENSUS REDISTRICTING MEANS BITTER STRUGGLE FOR HOUSE SEATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By CLAUDIA LUTHER, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reapportionment, another word for political trouble, will follow closely on the 
heels of the 1990 census. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where the rubber hits the road," one Democratic office-holder said of 
redistricting, "and the pavement is hot." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, how legislative and congressional district lines are redrawn to 
equalize population will shape state and federal legislation into the 21st 
Century, affecting issues ranging from Social Security benefits to highway 
construction, air pollution and national security. 
</P>
<P>
Because population in the United States keeps shifting from the Frost Belt to 
the Sun Belt, California is once again expected to be a big winner in the 1991 
reapportionment sweepstakes with a gain of five or six congressional seats. 
That will give California, already the biggest delegation in the nation, 50 or 
51 seats -- more than 11% of the 435-member House. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bitter, Rancorous 
</P>
<P>
Where those new seats will end up is anybody's guess at this point, but 
Republican and Democratic leaders are already positioning themselves for the 
redistricting battle, a typically bitter and rancorous affair that occurs every 
10 years, after each census. 
</P>
<P>
If population growth alone were the basis for drawing the new district lines, 
Los Angeles County would get an additional one-third of a congressional seat. 
The surrounding counties of Riverside, Imperial, San Diego and Orange would net 
slightly more than two seats. The rest of the seats would be spread throughout 
the state in growth areas such as the Central San Joaquin Valley, the Bay Area 
and the mountain counties in the north that have experienced phenomenal growth. 
</P>
<P>
Within Los Angeles County, the growth has been fastest in the northern areas of 
Newhall and Saugus and in certain minority areas, such as East Los Angeles. It 
has been slowest in the inner city, the Westside and other Anglo neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Even Distribution 
</P>
<P>
But, as a Democratic redistricting expert put it, "there's nothing about any 
population trend that dictates the lines." 
</P>
<P>
The law requires that population be evenly distributed among the districts. How 
the district lines are drawn to accomplish that distribution is left to the 
state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
That, of course, means that districts are drawn to benefit the party that 
controls the Legislature, and the only immediate deterrent to a blatant 
"gerrymander" is the prospect of a gubernatorial veto. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, when the last redistricting was done, Democrats not only controlled 
the Legislature but the governorship as well. And when Republicans turned to 
the state Supreme Court to overturn the redistricting signed into law by 
Democratic Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., they faced a court dominated by Brown's 
appointments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Basis for Attack 
</P>
<P>
The high court upheld the plan, which withstood a continued Republican assault 
all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which decided that the GOP had no legal 
basis to attack it. 
</P>
<P>
The 1981 plan was primarily the work of the late Rep. Phillip Burton (D-San 
Francisco), whose now-famous assurance to both Democrats and Republicans 
anxiously awaiting the final plan was, "You're in your mother's arms." The plan 
not only protected all Democratic incumbents but also most GOP incumbents -- at 
the expense of a handful of Republicans whose districts were "collapsed." 
</P>
<P>
Under the Burton plan, Democrats have maintained majorities in both the 
Legislature and an even tighter lock on the state's delegation to the House of 
Representatives. In Congress, for example, only one seat in the state has 
changed parties in 180 races over the last decade. That was the 38th District 
in Orange County, where Republican Robert K. Dornan in 1984 unseated 10-year 
incumbent Jerry M. Patterson, a moderate Democrat. Democrats now hold a 27-18 
edge over Republicans in the delegation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Defies Political Behavior' 
</P>
<P>
In the Legislature, Democrats hold a 47-33 majority in the Assembly and a 24-15 
majority in the Senate, where there is one independent. 
</P>
<P>
"In political terms, that's the most effective gerrymander in the history of 
the United States," GOP reapportionment expert Tony Quinn said. Articulating a 
familiar theme among Republicans who believe that California is becoming more 
conservative, Quinn added, "The congressional delegation in particular defies 
the political behavior of the state." 
</P>
<P>
Quinn said the Burton plan managed to "literally cement everybody in place. Not 
only are there no shifts, there are virtually no competitive races." 
</P>
<P>
For the 1991 redistricting, state Republican leaders are now pinning their 
hopes on two strategies. 
</P>
<P>
First, the GOP is considering several initiatives now being crafted for the 
1990 ballot that would force Democrats to draw more compact districts that do 
not cross city or county lines more than a set number of times. Several "good 
government" groups, such as the League of Women Voters and Common Cause, 
support such reforms. Democrats say such restrictions would give Republicans an 
edge but would not necessarily prevent gerrymandering. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hold Governorship 
</P>
<P>
The second Republican strategy is to hold on to the governorship in 1990. After 
Republican Gov. George Deukmejian decided not to seek a third term, the GOP put 
heavy pressure on U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson to run. Wilson has announced that he 
almost certainly will do so and has formed an exploratory committee. 
</P>
<P>
One of Wilson's first moves as a quasi-gubernatorial candidate was to call for 
support of GOP-backed reapportionment initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
If elected, Wilson could veto any Democratic plan he did not like. It would 
require a two-thirds vote of the Legislature to override a veto, and since 
Democrats do not hold a two-thirds majority in either house, the GOP would be 
in a very strong bargaining position. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is a Republican governor, then I think the Legislature is out of it," 
said James Tucker, chief legal counsel to the Assembly Elections and 
Reapportionment Committee during the 1981 redistricting. "I don't think they 
can come up with a plan that gets two-thirds of both houses." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ways to Implement Plan 
</P>
<P>
Quinn said, however, that there are ways the Democrats may be able to put their 
plan into effect, if only for the 1992 elections, even if the governor were to 
veto it. In the past, the state Supreme Court has authorized interim use of the 
new districts proposed by the Legislature when the justices are persuaded that 
using the old ones would violate constitutional guarantees of equal 
representation. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who believes that the election of a Republican governor can save us 
from being run through again in 1991 is simply wrong," Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Democrats are anxious to capture the governorship next year. 
</P>
<P>
"The game is this: If we win the governorship, we can pretty well draw the 
lines without doing much consulting" with Republicans, said House Majority Whip 
Tony Coelho (D-Merced), who will take an active role in California's 
redistricting. 
</P>
<P>
Coelho said that if Democrats control redistricting there probably will be a 
3-2 split favoring Democrats in the estimated five new congressional seats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'An Impact' 
</P>
<P>
"Nationally, it would have an impact in that we win a lot of our votes, close 
ones, with a less than 10-vote margin," Coelho said. There are now 259 
Democrats in the House and 174 Republicans, with two vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
For Republicans, Quinn said, a "fair" redistricting would give the GOP three of 
the five new House seats and Democrats one. The remaining district would be a 
tossup. 
</P>
<P>
However, Quinn said, the Democrats could take the same population figures and 
voting data and come up with four seats for themselves and one for the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
"If we play by the current rules again, we will lose again," Quinn predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Coelho, Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) and Rep. Vic Fazio 
(D-Sacramento) will be among those who will try to fill Burton's shoes in the 
Democrats' redistricting of congressional seats. Berman's brother, 
behind-the-scenes political strategist Michael Berman, also is expected to have 
a hand in drawing the new congressional lines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Sophisticated Information 
</P>
<P>
This time around in redistricting, Republicans and Democrats alike will be 
armed with computers, as they were 10 years ago. But the information available 
to program into the computers will be much more sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in any national population count, the federal Census Bureau 
will make available to each state within a few weeks sets of three-color, 
block-by-block maps. In all, the bureau has divided the nation into 9 million 
blocks, more than three times what was mapped in 1980, according to Marshall L. 
Turner Jr., chief of the Census Bureau's Redistricting Data Office. 
</P>
<P>
States that match precincts with blocks will be able to cross-index population 
information with voting patterns in much greater detail than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Hofeller, director of computer services at the Republican National 
Committee, recently told a conference on reapportionment at Claremont-McKenna 
College that the new technology is going to make even the bloody 1981 
redistricting in California "look like amateur night."

BERMAN SEES TROUBLE FOR DEMOCRATS IN WILSON'S BID FOR GOVERNOR IN '90 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEITH LOVE, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) said Friday that he is concerned that 
the Democrats might not be able to win back the California governorship in 1990 
even though he once thought the prospects were good. 
</P>
<P>
Berman, one of his party's better political strategists, told reporters at a 
breakfast meeting in Los Angeles: "We were in wonderful shape if we had to go 
up against (Republican Gov. George) Deukmejian or against one of their 
second-tier candidates. But the combination of Proposition 73, which rewrote 
campaign contribution laws, and U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson's gubernatorial candidacy 
is going to make it very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, just reelected to a second term in the Senate, announced last month 
that he will run for governor in 1990. In the minds of some, Wilson not only 
has a more attractive record than Deukmejian on so-called quality-of-life 
issues -- making him a tougher opponent for Democrats -- he has been assured by 
Republican fund-raisers that he will have all the money he needs to run for 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees Another Problem 
</P>
<P>
And that speaks to the other problem Berman sees: The new state campaign law, 
passed by the voters last year as Proposition 73. 
</P>
<P>
The new law limits contributions to $1,000 per individual donor per fiscal 
year. Previously, there was no limit on what an individual could give to a 
candidate for state office. 
</P>
<P>
Berman and others believe that the old rules favored Democrats, who for years 
have had a number of wealthy backers who could write big checks to augment the 
small sums collected from the party's working-class base. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, organized labor gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to some 
candidates in lump sums. Now, labor groups are limited to $1,000 and $5,000 
contributions, depending on the nature of the organizations, making it more 
difficult to round up the aggregate amounts labor once donated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Favors Republicans 
</P>
<P>
The new rules, Berman argued Friday, favor the Republicans because, 
historically, they have had a large group of upper-middle-class donors and 
business people who can write $1,000 checks. 
</P>
<P>
The first big campaign dinner for Wilson, for example, is scheduled for late 
May and is expected to pull in $1 million at $1,000 per plate. The first dinner 
for Democratic Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, who is running for governor, 
pulled in less than $500,000 earlier this week in donations of $500 a plate. 
</P>
<P>
Berman said he saw the Democrats' problems in winning the governorship as 
similar to their problems in recapturing the White House: "We have to find 
candidates who have not taken some of the positions I have taken." 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to his liberal record on the death penalty and gun control, 
both issues that hurt Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, the Democrats' 
1988 presidential nominee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Move to the Middle 
</P>
<P>
Although he is from the party's liberal side, Berman has become concerned 
enough about the Democrats' electoral prospects to join the Democratic 
Leadership Council, a more conservative group of Southerners and others who are 
trying to move the party more toward the middle. 
</P>
<P>
On another matter, Berman said that while "I would lead the charge" to keep 
abortion as a matter of individual choice, he had been impressed with the 
dedication of "the committed minority" of anti-abortion activists, some of whom 
have been trying to shut down clinics in Southern California this week. 
</P>
<P>
Berman said that if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns the Roe vs. Wade decision 
that legalized abortion in 1973, "you will not see Congress legislating on that 
because too many of my colleagues are fearful of the consequences."

ALOMAR JR. AND ABNER TOP LIST OF PADRES' CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
YUMA, Ariz. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In one corner of the clubhouse, Sandy Alomar Jr. was quietly sobbing. In 
another, Shawn Abner was clenching his fists, again and again. At a nearby 
table, his eyes covered with sunglasses, Joey Cora spoke slowly. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes some of us wonder, just what does it take?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
Padres who thought they knew discovered Friday they didn't. In roster cuts that 
were in some cases as stunning as they were sweeping, five top Padre prospects 
were sent to the minor leagues. Included were outfielder Abner, who was 
considered a lock for the fifth outfield spot, and catcher Alomar Jr., who many 
thought would be traded by now. 
</P>
<P>
"For some of us, I guess, that door is too big to knock down," Alomar, 22, said 
softly. 
</P>
<P>
The demotion of Alomar, the heralded prospect who is not good enough to 
supplant Benito Santiago but too good to rust on the bench as a backup, proved 
that the baseball world still is unwilling to give Padre Manager Jack McKeon 
the kind of value he requires in a trade. It also proved McKeon is willing to 
wait for that value, even if it means upsetting a kid one publication called 
its minor league player of the year last season. Alomar now will return to 
triple-A Las Vegas feeling he has nothing left to prove. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody expect me to be sent down -- except me," Alomar Jr. said after 
spending 15 minutes softly crying in front of his locker, much like his brother 
Roberto did last year after his brief demotion at the end of camp. "The 
difference between me and Roberto is, he have a chance up here, I have no 
chance. I thought I be in the big leagues somewhere, but no. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't make the trades. That's not my job. But I guess they are asking too 
much for me. Going back to triple-A, it depresses me. What more can I do?" 
</P>
<P>
The demotion of Abner, who hit in eight of the past nine spring games at a .320 
pace, proved that McKeon remains steadfast in his feeling that the big-league 
bench is no place for young talent to grow up. 
</P>
<P>
"When they told me Jack wanted to see me today, I thought he was telling me I 
made the team," Abner said. "Then he drops the rock on me. I asked him, why? He 
told me it was a case of numbers. I just don't understand it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Among Friday's survivors were infielder/outfielder Bip Roberts, infielder Gary 
Green and first baseman Rob Nelson. Although all three were long shots to make 
the team when camp began -- Green wasn't even on the major league roster -- it 
appears that two will start the season with the Padres while the odd man out 
will be left in Las Vegas when the big league team visits its triple-A team 
there next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts and Green, who each can play a couple of positions while Nelson can 
play only first, are heavy favorites to stick. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to decide if the Roberts and Green type of player is more valuable 
than the guy who can come off the bench only occasionally," McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
But after Friday, who knows what might happen next? 
</P>
<P>
Groused Abner: "This is a crazy, crazy game." 
</P>
<P>
Replied McKeon: "Hey, life is full of surprises." 
</P>
<P>
Shaking down this latest surprise: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cut Friday were young outfielders Abner, Jerald Clark and Randell Byers, 
infielder Cora, and catcher Alomar Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 -- There are 29 players left on a roster that must be trimmed to 24 by April 
3. But that number is deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
Two of those remaining -- pitcher Eric Nolte (ulcer) and outfielder Shane Mack 
(sore elbow) -- likely will start the season on the disabled list before being 
sent to triple-A when they are healthy. 
</P>
<P>
Another, minor league catcher Mike Basso, is just hanging around to make sure 
all the pitchers can get their late spring work. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, pitcher Pat Clements is still around because the Angels are interested 
in re-acquiring him, and he will be showcased in Palm Springs during the 
Padres' four upcoming games there. Clements began his pro career in 1983 with 
the Angels, pitching for them for the first four months of 1985. 
</P>
<P>
This leaves 25 players for 24 spots. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Padres will carry 10 pitchers, two catchers, four true outfielders and 
eight infielder/outfielder/utility men. The unusual arrangement is a result of 
McKeon's love for versatility. His dream team would be Tony Gwynn and 13 other 
guys who can play anywhere and everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
The starting pitchers, in order, will be Eric Show, Bruce Hurst, Ed Whitson, 
Dennis Rasmussen and Walt Terrell. 
</P>
<P>
The relievers will be led by left-handed stopper Mark Davis and right-handed 
stopper Mark Grant, who likely won the role Friday with two scoreless innings, 
including four strikeouts, in a 2-1 victory over Oakland. It will be filled out 
by left-handed setup man Dave Leiper and right-handed setup men Greg Booker and 
Greg Harris, who is the team's emergency starter. 
</P>
<P>
The catchers will be starter Benito Santiago and backup Mark Parent. 
</P>
<P>
The outfielders will be John Kruk, Tony Gwynn, Carmelo Martinez and backup 
Marvell Wynne. 
</P>
<P>
The starting infielders will be Jack Clark, Roberto Alomar, Garry Templeton and 
Randy Ready/Tim Flannery. The only sure utility infielder will be Luis Salazar, 
acquired from Detroit in Thursday's trade that sent shortstop Mike Brumley to 
the Tigers. Salazar also can play the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, Green and Nelson will fight over the other two utility spots. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The catalyst for Friday's cuts can be described in two words, and they 
aren't spring statistics -- "I don't even know what some of these guys' 
statistics are," McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
Those words are Luis Salazar. Because he played 68 of his 130 games with 
Detroit last year in the outfield -- committing just one error in 132 chances 
-- he knocked Abner directly out of the picture. Because he can play all three 
infield positions well, he knocked Cora out of the picture. 
</P>
<P>
The reason his presence didn't affect Green was that, in spite of Green's .105 
spring average, the Padres need a true shortstop backup for Templeton, who 
played just 105 games there last year. 
</P>
<P>
The reason his presence didn't affect Roberts was that, even though Roberts 
plays the same positions as Salazar, the Padre bosses are figuring he might be 
needed if Salazar sneaks the starting third base job away from Ready. 
</P>
<P>
If Roberts makes it, it will be the second time he has started with the big 
league team -- he was in the majors the entire 1986 season. If Green makes it, 
it will be his first big-league opening day. He has just 13 games of big league 
experience, accrued at the end of the 1986 season, and thus will join Greg 
Harris as one of only two rookies on the club. 
</P>
<P>
It's actually surprising that there are that many. Blame it on the law of 
physics as it affects a team like the Padres. On a potential pennant contender, 
all youth movements point directly to the back door. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody who was sent down today understood," McKeon said late Friday 
afternoon. "I sure didn't want any of these guys sitting on the bench. It's all 
timing, and they just had bad timing. A couple of years ago, their timing would 
have been good. Not now." 
</P>
<P>
Particularly not for Alomar, who showed powerful skills this spring with a good 
arm behind the plate and three doubles, a homer and seven RBI despite a .192 
average. 
</P>
<P>
Said McKeon, "Hey, he can use more minor league experience." 
</P>
<P>
What McKeon was really saying was, hey, going to minor leagues won't hurt his 
trade value. 
</P>
<P>
"Who are two of the top prospects around -- Alomar and that New York Mets 
pitcher, David West, right?" McKeon asked. "You see where West got sent out a 
couple of days ago? You think they're worried about trading him from triple-A? 
It's no problem. It's still early. A lot of things could happen." 
</P>
<P>
Said Alomar: "All I know is, when I came here I didn't know what happened, and 
now I know less."

Jimmy Connors won his third match in four days Friday night, beating Austria's 
Horst Skoff in straight sets to advance to the fourth round of the 
International Players Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Connors' 6-2, 7-6, 6-1 victory highlighted the fifth day of the two-week 
tournament and followed a rainstorm that delayed the start of the match more 
than an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Others winning at night despite interruptions or delays due to the rain 
included 11th-seeded Emilio Sanchez of Spain, No. 13 Kevin Curren and No. 15 
Andres Gomez of Ecuador. Pam Shriver and Zina Garrison, seeded fourth and 
fifth, respectively, in the women's draw, also won. 
</P>
<P>
During the day session at the International Tennis Center, 10th-seeded Aaron 
Krickstein avoided an upset, and top-seeded Ivan Lendl won his third-round 
match in straight sets. 
</P>
<P>
Krickstein outlasted Alexander Mronz, ranked 290th in the world, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2, 
6-7, 7-6. The match took 3 hours 41 minutes, not including three brief rain 
delays. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard because I'm usually a slow starter, and we had to stop three or 
four times," Krickstein said. "So each time it was like a new beginning." 
</P>
<P>
Lendl moved into the fourth round with a 7-5, 6-0, 6-4 victory over Paolo Cane 
of Italy. The two played five sets the last time they met before Lendl won, but 
this time he had more trouble with the humid weather than with Cane. 
</P>
<P>
"The climate was taking its toll," Lendl said. "I just feel like sleeping all 
day today." 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez defeated Sweden's Christian Bergstrom, 4-6, 7-5, 6-3, 6-3; Curren beat 
Scott Davis, 6-3, 3-6, 4-6, 7-6, 6-4, and Gomez outlasted Jonathan Canter, 7-6, 
7-6, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Shriver defeated Amanda Coetzer of South Africa, 7-5, 6-2, and Garrison downed 
Laura Gildemeister of Peru, 6-2, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, second-seeded Chris Evert ousted Nathalie Tauziat of France, 6-3, 6-3, 
and ninth-seeded Mary Joe Fernandez beat Beverly Bowes, 6-1, 6-3.

MORNING BRIEFING: YANKEE QUARTET MAY RUN OUT OF COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pittsburgh Pirates have more than a casual interest in how the New York 
Yankees fare this season because their former general manager, Syd Thrift, is 
now working for owner George Steinbrenner and must also deal with strong-willed 
Manager Dallas Green and several other former general managers in the Yankee 
front office. 
</P>
<P>
The Pittsburgh Press ran a ballot this week asking whether the 
Steinbrenner-Thrift-Green-Bob Quinn team will last the entire season without 
one of them, excluding Steinbrenner, being fired. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a good chance he won't be in New York as long as he was in 
Pittsburgh," said outfielder Andy Van Slyke of the always visible Thrift. 
</P>
<P>
"If Syd's job was like a basketball court, he would have always been out of 
bounds. If he realized he was stepping out of bounds, he'd probably still be 
there, but he thought the whole arena was his, not just the court." 
</P>
<P>
Add Thrift: According to Steve Jacobsen of Newsday, during the last two months 
of last season, Thrift would sit in the office of Pirate Manager Jim Leyland, 
whom Thrift had hired, and answer pregame and postgame questions directed at 
the manager. At one point, Leyland got up and walked out. 
</P>
<P>
Thrift also phoned Leyland in the dugout to second-guess his moves. 
</P>
<P>
One can guess what Dallas Green's reaction would be to that. 
</P>
<P>
Add Green: The Yankees' new manager has to keep his sense of humor these days 
because he faces starting the season without Dave Winfield, Ron Guidry and 
Rafael Santana -- all sidelined with injuries -- and John Candelaria is trying 
to pitch while nursing a sore knee. 
</P>
<P>
After taking a three-hour ride from Ft. Lauderdale to Port St. Lucie to play 
the Mets in Florida this week, Green wouldn't let his team off the bus until 
each player had passed inspection. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to make sure they hadn't got hurt on the bus," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Knight life: Indiana Coach Bob Knight, when asked at a news conference if he 
had mellowed: "Do you remember when you were a little kid growing up and you 
believed in Santa Claus? There is not much difference between Santa Claus and 
me today -- two overweight, lovable guys every kid would enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
Lasting impression: Baltimore Orioles outfielder Phil Bradley and first baseman 
Jim Traber were opposing quarterbacks when Missouri defeated Oklahoma State, 
30-7, in a Big Eight Conference game in 1980, but Bradley insists he doesn't 
remember Traber. 
</P>
<P>
"The only guy I remember is Dexter Manley." Bradley told the Sporting News. 
Manley, the Washington Redskins' All-Pro defensive end, was a senior at 
Oklahoma State that year. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Yogi Berra gave his old pal Whitey Ford this scouting report on the 
New York Mets' spring training complex and the city of Port St. Lucie, Fla.: 
"They've got six fields and two bars."

<TEXT>
<P>
Tim Simpson shot a bogey-free, five-under-par 67 Friday to move into a tie with 
first-round leader Dan Forsman at 135 after two rounds of the $750,000 
USF&amp;G tournament at New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson missed a three-foot birdie putt on his final hole that would have given 
him sole possession of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Forsman shot a 69. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Norman was at 136 after consecutive rounds of 68. Brian Tennyson, who shot 
a 65, was at 137, and Tony Grimes, Pat McGowan and Tom Byrum were another shot 
back. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Kite, bidding for a third straight tournament victory, shot a 69 and was 
tied at 139 with Hal Sutton, Mark O'Meara, Payne Stewart and Bill Sander. 
</P>
<P>
Allison Finney, seeking the first victory of her seven-year LPGA career, shot a 
four-under-par 69 for a 135 total and a three-shot lead over Beth Daniel after 
two rounds of the $400,000 Turquoise tournament at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel used an an eagle and three birdies on the back nine for a 70 and a 138 
total. Next was Patti Rizzo with a 68 and a 139 total. 
</P>

Pete Rose's debts totaled nearly $500,000 when he left the Cincinnati Reds as a 
player in 1978, and the team's former general manager said Rose's "legs may get 
broken" because of gambling, a newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
The Cincinnati Post said that Dick Wagner, the Reds' former executive vice 
president, discussed Rose's alleged gambling at several meetings. Wagner did 
not comment on the report, but the newspaper said its source was a former team 
official who had attended the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete Rose's legs may get broken when his playing days are over," Wagner was 
quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
The Dayton Daily News, quoting unidentified sources, also reported that the 
investigation of Rose had expanded into a multistate probe of sports betting 
linked to organized crime. It also said investigators were looking into 
allegations of substantial debts Rose may owe to bookmakers with alleged ties 
to organized crime.

NEWSWIRE: SAN JOSE STATE FIRES BERRY 2 MONTHS AFTER WALKOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Berry was fired Friday as basketball coach at San Jose State, two months 
after 10 players had quit the team, accusing him of "verbal abuse" and "mental 
cruelty." 
</P>
<P>
Athletic Director Randy Hoffman said that no replacement has been chosen and a 
national search has been launched. Hoffman said he wants the next coach "in 
order of priorities, to recruit, retain and graduate student-athletes." 
</P>
<P>
Berry, 47, had a 142-144 record in 10 seasons at San Jose. The Spartans, who 
qualified for the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. tournament in 1980 and 
played in the National Invitation Tournament in '81, were 5-23 this season, 
losing all 12 games after the Jan. 18 walkout. 
</P>
<P>
The players who walked out will not be allowed to return to the team, Hoffman 
said.

CS LONG BEACH AND TENNESSEE REFLECT COACHES 
</P>

<P>
To the extent that basketball teams may be said to reflect the personalities of 
their coaches, Joan Bonvicini of Cal State Long Beach and Pat Summitt of 
Tennessee have created teams in their own images. 
</P>
<P>
Bonvicini was raised on basketball as played on the city playgrounds of the 
East Coast. Her game is fast and furious. Style is important. 
</P>
<P>
Summitt was raised on basketball as played in barns and driveways of the deep 
South. Her game is measured and relentless. Execution is important. 
</P>
<P>
What happens when these very different teams coached by Bonvicini and Summitt 
play today in the final of the women's National Collegiate Athletic Assn. East 
Regional will determine which team advances to the Final Four, March 31-April 2 
at Tacoma, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
The game at E.A. Diddle Arena on the campus of Western Kentucky University will 
be televised live on ESPN, beginning at 9 a.m. PST. 
</P>
<P>
Seventh-ranked Long Beach (30-4) has a reputation as the flashiest up-tempo 
team in women's basketball. Tennessee (32-2) is No. 2 in the nation and is 
recognized as the foremost proponent of defensive pressure and patient offense. 
</P>
<P>
The teams played once this season, a game that Tennessee won with ease in 
Knoxville, 88-74. Circumstances for both teams have changed since then, but 
their styles have not. 
</P>
<P>
And this week, an odd coincidence occurred. With the resignation of Tennessee's 
men's coach, Don DeVoe, two state newspapers called for Summitt to be 
considered for the position. Bonvicini had a similar experience when the men's 
job opened at Long Beach a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Although the seriousness of the suggestions may be questioned, there is no 
question that both Bonvicini and Summitt have emerged as two of the brightest 
coaches in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Bonvicini grew up in a working-class Italian neighborhood of Bridgeport, 
Conn., as one of five children. Her father, Tom, was a good athlete and 
encouraged his children to participate in sports. 
</P>
<P>
When she was very young, Bonvicini played baseball and softball, eventually 
playing for the Raybestos Brakettes, a longtime national power in women's 
amateur softball. 
</P>
<P>
"I really loved basketball," Bonvicini said. "I went to 12 years of parochial 
school because the public schools were so rough, and also because only the 
Catholic schools had basketball teams. I'll never forget playing in those 
pleated skirts. I'll tell you, you have to be pretty good to play basketball in 
a skirt." 
</P>
<P>
At Southern Connecticut State College, Bonvicini was a flashy player who led 
her team to postseason play three times. 
</P>
<P>
The summer after her senior year, she was invited to play in a women's summer 
league in Los Angeles. Bonvicini took in a few weeks of the Southern California 
sun and returned to Connecticut -- to pack. 
</P>
<P>
She flew to L.A. -- her father wouldn't allow her to drive -- with $300 and a 
promise of a room to rent for $50 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Bonvicini eventually took a job as an assistant at Long Beach and decided to 
coach full-time. She quit a $20,000 job as a computer programmer to make $7,000 
a year as a coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't care about the money," she said. "I loved the job. My family was not 
too thrilled." 
</P>
<P>
Once she became head coach, Bonvicini instilled in her team her own passion for 
a run-and-gun style. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming from the city-style of basketball, that's what I like," she said. "I've 
always wanted my guards to be aggressive, to be jumping on people's backs. I 
want my team to be unpredictable. I like to be the aggressor. People say that 
as a coach, I'll go for the jugular. It's true. I want to put the other team in 
a hole." 
</P>
<P>
Fine talk from the past president of the Women's Basketball Coaches Assn. But 
for Bonvicini, who learned the lessons of competition on tough city 
playgrounds, it's what she knows. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Head Summitt grew up on a dairy farm 17 miles outside Henrietta, Tenn. 
Although she always played sports, the variety was limited to whatever fields 
and barns were available. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have the opportunity to play much of anything when I was growing 
up," she said. "We played basketball in the hayloft. It's not like there were 
tennis courts and things like that." 
</P>
<P>
She grew into a star basketball player for Cheatham County High School, the 
kind of player that people remembered. Especially country people. 
</P>
<P>
"Country people are really family oriented," she said. "It's not like the 
hustle-bustle city life, it's the slow-paced farm life. We are all together. 
Even if your next neighbor is three-four miles down the road, if you had to 
borrow a cup of sugar, you knew you could. I did that a few times." 
</P>
<P>
Summitt played basketball at the University of Tennessee Martin and was 
co-captain of the U.S. Olympic team that won a silver medal in 1976. She 
coached the 1984 Olympic team to a gold medal in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Summitt met her future husband at a party given by her roommate, a party 
intended to get Pat together with a certain bank examiner. During the party, 
R.B. Summitt, also a bank examiner but not the bank examiner, moved in and 
introduced himself. 
</P>
<P>
Pat had just returned from helping UCLA Coach Billie Moore with a training camp 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"You could say she kind of stood out," R.B. Summitt said. "Here we were in our 
suits and here's Pat in her shorts and her tan." 
</P>
<P>
That was April 18, 1977. They were later married and both their careers 
changed. Pat became head coach at Tennessee, where she is in her 15th season. 
R.B. stopped examining banks and began to own them. He is said to be one of the 
wealthiest men in Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
Summitt, 36, has recruited a team filled with hard-working country kids, 
similar to all her teams. Asked what traits of hers are also characteristic of 
her team, Summitt considered and then said, "Intensity, competitiveness . . . 
they don't like to lose." 
</P>
<P>
Sounds a lot like Long Beach.

ANKLE SPRAIN PUTS ANTHONY IN DOUBT FOR UNLV'S GAME

Greg Anthony, the point guard for Nevada Las Vegas, was termed "very doubtful" 
Friday for the Rebels' game against Seton Hall today in the West Regional final 
of the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony sprained his right ankle and slightly injured his left knee when he 
fell after blocking Ken Lofton's breakaway layup attempt in the final two 
minutes of the UNLV's victory over top-seeded and No. 1-ranked Arizona 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"Our trainer (Jerry Koloskie) said today that Greg is very doubtful and that he 
didn't think he would play," Rebel Coach Jerry Tarkanian said. "If Greg can't 
play, that's a real big loss for us, obviously. He's our best defender on the 
ball." 
</P>
<P>
Anthony, who averages 13 points and seven assists a game, had two points and 11 
assists against Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping he can play," Tarkanian said. "I just can't see how, when you get 
this far, you cannot play unless it's broken. But if he's limping, we'll take 
him out. You can't play our pressure defense and limp." 
</P>
<P>
If Anthony is unable to play or is limited by the injury, Tarkanian said that 
Clint Rossum and Stacey Cvijanovich would replace him at the point. ROBYN

UNLV'S SPEED TAKES ON SETON HALL'S STRENGTH

<P>
Jerry Tarkanian's "skinniest team in America" spent Thursday night beating 
Arizona, the team many regarded as the best in America. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Nevada Las Vegas -- with only one senior on its roster -- takes its thin 
front line against Seton Hall in the West Regional final today for a spot in 
the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. tournament's Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
If the Arizona game was a battle between the best in the West, this one shapes 
up as a struggle between the brawn of Seton Hall and the speed of UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall, true to the tradition of the Big East, averages 223 pounds across 
the front line, and Ramon Ramos, the 6-foot 9-inch center, tips the scales at 
250. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV's front line averages only 199 pounds, and none of the players is shorter 
than 6-7. 
</P>
<P>
One of UNLV's thin men is David Butler, a 6-10, 200-pound center who, rather 
than talk to recruiters when he was at San Jacinto Junior College in Texas, 
simply had "UNLV" cut into his hair. 
</P>
<P>
"Coaches would come in and want to talk to me," Butler said. "But once they saw 
UNLV on my head, they backed off." 
</P>
<P>
Butler believes Seton Hall's lack of speed could help UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
"Their inside guys are pretty good," he said. "But I don't feel they run the 
court real well. A couple of times, they weren't getting back." 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian, sitting nearby, sensed bulletin-board material, and cautioned 
Butler. 
</P>
<P>
"Better be careful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I am being careful," Butler said. "I watched the game closely." 
</P>
<P>
Besides Butler, UNLV's front line is made up of Moses Scurry, 6-7 and 205; 
Stacey Augmon, 6-7 and 192, and substitute George Ackles, 6-10 and 200. 
</P>
<P>
Scurry is the closest thing the Rebels have to a bruiser. But what he lacks in 
size, he makes up for in intimidation, opening his mouth wide for a ferocious 
shout with every rebound he pulls down. 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall, struggling to overcome an underdog label despite being the 
third-seeded team, counters with Ramos, Daryll Walker at 6-8 and 215, Andrew 
Gaze at 6-7 and 205, and substitute Frantz Volcy at 6-8 and 220. 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian concedes the weight difference, but that's about all. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they are a little stronger," he said. "I think we're quicker. I don't 
think they're tougher." 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall has an interior defense that drew the compliments of Indiana Coach 
Bob Knight after the Pirates eliminated the Hoosiers Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall Coach P.J. Carlesimo, like Tarkanian, is looking to the interior 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a little bigger and might be a tad quicker," he said. "We're more 
physical. Hopefully, our people will hold them inside." 
</P>
<P>
The improvement of UNLV's inside game has coincided with the Rebels' 
late-season run. 
</P>
<P>
After beginning the season with only three returning players -- guard Stacey 
Cvijanovich, Clint Rossum and Augmon -- the Rebels struggled a little early. 
</P>
<P>
"We were 15-6 at one time, and I was wondering if we'd win 20 games," Tarkanian 
said. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV lost only one more game the rest of the way, to Louisiana State, and has a 
29-7 record. 
</P>
<P>
Butler, in particular, has been important in the run, and is averaging 18 
points a game during the tournament, compared to 15 overall. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Seton Hall's 29-6 record, which includes three losses to Syracuse, 
there are those who are trying to pin the Cinderella label on Seton Hall, the 
second-place team in the Big East. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they'll start to understand once we get to Seattle," Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
Carlesimo said of his players: "They're good, and they know they're good." 
</P>
<P>
As for the Rebels, any doubts about themselves were dispelled in the 68-67 
victory over Arizona, narrow as it was. 
</P>
<P>
"Going into (Thursday night's) game, I thought Arizona was the best team in the 
country," Tarkanian said. "I thought they had a good shot at winning the whole 
thing. Seton Hall is a good team, but I don't think they're as good as Arizona 
was." 
</P>
<P>
West Regional Notes 
</P>
<P>
Sean Elliott finished his career at Arizona with 735 points this season and 
2,555 in all. . . . UNLV Coach Jerry Tarkanian picked Arizona, Oklahoma, North 
Carolina and Indiana to win in Thursday's semifinals. All four lost. . . . 
Tarkanian thought it so unlikely that the Rebels could beat Arizona that he 
told his wife, Lois, that if the teams played 10 times, UNLV would win once.

NCAA SOUTHEAST REGIONAL FINAL AT LEXINGTON, KY.; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER EARLY ADVERSITY, VIRGINIA REACHES TOP OF ITS GAME AT PERFECT TIME

<P>
Michigan isn't the only team in the Southeast Regional final that has overcome 
adversity this season. 
</P>
<P>
At one point in January, Virginia had lost five straight games and Coach Terry 
Holland was in the hospital, recuperating from surgery Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was really down and out," sophomore guard John Crotty said Friday at 
Rupp Arena, where the upstart Cavaliers, 22-10, will meet 10th-ranked Michigan, 
27-7, today at 11 a.m., PST. "We'd had a rough stretch of games and it just 
seemed to be getting worse." 
</P>
<P>
It finally got better, Crotty said, on Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Holland, released from the University of Virginia Medical Center after his 
operation to correct a bowel obstruction, stopped at University Hall for a 
visit with his players, whose losing streak was expected to reach six games 
that day against North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
"He looked like he'd been through a war," Crotty said of Holland, who broke 
down and cried as he spoke. "He was really haggard and his face was pale. But 
the look of determination on his face was very emotional." 
</P>
<P>
Inspired by Holland's grit, Crotty said, the Cavaliers sprang to life, 
demolishing North Carolina, 106-83. 
</P>
<P>
Holland, who missed six games, returned to the bench two weeks later and, in 
his second game back, the Cavaliers pounded North Carolina State, 91-71. 
</P>
<P>
"We really started believing in ourselves," Crotty said. "It was like, 'Holy 
cow! We're beating these people and we're beating them really good, too!' From 
then on, we just rode that momentum." 
</P>
<P>
They have ridden it to within a victory of the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
This is a team that was never ranked among the top 20, but has picked an 
opportune time to play its best basketball of the season. The Cavaliers have 
won 15 of 19 games, and in the tournament have made 54.9% of their shots, 
including 67.9% from three-point range, and 79.8% of their free throws. 
</P>
<P>
"They're kind of like us," said Michigan's interim coach, Steve Fisher, who has 
guided the Wolverines to three victories since the defection March 15 of former 
Coach Bill Frieder, who resigned after accepting a job at Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got a feeling like they're at the top of their game. Sometimes when 
you have that feeling, you play maybe even a little bit better than you (think 
you) can." 
</P>
<P>
In the semifinals Thursday night, Virginia showcased its strengths in an 86-80 
upset of top-seeded Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers are not a particularly good shooting team, despite their recent 
success, but they rebound well and defend relentlessly. They limited Stacey 
King, the Sooners' All-American center, to only two points in building a 42-37 
halftime lead. And they out-rebounded the Sooners, 38-26. 
</P>
<P>
Their top players are Crotty, a cagey and combative point guard; Richard 
Morgan, a 6-foot-3 gunner who leads the team in scoring and outrageous shots, 
and 6-5 freshman forward Bryant Stith, rookie of the year in the Atlantic Coast 
Conference and the Cavaliers' No. 2 scorer and rebounder. 
</P>
<P>
In three tournament games:

 -- Crotty has 32 assists and only seven turnovers, including eight assists and 
three turnovers against Oklahoma. Crotty also has averaged 21 points a game, 
about eight points more than his season average, while making a staggering 
71.9% of his shots. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Morgan has averaged 30 points, about 10 points more than his season 
average, and has made 12 of 19 three-point shots, including five of eight 
Thursday night, when he scored 25 points and threw in two bombs during a 9-0 
Cavalier run that wiped out a 72-69 Oklahoma lead. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stith has averaged almost 25 points, about nine points more than his season 
average, and has made 64% of his shots while missing only two of 29 free 
throws. He led the Cavaliers with 28 points against Oklahoma, making nine of 16 
shots and 10 of 11 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
"We're making believers out of a lot of people," Crotty said. "And we're 
starting to believe in ourselves, too." 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers, indeed, have exceeded most expectations, although their success 
isn't a complete surprise. They tied for second place in the ACC and were the 
fifth-seeded team in the Southeast Regional. 
</P>
<P>
But Terry Gates, an analyst for the Cavaliers' radio network and a former 
player who helped Holland and Virginia reach the Final Four in 1981, believed 
so strongly that Virginia's season would end against Oklahoma that he booked a 
flight Friday for a vacation in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not too good as a travel agent," Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
Nor, as it turns out, as a barometer of heart. 
</P>
<P>
"Adversity is a character builder and sometimes it can be a great advantage," 
Holland said. "What we've gone through tends to bring you closer together and 
makes you function more like a team at a quicker rate. 
</P>
<P>
"We have responded to that fusion process that is (brought about) by external 
pressure and really come together." 
</P>
<P>
And not a moment too soon. 
</P>
<P>
Southeast Regional Notes 
</P>
<P>
According to Michigan's interim coach, Steve Fisher, Athletic Director Bo 
Schembechler called Friday to say that he couldn't remember a Michigan team 
playing harder than the Wolverines had Thursday night in beating North 
Carolina, 92-87. No word from Schembechler, though, on whether Fisher would 
remain as coach after the season has ended. . . . Fisher, given a cake to 
commemorate his 44th birthday Friday at a press conference, asked two of his 
players, Rumeal Robinson and Sean Higgins, to help blow out the candles. 
Quipped Higgins, a reserve forward from Los Angeles: "You know how it is when 
you're 44. You lose your wind." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher on Virginia's Bryant Stith: "We thought (Indiana's) Eric Anderson was 
one of the premier freshmen in the country, but this young man would not take a 
back seat to anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Michigan, which leads the nation in field-goal percentage at .571, has made 50% 
of its three-point attempts in the tournament, including 16 of 28 by Glen Rice, 
who made eight of 12 against North Carolina. . . . Virginia Coach Terry 
Holland, assessing Michigan: "They shoot the ball so well from three-point 
range, but they also have power around the basket. It's a classic 
between-a-rock-and-a-hard-place: Do you defend the perimeter, or do you defend 
inside?"

EXPANSION AND REALIGNMENT ARE GETTING CLOSER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bob Oates 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three items that weren't on the agenda -- expansion, realignment and revenue 
sharing -- dominated much of the informal discussion this week at the National 
Football League's winter meetings in Palm Desert. 
</P>
<P>
The league needs 30 teams instead of the present 28, some club owners reasoned, 
and the teams should be regrouped into six geographically logical divisions. 
</P>
<P>
It won't happen this year, but both should be done in the early 1990s, Art 
Modell, president of the Cleveland Browns, said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've held off on expansion about as long as we can," Modell added, 
noting that numerous American cities -- including Baltimore, Oakland, Memphis, 
and Jacksonville -- have been waiting for many years. 
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, we should realign into divisions along purely geographical 
lines. Heading into the '90s, nothing else makes sense economically, or from 
any other standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Irsay, vice president and general manager of the Indianapolis Colts, sees 
it about the same way. 
</P>
<P>
"We ought to combine revenue sharing with (expansion and) realignment," said 
Irsay, who is one of many owners favoring an equal distribution of total gate 
receipts as well as television income. 
</P>
<P>
"The discrepancy (in gate revenue) between cities like Phoenix and Detroit 
isn't healthy for pro football. The NFL was built on a foundation of strong 
markets everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
None of this is possible without labor peace, retiring Commissioner Pete 
Rozelle said. But some of the owners are getting restless. They want to begin 
moving as soon as next year toward realignment and, if possible, expansion and 
revenue sharing. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders may be having their troubles on the field these days, but they're 
still serving the NFL as a training ground. 
</P>
<P>
All five of the league's West Coast teams were represented at Palm Desert this 
week by executives who came up under Raider owner Al Davis. 
</P>
<P>
The lineup: San Francisco -- Bill Walsh; Rams -- John Robinson; Seattle -- Tom 
Flores; San Diego -- Steve Ortmayer; Raiders -- Al LoCasale. 
</P>
<P>
Flores is a former Raider head coach. The others are former assistants. 
</P>
<P>
Although Seattle pushed the Raiders out of the playoffs in the final 
regular-season game of 1988, Davis thinks his team is on the way back. 
</P>
<P>
"We're close to being real good again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis surprised a lot of people when, in a surprising display of emotion, he 
hugged Rozelle and spoke of his respect for the commissioner after Rozelle had 
announced his retirement. It had been widely assumed, since they have been 
feuding for about 20 years, that they shared only a cordial dislike of one 
another. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL decision that provoked the most animosity this week was one reducing 
the training-camp player limit to 80. 
</P>
<P>
This ended a long era of unrestricted off-season recruiting in which some NFL 
coaches had found unsuspected quality by bringing in 150 or more candidates. 
</P>
<P>
On many issues at the winter meetings each year, the league splits into one 
group of clubs seeking the cheap way out and another that pitches for 
excellence. This was one such issue. 
</P>
<P>
And although teams that operate on the cheap are often outvoted, they usually 
gain winter-meeting leverage whenever one of their number makes the Super Bowl, 
as the Cincinnati Bengals did this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengal economy cartel won this time, continuing a big week in which it had 
also prevailed in two other other areas: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The coaches will be limited to a six-man taxi squad this year, and if they 
have to fill it with injured-reserve players, there will be no room for 
developmental players. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Instant replay officiating will have to continue this season without a new 
technological improvement that would have advised the upstairs officials 
precisely when a whistle sounded on the field. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the NFL is a major league in name only.

CALCZYNSKI TO OPEN DEFENSE OF NASCAR TOUR TITLE AT SAUGUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dodgers, the Lakers, the 49ers, Roman Calczynski -- all will be trying this 
year to repeat as champions. 
</P>
<P>
Most fans probably would admit that all are bucking the odds. Even Calczynski, 
a 37-year-old stock car driver from Sepulveda, acknowledges the difficulty of 
the task before him. 
</P>
<P>
"There are not too many repeat winners in anything," Calczynski said. 
</P>
<P>
Which makes Calczynski the driver to watch as the NASCAR All-American Challenge 
Series Southwest Tour kicks off its fourth season at 7 tonight with the Miller 
125 at Saugus Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
Calczynski, who is rapidly becoming the tour's Mike Tyson, Wayne Gretzky and 
Joe Montana -- all rolled into one and stuffed inside a stock car -- won the 
tour championship last season after two runner-up finishes. 
</P>
<P>
Calczynski posted three victories and 12 top-five finishes, setting tour 
single-season ($35,501) and career ($72,115) earnings records, on his way to 
the title. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, he is as humble as the 24 Hours of Le Mans is long. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really know what to say," Calczynski said, "except that the way the 
competition is, it's awful hard to win this thing." 
</P>
<P>
The tour, which will include a second race at Saugus on Sept. 9, consists of 20 
events on 12 tracks in California, Arizona and Nevada. It concludes Nov. 4 with 
the AC-Delco 300 at Phoenix International Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
Calczynski's toughest competitors also will be back on track. Troy Beebe of 
Modesto, who battled for the lead throughout the season before finishing 
second, tied Calczynski with a tour-high three victories last year. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Chase of Bakersfield, tour champion in 1987 and the tour's career leader 
with 10 wins, finished third and will be back, as will Ron Hornaday Jr. of 
Palmdale and Ken Pedersen of Sausalito, who finished third and fourth, 
respectively. Hornaday and Pedersen battled for rookie-of-the-year honors with 
Pedersen eventually claiming the award. 
</P>
<P>
Loran Kelley (sixth) of Vacaville and Ray Hooper Jr. of Palmdale (seventh) 
round out the top seven returnees. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of tough competition," Calczynski said. "Two second-place 
finishes and one first -- that speaks pretty highly of the crew I have. It's 
the same one we've had for three years. We should be pretty well intact." 
</P>
<P>
Calczynski is no stranger to Saugus, which is celebrating its 50th season. A 
regular at the one-third-mile oval from 1979-83, Calczynski posted 
championships in Street Stock, Sportsman and Modified divisions, the only 
three-division champion in track history. 
</P>
<P>
Calczynski has won three of the past four Southwest Tour races at Saugus, where 
the tour begins for the fourth consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my home track," Calczynski said, "so maybe I have a little bit of an 
advantage." 
</P>
<P>
NASCAR promoter Owen Kearns Jr. gives Calczynski a decided edge entering the 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
"But you never can tell what's going to happen," Kearns said. "You can't 
control the variables." 
</P>
<P>
Calczynski fell victim to variables last season at Silver State Raceway in 
South Lake Tahoe. Leading the pack with 11 laps to go, his engine blew, forcing 
him from the race. 
</P>
<P>
Beebe held a late lead at Phoenix International Raceway when a car spun into 
him and knocked him out of the race. Kelley fell victim to five flat tires 
during the season. 
</P>
<P>
Tires, Calczynski said, might be the determining variable tonight. Ordinarily a 
100-lap race, tonight's 125-lap event might boil down to whose tires boil 
first. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to get the guy in front of you to burn up his," Calczynski said, 
"by staying on his butt. Brakes and tires -- whoever has the best. You'll have 
to be a little smarter on the tire selection and change the car accordingly."

IBF MIDDLEWEIGHT CHAMPION WITH CELEBRITY FOLLOWING TO BATTLE ITALY'S KALAMBAY 
FOR $1.1 MILLION PURSE

LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In distance, Johnny Tocco's gym is just two miles off the Las Vegas Strip. But 
in mood, it might as well be two light years away. 
</P>
<P>
No gaudy lights here. No clanging of slot machines. 
</P>
<P>
Just the dull thud of fist on punching bag in a softly lit room dominated by a 
ring. 
</P>
<P>
The smell of sweat fills the air and fight posters fill the walls, mute 
testimony to the many past greats who have toiled here. 
</P>
<P>
One of the greats of the present, International Boxing Federation middleweight 
champion Michael Nunn, has been working here this week, moving around the ring 
under the admiring gaze of his Ten Goose Boxing Club handlers -- his manager, 
trainer, adviser and publicist -- and a seemingly unassuming middle-aged man, 
casually dressed in shirt, slacks and tennis shoes, who looks excited merely to 
be here. 
</P>
<P>
Just another fan? 
</P>
<P>
Well, yes and no. A fan he is, but Gene Hackman is not just another anything. 
Already an Academy Award winner, Hackman is facing another Oscar showdown for 
Best Actor on Wednesday with Dustin Hoffman, a battle of Hollywood 
heavyweights, but that seems to be the last thing on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
He has chosen to spend all of pre-Oscar week by the side of his favorite 
fighter as Nunn prepares to defend his title at the Las Vegas Hilton tonight 
against Sumbu Kalambay of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Hackman isn't the first actor to sit ringside for a fight, but when you see him 
sitting ringside while Nunn jumps rope, does stretching exercises and shadow 
boxes, you realize we're talking hard-core fan here. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw Muhammad Ali, then Cassius Clay, as an amateur," said Hackman, his arms 
leaning on the ropes, his eyes on Nunn, "and this guy reminds me of him. He 
moves so well. He's a great athlete, but also a real dancer. A phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
"I can relate to what he does because there are similarities to what I do for a 
living. The real champions have a sense of performance. They can rise to the 
moment, get the adrenaline flowing and perform. The difference is, they do it 
out of instinct. Actors have to be taught to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Hackman seemed almost embarrassed about his fascination with Nunn in particular 
and boxing in general. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I'm appalled at how much I like boxing," he said. "I guess we all 
are." 
</P>
<P>
Hackman is only one of the actors in Nunn's corner. Mr. T is a fan. So are 
Michael J. Fox, James Caan and Victor French, the first of Nunn's celebrity 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn's image has become irreparably linked with these stars. He lives in North 
Hollywood, but the prefight ads call him Hollywood's Michael Nunn. He lives in 
a new condominium, drives a Mercedes recently given to him by promoter Bob Arum 
and will receive his first seven-figure purse tonight, earning $1.1 million for 
the Kalambay fight. 
</P>
<P>
A national boxing magazine made Nunn its cover boy this month and called him 
"pound for pound the best fighter in the world," a description reserved for 
years for Sugar Ray Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Nunn, you've come a long way, baby. 
</P>
<P>
A journey of a thousand miles, Chinese philosopher Lao-tzu said, must begin 
with a single step. 
</P>
<P>
But in Nunn's case, his journey to fame and fortune began with a couple of 
missteps. 
</P>
<P>
The product of a poor neighborhood in Davenport, Iowa, Nunn found solace in the 
ring, away from the rough crowd he ran with. 
</P>
<P>
He concluded a brilliant amateur career (168-8 with 75 knockouts, two Junior 
Olympic titles and a second-place finish in the national Golden Gloves) in the 
1984 Olympic Trials. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn failed to make the U. S. team, winding up as an alternate when he lost to 
Virgil Hill. 
</P>
<P>
So where did that leave him? The next logical step would be to turn pro. 
</P>
<P>
But Nunn thought that it might be a misstep. 
</P>
<P>
He returned home and met with Bob Surkein, a former head of the Amateur Boxing 
Federation, a longtime amateur referee, and, as a Davenport resident, the man 
who had seen the potential in Nunn back when he started boxing at 13. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first spotted him," Surkein said, "I saw the new Cassius Clay-the 
speed, the reflexes, the infectious grin. He moved beautifully and he just 
looked like an athlete." 
</P>
<P>
After Nunn lost in the Olympic Trials, he came to see Surkein. 
</P>
<P>
"What are you going to do now?" Surkein asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Well," Nunn replied, "I'm going to hang around Davenport and get a job." 
</P>
<P>
Surkein just shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you mean, 'Get a job?' " he said. "Doing what? Selling drugs? Robbing 
banks? Mugging old ladies? Look, when you're ready to turn pro, I'll put you in 
with the right people and they'll look out for you." 
</P>
<P>
Nunn wasn't convinced. 
</P>
<P>
"As a kid," he said, "I fought because I was good. I never did it looking to a 
professional career. I just did it to pass the time and keep out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"After the Trials, I had a lot of people telling me, 'Why don't you box as a 
pro?' I said, 'I don't want to do that.' They said, 'Man, you just going to sit 
around here and do nothing?' I said, 'I guess so.' " 
</P>
<P>
And he did. But not for long. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, Mike," Surkein once said when Nunn dropped by for a visit, "there are no 
jobs here in the community. The only thing you can do is get into trouble. You 
have got two options: Stay around here and take a chance on going to the 
penitentiary. Or pursue a boxing career." 
</P>
<P>
Surkein made an offer. "Look, Mike, what's three years? Give me your best for 
three years," he said. "By that time, we'll know where you're going." 
</P>
<P>
Which was more, Nunn conceded to himself, than he knew at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"I got to thinking," he said. "What the hell. What's three years? I'm still 
young. I wasn't but 21 at the time. . . . Why not go for it?" 
</P>
<P>
Having decided on a course, Nunn needed a starting point. 
</P>
<P>
Surkein had met Dan Goossen at the Trials and was impressed. The North 
Hollywood salesman was struggling to start a boxing operation in North 
Hollywood with the help of some of his nine brothers and sisters. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking for more than just a business arrangement for Mike," Surkein 
said. "I wanted people who would make him the star of their stable. I saw 
closeness in the Goossen family and I saw evidence of people willing to try." 
</P>
<P>
Surkein and Nunn flew out to the Valley, checked out the Goossens' makeshift 
gym on a North Hollywood cul-de-sac, and decided to go for it. 
</P>
<P>
At least Surkein did. 
</P>
<P>
Returning to Davenport to pack, Nunn still had doubts about leaping into this 
strange new world. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael didn't have confidence in himself," Surkein said. "He was afraid to 
move out on his own to an area he had never been to in his life. It was a big 
change and he was scared. 
</P>
<P>
"But he couldn't stay in Davenport and train. There were not enough sparring 
partners. And he didn't train hard enough there. I used to say he was the best 
two-round amateur I'd ever seen. Besides, it wasn't good for him to stay in 
Davenport because he had the wrong kind of friends there." 
</P>
<P>
Three times Surkein made plane reservations for Nunn to return to California 
and three times Nunn failed to show. 
</P>
<P>
The third time, Surkein blew up. 
</P>
<P>
"You've missed your flight again, Mike," Surkein said by phone. "We're through. 
I can't go through this anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"Goodby." 
</P>
<P>
Click. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn called back. He'd go. 
</P>
<P>
That was nearly five years ago. Nunn has since won all 32 of his pro fights, 22 
by knockout, along with the IBF title. 
</P>
<P>
He has gone from prelim fighter to marquee name, from $1,500 a fight to 
tonight's big payday. 
</P>
<P>
"But with all his success," Surkein said, "he's kept his feet right on the 
ground. He hasn't changed." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Nunn may wear a better cut of cloth these days, but he hasn't forgotten 
the cloth he was cut from, his roots. 
</P>
<P>
No army of followers for him, no fleet of cars, no ton of gold trinkets around 
his neck, no Robin Givens. 
</P>
<P>
In July, Nunn will marry Loretha Boyce, his Davenport sweetheart of a decade. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been together for a long time," Nunn said. "She's been with me since the 
time when I didn't have nothing, when I just thought about being champ." 
</P>
<P>
After every fight, Nunn returns home to Davenport to visit his mother Madies, 
his brother Willie, and boyhood friends like Danny Don and John Haines. He even 
stays with Don and Haines on occasion. 
</P>
<P>
"They idolize me," Nunn said, "but when I get together with them, I don't have 
to put on a show. In some ways, they look at me now like I'm from another 
planet. But because I respect them and they respect me, we have remained close 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
Only once has Nunn strayed from his new life. Last year, he got involved in a 
fight in a Valley restaurant that allegedly was started by a friend of his. The 
case was settled out of court and no charges were pressed. 
</P>
<P>
It was a sharp reminder of the life he could have had. 
</P>
<P>
"I thank God that Bob Surkein existed," Nunn said. "I thank God that I listened 
to him. Otherwise, who knows what I would be now. There are so many temptations 
out there -- selling drugs, robbing banks. Thank God I got away from so many 
things in my community." 
</P>
<P>
Nor, insists Nunn, is there much danger he'll slip back or be attracted by the 
new temptations fame and fortune have brought his way. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to be somebody I'm not," he said. "I'm not really into material 
things. I'm going to buy my mother a big house after this fight, but that's 
about it. I can do without the rest of it. I just don't get caught up in it. 
</P>
<P>
"I can handle all this stuff as long as I keep positive people around me. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides, if I changed, my mother would kill me. All this stuff is future shock 
for my family -- seeing me on TV, people coming up and asking for autographs, 
businessmen trying to get close to me. You don't find too many celebrities in 
our background. My Mom says, 'It's only my son. What's everybody tripping out 
on.' If she ever saw me change, she'd grab me by the neck and yank me back to 
reality."

Damon Greer was on semester break Jan. 18 when he and nine other San Jose State 
basketball players walked out on Coach Bill Berry. Greer was on spring break 
when he learned Friday night that Berry had been relieved of his position by 
school administrators who also decided that none of the 10 boycotting players 
would be welcomed back. 
</P>
<P>
And as far as Greer is concerned, a clean break is what is best for all parties 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sad that he lost his job, but things had to happen for the better," said 
Greer, a freshman guard and a 1988 graduate of Cleveland High. "Things needed 
to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Greer and nine teammates walked away from the team complaining of "verbal 
abuse" and "mental cruelty" and vowed never to come back as long as Berry was 
coach. The 10 got their wish Friday when school administrators dismissed Berry, 
who completed the season and finished with a 242-244 record in 10 seasons at 
San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
Yet while the group succeeded in their goal, all became casualties in the 
process. Greer said he was not at all surprised to learn that the school 
decided to make the players collegiate free agents. 
</P>
<P>
"They never seemed to be behind us," said Greer, who is spending spring break 
at his parents' home in Lake View Terrace. "It's really no surprise. It's their 
decision -- the program was on shaky ground -- and that's what they wanted to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
In a press conference at the school Friday, Athletic Director Randy Hoffman 
announced the firing and said he was looking for a fresh start. 
</P>
<P>
"The university would like to take its men's basketball program in a different 
direction on and off the court," said Hoffman, who added that a national search 
has begun for Berry's successor. San Jose State finished 5-23 and was 0-12 
after the player boycott. 
</P>
<P>
Greer said that he began researching alternatives last November, weeks before 
the season started and months before the walkout. 
</P>
<P>
"I started looking around long before this ever happened," said Greer, who 
played in 11 games as a reserve point guard for the Spartans. "I've been 
looking at other options all along." 
</P>
<P>
Greer would not elaborate on what schools he had contacted but said that he 
would play at a junior college if necessary and would not be opposed to 
redshirting next season at a four-year school. 
</P>
<P>
"Redshirting would be no problem at all," he said. "Let's just say that I've 
looked at other options, that it's been taken care of beforehand." 
</P>
<P>
A National Collegiate Athletic Assn. representative said in January that the 
boycotting players with eligibility remaining must sit out a season after 
transferring to satisfy the NCAA residence requirement. It was not known Friday 
whether the school's decision to release the players from their scholarships 
would affect this requirement. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the 10 who left the team were seniors with no remaining eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
Greer said that he would continue to attend class -- the school honored the 
scholarships of the boycotting players through the completion of the spring 
semester. 
</P>
<P>
Two other former Valley-area players affected by the firing are Sean Davis, a 
freshman and 1987 graduate of El Camino Real, and Kevin Logan, a 1988 Westlake 
graduate who redshirted last season and did not participate in the walkout. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Svoboda, a senior center-forward from Glendale High, did not take part in 
the boycott, but he has no remaining eligibility. Davis, who lives in Los 
Angeles, could not be reached Friday. Logan, who was visiting his parents in 
Westlake Village, did not return calls. 
</P>
<P>
Greer said he was unsure what Davis's plans were but added that all of the 
players with eligibility started looking long ago for insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"We all looked at the pros and cons of it," Greer said. "And we said 'Let's do 
it.' "

GROSSMONT BASEBALL PREVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
SOME COACHES AREN'T HAPPY WITH SPLIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Grossmont Conference may have a new format after splitting into 2-A and 3-A 
divisions, but the same baseball teams are favored to be the best this season. 
</P>
<P>
Helix last year became the first team to go undefeated in the conference, which 
is traditionally strong in baseball. The Highlanders finished 16-0 in the final 
season the conference had all nine teams competing at 3-A, then won its first 
section 3-A title with a 1-0 victory over league rival Santana in the 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Helix Coach Jerry Schniepp, for one, isn't happy with the new format for 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like it at all," Schniepp said. "There are eight games to decide the 
league champion; I think that's ridiculous in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"Before you had to have two pitchers to win -- now you can win with one. And I 
think it takes away from the natural rivalry." 
</P>
<P>
One thing for certain -- Helix might not necessarily be the team to beat if the 
conference kept all nine schools under one division, but it is considered the 
favorite in the five-team 3-A league. 
</P>
<P>
Santana Coach Jim Saska, whose team could be challenged by Grossmont in the 2-A 
division, agrees with Schniepp about the split. 
</P>
<P>
"If you get yourself a top pitcher and a couple top hitters, you're going to 
contend at any level, 2-A or 3-A," Saska said. 
</P>
<P>
3-A TEAMS 
</P>
<P>
EL CAPITAN 
</P>
<P>
Last season's record: 10-15, 5-11 league (sixth, tie). 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Steve Vickery. 
</P>
<P>
Top returners: Zak Salmon (senior, IF); Robert Guerrero (senior, C); Jeremy 
McGarity (senior, P/1B). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomer: Mike Farrell (junior, P/2B); Jim Marchesi (junior, P). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The Vaqueros (6-4) finished second in the Sun Devil tournament in Las 
Vegas this week. Their only loss was to Las Vegas Valley, which is the No. 22 
team in the nation according to USA Today, averaging 16.8 runs. Marchesi (0-3, 
2.13 ERA) allowed just one earned run in the 4-0 loss. 
</P>
<P>
"Our strength has been and is going to be our pitching this year," Vickery 
said. 
</P>
<P>
McGarity, 3-0 pitching and .350 batting, is off to a good start. Junior 
left-hander David Rios is 2-1. Jason Phipps, last year's top pitcher, is 1-0 
after pitching a one-hitter with 12 strikeouts. Salmon was fourth in the 
conference last year with a .429 average, a school record 39 hits and 11 
doubles. 
</P>
<P>
GRANITE HILLS 
</P>
<P>
Last season's record: 15-10, 9-7 league (fourth). 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Gordy Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
Top returners: John Fenn (senior, 2B); Jeff Waymire (senior, SS); Brian Giles 
(senior, CF); Pete Stacey (senior, C). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomer: Ryan O'Coyne (junior, P). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The Eagles might have the strongest hitting in the league, with 
several experienced players returning. Fenn, an all-section 3-A second baseman, 
hit .416 last season, and Waymire returns at shortstop after hitting .361 with 
19 RBIs and five home runs. Giles, an all-section running back in football, hit 
.321 last season and .323 as a sophomore and returns to the outfield. Pitching 
will be key. The top returner is Brandt Glasener, 2-1 with a 2.94 ERA last 
year. O'Coyne was 6-3 on the junior varsity. 
</P>
<P>
HELIX 
</P>
<P>
Last season's record: 23-2, 16-0 league (first). 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Jerry Schniepp. 
</P>
<P>
Top returners: Rich Haar (senior, SS); Jason Ledford (senior, 1B); Tory Winrow 
(senior, 3B); Damon Chase (senior, 2B). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomer: Rob Ippolito (junior, P). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The infield is made up of three-year starters, but the Highlanders 
will miss all-section pitcher Rick Navarro (now at San Diego State) and catcher 
Ricky Page (U.S. International). Navarro led the section with a 14-0 record and 
a 1.30 ERA; Page led the conference in hitting at .470 last season. 
</P>
<P>
Haar averaged .400 last season and Chase .366. The question for the Highlanders 
is pitching; they also lost Damon Luban, who was 10-1 last season. Rob Ippolito 
has won his first two starts. 
</P>
<P>
MONTE VISTA 
</P>
<P>
Last season's record: 12-15, 5-11 league (sixth, tie). 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Rob Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
Top returners: Vern Mullis (junior, OF/P); Bryan Paul (senior, C). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomer: None. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The Monarchs were 5-21 two years ago, and last season Phillips guided 
them to a 12-16 record in his first year. Things are looking up. Monte Vista is 
playing on a new field and started the season 6-2-2. Monte Vista returns its 
infield but will have to find some offense; the Monarchs were one of the 
lightest hitting teams in the conference last year. Vern Mullis was a one-man 
show as a sophomore, hitting .342 and compiling a 6-4 record with a 4.35 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
MT. MIGUEL 
</P>
<P>
Last season's record: 8-17, 7-9 league (fifth). 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Mike Trigs. 
</P>
<P>
Top returners: Doug Kemp (senior, C); Dave Simms (senior, P). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomer: Gene Ethridge (senior, OF). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The Matadors finished a respectable fifth among nine teams last season 
after a rocky start. Mt. Miguel again got off slowly this season, committing 27 
errors leading to 38 unearned runs in losing six of its first seven. Ethridge, 
who was ineligible last season, was an all-conference running back who is 
headed to Weber State on a football scholarship. Trigs will be relying on 
several football players. Keith Baldwin, a speedy wide receiver, will be in the 
outfield, and lineman Doug Kemp will catch. Kemp hit .292 last season, and 
Simms was 2-1 with a save and a 3.67 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
2-A TEAMS 
</P>
<P>
EL CAJON VALLEY 
</P>
<P>
Last season's record: 7-19, 3-13 league (ninth). 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Doug Hartung. 
</P>
<P>
Top returners: Chris Holder (senior, 2B); Jack Kaewpalug (senior, P); Kevin 
Davis (senior, 3B). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Jason Firsich (junior, P); Fred Ernst (senior CF). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The Braves had a solid pitching staff last year but no offense to back 
it up. But they have gained in experience, losing just one senior, and could 
climb out of the league cellar. A senior infield could be the key. Hartung 
hopes Kaewpalug will be joined by Firsich in the rotation by midseason. The 
transfer from Northern California injured his pitching elbow in a tournament 
game and is out for three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
GROSSMONT 
</P>
<P>
Last season's record: 17-9, 12-4 league (second). 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Jeff Meredith. 
</P>
<P>
Top returners: Mark Gapski (senior, P); Todd Cadi (sophomore, C). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Jim Early (junior, DH); John Tatum (junior, 3B). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Meredith said he has made so many changes as Grossmont's new coach 
that the only thing staying the same is the uniforms. He inherited a team with 
great talent, especially in Gapski, who began the season 3-0, and Cadi, who 
made the all-league team as a freshman. The Foothillers have hit 12 home runs 
in five games. Grossmont is still shaky on defense but should again contend for 
the title. 
</P>
<P>
SANTANA 
</P>
<P>
Last season's record: 23-8, 11-5 league (third). 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Jim Saska. 
</P>
<P>
Top returners: Darren Forester (senior, 3B); Kyle Sebach (senior, SS); Paul 
Newark (senior P/1B). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Tom Weimbrecht (junior, 2B); Matt Hill (senior, P). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The talent returns, but Saska says the fundamentals are still a little 
rusty. He is impressed with Newark's pitching and hitting but is waiting for 
Sebach to break out of a slump. Santana's other two solid starting pitchers are 
newcomers Hill and Ferdie Hollis. Both are 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
VALHALLA 
</P>
<P>
Last season's record: 8-19, 4-12 (eighth). 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Terry Love. 
</P>
<P>
Top returners: Mark Iveson (senior, P), Dave Angotti (senior, C), John Scurlock 
(senior, P). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomer: Tony Clark (junior, P). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Love, the new coach, says Valhalla's biggest problem last year was 
attitude. His philosophy of playing more as a team has already proven 
successful with a 6-5-1 start. Clark, who hasn't played baseball for two years, 
returns as one of Valhalla's top pitchers. An outstanding switch-hitter, he 
will help Valhalla at the plate as well.

HIGH SCHOOL TRACK PREVIEW;

<P>
WEIGHTY MATTERS: FALLBROOK'S NOON HAS LOFTY GOALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It bothers Brent Noon that his sport -- track and field -- is mired in a 
steroids controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Noon, a Fallbrook High School junior, is one of the top athletes in San Diego 
County. His specialties are the shotput and discus, perhaps the two field 
events most readily identified with steroids. 
</P>
<P>
During a current Canadian inquiry into drug use, for example, sprinter Angella 
Taylor Issajenko said that in 1981 she went to American shotputter Brian 
Oldfield to obtain a steroid because "it was assumed that the throwers were on 
steroids." (Oldfield denies using or supplying them to others.) 
</P>
<P>
Noon also has heard rumors that he's bulking up with steroids, which promote 
muscle growth but have variety of undesirable side effects. 
</P>
<P>
"People just suppose that here's a big strong kid, so he's got to be on 
steroids," says his father, Jim. "But people who know us know we'd never cheat 
by using steroids. It's like robbery or theft, you're just stealing from your 
opponent. It's immoral and illegal." 
</P>
<P>
The rumors surface, Jim Noon says, for two reasons. No. 1 is Brent's size: 
6-feet-2, 258 pounds. What people fail to notice, Jim says, is that Brent lacks 
the well-defined muscles that steroids help develop. 
</P>
<P>
"I read that in Florida kids are using steroids just so their muscles look good 
when they go to the beach," Jim said. "But look at Brent -- he looks more like 
the Pillsbury Doughboy." 
</P>
<P>
Another reason people jump to conclusions may be Brent's performances. He 
already has a shotput mark of 66-4 1/2, at an indoor meet in Idaho in February. 
His top discus throw is 177-4. 
</P>
<P>
Those two personal bests are not likely to last long as Noon shoots for the 
next plateaus: a shotput of more than 70 feet and a discus throw over 200 feet 
-- both in the same meet. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad and brother keep telling me that I can throw the discus 200, 205 feet," 
Brent said. "But I've still got a few things to work out before I can do that." 
</P>
<P>
As for the shotput, Brent says he's shooting for 73 feet this year, knowing 
full well that the national record for a high school junior is 71-10. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, within the next couple meets, I'll go up to 70," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Noon is one of several area athletes who will be reaching for higher marks as 
the track season moves into the meat of the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The outlook in the boys' events: 
</P>
<P>
Sprints -- There already have been three 100-meter times under 11 seconds this 
year. Castle Park's Kiyoshi Moody and Mira Mesa's Bobby Nelson both have been 
timed at 10.8, and Orange Glen's Glen Reyes has run 10.9. Nelson and Hoover's 
Jerome Gross have run 21.8 in the 200. 
</P>
<P>
Middle distances -- Poway's Craig Ross ran a 49.4 in the 400 meters at the 
Pacific Rim Invitational at Poway Wednesday; it was one of several county-best 
times that day. Nelson (50.6) and Gross (50.3) are contenders in the 400. Mira 
Mesa's Jason Jackowski has the section's fastest time in the 800, running 
1:56.6 in the Pacific Rim meet. Fallbrook's Enrique Rodriguez (2:00.1) and 
Mount Carmel's Clay Biddle (2:00.1) also will be factors in the 800, as will 
Poway's Jesus Luna (2:01.7). 
</P>
<P>
Distances -- San Pasqual's Francis O'Neill has been cruising so far and has not 
approached last year's county best of 4:13.83 in the 1,600 or his times of 
1:52.8 in the 800 or 9:23.4 in the 3,200, both second best in the section. 
Rodriguez and Biddle have run 4:22.5 and 4:23.7 in the 1,600. 
</P>
<P>
Hurdles -- Poway's Jeff Haines (14.9 in the 110 high hurdles, 40.5 in the 300 
intermediates) has plenty of competition. Mira Mesa's Todd Stevens ran a 15.1 
in the 110 Wednesday. In the 300, Oceanside's Fred Dunn appears to be a rising 
star. He was a jumper last year, but in his first try at the intermediates this 
season, all he did was turn in the county's best time, 39.2. Mira Mesa has a 
pair of 300 hurdlers at the 40-second mark, Benny Lewis and Gene Metcalf. 
Haines' teammate, Alan Meadows (40.7), will not be left behind. 
</P>
<P>
High jump -- Oceanside's Joe Buchanon and Hilltop's Kurt Klaser showed in the 
Mustang Relays two weeks ago that they have the proper form to carry them 
higher than their current marks: 6-8 1/4 for Buchanon, 6-6 1/4 for Klaser. 
</P>
<P>
Pole vault -- Mount Carmel's Derrick Roth is the only county vaulter with a 
decent mark (14-6) so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
Long jump -- Reyes -- last year's section leader at 23-10 3/4 and whose top 
mark this year is 22-9 -- will be pushed here by University City's Jerome Price 
(23-3), Castle Park's Tom Brown (23-0) and teammate Lenny McGill (22-7). 
</P>
<P>
Triple jump -- McGill is way out in front of the competition with a mark of 
48-8. 
</P>
<P>
GIRLS 
</P>
<P>
Sprints -- University City's Angela Kimmey (12.4) and Mount Carmel's Vicki 
DeJesus (12.7) lead the pack in the 100. DeJesus (25.4) and Morse's Nicola 
Stennis (26.3) top the 200 field. 
</P>
<P>
Middle distances -- Mount Carmel has three of the top middle distance runners 
in the county: Allison Dring (59.0 in the 400), Angie Cooper (2:25.7 in the 
800) and Charity Stowell (2:26.3 in the 800). 
</P>
<P>
Distances -- Kira Jorgensen. This is the fourth track season in which Jorgensen 
will dominate the headlines. Her resume is impressive. Besides her two state 
titles in the 1,600, Jorgensen won the Kinney National cross-country 
championships in 1987. But her 21st-place finish in the same race last fall has 
people wondering if Jorgensen's dominance on the track also will end. Don't 
count on it. She won the invitational mile at the Mustang Relays two weeks ago 
with a 5:17.9 and ran a 5:19 leg in the distance medley at the same meet, 
helping Rancho Buena Vista to set a meet record of 13:02.87. For her efforts, 
slow as they were (Jorgensen ran a 4:49.54 1,600 last year for the state 
title), Jorgensen was named the meet's outstanding female athlete. 
</P>
<P>
Hurdles -- Poway's Kim Dill (15.4 in the 100 lows, 48.5 in the 300 lows) gets 
competition from San Pasqual's Kathy Stark (15.5 in the 100 lows), and Mount 
Carmel's Cassandra Tyson (46.4 in the 300 lows). 
</P>
<P>
High jump -- With Serra's Lynn Patrick, who finished first and second at state 
the past two seasons, forgoing track for volleyball, the area's best is Torrey 
Pines' Karyn Armstrong (5-8). 
</P>
<P>
Long, triple jumps -- Oceanside's Michelle Dimry, at 16-4 1/2 so far this 
season in the long jump, should at least match her section best of 18-2 1/2 
last year. Oceanside's Angela Sims is the top triple jumper at 35-5 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Throws -- Madison's Jennifer Viavia is one of the state's top performers in the 
shotput (43-1 3/4 last year) and discus (131-3 last year).

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: UCSD SPLITS DOUBLEHEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The UC San Diego baseball team split a doubleheader with Metropolitan State 
Friday, winning the first game, 3-0, and losing the second, 8-4. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Rupkey (7-0) went the distance, scattering five hits, for UCSD in the 
first game. Jim Martinez homered. 
</P>
<P>
In the second game, Metropolitan State scored three runs in both the fourth and 
sixth innings. Rusty Befus hit a bases-empty home run for Metropolitan State in 
the fourth. Mike Nussbaum (2-1) picked up the victory. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD (12-8) is ranked ninth in Division III, Metropolitan State 20th in 
Division II. 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma Nazarene College split a nonconference doubleheader with visiting 
Wisconsin, winning the first game, 4-0, and losing the second, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Tema went one for two, scored two runs and had two RBIs for the Crusaders 
in the opening victory, then went two for three, doubled twice and scored Point 
Loma's runs in the loss. 
</P>
<P>
Crusader Coach Carroll Land can earn his 500th career victory by beating Cal 
Lutheran once in a doubleheader today. 
</P>
<P>
SOFTBALL 
</P>
<P>
UCSD (11-4) finished second in the Triton Tri tournament, losing to champion 
Cal State Stanislaus, 6-5, but defeating third-place San Bernardino, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
The Tritons were led in both games by Dana Chaiken, three for four with a 
double in the first game and two for four in the second. 
</P>
<P>
Dianna Moreno knocked in the winning run with a single in the seventh inning of 
the second game. 
</P>
<P>
MEN'S TENNIS 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State defeated Iowa, 5-4, at the UC Irvine tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs were led by Joe McDonough, who defeated Martin Aguire, 4-6, 6-4, 
6-0, at No, 2 singles, and Woody Yocom, who defeated Lars Nordmark, 3-6, 7-6 
(11-9), 6-2 at No. 3 singles. 
</P>

CHRISTIANS WILL GREET EASTER AT DAWN RITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, Times Religion Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a pre-dawn ritual throughout Southern California, thousands of Christians 
will get up early Sunday for sunrise services on the most important holiday on 
the Christian calendar, a day focused on New Testament accounts of Jesus risen 
from the dead. 
</P>
<P>
The Easter services -- some beginning even before sunrise at 5:45 a.m. -- 
typically feature familiar readings and musical presentations, with only 
occasional departures from each annual event's traditions. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Hollywood Bowl sunrise service, this year dedicated to 
Armenians affected by last December's devastating earthquake, will feature a 
sermon by an Armenian churchman for the first time in the event's 69 years -- 
Archbishop Vatche Hovsepian of the Armenian Church of North America. 
</P>
<P>
Armenian Christians, as well as Protestants, Catholics and Anglicans, celebrate 
Easter this Sunday. Eastern Orthodox churches, whose tradition requires that 
the holiday fall after the Jewish Passover period, will observe Easter on April 
30. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Celebrities to Appear 
</P>
<P>
The Bowl service, which traditionally involves entertainment celebrities, will 
include Cyd Charisse reading "The Master Is Coming" and songs by Robert 
Guillame, currently starring in the film "Lean on Me," and Rhonda Fleming. Bob 
Ralston, long featured on the Lawrence Welk television program, will be an 
organ soloist. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Easter message of the Mormon Church's First Presidency will be read 
during the prologue, and Pope John Paul II's Easter message will be read by 
Auxiliary Bishop Juan Arzube of the Los Angeles Catholic Archdiocese, prior to 
the service's musical finale. 
</P>
<P>
Other clergy participating include the Revs. Harry Durkee of Hollywood Lutheran 
Church, Clarence J. Davis Jr. of Mt. Hebron Baptist Church, Patsy Nichols 
Redwood of St. Paul's Presbyterian Church and Roy McKoewn, founder of World 
Opportunities International. 
</P>
<P>
Parking and admission are free for the service, which lasts from 5:15 to 7 
a.m., but organizers also made their customary last-minute appeal for calla 
lilies. People who bring lilies to the Bowl between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. today 
were promised reserved seats. 
</P>
<P>
The annual sunrise service atop Mt. Rubidoux in Riverside, which has an 
interdenominational Protestant flavor, will have a sermon by Dan Matthews, host 
of the Christian Lifestyle Magazine television program and executive director 
in Newbury Park of the Seventh-day Adventists' Faith for Today productions. 
</P>
<P>
Regular participants Robert Dyer and Horace Stevens, respectively, will read 
the poem "God of the Open Air" and sing a solo. The Mt. Rubidoux service, which 
usually draws about 2,000 worshipers, will be held for the 77th time since its 
inaugural service in 1909. The tradition has been interrupted only by one 
rain-out and three wartime cancellations. The service will begin at 5:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
More than 11,000 persons are expected to turn out for sunrise services held at 
four Forest Lawn Memorial-Park cemeteries and organized by a variety of 
ministerial associations and church councils. All of them will start at 5:45 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The largest crowd is expected at Forest Lawn in Covina Hills where the speaker 
will be the Rev. G. Michael Cocoris, senior pastor of Glendora's Church of the 
Open Door. Rich Buhler, an ordained minister who hosts the syndicated radio 
talk show "Talk From the Heart," will speak at the 28th annual sunrise service 
at Forest Lawn in Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
Auxiliary Bishop Carl Fisher of the Los Angeles Catholic Archdiocese will speak 
at the Forest Lawn-Sunnyside service in Long Beach, and the Rev. George Smith, 
senior pastor of North Hollywood First Assembly of God, will preach the sermon 
at the Hollywood Hills facility. In addition, a Spanish-language service will 
be held indoors at 5:45 a.m. in the Hall of the Crucifixion-Resurrection at 
Forest Lawn, Glendale, under the auspices of the Hispanic Baptist Churches of 
the American Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
Among other early morning outdoor services are the 6 a.m. service in the 
amphitheater at Wayfarers Chapel in Rancho Palos Verdes; the 25th annual Morro 
Bay service, starting at 6 a.m. adjacent to Morro Rock, and the 20th annual 
Easter Service on Horseback, sponsored by the Valley Horse Owners Assn., 
starting at 9 a.m. at Orcas Park in Lake View Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego County, three traditional sunrise services will be staged. The 
72nd service on Mt. Helix in La Mesa, sponsored by the Wesleyan Church, will 
start at 6:30 a.m.; the 68th annual service atop Mt. Soledad in La Jolla will 
begin at 6 a.m. and the 40th annual service at Cabrillo National Monument will 
start at 6:30 a.m.

BOARD GAME POKES FUN AT TV EVANGELISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Religious News Service 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you're a cynical secularist or a Christian with a sense of humor, a new 
board game might be just the thing to help you recover from the televangelism 
scandals. 
</P>
<P>
Titled "Fleece the Flock," it's the brainchild of three Connecticut residents 
who formed Tongue-in-Cheek Productions for the venture. Elizabeth Fuller of 
Weston, a Unitarian, originated the idea and teamed up with inventor Stanley 
Mason of Weston and illustrator Roy Doty of Norwalk -- both of whom are United 
Methodists -- to create the game. It is produced and marketed by Regent 
Continental in Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
Each player starts with $50 million in play money and a miniature collection 
plate to move around the board. There are angel, devil and God's will cards 
that help or hinder the players as they seek to build televangelism empires. 
</P>
<P>
"In no way it is against religion," Fuller says of the game, which sells for 
$25. "It's a board game that pokes fun at the TV evangelists who have been 
taking advantage of innocent people." 
</P>
<P>
The game originator says she is surprised at the amount of publicity the game 
has been getting in national media. She believes it indicates that "people have 
had it with these hucksters."

ROMAN CATHOLIC ARCHBISHOP, RABBI SHARE JOURNEY OF MUTUAL DISCOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MSGR. ROYALE VADAKIN and RABBI ALFRED WOLF, Vadakin is director of the Los 
Angeles Catholic Archdiocese's Office of Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs 
and pastor of St. Vibiana Cathedral. Wolf is director of the Skirball Institute 
on American Values of the American Jewish Committee and rabbi emeritus of 
Wilshire Boulevard Temple. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Editor's Note: The following article is excerpted from a chapter in the "Twenty 
Years of Jewish-Catholic Relations," published in 1986 by Paulist Press and 
edited by Eugene J. Fisher, A. James Rudin and Marc H. Tanenbaum. The 
co-authors also have written "A Journey of Discovery, A Resource Manual for 
Jewish-Catholic Dialogue," soon to be published by Tabor Publishing Co., 
Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been a rich and extensive history of contacts between the Catholic 
and Jewish communities. 
</P>
<P>
As early as the 1920s friendships developed between Archbishop John J. Cantwell 
and Rabbi Edgar F. Magnin and they established contacts between their flocks to 
the extent then possible. The involvement of Jewish leaders in such Roman 
Catholic social welfare institutions as St. Anne's Maternity Hospital and Holy 
Family Adoption Service gave early promise of things to come. 
</P>
<P>
In the '50s and '60s, Loyola University -- now Loyola-Marymount -- became an 
effective point of contact. Its president, (Father) Charles Casassa, introduced 
a course on Judaism taught by a rabbi and, together with Neil Sandberg of the 
American Jewish Committee, developed a rich program on intercultural education. 
These efforts prepared a number of key persons for leadership in the 
post-Vatican II era. 
</P>
<P>
While, during this period, Catholic-Jewish relations were largely limited to 
especially motivated individuals, the (Second Vatican Council's 1965) 
proclamation of Nostra Aetate (urging cordial relations with non-Christian 
religions) opened the door to official institutional contacts. With the 
accession of Cardinal Timothy Manning as Los Angeles archbishop, the 
Archdiocesan Commission on Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs established a 
working relationship with the Interreligious Activities Committee of the 
Southern California Board of Rabbis. 
</P>
<P>
The great expectations stimulated by Vatican II were not fulfilled by these 
cordial but still superficial encounters. Difficulties of which we had been 
unaware now needed to be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Call to Dialogue 
</P>
<P>
The first tentative steps in the early seventies included the inception of the 
Interreligious Council of Southern California as a tri-faith body incorporating 
the archdiocese, the board of rabbis and two area-wide church councils 
representing the mainline Protestant judicatories. This umbrella organization 
was later to expand, embracing most of the major world religions. In the same 
time frame, a priest-rabbi dialogue was initiated by Archbishop Manning. 
</P>
<P>
Planning the tenth anniversary observance of Nostra Aetate, an interreligious 
leadership group from the American Jewish Committee, the archdiocese and the 
board of rabbis evaluated what had taken place and what would be needed to 
sustain the exchange. Two clear requirements were structure -- an organization 
able to assume responsibility -- and continuity -- not "one-night-stands" for 
the exchange of shallow pleasantries. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining question was the group's agenda. Four agenda items (were 
proposed): Israel, Church-State Relations, Anti-Semitism, and Respect for Life. 
</P>
<P>
While each prompted lively discussion, Respect for Life provoked the most 
intense response. We hesitated. Concentrating on this controversial and 
emotion-charged issue might endanger our entire relationship. We came to 
realize, however, that little would be gained by tackling topics of easy 
consensus. Wrestling with gut issues, confronting our differences and hammering 
out our difficulties would help us to grow. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the three organizations jointly announced the formation of a Los Angeles 
Catholic-Jewish Respect Life Committee. No specific directives or limits were 
given to the committee, other than to venture and create, respecting the basic 
principles of interreligious dialogue and the dignity of human life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Balance Sought 
</P>
<P>
We intended our committee to be as representative as possible and therefore 
attempted to balance its membership between Catholics and Jews -- the latter to 
include Conservative, Orthodox and Reform -- between clergy and lay people, men 
and women. We looked for members of relevant professions, such as medicine and 
law. We wanted people who were recognized in the community for their dedication 
to life values. Subsequent experience showed that our care in selecting 
committee members was well worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
Now we had to select one of the many topics under the umbrella, "Respect Life," 
such as care for the young, the aged, the single parent, the incurably ill, and 
the dying. In the climate of 1976, abortion was clearly the life issue of most 
intent concern. We took the risk of starting with it. 
</P>
<P>
Inasmuch as there was a clear divergence (on abortion) between the two faith 
traditions, we knew that there was no possibility for our committee to reach a 
consensus statement. We could agree, however, that our conclusions should 
reflect both pluralism and harmony. 
</P>
<P>
All participants shared a dawning sense of mutual discovery: Roman Catholics 
discovered an ancient and continuing Jewish body of legal reflections on pre- 
and post-natal life and, at the same time, the allowance for differences of 
opinion in both Talmudic and modern Judaism. Jewish participants discovered the 
very rich, ancient, highly structured and all-inclusive Catholic ethic, along 
with its vital interest in contemporary legal and scientific studies. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's final product, "Jewish and Roman Catholic Reflections on 
Abortion and Related Issues," published in September 1977, began with a joint 
preface and an opening section entitled "Respect Life Reflections." 
</P>
<P>
There followed two major and totally distinct statements: "Jewish View on 
Abortion" and "Catholic view on Abortion." Neither claimed to be the Jewish or 
the Catholic view, but a Jewish and a Catholic view. Each community felt 
comfortable in articulating its position with clear perspective and without 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commitment to Life Issues 
</P>
<P>
With the success of a completed statement behind us, we agreed to move from 
pre-birth to near-death by selecting as our topic, "Caring for the Dying 
Person." We replaced committee members whose interest was limited to one issue 
with people possessing expertise in the new area. The director of a major 
hospice and the physician in charge of a major burn center were most helpful in 
our exploration. 
</P>
<P>
This selection process was repeated as we turned to our next topic, "The Single 
Parent Family." Our "experts" included three single parents, one Jewish, one 
Hispanic Catholic and one black Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
While we had developed helpful techniques, we never allowed the committee 
process to become routine. Intensive argument arose over the next topic, "The 
Nuclear Reality," which focused primarily on the peaceful use of nuclear power. 
We found that individual differences of opinion were far more pronounced than 
the differences between the two faith traditions. 
</P>
<P>
In our dialogue process, we learned a few things: 
</P>
<P>
First, that quantitative information alone does not pave the way out of moral 
dilemmas. Regardless of the massive input we had from highly respected experts 
-- as in the nuclear area -- ultimately we had to voice opinions based on our 
respective ethical commitments. 
</P>
<P>
Second, that we were challenged to speak on behalf of our religious communities 
and to do so in clear, intelligible terms. More than writing skill was required 
of us, namely clear vision of the moral challenges offered by our religious 
traditions and precision in applying them to present-day realities. 
</P>
<P>
Third, that the interreligious dialogue demands commitment as well as 
flexibility, determination as well as patience. It may be necessary to discuss 
the same subject again and again to gain the necessary insight where agreement 
can be reached, where compromise is possible and where firm but friendly 
disagreement must be recorded. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Ripple Effect 
</P>
<P>
The tremendous size of Los Angeles notwithstanding, we can demonstrate that our 
efforts at dialogue have produced a substantial ripple effect. While the 
Respect Life Committee was motivated, at least in part, by earlier interfaith 
successes, it inspired other programs and projects in turn. 
</P>
<P>
The Interreligious Council of Southern California, an ongoing forum for the 
major religions, has sponsored numerous events for the metropolitan area, 
including religious services to the 1984 Olympics, and has fostered friendships 
between individual religious leaders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leadership Day 
</P>
<P>
Other activities include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The annual Catholic-Jewish Women's Leadership Day, planned and executed by 
a growing core group of women actively involved in their respective religious 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lectures by Jewish scholars at the annual Religious Education Conferences 
sponsored by the Dioceses of Los Angeles and Orange and attended by more than 
18,000 professional and lay religious educators. Speakers have included Marc 
Tanenbaum, Samuel Sandmel and Elie Wiesel. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Catholic dialogues with Episcopalians, Lutherans, Muslims and Buddhists as 
well as Jewish dialogues with Muslims and Protestants, and with black and 
Korean churches. 
</P>
<P>
 -- INTERSEM, an annual two-day conference for students and faculty of 
Catholic, Jewish and Protestant seminaries in Southern California and the San 
Francisco Bay area, enabling future ministers, priests and rabbis to meet their 
counterparts and to understand their neighbors' religions. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Seminary Exchange, an intensive sharing of faculty between St. John's 
Roman Catholic Seminary and the Los Angeles campus of Hebrew Union College. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The annual Model Passover Seder, hosted by the Wilshire Boulevard Temple. 
With a minimum of pulpit rearrangement and a maximum of imagination, the 
synagogue's spacious sanctuary becomes the Passover dining room for a "Jewish 
family" consisting of 800 to 1000 Catholic High School students with faculty 
members and priests. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Project Discovery 
</P>
<P>
The growing complexity of our Catholic-Jewish program led us to search for a 
method of more effective coordination for all our projects. In 1982, a grant 
from the Wilshire Boulevard Temple Interreligious Fund enabled us to establish 
Project Discovery, with the authors serving as co-directors. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to serving as an umbrella for existing exchanges, Project Discovery 
opened the door for an exciting new venture: the authentic and personalized 
teaching of Judaism in Catholic high schools. While the annual model seder 
provides a one-time encounter with Judaism for approximately 1,000 students a 
year, we felt that a more intensive experience was needed. In cooperation with 
the Hebrew Union College, we developed an intern program beginning with two 
Catholic high schools. 
</P>
<P>
The intern is on campus for an entire morning during each week of the school 
year, is readily available to answer questions about Jews and Judaism, and 
becomes a familiar figure to faculty and students. More important, the school 
now has a ready resource for a variety of situations: instructing a religion 
class that deals intensively with Judaism in the intertestamental period or 
briefly explaining the roots of Easter in the Jewish liturgical year; 
responding to a social studies teacher's request for information on Nazi 
concentration camps or a literature instructor's need for information on Jews 
in the American novel. Students in this type of experience not only get to know 
facts about Judaism but encounter a person modeling Judaism as a living faith. 
</P>
<P>
The interns themselves are getting an education about the Catholic Church, its 
institutions, its leaders and its people which is bound to enrich their 
personal and professional lives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Summary of Observations 
</P>
<P>
We know that it takes far more than cosmetic treatments and public relations 
programs to achieve our goal, which is nothing less than changing perceptions 
and attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
This goal can not be reached by merely correcting mutual misinformation. It 
requires thinking and feeling with "the other." The wisdom of the Plain Indians 
advises walking in "the other fellow's moccasins." The Jewish Ethics of the 
Fathers urges not to judge the other person "until you have stood in his 
place." 
</P>
<P>
Meeting, therefore, is what the varied aspects of our "Los Angeles Story" have 
in common: representatives of the major world religions meeting monthly in each 
other's places of worship as the Interreligious Council; members of the 
Priest-Rabbi Dialogue and of the Respect Life Committee meeting year after 
year; Catholic, Jewish and Protestant seminarians, Catholic and Jewish women, 
meeting for solid blocks of time. 
</P>
<P>
What is destroyed is more than misinformation -- it is stereotypes. What is 
conveyed is more than facts -- it is understanding.

RELIGION BRIEFS: LUTHERAN BISHOP TO BOYCOTT PAPAL MASS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Norwegian Lutheran bishop has announced that he will not participate in an 
ecumenical service to be held in Trondheim's Nidaros Cathedral June 2 during 
Pope John Paul II's visit to the country. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Per Lonning is not boycotting the service because he is opposed to 
ecumenism. Quite the opposite, the former member of the Central Committee of 
the World Council of Churches says he will stay away to protest what he sees as 
the Pope's slowing down of the ecumenism of the 1960s and 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Lonning is quoted in the Lutheran World Information news service as saying, 
"What I do is not a protest against, but together with, my Catholic brothers 
and sisters whom I have learned to know and appreciate during my years in 
ecumenical work." 
</P>
<P>
The Lutheran bishop added, "I know I have a considerable number of Catholic 
friends with me in this."

SPECIAL MASS TO BE OFFERED GAY CATHOLICS

SAN JOSE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Homosexual Catholics will be offered a special weekly Mass by the Diocese of 
San Jose, starting April 1. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Pierre DuMaine also announced plans for expanded sacramental and 
spiritual activities as part of the diocese's new pastoral guidelines for the 
ministry of homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
"The guidelines accept, without elaboration, the perennial teaching of the 
Catholic Church on sexual morality, conscience and personal sin," said Father 
Eugene J. Boyle, spokesman for the diocese, which serves 355,000 Catholics. 
"It's a matter of supplying religious services for members of this (homosexual) 
group who want this service. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not an attempt to segregate gay and lesbian Catholics out," he said. 
"Many will continue to go to their parishes, where, for the most part, they are 
accepted." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mass at University 
</P>
<P>
A chapter of the national Catholic gay group, Dignity, has been sponsoring Mass 
at the Campus Christian Center chapel associated with San Jose State 
University. Members of the group worked out an arrangement with church 
officials to allow the diocese to take over sponsorship of the services. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to be in complete conformity to what the Vatican asked for and what a 
few other dioceses in this country are doing," said Bill Ryan, spokesman for 
the U.S. Catholic Conference in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Despite church teachings against an active homosexual life style, dioceses in 
Chicago, San Francisco and a few other cities have held services for 
homosexuals and taken over sponsorship from Dignity after its 1987 declaration. 
The archdiocese of Los Angeles does not have weekly services specifically for 
homosexuals but welcomes them at regular Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Homosexual orientation is being accepted, Boyle said, though Catholic teaching 
declares sexual activity outside marriage immoral. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the Vatican issued a letter to bishops on the pastoral care of 
homosexuals and asked them to develop "appropriate forms" of care. 
</P>
<P>
"No one's going to make a personal judgment on who comes to Mass or does not 
come," Boyle said. "We're offering the opportunity of religious services for 
gay and lesbian Catholics who want to partake of it. When it comes to matters 
of conscience, that's between themselves and God. We're not going to judge 
that."

LUTHERANS JOIN IN ANCIENT BLESSING OF OILS RITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSSELL CHANDLER and JOHN DART, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lutheran pastors renewed their vows and their bishop blessed oils in a Holy 
Week service that is more traditional in Roman Catholic and Episcopal Church 
dioceses. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop J. Roger Anderson of Los Angeles, who oversees 158 Southern California 
congregations of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, said the rite is 
infrequently conducted in Lutheran churches. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not seen as essential, but it has become an option in an attempt to 
restore some of the ancient services," said Anderson, who led a similar service 
last year. This year's ceremony on Thursday was at Redeemer Lutheran Church in 
Rowland Heights. 
</P>
<P>
As in the Episcopal and Roman Catholic churches, the renewal of vows by the 
clergy is voluntary. The service also incorporates a blessing of oils to be 
used in the coming year for anointing the sick and in other rites. 
</P>
<P>
Episcopal Bishop Frederick H. Borsch of Los Angeles presided over the annual 
rites Tuesday before about 150 priests at St. Luke's Church in Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
In the Catholic ceremony Monday night at St. Vibiana Cathedral in downtown Los 
Angeles, Archbishop Roger M. Mahony blessed the oil -- filling three large 
silver urns -- to be used in parish baptisms and confirmations, anointing the 
sick and ordaining priests. 
</P>
<P>
During the Mass, about 300 of the archdiocese's 1,280 priests, plus deacons and 
members of men's and women's religious orders, renewed their commitment to 
faithfully proclaim the Gospel and serve the church. 
</P>
<P>
As the priests and bishops processed down the center aisle, about a dozen 
demonstrators carrying signs and holding candles stood outside the cathedral 
protesting the Catholic Church's ban on women priests. 
</P>
<P>
"Now is the oil of women's ordination being crushed and refined. When will it 
be blessed?" one sign proclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
"The hierarchy refuses us but God's Spirit calls us," explained Margaret 
Arnold. She said the group was part of the Chicago-based National Assembly of 
Religious Women. 
</P>
<P>
During his homily, or sermon, Mahony referred to the priest shortage and 
repeated one of his favorite themes: 
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that Jesus Christ is calling more than enough young men into 
priestly service in this archdiocese, more than enough young women to go on in 
religious communities. . . . Jesus tells us prayer and sacrifice and suffering 
and adoration and petition will bring about all the laborers we need for the 
harvest."

TEACHER SLAIN IN AMBUSH AT HOME; 
</P>
<P>
FORMER STUDENT QUESTIONED, RELEASED; NOT A SUSPECT, POLICE SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A well-liked veteran teacher at Grant High School in Van Nuys was ambushed and 
shot to death as he left his Sherman Oaks home for school early Friday, Los 
Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
A former student at the school was questioned about the attack for about six 
hours Friday but police released him and said they had no suspects in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Hal Arthur, 60, who was senior class adviser and had taught government and 
history classes at the school since 1962, was hit in the back with at least 
three bullets moments after he opened the door of his car parked in front of 
his home in the 13900 block of Milbank Street, police said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attacks on Teachers 
</P>
<P>
The shooting was the latest in a wave of recent attacks on teachers, who have 
been increasingly concerned about their safety and school violence. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur was following his daily practice of leaving for the nearby school at 6 
a.m., police said. He had placed a bag containing school books and homework he 
had graded the night before in the car and was about to step into it when an 
assailant with a .22-caliber semi-automatic weapon fired on him from across the 
street and behind. 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly does not appear to be a random shooting," said Lt. Warren 
Knowles, commander of the Van Nuys Division detective bureau. "Someone was more 
than likely waiting." 
</P>
<P>
At least six shots were fired before the gunman sped away in a dark-colored 
sedan, police said. Arthur's wife, Virginia, and son, Jason, a senior at Grant 
High, ran from the house to where the victim was laying in the street. Several 
neighbors, who also heard the shots, ran to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur was taken by paramedics to nearby Sherman Oaks Community Hospital where 
he was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
Police said there was no evidence indicating a motive or suspect in the 
killing. Robbery was ruled out because the gunman did not approach the victim, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the investigation focused on a 16-year-old Van Nuys boy who had 
attended Grant High until February when he was transferred to North Hollywood 
High School because of disciplinary problems stemming from a campus fight. 
</P>
<P>
Knowles said investigators decided to question the boy because 10 to 12 Grant 
students had given his name and said they believed he had access to guns and 
may have held a grudge against Arthur. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, who had not attended school at North Hollywood High since Tuesday, was 
taken into custody at his home about 2:30 p.m. and taken to the police station 
for questioning. He was released about 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no evidence to connect the kid to this case," said Detective Mel 
Arnold. "We are looking elsewhere. We are looking at all avenues. We need 
people who may have information to come forward. 
</P>
<P>
" We have found no reason why anybody would have a grudge against this guy," 
said Arnold. Arthur was described by his fellow teachers, former and current 
students, and neighbors as a well-liked and respected teacher who had a good 
sense of humor, was outgoing and helped plan the senior prom each year. As a 
sidelight, Arthur organized Hal Arthur Tours for the last six years, taking 
students from all over the Valley on a 36-day trip to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Grant Principal Bob Collins called Arthur the "pied piper" of the senior class. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
He 'Was an Institution' 
</P>
<P>
"Hal was an institution," Collins said. "He was the type of individual who 
really gained the confidence and enthusiasm of the senior class." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Gruenberg, dean of students at Grant High, who knew Arthur for 25 years, 
said his longtime friend was a gourmet and a lover of traveling, books and 
classical music. 
</P>
<P>
He said Arthur was easy-going and rarely sent students to him because of 
disciplinary problems. But Arthur could be tough, too, said Gruenberg, 
explaining how the two first met when Gruenberg was trying to stop a student 
from scaling a fence. The student punched Gruenberg in the face and broke his 
nose, "but Hal grabbed him and tackled him . . . he always backed his friends." 
</P>
<P>
Students described Arthur as a friend and confidant. He secretly helped those 
who couldn't afford to go to proms or rent coats and ties for graduation -- he 
even helped wallflowers find dates for a prom. 
</P>
<P>
Students at the school were shocked and many cried when Arthur's death was 
announced over the public address system during first period. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seniors to Honor Him 
</P>
<P>
Seniors said they plan to dedicate their graduation and their yearbook to 
Arthur. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a special man," said senior Alon Elbaz-Deckel, student body historian 
who planned to go with Arthur to Europe this summer. "Always doing something 
for somebody else. . . . The students always came first." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Halpern, who was a student of Arthur's before graduating from Grant in 
1966 and is now a teacher at the school, said that two years ago when Arthur 
heard that one of her students couldn't afford to go to the prom, he arranged a 
free prom ticket and a gown from a local dress shop. He also "got boys jackets 
and ties for graduation if they could not afford them," she said. But Halpern 
said Arthur also was humble about such acts and "no one ever knew." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday flags were at half-staff at the school where 3,100 students attend. 
</P>
<P>
The walls of Arthur's room, Bungalow 18, were papered with clippings about 
Grant sports, jazz music and food reviews and postcards from around the world. 
In one corner was a poster with a caricature of his face and signed by the 
Class of '88. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Psychologists Offer Aid 
</P>
<P>
A group of 12 school district psychologists came to the school Friday and 
planned to return Monday to speak with students and faculty. On Friday they 
talked to about 20 students, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur's death follows other incidents of violence against Los Angeles-area 
teachers. On March 6, a 15-year-old boy at Olive Vista Junior High School in 
Sylmar stabbed his teacher in the back while she was writing him up for 
misbehavior. In February, a teacher at Rosemont Junior High School in La 
Crescenta disarmed a 13-year-old boy who brandished a loaded .357 magnum in a 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
The attacks have heightened concerns generally about school violence. According 
to United Teachers-Los Angeles President Wayne Johnson, assaults on teachers 
that require medical treatment average one a day in the district. Statistics 
provided by the Los Angeles Unified School District show that while campus 
assaults overall have not risen, reports of incidents involving firearms have 
tripled and the number involving knives has doubled over the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
Although no student is considered a suspect, Arthur's death has raised concerns 
about teacher safety, Halpern said. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you do?" she said. "You never fail a kid? Never discipline them?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Memorial Services Set 
</P>
<P>
Memorial services for Arthur will be held early next week at Grant High, said 
Rabbi Jim Kaufman, of Temple Beth Hillel in North Hollywood where Arthur and 
his family were active members. 
</P>
<P>
"I've known him since he was 12 years old -- he was a superb human being," 
Kaufman said of Arthur. "It was a real tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day Friday several students from Grant High drove slowly by 
Arthur's home or stopped nearby. Neighbors also stood by until long after the 
police had left the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur lived next door to a woman who was his student at Grant in the late '60s 
and whose daughter was currently in his government class. She asked that their 
names not be published. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew him as a teacher and a neighbor," the mother said at her home Friday. 
"He was a perfect neighbor and a well-liked teacher. This is so hard to 
believe. Why him? Of course, why would anyone do this to anybody? But I can't 
believe someone would want to harm him." 
</P>
<P>
The daughter said that one of Arthur's last assignments to his students in the 
senior government class was an essay on gun control which followed class 
discussions about drive-by shootings, gang violence and other recent crimes 
involving guns. 
</P>
<P>
The daughter brought her essay home Thursday. On it, Arthur had written, "Very 
Good" and drawn a happy face.

SUCCESSFUL RECORD CITED;

<P>
DEL MAR GROUP SELECTED TO RUN RACE TRACK FOR 20 MORE YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Citing the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club's success at drawing people while 
maintaining the suburban tranquility of surrounding cities, the state Race 
Track Leasing Commission decided Friday to begin negotiations with the club for 
a new 20-year contract to run the famed track. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by the six-member commission, established by state lawmakers 
solely to select an operator for the Del Mar Racetrack, ended a long, grueling 
evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
After spending nine months reviewing proposals from six applicants for the 
contract to run the annual 43-day horse-racing season, the commission narrowed 
the field to two finalists: the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club, the track's current 
operator, and John Brunetti, a New Jersey construction magnate and operator of 
Florida's Hialeah Park Racetrack. 
</P>
<P>
Familiarity with the Thoroughbred Club and its plans to continue to emphasize 
horse racing, rather than use the race track for a number of entertainment 
events as proposed by other bidders, apparently weighed heavily in the final 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
During the hearings by the commission, civic leaders and residents from Del Mar 
and neighboring Solana Beach backed the Thoroughbred Club and expressed concern 
about zealous profiteers who might introduce raucous concerts and destroy 
neighborhood serenity. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe we have two strong proposals," commission member Bob Vice said. "But 
I believe we have to choose an operator that can deal with the concerns of the 
local community and generate the best return for the state. 
</P>
<P>
Describing the Thoroughbred Club as "a credible operator who has a willingness 
to work with the commission and who has a proven record," Vice proposed that 
the club be awarded the 20-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
From the start, the local Thoroughbred Club was considered the favorite to win 
the contract, based on its accomplishments over the last 19 years. The 
organization guided the track from obscurity to prominence. 
</P>
<P>
"We're delighted," said Joe Harper, executive vice president and general 
manager of the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club. "It's going to be a lot different 
from when we started 19 years ago. There's a lot more money to be generated and 
we're looking forward to it." 
</P>
<P>
Harper also said the club's nonprofit status -- all revenue is returned either 
to the operation or the state -- helped it win the contract. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Good Relations 
</P>
<P>
The club has maintained good relations with local communities, as demonstrated 
by the endorsements it received from local homeowners' association and city 
councils. 
</P>
<P>
During the commission's last hearing, the Thoroughbred Club was backed by a 
parade of supporters who spoke on its behalf. 
</P>
<P>
"We're proud of the class operation run by the Thoroughbred Club," said Brooke 
Eisenberg, Del Mar's deputy mayor. Eisenberg also expressed concern about 
Brunetti's inexperience working in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
"His ability to negotiate with labor in San Diego County is an unknown," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Brunetti wasn't without supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"All of you are concerned about an outsider coming in," said Raul Martinez, the 
mayor of Hialeah. "But I urge you to consider Mr. Brunetti not as a stranger 
but as a man who has a commitment to make the industry better, not just Hialeah 
or Del Mar." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Credited Brunetti 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, who said he attended the hearing voluntarily, credited Brunetti for 
turning around his city's once-failing race track. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Thoroughbred Club was ahead at the finish line, Brunetti, who 
promised to produce more revenue by holding more promotional events, adding 
races and luring top-flight thoroughbreds, appeared to be gaining momentum 
during the final months of the selection process. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt that we were a long shot, but I thought our chances were improving," 
Brunetti said. 
</P>
<P>
Brunetti said he knew from the start that he was fighting an uphill battle 
against a hometown favorite. The commission's decision to hold the hearings in 
Del Mar placed him at an even greater disadvantage, Brunetti added. 
</P>
<P>
"If this was held in Florida, I could have brought in the same amount of 
support," Brunetti said. "I think things may have been different if this took 
place in Sacramento. I believe it would have been a lot more objective." 
</P>
<P>
But Harper disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"The commission agreed months ago to hold the hearings here," Harper said. 
"Because it is a local issue, the community has to have its say."

HOUSING AUTHORITY PAINTING JOB IS THE PITS, MEMO SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A $2.9-million program under way at the Los Angeles City Housing Authority to 
repaint 13 low-income public housing projects is plagued by poor workmanship 
and management problems, an internal memo reveals. 
</P>
<P>
Painters hired by the Housing Authority on a temporary basis over the last two 
months have failed to scrape and prepare wood surfaces at several projects, 
according to the March 9 memo obtained by The Times. In some cases, labels were 
removed from paint containers to make it appear that primer was being applied, 
the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
The memo was written by Rudy Monterro, a maintenance supervisor at the Aliso 
Village housing project, who reported in the document that his complaints of 
shoddy work were "totally ignored" by Housing Authority managers. Monterro was 
assigned to lead a three-man Housing Authority inspection team that was 
disbanded Tuesday by Executive Director Leila Gonzalez-Correa. 
</P>
<P>
Monterro declined to comment on the memo or Gonzalez-Correa's action. 
</P>
<P>
The program, described by Housing Commissioner Arturo Fribourg as "one of the 
largest painting undertakings to go on in the city at one time," is among 
several renovation projects at the Housing Authority that have suffered from 
poor quality or lengthy delays. Earlier this month, The Times reported that an 
independent study criticized the Housing Authority for taking up to five years 
to spend millions of dollars in federal housing improvement funds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Peeling Paint 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a $342,000 paint job of Nickerson Gardens in Watts, the largest 
public housing project west of the Mississippi, is peeling on several buildings 
only months after the work was done, Fribourg said. The contractor, Circle N 
Inc., abandoned the project before applying the finishing touches and left the 
country, Housing Authority officials said. And a $6-million contract negotiated 
in February, 1987, to modernize 481 units at Mar Vista Gardens in Culver City 
is in jeopardy because the contractor, Dalton Construction Co., is in serious 
financial trouble, Housing Authority officials said Thursday. Of the 50 
buildings that were scheduled to be refurbished by last November, only 33 have 
been completed to date, records show. 
</P>
<P>
Several Housing Authority administrators said they could not comment on the 
agency's painting and construction woes because they are under orders to refer 
all inquiries to Gonzalez-Correa, who refused to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez-Correa, in fact, has asked the Housing Authority Board of 
Commissioners to formalize her no-comment policy. She requested that agency 
employees be prohibited from writing or speaking to commissioners, City Council 
members, government workers and reporters without her permission. But the 
proposed policy raises legal and constitutional questions involving an 
employee's First Amendment right to free speech, said Deputy City Atty. Dov 
Lesel. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez-Correa requested the communications ban a month ago after she and the 
agency became the subject of intensive publicity after disclosures that she had 
ignored federal regulations while awarding more than $200,000 in contracts to 
her friends and to political supporters of Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
Questions about the painting of the 13 housing projects began to surface in 
February when Monterro wrote a memo to Faustin Gonzalez, the agency's 
modernization director. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Housing Authority began hiring 98 painters and 14 carpenters 
from union halls and 42 tenants to assist in the painting project. The agency 
elected not to pay a painting contractor because housing officials "made a 
judgment they could do it cheaper and faster," said Gary Squier, the mayor's 
housing coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
The painting program received $2.7 million from the refinancing of Housing 
Authority property and $230,000 from U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development modernization funds. The price of paint materials was about 
$400,000 while labor and equipment account for the remaining $2.5 million. 
Records show that the 702 buildings are expected to be finished by the middle 
of next month. 
</P>
<P>
Monterro reported in his memo that painters were not preparing wood and priming 
only part of window frames and doors at Aliso Village, even though the project 
had not been painted since 1975. Monterro's inspection committee also found no 
scraping or priming work at Pico Gardens, no priming at San Fernando Gardens 
and only partial priming at Ramona Gardens, according to the memo. 
</P>
<P>
Labels had been ripped off paint containers at Aliso Village and Pico Gardens, 
the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
"On Thursday, March 6, 1989, I went to Pico Gardens at 8:30 a.m. and observed 
that the painters were setting up to spray an overhang, " Monterro wrote. "When 
I inquired as to whether or not primer or a finish coat was being applied, (the 
foreman) indicated that it was primer. When I asked why the labels had been 
removed from the cans, (the foreman) gave me a big story and insisted that it 
was primer. After I tested the material by sticking my fingers into it and 
smelling it, I told (the foreman) that he was not telling the truth, because 
the material was a finish material. He then admitted that it was a finish 
material and indicated that he was just following orders." 
</P>
<P>
Within the last week, Fribourg said, paint crews at Pico Gardens have been 
scraping wood around windows and doors. 
</P>
<P>
The paint program has suffered logistical problems as well. At San Fernando 
Gardens in Pacoima, for example, a rented hydraulic lift was delivered two 
weeks before the paint crew began working, said one Housing Authority official 
who asked not to be identified. When the painters arrived, the lift had been 
hauled away. 
</P>
<P>
In his memo, Monterro stated that Faustin Gonzalez had ignored Monterro's 
requests to discuss the paint program. Monterro also wrote that on March 3 he 
contacted Jorge Rosales, Gonzalez's assistant, to inform him of his findings. 
Rosales asked Monterro, "What are you, a spy?" according to Monterro's memo. 
</P>
<P>
Rosales and Faustin Gonzalez were appointed this week by Gonzalez-Correa as the 
only supervisors to inspect the paint program.

PROP. A OPPONENTS SET SIGHTS ON '87 TRANSPORTATION SALES TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Buoyed by their legal victory overturning a half-cent sales tax for San Diego 
jails and courtrooms, the political activists who won that case said Friday 
they are considering filing another lawsuit to try to strike down a similar 
1987 transportation sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
However, before broadening their legal horizons, the group indicated that it 
may first move to solidify Thursday's court ruling invalidating Proposition A, 
the jails measure narrowly approved by San Diego voters last June, by seeking a 
court order prohibiting the county from collecting the half-cent tax pending 
appeals. 
</P>
<P>
Emboldened by the ruling and with a bit of a swagger in their style, 
Proposition A's opponents held a downtown news conference Friday at which they 
both savored that victory -- one that, if upheld on appeal, poses far-reaching 
implications -- and suggested that they may attempt to replicate it through 
other lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
"This victory . . . refutes the old canard, 'You can't fight City Hall,' " said 
San Diego Libertarian Party Chairman Dick Rider, a plaintiffs in the case. "We 
did, and we won." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Declared Illegal 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Riverside County Superior Court Judge Gordon Burkhart declared the 
half-cent jails tax illegal on the grounds that its 50.6% approval at the polls 
fell short of Proposition 13's requirement of a two-thirds vote for approval of 
new taxes. Over its 10-year life, it is estimated that there would be about 
$1.6 billion for new jails and courtrooms to alleviate San Diego's longstanding 
jail crowding problem and a badly overextended court system. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition A and the state legislation authorizing it, Burkhart wrote in his 
decision, "purposely circumvented" the two-thirds margin mandated by 
Proposition 13, the landmark property-tax cutting initiative approved by voters 
statewide in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
That same legal argument perhaps could be applied, Rider said, to a similar 
half-cent sales tax for public transit, street improvements and highway 
construction that San Diego voters approved by a 53%-47% margin in November, 
1987. That measure -- which, ironically, also appeared on the ballot as 
Proposition A -- is expected to raise about $2.25 billion for street and mass 
transit programs over the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Both propositions relied upon "the same invalid subterfuge" to avoid the 
two-thirds vote requirement by creating elections in which only a majority vote 
was needed for approval, Rider and some of his fellow Libertarians argued 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We still question whether or not that first (transit) tax is valid," Rider 
said. "And we are seriously considering taking action against that tax. . . . 
We will be pursuing some sort of remedy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Fundamental Difference' 
</P>
<P>
However, even some of the seven defense lawyers who aligned themselves with the 
Libertarians in the lawsuit against the jails tax expressed doubts Friday about 
whether a similar case could be made against the transit sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
"There is at least one fundamental difference," lawyer Thomas Homann said. 
While Homann and his colleagues described the body set up to administer the 
jails tax revenue a "a shell, a pseudo-agency" that is little more than an arm 
of the county, he said he views a similar agency that oversees the transit 
funds as being "truly separate and independent." 
</P>
<P>
"The transportation agency was formed to perform a function which is not one 
that traditionally was performed by the county," Homann said. "In this (jails) 
case, what we have is a function which has traditionally, historically been 
performed by the county -- that is, the construction of jails and courthouses." 
</P>
<P>
If that factual distinction causes Homann to be skeptical about the feasibility 
of challenging the transit tax, officials of the San Diego County Regional 
Transportation Commission feel even more certain that they are on unassailable 
legal ground. 
</P>
<P>
"For a variety of reasons, we're convinced that the same challenge would not be 
successful if made against the Transportation Commission," said Debra 
Greenfield, general counsel of the 19-member panel that administers the transit 
sales-tax funds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Elected Membership 
</P>
<P>
Besides echoing Homann's observation that the transit board fulfills a function 
"not provided by any other local government," Greenfield noted that the board's 
membership, which includes elected representatives from the 18 local 
incorporated cities and the county Board of Supervisors, further demonstrates 
its "separate nature." 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, the state legislation that enabled the half-cent transit tax 
to be placed on the 1987 ballot established a six-month statute of limitations 
for challenging the measure. Because that period has expired, it is too late 
for a lawsuit similar to that which led to Thursday's ruling to be filed, 
Greenfield said. 
</P>
<P>
Libertarian leader Rider, however, suggested that a court might be persuaded to 
waive the statute of limitations if it could be proved that the transit tax was 
"patently unconstitutional." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't agree with that conclusion," Greenfield responded. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interest Conflict 
</P>
<P>
Although another lawsuit remains problematical, both sides in the jails' case 
continued Friday to attempt to sort out the short- and long-range ramifications 
of Burkhart's ruling. Burkhart heard the case in Riverside County because of 
San Diego judges' conflict of interest on a trial affecting courtroom space. 
</P>
<P>
With the case expected to eventually reach the California Supreme Court, the 
appeal could last as long as two years. As a result, a key unresolved question 
is whether collection of the tax must be halted in the interim or may continue 
pending the appellate decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Although Burkhart ruled Proposition A invalid, attorney Louis Katz, one of 
Homann's colleagues, conceded that "there's nothing in the judge's order to 
stop them from collecting the tax." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hope to Continue 
</P>
<P>
Several top county officials, in fact, have said they hope to continue 
collecting the half-cent tax, which has generated about $21 million since it 
raised the local sales tax to 7% on Jan. 1, until the state Supreme Court rules 
on the matter. If Thursday's ruling is upheld, the county would have to devise 
a method to equitably refund that money. 
</P>
<P>
"I see no reason to discontinue it now," Board of Supervisors Chairman Susan 
Golding said. "As far as I'm concerned, we don't even have a decision at this 
point. What we have is one step on the way to that decision." 
</P>
<P>
To clarify the sales tax's current status, Katz said that Proposition A's 
opponents may ask Burkhart to hold a hearing on the matter later this spring if 
his final order, expected to be signed in about one week, does not specifically 
address that question. Their position at any such hearing, Katz explained, 
would be that it is legally and politically illogical to continue levying a 
sales tax that a court has ruled unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm sure the county probably would feel differently," he said, chuckling. 
"We've still got a few more questions to answer about this decision before we 
even get to the appeals."

procession made its way methodically through the streets of the modest 
neighborhood known as the Colonia Postal, passing in front of the Manriquez 
garage and Montana market, past the signs for El Jalisciense goat-meat taco 
shop and the La Michoacana ice cream joint. 
</P>
<P>
"Perdona tu pueblo, Senor," was the chant repeated over and over again by those 
in front, mostly women, many donning long robes of a different era. "Forgive 
your people, Lord." "Forgive me, Lord." 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of the crowd, three youths dressed as Roman guards, their 
gold-tinged outfits crafted largely from cardboard, brandished their leather 
whips at a barefoot teen-ager carrying a cross and wearing a purple sash and 
crown of thorny vines. He was followed by two other "prisoners," shirtless and 
barefoot, representing two thieves. At one point, a robed man, Simon, burst 
through the crowd and carried the cross for its bearer. 
</P>
<P>
It was Viernes Santo (Holy Friday) in Mexico, where the Roman Catholic faith 
remains strong, despite an adamantly secular government that has severely 
circumscribed the church's role. 
</P>
<P>
In Tijuana, the church of San Felipe de Jesus organized the traditional "Via 
Crucis" (Stations of the Cross) pageant, commemorating the passion and 
crucifixion of Christ, one of history's great dramas. 
</P>
<P>
It is a form of religious theater repeated many times throughout the world on 
this day, one of the holiest on the church calendar. From South America to 
Asia, worshipers like those in the Colonia Postal annually reenact Christ's 
humiliation before authorities and his subsequent crucifixion. Some celebrants 
rehearse the spectacle for months, offering elaborate costumed tableaux. Others 
still practice flagellation during the ceremony, though church authorities 
frown on such practices. In the Philippines, venerators volunteer to have their 
hands nailed to the crosses. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony in Colonia Postal was comparatively modest. The Roman guards 
applied their whips gently, shouts and screams generally substituted adequately 
to illustrate their ire at the Christ figure. Painted-on blood served to make 
the point of a story familiar to all. The crucifixion was accomplished without 
nails; Christ was tied to the cross with ropes. The thieves were also tied to 
their crosses with ropes, as they were in Christ's day. 
</P>
<P>
On this day, the streets of this bustling border city moved at a different 
pace, a testament to the power of the religious holiday. Few businesses were 
open. Families donned their Sunday best and headed for churches and to the 
city's few parks, imparting an air of Mexico's interior to the fast-paced 
metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
The hundreds of supplicants participating in the procession marched slowly 
through the quiet streets of the Colonia Postal, chanting and stopping for 
readings at stations representing specific stages of Jesus' suffering. 
Residents came out of their houses to watch, respectfully; many made the sign 
of the cross. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the route, shortly after 3 p.m., the people gathered in a barren 
lot alongside the Church of San Felipe de Jesus, on a mesa overlooking much of 
downtown Tijuana. The crosses for Christ and the two thieves were placed 
between two junked cars, near the shade of some pepper trees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Greater Love' 
</P>
<P>
"There is no greater love," Father Roberto Simionato, an Italian-born 
missionary, told the assembled crowd, "than to give your life for those you 
love." 
</P>
<P>
After the ritual crucifixion, the mourners, including women dressed as Mary and 
Mary Magdalene, helped remove the body from the cross. Onlookers drifted away; 
many headed for church services. 
</P>
<P>
Hector Santana, the 14-year-old who played the Christ role, walking barefoot 
and bearing the cross through the city streets, was clearly moved by the 
experience. Said Santana, "I felt as He felt."

MAN ACCIDENTALLY SLAIN BY POLICEMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Gardena police officer accidentally shot and killed a 20-year-old man who 
apparently ran into the line of fire as the officer shot at an armed drug 
suspect during an early morning drug raid, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred when officers tried to serve arrest warrants on a group 
of suspects living at a Budlong Avenue apartment in Gardena, Police Sgt. John 
Moore said. As the officers entered the apartment, Moore said, one of the 
suspects, armed with a shotgun, ran out of a bedroom and aimed the weapon at an 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
"This other man came running down the hallway just as the officer fired and he 
intersected the line of fire and was hit," Moore said. The man with the shotgun 
then dropped the weapon. 
</P>
<P>
The dead man was identified as Dexter Herbert. 
</P>
<P>
Officers arrested eight people in the apartment on suspicion of narcotics sales 
and murder. They were not identified.

ACTOR TODD BRIDGES PLEADS INNOCENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actor Todd Bridges pleaded innocent Friday to charges that he tried to kill a 
narcotics dealer by shooting him eight times in a drug-induced fit of violence 
in a cocaine rock house. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges, 23, of Sun Valley, the former child star of the now-canceled NBC-TV 
sitcom "Diff'rent Strokes," denied a single count of premeditated attempted 
murder at his Superior Court arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Bridges could be sentenced to life in state prison. Judge David 
Horowitz ordered Bridges to remain in custody in lieu of $2-million bail but 
agreed to consider a defense motion April 14 to lower that bail. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges was ordered earlier this week to stand trial on the charge after 
convicted narcotics dealer Kenneth Clay testified at a preliminary hearing that 
the actor shot him eight times inside a South-Central Los Angeles cocaine rock 
house Feb. 2.

FIRE WARNING ISSUED ON INCINERATOR PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County fire officials have warned that the City of Commerce 
refuse-to-energy plant does not have an adequate firefighting system and that a 
recent blaze could have resulted in serious injury or damage. 
</P>
<P>
The warning was contained in a letter from county Assistant Fire Chief Michael 
D. Aviani to a City of Commerce official about a fire in the trash pit of the 
plant on March 7. There were no injuries and damage was limited to the 
facility's roof, but it took firefighters about five hours to put out the 
flames. The cause of the fire is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
The firefighting effort was slowed because the plant is not properly equipped 
with water cannons and the plant's automatic roof vents malfunctioned, Aviani 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The high-tech incinerator is run by the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts 
in conjunction with the City of Commerce. It is capable of burning 420 tons of 
non-hazardous garbage a day to provide electricity to about 20,000 homes.

2 HELD IN FARM WORKERS' SLAYINGS; RACISM HINTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Acknowledging an indication of racial overtones in the case, homicide 
detectives announced Friday the arrest of two San Diego teen-agers in 
connection with the slayings of two Latino farm workers who were fatally shot 
Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police have arrested a 17-year-old youth from Mira Mesa and Dennis 
Bencivenga, 19, of Rancho Bernardo, on suspicion of murder in the deaths of 
Hilario Salgado and Matilde de la Sancha, both 18, who were found dead along 
the 7800 block of Black Mountain Road. 
</P>
<P>
Bencivenga was arrested at his home Friday. The unnamed youth was arrested 
Thursday at Ft. Benning, Ga., where he was undergoing advanced training in the 
Army. The youth remained in jail Friday in Georgia, police said. Bencivenga was 
in County Jail Friday in lieu of $1 million bail. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide Sgt. Frank Martinez said an investigation that has continued since the 
night of the slayings recently culminated in the arrests of the two teen-agers. 
Some of the acquaintances of the suspects whom investigators interviewed told 
police that the two had bragged about the killings, Martinez said. Police 
declined to say why they believe that the attack may have been racially 
motivated. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said police believe the youths may have intended to rob the victims, 
but that nothing was taken from them. Witnesses arrived immediately after the 
shots had been fired about 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Police estimate the truck was about 10 feet away when the victims, walking 
along the road, were shot "several times each" by a high-powered, .223-caliber 
semiautomatic assault rifle. Police declined to say which of the suspects is 
believed to have done the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
None of the witnesses who aided police in the inquiry actually saw the 
shootings, Martinez said, adding that people near the scene did not hear the 
assailants say anything before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
The victims, who had temporary work permits and were applicants for amnesty, 
were on their way to Rancho Penasquitos when they were shot, Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
The case has been handed over to the district attorney's office and, based on 
witnesses' statements, the death penalty may be considered for the suspects, 
who were both employed and "came from pretty good families," Martinez said.

BRADLEY RETURNS $18,000 HE EARNED AS ADVISER TO BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley on Friday said he returned $18,000 he had earned last year as 
an adviser to Far East National Bank after discovering that the small downtown 
bank had received deposits from the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to bank Chairman Henry Hwang made public Friday, Bradley said: 
"While I am not legally compelled to return any monies earned as a member of 
your advisory committee . . . I am voluntarily and immediately returning to 
FENB the entire sum." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said he was unaware that the bank had sought and received city deposits 
until Tuesday. Deputy Mayor Mike Gage said Bradley first learned of the 
deposits when Hwang called Bradley regarding a city certificate of deposit that 
was maturing. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear how much money the city had on deposit with the 
bank, and Bradley said he has "no responsibility for city investment or deposit 
decisions, and I am not routinely informed of the particular investment or 
deposits decision made by the (city) treasurer." 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Friday, the mayor's office said Bradley "could not keep 
-- and never would have accepted -- any funds earned during the period of his 
advisory relationship with the bank" had he known about the city deposits. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor had included the income on his annual statement of economic interest 
and has now amended that filing to show the return of the funds, a spokesman 
said. Bradley resigned from the FENB advisory committee as of Dec. 31, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley continues to serve as a director of Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan 
Assn. The mayor's office said Valley Federal does not accept city deposits.

VICTIM OF VIRUS TAKES HEART AS HE WAITS FOR ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY BEAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until last summer, Raymond Smallcomb's life style was like that of many young 
Southern Californians who live near the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
When not taking classes at a community college, Smallcomb, 22, surfed and 
played two-man volleyball under the sunshine at Newport Beach, near his 
family's home in Costa Mesa, as yet not touched by the tragedy that had felled 
so many members of his family. 
</P>
<P>
For, although his mother and a sister died of an unknown virus that attacks the 
heart, Smallcomb appeared to be living a normal life, unaffected by the malady. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the guy who would take the largest wave and could get out of it no 
matter what," said his father, Thomas Smallcomb. 
</P>
<P>
With his son now facing a challenge more formidable than any wave he ever 
conquered, Smallcomb hopes that his son once again will find a way to "get out 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Waiting for a Heart 
</P>
<P>
As the same virus that claimed the life of his mother, sister and seven other 
blood relatives threatens now to take his own life, the younger Smallcomb waits 
for a new heart at a San Diego hospital, attached to a device that acts as an 
artificial one outside of his body, providing oxygen to his blood and pumping 
it through his body. 
</P>
<P>
Each day as he waits, doctors say the situation can worsen as the odds for 
complications and infection increase. 
</P>
<P>
The signal that something was wrong came last summer, when his shortness of 
breath and general weakness provided the first signs that the same virus that 
has so devastatingly plagued his family had struck him, withering the left side 
of his once-healthy heart. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Smallcomb was brought to Sharp Memorial Hospital so his kidneys, 
pancreas and partly collapsed lung could be strengthened with the help of a 
machine called the acute ventricular assist device (AVAD). 
</P>
<P>
Because there is no AVAD in Los Angeles County, Smallcomb was brought here in 
the hope that the equipment will provide more time for doctors to search for 
the needed heart. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp Hospital, the only one in San Diego that performs the operation, has done 
transplants on 46 patients since 1983, Judy Coburn, Sharp's transplant 
coordinator, said. 
</P>
<P>
Smallcomb is first on the list of 10 people waiting for heart transplants here, 
but a recent shortage of donors has made the need even more critical, Sharp 
officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First on the List 
</P>
<P>
Most patients on the list for donated hearts are not expected to live more than 
a few months. Because Smallcomb is the only patient on mechanical life support, 
he is scheduled to be the next recipient of a heart from a type O blood heart 
donor. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the college student, whose 6-foot-4-inch frame now only holds 
120 pounds -- 60 pounds less than he once weighed -- passes his time visiting 
with his family and talking with nurses. When his family can't be with him, he 
watches videos of his nine brothers and sisters and their grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
A visit Friday with his father, stepmother and younger sister on his 42nd day 
on the machine was much like previous ones. 
</P>
<P>
Although, his stepmother, Amy, said, the past six weeks have tempered Raymond's 
outlook on life, she added that the wait for a donor has tested the entire 
family's faith and confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never forget a few weeks ago I said to him, 'What's going on in your 
head?' as he looked straight ahead, and he said, 'I don't know if I'm going to 
make it,' " she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Tears came frequently to his eyes during the early visits, she said, but since 
then doctors have told the family that Raymond may now be pulling out of a deep 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen tears in the last two weeks," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the machine has pumped oxygen-rich blood back into his failing organs, 
bringing them back up to strength, he remains isolated in intensive care, 
connected to the machine by an 8-foot line that acts, in his stepmother's 
words, "like an umbilical cord." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the family's ordeal nearly ended when a heart from a 17-year-old 
with type O blood became available after the youth was killed in a drive-by 
shooting in Southeast San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Made Us More Aware' 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Smallcomb rushed down to the hospital after midnight last Saturday to 
meet with doctors. But at 4 a.m., doctors told him that the potential 
replacement heart could not be stabilized, explaining that it had stopped 
beating as they attempted to transport it to the hospital for possible 
transplantation. 
</P>
<P>
But that incident -- and two others in which families of other potential donors 
asked doctors not to go through with the organ donation wishes of their dying 
relatives -- has not undermined the family's hope that a heart eventually will 
become available. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's made us more aware," said Thomas Smallcomb, whose entire family 
now has organ donor cards attached to their driver licenses. "We would hope 
that our family would be a recipient of a heart just like any other family, and 
we know that others after us will need them. We will be available to help 
others who come forward after us in any way we can." 
</P>
<P>
"Every day, you wake up thinking it is going to be the day," Amy added, 
referring to the uncertainty of the wait for a heart or the possibility of her 
stepson's death. 
</P>
<P>
"It could go either way."

MINKOW ADDICTED TO MONEY, DEFENSE LAWYER TELLS COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Barry Minkow was a "compulsive debtor" who had an uncontrollable need for 
millions of dollars the way a drug addict needs a fix, his defense lawyer said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In a report filed for his sentencing Monday on 57 fraud counts stemming from 
the 1987 collapse of his ZZZZ Best carpet-cleaning company, lawyers for Minkow 
recanted the young entrepreneur's defense that the mob forced him into 
committing the fraud and said Minkow was the victim of an unhappy childhood. 
</P>
<P>
"The true story of ZZZZ Best is of a young man almost constantly in debt, 
struggling to prove that he will not become the failure depicted by his 
father," attorney David E. Kenner said in his report. 
</P>
<P>
"In Barry Minkow's case, the hoped for 'Big Fix' was the infusion of new funds 
-- funds that he could only obtain through activities that caused his 
prosecution. Consequently, the appropriate way to see the defendant is as 
someone akin to . . . a drug addict, chronic alcoholic, compulsive gambler or 
over-eater. Each is a form of compulsive, addictive behavior, against which the 
person has lost control." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stiff Sentence Sought 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors in their own sentencing report called Minkow "one of the most 
significant white-collar criminals ever prosecuted on the West Coast" and said 
they will seek a sentence of at least 25 years in prison and $26 million in 
restitution. 
</P>
<P>
"During his five-year crime wave . . . Minkow carried out what, in effect, 
amounted to a search-and-destroy mission aimed at the trust and integrity of 
our financial institutions, securities markets and the public at large," 
prosecutors James R. Asperger and Gordon A. Greenberg said in their report. 
</P>
<P>
The defense report recommended a sentence of from eight to 10 years and 
psychological counseling. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian, who will sentence Minkow, has already 
imposed prison sentences ranging from a month to eight years for the other 10 
defendants in the case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mafia Claim 
</P>
<P>
Minkow, 23, was the only one who went to trial, contending throughout that he 
was forced into fraudulently obtaining millions of dollars from banks and 
private investors for ZZZZ Best by a series of organized-crime figures who had 
infiltrated the company. Testimony in the case showed that the company's books 
were padded by listing millions of dollars in revenue from insurance 
restoration jobs -- supposedly repairing fire and flood damage to high-rise 
buildings -- that were entirely fabricated. 
</P>
<P>
Kenner said in an interview Friday that Minkow still alleges that a variety of 
reputed Mafia figures helped him set up the fraud and, at least at first, 
caused the young businessman to worry about not paying back his debts to them. 
</P>
<P>
But Minkow "is aware that the events that he experienced in connection with 
ZZZZ Best do not necessarily amount to the legal defense of duress," Kenner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"A better explanation" for the role the mob figures played, however, is 
"probably . . . a carrot-and-stick approach," Kenner said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think probably Barry enjoyed the money, enjoyed the publicity, and I think 
that it became very easy for Barry to rationalize the life style and to 
continue to do what he was doing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In his report, Kenner portrayed Minkow as the victim of a troubled childhood. 
Minkow was continually berated by his father for his lack of athletic ability 
and often played with his sisters' friends, because he had no playmates his own 
age, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
His hyperactivity caused him problems in school, where Minkow had "an 
uncontrollable need" to be the center of attention, according to a 
psychologist's evaluation quoted in the defense report. 
</P>
<P>
"He learned how to lie in the fifth through eighth grades when his father 
insisted that no tales be told out of the house about his mother's 
disturbances, his father's unemployment or why the gas (at his home) was turned 
off" when the family could not pay the bill, psychologist Paula Smith-Marder 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
As a teen-ager, the defense said, Minkow loaned others money at usurious 
interest rates, passed bad checks and later fell under the influence in his 
business of reputed organized-crime figures, such as the late Jack Catain and 
"stock fraud artist" Maurice Rind, who has been named by authorities as a 
suspect in the ZZZZ Best case but has not been charged. 
</P>
<P>
"In this atmosphere, it is difficult not to discern that Minkow was subject to 
some form of intimidation, if not direct threats on his life," Kenner wrote. 
</P>
<P>
But the prosecution said Minkow's lies about Mafia manipulation during his 
nearly two weeks of testimony "are unparalleled in this courthouse." 
</P>
<P>
"Now that it is in his self-interest (after the jury expressed its total 
disbelief in his story) . . . Minkow conveniently admits in his pre-sentence 
report that he 'lied under oath during his trial.' He attempts to excuse these 
lies by claiming that this was 'the old Barry,' who needs constant approval and 
attention from others," the prosecution said, quoting from a U.S. Probation 
Department evaluation of Minkow. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that. . . Minkow's newly discovered remorse and religion should be 
viewed with a strong and healthy sense of skepticism," prosecutors said.

INTENSE SEARCH FAILS TO LOCATE MISSING GIRL, 7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 7-year-old Newhall girl who disappeared Thursday afternoon was still missing 
early Friday evening, despite efforts by sheriff's deputies who searched for 
her on foot, horseback and in helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
Sara Nan Hodges, a blond, blue-eyed first grader, was last seen about 2 p.m. 
Thursday with a group of neighborhood children in the front yard of her Newhall 
house, officials said. The family reported the girl missing at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
After interviewing neighbors and the children she was playing with, deputies 
used bloodhounds and a helicopter to search for the girl in the rough, brushy, 
wilderness area across the street from her Alderbrook Drive house. 
</P>
<P>
At daybreak, the search was expanded to include more than 80 officers, 
including a mounted posse and dozens of deputies on foot, who covered a 
2-square-mile area. 
</P>
<P>
Expectations were raised briefly about 3:30 p.m. Friday when authorities, 
acting on a phone tip, stopped a black Cadillac in which a child matching 
Sara's description was a passenger. But family members said it was not her. 
</P>
<P>
The ground search of the wilderness area was called off about 5 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fruitless," Sheriff's Sgt. Frank Kasco said. "We have had more than 74 
people out there all day, bloodhounds and helicopters, and she is just not 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Kasco said officers will continue to search the surrounding residential 
neighborhood and follow up on any tips. However, Lt. Dennis Burns said they had 
few other leads to follow. 
</P>
<P>
"Any place a 7-year-old would go, we have been. Friends, relatives, abandoned 
cars. . . . Somebody either picked her up or she wandered off," Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parents Are Divorced 
</P>
<P>
The parents of the missing girl are divorced but authorities do not believe 
that the girl was kidnaped by her father, who lives in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Burns said the father, Wallace Scott Mann, first learned that his daughter was 
missing when law enforcement officials, who thought she might be at his house, 
called him. Since then, he has been eager to help, Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
Sara's mother, sister and other relatives stayed inside their house most of 
Friday afternoon.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: EL CAJON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An El Cajon man convicted of killing a 2-year-old girl was sentenced Friday to 
25 years to life in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Matthew LeSure, 29, was convicted Feb. 24 of first-degree murder in the June 
13, 1988, slaying of Sara Toussant, whose beaten body was found in a trash bin 
near the apartment where the girl lived with her mother and LeSure, her 
mother's boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Terry O'Rourke added five years to LeSure's sentence 
because LeSure was convicted of robbery in 1982. O'Rourke recommended that 
LeSure never be granted parole. A parole board could release him after 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The dead girl's mother, Katherine Minnifield, told the judge at the sentencing 
that she would vigorously oppose LeSure's release even after 15 or 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he should have gotten the chair," Minnifield said after the hearing. 
During the hearing, she said, "Matthew LeSure has murdered my little Sara. He 
has caused me unbearable pain." 
</P>
<P>
The girl's natural father, Jeffrey Toussant, a sailor stationed in San 
Francisco, also appeared at the sentencing. "I think he should have gotten 
life," he said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
LeSure told police he and the girl went to a park, and he fell asleep, 
discovering when he awoke that Sara was gone. The girl's body was found the 
next day by someone looking for cans in a trash bin. An autopsy showed that she 
had been beaten, although she was still apparently alive when LeSure put her in 
a plastic bag and left her.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: LA JOLLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman accused of shooting a worshiper in the back at a church was committed 
to a state mental hospital Friday after a judge declared she was mentally 
incompetent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Perrellis, 41, a transient, is charged with shooting Michelle 
Gallagher, 40, a La Jolla real estate agent, at the Mary Star of the Sea 
Catholic Church in La Jolla on March 2. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Superior Court Judge Charles Hayes ruled that Perrellis is mentally 
incompetent to stand trial. He relied on the opinion of court-appointed 
psychiatrists. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Bill Collins said Perrellis must prove she has regained her 
competency before she can be released from Patton State Hospital and put on 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty clear by the reports that she's not competent," said Collins. 
</P>
<P>
Perrellis talked in gibberish and could not understand what her attorney was 
trying to tell her, said Collins. 
</P>
<P>
Gallagher told police she was in the church foyer when a woman approached her 
and asked where the confessional was. Gallagher said she was walking out of the 
church when the woman fired a single shot at her from a small-caliber 
derringer. 
</P>
<P>
Perrellis faces a second attempted-murder charge stemming from another incident 
the same day, several blocks away, in which Colette Cholaki, 24, of La Mesa, 
said Perrellis pointed a gun at her in a parking lot. The gun misfired. 
</P>
<P>
A Municipal Court judge ordered that Perrellis be examined by psychiatrists 
March 9, after she staged several outbursts in court.

JUDGE FASHIONS PLAN TO RESOLVE CAT LADY FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opera wasn't over until the Cat Lady sang. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a Newhall Municipal Court judge fashioned a plan to end a two-year 
legal squabble between the Los Angeles County Department of Animal Control and 
Elizabeth Kurrus, a 66-year-old schoolteacher from Newhall who spent two days 
in jail after she refused to cooperate with authorities in January. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute involved allegations that Kurrus kept a dozen cats in unsanitary 
conditions at a mobile home in Placerita Canyon. Animal-control officers had 
complained since 1987 that Kurrus' mobile home was cluttered inside and out 
with boxes, trash bags, cat feces and debris. Kurrus countered that her coach 
was messy but not dirty. 
</P>
<P>
Kurrus, an English teacher at Placerita Canyon Junior High School, was 
convicted on two misdemeanor charges of keeping animals in unsanitary 
conditions on June 27 and placed on two years probation. 
</P>
<P>
Judge H. Keith Byram ordered her to get rid of all but two cats, to cooperate 
with authorities and to clean up the mess. He also told her to neuter the two 
remaining animals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Handcuffed and Jailed 
</P>
<P>
When Kurrus refused to let animal-control officers inspect her property in 
January, Byram had her handcuffed and taken to the Sybil Brand Institute for 
Women. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Deputy Dist. Atty. Bernadette de Barajas charged that Kurrus had 
still not cleaned up the property. John Land, manager of the mobile home park, 
said a strong odor of stale urine permeated the area around Kurrus' home. 
</P>
<P>
But Kurrus' daughter and two friends testified that the mobile home was now 
clean, although still cluttered. Even Kurrus, comparing her home to how it was 
a few months ago, said: "I believe it was unsanitary and messy; now it's 
unorganized." 
</P>
<P>
Byram, who had joked and smiled throughout the hearing, said he believed that 
the coach was indeed clean and sanitary. 
</P>
<P>
But his mood changed when Kurrus invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to say 
whether her two remaining cats had been neutered. 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Kurrus, I appreciate your fierce independence in this case," Byram said. 
"I have no desire to put you in jail." But, he said, a court order must be 
obeyed. 
</P>
<P>
Kurrus finally admitted that the cats haven't been neutered because they are 
wild and can't be caught. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the judge offered a solution: Animal-control officers will trap the 
cats and let Kurrus deliver them to a new home. Kurrus will remain on probation 
and will have to cooperate with animal-control officers in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to cooperate," Byram said. "You can't shut the door on their faces as 
you've done in the past." He added that she is still free to get two new cats 
as long as they are neutered.

EXTENSIVE SEARCH FINDS NO TRACE OF NEWHALL GIRL, 7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 7-year-old Newhall girl who disappeared Thursday afternoon was still missing 
Friday evening despite efforts by Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies who 
searched for her on foot, horseback and in helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
Sara Nan Hodges, a blonde, blue-eyed first-grader, was last seen about 2 p.m. 
with a group of neighborhood children in the front yard of her home, deputies 
said. The family reported the girl missing at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
After interviewing neighbors and the children she was playing with Thursday 
night, deputies used bloodhounds and a helicopter to search for the girl in the 
rough, brushy area across the street from her Alderbrook Drive home. 
</P>
<P>
At daybreak, the search was expanded to include more than 80 officers, 
including a mounted posse and dozens of deputies on foot who covered a 
two-square-mile area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
False Lead 
</P>
<P>
Expectations were raised briefly about 3:30 p.m. Friday when authorities acting 
on a phone tip stopped a car on the Antelope Valley Freeway in which a child 
matching Sara's description was a passenger. But family members said it was not 
Sara. 
</P>
<P>
The ground search was called off about 5 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fruitless," said Sgt. Frank Kasco. "We have had more than 74 people out 
there all day, bloodhounds and helicopters, and she is just not there." 
</P>
<P>
Kasco said officers would continue to search the surrounding residential 
neighborhood and follow up on any tips. However, Lt. Dennis Burns said they had 
few other leads. 
</P>
<P>
"All the kids went off their different ways. Everybody remembers she was there, 
but nobody knows what she did next," he said. "Any place a 7-year-old would go 
we have been. Friends, relatives, abandoned cars . . . somebody either picked 
her up or she wandered off." 
</P>
<P>
Family members fear that Sara has been kidnaped because they said she never 
goes anywhere without asking permission first. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Always Careful 
</P>
<P>
"This is extremely unlike her," said her sister Tisha, 16. "Before she goes 
anywhere, she asks and she never leaves this block. We always know exactly 
where she is. She comes in before it gets dark and that's why we got worried 
when it started getting dark. 
</P>
<P>
"We want her home," Tisha said. 
</P>
<P>
Sara's parents are divorced, but authorities said they do not believe that the 
girl was taken by her father, who lives in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Burns said Sara's father, Wallace Scott Mann, first learned that she was 
missing when law enforcement officials, who thought that she might be at his 
house, searched it. Since then, he has been eager to help, Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
Sara is about 4 feet tall and weighs about 80 pounds. She was wearing blue 
jeans, a pink and blue T-shirt, and tennis shoes at the time she disappeared.

<P>
In his second robbery in a week, a man whom police have dubbed the 
"Walk-to-the-Back Bandit" robbed a pet supply store Thursday night of about 
$900, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The bandit is believed to be involved in as many as 4 dozen holdups in San 
Diego County since Dec. 11, police spokesman Bill Robinson said. He usually 
selects a business in which a woman is working alone, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As in past robberies, the bandit Thursday walked into the Petco Animal Supplies 
store in the 9000 block of Mira Mesa Boulevard at about 7:30 p.m. He approached 
a woman clerk, displayed a handgun in his waistband and demanded money, 
Robinson said. Once he had the money, he told her to go to the back of the 
store and fled on foot. 
</P>
<P>
The bandit, who robbed the Lubey Beauty and Barber Supply store in San Diego on 
March 17 for less than $100, has hit small businesses in East San Diego, La 
Mesa, North City West and El Cajon, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The bandit was described as being in his mid-30s, 5-foot-7, with brown hair and 
a tan complexion. He was wearing sunglasses, a blue baseball hat, a blue jacket 
and blue jeans during Thursday's robbery, police said.

MAN ROBS ARMORED CAR GUARD AT MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lone armed robber took an undisclosed amount of cash from an armored car 
guard Friday morning at a crowded supermarket on Ventura Boulevard in Encino, 
Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
No shots were fired and no one was hurt in the incident, which occurred shortly 
after 10 a.m. inside a Ralphs grocery, Lt. Bob Ruchhoft said. 
</P>
<P>
A Brink's guard was about to leave the crowded store with a bag of cash when he 
was confronted by the gunman, who apparently had been waiting inside, Ruchhoft 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The robber also took the guard's gun before running to a small, white car in 
the parking lot and speeding off, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The robbery does not appear to be related to a string of armored-car robberies 
that have resulted in several arrests and the deaths of three guards in the 
past year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI is assisting the Los Angeles Police Department in the case, he said.

SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; 
</P>
<P>
42 EUCALYPTUS TREES MUST BE REMOVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has voted to remove 42 eucalyptus trees infested with the 
Australian eucalyptus beetle borer, an insect that drains sap through holes in 
the trees' bark. 
</P>
<P>
The trees have lined Jean Lacouague's 5-acre property on San Juan Creek Road 
since he planted them in 1939 to help protect citrus and walnut trees on his 
family ranch, the San Juan Capistrano native said. But the insects have 
destroyed the trees beyond salvage and they must be taken down. 
</P>
<P>
Lacouague wanted to remove the trees in 1987 because their disease posed a 
costly liability when branches fell onto San Juan Creek Road during storms. In 
order to preserve the trees, the city agreed that year to be responsible for 
those costs. 
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday, the council unanimously agreed to remove the trees, end the 
2-year-old agreement, and reimburse Lacouague for up to $1,000 in personal 
legal fees that he has incurred to have the trees removed. 
</P>
<P>
Lacouague said he will replace the trees with 41 California live oaks, 65 
Canary Island pines, and 50 oleanders along his property.

MCCOLL DUMP SOIL TO BE BURNED IN TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN and STEVEN R. CHURM, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a significant step toward eventual cleanup of Fullerton's McColl dump, a 
long-awaited test burn of hazardous wastes and contaminated soil from the 
abandoned dump will begin Monday in an experimental La Jolla incinerator. 
</P>
<P>
A plan by Ogden Environmental Services to incinerate 30 barrels of contaminated 
soil, refinery waste and oil-drilling muds from the McColl dump overcame its 
final regulatory obstacle Thursday, when the San Diego County Air Pollution 
Control District issued final approval for the test burn. 
</P>
<P>
And on Friday, the city of San Diego and a community group decided not to seek 
a court order to halt the start-up of the controversial incinerator atop Torrey 
Pines Mesa, where residents and businessmen had opposed the plan over health 
and safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Ogden plans to begin heating up the incinerator Monday morning, but it will 
probably not reach the 1,425-degree temperature necessary to handle the waste 
until early Tuesday morning, said Joe Charest, a publicist for the company. He 
said that the test burn is scheduled to end Thursday but that results from the 
experiment will take several weeks to analyze. 
</P>
<P>
McColl's acidic sludge, which contains 32 compounds, including 18 suspected 
carcinogens, will be fed into Ogden's 1,425-degree incinerator for 8 to 12 
hours each day in an effort to demonstrate that the process effectively 
destroys the hazardous waste and does not pose a health or safety threat to 
surrounding development. 
</P>
<P>
The Ogden test is the first of at least three demonstration burns of samples of 
the wastes at McColl, including one scheduled at the dump in the foothills of 
western Fullerton this summer. 
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the best way to dispose 
of the 150,000 tons of refinery waste and oil-drilling muds buried at the World 
War II-era dump is to excavate and burn the hazardous materials on site. State 
and local officials support the plan. But a coalition of five oil companies, 
which the EPA contends are responsible for the cleanup of the dump, opposes 
incineration, favoring its own plan to "cap" the sludge in the ground. 
</P>
<P>
A final decision by the EPA to proceed with incineration is not expected until 
August, and it may hinge on the results from the test burns, including the one 
at Ogden. Experts will monitor the level of emissions from the Ogden 
incinerator's exhaust stack, as well as the toxicity of ash residue left behind 
when the hazardous wastes are burned. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, San Diego city attorneys briefly contemplated a last-ditch effort to 
block the experiment, but abandoned the plan because they lacked the time or 
any obvious reason for filing suit. 
</P>
<P>
"In looking at it, we can't see anything that can be done on this short 
notice," said Assistant City Atty. Ronald Johnson. "We can't find a basis for 
it on a real quick and dirty look." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said that Mayor Maureen O'Connor, City Manager John Lockwood, and City 
Atty. John Witt have emergency powers under provisions of the City Charter but 
that they cannot be exercised to stop the test burn, which has been reviewed 
and approved by federal, state and local regulatory agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys will continue reviewing the matter over the weekend but currently 
intend to brief the San Diego City Council on the experiment at the next 
scheduled council meeting April 3.e 
</P>
<P>
Opponents have for years worked to stop the burn because Ogden's site in the GA 
Technologies Research Park is near heavily populated facilities, including UC 
San Diego, three hospitals, a child care center, residential tracts, the Torrey 
Pines State Reserve and the Torrey Pines Inn.

MIDWIFE'S NURSING LICENSE REVOKED FOR NEGLIGENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCILLE RENWICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state board has revoked the nursing license of a midwife accused of 
negligence in two stillbirths, including one by a San Clemente woman after 
almost 24 hours of labor. 
</P>
<P>
After a 5-week hearing in San Diego, Administrative Law Judge Ronald M. Gruen 
on Thursday found Abigail Odam, 45, of Del Mar to be "grossly negligent and 
incompetent" and recommended the revocation of her license effective today. The 
state Board of Registered Nursing agreed with Gruen's decision and revoked the 
license. 
</P>
<P>
Odam, who was a licensed registered nurse, practiced midwifery for about 3 
years, mostly in San Diego County, her attorney said. She had never received 
her certification as a midwife, but had been working toward it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Atty. Gen. Melanie J. Muckle said the nursing board received numerous 
complaints about Odam, but the most serious came from Darlene Caughey, 38, of 
San Clemente, whose son was stillborn in February. Odam also had been blamed 
for the stillbirth of a child in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Five Women Testified 
</P>
<P>
Five women testified against Odam about their experiences, but much of the case 
rested on Caughey's testimony about the stillbirth of her child which, she 
said, could have been prevented had Odam not ignored signs that her baby was in 
distress during delivery. 
</P>
<P>
"During the whole labor process I was led to believe that everything was just 
fine," Caughey said Friday. "Even when I told her (Odam) about the problems I 
was having during the labor I was told that I was worrying too much." 
</P>
<P>
According to a suit filed August, 1988, by the state attorney general, Caughey 
called Odam to her home in February after she began experiencing labor pains. 
Odam stayed with Caughey for several hours before leaving for another delivery. 
The next day, as the labor pains persisted, Odam was called, but told Caughey 
not to worry and said she would be over after she delivered another baby. When 
Odam arrived she tried unsuccessfully to deliver the baby. Paramedics took 
Caughey to San Clemente General Hospital, where a doctor performed a Cesarean 
operation and delivered the stillborn child. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also stated that Odam should have known that Caughey, who had a 
Cesarean birth in 1984, was not able to have a normal birth in her home. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very hard to talk about the death of a child, and he really didn't need 
to die," Caughey said. "I'm glad that the state and the registered nurses' 
board found her grossly negligent." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Filed Civil Suit 
</P>
<P>
Caughey and her husband, Timothy, filed a civil suit against Odam last November 
for monetary damages. A trial date has not been set and the case is still in 
the preliminary stages, said Odam's attorney, Steven Keller. Caughey would not 
comment on that suit. 
</P>
<P>
Keller said although he disagrees with the judge's decision, he will not appeal 
the case. Odam, he said, will have the opportunity to reapply for a nursing 
license next year. 
</P>
<P>
"What I think Abby is going to do here is pursue further education (for her 
certification) and seek a new license within a year," he said. "And I would 
assume that the board would grant her a new license at some point, but they'd 
make sure there were some conditions added to it. " 
</P>
<P>
Odam could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Violated Order 
</P>
<P>
Muckle sought a temporary restraining order against Odam last October, 
requiring that she be supervised by a licensed doctor or certified nurse or 
midwife. In November, 1988, Odam violated the order by delivering a baby 
without supervision, Muckle said. The court then modified the first restraining 
order, stating that Odam could no longer practice as a registered nurse outside 
a licensed hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"She went and hung out her shingle as a midwife, based on what she said were 
legal standardized procedures," Muckle said of Odam. 
</P>
<P>
"Abby was just an RN (registered nurse). She didn't have the additional" 
certification, Muckle added. "She was trying to get it, but was practicing 
before she got it. Basically she was trying to gain the experience on her own 
instead of getting the proper training. And she was essentially cheating these 
women out of proper care." 
</P>
<P>
But Keller said Odam was practicing under written, medical procedures. 
</P>
<P>
The judge hearing the suit sidestepped the question of whether Odam was 
practicing midwifery illegally, and ruled on the question of gross negligence.

GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI: BICHETTE WORKS HIMSELF HARD FOR ONE-WAY TICKET TO MAJORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

PALM SPRINGS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 26 glorious days last September, outfielder Dante Bichette was an Angel. He 
appeared in 21 games, hit .261, scored one run, had eight runs batted in and 
struck out seven times. Like any rookie, he remembers each delicious 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
He also remembers Edmonton, his minor league home for the last two seasons. And 
Midland and Palm Springs. And Quad City and Salem before that. If nothing else, 
five years in the Angel farm system has taught Bichette one thing: He doesn't 
want to go back. Ever. 
</P>
<P>
That explains why Bichette took the extra money he earned in September as a 
major leaguer and re-invested it in the one commodity he knows best -- himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm shooting for the long run," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bichette bought a pitching machine. Then he went out and purchased a soft toss 
machine, a gizmo that lightly tosses baseballs your way. And to record it all, 
Bichette splurged and got himself a video camera. 
</P>
<P>
Some players buy Porches; Bichette buys business aids. 
</P>
<P>
"A big car right now wouldn't do me much good," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He started lifting weights, using resident Angel he-man Brian Downing as his 
model and mentor. Before, Bichette didn't know a tricep from Trident gum. He 
thought a latissimus dorsi was a fish. Now look at him: His shoulders are as 
wide as a car hood. 
</P>
<P>
Bichette arrived at spring training tuned and toned. His swing needed some 
work, what with all the lunging Bichette does, but Angel hitting instructor 
Deron Johnson took care of that. 
</P>
<P>
The results? Along with pitcher Jim Abbott, Bichette has become the people's 
choice to earn a place on the team's 24-man roster. Underdogs have a way of 
doing that to a crowd. Wally Joyner receives polite, appreciative applause when 
he steps to the plate. Bichette and his .345 average and team-leading four home 
runs get cheers. 
</P>
<P>
"They want me to be up (in the big leagues)," he said. "They think well of me. 
It's really nice to hear that, especially from the fans." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Bichette has done everything except furnish the clubhouse lunch spread 
this spring. He has hit for power and average. He has stolen a few bases, 
knocked in 14 runs in only 55 at-bats. He has played well in the outfield. In 
the process, Bichette has made life difficult for Angel Manager Doug Rader. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was this: Bichette would attend camp, have his swing refined, probably 
struggle as he learned the new mechanics of it all, receive an occasional start 
in the lineup, then be dispatched to Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
"They were thinking I probably wasn't ready for the big leagues," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Bichette understood exactly what Johnson was trying to do, and proved 
it with this impressive spring performance. Even his outs -- line drives to 
straight center field, towering fly balls to the outer reaches of the warning 
tracks -- are fun to watch. 
</P>
<P>
"The last two times I came (to camp), I knew I wasn't going to play a lot," 
Bichette said. "I knew I wasn't even going to be considered for a job. This 
year, I wanted to show them I can play." 
</P>
<P>
Bichette can play, all right. But where? 
</P>
<P>
The Angels didn't sign former Yankee outfielder Claudell Washington to that 
multiyear, multimillion dollar contract so he could recommend nice restaurants 
when the team traveled to New York. Devon White will be the Angel center 
fielder for the rest of this decade -- at least. Chili Davis isn't going to be 
replaced, not as long as he keeps churning out those 20-plus home runs and 
90-plus RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Which leaves Bichette competing with veteran Tony Armas for the fourth 
outfielder spot. You might like Bichette's chances if spring statistics were 
the lone factor. Armas hasn't hit Twiggy's weight, much less his own. But Armas 
did put up some nice numbers during the 1988 regular season, which explains why 
Rader seems convinced that youth, meaning Bichette, would be better served back 
in triple A. 
</P>
<P>
"You hate to see a guy have the kind of spring that he did and get sent out," 
Rader said. "But conversely, if he does get sent out, he would certainly be the 
first guy we'd recall. The only reason he would be sent out in the first place 
is because we couldn't guarantee him enough playing time here. So it's a nice 
feeling to know that if you're getting sent out, it won't be long before you 
get back." 
</P>
<P>
Bichette wouldn't exactly use the word, "nice," to describe what it might feel 
like to be sent to Edmonton again. He prefers "tough" and "very disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
"But I know they're going to try to do what's best for me and the team," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bichette said he belongs in the major leagues now. It isn't an ultimatum or a 
ploy, just a simple declarative sentence spoken by a 25-year-old player at 
peace with himself and his swing. "I don't want to sound like I can do it all," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a spring to remember, Bichette's chances aren't good. Rader said 
Bichette would have to earn a starting position to make the team, and that's 
not going to happen with the company of White, Washington and Davis available. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you can place (Bichette) as a right-handed hitter in a platoon 
situation because how many at-bats (against left-handed pitchers) are you going 
to get?" Rader said. "Not as many as you need. 
</P>
<P>
"As a developing player, you don't want to place him in a platoon mode at this 
point in his career. He needs to start." 
</P>
<P>
So barring the improbable, Bichette will become a part-time Canadian again. 
It's not Anaheim, but then again, it's not Quad City, either. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the Angels or anybody, including myself, knows how good I can 
play," Bichette said. 
</P>
<P>
But don't worry, they will. And by the way, see you soon.

MEXICO CITY TEAM DEFEATS U.S., 2-0

Luis Alves scored one goal and assisted on another to lead Club America of 
Mexico City past the U.S. pre-selection team, 2-0, for the Santa Ana Cup 
championship in front of an overflow crowd of 10,500 Friday night at Santa Ana 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Alves' efforts, combined with a quick Club America defense, supported 
goalkeeper Adrian Chavez, who kept the U.S. team off the scoreboard with 10 
saves. 
</P>
<P>
"Considering that we've been back together for only a few days, I was pleased 
with our play," said U.S. Coach Jim Lennox, whose team is preparing for the 
World University Games in August. "Our defense was pretty well organized, but 
our offense wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
Alves scored the first goal with 23 minutes left in the first half when his 
25-yard line-drive kick took a wicked bounce past diving U.S. goalie Anton 
Nistl of UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Alves' goal came 10 minutes after Nistl made a diving save of Gonzalo Farfan's 
low, 10-yard shot from just outside the goalie's box. The save was one of two 
Nistl made in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez, who had six saves in the first half, prevented the U.S. from scoring 
the game's first goal with three minutes gone in the game when he made a 
leaping save of a rising line-drive kick by Ray Fernandez of UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Nine minutes later, the U.S. team again was stopped when Chavez jumped high to 
snare a header by San Diego State's Eric Wynaldo after a scramble in front of 
the net. 
</P>
<P>
Club America took a 2-0 lead 15 minutes into the second half when Carlos 
Hermosillo, after taking a pass from Alves, slammed a header past Indiana's 
Juergan Sommer, who replaced Nistl in goal at the start of the half.

$4-MILLION TOXXIC CONTROL DEAL DEADLINE EXTENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American Toxxic Control Inc. said that its major financial sources have agreed 
to extend until April 17 the financing deadline they imposed as part of a 
$4-million investment. 
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch Business Capital Inc. and San Francisco-based BBU Mezzanine Fund 
provided the $4 million in August to enable Huntington Beach-based American 
Toxxic to acquire a portion of U.S. Filter Corp. from Texcel International. As 
part of the deal, American Toxxic agreed to raise $2 million in new equity 
capital by Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
But the company raised only about $1.4 million through a private placement of 
stock and warrants by the time the deadline arrived, said Ski Milburn, acting 
chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
"We are still short about $600,000," he said, "but we are negotiating a debt 
and equity deal to raise $4 million, and it will contain more than enough 
equity" to meet the Merrill Lynch-BBU conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Milburn, who has been an outside director of the firm since it went public in a 
merger with Novan Energy Inc. of Boulder, Colo., in 1986, said he was named 
acting chief executive earlier this month after Lou Purmort, American Toxxic's 
founder, resigned. 
</P>
<P>
Purmort, who helped found U.S. Filter Corp. in 1953 and made about $20 million 
when the company was acquired by Ashland Oil in 1981, remains an American 
Toxxic director. 
</P>
<P>
He resigned his operating posts, however, after Forbes Magazine published a 
lengthy article questioning the company's goals and Purmort's credibility. 
Nearly 2 years ago, Forbes published an article that was highly favorable both 
to the company and to Purmort. 
</P>
<P>
Milburn said Purmort resigned as chairman and chief executive because of the 
most recent Forbes article. He said that neither Purmort nor American Toxxic, 
however, has responded to the article and that the company does not intend to 
get into a debate with the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Purmort could not be reached for comment.

BLUEBIRD CAFE -- A GREAT PLACE TO START IN NASHVILLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDALL MIKKELSEN, Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NASHVILLE, Tenn. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Blair Boies entered the Bluebird Cafe one Sunday night with a guitar, three 
songs and dreams of stardom. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the best places there is, if not the best" for an aspiring 
country musician to be discovered, Boies said of the tiny cafe here in the 
capital of country and Western music. 
</P>
<P>
The storefront room with sky-blue walls and green vinyl tablecloths has the 
relaxed air of a 1960s coffeehouse, and barely enough space to seat 100 people. 
</P>
<P>
But it has helped boost the fledgling careers of several modern country stars, 
including Steve Earle, Sweethearts of the Rodeo and T. Graham Brown. 
</P>
<P>
The hopeful musicians who perform at the Bluebird say the cafe offers them a 
friendly crowd willing to give a new performer a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"When you play here, everybody claps. It's not like a bar. It's a listening 
place," said Frank (Birdie) Saulino. 
</P>
<P>
Saulino is an established songwriter, but he came back to Bluebird with a new 
band to give the group a live workout. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd is mostly made up of other musicians, both the struggling and the 
successful. Between sets, the tables buzz with conversation of deals on the 
verge of closing, of stars considering recording someone's song. 
</P>
<P>
Record company executives visit in search of new talent. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I go down two or three times a week," said Mary Martin, head talent 
scout for RCA Records in Nashville. "In a sea of mediocrity, the Bluebird 
soothes the heart." 
</P>
<P>
Gently shepherding the scene is Amy Kurland, 33, who opened the cafe with a 
friend in 1982. 
</P>

Sporting long blond hair and a loose cotton dress, Kurland scurries about the 
club making sure the sound system is in tune, that the singers are ready and 
that the audience does not talk too loudly during the acts. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to take the magic of that room, and the magic of the people who 
have moved to Nashville because they've got something to say and team them up 
in the hopes of helping take that to a larger audience," Kurland said. 
</P>
<P>
A battered copy of "Joy of Cooking" rests on a shelf in her cluttered office in 
testament to her original notion of operating a serious restaurant. Now she 
serves snacks and beer and concentrates on the music. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of Kurland's mission is "songwriters' night" every Sunday at the 
Bluebird. Musicians who pass a one-song audition get a chance to show off three 
of their best tunes 6 months later along with other hopefuls. They play for 
free. 
</P>
<P>
Boies, a 24-year-old Texan, wore a faded blue work shirt with his initials 
outlined in metal studs when he sang his songs of teary farewells at 
songwriters' night. "It's a step toward getting something else accomplished," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic discovery made at the Bluebird was the group Sweethearts of 
the Rodeo, Kurland said. 
</P>
<P>
"They came here, did a showcase, got a record deal the next day," she said. 
"That's the kind of thing, when that gets published, the next day little girls 
from the smallest towns in Mississippi call me and want to get on stage."

HIGH SCHOOL ARTISTS SEE THEIR BEST AT GOLDEN WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Darsi Wolsleger, 18, has never met the man whose weathered hands, wrapped in 
rags and scraped at the knuckles, helped her win the top prize in the third 
annual Golden West College High School Art Competition. 
</P>
<P>
Worn rough by time and labor, each loosely grasping the other in fatigue, they 
are the central focus in "Hands," a large colored-pencil drawing by Wolsleger, 
a senior at Garden Grove's Rancho Alamitos High School. Like many of her fellow 
exhibitors at the Golden West show, Wolsleger based her work on a magazine 
photograph during a class project on photo realism, re-creating the image with 
painstaking attention to detail. 
</P>
<P>
The show, which features 66 paintings, drawings, prints and sculptures by 
Orange County high school students, is on exhibit through Friday at the Golden 
West College art gallery. Coordinated for the last two years by gallery 
director Paul Donaldson, the competition lets students "see their work in a 
professional setting and allows them to compare their techniques and concepts 
with their peers." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Wolsleger's $500 scholarship, prizes were awarded to Rancho 
Alamitos students Jenee Foss ($100 Faculty Award), Jody Anderson ($50 Juror's 
Award), and Rosalie Damicog ($50 President's Award); Belinda Young of Los 
Alamitos High School ($50 Director's Award) and Kimberly Kollenda of Huntington 
Beach High School ($50 Patron's Award). 
</P>
<P>
But to most exhibitors, the value of this kind of open competition isn't 
measured in dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"(Competing) can help get you into the college you want," said Anderson, who 
entered a larger-than-life watercolor of a toothless old man nursing a soggy 
cigar. "Even if the awards aren't cash, you can put them in your portfolio when 
you start looking for schools." A nonsmoker, Anderson said he also based his 
work on a magazine photograph. He chose the theme because "it had good 
composition for watercolor, lots of lights and darks." 
</P>
<P>
"Besides," he added with a laugh, "it shows what smoking does to you . . . (it) 
makes all your teeth fall out." 
</P>
<P>
In "Conceptions," Rancho Alamitos student Thi Pham offers one view of the 
creation of life in bold shades of red and black; Daniel Lee, also of Rancho 
Alamitos, examines new life from another angle in "Liberty," which pays tribute 
to America's immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
The mood of the show swings from light-hearted -- as in Belinda Young's 
acrylic, "Amusement Park," in which a blissful blonde frolics in the Happiest 
Place on Earth, to uneasy, as in "Shattered Dream," a jarring combination of 
images and patterns by Rancho Alamitos student Greta Weatherby. Calm is 
restored with Rosalie Damicog's tempera of a contemplative, olive-skinned girl 
veiled in rich reds and oranges. 
</P>
<P>
In choosing the winners, Donaldson said he looked not only for technical 
expertise, but for a certain "abstract quality . . . an awareness of something 
beyond the mirror surface." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to providing exposure for students' work, the high school art 
competition serves as a recruitment vehicle for the college's art programs, 
Donaldson said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've found some of our best art students through these shows," he said. "It 
brings the young artistic community together and reassures them that there is 
an art world available out here . . . and it allows our students to make 
contact with the high school kids on an individual basis. 
</P>
<P>
"We usually say to students that the pursuit of art, even if it's not their 
professional goal, gives continuous rewards . . . even if they simply become a 
better audience for other artists." 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden West College High School Art exhibit continues through Friday at 
the college art gallery, 15744 Golden West St., Huntington Beach. Gallery hours 
are Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., Tuesday and Wednesday evenings, 7 
p.m. to 8 p.m. Admission is free. Information: (714) 895-8358.

OPERA PACIFIC SIGNS CONTRACT FOR ORCHESTRA 
</P>

Opera Pacific of Costa Mesa has signed a 3-year contract with the Opera Pacific 
Orchestra covering musicians hired to play in the pit orchestra for the 
company's productions. The contract sets labor guidelines and wage levels for 
the orchestra through 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The contract is expected to help establish a stronger identity for the group, 
whose members include many of the musicians who belong to the Santa Ana-based 
Pacific Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
"The public has shown some confusion in differentiating between the Opera 
Pacific Orchestra and the Pacific Symphony," Lori Green, Opera Pacific director 
of production, said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
"Opera Pacific contracts its musicians independently. Although our orchestra 
contractor utilizes many musicians who also perform with the Pacific Symphony, 
the two are completely separate entities." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement between the orchestra and the opera company was negotiated 
through Orange County Musicians' Assn. Local 7, American Federation of 
Musicians. CHRIS PASLES
