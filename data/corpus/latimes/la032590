I enjoyed reading "O, Happy Days!" The cover, showing a neighborhood in Sherman 
Oaks in 1957, was particularly interesting. Only one thing was missing -- a 
picture of that same street as it looks 33 years later.

O, HAPPY DAYS! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What a surprise to see myself when I was 12 years old on the cover of your 
magazine. I lived on Woodcliff. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, things seemed simple in those "Happy Days" -- and life for me was very 
glamorous in many ways, for my father was a movie producer. 
</P>
<P>
I remember Bob's Big Boy, cruising Van Nuys Boulevard, and going to Hollywood, 
safely, by bus. But that life was very crazy-making -- for behind the scene 
were closet alcoholic mothers, workaholic fathers and lonely children. Everyone 
pretended life was perfect and just covered up feelings and denied reality. If 
these days look crazy compared to the 1950s, it is only because we are more 
honest and real about what goes on. 
</P>
<P>
I'm happy to be living in 1990.

Regarding "O, Happy Days!" (Feb. 4): The 1950s in Los Angeles were important 
because they marked the watershed between Los Angeles, the big city, and Los 
Angeles, the megalopolis. Thanks for the fine collection of memories. However, 
we must look forward and not back as we prepare to enter the 21st Century.

NEW INGREDIENTS AND BRUSHES PROMISE MASCARA-WEARERS NO-SMEAR LASHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
EARLY LAST year, Maybelline phased out its cake mascara, a product that had 
been around since the 1920s. Although the product was discontinued because of 
declining sales, within a month of its disappearance from drugstores and 
supermarkets, the onslaught began. Fans of the $3.65 mascara flooded the firm's 
Memphis headquarters with thousands of letters. By September, the lash makeup 
in the little red case was back on display. 
</P>
<P>
Mascara-wearers are both loyal and vociferous. Most would rather fight than 
switch, and for good reason. Finding a product that lengthens, darkens and/or 
thickens lashes all day without flaking, smudging or breaking can be a tedious 
process. Often, a woman doesn't discover that a new mascara has failed her 
until she looks in the mirror and sees black circles under her eyes, or until 
someone helpful flicks little black specks from her cheeks. So when she finds 
one that works, she typically stays with it. 
</P>
<P>
This season, women are about to hear that recent innovations have made mascaras 
better than ever. Exotic-sounding ingredients such as cashmere, silk and 
primrose oil, as well as new brush designs that coat lashes more evenly, have 
been introduced to prevent the Tammy Faye Bakker look -- and to woo consumers 
away from the leaders in the field: Maybelline, which sells 35 million tubes 
year in drugstores and supermarkets, and Lancome, the top-selling department 
store brand. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Max Factor launched No-Color mascara, a $5 clear glaze for the lashes. 
The promise of "no more racoon" eyes was enough to get women to try the 
product. So many bought it, in fact, that Max Factor's mascara sales jumped 45% 
that year, compared with an overall market that grew only 5%, according to 
market reports. 
</P>
<P>
Next month, there'll be another $5 mascara on the shelves: Stretch, a 
fiber-free lash lengthener. Max Factor's research shows that more than seven of 
10 women want a product that adds length. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the newcomers, mascara-wearers still prefer Maybelline's Great Lash and 
Cover Girl's Professional, which together represent 14% of the mascaras 
purchased in the country. Many women, it seems, are like Andrea Dovichi, 
manager of a specialty store in Hermosa Beach, who buys Cover Girl at the 
grocery store. "I used to wear Clinique," she notes, "but for $4, I can buy 
mascara and some bananas." 
</P>
<P>
But about one-third of mascara-wearers buy their mascara in department stores, 
often spending triple the price of drugstore brands. A Whittier housewife and 
mother of two small boys, Barbara Podevin has used Lancome Immencils Gentle 
Lash Thickener for 10 years and is more than willing to pay about $13 a tube. 
"I don't have the time or money for experimentation," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Women who have time to investigate at department store counters will find some 
new mascaras. Guerlain's StarCil is supposed to moisturize lashes as it 
lengthens and thickens. At $21, it's one of the most expensive of the new 
products. Earlier this month, Christian Dior introduced its Mascara Parfait 
With Cashmere, which is also intended to prevent lash breakage. The product's 
$12.50 price tag makes it one of Lancome's strongest new competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Still, no mascara, regardless of price, will be effective unless it is applied 
carefully. Makeup artist Joan Mazzei of Images for Hair in Corona del Mar 
suggests three coats, each allowed to dry completely. "After you apply the 
first," she explains, "hold the brush vertically and move it across the tips of 
the lashes. Then add a third coat traditionally."

FOOD &amp; WINE: OF RUSTIC ORIGINS; 
</P>
<P>
THE HIGH-FIBER, LOW-IN-SATURATED-FATS MEDITERRANEAN DIET GOES UP-COUNTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Calendar.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMERICANS have recently discovered the so-called Mediterranean diet, an eating 
style common to inhabitants of the Mediterranean basin that is high in fiber, 
low in saturated fats and full of grains, fruit, vegetables and seafood. This 
diet is old news in Europe. French food writer Austin de Croze was aware of it 
as early as 1931. That year, in a book entitled "What to Eat and Drink in 
France," he wrote: "We know of the nutritive power of figs and walnuts to the 
Greeks, of macaroni and polenta to the Italians, rice and pimentos to the 
Spaniards, black olives and tomatoes to the Provencals, green pimentos and 
garlic to the Languedocians, anchovies and garlic to the Roussillonnais -- all 
the foods made golden by olive oil." 
</P>
<P>
What de Croze didn't go on to say, however, is that one of the groups he 
mentions, the Roussillonnais, temper their Mediterranean diet with the hearty 
gastronomic imperatives of mountain living. The Roussillon occupies a corner of 
France defined on one side by the Mediterranean and on another by the rugged 
Pyrennes themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The food of this region has an appealingly rustic honesty. Fruit and vegetables 
are important ingredients in the cuisine, as they are in most of the 
Mediterranean -- the apples, pears and cherries of the Pyrenean foothills are 
particularly famous. Seafood is popular, especially shellfish and (as de Croze 
noted) anchovies, but there is also quite a bit of wild game consumed, and both 
veal and lamb are common. 
</P>
<P>
Typical dishes of the Roussillon include spiny lobster civet (a rich, 
wine-moistened stew), a garlicky near-bouillabaisse called la bouillinade, 
sauteed partridge or pigeon with garlic and lemon slices, and a thick 
rice-and-cabbage soup flavored with blood sausage and other charcuterie. 
</P>
<P>
One other specialty of the region, somewhat less fearsome than the 
aforementioned, is veal stewed with green olives. Like so many related dishes 
on both sides of the eastern Pyrenees, this stew is based on a sofregit, or 
"underfry," of onions and garlic, simmered for hours in olive oil until reduced 
to a sweet near-puree. (Sweet is the right word: Food scientist Harold McGee 
has pointed out that there are compounds in onions that "appear to be converted 
into another complex molecule that is 50 to 70 times sweeter than a molecule of 
table sugar.") To quote another gastronome of earlier times, a British writer 
who signed himself Lieut.-Col. Newnham-Davis: "The seductions of the burnt 
onion and the garlic clove are the foundations upon which rest the whole 
edifice of Pyrenean cooking." 
</P>
<P>
While this is admittedly a hearty dish, full of concentrated flavors, it isn't 
laden with fat or dangerously spicy or crowded with strange varieties of 
sausage. It's just a delicious example of what the Mediterranean diet can 
encompass when it goes up-country. It can be served alone, over rice, or 
Pyrenean-style with an accompaniment of simply cooked white beans. 
</P>
<P>
Veal Stewed With Green Olives 
</P>
<P>
5 to 6 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
3 large onions, coarsely chopped 
</P>
<P>
4 to 6 cloves garlic, peeled and minced 
</P>
<P>
4 large, ripe tomatoes, peeled, seeded and finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
3 1/2 pounds veal stew meat or boneless veal breast or veal shank, cut into 
irregular pieces about 1x2x3 inches 
</P>
<P>
2 cups veal or beef stock 
</P>
<P>
3 to 4 sprigs fresh marjoram leaves (or 1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram) 
</P>
<P>
4 to 5 sprigs parsley, minced 
</P>
<P>
1 bay leaf 
</P>
<P>
Salt and pepper 
</P>
<P>
2 cups good-quality green olives (see note), rinsed and pitted 
</P>
<P>
Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in large skillet. Add onions and garlic and simmer 
uncovered over lowest heat, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 hours. Onion mixture 
should be medium-brown in color and have consistency of coarse marmalade. 
</P>
<P>
Add tomatoes to onion mixture, stir well, and continue cooking over low heat. 
</P>
<P>
Heat 2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil in large stew pot or Dutch oven, and brown in 
it meat on all sides over medium-high heat, turning meat with tongs often and 
removing to a plate when browned. 
</P>
<P>
Deglaze stew pot with stock, scraping burnt bits off bottom with wooden spoon; 
then reduce heat to low and add onion-and-tomato mixture. Stir well into stock; 
then return meat to pot. Add marjoram, bay leaf and half parsley to liquid. 
Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover pot and simmer 3 hours, stirring 
occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 minutes before stew is done, stir in olives, re-cover pot, and 
continue cooking. To serve, garnish with remaining parsley. Serves 8. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Good choices include picholine du Gard olives, imported from France under 
several labels, or Santa Barbara Brand Country-Style Olives. Avoid olives 
strongly flavored with garlic or herbs. Pre-pitted olives seem to lose flavor 
and texture in the pitting process. Food stylist: Amy Nathan

BALZER ON WINE: 'DANCING STARS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert Lawrence Balzer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"TO GIVE BIRTH to a dancing star, one must have chaos within," the German 
philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche wrote. And stellar wines are what Sebastiani 
Vineyards is producing now, four years after a highly publicized schism in the 
Sebastiani family. 
</P>
<P>
Under the aggressive direction of Don Sebastiani, who took over the management 
after his elder brother, Sam, was fired by their mother in 1986, the nation's 
sixth-largest winery and No. 1 producer of Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon 
has doubled its case production and sales, from 2.2 million cases in 1986 to 
4.4 million cases at the close of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
With Jim Knapp, the winery's director of communications, I recently tasted 
Sebastiani's "dancing stars" from the Sebastiani Estates Group. The collection 
of vineyard-designated Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon was made by wine maker 
Mary Sullivan with grapes from five Sonoma Valley locations. 
</P>
<P>
All were beguiling. Some brief descriptions: 
</P>
<P>
KINNEYBROOK 1987 Sonoma Valley Chardonnay ($13). From non-irrigated Sonoma 
Valley slopes, this wine is round and rich. 
</P>
<P>
WILDWOOD HILL 1987 Sonoma Valley Chardonnay ($13). A vanilla-cream taste, from 
the full malolactic fermentation and from fully ripe grapes of September 
harvest. Delicate in style. 
</P>
<P>
WILSON RANCH 1987 Sonoma Valley Chardonnay ($13). Bouquet suggestions of ripe 
pear, refined oak hints from eight months in Limousin and Nevers barrels. Needs 
time to reach its potential richness. 
</P>
<P>
CLARK RANCH 1987 Sonoma Valley Chardonnay ($13). The most complex in taste of 
these wines, with anise-like fragrance beyond the butterscotch and pear 
bouquet. A wine of striking elegance; satin-smooth. 
</P>
<P>
CHERRYBLOCK 1986 Sonoma Valley Cabernet Sauvignon ($17.50). No harsh edges, 
fine varietal character exemplified by ripe cherry tastes, tobacco-leaf scents, 
chocolate-smooth texture. Ready to enjoy, but has good aging potentials. Robert 
Lawrence Balzer

CAROUSEL DREAMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AS A YOUNG BOY, Augustin Rodiles "would spend all my allowance money riding the 
carousel. To me, those horses were as real as a dream." 
</P>
<P>
Now 35, Rodiles, a cabinet maker by trade and master carousel horse carver by 
avocation, is giving shape to his childhood dream. And, like many a dreamer, 
Rodiles wants to share his visions. He'll be teaching a class in miniature 
carousel horse carving at Pasadena's Victory Park in April. "It's great fun for 
me -- the ones that appreciate the art of carousel horses are full-grown men 
and women," says Rodiles. 
</P>
<P>
But if owning one, not making one, is your objective, Rodiles will be only too 
happy to accommodate. Rodiles makes full-size (60" tall, 60" long) horses for 
sale; hand-sculpted with carving tools -- no hammers -- they take two to three 
months to produce. The price: about $4,000 for unpainted ones, $5,000 for 
painted versions "because they take so much longer to do." 
</P>
<P>
The horses are made from sugar pine, in the traditional way -- hollow, to save 
weight on the carousel. "I make reproductions," says Rodiles, "but I always 
change the pattern a little bit. In the future, I'm going to make my own 
designs, following the traditional way." 
</P>
<P>
And, says Rodiles, who made his first horse only five years ago: "I am barely 
beginning on the art of carousel horses. I am positive that one day I will be 
able to say more of what I have done to contribute to the art of carousel." 
</P>
<P>
 Augustin Rodiles, by appointment only, (818) 797-5328; Wood-carving class: 
Friday nights from April 9 to June 15 at Victory Park, 2575 Paloma St., 
Pasadena., (818) 798-0865 MARTIN ZIMMERMAN

<TEXT>

The "Mid-Century Memoirs," by Karen Lansky, about how wonderful it was growing 
up in Los Angeles in the '40s and '50s, were almost all sentimental and 
nostalgic -- with very little mention of the era's underbelly. One of my most 
vivid memories of the late '40s was of an apartment-building sign that I used 
to stare at every morning while waiting for a bus to work: "No dogs, no 
peddlers, no Jews." What hit me hardest was not the bigotry of the building's 
owner, but that such a sign was even permitted.

MALCOLM X 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is indeed a good thing that Malcolm X's life and teachings are receiving 
attention from a new generation ("The Rebirth of Malcolm X," by Charisse Jones, 
Feb. 4). I have taught all my students -- Afro-American, Asian, Latino, white 
and "other" -- about his teachings for years. 
</P>
<P>
But to idly dismiss the many years that Malcolm X was a racist is to miss part 
of what makes him such a great inspiration. He came to understand that the 
color of a person's skin is not the basis on which a person should be judged 
good or bad, friend or enemy. 
</P>
<P>
It is ironic and sad that 25 years later, the leader of the very same church 
whose then-leader may have been behind Malcolm X's assassination -- the Nation 
of Islam -- still preaches the hate Malcolm X came to repudiate and loathe. One 
can only hope that middle-class and, more important, young Afro-Americans, as 
well as all young Americans, tune into all of what Malcolm X said and stood 
for, and not just take parts of his message and legacy out of context.

I am white. For a long time my color has hampered me from voicing my opinion of 
Malcolm X.

I have never been against his teachings.

On the contrary, I believe that his views of black suppression and how to 
remedy the situation are just. 
</P>
<P>
Thank you, Charisse Jones, for the clear and precise article "The Rebirth of 
Malcolm X." I hope that my white contemporaries have taken the time to read it 
in full, instead of banishing it to the wastepaper basket -- as has been done 
many times before with anything that has contradicted popular white beliefs.

Art World talked with Hilton Kramer, the outspoken art critic and editor of the

Cultural Center, now under construction in Westwood, as a high-return business 
bonanza. Here is what Kramer had to say about the museum's plans.

A: I find the whole thing absolutely hilarious. . . . In principle, it simply 
carries the commercialization and vulgarization of our art museums to a logical 
conclusion. And in practice, it's a recipe for disaster. All it's going to do 
is add another layer of vulgarity to the whole museum profession. . . . To open 
a museum with the idea of making it a flaming commercial enterprise is both 
repulsive in itself and quite unworkable. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What do you think of wording in the business plan saying the museum "will 
quickly establish itself as one of the finest museums on the West Coast and in 
the country." 
</P>
<P>
A: It will not establish itself as one of the finest museums in the country. 
Whether it will establish itself as one of the finest museums on the West Coast 
or in Southern California is a rather smaller compass of comparison. That will 
depend entirely on what happens with the other institutions. But all I think it 
will do is add yet another problematical museum institution to the other 
institutions already in Southern California (referring to institutions such as 
LACMA, which he said is "saddled with wretched architecture"; the J. Paul Getty 
Museum, which he said came along "too late to put it in the running"; and The 
Norton Simon Museum, which he said "always seems to be in the danger of 
disappearing."). 
</P>
<P>
Q: What about the document's plan to hire a museum director for $70,000 a year? 
</P>
<P>
A: It's preposterous to think of hiring a major museum director at only $70,000 
a year. You'd almost have to pay the PR director that much. Of course in this 
institution, the PR director may be paid more than the museum director. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What about the plan to employ no curatorial staff? Is that possible? 
</P>
<P>
A: It is possible in the same way as having a doctor's office without 
conducting tests is possible. To run a museum without a curatorial staff is to 
run the risk of being called a bogus operation. To say that you can run a 
museum without a curatorial staff is to say that you are running a museum 
without intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Given the plans set for it, will the Armand Hammer Museum be successful? 
</P>
<P>
A: I can't imagine that it will succeed if the objective is to make a profit. 
What it will succeed at is making both itself and the California cultural scene 
the laughingstock of the country. I can see French and German television 
producing hilarious documentaries on such an institution -- on what happens to 
art in the hands of obtuse Americans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE SCENE 
</P>
<P>
Despite rumors floating in some circles that Marilyn Butler is thinking about 
closing down her Santa Monica Gallery, Butler told Art World that while closing 
her gallery is "always a possibility," she hasn't "done anything concrete so 
far." Butler opened the gallery at 910 Colorado Ave. in November of 1988. "I 
have three galleries and I certainly don't need all three of them," Butler 
said, referring to her 12-year-old business in Scottsdale, Ariz., and 
8-year-old gallery in Santa Fe, N.M. "But I haven't made any decision one way 
or the other. It will depend on how far I can extend myself physically -- how 
long I can keep going back and forth between the three. . . . Galleries are 
very personal businesses, so my decision will be based on that."

Sixty museum membership directors from the U.S. and Canada are in town this 
week to attend the 11th annual Art Museum Membership Conference, which is being 
co-hosted by the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Los Angeles County Museum 
of Art. The conference, which runs through Tuesday, provides a forum for the 
directors to discuss issues of community participation and support.

OVERHEARD 
</P>
<P>
A middle-aged man who stopped by to see " 'Success is a job in New York. . . . 
' The Early Art and Business of Andy Warhol" at the Newport Harbor Art Museum 
just before it closed last week seemed to find Warhol's early work much more 
representative and recognizable as "real art" than his later Pop Art. While in 
the museum's gift store, the man asked the shop's young female cashier if she 
had seen the show and if it had made her sad. "Sad?" the clerk replied 
quizzically. "Yes," came back the man. "He could have been a great artist."

CURRENTS: 
</P>
<P>
The famous Rodin sculpture "The Three Shades" is on view through June 1 in the 
sculpture court of the Palm Springs Desert Museum. The work is a group of three 
male figures conceived by Auguste Rodin to grace the top of a set of monumental 
bronze doors commissioned in 1880 by the French government. Entitled "The Gates 
of Hell," the doors were inspired by Dante's "The Divine Comedy." The three 
figures, symbolizing fate, have their heads bowed from the weight of their 
destiny and express anguish, anxiety and resignation. Although Rodin never cast 
"The Gates of Hell" in total during his lifetime, he worked on it for two 
decades and used many parts of it in separate sculptures. In 1977, renowned 
contemporary Rodin collector B. Gerald Cantor commissioned the Coubertin 
Foundry outside of Paris to cast the entire "Gates of Hell," which includes 180 
separate figures. "The Three Shades," which measures 75 inches-by-75 
inches-by-42 inches, is on extended loan from the B. Gerald Cantor Collections.

DEBUTS 
</P>
<P>
The first one-person show in Los Angeles of works by New York-based sculptor 
Ann Messner opens Saturday at Shoshana Wayne Gallery in Santa Monica. Messner's 
metal sculptures consist of fragments taken from the common yet complex objects 
that make up the modern urban environment. She has exhibited extensively in 
galleries on the East Coast and in Europe, and is perhaps best known for her 
outdoor public installations, including the 1987 piece, "Meteor," at Times 
Square. Messner's new sculptures will be at the gallery through April 28. 
</P>
<P>
The first Los Angeles exhibition of work by Arizona-based painter Philip C. 
Curtis goes on view Saturday at Marilyn Butler Gallery. Curtis was born in 
Michigan in 1907, was trained at Yale University and served in the Army during 
World War II. Since his release from the Army, Curtis has lived in virtual 
isolation and has worked outside the mainstream, exhibiting primarily in U.S. 
and European museums such as the Phoenix Art Museum, which has a permanent 
display of his works in its foyer. The show runs through April 28.

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS: MONETARY POLICY IS NOT A PANACEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRWIN L. KELLNER, IRWIN L. KELLNER is chief economist at Manufacturers 
Hanover in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By now, it should be fairly evident that the new decade has begun on a weak 
economic note. Growth of the gross national product in last year's final 
quarter was almost non-existent, while output in January slid by the steepest 
monthly rate in seven years and gained only slightly in February, according to 
the nation's purchasing managers. 
</P>
<P>
The financial markets aren't in much better shape. Bond prices have tumbled 
since the middle of December, sending the yield on the bellwether 30-year 
Treasury bond soaring by over 0.75 percentage point to nearly 8.67% at one 
point recently -- its highest level since last spring. 
</P>
<P>
This year hasn't been kind to stocks either. The popular averages experienced 
one of their worst Januarys in 30 years and have regained only a small part of 
the drop since. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinarily, the Federal Reserve Board would respond to these ominous signs by 
loosening up on money, pushing interest rates down. Although the Fed has eased, 
it hasn't eased very much. 
</P>
<P>
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and his colleagues at the Fed are aware of the 
softness in business activity. However, they also worry about other things, 
such as the rate of inflation. This leads me to conclude that the Fed has a 
great deal of confidence in its ability to manage the economy -- more so than 
may actually be justified. 
</P>
<P>
It may be true that monetary policy can be used effectively to restrain the 
economy. But it does not necessarily follow that monetary policy alone can 
stimulate activity when such a move is called for. 
</P>
<P>
This was the situation in the 1930s. At that time, the economy was spiraling 
downward. Recognizing that it had tightened money when it should have loosened 
it, the Fed proceeded to flood the banking system with reserves in the hopes of 
driving interest rates low enough to stimulate borrowing and increase spending. 
</P>
<P>
Rates came down, all right, but the banks refused to lend and people were 
reluctant to borrow. This gave rise to the expression, "You can't push on a 
string." 
</P>
<P>
It seems to me that the Fed's freedom to maneuver is being increasingly 
constrained by a unique set of developments that I call conundrums: 
</P>
<P>
* If the Fed decides to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy, it may 
find that foreign investors will pull their funds out of U.S. fixed-income 
instruments because of the relative attractiveness of rates back home. This 
would cause interest rates in the United States to rise, as has occurred since 
mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
* Cutting Washington's budget deficit to reduce our dependence on foreign 
funds, thus our vulnerability, might constitute enough fiscal restraint to tip 
the economy over into the very recession that we're hoping to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
* Fears in some quarters that the Fed will have to ease to keep us out of a 
recession have contributed to the run-up in bond yields noted above, making it 
even more necessary for the Fed to ease. 
</P>
<P>
* Even if the Fed were to ease, it might not do much good, since lenders are 
becoming increasingly reluctant to lend, while many borrowers are so burdened 
with debt that they may not wish to borrow any more. 
</P>
<P>
* Anyway, monetary policy is mostly in the hands of the regulators and 
analysts, who are exhorting the banks to curtail lending to shore up their 
capital ratios. This is producing the kind of credit crunch that we used to see 
in the 1960s and 1970s, when there were limits on how much banks could pay for 
deposits and charge for loans. 
</P>
<P>
* Many people would have little reason to borrow, in any event, since the 
big-ticket items they would likely purchase with these borrowed funds now cost 
more than they can afford. Prices of new cars and new homes have gone up much 
faster than have most families' incomes during the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
* Discretionary buying power in general is being chewed up by rapidly rising 
Social Security taxes and the high cost of medical care, food and energy. These 
items are obviously outside the purview of monetary policy, yet if the Fed 
accommodates these increases, they'll become ingrained in our economy. 
</P>
<P>
* We need a lower dollar to revive exports and curtail imports -- both 
essential to keeping us out of recession. Yet pushing the buck down would very 
likely increase the inflation pressures that the Fed is concerned about. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that whatever they do may be wrong, Fed officials lately have begun 
to talk about how they believe that the threat of recession is receding. In 
this way, they hope to keep a lid on inflation and interest rates and hold the 
economy on an even keel. 
</P>
<P>
But if the Fed is no longer worried about recession, maybe the rest of us 
should be. This is because interest rates are still restraining economic 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
And if the Fed is waiting for inflation to slow before easing money, it should 
be aware of one other fact: Most of the reduction in a given rate of inflation 
tends to occur after the economy has gone through a recession. 
</P>
<P>
In other words: No pain, no gain in the fight against inflation.

SURCHARGE LETS CONSUMER KNOW THAT CULPRIT BEHIND HIGHER COSTS IS INSURANCE 
COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is in regard to S. J. Diamond's "It Pays to Question Those Bill 
Surcharges," March 16. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, after having had excellent safety and loss records, our 
insurance premiums doubled and tripled in two years. 
</P>
<P>
As any business, to survive, this cost was inevitably passed on to the 
customer. After careful consideration we decided on a surcharge for two main 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
First, we wanted the customer to clearly see on the invoice that skyrocketing 
insurance rates had affected their cost for home services. It should also be 
pointed out that the surcharge covers only a portion of the increase and does 
not begin to pay our entire insurance premium. 
</P>
<P>
The surcharge also was the least expensive way of passing this expense on to 
the client. Any increase in the hourly labor rate always brings on additional 
taxes and additional insurance fees resulting in a final increase of charges in 
excess of what is really needed to defray costs.

What next? On March 5, on the heels of the Palm Springs trade"summit,"we read

SIMMONS LACKS EXPERTISE TO OPERATE LOCKHEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am concerned about Harold C. Simmons' intentions to acquire large blocks of 
Lockheed stock. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons has no experience in managing a high-tech organization such as 
Lockheed. If he intends to run Lockheed, this is a risky way to obtain 
on-the-job training. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons' expertise is gaining control of a corporation, then breaking it up and 
selling it off piece by piece to make a profit. The United States cannot afford 
to have Lockheed broken up. Lockheed is a national asset.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Youqi Wang drags deeply on his cigarette, stares up at the speckled ceiling of 
his Caltech student apartment and contemplates spending two years in a Chinese 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
Two years he could handle. That would be 730 days crammed with 25 others into a 
tiny cell where the New York-based human rights group Asia Watch says political 
prisoners are brutally beaten and tortured with electric cattle prods. 
</P>
<P>
"If that would be the end of it, I'd go back," muses the 32-year-old doctoral 
candidate in biochemistry, who is active in the pro-democracy movement here in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is, no one knows exactly what retribution the Chinese government 
will exact once the Chinese students, especially those who have openly 
criticized the communist regime, return home. 
</P>
<P>
Nine months have passed since Chinese troops opened fire on students at Tian An 
Men Square, killing hundreds and possibly thousands of civilians. The media, 
which once beamed the crackdown into American living rooms, have moved on to 
fresher stories unfolding in Managua, Johannesburg and Vilnius. 
</P>
<P>
But for Youqi Wang, his 33-year-old wife, Hua Chuan, and 40,000 other Chinese 
students living in the United States, the drama is just beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Many will soon graduate or complete their fellowships. Their student visas will 
expire. And they will plunge into a murky political limbo from which there is 
no clear way out. 
</P>
<P>
"If I go home, there's no doubt that I'll be put in jail," Wang says. "But 
because I cannot exactly predict what will happen when I go back to China, I 
feel fear." 
</P>
<P>
It is a balmy Saturday evening and in a grassy courtyard below, a group of 
American students are drinking beer and barbecuing hamburgers. Upstairs in the 
sparsely decorated apartment shared by Wang and Chuan, the talk is more somber. 
</P>
<P>
Although President Bush has promised that no Chinese students will be sent back 
against their will, some Chinese students aren't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
Wang's passport expired in January and he says he is too afraid to visit the 
Chinese embassy to apply for renewal. Chuan's J-1 student visa will expire in 
November, when she finishes 18 months of post-doctoral research in chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about people whose visas are running out," says Duke Austin, a 
spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Washington. Austin 
adds that the students are protected, at least until June 5, by an executive 
order signed by Bush that directs immigration officials not to deport them. 
</P>
<P>
For now, life for the Pasadena couple juxtaposes the sublime and the mundane. 
</P>
<P>
As she explains how lofty democratic principles should be implemented inChina, 
Chuan hooks her toes under the living room couch and does sit-ups. Wang sprawls 
in a chair and drinks green tea. 
</P>
<P>
They have cleaned their apartment only once in the past six months, they 
confess sheepishly, although it looks clean enough. They sent out no greeting 
cards this holiday season. Last year,they saw one movie. 
</P>
<P>
They spend their waking hours working, studying or attending political 
meetings. On their Pasadena living room wall is a sign that says, "Support 
Democracy in China." Proudly, they show a visitor a button reproducing the 
famous photo of a Chinese student who single-handedly held back a row of Red 
Army tanks during the spring demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Wang's biggest fear is that, after spending 48 straight hours in the chemistry 
lab, he will fall asleep while driving his 1984 Dodge Colt home from UC Santa 
Barbara, where his professor has transferred. 
</P>
<P>
Chuan's is that she will never again see the grandmother who starved herself so 
she could eat. Now in her last years, Chuan's grandmother doesn't understand 
why her granddaughter can't return home to take care of her. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Chuan almost did return, but friends in China called her collect to 
prevent it. "They warned me not to go back, they said I'd be in big trouble, 
that the government knew what I had been doing," she says. 
</P>
<P>
In their willingness to speak out against the Chinese government, Wang and 
Chuan part company with many of their colleagues at Caltech, who declined to be 
interviewed because they feared government reprisal for themselves and their 
families back home. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's strategy seems to be that if they are vocal enough, the government 
will abandon them as hopeless counter-revolutionaries. 
</P>
<P>
"That government will destroy the whole Chinese nation," Wang says. "We want 
eventually to go back to China. We think society needs us. But we . . . feel no 
loyalty" to the communist government. 
</P>
<P>
They believe their activities are monitored by Chinese authorities. Although 
the Chinese Embassy has denied harassing or threatening students, their 
telephone rings with late-night, anonymous calls. They suspect their calls home 
to China are heard by eavesdroppers. 
</P>
<P>
But they resist applying for political asylum because it is the last, most 
desperate card they can play. 
</P>
<P>
"By Chinese tradition, if you apply for political asylum, you will be 
considered an enemy of the people and the nation," Wang says. 
</P>
<P>
Both started out as idealistic young communists. 
</P>
<P>
Chuan's parents were in the Red Army. When her parents were exiled to the 
countryside for being "rightists," the 8-year-old girl told her father 
solemnly, "Daddy, if you did something wrong, just tell the Communist Party and 
they'll forgive you," Chuan recalls. 
</P>
<P>
Revelation came slowly. "I started asking why people don't love each other, why 
the government encouraged people to spy on each other. After the Cultural 
Revolution we knew there was something wrong with this society." 
</P>
<P>
Wang, who loved to tinker with electricity as a child, says his epiphany came 
when the government banished him to a textile factory after high school despite 
his request to work in electronics. 
</P>
<P>
The two met at Fudan University in Shanghai in 1978, where Chuan's father had 
forbidden her to get involved in politics, international relations or history. 
So she majored in chemistry. Wang was her adviser. 
</P>
<P>
For a long time, they observed the communist ban on student dating. 
</P>
<P>
"It's considered even worse than stealing," Chuan says. 
</P>
<P>
"We were such good students," Wang adds. "We were not brave enough to date." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, they succumbed to love and in 1984, got married -- secretly. 
</P>
<P>
"We had an underground marriage," Wang jokes. "We have a lot of experience with 
underground activities." 
</P>
<P>
They came to the United States separately, to different universities, about 
five years ago. In six years of marriage, they calculate they have spent 1 1/2 
years together. 
</P>
<P>
On this night, they are headed to a political meeting that may last until 5 
a.m. They decline to say more for fear of disrupting the delicate network they 
have helped build in the last year. But they say they keep close contact with 
pro-democracy students still in China. 
</P>
<P>
The two were reborn as political radicals on June 4, the day the Chinese troops 
opened fire in Tian An Men Square. During the crackdown, their apartment became 
a command post for pro-democracy activities, sending up to 100 faxes daily and 
using computer bulletin boards to link Chinese students worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
They are the cream of the Chinese intelligentsia, these students who toil over 
thick tomes of chemistry, political science and physics; work late hours under 
flickering, fluorescent lab lights and flit like slender ghosts across the 
leafy walkways and stately halls of Caltech, MIT, Harvard and other prestigious 
institutes. 
</P>
<P>
Most are in their 30s and belong to the "Class of '77," signifying the first 
year the Chinese government reopened the nation's universities after a bloody, 
10-year rampage against intellectuals during the Cultural Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all the student leaders came from the Class of '77, and most have the 
brightest minds, since they had to beat out 1,000 other applicants for each 
coveted spot. Theirs was a generation denied an intellectual legacy, and today, 
they are determined to reclaim it. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't go from high school to university," explains Hua Chuan. "We spent up 
to 10 years in factories and in the countryside. We went through the Cultural 
Revolution. We knew what society was all about." 
</P>
<P>
Back in China, Wang and Chuan held modern, Western views that sometimes put 
them at odds with traditional culture. But here, however comfortably they wear 
their sweat pants and Levis, they carry their Chinese-ness around with them, 
always conscious of being strangers in a strange land. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a much happier life here in the United States. But although we stay in 
the U.S. for a long time, we still feel like guests," Wang says. 
</P>
<P>
And they ache for the evocative memories of their homeland. For Wang, it is the 
vistas of China, the serene and breathtaking mountains, the weeklong hikes to 
remote temples abandoned after the communists kicked out the monks. 
</P>
<P>
But the nostalgia is shot through with guilt. Several professors at Fudan 
vouched for Wang's return from the United States, seeing him off with explicit 
orders: Do not get involved in political activity. 
</P>
<P>
Today, apprehension gnaws at him. Without their help, he could never have come 
here. Now, they may be suffering for his actions. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he feels compelled to stand up for what he thinks is right. "You've got 
to have some people fight for a better future," he says. "If everyone keeps 
quiet, then nothing changes." 
</P>

A NEED TO 'WATCH OUT FOR WHAT WE WATCH'; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: POMONA COLLEGE PROFESSOR ARGUES THAT IN ORDER TO SEPARATE THE GOOD 
FROM THE BAD, VIEWERS MUST BECOME "VISUALLY LITERATE." 
</P>

An image consultant told some worried members of Parliament last year, just 
before the first live televised proceedings of the British House of Commons, 
that 55% of their impact on viewers would come from the way they dressed and 
38% from the way they acted in front of the cameras. 
</P>
<P>
Only 7% depended on what they said, the image consultant contended. 
</P>
<P>
It just goes to show what a complex instrument television has become, says 
Brian Stonehill. In 50 years, that novel little electronic receiver that could 
miraculously capture transmitted pictures in the home has become "a great truth 
teller and a powerful distorter of the truth," says the Pomona College 
professor of English and media studies. 
</P>
<P>
Television has penetrated far into space to bring us pictures of Jupiter and 
Neptune, and it has cluttered the airwaves with images of slogan-spouting 
politicians with chiseled profiles. It has given us stunning live pictures of 
historic moments, and it has manipulated young minds with seductive commercials 
pitching toys and candy. 
</P>
<P>
To separate the good from the bad in the Babel of pictures that rushes into our 
homes every day, Stonehill says, we have to be "visually literate." 
</P>
<P>
"We have to watch out for what we watch," says Stonehill, 36, a boyish looking, 
sharp-featured man with a tangle of dun-colored hair. 
</P>
<P>
Stonehill is one of a small but growing group of academicians who have turned a 
critical eye on video -- "the language in which our culture speaks to itself," 
as he puts it. 
</P>
<P>
He teaches a course at Pomona called "Arts of Persuasion," in which students 
analyze television programs and commercials from the perspective of the 
principles of rhetoric. In the fall, he'll teach a new course in visual 
literacy and oversee a program for majors in media studies. 
</P>
<P>
He has dabbled in television himself, notably as the script developer of the 
PBS show "French in Action" and as a host of a talk show for the Claremont 
public access channel. 
</P>
<P>
And Stonehill, who contributes commentaries to newspaper Op-Ed pages, is one of 
commercial television's most persistent critics. 
</P>
<P>
"People forget that commercial TV's main function is to deliver the largest 
possible audience to the advertiser," Stonehill says. "Everything it does is to 
hold your attention for the commercials. That's what its function is. You have 
to recognize the devices it's using to get you to watch the commercials." 
</P>
<P>
To look beneath video's seductive surface, Stonehill takes his students all the 
way back to Aristotle and his principles of rhetoric. "Aristotle identifies 
three main ingredients in any persuasive situation," says Stonehill, who has 
been teaching at Pomona College for 11 years. "They're ethos, pathos and logos" 
-- or personal character, emotion and intellect. 
</P>
<P>
Television has translated those qualities, says Stonehill, into "sparkle, 
hearts and smarts," which can be seen in varying quantities during a day of 
commercial programing. 
</P>
<P>
"On the morning talk show, with the celebrities promoting their movies and so 
forth -- that's ethos or sparkle," he says. "Then the soap operas and game 
shows, they're big on hearts . . . pathos. The biggest intellectual demands of 
the day are the evening news shows, where you get smarts or logos." 
</P>
<P>
But the most powerful tool in the Aristotelian persuader's arsenal, Stonehill 
says, is something called "antithesis," or the practice of reducing issues to 
sharply delineated pros and cons. 
</P>
<P>
"TV uses antithesis constantly, forcing issues through a filter that enhances 
conflict," says Stonehill. "You get a view of the world as one team pitted 
against another. It may not be true to the world, but it gets ratings." 
</P>
<P>
Politics, the abortion issue, cops and robbers, race -- all tend to be fitted 
into "a Monday-night-football view of the world," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Stonehill, a graduate of Haverford College with a Ph.D. in English from the 
University of Chicago, says he got interested in media studies during the early 
stages of the Ronald Reagan presidency. 
</P>
<P>
"I started trying to understand why it was so easy to believe (Reagan), when, 
if you read the text of his speech in the next morning's newspaper, he was 
clearly saying mostly nothing," Stonehill says. 
</P>
<P>
He thinks the Great Communicator was extraordinarily adept at using both the 
television camera and his most powerful natural attribute -- his voice. "He has 
an amazing voice," says Stonehill. "When you listen to the tapes, he seems 
young and old at the same time. George Bush is having a harder time because he 
has nothing like the vocal instrument." 
</P>
<P>
As a child, Stonehill was exposed to the usual baby-boomer's allotment of TV 
time. "My parents tell about the time I fell out of my high chair and hit my 
head," says the professor. "They were worried that I might have injured myself, 
so the doctor told them: 'Keep him up tonight. Don't let him go to sleep.' They 
propped me up between them in the bed and left the TV on until they fell 
asleep. Much later, they found me sitting there, watching the snow on the 
screen. I was already interested in what was behind the screen." 
</P>
<P>
He's much more discriminating nowadays, rarely even allowing himself the luxury 
of "channel surfing," or using the remote control device to wander through the 
array of nightly offerings on his television. He keeps a blank calendar on the 
set, with entries for news and cultural shows that interest him. 
</P>
<P>
The illiterates of video, Stonehill says, are viewers who haven't developed the 
sophistication to "find out about the puppet show they're watching." They're 
people who "think that celebrities on TV really use the products they're 
endorsing" or who "don't read behind the political commercials." 
</P>
<P>
But the medium's real victims tend to be children, who are targets of 
commercials for kiddy products, he says. "They're very easily misled," he says. 
</P>
<P>
In the classroom, Stonehill is a cool analyst, leading the class past the 
obvious, digging into a subject like an archeologist dismantling a Pharoah's 
tomb. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent session of "Contemporary Fiction and Film," which Stonehill teaches 
with Jack Coogan, professor of communication arts at the School of Theology at 
Claremont, the two talked about the 1967 Arthur Penn movie "Bonnie and Clyde." 
</P>
<P>
Coogan placed the movie in a historical context, as one of the first examples 
of "a renaissance in American film," and Stonehill led a discussion of its 
controversial uses of violence, with its vivid shooting scenes. Modern tragedy 
or sleazy view of human nature? 
</P>
<P>
Then Stonehill brought it back to one of his favorite subject: violence on the 
screen. It's a great way to "grab an audience," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Compare in your mind how little time it takes to deliver that jolt of seeing 
somebody shot or stabbed," he said, "with how long it takes to set up an act of 
compassion. There's something structural about television's need for violence." 
</P>
<P>
The unceasing rush of sensation that is being directed at viewers has made us 
an unfeeling society, says Stonehill. "I have a sense of the global 
telecommunications network as a kind of nervous system that's wired for the 
planet," he says. "It's very effective at transmitting pain. Disasters, 
assassination, wars -- they can be felt around the world instantaneously. But 
the system doesn't know very well how to transmit knowledge or beauty or 
wisdom." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Stonehill sees a lot of good in television. "A persuasive 
argument could be made that the events that are astonishing us in Eastern 
Europe right now are to a large extent the gift of TV," he says. "People there 
just could not resist what they were seeing on their TV screens regarding life 
on the other side." 
</P>
<P>
Dictators have fallen or changed their ways for the same reasons, he contends. 
"The camera puts them on their best behavior." 
</P>
<P>
For good or bad, television is obviously here to stay, Stonehill says. "It used 
to be a kind of dirty little secret, and you didn't make it the centerpiece of 
your living room if you could avoid it," he says. "Now, people are much more 
hospitable to the TV." 
</P>
<P>
And viewers are becoming more literate. Even unsophisticated viewers are 
getting turned off by gratuitous violence nowadays, Stonehill says. "If the box 
does only that -- gives you a kind of electrical stimulus across the optical 
nerves -- people get tired of it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Just a lot of people getting tired of something can have an enormous impact, 
Stonehill says. "TV responds quickly to what people want."

HISTORICAL SOCIETY WAITS IN WINGS FOR NEW HOME TO BE RENOVATED

<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry Welker, 74, feels at home with Azusa history. The only problem is that 
Azusa history doesn't really have a home. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly a year has passed since the Durrell House, a two-story Spanish Colonial 
home, was dedicated as a city museum and official home of the Azusa Historical 
Society. Yet most of the historical society's archives and artifacts are still 
in storage, as the group's members wait for city officials to come up with 
enough money to finish restoring the house. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the curator, but right now I've got nothing to curate," Welker said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have heard promises for three years and nothing has been done," said Jack 
Williams, president of the historical society. "I understand that government 
can move very slowly, but it can get disheartening at times." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, 73, whose family came to Azusa in 1886, says his main concern is 
keeping the society going. "I'd hate to see it lost," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The historical society, which began more than 75 years ago and now has about 
100 members, established its first museum in City Hall in 1970. Three years 
ago, when City Hall's west wing was remodeled, the museum was asked to move out 
temporarily until a new location could be found. 
</P>
<P>
At about the same time, the Durrell House, built in 1923 for Moses Thompson 
Durrell, Azusa's first mayor, was donated to the city by Durrell's family for 
use as a museum. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1987, the house was moved from its original location at 575 E. 
Foothill Blvd. to the park behind City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Restoration work began the following fall. The house was formally dedicated on 
May 13, 1989, even though the second floor still needed renovation, and still 
does. Its hardwood floorboards have been ripped up and must be replaced, the 
walls need a new coat of paint and doors lack doorknobs. 
</P>
<P>
"We moved in some of the larger pieces of furniture for the dedication, but 
until the house is completed we can't move in the rest," Williams said. "When 
you have workers coming in and out, you can't have valuable things lying 
around. We can't be here every day to make sure no one takes anything." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Diaz, the city administrator, said refurbishing the building was intended 
to be a "multi-year project." Because of other funding priorities, he said, 
this year's budget didn't include any money for renovation. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of competing interests vying for money. . . . We have to have 
priorities," Diaz said. 
</P>
<P>
Moving the house and refurbishing the first floor cost $220,000, Diaz said. He 
said he is unable to estimate what it will cost to revamp the second floor. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Eugene Moses promised to push for action on the renovation. 
</P>
<P>
"No one brought this to my attention. Now that I know, I will definitely put it 
on the council agenda," Moses said. "I think (the historical society) is a 
healthy thing. . . . We have to preserve our history." 
</P>
<P>
The house was donated by Durrell's daughter Bernice, 78, who lived in it before 
she donated it to the city in 1986. She said she cannot understand why the 
renovation has taken so long. 
</P>
<P>
"They have been very slow in fixing the house," Bernice Durrell said. "They 
dedicated the house when it really wasn't ready yet, and I don't think the 
historical society should move in until everything is ready because they have 
too many valuable things." 
</P>
<P>
Welker, an Azusa resident for 40 years, has an unlimited supply of lore about 
the city, which was home to Shoshonean Indians before Spanish explorers and 
settlers came to the region. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you know that the Andrews Sisters recorded a song called 'Azusa'? We have 
that album," Welker said. 
</P>
<P>
The society's historical artifacts, some dating back to the late 1800s, are 
still in storage at the city yard. They include farm tools, cooking utensils, 
dishes, silverware and clothing. The society also has hundreds of pictures and 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
"We have high school annuals going back to the early 1900s," Williams said. "A 
lot of people would come to see the annuals looking for their old friends. . . 
. All this stuff is packed away now and no one can get to them." 
</P>
<P>
Tony Ramirez, chairman of the city's Cultural and Historical Landmark 
Commission, said the historical society is "a tremendous asset, and it is not 
forgotten about. . . . It is at a standstill until funds are available." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Williams has been trying to keep the society together. Its 
members hold meetings four times a year in the city library. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really tough keeping it going when you don't have a place of your own," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, a 30-year member of the group, has also been trying to make sure the 
community doesn't forget about the past. When the museum was operating out of 
City Hall, it provided tours to local schools, clubs and retirement homes and 
was a research base for high school and college students working on history 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
Now Williams takes the museum to them. With two boxes full of pictures dating 
back to the turn of the century and an endless supply of stories about Azusa's 
past, he visits local high school history classes. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to go to them to preserve the history and keep the kids interested," 
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Welker, meanwhile, says he worries about the future: "Most of our members are 
older, and a lot of them have died within the past few months. . . . I 
sometimes wonder if we're going to be around to see this new museum."

7 CAMPAIGN FOR 3 SEATS ON COUNCIL; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: CANDIDATES ARE DISCOVERING THAT VOTERS HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN THE CITY'S 
$10-MILLION ATTEMPT TO LAND THE RAIDERS.

IRWINDALE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Raiders may be bound for Oakland, but they're still casting a 
long shadow over Irwindale politics. 
</P>
<P>
As seven City Council candidates go door to door with campaign flyers and 
buttons, they're learning that residents haven't forgotten about the $10 
million the city paid to Raiders owner Al Davis more than two years ago in an 
ultimately unsuccessful attempt to land the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I had something to do with bringing (the Raiders) in," said Councilman Joseph 
Breceda, one of three incumbents running in the April 10 election. "(Voters) 
probably will blame me for trying to bring them in." 
</P>
<P>
With only 551 registered voters in Irwindale, the candidates face another 
challenge unique to the tiny city: the complex web of family alliances and 
rivalries that has governed local politics since the city's incorporation in 
1957. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates for the three council seats are: Breceda; Councilman Robert 
Diaz; Councilman Patricio Miranda; Fred Barbosa, whose lawsuit against the city 
barred officials from working on the Raiders stadium project for more than a 
year; Mike Miranda, who is Councilman Miranda's nephew; Jacquelyn Quintero, 
Breceda's niece; and Joseph Tapia, the brother of former Mayor Art Tapia. 
</P>
<P>
Breceda, a council member since 1972, refused to discuss his candidacy, saying, 
"I'm not committing myself on anything. The people have a lot of respect for 
me. I was born and raised in Irwindale. I belong to the VFW, the American 
Legion, the senior citizens." 
</P>
<P>
Diaz, 39, has served one term on the City Council. A teacher at Bell Gardens 
Elementary School, Diaz said he is concerned about the "unnecessary legal fees" 
the city paid to negotiate with the Raiders and to defend itself against 
lawsuits filed to block the stadium project. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, we have two city attorneys, in essence," Diaz said, referring to 
City Atty. Charles Martin, and Orange County lawyer R. Zaiden Corrado, who was 
hired to spearhead the Raiders deal and retained as a consultant on other 
projects. The Raiders bid dragged on for 18 months, until March 12, when 
Oakland officials announced Davis was moving his team to their city. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of time and attention has been diverted from more positive aspects in 
the community," Diaz said. 
</P>
<P>
Patricio Miranda, who served on the city's first Planning Commission in 1957 
and has been a councilman since 1961, is running for his eighth four-year term. 
While on the council, he said, he has seen development and redevelopment 
transform Irwindale into a thriving center of industry and commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"Irwindale has progressed greatly," Miranda said in a statement. "I have been 
able to . . . vote for many of the projects which can be seen as you look 
around Irwindale." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the challenge he is facing from the other candidates, Miranda 
has another opponent of sorts: Fred Lyte, Irwindale's former redevelopment 
consultant who was fired in late 1988 after a falling out with Miranda. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Lyte mailed letters to Irwindale residents in which he criticizes 
Miranda and reveals details of a conflict-of-interest lawsuit filed last year 
against the councilman by a resident. The lawsuit claims Miranda should have 
resigned from the city's redevelopment agency when it voted in 1987 to approve 
a land-lease agreement that stood to benefit him financially. Miranda abstained 
from the vote and has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Miranda said he believes voters will disregard Lyte's mail campaign. "A lot of 
the things in his letters, a lot of people in Irwindale know it's not true," 
Miranda said. 
</P>
<P>
Barbosa, 41, an operating engineer for Pomona-based Diversified Materials, is 
probably best known for obstructing Irwindale's multimillion-dollar bid to land 
the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Barbosa, along with Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi and a 
group of Irwindale residents, sued Irwindale to try to block the Raiders 
stadium project. A judge barred Irwindale from further negotiations until it 
completed an environmental impact report, which took more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
In his campaign literature, Barbosa attacked the City Council for giving Davis 
$10 million up front but failing to put together a viable stadium project. 
</P>
<P>
"Residents ask me, 'How can you run if you sued the city?' " Barbosa said. "I 
tell them I did it for the good of the community." 
</P>
<P>
Barbosa said he also wants to improve emergency services during major disasters 
and speed up adoption of the city's budget. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Miranda, 26, Patricio Miranda's nephew and son of Irwindale Police Chief 
Julian Miranda, is making his first run for public office. He said he's 
"shooting for independent votes." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to get a lot of them," he said. Miranda, who runs a professional 
golf shop at the Yorba Linda Country Club, said support from his uncle's allies 
may be thin because he received a $16,000 college scholarship from a private 
fund set up for Irwindale youths by Lyte and others. 
</P>
<P>
"My family knows I chitchat with Fred," he said. "People hold that against me. 
They think if I'm hired I'm going to bring back Fred Lyte." Miranda added that 
he has not received and doesn't expect his uncle's endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
He said he wants to "tighten the reins" on Irwindale city government, which he 
criticized as "ineffective" because some council members are related to city 
employees and department heads. 
</P>
<P>
Quintero, 31, a banker running for council for the fourth time, said she wants 
to improve employee morale in City Hall and require evaluations of all city 
employees. (Only police officers are now reviewed.) She also wants to tighten 
code enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Quintero, Breceda's niece, said Irwindale's licensing procedure "has been lax 
to the point of many, many businesses being without permits." As an example, 
she pointed to CalMat Co., a construction materials firm that for a time 
earlier this year hauled dirt from one gravel pit to another without a city 
permit, prompting complaints from residents and officials in Baldwin Park, 
which borders one of the pits. 
</P>
<P>
The seventh candidate, Joseph Tapia, 65, is a park maintenance employee for 
Irwindale, and the brother of former Mayor Tapia. He said he plans to retire 
from the Parks Department this year. If elected to the council, he said he 
would work to establish a child-care center and promote housing for senior 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Tapia said voters are "tired of lawsuits and stuff like that. I don't think 
it's in good taste. They were spending a lot of money when they first started 
with the Raiders."

<P>
7 CANDIDATES SHARE SINGLE VIEW ON MOST ISSUES

SIERRA MADRE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of this small town of 11,000 may find it hard to choose among the 
seven candidates for three City Council seats. 
</P>
<P>
All seven candidates in the April 10 election vow to protect the hillsides from 
development but to preserve private-property rights. All seven pledge to boost 
downtown revitalization but keep the small-town atmosphere. All seven want city 
services improved but not at the cost of higher taxes. And all seven believe 
Orange Grove Boulevard along the Arcadia-Sierra Madre border should be repaired 
but not widened as proposed by Arcadia officials. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the views are the same on the major issues," candidate Richard Freeman 
said at a recent political forum. "It's not really an election that can be won 
or lost on our views of the issues since they're not too different." 
</P>
<P>
Still, all the candidates have been gamely attending fried-chicken lunches and 
Women's Club forums, most of them devoid of political controversy or 
excitement. Thus, winners this year may be those who succeed in presenting 
themselves as more qualified, sincere, dedicated and informed on city issues 
than their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
By these criteria, incumbent Clem Bartolai, 53, may be a front-runner. 
Bartolai, an administrative manager for J. B. Engineering in Monrovia and a 
30-year Sierra Madre resident, was elected to the council in 1980 and in 1986. 
He has also served on the city's Parks and Recreation and Planning commissions. 
</P>
<P>
Bartolai stresses his accessibility to voters. As a councilman, he said, he 
initiated a hillside building moratorium, worked to get a gate installed on the 
Chantry Flats road to cut down on late-night traffic entering the Angeles 
National Forest and supported hiring a full-time city employee to enforce 
building codes. He estimates he has raised $2,500, the largest amount of any 
candidate so far. 
</P>
<P>
Bartolai is the only incumbent in the race. Mayor Bruce Crow and Councilwoman 
Lisa Fowler are not seeking re-election. The top three finishers in the April 
10 election will join the City Council, which will elect a new mayor from among 
its five members. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Adams, 50, a 22-year Sierra Madre resident, also may have an edge. Adams 
has been elected before, to the City Council in 1976 and to the Pasadena City 
College board of trustees in 1980. Early fund-raising garnered him $1,150, 
according to his Feb. 27 campaign disclosure statement. 
</P>
<P>
Adams, general manager of 49er Shops Inc., at Cal State Long Beach, holds a 
master's degree and doctorate in public administration from USC. He said his 
blend of education and business experience gives him an understanding of how to 
run the city in a businesslike fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman, 27, vice president of sales and marketing for San Diego-based Boat 
Kare Products Inc., is making his first run for political office. He is trying 
a rare approach to politicking, accepting no campaign contributions and 
promising to spend no money. Instead, he urges voters to donate the money they 
would give to candidates to charities or churches. The 12-year Sierra Madre 
resident hopes to convince voters that he is sincere and dedicated. Like 
Bartolai, he stresses his accessibility. 
</P>
<P>
MaryAnn MacGillivray, 42, marketing vice president and founder of Health Craft 
International Inc. of Pasadena, is also a political newcomer. She said she will 
run a low-budget campaign of less than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
An 18-year Sierra Madre resident, she has been a frequent speaker at City 
Council meetings, where she has supported protecting the hillsides against 
development. MacGillivray believes the city's administrative procedures should 
be streamlined and efficient and the city's recreational, cultural and 
educational facilities improved to establish a "high community profile' for 
Sierra Madre. 
</P>
<P>
Stockbroker Larry Peal, 45, a 21-year Sierra Madre resident, despite being a 
political newcomer, speaks with ease on a variety of local issues. They include 
improving communication between the council and city management; revamping the 
city's unpopular proposed tree-trimming ordinance to apply only to new 
projects; and limiting the number of new city ordinances, which he believes are 
overburdening city workers. He estimates he will spend $450 on the campaign, 
with some family contributions of services. Peal is vice president of A. G. 
Edwards in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Aksel Pedersen, 60, a 23-year Sierra Madre resident, is making his first try 
for public office because, he said, he owes the city his services. A former Los 
Angeles County deputy sheriff and investigator with the Los Angeles District 
Attorney's Office, Pedersen is now a vice president with Progressive Savings 
Bank in Pasadena. Pedersen said he plans to spend less than $1,000 on the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Pedersen wants to expand the downtown business district to include Montecito 
Avenue, the site of Sierra Madre's largest employer, Scott Aviation. He also 
wants the Chamber of Commerce and the Main Street Program to merge for more 
effective downtown revitalization. 
</P>
<P>
William Tice, 52, a self-employed gardener and 14-year Sierra Madre resident, 
is taking a folksy approach. At one political forum, Tice stretched a tape 
measure 18 inches to emphasize that building inspectors should take accurate 
measurements in order to avoid hitting gas lines. His suggestions for upgrading 
the central business district include cobblestone paving and landscaping. Like 
Freeman, Tice is not accepting campaign contributions, but a friend has printed 
flyers on his behalf, which constitutes an in-kind campaign contribution. 
</P>
<P>
A candidates forum is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at City Hall, 232 W. 
Sierra Madre Blvd. The forum will be broadcast live on local cable television. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to choosing among the seven candidates, Sierra Madre voters must 
also decide on two ballot measures. 
</P>
<P>
One measure, introduced by Bartolai, would limit council members to two 
consecutive four-year terms in office. After an absence of two or more years, 
former council members could run again. The vote is an advisory measure that 
the council could enact later if it passes by a majority vote. No arguments 
against the measure were submitted for the sample ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The second ballot measure asks city voters to raise their property taxes 8.5 
cents for every $100 of assessed value to help pay for paramedic service to 
supplement the volunteer Fire Department's emergency medical technicians. The 
measure requires a two-thirds vote for approval. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents insist that the city's current emergency medical technicians provide 
adequate service. They say the cost, estimated at $450,000 the first year and 
$350,000 annually thereafter, is too high. Supporters believe that residents 
should pay to upgrade the city's emergency medical care.

</P>
<P>
EAST-WEST: THE JAPANESE PURCHASE A STAKE IN U.S. HIGHER EDUCATION. A 
HALF-JAPANESE, HALF-AMERICAN STUDENT BODY MERGES IN THE MOUNTAIN STATE.

SALEM, W.V. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The circular announces a seminar at the local college, not the topic you might 
expect for what appears to be a typical Appalachian mountain hamlet: "Japanese 
and Americans: Likes/Dislikes, Values, Customs, Differences." 
</P>
<P>
Ever since last July, when Salem College announced a merger with Japan's Teikyo 
University, things unexpected have become the norm. Now, the town (population 
2,200), along with the renamed Salem Teikyo University, prepares for the April 
arrival of its first wave of Japanese matriculants. 
</P>
<P>
The school currently has only 400 students, so enrollment of about 200 Japanese 
will have a substantial, immediate impact. More important, unlike a typical 
study-abroad program, Salem and Teikyo have become as one. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, the deal was a desperately needed financial shot in the arm for 
Salem, having been in a decades-long struggle for survival. The college, with 
no endowment, was "traditionally the poorest private college in West Virginia 
and all of Appalachia," said Dr. Ronald Ohl, who headed the old school and is 
now president of Salem Teikyo University. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese university will eventually pump $20 million into Salem Teikyo, 
enabling the school to pay off its debts, with enough left over for a healthy 
$7.5 million endowment. If all goes according to plan, the reconstituted 
university will have a 1995 student body of 1,000, half American, half 
Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
For Teikyo, a relatively new (1966) Tokyo-based university, the merger is part 
of an ambitious plan to develop relationships with a number of foreign 
universities. In the United States, Iowa-based Westmar College was 
"reorganized, not merged" in early March to become Teikyo Westmar University. 
And in Denver, Teikyo purchased one of Regis College's seven campuses for a 
reported $7 million -- it has been renamed as Teikyo Loretto Heights -- to 
begin a joint program in Pacific studies. Both colleges will welcome several 
hundred Japanese students this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Teikyo's role at Salem, however, is far deeper. Teikyo University Foundation 
has taken title to the college's physical assets; the board of trustees now 
numbers three Japanese and two Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The architect of these programs is Teikyo University President Shoichi Okinaga, 
an aggressive proponent of kokusai, the movement for internationalizing the 
Japanese higher-educational system, begun about 15 year ago. 
</P>
<P>
One of the main goals is to establish a presence in the United States. Okinaga 
began the process about two years ago, contacting about 30 U.S. colleges and 
universities. Salem immediately expressed interest. Okinaga cited the main 
attractions of West Virginia: a low crime rate, "the warmth of its people" and 
a surfeit of available space. 
</P>
<P>
Space is important, say Japanese educational experts. Private universities in 
Japan, especially those in Tokyo, are hamstrung by lack of room to build new 
classrooms and libraries. 
</P>
<P>
There is also the delicate matter of how much profit Teikyo expects from its 
U.S. ventures. Gail Chambers, a University of Rochester researcher currently 
studying U.S.-Japanese educational operations, says "the economic motive is 
present" in every case she has examined. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever Teikyo's motives, a number of influential U.S. figures, including Sen. 
Jay Rockefeller (D-W.V.), are more than pleased. Rockefeller, who studied in 
Japan and speaks some Japanese, promoted Salem's advantages to the Teikyo 
representatives as the deal was being negotiated. He has credited Okinaga with 
"furthering international understanding through educational opportunity." 
Rockefeller, West Virginia Gov. Gaston Caperton and Okinaga will receive 
honorary degrees from the university at commencement exercises this spring. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, as is the case with most high-profile Japanese investments, 
some Americans are suspicious -- of the merger and of Teikyo's intentions. 
Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., a former U.S. trade official and author of the book 
"Trading Places: How We Allowed Japan to Take the Lead," said that while he 
agrees that educational exchanges have value, "you don't have to buy a college 
to send students abroad." An aide to Sen. John H. Heinz III (R-Pa.), who has 
also been critical of the U.S. trade relationship with Japan, said the merger 
"is significant in a symbolic sense, like the purchase of Rockefeller Center." 
</P>
<P>
But President Ohl, who once studied philosophy under Reinhold Niebhur and Paul 
Tillich, sees experiments like Salem as the antidote for such skepticism. "The 
only way you're going to counter fear, in either country, is by learning to 
work with each other," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To ensure as much cultural integration as possible, all students will have to 
share common dormitories, although incoming Japanese will be sectioned-off 
during an initial semester of intensive English instruction. 
</P>
<P>
Next month, Salem Teikyo will embark on a three-semester system, characteristic 
of Japanese universities. The school will also introduce a modular program -- 
students focused exclusively on one subject area for three weeks at a time. 
"The curriculum is designed to break down barriers that usually exist in 
study-abroad programs," Ohl said. 
</P>
<P>
Emi Hirano, one of a handful of Japanese already on campus, said her incoming 
classmates might be in for a bit of shock. "I couldn't believe it, this place 
is nothing but hills," said Hirano, a freshman. The school's equestrian 
program, of all things, was what won her affection. "In Tokyo," she said, "it 
is too expensive to own a horse." 
</P>
<P>
What encourages Ohl is how well Hirano and the other Japanese students seem to 
be getting along with the Americans. "One of the Japanese girls even has an 
American boyfriend," he said, somewhat proudly. But Hirano knows that the 
social dynamics could quickly change when the first large contingent of 
students begins to arrive from Japan. "I hope the U.S. kids don't become 
afraid," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ohl said he anticipated some student resentment, in part because academic 
standards have stiffened. The average SAT score at Salem is an undistinguished 
700; the goal is to raise that as much as 400 points over the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately," Ohl acknowledged, "many of those already here will not feel 
comfortable with the new standards, or with the increasing 
internationalization. That should change with future classes." 
</P>
<P>
In town, the joke making the rounds a few months ago had to do with the way one 
pronounces Teikyo -- "as in take-you," said one Salem wag. Mayor Donna Stewart 
has worked hard, asking people to be patient: "The biggest fear I have is that 
people will not take the time to understand people who don't speak English 
well." Expectations that the coming of the Japanese will trigger a boom in the 
local real-estate market have not yet materialized; informed sources report 
more talk than sales activity. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, townspeople seem less concerned than some Washington pundits. Retiree 
Harry Oberstadt, who fought in the South Pacific in World War II, asked, "We're 
sending our kids over there and everywhere else, so why shouldn't they come 
here?"

THE BRAWLING ON THE BENCH BY JUSTICES WHO MUST DECIDE THE LAW OF THE LAND; 
</P>
<P>
SUPREME COURT: PERSONAL INVECTIVE AMONG JUSTICES HAS REACHED A NEW LEVEL OF 
SHRILLNESS, AND IT MAY UNDERCUT THE INTEGRITY OF THEIR RULINGS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If recent history is any guide, by June the Supreme Court justices will be 
sour, sullen and snarling at each other in their opinions. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Justice Antonin Scalia called Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's 
position in an abortion case "irrational," "perverse," "indecisive" and so 
fatuous it "cannot be taken seriously." And they were voting on the same side. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Harry A. Blackmun was no less circumspect in dissenting from the 
court's decision to cut back abortion rights. He called Chief Justice William 
H. Rehnquist's plurality opinion "unadulterated nonsense" reeking with 
"cowardice and illegitimacy." 
</P>
<P>
Still, life at the Supreme Court is rather chummy these days. Compared, that 
is, with the way it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
Consider James C. McReynolds, a choleric, anti-Semitic right-winger. He gave 
Louis D. Brandeis the silent treatment from 1916 until 1939 and left the room 
when Brandeis spoke at conference. 
</P>
<P>
Brandeis took this serenely. "McReynolds is one of the most interesting men on 
the present court," he told Felix Frankfurter. "I watch his face closely and at 
times, with his good features, he has a look of manly beauty, of intellectual 
beauty, and at other times he looks like a moron . . . . I have seen him 
struggle painfully to think and to express himself and he just can't do it 
coherently." 
</P>
<P>
By 1946, Franklin D. Roosevelt's court had broken out into such bitter personal 
feuding that then-President Harry S. Truman lamented, "The Supreme Court has 
really made a mess of itself." 
</P>
<P>
It's less a mess now. But the philosophical divisions are as passionate as 
ever. And if the antagonisms have run deeper in the past, they have seldom been 
so public. Opinions of the last two years contain some of the most vituperative 
attacks on other justices in court history. 
</P>
<P>
The meanest season is June and early July, when the big decisions are 
published. But there have already been eruptions. Dissenting from a 5-4 
decision that made it easier for prosecutors to exclude blacks from juries, 
Justice Thurgood Marshall accused the majority of condoning "racial 
discrimination in our system of criminal justice." 
</P>
<P>
Scalia, writing for the majority, shot back: "Justice Marshall's dissent rolls 
out the ultimate weapon, the accusation of insensitivity to racial 
discrimination -- which will lose its intimidating effect if it continues to be 
fired so randomly." 
</P>
<P>
A mild exchange, considering Blackmun's comparison of Rehnquist's majority 
opinion in one civil-rights case last year with the "sterile formalism . . . 
that infected . . . the antebellum judges who denied relief to fugitive 
slaves." 
</P>
<P>
Or Blackmun's dissent in a decision to curb job-discrimination suits that seek 
proportional hiring and promoting of qualified minorities or women: "One 
wonders whether the majority still believes that race discrimination -- or, 
more accurately, race discrimination against nonwhites -- is a problem in our 
society, or even remembers that it ever was." 
</P>
<P>
While Scalia and Blackmun prefer the sledgehammer, others pick up the stiletto. 
In the job-discrimination case, Justice Byron R. White's majority opinion 
quoted a 14-year-old concurrence warning that unduly broad liability could 
force employers into "a subjective quota system of employment selection . . . 
far from the intent" of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
The author? Harry A. Blackmun. White's implicit message: "Dear Harry: Please 
can the sanctimony. You used to agree with what we are saying now. You were 
right then." 
</P>
<P>
Such oblique jabs, often the work of law clerks, have long been routine. 
Justices typically take them and even the more combative rhetoric less 
personally than an outsider might suppose. But Scalia's excoriation of O'Connor 
in the abortion case was a watershed in vituperation. 
</P>
<P>
The verbal pyrotechnics reflect the confluence of two recent trends. Justices 
have become much more willing to vent personal views in public. And since the 
court's philosophical balance tipped with President Reagan's 1988 appointment 
of Anthony M. Kennedy to succeed Powell, a new conservative majority has taken 
the offensive on such divisive issues as abortion, affirmative action, the 
death penalty and church and state. Liberals like Blackmun and Marshall do not 
practice verbal restraint when hearing their deepest convictions spurned and 
their life's work trashed. And the conservatives have sometimes angrily 
divided, with O'Connor the most frequently accused of apostasy. 
</P>
<P>
How can these people sit down and reason together? They don't. Indeed, they 
haven't for decades. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, the justices reason separately, each working through cases, drafting 
opinions. Once or twice a week, they meet to state positions and count votes, 
but there is little debate or persuasion. 
</P>
<P>
Rehnquist once said justices are "as independent as hogs on ice." The truth is 
that justices don't have to harmonize well to do the work. 
</P>
<P>
"The force of the institution is quite strong," said a recent law clerk. "They 
shake hands every time they walk into the conference room . . . . Do they love 
each other? No. But they get along, because they couldn't get the work done if 
they didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Court insiders discern no deep, personal animosities this year among the 
combatants in last year's battles. The court has survived personal feuds far 
more rancorous than any seen lately. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1940s, four Roosevelt appointees splintered into warring camps, with 
Justices Frankfurter and Robert H. Jackson, advocates of judicial restraint, 
allied against William O. Douglas and Hugo Black, the leading judicial 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
The climax was a public attack on Black in 1946 by Jackson, who hungered to 
succeed Harlan Fiske Stone as chief justice. Bitterly disappointed when Truman 
gave the job to Fred M. Vinson after Stone's death, Jackson blamed Black for 
plotting against him. He sent a public letter to Congress savaging Black for 
failing to disqualify himself in a case involving his former law partner. 
</P>
<P>
Frankfurter especially galled his former friend, Douglas. In a 1954 memorandum, 
Douglas complained that Frankfurter had "rather insolently" refused to answer 
his question at conference that day. "We all know what a great burden your long 
discourses are," Douglas wrote. "So I am not complaining. But I do register a 
protest at your degradation of the conference and its deliberations." 
</P>
<P>
In 1960, Douglas drafted but never sent a memo to his colleagues complaining of 
"the continuous violent outbursts against me in conference by my Brother 
Frankfurter," saying that "in the interest of his health and long life I have 
reluctantly concluded to participate in no more conferences while he is on the 
court." 
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, who retired in 1986, had strained relations 
with several colleagues, especially his boyhood friend Blackmun. Once Richard 
M. Nixon's clone on the court, the prickly Blackmun drifted leftward and sparks 
flew. In a 1986 speech, Blackmun criticized Burger's approach to assigning 
opinions: "If one's in the doghouse with the chief, he gets the crud." 
</P>
<P>
Justices don't have to be good friends to do great things. For all the 
Frankfurter-Jackson-Black-Douglas rancor, Earl Warren got them to join in the 
greatest single act in the court's history -- the 1954 opinion finding school 
segregation unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
But there is still a serious cost to public brawling on the bench: The more the 
justices question each other's basic common sense and good faith, the more they 
may deplete the reservoir of popular good will that is so essential to their 
singular role in American life. They might eventually find their rulings 
dismissed as the work of unelected, unprincipled politicians. 
</P>
<P>
That would be a shame, because public respect for the court is fundamentally 
well-placed. The justices' constitutional interpretations owe more to political 
ideologies than they pretend. But far more than Congress, far more than any 
recent President, justices reach decisions by searching their consciences, 
sifting facts and law, trying to do right as they see right. 
</P>
<P>
In the court's marble temple, the transient and often unwise public passions 
that drive elections have far less sway than under the Capitol Dome or in the 
White House. At the court, there is none of the selling of influence for 
campaign contributions that has soiled the legislative and executive branches. 
</P>
<P>
For all its flaws, the court brings an element of integrity to a government 
sorely in need of it. Forceful disagreement on matters of principle enhance 
that role. Inflammatory, personal attacks diminish it.

This perception has some basis in fact. Transportation planners document 
increased congestion on our freeways and report that this trend will continue. 
</P>
<P>
Housing experts lament the current shortfall in affordable housing and project 
a regionwide demand of 1 million new low- and moderate-cost units between now 
and 2010. 
</P>
<P>
We are running out of places to put our waste. Our public school system does 
not have enough money to construct new schools or expand existing ones. 
</P>
<P>
And, despite adopting the most stringent air-quality plan in the country, we 
are still unlikely to meet federal standards. 
</P>
<P>
These problems are solvable if, first, we understand their causes, and second, 
we are willing to make some fundamental changes in the way we plan for, shape 
and finance our man-made and natural environment. 
</P>
<P>
Three factors contribute to current and projected problems: 
</P>
<P>
First, the number of people and jobs will continue to increase. This growth is 
caused by powerful economic and social forces; it will not be stopped. For 
example, two-thirds of the projected population increase in Southern California 
will be home-grown -- births among people already living here. Even the most 
Draconian restrictions on foreign and domestic immigration would not prevent a 
population growth of more than 3 million during the next 20 years. Economists 
project close to 3 million new jobs, fueled by international trade and growth 
in business services. Other new jobs will grow out of the need to provide goods 
and services for an expanding population. 
</P>
<P>
Second, our problems are the result of declining federal, state and local 
investment. Federal support for affordable housing, nationwide, shrank from $26 
billion in 1981 to $7.5 billion in 1987, while federal tax policy sharply 
curtailed incentives to build apartments. Because of decreasing state 
investment in transportation, California now ranks 50th among 50 states in 
per-capita spending on highways. The Bush Administration's new transportation 
policy reduces federal participation in most transit and highway funds. This 
means state and local government will be expected to raise billions more for 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Third, Californians have an anachronistic collective image of the ideal 
metropolitan area. Anthony Downs of the Brookings Institution articulates this 
ideal vision: ownership of a detached, single-family home on a spacious lot; 
unlimited personal use of a private automobile; suburban workplaces with ample 
free parking, and strong local governments to control police power, land use, 
public schools and other amenities. We have clung to this image despite the 
obvious fact that Los Angeles has become one of the world's major metropolitan 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
Understanding a problem is key to its solution. In the study of these issues, 
we have come to several important conclusions: 
</P>
<P>
Growth is both inevitable and from most perspectives, desirable. That growth, 
however, must be planned and managed. 
</P>
<P>
Current investment is critical to future improvements. 
</P>
<P>
The ideal of a low-density, sprawling, semiurban landscape -- and the lifestyle 
it implies -- is already inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
If growth must be planned and managed, then who will do it? Transportation and 
environmental-quality issues transcend city-county boundaries; critically 
needed regional facilities are often rejected at the local level -- "not in my 
back yard." Because their authority and responsibility is limited by geographic 
boundaries, cities and counties cannot always be expected to act responsibly on 
broader regional needs. (There are 86 municipalities in Los Angeles County 
alone.) 
</P>
<P>
Nor can special-purpose agencies plan for and manage these issues. There are 
now 72 federal, state and local agencies issuing environmental decisions and 
regulations in Southern California; 69 of them are either single-purpose bodies 
or fragmented functions of general-purpose governments. These agencies are 
limited in scope and not generally accountable to -- or representative of -- 
the electorate. Single-purpose agencies, like the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District, do not have the capacity or representation to balance 
properly all the region's legitimate but competing interests. 
</P>
<P>
It is time to restructure the decision- making process so that decision-makers 
can understand how one proposed solution to one problem impacts other issues. 
What are the socioeconomic consequences of implementing environmental 
regulations? What are the consequences of waste-disposal decisions on air and 
water quality? 
</P>
<P>
The 2000 Partnership advocates consolidating current fragmented and ineffective 
regional planning so that citizens can understand the process and hold elected 
officials accountable. We believe comprehensive planning is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
We recommend consideration of a regional agency that would determine goals and 
incentives but minimize regulations imposed regionwide; site critically needed 
regional infrastructure in cases of impasse or inaction at the local or 
subregional level, and act as trustee for making and implementing policies when 
a city, county or special district fails to meet regional objectives over a 
period of years. This agency would also play a role in ensuring that the region 
has sufficient revenues from Sacramento to implement its decisions. 
</P>
<P>
In our view, existing single-purpose regional agencies should operate 
consistent with policies adopted by the regional planning body. Conflict 
resolution would occur through subregional mechanisms and, ultimately, at the 
regional level. The regional agency would be governed by a mixed board -- some 
directly elected representatives and some selected from among elected local 
government officials. 
</P>
<P>
Any regional entity must properly reflect the region's diverse population; its 
board must comply with constitutional standards for proportional 
representation. Both principles are largely ignored by existing regional 
entities. 
</P>
<P>
An essential ingredient in this prescription for the future is creation of a 
reliable funding base for infrastructure improvement and enhancement. Without 
more public investment our region will deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
By themselves, governance changes and policy changes will not be enough. For a 
decade and a half, politicians have assumed that California voters are 
unwilling to invest in their own future. 
</P>
<P>
There are recent indications of a shift in public mood. Gov. George Deukmejian, 
along with a coalition of legislative leaders and diverse interest groups, 
placed Propositions 108 and 111 on the June ballot to raise money for 
transportation. We need it -- a step in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
Speaker Brown is also moving in the right direction. His bill, AB 4242, 
provides the framework for the necessary debate on these issues -- the first 
step in a process that could give us 21st-Century governance to manage present 
and future problems. 
</P>
<P>
Consolidating existing agencies will make the political process more 
intelligible and elected officials more accountable. With better governance and 
greater investment, California can hold promise and hope for all citizens.

OUR COSTLY NUCLEAR FOLLIES, FROM SEABROOK TO SAN LUIS OBISPO; 
</P>
<P>
ATOM POWER: CAN WE AVOID STAGGERING OVERRUNS ON SUCH PROJECTS AS DIABLO CANYON, 
WHICH COST BILLIONS MORE THAN ESTIMATES? YES: TELL THE TRUTH.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the last skirmishes die in court, the Seabrook, N.H., nuclear power plant is 
close to being turned on. Its construction and licensing took 18 bitter years 
of protest, lawsuits, plummeting bond ratings and finally the bankruptcy of its 
major owner, the Public Service Co. of New Hampshire. Originally estimated at 
$500 million in 1968, the plant by now has cost $6.45 billion -- and counting. 
</P>
<P>
Seabrook is not the only nuclear plant -- or the only major construction 
project -- to experience staggering cost overruns. The two Diablo Canyon 
nuclear plants in San Luis Obispo were scheduled to cost $350 million; they 
totalled $5.5 billion when they started up in 1985. The Shoreham nuclear power 
plant on Long Island, N.Y., was first proposed in 1966 at a cost of $75 
million. It finally cost $5.7 billion to build, and will never operate. 
</P>
<P>
To take an example of another sort, the trash-to-energy incinerator where my 
garbage wends its humble way each week was estimated in 1982 to cost $17 per 
ton incinerated. This year my town will pay $111 per ton for its services. 
</P>
<P>
Massive cost overruns like these are not isolated phenomena. They occur so 
regularly and systematically that they should come as no surprise. They happen 
with incinerators, dams, highways, large power plants -- any project that 
provokes significant public opposition. In industrial quarters it is taken as 
simple truth that the cost overruns are due to the senseless harassment of 
environmentalists. Environmentalists know with equal certainty that the fault 
lies with industry's shortsightedness and arrogance. The overruns are greatest 
in the nuclear industry, they would say, because that industry is the most 
shortsighted and arrogant of all. 
</P>
<P>
Both arguments are self-serving, both are exaggerated -- and both are partly 
right. Citizen obstinacy and industrial myopia work together to create 
spiraling costs -- costs not only in money but in social cohesion. 
</P>
<P>
Seabrook is a classic example of this spiral. Here's how it works: 
</P>
<P>
1) The proponents of a project vastly underestimate its cost, partly because 
they want to sell the project, partly because they are blind to many real 
costs, especially environmental costs. Nor do they account for the time and 
effort it takes to persuade (as opposed to brainwash) the public to accept a 
project -- or to change the project so that it becomes acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
2) A go-ahead decision is made, usually by a small group of officials, on the 
basis of incomplete information. At this stage the public is only dimly aware 
of the project. That fact is already a sign of mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
3) Land acquisitions begin, bulldozers move and the people wake up -- starting 
with those who live across the street. Puzzled citizens turn angry as they 
learn what has been planned without their involvement. In order to stop the 
desecration of their neighborhood (usually the only motivation at first), they 
invoke higher environmental concerns to threaten a larger community. That 
brings in more opponents. 
</P>
<P>
4) As intervenors begin to insist on safeguards and environmental protection, 
officials stonewall. They deny that such measures are at all necessary. (A 
favorite argument of Seabrook proponents has been that an evacuation plan is 
not important because the plant will never have an accident.) The public 
persists, industry resists, both sides distort truth. This is the time when 
someone goes to court and expenses begin to mount. 
</P>
<P>
5) Lawyers, bureaucrats and expert studies eat up money. Worse, they eat up 
time with the interest-clock ticking. Interest is the primary ballooner of 
costs, especially when the project is funded by high-interest junk bonds, as 
Seabrook largely was. The more delays, the more doubt that the project can 
succeed, the more debt piles up, the higher the interest rate on the next 
borrowing. Cost-inflation goes into runaway mode. In the early 1980s, the 
Harvard Business School regularly used Seabrook as a case study, asking 
students to predict when the plant would drive its owners bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
6) With opponents locked eyeball to eyeball, the real environmental risks of 
the project may be revealed by a spectacular disaster somewhere else (such as 
Chernobyl). Regulations are tightened, new precautions are mandated (such as 
evacuation plans). Industry complains that regulators are changing the rules in 
the middle of the game -- which they are. But in truth the original rules have 
been revealed as insufficient for public protection. Intervenors, still trying 
to kill the project altogether, seize this opportunity to press for new 
regulations that are impossibly stringent. 
</P>
<P>
So it goes, round after round -- citizen action, industry resistance, 
bureaucratic procedures, higher interest. All the participants except the 
intervenors are well paid -- which makes it particularly unjust to blame 
environmentalists alone for the spiraling costs. They play their role, but 
often at great cost to themselves. Others are fighting for profits or power; 
citizen intervenors are fighting for their homes, their neighborhoods, the 
health of their children, the integrity of nature. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a project, or a killed project, costing far more than it would 
have cost to do the project right, or kill it, in the first place. The result 
is also a divided community, each side blaming the other for the mess everyone 
has created together. Furthermore, seasoned and skilled troops of warriors have 
been formed on both sides; in the manner of all warriors, they go off to find 
new battles. One reason the Seabrook battle was particularly protracted was 
that it came late and attracted combatants who already had years of practice 
promoting, or opposing, nuclear plants elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Is there any way to stop this unnecessary squandering of time, dollars, effort 
and communities? The only one I can see is to tell the truth about a project 
from the beginning, to include community and environmental considerations right 
away, to respect and involve the public and to be willing to pay full costs, 
including costs of environmental protection. 
</P>
<P>
Doing all that might stop the project before it ever gets started, you say. 
</P>
<P>
It might indeed, which is better than stopping it after billions are invested. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the project goes, you say, all those preparations and precautions will 
be outrageously expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, they will. They will bring the cost of the project up somewhere near its 
actual cost to society. But that cost will not be nearly so high as the cost of 
denial, public opposition, litigation, delay and lasting bitterness.

CONTROVERSY OVER LEGALIZATION OF DRUGS IN AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his column describing the impact of drug cases upon the judicial system 
("Assembly Line Justice Threatens the Whole System," March 13), State Bar 
President Alan I. Rothenberg correctly states that the flood of drug cases 
threatens the capacity of our legal system to resolve criminal and civil 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Superior Court is already overloaded with criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
The number of criminal felony matters has increased at an alarming rate, from 
20,420 in 1980 to 51,307 last year, an increase of 151% in just 10 years. 
Although the California Judicial Council says we need 47 more judges just to 
handle our current workload, the state Legislature has turned down our requests 
for additional judgeships and for funds to construct much needed courtroom 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Since the law gives criminal cases priority over other matters, we must assign 
many felony cases to judges who ordinarily hear non-criminal cases. This 
judicial juggling act results in a steady decline in the number of judges and 
courtrooms available to hear civil, family law, juvenile, probate and other 
non-criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
Until lawmakers are willing to take decisive action, the Los Angeles Superior 
Court will continue to be buried in the avalanche of drug and other felony 
cases to the detriment of law-abiding litigants with civil and other matters.

CONTROVERSY OVER LEGALIZATION OF DRUGS IN AMERICA

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Film at 11, but Not Much Protection," by former New York City 
Police Commissioner, Patrick Murphy, March 13: 
</P>
<P>
He advocates additional police officers "on the beat" and greater cooperation 
by the public at the neighborhood level. Amen to that. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy does not make a distinction between legalization and decriminalization 
of drugs, but there is a big difference -- to "legalize" would put government 
in the position of condoning drug use. To "decriminalize" has government 
saying, in essence, that it's none of government's business if one wants to 
diminish his well-being with drug use. 
</P>
<P>
If drugs were freely available in a free market there would not be big profits 
and no need for a black market. Who would push drugs if there was little profit 
to be had? 
</P>
<P>
But admittedly, the decriminalization of drugs is a short-term solution. The 
long-term solution depends upon education -- that people will know the evils of 
drug use and say "no."

Two disparate views are expressed regarding the legalization of drug addiction 
-- yes, addiction not usage (March 12). If we legalize usage, we legalize 
addiction. 
</P>
<P>
Let's keep that in mind. Federal Judge Robert A. Sweet argues for it, and Midge 
Decter argues against it. Thank you, Ms. Decter, for your very cogent 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
A country's laws reflect society's values. If we value the health and 
well-being of our babies and youth, we must send out the message that 
self-destruction is not a value, and will not be legally tolerated. We are in a 
war against drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Sweet states, "When government gets involved in protecting people from 
themselves, the opportunities for mischief are plentiful." You are the 
mischief-maker, Judge Sweet, to expound such nonsense. Who protects children 
from themselves, and crack-addicted babies born of mothers over 21? Who 
protects teen-agers who are too young for legal drugs, but not too young to 
obtain from them parents and peers? 
</P>
<P>
I say drug addiction is an evil. I say it is morally and ethically wrong to 
condone it with legal sanctions just because we're tired of the alternative!

At last! Your splendid series has moved the debate beyond rehash and rhetoric 
to a serious weighing of the risks and benefits of decriminalization. 
</P>
<P>
Like democracy as a form of government, decriminalization is surely the worst 
form of drug control except for all those other forms of repression that we're 
now trying. And when Decter calls advocates of decriminalization "would-be 
engineers of human conduct," and Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates (March 
15) labels them "treasonous," we can see what the war on drugs really is: a 
make-believe Armageddon between two kinds of addicts -- those addicted to 
drugs, and those addicted to force.

Regarding the article by Sweet: I'll bet the drug dealers who come before him 
in court feel pretty lucky. Two often used quotations come to mind: "Putting 
the cart before the horse," and "Throwing the baby out with the bathwater." The 
costs of alcohol are a poor track record for legitimizing drugs.

I sympathize with Judge Sweet's frustrations. Prior to taking the bench, I was 
a federal prosecutor. I remember in 1980 when I started prosecuting narcotics 
cases that a kilo of cocaine went for approximately $45,000 in Miami, and that 
in early 1989 when I left the U. S. attorney's office in Los Angeles that a 
kilo of cocaine went for approximately $12,000. I also remember that during the 
same time period, a big "bust" went from a 10-kilo bust to 500 and up kilos. 
However, Judge Sweet's solution is not the answer. 
</P>
<P>
In order to have any possibility of success, we would have to legalize all 
illicit drugs from steroids to crystal methamphetamines (so-called ice). Unless 
we gave away the drugs free there would always be those who would commit crimes 
to pay for the drugs, and unless we made all drugs available to all regardless 
of age or other factors there would always be those that would make them 
available illegally. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly enough, Sweet and other advocates of legalization never address 
the issue of logistics -- just how are we going to implement the legalization. 
In other words, who would manufacture it? Who would distribute it? Who would 
set the price? Would they be given away free? Who could buy them? What about 
addicts? Would there be a restriction as to who could buy them other than 
adults? What about foreign travelers? These are just a few of the many 
questions that need to be addressed by those advocates of legalization. 
</P>
<P>
My personal feeling is that to legalize all forms of illicit drugs would mean 
the end of our society as we know it. More needs to be done in education, 
rehabilitation, and research. In addition, we need to do more to provide viable 
alternative employment opportunities to our youth. We need leadership that can 
address this very complex issue and not simple solutions.

<P>
On the whole, we in the United States consider ourselves to be a civilized 
nation. We are proud of our democratic heritage and our belief that we are a 
fair and just society. Yet when it comes to the issue of capital punishment, we 
often take leave of our senses. 
</P>
<P>
Out of frustration, justifiable anger and fear, our perception becomes clouded. 
We have a rash tendency to focus in on the offender -- to the exclusion of all 
else. Our cry for the death penalty places the United States in isolation from 
virtually all of the world's democracies and in the company of the worst 
dictatorships. Nonetheless, regardless of its clear lack of benefit, in spite 
of viable alternatives to its use and in spite of the offensive company with 
which it places us, capital punishment is a reality in our civilized society. 
</P>
<P>
Whether one agrees or disagrees with capital punishment, it cannot be disputed 
that death is different from all other criminal sanctions that we impose. The 
death penalty is final, irrevocable and leaves no room for error. We must be 
absolutely certain that the criminal defendant is tried fairly and that guilt 
is determined beyond a reasonable doubt. Under our system of justice, we 
attempt to ensure this by providing jury trials and a layered process of 
appeals. We have been admittedly fallible people struggling to attain 
infallible judgments. 
</P>
<P>
But times are changing. In our frustration over violent crime and in our fervor 
to exact death as a punishment for murder, our cry has been to shorten or do 
away with the appellate process for those convicted of murder. In our passion 
for the death penalty, we no longer view the appellate process as a safeguard 
against miscarriages of justice. Instead, we view appeals as a delaying tactic 
employed by "criminals" to thwart our final judgments or as an unnecessary 
obstacle to justice. Our cries for quicker executions are being heard by our 
elected officials and our criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
With the approval -- indeed, the urging -- of Chief Justice William H. 
Rehnquist, the Supreme Court is finding ways to drastically limit or eliminate 
death-row appeals. In recent decisions, the court has arbitrarily narrowed the 
grounds on which condemned defendants can appeal and severly limited the means 
by which such appeals may be pursued. Obdurate procedural rules are being 
stringently enforced to bar judicial review of legitimate errors, entire 
appeals and any newly discovered evidence that may come to light in a case. The 
same court has determined that states need not provide attorneys to represent 
the condemned on appeal (mental retardation and illiteracy notwithstanding). 
</P>
<P>
Fundamental fairness and justice are no longer our overriding concerns. Only 
our frustrated cry for finality matters. 
</P>
<P>
Last year a majority of the Supreme Court justices recognized that there is "a 
high incidence of uncorrected error" in capital cases and that a "substantial 
portion of these prisoners succeed in having their death sentences vacated in 
habeas corpus proceedings . . . " Two years ago, a study in the Stanford Law 
Review pointed out that since the turn of the century, at least 23 innocent 
people have been wrongfully executed in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Even under today's allegedly "reliable" capital punishment statutes, innocent 
people have been sentenced to death. Just last year the cases of Jerry Bigelow 
in California, James Richardson in Florida, Timothy Hennis in North Carolina, 
Randall Dale Adams in Texas, and this year the case of Clarence Brandley in 
Texas stand as testaments to our fallibility. Their innocence was discovered 
through totally fortuitous circumstances and not through the normal operation 
of the appellate system. 
</P>
<P>
In virtually every case, the only reason innocent death-row prisoners had not 
been executed before their innocence was proved was the "delay" occasioned by 
pending appeals or post-conviction proceedings on other issues -- the very 
delays condemned by Chief Justice Rehnquist and a majority of the public. 
</P>
<P>
Out of frustration, we seek to circumvent the only process in place that 
affords any safeguard against miscarriages of justice. In capital cases, where 
life is at stake, we must ensure that our judgments of death are correct. If we 
must have a death penalty, then we cannot let our anger and frustration blind 
us to our own fallibility.

A DEATHLY SILENCE, TO COVER WHAT?; 
</P>
<P>
IRAQ: THE REGIME CAME UP WITH A BRUTAL CIRCUS TO DIVERT ATTENTION FROM ITS 
EFFORTS, LIKE THOSE GOING ON IN LIBYA, TO MANUFACTURE BATTLEFIELD CHEMICAL 
WEAPONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROGER OWEN, Roger Owen is a visiting professor with the Center for Middle 
Eastern Studies at the University of Texas. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iraq's hasty hanging of British-based journalist Farzad Bazoft has been seen, 
quite correctly, as an attempt to impose a deathly silence on any journalist 
who might have the temerity to investigate events that could prove embarrassing 
to the regime of Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
A number of Middle Eastern reporters and editors, even a cartoonist, have been 
assassinated in Beirut, London and elsewhere for appearing to criticize this or 
that Arab government or its leader. But poor Bazoft is, as far as we know, the 
first to be tried and officially executed by a state while he was in the 
pursuit of a story. 
</P>
<P>
It is always helpful to look at the event from an Iraqi point of view. Gallows, 
like crosses, have great symbolic value. They are used, just as they were in 
Europe and America in times past, not just to punish but also to warn. In this 
case the message is clearly not directed first and foremost toward outsiders 
like British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who tried to get the death 
sentence called off, but to an audience much closer home. One part of it is to 
show that the police and the security forces are ever vigilant. But in this 
case there is much more to it than that. 
</P>
<P>
During the long war with Iran, the Iraqi army tested and perfected the use of 
several new battlefield weapons. One clearly was for the tactical use of poison 
gas. Through the use of helicopters and other methods, the Iraqis could target 
particular Iranian troop formations in an unusually precise way. This not only 
gave them an immediate military advantage but also played a major role in the 
progressive undermining of Iranian morale. It is an advantage that the present 
Iraqi leadership clearly intends to continue developing for use in any future 
war. 
</P>
<P>
In these circumstances the explosion that destroyed part of the secret military 
installation south of Baghdad last August was clearly a great embarrassment to 
the regime. It may be surmised that it also created a considerable problem 
because, the damage being so great, it proved impossible to discover whether 
the explosion was an accident or the result of deliberate sabotage. By accusing 
Bazoft of being an Israeli spy, the regime was able to suggest that, perhaps, 
the Israelis had something to do with the explosion without having to prove how 
it was actually done. Among many other things, this helped to create a useful 
alibi for the regime's own carelessness among those members of the Iraqi 
population who must know very well, whether through rumor or their official 
connections, that something at the secret plant had gone very wrong. Either the 
science used there, or the system of security, was grievously at fault. 
</P>
<P>
It may only be a coincidence, but it is also interesting to note that the very 
day that Bazoft was hanged there came news of another vast explosion at a 
secret Middle Eastern chemical plant. This time it was at Rabta, Libya, where 
mustard and nerve gas was being made. Once again, the destruction seems to have 
been such that there is no way for the authorities to discover whether it was 
an accident or the work of saboteurs. Once again, it makes the whole thing a 
little less embarrassing if attention can be focused on the alleged existence 
of foreign "spies," now described as German or French. 
</P>
<P>
Looked at in this light, Farzad Bazoft's execution seems part of a highly 
charged process in which at least two Middle Eastern regimes are trying to 
develop battlefield chemical weapons in plants that are either unsafe or open 
to sabotage -- or probably both. 
</P>
<P>
It is obviously a major story. With the hanging of Bazoft in Baghdad, 
journalists who might wish to investigate it in its local context have been 
well and truly warned off. But we can be sure that there will be many others 
who will take up the challenge to pursue it elsewhere -- in Washington, in 
Europe and in Israel.

STAGE WEEK: 'NERVOUS SET' REVIVES THE BEATNIK ERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beatniks (remember them?) are back in Jay and Fran Landesman's vintage 1959 
rock musical, "The Nervous Set," newly opened at the Heliotrope Theatre in 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"I come from an independent, low-budget film background" ("Assault of the 
Killer Bimbos"), said producer/star Patti Astor. "I realized no one was going 
to give me a million dollars to do a movie, but I probably could get the money 
to do a play. At the time I was in a theater group; the people in it were 
bringing in the worst domestic twaddle. Watching two people stand around 
haranguing each other is not my idea of entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
Introduced to the idea of reviving "Nervous Set" -- which she'd previously 
known only through its original cast album -- Astor and her partner Anita 
Rosenberg did extensive rewrites, "because the women in the script were real 
doormats, non-existent characters." They also added some original quotes by 
Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac, and encouraged the five-piece band, Skinny 
Daddy-os, to "put their own touch" on Tommy Wolfe's 31-year-old score. 
</P>
<P>
The story centers on the trials of a young, good-guy editor at Nervf magazine 
(in real life, the Landesmans were habitues of Greenwich Village's beat scene, 
where he published the magazine Neurotica). Astor plays the glamorous Sari 
Shaw, a "career girl/swinging babe," who comes to party and is caught up in the 
scene. "There's such a parallel to New York in the '80s," she stressed. "All of 
us living downtown, really broke, struggling to succeed without selling out." 
</P>
<P>
Stuart Rogers directs. 
</P>
<P>
THEATER BUZZ: "Greater Tuna" (at the Westwood Playhouse), Joe Sears' and Jaston 
Williams' quick-change two-man comedy about a collection of oddball residents 
of Tuna, Tex., has acquired quite a following, as it moved around the country 
during the past 10 years. Two of the new fans are President and Mrs. Bush, who 
caught the duo's performance at the Kennedy Center last December, then followed 
that up with an invitation to the White House for breakfast the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
According to Sears and Williams, when Barbara Bush saw them out of their show 
duds (which include male and female fashions), she appreciatively drawled, "You 
boys clean up real good." Her hubby was so impressed with the pair that he 
invited them to perform at the White House for the National Governors' 
Conference meeting on Feb. 25. "Where are you going next?" he asked them. 
According to the show's producer Charles Duggan, when the duo replied that Los 
Angeles was their next stop, the President remarked, "I'll try to come by and 
see it." So keep a lookout . . . . 
</P>
<P>
CRITICAL CROSSFIRE: "Starlight Express," Andrew Lloyd Webber and Richard 
Stilgoe's rockin' roller-skating musical is playing at the Pantages Theatre 
during its national tour. 
</P>
<P>
Said Sylvie Drake in The Times: "This show is all about what hits the eye and 
to a lesser extent the ear. It is not about what hits any deeper regions of the 
psyche. 'Starlight Express' doesn't reach there. But taken at sheer face value, 
it's a kick." 
</P>
<P>
Complained Daryl H. Miller in the Daily News: "The musical fantasy about trains 
derails more often than it stays on track, and it doesn't build up steam until 
the very end of its journey. . . . The show feels more like concert than a 
piece of musical theater." 
</P>
<P>
Said the L.A. Weekly's Tom Provenzano: "Webber's musical homage to the toy 
trains of a boy's imagination is as spectacular as his 'Phantom of the Opera,' 
but eschews the latter's morbid gothic beauty for an athletic bacchanalia of 
visual and aural stimuli that tests the limits of live theater."

ON THE RECORD: MOZART JUVENILIA MARKS 200TH ANNIVERSARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marketing-wise, things clearly have reached a crisis point in classical music 
when we "celebrate" a composer's death, as will be the case in 1991, the 200th 
anniversary of Mozart having shuffled off this mortal coil. 
</P>
<P>
The notion of today's column, dealing with some of the most remarkable musical 
juvenilia in existence -- and of a successor column, centering on late, 
instrumental Mozart -- is to get the jump on '91, ghoulish as the whole concept 
may be. There is never a shortage of Mozart recordings to review, but '90, 
young as it is, has brought some Mozart so rare that we're unlikely to meet its 
ilk again, even during next year's inevitable glut. 
</P>
<P>
In 1767 the 11-year-old Wolfgang, having already amassed a sizable catalogue of 
compositions, created the frequently written-about, never heard and, until now, 
never recorded sacred cantata with the resoundingly pompous title of "Die 
Schuldigkeit des ersten Gebotes" (The Obligation to Obey the First 
Commandment), K. 35. 
</P>
<P>
The First Commandment, to refresh your memory, reads in the Gospel According to 
St. Mark, "And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with 
all thy soul, and with all thy mind." The lengthy work -- some 90 minutes, so 
skip as many recitatives as possible -- assigns singing parts to the 
embodiments of Justice, the Christian Spirit, Compassion and so on, difficult 
characters for anyone, of any age to inspire with dramatic life. But Child 
Mozart succeeds, not with a stuffy, textbook exercise in religiosity but with a 
jolly robustness -- and an already stunning gift for orchestration (his arias 
aren't merely thinly accompanied songs) -- one expects of a very lively boy. 
The skill employed, however, has nothing to do with childhood. 
</P>
<P>
This recorded premiere (Philips 422 360, two CDs) respects the music while also 
enjoying itself. Sir Neville Marriner's direction of the Stuttgart Radio 
Symphony is deliciously fleet and pointed and the vocal ensemble, headed by 
soprano Margaret Marshall and tenor Hans Peter Blochwitz, is first-rate. 
</P>
<P>
Two additional works are appended: the "Funeral Music," K. 42 -- written by the 
11-year-old while shut in a room for several days by the Archbishop of 
Salzburg, who needed proof that Mozart's genius wasn't a hoax perpetrated by 
his composer-father -- and a brief, touchingly sweet Passion song, K. 146. 
</P>
<P>
Mozart's accelerated maturity is stunningly exhibited in the 19-year-old's "La 
finta giardiniera" (The Lady in Gardener's Disguise), a comic opera with more 
than a few dark asides, bursting with lyric invention and insightful 
characterization. The ensembles in particular are rich in dramatic interplay 
and personal revelation -- foretastes of the full-blown miracles of "Figaro" 
and "Cosi fan Tutte." 
</P>
<P>
The opera is overlong, even in its somewhat abridged new 
</P>
<P>
recording (Ricercar 06045/6/7). But there aren't that many operas containing an 
hour of brilliant music, fewer still by a teen-ager. The production, recorded 
live last year by Ricercar at the Theatre de la Monnaie, Brussels, has since 
toured widely in Europe and was considered sufficiently revelatory to have been 
imported recently by that showplace of the artistic cutting-edge, the Brooklyn 
Academy of Music. 
</P>
<P>
Musically, it's a serviceable job, without the vocal ornamentation one would 
expect from its largely youthful, presumably willing-to-learn cast under 
conductor Sylvain Cambreling's energetic but unsubtle hand. Among his singers 
are one reliable old pro, tenor Ugo Benelli, as the bumbling Podesta and an 
elegant soprano named Joanna Kozslowska in the title role. The rest of the cast 
rarely rises above routine, although according to Martin Bernheimer's report in 
the March 19 Calendar the ensemble had become finely meshed by the time of the 
Brooklyn staging, eight months and many performances after this recording was 
made. 
</P>
<P>
Now, a giant leap to Mozart in his final year, 1791: the year of "Die 
Zauberflote," whose legendary 1938 Berlin recording, conducted by Sir Thomas 
Beecham, has just made its first CD appearance (EMI/Angel 61034, two discs). 
It's one old-timer every bit as special as one remembers, although the omission 
of all spoken dialogue remains irksome. 
</P>
<P>
The chief conjurer (in addition to Mozart himself) is Beecham, whose reading 
remains a model of stylish wit and whose cast -- Gerhard Husch, Erna Berger, 
Tiana Lemnitz, Helge Rosvaenge and Wilhelm Strienz -- thrillingly embodies a 
latter-day vocal Golden Age.

SNIFFING OUT TRUFFLES;

<P>
IT'S NOT EASY TO FIND CHEF ELMER AZUMA'S LATEST RESTAURANT -- IT'S HIDDEN ON 
THE THIRD FLOOR OF AN OFFICE BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH REICHL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Poor Arnold Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
That's what I thought when I got his letter. He was writing to inform me that 
his new restaurant had just opened. He went on to say that since eating at 
Chabuya, a tiny restaurant seating just 15 people near downtown Los Angeles two 
years ago, he'd fallen in love with the food of Chef Elmer Azuma. So impressed 
was he, in fact, that he decided chef Elmer Azuma deserved a larger restaurant. 
He determined to give him just that in Truffles; "a showcase for his creative 
culinary efforts," is how he actually put it. 
</P>
<P>
This seemed sweet -- but misguided. Businessmen with no experience in 
restaurants traditionally lose their shirts when they decide to open eating 
establishments. But this particular venture seemed even more doomed than usual 
-- the site Friedman had chosen was on the third floor of a building on West 
Olympic Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
A restaurant on the third floor is always a bad idea. A restaurant on the third 
floor of an office building in a part of town with no foot traffic is even 
worse. Forget about drop-in trade. Forget about spontaneity. Forget, in fact, 
is an appropriate word; for a restaurant on the third floor is very likely to 
be forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the matter of what they were calling the food. Chef Azuma, it 
seems, was preparing something called "cuisine spontanee." Now the idea of 
unpremeditated cooking may make sense in a restaurant with 15 seats (although I 
don't remember anything particularly spontaneous about the cooking at Chabuya), 
but trying to invent dishes on the spot in a real restaurant is not a good 
idea. It seemed silly. 
</P>
<P>
From the pictures enclosed with the letter, it looked pretty silly too, like 
the worst sort of hotel dining room. I expected the project to meet with a very 
fast death. 
</P>
<P>
Then when Truffles was about a month old, our office got a call from Mr. 
Friedman. "Has she been in?" he wanted to know. "He sounded so sad," said the 
person who took the call. "OK, OK," I said, "I'll go for lunch." 
</P>
<P>
The room itself was the first surprise. What had looked fussy and overdecorated 
in the snapshots turned out to be a light, calm, soothing room. It did look a 
little bit like a hotel restaurant -- but a particularly small and attractive 
one. 
</P>
<P>
The service was the second surprise; it was swift and professional. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the food that won my heart. Forget about spontaneity or lack of it: 
This was simply a delicious, and very personal, rendition of contemporary 
French cooking. 
</P>
<P>
I started with a salad of flash-smoked black cod on a bed of tiny spinach 
leaves; it was one of the best salads I've ever eaten. Black cod is an oily, 
flavorful fish that is made even more delicious by smoking. Here the fattiness 
of the fish was perfectly set off by the clean squeakiness of the spinach 
leaves. A poached egg topped the dish, marrying the two main ingredients, and 
little bits of potato danced around adding a perfect textural note. 
</P>
<P>
Next I had lobster ravioli surrounded by baby vegetables in a rich, buttery 
sauce. It was a playful dish, a contrast of flavor and texture. I finished the 
meal with a scoop of chocolate mousse set off by three sauces. 
</P>
<P>
By the time I went back for dinner I had told everybody I know about the great 
lunch I'd eaten at Truffles. My guests arrived with great expectations. The 
fact that it took five minutes before anybody even acknowledged our presence, 
much less took us to a table, dashed them a bit. The tiny, unimpressive wine 
list didn't help. And after we had waited 15 minutes for our order to be taken, 
and another 15 minutes for the first food to arrive, the table was getting 
ominously restless. 
</P>
<P>
We all pounced on the appetizers. There was a moment of silence as we wrapped 
sauteed shrimp in Vietnamese rice paper, added lots of Asian herbs and dipped 
the little packages into fish sauce. And then there were smiles; they were 
wonderful. So was the warm, rare, Norwegian salmon topped with a scattering of 
salmon caviar. And a special salad made of rock shrimp, potatoes, greens and a 
king's ransom of shaved truffles was truly spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
Main courses were impressive too. Roast filet mignon of veal -- a huge, pink, 
peppery serving -- came topped with truffles cooked in the meat juices. Lobster 
came roasted in a Thai-flavored curry, with a scattering of sliced artichokes; 
the lobster and the artichokes were an inspired combination. But my favorite 
dish was the special fish of the day. Steamed rock cod came in a mustard sauce 
laced with whole sea urchins; the sauce imparted a flash of flavor to this 
rather bland fish. 
</P>
<P>
We waited again for dessert. It was all so slow that I kept imagining poor chef 
Azuma back in the kitchen all alone, trying to spontaneously prepare everything 
by himself. In the end, I'm not convinced that the mille-feuille with berries 
and lemon creme Chantilly was worth waiting for, but the apple strudel, which 
came with a raisin mousse, was. It moved one guest to say, "I like it so much 
that I'm having to rethink my attitude towards raisins." 
</P>
<P>
We waited again for the check. And it was not small. Without wine, tax or tip, 
the meal had cost about $40 apiece. Had the service been better, the price 
would have seemed fair. As it was, I decided to go back and find out if the 
"discovery menu" -- three courses at $31 -- would seem like a better bargain. 
</P>
<P>
It did. You have to forgo some of the better dishes (the lobster, the fish of 
the day), but you can choose the Vietnamese shrimp, the black cod, lobster 
ravioli, salmon with caviar, good crisp sauteed sweetbreads and a dish of 
shrimp and scallops grilled and served in a pesto sauce on a bed of pureed 
fennel. At $31 for three of these dishes, you can forgive the slowness of the 
service. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, chef Azuma doesn't quite have the showcase that his culinary 
talent deserves. The service, which is pleasant, needs to be speeded up. The 
wine list needs to be expanded. But considering that the restaurant is only a 
couple of months old, Truffles is doing just fine.

So don't pity Arnold Friedman. Right now he is beating the odds.

NOTEBOOK: MICHELIN'S NEWEST STARS IN FRANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 1990 Guide Michelin for France was published March 12 and, as usual, 
contained a few surprises. Chief among these was the elevation of Alain 
Ducasse's Louis XV at the Hotel de Paris in Monte Carlo to coveted three-star 
status. At 33, Ducasse is Michelin's youngest three-star chef. The guidebook 
moved unusually fast in promoting him -- he's only been at the restaurant since 
1986, and was virtually unknown before then. 
</P>
<P>
The most famous chef in Ducasse's neighborhood, Jacques Maximin, was doubtless 
surprised at Louis XV's promotion, too. In his years at Chantecler in Nice's 
Hotel Negresco, Maximin was given top status by almost everybody -- except 
Michelin. The third star was withheld, according to widespread rumors, because 
his restaurant was part of a large hotel, and thus he couldn't devote proper 
attention to each plate. Since the younger, less-famous Ducasse is also 
installed in a hotel dining room, another possibility has been raised: that the 
guidebook simply never thought Maximin quite good (or consistent) enough for 
three stars. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Maximin was given two stars for his new establishment in Nice, 
called simply Maximin. (Maximin was not elevated from one to two stars, as 
reported in the New York Times, incidentally, since his place opened only last 
year and didn't appear in the '89 Michelin.) 
</P>
<P>
In other Michelin news, Oustau de Baumaniere in Les Baux-de-Provence was 
demoted from three to two stars -- surprising no one. Le Vieux Moulin in 
Bouilland, near Beaune, was among those elevated from one to two stars; Le Pre 
Catelan and Le Petit Bedon in Paris were among those demoted from two stars to 
one; and Amphycles, one of the hottest new restaurants in Paris, was given its 
first star -- as did some 47 other places around France. 
</P>
<P>
EAT TO GIVE: Friday, the Women's Culinary Alliance hosts its second annual 
Dining for Dollars. It's not a food and wine festival, but a program by which 
more than 40 L.A. area restaurants donate 10% of their gross dinner (or, if 
they're not open for dinner, lunch) receipts to the Pediatric AIDS Foundation. 
Participants range from Jody Maroni's Sausage Kingdom and Dem Bones Bar-B-Q 
Shack to Spago and Citrus. Others include Atlas Bar &amp; Grill, Campanile, 
Beau Rivage, the Chin Chin restaurants, Indigo and Maxine's Seafood Cafe. Lew 
Mitchell's Orient Express and Palette will donate 15% of their dinner receipts, 
and Pennyfeather's plans on giving 20%. Zabie's in Santa Monica will serve a 
special sit-down dinner Friday and Saturday with all proceeds donated. And 
Salisbury Manor in Los Angeles will offer a special menu with entertainment; 
its waiters have agreed to donate their tips, too. 
</P>
<P>
WINE DINNERS: Monday is a good night for wine drinkers. At Fino in Torrance, 
Chalone wines are featured at a $55-a-head wine dinner. . . . Also tomorrow, 
for $45 a head, Belle Vue in Santa Monica offers a six-course repast featuring 
Napa Creek wines.

ARTIST REFUSES TO PLAY IT SAFE; 
</P>
<P>
CURTIS YORK'S POLITICALLY PROVOCATIVE PERFORMANCES REGULARLY STIR UP 
CONTROVERSY AND ANGER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Some observers and art lovers are fretting over whether people who make art are 
going to turn timid in the face of congressional inquiries into federal arts 
funding. National Endowment for the Arts budget cuts today, rampant censorship 
tomorrow: That's the worst scenario, but, some feel, not an outlandish one. 
Will artists start reasoning that it's better to play it safe right now, until 
all this blows over -- thus employing a subtle form of censorship? Will they be 
hit with their own case of "The Wimp Factor"? 
</P>
<P>
A few may, but don't count on performance artist Curtis York. A former student 
of Utah's Weber State College and the University of Utah, York came to Los 
Angeles with $50 in his pocket to study with performance artist Rachel 
Rosenthal. After four years of presenting his own and others' work, York, 26, 
who wears leather clothes and sports a Mohawk haircut, has regularly stirred up 
controversy -- and some anger -- with a collection of politically provocative 
pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for example, the working title of a piece planned for Los Angeles 
Contemporary Exhibitions: "Autoeroticurtis." Or his latest, at Highways in 
Santa Monica: "The United States of Christ." 
</P>
<P>
That's nothing compared to an early working title, which was -- Jesse Helms, 
are you listening? -- "Flaming Faggot, Burning Witch." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, York hopes that Helms, or one of his local allies, is listening. 
"This is especially meant for right-wing Christians to see. If their faith is 
strong enough, hearing a little truth about history won't shake it." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, York warns: "The time to be polite is over. No one can tell 
artists what they can and can't do." 
</P>
<P>
It is a careful tightrope York is walking with "The United States of Christ." 
With his collaborator and longtime friend, author Frosti, the professional name 
of Scott Simpson, York says his intent is to deliver a warning against trying 
to bridge the separation of church and state as well as deliver a theatrical 
message of tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
Not an easy trick, considering the charged emotions surrounding some of the 
show's themes, such as abortion rights, and freedom of expression. Though a 
scene shows one of York's characters (he plays 15 in all), a Roman Catholic 
priest, flagellating himself to sexual ecstasy after flubbing a Communion 
ceremony, he also states: "I can't stress enough that this isn't an 
anti-Christian piece." 
</P>
<P>
Performance artist Rosenthal said, "He puts himself on the line morally and 
politically. His pieces are strong, but they're never a lecture. As a gay man, 
he feels threatened by religious fanatics and others who would suppress him. He 
has a fearlessness for confronting hard issues." 
</P>
<P>
York's use of complex and clashing currents in his work is consistent, even 
when it means disturbing his audience and friends. He freely admits that his 
1989 show, "Blackout," was "very sacrilegious and upset a lot of people." In 
response to "Meet the Mormons," which York, targeting the Mormon Church, 
performed last year with Robert Daniels at Highways, one letter writer to The 
Times condemned the show for "attacking prejudice with prejudice." 
</P>
<P>
Frosti, York's pal since high school, said he was very offended by it, and told 
York as much. "I knew that Curtis was coming from deep personal pain when he 
did that show, but the Mormon Church as a whole shouldn't have been held 
responsible for some of his terrible experiences. Individuals should have. We 
were both raised in that religion. He had bad experiences; I didn't." 
</P>
<P>
But, York reveals that after staging "Meet the Mormons" he went through "a 
forgiveness process. I forgave the Mormons I knew growing up, and I forgave 
myself." In many ways, that performance was the catalyst for "The United States 
of Christ." 
</P>
<P>
Another was Frosti's research, triggered by his involvement in the pro-choice 
movement, into Roman Catholic Church history. Meanwhile, York had been 
performing in others' pieces, notably John Fleck's "Blessed Are All the Little 
Fishes" and the Peter Brosius/Dennis Cooper/Ishmael Houston-Jones work, "The 
Undead" (at the Mark Taper Forum's 1989 Taper Lab and planned for the Los 
Angeles Festival in September). 
</P>
<P>
"I was incredibly busy," York said, "but the ideas emerging out of Frosti's 
research demanded to be played out before an audience." Delving into Vatican 
history as a model of what happens when a religious institution assumes the 
power of the state, Frosti found useful material in books such as "Vicars of 
Christ: The Dark Side of the Papacy" by ex-priest Peter De Rosa and "Outline of 
Ecclesiastical History" by B.H. Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
A theatrical strategy emerged from the research, which was to draw parallels 
(through various characters York portrayed) between past and present. So such 
episodes as the Catholic involvement in the Inquisition, or the Vatican's 
ability to tax many of the royal courts of Europe, are interwoven with American 
Christian fundamentalist efforts to institutionalize school prayer, ban books 
or make abortion illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Why focus on Catholicism? "We're artists in the Western tradition," said York, 
"and the Catholic Church has been a powerful political force in the West. It's 
what we know. But there's a broader concern, and that is to show that it's not 
healthy for people to practice religious fascism and not know history. 
</P>
<P>
"I was raised a Christian and with Christianity's humane morals, and I'm glad 
of that. It would be cool if everyone followed the Golden Rule -- 'Do unto 
others . . . ' -- which is what the faith comes down to. But when one's beliefs 
cross over from personal choices to attempts to influence others' choices, that 
is going too far." 
</P>
<P>
When York added that "no one should be prevented from practicing their 
religion," he meant this in a personal way. As a witch and follower of the 
Wicca faith, an earth-based religion, he is cognizant of the legacy of the 
persecution of witches by more traditional religions. "Nothing more could be 
done to my religion than has already been done to it." 
</P>
<P>
He winced reporting the methods of torture of suspected homosexuals during the 
Inquisition in Spain, France and Italy, revealed by Frosti's research. York 
said the show is "including historical material that hasn't been presented 
publicly before." 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, York would like to go even more public than he already has. He 
would like to go back out on the road, possibly disturbing audiences along the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that I want to be internationally famous or anything," he said 
sheepishly, "but I think the content in my pieces deserves to be heard by more 
people than in L.A. and New York. I'd like to go off the usual performance art 
circuit, into cities like Tucson and Boise. There are open-minded people there, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States of Christ" continues at Highways, 1651 18th St., Santa 
Monica, today and April 1, 8:30 p.m. Tickets: $10. (213) 453-1755.

TEEN-AGE SUICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having taken my children to see "Dead Poets Society," up for four Academy 
Awards, including best picture, I was angered by the film makers' failure to 
address the film's central issue -- teen-age suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Momentarily thwarted by his father's attempt to dominate his life, one of Robin 
Williams' most promising students shoots himself, a believable adolescent act 
of revenge. 
</P>
<P>
But who loses the most? Clearly the boy himself. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the film makers choose to make Williams' personal loss of his teaching 
position the central story point. Is this responsible film making? 
</P>
<P>
On the way home from the theater, it was clear from their conversation that my 
kids loved the film. When I asked my 11-year-old if he thought the boy was 
right in what he did, he said yes. After all, what choice did the boy have? His 
father was destroying his life. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, this gave me an opportunity to point out that no matter how much 
we may disagree, suicide is not the answer. But how many children will see this 
picture and never have similar discussion with their parents?

The fact is there are people who hate gays, blacks, Orientals, men, women, 
young, old, etc. 
</P>
<P>
This hatred usually comes from misunderstanding and from being raised in such a 
mind-set. 
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, greater knowledge through modern communications will allow the 
majority to be exposed to and to reject such views. But please don't pretend 
they don't exist and try to hide opinions, whether you believe them to be right 
or wrong.

Re "Lean Times for Foreign-Language Films," Feb. 25: 
</P>
<P>
There will be fat times from April 20 to May 3 when the American Film Institute 
Los Angeles Film Festival will present over 100 foreign-language films from 
more than 40 countries in five cinemas. 
</P>
<P>
All of the films mentioned in Sheila Benson's article as important will be 
presented in the AFI L.A. FilmFest. Many of film makers will be here as well. 
</P>
<P>
AFI Los Angeles Film Festival was organized four years ago in cooperation with 
the Filmex Board to replace Filmex as the Los Angeles International Film 
Festival after that fine festival had financial problems.

HIP HAMLET AND LADY M. SET OUT ON A ROCK 'N' ROLL RIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Call her Lady M. Paint him Candide. Throw in a golden-tressed Hamlet and you've 
got the hippest new trio in Los Angeles. "Shout and Twist," a production at the 
Odyssey Theatre in West Los Angeles, is a high-concept rock 'n' roll ride 
through a world of educated camp: puns, one-liners, madcap energy, soulful 
ballads, sarcastic divas, New York angst, Day-Glo makeup and truly nutzoid 
props. Plus the classics. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not an accident that we picked those three characters," said co-star 
Michael Butler, who created the piece with Johann (pronounced Joann) Carlo, the 
stain-handed Lady Macbeth, and Henry Stram. 
</P>
<P>
Butler's Candide, for example, "is an archetype for a real guitar hero, someone 
with lots of interests, who bounces from one thing to the next: est one week, 
gurus the next. Lady M. is the whole idea of rock stars being today's kings and 
queens. And Hamlet, with all of his self-involvement, is more of a guy for this 
time than anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The piece had its first birth pangs in 1981, when Carlo and Butler hooked up 
romantically and professionally. He was playing Candide at the Guthrie Theatre; 
she and Henry Stram were also in the cast. 
</P>
<P>
On nights off, "basically out of boredom, we started writing songs," Carlo 
recalled, "and convinced our director to let us do the club circuit. See, in 
theater, everyone's polite. In clubs, people tell you what they think. We 
wanted to bridge those two elements." 
</P>
<P>
 In the club setting, their transition from actors to actor-singer-writers was 
blissfully organic. "We didn't just stand up there and sing songs," said 
Butler, who also plays guitar and keyboard in the show's score. (Titles include 
"I'm Going Steady" and "Out Damned Spot.") 
</P>
<P>
"We staged them, made performances. Just standing up on a stage, the back beat 
kicks in -- and you don't have any problem getting inspired. There aren't many 
ventures where you get to do all those things. Why not do it all?" 
</P>
<P>
The confidence is well-earned. Butler is a graduate of Juilliard, a former 
dancer with the Erick Hawkins Dance Company and cast member of the recent 
Broadway production of "Macbeth." Carlo studied in London, was on Broadway in 
"Plenty" and on TV's "Crime Story" as the pouty wife of mobster Ray Luca. 
Together, they staged half a dozen original works in New York, including "It's 
Still Life," which was commissioned by the Whitney Museum and later toured 
India and Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
The pair, who consider New York their base, say they rely on intuition to 
evaluate their work. 
</P>
<P>
"We've also trained that intuition," Carlo said. "So it's not coming from just 
anywhere. It's also from doing a lot of different plays; your instrument gets 
in tune. What's funny, though, is all the things people read into the work. 
They start talking about what this is and what that means, and you say 'What?' 
Then afterward you say, 'Oh, I guess it really is that.' Or a person can read 
something interesting into something, and it spins off into another idea for 
you." 
</P>
<P>
Although they've yet to hit it big (Butler describes their artistic existence 
as "trying, trying, trying"), it is a satisfying life. "The best part of what 
we do is traveling," Carlo said. "You get to meet people, you get to create. I 
get so much from different places, different cultures. Hopefully, it'll sift 
its way through the work, become part of it. 
</P>
<P>
"And the fact that we're a couple makes it all better. We work together, are 
together. It's hard going sometimes, but basically Michael and I are very happy 
together. So what could be so terrible?" 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that their work follows them everywhere? "Our relationship is our 
work," Carlo said firmly. She sees little indication of that changing. "It's 
the community we hang in. I love to cook, make pasta. But it's always artists 
coming in and out, discussing their work. What else is there to talk about? 
</P>
<P>
"As far as Michael and me, our sensibilities are very much the same; we don't 
have any problems," she said. "The only problems we have are when we work with 
other people." 
</P>
<P>
 "Shout &amp; Twist" plays at the Odyssey Theatre, 2055 S. Sepulveda Blvd.,

Planning Commission Chairman Jim Serles accepted campaign contributions from 
developers and realtors then voted in favor of their projects in apparent 
violation of the state Political Reform Act, according to documents provided by 
his opponent in the City Council race. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach City Council has authorized the hiring of a special investigator 
to review allegations leveled against Serles by his opponent, Doug Drummond, a 
retired Long Beach police commander. Both candidates are vying for the 3rd 
District seat being vacated by Councilwoman Jan Hall. 
</P>
<P>
A list of Serles' campaign contributions and copies of Planning Commission 
minutes gathered by Drummond show Serles voted on four projects after receiving 
contributions of $250 or more within a year of the votes. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, planning commissioners must disqualify themselves from voting 
on an issue if within the past year they have received campaign contributions 
of $250 or more from anyone with a financial interest in that issue. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, he is picking the pockets of the developers," Drummond charged. 
"It is flagrant disregard for the law." 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Serles said: "I have 25 years of public service and a 
strong commitment to making Long Beach a better city. For Drummond to imply 
that I am beholden to developers is outrageous and untrue." 
</P>
<P>
Serles dismissed the allegations as "last-minute campaign rhetoric" in 
Drummond's "desperate" attempt to win the race. He failed to respond to further 
questions about Drummond's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
According to the documents: 
</P>
<P>
* In October, Serles voted in favor of a two-unit condominium requested by 
developer Dale Robinson, four months after he accepted a $750 campaign 
contribution from the developer. 
</P>
<P>
* In October, Serles voted in favor of building 51 townhouse units at 3000 
Pacific Avenue, four months after accepting a $600 contribution from Larry 
Agajanian, who owns the property. 
</P>
<P>
* In November, Serles voted in favor of expanding the Belmonte restaurant on 
2nd Street, five months after he accepted a $300 contribution from the 
restaurant's owner, Frank Pocino. 
</P>
<P>
* In December, Serles voted to delay a decision on whether to develop the 
Pacific Electric right of way, one of the cities' most controversial 
development projects. The vote came six months after he accepted a $1,000 
campaign contribution from developer Robert Kendrick, who owns the property. 
The developer was not opposed to the delay. 
</P>
<P>
Drummond also charges that Serles violated state law that prohibits campaign 
contributions in excess of $1,000 when he accepted free office space to set up 
his campaign headquarters at 5353 E. 2nd Street in Belmont Shore. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate businessman Greg Cutuli donated the space from October through 
December, which Serles reported as being worth $900. Another donation of the 
same space was made by Leonard Cutuli, his brother, for just under two months, 
which Serles reported was worth $600. 
</P>
<P>
Drummond charges that the property was undervalued, and was actually worth 
$1,660 the first time and $1,027 the second. He said the higher figures were 
quoted him when he called inquiring about renting the space. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Cutuli said in an interview that the office was vacant for 2 1/2 years and 
was donated as a campaign headquarters in hopes of increasing the building's 
visibility. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a business decision to have somebody in here as opposed to nobody in 
here," he said, adding that he considered the space to be worth $300 a month. 
Its fair market value today would be "negotiable," he said.

CONTAMINATED PLAYGROUND AT CUDAHY SCHOOL TO BE REPAVED

An elementary school that has been shut down for more than eight months because 
its playground is contaminated with petroleum waste is scheduled to reopen in 
the fall, Los Angeles school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles school board has approved plans to cover the playground at Park 
Avenue Elementary School with a layer of asphalt to prevent the sludge of 
petroleum chemical compounds and its vapors from rising to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
School officials hope to have the school reopened at the beginning of the 
school year in September, school board member Leticia Quezada said Wednesday at 
a meeting of parents, teachers, residents and state and school officials. 
</P>
<P>
Although the petroleum-contaminated soil and sludge will not be removed, 
parents, teachers and administrators said they are satisfied that the covering 
will protect the students. They said they are tired of waiting for some kind of 
solution to be found to clean up the ooze, and want to get back to their own 
school. 
</P>
<P>
The elementary school, at 8020 Park Ave., was closed last summer after parents 
and teachers raised concerns about health hazards associated with the tar-like 
petroleum sludge that appeared in tiny puddles on the surface of the asphalt 
playground. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Park Avenue students have been divided and sent to Teresa Hughes 
Elementary School and Clara Street Primary Center, which operate year-round. 
Administrators and parents said Park Avenue students who have been attending 
these schools, which were overcrowded before Park Avenue was closed, have 
become much like guests who have overstayed their welcome. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to go back to our own school," said parent Maria Castillo, who has 
three children diverted from Park Avenue. "We're not wanted (at the other 
schools) and we don't want to be there." 
</P>
<P>
Principal Jose Velasquez, who has been forced to try to keep track of his Park 
Avenue students sent to two other campuses, said the whole experience has been 
an administrative nightmare. "What's important now is (that) we get back to our 
school," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to an environmental report released in January, Park Avenue school 
was built on an old city dump that contained petroleum-contaminated soil and 
several pockets of tar-like petroleum sludge. 
</P>
<P>
But the report by Angelo Bellomo, director of an environmental engineering firm 
that conducted a series of tests last November and December, concluded that 
students would not face any health hazards as long as they did not have 
prolonged contact with the sludge. The report also found no dangerous traces of 
hazardous vapor in the air. 
</P>
<P>
Although the report concluded that it would be safe for students to return to 
the school immediately, district officials have held off until they get a firm 
recommendation from the state Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Hume, an environmental engineer with the Health Services Department, 
said a decision will be made as soon as department engineers in Sacramento give 
their decision. That decision is expected late this week, he said. Once the 
state has reached a decision, a meeting will be held with Bellomo to discuss 
the details of construction. 
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's meeting, a group of about 25 parents, teachers, administrators 
and residents were presented with two options for covering the playground. 
</P>
<P>
Both plans involve digging about 12 to 20 trenches in the playground, filling 
them with gravel and laying pipes to vent gas to the surface, where it will be 
monitored for hazardous vapor. 
</P>
<P>
One plan calls for a thick plastic liner to be sandwiched between layers of 
sand over the trenches, and a new asphalt surface poured on top. The other plan 
would leave out the plastic liner and instead pour a thicker layer of new 
asphalt over the trenches. Both, Bellomo said, would keep the petroleum sludge 
from percolating to the surface, and keep gases from seeping to the surface 
except through the ventilation system. 
</P>
<P>
Both plans would take an equal amount of time to complete, but the option 
involving the plastic liner will cost about $750,000 -- twice as much as the 
other, Bellomo said. 
</P>
<P>
Parents said they favor the more expensive measure.

RESIDENTS BALK AT BILLING; 
</P>
<P>
CONDO OWNERS WANT LONG BEACH TO HELP PAY FOR STRUCTURAL FLAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Owners of the 78 units in a west side Long Beach condominium building will be 
getting some undesirable mail this week. 
</P>
<P>
They will get bills ranging from $4,700 to $9,000 for the proposed repair of 
dangerous major structural flaws in their buildings. 
</P>
<P>
None of the residents was involved in the design of the 5-year-old Oceangate 
Square at 720 W. 4th St. Its planning and construction was inspected and 
approved by the city, which then declared the site safe for occupancy. Now 
residents, many of them first-time buyers who spent more than $100,000 on 
homes, must pick up the tab for something most say is partly the city's fault. 
</P>
<P>
"This was our American dream," said resident Ray Lopez, 32, "and now it's 
turned into a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Park, 51, said: "I'm upset, I'm nervous and I'm worried. I've got 
stomach pains and headaches. I don't know where I'm going to get the money." 
</P>
<P>
City officials acknowledge the error in design but deny any culpability in it. 
"It isn't something you would readily pick up," said Supt. of Building Eugene 
Zeller, who attributed the flaw to a miscalculation by a design engineer 
employed by the original developer. "It wasn't something an (inspector) would 
automatically see." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, some of the condominium residents will ask the Long Beach City 
Council to help them obtain homeowner loans to pay for the damage. 
</P>
<P>
They filed a suit in Long Beach Superior Court asking for financial relief from 
the building's original developer, G. E. Western Properties. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a hardship on every one of us," said Bart Benjamins, 
president of the Oceangate Square Homeowners Assn., the group representing 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
Their travails began more than two years ago, when some homeowners began 
noticing cracks in their walls. They also complained of doors that, no matter 
how often they were trimmed, wouldn't fit properly into their frames. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually they hired an engineer who confirmed their worst fears. Because of 
an error in design, he told them, insufficient steel reinforcements had been 
placed in the concrete columns and the foundation. As a result, he said, the 
building is sagging in a way that could mean imminent collapse. 
</P>
<P>
City engineers confirmed the structural deficiency but disagreed on its 
severity. While the building would have to be repaired to avoid condemnation, 
they said, its condition had not yet deteriorated to the point that evacuation 
would be required. 
</P>
<P>
The flaw was caused, Zeller said, by the misapplication of a computer program 
designed to calculate levels of stress in new constructions. 
</P>
<P>
A similar flaw, he said, was discovered in a building next door -- called 
Goldengate Square and designed with the same program. 
</P>
<P>
The design of a third building by the same engineer revealed similar flaws that 
were eliminated in the planning stages, Zeller said. 
</P>
<P>
The engineer could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
As for Oceangate and Goldengate, Zeller said, their owner-residents have been 
ordered to reinforce the two buildings' foundations by adding new columns in 
the underground garage, a process that Benjamins estimates will cost about $1 
million in each building. 
</P>
<P>
"If there was any belief in my mind that there was immediate danger of 
collapse, I would have ordered (them) vacated," said Zeller, adding that both 
buildings are being scrutinized daily for new signs of stress. "As it is, I 
won't feel comfortable until it's actually shored up." 
</P>
<P>
Residents said insurance companies will not pay for the repairs because they 
consider the damage a result of human error, and banks will not lend money on a 
building that is flawed. 
</P>
<P>
Some banks, Benjamins said, have agreed to issue loans if the city guarantees 
them for up to a year -- something the city has so far refused to do. 
</P>
<P>
Goldengate Square residents, who have also filed a lawsuit against their 
building's developer, said they are still several months away from assessing 
individual costs. 
</P>
<P>
But Oceangate residents say they are feeling the pain. "I'm stretched to the 
limit," said David Reinschreiber, 30, who has put off buying a replacement for 
his 8-year-old car because of the impending financial crunch. 
</P>
<P>
Theresa Martinez, 69, said the tension has forced her to undergo treatment for 
a weakened heart. 
</P>
<P>
And Darleen Mandala, 52, said next week's assessment will wipe out the savings 
she and her husband -- both on disability -- had earmarked for emergency health 
care. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very depressed," she said. "Every time I go away, I pray that the building 
is still standing when I come back. (Living here) is really nerve-racking."

Two California Youth Authority superintendents will switch jobs on April 2, CYA 
Director C. A. Terhune has announced. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Zermeno, superintendent of Fred C. Nelles School in Whittier, will become 
superintendent of the Southern Reception Center and Clinic in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
Edward R. Futch, superintendent of the Norwalk institution, will assume the 
same position at Nelles. 
</P>
<P>
Zermeno, 43, has been with the department since 1971. He has held a variety of 
positions, including assistant superintendent at Preston School in Ione, before 
being named head of Nelles five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Futch, 50, also started with the department in 1971 and has served in a number 
of capacities. He has been superintendent of the Norwalk Reception Center and 
Clinic since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Terhune said the changes are in keeping with his long-standing practice of 
periodically rotating top management staff members to enhance their career 
experience and to "provide for significant change and new ideas to come into 
our institutions." 
</P>
<P>
The California Youth Authority is the correctional department for juveniles and 
young adults.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE

<P>
Rural Development 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 315 to 99, the House approved the rule for debating a major 
realignment of rural development programs within the Department of Agriculture. 
The bill (HR 3581) later was pulled off the floor after being amended (see 
below) in a way that upset its sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
The bill creates a Rural Development Administration to take over many Farmers 
Home Administration programs and give states more say in picking recipients of 
federal aid. It would cost more than $2 billion over five years. In part, it 
would ease repayment terms to many holders of rural electrification and FmHA 
loans and would aid communities hurt by a reduction in timbering in nearby 
national forests. 
</P>
<P>
The new agency would provide grants and loans to community health facilities, 
small businesses, water and sewer authorities, electric and telephone borrowers 
and other recipients. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Lynn Martin (R-Ill.) said she likes the bill's "pooling of existing 
funds under a new umbrella Rural Development Administration." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Bill Frenzel (R-Minn.) complained that the bill "authorizes large sums 
of money for new programs and expansion of existing programs." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the rule for debating the bill.

To Amend the Rural Bill 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 204 to 193, the House amended HR 3581 (above) to preserve existing 
procedures for allocating water and sewer grants and loans to rural areas. This 
eliminated the bill's attempt to pool water and sewer money with other rural 
development funds, for distribution according to priorities set by state review 
panels. 
</P>
<P>
The vote caused sponsors to pull the bill from debate, saying that it had been 
gutted. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor Charlie Rose (D-N.C.) said his amendment would "keep the rural water 
and sewer programs sacrosanct." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Timothy J. Penny (D-Minn.) said the FmHA's "emphasis, given water and 
sewer funding, shortchanges other worthwhile rural development initiatives." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the amendment.

Rural Development 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 315 to 99, the House approved the rule for debating a major 
realignment of rural development programs within the Department of Agriculture. 
The bill (HR 3581) later was pulled off the floor after being amended (see 
below) in a way that upset its sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
The bill creates a Rural Development Administration to take over many Farmers 
Home Administration programs, and give states more say in picking recipients of 
federal aid. It would cost more than $2 billion over five years. In part, it 
would ease repayment terms to many holders of rural electrification and FmHA 
loans, and would aid communities hurt by a reduction in timbering in nearby 
national forests. 
</P>
<P>
The new agency would provide grants and loans to community health facilities, 
small businesses, water and sewer authorities, electric and telephone borrowers 
and other recipients. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Lynn Martin (R-Ill.) said she liked the bill's "pooling of existing 
funds under a new umbrella Rural Development Administration." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Bill Frenzel (R-Minn.) complained that the bill "authorizes large sums 
of money for new programs and expansion of existing programs." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the rule for debating the bill.

To Amend the Rural Bill 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 204 to 193, the House amended HR 3581 (above) to preserve existing 
procedures for allocating water and sewer grants and loans to rural areas. This 
eliminated the bill's attempt to pool water and sewer money with other rural 
development funds, for distribution according to priorities set by state review 
panels. 
</P>
<P>
The vote caused sponsors to pull the bill from debate, charging that it had 
been gutted. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor Charlie Rose (D-N.C.) said his amendment would "keep the rural water 
and sewer programs sacrosanct." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Timothy J. Penny (D-Minn.) said the FmHA's "emphasis, given water and 
sewer funding, shortchanges other worthwhile rural development initiatives." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the amendment.

HUNTINGTON PARK STUDENTS TAKE A WALK ON WILD SIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SEARLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Noon is approaching, and it's getting hot at Point Mugu State Park in the Santa 
Monica Mountains. But none of the teen-agers gathered around outdoors expert 
Joe Drennan seem to mind. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, let's see if we can locate the Deer family," Drennan suggests. He holds 
up two fingers and draws two parallel marks in the ground alongside the trail 
that he and the youngsters have been following. 
</P>
<P>
"When you find two little marks like this, it means you're probably getting 
close to Mrs. Deer," Drennan tells his listeners. "So you say, 'Hi, Mrs. Deer! 
Hi, Doe!' " 
</P>
<P>
Drennan, a staff member of the Headlands Institute, an organization devoted to 
teaching respect for nature, simulates the tracks of Mr. Deer ("Hi, Buck!") and 
Baby Deer ("Hi, Fawn!"). 
</P>
<P>
To some junior high school students, such talk might seem naive. But to the 14 
youngsters who have traveled to the hills of Ventura County from Huntington 
Park, near inner-city Los Angeles, it's fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
The visitors, one of two groups that will camp overnight in the park's Sycamore 
Canyon this week as part of the parks system's Environmental Education Pilot 
Program, are science students at Nimitz Junior High, part of the Los Angeles 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Acuna, 13, presses closer as Drennan scoops up a tiny, wormlike 
creature. He explains that it's a grub or baby beetle -- hardly a candidate for 
Cynthia's collection of rocks and seashells. 
</P>
<P>
"I study them with a magnifying glass," she says. "Up here, I'm watching the 
ground all the time, looking for things to add to my collection." 
</P>
<P>
Claudia Acosta, 14, notes that it's nice to "just get away from the city for a 
little while." In Huntington Park, she reports, "we have too many people, too 
much pollution, too much crime. We don't have as many gangs as some other 
places, but we do have them." 
</P>
<P>
The group's youngest camper, Jerry Chacon, 12, concedes that his parents were 
concerned about his safety during the trip. "But they just said to be careful," 
he says. He adds that he's anxious to learn all he can about science. His 
ambition is to become an airline pilot or an astronaut. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a year-round school, which means our students get two six-week breaks 
but no summer vacation," said Nimitz science teacher Margaret Kroon. 
</P>
<P>
"These trips are part of a pilot project being conducted by the school district 
and the state Department of Parks and Recreation. The idea is to give the 
children a chance to study and experience nature just as those who go camping 
in the summer do." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Chesney, a former Nimitz teacher who is helping to design the two-year 
pilot program for the state, says he doesn't know whether students in Ventura 
County -- where few schools are on year-round schedules -- will take part in 
the program if it's adopted.

Later I got used to not caring a damn, just to walking and staying put when I 
had walked far enough, at some village of which I didn't know the name, to 
letting myself drift with Africa. -- Graham Greene, "Journey Without Maps" 
</P>
<P>
Drifting with the currents on Botswana's Okavango Delta, gliding through 
channels choked by papyrus and lily pads is like a journey without maps. 
</P>
<P>
I found myself in unfamiliar territory, not caring about anything but sitting 
back and enjoying the sky, the clouds and the birds as our canoe passed red and 
yellow reeds, swamp grasses, sausage trees and fields of maize. 
</P>
<P>
I watched wallowing hippos, heard the screech of baboons and, in the evening, 
fell asleep to a symphony of swamp sounds. I was not oblivious to the dangers 
of this watery wilderness, but it was hard to feel threatened in such pristine, 
even hypnotic, surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
Before 1923 there were no comprehensive maps of the Okavango Delta, a lush 
waterway on the edge of the Kalahari Desert. It's nearly impossible to 
accurately map an area that changes so dramatically with the seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The Okavango River, which begins in the Angola Highlands, swells during the 
rainy season (November to April) and floods over a depression in Botswana, 
forming the world's largest inland delta: 6,500 square miles of inlets, flood 
plains, lagoons and islands. 
</P>
<P>
I went on a four-day water safari last May. It was a good time to visit. The 
Delta was in full flood, lush with vegetation, and the weather was dry and warm 
but never too hot. 
</P>
<P>
I saw lots of wildlife, though I probably would have seen more at the end of 
the dry season in September and October when herds of animals come to the Delta 
in search of water. 
</P>
<P>
Canoes, which are like water taxis, are the only way to get around much of the 
Delta. They transport people from village to village, to fishing or hunting 
areas. Polers are the taxi drivers, having grown up navigating the channels. 
They stand in the stern, moving the canoe forward with a long forked pole (a 
ngashi). 
</P>
<P>
 My journey began when two friends -- Katie Janssen and John Blank -- showed up 
at my door in Harare, Zimbabwe. They had just finished a year teaching in 
Kenyan villages. I was on a six-month trip to Harare, visiting a friend who 
works there. 
</P>
<P>
Katie and John were driving through eastern and southern Africa and suggested a 
trip to the Okavango -- the "Serengeti of Swamps" they called it. I was game. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to stick to a timetable when you're traveling in Africa in a '67 Land 
Rover. Every time we hit a rut I braced myself to avoid hitting my head on the 
roof. We stalled each time mud splashed on the spark plugs, which was often. 
</P>
<P>
It took three days to make the 700-mile trip to the Delta. We passed through 
customs behind a huge bus of Zimbabweans going to Botswana to shop. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Botswana soldiers stopped us at a roadblock. They were apparently making 
a routine check for South African secret agents who conduct undercover 
operations in Botswana, trying to find African National Congress guerrillas. 
They let us pass. 
</P>
<P>
After a long drive along the northern edge of the surprisingly lush Kalahari 
Desert it was a relief to see water. We had reached Maun, the gateway to the 
Delta. Maun is a patchwork of old and new, with posh hotels going up next to 
traditional villages. 
</P>
<P>
Herero women, refugees from Namibia, wander the streets dressed in colorful 
long dresses adopted from 19th-Century German colonists, but decorated with 
African patterns. 
</P>
<P>
Our home base was 7 1/2 miles north of Maun at Island Safari Lodge. We shared a 
campsite with several South Africans speaking Afrikaans. They tried to convince 
us that apartheid doesn't exist, and that they weren't such "bad guys." They 
regaled us with tales of traversing the African bush. 
</P>
<P>
But we were more interested in water and canoes than Afrikaner tales. So we 
decided to hire a canoe and poler for four days through Island Safaris, at the 
lodge. 
</P>
<P>
Kay Potter, who operates the lodge with her husband Phil, recommends using 
Fiberglas canoes rather than the traditional mokoros, which are carved from 
sausage trees. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to chop down a sausage tree to make a mokoro," she said. "Before long 
the trees will be gone. Besides, you get a wet bum in a mokoro. I guarantee 
it." We were to get "wet bums" anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The next day a speedboat took us into the Delta. As we went deeper, the winding 
pathway through the lily pads grew narrower. The boatman moved expertly through 
the tortuous channels at breakneck speed. Every so often he would stop and 
reverse the motor, when the prop became clogged with reeds. 
</P>
<P>
After two hours we reached an island inhabited by polers who were sitting 
around a fire making coffee in tin cans and cooking mielie meal. Mielie meal, 
the staple food in sub-Saharan Africa, is like thick grits. It fills you up but 
won't put meat on your bones. A telltale sign: There wasn't an overweight man 
among the polers. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't pay much heed to us when we arrived. But eventually Kenneth Monare, 
a tall, barefoot man wearing shorts and a blue T-shirt, approached us. He would 
be our pilot and guide for the next four days. 
</P>
<P>
We were lucky. Kenneth spoke English and enjoyed practicing it with us. He also 
taught us a few Setswana phrases. Although English is the official language of 
Botswana, Setswana, a Bantu language of the Tswana tribe, is spoken by 90% of 
its population. 
</P>
<P>
Monare's friend Kid, a shorter man wearing a BMW jacket, piloted the other 
canoe in our party, which also included a Canadian couple who were traveling 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
When the polers were ready, we glided out into a channel bound for Chief's 
Island, the main island in Moremi Wildlife Reserve (set up by the Tswana tribe 
in 1962 to protect the animals) and one of the best game reserves in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth stood in the stern and began rhythmically poling us forward. The prow 
of the canoe parted the reeds that sprouted like stubble from the water. 
Sometimes a spider, while stretching a web between the reeds, would fall into 
our canoe. 
</P>
<P>
The spiders were fat, dark and fuzzy, though non-poisonous. We would either 
toss them out of the canoe or carry them along with us to another part of the 
Delta. The webs were often so beautiful that I felt sad, as if we had destroyed 
a work of art. 
</P>
<P>
The Delta is a palette of colors: yellow water lilies, white and pink flowers 
against the reeds, tiny green frogs on lily pads. 
</P>
<P>
When we passed another canoe Kenneth would greet his fellow poler with a hearty 
"dumela!" ("hello" in Setswana). I marveled at how he could navigate the delta 
maze in which channels become dead ends clogged by vegetation. Some of the 
channels are kept open only because hippos break through the reeds. 
</P>
<P>
We reached our first campsite on Chief's Island after three hours and a bit too 
much sun. Later, we took the canoe out to get water for cooking and to 
photograph the sunsets. The nights, what with the campfires and the stars, 
reminded me of my childhood camping trips. 
</P>
<P>
When we were quiet we were treated to a cacophony of exotic sounds: the screech 
of baboons . . . hippo grunts . . . the plaintive songs of crickets, frogs, 
birds . . . an insect that sounded like the tinkling of a toy piano, and the 
eerie cackling of hyenas. 
</P>
<P>
As we brushed our teeth we saw two yellow eyes of a bush baby, a nocturnal 
primate, staring at us through the trees. 
</P>
<P>
The sounds of mosquitoes were considerably less exciting. I was glad that I was 
wearing mosquito repellent and taking anti-malaria medication. Malaria is the 
main hazard in the delta. It's unlikely that one would be bitten by tsetse 
flies, crocodiles, lions, leopards or poisonous snakes, but anyone who goes 
into the delta and doesn't take precautions against malaria is foolish. 
</P>
<P>
In the morning Kenneth took us to another spot on the northern part of Chief's 
Island, a place that abounds with game. We passed a deep pool where hippos were 
wallowing. Kenneth and Kid kept their distance. I was aware that an angry hippo 
could smash a canoe to bits. But Kenneth, with typical African tour guide 
aplomb, said there was little danger. 
</P>
<P>
"They're very frightened," he said, as a snort came up from a hippo. Nine times 
out of 10 he's right. Of course I'd hate to be too close on that occasion when 
a hippo does decide to charge. 
</P>
<P>
As we approached our destination Kenneth and Kid found that the channel had 
shifted and was only a few inches deep. The thick swamp grasses made it 
impossible to move forward. After a futile effort, Kenneth gave us the command: 
"Get out!" 
</P>
<P>
We rolled up our pants legs and began to push the canoes through the reeds. We 
splashed through the mushy swamp. Now, I'm not one who particularly enjoys 
sticking his feet into swamp water. I had visions of leeches covering my 
calves. I feared it might be time for the crocodiles to have a picnic. I guess 
I identify more with Woody Allen than Indiana Jones. 
</P>
<P>
We reached our campsite tired but exhilarated. I looked back at the area we had 
just crossed -- a field of tans and yellows fading into the blue sky. 
</P>
<P>
This part of the island was deserted except for the animals. We followed 
Kenneth on walking safaris. He led us for hours as he followed smells, tracks 
and droppings through the brown grass and gnarled trees. He had to quiet us 
several times to avoid frightening the animals. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, after hours of walking, he put up his hand to halt us. Several 
zebra, wildebeest, tsesebe antelope and warthogs came out in front of us, no 
more than 10 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
We were on the trail of an elephant. We could smell its musk-like odor but we 
never found it. I had seen elephants before, but always from the safety of a 
vehicle. I feared the possibility of coming face to face with one of the huge 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
But we probably were safe in Kenneth's hands. He had a keen sense of the smells 
and sounds of the delta -- where to go and, perhaps more important, where not 
to go. His calm and self-confidence was reassuring. 
</P>
<P>
On our last night I realized why Kenneth wanted Kid to come along. They joked 
and laughed together, making the trip relaxed and fun for all of us. But Kid 
was also a master fisherman. He took a drop line, crouched by the water's edge 
and snared 20 fish. 
</P>
<P>
Kid and Kenneth used four of the fish to make a stew for themselves, and saved 
the rest for their fellow polers. I feared that perhaps the fish would be the 
appetizer and we would be the main course for some predator -- a leopard, 
baboon or hyena, whose jaws are said to be the strongest of all animals. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, hyenas are known to attack humans while they sleep, which is why it's 
important to keep your tent flap zipped up. But in the morning the fish were 
still dangling on the line. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth showed us his calloused hands, which told the story of his years as a 
poler. The lodge pays him 5 pula (about $2.50) a day plus food. (Passengers are 
expected to tip their poler at the end of the trip.) 
</P>
<P>
He told us that someday he would like to own his own mokoro. But you need to 
pay a teacher 200 to 300 pula to show you how to build one. Besides that, 
Kenneth had to think about saving enough pulas to someday pay for a bride. 
Payment to the parents of the bride used to be in cattle; now you can pay in 
pulas (or VCRs in some parts of Africa). 
</P>
<P>
I was happy I didn't have to worry about a bride's price. Then again, I would 
soon return to a complex world of jumbo jets and grid-locked cities, and 
somehow the life of the poler seemed more civilized and appealing. 
</P>
<P>
As we rode back to the Island Safari Lodge in a powerboat at what now seemed 
like a frenetic pace, I hoped that there would always be room in this world for 
the polers, expertly plying the uncharted delta waters.

THE SAVVY TRAVELER: FREQUENT-FLIER MILES COMPLICATED, ALTHOUGH NOT IMPOSSIBLE, 
TO SPEND; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: WHAT LOOKED LIKE AN INGENUOUS MARKETING PLAN BACKFIRED WHEN 
FREQUENT-FLIERS SUDDENLY BEGAN CASHING IN TRIPLE MILEAGE AWARDS. TO COMPENSATE, 
CARRIERS HAVE CHANGED THEIR RULES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER S. GREENBERG, Greenberg is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The madness started two years ago when Delta Airlines thought it had discovered 
a marketing bonanza. The airline sent letters to its frequent-flier program 
members announcing a special mileage bonus deal: For each member flying Delta 
and using an American Express credit card, Delta would award triple mileage. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed like a profitable arrangement for both Delta and American Express. 
The airline would get passengers and American Express would get ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
But before the Delta deal got off the ground, Eastern Airlines tried a little 
one-upmanship. Eastern announced that anyone who flew Eastern, regardless of 
the form of payment, would receive triple mileage. 
</P>
<P>
The war commenced. Within days, every major U.S. airline got caught up in the 
triple-mileage madness. In short order, travelers didn't have to be frequent 
fliers to rack up big mileage in record time. 
</P>
<P>
That's the good news. But what can you do with those miles? 
</P>
<P>
The airlines had always defended the mileage programs within their industry as 
cost-effective, because of low redemption levels. While no specific figures are 
available, three senior airline officials of competing airlines told me that 
only 5% to 7% of all miles earned are ever redeemed. 
</P>
<P>
One reason redemption levels had been low was that those who earned high 
mileage had flown so frequently they were probably the last ones eager to get 
on a plane again. Another reason may have been that frequent fliers seemed more 
interested in reaching the next award level than in cashing in their existing 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to triple mileage offers, those award levels were reached much faster 
than anyone anticipated. Suddenly, record numbers of passengers were cashing in 
their miles for free or discount trips. What had looked like a profitable 
marketing idea had turned into a potential disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The airlines already had agreed to a mandate by a number of state attorney 
generals not to change eligibility or mileage levels without sufficient notice 
to members, so changing award levels was out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
But airlines, suddenly confronted with the numbers -- a significant 
accumulation of unredeemed miles -- have begun to significantly change the 
bonus game. 
</P>
<P>
Do the words "blackouts" and "capacity controls" ring a bell? If you've tried 
to redeem any of your awards, then you know these terms well. More than ever, 
the airlines want to control when you fly and where you fly, even the routing 
of those flights you can get on using a bonus award ticket. 
</P>
<P>
For example: You've earned an award ticket to Hawaii, and you call the 
participating airline to book your seats, only to discover that "there are no 
mileage award seats available on your flight." 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't necessarily mean the flight is sold out. What it does mean is that 
the airline has severely limited the number of free seats that can be booked on 
popular routes. On some Hawaii flights, airlines have allowed only two seats 
per flight to be awarded to frequent flier redeemers. 
</P>
<P>
Does this mean you are out of luck if you didn't get one of those seats and you 
want to go to Hawaii? Not necessarily. If a reservations agent tells you that 
no award seats are available, but that there are seats available on the flight 
itself, ask to speak to a supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
A frequent-flier program exists, after all, to reward passenger loyalty. A 
gentle reminder to a supervisor of your loyalty can sometimes result in an 
agent overriding his or her airline's computer and issuing you a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
The latest frequent-flier bonus, called "one free for three," good through 
April 6, promises a free ticket if you fly three round trips between now and 
then. 
</P>
<P>
But read the fine print carefully. United and American, for example, offer the 
deal if you fly three round trips costing at least $98. But the resulting free 
ticket is good only in the continental United States and only in the fall, and 
there are holiday blackouts and other restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Continental offers the deal after only two round trips. But the qualifying 
fares must be at least $196 each. To make matters worse, qualifying trips must 
be taken between a Sunday and a Friday. (What this means is, you can't book an 
excursion fare on Continental that requires a Saturday night stay, which 
usually means a lower air fare.) Again, check out when you can use the free 
ticket you've earned. 
</P>
<P>
If you're a member of Northwest's frequent-flier program, called "Worldperks," 
don't be surprised to find an occasional free ticket in the mail. That's 
Northwest's way of disposing of accumulated mileage. 
</P>
<P>
The airline now automatically sends its program members tickets when they reach 
20,000-mile award levels. But each ticket has an expiration date, as well as a 
list of blackout dates and other restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
There are some airlines that have somehow managed to stay out of the 
frequent-flier craziness. 
</P>
<P>
"We've watched all this frequent flier stuff with a certain amount of amusement 
and a great amount of concern," says Herbert Legner, deputy vice president of 
Austrian Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided that a frequent-flier program is a good idea if you're the first 
one and the only one. After that it becomes an expensive headache." 
</P>
<P>
Still, when Austrian Airlines recently decided to enter the U.S. market (with 
nonstop flights between New York and Vienna), it reluctantly started a 
frequent-flier program. But instead of awarding free tickets on Austrian 
Airlines, the program rewards fliers with cash in the form of "MCO" tickets. 
MCO stands for "Miscellaneous Charge Order," and is a negotiable form of 
airline currency. 
</P>
<P>
The Austrian program rewards "cash" based on mileage; MCO tickets are issued 
when a member's account rises above $400. The "cash" can then be used as credit 
toward the purchase of tickets on virtually any major airline in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Cathay Pacific has also managed to avoid frequent-flier programs. The Hong 
Kong-based carrier, while a partner in other U.S. airline programs, offers no 
real mileage program to its regular passengers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're happy about that," said Peter Sutch, Cathay's deputy chairman and chief 
executive officer. "These programs have reached ludicrous heights in the United 
States, and sooner or later that unredeemed mileage has to be accounted for on 
your balance sheet." 
</P>
<P>
One more thing. While no one was looking, triple mileage snuck back in. Alaska 
Airlines is offering triple mileage to its program members through April 6. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am, eager to drum up much-needed business during these slow off-season 
months, is offering triple miles to its frequent fliers until April 15. Any Pan 
Am or Pan Am Express flight within the United States (including Hawaii), and to 
Bermuda, the Caribbean or Mexico (even within the Caribbean) qualifies for 
triple mileage. 
</P>
<P>
On flights between the United States and Europe, India, Pakistan or Africa, 
between Europe and India, Pakistan or Africa or on Pan Am flights within 
Europe, the airline awards double the actual miles flown.

DANCING THE NIGHT AWAY IN TOKYO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'm not the kind of guy who would be out dancing and carousing till 5 o'clock 
in the morning. So why was I out on a Saturday night in late July in the middle 
of Roppongi doing just that? 
</P>
<P>
Any Tokyoite knows that Roppongi is the liveliest, trendiest, most 
international part of the city by night, where some of the finest cafes, bars, 
restaurants, jazz clubs and discotheques are. 
</P>
<P>
I'm no stranger to the city. I grew up in next-door Yokohama and have returned 
to Tokyo many times to visit my family. But I'd had my fill of temples and 
gardens and all those historic places in the big city. I was curious about 
Tokyo's many bars and nightclubs, and the disco-crazed people I'd read about in 
the magazines. 
</P>
<P>
Roppongi has more than 40 discos -- eight in one building alone -- and a 
per-block density of restaurants and bars that would astonish even a jaded New 
Yorker. 
</P>
<P>
Walking around Roppongi, what amazed me was the sense of safety I felt from the 
crowd: Even at 5 in the morning the streets were full of people, which is 
probably not the case with other night centers around Tokyo -- Ginza, Shinjuku 
or Shibuya. 
</P>
<P>
On a side street, off the main Gaien Higashi avenue, I was attracted to a group 
of about 20, a melange of foreign and Japanese men and women, milling about in 
front of a bar. 
</P>
<P>
Deja Vu is an American-style bar that was complete with tall gorgeous blondes 
and handsome Teutonic hunks -- obviously some of the American fashion models 
making mega yen in the money capital of the world. 
</P>
<P>
The bar displayed more than a hundred kinds of whiskeys. So why was everyone 
drinking bottles of Corona beer with slices of lime floating inside? Following 
the folkways of Los Angeles, perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
A sign outside emphatically stated in English, "No Military Personnel Allowed!" 
But that hadn't deterred the guy next to me at the bar, a sailor stationed at 
Yokosuka Naval Base a couple of hours' train ride away. 
</P>
<P>
He seemed utterly suave and wholesome compared to the tattooed biker in 
semi-tattered clothes talking to a voluptuous woman in short-short blue jeans. 
Meanwhile, the jukebox blared out an innocuous beat -- Bon Jovi? No matter. The 
crowd -- about 40% Japanese, the rest Westerners, mostly Americans by my 
educated guess -- was oblivious. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, the colorful neon lights were fading with dawn's soft glow, but the 
crowd at Deja Vu showed no sign of thinning out. I walked half a block up the 
street in search of my old hangout. The Hamburger Inn, a Roppongi landmark for 
almost 40 years, was still there, looking a lot spiffier. I hadn't been there 
in more than 20 years, when it had been just about the only place open all 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Compared with the people at Deja Vu, this crowd was more lethargic -- zonked 
might be a better word -- as they listened to and watched the rock group Guns 
N' Roses on a laser-disc jukebox, complete with visuals. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just killing time waiting for the subway," a Japanese college kid told me 
sleepily. A familiar story from old times. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street a tiny pub called Mistral Blue was packed, despite the late 
hour. "This is about the safest place to play, this Roppongi," the bouncer told 
me outside, glancing at a couple of drunks who seemed to be heading toward the 
wrong end of a row of taxicabs. "I was robbed down to my undershorts in 
Shinjuku. That would never happen here," he added with conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Before I started my night tour of Roppongi I rendezvoused in Shibuya with a 
school chum and neighbor from my Yokohama days. Francais, a kissaten or place 
where one can leisurely talk for hours and listen to music for the price of a 
$3 cup of coffee, was a familiar place, having been another hangout from my 
teen years. It's conveniently across the street from the Shibuya station. 
</P>
<P>
The decor hadn't changed much over the years, unlike the other kissaten that 
have been transformed into post-modern discomfort. The district of Shibuya, 
which is a few miles east of Roppongi, isn't the hick town it used to be 20 
years ago. Now it lures away shoppers from the Ginza district and other parts 
of metropolitan Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its inexpensive shops and restaurants, it's popular with the high 
school and college crowd. Called the "Shibu-Caji" (Shibuya casual), they wear 
blue jeans, bright T-shirts and leather jackets, trying to imitate the looks 
and mores of America. 
</P>
<P>
We hopped onto the subway to Omote-sando, a neighborhood of trendy boutiques 
and restaurants, but it was too quiet, so we inevitably ended up in Roppongi. 
The Almond coffee shop (pronounced amando by the locals), painted a garish 
pink, is a landmark at the district's busy main intersection. 
</P>
<P>
We had a dazzling choice of fine restaurants, everything from African to 
Russian, but we were in the mood for traditional Japanese cuisine and headed 
for the Goninbyakusho ("Five Farmers"), which serves country-style food in an 
attractive farmhouse setting. 
</P>
<P>
There we were greeted with an energetic "Irasshaimase!" (Welcome!), and our 
shoes deposited in an old-fashioned geta (wooden clogs) box, of the type still 
used in public baths in Japan. We feasted on sashimi, charcoal grilled fish and 
shrimp, cold bean curd and fresh-brewed sake. The seafood was delightfully 
fresh, the sake properly chilled. 
</P>
<P>
Goninbyakusho is the last thing you would expect in a building full of wildly 
decorated discotheques. Popularly known as the Disco Building, its real name is 
Square -- obviously a misnomer, with clubs such as Bingo Bango Bongo and Java 
Jive inside. The building's six other discotheques also have distinctly 
un-Japanese-sounding names: Bio, Nepenta, Venus, Giza, Buzz, the Circus. 
</P>
<P>
We tried the Circus first, on the top (10th) floor, but it was packed. It was 
prime time on Saturday night, around 9 p.m. The place was decorated with 
vintage American neon signs -- Pabst beer was one -- and with odd messages, 
such as "You are guileless in your dream" and "People who go crazy are too 
sensitive!" 
</P>
<P>
This is Roppongi's current hot spot, featuring black American DJs and their 
selection of soul music. The crowd was mostly college kids and office workers 
in their early 20s. According to a Japanese magazine survey, about 20% of the 
crowd are foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
We decided to leave the Disco Building to look for a less crowded place. In the 
same block there are Razzle Dazzle and Queue; around the corner, past Cipango 
and Area, is Lexington Queen. This is where you look for famous international 
musicians who are on tour in Japan. Kenny Rogers was there recently, a local 
magazine proclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
We headed for a familiar establishment from years back, a place called Kentos 
on the other side of the main Roppongi street, Gaien Higashi. The place has 
flourished with the retro boom of recent years; '50s and '60s rock 'n' roll is 
still very popular in Japan. Luckily, Kentos wasn't too crowded or expensive, 
and we were happy to see there were plenty of people over 30. 
</P>
<P>
But no Westerners. It was fun to watch the Japanese performers imitate everyone 
from the Beatles to Elvis to Connie Francis. Only in Roppongi. 
</P>
<P>
What happened on the dance floor at Kentos is typically Japanese. Men and women 
face the rock band, forming a line, and dance -- not with anyone in particular, 
but as a group. Although they dance with much more abandon than in the 
traditional festival dances, still there is a certain symmetry, reminiscent of 
the bon-odori, the summer dance to appease the souls of the departed, in which 
kimono-clad men and women form a circle and dance around a tower on which 
drummers and other musicians perform. 
</P>
<P>
At about 11:30 p.m. something peculiar happened: Half the clientele at Kentos 
suddenly rushed out. I asked a waiter if the place was closing and he replied, 
"Not yet. But they've got to catch the last train out." Of course. 
</P>
<P>
I remembered the times I had to run to catch that subway and connect to the 
To-yoko Line, the last train out just past midnight. Missing it meant an 
expensive taxi ride. Luckily, on this visit I was staying at my mother's house 
not far from Roppongi. 
</P>
<P>
We decided to move on. It was past midnight by then, but the streets were 
crowded with weekend revelers. We walked down Gaien Higashi avenue toward the 
Tokyo Tower, just before the intersection with Highway No. 2. On the right is a 
discotheque called Hot Corocket (meaning croquette, a popular Japanese side 
dish). When I stopped in two years ago a Brazilian band was playing some fine 
batucata. Now a Jamaican reggae band was featured. 
</P>
<P>
We'd hit the jackpot: This was a first-rate band with authentic-looking 
Rastafarians. Upon a closer look, one guitarist was a Japanese with dreadlocks. 
</P>
<P>
Hot Corocket was smaller and cozier than Kentos, the setting and the clientele 
more urbane. The crowd included several European couples as well as groups of 
men dancing among themselves, perhaps too shy to ask the group of attractive 
women nearby to join them. The island rhythm and chant of the group was 
soothing; the drummer, gazing deeply toward the flickering disco lights, played 
as if entranced. 
</P>
<P>
By 3 a.m. we were exhausted, but were determined to sample as much of 
Roppongi's night life as possible. We headed on, toward the Hard Rock Cafe, a 
couple of blocks back toward the main Roppongi intersection. It was a good 
place to rest with a cup of coffee among the guitars and other memorabilia of 
famous musicians. 
</P>
<P>
Roppongi by day is a relatively quiet part of Tokyo, attracting upscale 
shoppers to its fancy boutiques, but mostly to the amazing variety of fine 
restaurants. The American and other foreign embassies and their residences are 
nearby; Ark Hills, a modern, upscale complex of hotel, theaters and mostly 
American business offices, is just down the street. 
</P>
<P>
Many longtime foreign residents of Japan, who prefer a more "authentic" 
Japanese setting such as the shitamachi (downtown) of Asakusa and elsewhere, 
refer with scorn to Roppongi as the "gaijin (foreigner) ghetto." But to many 
Japanese it is precisely the international atmosphere that attracts them. 
</P>
<P>
Discos aren't the only draws here. Jazz, too, is very much alive and well in 
Roppongi. The Japanese branch of New York's Blue Note, Roppongi Pit Inn, Body 
and Soul and Satin Doll are popular jazz hangouts, although the quality of the 
music depends on who's playing on a given day. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the "pool bars" such as Block Shot, Milefiglio and Arviera 
Black. The latest rage in Tokyo and Yokohama, they are essentially fancy bars 
equipped with pool tables. The Hungry Diver Waku-Waku is another popular spot, 
a cafe bar with a variety of games including darts, chess and Scrabble. 
</P>
<P>
Also abundant in Roppongi -- and all over Japan, for that matter -- are karaoke 
bars. The word derives from kara (empty) and oke (orchestra). An elaborate 
gadget containing dozens of laser discs (called the karaoke set) provides 
background music from hundreds of Japanese and American hit tunes. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is that anyone can be in the limelight for a few minutes, and impress 
(or irritate) the audience with his singing. The bars provide customers with a 
catalogue of songs. When your turn comes, you take your place on a small stage, 
microphone in hand. The proprietor punches in a few numbers on the remote 
control and -- voila! -- a TV screen provides the backdrop and printed lyrics. 
Even the music's key is adjustable at a touch of the remote control. 
</P>
<P>
After two decades of popularity, karaoke has become entrenched in Japanese 
society as something everyone has to master or cope with, not just in bars and 
nightclubs but at company parties, trips, at the boss's home. When a cliff 
crumbled and boulders hit a tour bus last summer, among the dead was a man who 
still clutched a karaoke microphone. Presumably, he died singing. 
</P>
<P>
In Roppongi I was definitely not in the mood to sing for any crowd. By 6 a.m. I 
was ready to drop. I could have taken the subway back to my mother's, but 
decided to take a cab instead. 
</P>
<P>
"Where have you been?" my mother asked when she heard me stagger in. "I'll tell 
you after I get some sleep," I said weakly. 
</P>
<P>
Compared with those in New York or Washington, discotheques in Tokyo are 
expensive, particularly in the Roppongi district. The cover charge is anywhere 
between 3,000 and 5,000 yen ($21 to $35), which includes a drink or two and, 
occasionally, food. Women usually pay about 1,000 yen (about $7) less. 
Frequently, hawkers pass out discount tickets (worth 500 to 1,000 yen) to 
passers-by on the streets outside the building. 
</P>
<P>
There is a dress check at the entrance of some establishments. Casual wear, 
including blue jeans, is acceptable at many; coats and ties are required at a 
few. Both Area and Bio turn away people who look "too casual." The entrance 
check at Razzle Dazzle is the strictest; it's said that it turns away half its 
potential customers in its search for people with "distinctive style," whatever 
that may be. 
</P>
<P>
Most Roppongi discotheques are open daily from about 6 p.m. to past midnight. A 
sampling: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Java Jive (B-1), Giza (3rd floor), Buzz (5th floor), Venus (6th floor), 
Bingo Bango Bongo (7th floor), Nepenta (8th floor), Bio (9th floor), Circus 
(10th floor). All are in the Square or Disco Building, Roppongi 3-10-3. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

CROSS-COUNTRY SKIING AMID YOSEMITE VIEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every summer morning before sunrise, a slow trickle of cars begins to wind 
along this park's Glacier Point Road. As the day warms up the trickle becomes a 
steady stream, and by late afternoon the parking lot at road's end is usually 
full. 
</P>
<P>
What's the attraction? 
</P>
<P>
Most visitors make the 32-mile pilgrimage from the Yosemite Valley floor to 
Glacier Point for the view. From the edge of an airy overlook, people can look 
3,200 feet down into Yosemite Village. 
</P>
<P>
Across the valley one can see the entire 2,425-drop of Yosemite Falls. Behind 
Half Dome the rugged peaks of the High Sierra stand out in inspiring clarity. 
The view has been called the finest in Yosemite. 
</P>
<P>
But in winter, the road stops 10 1/2 miles short at the Badger Pass Ski Area. 
The final approach to Glacier Point, past the ski area's parking lot, lies 
buried beneath a thick blanket of snow. The area becomes a quiet wilderness, 
much as it must have been before the road was built. 
</P>
<P>
The cars and motor homes were gone when I visited in early December. The only 
traffic was an occasional Snow Cat, which left in its wake a seamless set of 
fresh tracks all the way to road's end. 
</P>
<P>
My friend Greg and I had come to follow these tracks and spend the night under 
the stars at Glacier Point. After registering with the Badger Pass back-country 
ranger, we filled our backpacks with layers of warm clothing, a tent, sleeping 
bags, cook stove and a weekend's worth of dehydrated food. 
</P>
<P>
We hiked off the pavement and slid our skis into the groomed tracks. The 
mechanized sounds of the downhill ski area and attendant parking lot were 
quickly muffled as we skied deeper into the snow-cloaked forest. 
</P>
<P>
We had entered another world, a boreal world of delicate snowflakes and 
crystalline icicles, where morning sun turns fresh hoarfrost into a thousand 
points of dazzling light on an open meadow, and mischievous winds send great 
piles of powdery snow cascading earthward from storm-laden fir trees. 
</P>
<P>
About 5 1/2 miles from Badger Pass the heavy forest that had lined the road 
gave way to a spectacular view of Clark Range, dominated by the 11,522-foot 
spire of Mt. Clark. 
</P>
<P>
It's possible to do the 21-mile round trip to Glacier Point and back in a day 
but it requires an early start and some stamina, because much of the trip back 
is uphill. 
</P>
<P>
Because we were spending the night out we could take our time and savor the 
views along the way. A long, lazy lunch and a snooze in the sun nicely broke up 
the 10 1/2-mile trek. 
</P>
<P>
If you're a beginner, the Glacier Point is the easiest trail and the only one 
that offers machine-groomed tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Although hilly in spots, the up-and-downhill grades are long and fairly gentle. 
If you're out just for the day and looking for a simple loop tour, several 
marked trails branch off and loop back to the road between Badger Pass and 
Glacier Point. 
</P>
<P>
A good choice for a moderate tour is Ghost Forest Loop, about a 10-mile round 
trip. Starting on Glacier Point Road, the loop leaves the main route after 3 
1/2 miles and winds through an eerie forest of dead lodgepole pines. 
</P>
<P>
On the way back to Badger Pass you can take the Old Glacier Point Road instead 
of retracing your route in. The terrain is varied, and a few brief hill runs on 
the Old Road keep things interesting. 
</P>
<P>
If you're looking for a more challenging route, follow Glacier Point Road one 
mile from the parking lot to Summit Meadow, then veer left onto Dewey Point 
Trail, a 7 1/2-mile round trip loop from the road. The trail crosses a series 
of open meadows before encountering some more difficult hills. 
</P>
<P>
Although not particularly steep, this route can be treacherous in icy 
conditions, especially if you have edgeless track skis. The trail ends on a 
spur of rock that juts into Yosemite Valley. 
</P>
<P>
On a clear day the view encompasses the entire valley, from the massive granite 
wall of El Capitan -- standing eye level across a 3,000-foot drop -- to 
Cathedral Rocks and the split face of Half Dome. 
</P>
<P>
After a few more miles on the road and a side trip to the top of Sentinel Dome, 
Greg and I skied down the final switchbacks to our campsite on Glacier Point. 
We set up the tent with a view of Half Dome from our front door. 
</P>
<P>
We stayed awake so we wouldn't miss the moonrise and the first stars of the 
evening. The sight of the snow-cloaked peaks and domes of the high country 
shining beneath a brilliant winter moon was spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
If the thought of camping on snow chills your ambition, there is a hut 
available for overnight use ($10 a night) at Ostrander Lake (18 miles round 
trip from Badger Pass). 
</P>
<P>
The hut sits in an open bowl below Horse Ridge at 8,600 feet, a great place to 
practice some telemarking. 
</P>
<P>
Three main trails lead to Ostrander Lake and the hut: Bridalveil Creek is the 
easiest (intermediate), Horizon Ridge a bit more challenging, and Merced Crest, 
for advanced skiers only, is the most difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Glacier Point Road is usually skiable from Thanksgiving to early April. During 
mid-winter Yosemite's high-mountain weather can be quite changeable, thus 
layered clothing is recommended. Late March and April typically bring clear 
skies and milder temperatures. There's plenty of "spring-corn" snow there now 
and conditions should be good for skiers. Daily lessons, rental skis and guided 
tours are all available through the Nordic School at Badger Pass. Call (209) 
372-1244. The Ski School offers a guided overnight tour to a private hut at the 
end of Glacier Point. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the Glacier Point hut tour is $90 per person, or $130 for two (five 
sign-ups are needed for a guided hut tour). The Ski School also offers guided 
six-day trans-Sierra tours for $350 per person. 
</P>
<P>
Registration is required for all overnight trips into the back country, and is 
obtainable from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Badger Pass Ranger A-Frame. For 
Ostrander Hut information and reservations, call (209) 379-2317. 
</P>
<P>
For information on Yosemite Valley lodging, call (209) 252-4848. Several 
campgrounds are open for winter camping: Lower Pines and Sunnyside Walk-In in 
Yosemite Valley, Wawona Campground on California 41, and Hodgon Meadow 
Campground at the Big Oak Flat Entrance on California 120 west. No fees are 
collected during winter.

CRUISE VIEWS: DON'T LOOK FOR SUBTLE DECOR ON FANTASY SHIP 
</P>

MIAMI, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you think "fifteen miles of neon tubing" is the title of a country song, as 
well as a description of the Caribbean's newest cruise ship, then you're half 
right. 
</P>
<P>
Boarding Carnival Cruise Lines' 2,600-passenger Fantasy is like walking into a 
giant jukebox. The miles of neon that stretch through the public rooms are 
computer activated at 4 o'clock each afternoon, turning alternately red, blue, 
lime green and mauve. 
</P>
<P>
Carnival is counting on attracting the sort of passenger who wants frenetic, 
nonstop action, with lots of flash and dazzle, on its year-round, three- and 
four-day voyages from Miami to the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
Once in Nassau, passengers will be offered free shuttle service to the new 
Crystal Palace Resort &amp; Casino, owned, not coincidentally, by Carnival. 
</P>
<P>
The decor aboard the the Fantasy is neither subtle nor understated. In the 
center of the six-deck Grand Spectrum, for example, roofed with a clear glass 
skylight, is a 20-foot-high kinetic sculpture in bright colors and geometric 
patterns by Israeli artist Yaacov Agam. 
</P>
<P>
Gliding up and down beside the massive Carrara marble staircase are two glass 
elevators outlined in red neon. The midnight blue carpet is covered with large 
white comets streaking rainbow trails. 
</P>
<P>
Lightning-flash neon dances off the mirrored floor and walls of the Electricity 
Disco. Alongside the 21st Century Bar, flashing with a running electronic 
billboard like something out of Times Square, is the largest casino afloat. 
</P>
<P>
Designer Joe Farcus' favorite, Cleopatra's Bar, is a replica of an Egyptian 
tomb, with sarcophagi, hieroglyphics and Egyptian gods and goddesses gathered 
around a glossy black piano bar. 
</P>
<P>
In Cats Lounge, patterned after the stage setting from the musical "Cats," the 
ceiling twinkles with fiber optics. Passengers enter through a giant Pet Milk 
can, table tops are replicas of bottle caps and jar lids, the bandstand is a 
huge black rubber tire, and arranged around the walls are Andy Warhol-like 
outsize cereal and soap boxes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's entertainment -- that's what this kind of room is all about," Farcus 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The stage in the show lounge is the most sophisticated aboard any ship, with 
space to raise and lower six backdrops and a large turntable in the center to 
revolve singers and scenery. 
</P>
<P>
The stage reverts to a dance floor by closing off the stage opening with a wall 
of beveled gold mirrors, covering the ceiling with a panel of mirrored Tivoli 
lights and raising the orchestra pit, sunken during the show, to the dancers' 
eye level. 
</P>
<P>
The ship also has a 1,200-square-foot spa with saunas, steam rooms, whirlpools, 
massage, luffa scrubs, aerobics and a gym with 35 exercise machines. A 500-foot 
banked and padded jogging track circles the topmost deck. 
</P>
<P>
Meals are capably prepared and served, but in hotel banquet rather than 
restaurant style. 
</P>
<P>
A raised wooden stage alongside the pool brings the midday beer-drinking 
contests and knobby knees competitions front and center for sunbathers, while 
the teen center and children's playroom, deck area and pool are thoughtfully 
isolated from the rest of the ship. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout, surfaces are cold and hard, featuring tile, marble, onyx and 
aluminum, and the carpeting is dark, durable-looking and short-napped. The 
message it sends is that it can take a lot of wear and tear, which it is likely 
to get on these short cruises. 
</P>
<P>
Carnival executives believe the mini-vacation will be the big trend in the 
1990s, not taking the place of longer cruises but in addition to them. On the 
Fantasy, as on the line's other three- and four-day ships, 90% of the 
passengers are first-timers testing the water before signing up for longer 
cruises. 
</P>
<P>
Cabins in the middle and upper price ranges are fairly spacious, most with two 
lower beds that can be put together, but the less expensive cabins are small 
and have upper and lower berths. Standard cabins have showers only. Suites 
feature Jacuzzi bathtubs and private balconies. 
</P>
<P>
Prices for inside (windowless) cabins range from $445 to $915 per person, 
double occupancy, depending on season and cabin location, for the three- and 
four-day cruises, including round-trip air fare from 150 cities. For outside 
cabins and suites the range runs from $695 to $1,135 per person, with air fare. 
</P>
<P>
Carnival's 1,500-passenger Jubilee, launched in 1986, is heading for Los 
Angeles to begin seven-day, round-trip sailings to Puerto Vallarta on a 
year-round basis. The first cruise sets sail April 8. Prices range from $995 to 
$2,395 per person, double occupancy, depending on cabin and season. Those fares 
include round-trip air fare, so Los Angeles-area residents can deduct an 
additional $200 per person for getting themselves to and from San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
While not as glitzy as the Fantasy, the Jubilee has plenty of razzle-dazzle of 
its own, from an Oz Disco in shades of Emerald City green to a casino ceiling 
of stained-glass face cards and a weathered, corrugated tin warehouse from 
Sweden reassembled inside one of the bars.

FOOTLOOSE: EXPLORING MOROCCO'S TAROUDANT 
</P>

TAROUDANT, Morocco 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just when you're suffering a sensory overload from the heady bouquet of roses, 
honeysuckle and jasmine on a balmy desert evening, a glance upward reveals a 
black bowl of desert sky pierced by what seems like thousands of stars hanging 
above this ancient walled town of southern Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
Then, to top things off, a muezzin mounts the minaret of a mosque for the last 
of his five daily calls to prayer, wailing his shrill entreaty for the faithful 
to join him in facing Mecca. The effect on a visitor is indelible. 
</P>
<P>
Although Taroudant has been a hotbed of intrigue and warring desert tribes 
since the 10th Century, the sublime beauty of its four miles of ochre-colored, 
crenelated walls have been spared to enclose an oasis of orange trees, palms, 
bougainvillea and hibiscus, plus the centuries-old former palace of a pasha. 
</P>
<P>
The French ignored Taroudant during their period of protectorate (1912-1956), 
so th town has no broad and orderly boulevards as have many other Moroccan 
cities. Nor are there hordes of tourists, faceless hotels, tacky fast-food 
joints and familiar souvenir shops. 
</P>
<P>
Getting here: Fly KLM, Air France, Lufthansa or Iberia to Casablanca, then 
Royal Air Maroc on to Agadir. Advance-purchase, round-trip economy fares for 
flights from Los Angeles to Casablanca range from $999 to $1,106. The 
Casablanca-Agadir leg is $55. Take a bus or rental car from Agadir. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much? Give Taroudant two days, including time for visits to nearby 
cities. Lodging and dining costs are moderate. 
</P>
<P>
A few fast facts: The Moroccan dirham recently traded at 7.32 to the dollar. 
April-May and September-October are ideal times to visit, with inland Morocco 
very hot but humidity-free in summer, and most pleasant in winter except in the 
chilly mountains. Bottled water is a must at all times. A visa is not needed. 
</P>
<P>
Getting settled in: That 200-year-old pasha's palace is the Palais Salam Hotel 
($57-$82 B&amp;B double), a maze of courtyards and patios, gardens and 
fountains, with the entryway an old gate through the city walls. It has two 
pools, continental and Moroccan restaurants and a coffee house with soft 
couches and ottomans. 
</P>
<P>
The more expensive rooms have a Moroccan-type salon, all decorated with the 
country's carpets, lamps and wall hangings. Service is friendly and adroit, and 
a pleasant woman sits in regional costume at a silver tea service in the lobby 
to greet you with a friendly "marhaba" (welcome) and the traditional glass of 
tea. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel Saadien ($38 double, half-pension) is at the heart of the medina (Old 
City), near the main square and souks (markets). It also has to be the bargain 
to end all bargains, because it's newly refurbished with neat and bright 
bedrooms, all in white, hand-painted furniture and Moroccan decor. 
</P>
<P>
The inner courtyard has a swimming pool, garden and dining area. Also it has a 
rooftop bar, a dining room and another terrace overlooking the town. The 
Saadien has its own pastry shop, with about 50 kinds of tempting sweets 
displayed. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: "You eat in Morocco with your eyes" is an old proverb, 
and the colorful food bears it out. Raise the lid of a tajine (a top-shaped 
cooking vessel), and the fresh and attractive meat and vegetables catch your 
attention immediately. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most colorful dishes to start with is the Moroccan salad, usually 
made up of fresh or cooked vegetables. Choose from a platter of an eggplant 
mixture, carrots with green herbs, tomatoes with sweet red onions and, 
invariably, beets. Harira (a thick chick pea soup) is also on most menus. 
</P>
<P>
Tajines of vegetables, meats and fish cooked in an earthenware vessel are the 
national dishes. And bstila or pastilla, a sweet pigeon pie with cinnamon, 
saffron and almonds wrapped in filo dough and dusted with powdered sugar, is a 
special treat. 
</P>
<P>
Moroccan beer in its midget bottles is nothing to shout about, but the red and 
white wines are pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
Good dining: You'll find good food at moderate prices in the Hotel Taroudant 
dining room, just off the main square in the medina. The hotel is modest in the 
extreme, but the $8 daily menu is marvelous. 
</P>
<P>
We started with Moroccan salads and rabbit pate, then a fine cheese souffle, 
followed by a lamb tajine with prunes and fresh almonds. It was one of the best 
dishes of the trip. Last came platters of cheeses and fruits. 
</P>
<P>
The Moroccan and continental dining rooms of Hotel Palais Salam were excellent. 
We sampled each, plus a luncheon in the flowery patio beneath trees by a 
tinkling fountain. The salad nicoise and poulet basque were superb. 
</P>
<P>
Restaurant Tout Va Bien at town center is an upstairs place where decor is 
nonexistent and there are no tablecloths. A salad-tajine-dessert-tea meal there 
costs less than $5, but don't count on any frills. 
</P>
<P>
Going first-class: La Gazelle d'Or (just outside town; $242 double occupancy, 
half-pension) has an international reputation as a pleasure dome in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
Its 30 bedrooms are palatial, with private terraces and wood-burning 
fireplaces, each with a view of the Atlas Mountains. A tented dining room will 
take your breath away. The pool is fed by spring water with year-round average 
temperature of 73 degrees. A dozen Arabian horses are available for riding in 
the desert. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: Start with a visit to the souks for inspecting a wondrous 
selection of ornate silver jewelry, swords and dirks, antique muskets and other 
handicrafts made locally. The big days for a general souk that brings in 
natives from the surrounding region are Thursday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Take a walk or carriage ride around the town walls and follow it up with a 
visit to Taiout, a Berber village 15 miles northwest. The Taiout souk is on 
Wednesday. Use your camera carefully, as these rural people are very jumpy 
about having their pictures taken. 
</P>
<P>
For more information: Call the Moroccan National Tourist Office at (213) 
271-8945, or write to 421 N. Rodeo Drive, Beverly Hills 90210 for a brochure on 
the road to the Kasbahs, showing many of the sights and towns of southern 
Morocco, complete with map. The map highlights major towns, scenic sites, 
transportation and festivals. Ask for the Taroudant package.

HER WORLD: IMAGES FROM A WANDERING MIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MORGAN, Morgan is a magazine and newspaper writer living in La Jolla. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My mind wanders as much as the rest of me, or maybe even more. Sometimes it 
slips away to a pink morning in Dar es Salaam when it is supposed to be 
following the evening news. Sometimes it retreats to the somber battlegrounds 
of Gettysburg, when it should be advancing on a deadline. 
</P>
<P>
My mind dredges up travel memories as if they were baubles that had lodged in 
the dark folds of a jewel chest -- out of sight, but within reach, if I just 
take the time to retrieve them. 
</P>
<P>
Travel books send my mind packing, and I often follow suit. A recent tempter 
was entitled: "Wake Up and Smell the Coffee." It is a lusty cookbook of recipes 
used by bed and breakfast inns of those Great Lakes neighbors, Wisconsin and 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
"Wake Up" was written by Laura Zahn, a spunky young woman from St. Paul who 
savors both breakfast and travel. She also has written guides to historic 
B&amp;Bs and country inns in both states. They're called "Room at the Inn." 
</P>
<P>
When I open her books I do smell the coffee -- just as I used to smell a musty 
old manor each time I read the Nancy Drew mystery, "The Ghost of Blackwood 
Hall." 
</P>
<P>
My grandmother insisted that what I smelled was the dank odor of the book 
itself, since I left it in the back yard during a drenching Oklahoma storm. 
</P>
<P>
Zahn's breakfast recipes remind me of a news story that outlined the courtship 
of hoteliers Leona and Harry Helmsley and their rendezvous at a French 
restaurant in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
"They dined there regularly in the warm light of scones and chandeliers," the 
story said. I had never realized that sconces could sound so tasty with the 
drop of a "c." 
</P>
<P>
And scones remind me of a fine brunch at the Eton Buttery by the River Thames, 
just across an iron footbridge from Windsor Castle. Eton lads rush by, wearing 
their gray tail coats; castle guides scurry toward St. George's Chapel wielding 
black umbrellas that also serve as pointers. 
</P>
<P>
There goes my wandering mind. 
</P>
<P>
When it rains, a hair dryer is handy. I met a California scientist who told me 
that he never leaves for even an overnight conference without his high-powered, 
compact dryer. But his hair is not the primary concern. 
</P>
<P>
"In some humid climates I would never get my laundry dry without a hair dryer," 
he said.

It was beginning to rain near the cathedral in Caracas when a native woman 
approached a pal of mine. 
</P>
<P>
She looked at him imploringly and pushed her infant into his arms. Suddenly, he 
remembered that he had put his wallet in his hip pocket after his last 
purchase; he slapped at his rear. The pocket was already unbuttoned, but the 
wallet was still there. 
</P>
<P>
Two boys fled into the crowd. The woman and baby were gone when he turned. An 
old ruse that almost worked. My red-faced friend moved his wallet to an inside 
pocket. 
</P>
<P>
A favorite bathroom in Florence is tucked away in an unlikely place, even for 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
As you climb the broad marble stair toward Michelangelo's Medici Chapel in the 
church of San Lorenzo, there is a small sign on the left: "W.C." Part of the 
banister and wall pushes in, like a secret panel. Beyond are stone steps 
leading to restrooms that are modern, clean and well-lighted. They seem 
incongruous in this vast tomb of Renaissance wonders. 
</P>
<P>
A favorite quote in a guidebook of yesteryear is from the erudite "Murray's 
Handbook to Greece," which was published in Britain in 1884. 
</P>
<P>
The book offers the following reassurance to 19th-Century travelers to Athens: 
"Any Englishman having the usual knowledge of ancient Greek will be able to 
read the Athenian papers with ease." 
</P>
<P>
And that reminds me of a favorite line overheard in a Ft. Worth bar. A Texas 
cowman pounded his fist and shouted to a companion: "I'm eruditer than you 
are." 
</P>
<P>
The mind wanders and is boggled.

THE TIMES SHOPPER: SAMPLING A FEW OF TOKYO'S LONG-LASTING BUT PLASTIC FOOD 
DELICACIES ... 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
TOKYO, Japan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Food here is prepared as a feast for the eyes and body. But sometimes it's a 
feast only for the eyes. 
</P>
<P>
We find such snacks, resembling the dishes served inside, in windows of many 
Japanese restaurants. The plastic models of the foods are varied: crispy 
Japanese tempura, plump Chinese dumplings, cheesy pizzas, frothy beverages, 
dewy salads, and for homesick Americans -- plump and juicy hamburgers. 
</P>
<P>
These plastic, food models, commonly referred to as "samples," are considered 
commonplace by the Japanese, sort of visual menus to tempt passers-by. But the 
best samples, those that are highly realistic and detailed, are being collected 
by foreigners, who classify them as a sort of contemporary Japanese pop art 
form. 
</P>
<P>
Food samples have been exhibited at the prestigious Museum of Modern Art in New 
York City, for example, and are now part of the museum's permanent study 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
Some buyers, however, aren't looking for modern art, but for fun. Practical 
jokers set tempting steins of cold beer or bowls of miso soup in front of 
unsuspecting dinner guests. Creative collectors turn sushi samples into 
earrings or tie tacks or use sliced pizza as a paper weight. 
</P>
<P>
Quality varies and so does the price. The best samples are handmade and require 
painstaking work to make them realistic. 
</P>
<P>
The highest quality tempura samples show every crisp flake clinging to each 
pink shrimp. Such tempura fakes can sell for four to five times what the real 
food would cost, and, if properly cared for, will last for ages . . . long 
after the calories of the real thing have been burned. 
</P>
<P>
Less expensive sample models, mass produced in Korea, may be garish, with 
shrimp tails slightly too red to be believed and batter that's a bit too 
golden. 
</P>
<P>
Or they can be made of wax rather than plastic, and therefor are more 
perishable. Also, the reduced prices reflect their mass-produced manufacture. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows for sure, but samples first appeared during the 1920s, shortly 
after wax reproductions of human organs used in medical studies were introduced 
in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The food samples were beautiful but, because they were made of wax, the colors 
faded and they melted in heat. 
</P>
<P>
It was inevitable that after plastic was invented it would eventually become 
the fake food medium. Although several factories are taking credit, nobody 
knows just who sculpted the first plastic samples, which appeared about 20 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Most manufacturers use the same basic manufacturing methods. First, real food 
is artistically arranged to make the molds that are then filled with a melted 
mixture of colored plastics. 
</P>
<P>
After the sample shape is set, details are painted on by hand. The fat on a 
pork chop is crisped, cucumber skins are dappled and flecks of seaweed are 
added to bowls of rice in which each morsel has been individually shaped and 
glued in place. For complex pieces, elements are created separately, then put 
together like three dimensional puzzles. Each sample is unique. 
</P>
<P>
The process may seem relatively simple, but competing manufacturers carefully 
guard their sample recipes and are constantly experimenting to develop better 
products. 
</P>
<P>
Like great chefs, trained craftsmen teach apprentices to sample-making 
techniques, which are part art, part chemistry. Apprenticeships can last as 
long as 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Factories make special order items, but their biggest trade is in the 
standards, such as tempura and sushi. 
</P>
<P>
These are available over-the-counter in retail stores in Kappabashi, a 
working-class district in northeast Tokyo, near the famous Asakusa Kannon 
temple nd the popular museums at Ueno. Along a five or six block span of Nishi 
Asakusa and several side streets, shoppers can find an extensive selection of 
samples. 
</P>
<P>
There are platters of tomato sauce-drenched spaghetti that have vertical 
columns of twisted noodles erupting from the center. Atop each of these noodle 
volcanoes sits a silver fork. 
</P>
<P>
Or feast your eyes on small porcelain pitchers perched delicately atop streams 
of cream cascading into cups of pitch-black coffee. Prices vary, depending upon 
complexity of craftsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
These art works are reportedly the creation of Maizuru, one of Tokyo's finest 
sample manufacturers and retailers. 
</P>
<P>
Maizuru's shop (1-5-17 Nishi Asakusa) displays a wide variety of samples. There 
are exotic drinks decorated with orchids and other flowers (about $28) and 
sizzling bacon and eggs that looks fresh off the grill (about $18). 
</P>
<P>
California sushi rolls cost $14 to $25, and other sushi is $5 to $8. That plate 
of spaghetti with the airborne fork costs about $30 and the coffee cup with the 
poised pitcher is $300. 
</P>
<P>
Another respected manufacturer, Tokyo Biken &amp; Co. (1-5-11 Nishi Asakusa), 
sells steins of beer for $35 and never-melt dishes of green tea or azuki bean 
ice cream for $38. Fried shrimp perched temptingly on a bowl of rice costs $30. 
A perfectly ripe half-melon costs about $200. 
</P>
<P>
Or visit Satoh Sample (3-7-4 Nishi Asakusa), a small, cluttered, well-stocked 
shop with samples ranging from an entire steamed fish ($50 and up) to 
refreshing-looking snow cones (about $22). 
</P>
<P>
Loose leaves of fake lettuce (about $5 each) and individual crinkle-cut French 
fries (about $3 each) spill out from wooden drawers, bins and cardboard boxes. 
That plump and juicy hamburger for the homesick costs about $25. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are sample factories in several cities in Japan, Tokyo is the 
only place to buy them. 
</P>
<P>
How can you tell if you're getting your money's worth? 
</P>
<P>
If the sample looks good enough to eat, you know it's high-quality. While 
prices generally are from $5 to $300, made-to-order foods can cost more. Prices 
depend on the work and the workmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices quoted in this article reflect currency exchange rates at the time of

DON'T LET RAIN DAMPEN SPIRITS

Juneau, Alaska's capital and gateway to the southeast wilderness areas, has a 
temperate climate during the summer months. 
</P>
<P>
I prefer August, the end of the dry season, because of its mild, warm days and 
cool nights. There's still the summer lushness, but with a hint of coming 
autumn. Be prepared for rain. It's part of the southeast experience and not 
unpleasant. 
</P>
<P>
Juneau offers various accommodations, including an excellent hostel -- the 
Juneau International Hostel, 614 Harris St., Juneau, Alaska 99801, (907) 
586-9559. It's $7 a night for members of American Youth Hostels, $10 for 
nonmembers. Reservations are accepted. 
</P>
<P>
There are two bed and breakfast inns: Mullins House, 526 Seward, Juneau 99801, 
(907) 586-3384, and Frances House (same address and phone). Rooms are $50 to 
$60 per night, double. 
</P>
<P>
The Alaskan Hotel, a registered landmark, offers accommodations with a Gold 
Rush flair -- 167 S. Franklin St., Juneau 99801, (907) 586-1000. Rooms $45 to 
$50 double. 
</P>
<P>
The Baranof Hotel, 127 N. Franklin St., Juneau 99801, (800) 544-0970, $89 
double, and Westmark, 51 W. Egan Drive, Juneau 99801, (800) 478-1111. Rooms 
$96, double. Accommodations more deluxe than others. 
</P>
<P>
Another good choice is the Driftwood Lodge, 435 Willoughby Ave., Juneau 99801, 
(800) 544-2239, which charges $62 double. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, regularly scheduled service to Tracy Arm and Ford's Terror will be 
offered twice weekly through Alaska Naturalist &amp; Photography Cruise Tours, 
9951 Spruce Wood Park, Juneau 99801, (907) 789-7429. Round-trip cost is about 
$90. 
</P>
<P>
Wilderness Swift Charters, P.O. Box 022026, Juneau 99802, will transport and 
pick up Tracy Arm kayakers. Cost for a vessel is $1.50 per mile. In addition, 
virtually any charter vessel big enough would be willing to charter to that 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Juneau Sportfishing, P.O. Box 20438-JT, Juneau 99802, (907) 586-1887, will set 
people up with charter vessels, most of which are big enough to accommodate 
hard-shell kayaks. 
</P>
<P>
Kayak and equipment rentals are available through Alaska Discovery, 369 S. 
Franklin St., Juneau 99801, (907) 463-5500. 
</P>
<P>
Double kayaks rent for $40 a day. Guided trips also are available. Alaska 
Discovery is a good source to consult before planning any kayak adventure. For 
more information on travel to the Juneau area, contact the Davis Log Cabin 
Visitor Information Center, 134 3rd St., Juneau 99801, (907) 586-2201 or 
586-2284. JAMES STEELE

FINDING YOUR OWN COMFORT ZONE IN ONE GEM OF A COUNTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Lyndon Stambler 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Botswana is a peaceful country of 1.2 million people, most of whom live along 
the eastern border with South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
If all you saw was the 1980 South African movie "The Gods Must Be Crazy," you 
might think of this country as primitive and backward. Most of Botswana is 
blanketed by the Kalahari Desert, where bushmen still hunt with arrows as they 
have for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
But Botswana also has one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa, mainly 
because it provides 25% of the world's gem diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
My Okavango excursion was the highlight of a 12-day loop through southern 
Africa. It began in Harare, Zimbabwe. We traveled south to Francistown, 
Botswana, northeast to Nata and west to Maun. After the canoe voyage we headed 
northeast to Chobe National Park and on to Victoria Falls. 
</P>
<P>
This trip was the rough way to see the Okavango Delta, and it's not for 
everyone. There are many more comfortable ways to go. Whether you fly to Maun 
and stay in a luxury camp or drive in a Land-Rover and camp out, you won't 
likely be disappointed once you get to the delta. 
</P>
<P>
Getting There: If you're driving, you need a four-wheel-drive vehicle; the 
190-mile stretch from Nata, which is halfway between Francistown and Maun, is 
made of a chalky gravel. Coming from Zimbabwe, as I was, Francistown is the 
first major town, about 58 miles southwest of the Zimbabwe border. 
</P>
<P>
A good stop-off point is Nata Lodge (Private Bag 10, Francistown) six miles 
south of Nata. The lodge has good accommodations and a nice restaurant. I 
stayed in the campground behind the lodge for five pula (about $2.50). Thatched 
huts and tented rooms also are available. Tented rooms cost slightly more than 
the campground; the huts are 60 pula ($30) a night. 
</P>
<P>
If you're flying to Maun you will likely have to go through Gabarone, the 
capital of Botswana. Carriers serving the area include Air Botswana, British 
Airways, Zambia Airways, Air Zimbabwe and South African Airways. 
</P>
<P>
Safari Options: Once you reach Maun there are basically two ways to see the 
delta: the mobile or the fly-in safaris. I took a mobile safari. We took our 
own camping gear and provisions. 
</P>
<P>
Island Safari Lodge (P.O. Box 116, Maun, Botswana 300) charges 40 pula a day 
for a three-person canoe and 95 pula for a return motorboat trip into the 
delta. We stayed in the Island Safari campground for five pula, but Island 
Safaris also offers lodging (47.50 pula per person double, 80 pula per person 
single), a restaurant (dinner is 18 pula), a bar, a swimming pool and a little 
movie theater. 
</P>
<P>
Other operators in Maun are Crocodile Camp (Box 46) and the Okavango River 
Lodge (Box 32, Maun). It's also possible to hire your own poler and mokoro out 
of Maun. 
</P>
<P>
The fly-in safaris offer a more comfortable way to see the delta. These 
companies fly you from Maun to an exclusive, semi-permanent camp, treat you 
like royalty and take you out on daylong canoe trips. Amenities include 
thatched or tented lodging with comfortable beds, mosquito netting, lighting, 
bathrooms and showers (with hot water), plus a restaurant, bar and movie 
theater. Meals and laundry service are often included. 
</P>
<P>
Gametrackers International (1000 E. Broadway, Glendale 91205, toll-free (800) 
252-0493) offers an eight-day package through northern Botswana, including a 
stop at Victoria Falls, for $2,725 (low season, March 1 through June 30) or 
$2,925 (high season, July 1 through Dec. 31). 
</P>
<P>
Desert and Delta Safaris Ltd. (16179 E. Whittier Blvd., Whittier, Calif. 90603, 
(213) 947-5100) offers an eight-night itinerary for $2,274.65 per person, with 
a minimum of four people. A six-night itinerary costs $1,537.05 per person 
(minimum of four). 
</P>
<P>
Ker Downey Selby (13201 Northwest Freeway, Suite 800, Houston, Tex. 77040, 
(800) 231-6352) offers a nine-day trip for $1,952. The company also does fancy 
mobile safaris for $660 a day for two people, or $460 a day per person. 
</P>
<P>
Okavango Tours &amp; Safaris (P.O. Box 39, Maun) operates Delta Camp, an 
exclusive camp with everything provided, and Oddball's, something in between a 
fly-in and a mobile safari. Oddball's flies you into a semi-permanent camp on 
the delta (110 pula for return), but you must take your own food and camping 
gear (7.50 pula a night for camping). For 30 pulas a day you can also hire a 
mokoro through Oddball's. 
</P>
<P>
When to Go: I took my trip in May, a good time to see the delta but perhaps not 
the best time to see animals. The delta was in full flood, and it was 
beautiful. The end of the dry season, September and October, is peak 
animal-viewing season, but also peak tourist season. It's a good idea to make 
reservations well ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Health: Malaria is the main concern. Consult a physician and begin taking 
anti-malaria medication one week before entering the area. Take mosquito 
repellent and netting. Make sure to keep all of your tent flaps closed until 
you go to sleep for the night. 
</P>
<P>
Tsetse flies are in the delta, but they usually aren't a problem, mainly 
because of spraying to reduce their population. There are insect repellents 
that are effective against the flies. 
</P>
<P>
If you drink water straight from the delta, you should boil or filter it. 
</P>
<P>
What to Take: If you're camping, you need to take all of your gear. Most fly-in 
operators will supply everything. You should also take sun block, sunglasses, a 
hat and neutral-colored clothing (to avoid frightening the animals), plus 
binoculars, a good camera with a telephoto lens, and film. 
</P>
<P>
Miscellaneous: Last July 1 Botswana raised fees for non-residents at its 
national parks from 5 pula to 30 pula a day, and as much as 50 pula a day for 
organized tours. 
</P>
<P>
If you're visiting the Okavango Delta it would be a shame not to also visit 
Chobe National Park. In addition, Victoria Falls is across the border in 
Zimbabwe, and in Zambia, and should not be missed. 
</P>
<P>
A good source of invaluable information for traveling on the cheap around 
Africa is "Africa on a Shoestring" by Geoff Crowther (Lonely Planet, $24.95). 
</P>
<P>
For more information on travel to Botswana, contact the Botswana Embassy, 4301 
Connecticut Ave. N.W., Suite 404, Washington, D.C. 20008, (202) 244-4990.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: CLUB STRIKES MANY GOLDEN MATCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HUGHES, Hughes is a 30-year veteran travel writer living in Sherman 
Oaks. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Golden Companions, an international travel companion matching service based in 
the state of Washington, has reached the mature age of three. This is a notable 
achievement, since most other such ventures seldom get past one. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 1,000 travelers have joined the club, whose aim is to match those age 50 
and up (the oldest member is 86) from across the United States. California, as 
can be expected, is well represented. 
</P>
<P>
According to Joanne Buteau, the club's founder and president, Golden Companions 
also has members in Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Europe and the Middle East. 
Members are a cross-section of society, and are single, divorced or married. 
</P>
<P>
Membership costs $60 a year. This entitles you to a copy of the club's roster, 
including the personal profiles and travel preferences of each member; a 
confidential mail-exchange service and a bimonthly newsletter on items of 
interest to the mature traveler. 
</P>
<P>
Members also get some discounts from national tour companies, a vacation-home 
exchange listing and opportunities for local social get-togethers. 
</P>
<P>
Buteau said the club also plans to sponsor group tours and cruises; the first 
of which will be to Alaska later this year. 
</P>
<P>
It's a natural direction for us to take," she said. "All of our members want to 
travel, and what an ideal way to meet each other. We hope to plan several 
Golden Companion trips each year." 
</P>
<P>
More information can be obtained by writing to the club for a free brochure 
and/or a sample newsletter for $2. The address is: Golden Companions, P.O. Box 
754, Pullman, WA 99163-0754; telephone (509) 334-9351. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, Partners-in-Travel, operated by Miriam Tobolowski, has been providing 
a similar matching service for more than five years. More than 75% of her 
members are aged 50 and older. 
</P>
<P>
Partners in Travel does not offer tours but does provide some very good tips 
for the solo and novice traveler. Subscription costs $30 for six months, $42 
for a year. For more information, write to Partners-in-Travel, P.O. Box 491145, 
Los Angeles, Calif. 90049; telephone (213) 476-4869. 
</P>
<P>
World War II veterans of the Pacific Theater who are interested in re-visiting 
those famous sites, might want to contact Valor Tours, Ltd. of Sausalito. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the company's trips this year are: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Islands of Valor," a May 18-to-June 5 cruise-tour that covers such islands 
as Guadalcanal, Tulagi, Rendova, Rabaul, and Biak. The cost is $5,390, not 
including air fare. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Guadalcanal to Tokyo Bay," a July 30-to-Aug. 11 tour with stops at Fiji as 
well as Tulagi and other battle sites. The cost is $2,900, including air fare 
from the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Valor Tours also has plans for a Navy SeaBees reunion cruise/tour to Alaska in 
August; a "Leyte Landing Day Tour" to the Philippines, including Corregidor, in 
September, and a Tarawa-Guam-Saipan-Tinian tour in November. 
</P>
<P>
For Air Force veterans or aviation buffs, there's Valor Tours' trip to the 
Farnborough Air Show in England and the 50th Anniversary of the Battle of 
Britain. The Sept. 4-17 tour costs $2,600, plus air fare, and also includes 
visits to World War II U.S. air bases in East Anglia. 
</P>
<P>
For more detailed information on these and other veterans tours being planned, 
contact Bob Reynolds, Valor Tours, P.O. Box 1617, Schoonmaker Bldg., Sausalito, 
Calif. 94965; telephone (415) 332-7850.

BARGAIN CORNER: SEEING SPAIN AND PORTUGAL AT REASONABLE PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK ADLER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you'll be traveling to and within Spain and Portugal you'll have several air 
and rail options to explore. 
</P>
<P>
Renfe, the Spanish rail company, has introduced a flexible non-consecutive-day 
pass that allows you to select which days you want to travel. The new 15-day 
Spain Flexipass provides unlimited rail travel during any four days out of a 
15-day period. The pass costs $99 for first-class travel, $75 for second-class. 
</P>
<P>
Consecutive-day passes are also available. You can get an eight-day pass, with 
the clock ticking from the first use, for $145 first-class and $105 
second-class. A 15-day pass, also on a consecutive-day basis, goes for $235

<P>
AN ASSESSMENT OF SKILLS THAT WENT INTO CREATING 10 MEMORABLE ROLES

It's only fitting that Morgan Freeman and Jessica Tandy are both up for Academy 
Awards for their roles in "Driving Miss Daisy" (adapted from his play by Alfred 
Uhry), since they play off each other in a quiet pas de duex whose overriding 
simplicity is built up through small, eloquent details. The setting is 1948 
Atlanta and covers 20 years. Tandy's Miss Daisy is a feisty, prideful 
72-year-old Jewish widow of some means. Freeman's Hoak is a widower 10 years 
younger, hired -- initially against her will -- to chauffeur her around. 
</P>
<P>
Tandy's brittle compendium of sharp, worrisome gazes, thin querulous voice, and 
a mouth set in a perpetual series of reproachful judgments, tells us a great 
deal about a woman who expects things to be Just So and is acutely sensitive to 
the hierarchy of appearances in a Southern community. She's by no means a 
racist (and in fact is a visible supporter of Martin Luther King Jr.). She's a 
stubborn, intellectually principled woman whom the world has failed so 
regularly that she's beyond didacticism. But never her standard. When Miss 
Daisy suffers her first touch of Alzheimer's, Tandy takes on the appearance of 
spectral alarm. The ghostly aureole of her disheveled hair and the panic in her 
face shows us the terror of an exacting woman who's lost her sense of place. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman's Hoak is stripped of all contemporary urban references in reaching 
back to a specific time and place where to be black was to live in a spirit of 
caution that seeped out of the marrow. Up to now, Freeman's performances have 
been fires well-tended; here he gives us the feel of Southern weight, which is 
always oppressive -- even in the weather. He walks as though his flat feet 
ache. He affects an old black man's stiff hips and jocular self-effacement. He 
laughs with sealed lips. 
</P>
<P>
Still, this Hoak is not someone to be pushed around. He's expressive within a 
circumspect frame. When Freeman says "Oh I jus' love the smell of a new car, 
don't you, Miss Daisy?" he looks like someone who's awakened to a brilliant 
morning. Outside her synagogue, after she's scolded him for bringing the car up 
front with its suggestion of ostentation, he peers at her and says, "You needs 
a chauffeur. I needs a job. Let's leave it at that." Wordlessly, something in 
her relents to his sharpness. By the time they're ready for the drive to the 
King fund-raiser in Mobile, they're fussing at each other like comfortable old 
marrieds (later, his glance at an Alabama state trooper says everything about 
primal black fear in the South). By story's end, he's the only one she'll admit 
within the iron gates of her censure. He's become living proof of the efficacy 
of kindness. 
</P>
<P>
There's an infinitely more violent restraint at work in Daniel Day-Lewis's 
portrayal on Christy Brown in "My Left Foot." Brown is the Irish author and 
painter afflicted with cerebral palsy -- his left foot is the only thing he can 
control -- and Day-Lewis vividly shows us what it means to have a lively and 
precocious spirit held at the mercy of a body mostly paralyzed and perpetually 
wracked by neurological firestorms. 
</P>
<P>
Day-Lewis's performance is no Movie-of-the-Week sympathy card; the pain of 
living underwater, as it were, where virtually no impulse has a direct 
expression, is sometimes unbearable to watch. His Christy hasn't the time and 
energy for the luxury of dissimulation -- in a restaurant scene in which a 
woman he fancies announces her engagement to someone else, he throws a 
frightful, drooling, red-faced tantrum of such fierce torment that you fear 
he'll perish on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
In nearly any setting, Day-Lewis' jaws grind in pained derision and his eyes 
flash with anger and recrimination before they roll into fear and pain. He is a 
true prisoner of the flesh. The beauty of this performance is in how many 
quickly closing crevices Day-Lewis finds to express a fierce intelligence, a 
pleasure at finding pleasure, a thirst for life (both literal and sexual), a 
sidelong humor, and the hard-won truths about living which most of the rest of 
us tend to forget. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago Robin Williams would have played the boys' private school 
literature instructor John Keating in "Dead Poets Society" as a poetry-spewing 
zany whose fatal collision-course with the administration leaves him a 
sentimental object of pity. Here, not only are Williams' highs more restrained, 
he successfully risks the quality that's almost always fatal to a performance 
by playing foreknowledge. His clowning around here for once refers more to his 
character than to his standup routine -- it's a way of getting the boys to 
loosen up. At heart Keating wants to show them that one's compact with poetry 
is a link with freedom and self-discovery, and what truths others have had to 
say about experience. 
</P>
<P>
A sad, circumspect element in Williams' performance suggests that Keating knows 
well how transitory the impressionable openess and headiness of youth really 
is. He's their champion because he understands them and can awaken in them the 
notion that in literature everyone is contemporary with everyone else. He also 
knows the odds. There's nothing he can say to the boy who passionately wants to 
act but whose father forbids it; watching them drive away, his face grows drawn 
and bitter. In the final scene, as the students stand on their desks in 
recalcitrant tribute, he pauses on the way out to say "Thank you, boys," and 
leave them with a smile full of prideful understanding and sympathetic pain. 
</P>
<P>
Thick-waisted, jowly, snaggle-toothed and possessed of a small, ceramic British 
voice, Pauline Collins in "Shirley Valentine" is this year's entry in the 
Women's Picture sub-category. Last year it was Melanie Griffith's "Working 
Girl" whose triumph was to make it into a small boxy office in a big 
corporation while a billowing musical score sang improbably of arriving in the 
new Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Alan and Marilyn Bergman's insipid opener, "The Girl Who Used to Be 
Me," suggest that we may be in for a case of the cutes. But Collins is a 
genuinely likable woman with a sly wit. She plays a 42-year-old London 
housewife whose lips are forever pursed in disdain towards those dreary 
domestic encumbrances that leave her feeling dull and neglected, chief among 
them a loutish husband who treats her like a salesclerk. Fortunately, Greece 
beckons in the form of a friend with an extra tour ticket. There Shirley finds, 
if not love, then a bout of good sex with the roguish Tom Conti, and an 
unslakable thirst for freedom. 
</P>
<P>
There are some crucial oversimplifications in "Shirley Valentine," but they're 
hidden in Collins' adroit expression of quiet metamorphosis. Where once she was 
dumpy, now she's lush; her sharp-eyed, brittle expression of unhappy 
self-reproach has resolved into a more purposeful reflectiveness. Where once 
she was a character you joked with in the kitchen, now she's someone you want 
to hear from in a long talk. Shirley has keen memories of her rebellious 
schoolgirl self, as well as considerable dismay over how that early fire gutted 
out. If she's discovered a new resolve, we also see in Collins' solemn figure, 
seated beachside at dusk, that she will never be without regret. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Branagh's "Henry V" is a lithe, smallish, incandescant figure with a 
carnivore's swollen jaw and eyes that don't miss a trick. In the early scenes 
with his council, he generates the quiet assurance of resolution (and as an 
actor, leaves himself with someplace to go). Clearly this Henry sees himself as 
a creature of destiny not to be trifled with, but his face isn't abstracted in 
the spooky otherworldliness of the zealot. It takes things in. Presence of mind 
is a king's imperative (and it show our jaded post-Vietnam eyes why men will go 
to war behind sufficiently clever and inspired leaders). Kranagh's lyrical 
voice reminds us too that hearing Shakespeare well-spoken is a joy bordering on 
the sensual -- this is language people once enjoyed as an ambient sixth sense, 
before it was razed by the modern mass media. 
</P>
<P>
When Henry comes to claim his French queen, Branagh underscores the coltish 
uncertainty of a young man who hasn't spent much time around women. He's a 
little in awe of her -- but never out of reach of his wits. When he says "You 
have witchcraft in your lips, Kate; there is more eloquence in a sugar touch of 
them than in the tongues of the French council . . . " Branagh's open-faced, 
exuberant charm demonstrates why Henry would be king even if he weren't 
entitled. He's king because he's irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
In "Born on the Fourth of July," Tom Cruise plays Ron Kovic, the paraplegic 
Vietnam veteran who as a Long Island high school kid was an earnest subscriber 
to the myths of the All-American Way before they soured with brutal experience 
and he took up the cause of anti-war and veterans' rights activism. Cruise is 
particularly effective in his early scenes where he captures a teen-ager's 
dorky self-consciousness, and the veterans' hospital scenes are gruelling for 
what we see him suffer. But as the story develops, his performance begins to 
lose its continuity and tension. In interviews Cruise likes to talk about how 
hard he works, but working should never be as obvious as it is here, where few 
of his gestures and takes seem linked to something going on deep inside him. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver Stone offers a number of telling observations on how fiercely we hold on 
to our self-deception, and how -- aside from the PR euphemism -- the heated, 
rancorous expletive has taken the place of political dialogue in America. But 
his whiplash editing and Kovic's apparent inarticulateness aren't much help for 
an actor of Cruise's limitations. He has a boy's voice that rises to an 
androgynous whine when pressed, and his idea of passion is to high-beam his 
sincerity. For all the bitter, shattering experience Kovic has endured, Cruise 
gives us a soft-shelled man with a creamy center. If you recall Marlon Brando 
in "The Men," you'll see what a light talent is at work here. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Music Box," Jessica Lange plays a successful trial lawyer named Ann 
Talbot who works for a tony Chicago firm and takes on the defense of her father 
in a deportation suit after he's been accused of Nazi World War II crimes. 
Given her literal circumstance, Lange would not have the histrionic 
accoutrements available to someone who worked, say, as a samba instructor, and 
she's harrowingly expert at conveying the implosive pressures at large in 
someone who's wracked to her emotional core but can't enjoy the luxury of 
letting go. 
</P>
<P>
Early on her worn, slightly disheveled look says much about what it's like to 
work day-to-day in the law, with its endless stops and starts, continuances and 
delays. As the trial delivers its mounting challenges against her father, who, 
it's clear, is fighting for his life, the horrific suffering of the testifying 
war victims also takes effect. Lange moves us through every turn of Talbot's 
struggle to maintain clarity and control. We see the stabbing anxiety at work 
in her -- a catch in the voice, a tendon that involuntary leaps out of her neck 
during a cross-examination, a breakdown in her car where she weeps from every 
facial orifice. 
</P>
<P>
The performance is both detailed and gradually built up. When she suffers a 
crucial betrayal at the end, her voice sounds like that of a small animal whose 
back has been broken. If the definition of a first-rate intelligence is the 
ability to hold opposing ideas in mind and still function, the test of a 
first-rate performance is the ability to play the opposing emotions of love and 
hate and show how human tragedy is the expression of their closeness. 
</P>
<P>
It's going to be a close call for the men this year, but Isabelle Adjani and 
Michelle Pfeiffer have to figure in the long odds for Best Actress. Adjani, who 
has an ethereal dewiness that often shows up in young French beauties (maybe 
it's the vegetables) offers some piquant moments in "Camille Claudel," in which 
she plays a promising sculptress undone by an affair with a feckless August 
Rodin -- and she certainly gets this year's Susan Hayward Award for the 
fall-down, bust-out Big Scene. But "Camille Claudel" is a dull French 
picture-book movie that smothers everyone's energy with commemorative 
dutifulness. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Fabulous Baker Boys," Pfeiffer plays a laconic tough-talking lounge 
singer to the dual cocktail piano team of Jeff and Beau Bridges. In concert 
she's a throwback to those slinky Hollywood chanteuses of the '40s, but how she 
came by her contemporary smarts is impossible to fathom, as is the background 
for her crusty passivity. It's not Pfeiffer's fault that all she's been given 
to play is a couple of attitudes. That she can parlay them into an Oscar 
nomination is a tribute to her skill. 
</P>
<P>
Who should win? For degree of difficulty, Jessica Lange and Kenneth Branagh. 
</P>
<P>
Who will win? Jessica Tandy, because this is probably Hollywood's last chance 
to honor a long career in which everything she did turned into music. Tom 
Cruise, because right now America's Number One pinup boy can do no wrong. There 
is, however, a lot of late action moving on Morgan Freeman, and on Daniel 
Day-Lewis as well, for having done the impossible.

AND WHAT IF 'NASTY' SHOWS UP AT YOUR HOUSE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Chuck Philips 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What should parents do if they catch their young teen-agers with a copy of 2 
Live Crew's sexually explicit "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" album? Should they be 
alarmed and ban the record from the house, or think of it as harmless 
experimentation and ignore the situation? 
</P>
<P>
The Times posed these questions to Mark DeAntonio, unit director of the 
Adolescent Inpatient Unit at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute. DeAntonio, an 
assistant clinical professor who's familiar with 2 Live Crew's music, counsels 
families daily on such matters. 
</P>
<P>
"If your 12-year-old daughter brings home a 2 Live Crew record and shows it to 
you in a provocative way, as they often will, the answer is not to freak out, 
but to sit down, listen to it together, talk to your kid and find out what they 
think about it," he said. "Make sure your values about violence and sex are 
made absolutely crystal clear at home, because in families with good 
communication, these things don't become problems. 
</P>
<P>
"In families where there are problems, I think there is a tendency to blame 
external things such as records or movies or whatever. To put it into 
historical perspective, people in the 1940s said Frank Sinatra provoked sexual 
behavior. In the 1950s, Elvis Presley, who did things that we would now 
consider remarkably tame, was banned throughout the United States for being too 
sexual. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are more sophisticated now, more open, more explicit and the key thing 
is not to try to protect your child or shield them, but make sure that you are 
communicating your values. So I would see a 12-year-old bringing home this 
album not as something to be terrified of, but as an opportunity to discuss 
sexual matters directly with your child. 
</P>
<P>
"When we're talking about average adolescents, I think the trap is that the 
things you ban tend to become more alluring and tempting to kids. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course what you do depends on the values you feel are important to stress 
in your own family. If parents really find it objectionable, I think they 
should set limits around it. Be direct about what will be tolerated in the 
home. But make sure they're limits you can follow through with. I don't think 
you should allow your kid to do something that is really disturbing to you, but 
I wouldn't be rigid about any response. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that listening to 2 Live Crew is going to make anybody sexually 
promiscuous. Kids are more influenced by the values of their parents and older 
siblings and peers. "Whether parents like it or not, kids are exposed to 
sexually explicit ideas earlier these days and they need to discuss these 
issues with their child." Chuck Philips

HUNGARY TO HOLD FIRST FREE ELECTION IN 40 YEARS TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

BALASSAGYARMAT, Hungary 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Marta Osztroluczki and the Independent Smallholders Party she hopes to 
represent in Parliament, the surest road to recovery from the ravages of 
socialism is to turn back the clock on more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Not much of the past 40 years is worth saving," insists Osztroluczki, a 
26-year-old geography teacher, wife and mother of two from this northern 
farming town on the border with Czechoslovakia. "Everything we learned was 
designed to keep the Communist Party in power. That is no longer what anyone 
wants." 
</P>
<P>
Hungarians must be brave enough to admit the failure of their recent history, 
the ardent advocate of agrarian reform contended at a district rally winding up 
her campaign for today's national election, Hungary's first free ballot in more 
than four decades. To move forward, she argued, the nation must first move 
back. 
</P>
<P>
The Smallholders propose to redistribute land and assets according to 1947 
ownership records, a move viewed by liberals and city dwellers as naive, 
illogical and as potentially disruptive as the forced collectivizations it aims 
to reverse. 
</P>
<P>
But in rural farming regions like Balassagyarmat, a longing to return to 
Hungary's simple agrarian heritage has combined with a nationwide fever of 
anti-socialism to make the Smallholders plan an appealing alternative to the 
economic doomsaying of the two other leading political parties. 
</P>
<P>
The center-right Hungarian Democratic Forum and the liberal Alliance of Free 
Democrats have warned voters of hard times ahead as the nation wrestles with a 
$20-billion foreign debt and a painful conversion to capitalism that may cause 
inflation and unemployment to soar. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the population doesn't want to go back to farming, but we must do it 
for the good of the nation," contends Gyorgy Balogh, vice president of the 
Smallholders in Budapest. "It is impossible to solve the problem in any other 
way. We must begin at the last turning point, in 1947." 
</P>
<P>
About half of Hungary's territory was parceled out to farmers under the 1947 
agrarian reform, which the Smallholders contend is the only equitable basis for 
redistributing assets. 
</P>
<P>
They propose returning the land to its former owners or their legitimate heirs 
within two years and following up with a second stage of the private property 
reform that would restore ownership of shops, homes and other assets to the 
titleholders of 1947. 
</P>
<P>
The two leading parties, each of which has been drawing about 20% of voter 
support in public opinion polls, dismiss the Shareholders' redistribution plan 
as unworkable. 
</P>
<P>
Miklos Haraszti, a Budapest candidate for the Alliance of Free Democrats, 
protests that 40% of those eligible to lay claim to their families' former 
farmland now live in cities and work at industrial jobs. To hand over those 
property rights would send food prices skyrocketing, Haraszti argues, as 
collective farmers would have to rent land at market prices from the new owners 
or face eviction and unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the prospect for a swift transition to private ownership or cashing in on 
sale of the acreage are making the Smallholders' policy attractive to enough 
Hungarians to be worrisome for the more mainstream parties. 
</P>
<P>
The Smallholders trail the Forum and the Alliance by only a few percentage 
points in polls that some fear have failed to canvass voters in the provinces, 
where Smallholders support is based. 
</P>
<P>
Pollsters attempting to chart the mood of the electorate have been thwarted by 
the inadequate communications network in Hungary, where only one in 10 
households has a telephone and the media have yet to shed the prejudice of more 
than 40 years of one-party control. 
</P>
<P>
The Smallholders' potential to emerge as the dark horse has kept the door open 
for partnership in the likely event that no party wins a majority in the 
complicated balloting. 
</P>
<P>
Hungarians will have the opportunity to vote for both a specific candidate to 
represent their home district and for the party that most appeals to them. 
</P>
<P>
The winner in each of the 176 individual constituencies will be the first 
candidate to get an absolute majority, with runoffs tentatively set for April 8 
for those districts where no candidate clears 50% in the first vote. Another 
152 seats will be determined by each party's standing in the popularity vote, 
and the remaining 58 seats in the 386-member Parliament will be distributed 
proportionally among the parties winning at least 4% of the aggregate vote. 
</P>
<P>
All 28 parties running national campaigns wound up their stumping Friday to 
give voters pause for contemplation before the polls open today at 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Geza Jeszenszky, a foreign policy expert with the Hungarian Democratic Forum, 
predicted at least a 70% turnout, despite what Westerners see as a relatively 
apathetic attitude among the nation's 7.5 million eligible voters. 
</P>
<P>
The three leading parties are united in their prediction that whichever force 
comes out ahead will have to form a coalition with at least one of the other 
two to push its reform policies through Parliament.

HAZELWOOD TELLS OF IMAGES THAT STILL HAUNT HIM 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former tanker captain Joseph Hazelwood is haunted by images. 
</P>
<P>
Images of devastation: fouled beaches, dead birds, dying otters. "Hazelwood's 
otters," some called them. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a terrible tragedy . . . It will affect me, like it will affect 
everyone else, for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Images of faceless, nameless accusers, of being constantly pursued, like the 
tragic figure from "Les Miserables." 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like I was Jean Valjean with about a hundred inspectors chasing me 
around the sewers of Paris." 
</P>
<P>
Images on television screens: a balding, bearded man with frightened eyes. His 
own image. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like an out-of-body experience. I say: 'Gee, that guy's got a lot of 
trouble. I feel sorry for him.' " 
</P>
<P>
For the reclusive Hazelwood, who until a year ago regarded himself as an 
anonymous "Joe Schmoe, the boat driver," those statements broke a year of 
silence about his reaction to the nation's worst oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Hazelwood's words came shortly before an Alaska judge sentenced him 
on his misdemeanor pollution conviction and scolded him for failing to 
apologize about the spill. 
</P>
<P>
What Judge Karl Johnstone could not know was that in a hotel room across the 
street from the courthouse Hazelwood was, for the first time, revealing some of 
his feelings about damage caused by the accident. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, it bothered me. It was terrible," Hazelwood told reporters. ". . . It's 
like any devastation. It's terrible whether it's Chernobyl or medical waste 
washing up on my back yard in Long Island." 
</P>
<P>
However, his attorneys prevented him from answering any questions reflecting on 
the degree of personal responsibility he feels for the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood and his attorneys agreed to a 90-minute interview Friday with four 
reporters representing the Los Angeles Times, the Associated Press, the 
Anchorage Times and Newsday. The conditions were that the interview would not 
be published before Sunday and that the former captain would not be questioned 
about specific events or actions related to the grounding. 
</P>
<P>
The attorneys said such discussions could interfere with an appeal of his 
misdemeanor conviction and with 150 pending civil damage claims naming 
Hazelwood and his former employer, Exxon Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood was acquitted of three serious criminal charges that carried maximum 
penalties of seven years in jail -- a criminal mischief felony, operating a 
vessel while intoxicated and reckless endangerment. 
</P>
<P>
He was convicted only of negligent discharge of oil, a misdemeanor, and many of 
the jurors attended his sentencing hearing to support the former captain. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnstone not only criticized his failure to apologize but seemed to ignore 
the jury's innocent verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
"No reasonably prudent person operating a tanker like the Exxon Valdez would 
have had those drinks before getting on board or would've left the bridge when 
Capt. Hazelwood did," the judge said. "In my opinion . . . that constitutes, at 
the least, negligence." 
</P>
<P>
A few hours earlier Hazelwood had reflected on his experiences in the legal 
system -- and on his rude departure from a life of solitude and anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The front page of Friday morning's edition of Newsday -- the Hazelwood family's 
hometown paper in Huntington, N.Y. -- carried the bold headline: "Victory for 
Hazelwood." 
</P>
<P>
Heading for his meeting with reporters, he passed the page to his wife, 
Suzanne, without smiling. 
</P>
<P>
"Last time I was on the front page of Newsday the headline was 'Drunk at Sea,' 
" Hazelwood said. 
</P>
<P>
That's what his neighbors read. And his parents. And the friends of his 
teen-age daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"We were leading a reasonably normal life, just loping along, and our whole 
world just did a 180-degree turn," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Media types camped on his doorstep, rifled his mail, carted away his garbage 
and put camera lenses up to his windows. He was forced to move out of his own 
home for several days. 
</P>
<P>
He was just beginning to realize how much his life had changed on the rocks of 
Bligh Reef. 
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood entered the judicial system in a Suffolk County court where he 
surrendered a year ago to face the Alaska criminal charges for which he was 
substantially exonerated last week. 
</P>
<P>
The media interest was great -- apparently the heat of too many television 
camera lights was what kept setting off the court's fire alarms. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, however, Hazelwood was arraigned and bail was set at a whopping $1 
million. The judge called the oil spill an "environmental Hiroshima." 
</P>
<P>
"I went in there reasonably starry-eyed that justice would be served . . . that 
the facts would bear fruit and things would be fine," Hazelwood recalled. 
</P>
<P>
But after the $1-million bail in New York (reduced on appeal a day later to 
$25,000), and a seven-week trial in Alaska, Hazelwood calls the justice system 
"a meat grinder." 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a sausage machine where you go in in one form and you come out the 
other end as something else," he said. What Hazelwood says he's come out as is 
a cynic. 
</P>
<P>
For a shy man accustomed to the solitary life of a seaman, Hazelwood clearly 
has been embarrassed by his notoriety. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm Joe Schmoe, you know, just a boat driver, basically . . . thrust into the 
limelight, catapulted into the starring role," Hazelwood said. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't equipped for it. Most people aren't. Maybe a Zsa Zsa wants this, the 
flash of the bulbs and the videotapes rolling in her eyes. I never did." 
</P>
<P>
Most trouble, apparently, was the very public dissection of Hazelwood's 
previously private battles with alcohol dependency. Twice he had been arrested 
for drunk driving. In 1985 he spent 28 days in a treatment program for 
alcoholics. 
</P>
<P>
In his trial, Hazelwood -- through his attorneys -- had acknowledged drinking 
prior to sailing, but the amount he consumed was disputed. Not one of 21 
witnesses -- most of them called by the prosecution -- testified to any signs 
that the captain had been impaired by drinking that night. 
</P>
<P>
The jury not only acquitted him, but individual jurors strongly criticized the 
state for bringing the charges in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"Alcohol was the biggest red herring in this whole deal," Hazelwood told his 
interviewers. "It made splashy headlines, but it had nothing to do with this" 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
It had a lot to do with Hazelwood's hard feelings about the way he was treated 
by the public -- particularly by the press and public agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"I resented . . . the dragging in of my private life into a public arena. 
Anyone would resent that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There were moments of doubt. Nagging, chilling, frustrating moments wondering 
how a jury without sailing experience would understand the world of merchant 
seamen. 
</P>
<P>
"With a jury, you just never know," Hazelwood said. 
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood had gone to sea as a boy of 14, working as a commercial fisherman off 
the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"It always appealed to me. I wanted to see what was over the horizon," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He recalled one voyage as chief mate on a freighter when the captain called him 
to the bridge as the ship eased out of New York harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"He said: 'Can you find South Africa?' and I said: 'Yessir.' He says: 'Call me 
when you raise Table Mountain' " in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood, who was accused of being criminally reckless for leaving the bridge 
of his tanker in Prince William Sound, said his freighter master never returned 
to the bridge unless he was summoned by his officers. 
</P>
<P>
He said for a captain to be off the bridge is common on modern ships. It was 
because Hazelwood was off the bridge, however, that the jury convicted him of 
the lone charge of negligence. 
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood approached the jury's moment of decision with fatalism. 
</P>
<P>
"I was apprehensive, but I realized that . . . I wasn't going to be taken out 
and shot. They wouldn't treat me like (executed Romanian dictator Nicolae) 
Ceaucescu," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But, with his wife and father in the back row, Hazelwood waited in the 
deafening silence of a hushed courtroom for the jury to file in. 
</P>
<P>
"My heart . . . it was close to palpitating," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
He heard nothing after the judge read the first "Not" in the litany of not 
guilty verdicts. He didn't hear the burst of applause. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in like a vacuum," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Now Hazelwood wants another kind of silence. The silence of the sea. 
</P>
<P>
But first he faces Coast Guard license hearings in Long Beach, possibly next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time since the Exxon Valdez rumbled up onto Bligh Reef, however, 
Hazelwood is at least glancing into his future 
</P>
<P>
"A year from now . . . (I want to be) at sea someplace -- going somewhere or 
coming from someplace."

LITHUANIA SAYS IT'S NOT FORMING ARMY; 
</P>
<P>

PRESIDENT ALSO WARNS MILITARY DESERTERS THAT HE CANNOT PROTECT THEM.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lithuania's leader assured President Mikhail S. Gorbachev after an 
extraordinary spate of Kremlin saber-rattling Saturday that his breakaway 
republic is not forming paramilitary units and warned Lithuanian deserters from 
the Soviet army that he cannot protect them. 
</P>
<P>
As night fell on this Baltic capital, there were no signs of the early morning 
armored convoys that had shocked and angered Lithuanians in the tensest 24 
hours since their declaration of independence two weeks ago. But there was also 
no indication that Moscow's ire over the secession drive is waning. 
</P>
<P>
Two deadlines set by the Soviets also expired Saturday, but it was not 
immediately clear whether the Lithuanians' reaction would placate Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
President Vytautas Landsbergis, speaking to foreign reporters outside the 
Parliament building, said his government's campaign to restore the independence 
that Lithuania enjoyed between the world wars would continue. 
</P>
<P>
"We consider us as a part of Eastern Europe, not a part of the Soviet Union," 
Landsbergis said, speaking in English. "These processes cannot be stopped." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, who says the secession is illegal, demanded Thursday that 
Landsbergis halt the sign-up of volunteers to replace Soviet police officers 
and KGB border guards and gave him until Saturday to inform him of the steps 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
Military authorities, similarly brushing off Lithuania's professed 
independence, gave deserters until Saturday to return to the barracks, or risk 
arrest. Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, Gorbachev's military adviser, said the 
conscripts would be returned to duty whether they liked it or not. 
</P>
<P>
In a telegram to the Soviet president, made available to reporters by the 
Glasnost group of independent Soviet journalists, Landsbergis said Gorbachev 
was misinformed if he believed that Lithuania, independent from 1918 until the 
Kremlin absorbed it in 1940, was again forming an army. 
</P>
<P>
"People are registering who agree, if necessary, to help in the maintenance of 
social order and controls on the roads," Landsbergis said in his telegram, 
which denied that armed groups were being formed. 
</P>
<P>
He concluded that "for the tanks that are now approaching the capital of the 
Lithuanian republic, there is nothing to do." 
</P>
<P>
About 100 Soviet military vehicles rumbled through the center of this hilly 
capital at 4 a.m., their roar bringing legislators meeting in an all-night 
session of Parliament outside to watch the column speed along the highway. 
</P>
<P>
A duty officer at Sajudis, the grass-roots nationalist group that spearheaded 
the independence drive, said the 58 infantry fighting vehicles and 50 trucks 
entered a military base at Siaures Miestelis in northern Vilnius. 
</P>
<P>
For Landsbergis, the display of Soviet military might highlighted the danger 
that hangs over his government. "This is a constant threat, and no one knows if 
they are going to use force," he told Parliament members after they reconvened, 
bleary-eyed, at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The previous day, Soviet military helicopters dropping leaflets branding the 
secession illegal roared over the Supreme Council building, and the Interior 
Ministry announced it had deployed units loyal to Moscow throughout the West 
Virginia-size republic. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials have repeatedly said they will not use force in Lithuania, and 
a senior Soviet diplomat Saturday said his government will do everything in its 
power to resolve the crisis peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
"For the time being, we are not using any force in the republic, and we will 
try to keep that line, but what will happen I don't know," Deputy Foreign 
Minister Yuri B. Kashlev told reporters in Lisbon. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, about 200 people rallied in front of the Lincoln Memorial to 
express their solidarity with the new Lithuanian regime. They carried placards 
reading "Thanks . . . But No Tanks" and "Give Lithuania Freedom." 
</P>
<P>
For many in this republic of 3.7 million people, the fate of deserters from the 
Soviet army is an issue heavy with symbolism. Not only should Lithuanian boys 
not have to serve in the army of what is now a foreign state, they argue, but 
conscripts from the Baltic states are often submitted to brutal hazing that has 
driven some to suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Landsbergis has said that at least 840 deserters have recently come back to the 
republic. He had said earlier that authorities of his government would try to 
guard them, but he admitted Saturday that task is impossible, given the might 
of the Soviet army. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot physically protect every young man who is trying to hide," he told 
Parliament. He advised deserters not to stay at home, since their addresses 
might be known to military police, and said that if deserters are threatened, 
"they could seek sanctuary in churches." 
</P>
<P>
What succor churches could offer, beyond spiritual aid, is unclear, since they 
are awarded no special status as places of sanctuary by the officially 
atheistic Soviet state. 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian leadership had been concerned that the army and KGB would use 
Saturday's deadline for deserters to return to their units as pretext for mass 
arrests and even violent provocations, the Washington Post reported. But there 
were few arrests, and nearly all of the deserters stayed at their homes, with 
friends or at a psychiatric hospital in the suburbs of Vilnius, the newspaper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of the showdown with Moscow, elections were held in Lithuania on 
Saturday for more than 9,000 posts on city and village councils. The Soviet 
news agency Tass said that from 50% to 60% of voters had cast ballots by late 
afternoon, showing that Lithuanians were taking their political 
responsibilities under independence seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the neighboring Baltic republic of Estonia, Communists argued 
over the future of their party, which local journalists say seems certain to 
split like Lithuania's party into a pro-Moscow faction and a group demanding 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
A decision by the Estonian Communist Party's extraordinary congress was 
expected today.

SEX ABSTINENCE VIDEO PREPARED FOR SCHOOLS GETS A THUMBS DOWN

<P>
If you know just the right education official to call in Vallejo, you might be 
able to get a copy of the state's new, $138,000 video urging California high 
school students to abstain from sex. 
</P>
<P>
That's because its own distributors, though approving of its message, are 
giving the film a thumbs-down review. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-minute video was produced under the auspices of the state Department of 
Education, but the department has removed its name from the final product and 
is planning only limited distribution. 
</P>
<P>
Also, several members of the State Board of Education have said the film is 
unflattering to minorities, is not graphic enough in showing the dire 
consequences of casual sex and is too simple-minded for today's teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
Because of these objections, "they (board members) felt more comfortable if we 
didn't have our name on it," said Francie Alexander, director of curriculum 
instruction and assessment for the Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
A master copy of the video will be sent to an obscure health resources center 
in Vallejo, and high schools around the state can order copies for $10 apiece, 
if they know it exists. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Louis P. Sheldon's Traditional Values Coalition, which pushed for 
legislation requiring the Department of Education to make the film, thinks the 
department is suppressing it. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me the Department of Education just doesn't want the abstinence 
message to get out," Beverly Sheldon, Rev. Sheldon's wife and director of 
research for the coalition, said angrily. "They're stifling the message." 
</P>
<P>
"That's absolutely untrue," Alexander replied. "The department is promoting 
abstinence as the only absolutely foolproof way of avoid ing" pregnancy or 
sexually transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
But she added, "We do teach other things, too," such as birth control methods, 
since "we are aware that not everyone is going to be abstinent." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Ryan, director of the department's Critical Health Initiatives unit, 
pointed out that the legislation ordering the department to make the film 
provided no money to distribute the finished product. 
</P>
<P>
"The next time a special-interest group wants to do something like this, it 
would be wise if they would provide money for follow-through, too," Ryan said. 
"I'm up against the wall with AIDS, drugs and everything else." 
</P>
<P>
The video in question features Kim Coles, an attractive young actress telling a 
group of high school students things like "it's OK to wait," "everybody's not 
doing it," and "wait until you're married to have sex," against a background of 
rock music. 
</P>
<P>
Like a football coach, Coles diagrams "plays" on a blackboard that young women 
can use to resist overly zealous suitors. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is a lot of talk about the "consequences" of sexual liaisons, 
the only consequences shown are a few scenes depicting the difficulties of a 
young couple trying to care for a baby. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Sheldon liked the film, which was made by Intermedia Inc., of Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some things we would do differently but, all in all, it's OK," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Loya, executive secretary of the California Assn. of Health Educators, 
also approves of the video. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't perfect but it's better than a lot of things out there," Loya said. 
"As part of an overall health education program, it certainly has its place." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Loya's health educators organization and the Traditional Values 
Coalition persuaded Assemblywoman Teresa P. Hughes (D-Los Angeles) to introduce 
a bill calling on the Department of Education to make the sexual abstinence 
video. 
</P>
<P>
Their motives were different. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought abstinence should be the primary thing taught" in junior and senior 
high school health education and family life classes, Sheldon said. "But there 
was all this stuff about birth control methods and abstinence was being 
ignored. It wasn't getting a fair shake." 
</P>
<P>
Loya agreed that "abstinence wasn't being addressed" and this made life more 
difficult for health education teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"We were getting pressure from the right -- from the Traditional Values 
Coalition and others," to do more to encourage students to abstain from sex, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
While Sheldon and Loya like the film, others were less generous in their 
comments. 
</P>
<P>
Paras Mehta, a 16-year-old senior at Cerritos High School in Los Angeles County 
and the student member of the State Board of Education, said, "I have some 
concern whether it's appropriate for high school, whether high school students 
would take the message seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Board member David T. Romero said: "The approach is not very strong. They sort 
of skip around AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases. If the message is going 
to be effective, it has to hit you right between the eyes." 
</P>
<P>
Romero also objected to a Latino couple shown in the film. 
</P>
<P>
"They got people who had just recently arrived from Mexico or Latin America," 
he said. "They weren't typical of California Hispanic high school students." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas M. Bogetich, executive director to the state board, said several board 
members "didn't think it was realistic or was something kids would relate to." 
</P>
<P>
Others argued that no organization -- the Traditional Values Coalition, the 
health educators or anybody else -- should be able to mandate specific parts of 
the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time the (political) pendulum swings, you'll end up putting things in or 
taking things out," said Daniel Chernow, chairman of the state Curriculum 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
For all these reasons, Department of Education officials decided to remove the 
department's name from the video, an action that was roundly criticized by 
Beverly Sheldon. 
</P>
<P>
"They should be held accountable," she said. "If the department didn't like the 
film, they shouldn't have accepted it." 
</P>
<P>
Since the department is making only a half-hearted effort to distribute the 
video, Sheldon said, the Traditional Values Coalition will send copies to the 
more than 800 high schools around the state if they can raise about $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
But Department of Education officials said that might not be legal, since the 
department owns the film's copyright. 
</P>
<P>
The result of all this, said a legislative aide who has followed the issue 
closely, is "a video has been made and now it's about to disappear into a black 
hole in Vallejo. For $138,000, we expected a little more."

LAWMAKERS' 'BELLBOYS' COST TAXPAYERS $2.3 MILLION YEARLY; 
</P>
<P>
SACRAMENTO: EIGHTY SERGEANTS-AT-ARMS AND CHAUFFEURS CATER TO 120 LAWMAKERS. 
RECORDS SHOW THEY HAVE PICKED UP THE LAUNDRY, TAKEN CHILDREN TO SCHOOL AND 
DELIVERED CAT FOOD.

<P>
Imagine having someone to take care of your laundry, stand in line for you at 
the bank, pick up your kids from school, chauffeur you around town and wait for 
the cable TV man. 
</P>
<P>
You are imagining the life of a California legislator. 
</P>
<P>
At an annual cost to state taxpayers of at least $2.3 million, 80 
sergeants-at-arms and chauffeurs cater to 120 lawmakers in a way that even 
members of Congress are unfamiliar. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Lynch, a former Assembly sergeant who quit to become a private 
investigator, called his former job "a glorified bellboy position." 
</P>
<P>
"You go under the pretense of being a peace officer and you get a badge, but it 
pretty much stops there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A review of last year's legislative logs revealed that: 
</P>
<P>
* Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles), who works out daily at the 
Capital Athletic Club, four blocks from the Capitol, is almost always driven 
there. He once was driven to a restaurant a block from the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
* Assemblyman Elihu M. Harris (D-Oakland) once sent a sergeant to his home to 
turn off a Crock-Pot and put it in the refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
* Rather than drive himself to his Santa Clara home on weekends, Democratic 
Assemblyman John Vasconcellos has a sergeant drive him in his convertible so he 
can rest or read. Another sergeant follows in a second car to take the first 
driver back. 
</P>
<P>
* Assemblywoman Sunny Mojonnier (R-Encinitas) once asked a sergeant to take a 
blanket and snacks to her teen-age son in Nevada City. She has him picked up 
from his Sacramento high school as often as two or three times a week. 
</P>
<P>
* Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) has had cat food delivered to his home and 
office. Robbins once asked that his cat be brought to the Capitol, sergeants 
said, but that request was refused. 
</P>
<P>
* Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie Brown has a personal sergeant, so his 
requests for service are not printed in the logs. Other sergeants rush packages 
from the Capitol to his San Francisco law office or home at least weekly. Brown 
would not say what is in them. 
</P>
<P>
The sergeants have also driven legislators or their children to ballgames, 
movies and rock concerts. They have carried out legislators' household garbage, 
moved furniture into lawmakers' homes, searched for lost items, picked up 
prescriptions, fetched a forgotten umbrella or coat, and even purchased 
underwear. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature has created a network that critics charge has virtually turned 
the sergeants into private servants. Logs show the sergeants receive 
legislators' orders every few minutes throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Holton, of the public interest group Common Cause, said legislators 
"shouldn't be treating them (sergeants and drivers) like private servants. 
They're public servants." 
</P>
<P>
However, legislative leaders argue that the sergeants and Senate drivers serve 
an important purpose: allowing lawmakers to spend less time on personal errands 
and more on legislative matters. 
</P>
<P>
"His (a sergeant's or a driver's) time is far less valuable than that of a 
member," Assembly Rules Chairman Tom Bane (D-Tarzana) said. 
</P>
<P>
Bane acknowledged, however, "There's no question in my mind that some things 
are done that shouldn't be done. But people are elected to be responsible." 
</P>
<P>
The legislators began using sergeants to drive them around in the 1960s, 
primarily to go to and from the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Mindful of potential abuses, Senate leaders have tried to restrict their 
members' use of drivers -- who unlike the Assembly are not sergeants-at-arms -- 
to the basic airport, laundry, banking and lunch runs. Many senators drive 
their own state-leased cars or a pool car. 
</P>
<P>
Former Sen. Joseph B. Montoya of Whittier, who resigned after his conviction 
last month on political corruption charges, sought to use the service for rides 
to his lawyer's office, according to a Senate source who asked not to be 
identified. He was told not to, but once persuaded a driver to take him anyway, 
logs indicated. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly, on the other hand, "allows the members to be taken wherever they 
need to go," even to campaign fund-raisers and other political events, Bane 
said. "They put in long hours, and if it saves them time, then they can use 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), however, said his 
house does not allow the practice because it could be construed as using 
taxpayers' money for political purposes, which is illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly sergeants are instructed to remain closed-mouthed about where they 
take the members, and many are afraid to talk even after they quit their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"There were times when I picked up a girlfriend one day and a wife the next, 
and I just kept a straight face," said former sergeant Lydia Sims, who recently 
received $95,500 in a settlement of her sexual harassment lawsuit against a 
supervisor and the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
A reporter requested to review the sergeants' logs under the California 
legislative open records law. Shortly thereafter, the Assembly began giving 
less detailed descriptions about errands they were asked to run. For example, 
instead of saying where a member is driven to, the logs now simply read, 
"member transport." Assembly Chief Sgt. Charles Bell said the change was made 
"for security reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Still, a detailed picture of the sergeants' service can be pieced together from 
a review of their earlier logs and from interviews with drivers. A United Press 
International review found a wide variety of uses. 
</P>
<P>
Although most legislators favor ride-sharing programs for the commuting public, 
logs show they usually have separate cars pick them up at the airport, even if 
they're on the same flight or their flights are only a few minutes apart. 
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers, such as Mojonnier, use the state sergeants to drive family 
members around. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Mojonnier denied having her teen-age son picked up at or driven to 
school recently, but when notified that logs for the last year show that 
occurring as many as three times in a week, she said, "Well, it's been a long 
time." 
</P>
<P>
"My time is so encumbered," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Other legislators frequently ask the state drivers to run personal errands. 
</P>
<P>
According to Senate logs, Robbins, for example, regularly asks a driver to take 
his boots to the first floor of the Capitol to be shined, to have personal or 
campaign letters brought to a secretarial service to be typed, to have his 
girlfriends brought to the airport and to have packages of tofu picked up from 
the airport. 
</P>
<P>
The logs also show that Robbins had cat food delivered to his office and home. 
Robbins says it probably was medication, not cat food. Robbins also asked to 
have his cat brought to the Capitol one day but was refused. He said he wanted 
the cat there for an animal rights hearing. Robbins defended his requests, 
noting that he gave the Senate Rules Committee $1,260 in the last year for any 
personal services the state may have had to pay for. 
</P>
<P>
But Holton of Common Cause said: "That's obviously a very haphazard way of 
doing things. That does not undo the fact that they are using state resources 
for their personal gain."

VAN DE KAMP AD AGAINST FEINSTEIN WILL BE CHANGED; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNOR'S RACE: NEWSPAPER THREATENS TO SUE HIM OVER ALLEGED TRADEMARK 
INFRINGEMENT. 
</P>

<P>
Under threat of a lawsuit, Democratic gubernatorial candidate John K. Van de 
Kamp has agreed to alter a negative commercial he is running about Dianne 
Feinstein because it uses the registered trademark of the San Francisco 
Chronicle while attacking Feinstein's record as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
"That is our trademark," Ron Ingram, general counsel of the Chronicle 
Publishing Co., said Saturday, "and we wanted it out of that advertisement 
because we do not feel we can let people capriciously use our trademark for 
their own purposes." 
</P>
<P>
In a development highly unusual for a statewide campaign, the Washington 
consulting firm of Doak, Shrum and Associates, producers of the ad, shipped out 
new versions of the Van de Kamp commercial without the newspaper's name. 
</P>
<P>
Ingram said he was under the impression that the ad his company objects to 
would be off the air by Sunday at the latest. But television programming 
procedures make it difficult to substitute ads on weekends, so the 
controversial ad will probably run until Monday at noon on stations around 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Informed of this, Ingram said, "If it is not off by Monday we will seek a 
cease-and-desist order to remove it." 
</P>
<P>
The ad in question uses newspaper articles to support its charges about 
Feinstein's stewardship of San Francisco. The newspaper's trademark, or front 
page nameplate, "San Francisco Chronicle," appears in four frames of the 
30-second commercial. 
</P>
<P>
A small photograph of Van de Kamp appears at the bottom of the last frame of 
the commercial along with a notice that the ad is paid for by his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"In our judgment, one of your advertisements violates trademark and related 
rights of (The Chronicle) by falsely designating the origin of the 
advertisement and by implying that the Chronicle Publishing Co. supports or 
endorses you, your advertisement, that style of advertisement, or your comments 
regarding Dianne Feinstein," Neil Shapiro, an attorney for the Chronicle, wrote 
Van de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein, Van de Kamp's opponent in the June 5 Democratic primary, recently 
soared past Van de Kamp in the Los Angeles Times Poll. She did that largely 
because of a television ad she ran in February that described her mayoral years 
in positive terms. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp has said that he felt compelled to run his negative commercial to 
point out things in Feinstein's record that she had left out. These range from 
his allegation that "she was cited for dumping a billion gallons of sewage" 
into San Francisco Bay to her responsibility for a projected $180-million 
deficit in the first budget of her successor, Mayor Art Agnos. 
</P>
<P>
A Times analysis of the Van de Kamp ad found that some of the charges were 
debatable, however. For example, Feinstein inherited an antiquated sewage 
system and then proceeded to build a new system. 
</P>
<P>
Ingram said Chronicle officials saw The Times' analysis, which was accompanied 
by a photograph taken from the Van de Kamp ad. The Chronicle trademark was in 
the photograph. 
</P>
<P>
"When we communicated (concern) to the Van de Kamp campaign they at first said 
they would not take it out," Ingram continued. "So we told them we would seek a 
temporary restraining order to stop them. At that point, about 2 o'clock 
Friday, they agreed to do it and said they would have the new ad in the 
stations on Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
A random check of California TV stations on Saturday, including those in Los 
Angeles, found that the Van de Kamp ad with the Chronicle trademark was still 
being aired. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles lawyer Mickey Kantor, who handled the negotiations for Van de Kamp, 
said: "We explained to the Chronicle that we would have the new ad in the 
stations by Saturday with instructions to substitute it for the other ad. But 
we told the Chronicle that it was up to the stations, not us, to make the 
change." 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to reach television executives were unsuccessful. But the standard 
procedure for running television advertisements on a weekend makes it very 
difficult to substitute a new ad after noon on Friday, three industry experts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, most big stations have computerized programming operations "that 
make weekend changes almost impossible after noon" in the words of a Sacramento 
consultant not involved in the governor's race and who asked not to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Kay, a buyer of television time in Los Angeles also not connected with the 
gubernatorial campaigns, said Saturday, "The stations have to take special 
steps to remove an ad from the air on a weekend" because few engineers and 
executives with the authority to make the changes work on weekends.

DEMOCRATS SET DELEGATE SELECTION RULES; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE ACTION IS TAKEN EARLY AND SMOOTHLY. ONE PROVISION ALLOWS 
CALIFORNIA TO ADVANCE ITS PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY, BUT THE STATE MAY NOT ACT.

The Democratic National Committee on Saturday approved new delegate selection 
rules for the 1992 campaign -- including a critical provision that would allow 
California to move up its presidential primary -- and party leaders declared 
themselves ready to take on the Republicans and win back the White House. 
</P>
<P>
"By locking up one of the earliest and certainly the smoothest rules-making 
process we've ever had, we now allow our presidential candidates to focus on 
their message, not shadowbox over rules," Michael McCurry, the party's 
communications director, said in an interview at the national committee meeting 
here. 
</P>
<P>
But, even if the formal rules debate -- which in the past had often dragged on 
interminably -- is over, the change in the timing of the candidate selection 
process appears to have injected a new element of uncertainty into the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Under the rules adopted here, the "window," or the time alloted for most 
delegate contests, will start on the first Tuesday in March, instead of the 
second Tuesday, as in 1988. Party leaders said that the change was made in 
general to encourage big states to advance the dates of their delegate 
selection contests in the hope that this would put an earlier end to the often 
divisive intraparty competition for the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
More specifically, the new rule was designed to accommodate party leaders in 
California, who have been trying to advance their primary from its traditional 
June date to an earlier time, which could give the nation's largest state 
increased influence on the presidential nominating process. 
</P>
<P>
But it is by no means clear that California will make that change. The effort 
to advance the primary date has been bogged down in the Legislature in 
Sacramento, caught in a dispute between those who want to hold one combined 
primary for presidential candidates and state office seekers in March and those 
who advocate two primaries -- one in March for the presidency, the other in 
June or September for state candidates. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, advocates of an earlier presidential primary for California are no 
longer confident that it will become reality, even though the national 
committee has tried to smooth the path with its rules revision. 
</P>
<P>
"If it doesn't pass in two weeks, I think it's dead," Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown 
Jr., state party chairman, told a reporter at the national committee meeting. 
</P>
<P>
If California fails to take advantage of the opening created by the 1992 rules, 
other big states might fill the void, McCurry suggested. But the possibility 
that states will shift the dates of their delegate selection processes adds to 
the tactical uncertainties facing strategists for potential 1992 Democratic 
presidential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of what the individual states do, the party's national chairman, Ron 
Brown, declared that, with the adoption of the 1992 rules, "our internal party 
work is over and we can get down to the serious business of electing 
Democrats." 
</P>
<P>
As evidence of his determination to focus the party on substantive rather than 
procedural issues, he cited the national committee's adoption Saturday of a 
resolution endorsing the proposal by New York Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan to cut the Social Security payroll tax. 
</P>
<P>
"It just makes sense for us Democrats to be on the side of cutting taxes for 
working people," Brown told national committee members here. The chairman 
called the Social Security tax "one of the most regressive we have." And he 
described Moynihan's proposal to reduce the tax to keep the Social Security 
trust fund from being used to reduce the overall federal deficit as "a blow for 
fairness, a triumph for honesty."

FILM FESTIVAL GIVES SOVIETS LOOK AT JEWISH LIFE IN WEST; 
</P>
<P>
CULTURE: 'IT SEEMS REALLY OK TO BE JEWISH,' ONE VIEWER SAYS AFTER SEEING THE 
FIRST AMERICAN MOVIE.

Soviet Jews, so uncertain of what it means to be Jewish after decades of being 
denied the right of religious and cultural expression, are seeing how Jews 
live, work and love in America, in Israel and in Western Europe through a 
weeklong festival of Jewish films here. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems really OK to be Jewish, really so human," a 24-year-old literature 
student, Mikhail A. Shtein, said Saturday as he watched the festival's opening 
film, "Crossing Delancey." 
</P>
<P>
"In the film, people recognize, of course, that they are Jewish. But this is 
not a burden, and they even celebrate it. . . . To us, this is amazing." 
</P>
<P>
In "Crossing Delancey," a 1988 romantic comedy directed by Joan Micklin Silver, 
the Jewish heroine tussles with her grandmother and the neighborhood matchmaker 
-- and her own conscience -- over whether to accept the proposal of a man they 
had found for her, a purveyor of kosher dill pickles, over the attentions of a 
famous novelist and another man who only visits when his wife is out of town. 
</P>
<P>
"This is everyday life, not great drama," Shtein said. "What amazes us in this 
film is that being Jewish is quite natural. . . . They accept it, others around 
them accept it, and life goes on." 
</P>
<P>
The festival, a joint project of the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival and the 
American-Soviet Film Initiative in Moscow, is intended precisely to "challenge 
all stereotypes and images of Jews," Deborah Kaufman, its director, said at the 
opening Saturday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Roman Spector, a prominent Jewish activist in Moscow and one of the founders of 
the new Confederation of Jewish Organizations and Religious Communities, added, 
"We Soviet Jews now have a real possibility to become acquainted with the life 
of Jews elsewhere -- in Israel, in Europe and America, elsewhere in the 
Diaspora -- from which we were cut off for so long." 
</P>
<P>
The isolation of Jews here led to such a loss of self-identity, other Jewish 
activists said, that it is likely to endure for a generation or two. 
</P>
<P>
For Esther Beilin, 46, an economist, the festival is an opportunity not just to 
glimpse at how individuals view their Jewishness -- "it's hardly an 
affliction," she said -- but how Jewish communities in other countries have 
managed to grow and develop where those in the Soviet Union, which has the 
world's third-largest Jewish population after the United States and Israel, has 
been so contained. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the glories of modern Judaism are rooted here in Russia, and we know 
nothing about them," Beilin said. "This is more than a pity -- it is our shame. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
Janis Plotkin, the festival's co-director, said that a major goal of the San 
Francisco festival in bringing the films to Moscow was helping Soviet Jews 
recover both the personal and community sense of their Jewish identity. 
</P>
<P>
"We use these films to reach out to Jewish people and people of many other 
backgrounds to show them what is important in Jewish history, culture and 
community affairs," Plotkin said. "By sharing a film together, we create a 
community, and community helps create a more human approach to understanding 
the diversity of cultures in the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-nine films from eight countries will be shown at the festival.

EUROPE COUNCIL FEARS FOR LITHUANIA;

<P>
DIPLOMACY: THE 23-NATION GROUP EXPRESSES CONCERN OVER POSSIBLE MILITARY 
INTERVENTION BY MOSCOW.

Foreign ministers of the 23-nation Council of Europe expressed deep concern 
Saturday about the possibility of Soviet military intervention in Lithuania, 
reacting to an appeal for world support by the Baltic republic. 
</P>
<P>
But the ministers, concluding a two-day meeting here, did not pass any 
resolutions on the sensitive subject. 
</P>
<P>
Portuguese Foreign Minister Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the current council 
president, said the Lithuanian issue did not come up for a vote. Deus Pinheiro 
nevertheless appealed to Moscow not to act rashly in Lithuania, which has 
declared its independence from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Deus Pinheiro added that he hopes the Lithuanian situation can be resolved 
through negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers, holding a special meeting to discuss Eastern Europe, 
also expressed concern over ethnic violence that has broken out elsewhere in 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"We launch an urgent appeal to all parties concerned to exercise restraints, 
refrain from violence and seek peaceful solutions," Deus Pinheiro said at a 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Although no country was named specifically, the diplomat's remarks were 
prompted by the situation in Romania, where ethnic violence has erupted against 
the Hungarian minority in Transylvania, council sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Fears about possible Soviet armed action in Lithuania were expressed by several 
foreign ministers, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
But the Council of Europe seemed leery of taking a stand on a matter not on the 
agenda, according to those attending closed meetings, because the foreign 
ministers were torn between supporting self-determination for Lithuania and the 
desire not to embarrass Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The European Council also expressed "great support" for an Austrian proposal to 
hold a special council ministerial meeting on the problems of migration in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Austria, as well as other nations hard-pressed by migrants, would like a better 
definition of political and economic refugees, diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
The discussions on minority problems in Eastern Europe, as part of talks about 
the political future of Europe, overshadowed conversations about German 
unification. 
</P>
<P>
But West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher was on hand to reassure 
his fellow ministers that German unity poses no serious threat to the stability 
of the Council of Europe or the European Community. 
</P>
<P>
He repeated similar statements made by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to 
the European Community representatives in Brussels on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Some European Community officials, including EC President Jacques Delors, have 
expressed concern that West German preoccupation with unity would delay Bonn's 
enthusiasm for a single-market Europe, set to be in place by the end of 1992. 
But Deus Pinheiro told his news conference that the members fully support 
German unification. 
</P>
<P>
The Council of Europe is composed of all of the Western European nations and 
has generally focused on human rights and political matters, while the 
12-member European Community is mainly occupied with economic integration. 
</P>
<P>
Although the European Community is a tightly restricted club, the Council of 
Europe opens its doors to all European nations that institute democratic 
regimes and observe human rights. 
</P>
<P>
The council has been in the forefront of the search for ways to aid Eastern 
European nations in their attempt to shuck off communism and install democratic 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary, Poland, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia currently have special guest 
status on the council; Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia have applied for such 
status, and Hungary, Poland and Yugoslavia have formally asked for full 
membership. 
</P>
<P>
Their applications are undergoing scrutiny to make sure, as Deus Pinheiro put 
it, that they meet the council's standards of democracy.

U.S. CATCHING FORMER NAZIS AT AIRPORTS; 
</P>
<P>
TRAVEL: THE DROPPING OF VISA REQUIREMENTS FOR GERMANS LETS POSSIBLE WAR 
CRIMINALS ENTER THE COUNTRY. BUT A FEDERAL AGENCY IS WAITING FOR THEM.

<P>
The flight from Europe to America and the Florida cruise that he had won in a 
contest looked like the vacation of a lifetime to the West German. 
</P>
<P>
But, when the Justice Department's Office of Special Investigation got word 
that the man had just landed at Boston's Logan Airport, officials in Washington 
checked their computers and found that he had been a member of Hitler's dreaded 
SS and was a designated war criminal. 
</P>
<P>
So, instead of basking in the Caribbean sun, he was sent packing straight back 
to Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The incident, one of a small but growing number of rejections at U.S. entry 
points, reflects a little-known aspect of the Office of Special Investigation, 
best known for stripping the U.S. citizenship of ex-Nazis linked to wartime 
persecution and deporting them. 
</P>
<P>
The rejections are another means of "exacting some justice" against Nazi 
offenders, said the office's director, Neal Sher. 
</P>
<P>
Apprehensions of ex-Nazis at U.S. airports, while infrequent, are increasing 
because of a pilot program, begun in 1988, that allows citizens of West Germany 
and seven other countries to visit the United States without first obtaining a 
visa from a U.S. embassy abroad, as previously had been required. 
</P>
<P>
The old procedure provided time for the person's name to be checked against 
State Department and Immigration and Naturalization Service "watch lists" -- 
rosters of individuals who are barred from entering the United States -- and 
for any questions to be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot program was adopted to save resources, promote tourism and 
reciprocate with countries that do not require U.S. travelers to obtain visas. 
</P>
<P>
Since last October, immigration authorities have turned back nine individuals 
at U.S. airports for Nazi-related activities, Sher said. But, with travel to 
the United States increasing, he expects the numbers to continue to rise. 
</P>
<P>
The experimental visa waiver program, which runs until next year, has led to 
such airport incidents as that of the cruise-bound West German, who was called 
to Sher's attention at 11 p.m., after the man had arrived at Logan Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, there is not enough time or information to turn back the traveler at 
the point of entry. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Sher said that during last year's Christmas holiday travel season 
he was called by INS authorities at Kennedy Airport in New York about another 
West German who was on a list of persons sought by the French for World War II 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
The individual -- Sher would not disclose names -- admitted having belonged to 
an infamous SS unit responsible for massacring captured Canadian soldiers 
immediately after D-Day, when the Allied forces landed in France. 
</P>
<P>
But the West German insisted that he had not joined the unit until August, 
1944, two months after the massacre took place. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't verify immediately, so he was allowed in," Sher said. Then Sher 
and his deputy arranged to interview the man, who had come to the United States 
to visit his son at Princeton University. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an intense interrogation," in which the ex-SS member finally admitted 
to having joined the unit before D-Day, Sher said. "He was carrying orders from 
one squad to another, and they discussed what was being done to the Canadians. 
It was vicious." 
</P>
<P>
When the man was notified that he had to cut short his visit and return to 
Germany, "he felt offended and just couldn't understand why we were doing this 
after all those years," Sher said. 
</P>

To guard against such occurrences during the pilot program, a State Department 
spokeswoman said, foreigners are urged to apply for visas at U.S. embassies if 
they think questions might be raised about their entry.

Republican gubernatorial candidate Clayton W. Williams, preparing for a cattle 
roundup at his ranch Saturday, compared the rainy, cold weather spoiling the 
event to a rape. "If it's inevitable, just relax and enjoy it," Williams said 
to ranch hands and reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Williams later apologized and said: "That's just a joke . . . . It wasn't a 
serious statement." 
</P>
<P>
Williams will face state Treasurer Ann Richards or Atty. Gen. Jim Mattox in the 
November general election after one of them wins an April 10 Democratic runoff. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because you're in the barnyard doesn't mean you have to act like Clayton 
Williams does," Mattox said. 
</P>
<P>
Richards' spokesman, Monte Williams, said: "It's unfortunate and disturbing 
that the Republican nominee would joke about violence against women. It's an 
insensitive and reprehensible remark."

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lithuania's president accused Moscow on Friday of waging psychological warfare 
against his small republic with an escalating series of military maneuvers and 
demands. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials turned up the pressure against the Baltic republic that 
declared independence on March 11, with the Tass news agency's saying the 
situation was approaching "anarchy in all its manifestations." 
</P>
<P>
Such tough language in the past has been used to prepare Soviets for major 
steps by the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Friday afternoon: 
"The situation appears to progressively get worse." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush said Friday that any attempt by the Soviets to intimidate 
Lithuania or to use force "is bound to backfire. That is inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said the United States stands with "the brave men and women of Lithuania" 
in their struggle for self-determination. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that the Soviet Union has a longstanding interest in Lithuania, but 
those interests can only be addressed through dialogue and negotiation," Bush 
told a luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
By dark in Lithuania, the republic appeared calm, keeping the demeanor of its 
determined drive to restore the independence lost to Stalin's army in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said the Soviet Union had ordered two American consular officers 
out of Lithuania, giving them 12 hours to leave. U.S. officials said other 
foreign diplomats and some journalists also had been told to leave the 
Lithuanian capital. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomats, Leningrad-based consuls Douglas Wake and Jon Purnell, said 
Friday night in Vilnius that they had heard nothing about the order for them to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said the diplomats will comply, but added that Moscow did not give 
the United States a reason for the expulsion. He said the Soviet chief of 
protocol relayed the expulsion notice to officials at the U.S. Embassy in 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
He said the two officials were in Vilnius "on routine reporting and analysis, 
as they do for the embassy." 
</P>
<P>
"They are staff people in our consulate in Leningrad," he said. "They're not 
spies." 
</P>
<P>
Wake, the U.S. diplomat, said U.S. officials regularly traveled to Lithuania in 
the course of their consular work, but declined to comment any further on his 
mission there. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials on Friday continued to increase their pressure on Lithuania to 
renounce its declaration of independence from the Soviet Union: 
</P>
<P>
* The Soviet Union informed Poland it was suspending visa-free travel for Poles 
and Lithuanians across the border, the official Tass news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
* A military helicopter with a Soviet red star emblazoned on its side dumped 
leaflets on downtown Vilnius containing a copy of Gorbachev's directive that 
the republic of 3.8 million respect Soviet law. 
</P>
<P>
* Foreign Ministry officials said Soviet embassies would review foreigners' 
visa applications to travel to Lithuania to keep out people "inclined to engage 
in illegal activities," Tass said. It did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union forcibly annexed Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia half a century 
ago as part of an agreement between Josef Stalin and Adolf Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen armored personnel carriers and military trucks moved into 
Vilnius on Thursday in what was regarded as a show of strength by the Soviet 
military. 
</P>
<P>
"New troops and maneuvers suggest that this is a psychological war," Lithuanian 
President Vytautus Landsbergis told a session of the Legislative Council 
parliament. 
</P>
<P>
But Landsbergis told legislators he still trusted Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe his choices are limited, maybe there are obstacles around him," he said. 
"But we have faith in the common sense and the goodwill of Gorbachev and the 
leadership of the Soviet Union," despite the escalating war of nerves. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials reiterated that Gorbachev wants to solve the dispute 
peacefully. Soviet officials have said that they ruled out using force to bring 
Lithuania back into the Soviet fold. 
</P>
<P>
"We will do everything possible to avoid complications," said Valentin Falin, 
head of the Communist Party Central Committee's international department. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a great amount of goodwill in Mr. Gorbachev," he told West European 
parliamentarians in Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, the former Soviet military chief of staff who is 
a military adviser to Gorbachev, told reporters the army would act according to 
Soviet laws in dealing with Lithuanian deserters. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if arrests might not cause disruption in Lithuania and make Moscow look 
bad, Akhromeyev said: "Whether it looks good or looks bad, there's an 
established order, even if some people don't like it." He said military law 
calls for deserters to be detained and sent back to their units. 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian government said Thursday that plainclothes officers detained one 
soldier on a Vilnius street. Landsbergis said military officials had refused to 
release the man. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has also ordered Lithuanians to surrender all their firearms. He told 
Landsbergis he expects the republic to stop its sign-up for a volunteer defense 
force. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuanians turned in only 39 firearms on Thursday and 34 on Friday, Soviet TV 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania issued an appeal to the world for support late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Landsbergis also appealed directly to the Soviet legislature for negotiations 
to solve all of the issues that Gorbachev has raised. A three-page letter was 
sent to the Supreme Soviet on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Any attempt by the government or military organizations of the U.S.S.R. to 
interfere in enforcement of Lithuanian law in Lithuania will be viewed as a 
violation of generally recognized principles of international law," the letter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the letter said that in a 1920 treaty, the Soviet Union recognized 
"for all time" the sovereign rights and independence of Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
Friday afternoon, Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger summoned 
Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin to his office at the State Department, 
apparently to receive a U.S. protest note.

AFTER A FALL, PAIN IS BOTH HER CONSTANT COMPANION AND HER JAILER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two years and a few months ago, I lost control of my life. 
</P>
<P>
Pain took over. 
</P>
<P>
Now it regulates nearly every moment of my waking life, holding me captive to 
its savage dictates. 
</P>
<P>
Twice a night, too, it comes to visit, sometimes just to say hello and remind 
me it is still around, other times to visit for a long chat. 
</P>
<P>
Pain makes me irritable, it makes me cry. It sends me into fits of rage and 
sloughs of despair. 
</P>
<P>
My pain stems from a neck injury suffered in a fall that ironically was caused 
by a medication that dumped my blood pressure and sent me into a semiconvulsion 
in my kitchen. I woke up choking on my blood, not sure how long I had been 
unconscious, whether it was all blood pressure or whether the bonks on Formica 
contributed. 
</P>
<P>
The immediate damage was quickly assessed. I had knocked out my two front 
teeth. Although my neck and shoulders ached, it seemed like the kind of pain 
that I, as a weekend warrior athlete, would normally get when I played tennis 
or softball. 
</P>
<P>
But these aches did not heal. They went from aching to the feeling that a 
woodpecker was perched on my right shoulder constantly pecking at a knot in the 
right side of my neck. Then the pain started shooting up and down the spine. 
Then the muscle spasms took over. One night I lost most of the power in my 
right side temporarily. I started falling on the street, my right leg just 
losing it. 
</P>
<P>
I have consulted more than a dozen physicians, mostly specialists, as well as 
non-traditional healers, two acupuncturists, one acupressurist, even a pain 
hypnotist. He decreed that I was among the 20% of the population that is not 
hypnotizable. 
</P>
<P>
The consensus is that I have crossed over into what they call Chronic Pain 
Syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
I don't want to hear that. 
</P>
<P>
I want it fixed, dammit. 
</P>
<P>
If they can operate on fetal hearts, sew back fingers severed by subway cars, 
perform open heart surgery as routinely as appendectomies, why, oh why, can't 
they fix a neck that simply took a heavy bang? 
</P>
<P>
Pain has changed my life, narrowing it as old age will eventually do. But, at 
49, I'm not old enough to be this old. I feel like in the last two years I have 
aged 30. 
</P>
<P>
I no longer drive. It is too painful and potentially hazardous. I've let my 
license expire. 
</P>
<P>
I've been to one Broadway show and one movie since the accident. It is too 
painful to sit in a seat for two hours, especially at night when I have been up 
part of the day. Ditto for museums, art galleries, concerts and all the other 
reasons one chooses to live in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
I cannot read for long periods at a time. 
</P>
<P>
Doing dishes is a killer, but a necessity. Ironing is out. I don't wear 
anything that needs to be ironed. 
</P>
<P>
I rarely wear my contact lenses anymore. The neck movement to put them in and 
take them out is a painful one. 
</P>
<P>
I've not bought any clothes since the Nov. 13, 1987, fall. It's too painful to 
try them on. 
</P>
<P>
I tried shopping once, but the pain became overpowering and I raced home, to a 
Manhattan apartment that has now become my workplace most of the time. It seems 
silly. I live 20 blocks from my office, but it costs too much in pain to go in 
to the office every day. It is more productive and less painful, but lonely and 
isolated, to work from home. With today's computer technology, it's possible. 
</P>
<P>
It's the little things that defeat my spirit. Routine tasks have become mine 
fields waiting to explode the pain. Pulling on pantyhose and boots? Could be 
the worst mistake of the day. Brushing my teeth? It always hurts. Why washing 
my hair, under a hot shower, hurts, is the biggest mystery. That should feel 
good, but it doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
I see movies now on my VCR. I've also learned that people, even close friends, 
just are incapable of understanding something as foreign as this kind of 
captivity. They constantly ask if I've seen the latest movie -- or eagerly 
recommend one. 
</P>
<P>
I have explained for a million times that I don't go to movies. They ask, 
incredulously, for the millionth time, how could sitting in a movie bother me? 
</P>
<P>
What do you say? Nothing. Eventually, you don't explain. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, I could go to a movie if that was the only plan of the day. It's just that 
too many other things take priority. Working, fixing food, getting dressed, 
running errands, going to the supermarket, writing checks, dumping garbage. 
</P>
<P>
Before the fall, I usually took care of household chores in a white tornado 
fashion, food shopping, laundry and apartment cleaning all in one day, usually 
finishing by 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
I usually went out four or five times a week, either to a play, a movie, dinner 
at someone's home or a restaurant, nothing dramatic. I frequently was a weekend 
guest at country homes of friends. I sailed. I often walked 2 miles to work, 
through Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I'm mostly an isolated homebody. I'm lucky I have a single friend left. I 
have canceled more appointments than I've kept. 
</P>
<P>
My pain has caused me to budget my activities, the way a person existing on a 
limited fixed income shops. My "income" is the ability to stand or sit up 
straight, to do anything that requires flexion, the ability to look down, to 
concentrate without the overwhelming distraction of pain. 
</P>
<P>
In short, to function. 
</P>
<P>
I manage my pennies of energy carefully. Going out at night is a lavish 
expenditure. 
</P>
<P>
New companions, in addition to the cervical collar, are the moist heating pad; 
the old sock with three tennis balls inside, the better to get the heat on the 
spot where the pain likes to sear; jars and jars of Mineral Ice, a remedy that 
works something like putting medication on a tooth that really needs dental 
attention. Its help is short-lived, but I'll take it. 
</P>
<P>
I've learned a lot of tricks, some vetoed by the doctors. One is to drive the 
back of my head into the living room carpet with all my might. It seems to get 
something off of something. Trouble is, the sophisticated tests don't show 
anything on anything. I'm betting on my body, not technology. The other is to 
hunker down, put all my weight on the balls of my feet and stretch out the 
whole spine. That helps too -- for no apparent medical reason. 
</P>
<P>
I have learned a lot about pain. 
</P>
<P>
One: It can drive you crazy, even in small amounts, by its constancy. 
</P>
<P>
Two: It can drive you to question your sanity when it lifts. When pain is gone, 
for some mysterious reason, so is the memory of it. You immediately begin 
thinking you made it all up. Or, more ominously, that it's not coming back. I 
still fall for that. I guess it's a tribute to the elasticity of the human 
spirit. It's also pretty stupid. 
</P>
<P>
Three: It's not nice to fool Mother Nature. Distraction therapy works 
temporarily. While it may be good for the psyche, pain will get the last laugh. 
You pay the piper if you push the body beyond where it is ready to go. It is 
better to cooperate. When it says this is going to be a bad day, believe it. 
Rest it. The next day will be better. 
</P>
<P>
Four: Pain is tiring. 
</P>
<P>
Five: Pain is not one entity. It is an orchestra, sometimes featuring a 
soloist, sometimes many instruments. My worst pain is the searing pain right 
along the right side of the vertebrae. It can be razor sharp with each step 
digging in. 
</P>
<P>
There is the shooting pain down my right arm, often causing ersatz numbness in 
my fingers. It's not total numbness. It's more like the sensation you have when 
the novocaine is wearing off. You feel something, but not everything. 
</P>
<P>
There is the stab of the muscle spasms, the ache of soreness, sometimes dull, 
sometimes acute, always persistent. 
</P>
<P>
Twice a week I go to physical therapy where I am tractioned, ultrasounded, 
electronically stimulated. I spend a few minutes every hour exercising. I am 
surely by now a contender for a mention in the Guinness Book of World Records 
for the most shoulder rolls completed. 
</P>
<P>
I will not share all the advice I've been given. You can imagine it. One I 
must. A New Ager among my acquaintances told me this unmitigating pain was a 
wonderful opportunity for spiritual growth. Fortunately, she was on the other 
end of the telephone, out of range of my rage. 
</P>
<P>
The one piece of advice I will never take is that I must quit fighting, that I 
must accept the pain. 
</P>
<P>
I will never give up. I will get rid of it.

<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes, Mary Freeland looks at her son and remembers the kid who used to 
coast his bike down Colonel Bell Drive to the whoops of the neighborhood gang. 
</P>
<P>
But then she looks again and reality crashes in: It's two decades later, and he 
still is that child. 
</P>
<P>
It's two decades later, and Freeland is back to being a full-time mother, six 
years after she placed her son in a school for the mentally retarded and began 
a new life. The state has run out of money and Patrick Reardon, along with 
hundreds of other adults like him, has been sent home. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a grandmother," said Freeland, whose eldest daughter, Molly, has a son. 
"And I'm raising a child I'll be raising forever, starting all over again." 
</P>
<P>
Similar situations affect more than 63,000 families nationwide, the U.S. Assn. 
for Retarded Citizens says. 
</P>
<P>
The future is frightening and uncertain. Everyone -- even Patrick -- knows he 
needs to return to the kind of structured environment he was forced to leave 
when he reached the cutoff age of 22 last June. 
</P>
<P>
In his pale, unlined face, the family sees Patrick's anger at the separation 
from the residential school where friends and a rigid routine kept him in 
balance. 
</P>
<P>
In his seizures and increasing violence, they witness utter despair. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, Patrick more frequently refuses to walk and instead folds his body into 
a wheelchair, deflated as much by loneliness as by his trembling and calcified 
joints. Over the New Year's weekend, he threw himself down a flight of steps. A 
few weeks later, he did it again. 
</P>
<P>
"We're watching him become more and more passive and slow. He's not the Patrick 
I first met eight years ago," said Stephen Freeland, who combined his two 
children with Mary's five when they married in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
These people are fighters. They have coped with Patrick and another retarded 
child -- Mary's 24-year-old daughter, who is under state care, turned 22 before 
the cutoff requirement was in place. 
</P>
<P>
Together, Mary and Stephen Freeland have weathered divorce, beaten alcoholism, 
overcome depression and made ends meet. They held on after the suicide five 
years ago of Mary's eldest son, who would now be 25. 
</P>
<P>
But watching this second son, a poster child for a mental health organization 
in 1974, collapse into depression and destructive outbursts has been too much 
to bear. 
</P>
<P>
"I've lost one son already. I can't sit by and watch while I lose another," 
said Mary Freeland, 49. She divorced Patrick's father a decade before he died 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The Freelands have written letters to newspaper editors and lobbied 
representatives, but it looks unlikely that the state will place Patrick in the 
supervised group home his family feels he needs. 
</P>
<P>
In Massachusetts, about 595 mentally retarded adults are at home who under 
healthier fiscal circumstances would be provided residential care, said Maureen 
Sullivan of the state Department of Mental Retardation. Another 989 people are 
on day-care waiting lists, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Parents and activists have taken their cases to the Massachusetts courts, but 
haven't been able to force the state's hand. 
</P>
<P>
The state's budget crisis forced the freeze on funding for mentally retarded 
adults, and strong anti-tax sentiments have stalled efforts to reverse the 
situation, said Philip Johnston, Massachusetts secretary of human services. 
</P>
<P>
"Patrick is falling apart because he's not getting what he needs, and I'm 
beginning to lose control because nothing is normal anymore," Mary Freeland 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing is normal. Family members are drawn into Patrick's quirky world and, 
although they are wise to his attempts at manipulation, it's hard to deny him 
the routine he relied on when under professional care. 
</P>
<P>
"Patrick gets things in his head, the way he wants things done and when. He 
wants only certain people to get him up in the morning and if they don't, he 
won't budge," said Stephen Freeland, whose 15-year-old son, Shane, usually is 
the alarm clock of choice. 
</P>
<P>
Shane's job is to roust Patrick from bed and start him dressing while his 
father hunts down a razor and prepares for the ritual, painstaking shave. Mary 
must be sure she has the exact cereal brand and flavor of juice for her son, 
who won't eat otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
After school, 18-year-old Cathy often leaves her friends to go home and keep an 
eye on Patrick, who spends hours in his upstairs bedroom writing random names 
hundreds of times or endlessly listening to the taped voices of friends lost 
when he left the Cardinal Cushing School. 
</P>
<P>
Mary is trying to launch an insurance business and Stephen is struggling to 
sell real estate despite the slumping local market. But their thoughts never 
stray far from Patrick, who spends part of the week at a day-care center. 
</P>
<P>
This balancing act takes its toll. 
</P>
<P>
"My son told me yesterday: 'I need you to stay home with me and be here,' " 
Mary said, her voice cracking. "And I know I should. I know he's right. But 
I've got to work and I just can't care for a 6-foot-tall man 24 hours a day." 
</P>
<P>
Stephen, a steady realist who shares with Mary a cockeyed humor amid the tragic 
and absurd, picks up a lot of the slack. But even this sturdy, bearded man has 
met his match in Patrick. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I feel like taking a plane out of here . . . but I love the family. 
I wouldn't want to be alone," said Stephen, a veteran who was briefly homeless 
when he returned from Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Alcoholics Anonymous has helped the Freelands deal with drinking problems, but 
they are on their own when it comes to the pressures of life with Patrick. 
</P>
<P>
"Support groups and outreach programs would help, but we're barely able to give 
the basic services," said Colleen Turner, a spokeswoman for the Assn. for 
Retarded Citizens' state chapter. "These families are isolated and alone." 
</P>
<P>
On some of the toughest days, Mary crawls into bed and buries herself in the 
sheets. She closes her eyes and tries to block everything out, but Patrick is 
still down the hall and his pain still comes first. 
</P>
<P>
So Mary pulls herself back together. 
</P>
<P>
"People say I'm a survivor, and I guess I am," she said. "But how do you 
survive this insanity? How do you watch your child drifting away?"

so. And Patrick seems to be regressing. Often he refuses to walk, and twice he 
has thrown himself down a flight of stairs. He spends hours listening to a tape

EXPERTS MAP STRATEGY TO CONTROL DEVELOPMENT IN AMAZON RAIN FOREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The chaotic development that is gobbling up the Amazon rain forest could 
finally be reined in with a new plan developed by officials of Amazon countries 
and leading scientists from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"That's some of the most encouraging news about the Amazon rain forest in 
recent years," said Thomas Lovejoy, a tropical ecologist at the Smithsonian 
Institution and an Amazon specialist. 
</P>
<P>
"It contrasts markedly with a year ago, when there was nothing to read about 
conservation in the Amazon, especially in Brazil, except bad news," Lovejoy 
said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty percent of the Amazon, the world's largest tropical rain forest, lies in 
Brazil, but the forest also covers parts of eight surrounding countries. 
</P>
<P>
Lovejoy was one of the organizers of an unusual workshop held in mid-January in 
Manaus, Brazil, a sprawling city of 1 million people in the heart of the 
Amazon. It was the center of Brazil's once-thriving rubber trade. 
</P>
<P>
The workshop, which brought together all the governments and scientists with 
interests in the rain forest, culminated with a plan to regulate development in 
up to 80% of the Amazon region. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that all parties concerned with the Amazon had met to 
pool their knowledge and agree on conservation priorities, the meeting's 
participants said. 
</P>
<P>
The plan devised at the workshop has no legal force. But it has broad 
government support and is likely to serve as a guide for national conservation 
programs, participants said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the areas to be preserved will be open to so-called multiple-use 
development, which preserves the forest while allowing tourism and the 
commercial exploitation of fibers, fruits and medicinal plants. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil, struggling with a teetering economy and pressured by developers and 
peasant farmers to clear the forest for cattle ranching or farming, has been 
ambivalent about the need to conserve the Amazon. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil participated in the Manaus workshop, however, and the setting of 
priorities was "all done with the blessing of Brazil," Lovejoy said. 
</P>
<P>
Tropical rain forests are giant, living warehouses for thousands of plant and 
animal species. The Amazon alone is home to 30% of the world's plant and animal 
species. 
</P>
<P>
One study found that a single square yard of leaf litter taken from the deep 
shadows of the Amazon floor contained 800 ants representing 50 species. 
</P>
<P>
Towering forest canopies up to 300 feet above the forest floor are home to 
countless birds and insects that live their lives without ever setting foot on 
the ground. One group of orchid species grows only near the top of the canopy; 
an entirely different collection of orchids grows at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
At the Manaus meeting, more than 100 specialists met in small groups to assess 
conservation priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Insect specialists compared data on such creatures as the stinging ant that 
defends acacia trees against predators. Mammalogists took inventory of the 
Amazon's screeching monkeys. Ichthyologists considered such oddities as the 
fish that eats fallen fruits and nuts on the Amazon River's banks when it 
overflows. Botanists, ornithologists and others did the same. 
</P>
<P>
Then they pooled their information and marked up maps of the Amazon. When they 
were done, the areas determined to be worth saving covered 70% to 80% of the 
Amazon. 
</P>
<P>
"The bulk of the Amazon is a biological priority; there's no way of getting 
around that," said Russell Mittermeier, president of Conservation International 
and an authority on endangered monkeys. 
</P>
<P>
Mittermeier emphasized, however, that the plan set realistic goals for the 
establishment of national parks and reserves, along with multiple-use areas 
where some development could occur. 
</P>
<P>
It is not realistic to build a fence around 70% to 80% of the Amazon, he said. 
Only the most critical areas should be placed off limits to development. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten (percent) to 20% of the entire Amazon should be in protected parks or 
preserves, ideally," he said. At present, 2% of the Amazon is protected. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil was not alone in its support for the conservation plan. 
</P>
<P>
"The results of this meeting are a major contribution towards the work that has 
got to be done," said Stanley Malone, director of the Suriname Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
Suriname was one of eight Amazon countries that agreed in 1978 to develop a 
unified approach to management of the Amazon, Malone said. What the officials 
lacked, however, was a guide to which areas most need protection. 
</P>
<P>
That determination has now been made, based on the number of different species 
a given area contains, and on how many of those species are unique to the area. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we'll have to see what develops from this," Mittermeier said. A new 
Brazilian president, Fernando Collor de Mello, was inaugurated this month, and 
with him comes a new Brazilian environmental policy. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the policy will include support for the Manaus plan is uncertain. "As 
always, everything depends on key individuals," Mittermeier said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm basically always optimistic," he said. "I feel sure that we can develop 
appropriate solutions, although it may take a lot of work."

ODD, BENT, ROAR ARE GOOD NORSE NAMES, BUT SCOTT AND RUSSELL ARE OUT; 
</P>
<P>
SCANDINAVIA: SURNAMES, MIDDLE NAMES AND FIRST NAMES RUN INTO MYRIAD RULES 
DESIGNED TO PREVENT CONFUSION AND PRESERVE CULTURE.

<TEXT>
<P>
Norwegians can name a son Odd, Bent, even Roar, but Scott and Russell are 
beyond the law. 
</P>
<P>
Danes need middle names to tell each other apart, since half the people share 
14 surnames. 
</P>
<P>
In Sweden, middle names are unusual. Swedes are allowed as many first names as 
they want, however, and some use two last names. 
</P>
<P>
Every baby must be registered, with name officially approved, in the highly 
regulated societies of Europe's far north. 
</P>
<P>
Names like Bent Worm, Roar Bull or Odd Ones sound fine to Scandinavians, but 
the rules bewilder some parents. 
</P>
<P>
Take Becky Carlsson, a 30-year-old American living in Sweden. She has tried for 
12 months to get her maiden name, Hincks, approved as a middle name for her 
14-month-old son, Samuel. 
</P>
<P>
"They wouldn't accept Hincks as a second first name, or a middle name," said 
Carlsson, who has appealed the case. 
</P>
<P>
Sam could be a Hincks if his mother had continued to use her maiden name; the 
law says a Hincks and a Carlsson may have a baby named Hincks Carlsson, but two 
Carlssons cannot. Hincks is forbidden as a first or second name because it is a 
surname. 
</P>
<P>
"All this regulation started because a lot of names were being casually used," 
said Anne Svanevik, a Norwegian name researcher. "Officials were trying to 
stabilize things so it would be easier to find people in files, for example." 
</P>
<P>
Scandinavians often adopted the name of a farm or region, which they might 
change like an address if they moved. 
</P>
<P>
They created new surnames by adding "sen" or "son" to the father's given name. 
A Danish Jens, son of Hans, became Jens Hansen. His son Per took the name 
Jensen, the grandson became Persen, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
Chaos reigned by the mid-1800s and governments insisted that everyone adopt a 
permanent family name. Iceland is an exception; patronymics persist among the 
island's 250,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
New rules brought forth lists of legal last names, reserved family names, 
surnames available to anyone and acceptable given names. 
</P>
<P>
Each year in Sweden, thousands of Johanssons, Anderssons and Svenssons ask to 
change their names, which are so common that mix-ups are inevitable. Each must 
apply to the Patent and Registry Board for permission. 
</P>
<P>
About 20,000 of Norway's 4.2 million people change family names each year. 
</P>
<P>
"Norway passed a forename law in 1923 because people started to use last names 
as first names, and to protect children from having names that sounded 
strange," Svanevik said. 
</P>
<P>
An 1828 decree inadvertently stripped Danes of a rich variety of informal 
surnames, leaving 70% with names ending in "sen," said Gillian Fellows-Jensen 
of Denmark's Institute of Names Research. 
</P>
<P>
"The government said everyone had to have a permanent last name," said 
Fellows-Jensen, who was allowed by a 1983 reform of the law to hyphenate her 
name. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't mean just the 'sen' names. It was up to the local vicar to record 
names. A lot of vicars weren't very imaginative and wrote down the easiest one: 
the patronym." 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Danes now have the same first and last names, creating an identity 
problem that can follow them to the grave. Tombstones are inscribed "Mr. 
Managing Director Jensen" and "Mr. Unskilled Worker Jensen" to distinguish the 
occupants. 
</P>
<P>
In Oslo, a city of 480,000 people, 50 of the 4,000 Hansens in the telephone 
book are named Hans and hints are provided, like Hans the surveyor, Hans the 
retired, Hans the bricklayer. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, Russell and some others are registered as surnames in Norway and cannot 
be used as given names. Immigrants are given leeway, however, and usually can 
register non-Nordic first names like Hussein or Carlos without problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I know a Norwegian family who wanted to name their baby Scott and were 
refused, while Scott was approved for another family with one British parent," 
Svanevik said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Swedish population registry, Thomas Erikson said: "We respect whatever 
name people had when they moved to Sweden. Their children born here have to 
abide by Swedish law." 
</P>
<P>
Erikson said Carlsson's difficulty arose because Hincks clearly is a surname. 
</P>
<P>
"If she could show that it was used anywhere as a first name it would probably 
be all right," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Carlsson even tried to smuggle the middle name into Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
"We went home" to Hartford, Conn., "and had him baptized Samuel Hincks 
Carlsson, then we filed to change his name here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
"In the eyes of the Swedish state, he's still Samuel Carlsson, but God knows 
he's Samuel Hincks Carlsson," said Sam's father, Mats.

TROUBLE FOR COCAINE BABIES LIKELY TO WORSEN WITH AGE

When Joshua arrived at New England Medical Center, senior nurse Sharon Hill 
could have held him in her hand. He was three months premature and weighed 2 
pounds. And because of cocaine, he was suffering. 
</P>
<P>
The cocaine addiction was his mother's, but Joshua still pays for it after 
three months in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Cocaine pushed him into the world so early and ill-equipped that he was 
immediately hooked up to a ventilator and feeding tubes and had four 
cardiac-monitor electrodes taped to his chest. 
</P>
<P>
Although babies with breathing tubes can't make any noise when they cry, Hill 
said: "Sometimes you can see an expression that they are crying." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, about 10% of the cocaine babies born in Massachusetts died. Some who 
survived suffered strokes or intestinal failure when cocaine constricted their 
tiny arteries, but most of their problems result from premature birth. 
</P>
<P>
Experts now are investigating the possibility that problems among 
"cocaine-exposed" babies might not show up until years later. 
</P>
<P>
Cocaine might damage the infants' central nervous systems, but it is difficult 
to study their long-term prospects because researchers find it hard to separate 
the effects of cocaine exposure in the womb from poor parenting, said Barry 
Zuckerman, director of development and behavioral pediatrics at Boston City 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what effect it has on the developing brain or how it may later 
affect behavior," Zuckerman said. 
</P>
<P>
A study by the National Assn. for Perinatal Addiction Research and Education 
has shown that it takes three months before cocaine babies weigh as much as 
drug-free infants and two years for head circumference, a measure of brain 
development, to match that of babies not exposed to cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing . . . is extreme prematurity, 10 weeks, 12 weeks, 15 
weeks," said Benjamin Sachs, chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Boston's 
Beth Israel Hospital. "A baby that's 12 weeks premature may remain in (the) 
hospital three months and cost $100,000. That's a serious public health 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
Babies born with cocaine in their systems may alternately be lethargic and 
overstimulated or given to inconsolable crying, Sachs said. 
</P>
<P>
The study showed that infants remained irritable for six to eight weeks, 
placing a heavy burden on drug-addicted mothers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're concerned that the mothers may get turned off by their babies," 
Zuckerman said. 
</P>
<P>
The critical question might be "to whom is this child born and what kind of 
mothering is going on in that environment" said Sachs, who argues that it 
illustrates the need for more treatment for female addicts. 
</P>
<P>
"There are very few places in Massachusetts where women who are addicted can 
get help, and there are long waiting lists," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Zuckerman described it as a pay now or pay later situation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're impressed by how hard the mothers work to stop taking drugs and be a 
good mother," he said. "We don't have enough drug-treatment programs for women. 
If you pay later, you spend the money and have a damaged baby."

A 3-block stretch of protesters left a memorial service early in the afternoon 
and headed down Columbus Avenue, scattering people bundled up in furs because 
of bitterly cold weather.

HIS DESK SOLD FOR $12 MILLION, BUT 'VAN GOGH OF MAHOGANY' DIED POOR

Financially speaking, when John Goddard died his shirt didn't quite meet his 
pants. 
</P>
<P>
On balance, that is, he was broke. Having 15 children may not have helped. Too 
bad. Just 204 years later, a desk almost certainly made by him has been sold 
for $11 million -- plus 10% commission, for a total of more than $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
John Goddard (1723-85) was a cabinetmaker. He was the unsung Vincent van Gogh 
of mahogany. It was die now, get rich later. Much later. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1760s Goddard thought, correctly, that he was making a handsome bookcase 
desk for John Nicholas Brown, a Providence merchant. Brown did not know that 
the desk would make tidal waves in the antiques market in June, 1989, when his 
descendant and namesake sold the family heirloom through a New York auction 
house. 
</P>
<P>
The highest bid of $12.1 million was quadruple the previous world record price 
paid for a single piece of furniture. That was $2.97 million, paid in 1988 for 
a Louis XVI table that once belonged to Marie Antoinette. 
</P>
<P>
Colonial cabinetmakers, even superstars such as Goddard, didn't die rich. Their 
customers did. The Goddards served them in death as in life, eking out a living 
between masterpieces by making coffins -- or hammer handles or cheap furniture 
for export to the Caribbean, whence came the expensive mahogany logs they used 
to make fine pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Goddard's home, one of many Colonial buildings in this seaport, still stands on 
2nd Street near Pine. So does his shop adjacent to the three-story, gabled 
house. It's about as big as a one-car garage -- one compact car, that is. 
</P>
<P>
John Alden, the Mayflower immigrant, was the first cabinetmaker in the 
Colonies. His product was crude as a broadax, rough-hewn for the ages. As the 
Colonies prospered, hardscrabble utility began surrendering to refinement. 
Quality furniture became a confirmation of status, gentility, wealth.

<P>
And wealth in the Colonies was concentrated at the seaports. Philadelphia, 
second-largest city in the British Empire, was the capital of cabinetmaking. 
Newport by the mid-1700s was home to 11,000 people. It had more than 50 rum 
distilleries and a growing class of entrepreneurs becoming rich in the 
triangular trade of rum, slaves and sugar cane. 
</P>
<P>
Newport also had a family of Quakers named Townsend and Goddard. Three 
generations of Townsends and Goddards intermarried both nuptially and 
vocationally, producing a line of some 20 cabinetmakers and a golden age of 
furniture -- wooden Parthenons for the drawing rooms of the rich who could 
afford the best and found it, providentially, within walking distance. 
</P>
<P>
John Goddard was born in Dartmouth, Mass., son of a shipwright, one of the 
crafts that gave rise to Colonial cabinetmaking. By age 20 he was master of the 
sloop Bashsheda, plying between Philadelphia and Newport. In 1746 he married 
Hannah, daughter of cabinetmaker Job Townsend. Goddard's brother, James, also 
married a daughter of Job's. The brothers began to learn "the art, trade and 
mystery" of cabinetmaking. 
</P>
<P>
The first quality furniture in America was either imported from Britain or 
copied from English books of design such as Thomas Chippendale's "The Gentleman 
and Cabinetmaker's Director," published in 1754. Gradually, each of the 
American port cities evolved its own furniture style. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia's furniture the most elegant and richly carved. New York was an 
unadorned and "put it there" kind of town, and so was its furniture. Boston, 
already in decline as a seaport, produced a frugal style that resisted change 
as well as ostentation. And in Newport, which had 67 cabinetmakers during the 
century, the best, remember, were Quakers. 
</P>
<P>
The tools of their trade were almost prehistoric by today's standards. 
</P>
<P>
"All you needed were sharp planes, saws and chisels," said Robert Emlen, the 
curator who shipped Goddard's desk off the auction block. "They finished wood 
with scrapers, pumice and rottenstone or sharkskin -- but for that you had to 
find a shark. 
</P>
<P>
"Screws were expensive, and they were only used where absolutely needed," said 
Jeff Moore, who restores furniture for the Newport Preservation Society. "They 
used (animal) hide glue -- it's still holding. Blacksmiths made files, and they 
had molding planes and jointer planes and rifflers and sandpaper made out of 
crushed glass glued to paper. They weren't fools. They did it the easy way 
wherever they could." 
</P>
<P>
Humble woods were used where they wouldn't be seen, but the visible mahogany 
surfaces were flawlessly carved and dovetailed. 
</P>
<P>
Future cabinetmakers apprenticed for seven years, beginning at about age 13. 
After the dog work they became journeymen, traveling from job to job until they 
acquired enough rifflers and planes and sharks to open their own shops. 
Roughly, it took a journeyman eight days to make a table four feet long, six 
days to make a plain desk, 22 days for a highboy. 
</P>
<P>
Each city's style became subtly distinctive, an aid to future antiquarians 
since few pieces in the Chippendale era were signed. It was an anonymous 
business presumably because everybody knew who made what. Ball-and-claw feet 
were squared off at the bottom in New York, carved with pronounced knuckles in 
Philadelphia, lacked webbing between the talons in Newport. 
</P>
<P>
The Townsends and Goddards became known for their block-front furniture, with 
convex panels surrounding a third, concave panel and topped with a carved 
scallop shell, a common adornment, along with stars and radiating suns. It was 
a style that came to Newport from Italy by way of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Customarily, several craftsmen contributed to a block-front desk-bookcase: the 
lathe turner, the brass hardware maker and sometimes the carver. They would 
turn over their pieces to the cabinetmaker, who put them all together and got 
credit for the final product. So it was, presumably, with John Goddard's 
$12.1-million block-front desk, although he probably did the carving himself. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, no one is positive that Goddard made the desk. It is unsigned. "It's 
a reasonably good bet he made it, but we're not sure," Emlen said. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the distinctive touches on the piece, there are letters between 
Goddard and the Browns, who were of such importance and wealth that the College 
of Rhode Island was renamed Brown University in their honor. A 1763 letter to 
Goddard from Nicholas's brother, Moses, accuses the cabinetmaker of falling 
behind on an order and of working for another client when he should have been 
finishing Brown's furniture. 
</P>
<P>
Goddard the Quaker wrote back, hat in hand, that Moses should understand he had 
"to keep my boys Imploy'd . . . so I hope thou will think better of thy 
friend." He went on to describe a "Chest on Chest of Drawers and a Sweld 
(block) front which are costly and ornamental." 
</P>
<P>
Such a costly and ornamental desk-bookcase, now known as a secretary, might 
have sold then for 400 pounds. Nicholas, when he died in 1791, left a "bookcase 
with books" -- probably the very same one -- valued at 95 pounds in the widely 
fluctuating currency of that day. That was a high value for the times. 
</P>
<P>
There were 10 such desks made. One was lost in a fire; eight are in museums. 
The Brown desk had remained in the family from the day it was made, in about 
1767. After it was moved to the ultimate Brown family home in Providence in 
1814, it left there only twice, both times on loan for an exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
When he died, Goddard left "all my stock of mahogany" to his sons "to be worked 
up for the support of my wife and minor children." A year later, the Newport 
Mercury carried a sad epitaph, a notice that Goddard, "represented insolvent . 
. . all those indebted to said estate are desired to make immediate Payment . . 
." And so he faded into obscurity. 
</P>
<P>
The desk, meanwhile, was passed down through the eldest Brown son and gradually 
acquired the status of a "family icon," said Emlen, "a pinnacle of the family 
fortune. The Browns had the means to change the interior decor every 20 or so 
years, but the desk always remained." 
</P>
<P>
For years it had received little more notice than Goddard himself. Then in 
1913, it was mentioned in Vincent Lockwood's "Colonial Furniture in America." 
Goddard was similarly rediscovered, as were his town and his works. 
</P>
<P>
Newport had been invaded by the British during the Revolution and 400 homes 
were torn down for firewood. In the aftermath the town languished, its motto 
being "Eat it up, make it do, do without." In this environment, old furniture 
stayed at home and out of antique shops. As the mahogany took on the 
blood-maroon, glowing patina of age, the cabinetmakers of Newport were recalled 
from their graves as "craftsmen (whose) output in quality, design and 
originality (was) unsurpassed by any other urban or rural setting throughout 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
The Goddard desk, almost 10 feet high, rose above the finicky, precious details 
in the auction house catalogue: "molded scroll pediment . . . fluted urn flame 
finials . . . stop-fluted quarter columns . . . shell-covered prospect door . . 
. scroll-carved bracket foot . . . ."

KIDNAPPINGS. DRUGS. VIOLENCE. DEATH. IN L. A. NEIGHBORHOODS DOMINATED BY GANGS, 
THE INVISIBLE VICTIMS ARE CHILDREN. A WHOLE GENERATION OF TRAUMATIZED 
YOUNGSTERS IS LEARNING HOW TO DODGE BULLETS AND SURVIVE ON THE STREETS. BUT NOT 
ALL WOUNDS CAN BE SEEN, NOR DO THEY HEAL. WHAT KIND OF ADULTS WILL THEY BECOME?

<TEXT>
<P>
Lucinda Green seems like a made-to-order little girl. A bubbly 8-year-old, she 
wears her hair in sprouts of brightly ribboned braids and sports a pink sweat 
shirt emblazoned with a wide-eyed pussycat. 
</P>
<P>
As a third-grader at 97th Street School in South-Central Los Angeles, she likes 
to jump rope and read stories about a high-flying squirrel and a little boy who 
discovers the world hand-in-hand with his grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
But when she is asked about gang violence, the illusion of childhood innocence 
bursts as abruptly as a spray of bullets. Her small legs paddle the air from 
the height of an adult-sized chair and her braids bob chaotically as she 
recounts, incident after incident, the terrors that are common to her life. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid that someone will snatch me," she says. "So when I hear something I 
run as fast as I can. Like today (walking to school) I heard something and I 
dropped my book, and when I got to the corner I looked around and I see nobody. 
So I ran back and got my book. 
</P>
<P>
"Then there was a car coming, so I ran and hid behind that other car. The car 
went by. It was a gang-banger. He had a red rag on his window, so I thought he 
was going to shoot." 
</P>
<P>
With a gulp of air, she races on: "Friday something strange happened. Me and my 
brothers, we were going to the store and this man said do we want to smoke. He 
had his pants all sagging down and a hair band on his head. Me and my brothers 
we ran. I almost fell. I was real scared." 
</P>
<P>
But it was the gunfire on New Year's Eve that frightened her the most: "I was 
so scared. It sounded like somebody was at our door. It was going boruge! 
boruge! boruge! I went in my grandfather's room and I asked him can I sleep in 
his room. 
</P>
<P>
"Gunshots were just popping off. I didn't even get no sleep that night. I just 
stayed in the house the next day. I thought it was still going to be some 
shooting." 
</P>
<P>
For psychologists, social workers and educators, Lucinda's stories compose a 
familiar litany of a young child's experiences on Los Angeles' inner-city 
streets. Fueled by traffic in crack cocaine, gang violence has transformed 
routinely unsafe neighborhoods into urban war zones. In South-Central and East 
Los Angeles, where 134,100 children attend public elementary schools, the Los 
Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
reported more than 4,000 gang-related crimes and 156 homicides during 1989. 
</P>
<P>
For many children in these violence-riddled neighborhoods, outings to parks, 
playgrounds, libraries and movies are risky and rare, and even walking to 
school can be dangerous. They learn to hit the ground at the sound of gunfire 
and which gangs wear which colors. Firearms and knives, rendered with uncanny 
accuracy, turn up in their classroom drawings, and during their 
elementary-school years many children witness bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
A patchwork of school, community and law-enforcement programs teach children 
defense strategies against gangs and drugs and help them develop self-esteem, 
but officials say current funding and personnel do not come close to addressing 
the problem. They also point out that responsibility for the youngsters' safety 
ultimately lies with their parents -- a task families are not always able to 
fulfill. 
</P>
<P>
Allowed to slip through the system's cracks, many inner-city children are left 
largely to learn survival skills on their own. With insufficient protection and 
guidance, a generation of inner-city youngsters are growing into adolescents 
who are street-wise, hardened and, in some cases, may be psychologically 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like living in Vietnam in the '60s," psychologist Sandra Cox says of 
their environment. A staff member of the Los Angeles Unified School District's 
School Mental Health Center clinic in South-Central Los Angeles, she adds, "The 
children realize this is a battle zone." 
</P>
<P>
At 102nd Street School, the nurse, Gladys Cormier, tells of children who sleep 
fully dressed on bare floors because they are afraid to go upstairs to bed. In 
shooting sprees, the children know, bullets are fired into the air, making 
their bedrooms places of danger. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like they're not little kids anymore," she says. "I cry every day for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
At the Westminster Neighborhood Assn., a community center in Watts that 
operates the Creative Child Project to help troubled children after school, 
10-year-old Luis Hernandez next takes the seat to talk about his daily life. 
Luis (whose name, like those of the other children, has been changed to protect 
his privacy) is a quiet fifth-grader at 102nd Street School who sucks his thumb 
and answers questions with a "yeah" or "unh-uh." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the violence that troubles him, however, he becomes talkative and 
animated. While standing in front of his house early one evening, waiting for 
his mother to open the door, he watched gang members drive up, jump out of 
their car, attack and shoot an elderly man. 
</P>
<P>
On a Saturday, as Luis was leaving his home to play football, a group of young 
men jumped another group in front of his house, robbed them and ran away 
through the neighbors' yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I just went back in. I went back to sleep." But even sleep is not a certain 
escape from violence. "I dream they are trying to go after me and kill me," 
Luis says. 
</P>
<P>
According to Sharon Robinson, who has worked as a supervisor and an educational 
psychologist in the L.A. school district, young children cope with the presence 
of violence by taking one of two defensive routes: They emulate aggressive gang 
behavior or they retreat from it, often refusing to go out to play or go to 
school. 
</P>
<P>
In both cases, the motivation is fear -- fear of gangs, of their classmates, 
even of police. 
</P>
<P>
"You see it if you ask them to do a drawing," says Robinson. "They might do a 
drawing of a policeman putting a gun to a gang member's head." 
</P>
<P>
In adolescence, perceptions of society become further confused. "Gang members 
are big shots, and the children want that identity," says Robinson. But, she 
stresses, "many of them act like they belong to gangs because they think it's 
cool and tough, when really they have none of this violent behavior in them." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Quinton James, a child psychiatrist with the School Mental Health Center 
and with the Centinela Child Guidance Clinic, sees many signs of stress, 
ranging from anxiety-induced headaches and stomachaches to a change in goals 
and misperceptions of reality. 
</P>
<P>
"They get to the point where they tend to distort the environment and say 
everything is fine when it's not," he says of his patients, who are as young as 
5 years old. "But if the neighborhood is very unsafe, you've got to somehow 
rationalize to the point that you feel it's safe to go out there." 
</P>
<P>
When James asks the youngsters what they imagine themselves doing when they are 
18 years old, "They say, 'I don't think about it.' They don't give thought to 
their future." With no sense of direction, he says, they are susceptible to 
psychiatric illnesses and poor adjustment to society, as well as to 
drug-addiction, alcoholism and a life of crime. 
</P>
<P>
When Horatio Prichard was in the third grade, Westminster personnel say he was 
"a living terror," a bellicose child who bullied his classmates. "I used to 
fight a lot," the 10-year-old says. On the playground at Compton Avenue School 
in South-Central Los Angeles, he says, "It's hard not to. 
</P>
<P>
"They call your mother names. They say she uses the pipe. They just be waiting 
to start you fighting." Encircled by watching classmates, Horatio declares, 
"You can't get out." 
</P>
<P>
Through Westminster and programs in his school, he has learned to walk away 
from the rough playground crowd, but the real test comes out on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"They run home and get their big brothers," he says of his classmates, 
explaining that to reach his house he must cut through a dangerous housing 
project. "That's when they be trying to jump you." 
</P>
<P>
On Fridays when he does not go to Westminster after school, Horatio takes his 
7-year-old brother in tow and confronts a nightmarishly long walkway in the 
project that for him is "like an alley. I don't walk, I run," he says. "I feel 
scared." 
</P>
<P>
To help the children who live in gang-infested areas, schools, police and 
community groups have developed programs that deal with self-esteem, child 
abuse, drugs and gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Youngsters are in danger from gang recruiting as early as the third grade, says 
V.G. McGuinses, who heads a state-funded anti-gang project, SEY YES (Save Every 
Youngster/Youth Enterprise Society). Gangs need young children as hit men, he 
explains. They scrawl their names on building walls preceded by li for little, 
which usually indicates they are in elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
McGuinses shows the children how to avoid gang overtures by projecting a 
neutral attitude. When a gang member accosts a child with "What's up, cuz," he 
warns, "You can't say it's none of your business. If you can't control your 
temper you'll have a short life." 
</P>
<P>
Children should not act tough. "If you get a kid out there who wants to be 
tough and bad, they'll say, 'Come on and join the gang, punk. Show us how bad 
you really are.' " 
</P>
<P>
McGuinses' most effective tactic to dissuade young children from joining gangs 
is to tell them their mothers and sisters could become victims of violence. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids need to understand that gangs aren't just some happy, big deal," he says, 
emphasizing that it is essential to reach them in their elementary years. "When 
kids start getting older they don't care about anything, especially if they're 
on crack." 
</P>
<P>
Cox, who conducts weekly self-esteem counseling at 97th Street School, says 
girls as young as 9 complain about harassment by Anglo "johns," who cruise 
South-Central streets looking for prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
She instructs the girls to walk in groups, never to get into a stranger's car, 
and if they are molested, to run and tell an adult. She also imbues all of her 
students with a sense of their African-American history and culture. "We try to 
make sure they understand that they are not rootless, that they do not live in 
isolation. When we can tie them to their ancestors and relatives they are less 
likely to commit antisocial acts." 
</P>
<P>
Existing programs can only do so much, however, and education officials 
recognize a need for expanded safety instruction and protection. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a hit-and-miss kind of thing," says 95th Street School principal Charles 
Proctor. "If something happens on the news, we start talking to the children 
about being careful around adult strangers. If a child is hit by a car, we 
might stress automobile safety. But there needs to be an organized, systematic 
effort that prepares children for the real world." 
</P>
<P>
However, more comprehensive programs on a districtwide basis would require 
resources that, educators say, are unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not fiscally well. And I don't know how we will recover, if ever," says 
assistant superintendent for the district's Office of Elementary Instruction, 
Barbara Smith, referring to Gov. George Deukmejian's proposed budget for fiscal 
1990-91, which leaves the Los Angeles district with a shortfall of $50 million 
in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
In February, Dr. Lilia (Lulu) Lopez, coordinator of instructional planning and 
development for the district's elementary schools, launched a pilot curriculum 
for the third and fourth grades to teach children everything from self-respect 
to letter-writing techniques to lobby politicians for more inner-city 
recreational facilities. But funds needed to train teachers and expand the 
program to all grades citywide have already been frozen. "One of my goals (with 
the pilot curriculum) was to bring the various school programs together so we 
don't leave holes," she says. "It's very frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, schools struggle to provide their students with safety as best they 
can. At 102nd Street, Principal Melba Coleman has gone to the City Council to 
obtain a guard to watch over her 1,200 students as they arrive and leave from 
school. According to city Department of Transportation guidelines, a guard is 
not needed because there is a traffic light a block away from the school. But, 
Coleman protests that her students live in projects across the street from the 
school. She notes wryly that previous principals have been trying to procure a 
guard for 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
The police also have programs that address the issue of safety. Officers take 
the DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) program to fifth-grade classes and 
make a half-hour presentation, called CASEY (Crime Awareness Safety Education 
for Youth) to children in kindergarten through the third grade to tell them how 
to dial 911 and watch out for strangers. 
</P>
<P>
Both programs are booked months in advance, and, says Sgt. Christopher West, 
the officer in charge of the LAPD's crime prevention unit, "we don't have 
remotely close to the resources" to establish more comprehensive programs. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he questions, "How do you teach somebody street smarts? It's too 
esoteric a subject to quantify and teach in the schools." 
</P>
<P>
The ideal place for children to learn about life is in the home, police and 
school officials agree, but children frequently do not obtain information 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"A lack of attention at home is a primary problem for many children," says 
Westminster director Grace Payne, who sees teen-age mothers, many of them 
single parents with only an elementary school education and an income from 
welfare. "They leave the children to grow up like weeds. Children aren't able 
to guide themselves and the parents aren't either." 
</P>
<P>
Even parents who work hard to protect their children find that the going is 
difficult. From Watts, many commute long distances to work and may not see 
their children for 12 hours a day. When they return at night they are worn out, 
Payne points out. Also, she says, "The mothers aren't going to tell the 
children these things (specifics on local gangs), because they don't know about 
them. It's the children who are out where they are exposed to them, not the 
parents." 
</P>
<P>
The solution for caring parents generally is to keep their children indoors. 
"If I have to, I'll keep them constantly in the house," says Diane Moore, who 
raises her 8- and 13-year-old sons in Watts. "They always ask, 'Mom, why we 
never go anywhere? We always stay in this boring house.' But I don't want to be 
out there in the environment." 
</P>
<P>
At Westminster, officials say the Creative Child Project is proof that positive 
approaches to helping children can have dramatic results. "Our solution is 
love, attention and listening," Payne says. In the afternoon hours, the danger 
zone for latch-key children, 50 8- to 12-year-olds from the neighborhood's 
schools are shepherded through academic lessons as well as instruction in 
social manners and habits by a teacher, three volunteer "foster grandparents" 
and a social worker. Children remain in the Creative Child Project for only two 
years, but since the program began in 1971, Payne says, 90% of her youngsters 
have finished high school, and 20% have graduated from community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Educators agree that given half a chance, children will respond positively to 
the support they are given. "Kids don't want to get hurt," says McGuinses. 
"They want to have fun and be happy and live in a safe environment." 
</P>
<P>
At Westminster, Lucinda says she wants to grow up to be a nurse "to try to save 
people from dying." Horatio wants to be President of the United States, and 
Luis wants to be a king. One of his royal edicts would prevent children from 
playing on the streets after dark. "The gangs could drive by and shoot them," 
he explains.

THE BEST DRESS COMPETITION;

FASHION: THE ACADEMY AWARDS MAKE FOR TV'S MOST GLAMOROUS NIGHT. DESIGNERS AND 
STORES WANT TO BE PART OF IT.

Times fashion pages.

SCENE 1: Rodeo Drive, 1986. An actress wanders through the Torie Steele 
boutiques, looking for a dress to wear to the Oscars. She admires a gown and 
asks a salesclerk whether the designer can make something special for her. He 
is delighted and sends an $8,000 dress -- made to her measurements -- from 
Europe. Meanwhile, the actress makes the same request in three other European 
boutiques on the street. She wears none of the four dresses on Oscar night, but 
keeps them all. After several trans-Atlantic shouting matches, her agent is 
presented with some whopping dress bills. 
</P>
<P>
SCENE 2: Backstage at the Oscars, 1987. After presenting the Best Director 
Oscar to Oliver Stone for "Platoon," Elizabeth Taylor heads through the barrage 
of cameras and reporters that all presenters and winners must face. Only Taylor 
isn't in the mood to talk. In fact, she looks as if she's going to charge right 
through the press gauntlet, leaving a trail of public relations people in her 
wake. Above the din, a reporter shouts, "Miss Taylor, who designed your dress?" 
Taylor stops dead in her tracks, whirls around in her hourglass dress of pink 
silk taffeta, smiles, and says: "Nolan Miller." Then she sweeps past the rest 
of the crowd without another word. 
</P>
<P>
SCENE 3: Mid-Oscar telecast, 1988. Two-time Oscar winner Olivia de Havilland is 
scheduled to present an award late in the show, and she's been sitting in the 
audience for several hours. Moments before she is scheduled to go on, costumer 
Ray Aghayan sees that her beautiful red chiffon dress is terribly wrinkled. He 
whisks De Havilland to a wardrobe room under the football stadium-sized 
auditorium, where a crew works with cartoon-like speed to press the dress while 
she's still in it. De Havilland, the consummate and dignified pro, is the only 
one in the room who's fully composed. 
</P>
<P>
Every year, Oscar lore is enriched by costume feats and fiascoes. But despite 
the tension, the cost, the drama, the politics and the scams, the Academy 
Awards make for the most glamorous night on television, and designers, 
costumers and stores all scramble to be part of it. 
</P>
<P>
It is such a plum that designer Gianfranco Ferre, for example, while in the 
midst of presenting his fall ready-to-wear collection for Christian Dior in 
Paris, stopped everything to make two dresses for Best Actress nominee Isabelle 
Adjani, who is scheduled to attend Monday night's ceremonies. One is a gold 
gown with embroidery; the other, a black dress with a white embroidered organza 
jacket. 
</P>
<P>
For the second year in a row, the Giorgio Armani boutique in Beverly Hills is 
dressing a small army of men and women who will participate in the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Armani himself has been quoted as saying he's dressing Best Actress nominees 
Michelle Pfeiffer, Jessica Tandy, Jessica Lange and presenter Jodie Foster. In 
addition, he's dressing Best Supporting Actress nominee Julia Roberts. But 
Armani and his staff are characteristically mum about the specifics, saying 
actresses often change their minds at the last minute. Indeed, Lange has 
arranged to view dresses from Fred Hayman Beverly Hills on Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
(It is ironic that Armani would be the front-runner in the Oscar fashion race 
because the Milanese designer is not known for his women's evening wear, but, 
rather, his clean, spare and neutral-colored daytime clothes.) 
</P>
<P>
Fred Hayman, a store that is in the midst of a nationwide perfume launch, has 
taken on the task of being the official fashion coordinator to the show for the 
second year. The store doesn't receive a fee, and Hayman does not believe that 
the cash registers will ring more frequently after the two-second credit 
flashes before the show's 1 billion viewers. "The residual effect is primarily 
image," he says. 
</P>
<P>
In general, stores call a nominated actress to ask whether she would like to 
buy or borrow a dress only if she is already a customer. But that tradition is 
starting to change. Hayman's store and the Armani boutique were the first 
retailers to jump in with both feet. Others, like Amen Wardy, are ready to try 
their luck. "I have a list of (nominees') names and I'm going to call them," 
says Wardy, who could pick up some of the notoriously last-minute Oscar 
business. 
</P>
<P>
In some instances, actresses will call up their favorite designers for advice. 
When Glenn Close agreed to be a presenter this year, she called Geoffrey Beene 
and they came up with a design for an outfit. Close was also savvy enough to 
check in with the Academy Awards producer, Gilbert Cates, to ask him about all 
the elements that might affect her wardrobe choice. "Glenn Close is hosting the 
London portion of the show at the Ritz and she and I had a long conversation," 
says Cates. "She asked all the right questions, like, 'Do I make an entrance?' 
and 'Are the shots head to toe?' We don't give actresses guidelines about what 
to wear, but we will discuss everything with them." 
</P>
<P>
Close will appear in a high-neck, long-sleeved black dress that Beene says was 
inspired not only by her needs but also by Close's next role as Queen Gertrude 
in Franco Zeffirelli's "Hamlet," which begins filming soon in London. 
</P>
<P>
In other cases, an actress might pick up a dress right out of a designer's 
private sample closet. Best Supporting Actress nominee Dianne Wiest went to 
Carolyne Roehm's New York design studio and fell in love with a long navy 
sheath. (The wool crepe dress has white georgette sleeves with a diamond spray 
design.) 
</P>
<P>
Typically, when an actress picks a sample, she usually just borrows the dress 
for the night. Donna Karan spokeswoman Christy Hood says Karan doesn't mind if 
actresses tuck, hem or do minor alterations on borrowed goods, but "cutting off 
a dress wouldn't be allowed." Hood sent two samples to Karan devotee and Oscar 
presenter Candice Bergen: a pink beaded dress and a gold Fortuny-pleated silk 
organza tunic and skirt. 
</P>
<P>
At Carolyne Roehm, public relations director Lisa Schiek says dresses are 
loaned and returned. "We never say, 'Keep it.' The dresses are too expensive." 
</P>
<P>
Schiek has called a nominee when she felt a particular dress would be perfect 
for her, "but it's not the norm," she says. "They usually call us and it's not 
unusual to get a call at the last minute." 
</P>
<P>
The jewelry firm Harry Winston, whose relationship with Hollywood stars dates 
to the days of Marilyn Monroe singing "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend," is 
also very liberal with Oscar night loans and will call stars to see whether 
they need anything. Actresses who have accepted the offer this year include 
Close, Wiest and presenter Geena Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Solicited and unsolicited goods can pile up, as some actresses find. In 1988, 
Best Supporting Actress nominee Anne Archer received four boxes of gowns, only 
one of which was actually requested. She ended up sending everything back and 
paying full price for a Vicky Tiel dress at Maxfield. 
</P>
<P>
Stores like Maxfield and Amen Wardy insist that actresses buy, not borrow. The 
Armani boutique loans clothes, but only from a special sample line, which is 
later returned to the designer and never sold. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of individual designers, Europeans will loan and give clothes, 
while Americans tend to loan or sell. 
</P>
<P>
"Valentino and lots of other European designers want American celebrities in 
their front rows at fashion shows and they want them wearing their clothes. 
They consider it a coup," says Valentino boutique manager Tom Bruno. "They love 
the Oscars because they're shown around the world and it's good publicity. 
American designers are more interested in the socialites like Pat Buckley and 
Nan Kempner wearing their clothes." 
</P>
<P>
Ray Aghayan, this year's Oscar telecast costume designer, says neither he nor 
longtime business associate Bob Mackie give dresses outright to actresses. 
</P>
<P>
Mackie customer Cher is very particular about her clothing arrangements with 
the designer and even with the briefest of outfits, will pick up the tab, says 
Aghayan. "She's very meticulous about that." 
</P>
<P>
Actors and actresses who perform on the show are clothed at the Academy's cost. 
Aghayan says there is no huge opening number Monday night, and that the musical 
numbers on the show will have "a quiet elegance, as opposed to last year." His 
dress for Diana Ross, who is singing on the telecast, is a long, bias-cut 
column of white crepe. He collaborated with the singer on details such as the 
neckline, the train and embroidery. 
</P>
<P>
For those presenters and nominees who borrow dresses from Fred Hayman's store, 
the arrangements are more complicated. As official Oscar fashion coordinator, 
the store's staff wrote to numerous designers asking them to ship over dresses 
to be loaned out. Hayman says he weeded out things that he considered too 
simple or not glamorous enough, then wrote to all the actresses who are 
nominated or presenting awards and invited them in. 
</P>
<P>
Daryl Hannah, an Academy Award presenter, took advantage of the Fred Hayman 
Oscar closet and selected a white, sequined, tea-length Vicky Tiel dress with a 
satin bow placed strategically on her derriere. 
</P>
<P>
Because this year's crop of actresses is spread out all over the globe, Fred 
Hayman's task of reaching everyone was difficult. Polaroid photographs had to 
be sent out to Best Actress nominee Pauline Collins because she wasn't due to 
arrive in Los Angeles until the last moment. (Collins, like Lange, is scheduled 
to view dresses from Fred Hayman on Monday morning.) A van of dresses went out 
to presenter Melanie Griffith on the set of her movie "Pacific Heights." 
Between takes she tried on clothes and narrowed them down to a black Vicky Tiel 
gown with lace trim and an orange silk sheath with a matching beaded jacket by 
Eva Chun. 
</P>
<P>
If an actress finds a dress in Hayman's stock, she would be allowed to borrow 
it and return it clean and undamaged. She signs a letter of indemnification 
that says she's responsible for the cost if it's soiled, lost, stolen or not 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the Oscar attendees are still wavering about what to wear. Anjelica 
Huston has picked out two dresses: a floor-length Bob Mackie frock, covered in 
sequins and bugle beads from Fred Hayman and a short, sleeveless, python 
printed silk dress by Eva Chun (a California-based designer) that she purchased 
from I. Magnin. 
</P>
<P>
Uncommitted dressers were still combing the racks last week. At mid-week Jane 
Fonda was seriously considering something from the Versace couture collection 
on Rodeo Drive but hadn't made her final choice.

EPCOT'S INTERNATIONAL PAVILIONS OPERATE AS TRUE GLOBAL VILLAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The international flavor of some of the exhibits at Walt Disney World's Epcot 
Center isn't just a fantasy. It's real. 
</P>
<P>
Since the center opened in October, 1982, more than 1,000 young people at a 
time from 10 nations have spent six months to a year staffing the 11 
spectacular cultural pavilions at this unique global exposition. 
</P>
<P>
The international pavilions -- representing Mexico, Norway, China, Germany, 
Italy, the United States, Japan, Morocco, France, the United Kingdom and Canada 
-- border a 41-acre lagoon. They are celebrations of the culture and customs of 
nations with the sites, sounds and tastes providing unique and authentic visual 
experiences of each land. 
</P>
<P>
At the French pavilion, for example, there is a replica of the Eiffel Tower. A 
replica of St. Mark's Square marks the Italian pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
There's a traditional Medina (native quarter) in the Moroccan pavilion, a Mayan 
pyramid at the entrance to the Mexican pavilion, a replica of Beijing's Temple 
of Heaven at the Chinese pavilion, an 8th-Century pagoda at the Japanese 
pavilion and Oktoberfest entertainment and a Biergarten at the German pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the men and women staffing the centers are university students or 
recent university graduates. They are recruited by Disney representatives who 
visit their homelands. 
</P>
<P>
The young people must be fluent in English, have pleasing personalities, poise, 
friendliness, politeness, the "Disney look" and the ability to communicate 
information about their countries to Epcot Center visitors. 
</P>
<P>
They work in the pavilion restaurants, the gift shops, at Circle Vision 
360-degree theaters, which feature films of China, France and Canada, at the 
cultural and traditional exhibition booths and at voyages through time 
attractions at the Mexico and Norway pavilions. 
</P>
<P>
They live together four to six men or women sharing apartments with roommates 
from different countries. 
</P>
<P>
"To be in America is so special for someone like me from the People's Republic 
of China," said a young woman working at the China Pavilion. "It opens my eyes 
to freedom, gives me an opportunity to experience, observe and investigate 
Western ways." 
</P>
<P>
China supplies 100 of the young internationals. Their status and the future 
participation of the Chinese government in the Disney program has been "up in 
the air" since the demonstrations at Tian An Men Square last June. The young 
Chinese arrived a month earlier for a one-year stay. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope our relationship with the Chinese government will continue as it has 
in the past as far as permitting citizens of the People's Republic to come here 
each year to work at the China Pavilion," Leonora McGugan, manager of the Epcot 
Center Cultural Affairs Department, said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting to know people from all over the world. I share an apartment with 
a Norwegian, French and American girl. We take turns cooking. I never met a 
Norwegian before. The Norwegian girl never met a Mexican before," said Trinette 
Lara, a 23-year-old from Puebla, Mexico, who is taking a year off from the 
University of the Americas in Cholula Mexico, and has been here eight months. 
She sells Mexican ceramics, clothing and jewelry at the Mexico Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
At the France Pavilion, Catherine Cheze, 22, is a hostess at the "Impressions 
de France" theater. 
</P>
<P>
Cheze is from Guadeloupe. 
</P>
<P>
"People always ask me where in France is Guadeloupe?" Cheze said. "I tell them 
it is a French island in the Caribbean." 
</P>
<P>
As she stooped beneath a pink parasol to say bonjour to Katie Storlien, 3, of 
Cottage Grove, Minn., Cheze noted that she wants to become a flight attendant 
for Air France. She called the Epcot Center job "a great opportunity . . . I 
meet people from everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
At the Moroccan pavilion, Abel Jabbar, 22, from Taroudant, Morocco, told tales 
about his homeland to Glenys Devlin and her son, Kris, 9, of Toowoomba, 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
"Where is Morocco?" Kris asked. 
</P>
<P>
Replied Jabbar: "Many people think it is in Europe. They get it confused with 
Monaco. It's in Africa." 
</P>
<P>
He explained that Morocco enjoys the longest unbroken treaty of any country in 
the world with the United States. "Morocco was the first country on earth to 
recognize the United States as a nation. I bet you didn't know that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sven Sandnes, 21, of Tromso, Norway, noted that soon after his discharge from 
the Norwegian Army, he became one of 3,000 Norwegians applying to fill 125 
openings at the Norway Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
He has been here seven months. Sven has a girlfriend at Walt Disney World, who 
is from Nebraska. That happens, too. Now he wants to enroll at Creighton 
University in Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Procter, 30, corporate sales manager for the Cumberland Hotel in London, 
recently returned on a visit to Epcot Center for the first time since he worked 
here as an international in 1984-85. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a wonderful year," he noted. "The experience helped immeasurably in my 
success in the business world. And while here I made friends with people from 
many countries. We still keep in touch. One friend was active in the Tian An 
Men Square demonstrations." 
</P>
<P>
For many of the young internationals, the Disney work is their first job and 
their first time away from home. Some get homesick and leave before their 
contract is up, forfeiting a paid flight back. 
</P>
<P>
They receive the same wages as other first-year Walt Disney World employees, 
$5.05 an hour. They pay $55-$65 weekly apartment rent in a special housing 
complex for the internationals at Epcot Center. It includes tennis and 
racquetball courts and swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
For Jabbar of Morocco, being in Florida means a year away from his parents, his 
seven brothers and three sisters. He was recruited from a university in 
Tangier. 
</P>
<P>
"Morocco is a country," he said. "America is a continent. I had no notion of 
how big the U. S. really is until I came here last October. My town is so small 
I can ride my bike from one end to the other in 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"To get to Epcot Center," he said, "I rode a bus for 12 hours to Casablanca, 
then flew to New York and on to Orlando, Fla. There is no place anywhere in the 
world like this. I am honored to be here." 
</P>
<P>
Will there be other nations represented at Epcot Center in the future? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," said McGugan of the Epcot Center. "There are plans for more. Norway was 
added since the international pavilions opened in 1982. The U.S.S.R. and 
Switzerland are now negotiating to establish pavilions here." 
</P>

ZAN THOMPSON: FIGHTING A RUN-DOWN FEELING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several times since I have moved to La Quinta, I have left a car door open, 
hence the interior light on, and gone out the next morning to a dead battery. 
This is because the door from the garage into the house closes smartly against 
the back of my Achilles' tendon, causing me to run to a chair and sit down and 
grasp my ankle. This makes me forget that I have left the car door ajar. Thus, 
the battery sinks slowly into silence. 
</P>
<P>
But my friend Walt Wagner put one of those trip things at the bottom of the 
door, which flops down and grips the floor, holding the door open. So I don't 
know what happened to the battery yesterday morning except that it is basically 
a Pasadena battery, and the sand and the heat have given it a poor attitude. 
</P>
<P>
I called the Automobile Club of Southern California and asked if they'd send 
someone to cope. I was all ready to go to a ladies' luncheon, which is 
something I don't usually do. 
</P>
<P>
This one, however, I wanted to attend because it was to include a daylong 
seminar by the respected and entertaining antique authority Gwen Znerold, and 
my hostess was a new friend. 
</P>
<P>
I showered, dressed, went to the car and heard that terrible silence that means 
the desert demons had struck again. 
</P>
<P>
After half an hour or so, I heard the heartening sound of a repair truck and I 
ran to greet its driver. He put those things that look like curling irons on my 
battery and pushed the other end of the cord into a connection at the end of 
his bumper. In a few minutes, he started the car. 
</P>
<P>
He told me somberly that my destination was not far enough away to charge the 
battery and that I should have it checked and maybe buy a new one as the 
expired one was the original and had outlived its expected life. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as he drove away, Jim, the handyman for Laguna de la Paz, appeared. A 
visit from Jim is like Easter Bunny and Santa Claus arriving at the same time. 
He can fix anything. 
</P>
<P>
For a number of weeks, I have had several annoyances about the house. Neither 
basin in the master bath would hold water. There was a furrow in the front lawn 
where some fun-loving workman had driven and my front-porch light was smashed. 
</P>
<P>
I certainly did not want to send Jim away, so I welcomed him and he fixed 
everything but the porch light. 
</P>
<P>
By now, two hours had gone by and the ladies were at the designated country 
club learning about antique glass and I was just getting into the car. 
</P>
<P>
I went to Indio, the hard-working town farther down the valley, and found the 
service station from which the Auto Club man had been dispatched. 
</P>
<P>
After several false starts, I managed to get a man who would listen to my 
request to check my battery. He wheeled out a machine that looked like an 
old-time radio. I kept expecting him to look at me with wonder like Uncle 
Charlie, who used to say, "Shush. I think I got Denver." 
</P>
<P>
I had known from that moment when the Auto Club man said I would have to have 
the battery checked that I would be buying a new battery. 
</P>
<P>
After half an hour in the heat, I said, "Why don't you just give me a new 
battery?" 
</P>
<P>
With that, he took the curling irons off and put a new battery in for the 
customary $80.06. 
</P>
<P>
I arrived at the lecture just as they broke for lunch. So I can't tell you 
about the mysteries of antique glass. But I can tell you about dying and dead 
batteries. The new one is no-maintenance. So was the other one.

NO RIGHT TO WRITE BIOGRAPHIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With regards to Bob Sipchen's article on L. Ron Hubbard's biography, I have to 
disagree that one has a right to use the right of freedom of speech to invade 
another's privacy ("Who Is the Owner of the Written Word?" March 12). 
</P>
<P>
You see this in all quarters: the paparazzi that haunt the movie stars' every 
step, the tabloids that stoop to fictionalizing people's lives for a headline, 
unauthorized biographies that are intentionally slanted to excite sales. 
</P>
<P>
It goes on and on. Can anyone tell me what right a writer has that allows him 
to produce a biography of another's life without that person's consent and make 
money from the sale of the books? 
</P>
<P>
I don't care if no more biographies are written for the simple reason that they 
are not accurate. They can't be. The author wasn't there. He has to resort to 
other person's opinions of what happened. How distorted are those? How does the 
author know who is exaggerating? Who has an ax to grind? Recordings are 
probably accurate up to the point they are taken out of context. 
</P>
<P>
Who can second-guess someone's motives? The list goes on and on.

'DECLARATION' CAUSES OUTPOURING OF DEEPLY DIVIDED OPINIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gosh, your lesbian piece was really on key and wonderfully done. 
</P>
<P>
You also managed to cram into the back part of the article a bunch of good info 
on us male gays and the lesbian/gay situation in general. 
</P>
<P>
Truly, the "New Gays," as I tend to call the kids in their teens and 20s who 
are coming out these days (I'm 44), seem to come out more easily and into a 
space we made for them. As a result, their personalities look more 
straightforward because they have spent less time hiding from any part of life.

'DECLARATION' CAUSES OUTPOURING OF DEEPLY DIVIDED OPINIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "A Declaration" (March 14): On the front page of the View section, we are 
shown a couple in living color looking mistily into each other's eyes like 
Bogart and Bacall. But they are not Bogart and Bacall. 
</P>
<P>
They are two young girls who have chosen to be lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
My intent is not to criticize anyone for their choices. But I am critical of 
the manner in which The Times has presented the article. 
</P>
<P>
There is still, and always will be, a great majority of society that is not in 
agreement with homosexuality. I consider myself part of that majority, and my 
friends and acquaintances, both male and female, agree that the article is 
offensive. 
</P>
<P>
In my opinion, it is not in the interest of society to further any 
organizations that profess theories of separatism like the lesbian sorority 
mentioned in your paper. 
</P>
<P>
If valuable space is to be used in your newspaper, please let it serve the 
whole of society. Don't just write anything simply because it is modern or 
considered "chic."

'DECLARATION' CAUSES OUTPOURING OF DEEPLY DIVIDED OPINIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am appalled at what your paper thinks is news. The Times once again has shown 
its views as being non-traditional, liberal, immoral and biased. 
</P>
<P>
The article contains the story of a woman who was supposedly "born again," and 
after feeling sexual desires for another woman, rejects her faith and follows 
after her own lusts by giving into the lie that homosexuality is an acceptable 
alternative lifestyle.

THEY JUGGLE BUSINESS, FAMILY TIES AT JET SPEED 
</P>

Jackson Cheung, an old hand at trans-Pacific crossings, maneuvered deftly 
through a throng of Far East-bound travelers at Los Angeles International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
With his watch already set 16 hours ahead for his Hong Kong destination, Cheung 
confidently negotiated difficulties at the check-in counter. Then the Duarte 
businessman jostled past the bulging suitcases lugged by passengers making 
their first trips back to Asia in years. 
</P>
<P>
Cheung makes this journey of 7,266 miles as often as once a month, and he 
treats it as a trip across town. He is a spaceman. Or an acrobat, if you 
prefer. 
</P>
<P>
For Cheung and a growing number of other Asian business people in Southern 
California, corporate and family life straddle continents and seas. So much of 
their time is spent flying to and from the Far East that the oft-used 
colloquial Mandarin Chinese terms tai kung jen (spaceman) and kung chung fei 
jen (acrobat) are used to refer to them. 
</P>
<P>
These are frequent fliers with a difference, motivated by cultural background, 
political uncertainty, family ties and educational draws, as well as by 
money-making opportunities. Some maintain homes on both sides of the Pacific, 
some make the round trip in as little as three or four days and all, at times, 
risk occasional alienation from their spouses. 
</P>
<P>
Flights that last 13 to 15 hours are routine for these so-called spacemen -- 
and for the smaller number of spacewomen who belong to the high-flying clique 
as well. Crushing jet lag does not deter them from skipping across eight time 
zones and the international date line in a single trip. 
</P>
<P>
Like many of the frequent travelers, Wai-Jen Jeffries, 52, of San Marino has a 
complicated story to explain her trips to Asia. The tale has as much to do with 
emotional connections and the march of history as it does with commerce. 
</P>
<P>
She flies to Taiwan, Hong Kong and China up to eight times a year to conduct 
business related to her three factories in China's Fujian province. A resident 
of the United States since 1968, Jeffries still remembers the late 1940s, the 
post-World War II years when she and her family fled the Communists, leaving 
behind a sister and grandmother in their tiny, mountain-ringed valley village. 
Decades later, Jeffries found out her sister still lives in the village, 
although her despondent grandmother had hanged herself. 
</P>
<P>
Six years ago, she opened a rice bag factory in that village with the help of 
the Chinese government. Today, when she travels there to keep an eye on things, 
she also visits her long-lost sister. 
</P>
<P>
There are emotional tugs from this side of the ocean as well. 
</P>
<P>
"When I leave, my son Patrick says: 'You have to go again?' And sometimes 
friends try to call me and get upset because they can't reach me," she said. 
But, she said, her trips also fulfill a lifelong desire. "I always dreamed of 
going back and helping my village." 
</P>
<P>
Cheung also juggles work responsibilities and family needs in his travels. At 
34, Cheung owns an industrial metals firm with offices in Irwindale and Hong 
Kong. He has a house in Duarte, and his wife and two children still live in the 
British colony. Cheung endures the arduous travel schedule as a way to hedge 
his bets in case he has to settle here permanently with his family in 1997, 
when Hong Kong reverts from British to Beijing rule. 
</P>
<P>
"If there aren't too many changes in Hong Kong, then we won't move," he said in 
Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
But he had little time to talk on a recent morning at LAX. He had to navigate 
his way to the China Airlines gate. 
</P>
<P>
At the airline's check-in counter, customer service representatives told of 
another Chinese-speaking Southern California businessman who, in the span of 
three weeks, made three round trips to Asia -- logging the mileage equivalent 
of 1 1/2 times around the world. Then there was the man who traveled the 6,774 
miles from Taipei to Los Angeles, stayed less than two days, then flew back. 
</P>
<P>
"These usually are new immigrants who retain roots in Asia. But it's not just 
the cultural linkage. Either they are waiting for citizenship or (an 
immigration) green card. Or they feel homesick or whatever. That's partly why 
they make all those trips," said Francis Hong, a Monterey Park import-export 
businessman who travels five to six times yearly to the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called spacemen sometimes end up in David Ma's Monterey Park office. Ma 
has built a legal and immigration consulting business with branches in Hong 
Kong and Taipei by helping newcomers solve professional and personal problems. 
</P>
<P>
Observers of the trend say it is impossible to quantify how many such travelers 
live in Southern California but believe the numbers are increasing. "I know of 
20 to 30 of these people in Arcadia alone," Ma said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the Asian frequent travelers relocate their families to Southern 
California to enhance educational opportunities for their children, but they 
return to the Far East because they can make more money in Chinese-speaking 
markets. Ma offered an example of one of his clients: 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a $1-million house in Diamond Bar and a Mercedes. A $1-million house 
in Taiwan and a Mercedes. He just made $100,000 playing the stock market in no 
time, a couple of days, in Taipei. Over here, because of his language problems, 
it's harder for him. So he flies back and forth." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Huang, a self-described spaceman from Orange County who the other day 
waited at LAX to pick up a friend arriving from Taipei, summed up the 
lifestyle's qualifications: "First, you need a good bank account. Second, you 
need an understanding wife. Or, either, third, you need a good lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
Family and marital discord can be a problem, confirmed Gladys Lee, executive 
director of the Rosemead-based Asian Pacific Family Center, one of Southern 
California's few counseling services catering strictly to an Asian clientele. 
</P>
<P>
Extramarital affairs sometimes result, she said, and children feel the 
pressure, too. She cited a case of a family in which the father moved his wife 
and children to Southern California but traveled to Taiwan often and spent most 
of his time there. The mother, who spoke little English, eventually fell apart 
emotionally. 
</P>
<P>
"The pressure is on the spouse who is here," said Loretta Huang, 47, of 
Monterey Park. "It is a demanding job, rearing the children right so they can 
become part of the mainstream of America and bridging the relationship between 
the father and the children." 
</P>
<P>
Huang knows what it's like to be that spouse. 
</P>
<P>
An administrator in the Alhambra School District, she came to Los Angeles 10 
years ago with no job and two young children. She and her husband decided that 
she would establish the beachhead of their new American life and that he, a 
historian, would do the traveling. He is still flying back and forth. Since 
December, he has made three Taipei-Los Angeles round trips. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to make extra efforts," she said, visibly moved as she spoke. "We came 
to a point to say: How much can we take of this separation?" 
</P>
<P>
Their daughter, Grace, a UCLA freshman, said the long separations from her 
father have been hard. "He missed a lot of the big events in my life." He was 
not there, she said, to see her off on prom night or to go with her to the Girl 
Scout father-daughter camp-out. "But he is a good father when he is here." 
</P>
<P>
Peter Chan, who moved to Monterey Park from Taipei in the early 1980s, and 
until recently made 10 trips a year to the Far East, said he keeps in close 
touch with his family back in the United States to ensure all is well while he 
is gone. "I make a phone call or a fax home every day. . . . Otherwise, I'm 
going to be in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Chan, 43, who now lives in Bradbury, is head of a men's clothing manufacturing 
firm based in the City of Industry, with plants in Taiwan, Macao and Hong Kong. 
"The more I travel now, I can't stand it. Check in. Check out. Immigration. 
Customs. Taxis. Half the time you're traveling, you're not even on an 
airplane." 
</P>
<P>
He has cut back the travel to about seven trips a year. Even so, he said, his 
wife still tells him: "I'm married to a 20th Century-sailor."

INVESTIGATORS ARE HOT ON THE TRAIL OF A PALM TREE PYROMANIAC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a clear night in the San Fernando Valley. From Fire Station 73 on Reseda 
Boulevard the street lights form a bright, straight line that tapers off into 
the hills to the north. It is warm out and there is not much of a breeze. But 
Bill Cass and Glen Lucero wear light jackets over their black T-shirts anyway 
-- to hide the guns holstered at their sides. 
</P>
<P>
Cass tests the undercover car's portable emergency light; the red strobe 
flashes across his face. He tunes the portable radio. The car pulls away from 
the fire station and into the evening traffic. Cass cracks a window and samples 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
"Good night for a fire," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Cass and Lucero are Los Angeles Fire Department arson investigators. But 
tonight they are not going to dig through charred debris, trace the spread 
pattern of a fire, or collect ash samples to be tested by a gas chromatograph 
for fire accelerants. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight they are off the normal track. They are chasing a phantom. They will 
patrol the heart of the West Valley, on the watch for a pyromaniac who has 
puzzled them for nearly half a year. 
</P>
<P>
Since Oct. 1, 110 related arson fires have been counted in the 
Reseda-Northridge-Canoga Park area. In each case, trash or trees were set 
ablaze. Often, it was palm trees that got torched. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few times have sparks carried on the wind and caused minor damage to 
nearby structures or cars. But the sheer number of related fires is great. It's 
the most in Los Angeles that any city arson investigator can remember. 
</P>
<P>
On the pyromaniac watch, Cass and Lucero, behind the wheel, begin to weave 
their way through the dark neighborhood streets where the arsonist has struck 
so often. They watch for anything or anyone suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
Battalion Chief William Burmester, who held a briefing at Station 73 before the 
recent night's patrol started, said the fear is that the suspect might move 
from small targets to structures where lives would be threatened. 
</P>
<P>
"There is always a danger, even with a guy like this who is not setting large 
fires," Burmester said. 
</P>
<P>
The unmarked car, Unit A-3, cruises into Canoga Park. So far, it is quiet. 
</P>
<P>
Unit A-3 passes a stand of palm trees on Oso Avenue that the arsonist hit a 
week earlier. The fronds atop the stark, charred trunks point skyward like 
black spears. The smell of smoke is still in the air. 
</P>
<P>
"We came awful close last week," Cass says. "We had a car go by here, then 30 
seconds later these trees were set. One minute the other way and we might have 
caught him. It has been that frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the 110 fires included in this investigation were the work of one 
person. A 16-year-old Reseda boy with emotional problems was arrested Jan. 23 
after admitting he set six of the fires, copying the original arsonist's 
pattern of targeting trees and trash. 
</P>
<P>
There could be other copycats, but for the most part investigators believe the 
fires are being set by one person or, perhaps, two working together. Often 
several fires are started on a single night. Then as long as two weeks go by 
without a blaze. 
</P>
<P>
The theory that two arsonists may be working together -- one a fire starter, 
the other a driver -- is based on the mobility needed to have set the fires. 
</P>
<P>
"The fires are set so quickly," Lucero says. "It could be one guy lighting them 
and somebody else doing the driving." 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the fires have been concentrated in Reseda and adjacent 
areas and generally occur in the early evenings. But no specific pattern or 
motive has emerged to help investigators identify a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"It is almost completely random as far as the locations go," Cass says. 
"Recently, he's been more interested in trees than trash. We don't know what 
that means." 
</P>
<P>
Even more baffling is the question of why. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators say the case is an enigma. Unlike most arsonists, the 
fire-starter here doesn't stay around to view his blazes. Quickly he moves on 
to set other fires -- sometimes as many as 12 a night. "All pyros don't stand 
around and watch," says Lucero. "This one doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have worked for months to determine a motive for the fires but 
have come up with nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Cass, the senior investigator assigned to the case, has interviewed formerly 
convicted arsonists who now live in the area; checked out disgruntled 
firefighters and police officers and unsuccessful applicants for those jobs; 
even studied graffiti found near some of the fires, thinking that the arsons 
were possibly part of a gang initiation rite. 
</P>
<P>
"We've kicked a lot of rocks over and haven't found anything," Cass says. 
"There is no rhyme or reason to this. We're getting burned out." 
</P>
<P>
"No pun intended," adds Lucero. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the arson patrols, investigators believe that it may take a lucky break 
to solve this mystery: the arsonist will slip up or somebody will get a good 
look at him or his license plate number. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Department officials have gone to homeowners' meetings and put tipster 
notices in shop windows throughout the area. A reward of up to $1,000 is 
offered for information leading to an arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"We want people to be aware that he's out there," Burmester said. "We need them 
to be on the lookout." 
</P>
<P>
It's 9:30 p.m. and not a single fire call, arson or otherwise, has come from 
the area the arson units are patrolling. On the nights the arsonist has struck, 
he has never started later than this. So Cass decides to end the surveillance 
and bring the other units back to Station 73. 
</P>
<P>
The night is a standoff. No fires, no arrest. But it doesn't sit well with 
Cass. He credits the arsonist with being one of the toughest opponents he has 
faced in 13 years as an arson investigator. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy is pretty bold," he says. "I'm sensing we are into a cat-and-mouse 
game." 
</P>
<P>
But how long the game will last, and who is playing which part, isn't always 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like he's yanking our chain a little," Cass says, the frustration 
showing in his voice. "He's got to know we are out here. Is he watching us? Who 
knows?"

MORNING BRIEFING: 49ER OWNER WANTS TO KEEP COACH OUT OF TROUBLED WATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Sporting News reported that San Francisco 49er owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. 
bought a 23-foot fishing boat for Coach George Seifert. 
</P>
<P>
Said 49er Vice President Carmen Policy: "The fishing boat George has been using 
is 27 years old, it's small and it has capsized several times and almost sank 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Eddie wants to make sure George is around to coach a few more years." 
</P>
<P>
Add 49ers: Said New Orleans President Jim Finks of former Saint defensive back 
Dave Waymer, signed by the 49ers to a three-year, $2-million contract: "I don't 
think -- in fact, I know -- that he can't play three years. The guy's a 10-year 
guy who really didn't play that well last year as a safety. He's lost his 
speed. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Ten men have hit 50 or more home runs in a season. How many can 
you name? 
</P>
<P>
Today's question: Will Charles Barkley make Julius Erving eat his words? The 
Doc stated recently that he wasn't a fan of his former Philadelphia teammate 
and explained: "I had trouble figuring out his style and adjusting to it. You 
need a good leader to reach the pinnacle of success. That has yet to come and I 
don't see any evidence that it will." 
</P>
<P>
Add Barkley: Said Washington Bullet Coach Wes Unseld, claiming the officials 
let Barkley get away with too much: "He just ducks his head and bowls people 
over. He barrels right over them and nothing is called." 
</P>
<P>
Said Barkley: "Wes should know. He's my role model. Everything I do under the 
basket I learned from him." 
</P>
<P>
No rush: Said Lee Trevino when told that Jack Nicklaus is planning to play in a 
limited number of senior tournaments: "That's great with me. For every 
tournament I play that Jack doesn't, tell Barbara I'll send her a dozen roses." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara is Mrs. Nicklaus.

</P>
<P>
On the Caribbean cruise -- are you ready? -- there will be "special appearances 
by Morganna the Kissing Bandit." 
</P>
<P>
Blockhead?: Said Kelly Chase of the St. Louis Blues after a shouting match with 
Wayne Van Dorp of the Chicago Blackhawks in the penalty box: "I was trying to 
make friends, but he's a hard guy to talk to. I'm not fluent in 'cement.' "

EVEN PRIDE IS LOST IN 112-79 BEATING BY JAZZ; 
</P>
<P>
CLIPPERS: STILL STUCK ON 26 VICTORIES, LOS ANGELES IS BATTERED AT SPORTS ARENA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Something had to give, and Saturday night it was Clipper pride -- boosted by 
recent solid showings, albeit in losses, but now in need of mending. 
</P>
<P>
Complete reconstruction, maybe, after the way the Utah Jazz gave them the 
fold-spindle-and-mutilate treatment, 112-79, at the Sports Arena, the Clippers' 
second-worst loss of the season. 
</P>
<P>
This after saving face despite defeats at Denver, Utah and the Forum. Back 
home, though, the Clippers' heads were handed to them. 
</P>
<P>
"We had feelings that something like this would happen during this stretch," 
Clipper Coach Don Casey said. "But not at home." 
</P>
<P>
That's the confounding part, especially for a team that makes its best 
impressions at the Sports Arena and struggles on the road. Suddenly, it's like 
that pattern has changed. 
</P>
<P>
"It is confusing," forward Ken Norman said after the Clippers scored 11 points 
in the fourth quarter -- their fewest in a period this season -- and set 
another team low for points in a game. "We have played well on the road, even 
if we haven't been getting the results." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the Clippers were tired because of the tough stretch of schedule? 
</P>
<P>
"Me, personally, no," Norman said. "I can't speak for the other guys. But 
something is definitely wrong." 
</P>
<P>
There usually is when one player has more assists than your entire team, 20-16. 
John Stockton, yes, but one player. 
</P>
<P>
Karl Malone complemented Stockton's efforts with 31 points and 18 rebounds as 
the Jazz (50-19) set a franchise record with their 18th road victory. 
</P>
<P>
Benoit Benjamin had 20 points and 12 rebounds, both team highs, for the 
Clippers, who dropped to 26-43 and were swept in a season series for the first 
time by the New Orleans/Utah Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
In facing Denver, Utah and the Lakers in consecutive games, the Clippers didn't 
get a break with the schedule, which shouldn't be a surprise. The usual lineup 
these days is something like a playoff preview, with the Clippers, though not 
mathematically eliminated from postseason play, best suited for the role of 
spoiler. 
</P>
<P>
If they don't wilt first, at least. Though playing well on the recent 
three-game trip, the Clippers began the night stuck on 26 victories and losers 
of four in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to get to the 30-win mark even if it kills us," Casey said after 
Friday's loss to the Lakers at the Forum. "Or me. Whatever comes first." 
</P>
<P>
Casey smiled, but the immediate future does not hold much promise. The Clippers 
are in the midst of a streak of 14 games against 11 different opponents with a 
combined .563 winning percentage going into Saturday night's games. And that 
includes Minnesota (17-50) and Sacramento (21-46). 
</P>
<P>
This was the second time in four nights they'd played Utah, leaders of the 
Midwest Division and threatening the Lakers for the best record in the Western 
Conference. Wednesday at Salt Lake City, the Clippers stayed with the Jazz for 
three quarters before being dominated the final 12 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
In the rematch Saturday, it was much different, Utah waiting only until the 
second quarter to take control. 
</P>
<P>
The last six minutes settled that. The Clippers, down by 12 points in the first 
quarter, had climbed back to within 37-31. But after the teams traded baskets, 
the Jazz went on a 19-4 run the final 5:47 of the first half, making it 58-37 
at intermission. That included an 11-0 run the last 3:13. 
</P>
<P>
After shooting 58.8% the first quarter, the Clippers, who next face Minnesota 
before playing the Lakers again, converted only 31.6% the second period. They 
didn't score the for final 3 1/2 minutes and got just three baskets in the last 
9:10 of the half. 
</P>
<P>
Of Utah's 21-point halftime lead, 19 came off Clipper turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers couldn't make a run in the third quarter, not even after Mark 
Eaton, a big factor inside, was ejected with 10:39 remaining. The Jazz center, 
who had four points and four rebounds, was tossed by referee Earl Strom after 
arguing over his fourth foul, leaving the bench with a sarcastic bow. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Smith made one of the two free-throw attempts on the double technical. 
That cut the Utah advantage to 60-40. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers committed only six turnovers in the second half, but the damage 
was done. Whatever hope remained went out with a three-of-17 shooting 
performance in the fourth quarter.

THE SECRET OF EDWARDS' SUCCESS? IT'S IN THE BAG; 
</P>
<P>
GOLF: AFTER A 16-YEAR ASSOCIATION WITH TOM WATSON, HIGH-PROFILE CADDIE NOW 
KEEPS GREG NORMAN IN THE SWING. 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Suffice to say that the person who invented a touring pro's golf bag never 
actually had to carry one for a living. The oversized leather monsters weigh 
about 45 pounds each, clubs included. Lugging one around 18 holes -- a loop, as 
the caddies call it -- is like strapping an anvil across your right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Edwards made his first loop for a PGA pro in 1968 at age 13. He got the 
job because regular tour caddies weren't allowed on the Wethersfield (Conn.) 
Country Club course, then-site of the Greater Hartford Open. 
</P>
<P>
The pro's name was Dick Lotz, a so-so player from Hayward, Calif., who shot 
71-70-69-73. Those are nice numbers for a member-guest tournament, but won't 
get you a spot on many tour leader boards. 
</P>
<P>
Lotz left quietly that Sunday, but only after handing Edwards $60 for the 
week's work. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, $60 wouldn't clean Edwards' gold Rolex. 
</P>
<P>
Caddie to the superstars, that's Edwards, 35. Dick Lotz, meet Greg Norman -- 
Edwards' current employer. Norman is as sure a meal ticket as there is on the 
fickle and humbling PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
Before Norman, Edwards caddied 16 years for Tom Watson. 
</P>
<P>
The PGA doesn't issue earnings lists for caddies, nor are any of them in a 
hurry to disclose the size of their paychecks, but as a rule of thumb, a caddie 
averages $300-$400 a week in salary and gets 5% of his player's winnings. 
</P>
<P>
A victory usually earns a caddie a 10% chunk of the first-place check, which 
means that Edwards collected about $25,000 when Norman won the Doral Ryder Open 
in Miami several weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, none of this is written in stone. Some players are generous with 
their winnings, but others can squeeze the copper out of pennies. Although he 
wasn't displaying his W-2 form, Edwards said an accomplished caddie, teamed 
with an accomplished player, can expect to earn $100,000-$150,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
There are some caddies carrying clubs, Edwards included, who make more than 
some players swinging them. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-four seniors graduated from Marianapolis prep school in Thompson, Conn., 
in 1973. Thirty-three went to college. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards went to the Kemper Open to become a full-time caddie. 
</P>
<P>
Lotz arranged the whole thing. Edwards would carry David Graham's bag for the 
tournament and then see about a full-time job. Instead, he was dismissed after 
Friday's round when Graham's regular caddie showed up. 
</P>
<P>
"The caddie was trying to cut my throat," Edwards says. 
</P>
<P>
Graham even told Edwards to quit after that first tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"You're too nice a kid to do this full time," Graham said. "You don't want to 
do this. Go home and get an education." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards couldn't go home. For his graduation present, his parents had given him 
a one-way ticket from Hartford to Charlotte, N.C., where the Kemper was played. 
</P>
<P>
Desperate for steady work, Edwards later traveled to Missouri for the St. Louis 
Classic. He was sitting under a tree near the Norwood Hills clubhouse early in 
the week when another caddie motioned toward a young, freckle-faced golfer who 
had just left the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, Bruce, there's Tom Watson," the other caddie said. "Why don't you go talk 
to him?" 
</P>
<P>
To which Edwards remembers thinking, "Who's Tom Watson?" 
</P>
<P>
Edwards introduced himself and then asked the only question that mattered. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be out here awhile," he said. "Can I work for you?" 
</P>
<P>
"Well, we'll see how you do this week, and we'll take it from there," Watson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Watson, 23, and newly married, had never come close to winning a tour event. He 
had led the Hawaiian Open after 54 holes but faded on the final day. Edwards, 
17, and newly poor, didn't care. All he wanted was a steady bag and a chance. 
</P>
<P>
What he got was a legend-to-be. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Edwards has made about 2,000 loops, which means he has covered 
about 13,400,000 yards or 7,613 miles -- the equivalent of walking the 
California coastline more than nine times. Almost all those miles were with 
Watson at his side. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the beginning of a wonderful relationship," Edwards says. "Never in 
my wildest dreams did I think I would eventually work for a player who would 
become one of the greatest the game has ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
Watson won 32 tournaments, among them eight majors, during the next 16 years. 
And Edwards was there for every one. 
</P>
<P>
He watched as Watson won his first tournament, the 1974 Western Open. 
</P>
<P>
He stood nearby when Watson earned a fifth British Open championship at Royal 
Birkdale in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
He saw Watson slip on the green Masters jacket in 1977 and 1981. 
</P>
<P>
But the moment most cherished by Edwards occurred during the final day of the 
1982 U.S. Open at Pebble Beach, when Watson found his two-iron shot nestled in 
the rough just off the par-three, 17th green. He was tied with Jack Nicklaus, 
who had completed his final round. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards leaned the bag toward Watson, who pulled a sand wedge and then stepped 
back to consider the difficult chip. 
</P>
<P>
"C'mon, get it close," Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to get it close," Watson answered. "I'm going to hole it." 
</P>
<P>
Even Edwards, an optimist always, thought to himself, "Yeah, sure. Right." 
</P>
<P>
And then the improbable happened. Watson's chip landed gingerly on the fringe, 
bounced toward the hole and then dived into the cup for a birdie and 
ultimately, an Open championship. A shot for the ages. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards smiles at the memory. It is one story he never tires of telling. On 
that day, as they walked up the 18th fairway and toward victory, the leather 
monster seemed as light as a wand of cotton candy. 
</P>
<P>
Few caddies experience such moments. In a sense, they learn, just as a player 
does, what it takes to win on the tour. Edwards also can claim seniority 
rights. Of the 140 or so caddies who regularly trail the tour, only about 10 to 
15 have been making loops as long as Edwards. It explains why Norman actually 
recruited him, offering a job three times before luring him away from Watson in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
"You need loyalty, honesty, a guy who's on time, who's proud of his job, who 
respects his job and who respects the guy he works for," Norman says. "Bruce, 
to me, is one of the best and most professional caddies I've had. He's a very 
positive guy." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards agonized over the decision. When he reached Watson by phone shortly 
after a tournament he asked, "Would you be terribly upset if I made a switch?" 
</P>
<P>
Watson was speechless. He had told Edwards that if a better deal ever came 
along that he wouldn't stand in his way. But when the moment came, parting 
proved difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"The toughest thing I've ever had to do in my life," Edwards says. "It's a hard 
thing to walk away from somebody after 16 years. He was like the older brother 
I never had." 
</P>
<P>
But Watson was cutting back on his playing schedule, his children were in 
school and he was busy with golf course design. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards simply made a business decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I just felt like I had one more chance," he says. "If I had turned Greg down a 
third time, I probably wouldn't get another chance to carry his bag." 
</P>
<P>
Or to go through a week like the one he and Norman recently experienced at the 
Tournament Players Championship. Their finest moment, it wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday: Norman and Edwards re-acquaint themselves with an occasional friend -- 
the TPC course. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards arrives at the TPC at 10:30 a.m. Norman, no early riser, is expected 
between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. for a practice session and round on the 6,896-yard, 
par-72 course at Sawgrass, just outside Jacksonville, Fla. A helicopter will 
drop Norman off. Until then, Edwards sits in the shade near the equipment 
storage room. 
</P>
<P>
"Half my life is spent waiting," he says, as he pulls a pack of cigarettes from 
one of his socks. "But I better be here before Greg. It's a mortal sin to be 
late." 
</P>
<P>
As he waits, caddies and players stop and offer congratulations for the victory 
at Doral. Norman shot a 62 on the final day, zooming past 16 other players and 
into a four-way playoff. He won by chipping in for an eagle. 
</P>
<P>
One player laughingly calls Edwards Little Shark, which seems fitting enough. A 
fellow caddie, whose boss has struggled recently, keeps asking about the 
amazing 62, as if he knows he'll never witness one by his player. 
</P>
<P>
"That must have been something," he says wistfully. 
</P>
<P>
"It was," says Edwards, careful not to brag. 
</P>
<P>
At Edwards' side is Norman's red bag, which bears the golfer's name and the 
names of his sponsors, which include a sporting goods company, an Australian 
airline and a Florida resort. Except for his two MacGregor wedges, the irons 
are made by Spalding and each features a tiny Shark insignia on the back of the 
club. His putter is a Ping. The driver and three-wood, hidden by red and white 
head covers the size of pompons, are MacGregors. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the bag are a dozen Maxfli 100 compression balata balls, rain gear, a 
rain hat, an extra towel, 
</P>
<P>
glove, tees, pencils, a bottle of sun screen and a small velour bag that will 
hold Norman's watch, money clip and car keys while he plays. An umbrella is 
tucked into an outer sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers carry less into battle. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards is wearing jeans, a short-sleeved shirt and a pair of worn tennis shoes 
-- the standard loop uniform. The sun is beating down, but the PGA prohibits 
caddies from wearing shorts, even during something as casual as a practice 
round. 
</P>
<P>
In Edwards' left back pocket is a pink 1984 TPC yardage book, basically a 
topography map detailing the distances and undulations of each hole from tee 
box to green. Edwards has a library of such yardage books and score cards, 
carefully collected and updated with each tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"Never know when you'll come back to a course," he says. 
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's practice round, Edwards will double-check to see if the 
distances match those of his last visit. He'll pace off the greens and note 
where the putting surface is flat and where it bends and rolls. 
</P>
<P>
Already, he has crossed out several distances and replaced them with his own 
numbers. Sometimes the changes are as small as three yards, but in golf, nine 
feet could be the difference between landing a shot on the green or in a pond, 
which is shown simply in yardage books as "H2O," with little fish drawn inside 
the water's boundary. 
</P>
<P>
Norman arrives about noon. Necks snap as he strides past. Women feign swoons. 
He has presence. 
</P>
<P>
Norman has had mixed results at the TPC. He finished tied for 63rd in 1983, 
missed the cut in 1984, tied for 49th in 1985 and tied for 33rd in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But in the next three years, he finished tied for fourth, 11th and fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Standing on the driving range before the start of the afternoon practice round, 
Norman tells a reporter, "The more I play this course, the more I like it." 
</P>
<P>
This is the sort of talk Edwards loves. He wants his player upbeat, confident, 
eager to play. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the best thing I could hear," he says. "It's not a question of pulling 
clubs. It's the mental part that's important. That's three-quarters of the 
battle." 
</P>
<P>
Norman and Edwards trust one another, enough so that Edwards, who had never 
worn scuba gear before, jumped into a protective cage during a recent trip to 
Australia and helped Norman feed sharks by hand. 
</P>
<P>
"Greg was real impressed by what he did," says Norman's wife, Laura. 
</P>
<P>
After hitting about 35 balls, Norman chats briefly with Byron Nelson, here to 
watch the tournament. Then he makes his way to the first tee for a practice 
round with Andy Bean and Raymond Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
The round is uneventful. It is a scouting mission, really. Norman sees the 
course. Edwards gets another chance to become more familiar with Norman's 
powerful game. By now, he knows how far Norman can hit each club under ideal 
conditions. What he doesn't know is every nuance, every strength and weakness 
of his player. 
</P>
<P>
"But we're just about there," Norman says. "We're just about across the 
bridge." 
</P>
<P>
As Norman prepares to strike his tee shot on the par-four, 381-yard sixth hole, 
Edwards is asked what club his boss hits best. 
</P>
<P>
"Driver," he says quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, Norman's drive lands in the middle of the fairway, far beyond 
the balls hit by Bean and Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
"See?" says Edwards, as he pulls the bag strap over his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
There is one interesting twist at day's end. The pairings for Thursday's and 
Friday's rounds have been released. 
</P>
<P>
The threesome: Norman, Fred Couples . . . and Watson. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday: Edwards gives thanks. 
</P>
<P>
At most tour events, Wednesdays are reserved for pro-ams, which are tolerated 
by players and dreaded by caddies. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards once was hit in the ankle by an errant shot during one of these 
affairs. He has also dodged skulled wedge shots and ducked an unexpected shank. 
</P>
<P>
Much to everyone's delight, the TPC features no such outing. Instead, Norman 
plays another practice round, this time with Ian Baker-Finch and Mark Lye. 
</P>
<P>
All goes well for Edwards, who finishes checking his yardages and records minor 
changes in his TPC book. 
</P>
<P>
"The course hasn't changed," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Norman, though, seems slightly annoyed with the condition of the greens. On 
Tuesday, they were fast and hard. Today, after watering, they play rough and 
inconsistent. The pros hate inconsistency. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday: Round 1. 
</P>
<P>
After spending an hour on the practice range, Norman and Edwards walk to the 
10th hole for their 8:18 tee time. As they make their way through the crowd, 
someone yells, "C'mon, Greg, break 100." 
</P>
<P>
Norman doesn't smile. 
</P>
<P>
Waiting for them at the tee box are Couples and Watson. For history buffs, this 
marks the first time since the breakup that Watson and Edwards have appeared in 
a tournament and been assigned to the same group. Several times they have found 
themselves in the same practice rounds. Once, after Watson had shot, Edwards 
instinctively took a step toward his former boss' bag. Old habits die hard. 
</P>
<P>
If Edwards and Watson feel awkward about the pairing, they don't show it. 
Already, they have made their picks for an NCAA basketball pool -- Edwards 
likes UNLV, Watson is fond of Connecticut. And as the group waits to tee off, 
they chat away. 
</P>
<P>
Norman walks to the other side of the tee box, where a green, wooden container 
provided by the TPC is located. In it are tees, matches, bandages, pencils, 
candy, sun lotion and golf's real essentials -- aspirin and antacid tablets. 
Edwards grabs some candy. 
</P>
<P>
After a rousing introduction by a tournament official, Norman tees off first 
and hits his drive into a trap. Watson follows and receives the loudest cheer 
from the crowd. His drive lands safely in the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
Norman plops his second shot into another trap and eventually bogeys the hole 
to go one over. 
</P>
<P>
He birdies No. 16, returning to even par, goes one under at No. 3 with a birdie 
putt and then two under at No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
But Norman has struggled the entire round. He saves par on No. 7 with a chip 
and a putt, then bogeys No. 8. After a par at No. 9, he finishes with a 71, 
four shots behind the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't feel all that well," Edwards says. "He didn't feel sharp. There was 
nothing disastrous, nothing to worry about. It's only Day 1. You're just 
playing for position the first few rounds, anyway. We're only four back." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe so, but Norman stalks to the practice range and spends nearly two hours 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Watson shoots a 69. 
</P>
<P>
Friday: Round 2. 
</P>
<P>
Norman starts the day one under but finishes it three over, thanks to costly 
errors and a stiff wind that makes the course play considerably longer. He 
misses greens. He hits traps. He misses putts. He makes bogeys. He shoots 76. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not playing that bad, he's just not sharp," Edwards says to a television 
reporter following the group. "Mental mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
After three-putting on No. 12 and going three over, Norman says to Edwards, "No 
excuses, but . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"I know it's tough," Edwards says. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards doesn't have much patience for whiners. He admired Watson for his 
ability to "stand there and take his medicine" after a poorly hit shot. Norman 
is the same way. 
</P>
<P>
And if he weren't, Edwards would have ignored him. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking, 'If you're coming to me for sympathy, you're not going to get 
it,' " Edwards says later. " 'We've got six holes to play.' I mean, he was just 
telling me the obvious. I'm just letting him get it off his mind." 
</P>
<P>
Norman bogeys No. 14 and No. 15, going five over. The crowd can't believe it: 
Norman may not make the cut. 
</P>
<P>
He birdies No. 16 and pars No. 17. He needs another birdie to advance to the 
weekend rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Williams, a caddie who showed up this week only to find himself without a 
bag, is also following Norman. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, ask Bruce what it's like to caddie on a day like today," he says. 
</P>
<P>
It's a struggle. Norman crunches his drive on the par-four, 440-yard 18th. Then 
a nine-iron shot lands less than pin-length away. 
</P>
<P>
As they walk toward the green, Norman mutters something about the humbling 
nature of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," Edwards says. "Eleven days ago we were riding a high. Now we're 
grinding to make the cut." 
</P>
<P>
Norman drops the putt for a birdie. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I won the tournament," he says wearily. 
</P>
<P>
His two-day total: 147. 
</P>
<P>
The cut: 147. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, just keep him around until the weekend," Edwards says. "History has a 
habit of repeating himself. Four under could win this tournament." 
</P>
<P>
Norman skips the practice range -- too windy. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards returns Norman's bag to the storage room. On his way there, a woman 
stops him. 
</P>
<P>
"Could I have a picture of you?" she says. 
</P>
<P>
A caddie groupie? 
</P>
<P>
Saturday: Round 3. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't often that Norman tees off this early on a Saturday. He's usually on 
the leader board by now, scheduled to appear in the afternoon, when the network 
coverage begins. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Norman and Edwards are in the second group of the day, paired with 
Scott Hoch. 
</P>
<P>
It could be worse. Joey Sindelar, who just teed off a few minutes ago, didn't 
even have a partner until tournament officials enlisted the help of David 
Duval, the local club champion. Duval, an amateur, will play, but his score 
doesn't count. He will serve as "a marker" -- someone who keeps Sindelar's 
score card. 
</P>
<P>
Norman bogeys No. 1, not a good sign. After missing the par putt he stalks 
toward the next tee box. "Piece of . . . greens," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards says nothing. He knows better. 
</P>
<P>
Conditions are difficult. The wind howls through the pines and oaks. One gust 
nearly sends a scoreboard boy to the ground. Rain is predicted. It is a day to 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
Norman appears willing to try. At last, he sinks a long putt, a 25-footer on 
No. 3 that drops him to three over for the tournament. Norman drops his putter 
in amazement, raises his arms and then looks at Edwards, who laughs and shakes 
his head. Norman picks up the putter and then pretends to fling it. 
</P>
<P>
Norman pars No. 4, but is left without a partner when Hoch hands him his own 
score card as they walk off the green. 
</P>
<P>
"Greg, I can't hit my driver and I can't hit my irons," says Hoch, who has been 
bothered by a sore hand. "Good luck." 
</P>
<P>
"See ya," Norman says. 
</P>
<P>
A tournament marshal instructs Norman to play the next hole and join Sindelar 
on No. 6. Norman sends his drive into the fairway, but before leaving the tee 
box he turns to the small crowd following him and kiddingly says, "I can shoot 
62 playing on my own. I can cheat now." 
</P>
<P>
He bogeys the hole. Whatever slim chance he has of moving back into contention 
is slipping away quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Sindelar is waiting for Norman at the sixth tee. Duval has been whisked away. 
</P>
<P>
"David was beating my butt," he tells Norman. "I had to get rid of him." 
</P>
<P>
True. Duval was one under for the day, Sindelar two over. 
</P>
<P>
Norman is five over for the tournament at the turn. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just trying to keep him interested," Edwards says after Norman's third 
bogey in nine holes. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't work. Norman finishes with a 74, 12 strokes off the lead. 
</P>
<P>
"Today was more a job," Edwards says. "There wasn't a whole lot of fun 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
Norman visits the practice range again. It is a short stay as a storm moves 
through, suspending play until Sunday. Norman is invited to the NBC booth to 
talk about the oft-criticized course. 
</P>
<P>
"Should I do it?" he asks Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
"Just be diplomatic," Edwards says. 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry. Norman is honest, but tactful. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday: Round 4. 
</P>
<P>
Starting on No. 10, Norman birdies three of the first four holes and then 
eagles No. 16, going five under for the day and even par for the tournament. 
Memories of that Sunday 62 at Doral start to stir. 
</P>
<P>
Then he dunks one in the water at the par-three, 17th, which features an island 
green and lots of H2O. He leaves there with a triple bogey. 
</P>
<P>
"Hard for him to re-motivate himself after that one," Edwards says later. 
</P>
<P>
Two holes later, Norman seems to have lost interest in the round. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, so much for back-to-back 62s," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"Then let's shoot 67 and walk out of here with a good taste in our mouth," 
Edwards says. 
</P>
<P>
Norman bogeys the next hole. So much for motivational technique. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Norman does stage a slight comeback. He birdies No. 7 and then, on 
the par-five, 582-yard ninth hole, reaches the green in two. His 280-yard 
three-wood hits the fringe and rolls past a peeved Jim Hallet, who was crouched 
in his putting stance at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw him there but we didn't actually think we'd knock it on," Edwards says. 
</P>
<P>
Hallet makes his putt, after glaring back at Norman. 
</P>
<P>
Norman sinks his second putt for a birdie and finishes with a 68, which ties 
him for low round of the day, but leaves him 11 strokes behind the winner, 
Jodie Mudd. 
</P>
<P>
"A long week, a frustrating week," Edwards says. "A lot of good shots weren't 
rewarded and a lot of bad shots were magnified." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Norman wins $20,363, a portion of which will be shared with Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
Now it's on to the Bay Hill Invitational. Norman is scheduled to play in a 
shoot-out Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"See ya at 9:15," Norman says as he darts out of the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
"Nine-fifteen?" Edwards says. 
</P>
<P>
"Nine-fifteen." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards will pack his things and then drive to Orlando. Oddly enough, he can't 
wait. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a whole new golf course I've got to see," he says. 
</P>
<P>
And then he's gone, his footsteps light on the wooden stairs. 
</P>

SQUAW VALLEY: FIVE YEARS AGO, AT AGE 70, ALEXANDER CUSHING RETURNED TO THE SITE 
OF THE 1960 WINTER OLYMPICS TO MAKE HIS SKI RESORT STATE OF THE ART. 
</P>

OLYMPIC VALLEY, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thirty years ago last month, Alexander Cushing surprised the world by staging a 
near-perfect Winter Olympics here. But what, skiers soon began asking, have you 
done for us lately? 
</P>
<P>
For a long time, the answer was not much. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Cushing's mountain manager called the ski lifts junk, and his 
employees acquired a reputation as the rudest individuals this side of New 
York's taxi drivers. The skiing was still great, but apres-ski lodging, dining 
and playing facilities were mainly a mess. 
</P>
<P>
Then, about four or five years ago, a strange thing happened: Cushing left the 
East and resumed his role as resident squire of Squaw Valley -- which is what 
everybody except the postal service calls this 6,200-foot-high Sierra domain 10 
miles northwest of Lake Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd been away, as it were, for 10 or 15 years," Cushing said the other day. 
"When I say away, not really away. I was here once a month, being an absentee 
landlord and so on and so forth, but it came on me that there was Squaw Valley, 
a place for everybody to see. 
</P>
<P>
"You could characterize it any way you wanted to, good or bad or whatever, but 
there it was. It's not like (being) a doctor. You don't bury your mistakes or 
anything like that. Any mistakes we made were there. Anything we did that was 
good was there. 
</P>
<P>
"And it occurred to me, 'This is basically what you do with your life -- it's 
this place here.' And a series of things happened. My (second) wife, Libby, 
died about five years ago. . . . We'd been married 15 years. . . . So, I was 
going to have to change my life anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"But it comes to you, 'Well this is what you do,' and the next question is, 
'Well is this the best you can do?' And you say, 'Well, no. I'd never thought 
about it that way. It's not the best I could do. Well then, why don't you do 
the best you could do? I mean, what are you saving yourself for? Why don't you 
get at it?' " 
</P>
<P>
As a result of this little chat with himself, Cushing said, he changed. 
</P>
<P>
"I really went back to work, is what it comes down to." 
</P>
<P>
At age 70. 
</P>
<P>
That was five years ago, and since then, Squaw Valley USA, as Cushing has 
renamed it, has been transformed into a skiing work of art -- but a work still 
in progress. 
</P>
<P>
The 32 lifts have been improved; his ticky-tacky lodge has been replaced by 
solidly built condominiums; the old Squaw Valley Inn and Olympic Village have 
been spruced up; a new 400-room hotel is scheduled to open next winter; 
restaurants have been added both in Olympic House and on the mountain, and 
employees seem to be at least as civil as those at any other ski area. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, a recent survey by Snow Country magazine rated Squaw Valley the No. 2 
winter resort in the country, behind Vail, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
"Squaw Valley has become a good ski mountain," said Cushing, who stands a lean 
and erect 6-feet-5 and has only traces of gray in his sandy hair. 
</P>
<P>
"It's run better than it used to be. The reputation we had for rude lift 
operators and all that, it goes back quite a ways, but it takes a long time to 
overcome once you get it. I think gradually the public perception is changing, 
and it generally is a good place now. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that we're trying to produce the very best that could be done here. 
And, with that in mind, then it gets to be extremely interesting. I live out 
here six months solid a year now, in the wintertime. I still go back to Rhode 
Island in the summer, where I lived as a kid." 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, Cushing, who has three daughters by his first wife, Justine, 
married for the third time. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Wendt was general counsel for the Squaw Valley Ski Corp., and Cushing, 
who has a law degree from Harvard, said: "It was like the old cliche. She got 
to be so expensive, I had to marry her. 
</P>
<P>
"She's the one, as much as anybody, who said, 'Why don't you get off the dime 
and do it right (at Squaw Valley)? You could do a lot better than that. What 
are you sitting around for? Your life's not over. Let's get going.' " 
</P>
<P>
To really get going, Cushing decided he needed more land, and he has expanded 
his holdings from six acres at the bottom of the mountain, plus a leased 
parking lot and use permits from the U.S. Forest Service, to owning most of his 
end of the valley and the ski slopes. 
</P>
<P>
A complicated deal for acquisition of the old Olympic Village property is in 
the final stages, and once it's completed, Cushing plans to push ahead with 
plans for an Alpine village in the valley. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll get rid of the cars, park them underground," he said. "We asked five of 
the best architectural firms in the country to draw up plans for the village. 
They wanted to know what style we wanted, and we said, 'California Alpine,' on 
the theory that there is no such style. We wanted to see what they'd come up 
with. 
</P>
<P>
"This is all for Elevation 6,200. We also have big plans for Elevation 8,200 
(at High Camp, the upper station of the cable car tramway)." 
</P>
<P>
Cushing pulled a sheaf of drawings from his desk -- he works in his house, 
which is under the gondola tramway and is cluttered with memorabilia and photos 
displayed against bright red walls complemented by an equally bright red, shag 
carpet -- and unveiled his longtime favorite dream, now part reality. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be a genuinely fantastic thing," he said. "Up here at the top 
of the cable car, we're building an ice rink, 100 feet by 200 feet; a spa with 
eight pools, an outdoor pool and a swimming lagoon; 14 tennis courts, and we'll 
have summer skiing, using the Bailey's Beach chairlift. 
</P>
<P>
"The ice-making system can also make snow and doesn't depend on low 
temperatures, so even after our winter season ends on the Fourth of July with 
the McFadden Memorial race -- which we are going to revive -- we'll still be 
able to offer year-round skiing. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to have it all ready, except for the tennis courts -- John Gardiner's 
guy is coming up tomorrow to talk about those -- by sometime this summer. The 
building was 90% done last summer." 
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for three hotels near the top of the mountain, and Cushing 
said the entire concept is consistent with Squaw Valley's transition from 
mainly a day ski area to a destination resort. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to do the type of thing they did in St. Moritz (Switzerland), 
where they have other activities for people who don't ski," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of this stuff is not economically sound by itself, but the way I look at 
it, it's like a band you have in a lounge. Well, an orchestra doesn't make 
money but it contributes to the overall effect. We think that having something 
like this on the top of the mountain, and the fact that we're on two levels, is 
going to set us apart from anyplace else in this country. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like Courchevel (France), where they have Elevation 1,400 (meters) and 
Elevation 1,800 (meters). We have Elevation 6,200 (feet) and Elevation 8,200 
(feet). And we'll connect the two levels by three great machines -- the cable 
car, the gondola and a new tramway, which may be a funicular that goes through 
the mountain, so we'll have access in any kind of weather. 
</P>
<P>
"All this stuff, it's a real kick. It's going to make this place what it should 
be. We are putting in the unusual things -- you could never get anybody else to 
invest in some of them -- but I think that when it's in, they'll say, 'Well 
this guy isn't quite as much of a screwball as we thought. This is for real up 
here.' Then we think we can get investors for the other things. 
</P>
<P>
"I think myself that a hotel will do well up there, and if nobody else will 
build it, we'll build it, because I believe in it. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I've got to be careful that I don't go broke. But you have to 
realize that I'm in sort of a hurry. I'm not putting this stuff in for 
posterity." 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, in addition to the construction at High Camp, Cushing, who has 
Rockefeller banking connections, also put in five new chairlifts, including the 
high-capacity Squaw Peak Express detachable quad, and a $5-million snow-making 
system that he has yet to use. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a real tale of woe," he said, "In the fall, when we really needed the 
snow making, the county wouldn't let us turn it on. They said we hadn't filed 
an environmental impact report (EIR). So, now we're compiling one. It had the 
effect of stopping us for a year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting so they're requiring EIRs on top of EIRs on top of EIRs. I don't 
know how many we needed for the two lifts to make the connection to the new 
hotel so it will be on the lift system when it's ready. Both lifts are in. Big 
Red is operating now, but Squaw Creek, which comes up from the hotel to meet 
Big Red at the top of Red Dog (mountain) isn't running, because the county said 
we needed another EIR to grade for the larger landing space where two lifts 
come together." 
</P>
<P>
The hotel, which is supposed to be enlarged by 400 rooms in its second phase, 
is the first high-rise structure in the valley. 
</P>
<P>
Located on the edge of the meadow that was used as a parking lot during the 
1960 Winter Olympics, it will be adjacent to a golf course that is scheduled to 
open with the first nine holes in the summer of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Cushing is also in the middle of a legal battle with Placer County over his 
plans for a 33rd lift, called Silverado, which will serve Shirley Canyon, and 
he said there is a small group of local residents opposing anything he tries to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
"But we're getting support from a new group called the Squaw Valley Council, 
composed of about 300 people who like living in a ski resort," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Squaw Valley has a potential 8,300 acres of skiing, but Cushing estimates that 
only about 6,000 will be developed and served by 35 to 40 lifts. The terrain is 
rated as 25% beginner, 45% intermediate and 30% expert -- including such 
world-renowned steeps as the West Face of KT-22. 
</P>
<P>
The plethora of lifts and vast expanse of slopes have enabled Cushing to 
guarantee, in commercials that he does himself on San Francisco Bay Area TV 
stations, that if skiers have to wait more than 10 minutes for a lift, they can 
get their money back. 
</P>
<P>
"We have crowds now of as many as 14,000, plus nobody knows how many of the 
4,000 season-ticket buyers, and we still rarely have anyone say they had to 
wait in line," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To get the guarantee, a skier must add an extra dollar to the $35 fee for an 
all-day ticket, and register as either beginner, intermediate or expert. The 
guarantee then applies only to those lifts corresponding to that level of 
ability. 
</P>
<P>
Cushing gave refunds once when a power failure shut down lifts from noon to 1 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"You could say that's not our fault and it wasn't," he said. "But we paid 
because I wanted to make it credible . . . like a Reno gambling house, you 
know, just to get the word around that we really pay off. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, last year, on the Martin Luther King holiday, we had 25 busloads of 
students from L.A., and at 2:10 p.m. there was an 11-minute wait on one of the 
expert lifts, which was very unusual. We figured the kids from L.A. all bought 
expert guarantees, but we paid out 160 refunds." 
</P>
<P>
Squaw Valley's lifts have not always been so reliable. A series of accidents in 
the 1960s caused Hans Burkhart, then Cushing's mountain manager, to resign, 
calling them all junk. But Burkhart later returned as the company's president 
and also supervised installation of the Garaventa cable car. 
</P>
<P>
Now a consultant in Bend, Ore,, he remains "a close friend and adviser," 
according to Cushing, who admits that his original Poma chairlifts were 
"lightweight." 
</P>
<P>
He also says the cable car accident in early 1978 that killed four people was 
one that "could never happen," or so he had been told by the Swiss company's 
engineers. 
</P>
<P>
"But it did," he said. "One of the cables came loose and cut through one of the 
cars. I vowed that unless we could find out exactly why it happened, the cable 
car would not be rebuilt." 
</P>
<P>
An Austrian tramway expert was hired -- "skiing's Red Adair," Cushing called 
him -- and recommended two backup safety measures beyond those in the original 
design, and there have been no problems since. 
</P>
<P>
A few years later, Cushing replaced the original gondola tramway, between the 
base and the Gold Coast mid-level restaurant, with one designed by Lift 
Engineering Co. of Carson City, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when Burkhart resigned (the second time)," Cushing said. "He told me 
not to buy it because the company had never made one before. It might be OK the 
second year, he thought, but he didn't want to nurse it through the first year. 
</P>
<P>
"Then (even) in the second year, that gondola had 32 stoppages on Washington's 
Birthday. The customers were so mad, they'd spit in the attendant's face when 
they finally got off at the top. How the hell can you run a business like that? 
So, I said, 'We've had enough. We've got to get rid of this thing, no matter 
what.' " 
</P>
<P>
The gondola was replaced again, causing a bit of a family crisis. The president 
of Lift Engineering was Janik Kunczynski, who happens to be Cushing's 
son-in-law. His Yan chairlifts are highly rated, but this was his first 
gondola. 
</P>
<P>
"He's still my son-in-law," Cushing said with a laugh. "He doesn't speak to me 
. . . at least, not if he can help it. But he wouldn't have spoken to me if I 
hadn't given him the job. And he doesn't speak to me when I do give him the 
job!" 
</P>
<P>
Now in its 40th year of operation, all under Cushing, Squaw Valley has had its 
ups and downs, in more ways then one. But no matter what the master plan 
produces in the future, it would be hard to top the moment on Feb. 18, 1960, 
when the sun suddenly broke through a persistent cloud cover just as the Walt 
Disney-orchestrated opening ceremony launched the VIIIth Olympic Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
Five years earlier, Cushing came from nowhere -- Squaw Valley wasn't then and 
still isn't a city -- to snatch the Games away from Innsbruck, Austria, 
employing nothing more than its founder's cockiness and a three-dimensional 
model of mostly non-existent facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a wonderful occasion for all of us," Cushing said. "They were the first 
nationally televised Winter Olympics. CBS paid $50,000 for the rights. Now, 
they go for between $300 million and 400 million." 
</P>
<P>
They were also the last human-scale Olympics, with 665 athletes competing 
within walking distance of their events. Eight years later, at Grenoble, 
France, 1,293 athletes took part, and some of the venues were 40 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
America's skiing boom has been attributed in part to the Squaw Valley Games. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he deserved credit for it, Cushing said: "Who knows? People have been 
kind enough to say we set off the ski explosion. But all I remember are those 
10 perfect days."

Led by junior center Trisha Stevens' 24 points, Stanford set an NCAA women's 
West Regional record for points in a 114-87 victory over No. 22 Arkansas 
Saturday night at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
The victory for No. 2 Stanford (30-1) advances the Cardinal to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas finished at 25-5. The Cardinal broke the old mark of 104 points scored 
by CS Long Beach in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
No. 1 Louisiana Tech 71, No. 8 Texas 57 -- With Barbara Bolden, Shantel 
Hardison and Sheila Ethridge handling the scoring because star center Venus 
Lacy was held to 16 points, the Lady Techsters (32-0) beat the Lady Longhorns 
(27-5) in the Midwest Regional final at Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
No. 9 Auburn 76, No. 3 Washington 50 -- The Lady Tigers (27-6) shut down the 
Huskies' (28-3) usually effective inside game to easily win the Mideast 
Regional final at Iowa City, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
No. 12 Virginia 79, No. 4 Tennessee 75 -- Dawn Staley scored six of the 
Cavaliers' nine points in overtime to help Virginia (29-5) beat the Lady Vols 
(27-6) in the East Regional final at Norfolk, Va.

<P>
The confrontation was the first game of the season for both teams, and now, for 
one of them, it will be the last. 
</P>
<P>
When Nevada Las Vegas and Loyola Marymount played in the Thomas &amp; Mack 
Center Nov. 15, UNLV was playing without starting center David Butler and 
reserve forward Moses Scurry, both academically ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola was playing the game with Hank Gathers, who scored 18 points and had 11 
rebounds. This time the Lions are playing in his memory. 
</P>
<P>
The past four months have brought so many changes to these teams that UNLV 
Coach Jerry Tarkanian says the Rebels' 102-91 victory in a preseason NIT game 
no longer has much significance in today's West Regional final. But the players 
remember it. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Johnson was playing his first major-college game that day, and he became 
winded against the Lions' all-out, scrambling running game. 
</P>
<P>
"I was tugging on those shorts more than since I've been here," said Johnson, 
whose first shot as a Division I player was blocked by Gathers. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV won by outshooting Loyola, 54% to 47%, and by going to a zone defense in 
the second half. The zone slowed Loyola's offense, limiting the Lions to 37 
points in the final 20 minutes -- a season low until Friday's 62-60 victory 
over Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels won by not abandoning their own running game, and they say they will 
not do that this time. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to slow the game up," Tarkanian said. "We did run against them 
and we'll run again. I don't think we want to get in a race-horse game, because 
they play that way every time they're on the court. We're going to play the way 
we play." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Bo Kimble nor Gathers had a particularly good game against UNLV. Kimble 
scored only 21 points on seven-of-17 shooting, and missed all four of his 
three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
"It was early in the season, and I don't think I was playing the way I am now," 
Kimble said. "I think I'll be able to do what I've been doing all year." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Fryer led Loyola in scoring with 23 points, making only four three-point 
shots in 10 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson Hunt led UNLV, scoring 26 points and making three three-pointers, and 
Johnson added 24 points. But Hunt has been in a slump, making only two of 14 
three-point shots in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola's Paul Westhead, asked how he would coach against his own team, offered 
specious advice: "I'd play real fast. I'd push that ball, burn our guys right 
out, because we win slow, as you saw last night (during the victory over 
Alabama)." 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian acknowledged that his team isn't as well conditioned as Westhead's. 
</P>
<P>
"For years I said no one would work as hard as we do and nobody would be in 
better shape," Tarkanian said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not in as good condition as Loyola and I'll be the first to admit it." 
</P>
<P>
Westhead says his team is better and faster than in the first game. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're an immensely faster team now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing I've learned about my system the past two years is we are totally 
unprepared to be a fast-break team until we've played about six games. We need 
six games under our belt to be a running and pressing team." 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian, in a complimentary assessment of the Loyola team, said he was 
surprised that Loyola beat New Mexico State in the first round, more surprised 
that Loyola beat Michigan in the second round, and more surprised still that 
Loyola beat Alabama in the third round. 
</P>
<P>
Said Kimble: "The world is full of surprises. There are lot of people out there 
who are really surprised. Hopefully, he'll be surprised again Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
Loyola's Chris Knight compared UNLV's Johnson to a boxer susceptible to tiring 
in the late rounds, saying that he was strong in the first three rounds, but 
beatable after eight. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's response: "I'll compare me to a boxer, too. When I was boxing, I 
didn't go past the third round. Knockout." 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Hank Gathers is being remembered by both teams. The UNLV players have worn 
black bands on a shoulder of their jerseys since Gathers' death at the 
suggestion of Stacey Augmon, who played with Gathers on a Cal State Los Angeles 
summer league team. 
</P>
<P>
Bo Kimble's 1,089 points this season place him 10th on the all-time list led by 
Pete Maravich's 1,381 for Louisiana State in 1970. Kimble will pass Otis 
Birdsong of Houston with his next basket, and is 36 points shy of Hersey 
Hawkins' mark of 1,125 for Bradley in 1988, the sixth best Jeff Fryer has set a 
tournament record for three-point attempts with 81. He is one basket away from 
tying the record of 35 three-pointers set by Michigan's Glen Rice last season. 
. . . UNLV's NCAA tournament record under Coach Jerry Tarkanian is 23-10. . . . 
Only one team seeded 11th, as Loyola is, has ever made it to the Final Four: 
Louisiana State in 1986.

SOUTHEAST REGIONAL: CLEM HASKINS TOOK OVER A PROGRAM THAT NEARLY 
SELF-DESTRUCTED FOUR YEARS AGO.

<P>
Maybe Bobby Cremins is amazed. Maybe the Georgia Tech basketball coach is 
sincere when he looks at his team's placement in today's NCAA Southeast 
Regional final, shakes his head and says, "I don't know how we keep winning." 
</P>
<P>
He still hasn't got a thing on Minnesota's Clem Haskins. 
</P>
<P>
Only Georgia Tech's season was on the brink Friday night when the Yellow 
Jackets barely beat the buzzer and Michigan State, 81-80. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, Minnesota's entire program was on the brink. 
</P>
<P>
"Our program was so far down, we couldn't go any lower," Haskins says. "If you 
could've looked at us in 1986 and predicted that we'd be in the final eight in 
four years, I'd have said you were sniffing the wrong stuff." 
</P>
<P>
In January of 1986, three Minnesota players -- Mitchell Lee, George Williams 
and Kevin Smith -- were arrested on rape charges in Madison, Wis., after a Big 
Ten game between Minnesota and Wisconsin. This came only months after Lee's 
acquittal for a separate rape charge in January of 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Within days, all three players were gone -- although they, too, eventually were 
acquitted. So was Coach Jim Dutcher, who announced his resignation after the 
university president decided to forfeit Minnesota's next game, against 
Northwestern. 
</P>
<P>
The prevailing sentiment in the Twin Cities, however, was that the university 
didn't go far enough. Minnesota basketball became a scourge amid the genteel 
community, branded as a haven for marginal students and marginal citizens. 
Newspaper columnists called for the dissolution of the program. 
</P>
<P>
The university settled for a new coach. Haskins was hired from Western 
Kentucky, where he had coached the Hilltoppers to two 20-victory seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Haskins was used to dirty jobs. An aspiring rancher, he knew his way around a 
shovel and a horse's stall. 
</P>
<P>
But Minnesota basketball? 
</P>
<P>
"I took the job on April 7. On April 8, I was asking myself the same question," 
Haskins says. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm not a quitter. I'm a builder. Check my record. My last year at Western 
Kentucky, we had a team good enough to win a national championship (the 
Hilltoppers lost to Kentucky in the 1986 NCAA tournament). 
</P>
<P>
"When I evaluated the program at Minnesota, I knew they needed someone like 
Clem Haskins. I wasn't the only one. But Clem Haskins was one of the guys who 
could do the job." 
</P>
<P>
This job began at ground zero. Haskins brought in seven freshmen and three of 
them -- forward Willie Burton, forward Richard Coffey and center Jim 
Shikenjanski -- played extensively. 
</P>
<P>
Those Gophers went 9-19. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, there was improvement. The 1987-88 Gophers finished 10-18. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to roll with the punches," Haskins said. "We knew we were trying to do 
things the right way. We had guys going to class. That was the most important 
thing. Winning ballgames came later." 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota won 19 games last season. That was enough to earn the Gophers a berth 
in the NCAA tournament, where Minnesota reached the East Regional semifinals 
before losing to Duke. 
</P>
<P>
This season brought the breakthrough. After Friday night's 82-75 upset of 
Syracuse, the Gophers are 23-8 and in the NCAA's final eight for the first time 
in the school's history. 
</P>
<P>
And still at Haskins' side, comprising 80% of his lineup, are four members of 
that first recruiting class -- Burton, Coffey, Shikenjanski and guard Melvin 
Newbern. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a commitment and stayed with them for four years," Haskins said. "We 
have two excellent redshirts that could help us win right now. But I made a 
commitment to these guys then and I've stayed with them. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not about winning and losing. This is about doing the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
Burton, an All-Big Ten first team selection, is averaging 18.7 points. Newbern 
is averaging 14.8. Shikenjanski dutifully attends to the grunt work inside the 
lane and Coffey, a former Army paratrooper, was largely responsible for 
grounding Syracuse's Derrick Coleman Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Haskins' fifth starter, junior guard Kevin Lynch, is averaging 13.4 points and 
made seven of 10 shots against Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech (27-6) is also approaching unprecedented territory. The Yellow 
Jackets have advanced this far three times before -- the last time in 1985 -- 
but have never reached the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
And after Friday's overtime escape against Michigan State, Cremins isn't sure 
if his team hasn't worn out its welcome. 
</P>
<P>
"That Michigan State game, I didn't get over that until this morning," Cremins 
said. "How the hell did we win that game?" 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State Coach Jud Heathcote will tell Cremins that he didn't. According 
to Heathcote, the shot that sent the game into overtime -- a 19-footer by 
Yellow Jacket guard Kenny Anderson -- came after the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
Cremins disputes that, saying: "I feel fortunate to win, but that has nothing 
to do with the clock. Kenny beat the buzzer. I feel fortunate because we're not 
playing well. We're shooting horribly. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how we keep winning." 
</P>
<P>
This is how Georgia Tech wins. The Yellow Jackets' best shooter, Dennis Scott, 
makes six of his first 21 attempts, but with seven seconds left in overtime 
sinks a hanging jumper in the key after spinning around two Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't shot the ball all game," Scott said, "but with 10 seconds on the 
clock, the ball came to me. With that kind of confidence they had in me, I 
couldn't let my teammates down." 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech and Minnesota will be playing at less than full capacity today. 
Yellow Jacket guard Brian Oliver is playing on a bad ankle. And Minnesota's 
Burton suffered a scratched eye against Syracuse, which left his vision 
temporarily blurred but was treated with a moisturizing solution Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Burton will start. This opportunity, which seemed a million miles away in 1986, 
is not to be missed. 
</P>
<P>
"You go back and look at Minnesota four years ago," Haskins said. "The student 
body was down on us, the community was down on us. But we've brought 
credibility and honor back to Minnesota basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"Sunday, every television set in Minnesota will be turned on."

Suspect: Pitching uncertainty of the type exposed during the World Series still 
haunts the San Francisco Giants. Don Robinson isn't expected to throw in a 
competitive situation for another month because of knee surgery. There is no 
clear replacement for Craig Lefferts, who saved 20 games and went to the San 
Diego Padres as a free agent. The all right-handed rotation of Rick Reuschel, 
Scott Garrelts, Mike LaCoss and Kelly Downs ended the season in disarray. "All 
four of those guys have to chip in and win 12, 16, 17 games," Giant Manager 
Roger Craig said the other day, bravely adding: "I think they can." 
</P>
<P>
Trade winds: The Atlanta Braves, short on relief, are attempting to send 
infielder Andres Thomas and a pitcher to the Seattle Mariners for Mike Jackson 
or to the Boston Red Sox for Lee Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Add relief: Here's just one of the problems facing Sparky Anderson as he 
attempts to lead the Detroit Tigers back from the 103 losses of 1989: The 16 
pitchers he has in camp produced a total of 10 major league saves last year. 
</P>
<P>
More relief: The St. Louis Cardinals' Todd Worrell, who had tendon transplant 
surgery on his right elbow in December, will have arthroscopic surgery to 
relieve ulna nerve pressure in the elbow on April 6. The optimistic Cardinals 
still expect him back in July, though Manager Whitey Herzog seemed to ask a 
pertinent question: "How the hell can he have a second operation and be on the 
same timetable?" 
</P>
<P>
Storm warning: Now with the Kansas City Royals, Storm Davis took a shot or two 
at his former manager, Tony La Russa of the Oakland A's, in a USA Today article 
Thursday, saying La Russa has a mean streak, and that he (Davis) always 
received more help from A's coaches Dave Duncan and Dave McKay. La Russa 
responded by saying he is proud whenever his coaches receive credit and that 
some people may confuse competitiveness with meanness. 
</P>
<P>
He and the A's were more upset by an accompanying quote from Royal pitching 
coach Frank Funk, who claimed that the addition of Mark Davis gives Kansas City 
baseball's best bullpen. La Russa said he still favored Dennis Eckersley and 
the A's bullpen. "Some might be as good, but no one has a better bullpen than 
ours," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wise investment: Von Hayes, the Philadelphia Phillies outfielder who might 
still end up in Anaheim, made a sizable contribution the other day to build and 
refurbish batting cages at St. Petersburg (Fla.) Community College, where he 
worked out during the lockout. "You never know," Hayes told Philadelphia 
reporters. "We might need them again in four years." ROSS NEWHAN

USC nose tackle Don Gibson suffered a broken left ankle Saturday in a game-type 
spring practice scrimmage at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson played only in the Rose Bowl game against Michigan after being sidelined 
during the regular season while recuperating from surgery on his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
USC Coach Larry Smith said losing Gibson in 1989 was a blow to the team, and he 
had expected to rebuild the defensive line around him this year. 
</P>
<P>
On the last play of the scrimmage, watched by about 3,000, freshman quarterback 
Reggie Perry suffered a dislocated left elbow. Perry, a 6-foot-2, 195-pound 
athlete from Denison, Tex., reminds Smith of Rodney Peete because of his 
running style. MAL FLORENCE

WARD RIDES TO ROSE BOWL WIN; 
</P>
<P>
MOTOCROSS: MISSION VIEJO VETERAN, 28, GOES WIRE-TO-WIRE IN THE 20-LAP MAIN 
EVENT AS SUPERCROSS RETURNS TO PASADENA AFTER A FIVE-YEAR ABSENCE AND DRAWS 
30,846 SPECTATORS.

<P>
Veteran Jeff Ward rode a wire-to-wire win on his green Kawasaki as Supercross 
returned to the Rose Bowl after a five-year absence Saturday night, drawing 
30,846 spectators. 
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old rider from Mission Viejo came off the line in front in the 
20-lap Coors Challenge and had only one challenge in mid-race from Kawasaki 
teammate JeffMatiasevich of La HabraHeights. 
</P>
<P>
Matiasevich, the Camel Supercross points leader, finished second, followed by 
Jean-Michel Bayle of France, the world 250cc champion. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was Ward's second this year, and the 19th of his stadium series 
career. It was also his second in the Rose Bowl, having won there in 1984. The 
19 victories place him third on the all-time stadium list behind Rick Johnson's 
28 and Bob Hannah's 27. Johnson missed the Rose Bowl race with injuries and 
Hannah has retired. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the best start I've had all season," an elated Ward said. "It's so 
crucial on these tight stadium courses and was all the better coming on a 
hometown course with all my friends watching. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of nice to be riding out there all by myself for a while. Usually, 
I'm back about fifth or sixth where I can get tangled with someone, or forced 
to take lines I don't want. It was fun tonight, especially when I looked around 
and didn't see Bayle right behind me." 
</P>
<P>
The finish was the reverse of their heat race where Matiasevich held off Ward 
by a couple of bike lengths. The other heats were won by Larry Ward and Jeff 
Stanton, the defending Supercross champion from Sherwood, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
The hottest race was contested by Bayle, Stanton and Ron Tichenor as they 
traded third, fourth and fifth positions back and forth before Bayle pulled 
away. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Kiedrowski of Canyon Country moved into fourth place late in the race, 
followed by Larry Ward, Stanton and Tichenor, who faded in the last few laps. 
Larry Ward was in second place on the fourth lap when he fell and lost ground. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Ward's other 1990 victory came at Atlanta. The win enabled Ward to pick up 
only three points on Matiasevich in his quest for a third Supercross champion. 
The native of Scotland won in 1985 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"The way Matiasevich is riding, he's going to be tough to catch, but we have 10 
races left and a lot can happen," Ward said. "He's been getting excellent 
starts and when you do that it takes a lot of heat off you." 
</P>
<P>
Buddy Antunez of Ontario and Jimmy Gaddis of Phoenix, two Suzuki riders who had 
to make the 125cc main event through a last-chance qualifying race, finished 
one-two in the 15-lap support race final. It was Antunez's first victory of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Both crashed during their heat race and were forced to ride an extra six-lap 
race to earn their way into the 15-lap final.

Opening Verse completed the 1 1/16-mile Razorback in 1:41 2/5 and returned 
$5.40, $3.20 and $2.60 as the second choice in the wagering. Favored Primal 
returned $3.00 and $2.40. Silver Survivor, beaten in the final strides for 
second, paid $3.20.

<P>
SOME GIANTS OF TURF TO MEET TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Without question, the $315,000 San Luis Rey Stakes today at Santa Anita is one 
of the more attractive races of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The prelude to the season-ending San Juan Capistrano attracted only six 
entrants, but three of them are Prized, Frankly Perfect and Hawkster. Each 
boasts outstanding credentials on the turf, and a fourth, El Senor, also is no 
slouch. The eastern-based 6-year-old has earned almost $1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Best known for his upset of Sunday Silence in last summer's Swaps Stakes, 
Prized has earned recognition as one of the the nation's best grass performers. 
</P>
<P>
He made his debut on the surface in the Breeders' Cup Turf and came through 
with a narrow decision over Sierra Roberta, Star Lift and 11 others at 
Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
Given a vacation after that huge payday, the 4-year-old Kris S. colt returned 
in the Arcadia Handicap March 4 against Breeders' Cup Mile and Eclipse Award 
winner Steinlen. 
</P>
<P>
Dismissed by a lot of serious handicappers who felt a mile was too short for 
him, Prized trailed with less than three furlongs to run, then, helped by the 
sizzling pace in front of him, took off and won going away with Steinlen -- who 
bled -- well beaten. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks later, Prized gets the Breeders' Cup Turf distance -- 1 1/2 miles 
-- and it is apparent, despite his latest success, the more furlongs the better 
for trainer Neil Drysdale's colt. 
</P>
<P>
Frankly Perfect, owned by Kings' owner Bruce McNall and Wayne Gretzky, is the 
defending San Luis Rey champion, having defeated heavily favored Great 
Communicator a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the 5-year-old son of Perrault has victories in the Golden Gate 
Handicap, the Hollywood Turf Cup, and on Feb. 19 he was much the best in 
winning the San Luis Obispo Handicap. Frankly Perfect was also beaten by a nose 
in the Sunset Handicap at Hollywood Park, and he was runner-up to Alwuhush in 
the Carleton F. Burke at Oak Tree, so consistency hasn't been a problem for 
trainer Charlie Whittingham's horse. 
</P>
<P>
However, neither Prized nor Frankly Perfect have come close to duplicating the 
effort Hawkster turned in on Oct. 14 in winning the Oak Tree Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
In improving his record, at the time, to 4-0 on the turf, the Silver Hawk colt 
opened up on his eight rivals from the start, lengthened his margin on the 
backstretch while setting blazing fractions and cruised home by four lengths in 
a world-record 2:22 4/5 for 1 1/2 miles. 
</P>
<P>
However, Hawkster hasn't seen the Santa Anita grass since. After returning from 
a fifth-place finish in the Japan Cup, he made two starts on the dirt, even 
though it's obvious he's nowhere near the same horse on that surface. He hasn't 
won on the dirt since the 1988 Norfolk. 
</P>
<P>
Helped by the off track, Hawkster ran third in the Charles H. Strub, then beat 
only stablemate Bayakoa in the Santa Anita Handicap, finishing 22 lengths 
behind Ruhlmann. 
</P>
<P>
Take out those two efforts and most would probably consider him the horse to 
beat today. Instead, the question is whether Hawkster will be able to bounce 
back or if those two races took their toll. 
</P>
<P>
Delegant and Just As Lucky are the other San Luis Rey entrants, but it's 
virtually impossible to give them serious consideration in a race in which 
everyone is carrying 126 pounds. Delegant was getting eight pounds from Frankly 
Perfect when he was second at 38-1 in the San Luis Obispo. Just As Lucky got 10 
pounds and was third. 
</P>
<P>
Making her first start since finishing ninth in the San Gorgonio Handicap in 
early January, Stylish Star rallied to win an eventful $80,850 Las Cienegas 
Handicap Saturday at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
There was a lengthy stewards' inquiry involving the first four finishers in the 
six-horse field, resulting in the disqualification of Stormy But Valid, who 
originally finished second. She was placed fifth, behind Sexy Slew, who was 
impeded badly nearing the sixteenth pole. 
</P>
<P>
The stewards ruled that Stormy But Valid, ridden by Gary Stevens, came out, 
albeit slightly, triggering the trouble, which also involved Hot Novel -- who 
was moved up to second -- and Stylish Star. 
</P>
<P>
"There was contact," said Chris McCarron, who was aboard the winner, the 9-2 
fourth choice. "The bumping went all the way out to me. I was turned in a 
little bit because another horse hit me in the rear. 
</P>
<P>
"She was best. I've been on her during her last three works, and she had been 
working very well." 
</P>
<P>
Stylish Star, winner of the Del Mar Oaks and a division of Hollywood Park's 
Dahlia Handicap, had never won a sprint before Saturday. At the end, her margin 
was a little more than a length in 1:13 for about 6 1/2-furlongs on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
"Once she ran badly in the San Gorgonio, it made us realize she'd been running 
steadily from May to January," trainer Dan Hendricks said. "She just needed a 
rest. We gave her a month and this fit perfectly into the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"She's been so good to me. As long as the inquiry took, it worried me. It 
looked like the other horses came out and bumped us. That's what saved us 
because we tightened it up a bit. When a horse gets hit like that, it naturally 
drops in toward the horse that bumped it." 
</P>
<P>
Hot Novel, who had just won an allowance race over the course, didn't have 
clear sailing and never really got her best chance. "I got bothered a lot," 
said Eddie Delahoussaye. "I got it coming out of the gate, down the hill and in 
the stretch. I just couldn't go anywhere. I was trapped." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Sandy Shulman has been fined $300 by the stewards for a medication 
violation. Fill A Fair Pocket, who was unplaced in the ninth race March 15, had 
an excess level of Butazolidin . . . Santa Anita will spend about $1.8 million 
to renovate the hillside part of its turf course when the meeting ends April 
23. Last year, the infield portion of the course was redone at a cost of $3.1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Desormeaux scored a consecutive triple Saturday with Kaboi in the fifth, 
favored Toby Jug in the sixth and 12-1 outsider Peppy's Kingdom in the seventh. 
Peppy's Kingdom's victory gave trainer Bob Hess three consecutive victories in 
the seventh race. He won Thursday's seventh with Sumthing Rare and came back 
Friday with Twombly. Hess also took the ninth Saturday with Buckland's Halo. . 
. . Gary Stevens and Chris McCarron each had two winners Saturday.

BOY, 5, RECOVERING IN PIT BULL ATTACK

A 5-year-old boy mauled by a pit bull was recovering Saturday after surgery to 
repair painful bite wounds, hospital officials said. Garry Chisholm's condition 
was upgraded from serious to fair after the Friday night surgery, said Mark 
Morelli of Children's Hospital of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"This morning, the youngster is awake and well-oriented, but in considerable 
discomfort," Morelli said Saturday. He said Garry will remain hospitalized 
several more days. Authorities said the boy was mauled Friday after he jumped a 
fence into a neighbor's back yard where the dog was kept. He suffered multiple 
scrapes on his arms, back, chest and face and bite wounds to the back of his 
head and around his right ear. The pit bull's owner, Gabino De La Torre, found 
the shaken, bleeding youngster when he and a friend returned home from the 
beach. The dog was placed in quarantine by the San Diego County Department of 
Animal Control. Agency officials said they will decide by Monday or Tuesday 
whether it will be destroyed.

An incendiary device was apparently used late Friday to torch a rural saloon 
where the bartender and another man were shot to death the previous night. 
Butte County sheriff's investigators said the saloon in the Berry Creek region 
25 miles northeast of Oroville was leveled by the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters with six units of equipment were forced to wait 15 minutes a 
quarter-mile from the scene because of reports of gunshots at the site. Earlier 
in the evening, a crowd had shown up outside the saloon in what locals said was 
a "candlelight vigil" for the slain men. The sheriff's office identified one of 
the victims as Charles Haley, 60, of Berry Creek, who was a customer at the bar 
Thursday night when the shootings followed an argument in a parking lot. The 
bartender, known as "Dave" but who was not officially identified, was also 
killed. Suspects in the shootings were still being sought Saturday.

RECOLLECTIONS OF A COMMUNIST WHO DIED IN TIME; 
</P>
<P>
MEMORIES BY ANDREI GROMYKO (DOUBLEDAY: $24.95; 432 PP.; 0-385-41288-6) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Andranik Migranian, Migranian, a senior researcher in the Institute of 
Economy of the World Socialist System, U.S.S.R. Academy of Science, is a 
distinguished visiting lecturer in economics at San Diego State University. 
Translated from the Russian by Si Frumkin. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andrei Gromyko lived a long and fortunate life not simply because he had a 
brilliant career. He was born into a poor peasant family, appointed ambassador 
to the United States while still quite young, and made foreign minister in 
1957, a position he held for the next 30 years. His career culminated in the 
pre-perestroika days, when he assumed what is theoretically the highest 
position in the Soviet government: chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme 
Soviet. 
</P>
<P>
Gromyko probably was most fortunate, though, in the timing of his death, for 
had he lived just a few months more, he would have witnessed the destruction of 
the values and institutions that had shaped him and that he himself had 
developed and reinforced for most of his adult life. At the time these memoirs 
were written, however, he was certain that his world was destined to remain 
essentially unchanged for the foreseeable future. Having died in time, Gromyko 
was able to maintain a belief in his own integrity and in that of the old 
world. 
</P>
<P>
The central portion of "Memories," for instance, explores the problems of the 
world that resulted from the Yalta Accords, a world Gromyko assumed to be 
inviolable. I can only guess at the unhappiness and disappointment that would 
have been Gromyko's had he heard Central Committee Secretary Alexander Yakovlev 
and Foreign Minister Eduard Shervardnadze declare, at the recently concluded 
plenum of the Communist Party, that Stalin's legacy and the consequences of 
Yalta had to be overcome before there could be true mutual equality in 
relations with Eastern Europe and an end to the division of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Gromyko also would have been quite upset over the conclusions reached by a 
commission of the Congress of People's Deputies that had investigated, under 
Yakovlev's chairmanship, the German-Soviet pact of 1939. In his memoirs, 
Gromyko repeats the usual Stalinist cant by claiming that there was a pressing 
need for the agreement with Germany, and denying the existence of any secret 
codicils. The second Congress, however, finally denounced Stalin's immoral 
foreign policy and admitted what has long been known to everyone in the outside 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Official Soviet evaluations in the last few months also have negated the 
reasons Gromyko gives for the invasions of Hungary, Czechoslovakia and 
Afghanistan. The incursions were necessary, Gromyko argues here, to prevent 
these countries from escaping the Soviet orbit. To justify Moscow's military 
intervention, Gromyko presents the old, orthodox arguments of 
counterrevolutionary plots, Western mischief and threats to socialism. 
</P>
<P>
Gromyko's brief musings on Afghanistan are even more cynical, justifying a 
dirty conflict that lasted for more than a decade and claimed the lives of tens 
of thousands of Soviet soldiers and hundreds of thousands of Afghans. Had he 
lived just a few months longer, he would have been less than pleased to hear 
this war condemned not only by Western politicians or the mass media he so 
contemptuously dismisses here, but by Soviet parliamentarians denouncing aging 
oligarchs from the podium of the Congress of People's Deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Gromyko's analysis of the Cold War similarly repeats the cliches that populate 
Soviet international-relations textbooks. We read about Roosevelt's policies 
against the Soviet Union, Truman's betrayals and the attempts by Western 
politicians during the post-war period to destroy the wartime alliance among 
the Soviet Union, the United States and Great Britain, an alliance that Gromyko 
saw as natural and beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
Without idealizing in any way the foreign policy of President Truman and the 
West during the Cold War, I must note that Gromyko did not understand -- or 
possibly did not want to understand -- the abnormality of a lasting alliance 
among the three. 
</P>
<P>
Gromyko sees such a peace-time alliance as a natural consequence of a war-time 
alliance, but the former was in fact brought about only by extraordinary 
circumstances. If Gromyko's analysis had considered the difference of basic 
values and institutions between the United States and the U.S.S.R., rather than 
focusing on superficial and pragmatic distinctions, he would not have assigned 
blame for the start of the Cold War to Truman's personality or American nuclear 
monopoly, but rather to the politics of Stalin's regime. Almost in spite of 
himself, Gromyko shows the unnaturalness of a post-war alliance between the 
West and Stalin when he writes: 
</P>
<P>
"During the Conference, Churchill was replaced by (Prime Minister Clement) 
Attlee, but the new Labor government truly adopted the line taken by Churchill, 
and Truman and Attlee easily found a common language." 
</P>
<P>
The very fact that Churchill was replaced by Attlee, who then chose to pursue 
the policies of Churchill and Truman, tells us that the reason for the post-war 
split between the U.S.S.R. and the United States and Britain are not to be 
found in the machinations of Western politicians but rather in the deep-seated 
and basic differences between the goals and concerns of the Soviet Union and 
the West. 
</P>
<P>
The chapter "From Nixon to Reagan" is written in the same vein. Gromyko 
acknowledges advances in arms control and in preparation for the SALT 1 and 
SALT 2 talks, but has nothing to say about the real reasons for the collapse of 
the policy of detente, confining himself to accusations against the Carter and 
Reagan administrations. Not surprisingly, it also seems that Reagan was 
Gromyko's least favorite American President. 
</P>
<P>
Gromyko does not openly refer to this, but I assume that his dislike for Reagan 
stems from his realization that Reagan is almost a mirror image of the old 
Soviet leadership. President Reagan was almost as fanatical in his defense of 
Western institutions -- in his single-minded ideological orientation, in his 
militancy and in his uncompromising readiness to sacrifice all for the sake of 
an idea -- as were the leaders of the Soviet state at the time of its creation. 
</P>
<P>
Gromyko's evaluation of the Nixon-Reagan administrations in general, and of 
Henry Kissinger in particular, are fascinating. While recognizing Kissinger's 
talent, he describes him as a man who had no principles and who kept changing 
positions, always attempting to maintain the greatest possible visibility for 
himself. He correctly concludes that in spite of Kissinger's attempts to join 
the Reagan team willy-nilly by appearing to endorse the prevailing ideology, 
there was no room in the ideological and principled Reagan Administration for a 
man as pragmatic and unprincipled as Kissinger. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to descriptions and discussions of many aspects of foreign policy, 
the reader will find in "Memories" an entire gallery of 20th-Century 
luminaries: kings and princesses, outstanding governmental functionaries and 
movie stars, scientists and writers. In a few cases, the descriptions of the 
people whom Gromyko met are lively and perceptive; this makes the book quite a 
bit more colorful. As a rule, however, Gromyko surrounds his personal and, in 
some cases, very intriguing observations with predictable, black-and-white 
judgments based on the individual's social class, or his attitude toward the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The book's last chapter, dealing with Stalin and written especially for the 
American edition, is of great interest. As a whole, Gromyko's handling and 
discussion of the crimes of Stalin and his inner circle are quite correct, but 
he never manages to answer the questions he himself poses in the chapter: Was 
the road that the country traveled under Stalin's leadership an inevitability? 
Was there a chance, in spite of socialist revolution, to move the country away 
from the principles established by Lenin that led to the cult of an individual? 
</P>
<P>
To answer these two questions correctly he would have had to accept two 
important premises which did not quite fit with his Weltanschauung. First: Even 
before Stalin, there had been created in post-revolutionary Russia a 
totalitarian regime with an oligarchic ruling system that denied power or 
accumulation of personal possessions to the vast majority of the people. 
Second: After Lenin's death, the struggle for power among the oligarchs, 
without the participation of the people, led to the emergence of a charismatic 
leader who dominated the already existing totalitarian system with the help of 
a repressive-propagandistic apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, no matter how great the desire to blame all evil on Stalin, if we are to 
be objective it must be said that he only completed the structure that had been 
created immediately after the revolution. 
</P>
<P>
I must regretfully admit that for the last 70 years, our politicians regarded 
the outside world, as well as our internal affairs, solely in terms of black or 
white, with no shades of gray. "Memories" exemplifies that attitude. 
</P>
<P>
We can only hope -- for the sake of my country, as well as for the sake of the 
entire world -- that Gromyko's memoirs will be merely a monument to times gone 
by, times we hope will never return.

ACCELERATED EMOTIONS IN THE ERA OF AIDS; 
</P>
<P>
AFTERLIFE BY PAUL MONETTE (CROWN: $18.95; 288 PP.; 0-517-57339-3) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Aram Saroyan, Saroyan's books include The Romantics, Last Rites and Trio. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steven Shaw, who owns a travel agency; Dell Espinoza, who has a landscaping 
business, and Sonny Cevathas, a hustler with New Age leanings, all are likely 
to die of the same disease they have just seen take the lives of their lovers. 
</P>
<P>
"Afterlife" by Paul Monette, who wrote the memoir "Borrowed Time" about the 
death of his own lover, is an affecting novel of gay mid-life in the epoch of 
AIDS. Monette's prose has an engrossing, loose fluency as he tracks his three 
AIDS "widowers," each trying to come to terms with his loss and get on with 
what life is left to him. The three frequently converge at Steven's house in 
the Hollywood Hills along with flames and female friends and co-workers for the 
support they aren't likely to find in their actual families. 
</P>
<P>
The central figure is Steven, who has gained 30 pounds since the death of his 
lover, Victor, and no longer is interested in sex. Although he is a pivotal 
figure in the book's plot, Dell, a Mexican immigrant outraged by a local 
televangelist on a vendetta against gays, is sketched only with the broadest 
strokes. Sonny, too, barely comes to life, a narcissistic cartoon. Monette 
wisely spends most of his time on Steven, a character whose generous sympathy 
for the others never obscures his own aches and foibles. 
</P>
<P>
Slowly coming back to life, Steven discovers himself drawn to Mark Inman, a 
former TV star who now is the personal manager of Lou Ciotta, a macho coke 
freak who rules the Wednesday night TV lineup the way Cosby rules Thursday. 
Inman lives a double life: nominally straight in his official persona, 
escorting starlets to the Emmy Awards; promiscuously gay and uncommitted in his 
off-hours. Then he discovers he too has AIDS, and when his boss rattles 
impatiently, awaiting a million-dollar check to buy a racehorse on a whim, 
Inman insults him and walks off his job. 
</P>
<P>
Reconsidering his position, he brings Steven along on a rapprochement visit to 
the palatial Hollywood estate of the Ciottas. In a wonderful scene, the TV 
star's street-smart wife, Angela, takes Steven for a tour of the house while 
her husband and his erstwhile manager confer. Lou has tried to be cool about 
Mark's sudden coming out, but Angela, who has disrobed in her enormous walk-in 
closet so she can try out her evening dress on Steven, seems genuinely at ease. 
</P>
<P>
" 'You're so good for Mark,' she said with vivid good cheer. 'I never seen him 
so relaxed.' 
</P>
<P>
" 'Really, it's not what you think. We're more like . . . brothers or 
something.' 
</P>
<P>
"She faced him again, naked except for the black panties. 'Don't tell me about 
love,' she offered. 'I'm Italian. It's the national sport.' 
</P>
<P>
" 'Oh, I love him all right. Whatever that means.' Steven tried to sound breezy 
-- tried too hard. 'But gay men are very weird about sex. They can't do it with 
people they like.' " 
</P>
<P>
The issue here, in essence the fear of intimacy, isn't unfamiliar to the terms 
of straight relationships, and it's one measure of "Afterlife" that its story 
-- aside from the particulars of erotic play, about which Monette is helpfully 
both specific and more or less routine -- has so broad a resonance. 
</P>
<P>
In perhaps the book's most telling and moving scene, Mark, knowing his days are 
numbered but showing no external signs yet, visits his father, a jaunty widower 
named Rob, in his Florida condo in a retirement complex, and lets go with his 
double-whammy: He's gay, and he's tested positive for the AIDS virus. The old 
man, who has fallen in love again with a nice lady named Roz, bears the news 
with surprising grace, and then asks Mark about his new friend. 
</P>
<P>
" 'It won't work, Dad. I'm not attracted to him.' 
</P>
<P>
"Rob made an impatient waving motion, determined not to let the kid off the 
hook. 'How old is he? He's your age?' Mark nodded curtly. 'Good, good,' said 
Rob, as if the numbers were very important here. 'And he's got this virus too?' 
</P>
<P>
" 'Uh-huh. He buried his lover last year.' 
</P>
<P>
" 'Well, then, he knows,' retorted the father, his ruddy face beaming with 
satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Knows what?' Mark bit the question off, not quite sure what he was angry at. 
</P>
<P>
" 'That's all there is, son. Someone to love. You ask anybody here.' And he 
gestured grandly out over the Pitch'n'Putt, but also included the mid-rise 
condos banked on every side, full of seniors in lonely efficiencies. 'They've 
either been married forty years, and they're holding on to what little time 
they got left, or they're widowed and only half-alive. The lucky ones are like 
Roz and me, we get another chance. We know it's not for long. Two years, three 
years -- just like you say. But it's all there is, so you'll take even a 
little.' " 
</P>
<P>
AIDS paradoxically has telescoped the generations: The old widower is quite 
sure that the information he's passing along to his son already is known by his 
son's friend Steven, a young widower. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing they have the virus that has claimed the lives of their lovers, the 
protagonists of "Afterlife" move variously toward some kind of absolute value. 
Sonny takes his cues from a New Age guru whom Angela recommends. Dell becomes a 
gay radical urban guerrilla. And Steven claims with Mark the victory of letting 
their seasoned, humane awareness of one another lead them all the way into 
love. 
</P>
<P>
Their lessons in life accelerated, just as their mortal cycle has been 
shortened by this new Black Plague, they are able to achieve the only real 
happy ending around. Their story makes "Afterlife" a radiant book.

THE PHILOSOPHY OF DOG &amp; MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by GARY SOTO 
</P>
<P>
Stray dogs come with the rain, 
</P>
<P>
Two hours before the garbage men 
</P>
<P>
And their elephant noise of truck 
</P>
<P>
Crushing eggshell and tuna can, 
</P>
<P>
Light bulbs with their bleak rattle. 
</P>
<P>
Or so I hear. 
</P>
<P>
I struggle into slippers, 
</P>
<P>
Part the curtain: a tall dog, 
</P>
<P>
Paws up on the heap, is 
</P>
<P>
Working on a sour casserole, 
</P>
<P>
The noodles marching into his mouth, 
</P>
<P>
And a moist nose sniffing 
</P>
<P>
For chicken bone and week-old stew, 
</P>
<P>
For pie tins with buttery crust. 
</P>
<P>
I've never seen happiness 
</P>
<P>
Over a bone with little meat, 
</P>
<P>
Happiness in rain. This 
</P>
<P>
Is what I want, to be up before light, 
</P>
<P>
To be in rain with garbage men 
</P>
<P>
On the back porch, I snap 
</P>
<P>
A finger, call 'Here boy,' 
</P>
<P>
And the dog throws down its ears, 
</P>
<P>
Ashamed to be caught eating. 
</P>
<P>
I show him the pink emptiness of my palm, 
</P>
<P>
But what am I to him? He doesn't know me. 
</P>
<P>
I'm a man in a robe, not a friend 
</P>
<P>
Of green alleys and poor days, 
</P>
<P>
A man in slippers clomping 
</P>
<P>
Pathetically down wet stairs. 
</P>
<P>
Hurried love trots away on three legs, 
</P>
<P>
The hurt paw touching ground 
</P>
<P>
Only when he looks back. 
</P>

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: BLACK MEN BY HAKI R. MADHUBUTI (THIRD WORLD PRESS, 7524 S.

<P>
This book is a call for serious Afrikan American men to 
</P>
<P>
stand tall and dare to be great, 
</P>
<P>
dare to move beyond the limited ideas of others, 
</P>
<P>
dare to think for yourselves, for the future. 
</P>
<P>
dare to conceive a world where you are more than a consumer, 
</P>
<P>
a buyer 
</P>
<P>
a clown in purple 
</P>
<P>
wearing odd clothes finding glory in not being 
</P>
<P>
black. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Author Haki R. Madhubuti offers this poem in the introduction to his book about 
black men. He goes on to dare black men "to be beauty, dare to be creative 
first, dare to be husbands and fathers, to be quiet life fighters with a smile 
. . . dare." 
</P>
<P>
Madhubuti uses a variety of approaches -- poetic verses along with essays, 
interviews and biographical sketches -- to paint a startling portrait of black 
manhood, black family and black male-female relationships. His interview with a 
black Chicago police officer about his encounters with his own community -- and 
the overall attitude of young black males on the streets of that city -- offer 
insight into the desperate plight of young black Americans. In the tradition of 
Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, Madhubuti proposes solutions to the ills 
that plague black Americans through the restoration of the family unit and the 
development of an autonomous economic community. 
</P>
<P>
Though some of Madhubuti's accusations against white Americans may seem 
questionable to the reader, such as his acceptance of the argument that the 
AIDS virus was developed by the World Health Organization, his book does 
contain concrete and practical advice on everything from finances to diet and 
exercise. 
</P>
<P>
Madhubuti's analysis of black America is frank and earnest, and does not shy 
away from calling into account current black leaders. He points out that black 
leaders in this country seem to be above reproach and criticism. Nor does he 
shy away from the issue of the strong black female, stating emphatically that 
it is the black woman who has held the culture together. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone interested in viewing the black male struggle from the inside should 
read this book. Bruce Bean

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: DOWN AND OUT IN AMERICA THE ORIGINS OF HOMELESSNESS BY 
PETER H. ROSSI (UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS: $15.95; 282 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
There's no mystery about it: Homeless people are homeless because they are very 
poor. "Only" a quarter of a million Americans lack any shelter at all, says 
Peter H. Rossi, a sociology professor who studied Chicago's homeless in 1986, 
but 4 million to 7 million others are so poor that almost anything can shove 
them over the edge: an illness, a fire, a rent hike, the snapping of already 
tenuous family ties. 
</P>
<P>
"The pool of extremely poor persons that the literally homeless are drawn from 
has increased enormously since 1970," Rossi says. The homeless themselves are 
poorer. During the post-World War II boom, the dwindling Skid Rows of U.S. 
cities held mostly elderly white men who lived in cheap hotels. Today's 
homeless are younger and include more blacks, women and children. They find 
less work than their predecessors, earn much less money and, priced out of what 
little low-income housing remains, are much more likely to live in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
This is a dry, scholarly study, complete with graphs and clubfooted prose, but 
Rossi is far from detached. He surveys the history of homelessness in the 
United States, summarizes other studies, defines his terms, fusses over 
methodology, explains how the difficult task of counting and interviewing the 
homeless was accomplished, corrects certain stereotypes (not all homeless 
people, or even most of them, are alcoholics or drug addicts or the mentally 
ill) -- all in order to shake us out of our detachment. It's useless to haggle 
over the exact number of homeless people, he maintains (though he can haggle 
with the best of them), if that keeps us from solving the real problem: 
poverty. 
</P>
<P>
A solution can be reached, Rossi argues. Social Security and other programs 
have greatly reduced poverty among the elderly. We can do the same for the 
homeless and near-homeless through public-sector jobs, co-op housing and higher 
welfare benefits. Yet the elaborate documentation of this book is, in a sense, 
an acknowledgement that the will for such an effort is lacking. Policy makers, 
strapped for funds, would no doubt prefer that the homeless remain a mystery. 
Rossi tries to take away that excuse. Michael Harris

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: TO SCHOOL THROUGH THE FIELDS AN IRISH COUNTRY CHILDHOOD BY 
ALICE TAYLOR (ST. MARTIN'S PRESS: $14.95; 151 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For anyone in need of a quick vacation, Alice Taylor's memoir of her childhood 
in County Cork will do as well as an afternoon spent sitting in a field of 
grass high enough to blot out the skyscrapers. A best seller in Ireland ("where 
scribblers are ten a penny," the London Daily Mail reminded readers), "To 
School Through the Fields" is composed of vignettes, character sketches and 
poems that evoke a world of warmth, security and wonder at God's creation. 
</P>
<P>
A special mass said at a poor neighbor's house sticks in the child's memory not 
only because of its beauty but also because "in the middle of the last 
blessing, the curate exclaimed, with extra vehemence, 'Christ!' " -- an escaped 
hen had pecked him through the makeshift altar cloth. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's was a quiet corner of the world, so tucked away in the countryside 
that "lorry drivers dreaded our farm, and one cranky individual once poked his 
head out of his cab at my father and demanded: 'Does the Almighty God know that 
people live down here?' " But Taylor's telling makes the world of her village 
universal, and sets her firmly in that mysteriously potent Irish storytelling 
tradition. Sonja Bolle

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: BILLY BATHGATE BY E.L. DOCTOROW (HARPER &amp; ROW: $5.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY SOTO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his latest best seller, E. L. Doctorow offers a diverting study of the 
seductive power of evil. The title character, a boy from the Bronx slums, 
weasels his way into a job as errand boy to a fictionalized version of mobster 
Dutch Schultz. 
</P>
<P>
Schultz escorts Billy through the vicious, corrupt world of organized crime in 
the 1930s and shows him that a capacity for monstrous evil and genuine kindness 
often coexist. But the impulsive, violent Schultz, who rose to power during 
Prohibition, fails to realize that he has become an anachronism: The future 
belongs to Billy and a more subtle generation of con men. Although the ending, 
in which a thrill-seeking heiress returns from a long absence to present Billy 
with their child, seems more than a little improbable, "Billy Bathgate" is a 
skillful work by one of the country's most popular novelists.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE UNIVERSAL MYTHS HEROES, GODS, TRICKSTERS AND OTHERS BY 
ALEXANDER ELIOT (MERIDIAN: $8.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY SOTO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In this useful reference volume, Alexander Eliot has collected myths from 
various countries and grouped them around recurring themes -- Death and 
Rebirth, Monsters and Mythic Beasts, Bringers of Magic and the Arts, etc. The 
Greeks and the tribes of the Guinea coast of Africa both had legends about a 
ram with a shining golden fleece. 
</P>
<P>
The ancient Hebrews told stories about the fallen angel Azazel, who taught 
humanity the art of working with metal, while the Buryat tribes of Mongolia 
traced the knowledge to Boshintoi, the blacksmith of the solar forge. It's 
interesting to compare these stories, but Eliot's brief synopses lack the 
poetry that gives myths their power and beauty. The introductory essays by 
Joseph Campbell and Mircea Eliade seem more immediate and compelling.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE WICKED PAVILLION BY DAWN POWELL (VINTAGE: $8.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY SOTO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A slyly satirical tale of the New York art world during the early '50s, before 
skyrocketing prices completed its corruption. Dawn Powell offers a gallery of 
tongue-in-cheek portraits from that rarefied milieu: the successful artists and 
the artists manques; a vulgar patron who expects a sexual return for her 
subsidies; shady dealers; an assortment of critics, drones and hangers-on. 
</P>
<P>
The Cafe Julien, a tiny gourmet restaurant on Washington Square, provides the 
bond for this diverse assortment of self-styled Bohemians. 
</P>
<P>
But the real hero of the story is Manhattan, when it was a cleaner and safer 
place to live. Powell obviously is aware that her love for the city and its 
artistic demimonde is more foolish than wise, but she never lets that 
realization spoil her nostalgic evocation of a more innocent era.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: REFLECTIONS IN A JAUNDICED EYE BY FLORENCE KING (ST.

These essays confirm Florence King's reputation as one of the wittiest 
curmudgeons in the United States: Her escutcheon undoubtedly bears the motto 
"with malice toward all." She mercilessly excoriates the follies of American 
popular culture, from portentous magazine articles on the role of the American 
male to the "pseudo-feminist myth" of the caring workplace. 
</P>
<P>
A discussion of contemporary literature includes a devastating assesment of 
John Updike ("reading him is like cutting through whale blubber with embroidery 
scissors") and a hilarious spoof of "Gone With the Wind," rewritten in 
contemporary jargon ("Frankly, my dear, it doesn't impact me"). The delightful 
cynicism of "Reflections" provides a welcome antidote to the blandly optimistic 
catch phrases and sound bites of America in the early '90s.

ASSEMBLY RACE DRAWS BIG YAWN FROM THE PUBLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For proof of the relative obscurity of next month's special 78th state Assembly 
District primary, Republican Jeff Marston needs to look no farther than his own 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
As he campaigns door to door, the reaction of many voters, Marston noted, has 
been along the lines of, "Aren't you about three months too late?" Even more 
telling, some of Marston's own campaign workers think that they are being 
pushed into high gear several months too early. 
</P>
<P>
"They say things like, 'Shouldn't we wait until May or so to do these things?' 
" said Sara Katz, one of Marston's consultants. "And we say, 'Well, uh, if we 
don't win in April, there won't be a campaign to worry about in May.' " 
</P>
<P>
Marston's experience dramatizes the stark contrast between the April 10 contest 
for Democratic state Sen. Lucy Killea's former Assembly seat and the two 
high-profile special state legislative elections held in San Diego County late 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
While Killea's 39th state Senate District race in December and the 76th 
Assembly District race won by Republican Tricia Hunter in October both drew 
national publicity as referendums on abortion, next month's eight-candidate 
campaign has received little more than cursory attention, even within local 
political circles. 
</P>
<P>
"For most people, there's not even an awareness that there's a race going on," 
Democrat Howard Wayne said. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the debate-a-day schedule and saturation press coverage that 
typified the two earlier special races, there have been few candidate forums 
and only occasional news stories on this spring's contest. As a result, fund 
raising has been sluggish, forcing some major candidates who initially talked 
of spending $200,000-plus to scale back their primary budgets by half. 
</P>
<P>
"Like everyone else, we've been revising our budget weekly, and it keeps 
dropping," said former Democratic San Diego City Councilman Mike Gotch, the 
race's consensus front-runner by virtue of name identification that easily 
eclipses that of the other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
The causes for the 78th District campaign's low profile begin with the absence 
of a major divisive issue such as that which dominated last year's special 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
Except for Democratic long-shot A. L. (Bud) Brooks, all of the major candidates 
-- Republicans as well as Democrats -- are abortion rights advocates, defusing 
that emotional subject as a campaign issue. And, although there are differences 
in the candidates' priorities and positions on some topics, Republican Jane 
Ramshaw notes that, on most major issues, "The message is pretty much the 
same." 
</P>
<P>
"There aren't any issues that are grabbing voters by the throat, throwing them 
to the ground and demanding that they pay attention," added GOP candidate Helen 
Rowe. "Some major issues such as gun control and abortion have quieted down. 
The volatility just isn't there." 
</P>
<P>
That lack of controversy, combined with what some consultants refer to as 
"voter fatigue" in the face of the third special state legislative race here 
within six months, is expected to exacerbate the low turnout typically found in 
special elections. With the Assembly race being the only election on the April 
ballot, most candidates expect a turnout of only about 20% of the district's 
nearly 195,000 voters, despite their aggressive solicitation of absentee 
ballots. 
</P>
<P>
From the outset, Gotch has been widely viewed as the candidate to beat -- a 
perception reinforced by the recent withdrawal of fellow Democrat Byron 
Georgiou, who dropped out of the race to challenge Democratic Rep. Jim Bates in 
June. Though clearly an underdog to the better-known Gotch, Georgiou was the 
top fund-raiser in the race and had compiled valuable political IOUs through 
his longtime party activism -- factors that caused him to be seen as 
potentially Gotch's most formidable opponent. 
</P>
<P>
However, even without Georgiou in the race -- even though his name remains on 
the ballot -- neither Gotch nor any other candidate is expected to surpass the 
50% vote margin needed in the primary to avoid a June runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Under the unorthodox procedures governing special elections, all candidates of 
all parties will appear on a single ballot in April. If no candidate receives a 
50%-plus majority in the primary, the top vote-getters of each party will 
compete in June for the remaining six months in Killea's unexpired term. 
</P>
<P>
On the same June ballot, the same candidates -- along with at least some of the 
losers from April -- also will compete in the normal state legislative primary 
for their parties' nomination for the two-year term that will be contested in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
That prospect of a rare "double election" in June creates the possibility of a 
split decision, with one candidate winning the special primary but losing the 
normal primary. Though the candidates regard that possibility as remote, the 
fact that the two contests will be waged before markedly different 
constituencies -- all voters would cast ballots in the special runoff, while 
partisan electorates will decide the primaries -- increases the slim chance 
that the two races could have different victors. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the inclusion of both a special runoff and a normal primary on the 
same ballot may, understandably, confuse voters, prompting some to think that 
they must vote for different candidates in the two races. 
</P>
<P>
Even as they ponder the race's potentially perplexing format in June, the 
candidates have focused their energies on the April election, the first step 
toward their goal of a double victory two months later in the 78th District, 
which stretches along the coast from Ocean Beach to Pacific Beach, extending 
inland to the Miramar Naval Air Station in the north, south to downtown San 
Diego and east to East San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Gotch's superior name recognition has cast a long shadow over the campaign, 
significantly influencing the strategies of Republicans and Democrats alike. 
The three Republicans in the primary -- Marston, Ramshaw and Rowe -- treat 
Gotch as the presumptive Democratic nominee and have structured their 
respective campaigns accordingly, portraying themselves as the party's best 
hope to offset his advantages in June. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're talking about here is who can beat Mike Gotch -- that's whom we 
have to assume we're going to be up against," Ramshaw told the San Diego 
Republican Businesswomen. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, both Ramshaw, an insurance broker, and Rowe, a lawyer, extol the 
virtues of their private-sector experience, with Ramshaw billing herself as 
"someone who can close the deal." Meanwhile, Marston, a one-time aide to former 
San Diego City Councilwoman Gloria McColl and Sen. S. I. Hayakawa (R-Calif.), 
argues that his public service provided a better training ground. 
</P>
<P>
If the Republicans all but concede Gotch a spot in the runoff, the other 
Democratic candidates, for obvious reasons, clearly do not. In particular, 
deputy state attorney Wayne has spent nearly as much time raising questions 
about Gotch's credentials as he has on explaining his own -- arguing, for 
example, that Gotch's eight-year City Council record would make him a more 
inviting target for the Republicans in June and November.

Wayne, relatively well known within Democratic circles because of his lengthy 
political dues-paying service for the local party, has been especially critical 
of Gotch's environmental record, despite the fact that the former councilman 
has been endorsed by the Sierra Club. In his public appearances, Wayne 
consistently reminds audiences that Gotch voted for the controversial Belmont 
Park development and went to work for prominent developer Doug Manchester after 
leaving the council in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike Gotch used to be an environmentalist, but he's changed," one Wayne mailer 
says. "Mike Gotch's giveaway of Belmont Park is just a hint of what could come 
if he is elected to the Assembly." The detailing of Wayne's own qualifications 
in that eight-page brochure is limited to two brief sentences: "As a deputy 
attorney general, I've prosecuted corrupt politicians. I will never give away 
public park land to private developers." 
</P>
<P>
The two other Democrats in the race -- county probation officer Brooks and 
lawyer Judith Abeles -- have, of necessity, focused on trying to increase their 
own low name identification. But they, too, occasionally, take verbal potshots 
at Gotch. 
</P>
<P>
The eighth candidate in the race, Peace and Freedom Party member Jane Rocio 
Evans, a teacher, is little more than a political footnote, and concedes that 
she is running primarily to help publicize her party's platform. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that he has little to gain from a protracted debate over his own 
record, Gotch has taken a dismissive tack toward his opponents' attacks, 
typically waving them off by noting that "this preoccupation with 
second-guessing" underlines the fact that he is the only candidate with a 
public record. 
</P>
<P>
"The significant difference in this race is experience," Gotch said. "As the 
only one who has served in an elective capacity, I'm in the best position to 
hit the ground running." 
</P>
<P>
The other first-time candidates, however, have proudly worn their self-styled 
citizen-politician images as a badge of honor, hoping to tap into the public's 
general disdain toward politics. 
</P>
<P>
With rare exceptions, the candidates' standard stump speeches are long on 
generalities but short on specifics and are remarkably similar in their core 
themes. Protect the environment, improve education and health care, reduce 
crime and drug problems, gain more state funding for San Diego -- these and 
other broad, generally noncontroversial goals have marked the campaign 
rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the candidates favor Proposition 111, a June ballot measure that would 
double the current 9-cents-per-gallon gasoline tax over five years to finance 
an $18.5-billion highway and transportation improvement program. Most also 
support a ballot proposition that would shift responsibility for the state's 
decennial legislative redistricting from the Legislature to an independent 
commission, a proposal that supporters contend would curtail gerrymandering. 
</P>
<P>
One notable aberration from the campaign's homogeneous tone involves Democrat 
Abeles' proposal that the use of drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamines be 
legalized, with the state regulating their production and distribution, as well 
as that of "legal drugs" such as liquor. Government control not only would 
raise public revenue, Abeles argues, but also could decrease drug use over the 
long term by minimizing dealers' economic incentives and users' "rebel 
behavior." 
</P>
<P>
"Legalizing drugs would take a lot of the punch out of their use -- forbidden 
fruit is always more attractive," Abeles said. "Besides, it's the grossest 
hypocrisy to have a 'Just Say No' ad followed by a beer ad. Alcohol and tobacco 
are just as bad as some illegal drugs." Abeles, a former ACLU staff attorney, 
said she refuses to subscribe to any magazine that carries tobacco 
advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks' anti-abortion position also distinguishes him from the field, but the 
other major candidates' abortion rights advocacy has largely removed that issue 
from the campaign. However, it remains a vital component of Brooks' strategy, 
which revolves around the possibility of abortion opponents coalescing behind 
his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
With the primary scheduled to fall one week after California's first execution 
in 23 years -- the planned April 3 execution of Robert Alton Harris, convicted 
in the 1978 killing of two San Diego teen-agers -- the death penalty has been a 
frequent topic in the campaign. Abeles and Peace and Freedom candidate Evans 
oppose capital punishment, but the other candidates have seemingly tried to 
outdo one another with tough talk on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Charles) Mansons and Harrises of this world . . . should not be released 
on society, and society shouldn't have the burden of incarcerating them for the 
rest of their lives," Gotch said, typifying the rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego officials' by-now familiar lament over the fact that the county ranks 
57th out of the state's 58 counties in per capita general revenue from 
Sacramento also has been a constant at campaign forums. And, though they have 
done little beyond offering platitudes about working harder to increase San 
Diego's share of state funding, each of the candidates has striven to find an 
angle on the popular issue. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats, for example, argue that, because their party controls the 
Legislature, the county's case would be strengthened by keeping the 78th 
District seat in their hands. Republicans respond curtly that the county's 
shortchanging occurred while the seat was in Democratic hands. Others search 
for catchy phrases to dramatize the issue, such as Ramshaw's offering: "The 
nation of Los Angeles and the Kingdom of San Francisco are holding us hostage." 
</P>
<P>
Injecting both candor and political reality into that discussion, Marston 
emphasizes that the outcome in the 78th District is unlikely to have an 
appreciable impact on San Diego's battle for more state funds. 
</P>
<P>
"It's naive to think that legislators from L.A. and the Bay Area are going to 
go back to their constituencies and say, 'We're going to cut back on our 
counties' funding because we've been shafting San Diego for years,' " Marston 
said. The ultimate solution to that problem, Marston adds, probably lies either 
in the county's lawsuits against the state or in a "Fair Share Initiative" that 
would adjust state tax funding formulas. 
</P>
<P>
"All politicians like to act as if they're going to be a savior," Marston said. 
"But there are times when you have to admit it's going to take a lot more than 
any one person to solve a problem. And this is one of those times."

EX-SCHOOL WORKER HELD IN BOY'S DEATH; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: A FORMER CHILD-CARE EMPLOYEE WHO HAD WORKED AT THE SLAIN CHILD'S SCHOOL 
IS ARRESTED IN CONNECTION WITH THE GRISLY SLAYING.

<P>
A former employee of a PTA child-care program for latchkey children at a 
Northridge elementary school was arrested Saturday in connection with the 
grisly death of an 8-year-old student, whose body was found gagged and burned 
beyond recognition in a field south of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators are calling the death of Paul Bailly, who had apparently been 
handcuffed before he was set on fire, one of the most disturbing and violent 
homicides in Ventura County in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, Greg Smith, 21, of Canoga Park, was arrested on suspicion of 
murder and held without bond in the Ventura County Jail on Saturday after 
Ventura County sheriff's investigators said they found evidence linking him to 
the crime. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was fired about three weeks ago for "inappropriate behavior" on his job 
supervising latchkey children at Darby Elementary School in Northridge, 
homicide investigators said. They declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
The Northridge boy had been set ablaze with a flammable liquid, investigators 
said. A pair of handcuffs, which appeared to have been used on the youngster, 
were found near the body in the Santa Susana Knolls area near Simi Valley about 
noon Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The coroner's office said it had not yet been determined whether the boy was 
already dead when his body was set on fire or if he died as a result of his 
burns. A motive for the crime has not been identified, detectives said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been doing this for 30 years and I've never had one of this nature," said 
Dr. Warren Lovell, chief medical examiner for Ventura County. "People think 
that I'd be used to it, but you never get used to something like this." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the boy disappeared about 7 a.m. Friday after his mother, 
Mary Bailly, dropped him off at the elementary school, where he was enrolled in 
the school-sponsored child-care program. 
</P>
<P>
When she returned to pick him up at 5 p.m., the youngster was gone. School 
officials said the boy never showed up for class, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police called Ventura County investigators Friday night to report 
that they thought the youngster found in the field was the child missing from 
the school, Ventura Sheriff's Lt. Joe F. Harwell said. 
</P>
<P>
Weary investigators worked throughout the night searching for clues and 
questioning school officials in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Harwell said investigators learned that Smith had been seen around the school 
after he had been fired and identified him as their prime suspect. They said 
they staked out his house until about 5:30 a.m., when he came out and got into 
his car. 
</P>
<P>
"He saw the officers and he ran several stop signs," Harwell said. "He was then 
taken into custody." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County investigators said it was the worst homicide they have seen 
since 2-year-old Amy Sue Sietz of Camarillo was found strangled and sexually 
molested in the driveway of a Topanga Canyon home in 1978. The child's killer, 
Theodore Frank, was given the death sentence. He is awaiting execution. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of people very shaken up," said Vincent W. France, a Ventura 
County Sheriff's Department commander who is overseeing the investigation into 
the Bailly killing. "You think you've seen everything, and then you learn you 
haven't. This is one of those crimes that hits home to everyone who has 
children. It's a horrible crime." 
</P>
<P>
France said authorities found the boy after two motorists reported a brush fire 
near the Black Canyon Road south of Santa Susana Pass about 11:50 a.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A car matching the description of Smith's was also spotted in the area, Harwell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
When firefighters arrived at the scene, they found the child face up near a 
small tree not far from the road, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was apparent that he was brought there against his will," Harwell said. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime you're dealing with the death of an 8-year-old, it's hard not to 
become affected emotionally -- in this case especially because of the nature of 
the death," he continued. "It's a terrible catastrophe for the family." 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday afternoon, two investigators from the Ventura County district 
attorney's office were escorted through the Darby Street School complex. They 
declined to discuss the case. 
</P>
<P>
Darby Principal Sidney L. Yukelson expressed shock at the killing and said a 
crisis team of school psychologists will be on hand Monday to help children 
deal with the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just horrified. Absolutely devastated," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yukelson said Smith had been employed by the Parent Teacher Assn. in a school 
program that leases two rooms on school grounds. He said he did not know why 
the man was fired and referred a reporter to local PTA officials, who could not 
immediately be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The principal, who has worked at the school since August, said he did not know 
the slain boy. 
</P>
<P>
A resident at the Northridge apartment complex in the 9500 block of Reseda 
Boulevard where the boy had lived with his mother said she had talked to them 
on a few occasions. The woman asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
"She was always picking him up at school. I used to see him at 3 o'clock every 
single day," she said. "She was always with him. I never saw her without him. 
She picked him up religiously every day. 
</P>
<P>
"I swam with him," she added. "He used to come and put his foot in the water 
and I'd laugh. All I used to say to him was, 'I'm glad school is over today for 
you.' He was a lovely boy. Oh, my God. I feel really bad." 
</P>
<P>
The woman said that when she took out her trash at 11:30 p.m. Friday she saw a 
policeman walking through the apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
"Why would they take a little boy like that or any child? Oh, my God," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Another resident of the complex, Gary Horn, expressed dismay at the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
"It just horrifies me," said Horn, who was playing miniature golf with his 
7-year-old son at the complex. "You think of Northridge as a pretty safe 
neighborhood. I guess it's a sign of the times. You never know when anybody's 
safe. It can happen anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
A resident of Black Canyon Road, where the body was found in Ventura County, 
said Saturday that she was still in shock over the brutal slaying. 
</P>
<P>
"Living up here with nobody around, you definitely get frightened," said Susan 
Vincent, who lives on a ranch near where the body was found. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent, 31, said she has lived in the area for several years. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me sick to my stomach . . . especially a little kid like that. I mean 
that's really unbelievable that they'd take a little kid and light him on fire. 
. . that's sickening. Just to think that somebody would do that to a kid gives 
you the creeps just being up here." 
</P>
<P>
Several area residents attending a Little League baseball game at Knolls Park, 
located at the foot of Black Canyon Road, expressed concern and fear for the 
safety of their children. 
</P>
<P>
"It's scary; I'm horrified," said April Helvig, who came to the park to watch 
one of her three sons play baseball. "I've lived up here six years. I always 
felt safe. I got a little 7-year-old. I would always let him walk down to the 
park by himself for practice. Now I wouldn't let him do that again."

OLD-FASHIONED MARKETPLACE IN FULLERTON IS A CROWD PLEASER; 
</P>
<P>
SHOPPING: CONSUMERS GET THE PICK OF THE CROP AT PARK. BUT IT'S MORE THAN AN

FULLERTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a Wednesday morning at Woodcrest Park and already the customers were 
packed three deep, staring hungrily at rows of fresh fruit and vegetables that 
had been stacked up on tables behind two farm trucks. 
</P>
<P>
When a tin cowbell began clanging at 10:30 a.m. sharp, signaling the start of 
another day's business, the customers began jostling one another and shouting 
their orders in a confusing mix of languages. 
</P>
<P>
Standing behind the tables, Anita Casper and three co-workers moved frantically 
to weigh the produce, sack it and exchange it for money before turning their 
attention to the next customer. 
</P>
<P>
And through it all, Casper was smiling serenely. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a s-l-o-w day," said Casper, an employee of a Corona farm company. 
"You should see it when it's busy. I mean, sometimes you can't even see beyond 
the table." 
</P>
<P>
Casper's produce stand is part of the Fullerton Certified Farmer's Market, one 
of the more colorful and unusual public events in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Every Wednesday between 10:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m., Woodcrest Park at 
Orangethorpe and Richman avenues is transformed into an outdoor market, with 
more than two dozen growers from as far away as Fresno and the Mojave Desert 
setting up boxes and crates to sell their produce directly to the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
The fruits and vegetables are freshly picked. The prices are sometimes less 
than in a supermarket. The atmosphere is a throwback to a simpler, more rural 
time when Orange County was an agricultural mecca. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a certain amount of nostalgia in it," said Nancy Jimenez, 
manager of the Orange County Farm Bureau. "Here in Orange County, we used to 
have a lot of the roadside fruit and vegetable stands and that has become a 
thing of the past." 
</P>
<P>
Besides being a place to find fresh, affordable produce, the Fullerton market 
is also a social event, attracting the same customers week after week. 
</P>
<P>
"You get hooked on the market," said Irene Doland, a psychology technician from 
Anaheim who has missed only a handful of Wednesdays at the market since it 
opened about 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Harris, a honey vendor from Pomona, said he is amazed at the mix of ethnic 
groups represented by his customers. Harris said that each market has a 
distinct ethnic identity and that Fullerton's seems to be heavily Eastern 
European. 
</P>
<P>
"It's basically English as a foreign language at this kind of a market," Harris 
said. "I deal in 25 different languages, so it makes it tough to communicate." 
</P>
<P>
The Fullerton Certified Farmer's Market is one of two outdoor food markets in 
the county operated as state-regulated bazaars. The other one is every Thursday 
at the Orange County Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa, sponsored by the Orange County 
Farm Bureau. The Fullerton market is operated by a nonprofit association made 
up of growers and local residents. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 125 such markets statewide certified by the California 
Department of Food and Agriculture. The markets, intended primarily for small 
growers, are operated by cities and business groups. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a way for the agricultural industry and the home gardener to 
distribute to those who want fresh, ripe foods," said John Ellis, deputy 
agricultural commissioner for Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis' agency enforces state law requiring growers in these markets to have 
certificates showing what crops they produce and are allowed to sell. County 
agricultural inspectors also monitor quality by conducting random inspections 
and examining produce for such problems as dirt, insect infestation or frost 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
And with the recent finding of Mediterranean fruit flies throughout the 
Southland, the inspectors also make sure that citrus, avocados, persimmons and 
other fruits vulnerable to infestation by the flies are kept covered in 
quarantined areas. The Fullerton market was added to the quarantine list Jan. 
10 after two Medflies were found in Westminster and Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from fruits and vegetables, fresh fish, eggs and honey are hawked at the 
Fullerton market. 
</P>
<P>
Carefully removing jars of honey and arranging them neatly on a cloth-covered 
table, Harris, the beekeeper from Pomona, said he makes the rounds of a number 
of Southland markets. 
</P>
<P>
"They're great for the small beekeeper like me," he said as customers began to 
cluster around his honey stand a few moments before it opened. "The large 
honey-packers have all the store business sewn up." 
</P>
<P>
Forest E. Dull -- an 83-year-old back-yard farmer from Whittier who was the 
first person penalized under a new state law banning removal of produce from a 
Medfly quarantine area -- earlier in the day had set up a stand of macadamia 
nuts and nursery plants behind the open trunk of his 1955 Packard. 
</P>
<P>
Dull, a 10-year regular at the Fullerton market, said he normally sells citrus 
products too, but was unable to that day because his one-acre growing area has 
been put under quarantine. 
</P>
<P>
"I always move some," Dull said of his macadamia nuts. "But I never move great 
quantities because they're not for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
The amount of money made by the growers ranges greatly, with successful 
operations earning as much as $500 a day while the less fortunate make only 
$50, said Mona Amoon, manager of the Fullerton market. Each vendor, Amoon said, 
has to turn over 5% of his daily take to the Fullerton Certified Farmer's 
Market. 
</P>
<P>
Customers can expect to save between 20% and 30% by shopping for produce at a 
certified farmers market, said Terri Cronin, a direct-marketing specialist for 
the Department of Food and Agriculture in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
But Cronin said that in Southern California the price savings are less -- and 
practically non-existent on some products -- because of the region's status as 
a year-round produce capital where fruits and vegetables are abundant. 
</P>
<P>
The real appeal for a certified market, Cronin added, is in being able to get 
products so fresh. Customers at the Fullerton market agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fresher than a supermarket," said Patricia DiPinto, a retired teacher 
from Fullerton who was at the market with her husband, Lawrence. "And you can 
tell it doesn't have all kinds of preservatives because it spoils faster." 
</P>
<P>
There is a darker side of a farmer's market. Last year, during the spring corn 
season, Casper said so many customers were jostling forward that their weight 
collapsed a table, scattering ears of corn in all directions. 
</P>
<P>
Vendors also complained that customers often try to barter prices, even though 
they are non-negotiable. Amoon said shoplifters also fill up sacks of produce 
and saunter off while the vendor is busy. 
</P>
<P>
But vendors say the market is a congenial place -- one, they say, that 
constantly draws praise from new customers.

SOVIETS RECEIVE THE RED CARPET TREATMENT AT CONVAIR PLANT; 
</P>
<P>
INSPECTIONS: GENERAL DYNAMICS' OFFICIALS BONED UP ON THE LANGUAGE IN PROTOCOL 
NECESSARY TO COMFORTABLY HOUSE THEIR VISITORS WITH ONLY FOUR HOURS' NOTICE.

<TEXT>
<P>
When George W. Roos, an executive of General Dynamics' Convair Division, 
learned that a 1987 nuclear arms treaty gave the Soviet Union the right to 
conduct spot inspections at the company's massive Plant 19 complex near 
Lindbergh Field, he promptly signed up for Russian-language lessons. 
</P>
<P>
Roos also sent several key employees to a crash course on Soviet affairs at a 
Washington think tank and enrolled himself in an intermediate-range nuclear 
force treaty course at a Washington defense studies institute. 
</P>
<P>
Roos then sat down and wrote a detailed plan on how the corporation could 
handle a visit by the 10-member Soviet verification teams and their escorts 
from various U.S. defense and intelligence agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The inspections, which will continue through 2001, are mandated in the INF 
treaty -- the intermediate-range nuclear forces pact -- that Ronald Reagan and 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed in 1987, according to Lt. Col. Joseph Wagovich, an 
official with the Department of Defense's On Site Inspection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The treaty outlawed the production and use of ground-launched cruise missiles, 
an intermediate-range nuclear delivery system that the United States and the 
Soviet Union had earlier deployed throughout Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union uses inspections to ensure that General Dynamics has not 
reinstated production lines capable of building the deadly ground-launched 
cruise missiles. Convair still produces sea-launched cruise missiles at its 
Kearny Mesa facility, but both the Soviet Union and the United States agreed in 
1987 to stop production of the missiles that are capable of delivering nuclear 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The treaty gives the Soviet Union the highly unusual right to conduct snap 
inspections at Plant 19 and four other military weapons facilities in the 
western United States, as well as at 26 bases and factories in the eastern 
United States and Western Europe. Similarly, the treaty gives U.S. inspectors 
access to more than 130 sites in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, Wagovich 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the treaty's terms, U.S. officials are given 24 hours' notice that the 
Soviets want to inspect a facility. 
</P>
<P>
When the Soviets fly into Moffett Field Naval Air Station in the Bay Area, 
American officials know the inspectors will be headed toward one of five bases 
or plants in the West. But according to terms of the treaty, General Dynamics 
officials do not learn that their plant is to be inspected until just four 
hours before the inspection begins. 
</P>
<P>
While the short-notice inspections are designed to prevent chicanery -- U.S. 
inspectors give the same short notice before inspecting Soviet plants -- the 
visits also touch off a frantic flurry of activity, because when the Soviets 
step off a U.S. Air Force C-141 cargo jet at Lindbergh Field, it is Convair's 
responsibility to provide meals, sleeping quarters, guides and security. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 Soviets, American government officials and General Dynamics employees 
are involved in the inspections. The Department of Defense reimburses the 
company after the inspections. 
</P>
<P>
Convair employees use the four-hour window to ready a small and seldom-used 
complex in a Plant 19 parking lot that serves as home for the Soviets and their 
U.S. counterparts. The complex includes a half dozen trailers that serve as 
sleeping and meeting facilities, lavatories and a large tent where meals are 
served. 
</P>
<P>
A cook from General Dynamics' Kearny Mesa facility sets up a kitchen that turns 
out as many as four meals a day for the visitors during the inspections, which 
can last more than 32 hours. 
</P>
<P>
The inspections, which are governed by complex guidelines attached to the 
treaty, determine how long the Soviets can stay in the plant, what they can 
look at and when they must leave. But the treaty, negotiated at a time when the 
Cold War was still raging, gave little guidance as to whether General Dynamics 
should stick to the strict guidelines or practice some down-home diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
General Dynamics' first thought was that the inspections "could be real bad 
news if improperly handled," said Roos, vice president for human resources at 
General Dynamics' Convair Division. 
</P>
<P>
"Let there be one diplomatic incident, and General Dynamics and everyone else 
involved is in the soup. This (treaty) dates back to the time when, militarily, 
the Russian bear was still a very strong animal," Roos said. 
</P>
<P>
Roos determined that the best way to deal with the treaty-mandated inspections 
was to "make it as pleasant as possible (for the Soviets), to make it a 
non-event. We decided that the best approach is to treat them like . . . 
distinguished guests." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, General Dynamics has gone out of its way to make sure the visitors 
are comfortable. Each visitor is furnished with toothpaste, toothbrushes, 
shampoo, tissues, a San Diego Zoo T-shirt and four stamped post cards featuring 
San Diego scenes. 
</P>
<P>
General Dynamics also "tries to feed them like they've never been fed before," 
Roos said. Past meals have included charcoal-broiled swordfish, cookies and 
"all the fresh fruit you could imagine," Roos said. 
</P>
<P>
General Dynamics also supplies coffee and sodas to inspectors who are in the 
plant complex, and Roos leaves American newspapers and magazines in the 
Soviets' sleeping quarters. The cook has on occasion added borscht to the menu, 
but the company has declined the Soviets' request that vodka be made available. 
</P>
<P>
Roos believes that General Dynamics' initial inspection -- the first the 
Soviets conducted under the INF treaty -- set the tone for future inspections 
in the United States and the Soviet Union. "Word got flashed back (to the 
Soviet Union) that we treated them well," Roos said. 
</P>
<P>
Roos' plan was first tested at 3:30 a.m. on July 3, 1988, when Department of 
Defense officials telephoned General Dynamics to give the company four hours' 
notice of an upcoming inspection. Roos arrived at his office shortly after 5 
a.m., and the Soviet team was on the ground at Lindbergh at 6:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The initial inspection got off to a shaky start when the Soviet team leader, 
who spoke no English, was met by a military officer who spoke no Russian. Roos 
mustered his elementary Russian to greet the inspector, who then broke into a 
broad grin. A defense department translator subsequently handled the 
inspection. 
</P>
<P>
After a one-hour introductory briefing that is required by the treaty, the 
verification teams began to canvass Plant 19, armed with tape measures, 
clipboards and massive scales that weigh components of intermediate-range 
missiles that are capable of delivering nuclear warheads. 
</P>
<P>
The 1.6-million-square-foot Plant 19 complex houses production lines for 
General Dynamics' Convair and Space Systems divisions, as well as various 
Department of Defense agencies. The first inspection took place on a holiday 
weekend, so few employees were at work, Roos said. But production continued 
during two subsequent inspections. 
</P>
<P>
During the three visits so far, the 10-person Soviet delegations have broken 
into two or three teams to canvass the massive plant. They look for the right 
size and shape items used in a ground-launched cruise missile system. 
</P>
<P>
Inspectors are allowed to view only those objects that fall within strictly 
defined "treaty limited dimensions," Wagovich said. 
</P>
<P>
The treaty defines how disputes should be settled. If Soviet inspectors, for 
example, demand that a shipping box be opened, and General Dynamics officials 
decline, a Polaroid-type camera is set up and two photographs are snapped. 
According to the treaty, although the camera is owned by the Soviets, only an 
American can take the photos, Roos said. The photographs are later attached to 
a final report that is issued after the inspection. 
</P>
<P>
When the inspections are over, company officials escort the Soviets back to 
their U.S. Air Force plane at Lindbergh Field, Roos said. General Dynamics then 
closes the temporary village until word of the next inspection is received. 
</P>
<P>
Roos described the visiting team members as professionals who work "incredibly 
hard" considering they endure an 18-hour flight to San Francisco. The 
inspections typically begin within an hour of the Soviet team's arrival and 
continue until 11 p.m. The teams usually are back at work at 4 a.m.

GROWERS PUT THE SQUEEZE ON AVOCADO THEFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Avocado thievery has reached such epidemic proportions in northern San Diego 
County that a statewide avocado commission is planning to contract with the 
county Sheriff's Department to help stem the rustling of the fruit known as 
green gold. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's officials said they at first didn't understand the scope of the 
problem, but, now that they do, after having met with industry representatives, 
they have entered contract negotiations with the quasi-governmental California 
Avocado Commission, which wants three deputies assigned full-time to work on 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary plan calls for deputies not only to patrol North County's 
groves day and night to deter thieves, but to establish sting operations to try 
to nab thieves attempting to sell hot avocados to packing houses and farmers 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies would fill new positions to be financed by the Avocado Commission. 
The commission already has allocated $197,000 to fund the program in San Diego 
County, part of a $743,000 campaign statewide that is funded by avocado growers 
to battle the increasing problem. 
</P>
<P>
Avi Crane, a commission spokesman, said $10 million worth of fruit was stolen 
last year -- about half of that from San Diego County groves -- and the losses 
are expected to increase this year because of the high price that avocados 
fetch at the market. 
</P>
<P>
Growers now receive 80 cents to $1 per pound for avocados at wholesale packing 
houses, and Crane said thieves are willing to get 50 cents on the dollar for 
their stolen fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Some thieves brazenly walk into groves by daylight, secrete themselves in the 
midst of the trees and walk off hours later toting burlap bags, each containing 
90 pounds of avocados, growers say. Others will make their forays under cover 
of darkness, and their presence will not be discovered until the next morning 
when a grower sees his stripped trees -- or perhaps not for days or weeks, when 
the absentee owner finally inspects his trees. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no compensation once the fruit is taken. We have no insurance, and we 
don't get a tax write-off," said Ed Holtz, who has hired private security 
guards to patrol his 50-acre avocado grove in Valley Center 12 hours a night. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if they eventually find stolen fruit, we can't prove it's ours," he said. 
"The stolen fruit still gets in the marketplace, the middleman still gets his 
cut, and we get nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, authorities in Riverside County arrested 10 people and 
seized more than 11,000 pounds of stolen avocados that were being stored in 
Temecula, awaiting distribution to wholesale and retail markets. Authorities 
estimate that 10,000 pounds of stolen avocados daily were being moved by the 
ring. 
</P>
<P>
How does the 42-year-old Holtz, who has been growing avocados 20 years, measure 
the monetary loss of avocados through theft last year? "It was enough money 
that I could otherwise have bought a new car. A nice new car." 
</P>
<P>
Holtz hired private security guards two months ago, after 3,000 pounds of 
avocados were stripped off his trees on each of back-to-back nights, costing 
him $6,000 in lost revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Holtz is now paying $1,000 a week for the security service, but he figures that 
he has to spend some money to save even more. And, although the unarmed guards 
are now routinely chasing would-be thieves off his property, the thieves 
haven't stopped trying. 
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, Holtz said, the guards ran thieves off his groves. But, on 
Thursday, Holtz discovered a cache of empty burlap bags that had been dropped 
off that day in a field across from his groves on Circle R Drive, apparently 
for a theft attempt that night. Indeed, early Friday morning his guards heard 
-- but couldn't see -- men in the groves trying to take fruit off the trees. 
For the second time that week, they were chased off the property. 
</P>
<P>
Holtz says he doesn't ask his guards to capture the thieves -- partly because 
it would be too dangerous and partly because he doesn't want to lose time in 
court when he needs to be in the groves working. Even if one particular group 
of men were caught red-handed, Holtz figures, they would never be held behind 
bars because of the crowded jails and, besides, the avocado ringleaders would 
simply hire other people to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
Sighs Holtz, "I pick my trees in the day; they pick them at night. It's like a 
cat-and-mouse game because they know I won't stay out there all day and all 
night, so they'll wait until I go inside for the night." 
</P>
<P>
There was a time, Holtz said, when he would go back into the groves and hide, 
hoping to deter thieves who were sure to arrive. But his wife became so worried 
for his safety -- other growers have been assaulted by thieves they confronted 
-- that Holtz hired the security guards instead. 
</P>
<P>
"Chain-link fences won't keep them out, because they'll cut right through them. 
I've had chains and locks to my gate cut by bolt cutters," Holtz said. "Some of 
the guards are Marines who tell me it's too bad I can't use some of the 
security devices they've seen at Camp Pendleton because they would work for me. 
But, of course, I don't have access to military security devices." 
</P>
<P>
Even all the security in the world might not deter thefts, Holtz said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen trucks inside of groves with the gates locked behind them, which 
tells me they already had a key to the gate and let themselves in. They could 
be men who work for the irrigators who have keys to the property, or people who 
have access to the grove managers' keys to the property." 
</P>
<P>
Some grove owners -- especially those who don't live on the property and who 
own the grove simply as an investment or revenue source -- might not ever miss 
the fruit and know they've been hit because they don't personally monitor their 
trees, industry officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The Avocado Commission had a pre-existing, annual $283,000 anti-theft campaign 
statewide, including programs to investigate wholesale and retail markets for 
evidence of stolen fruit, and a $50,000 reward fund for persons who report 
thefts to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
But, on March 15, the commission voted to authorize another $460,000 statewide 
-- including the nearly $200,000 in San Diego County -- for the hiring of law 
enforcement officers to specifically deal with avocado thievery. 
</P>
<P>
Myron Klippert, a San Diego County sheriff's commander, said officials were at 
first ignorant about how serious avocado thievery was, since much of it had 
gone unreported to authorities -- perhaps because, by then, the damage already 
had been done and growers felt there was no point. 
</P>
<P>
Klippert says he has now learned how serious the problem is and is sympathetic 
to the growers, with whom he is negotiating a contract tailored to attack the 
avocado problem. 
</P>
<P>
"These thieves are getting pretty good at what they're doing," he said. "They 
won't even pick the fruit at the edge of a grove. They'll go into the interior 
and strip the trees absolutely clean. 
</P>
<P>
"Some show up with 40-foot trailers in the middle of the night. Other guys will 
go to a street corner where migrant workers are standing around, give them 
burlap bags and tell them, "I'll meet you at 2 and pay you $30 each if those 
bags are full of avocados." 
</P>
<P>
The migrant workers may believe they're being hired by the grove owner or 
manager and have no sense that they're participating in a crime, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, avocados are simply taken from large wooden bins already filled with 
picked fruit that are placed in groves or near the road, ready to be picked up 
by the packing house the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
The larger packing houses say they don't believe stolen fruit moves through 
their doors. Some packing houses are cooperatives, owned by the growers 
themselves, and accept only that fruit that is known to come from one of the 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Other packing houses say they don't pay cash for fruit -- in itself a deterrent 
to thieves, who want to unload their hauls, get the cash and run. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the people we deal with, we've known for years," said Tim Hanify, 
director of field operations for Eco Farms, a regional packing house in 
Temecula. "If we get someone we don't know, we'll find out from him where his 
grove is, how many trees he has and his mailing address. And we won't send him 
a check for a month, which will give us time to check him out and make sure he 
is who he says he is. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the general feeling in the industry that the stolen fruit is ending up 
with the smaller, cash buyers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Growers like Holtz say they hope the avocado cops will help their plight. "But 
sting operations won't necessarily help us," he said. "From the growers' point 
of view, we have to catch these guys in our fields, and that won't be easy."

2 IMMIGRANTS FACE TRIAL IN FRIEND'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seeking a better life, three men fled Guatemala and illegally migrated to Simi 
Valley, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
In a house on Sitka Avenue they met a fellow emigre who rented them a place to 
sleep in a one-story house with about 17 other Guatemalans. 
</P>
<P>
There she put them to work recycling tires. 
</P>
<P>
And there on July 19, after a night of boozing and brawling, Ventura County 
prosecutors say, one of them died at the hands of the other two. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Garnica-Vargas and Julio Arriaza, both 27, go on trial at 10 a.m. Monday 
in Ventura County Superior Court. Each faces a charge of murder in the stabbing 
death of Ezequiel Paz Romero, 37, during a fight. Garnica-Vargas is also 
charged with possessing a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Arriaza's attorney said his client had no part in Romero's death. "The D.A.'s 
alleging that Arriaza handed the knife to Garnica-Vargas," said defense lawyer 
Willard P. Wiksell. "Our version is that Garnica-Vargas saw the knife hidden 
and picked it up." 
</P>
<P>
The lower-middle-class neighborhood around the house is quiet, safe and 
populated largely by Latino immigrants, Wiksell said. 
</P>
<P>
Arriaza had lived there for about two years, having escaped the squalor of his 
home in Guatemala, a home that the lawyer said is an adobe hut with a mud 
floor. "If you had a chicken to eat, you wouldn't get another chicken for at 
least a couple of weeks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Romero and Garnica-Vargas moved in later. They and other Guatemalans shared 
space that a woman named Octavila Pineda rented to them in the stucco house. 
</P>
<P>
The three rode around Ventura County in a beat-up van, scavenging old tires 
from gas stations, dumps and roadsides. 
</P>
<P>
Pineda had bought a machine to cut grooves in bald tires, and she put the men 
to work at that job in the garage, said Deputy Public Defender Richard Holly, 
who is representing Garnica-Vargas. 
</P>
<P>
"They would scratch a deeper tread" in the discards, he said. "They'd dip it in 
a paint type of a substance to make it all shiny and new. And then they'd sell 
them for $7.50 apiece. . . . Hopefully, they wouldn't scratch it so deep that 
you'd see the wire." 
</P>
<P>
They didn't earn much money at it, and money lay behind Romero's death, said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald C. Glynn. 
</P>
<P>
On July 19 at about 11 p.m., Garnica-Vargas and Romero began squabbling about 
their earnings, Glynn said. 
</P>
<P>
Wiksell said Romero was a bully who had a reputation for violence and often 
bragged about the guns that he owned and the people that he'd killed. 
</P>
<P>
Romero, who stood 5-foot-10 and weighed 200 pounds, began trading blows with 
Garnica-Vargas, who at 5-foot-5 weighs 135 pounds, Wiksell said. 
</P>
<P>
The fight wasn't the first they'd had. When it started, Pineda's daughter hid 
the steak knives, Wiksell said. 
</P>
<P>
Romero and Garnica-Vargas tumbled outside and were "rolling around in the 
street, kicking and punching each other and scratching and biting" in front of 
about 15 other people, Wiksell said. 
</P>
<P>
Arriaza pulled the men apart, and Romero walked away to wash his scrapes and 
bruises with a garden hose, Glynn said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Glynn said, Garnica-Vargas stabbed Romero to death. 
</P>
<P>
The defense lawyer said it wasn't a premeditated killing. The prosecutor said 
there is evidence that Arriaza handed the knife to Garnica-Vargas and said, "Go 
kill him now." 
</P>
<P>
Glynn said, "It's not entirely clear" where the knife came from, but 
Garnica-Vargas "delivers one underhand blow to his stomach, and that's it." 
</P>
<P>
Romero bled to death from a lanced abdominal artery. Arriaza and Garnica-Vargas 
were arrested later that night. They are being held on $1-million bail each.

NEW ROAD NEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In rebuttal to the Feb. 18 commentary by Gary D. Suttle ("A Nowhere Road for 
$40 Million Plus"), I have lived in the Grantville area since 1967 and traffic 
through our community gets worse every day. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Gorge Road from East County to Mission Valley is a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic is usually very heavy Monday through Saturday. Main streets of 
Grantville and Allied Gardens like Zion Avenue, Waring Road and Twain Avenue 
are heavily traveled. For me to enter Twain from a side street during the work 
week from 6:30 a.m. to 8 a.m. is impossible. I must find an opening and streak 
out on Twain heading west to Mission Gorge Road. 
</P>
<P>
After I reach Twain and Mission Gorge Road, I must go through three signals to 
reach Interstate 8. The traffic is so heavy in the morning it takes 15 minutes 
to reach the freeway just from Twain -- and that's when there's no accident or 
construction, otherwise you can triple the time. 
</P>
<P>
I know for a fact that people from East County use our side streets of Allied 
Gardens and Grantville to run parallel with the freeway. They make better time. 
</P>
<P>
Opening the Jackson Drive extension would relieve traffic congestion in all 
what we call District 7. People who need to get to north city could take 
Jackson, relieving traffic from Mission Gorge Road and I-8. People in East 
County and Del Cerro/Navajo could take Jackson to get to the freeway at 
California 52. We voted for the funds to build Jackson Drive -- the voters 
expect it to be built. 
</P>
<P>
We have a traffic problem and we need roads like Jackson Drive. It will improve 
many people's quality of life throughout San Diego by helping reduce traffic on 
I-8 and our residential streets.

MONEY FOR SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yes, I care about the deplorable dropout rate in our San Diego high schools 
("Where Is the Public Outcry for Black Students," March 11). The dropout rate 
is a disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
It could be improved, certainly, with sufficient funding for smaller classes 
and for more counselors. But we have both a president and a governor who talk 
about education but do not give it any priority when it comes to funding. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush came to California recently, but he did not promise more federal 
funding for schools. Instead, he dedicated a prison and spent the balance of 
his time raising money for Republican political candidates. Nor did he talk 
about the inner cities and the lack of decent housing for low-income families, 
a lack which contributes to the failures in our schools. 
</P>
<P>
A few days after he left, another nuclear weapons test took place in Nevada, a 
wasteful display of power in this period of thawing of superpower animosity. 
Nuclear weapons tests cost approximately $60 million a throw. Why not use this 
kind of money for education and housing? 
</P>
<P>
I'm still looking for the "kinder, gentler" America that George Bush promised 
us.

INGLEWOOD ADDS 4TH PARAMEDIC UNIT TO REDUCE RESPONSE TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Inglewood has deployed a fourth paramedic unit to reduce the time it takes 
ambulances to reach seriously injured victims and compensate for the 90 minutes 
that rescue teams sometimes spend on the road to and from distant trauma 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood Fire Chief Robert Hartzog said the fourth paramedic unit was added 
because the response times for some patients had reached seven minutes from an 
optimum of four minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Seven minutes is not at all acceptable for a serious injury," Hartzog said. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood's rescue units, like others across the county, have become 
increasingly strained as the number of trauma centers have declined and there 
are fewer options available for treating the seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was made worse for Inglewood because of a directive last month from 
the county Department of Health Services. It restricts access to trauma centers 
to only those municipalities within the centers' so-called "catchment areas," 
county-drawn boundaries that define service areas for each hospital. 
</P>
<P>
For Inglewood, the county directive means no more access to UCLA Medical Center 
in Westwood; leaving unrestricted access only to the trauma center at Martin 
Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center in Willowbrook. 
</P>
<P>
At times when the Willowbrook facility temporarily closes to trauma cases, 
Inglewood paramedics may go to Harbor UCLA Medical Center near Torrance or, if 
that closes, the next nearest trauma center. 
</P>
<P>
Even when paramedics do reach the trauma center at Martin Luther King, it is 
often inundated with other trauma cases just before it is forced to temporarily 
close, said Tom Crawford, an Inglewood paramedic. That forces them to stay with 
the patient even longer. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes we have a gunshot victim in the hallway and there are two gunshots 
on the table and no more room," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If a first aid call comes in when all units are in use, which happens 
occasionally, Inglewood deploys a fire truck and uses private ambulance 
services if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a countywide problem," Hartzog said. "The county has to take steps to 
resolve it. We need a massive amount of funding to get trauma centers back on 
their feet." 
</P>
<P>
The new unit in Inglewood, which started working last Monday, responded to 35 
calls in its first week and helped to relieve the 12 to 15 calls a day that the 
city's other paramedic units receive, Hartzog said. 
</P>
<P>
The two-person crew based at Fire Station No. 2 in north Inglewood will handle 
calls on the San Diego (405) Freeway, which has been more difficult for units 
in other parts of the city to reach because its ramps were rerouted for Century 
Freeway construction. 
</P>
<P>
The new unit will operate until June with personnel formerly assigned to 
firefighting duties and a 10-year-old ambulance that had been in storage. The 
city expects to extend the program, city and fire officials said. It will cost 
an additional $200,000 in salary annually and $70,000 for a new rescue 
ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
The county trauma network was established in December, 1983, to treat the 
critically injured who probably would die without immediate care. Hospitals in 
the network have surgeons and anesthesiologists standing by to operate on 
victims of car accidents or violent attacks who have life-threatening head, 
abdominal or chest injuries. 
</P>
<P>
At its height, the network had 22 trauma centers in operation. Today there are 
three public trauma units and 10 private ones, some of those wavering towards 
closure. Those that have left say it is too costly to have their centers 
staffed and to treat trauma patients who frequently cannot afford to pay their 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
County health officials have tried various ways to keep the remaining private 
hospitals in the trauma network. 
</P>
<P>
"The boundaries were relaxed when the number of trauma hospitals began to 
decline," said Virginia Price-Hastings, the county's chief of paramedic and 
trauma programs. "Enforcing them again has helped to relieve pressure on the 
smaller private hospitals, preventing them from leaving the system, too."

SAN PEDRO GETS PROMISE BUT NO ACTION ON BID FOR BED TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAY EVANS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Pedro Peninsula Chamber of Commerce officials, along with their friends in 
the hotel business, were girded for battle last month, set to make an unusual 
pitch to get back a share of hotel bed taxes collected by the city of Los 
Angeles in the seaside community. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, drafted by the chamber and supported by City Councilwoman Joan 
Milke Flores, would send 9% of hotel transient occupancy taxes back to San 
Pedro, for use by the chamber in advertising the community as a tourist 
destination. But after lining up troops to argue for the long-shot plan at a 
Feb. 14 meeting of the Community and Economic Development Committee, the bed 
tax proposal was inadvertently omitted from the agenda, said chamber and 
council representatives. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, they haven't rescheduled it. We knew this was going to be a hot 
potato, but we thought we would at least get a hearing on it," Leron Gubler, 
executive director of the chamber, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Robert Farrell, who chairs the Community and Economic 
Development Committee, said last week that he prefers to hold a committee 
meeting in San Pedro to discuss the proposal, along with other Harbor area 
economic issues, with residents. 
</P>
<P>
"This idea is worthy for us to discuss. I intend to set the hearing for some 
time in mid-April. There is nothing intrinsic in the issue causing the delay. . 
. , " Farrell said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles annually collects about $70 million through a 12% hotel transient 
occupancy tax -- the bed tax. Almost 60% of that money is used to improve 
public safety, public works and recreation citywide. No money is earmarked for 
local entities. 
</P>
<P>
About $6 million is given to the Greater Los Angeles Visitors and Convention 
Bureau, which spends it to promote tourism. However, the bureau does not divide 
up taxes to highlight specific areas, such as San Pedro, and uses the money 
instead to showcase the entire city. 
</P>
<P>
Chamber officials say San Pedro, which dangles like a pendulum 23 miles from 
downtown Los Angeles, gets short shrift when it comes to promotion. 
</P>
<P>
"We get very little spinoff from the visitors's bureau, which is centered 
downtown," Gubler said. "How are we going to create an identity for ourselves 
when we are merely a footnote in a publication about all of Southern 
California? It seems logical that people directly affected are best able to 
promote the area." 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, chamber officials say, $386,000 was collected by the city in hotel bed 
taxes in San Pedro. But with new hotels opening soon, chamber officials 
anticipate San Pedro could contribute nearly $1 million in bed taxes to city 
coffers. What the chamber wants is to spend 9% of that just promoting the San 
Pedro area. 
</P>
<P>
Some city officials criticize the plan, fearing it could open a Pandora's box 
if other Los Angeles communities seek a greater share of locally collected 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
In a memo sent to Farrell before the scheduled February hearing of the bed tax 
proposal, City Administrative Officer Keith Comrie wrote: "We cannot support 
diverting a portion of any tax . . . to the communities which generate the 
revenue." 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro was annexed by Los Angeles in 1909 to give the city control over the 
lucrative Port of Los Angeles. But in recent years, shipbuilding and canning, 
once the mainstays of the port community, have had drastic declines. San Pedro 
has turned to tourism to keep dollars flowing into the area. 
</P>
<P>
Within the next year, San Pedro expects to open three new hotels, increasing by 
150% the number of available rooms in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"Our major priority last year was to get tourist facilities and hotels. We have 
achieved that, but now we have to fill those rooms," Gubler said. 
</P>
<P>
If the unusual plan is approved, San Pedro hotel officials say the chamber's 
Tourism Council would use the money -- potentially $90,000 a year -- in a 
number of ways. 
</P>
<P>
"We could produce a directory with advertising, have a video made about 
attractions in San Pedro, attend trade shows. . . . Right now, travelers 
staying in the area before embarking on cruises stay at the airport," said Jane 
Walton, director of sales and marketing for the Sheraton San Pedro hotel, which 
is to open in May. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro tourism promoters have always said that the area is ideally located 
for visitors to Los Angeles: far enough from crowded, smoggy downtown, but 
still close to such attractions as Disneyland and Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone concedes it is an uphill political fight to get the money, 
particularly with other areas of Los Angeles watching the San Pedro campaign in 
hopes of imitating it if it is successful. 
</P>
<P>
Flores, who is backing the plan, said: "I'm not so sure it is a bad idea to 
help the community in trying to do some self-promotion."

Ken Crowe, Hawthorne Principal 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Crowe, 37, became principal of Hawthorne High School in February, 1988. He 
was the school's assistant principal from 1985 to 1988 and served as assistant 
principal at Lynwood High School from 1983 to 1985. His resignation, announced 
on March 1, was cited by students as one of the reasons they staged 
demonstrations at Leuzinger and Hawthorne high schools beginning on March 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you think has caused the racial tension and student unrest in the 
district? 
</P>
<P>
A: There's a perception by certain (minority students and parents) in the 
community and the school that they have no voice, that their grievances will 
not be adjudicated with any type of sensitivity. The students by and large feel 
that I have been mistreated. Students of all ethnic groups report to me that 
teachers have used their classrooms not to deal with the curriculum, but to 
deal with their own opinions and perceptions of the election and what the board 
should now do to simplify their lives as teachers. There's never any talk about 
what is best for children. I have not heard that in any discussion. 
</P>
<P>
When I was appointed principal 2 1/2 years ago, the board was majority white, 
and they wanted to be advocates for children and they had confidence that I 
would take care of their children. I have worked in this school system 3 1/2 
years prior to being appointed principal and many of the teachers, who are 
critics of mine now, were my most ardent supporters. They lobbied in behalf of 
me to become principal. 
</P>
<P>
There's a terrible mismatch in this school between the type of students who 
attend here and the type of teachers who must teach them, ethnically and in 
terms of cultural sensitivity. . . . You have a certain core of leadership 
teachers who came through teacher preparation courses in the '50s and '60s and 
who are simply not prepared, through no fault of their own, to deal with the 
urban child and all the myriad of problems that are associated with educating 
that child. That does not mean the teachers are not well-intentioned. It's just 
in this environment these students need more. 
</P>
<P>
One of my most difficult decisions was during my first semester. There were 34 
teachers who were teaching in areas in which they didn't have credentials. . . 
. One of my reforms was to put these teachers back into the area where they had 
credentials and that was mandated by a law, Senate Bill 435 as of Jan. 1, 1988. 
It said all teachers had to be teaching in an area where they had credential 
authorization. That was very difficult. There were nine teachers in mathematics 
who had no credentials in mathematics, just to give you an example of what the 
problem was. What that did in this small district was to create a situation 
where I was the bad guy with my instructional staff for doing right off the bat 
what was right for children. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Another thing that created heartburn was that I asked teachers to submit to me 
and sent to all the parents at the beginning of each semester their classroom 
rules and grading policy. I felt it would increase the level of professionalism 
and that it would better inform parents and students of the expectation the 
teacher has of them to be successful. That was not greeted with a great deal of 
enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
These were small but very significant reforms in the short time I had been 
principal to upgrade the professionalism in the school and try to raise the 
level of achievement. There was some resistance because I am a young black man 
with ideas of excellence for young children, and because those ideas meant I 
may ask staff and individuals to work harder. Then we had the racial cartoons 
and the incidents. 
</P>
<P>
In the fall of '88, in a casual conversation with . . . Lauren Sanders 
(executive director of South Bay United Teachers), he made the observation that 
some of the teachers have problems with the fact that I was black and the 
superintendent is black. That would be tantamount to me saying I have problems 
with Dan Quayle and George Bush because they are white. 
</P>
<P>
Q: To what extent are the white teachers racist? 
</P>
<P>
A: I'm not saying that all the teachers here are racist. But the ones that are 
not, first of all they need to censure their leader (Nancy Nuesseler) who 
speaks for them. Otherwise, it leads one to believe that this (Nuesseler's 
remark) was OK (with them). Al Campanis is no longer the spokesperson for the 
Dodgers, and he served with distinction for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How effectively has the school board responded to the situation? 
</P>
<P>
A: What they should have . . . done was to come in and been in support 
initially of the administration, to take a wait-and-see attitude. You can't 
come in, hold five meetings and then reassign a popular principal. I don't 
believe this whole situation would have occurred if they hadn't reassigned me. 
They have not met with me. 
</P>
<P>
One of the board members has said the district should go in a new direction, 
but it has never been articulated what the new direction is. . . . But if they 
come in and say we want a new direction, and they start picking off minority 
individuals with whom students can identify, then there is a perception on the 
students's part and others as well that there may be some underlying racist 
motives behind the actions. 
</P>
<P>
Q: And the administration? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think the administration has done well. We've kept the level of violence 
down in the schools. The schools' instruction program is on target. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Critics say the administration did not try to forestall the recent protests 
when it was clear that the tension between administrators and teachers might 
provoke students. 
</P>
<P>
A: After the election, (white) teachers were telling students that the black 
administrators would be removed. Then, when I was reassigned, it became 
apparent that these were no longer rumors. I think the board should have dealt 
with those early on by making clear what their intentions were. If there are 
rumors that a board elected (with the help of) the teachers is going to get rid 
of the black administration, then it is not up to the administration to get rid 
of those rumors. I think it is the board's responsibility to exercise 
leadership in that area, because they are the only group that can do hiring and 
firing, not the administrators. . . . 
</P>
<P>
How could we predict (the protests)? We come to work one day and there are 
flyers saying this or that. . . . When it was about to occur, we knew about it 
at that time, and we did all we could to prevent it. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Some charge that you and Nash incited students to protest. 
</P>
<P>
A: I'm not going to respond to that. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Some charge that your resignation announcement was handled in a way that 
encouraged students to stage their walkout. 
</P>
<P>
A: I don't agree with that. I was caught totally off-guard by the board 
decision to reassign me. I felt all along I wasn't supported by the board and, 
basically, my resignation said that. It is very difficult as an administrator 
working without the support of the board. I really don't think this board has 
been fair at all. The suggestion that I had some type of involvement is 
ludicrous, and I challenge anyone to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What do you think should be done to solve the district's problems? 
</P>
<P>
A: My resignation should be rescinded, obviously. The board should state the 
direction that they want the district to go. If they don't want us to implement 
the educational reforms and the accountability that goes with it, they should 
just say that. . . . (The board should) make a clear statement about the 
direction, the types of things they want to see in the district and not be 
involved in personnel, just the policy they want to see in the schools. Let the 
personnel implement the policy, but don't come in and start removing personnel 
without stating clearly your goals and objectives and where you want the 
district to go. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Has any good come from the controversy? 
</P>
<P>
A: I really think that a broader community has been able to focus in on what is 
occurring in what could be described as a small provincial school system. I 
think some of the problems that are occurring in this school district, the 
variables are known now, certainly up and down the state. And many people 
throughout the state are waiting to see if this board will act with a sense of 
fair play and a high degree of ethics.

</P>
<P>
Police said that the men exchanged words with the passengers of a passing 
compact car in the 1000 block of 43rd Street about 2 a.m. Then, according to a 
witness, the driver of the car made a U-turn and shots rang out as it passed 
the group on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
One of the men was hit in the groin, another in the arm and the third in the 
leg. None of the wounds was life-threatening, police said.

BABY IS OBJECT OF ADOPTION TUG OF WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Until recently, Andy's life had been simple. 
</P>
<P>
The chubby 11-month-old loves to play with his cat, splash in his tub and sit 
on his mom's lap for his nightly bedtime story. When he awakes from his naps, 
he gazes at an old pepper tree just outside his window that makes his room seem 
like it's nestled in branches. 
</P>
<P>
But Andy has another identity and another mother who loves him and wants him 
back. A battery of judges, lawyers and Los Angeles County social workers have 
all played a part in sorting out who will be able to call the boy their son. 
</P>
<P>
Andy is the object of a bitter adoption fight that has pitted a San Fernando 
Valley couple, who have raised him since birth, against his 16-year-old 
biological mother, who lives in a group home in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The couple -- Craig is a teacher and Martha a speech therapist -- say they 
cannot imagine life without Andy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's absolutely maddening . . . ," said Martha, who asked that her family's 
last name not be used. "We are the parents of the child. Any rational mind can 
see that." 
</P>
<P>
But the teen-ager, through her attorney, contends that she changed her mind 
about relinquishing her son just a few days after his birth. Her lawyer, 
Theodore S. Goodwin, accuses the couple's original attorney of "fraud, coercion 
and unethical conduct" in ignoring his client's wish to cancel the proposed 
adoption. 
</P>
<P>
The emotional dispute is an example of an independent adoption gone awry -- 
something that rarely happens in California, where 2,800 independent adoptions 
are expected to be completed this year. 
</P>
<P>
In an independent adoption, a couple does not find a child through an agency or 
the county's Department of Children's Services, but instead passes the word 
through an informal network of friends, relatives, obstetricians and even 
hairdressers who might know of the rare pregnant woman who doesn't want to keep 
her baby. 
</P>
<P>
The battle for Andy has generated six legal cases and has prompted opposing 
attorneys to accuse each other of gross conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's attorney, Christian R. Van Deusen, who handles contested adoption 
cases across the country, was so incensed by the way the case has been handled, 
he complained about it at a public hearing conducted recently on the county's 
beleaguered foster care system. 
</P>
<P>
If the unwed teen-ager succeeds in regaining her son, Andy will be placed in a 
foster home until she is able to care for him, court records indicate. The 
mother is a ward of Juvenile Court, records show, and she lives in a 
residential rehabilitation facility for troubled youths. The reason she is in 
the Juvenile Court system remains confidential. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager, who declined through her attorney to be interviewed, hopes to 
raise the boy herself after he's been in the foster care system for 1 to 1 1/2 
years, court records indicate. 
</P>
<P>
But taking the baby out of the only home he knows would be a travesty, said Van 
Deusen, who contended in a court brief that a child "cannot suddenly be 
transplanted like a dogwood tree." Further, he said, the boy could be 
endangered in the county's foster care network, which recently was criticized 
by the state for being incapable of protecting children from substandard 
conditions and sexual and verbal abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"You read about 10 children sleeping on a garage floor and infants doubled up 
in bassinets because the system doesn't have enough money, and now they use the 
system to do an end run on a child that is absolutely safe and secure," Van 
Deusen said. 
</P>
<P>
But Goodwin, who declined to be interviewed at length, said the baby belongs to 
his client because she changed her mind about the adoption immediately. Her 
wishes, however, were never honored, he said, and "it got entirely out of 
hand." 
</P>
<P>
Nobody was contemplating a legal donnybrook a year ago when Martha and Craig 
met the expectant mother at a restaurant. The pretty, blond-haired teen-ager 
had learned of the couple through her obstetrician, who is a family friend of 
the couple. She selected them after reading their resume -- they had circulated 
hundreds of them throughout Los Angeles. Their hobbies -- camping, skiing, 
bicycling, horseback riding and hiking -- were what caught her eye, she told 
them. 
</P>
<P>
They learned about her too. She liked sewing, shopping and roller-skating. She 
had been a junior lifeguard and a track team member, court records indicate. 
The teen-ager was a B student whose favorite subjects were art and history. She 
hadn't decided whether she would go on to college. 
</P>
<P>
In a questionnaire she filled out before the birth -- now part of the court 
records -- she explained why she had decided to give up her child. "We love 
each other," she wrote of her relationship with her boyfriend, "but we are too 
immature and young to raise a child. We are unprepared." 
</P>
<P>
"I want my baby to have a happy family to ensure his/her own happiness 
forever," she wrote. "I cannot raise my baby by myself. He/she needs a complete 
family and stable parents." 
</P>
<P>
At the delivery on April 21, Martha held the teen-ager's hand through the pain 
of childbirth and was handed the tiny wrinkled baby when the delivery was over. 
</P>
<P>
"I was breathless, speechless," Martha said. "It was one of the most wonderful 
things in my life." 
</P>
<P>
The next day, the couple arrived with the baby at their pink two-story 
Victorian house with wrap-around front porches and a spectacular view of the 
Santa Monica Mountains. Their four-year attempt to become parents seemed over, 
but records show that the biological mother was agonizing over her decision. 
</P>
<P>
On April 24, the distraught mother called Lindsay Kohut Slatter, the attorney 
who handled the placement for the couple, and said she wanted the baby back. In 
a sworn declaration, Slatter said she never told the teen-ager she could not 
retrieve the baby. 
</P>
<P>
For the next three days, according to the attorney's statement, the teen-ager 
talked to her mother, her juvenile case worker, her therapist and Slatter many 
times and decided she wanted to move into a foster home with the baby. 
</P>
<P>
But then the teen-ager suddenly changed her mind, Slatter said. On April 27, 
the attorney said, the teen-ager "was apologetic, sweet and sounded relieved of 
an emotional burden." Reiterating her desire to receive photos of the baby 
occasionally, the teen-ager said the infant could remain with the couple. 
</P>
<P>
In November, a hysterical woman, who Slatter said she believed was the 
biological mother, called Slatter's office screaming and cursing. 
</P>
<P>
Goodwin, a private attorney who was retained by the county to represent the 
birth mother in her juvenile delinquency matter, is also helping the teen-ager 
fight for custody of the baby. 
</P>
<P>
Van Deusen said that the biological mother's chances of regaining her child 
seem better because she got in trouble with the law, thereby making an 
attorney's services available to her. 
</P>
<P>
Goodwin has so far managed to thwart the couple's attempt to complete the 
adoption process in Superior Court and instead has kept the matter in Juvenile 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
Until this month, the couple had been excluded from participating in the 
Juvenile Court proceedings because the court did not recognize their standing, 
Van Deusen said. The couple could not legally intervene in the confidential 
juvenile proceedings because technically they were not related to Andy. In 
fact, a bailiff once escorted the couple out of the courtroom during a hearing 
about Andy's fate, Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
Goodwin maintains that Juvenile Court is the proper place to resolve the case. 
</P>
<P>
"The Juvenile Court came in because the Juvenile Court saw the mother was being 
taken advantage of," Goodwin said. 
</P>
<P>
The child's destiny might become clearer on April 9, when the Juvenile Court 
judge is expected to hear the recommendations of the Children's Services 
Department. In a report filed with the court, a county adoption worker said the 
baby is "an adorable, responsive youngster," who is "well-loved and nurtured." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, under court order, Andy has been visiting with his biological mother 
once a week since February. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unbelievably stressful," Craig said of the wait. "On top of that, there 
is a need to maintain an equilibrium about the birth mother. It's important to 
maintain positive thoughts about the birth mother. . . . She's as much a victim 
and pawn of this as we are."

Jacqueline Carrera, School Board Member 
</P>
<P>
 Jacqueline Carrera, 25, was elected to the school board on Nov. 7. An 
accountant from Lennox, Carrera was one of two challengers in last year's 
school board campaign who received the strong support of the district's 
200-member teacher's union, which has been sharply critical of district Supt. 
McKinley Nash. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you think has caused the racial tension and student unrest in the 
district? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think it was somewhat related to our election. The fact that certain 
individuals supported the incumbents and certain individuals supported the new 
board members, that issue right there created some problems. The fact that it 
came to this was all tied into the election. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not saying there is no racial problem, because overall in the U.S. there's 
some degree of racial problems. But as to why there's this particular problem 
in our district, I feel that it's tied to the elections. Obviously, there 
appears to be some type of tension between the administrators and the staff. 
You're asking me questions I'd love to (answer in) detail but can't. 
</P>
<P>
I wasn't on the board when these incidents supposedly began. From the point 
that I have been on the board, from Nov. 28, everything I see is very much tied 
to the election. Most of the accusations have been very political. It's rumors 
and allegations. How can you stop rumors? 
</P>
<P>
Q: To what extent is there racism among white teachers? 
</P>
<P>
A: Most of the teachers we have in this district have been here many, many 
years. I was taught by many of these teachers. I'm a graduate of Lennox High. 
They have seen the transition within our community toward more minorities. I 
believe they handled it and have done a good job. I myself was taught by a 
mostly white teaching staff and never felt discrimination because I was Latina. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
There's a little bit of racism in everyone. To say a person has never had a 
racist thought in their life would be a lie. At some point someone may make a 
statement that may be racist or sound racist, but that doesn't mean that the 
person is racist. I'm not saying we don't have some problems. But I think it's 
greatly enlarged by miscommunication and rumors. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What about the racially offensive notes and cartoons sent to minority 
administrators? 
</P>
<P>
A: If we knew a name, believe me I am sure this board would take action. How 
can we take action against someone when we don't know who they are? It's hard 
to say it's the teachers. These notes were unsigned. I walk into my office 
every day, and I assume mail on my desk is from the mailman, but anyone could 
have put it there. What can we be expected to do when we don't know who they 
are? 
</P>
<P>
Q: How effectively have the school board, the administration and the teachers 
responded to the situation? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think we've done a good job. I'll tell you why. This tension has been 
there for a couple of years. We've been in office three months. One, we had to 
be informed. That took a month and a half. We requested an investigation by SDE 
(the state Department of Education). They've come down, and they've started 
their investigation. And it was not just because of the walkouts. We had 
requested SDE to do the investigation in January or February. We voted on it in 
public. We instructed the superintendent to write them. He did, and they were 
here last week. The superintendent gave the state a list of the problems. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think this board was even given a chance. In our first meeting we were 
more or less accused of everything in the book. We didn't even have time to sit 
down with attorneys and see what we were accused of. I welcome parents to come 
speak (at board meetings). But whether every parent who comes up listens to us 
when we say, one, we are not racist, two, we are concerned, and three, we are 
not trying to get rid of programs is another question. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, I think the administration is trying to do their best, just like we 
are. But we are having problems in communications (with the administration). It 
makes it difficult for us to get certain information. But overall, they're 
doing all they can. Everyone in the district is doing all they can to make sure 
that education continues. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Some charge that the recent student unrest resulted in part from the new 
board's failure to respond decisively to signs of racial tension in the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
A: If they're going to try to blame the walkout on this board, then I would 
take offense. These racial incidents started in 1987-88. After three months in 
office, we have to take the entire responsibility? Maybe we have to, but I 
don't think it's fair. . . . 
</P>
<P>
We're trying to open communication with everyone. We've sat down with the kids, 
and we're planning to set up meetings with more students, with parents and 
members of the community. It's just going to be a step-by-step process. We 
can't have 15,000 things happening at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
The thing that's hurt this board the most is misinformation, all the untrue 
things that have been said about us personally. There are so many rumors, it's 
incredible. Obviously someone is providing a lot of wrong information. I have 
never said I wanted to get rid of minority administrators. First of all, I'm a 
minority. And I judge people for what they are, not the color of their skin. 
I'm very frustrated. If I say the sun is red, someone will say, 'She said the 
sun is burgundy.' 
</P>
<P>
Everything we say gets twisted. It's very hard to try to talk to people and say 
what you see in the media is not who we are. If they would take the opportunity 
to stop yelling at us, they might find a totally different person than they 
expected. People say we hid (personnel issues, such as those involving Crowe) 
from them. It's not that we are hiding. It's that what we are asked we are not 
always permitted to discuss. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What do you think should be done to address the problems in the district? 
</P>
<P>
A: We've taken the first step, calling in the SDE. We also have the 10-point 
plan, and we have asked the superintendent to provide us with a program to 
implement the 10-point plan. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Has any good come from the controversy? 
</P>
<P>
A: Some good has come out of it. One thing is that students now know they can 
come to the board and express their opinions. I believe they walked out because 
they thought that was the only way they could get our attention. And there's 
the fact that we were able to explain to them something about the process under 
which the board functions, such as why we have to say "no comment" when we're 
discussing a personnel matter or an expulsion hearing. Once we told them, they 
realized that they as individuals would have the same rights (to confidential 
hearings) that we're giving Crowe. 
</P>
<P>
Other than those two things, everything else I think was negative for the 
district. One teacher told me, "I was always proud to belong to Hawthorne High, 
but now people say, 'Oh, you belong to that school.' "

CENTINELA VALLEY PROTEST: A SEARCH FOR COMMON GROUND; 
</P>
<P>
HEATED DEBATE CONTINUES IN WAKE OF STUDENT WALKOUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In the wake of this month's student protests in the Centinela Valley Union High 
School District, there has been heated debate about the racial tensions 
underlying the unrest and how to ease them. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Los Angeles Times conducted a series of interviews in an attempt 
to explore this debate, talking with teachers, district officials, parents and 
a student leader. Their comments begin below and continue on B8. 
</P>
<P>
As the interviews illustrate, there is still sharp disagreement on the problems 
facing the district but a common concern about their impact on teachers and 
students. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly two years, the district has been plagued by race-related incidents, 
ranging from anonymous notes and offensive cartoons targeting black 
administrators to the confiscation in October at Hawthorne High School of a 
mannequin designed to look like a dead black man. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Gold, the English teacher who used the one-time movie prop in the 
school's "Film as Literature" class to illustrate the power of special effects, 
has insisted that the mannequin was not intended to be racist. 
</P>
<P>
One of the incidents that has been repeatedly cited involved Nancy Nuesseler, 
president of the Centinela Valley Secondary Teachers Assn. Last September, 
Nuesseler, who is white, referred to Supt. McKinley Nash, who is black, as a 
"Stepin Fetchit" for state Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig. She has 
since publicly apologized for the remark. 
</P>
<P>
The incidents have taken place against a backdrop of dramatic racial change in 
the district. In 1980, 45.6% of the student body was white, 33.7% Latino and 
12.1% black. By 1988, Latinos accounted for 52.4% of students, 18.7% were white 
and 17.2% black. The district's faculty is overwhelmingly white, and about 31% 
of the district's administrators, including Nash and two principals, are black. 
</P>
<P>
Tensions in the 6,000-student district came to a head on March 5, a Monday, 
when students from Leuzinger High School marched across town to Hawthorne High 
to protest alleged racism and the resignation March 1 of that school's black 
principal, Ken Crowe. At one point, about 2,000 students marched through the 
Hawthorne campus. 
</P>
<P>
Many students said they had heard rumors that the school board members -- four 
Latinos and an Anglo -- wanted to fire all black teachers and administrators. 
Demonstrations were smaller on the following day and ended after a brief sit-in 
at Leuzinger on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
When Crowe announced that he was resigning, effective at the end of the school 
year, he said the school board had not supported his efforts to resolve racial 
tensions. He later said he resigned after the board had told him that he would 
be reassigned but gave him no reason for the decision. On the second day of the 
demonstrations, Crowe said he would ask the board to rescind his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday of that week, 27 community leaders, including law-enforcement 
officials and educators, gathered at a hastily called meeting organized by 
state Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles). They emerged four hours later with a 
10-point plan to address the unrest, including recommendations for programs to 
improve understanding among various ethnic groups. Those suggestions are likely 
to be discussed when the school board meets on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
On March 15, the state Department of Education's Intergroup Relations Office 
sent a team of educators and an attorney to begin assessing the district's 
racial climate. After interviewing parents, students, teachers and 
administrators, the team will draft a set of recommendations for the school 
board.

EL SEGUNDO TO SUE L.A. OVER HYPERION PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Angered by last week's release of strong fumes from Los Angeles' Hyperion 
Sewage Treatment Plant, which sent one resident to the hospital, the El Segundo 
City Council voted unanimously Friday to sue Los Angeles and demand a full 
investigation of environmental and health problems posed by Hyperion. 
</P>
<P>
The sprawling coastal plant borders El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Leland Dolley said the suit branding Hyperion a public nuisance will 
be filed in Los Angeles Superior Court within a week. He said the city will 
seek an injunction compelling Hyperion to eliminate odor and health problems at 
the earliest opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Scot Dannen moved that the suit be filed, contending the city faces 
a "stone wall" with Hyperion. Los Angeles officials have acknowledged odor 
problems at Hyperion but have said some will disappear with the plant expansion 
now under way. 
</P>
<P>
The council said in December that it would sue Los Angeles over Hyperion. It 
has collected 125 affidavits from residents about health, safety and emotional 
problems associated with the sewage treatment plant. However, in response to 
the March 19 incident at Hyperion, City Manager Ron Cano on Friday urged 
immediate action. "The time is now. We owe it to the citizens," he told the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
In that incident, Cano said, one resident near the plant was treated at Robert 
F. Kennedy Medical Center in Hawthorne after complaining of burning eyes and 
nose. Two others complained of sore throats and eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Cano said preliminary investigations by the city and the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District failed to determine what produced the fumes, 
although chlorine or ammonia was suspected at the time. Hyperion officials said 
a scrubbing device used to remove hydrogen sulfide gases had malfunctioned, but 
the source of the fumes could not be pinpointed.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: 'WE HOPE TO PROVIDE A WONDERFUL CHORAL EXPERIENCE FOR 
STUDENTS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Master Chorale Music Director John Currie -- his sleeves rolled up 
and an infectious grin on his face -- was spreading his enthusiasm about choral 
singing. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing on the planet like the sound of voices singing together," he 
told Banning High School student singers on a visit to the Wilmington campus 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
With a smattering of musical jokes as leavening, Currie coached the students on 
breathing and vocalization. 
</P>
<P>
"Sing like fish, not like frogs, drop the jaw . . . sing a big sound," he told 
the students as he worked with them to polish the music they'll perform under 
Currie's direction as part of an unusual 400-voice South Bay choral festival on 
April 3. 
</P>
<P>
Music of Vivaldi, Bruckner, Vaughan Williams and Copland will be sung at the 
Norris Theatre for the Performing Arts by students from 12 intermediate and 
high schools in the South Bay and South Los Angeles. The singers, who will 
perform with piano and trumpet accompaniment, will fill most most of the 
Rolling Hills Estates theater's 450 seats. A smattering of invited guests, 
including school music teachers, will make up a small audience. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to provide a wonderful choral experience for students," said Phyllis 
Rothrock, chairman of the the chorale's South Bay support group. She said such 
a high school music showcase under Currie's direction is "an idea whose time 
has come." 
</P>
<P>
Rothrock's group came up with the idea and got an enthusiastic response from 
Los Angeles, Torrance, Centinela Valley and Palos Verdes Peninsula school 
districts. The chorale, which performs at the the Los Angeles Music Center, 
hopes it will become an annual event. 
</P>
<P>
Currie, who visited all of the schools to rehearse singers, calls the festival 
a way for student singers to emulate the 130 professional singers in the 
chorale. Later, the youngsters will have a chance to hear the group for 
themselves because they're getting free tickets for an April concert. 
</P>
<P>
Banning music teacher Laura Young calls the festival "a once in a lifetime 
shot" for her students, adding, "Having John Currie here gives me the right to 
tell them to try harder." 
</P>
<P>
Student Susan Pickett said the opportunity to sing at the festival "is one of 
the most exciting things" that's happened to her. Gerald Faris

SMOG DETECTIVE STUDIES EFFECTS ON HUMANS;

ENVIRONMENT: RESEARCHER FROM UC IRVINE USES A BAG OF TRICKS TO TRACK HOW AIR 
POLLUTION HARMS THE LUNGS.

<P>
As Bob Phalen's minivan climbs a freeway ramp on his daily 10-mile commute to 
work, he scans the sky to the east, looking for mile-high Saddleback Mountain, 
barely visible through thick gray smog. 
</P>
<P>
"This is where I judge the air each day. It's pretty dirty today," Phalen says. 
"Dirty air depresses me, but it reminds me I have a job to do. There are 
millions of Americans breathing this stuff. They deserve to know more about its 
effects." 
</P>
<P>
Phalen, 49, a biophysicist and inhalation toxicologist, directs the Air 
Pollution Health Effects Laboratory at UC Irvine. The sprawling campus is on 
the southern edge of America's dirtiest smog zone: the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with rats, ferrets, beagles, smog-exposure chambers, treadmills, fake 
noses and pollution-breathing mannequins, Phalen's team of jeans-clad 
scientists has spent 15 years waging a war to save America's lungs. 
</P>
<P>
"Our air will be cleaner eventually as a result of what Bob Phalen and his 
colleagues have done, and the nation will benefit too," said John R. Holmes, 
research director of California's Air Resources Board. "He's a real asset as 
far as helping us understand what we need to do in the air-pollution control 
business." 
</P>
<P>
Barely an hour past breakfast, Phalen plunges his gloved hands into a plastic 
tub of saline solution and pulls out a blackened human lung. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the lung of a smoker," he says. "This particular person died of a 
heart attack. The lungs weren't suitable for transplantation. They were in bad 
shape." 
</P>
<P>
The lungs were donated for research. In Phalen's laboratory, blue silicone 
rubber was injected into one lung, filling the airways and gradually 
congealing. 
</P>
<P>
Phalen submerges the lung into a tray of lye. A few days later, the lung is 
dissolved. What remains is a lung cast: a blue rubber mold of the branching 
airways, even tiny ones. 
</P>
<P>
Phalen studies casts of human, dog and ferret lungs to learn how age and bad 
air change the passageways that carry oxygen and pollutants into the body. 
</P>
<P>
"Most environmental risks are through inhalation," he said. "Each day, you 
drink two quarts of liquid, you eat two quarts of food, but you inhale 15,000 
quarts of air." 
</P>
<P>
The air inhaled by residents of the Los Angeles Basin contains the most 
hazardous type of pollution: "secondary" pollutants created when sunlight 
triggers reactions among "primary" pollutants emitted by cars, factories and 
power plants. 
</P>
<P>
"Secondary pollutants include (colorless) ozone, a very irritating gas capable 
of doing immense lung damage; nitrogen dioxide, which is known to intensify 
lung damage from ozone, and acid air pollutants," Phalen said. 
</P>
<P>
The basin's air also is tainted with soot and other particles that make air 
hazy, and with cancer-causing chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
"We breathe dozens of carcinogens in every breath," and they build up in the 
body because ozone impairs the lungs' self-cleansing abilities, Phalen said. 
</P>
<P>
"In heavily populated areas, one in 10 or 20 people suffer because of air 
pollution -- headaches, increased asthma attacks, worsening of bronchitis and 
more frequent respiratory tract infections," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The most serious problems air pollution produce are not immediate symptoms, 
but the contribution to lung disease. The American Lung Assn. has estimated air 
pollution is a contributing factor in about 10% of human deaths in urban 
areas." 
</P>
<P>
But like millions of people, Phalen, his wife, Kathy, and sons Robert, 20, and 
Steven, 18, view smog mainly as a nuisance that sometimes causes burning eyes, 
headaches and chest tightness during exercise. 
</P>
<P>
Phalen considers life a balance between risks and benefits. He enjoys smoking a 
pipe to relieve tension. And while he doesn't know how chronic exposure to smog 
affects his family's health, he won't leave Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"We have excellent food, wonderful climate, a good educational system, a solid 
economy," he said. "We have good medical services and a relatively relaxed 
lifestyle. All these things promote good health. It's certainly not worth 
moving to get away from the smog." 
</P>
<P>
At home, Phalen and his family try to reduce air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
"We purchase cars with smaller engines," he said. "We limit barbecuing. We 
rarely use our fireplace. We cut way down on pleasure driving. We attempt to 
conserve electricity. We use spray products very conservatively." 
</P>
<P>
He believes the health risks of air pollution must be reduced by developing 
"more efficient transportation; better emission-control systems for cars, 
trucks, power plants and industry, and better ways of destroying our wastes." 
</P>
<P>
But Phalen opposes confrontation politics -- "Hatred is the worst pollution," 
he says -- and doesn't consider polluters bad guys. 
</P>
<P>
"Air pollution is not created by malicious toxic polluters," he says. "It's 
created by our automobiles, our industry and our generation of electricity. 
It's a consequence of our modern society, and that society appears to be 
responsible for adding approximately 40 years to our life span when we compare 
ourselves with completely undeveloped countries." 
</P>
<P>
So while smog could be eliminated by outlawing modern conveniences, "the 
resulting poverty would probably reduce our life spans," Phalen says. 
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, it's necessary to identify particularly hazardous pollutants and 
combinations of pollutants and target them for control. That's the role of our 
laboratory." 
</P>
<P>
Holmes said Phalen's 15-member team is responsible for several "important 
breakthroughs," including how human health is affected by complex mixtures of 
pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
He also credited Phalen for finding that children absorb much higher doses of 
air pollution than adults, and showing how ozone hinders breathing. 
</P>
<P>
That allowed California to justify the nation's toughest ozone standard, which 
the federal government may adopt nationally, Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
These findings came from a lab that has a $1.5 million annual budget and that 
Phalen admits "looks like a dump from the outside." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the lab contains some of the most innovative tools in air pollution 
research. Phalen and his colleagues invented many of these tools, including 
fake noses, windpipes and voice boxes. 
</P>
<P>
The fake noses are rubber cylinders with carved channels that mimic real 
nostrils. Polluted air is pumped through fake noses to simulate breathing, 
showing how much pollution reaches the lungs, and how much is deposited inside 
the nose where some contaminants can cause nasal cancer. 
</P>
<P>
To study how much windblown dust is inhaled, Phalen drills holes in the noses 
of lifelike mannequins of men, women and children. The mannequins are placed in 
a dust-filled wind tunnel. A pump serves as a fake lung, drawing dusty air 
through the nostrils and into filters. 
</P>
<P>
Phalen's laboratory also contains elaborate smog exposure chambers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 40 techniques for making smog," including tanks of pollutants, an 
ozone machine, a diesel engine and a soot-producing propane burner, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rats, ferrets and beagles breathe the noxious air, sometimes while walking on 
treadmills for studies on the effects of pollution and exercise. 
</P>
<P>
Phalen's use of animals made him a target of the Animal Liberation Front, which 
raided his lab in January, 1988, and stole 13 beagles. 
</P>
<P>
The raid, which ended Phalen's studies with dogs, was ironic. For years he 
advocated humane treatment of research animals and either adopted or found 
homes for 30 to 40 beagles whose research careers were over. 
</P>
<P>
Growing up in a large family in Oklahoma helped inspire Phalen's career. 
</P>
<P>
His father was a Navy man and his mother an accountant. Phalen was close to an 
uncle who worshipped Albert Einstein, so he became a physicist, earning a 
bachelor's degree in 1964 at San Diego State University. 
</P>
<P>
After a 1961 explosion killed three people at a nuclear reactor in Idaho, 
Phalen wondered how silver from the reactor's walls got into rescue workers' 
lungs. That was the topic of his theses for a 1966 master's degree at San Diego 
State and 1971 doctorate at the University of Rochester, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Concern for human health pervades Phalen's life because, as a child, he often 
faced sickness and death among his relatives. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved every one of them so much it bothered me," he recalled. "As a kid, I 
was always terrified of diseases." 
</P>
<P>
The uncle who admired Einstein was a pharmacist and inventor. 
</P>
<P>
"He showed me that through knowledge you can do something about a problem. You 
don't have to just be a victim, suffer and die."

ALL SIDES SPEAK OUT ON CENTINELA SCHOOLS' RACIAL TENSION

Micheal Gloud, Hawthorne Senior 
</P>
<P>
 Micheal Gloud, Hawthorne High School Associated Student Body president, is a 
17-year-old senior. He is a varsity baseball player who attended Jane Addams 
Elementary School and Yukon Intermediate School. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What do you think has been the cause of the racial tensions and student 
unrest in the district? 
</P>
<P>
A: The board members didn't respond to allegations (that the board wanted to 
fire all minority faculty members), so the students felt that what was being 
alleged was true. If the allegations were . . . that they were getting rid of 
Mr. (Ken) Crowe because he is black and the board members don't say otherwise, 
then what are the students led to believe, except that what has been alleged is 
true?. . . 
</P>
<P>
I'd say about 95% of the students who marched from Leuzinger High School had 
absolutely no idea what was going on, and they did it primarily to get out of 
class. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I believe that a lot of students on this campus, and I can't speak for 
Leuzinger, feel that this came almost directly, but definitely indirectly, from 
Mr. Crowe. A lot of this unrest and the walkout was because Mr. Crowe gave a 
public resignation and gave a little inference (that he was forced to resign 
because of his race). Then the whole student body was saying, "Oh my God. 
They're firing him because he's black, and that's not fair. We've got to go to 
his side." 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you feel having the mannequin on campus was racially insensitive? 
</P>
<P>
A: To the best of my knowledge that was completely pulled out of the closet. 
Mr. Gold had that mannequin in his room for years. . . . They wanted it painted 
. . . so one of the students was taking it across the school to the print shop 
to get it painted and, you know, he was kind of walking in circles and walking 
around making sure everybody saw it. And Mr. Crowe and Mr. (Jerome) Brown 
(Hawthorne's head of security) both saw it and they both confronted Mr. 
(Michael) Gold about it. . . . It wasn't meant to be any kind of racial slur or 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How do you feel about the anonymous notes and cartoons that were sent to 
black teachers and administrators? 
</P>
<P>
A: I'm not sure how many students know about the notes and everything. You 
know, a lot of notes can be written by students because there is a lot of 
student unrest. . . . But, as far as I know, they are all just allegations and 
have not been put to the test yet. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is there racism in the schools? 
</P>
<P>
A: One thing that I know that I can say for the students is we just want to get 
back to the learning process. The teachers, the administrators, the school 
board members and the parents, all they're thinking about is themselves. I 
stand right here at lunchtime and these are all blacks right here. There's no 
tension. I stand there with Mexicans, and there are white people and Samoans 
over here and there's no tensions. It's between themselves. And they don't seem 
to realize that what they are hurting is our learning process. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How effectively have the school board, administrators and teachers responded 
to the situation? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think that if (the school board members) would have gotten their 
allegations addressed quickly, right after the allegations were presented to 
them, then there wouldn't be all this. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Three of the school board members were elected in November. Some people say 
they have not been given enough time to address the problems. Do you agree? 
</P>
<P>
A: OK, they come in and (the allegations) are new to them. But is it still 
going to take three or four months before they can answer to the public why 
there is student unrest, why all the parents and all the teachers think there 
is racism in the school? 
</P>
<P>
Q: What about teachers? 
</P>
<P>
A: There are a handful of teachers here that are using up their class time (to 
talk about the racism allegations) and are going about this process wrong. But 
as for the other teachers, they just want to get on with the teaching process. 
. . . Mr. (Charles) Prater, (a black teacher who has been the victim of 
racially offensive notes and cartoons) I feel, blows things way out of 
proportion, and he wants to go on with increasing the magnitude of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How have administrators handled the situation? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think that especially (Supt.) McKinley Nash should have seen this coming. 
. . . I feel that he allowed this to happen. He knew something was going to 
happen, and he didn't take enough assertive action to see that it didn't. That 
goes for Mr. Crowe too. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What should they have done? 
</P>
<P>
A: They should have tried their best to keep it out of school by maybe making 
it clear to the school board that these kinds of things need to be discussed 
behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What should be done to address the problems? 
</P>
<P>
A: The student unrest is over, for the most part. We are uniting more. This is 
more of a school like it used to be. . . . (Administrators, teachers and board 
members) need to solve these problems behind closed doors, because as soon as 
it affects us it affects everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Some people have said that the district needs to offer white teachers 
programs to help them better relate to minorities. Do you agree? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. I think we all need to be more open. I think minority teachers should be 
more accepting of what is going on. They need to accept that there is racism 
everywhere but that it can be minimal. But when they take something like (the 
mannequin incident) and blow that up, that's just wrong. They're making 
something out of nothing. They, minority teachers, need to be more accepting so 
we can all work together in the same environment and help the children learn to 
the best of their ability and reach their goals. That's what they are here for. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Has any good come from all of this? 
</P>
<P>
A: No, not a damn bit of good, unless we find through investigations that the 
allegations were correct and people are prosecuted.

Neil Minami, Hawthorne Teacher 
</P>
<P>
Neil Minami, vice president of the Centinela Valley Secondary Teachers Assn., 
has been at Hawthorne High School for almost 22 years and has taught driver's 
education and social studies. He is of Japanese ancestry. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What do you think has been the cause of the racial tensions and student 
unrest in the district? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think the consensus of most of the teachers, and I would say a pretty 
large majority, is that it's been caused by a few adults and obviously I can't 
name them. It seems to most of us that they've been using the community, 
they've been using students and they've used teachers to stir up some type of 
trouble in the district. And for what reasons other than maybe personal gain, I 
don't know. . . . We are hoping an investigation will take place and maybe 
we'll find out after that. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What evidence do you have that adults were involved? 
</P>
<P>
A: During the walkout at Leuzinger . . . the gates were left open. Leuzinger is 
a closed campus. How can all the gates be left open on one specific day? . . . 
We have recorded evidence that the (campus security) guards told them: "Come 
on, let's go. Follow the group and get off campus." That I assume will come up 
in an investigation if they do it. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Some people have said that the mannequin and the anonymous notes and 
cartoons indicate that there is racism among the white teaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
A: That mannequin has been on campus for nine or 10 years and has been used in 
that class all this time. So, I don't know. It might have just been bad timing. 
. . . If you know Dr. (Michael) Gold (the teacher who used the mannequin in a 
lesson on special effects), you know there is no racial intent in that. He's 
far from being a racist. And obviously these people don't know Dr. Gold that 
well. I've worked with him for probably 14 or 15 years and there is no way, no 
way, he is a racist. . . . 
</P>
<P>
So, I think a lot of these things are really blown out of proportion and I 
think it's really sad that they have to blame it on racism. . . . Ken Crowe has 
always said there is a small group of white teachers that are racist. He's 
never named them. We would like to know because I think there are a lot of 
white teachers . . . that are very upset about being grouped in with this 
possible small group of racists. . . . But I'll tell you I've been here 21 
years, and I haven't met a racist yet. You know, I mean a true racist bigot. . 
. . There are some great people in this school and it's really sad they've 
labeled our faculty as being racist. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How effectively have the school board, administrators and teachers responded 
to the situation? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think the (new school board) has held in there outstandingly because the 
pressures that they're getting from all these antagonists makes it hard to run 
a school board when you are trying to battle the (allegations). . . . They've 
always been open to discussion and listening. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How about the administration? 
</P>
<P>
A: There haven't been any multiracial in-service meetings . . . for teachers to 
understand different cultures and different races. . . . So, I guess 
administratively they haven't done anything. . . . (During the protest) why 
didn't the administration call us and say: "Hey there are a group of kids 
coming over to Hawthorne. Close your doors." I mean, they had plenty of time. 
They called a couple rooms or a couple buildings and that's it. There are a lot 
of questions that have never been answered. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What do you think should be done to address the problems? 
</P>
<P>
A: When there is property damage and kids leaving school, there's a chance of 
them getting hit on the street by cars . . . and up until this time (Supt. 
McKinley Nash) has called for no investigations. . . . I think that's why the 
teachers got a petition to request an investigation. We got 90-plus signatures 
at Hawthorne and 77 at Leuzinger. We want a full investigation. Who would 
investigate this? I don't know, but we sure would like to know who's at the 
bottom of this. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Some people would say you should let bygones be bygones and concentrate on 
education. 
</P>
<P>
A: Too many harsh words have already been said to hurt a lot of people and I 
don't know if (teachers) are willing to say let's let bygones be bygones. I 
mean, when you accuse people of being a racist . . . I don't think they are 
going to forget those things. I think they are going to want answers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Unless you were there (during the protests) you can't believe the terror that 
some of these women teachers faced. I've never seen women teachers upset before 
like that. I mean, we have had meetings and for the most part most of the women 
don't say anything. But when we had our meeting with Ken Crowe (after the 
protests) they were (criticizing) him and I mean some of them were almost at 
tears. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Has any good come from the controversy? 
</P>
<P>
A: I tried to find something good from all of this. . . . The only good that I 
can see is that we've experienced something that most people will never go 
through. I think as a group, as a faculty, we've become stronger. . . . If 
you're talking about things that are good, maybe . . . it's been a learning 
experience, and I think we have probably grown in that respect and we know we 
can hang in there together.

Francine Patterson, Mother of 2 Students 
</P>
<P>
 Francine Patterson's two sons, 15 and 17 years old, attend Hawthorne High 
School. She is a member of the Committee for Racial Free Education, a recently 
formed parents group that seeks to eliminate racism from the district and 
promote the voice of black parents in school issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you think has been the cause of the racial tension and student 
unrest in the district? 
</P>
<P>
A: Well, I think it goes back a long way. Number one, as far as having black 
leadership, a black principal, a black superintendent, I think that a lot of 
the people are not used to taking orders or being disciplined by a black man 
and it seems to pose some type of problem for them. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How widespread do you think this is? 
</P>
<P>
A: Well, I think it would be ludicrous to think that all of the white teachers 
are racist. I would not begin to support that type of idea. But the ones that 
are (racist) seem to be the ones that are most vocal at this point. . . . The 
squeaking wheel gets the oil and that is what is happening at this point. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you attribute the mannequin and the anonymous notes and cartoons to this 
problem? 
</P>
<P>
A: Well, I think it's a scare tactic. It stems way back to the early '60s where 
(people thought), "If I frighten them enough maybe they will go away." That 
doesn't seem to be the case. We are not going to go away. . . . I've talked to 
a lot of parents and a lot of them say, "This is 1990 and racism just could not 
exist at this stage of life." But in fact it does. They are shocked. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Are you concerned for your children? 
</P>
<P>
A: I'm concerned for all children at the high school. And that's all children, 
not only black children. You have Hispanic children there, you have white 
children there, and those children can be indoctrinated to believe some of the 
things that these teachers are teaching them and I think that's sad. . . . For 
Nancy Nuesseler (president of the district teachers union) to call the 
superintendent a Stepin Fetchit, that should not happen. That definitely should 
not happen. . . . I think she should not be in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How effectively have the school board, administrators and teachers responded 
to the situation? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think the school board has been poor in their representation of 
themselves. I think that it would have been easier if they had talked with us 
as parents to try to allay our fears and let us know that they are working to 
try and stop what is happening. But they have refused to meet with us. . . . 
And you ask to speak at board meetings and they are rude . . . and they will 
not address the parents. . . . (My) kids are my future and they actually are 
(the board's) future also, and if they look at it that way they would do 
something about what is happening rather than let it go on and on. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How have the administrators dealt with this? 
</P>
<P>
A: I went to (Supt. McKinley) Nash's office and I asked him, because I was 
interested in knowing, what is going on. He told me that he had made 
recommendations (to quell the racial tensions) to the board and that the board 
has chosen not to act on those recommendations. That to me, again, is proving 
that if a black man is giving orders or even making recommendations, that they 
just don't adhere to any of his recommendations. . . . And I don't know the 
specifics of the recommendations, but I know that he told me he made the 
recommendations and nothing was done. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How have the teachers responded? 
</P>
<P>
A: The teachers have been rather quiet most of the time. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you feel Ken Crowe is being forced to resign because of his race? 
</P>
<P>
A: Well, I feel he's being forced out either because of his race or because 
they don't like him, they being the school board members or some teachers who 
have influence over the school board. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What do you think should be done to address the problem? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think very basic things should be done. Number one, we need to address the 
school board. They need to get rid of Miss (Ruth) Morales (school board 
president). She needs to go. She's very dogmatic. She's very condescending. 
She's very arrogant and rude and I think, in my opinion, I think she needs to 
go. She is nonresponsive to parents, and my vote put her in and my vote will 
take her out. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What about the rest of the board? 
</P>
<P>
A: It's hard to say because I know the only vocal member has been Miss (Pam) 
Sturgeon. . . . She appears to listen. She has stated more than once that she 
is not racist. She has stated that she cares about all kids. . . . Miss 
(Amparo) Font has not. I have not heard one word from Miss Font. I have not 
heard one word from Miss (Jacqueline) Carrera and Mr. (Michael) Escalante. I 
have not heard anything from any of those people. They allow Miss Morales to 
speak for them, and if they allow Miss Morales to speak for them, they should 
have the same fate as Miss Morales, which would be recall. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What do you think should be done to address the problem? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think the reinstatement of Mr. Crowe is imperative. . . . Overall 
education and a little bit of caring and respect (are needed). That is the 
bottom line. If you respect me, then I have no other recourse than to respect 
you. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Some people have said school officials should put aside these allegations of 
racism and concentrate on education. Do you agree? 
</P>
<P>
A: That would be very nice if you could just stop that, but part of education 
is to be able to stand up for yourself no matter what color, no matter what 
sex, whatever. You have to be able to stand up for yourself and you don't allow 
things to happen to you simply because of your race and just sweep it under the 
carpet. It just does not happen that way. It will not happen in this case.

RESTRAINT ON PRAYERS VIOLATES FREEDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Turmoil has arisen in the media regarding a letter sent by Tustin Mayor Richard 
B. Edgar to clergymen stating, "however, in the future we are required to ask 
that all speakers refrain from using language that might be construed as 
endorsing a particular religious belief." 
</P>
<P>
Or as Tustin City Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Rourke says: "Speaking about Jesus Christ is obviously identifying a 
particular religion. . . . Clergy should not identify any particular religion." 
This is the heart of the dilemma. Mayor Edgar writes: "The interpretation of 
what I said has been misconstrued to say that Jesus Christ could not be 
mentioned. I did not write that." To the contrary, the interpretation has not 
been "misconstrued." 
</P>
<P>
His city attorney emphatically states a court decision in which a clergyman was 
told to remove all references to Christ. While Mayor Edgar cleverly sidesteps 
the issue to avoid controversy, Rourke plays devil's advocate. 
</P>
<P>
During November, Rourke billed the city of Tustin only $40,955.13 for one month 
of legal services. Then be began writing his "prayer memorandums" to harass 
local clergy. Isn't it interesting how this explosive religious issue has 
become a time-consuming legal issue? When are Tustin citizens going to wake up 
and hold their public officials accountable? 
</P>
<P>
By definition, invocation is prayer to a God or deity. In 1962, the U.S. 
Supreme Court ruled that the state cannot determine the content of any prayer. 
No U.S. Supreme Court ruling has ever held that the use of the words Christ, 
Jesus, or Jesus Christ during an invocation at any legislative session is a 
violation of the First Amendment establishment clause. 
</P>
<P>
Rourke's restraint on "the language by which clergy pray to God" is censorship 
and prior restraint of religious freedom protected by the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Now you understand why we chanted "Remove Rourke."

IT'S THE ARENAS AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's an element of deja vu in the contest between Anaheim and Santa Ana to 
be the first on the block to have its very own indoor sports arena. In the 
mid-1980s, a proposal for an arena in Santa Ana ran smack into opposition from 
residents; later a similar proposal fell by the wayside in Anaheim, where the 
City Council didn't go for the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Now the two cities are locked in a head-to-head race to build an arena that 
neither city seemed to want enough before. The difference today is that the 
climate has changed and so has the price tag. There is no sports franchise in 
sight. Even if there were, there is no certainty that having professional 
basketball and hockey teams in Orange County would result in an economic boon 
to the area. The cost of building a facility today is much higher than it was 
the last time the debate was held. 
</P>
<P>
When the failed Westdome project was considered, Santa Ana had a $37-million 
bond sale on the table. Today, the city's proposal for a privately owned arena 
has an estimated construction cost of $75 million, with the city subsidizing up 
to $1 million a year for 10 years. When Anaheim considered an earlier arena, 
plans called for a $40-million project; today, the estimate for a proposed, 
publicly owned facility is $94 million, with a plan for public subsidy up to 
$1.5 million a year. Clearly, one of the few certainties of having such 
facilities is that anticipated costs climb through the roof. 
</P>
<P>
A few years back, the National Basketball Assn., a likely tenant, was looking 
to expand. Today, it isn't. With Wayne Gretzky in Los Angeles, it's unlikely 
that a National Hockey League franchise would draw much interest in Orange 
County. Both cities are going out on a limb because franchises aren't likely to 
make a commitment unless there's a facility. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim proposal is compromised further by the delays resulting from 
lawsuits filed against it. A Santa Ana facility would be operated by Spectacor 
Management Group, which already operates the Los Angeles Sports Arena and is 
prohibited by contract from managing a similar facility within 75 miles. Its 
situation in Los Angeles would have to change, so its interest in Santa Ana 
looks like a fallback plan if it doesn't get its way with the Los Angeles 
Coliseum Commission. 
</P>
<P>
So there are many reasons against running this race. For any serious arena 
project to fly, it probably should be something the county is involved in, not 
competing cities within it. All things considered, the competition between 
Santa Ana and Anaheim for a new indoor sports arena is a race to nowhere.

RETIREE'S TICKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Disbelief and then anger was my response as I read "Retiree Gets a Ticket for 
Picking Up Trash" (March 13). 
</P>
<P>
As an Irvine taxpayer for 10 years, I wonder if the Irvine Police Department is 
overstaffed or is undertrained in recognizing criminal behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Grinenko's caring, smiling face greeted my walking partners and me every 
morning for the two years I lived in Northwood. He walked the same route every 
morning. He prided himself on collecting cans and bottles from the trash cans 
at the two parks and then giving the proceeds to charity. 
</P>
<P>
Keep up the good work, Nick. I am relieved my current tax dollars didn't 
underwrite this incident!

SANTA ANA SCHOOLS MEET CHALLENGE OF ETHNICALLY VARIED STUDENT BODY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUDY CASTRUITA, Rudy Castruita is superintendent of the Santa Ana Unified 
School District. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's a new student to be educated in the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
As superintendent of the Santa Ana Unified School District, I see evidence 
daily of the increasing number of Hispanic and other minority students 
enrolling in Southern California schools. 
</P>
<P>
With approximately 43,000 students, Santa Ana Unified is the largest school 
district in Orange County and the ninth largest in the state. Seventy-eight 
percent of our students are Hispanic and an additional 11% are from Pacific Rim 
countries. Approximately 56% of our students are classified as limited English 
proficient (LEP). Students in our district speak nearly 40 languages and 
dialects. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the many countries and languages they represent, they also bring 
varying goals and values into our system. Children from Central America, 
Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos know the horrors of war. Besides teaching the 
educational essentials, we must also teach them democracy. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge of the 21st Century is to acculturate this diversity into a 
cohesive, cooperative student population. Because SAUSD has had to face these 
challenges before some of our neighbors, we may have reached some conclusions 
or tried some alternatives that could be useful to others. 
</P>
<P>
We must take a serious look at what we're doing to equip our teacher corps. Our 
active relationships with UC Irvine, Cal State Fullerton, Chapman College and 
Rancho Santiago College allow us to collaborate on a number of activities that 
benefit their students and ours. For example, As part of the focus on teacher 
training, our director of Bilingual/English as a Second Language program makes 
presentations to UCI teacher trainees about the realities of teaching in 
today's multicultural schools, and part of our cooperative efforts with Rancho 
Santiago allows prospective teachers hands-on opportunities at one of our 
elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
SAUSD offers free cultural awareness and Spanish-language training for teachers 
in addition to continuing staff development. 
</P>
<P>
Hispanic families and others who have immigrated to this country have done so 
to find a better life and success. Whatever our feelings about the numbers of 
immigrants coming to our shores, it is our job to educate the children of our 
communities and to help them become successful. 
</P>
<P>
To achieve that goal, I tell students that they must first learn English and 
that education must be their No. 1 priority. In my outreach to our Hispanic 
families, my repeated message is that the key to a brighter future for their 
children is education. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Unified is also in the process of hiring a community liaison to 
involve our total community in supporting the education system. We have a very 
strong parent group -- Padres Unidos -- at Madison Elementary, and we want to 
have this kind of involvement at each school so that all our parents can have 
input into their children's education. 
</P>
<P>
In collaboration with Cal State Fullerton, we offer Family Math for elementary 
school parents. This program allows parents and children to come into the 
schools at night and learn, in their native language, about the math program 
their children are studying and about how they can help at home. 
</P>
<P>
SAUSD is also developing a videotape to help parents understand how they may 
become involved at school, how to check their children's progress with teachers 
and what social services are available to them. 
</P>
<P>
To help non-English-speaking students and their families in their transition 
into our district, we have developed a Registration and Testing Center to 
assess students' language and educational abilities and to offer parents a 
choice of English-acquisition programs. This centralized facility also takes 
the burden of testing and processing new students off the individual school 
sites. From July through December, more than 3,000 students were served by the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
On school campuses we have instituted newcomer (at elementary) and EASE (at 
secondary) classes to help students prepare for the regular classroom. They 
receive instruction in emergency English skills, learn procedures for getting 
lunch and supplies and become familiar with the campus and its rules. 
</P>
<P>
These responsibilities, too, were once handled in individual classrooms as new 
students registered throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
Many of our students' needs are great. It is not unusual for our district to 
receive new, young students who do not know how to hold a crayon or who can not 
even name their colors. We frequently receive high-school-age students who not 
only do not speak English, but who also are illiterate in their native 
language. 
</P>
<P>
Many of this district's top students, along with students from UCI and Rancho 
Santiago, are involved in after-school tutoring. The YMCA this spring will 
begin an after-school program in our district, and we have been guaranteed 
funding to begin a school readiness program next fall. Children as young as 3 
will take part in this effort to help them enter school on equal footing with 
their peers. 
</P>
<P>
And we must continue to re-examine our efforts. A year ago, we put together a 
task force to study our services to limited-English-speaking students. They 
came back with more than 50 recommendations we are now addressing.

As an example, through the efforts of our director of secondary curriculum, the 
UC system has agreed that all LEP or bilingual content area courses are 
acceptable for their entry requirements, as are their English-only 
counterparts. LEP algebra I would be viewed no differently than the standard 
algebra I. 
</P>
<P>
SAT preparation courses are offered free in summer school, and we've increased 
the number of students continuing their education after graduation. Nearly 80% 
of our graduates pursue some form of higher education. Last year UCI did a 
transcript survey and determined that 23% of our seniors were qualified for UC 
schools. That number is up from 18% from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Turning Point, Peer Assistance, Neighborhoods in Action are all a part of our 
total community approach to communicating with and helping our students and 
their families. We recently produced our first bilingual newsletter, and our 
cable TV bulletin board now offers messages in Spanish as well as English. The 
Board of Education believes that it is our responsibility to communicate with 
the community we serve. 
</P>
<P>
Serving the divergent needs of the new California student is a difficult 
challenge, but I don't believe we're going to lose this war. It will take time, 
but I see a ray of hope. Santa Ana is not sitting back passively.

FRENZY STIRRED UP OVER MEDFLY SPRAYING IS SCARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The current hysteria over malathion spraying exemplifies how easy it is for the 
press and a few protesters (originally) to whip the general public into a 
frenzy, and that worries me more than the pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
The flu season, one of the worst in years, is in full swing, but every 
fruitcake who comes down with flu symptoms now blames it on the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Others complain of headaches, stomachaches, breathing difficulties, etc. It 
doesn't surprise me. These are the same symptoms as anxiety, and these people 
have worked themselves into a tizzy over nothing. 
</P>
<P>
We use malathion, according to manufacturer's instructions, for fleas in the 
summer (we don't have cats or dogs but our neighbors do and their pets pass 
through our yards). Anyway, the state is using .000049 of an ounce of malathion 
per square foot (about .9 of an ounce over our one-third acre lot), whereas we 
use five ounces per gallon of water. 
</P>
<P>
I can't help but wonder how many of those standing around screaming about the 
spraying eat junk foods (especially sugar-laden and high-cholesterol), smoke, 
drink alcohol, etc. 
</P>
<P>
I think it's pathetically hysterical that the cast of "Cheers" joined 
protesters recently. These people are doing a show that glorifies booze, not to 
mention sex. Don't they know how harmful drinking (and the drunk driver) is to 
one's health? 
</P>
<P>
So, do I think malathion is harmful to my health? Only if my neighbors read 
this. They have been so brainwashed and frightened by the media and 
office-seeking politicians, they will probably stone me!

I wonder what would have happened if we had had the equivalent of our current 
crop of "Medfly worriers" shouting from the rooftops when the vaccines for 
infantile paralysis, measles and diphtheria, to name a few, were developed and 
given to the public. 
</P>
<P>
I've lived and raised a family through these scourges, and to the best of my 
knowledge, there have been no side effects of any consequence to any and all 
without any of the side noise of unsubstantiated and imagined claims we have to 
listen to today from a host of lay people and vote-hungry and attention-seeking 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
I'm satisfied that the health department scientists today are just as competent 
and concerned about public health, if not more so, as they were when the above 
cures were developed. 
</P>
<P>
Come on now, you politicians. It appears that we need a cause. Why don't you 
whip up the fire to get an inner- and inter-urban transit system for Orange 
County and Los Angeles that makes some sense, or is that too big?

RECYCLING PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County is in need of a mandatory recycling program. Cities across the 
nation have already adopted routine recycling along with regular trash pickups. 
</P>
<P>
Separating glass, newspapers, aluminum cans, and plastic bottles isn't too much 
to ask of this environmentally indifferent society. 
</P>
<P>
For something that takes little or no effort, the results are phenomenal. For 
instance, the state of Washington is testament to that fact, as its 
metropolitan areas have adopted a requisite program for citizens to recycle 
reusable materials, and it is undoubtedly one of the cleanest states. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County isn't exactly pristine (any longer), and something that is so 
simple and can be so beneficial is an obvious necessity. It makes one ask how 
stupid we are for not having implemented such a plan already.

ROHRABACHER'S GOALS FOR ART IMPOSSIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Art! Who comprehends her? With whom can one consult concerning this great 
goddess?" wrote Ludwig van Beethoven. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) suggests 
in his recent Times column (March 19) that only himself, Jesse Helms, and 
others who share the Ed Meese mind-set are blessed with such knowledge. As if a 
small group of dictators would be a true improvement over the current 
"Soviet-style committee system," which he so roundly condemns. 
</P>
<P>
His position seems to be: Government should not be involved with funding art 
(through the National Endowment for the Arts), but as long as it is, we must 
legislate that art into something Jerry Falwell would be proud to hang on his 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
Might I suggest that such a goal is impossible. When you take "art" and mold it 
and squeeze it and rip its guts out and pretty it up so that it finally can 
offend absolutely nobody, you no longer have "art." At best, you'll end up with 
some form of visual Muzak. Unless you change the name of the NEA to the 
"National Endowment for Pretty Things" you'll look very hypocritical. 
</P>
<P>
If Rohrabacher is serious about getting government out of the art business, the 
solution is obvious. Don't bother fighting through a bill to control the type 
of art the NEA funds, but fight through a bill giving tax breaks to privately 
funded arts groups. The private sector will pick up the ball and you'll kill 
two birds with one stone: you'll be able to cut off government funding of art 
completely, and you won't have to worry about whether current art is offensive 
or not. 
</P>
<P>
Then, once Rohrabacher's done piddling around with this censorship garbage, he 
can get to the business of eliminating the things that government funds that 
are truly offensive to taxpayers, like the Department of Education, HUD, the 
Department of Transportation and at least 50% of the Defense Department.

DANGERS OF LEAD POISONING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your March 8 story "Officials Discount Lead-Poisoning Statistics" may have left 
your readers falsely reassured. 
</P>
<P>
It was a direct response to an earlier one which indicated that as many as 
27.3% of Ventura County's children may have unacceptably high levels of lead in 
their blood caused primarily by exposure to lead-based paint. Local officials 
discounted the survey saying that "lead exposure to children cannot be that 
high" because "many of the houses in the county were built after lead-based 
paint was banned by the state." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, lead-based paint was not banned until 1977, a mere 13 years ago. A 
recent drive-through tour of Ventura and Oxnard revealed that there are 
hundreds and hundreds of homes built prior to this time. One can reasonably 
assume that many of these are the residences of children ages 6 months to 5 
years, the age group most affected by lead poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
Because the survey was based on a national random sample of metropolitan areas, 
Lawrence Dodds, Ventura County's director of Public Health Services, felt the 
statistics were probably lower than indicated because he questioned whether 
"you could extrapolate from cities like Oakland and Philadelphia to Ventura" 
because our houses are much newer. He further stated that he "would expect a 
low likelihood of those levels being accurate." 
</P>
<P>
I would like to counter by saying that a survey which admits it did not include 
Asians and Hispanics increases the probability of error in the other direction. 
The percentage is probably higher, not lower, when one takes into account such 
a blatant omission. Isn't it common knowledge that in most of our school 
districts fully 50% of the students fall into these two omitted groups? 
</P>
<P>
What we all need to do is simply admit that lead poisoning definitely does 
occur among the children of Ventura County. Even if only 100 children are 
affected, we, their families and the schools they will one day attend have a 
significant problem. 
</P>
<P>
The effects of lead poisoning include memory impairment, behavior problems, 
lower intelligence quotients and in the most severe cases mental retardation. 
All are irreversible. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't do any of us any good to dismiss lead poisoning as a "relatively 
insignificant problem" as did a spokesman for a building trades association. 
All children deserve the opportunity to thrive and function at maximum 
potential. Those who become even minimally damaged place yet another stress on 
an already overburdened public schools system.

IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your March 12 stories on the building space problems of two library systems -- 
Chicago's as your Column One feature and Ventura County's in the newcomer 
section -- were particularly important to me. Both of them have been vital to 
the enrichment of my life and the advancement of my career in writing, 
reporting, editing, publishing, photography, television and public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
So has the Library of Congress, which in the 1940s and '50s was in a bind with 
room for only 270 miles of bookshelves (now over 540), which for years was my 
across-the-street neighbor; and in the '20s the library in Sedalia, Mo. It was 
in 1914, when I was about to turn 10, that my family moved from primitive rural 
areas (northern Michigan, Alabama, and the Arkansas Ozarks) to the college town 
of Albion, in southern Michigan, that I first discovered that there was such a 
thing as a public library, with all kinds of books, most of which I hadn't 
known existed. A few years later that two-room Albion Ladies' Public Library, 
on the second floor of a clubhouse, was succeeded by a Carnegie library with 
its own building and with trained librarians, and the whole wide world and 
universe began to open up to me. 
</P>
<P>
I have just one fault to find with your stories about the Chicago and Ventura 
libraries. Your depiction of a public library is one of a static institution. 
But a well-ordered public library is most kinetic by nature. It is not just a 
place where aimless persons come in to read books just to pass the time away. 
It is a place where people young and old come when they need to and can, to 
find the answers to questions, to seek out the world and to hold communion with 
wise and otherwise men and women, boys and girls anywhere and everywhere, now 
and in centuries past. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 650,000 volumes in the E. P. Foster Library here in Ventura (along 
with newspapers and magazines) one can find answers to his questions, and new 
questions that never occurred to him. If that's not enough, he can draw on the 
resources of the great state library in Sacramento, or if need be, the Library 
of Congress . 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Dixie Adeniran (director of the county's Library Services Agency) 
assures me that Ventura does not aim to be a "research library for the ages" 
but addresses itself to this area, its past and present and possible future. It 
seeks to serve the needs of its users. That's quite an order to fill, and only 
a vigorous effort can succeed. How effective it can be will depend upon its 
facilities, of course, and staff, but mainly its users.

JOHNSON IS ALMOST TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE

<TEXT>
<P>
Up until Tuesday, it was safe to say that Kevin Johnson did his best work in 
silk shorts and a fancy tank top. All-Star point guard. Mr. Twenty-Ten. He 
looks like he was born in hightops. And yet, now it seems he's even better in a 
suit and tie. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday morning, dressed as though he were going to meet bankers, Johnson came 
home to unveil his vision of St. Hope Academy, sort of a Boys' Town with a 
point guard in the Pat O'Brien role. "That's what everybody says, anyway," 
Johnson says. "I've never seen the movie. I guess I'll have to rent it." 
</P>
<P>
Nah. Why rent fantasy when you're living reality? I mean, could anyone be more 
genuine than Kevin Johnson? Newspapers are full of the headline "Local Boy 
Makes Good." But how often does the praiseworthy local boy remember where he 
came from? 
</P>
<P>
Call him one in a million, but KJ does. After four years at the University of 
California and two more in the National Basketball Assn. -- when he quickly 
became only the fifth player to average more than 20 points and 10 assists for 
a season, and is on a pace to make it two in a row -- Johnson still summers in 
his hometown, still lives with George (Grampy) Johnson, his grandfather, still 
treasures familiar sights and sounds. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's charity is legendary. He gave the Mazda RX-7 out of his driveway to a 
friend. He sent a check for $5,000 to a hard-luck security guard. He donates 
with such regularity to an Oakland elementary school that it has an annual KJ 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson has paid to have a friend's teeth repaired. When he was still a student 
at Cal, he would stick a handful of dollars into the needy fist of a homeless 
couple he often saw, for no other reason than, "They looked so in love." 
</P>
<P>
But the project on Johnson's drawing board now makes all of what he's done 
before resemble a man dropping spare change in a Salvation Army pot. 
</P>
<P>
The local boy who made good is extending a hand of help to his old backyard. 
Recently, Johnson invested $40,000 in a plot of turf in the Oak Park 
neighborhood across from Christian Brothers High School that served as a 
repository for fast food bags and broken bottles. Borrowing from Brigham Young, 
KJ happily said, "This is the place." 
</P>
<P>
It even had the right address -- 16th Avenue and Martin Luther King Boulevard 
-- as though it beckoned someone with a vision to come to this place to do 
something special. That someone would be Johnson, who keeps King among his 
short list of heroes. 
</P>
<P>
Sometime between now and June 1, there will be a groundbreaking on that 
forgotten square. Then an Oak Park architect and an Old Blue contractor will 
set Johnson's dream in concrete. 
</P>
<P>
By Christmas, Johnson hopes to see a finished, 7,000-square-foot home for St. 
Hope, complete with six classrooms, multi-purpose room, recreation hall, 
library, two bedrooms, an eating hall and offices. The place will cost more 
than a half-million to construct, another $150,000 annually to maintain. 
</P>
<P>
"All I do -- the fund-raisers, the speeches, the appearances -- that's all in 
everybody else's community," Johnson says. "I wanted to do something here." 
</P>
<P>
In an age when the enlightened seven-figure athlete argues that it's up to 
someone else to serve as role model and lantern, Johnson has stepped forward 
with an idea as old as Wheaties boxes. Black athletes, he argues, are not 
visible enough in the black community. Get-rich-quick drug dealers too often 
fill the gap. 
</P>
<P>
That's where St. Hope comes in, encouraging, says Johnson, "personal growth and 
character development." The inaugural program began last July, based at 
Sacramento High, for 15 boys aged between 9 and 16. Johnson hand-selected the 
charter class -- his guinea pigs -- from among friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
For seven weeks, there were 2 1/2-hour classes three times each week, with four 
volunteer teachers instructing in various academic disciplines. Johnson took 
the final 20 minutes of each session to lead group discussions. There were also 
field trips to Oakland for a baseball game, to movies, a church-sponsored 
overnight camp and "Fun Day" at Arco Arena. 
</P>
<P>
During the school year, St. Hope offers tutoring and regular group discussions. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the current group played in a summer basketball league, and in the 
season just concluded, three St. Hopers claimed Sacramento High team awards. 
However, future candidates -- boys and girls -- won't be screened for their 
jump shots. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they will be measured by St. Hope's only yardstick: a desire to 
improve in life. Says Johnson, "We'll base success on effort. Try. Be a little 
bit better than you were the day before." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson hopes to inspire more of that kind of thinking when St. Hope Academy 
has risen bright and shining from the dirt and weeds at 16th and Martin Luther 
King. Meanwhile, he's hoping to get help at a building fund benefit dinner at 
the Radisson Hotel on April 11. Ronnie Lott, Wayman Tisdale and Johnson will 
speak. The Sacramento Kings and Suns will attend. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's kids need an alternative to boredom," Johnson says. "With drugs, how 
much they're seen every day . . . if they don't have good role models, some of 
them are going to make decisions that aren't very smart."

LOCKOUT MAY NOT HURT LOADED ROYALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG HORST, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
KANSAS CITY, Mo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If anybody can find anything good in the lockout that shortened spring 
training, it might be the Kansas City Royals. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals opened camp belatedly this week with a lineup that is virtually set 
after a winter flurry of deals. The only competition is in center field, where 
Jim Eisenreich is pushing Willie Wilson for the starting position after being 
named Royals player of the year in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not to say we can be cavalier," General Manager John Schuerholz said of 
the three-week spring session leading up to the April 9 opener in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not in the position of some other teams that have to make major 
decisions. But we're going to have to pay careful attention to our players, 
keeping close watch on their conditioning to make sure they don't push 
themselves too fast and injure themselves." 
</P>
<P>
The Royals, the first team ever to sport the two reigning Cy Young winners on 
the same roster, are convinced they can win the American League West after 
finishing seven games back of Oakland last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we have a very legitimate chance to be a championship team," 
Schuerholz said. "We're focused on 1990 and that's our commitment." 
</P>
<P>
The Royals made a huge commitment to free agents for the first time in their 
history, signing National League Cy Young winner Mark Davis to a $3 million 
contract along with Storm Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Dotson was also signed to be the fifth starter, and Kansas City traded 
Charlie Leibrandt to Atlanta to get Gerald Perry as designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
The signing of Mark Davis teams him with American League Cy Young winner Bret 
Saberhagen, who was virtually unhittable in the last month of last season. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals clubhouse now is occupied by players making widely divergent 
salaries. Mark Davis, a newcomer, is now the highest paid player on a team that 
includes such Royals veterans as George Brett and Frank White as well as 
Saberhagen. 
</P>
<P>
Brett, the franchise player, created a stir in January when he complained the 
Royals were not paying enough attention to him and that possibly he should be 
traded if the Royals would not renegotiate his contract. 
</P>
<P>
The Kansas City first baseman later called reporters to his home in an unusual 
session and apologized for the remarks, saying he and Royals owner Ewing 
Kauffman had reached an understanding. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals also have an arbitration loser in Bo Jackson, and Eisenreich settled 
for $475,000, about half of what he was seeking in arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
"In my view, it's not a problem," Schuerholz said. "I'm not going to say that 
there are not professional egos in place. But these guys know the free agent 
system was created by them for their benefit and if some of their brethren are 
able to take advantage of it momentarily they know they will maybe have a 
chance to benefit in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Brett said he also believed the team would come together. 
</P>
<P>
"Once they get down there with the guys and start playing baseball, I think 
they'll be thinking baseball," Brett said. "We have too much to lose to let 
petty jealousies affect us." 
</P>
<P>
On the field, the Royals will lead with what could be the strongest pitching 
staff in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen finished 23-6 last year to set a Royals record for victories. He led 
the league with a 2.16 earned run average, 12 complete games and 262 1/3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen is followed by fastballer Mark Gubicza, a 15-game winner last year, 
and Tom Gordon, who won 17 despite a late-season slump. Gubicza says he has 
recovered from a shoulder injury that bothered him late last season. 
</P>
<P>
Storm Davis is penciled in as the fourth starter to be followed by Dotson. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals traded their only left-handed starter, Leibrandt, for Gerald Perry. 
Perry, who will be the designated hitter, says he has recovered from a shoulder 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
One of the effects of signing Mark Davis to be the closer was strengthening the 
middle-relief corps. Steve Farr and Jeff Montgomery, both right-handers, move 
down as set-up men for Davis after each saved 18 games last season. 
</P>
<P>
The infield is set with Brett, who drove in 80 runs after missing 35 games with 
a knee injury, at first, White at second, Kurt Stillwell at short and Kevin 
Seitzer at third. 
</P>
<P>
Eisenreich may get the nod in center after batting .293 last year while playing 
all three outfield positions. He drove in 59 runs and stole 27 bases. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson had his fifth straight disappointing season, hitting just .253 in 112 
games. Since he batted .301 in 1984, Wilson has hit .278, .269, 279, .262 and 
.253 while drawing criticism for not walking enough in his leadoff position. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who made a memorable throw to cut down a runner at the plate in 
Seattle last year but had another second-half slide, is in left and Danny 
Tartabull, still with the team after all those trade rumors, is in right. 
</P>
<P>
Venerable Bob Boone signed to catch a 17th season, although Manager John Wathan 
may want to work in Mike Macfarlane for seasoning.

SHE'S JUST DOODLIN ALONG AT LOS ALAMITOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
LOS ALAMITOS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Doodlin stands a queen-sized 16 1/2 hands, but the 5-year-old bay mare is a 
mere handful in the eyes of her handlers. 
</P>
<P>
That no doubt is because she knows the hands that feed her and tuck her in at 
bedtime, according to owner Debra Budahn, partner with her husband Gary in the 
Gusty Stable. 
</P>
<P>
"Doodlin is one of the biggest pacers at Los Alamitos Race Course," Debra said, 
"but all of her grooms have been women of small size." 
</P>
<P>
Becky Lammons is the latest and perhaps smallest of female grooms to provide 
tender care to the playful and inquisitive Doodlin. 
</P>
<P>
"Becky weighs about 110 pounds, but Boodlin responds to her." 
</P>
<P>
That may be just what the doctor ordered at a most appropriate time, for Debra 
and her husband, veterinarian Gary Budahn, already have paid Doodlin's 
nomination fee for this year's Breeders Crown races at Pompano Park in Florida, 
on Nov. 2. Doodlin raced in this classic last year, finishing sixth in her 
division. 
</P>
<P>
Debra believes increased competition among mares at the current Los Alamitos 
winter meeting has sharpened Doodlin's skills for such gigantic goals. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad to see more good mares on the track that have beat her," Debra said. 
"We no longer can say 'just another easy race.' If we won every week against 
the girls, which Doodlin always tries to do, we would have to race her against 
the boys, in the open division." 
</P>
<P>
With a tidy $330,000 in race winnings in Doodlin's bankroll, the Budhans often 
are asked if it isn't time to turn her into a broodmare. 
</P>
<P>
"We owe it to the sport to race her this year," Debra said. "If a person keeps 
taking out good horses to breed them, what does that do for the fans? Certain 
horses become their favorites, and they like to see them race." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the Budahns may have had doubts about ever seeing Doodlin race. 
Their hobby of raising and developing harness horses had gotten out of hand, so 
they decided to reduce their stock. That included oversized Doodlin when she 
was a yearling. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife and I just wanted a hobby," Gary recalled, "but, before we knew it, 
our Gusty Stable had too many horses, so we decided to sell some of them." 
</P>
<P>
However, nobody made a bid for Doodlin, so the Budahns' feed bill was stuck on 
high. Then, she failed her schooling to become a trotter (her sire Rowdy Yankee 
raced both on the pace and on the trot). 
</P>
<P>
"She trotted," Debra said, "but she always seemed to do it in one spot." 
</P>
<P>
Pacing was the next step, and Doodlin took to it like she does sugar cubes. 
</P>
<P>
"Her athletic prowess was born," Debra said. 
</P>
<P>
Debra, 37, said Doodlin is "just like an Olympic athlete." 
</P>
<P>
"She has tremendous desire," she said. "She likes to compete. She listens to 
the track announcer when she's in her stall at night. Her ears go back and 
forth. She seems to be happier at the track rather than being turned out for a 
long time. She likes the routine of training and getting ready for a race." 
</P>
<P>
Financially, Doodlin and her dam, Latin Start, have been generous to he 
Budahns, whose hobby blossomed into a good business. 
</P>
<P>
"We paid $25,00 for Latin Star," Budahn, 39, said. "She earned $60,000 on the 
track, so she paid for herself." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, she also birth to Doodlin, who has been horse of the meet at almost 
every track she has raced at -- and was voted California's best 3-year-old 
filly. 
</P>
<P>
"The stud fee for her sire, Rowdy Yankee, was $2,000," Budahn said. "I'd say we 
invested $12,000 in Doodlin before she started racing. 
</P>
<P>
"You can definitely say she's paid for herself. Two standardbred farms back 
east, Castleton Farms in Kentucky, and Hanover Shoe FArm in Pennsylvania have 
asked about getting her as a brood mare." 
</P>
<P>
The Budahns, who live in Rolling Hills with daughters Jenifer, 9, Amy, 4, and 
son Michael, 3, have been married 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
Debra and Gary were high school sweethearts in Norwood, Minn., where Gary 
played football and drove harness horses on the Mid-Western fair circuit. 
</P>
<P>
They also attended Gustavus Adolphus College, where the girls were called 
"Gusties." 
</P>
<P>
"That's how we got our name for the Gusty Stable," Gary said. "Few people 
outside Minnesota are familiar with Gustavus Adolphus College; maybe Doodlin's 
success will put it on the map."

VUJIC GOES THE DISTANCE AS CSUN CLAIMS MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Having set school freshman records in the 5,000 and the 10,000 meters for Cal 
State Northridge last year, Sasha Vujic is stalking bigger game this season. 
</P>
<P>
Ranked sixth, 11th and eighth on the all-time Northridge lists in the 1,500, 
the 5,000 and the 10,000, respectively, Vujic has set his sights on Mike 
Flint's 5,000 record of 14 minutes 11.54 seconds, set in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
In pursuit of that quarry, Vujic concentrated on the 1,500 early this season to 
sharpen his speed. But in Saturday's quadrangular track and field meet at 
Northridge, he worked on his speed and his strength, winning the 1,500 and the 
5,000, and placing second in the 800. 
</P>
<P>
Powered by Vujic's 13 points (the meet was scored on a 5-3-2-1 basis), the 
Matadors won the men's competition with 72 points, followed by NCAA Division I 
teams San Diego State (51), Long Beach State (50) and Weber State (31). 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State, led by multi-talented Gaylen Ames, totaled 94 1/2 points to 
win the five-team women's meet. Northridge placed second with 59 1/2 points, 
followed by Weber State (57 1/2), Long Beach State (43 1/2) and Mankato State 
of Minnesota (11 1/2). 
</P>
<P>
"I planned to run the 800 and 1,500," said Vujic, who placed eighth in last 
year's NCAA Division II cross-country championships. "I wasn't sure about the 
5,000, but (Coach Don Strametz) came up to me before the race and said, 'We 
need the points.' " 
</P>
<P>
Vujic, who has a personal best of 14:30.14 in the 5,000, didn't disappoint 
Strametz, swooping past Brian Barton of Weber State with 50 meters left to win 
in 15:09.06. 
</P>
<P>
Vujic began the day with an impressive 3:53.98 victory in the 1,500, running 
the last 300 meters in 41.7 seconds. He followed that with a personal best of 
1:54.5 in the 800 to place second. 
</P>
<P>
But Vujic wasn't the only Matador to stand out Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Pippins and Kevin Hendrix went one-two in the 100 (10.52-10.55) and 
two-one in the 200 (21.61-21.59). 
</P>
<P>
Paul Albers, sixth in the hammer throw in last year's Division II 
championships, placed second in that event with a personal best of 186-10. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte Vines and Kim Young led the Northridge women, qualifying for the 
Division II meet in their respective events. 
</P>
<P>
Vines, a freshman from San Marcos High in Santa Barbara, won the 100 in 11.83, 
and Young placed second in the 100-meter low hurdles in 14.10. 
</P>
<P>
Lolita Pile, runner-up in the triple jump at last year's Division II meet, 
bounded a season-best 41-3 in that event, but lost to Ames, who went 41-5. Ames 
also won the long jump (19-5 1/4) and placed third in the 100 hurdles (14.52).

TOROS LOSING GAMES, COACHES' CONFIDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even when given the opportunity, Cal State Dominguez Hills baseball Coach 
George Wing and his top assistant, Eric Mihkelson, found it difficult to see 
encouragement Saturday afternoon. Not after the Toros had dropped the final two 
games of their five-game set with Chapman College. 
</P>
<P>
"At this stage, it all boils down to how deep it hurts and what to do if we are 
to turn this around," explained Wing, who appeared glum after a 9-8 loss Friday 
afternoon in Orange and a 9-1 shellacking in Carson Saturday at the hands of 
the Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
The Toros lost four straight in the five-game set to Chapman and fell to 5-8 in 
the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. (10-12-2 overall). Chapman moved to 
7-5 in the CCAA (16-12 overall). 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills, which tied sixth-ranked Cal State Long Beach 6-6 earlier in 
the week in a non-conference tilt, has won just one of its last eight contests 
and is rapidly backing into the critical 10-loss mark in CCAA play, a point in 
the 30-game schedule that Wing feels is a death knell for post-season 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like we still have a chance," said Wing, a second-year coach. "If we 
can just get through the doldrums . . . before it is too late." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the slump, Wing has reason to take heart. In the past three years the 
Toros were helplessly out of contention by now. In his first season, the Toros 
were seven games below .500 at this point. 
</P>
<P>
Injuries (some are beginning to call it the Dominguez diamond jinx) have once 
again played a part in Wing's fortunes. Four key players have been sidelined in 
the last eight days, including the team's hottest hitter, infielder Darrell 
Conner, who has a possible wrist fracture. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's game at Hart Park in Orange was a heartbreaker for the Toros. 
Dominguez Hills scored four runs in the top of the first, but Chapman countered 
with five in its half of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
The Panthers extended their lead to 7-4 after four innings, but Dominguez Hills 
whittled away until it took an 8-7 advantage in the top of the seventh. But in 
the bottom of the eighth inning, with two out, first baseman Doug Yates, who 
homered last week against Dominguez Hills to help Chapman pull out a victory in 
the late innings, hit a two-two fastball for a two-run home run. 
</P>
<P>
Toro Robert Campbell got a bloop triple with one out in the top of the ninth, 
but Campbell chose not to try to score on Johnny Blood's ground-out to 
shortstop, and then Marty Williams looked at a called third strike to end the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, left-handed pitcher Armando Gomez (4-2) surrendered 17 hits in 8 
2/3 innings of work. He has dropped two straight games. 
</P>
<P>
So as Wing and Mihkelson, the team's offensive signal-caller, stood near the 
third-base line after Saturday's game, Wing found praise hard to muster, even 
when pressed. After some head scratching, he said the team had character and he 
hopes it will shake the mid-season slump soon. 
</P>
<P>
"You see any bright spots, Eric?" Wing asked Mihkelson. 
</P>
<P>
"Depends on how these guys take this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Reality is, the Toros have to sweep every CCAA game they play from now on, said 
Wing, and that includes a three-game series with league-leading UC Riverside 
April 5-7.

THE HIGH SCHOOLS;

<P>
SMALL SCHOOLS PLAYERS EARN RESPECT BY PUTTING UP SOME LARGE NUMBERS

They compete in the Small Schools Division, the echelon of Southern Section 
athletics that invokes barbs from those who attend larger schools and receives 
little recognition from the local media. 
</P>
<P>
"It kind of bugs you after a while," said Darren Brown, junior shortstop for L. 
A. Lutheran, a four-year co-ed school in Mission Hills with an enrollment of 
95. "You feel like you're kind of secondhand." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Ramirez knows the feeling, too. Ramirez is a senior right-hander for 
Highland Hall, a four-year co-ed school in Northridge with an enrollment of 65. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't get a lot of respect sometimes," Ramirez said. "Especially when you 
look in the newspaper and you see some big write-ups about other schools and 
you get, maybe, three sentences on what went on. But it was a tough game." 
</P>
<P>
Inferiority complex? Not here. Neither player would trade his lot for even one 
at-bat at a public school of 2,500 students. 
</P>
<P>
For those not watching, Brown and Ramirez are in the midst of MVP seasons. On 
Friday, they were a combined eight for nine with eight runs batted in and five 
extra-base hits. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who had a streak of 10 consecutive hits snapped, hit for the cycle in 
the Lions' 18-3 Heritage League win over Coast Christian. An all-league 
quarterback in the fall, Brown also drove in five runs to raise his season 
total to 15. He is batting .650 with 10 extra-base hits. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez, last season's Westside League Most Valuable Player in both baseball 
and basketball, was four for four, including two triples, in the Hawks' 9-6 
nonleague win over Antelope Valley Christian. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez is batting .714 (20 for 28) with nine RBIs and three triples. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just hitting peas everywhere," co-Coach Dave Desmond said. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez also is 4-1 with a save, 39 strikeouts and a 1.80 earned-run average in 
31 innings. Last season, he was 14-4 with 148 strikeouts -- second only to 
Saugus' Roger Salkeld in the Valley area. 
</P>
<P>
So who cares if no one notices? 
</P>
<P>
"We take a lot of pride because we know there are a lot of good teams at this 
level," Ramirez said. "We know it's not Little League." 
</P>
<P>
Add Small Schools: Highland Hall (7-1), ranked second in the Small Schools 
Division behind defending champion Rosamond, will travel to Mesquite, Nev., on 
Thursday for the Cactus Classic at Virgin Valley High. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Highland Hall reached the semifinal round of the tournament, which 
included 36 teams. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks have won 24 consecutive league games, the sixth-longest streak in 
Southern Section history.

Lorraine and Kevin Foderaro have in common? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Sloppy fielding of late. Each player made an error Friday in the 
Indians' 4-3 Foothill League victory over Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Lorraine balked in a run in the ninth inning and walked another to put the 
tying run at first. Moreover, Hart stranded nine baserunners. 
</P>
<P>
Hart (6-1-2, 3-0 in league play), ranked third in The Times' Area Poll, 
survived the ninth when Lorraine picked Bryan Miclette off first base. Starter 
Kevin Foderaro (3-0) yielded two hits in four innings to earn the win. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't have felt any different about it if we had lost," Coach Bud Murray 
said. "I didn't say much to (the players). We usually run after a game. This is 
the first time we didn't run. I told the kids they didn't deserve to run." 
</P>
<P>
Attention, pitchers: While Garret Anderson and Lazaro Campos have had their 
troubles, Palmer Drain has been carrying Kennedy offensively with a .400 
average and 12 RBIs through nine games. 
</P>
<P>
Drain's theories on hitting, however, are hardly scientific. And if anybody 
cares to take notes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I just look for the fastball, but I don't know if we should print that," said 
Drain, who paused for a moment before adding: "I look for fastball, fastball, 
fastball. And if there's two strikes, I swing at anything close." 
</P>
<P>
Sea of hitters: Montclair Prep's 4-1 start has included impressive wins over 
Ventura and Taft -- large conquests for a tiny school in Southern Section 
Division 1-A. But what might be even more impressive is the balance of power 
the Mounties are showing. 
</P>
<P>
In one inning against Ventura, five Mounties (Geoff Taylor, Russell Ortiz, 
Jared Baumblatt, Brent Polacheck, and J. T. Billingslea) hit home runs. Through 
five games Polacheck was batting .625, followed by Andy Shaw (.533), Leland 
Sparks (.444), Baumblatt (.368) and Billingslea (.312). 
</P>
<P>
And to think all-state shortstop Keyaan Cook, the team's hottest pro and 
Division I prospect, is fifth in RBIs with just three. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't worry about Keyaan," Coach Walt Steele said. "He'll be there." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure. At last check, Cook was hitting .562. 
</P>
<P>
Here's to the winners: North Hollywood's baseball team, which finished 3-16 
last season, has had little to cheer about recently. Which is why the Huskies 
can be excused for an on-field celebration last week after they upset East 
Valley League power Sylmar, 4-3, on Nelson Pichardo's bases-loaded single in 
the bottom of the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd have thought we won the World Series," Coach Marty Biegel said. 
</P>
<P>
The players poured out of the dugout to greet Sammy Ciaramilaro, who scored the 
winning run, then headed for first base to tackle Pichardo. 
</P>
<P>
Biegel, though, who had already run out to greet Pichardo, was swallowed up in 
the players' exuberance. 
</P>
<P>
"Next thing I know, they're all on top of me," Biegel said. "I got spiked in 
the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
Biegel, who may be young in spirit, is 68. One would think, then, that the boys 
would be running laps for hurting their elder. 
</P>
<P>
"Aw, it's OK," he said. "It was a great moment for these young men." 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood is 3-2 in Valley Pac-8 Conference play after sweeping Reseda 
last week, 6-4 and 19-6.

<P>
While the rest of the world celebrated the first day of spring Tuesday, 
residents of this New England town, known as the "Rotten Sneaker Capital of the 
World," took refuge under a blanket of snow. 
</P>
<P>
Foul weather, however, failed to dispel the noxious fumes rising from the 
Montpelier Department of Recreation gym as the 15th annual Odor-Eaters 
International Rotten Sneaker Contest drew to its repellent close. 
</P>
<P>
Snatching victory from "de-feet," 14-year-old Matt Greenhaigh of East 
Greenwich, R.I., was declared the world champion in the smell-offs, winning out 
over contenders from across the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Matt, who was the Atlantic States Regional winner, competed against seven other 
finalists -- Melissa Bergdorf, 13 of Uniontown, Ohio; Nicholas Gray, 10 of 
Denison, Tex.; Jason Koch, 14 of Salisbury, Mass.; Brian LaRue, 14 of White 
Sands, N.M.; Alexandy Gregory, 14 of San German, Puerto Rico; Russell McDonald, 
14 of Aurora, Canada, Micum MacIntyre, 10 of Montpelier. 
</P>
<P>
"Matt won by a nose -- my nose," proclaimed Dr. Herbert Lapidus, chief 
odorologist, head judge and inventor of Odor-Eaters insoles. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with gas masks and 10-foot poles, Dr. Lapidus, who is known as the 
"Einstein of Odor," headed a panel of judges including Ann Cummings, the newly 
elected Mayor of Montpelier, whose first offical act of office this was; disc 
jockey Tim Janawicz, Montpelier High School girls basketball coach Roger 
Crowley; Rebecca Reed, a respected mother of two, and Ben, a golden retriever. 
</P>
<P>
Matt's sneakers qualified as "best of the worst" in nearly all categories, 
including humongous holes, lost soles, tattered tongues, grisly grommets and a 
truly disgusting odor, discernible from 20 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he achieved such lows of decrepitude in a relatively short period of 
time, Matt, who hopes to own a chain of skateboard stores, shrugged and said, 
"It's mostly skateboarding, but it also helps to ride a bike and use your feet 
instead of brakes." Going to camp was another big boost, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen wear-and-tear," said Matt's mother, Ellie, a music teacher, who 
lives with her four children and her husband, David, headmaster of the West Bay 
Christian Academy elementary school. "But I've never seen anything to equal the 
condition of these shoes -- nor the battles over keeping them." 
</P>
<P>
For her bravery, Mrs. Greenhaigh was awarded the Odor-Eaters Purple Sole of 
Valor, a distinction presented only to the mother of the international winner. 
"I don't know what it is about adolescent feet," said Dr. Lapidus, pinning the 
medal to Mrs. Greenhaigh's coat, "but I sympathize with every mother in America 
who's ever tried to separate sneaker and child." 
</P>
<P>
The contest does achieve sneaker-child separation, at least among the winners. 
All the finalists' sneakers -- eight pairs -- were enshrined in the Odor-Eaters 
Hall of Fumes, a triple thick, air-right display case designed to immortalize 
the rankest of the rank. 
</P>
<P>
The grand prize winner received a $500 US savings bond and a sneakers survival 
kit designed to prevent subsequent contest entries. The kit contains a brand 
new pair of Van's sneakers for every month in the year, and a year's supply of 
Sneaker Tamers, Odor-Eaters' more athletic cousin.

single -- and teammate Phronsie Franco hit a solo home run to lift Thousand 
Oaks to a 1-0 softball victory Saturday in a Tournament of Champions 
championship semifinal game at Peralta Park in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
A right-handed senior, Zinner struck out 10 and scattered five hits earlier in 
the day, pacing the Lancers (8-3) to a 4-3 victory over Los Alamitos. Franco 
also homered in that game. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks' Amy Chellevold had four hits and two RBIs for the day.

Simona Errico led off the fifth inning of the second game with a single and 
scored on Darcy Anderson's single to give visiting Notre Dame a 4-0 lead. Hart 
rallied for three runs in the bottom of the inning, but Notre Dame starter 
Becca Berline (4-3) held on to earn the victory after losing the first game, 
despite striking out eight.

POWAY'S FORTNEY HELPS COUNTY HOLD OFF CITY 
</P>

<P>
Poway's Christy Fortney didn't want to lose her perspective. She simply 
preferred not to lose. 
</P>
<P>
Fortney, playing for the County All-Star girls' basketball team Saturday night 
at Serra High, had a chance to do something she hadn't done in the regular 
season: go out a winner. 
</P>
<P>
Against the slightly favored City All-Stars, Fortney's wish was granted. The 
County let a 14-point fourth-quarter lead vanish but held on to win, 67-65. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a big deal to me," said Fortney, whose team lost to Division I 
section champion Mt. Carmel the last two out of five times they met. "To me, 
our season ended on a sour note, and I knew I'd feel a lot better having it end 
this way. It's a lot more positive note for me." 
</P>
<P>
Fortney led the County in scoring with 13 points and had seven rebounds. Point 
Loma's Tyeast Brown (20 points) and Ericka Crittenden (13) led the City. Brown 
and Oceanside's Mildred Conston each had 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The County's third-quarter scoring spree proved to be the City's eventual 
undoing. After a first half of see-saw scoring -- the County won the first 
quarter, 18-9, the City the second, 21-9 -- the County came out, dismantled the 
City's defense and energized its own offense. 
</P>
<P>
"We slipped in the second quarter, and we talked about that at halftime," said 
County Coach Jay Trousdale of Poway. "We didn't play our best, and we worked on 
getting our fast break going." 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 30-27, at the half, the County then went at such a pace that the City 
didn't know quite what had hit it. It was 50-37 at the end of three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
"Early in the third quarter, we came out very strong and more fired up," 
Fortney said. 
</P>
<P>
The City began its comeback in the fourth, paced by Brown (two field goals) and 
Crittenden (five of eight from the foul line and a bank shot). But Crittenden 
was benched with four fouls midway through the period, then returned and fouled 
out with 5:44 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
With 19 seconds left, the City's Stacy Kasimatis (Mira Mesa) scored from the 
inside to make it 67-64. Tammy Tavares (Our Lady of Peace) then grabbed it away 
from the County and tried to tie it with a three-pointer with eight seconds 
left, but her attempt as she was fouled fell short, and her one successful free 
throw closed the scoring.

FOR SEVENTH GAME IN ROW, SOCKERS FAIL TO SOLVE WICHITA MYSTERY

<P>
Seven in a row. The beat goes on fueled by something nobody can put their 
finger on. 
</P>
<P>
The Wichita Wings won their seventh game in a row Saturday night over the San 
Diego Sockers, a team that at one time dominated them. 
</P>
<P>
The Wings left no doubt about it, hammering the five-time Major Indoor Soccer 
League champions, 9-5. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego was not only at full strength and healthy, but was also playing its 
best soccer of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Sockers Coach Ron Newman admitted he was shocked by the streak, especially 
because his team had won four in a row and, until Saturday night, their passing 
and finishing was "immaculate." 
</P>
<P>
No other team has ever beaten the Sockers more than five in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"Seven straight to anybody is a bit of a strange product," said Newman. "As 
long as we don't lose seven to them in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
The man of the hour was Keder, a former Socker who came to the Wings Jan. 20 in 
a trade with the Baltimore Blast. 
</P>
<P>
Keder scored a hat trick to run his scoring streak to nine goals in the last 
eight games. His last two goals were the ones that put the game out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
The Wings built a 4-2 lead but the Sockers got within a goal at 4-3 when 
Jacques Ladouceur's 35-foot shot hit the crossbar and bounced into the goal off 
Wings' defender Victor Moreland. 
</P>
<P>
Then the roof fell in. 
</P>
<P>
Wings defender Gregg Willin worked the ball into the penalty area and found 
Dale Ervine open at the right post. Ervine buried the shot to make it 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
Then with 44 seconds left in the first half, the Sockers' Waad Hirmez was 
sentenced to two minutes for elbowing and Keder scored a power play goal just 
seven seconds before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
"Every bounce went the wrong way for us," said Newman. "Gradually, you could 
see the lads' confidence starting to wane again. Any time Wichita had the ball 
we didn't seem to be able to do anything about it." 
</P>
<P>
Newman said he would have been happy to go into the halftime trailing 4-3. He 
figured there would still be time to get organized. 
</P>
<P>
"And at 6-3, I thought we could still do it, the way we play. And then they go 
and get this weird seventh goal." 
</P>
<P>
It was weird because Ervine, on a breakaway, sent a pass off the end boards 
that got around goalkeeper Victor Nogueira and Keder got a foot on the ball 
sliding in and it trickled across the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, Keder and Newman embraced. Keder scored 28 goals for Newman and 
the Sockers as a newcomer in 1987-88. Newman waived him early in 1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
"Ron Newman bring me here to America," said Keder. "It was good to show him 
that he should keep me, you know." 
</P>
<P>
Keder played his best all-around game of the season, not only scoring but also 
working hard on defense. 
</P>
<P>
Keder scored his second goal on a power play just seven seconds before halftime 
on a pass from Willin. 
</P>
<P>
Four minutes earlier, Willin worked the ball into the penalty area and found 
Ervine open near the right post. Ervine buried the shot. Ervine later scored a 
second goal on a 135-foot shot into an open net against a sixth attacker. That 
gave Ervine 38 goals for the season, second only to league scoring leader Tatu 
of the Dallas Sidekicks. 
</P>
<P>
Even after the Wings opened up leads of three and four goals, they kept high 
pressure on the Sockers. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to give them an inch," said Nicholl. "I wanted to make it as 
difficult as possible for San Diego to play against us, just as Baltimore did 
against us in our last game." 
</P>
<P>
Branko Segota got the Sockers on the scoreboard first, running onto a crossing 
pass from Cacho to tap in a shot from six feet between two Wings.

LUGINBILL'S THOUGHTS OF SDSU SPRING FOOTBALL ETERNALLY HOPEFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Spring football opens Monday at San Diego State, and that means Coach Al 
Luginbill is thinking spring thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
He says he's excited about getting started. He talks about the importance of 
making strides with the young athletes. He frets about the work that lies 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
The discussion eventually rolls around to probably the most important variable 
for the Aztecs this spring -- continuity. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Luginbill was new to the program, having replaced Denny Stolz. He 
had a handful of new assistants. They were practically learning players' names 
as they instructed them on the field. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, a system is in place. Familiarity, Luginbill hopes, will breed 
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no longer a struggle," he said last week. "The young men can just go out 
and take care of business. The staff understands the players, and the players 
understand the staff." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the growing pains, SDSU was 6-5-1 last season -- the first winning 
season for the Aztecs since 1986 -- and 4-3 in the Western Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
There has been just one coaching addition this season -- Steve Fairchild was 
named recruiting coordinator/quarterbacks coach, replacing Steve Devine, the 
former offensive line coach. Dave Lay, the offensive coordinator who previously 
dealt with quarterbacks, will take over responsibility for the line, and Dan 
Underwood will take over running backs and tight ends. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill said he will work the team hard over the 20 practices he is allowed 
by the NCAA -- 15 in which contact is allowed -- partly because the team still 
is not quite where he would like it to be and partly because it is relatively 
young. There are just 16 seniors on the roster. 
</P>
<P>
One of them is 6-foot-8 quarterback Dan McGwire. His 1989 statistics, while 
good, didn't match his stature. He threw for 3,651 yards, the second-highest 
season total in school history, but was inconsistent. 
</P>
<P>
"I've talked with Dan several times about where he is and where he needs to 
be," Luginbill said. "If he improves like most players going from their first 
to their second years, this offense will be an excellent group." 
</P>
<P>
McGwire will have several targets in wide receivers Jimmy Raye, a healthy 
Patrick Rowe (he missed last season with a knee injury), Dennis Arey and 
redshirt freshmen Merten Harris, Jake Nyberg and Will Tate. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe anybody in the western United States will have better speed 
than us out wide," Luginbill said. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs have four or five running backs jockeying for position this spring, 
and Luginbill will be watching the offensive line closely, attempting to fill 
both tackle and guard slots. 
</P>
<P>
But what he will be working hardest on is the defense. The Aztecs averaged 30.7 
points a game last season but allowed 31. The biggest culprits were, in order, 
the linebackers and secondary. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, two of the four community college transfers Luginbill brought in 
are linebackers, and one is a cornerback. The linebackers, Andy Coviello 
(Sacramento Community College) and Lou Foster (De Anza College in San Jose) are 
enrolled at SDSU and will participate in spring drills. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU will practice on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays and scrimmage on 
Fridays. There will be no contact during the Monday drills, and Friday's 
scrimmages, according to Luginbill, will be 120 plays or longer. 
</P>
<P>
The team will be off April 9-13 for spring break, and the annual Red-Black game 
will conclude drills on May 5 in the Aztec Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes 
</P>
<P>
Two players are injured and will miss spring practice: senior center Nick Subis 
(broken foot) and freshman defensive lineman Greg Porter (dislocated shoulder). 
Junior offensive lineman Kevin Macon (dislocated toe) is questionable.

REAL ESTATE VERSUS STOCKS: WHICH IS BETTER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The following hypothetical examples demonstrate how investing in real estate 
often beats investment in stocks. The superior profit performance in real 
estate can largely be accounted for by tax benefits and leverage (the ability 
to buy with borrowed funds). Property owners get tax deductions for mortgage 
interest payments and can buy real estate for as little as 5% down. The 
leverage is particularly important because buyers get the benefit of 
appreciation on the entire value of the home, even though their cash investment 
is merely a fraction of the value. 
</P>
<P>
These simplified examples do not account for cash flow, which would include the 
impact of monthly expenses for rent or mortgage payments. 
</P>
<P>
Net cost figures include real estate commissions, brokerage fees and taxes on 
stock dividends (assumed to be 3 percentage points of the total return). Income 
and capital gains taxes have not been deducted from net profit figures. 
However, it is important to note that usually profits on the sale of a 
residence can be deferred by rolling the gain into another residence, but gains 
on stock transactions are not as easy to shelter from tax. 
</P>
<P>
Rates of return on stock investments are based on the 20-year average annual 
performance of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones 
industrial index, with dividends reinvested. Real estate rate of return figures 
are based on 20-year average annual returns as reported by the National Assn. 
of Realtors, as well as estimates by real estate experts. 
</P>
<P>
Tax brackets are for combined federal and state taxes. 
</P>
<P>
1. SINGLE MAN BUYING A CONDO 
</P>
<P>
Annual earnings: $45,000 
</P>
<P>
Rent: $700 a month 
</P>
<P>
Tax bracket: 34.7% 
</P>
<P>
Mike Chen decides to buy a $130,000 condominium with 10% down, or $13,000 
invested. He gets a loan for the $117,000 balance, for which he must pay a fee 
of 2 points (a point equals 1% of the loan amount) on a 10.5% fixed-rate loan. 
The condo appreciates at a 5% annual rate. He sells in five years, paying a 
standard 6% real estate commission. 
</P>
<P>
Net Cost: $139,955 
</P>
<P>
Sales Price: $165,917 
</P>
<P>
Taxable Profit: $25,962 
</P>
<P>
OR ... Chen uses the $13,000 investment to buy stock instead of real estate. 
His stock appreciates at an average annual rate of 11.5%, which reflects the 
impact of reinvested dividends. He sells in five years and pays standard 
discount brokerage commissions both when buying and selling. 
</P>
<P>
Net cost (commissions plus reinvested dividends): $16,291 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Annual earnings: $150,000 
</P>
<P>
Rent: $0

Tax bracket: 39.2% 
</P>
<P>
Jane and Jim Hernandez, who already own a home, buy a $500,000 apartment 
complex with 15%, or $75,000, down. The $425,000 balance is financed with an 
11% loan plus a 1.5-point loan fee. During the first year, rental income 
amounts to $40,000 and appreciates at a 5% annual rate. The complex appreciates 
10% annually. They sell in five years, paying a 6% real estate commission, or 
$48,315.

<P>
Taxable profit: $341,411 
</P>
<P>
OR ... The Hernandezes buy a $75,000 portfolio of stocks that appreciates at 
11.5% annually. They sell the stock in five years and pay $375 in discount 
brokerage fees both when buying and selling. 
</P>
<P>
Net cost (commissions plus reinvested dividends): $93,785 
</P>
<P>
Sales price: $128,877 
</P>
<P>
Taxable profit: $35,092 
</P>
<P>
3. MARRIED COUPLE BUYING A HOME 
</P>
<P>
Annual earnings: $100,000 
</P>
<P>
Rent: $975 a month 
</P>
<P>
Tax bracket: 34.7%*

<P>
Tom and Karen Brown buy a $300,000 home in Santa Monica with 20%, or $60,000, 
down. They pay 1.5 points on a 10.25% fixed-rate mortgage. The house 
appreciates at an average rate of 11.5% per year. They sell in five years, 
paying 6% real estate commission. 
</P>
<P>
Net cost: $331,020 
</P>
<P>
Sales price: $517,006 
</P>
<P>
Taxable profit: $185,986 
</P>
<P>
OR ... The Browns invest the $60,000 in the stock market, earning an 11.5% 
annual rate of return, assuming annual dividends of 3% are reinvested. They 
sell the stock in five years, paying $200 in discount brokerage fees both when 
buying and selling. 
</P>
<P>
Net cost (commissions plus reinvested dividends): $74,928 
</P>
<P>
Sales price: $103,201 
</P>
<P>
Taxable profit: $28,273 
</P>
<P>
* The Browns' tax bracket is 34.7% when they buy real estate, but shoots up to 
39.2% when they invest in stocks because of fewer deductions. 
</P>
<P>
What happens when leverage is the same? The effect of leverage -- the ability 
to used borrowed funds to buy an investment -- is pivotal in making real estate 
transactions lucrative. And generally the degree of leverage available for real 
estate transactions is not available for many other types of investments, 
including stocks or bonds. 
</P>
<P>
But what if investors were only able to borrow as much to buy land as they 
could to buy stock? 
</P>
<P>
Take the Browns as an example. 
</P>
<P>
They buy a $120,000 home with 50% down, pay 1.5 points on a 10.25% mortgage. 
The house appreciates at 11.5% per year. They sell in five years, paying a 6% 
real estate commission. Or . . . They buy $120,000 worth of stock, putting 50% 
down, and paying a total of $400 in discount brokerage fees. The stock also 
appreciates at 11.5% annually, including the effect of reinvested dividends 
that account for 3% of the total return. And they sell in five years. 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: STOCK 
</P>
<P>
Cost: $132,408: Cost: $149,656 
</P>
<P>
Sales price: 206,802: Sales price: 206,602 
</P>
<P>
Taxable profit: 74,394: Taxable profit: 56,946 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the difference? 
</P>
<P>
"Taxes," said Cindy Edwards, a tax specialist at the Los Angeles accounting 
firm of Parks, Palmer, Turner &amp; Yemenidjian. The cost of the stock 
transaction is boosted by tax liability on those dividends that were put back 
into the market. Although the investor many never have gotten his hands on 
them, Uncle Sam takes a cut because dividends don't get the tax-deferred 
treatment that real estate enjoys. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the couple who bought real estate will find themselves with better 
cash flow because they lose the burden of paying rent. Because of the 50% down 
payment, their mortgage -- including interest, points and property taxes -- 
costs less than their estimated rent. They also deduct mortgage interest 
payments, which allows them to drop into the 34.7% tax bracket from the 39.2% 
bracket when they were buying stock.

TOBACCO INDUSTRY WINNING MANY BATTLES; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: DESPITE SOME VICTORIES BY ANTI-SMOKING FORCES, THE POWERFUL LOBBY IS 
ABLE TO FEND OFF MOST OPPOSITION LEGISLATION. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's increasingly fashionable to knock the tobacco industry, but the salvos 
from public officials and consumers have yet to seriously threaten its 
political health. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides in the battle over cigarette smoking agree the tobacco lobby is 
losing few fights on Capitol Hill and winning significant victories at the 
state level. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't feel sorry for them yet," said Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.), 
chairman of a House health subcommittee. "They still have a formidable amount 
of power in the Congress and influence around this country. They still have 
economic clout." 
</P>
<P>
One of the most powerful industry trade groups is the Tobacco Institute, 
representing the nation's cigarette makers. The institute has nine field 
offices with three employees each, plus lobbyists in all the state capitals and 
some key cities. Its political action committee raises about $200,000 for 
federal candidates during each two-year election cycle, and it has Political 
Action Committees in many states. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side are anti-smoking groups, growing in both size and 
sophistication, making their case with lots of passion and not much money. 
</P>
<P>
The two major national groups are the grass-roots Americans for Nonsmokers' 
Rights and the Coalition on Smoking OR Health, which represents the American 
heart, lung and cancer associations and other voluntary health groups. 
</P>
<P>
Reinforcing their efforts is Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. 
Sullivan, who does not miss a chance to slam the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
He has attacked campaigns to market new cigarette brands to inner-city blacks 
and undereducated young women, and reported that smoking costs the country $52 
billion a year in bad health and lost productivity. He's also asked advertising 
agencies to reject tobacco accounts, TV stations to warn viewers against 
smoking and athletic associations to reject "blood money" from tobacco 
companies seeking to sponsor sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
And that's just this year. 
</P>
<P>
The tobacco lobby lost a big one when Congress passed the smoking ban that took 
effect last month on nearly all domestic airline flights. Its only comparable 
defeat came in 1983, when the federal excise tax on cigarettes was doubled to 
16 cents. 
</P>
<P>
After the airline ban took effect, some congressmen said they would turn their 
attention to railroads. Last week, Amtrak announced that it would eliminate 
smoking on some trains and in some stations effective April 1. 
</P>
<P>
While keeping damages to a minimum in Congress, the industry often has 
prevailed on the state level. Its latest project is to win statewide preemption 
laws that impose some smoking restrictions but bar cities or counties from 
passing anything more severe. 
</P>
<P>
Such laws are a pivotal industry strategy as more and more localities enact 
smoking ordinances. One of the strictest took effect this year in Greensboro, 
N.C., a key tobacco state. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have 95,000 local units of government in this country and you have a 
finite amount of resources, then the smart thing to do is to try to limit the 
potential for mischief," said Walker Merryman, a spokesman for the Tobacco 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Pertschuk, director of the Berkeley-based Americans for Nonsmokers' 
Rights, said his group is getting its best results at the local level. That's 
where 90% of anti-smoking activity occurs, from protecting nonsmokers to 
banning vending machines and free samples, Pertschuk said. 
</P>
<P>
Preemption laws are thus "an extraordinary victory" for the tobacco industry, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
A preemption law recently passed in Virginia placing limitations on public 
smoking. What worries Pertschuk more is tobacco interests winning in states 
where their crop never has been king, such as Pennsylvania, Florida and 
Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
But if some state capitals still are in the grip of the tobacco lobby, 
Pertschuk and others believe the industry's hold on Capitol Hill is weakening. 
</P>
<P>
As evidence, they point to the airline smoking ban and a barrage of 
anti-tobacco proposals pending or soon to be introduced. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the plans would ban advertising, one would limit ads to text only, and 
another would give states the power to limit cigarette billboards. 
</P>
<P>
Others would raise the cigarette excise tax, eliminate tax breaks for business 
expenses associated with cigarette advertising, tighten federal regulation of 
toxic cigarette ingredients and create a public health agency for tobacco 
research and education. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents say they have momentum from the flight ban victory and expect to 
achieve at least some of their agenda this year.

IN PLUMMER PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SZYMANSKI, Szymanski is a free-lance writer based in West Hollywood. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A month ago, the old women sitting on the park benches would have been hassled 
for spare change. The children who played soccer would have had to maneuver 
around men who slept all day in muddy sleeping bags. 
</P>
<P>
But things have changed in Plummer Park. Today the women exchange news of the 
day unmolested. And now the soccer field is being used for what it was 
intended. The park is once again a haven for residents of the area with the 
recent passage of a strictly enforced "no camping" law, the eviction of a 
homeless feeding program and the closure of a nearby 24-hour hot dog stand. 
</P>
<P>
"This is simply a matter of the community taking back the park from vagrants," 
said Ed Riney of the East End Community Action group that lobbied the West 
Hollywood City Council for the changes. "It wasn't as dramatic as taking down 
the Berlin Wall, but for us it was reversing a really bad direction that our 
park was heading (in)." 
</P>
<P>
According to park director Laura Mehegan, the number of homeless people in the 
park has dropped from 2,070 in January to 280 last month. 
</P>
<P>
A sense of community has returned to the site. On a typical Saturday, neighbors 
haggle with a man selling fruit from his van, and not far away the Audubon 
Society sells bird-watching kits. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of serious-faced men, mostly Soviet immigrants, play rummy and dominoes 
at picnic tables, and familiar television actors pound tennis balls and wave to 
fans from the courts. Children lug cellos for the Pioneer Youth Orchestra 
rehearsal at one end of the park. At the other end, men in pastel sweat suits 
warm up for their "Stretchercise for Gay Men" class. 
</P>
<P>
A few of the homeless can still be seen, one sharing a bench with the Russian 
grandmothers wearing brightly covered scarfs. 
</P>
<P>
But it is once again the neighborhood's park, and many who use it are quick to 
say how much it has improved now that most of the homeless have left. 
</P>
<P>
"We love the park, we take it back, it was not pleasant before," said Charles 
Aniell, a 77-year-old Russian who takes English classes at the park. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is a fan of the changes or the motives for them. Rene Seidel, an 
activist with the West Hollywood Homeless Project, said the park was a safe, 
central place to serve meals to the homeless, and the lack of the site means 
"we can't find them to help them." Most of Plummer Park's homeless have moved 
to nearby Poinsettia and Wattles Garden parks in Hollywood. "It's a basic 
meanness and hysteria from the neighborhood," said Ted Landreth of the Greater 
West Hollywood Food Coalition, which was kicked out of the park after serving 
250 meals a day for nearly two years. "They didn't want to have to look these 
people in the eyes, so they just moved them out of sight." The nonprofit food 
coalition now serves meals a few blocks away at Sycamore Avenue and Romaine 
Street in Los Angeles, but fewer people are taking part, Landreth said. 
</P>
<P>
The homeless problem is still discussed in the park as much as the historic 
events going on in the homelands of its patrons. "They don't have somewhere to 
go and don't bother me," said Esther Mezhitrsky, in the park with her 
6-year-old granddaughter. "I come here to talk to my people about our 
homeland," said the woman, who fled Kiev, a Soviet city, in 1980. "God Bless 
America we have this park." 
</P>
<P>
Today the large community of mostly elderly Soviet immigrants who frequent the 
park, nicknamed "Little Gorky Park," is more evident than ever. "Sitting down 
in a park and taking a load off their feet were part of their culture in 
Russia, that's why they're here," said Senior Center director Vivian Sauer. 
</P>
<P>
The park also attracts Israelis, Mexicans and Iranians. "This park is more of a 
United Nations than any other park in Los Angeles," said Ruth Egger, the Senior 
Center's activity director. 
</P>
<P>
The 5.3-acre, 121-year-old park -- bordered by Santa Monica Boulevard, Fuller 
Avenue, Vista Street and Fountain Avenue -- is one of the county's busiest 
parks for its size with more than 16,000 people having used it in February, 
said Mehegan. It has eight buildings, tennis and basketball courts, a 
playground and a bird sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
To celebrate Plummer Park's rebirth, the West Hollywood City Council held its 
meeting in the middle of the park last week at a rededication ceremony of 
Fiesta Hall. The 40-year-old hall, recently renovated at a cost of $320,000, 
has featured performances by Jack Benny, Irving Berlin, Zubin Mehta and Ira 
Gershwin with guests including Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Crawford, Judy Garland 
and the Marx brothers. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell the children they are standing on hallowed ground here," said Ruth 
McLaughlin, director of the California Junior Symphony, which has held free 
performances at the park for more than 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, the park has been known as a gathering place for travelers since 
it was deeded to John and Cecelia Plummer in 1869. Large barbecue parties with 
well-known guests were held at the area known as the Pioneer Fiesta Center. 
Eugene Plummer lost the land and the county foreclosed on it but let him live 
at the park until his death in 1943. The Plummer House stood on the land from 
1878 until it burned in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Today parties continue at the site, with Russian celebrations, Easter egg hunts 
and jazz festivals planned by the park staff of nine. Classes include cake 
decorating, armchair exercises, ballroom dancing and Soviet drama classes. 
</P>
<P>
A tiny area set off by a black iron fence is a bird sanctuary kept up by the 
Los Angeles Audubon Society, which has a bookstore in the park. Owls, 
hummingbirds, hawks and falcons can be found there, the only danger being a few 
scavenging cats. 
</P>
<P>
"Not too long ago, I had to walk over homeless people sleeping in the courtyard 
to get to the front door," said Charles Harper, Audubon bookstore manager. "The 
homeless used to throw trash from the food program over the fence into the 
sanctuary for us to clean up." 
</P>
<P>
The tennis courts, built in the 1930s, attracted every major athlete and 
celebrity of the day, according to Oscar Ringel, who has lobbied for 30 years 
for park improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrities spotted on the courts have included Bill Cosby, Sidney Poitier, 
Donna Mills, George Peppard and Stacy Keach. Director Paul Mazursky plays there 
at least three times a week. It is said that people have left screenplays near 
his tennis bag hoping he would read them. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most talked-about park regulars is tennis player Richard Yarbrough, 
65, of Culver City, who lost both his legs to poor circulation. Zipping around 
the courts in his wheelchair, Yarbrough is a good match for many players at the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
He thinks the community's effort to reclaim the park was well worth it. "If you 
don't take care of what you've got, then it gets taken away from you," 
Yarbrough said. "I commend those who have taken back the park and cleaned it 
up. People are devoted to this park." 
</P>
<P>
Rod McCary, a character actor who started playing tennis at Plummer Park 20 
years ago, sees the park as a valuable part of the community where the ebb and 
flow of life can be viewed from a bench. "In this park you see a microcosm of 
what is going on in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a mesh of life here," McCary said. "I've watched people at the tennis 
courts grow old and join the codgers playing cards."

AT HOWLS FROM OTHER HOLLYWOOD, OURS DROPS ITS CLAIM ON THE NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The battle over the right to market the word Hollywood appears to have ended. 
</P>
<P>
Facing opposition from Hollywood, Fla., the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce has 
agreed to drop its bid with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to get 
exclusive use of the name on T-shirts, coffee mugs and other commercial items. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a settlement, Hollywood, Fla., officials, who have long opposed the 
California chamber's application, have agreed not to oppose any future 
exclusivity the chamber may seek for the name, as long as it is specific to 
Hollywood, Calif., or Hollywood, the movie capital. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise was announced last week by chamber officials here and city 
officials in Hollywood, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pleased, and I believe they are pleased, so I think you have to say it 
was a good negotiation," said Larry Kaplan, the chamber's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
In a unanimous vote, the five-member City Commission in Hollywood, Fla., 
approved the settlement last Wednesday, said Irving Rosenbaum, the city manager 
there. 
</P>
<P>
The chamber began trying to get trademark status for the name in 1986. 
Officials had hoped to use revenue from the sale of souvenirs to touch up some 
fading stars among the more than 1,800 in the Walk of Fame and to help finance 
other projects. 
</P>
<P>
But the idea met with a storm of protest in Hollywood, Fla., a city of 125,000 
halfway between Miami and Ft. Lauderdale. Hollywood bills itself as "Dream City 
Come True." 
</P>
<P>
City officials there filed notices of opposition with the trademark office, and 
the Florida city's Chamber of Commerce launched a public relations campaign 
ridiculing what it described as an "arrogant attempt" by Californians to claim 
the Hollywood name. 
</P>
<P>
A so-called "Hollywood Summit" organized by the Florida chamber attracted 
national attention last year. Representatives of 10 smaller Hollywoods from 
Maryland to New Mexico joined in, railing against "greedy Tinseltown" and the 
notion of the Hollywood, Calif., chamber wanting the Hollywood name all to 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
Merchants in Hollywood, Fla., argued that if the application for exclusive use 
of the name were approved, it could severely restrict their ability to market 
anything with the Hollywood name on it. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan called the compromise fair, saying it offered something for both sides. 
</P>
<P>
"It means that if we want to license a T-shirt with the word Hollywood over a 
movie camera, they aren't going to interfere with us," he said. "And if 
somebody there wants to sell a T-shirt with Hollywood over a coconut, we won't 
complain."

HOT PROPERTY: DUNAWAY AT HOME IN CITY FARMHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FAYE DUNAWAY, who is co-starring with Robert Duvall in the futuristic movie 
"The Handmaid's Tale," has purchased a home described as "a perfect, stone 
Connecticut farmhouse in a prime Beverly Hills Post Office Area location." 
</P>
<P>
Dunaway bought the house for about $2.5 million, according to public records, 
which also show a $1.5-million trust deed. 
</P>
<P>
"So she must've put down a cool million," said the title company 
representative. The property had been listed at $2,595,000. 
</P>
<P>
The home was built in 1937, but was recently remodeled, other industry sources 
said. It has three bedrooms and 2 1/2 baths in three stories. There is a steam 
shower in the master suite. 
</P>
<P>
The home also has a swimming pool and a two-story guest house, which Dunaway 
probably will use for her offices, said realtors not involved in the 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
The actress started her own production company, South Atlantic Film 
Enterprises, in 1987, when she moved back to her longtime Manhattan apartment 
from London after divorcing British photographer Terry O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
Movie mogul JACK L. WARNER'S home, the last great Beverly Hills estate to be 
owned by one family since Hollywood's Golden Age, is about to come on the 
market, and the competition is fierce among realtors to get the listing. 
</P>
<P>
"Four of us are doing everything we can to get it," a prominent Beverly Hills 
broker admitted. 
</P>
<P>
"Some brokers have been quietly showing it for some time at $45 million, but it 
might sell right away now," another local broker said. 
</P>
<P>
When listed, the 9-acre estate is expected to be one of the highest-priced 
private residences in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Since the 1920s, it had belonged to Jack Warner, co-founder of Warner Bros. 
studios, and his wife, Ann. She died March 8, reportedly at 82. He died in 1978 
at 86. 
</P>
<P>
The property has a two-story, Georgian-style mansion on it, reached through two 
sets of gates and a drive through a sycamore forest. There is a courtyard in 
front of the house with a large fountain and a 300-year-old sundial. 
</P>
<P>
There was a nine-hole golf course on the site. "But it was covered over after 
Jack died, so now, it's just a grassy knoll area," one of the brokers 
explained. "But the gardens are magnificent." 
</P>
<P>
KATHY SMITH, an NBC "Today Show" fitness correspondent who has had a couple of 
videos on the best-selling charts, and her husband, producer Steve Grace, have 
bought a home in Brentwood to accommodate their family's active lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
Their 60-year-old home, on just under an acre, already had a swimming pool and 
a tennis court when the Smiths bought it for $1.85 million, and they are adding 
a master suite and a gym, where their daughter, 16-month-old Kate, can also 
work out. 
</P>
<P>
The Smiths sold their former home in Westwood for $1.45 million. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few large, classic California bungalows to go on the market in the 
past decade has been listed at $3.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Known as the Duncan-Irwin House for two of its original owners, the 
Craftsman-style home in Pasadena was a redesign by CHARLES and HENRY GREENE. 
</P>
<P>
The original house was built in 1900. The Greenes redesigned it in 1906, 
combining architectural styles of the Swiss and the Japanese with a 
then-popular California design that used shingles. 
</P>
<P>
The present owner, Dr. Michael Citron, an internist, spent nearly 10 years 
restoring the five-bedroom, four-bath house, which has 5,974 square feet of 
interior space and more than 2,000 square feet of terraces, porches and 
balconies. 
</P>
<P>
Citron listed his home with Astrid Ellersieck of Jim Dickson Realtors in 
Altadena, because he wants to build a new Craftsman-style home in Washington 
state, Ellersieck said. 
</P>
<P>
MAX MONTOYA, the All-Pro offensive lineman with the Cincinnati Bengals who was 
signed a few weeks ago as a free agent by the Raiders, says he'll still buy a 
house in Los Angeles, despite the franchise's planned move. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, my wife is out there looking right now, but we've been living in the 
Cincinnati area so long -- eight years now -- that it's a shock to come home," 
said the former Southern Californian by phone from his home just outside 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
"We built our home here for less than $500,000, but it has an acre overlooking 
the Ohio River, and it's a 4,800-square-foot custom home. When you see what you 
can get for $500,000 in L.A., it hurts." 
</P>
<P>
Montoya, who grew up in La Puente, and his wife, who is from Rowland Heights, 
are looking for a new home in the $500,000 range in Covina, Brea or Anaheim 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom's helping us," he said. "She's a realtor with Red Carpet in Hacienda 
Heights." 
</P>
<P>
The SPRECKELS MANSION in San Francisco, owned by the Spreckels family since it 
was built in 1912, has gone on the market at $13.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The 27-room house, which occupies half a city block in the Pacific Heights 
area, was built for Adolph Spreckels, son of sugar king Claus Spreckels. Adolph 
Spreckels died in 1924. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the mansion has been occupied a few months of the year by 
Spreckels' daughter, DOROTHY MUNN, who also has homes in Palm Beach, Fla., and 
Paris, according to Rollin Pechha at Fox &amp; Carskadon/Better Homes &amp; 
Gardens in San Francisco, who has the listing. 
</P>
<P>
"She just decided the time had come to sell it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The French baroque-style home has 12 bedrooms and 12 1/2 baths in 15,000 square 
feet, with a view of the Golden Gate Bridge and the San Francisco Bay. There is 
an indoor pool in a separate structure, which also has a kitchen, changing 
room, lounge and five-car garage.

BUYING PROBATE PROPERTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARILYN TOWER OLIVER, Oliver is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Excitement was high on a recent Sunday morning as 50 people gathered for a 
probate auction at a Silver Lake condominium. 
</P>
<P>
In the corner of one bedroom, two men huddled on strategy. In the living room, 
a couple reviewed recent sale prices for other units in the building. Others 
milled on the balcony to admire a view stretching from downtown Los Angeles to 
the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
At 11 a.m. sharp, auctioneer Don Kennedy, of Kennedy-Wilson Inc., real estate 
auctioneers of Santa Monica, ordered everyone into the living room for the 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
The condo's owner had died recently, and the Los Angeles county administrator's 
office was handling the estate for relatives in a distant state. Kennedy-Wilson 
had been assigned to auction the unit. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy explained the terms of sale -- no contingencies, court confirmation and 
the required cashier's check for $5,000 and a personal check, to total 10% of 
the "bid-in" price. 
</P>
<P>
"The property is sold 'as is,' " Kennedy cautioned prospective buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Bidding started at $100,000. A few minutes later, after frantic cross-bidding 
between two interested parties, the property was sold for $157,000 to Frank J. 
De Santis Jr., who lives in his own home two blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
"I plan to rent the condo," he said. "(A bid of) $160,000 was my ceiling. I 
know that another unit in this building recently sold for $160,000, but it 
doesn't have the view this one does." 
</P>
<P>
De Santis' wife, Penny, arrived 15 minutes after the sale was over. The papers 
were signed, and the auctioneers were off to their next sale, a house in 
South-Central Los Angeles. The condo was locked up. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe it's all over," Penny De Santis said. "I didn't even get to 
see what it looked like inside." 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the world of probate real estate, a pitfall-laden process that can 
provide a way for the wary home buyer or investor to acquire real estate at 
below-market price from the estate of a deceased property owner. 
</P>
<P>
But you have to do your homework to come out ahead. If you don't research the 
neighborhood and set a limit on what you are willing to spend, you can end up 
paying more than the property is worth, probate real estate experts caution. 
</P>
<P>
In the worst scenario, a buyer who cannot come up with financing after 
successfully bidding in a property may lose all or part of the 10% down 
payment. 
</P>
<P>
But savvy probate purchasers can buy well below market price. 
</P>
<P>
Lanny and Terry Tron recently bought their northeast Pasadena dream house for 
about $40,000 below the original asking price at a court confirmation hearing 
in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been looking from North Hollywood to West Covina," said Terry Tron, a 
third-year law student at USC. 
</P>
<P>
"We really wanted to live in Pasadena but couldn't find a house we could 
afford. When our agent, George Keshishian of Century 21 Golden, called about 
this house, I thought it might be too old." At the realtor's urging, she looked 
at the 1925 house, and fell in love with it. 
</P>
<P>
The house has three bedrooms, a dining room, central air-conditioning, a new 
roof and it has been rewired. The front yard is enclosed with a white picket 
fence. The garden has fruit trees and rose bushes. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Tron first saw the house on a Thursday. An offer had already been 
accepted for the house and the court confirmation hearing was scheduled the 
following Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Lanny, a downtown Los Angeles attorney, looked at the house on 
Friday and was also delighted with it. The Trons knew they had to make a quick 
decision if they wanted to "overbid" the first offer at the confirmation 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
There wasn't enough time to schedule an inspection, so Saturday morning, a 
contractor friend, unable to come himself, sent his wife, who is knowledgeable 
about construction, to check out the property. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Trons rushed to the bank for a cashier's check to cover the deposit 
and what they hoped would be their first, and only, overbid. 
</P>
<P>
After a short hearing Monday morning, 3 1/2 days after they had first seen the 
house, it was theirs. Their overbid of $12,500 over the offer of $240,000 was 
the only one submitted and it was accepted by the court. 
</P>
<P>
"We're definitely the happy ending story," Lanny Tron said. "We got an 
immaculate house at a good price. The estate is happy too, because they 
instantly got $12,500 more than the first offer." 
</P>
<P>
Every year, thousands of pieces of real estate are sold through probate in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County alone, while confirmation hearing statistics are not kept 
by the court, it is estimated that in 1989, about 2,000 confirmations were 
heard in downtown Department 5 and the 11 outlying districts of the Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
Properties are sold during probate when the executor or administrator of the 
estate directs a sale to generate money to pay debts or cash to distribute to 
heirs. 
</P>
<P>
If there are no known heirs, no resident heirs or in cases where there is a 
will contest, the public administrator's office is appointed by the court to 
oversee the estate. 
</P>
<P>
Probate property -- houses, apartments, unimproved land, condos and commercial 
buildings -- is sold in different ways. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be listed with a broker," said Susan J. Cooley, a partner with the 
Encino law firm of Cappadona and Oldman, "who is required by law to expose it 
to the market through the multiple listing service, open houses and advertising 
in newspapers to generate the highest offer." Most probate property is sold in 
this manner. 
</P>
<P>
However, some probate property may be sold at public auction. This method is 
used for real estate handled by the public administrator and for other 
properties that need greater exposure to generate a higher price for the 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
In both cases, the successful bidder must generally go to court for 
confirmation of the sale. 
</P>
<P>
If the executor has independent powers of administration, which include power 
to sell the assets of the estate, the property may be sold without court 
confirmation if beneficiaries do not object. 
</P>
<P>
Most properties, however, are listed with a real estate broker selected by the 
administrator of the estate in consultation with his or her attorney. The 
asking price is determined after an appraisal by a probate referee. 
</P>
<P>
While showing the house, Cooley said, agents must inform prospective buyers 
that the house is being sold through probate and will be sold "as is." 
</P>
<P>
"The only exception to the 'as is' sale is if the executor knows that toxic 
pollution is present. This fact must be disclosed and the waste cleaned up 
prior to the sale," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"In probate you don't have the luxury of someone buying a regular house," says 
Laura Asher, an agent with John Geary &amp; Co. Ltd. East in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
"In a regular sale, if there's a major problem such as a bad roof or a 
foundation problem, you can get out of the sale or request that the seller fix 
it. In probate, once you've made a successful bid, that's it." 
</P>
<P>
When the agent gets an offer, it is presented to the estate accompanied by a 
10% down payment. If the offer is accepted, the attorney drafts a petition for 
confirmation of sale and files it with the court for a hearing date, usually 
about 30 days later. The amount of the offer and the hearing date are published 
in legal or general circulation newspapers and are posted in the county 
courthouse where the hearing will take place. 
</P>
<P>
In the weeks between acceptance of the offer and the hearing date, the broker 
must continue to show the property to anyone interested. 
</P>
<P>
At the confirmation hearing, other interested buyers can come in with overbids, 
which can be a drawback to probate buying. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen many people leave the court in tears when they've lost out in an 
overbidding situation," said Cooley, who bought her own house at probate two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Linda and Sam Pillsbury placed an accepted bid on a house in 
Glassell Park in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the house was ours," said Linda Pillsbury, publisher of "Child Care 
Los Angeles." "I was planning where the furniture would go. Then, when we got 
to court, we were overbid. We were not prepared to make a counteroffer, so we 
lost the house. 
</P>
<P>
"For a while we were devastated. There's a psychological drain in having your 
money tied up for a month. When we finally bought in Eagle Rock, we didn't buy 
at probate." 
</P>
<P>
But there's a happy winner for every disappointed loser in the overbid process. 
</P>
<P>
David and Jennie Smith-Moore bought their Atwater house at a confirmation 
hearing in the Glendale court, overbidding the original accepted offer. 
</P>
<P>
They had already been approved for a loan to buy another house in the Adams 
Hill district of Glendale. When that sale fell through, they decided to make a 
bid on the Atwater house, which they had seen earlier and liked. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Trons, they had to rush to the bank for a cashier's check for the 
deposit and overbid. They had earlier visited a confirmation hearing to 
familiarize themselves with the procedure. When they made their overbid, the 
first buyer backed out of the bidding, and the house was theirs. 
</P>
<P>
At the confirmation hearing the judge or commissioner asks the attorney 
representing the estate if there are any overbids. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally, before the hearing, the broker representing the overbidder will 
contact the attorney for the estate to ask what his client will need to bring 
to the hearing," said Christina M. Stone, a La Habra attorney who often takes 
cases to confirmation hearings in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm representing an estate and there's an overbid, I require 
documentation that the overbidder can swing the sale," she said. "This may be 
hard to do. It can be in the form of a financial statement or open letter of 
credit from a bank." 
</P>
<P>
The amount of the first overbid is determined by the California probate code. 
It equals 10% of the first $10,000, plus 5% of the balance of the accepted 
price. This amount is added to the original accepted offer. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the first overbid for the Tron's house was $252,500, or $12,500 
more than the original offer of $240,000. 
</P>
<P>
After the first overbid, the judge sets increments for subsequent bids. In this 
case, the second increment was set at $4,500 and subsequent increments at 
$3,000. But there were no further overbids, and the Trons got the house for 
$252,500. 
</P>
<P>
In probate sales in Los Angeles County the court awards a 5% commission, which 
is split by the listing and selling agents. In other counties, the brokers 
split a 6% commission. 
</P>
<P>
The agent representing the unsuccessful offer receives no commission, even 
though their client's offer was initially accepted prior to confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, said Frans Simson,) an agent with Fred Sands/Los Feliz, "many 
brokers don't want to show probate properties. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though you do a lot of work showing the property and bring the court an 
accepted offer, if an overbidder buys the property, you don't get a 
commission." 
</P>
<P>
In a probate sale, the interests of the buyer are not the major concern of the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
"Buyers at probate should be aware that the responsibility of the court is to 
see that the estate takes the highest and best bid," cautioned Ann E. Stodden, 
probate commissioner and supervising probate attorney for the Los Angeles 
County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, probate sales require all cash, and only occasionally will the court 
allow an estate to assume a first mortgage. If the purchaser fails to obtain 
financing, the property then must go back through the process to find a new 
buyer, possibly delaying closing the estate. 
</P>
<P>
"A person should know how much financing he or she can qualify for before going 
to court," Cooley advises. 
</P>
<P>
Because many probate houses are fixers, the buyer should know the approximate 
price for refurbishing and add this to the price he's willing to pay for the 
property, according to Bob Gilbert, a broker with Clor/Winkleman Realty in 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe you can get much for under market value at probate. The price 
of the property is reflected in the condition of the house," Gilbert said. 
"There may be a lot of repair work. If the buyer can do some of the work, he or 
she might get a good buy." 
</P>
<P>
Charles Flans of Charles Flans &amp; Associates, real estate auctioneers in 
Encino, concurs. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're handy and can fix the house yourself, you can get a good deal 
because many probate houses are in bad condition. You might not be able to get 
financing until you fix up the property. In that case, you'll have to have the 
cash up front. A buyer must do his or her homework in researching comparable 
prices in a neighborhood to come out ahead," Flans said. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of its drawbacks, successful purchasers believe that probate sales are 
an attractive way to acquire properties. 
</P>
<P>
"I think probate is an easy way to buy real estate," said Pat Walters, vice 
president of financial services domestic marketing for Columbia Pictures, who 
recently bought a Van Nuys townhouse with a partner as an investment. 
</P>
<P>
Walters and agent Laura Asher who represented both the estate and the 
purchasers attended court. It was their first probate sale. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all a little nervous," Walters says. "We were the third case to be 
confirmed. We saw a bidding war on the first two properties. We hadn't planned 
to overbid. When our property came up, there weren't any overbids. It was all 
over in about a minute." 
</P>
<P>
TIPS ON BUYING AT PROBATE 
</P>
<P>
* To find probate properties, look through the classified ads in local and 
metropolitan newspapers. Auctions held by Charles Flans &amp; Associates are 
advertised in the Los Angeles Times Business section on Sundays. Legal 
newspapers such as the Daily Commerce and Metropolitan News Enterprise in Los 
Angeles and the Orange County Reporter in Orange County carry notices of 
properties that are being sold at probate and hearing dates. 
</P>
<P>
* Dates for confirmation hearings are posted in local courthouses at least 15 
days prior to the actual hearing. 
</P>
<P>
* Ask to have your name placed on the probate list sent out by the Los Angeles 
County public administrator's office. Kennedy Wilson Auctioneers also keeps a 
mailing list. 
</P>
<P>
* When you find a property that interests you, inspect it thoroughly. You may 
want to hire a professional contractor or property inspector to go over the 
property to find major defects. Remember, these properties are sold "as is." 
</P>
<P>
* Determine how much it will cost you to repair and refurbish the property. 
</P>
<P>
* Research comparable prices in the neighborhood to determine how much you 
should offer. 
</P>
<P>
* Check with lenders to see how much they will loan you on the property prior 
to making an offer. 
</P>
<P>
* If you decide to submit an offer, select a reasonable amount to discourage 
overbidders at the confirmation hearing. "Come in with your best offer the 
first time," advises Joan O'Rourke of Fred Hawkins Realty in Arcadia. Be 
prepared to put 10% down. 
</P>
<P>
* Visit a confirmation hearing to become familiar with the process. 
</P>
<P>
* Take additional cash or funds in the form of a cashier's check to court in 
case you have to make overbids. 
</P>
<P>
* Decide whether you want to represent yourself or whether you will be 
represented by your agent. 
</P>
<P>
*If you are an overbidder on the property, bring a cashier's check to cover the 
first overbid and subsequent overbids set by the court. You may also want to 
bring a letter of credit from your bank to prove your credit if asked. 
</P>
<P>
* Realtor O'Rourke also tells her client not to fall in love with the property. 
Without emotional attachment, it is easier to drop out if the bidding goes too 
high.

TRIBUTE TO OUTSTANDING ARCHITECTURE;

<P>
AWARDS: LOS ANGELES BUSINESS COUNCIL'S BEAUTIFICATION AWARDS HONOR NEW,

A 60-year-old Wilshire Boulevard department store considered a prime example of 
the Zigzag Moderne architectural style of the 1920s will receive the 1990 
Landmark Award in the Los Angeles Business Council's beautification awards 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The Landmark award to the former Bullock's Wilshire building (recently renamed 
I. Magnin Wilshire), at the corner of Westmoreland Avenue and Wilshire 
Boulevard, honors buildings that have become a part of the historical 
conservancy of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The beautification program was begun 20 years ago by the business council. This 
year's presentation luncheon will be held on April 2 at the Hotel Bel-Air. 
</P>
<P>
Other awards pay tribute to developers, architects and contractors for 
outstanding achievements in new and remodeled residential and commercial 
development and landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
Project winners in four Perpetual Awards categories are First Interstate World 
Center, the Jeffrey Tamkin Award for outstanding new commercial high rise; 
Venice Renaissance, the Alan Casden Award for outstanding new multifamily 
residence; the Robert Bridges home, the Ray Watt Award for outstanding 
single-family residence, and Tillman Water Reclamation Plant, the Kaufman &amp; 
Broad Award for outstanding new public or civic project. 
</P>
<P>
A new award given this year for Outstanding Public Interior singles out the 
Home Savings of America Tower Sky Lobby in this category. 
</P>
<P>
"Our awards program had 70 submissions this year, which represents a 25% 
increase over last year," said Richard Magee of Richard Magee &amp; Associates, 
chairman of the council's urban beautification committee. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe this year's entries also reflected a higher percentage of quality 
projects, which may indicate that developers are becoming more aware of the 
need for quality design in a market that has become increasingly competitive." 
</P>
<P>
Judges were Dan Dworsky, president, Dworsky Associates Architects; Lawrence R. 
Moline, LRM Landscaping; Harshad Patel, president, Harshad Patel Design 
Consortium, and Michael Rachlin, Rachlin &amp; Rachlin Inc. Magee served as 
panel moderator.

REALTY BOARDS AND THE 'BEST' AGENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bruss' response to a letter writer who had asked the local Board of Realtors 
for the names of the "top three agents" and was denied the information 
demonstrated his lack of knowledge as to what a Board of Realtors is and does. 
</P>
<P>
First, the board could not give out that information, even if they had it -- 
which they do not! 
</P>
<P>
Example, our board has 861 members, with an additional 387 participants of the 
MLS only, working out of 125 different offices. If a staff person who answers 
the phone would even attempt to select three top producers -- it would be 
unethical and unfair to the rest of the membership. And besides, the only 
information they would have is perhaps the largest office -- and bigger is not 
always better! 
</P>
<P>
Second, individual agent production is not one of the statistics kept by the 
board. This information is only available from individual offices -- and is 
based on a variety of measures. 
</P>
<P>
Announcements of "salesman of the month" don't always symbolize the same thing. 
Some offices use sales figures. Some use closing figures only. Some use dollars 
of commissions earned. Comparing agents under those circumstances is 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
"Reading the ads" is not much better -- each realtor can probably claim to be 
Numero Uno at some time. "First in Sales . . ." this week? this month? this 
year? "Most listings in 1989 . . ." did they close? 
</P>
<P>
Best solution to the question is to call the three realtor offices closest to 
the property you are selling or buying. and be sure they are realtors, not just 
a "realty" office. 
</P>
<P>
Realtors subscribe to an even higher code of ethics than is required by law or 
the Department of Real Estate. They are likely to be more knowledgeable and 
more professional. A necessary criteria in today's world.

<P>
Robert Bruss Replies: 
</P>
<P>
Most local Boards of Realtors and Multiple Listing Services give annual awards 
such as for Circle of Excellence members, Million-Dollar Club members, Top 
Volume Salesperson, Top Volume Brokerage office, Realtor of the Year and other 
recognition for their outstanding members. 
</P>
<P>
Since all the members know who these winners are, why keep the names of these 
successful members a secret from property buyers and sellers who request this 
information? To avoid unfair favoritism, local boards can easily prepare a 
written list of their award-winning members and mail a copy to inquirers who 
request it. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, I talked with several executive directors of local Boards of Realtors 
who tell me they receive inquiries almost every day from prospective home 
buyers and sellers who request this information. Many boards gladly share these 
names with the public, whereas others refuse to do so, usually because the 
non-winning members protest. In my opinion, there is no valid reason for not 
telling inquirers the names of award-winning local realtors. This is the type 
of positive information realtors should be using to enhance their public image.

MOUNTAIN 'JEOPARDY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Talking about his recent purchase of more than 35 acres in the Hollywood Hills 
(Hot Property, March 18), "Jeopardy" host Alex Trebek is quoted by Times staff 
writer Ruth Ryon: "We'll have to cut off the top of the mountain to make a pad, 
but that's the kind of thing I enjoy doing." With that comment, Mr. Trebek has 
placed himself squarely in the camp of the environmental despoilers known as 
Mountain Croppers. 
</P>
<P>
Today, dozens of Mountain Croppers from large tract developers to Forest Lawn, 
and individuals such as Trebek, are ignoring sensitive development 
alternatives, and are busy at work cutting down mountains and ridges, and 
filling in the valleys of the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Collectively these Mountain Croppers may well be threatening the entire 
eco-chain throughout the Santa Monica Mountains, and the damage they are 
causing is irreversible. With time and money, new forests can be planted on 
deforested land, oil spills and toxic dumps can be cleaned up, stream habitats 
can be restored. You can't restore the mountains! 
</P>
<P>
The remaining native wildlife of the Santa Monica Mountains has been 
continually forced back into the deep canyons and highest mountain ridges. The 
massive grading employed by Mountain Croppers such as Trebek is obliterating 
even this habitat, and it is still an open question whether the birds and 
animals of the chaparral hillsides east of the San Diego Freeway will survive 
in their ever more restricted and fractured habitat, or face mass starvation 
and extinction. 
</P>
<P>
When the mountain is gone, and Mr. Trebek completes his "Monster" house he 
should lock himself up in it in shame.

PAPER WORK 'SCARE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article, "Paper Primer, A consumer's guide to the mountains of paper work . 
. . " (by Eileen Heyes, March 11) on selling (or buying) a home, was written as 
if by the Board of Realtors, and did your readers a disservice, especially 
those who elect to sell their own homes. It was couched in scare terms, 
exaggerating the facts. 
</P>
<P>
Many who believe real estate agents' sales tactics, list with them rather than 
sell them themselves because they're scared to death the process is way beyond 
them, and this is simply not true. 
</P>
<P>
Folks who can place a simple ad in the paper, keep the house clean and 
presentable, show it to seemingly sincere lookers only, and work with a local 
escrow company can sell their own property. The escrow handles the paper work.

FOUNDATION BOLTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This letter is a belated response to a question discussed in the Handyman 
Q&amp;A "Bolt Mudsills as Quake Precaution" (Jan. 21) on fastening of houses 
for earthquakes. I feel that I am somewhat of an expert in this field, being 
part-owner of a company that has been specializing almost exclusively in this 
area for the past seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Following are what I consider to be key points regarding retrofit fastening of 
wood-frame structures to their foundations: 
</P>
<P>
 -- You can never make a house worse by fastening it to its foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An engineer must be involved to determine what needs to be fastened and 
strengthened, location of strengthening elements, size of hardware, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The actual mechanics of installing bolts and other strengthening components 
is difficult and tedious work that often must be done in areas of very limited 
access. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The work can generally be performed almost entirely from underneath the 
house; some cases may require that part of the work be done from the outside, 
which then requires refinishing of areas of the exterior. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The work is extremely cost-effective (compared to potential reduction in 
damage to the structure). Moreover, many insurance companies and some lenders 
now require (or strongly urge) fastening of older homes.

YOUR MORTGAGE; 
</P>
<P>
SELL HOME BEFORE FORCED TO BY FORECLOSURE SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: We have a first, second and third mortgage on our home. Due to 
illness and unemployment, we are behind on our payments. The second lender has 
begun foreclosure and the others are threatening. A friend suggests that we 
file bankruptcy, but I hate to do that. We have about $25,000 equity in our 
house. What should we do? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Filing bankruptcy will delay foreclosure, but it won't solve your 
problem of inability to make the mortgage payments. 
</P>
<P>
If you file Chapter 13, you will have to come up with a payment plan and stick 
to it, because failure to make the payments means the automatic stay on 
foreclosure can be removed and the lender can foreclose. 
</P>
<P>
If you elect Chapter 7 straight bankruptcy the court will probably order your 
home sold (although you may be entitled to a homestead or other exemption 
protection for some of the sale proceeds after the mortgages are paid off). 
</P>
<P>
But a better alternative might be to sell your home to save most of your equity 
and avoid the stigma of bankruptcy on your credit report for 10 years. For 
further details, consult an attorney, but don't let yourself be pushed into 
filing bankruptcy unless absolutely necessary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mortgage Refinance Is Source of Tax-Free Cash 
</P>
<P>
Q: Our adjustable-rate mortgage is up to 11.25%. A local lender advertises 
fixed-rate mortgages around 10%. Do you think we should refinance? 
</P>
<P>
A: The general rule is it pays to refinance a mortgage if the interest rate can 
be reduced at least 2% and the loan costs can be repaid from monthly payment 
reductions within 36 months. 
</P>
<P>
Although you don't meet the criteria, you may want to refinance anyway to get 
rid of that undesirable ARM loan, so you can sleep better with a fixed-rate 
mortgage. If you have built up substantial equity in the house, another good 
reason you may want to refinance is to take out tax-free cash to use for 
investments.

<P>
TRUST DEEDS, MORTGAGES DIFFERENT; 
</P>
<P>
LOANS: THIRD PARTY INVOLVED IN TRUST DEEDS UNTIL PAID OFF, WHILE MORTGAGE IS 
BETWEEN THE LENDER AND BORROWER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Consumers and even lenders tend to use the terms mortgage and trust deed 
interchangeably. It's no wonder: Both instruments essentially create a lien on 
a home, and both allow the lender to foreclose if the borrower doesn't pay the 
money back. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, knowing the difference between a mortgage and a trust deed is helpful, 
especially if you'll be shopping for a loan during the spring home-buying 
season. 
</P>
<P>
A mortgage is the easiest of the two instruments to understand. It's a legal 
contract in which the borrower -- known as the mortgagor -- pledges the house 
as security against a loan to be paid back to the lender, known as the 
mortgagee. 
</P>
<P>
Title to the property is held by the borrower, but the lender is given a lien 
on the property as security for the loan. 
</P>
<P>
Although a mortgage was once the primary tool used to secure real estate loans, 
most lenders in California and other states now prefer to use deeds of trust. 
</P>
<P>
"A trust deed is much like a mortgage, except it involves three parties," said 
Gov Hutchinson, one of the California Assn. of Realtors' top lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
"First, there's the borrower, who's called the 'trustor.' Then there's the 
lender, who's called the 'beneficiary.' 
</P>
<P>
"And finally, there's a third party involved, called the 'trustee.' " 
</P>
<P>
The trustee holds equitable title to the property until the borrower pays off 
the loan. When that happens, title is transferred -- "reconveyed" -- to the 
borrower. 
</P>
<P>
Many years ago, the rules for foreclosing on a borrower who had a mortgage and 
a borrower who had a trust deed varied greatly. But now, said Jim Sage, general 
counsel of Great Western Bank, "most state governments have since changed their 
rules, and that has brought more uniformity to the foreclosure process." 
</P>
<P>
If a borrower defaults on the loan, the lender must usually first send him a 
"notice of default." 
</P>
<P>
Depending on state law, the borrower then has a specified period of time in 
which to make up the missed payments. In California and many other states, this 
so-called "redemption" period lasts for three months. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, California borrowers sometimes get more than three months because 
state law allows them to redeem their loan up to five business days prior to 
the foreclosure sale, Sage said. 
</P>
<P>
So, if the lender decided to set a sale date that's six months away, the 
borrower would have more than three months to redeem. 
</P>
<P>
If the redemption period passes and the borrower still hasn't brought the loan 
up to date, the lender can "accelerate" the loan. 
</P>
<P>
"This means that the entire loan is now due and payable, and the only way that 
the borrower can save the property is to pay the loan off completely and 
reimburse the lender for the expenses it incurred over the course of the 
foreclosure proceedings," Sage said. 
</P>
<P>
If worse comes to worst, the lender will sell the property at public auction. 
If the sale proceeds exceed the amount of the loan, any excess will be returned 
to the borrower -- assuming that there are no "junior" loans or liens on the 
property, such as a second mortgage or tax lien. 
</P>
<P>
Selling a house at public auction can be risky for lenders because -- in 
California and most other states -- a financial institution that orders a sale 
must usually give up the right to sue the borrower in court. If the sale 
doesn't generate enough cash to pay off the loan, the lender can take a big 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
It's important to remember, though, that only the "senior" lender on the 
property -- the one who holds the first mortgage -- must give up the right to 
sue. If there's a second or third mortgage on the property, the lenders who 
made those loans can still take the borrower to court in an effort to recover 
their losses. 
</P>
<P>
The California Assn. of Realtors recently released its 1989 Housing Finance 
Survey, and the 42-page report provides some interesting insights on how people 
finance transactions in the nation's most-expensive housing market. 
</P>
<P>
* While fixed-rate loans may be preferred by many consumers, most buyers in the 
state last year opted for adjustable-rate mortgages -- presumably because 
they're easier to obtain. But the popularity of ARMs slipped last year: 52% of 
all deals were financed with the loans, compared to 58% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
* Fixed-rate loans accounted for 42% of lending activity last year, up from 40% 
in 1988. The rest of the loans were primarily "compressed buy-down loans" that 
start with a below-market rate that's raised at specified intervals. 
</P>
<P>
* Although prices statewide jumped 18% last year, about 8% of buyers paid 
all-cash for their homes -- the highest level since the realtors started 
keeping records in 1981. The report says all-cash purchases have risen steadily 
since 1983, reflecting the growing amount of equity that has been built up by 
repeat buyers. 
</P>
<P>
* Half of all sellers last year netted more than $87,150 from their 
transactions; half netted less. 
</P>
<P>
* Condominium and townhouse sales accounted for 23.4% of all resale activity 
last year, up from 14.7% in 1988. About 54% of those condos and townhouses were 
purchased by first-time buyers. 
</P>
<P>
* Singles and "non-traditional households" -- two or more unmarried individuals 
-- accounted for 37.5% of all purchases last year, up from 31.6% in 1988. The 
report says high divorce rates, lower marriage rates and the rising cost of 
homes should keep the proportion of unmarried co-purchasers "at high levels" 
throughout the decade. 
</P>
<P>
The report had at least one finding that wasn't at all surprising: Fewer than 
one-third of all buyers last year earned less than $50,000, and nearly 
one-quarter earned more than $100,000. The median income of all buyers was 
$60,000, up 25% from the 1988 median of $48,000.

MORE MEN DRAWN TO REAL ESTATE SALES CAREERS; 
</P>
<P>
TRENDS: SURVEY SHOWS FIELD IS ATTRACTING MORE MALE AGENTS, COLLEGE GRADUATES, 
YOUNGER BROKERS AND AGENTS WITH LESS SELLING EXPERIENCE. 
</P>

California real estate selling is attracting more men, more college graduates 
and younger brokers and agents with less selling experience, according to a 
survey by the California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time since 1983, the percentage of male sales agents exceeded the 
number of females responding to the survey, increasing from 44.1% in 1987 and 
48% in 1988 to 52.5% in 1989. The majority of recent entrants -- 52.1% of 
salespersons and 70% of brokers -- were male. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 1/2-page survey was prepared by the CAR's research department and was 
mailed to a random sample of 4,500 members, according to the association's 
Lotus Lou. A total of 926 questionnaires, or 20.6%, were returned. "Pretty high 
for a survey of this size," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She added that the CAR has 140,000 members, about 40% of the 356,302 real 
estate licensees in California. 
</P>
<P>
More than one out of four -- 27% -- of the realtors responding to the survey 
were new to real estate sales, with a year of experience or less in 1989. This 
is a sharp increase from the 17.9% in the 1988 survey. 
</P>
<P>
The median ages of 48 for brokers and 41 for salespersons was unchanged from 
1988, but it is a statistically significant drop from the 1987 median ages of 
50 and 44 for brokers and salespersons, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, 63.6% of brokers had a four-year college degree or more education, up 
from 53.2% in 1988, and 54.4% in 1987, the survey showed. 
</P>
<P>
Young people right out of college are seeing real estate as a "viable and 
challenging career opportunity," according to Leslie Appleton-Young, CAR's 
director of research and economics. 
</P>
<P>
She said the increasing number of men entering real estate sales is also due to 
this perception of real estate as an alternative to other careers. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the sales slowdown from 1988, when 562,570 existing single-family 
houses were sold in California to last year, when 538,770 were sold, the 
state's housing market continues to attract young college graduates, according 
to CAR President Jim Antt Jr. of Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
"Newcomers to the state's real estate brokerage industry benefit from working 
in the nation's largest housing market, despite cooling sales following two 
years of superheated activity," Antt said. 
</P>
<P>
Gary R. Holme, president of the Los Angeles Board of Realtors, attributes the 
larger number of young, better educated brokers and salespersons to the 
shifting focus of real estate as a primary profession, rather than as a 
"secondary or fallback job for a housewife or an aerospace worker, for 
instance." 
</P>
<P>
Holme, executive vice president of the Beaumont Co., Los Angeles, said that 
when he earned his broker's license a quarter century ago, real estate was 
commonly viewed as a secondary occupation for both men and women. 
</P>
<P>
"The greater sophistication required today, along with the higher level of 
sophistication and education of buyers means that it's increasingly difficult 
for those with less education to succeed in real estate." 
</P>
<P>
All the survey data is from 1989, except for that on income, which is from 
1988, the last full year from which such data is available, Appleton-Young 
said.

IN THE GARDEN: GARDENING; 
</P>
<P>
PACIFIC COAST IRIS HIDES ITS BEAUTY UNTIL SPRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SMAUS, TIMES GARDEN EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the nicer, and most unappreciated, native California plants is the 
Pacific Coast iris. 
</P>
<P>
Quite unlike the stiff, bearded iris of gardens, the Pacific Coast iris looks 
more like a grass and can be hard to spot among native grasses, at least until 
it comes into flower. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Coast iris flowers in early spring, usually in March. The flowers 
are flat and open and easy to see in the garden and they can be so numerous as 
to nearly hide the plant beneath. They come on the end of slim, delicate stems 
and as one finishes up, it is replaced by another, so the show runs for about a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
The iris only bloom once a year, but the flowers are replaced by rusty-brown 
seed pods that are nearly as ornamental. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Coast iris (Iris douglasiana and several other species) have leaves 
that are narrow and arching, just over a foot tall, and a dark grass-green, 
though the tips are often colored brown, a natural phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
It forms spreading clumps that can grow 3 to 4 feet across in a few years, 
though the center of the clump becomes open as the plants' spread. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Chatto, a renowned English gardener and author, describes them in her new 
book "Plant Portraits" (David R. Godine, Boston; $25): 
</P>
<P>
"In the garden, they make low tussocky clumps of evergreen leaves which 
themselves provide useful ground cover along the edge of a border. In May (in 
chilly England), long, slender flower stems appear from among the rose-tinted 
leaf bases, carrying flights of flowers like butterflies. Long, furled and 
pointed buds open silk-textured petals, frilled and ruffled in every pastel 
shade imaginable. 
</P>
<P>
"Not until autumn do you pay much attention to their dark arching foliage. Then 
suddenly among the leaves you notice seed pods splitting open to form a shape 
as attractive as flowers, crinkled brown outside, pale cream within. On dried 
and curving stems they make something special for winter arrangements." 
</P>
<P>
As prophets are without honor in their own land, so seems to be the case with 
native plants. California natives, in particular, are unappreciated here, 
although English and European (as well as Australian and New Zealand) gardeners 
adore them. 
</P>
<P>
No California gardener would wax as enthusiastic as Chatto over our native 
iris; most don't know we have a native iris. But they should, for Pacific Coast 
iris are special and they can be easy to grow in the garden, taking water with 
the rest of the garden, or doing without. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Coast iris are not as drought-resistant -- or as fussy -- as a 
ceanothus or coyote brush, and need supplemental water between winter rains and 
a tad in spring and summer, but compared to other garden plants they are not at 
all thirsty. 
</P>
<P>
They could be the beginnings of a garden that needs less water, because they 
are easy to tuck into little spots here and there. 
</P>
<P>
In my own garden, I found a spot for them beside a quiet container of water 
where water lilies bloom in summer. And I have them beside the back steps where 
their grassy foliage helps hide that awkward transition between house and 
garden. 
</P>
<P>
My favorite is a cream-colored hybrid named 'Chimes,' developed by McCaskill 
Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the available Pacific Coast iris, including 'Chimes,' are hybrids of 
several different native species, and the colors run the gamut from truly 
lovely blues, through lavender, into soft yellow and gold, and even a shade of 
brown that takes a little getting used to. 
</P>
<P>
There are no true pinks though that shade can be found on some of the lavender 
or lilac-colored flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Being unappreciated by most, they are unavailable at most nurseries, and 
specialists must be sought out. McCaskill gardens is one, at 25 S. Michillinda 
Ave. in Pasadena, near the Los Angeles County Arboretum. 
</P>
<P>
They are having a special sale of about 300 native iris and will be open today 
through next Sunday, from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. every day. Otherwise they are only 
open Saturdays, from 9 to 11:30 a.m. and then from 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Other sources include the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden plant shop, 1212 Mission 
Canyon Road, Santa Barbara, (805) 682-4726; the Theodore Payne Foundation 
nursery, 10459 Tuxford St., Sun Valley (in the San Fernando Valley), (818) 
768-1802; Tree of Life Nursery, which only sells retail on Fridays, from 9 a.m. 
to 4 p.m., 33201 Ortega Highway, San Juan Capistrano, (714) 728-0685. 
</P>
<P>
Because the flowers can be so distinctly colored, it is best to buy these 
plants in bloom, though fall is the better time to plant. You can plant now and 
carefully water through spring, summer and fall, or keep the plants in their 
containers until fall and then plant. 
</P>
<P>
When shopping, look for strong, vigorous plants because some of the hybrids are 
much tougher than other. A few are downright difficult to keep alive. 
</P>
<P>
Most authorities say these plants need a rich, woodsy soil, so in a level 
garden with a heavy clay soil, you may want to mix in organic amendments (sold 
by the bag at nurseries). 
</P>
<P>
But if you don't want to water much, you may prefer to simply plant them in 
unamended soil and then be careful not to overwater once they become 
established. 
</P>
<P>
On sloping ground, no amending of the soil is necessary. They are good soil 
holders and grow well on hillsides, even in fairly heavy soil like that found 
on the Pacific Palisades bluffs or in Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
Near the beach they grow in full sun, although they will grow in some shade. In 
Brentwood, Ruth Borun grows a meadow of Pacific Coast hybrids under a huge 
camphor tree. The camphor lets through spots of sunlight and the plants get 
regular water. 
</P>
<P>
At Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden in Claremont, they are grown in full sun and 
are not watered between July and September, so they clearly tolerate extremes. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Borun points out that fall is the time to tidy up the clumps -- to cut off 
the dead leaves and the seed stalks. Otherwise, the plants become choked with 
old leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Coast iris are difficult to divide or move about, but it can be done in 
November or December, just as the plants are making new roots. Be careful not 
to break these fat white roots as you dig the clumps from the ground. Cut off 
the old rhizomes that are no longer flowering and replant. 
</P>
<P>
GARDENER'S CHECKLIST 
</P>
<P>
 For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions on what to do in the garden this 
week from the California Assn. of Nurserymen: 
</P>
<P>
Whether planting vegetables or flowers, be sure to dig down deeply and add 
organic matter to improve soil. 
</P>
<P>
The color impact of your garden can be increased by planting containers with 
seasonal annuals as a finishing touch. 
</P>
<P>
Sow vegetables such as lettuce, radishes, corn and carrots in successive 
intervals to lengthen your harvest. 
</P>
<P>
Check out the day lily because it comes in many colors, heights and blooming 
seasons -- making it a versatile plant to use in your landscaping plans.

HOME IMPROVEMENT;

MOTION SENSOR LIGHTS SEEM LIKE BRIGHT IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY ABRAMS, Abrams is a Los Angeles general contractor and free-lance 
writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many homeowners do not realize that one of the best spin-offs of the electronic 
revolution for home security is a motion-sensing light switch that 
automatically turns on the lights only when a person or automobile approaches 
the property, and then turns them off after a one- to five-minute interval. 
</P>
<P>
The switches can be adapted to most existing outdoor light fixtures or can be 
purchased as a complete set with flood lamp sockets that can be installed to 
replace virtually any existing outdoor light fixture without new wiring. 
</P>
<P>
In the front of the house or on the side or back, motion sensor lights can be 
placed anywhere that security lighting is desirable without the added expense 
of burning several hundred watts of light all night long, and without the 
problem of bright lights eliciting complaints from neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
The motion sensor switches come with a sensitivity adjustment knob to allow a 
range of up to 75 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of time the lights remain on is adjustable too, normally ranging 
from one to five minutes. The switches also employ a photoelectric cell to 
assure light activation only during hours of darkness. 
</P>
<P>
Motion sensor light switches and complete fixtures are now sold at most major 
hardware stores and home centers. Prices vary from store to store, but a 
complete motion sensor light fixture can usually be found for under $75. 
</P>
<P>
The motion sensor switches and complete fixtures are designed for relatively 
easy do-it-yourself installation. When installed into an existing junction box 
that is already wired, the typical homeowner can hook it up in less than an 
hour. Installation instructions are very clear. 
</P>
<P>
With the new sensor light hooked up to replace an existing light fixture, 
simply leave the inside light switch in the "on" position to have the lights 
working automatically. 
</P>
<P>
If you are having a party or want the lights to remain on to illuminate a 
driveway basketball court, for example, normal body motion will keep them lit 
without interruption.

REMODELING: GENERAL CONTRACTORS USUALLY HIRE SPECIALISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM DIECKMEYER, Dieckmeyer is president of the Remodelers Council of the 
Building Industry Assn. of Southern California (BIA/SC). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to our January column, readers asked a number of interesting 
questions, which we'll address this week. 
</P>
<P>
QUESTION: If I hire a general contractor to build our room addition, will I 
also need to hire an electrician and plumber? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: A general contractor, under California license, can do the complete 
job. However, they generally negotiate with licensed subcontractors for the 
work you mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
If you have a specific subcontractor that you would like to use, be sure to 
discuss this with the general contractor before the job starts. Most generals 
will accommodate you by using your subcontractor for the job or permit you to 
contract directly with that particular sub. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that if you contract directly with your sub, the general 
contractor will not want to direct nor be responsible for that subcontractor's 
work, warranties, insurances or liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
The general contractor is responsible for his own subcontractors' work and 
therefore it is better to let the general contract with his own subs. He's 
probably been doing work with them for some time and is aware of their 
expertise and capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Written Contract Required by State 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is a contract necessary for all remodeling jobs? 
</P>
<P>
A: Contractors are required by California law to provide a written contract for 
any work valued at $300 or more. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contractors Provide Limited Warranties 
</P>
<P>
Q: Should a contractor have a warranty for his work? 
</P>
<P>
A: In the construction industry, most contractors provide limited warranties on 
labor and material, with a pass-through warranty from the general contractor to 
the homeowner for appliances, motors and manufactured items. However, this is 
not required by law. 
</P>
<P>
Many established remodelers have outside insurance companies provide a 
five-year extended limited warranty such as provided by the Homeowners Warranty 
Corp. (HOW). It is my opinion that all remodelers should provide at least a 
minimum, written one-year limited warranty. 
</P>
<P>
Be sure to remember, a limited warranty with the contractor is only as good as 
the contractor's integrity, stability and financial circumstances. Limited 
warranties from outside insurance companies eliminate these problems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Who Should Apply for Building Permits? 
</P>
<P>
Q: When remodeling a home, who applies for the building permits? 
</P>
<P>
A: Generally, the general contractor, or whoever is responsible for the 
construction, applies for the permits. Many municipalities will not permit a 
homeowner to take out some permits because of the technical aspects involving 
safety, such as plumbing, gas and electrical jobs. 
</P>
<P>
If the contractor takes care of the permits, the city has control over checking 
for licensing, bonding and workman's compensation and liability insurance along 
with recourses for corrections and/or non-code conditions. 
</P>
<P>
If your contractor should ask you to pull the permits, either by advancing 
money and/or signing the application, you would be well advised to take a long, 
second look at the legality of his license and require certificates of 
insurance for both workman's comp and liability to reassure yourself that all 
is in order. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contractor Makes Calls for Inspectors 
</P>
<P>
Q: Who calls for building inspections on the framing electrical, plumbing and 
mechanical components of the job? 
</P>
<P>
A: The contractor is responsible for scheduling all inspections and usually 
meets all inspectors on the job site to answer questions and/or perform minor 
corrections on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
This eliminates the need for many reinspections and facilitates completion 
time. It is not uncommon to ask the homeowner if he or she will be home for 
some of the minor inspections. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, for liability reasons, no inspector will enter your home without an 
adult being present.

INVESTMENT RULES FAVOR THE SMALLER PLAYERS; 
</P>
<P>
TAX DEDUCTIONS: PASSIVE-LOSS FORMULA HAS GREATEST APPLICATION FOR THOSE WITH 
INCOMES UP TO $100,000. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you think you can shelter all your ordinary income, such as wages, interest 
and dividends from income taxes by investing in depreciable real estate, such 
as apartments, offices, stores or rental houses, think again. The 1986 Tax 
Reform Act killed real estate as a major tax shelter -- except for the small 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
If you earn less than $100,000 annual adjusted gross income, you can deduct up 
to $25,000 of losses each year from your passive-loss realty investments. 
</P>
<P>
Between $100,000 and $150,000 adjusted gross income, your tax loss deductions 
are gradually phased out at the rate of $1 for each $2 of income over $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
If you earn over $150,000 adjusted gross income, forget about deducting your 
real estate tax shelter losses unless you invest in low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, several major real estate syndication firms have become unable to pay 
their bills as they come due. Why? Because they haven't been able to sell their 
properties, such as office buildings and apartment complexes for the increased 
market values they were counting upon. Potential buyers just aren't interested, 
primarily due to the lack of a tax shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Most experts attribute the depressed prices for large investment properties to 
the 1986 Tax Reform Act, which discourages wealthy investors from buying 
depreciable real estate. In addition to the maximum $25,000 annual passive loss 
deduction, if your adjusted gross income is less than $100,000, the rules 
require depreciating residential rental property over at least 27.5 years and 
commercial properties over 31.5 years. Depreciation is a non-cash tax deduction 
for estimated wear, tear and obsolescence. 
</P>
<P>
However, the news about passive-loss deductions is not all bad. If you have 
annual passive-loss deductions that you cannot use, you can "suspend" them for 
future use. IRS Notice 88-94 says passive losses from an investor's rental 
activities, taken as a whole, can be used to offset profits from property 
sales. This means that the IRS says rental property losses can be used to 
shelter profits from property sales. Some tax advisers previously thought 
losses and gains had to be offset on a property by property basis. 
</P>
<P>
The 1986 Tax Reform Act says all income and expenses from rental property are 
"passive" no matter how much time or money the owner spends managing the 
property. Even when out-of-pocket cash losses result, except for the maximum 
$25,000 annual loss deduction, passive activity losses must be saved for 
possible future use. This lack of immediate tax deductions discourages 
investors from tying up their money in real estate investments. 
</P>
<P>
Three basic rules apply to real estate passive investments:

<P>
1 -- Investors who own less than 10% of a property, partners who own less than 
10% of a limited partnership and owners who do not materially participate in 
managing their property cannot qualify for passive loss deductions. Material 
participation is considered to be involvement in major management decisions, 
even if a property manager handles the day-to-day property supervision. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- Owners who materially participate in managing their property qualify for 
up to $25,000 of annual passive-loss deductions against their ordinary income. 
This "small investor exception" to the disallowance of passive-loss deductions 
phases out at the rate of $1 for each $2 of adjusted gross income over $100,000 
($200,000 for investors in qualified low-income housing). 
</P>
<P>
3 -- Until the $25,000 maximum passive-loss rule phases in by 1991, 65% of 
passive losses were deductible in 1987, 40% on 1988 tax returns, 20% for 1989 
and only 10% of 1990 property losses are deductible against the investor's 
ordinary income. With these limitations, the result is that more than $25,000 
of annual passive losses can be deducted by investors until the end of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Just because most of the real estate tax shelter is gone doesn't mean real 
estate is a bad investment.

ROUTE TO THE NEW HOME: FOLLOW THE PAPER TRAIL; 
</P>
<P>
DOCUMENTS: THE MAZE OF PAPER WORK THAT GREETS HOME BUYERS IN ESCROW IS MOSTLY 
IN HANDS OF PEOPLE YOU NEVER MEET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
You have found a home to buy. Your offer has been accepted. You have managed to 
read, understand and deal with the paper work involved in committing yourself 
to a piece of real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Don't breathe that sigh of relief yet. There's more. 
</P>
<P>
Now you have to get the money to pay for your home, and you have to make it 
through escrow. Financing requires organization and work on your part. Escrow 
paper work, though very important to you, is mostly in the hands of people you 
will never meet. 
</P>
<P>
The paper work varies from lender to lender. But you will probably see some 
version of these basics for a single owner-occupied property, as outlined by 
George A. Matthews, vice president and area loan manager of Great Western Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Residential Loan Application. This is the first form the borrower will see, 
often accompanied by the Loan Disclosure (see below). The questions here are 
straightforward inquiries about the type of loan you are applying for, the 
property you want to buy and you. It asks about income, assets, debts and where 
your down payment will come from. 
</P>
<P>
Now suppose, as is often the case for first-time buyers, the down payment is 
borrowed from parents, with the understanding that it will be repaid when the 
house is eventually sold. Great Western requires that a "gift letter" be in the 
borrower's file, a statement from the parents that the money is a gift. Each 
lender handles the gift situation differently. Some lenders require that half 
the down come from your own resources. How carefully all this information is 
verified also varies. The lender will tell you about how much insurance 
coverage you must have to get your loan. 
</P>
<P>
Federal rules require that you be given a consumer handbook that explains in 
plain language how mortgage loans work and translates often-bewildering 
"lenderese" terms. An approval/denial decision must be made within 30 days of 
the lender having the completed application in hand. But lenders have different 
definitions of what constitutes a "completed application." 
</P>
<P>
Statement of Assets and Liabilities. A supplement to the application, more 
space to summarize what you own and what you owe. 
</P>
<P>
Authorization to Disclose. A catchall permission for the lender to check into 
your credit, employment, mortgages and deposits. This covers inquiries you have 
not specifically authorized anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
Loan Disclosure. Required by the Office of Thrift Supervision (formerly the 
Federal Home Loan Bank Board) for owner-occupied homes, whether the loan is 
adjustable or fixed rate. It gives the specifics of loan terms without giving 
actual numbers: It explains limits on adjustments to payments and the interest 
rate, whether the loan is assumable, if it is due on sale, whether it involves 
negative amortization, how the impound account, if any, is set up to pay taxes 
and insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Read this one carefully and be sure you understand it. 
</P>
<P>
Flood Insurance Notice/Acknowledgement. Required by the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency -- if the home you are buying is in a flood plain and you 
want to be eligible for federal relief in case of a disastrous flood. This is 
sent to you, at the latest, when notice of loan approval is sent. 
</P>
<P>
Fire insurance, incidentally, is always required by a lender; earthquake 
insurance is not. A lender may also insist on sinkhole, mudslide, demolition or 
other types of insurance, depending on the type and location of the property. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Truth-in-Lending Disclosure Statement. The Office of Thrift Supervision 
requires that this be sent to you within three working days after you begin the 
application process -- thus, it is sometimes referred to as a "three-day." 
</P>
<P>
It tells you the relevant numbers: interest rate, how much you are borrowing, 
how much you will have paid at the end of 30 years, your payment schedule, 
late-payment charges, prepayment penalty, if any. 
</P>
<P>
The three-day version is an estimate, for your information. Before the close of 
escrow, you get a similar form with firm numbers (except for long-term costs, 
which can't be predicted with certainty for an ARM); this latter one you sign. 
</P>
<P>
Good Faith Estimate of Settlement Charges. Another "three-day," required by the 
federal Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (RESPA). This lets you 
know where the money you borrow is going: to you, the seller, the property 
inspector, the appraiser, the escrow company, the notary, the title insurance 
company, public agencies, the pest inspector, anyone holding claims against the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
This document itemizes your "prepaid finance charge," which includes the loan 
origination fee, loan discount (or points), credit check fee, prepaid interest, 
mortgage insurance fees. (These terms, by the way, are explained in the 
Settlement Costs pamphlet; see below.) 
</P>
<P>
And -- hang on -- you may yet have to pay more than is listed here. 
</P>
<P>
Settlement Costs Booklet. One more "three-day," required under RESPA and 
produced by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This pamphlet 
explains in plain language the home-buying process and many of the terms you 
will see on your loan documents. Even with its tiny green type, it is well 
worth careful reading. Worksheets are included to help you shop for services. 
</P>
<P>
Itemization of Amount Financed. The final version of the Good Faith Estimate. 
By signing it, you are acknowledging that you've read it and that everything is 
as you understood it would be. Review it carefully before you sign. 
</P>
<P>
Loan Commitment. The lender's notice to you that you got the money. Practice 
varies among lenders; Great Western's letter reviews the numbers you have seen 
on other documents and summarizes features such as negative amortization, 
assumability, interest rate limits. 
</P>
<P>
Promissory Note. This is your IOU for the loan. You've almost made it now: This 
is one of the last loan documents you see. The lender returns it to you when 
your loan is paid off. It may go by other names, usually involving the word 
note. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, this document reviews your interest rate, payments, limits on 
interest or payment adjustments, and how often adjustments are made. Make sure 
all these numbers jibe with your understanding of what they should be. Once you 
sign this, you are committed to the terms of the loan. 
</P>
<P>
Deed of Trust. With this, you pledge your home as security for the money you 
have borrowed. It means the lender could end up owning the property if you 
default on your loan. You keep the Grant Deed, which is the actual proof of 
ownership of your home. The lender holds onto the Deed of Trust. Signatures on 
this must be notarized, since this is being recorded with the County Recorder. 
By the time you see this one, you may already feel as if you have signed your 
life away. There should be no surprises in this document. 
</P>
<P>
Settlement Statement. An account of where everyone's money has gone, to the 
penny. This serves as a checklist for the escrow officer, who completes the 
two-page form, required under RESPA. Items covered include sales commissions, 
loan fees, insurance fees, taxes, title charges, government recording and 
transfer charges, and additional charges such as survey and pest inspection 
fees. HUD's Settlement Costs booklet explains the terms here, which by this 
point you can probably recite in your fitful sleep. 
</P>
<P>
"Riders" to loan documents. A rider to the Promissory Note, for instance, might 
predict your interest rate when the first adjustment occurs on an 
adjustable-rate loan. 
</P>
<P>
At the eye of the paper hurricane, with documents blowing in from all 
directions, sits the escrow officer. This person must make sure all the money 
and all the papers land in the right hands, that everything is signed and 
recorded, and that it is all legit. 
</P>
<P>
Here are the things the officer keeps track of during the often-mysterious 
process of escrow, as explained by Billie Sandlin of Integrity Escrow, 
president of the California Escrow Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary title search, to determine the condition of title to the property. 
The escrow officer tells the title company to open the search, which involves 
checking County Recorder's records for any taxes, liens or judgments against 
the property or easements; checking court records for judgments against the 
owner; finding out how title is held, whether the owner has the right to sell 
the property and who must sign away any claims on it. 
</P>
<P>
All claims on the property usually have to be cleared before it can be legally 
transferred to the buyer. The escrow company asks the seller's lender for a 
Beneficiary's Demand for payment, that is, what the lender needs to clear its 
claim on the property. 
</P>
<P>
Beneficiary's statement. If the buyer is assuming the seller's loan, this tells 
the condition of the loan, monthly payment, balance due, interest rate, charges 
of any kind and conditions for assumption of loan. That is, everything about 
the loan that a new buyer might want to know. 
</P>
<P>
If payments are overdue, the seller usually has to make them before the sale 
goes through. 
</P>
<P>
Lender's requirements. Before a new loan can be made, the lender will have 
checked the buyer's credit and appraised the property already. It may also 
require a title company inspection of property, copies of the escrow 
instructions, termite report and hazard insurance. The escrow company tells the 
buyer's insurance agent how the policy must read to meet the lender's 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The Deed of Trust and Promissory Note will go to the escrow office, usually the 
place they are signed. The money will go to the title company, which pays off 
all loans of record and sends the rest of the money to the escrow company. 
</P>
<P>
Funds received from the buyer. The purchase deposit goes into an escrow trust 
account. When closing approaches, closing costs plus down payment are figured 
out. If the buyer pays this by a cashier's check on a California bank, escrow 
can close the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Deed or other escrow-related documents. The Grant Deed, signed by seller and 
transferring ownership to buyer, needs to be recorded before a new loan can be 
recorded. The title company is responsible for getting these documents to the 
County Recorder and recording them, but the escrow company must see that it 
gets done. 
</P>
<P>
Proration of taxes, interest, insurance and rents. The escrow officer does all 
the math, so everything is fairly divided on the day escrow closes. 
</P>
<P>
Releases of all contingencies or other conditions. A common example: A sale may 
be subject to the buyer getting a new loan. If contingencies are not met, 
escrow cannot be closed. 
</P>
<P>
Recording of deeds and other documents. This takes place at close of escrow. 
The title company almost always does this, then lets the escrow office know 
it's been done so escrow can be closed. 
</P>
<P>
Title insurance policy, which goes along with the title search. Title insurance 
protects the buyer in case the title company fails to uncover some claim 
against the property. 
</P>
<P>
Closing escrow when everyone's instructions have been carried out. It can be 
done when everything has been recorded and the money is in the hands of the 
title company. 
</P>
<P>
Disbursement of funds, including charges for title insurance, recording fees, 
real estate commissions and loan payoffs. Buyer and seller get individual 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
Final statements for everyone involved. 
</P>
<P>
If you've made it through all of this, congratulations! You've got yourself a 
new home.

LATINOS MUST STAND, DELIVER FOR THE CENSUS; 
</P>
<P>
REPRESENTATION: FUNDS, REPRESENTATION AND GENERAL WELFARE ARE AT STAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Fernando Tafoya, Fernando Tafoya is district manager of the Bureau of the 
Census in Santa Ana. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 1990s will be a decade of change for the Latino community in Orange County 
and elsewhere. As policy-makers debate issues that will affect Latinos over the 
next decade, the Bureau of the Census is compiling the data that will inform 
this debate. April 1, 1990, signals the beginning of the bureau's attempt to 
obtain a complete tally of the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether the Orange County community will be counted completely. A 
complete count is essential to its well-being. Census data is used to 
reapportion political districts. The data is also used to distribute federal 
and state funds, and assess the social and economic needs of the community. 
</P>
<P>
Once residents receive the questionnaire, the issue becomes whether they will 
fully disclose the characteristics of their living situation. For Latinos, a 
number of factors make full disclosure less likely. A large immigrant community 
distrustful of the government may not respond to the questionnaire at all. 
Another complication is that questionnaires will be mailed out in English only. 
Spanish-speaking persons will be referred to a toll-free number where they can 
request a questionnaire in Spanish. Many people may not bother to call, or not 
get to the message in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor is the high cost of housing that contributes to families 
doubling up in small apartments. Many of these families fear being evicted if 
authorities discover how many people are living in the unit. The same high cost 
of housing also contributes to large numbers of unrelated people sharing living 
space to save money. 
</P>
<P>
In order to avoid discovery of this overcrowding, people may not respond or may 
limit their response to include only the "legal" number of residents allowed. 
And many Latinos are homeless. In addressing a complete count of the Latino 
community, these persons must receive special attention. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the many ways that Latinos could be missed, there are solutions. 
Community awareness specialists have been working with community groups, 
agencies, churches, schools and amnesty classes to get the word out for over a 
year. Complete Count committees have been organized nationally to focus on 
counting high-interest groups such as Latinos. There will be Spanish-language 
advertisement campaigns. These are positive steps that will help achieve a 
complete count. However, the Latino community must take active steps to ensure 
full disclosure on the questionnaire. 
</P>
<P>
Only the Latino community can assure Latinos that full disclosure will not 
jeopardize their living situation. Only the Latino community can assure its 
"hidden" members that full disclosure is in the best interests of everyone. 
Only the Latino community can give life to the educational efforts of the 
Census Bureau. Without that active and continuous involvement, a complete count 
cannot be achieved. 
</P>
<P>
The active involvement into overcrowded barrios, to areas where immigrants are 
concentrated and day laborers gather, and to places where the homeless sleep 
will mean working beyond census day on April 1. The more difficult task of 
retrieving questionnaires that fully disclose the characteristics of Latino 
households must remain a central focus for Latinos through the summer of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
By educating the community on the need for full disclosure, Latinos will ensure 
that the 6% to 8% of the community missed in the 1980 census is counted in 
1990. This factor will produce significant gains for everyone, but especially 
for Latinos because political representation will be increased, additional 
funds will be allocated to the community and more social services will be 
provided.

O.C. NEEDS COORDINATING AGENCY FOR ARTS INTERESTS;

OPINION: WELL-PLANNED AND EFFECTIVE CULTURAL EXPENDITURES ARE LONG-TERM SOCIAL 
INVESTMENTS.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES DESMARAIS, Charles Desmarais is director of the Laguna Art Museum 
and heads the Committee for an Orange County Arts Council. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A recent news interview on the drug crisis produced one of those sound bites TV 
can leave gnawing at the rim of one's mind. The speaker, a grammar school 
teacher, was decrying the negative emphasis of an anti-drug campaign that has 
as its theme the phrase, Just Say No. 
</P>
<P>
"What alternative do we offer our kids?" she said. "What are we giving them to 
say yes to?" 
</P>
<P>
Orange County has been presented with the opportunity to say yes -- to plan for 
the kind of social environment in which it will carry on its business, spend 
its leisure time, raise its children. 
</P>
<P>
The Committee for an Orange County Arts Council, an assembly of art leaders, 
has recommended that the Board of Supervisors create a local arts agency that 
would foster arts education, promote the financial health and growth of arts 
organizations countywide and encourage a systematic approach to cultural 
planning for our community. 
</P>
<P>
The ad-hoc committee was made up of 27 members, representing the large-budget 
arts organizations of the county, city arts agencies and emerging groups such 
as Relampago del Cielo (Santa Ana), the Center for the Study of Decorative Arts 
(San Juan Capistrano) and Poets Reading (Fullerton). The committee conducted a 
nine-month study of the cultural needs of the county. We met with 175 arts 
professionals, artists and other interested citizens in a series of "town 
meetings"; we examined the cultural coordinating agencies of nearby counties, 
as well as model agencies nationwide; we looked at the cost of such an agency, 
possible sources of funding and the needs and prospective goals to be addressed 
in our county. 
</P>
<P>
One thing we found was that of 58 counties in California, Orange County is one 
of just two with no agency to coordinate the growth and development of its 
cultural activities. The other 56 -- many of them in rural and depressed areas 
-- have chosen to provide financial support to their local arts agencies. Why 
have they done this, in the face of such social ills as crime, homelessness and 
the drug epidemic? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the political leaders of those counties believe that money spent on law 
enforcement, prison construction, drug interdiction and the like, however 
necessary, amounts to short-term, high-cost damage control. Such approaches may 
temporarily relieve symptoms, but the diseases of ignorance and disaffection 
continue to fester. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, well-planned and effective cultural spending -- while 
certainly no panacea -- are long-term investments in a sane and enriching 
society. 
</P>
<P>
In the 30 years since the founding of the New York State Council on the Arts -- 
a bold innovation that prompted establishment of the National Endowment for the 
Arts and began a movement in which arts councils have been created in every 
state and thousands of communities nationally -- we have had a virtual 
renaissance in our country. 
</P>
<P>
Local arts agencies have leveraged private and corporate gifts and encouraged 
innovation and quality in arts institutions of all sorts, from storefront 
artists' spaces to big-city opera companies. But even as an agency helps the 
arts, it affects and greatly benefits all segments of the community. As a kind 
of broker, or translator, among arts interests, school boards, government, 
business and the rest of the community, local arts agencies benefit their 
communities in myriad ways. To name three: 
</P>
<P>
Education: There is ample evidence that curricula-based arts education improves 
problem-solving, helping children to learn math, science and language skills, 
enhance self-esteem and keeping them engaged and in school. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Cruz, parents, teachers and children formed an advocacy group through 
their local arts agency that worked to put arts education back in the 
curricula. Today a model program is in place. 
</P>
<P>
Economic Development: The arts can help to increase off-season tourism through 
artists' studio tours, festivals and special events. They can enhance elements 
of the design, growth and development of communities by encouraging the 
planning participation of artists. 
</P>
<P>
Local arts agencies are the catalysts and coordination points for such 
activities in other communities; in Orange County, when the arts community 
cooperates in the public interest at all, we reinvent the wheel for each 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Intercultural Understanding: In an era and a community where vast gulfs exist 
among the cultural backgrounds of our citizens, the arts can be an important 
vehicle for communication among groups and an emblem of self-respect for groups 
and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
By fostering multicultural festivals and community events, local arts agencies 
contribute to increased understanding of what we have in common and to pride in 
our diversity. 
</P>
<P>
The Committee for an Orange County Arts Council recommended that the county pay 
for part (44%) of the budget for a new council, at a cost of $125,000 in the 
first year. The issue before us now is whether we can afford not to invest less 
than 6 cents per county citizen in the long-term cultural prospects of our 
community. The question is whether we are willing to say yes.

SURVEY FINDS HOME BUILDERS UPBEAT ON '90 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although they aren't as optimistic as they were a year ago, 184 Southland home 
builders predict that the new-home market will pull out of its current slump 
and that their sales volume will rise by nearly 19% this year. 
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, many of those builders admit that the sales slowdown in 
the second half of last year caught them by surprise and left them with 
hundreds of empty houses. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, some have been forced to slash their asking prices and many are 
postponing new projects until the market strengthens. 
</P>
<P>
Those are just some of the findings of the 19th annual Times survey of 
residential construction and interviews with several of the builders who took 
part. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 184 home builders active in a seven-county Southland area responded 
to this year's survey, answering questions about their 1989 sales activity and 
projections for 1990. One large builder -- M. J. Brock &amp; Sons of Los 
Angeles -- reported its 1989 sales but made no projections for this year. 
</P>
<P>
The William Lyon Co. was named the Southland's No. 1 builder, based on its 1989 
sales volume of $638.2 million. It was the third year in a row that the Newport 
Beach-based company's revenue topped those of other survey respondents. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which completed 3,594 homes in Southern California in 1989, 
expects to build another 3,519 units in two dozen Southland communities this 
year. It will build in five Southland counties, from $95,000-condominiums in 
south Orange County to $450,000-single-family homes in Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
For the fourth year in a row, Santa Monica-based Watt Industries Inc. was named 
the No. 2 builder. It completed 2,613 homes in the Southland last year, and its 
sales volume totaled $543 million. 
</P>
<P>
Watt expects to build another 2,149 units in 22 Southland communities this 
year, from $50,000-condos in Victorville to $3-million single-family homes in 
the posh Westside community of Century City. 
</P>
<P>
About 69% of the homes that Watt builds will be single-family houses. The 
remainder will be apartments, condominiums and townhouses. 
</P>
<P>
The Casden Co./CoastFed Properties of Beverly Hills was ranked No. 3, based on 
the $381.64 million in sales that it logged in its latest fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Casden built 1,757 homes -- most of them apartments -- in the fiscal year that 
ended Oct. 31. About 80% of the units it plans to build this year will also be 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
By and large, the survey confirmed that most of the big builders just keep 
getting bigger. Seven of the Top 10 companies were also in the Top 10 a year 
ago, and all of them were in last year's Top 20. 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting harder for smaller companies to compete because home building is 
becoming more capital-oriented," said R. Chad Dreier, chief financial officer 
of No. 4 Kaufman &amp; Broad Home Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"Development costs are rising, and the processing time and entitlement time is 
getting longer. It's costing more money to build homes these days, and the 
little companies are getting squeezed." 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman &amp; Broad completed 2,050 homes in the Southland in the fiscal year 
that ended Nov. 30, logging $347.217 million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based company plans to build another 1,969 homes in 17 
Southland communities this year. All of its units will be single-family 
detached, with an average sales price of $165,000 -- continuing the company's 
strategy of catering to first-time buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Respondents to the survey complained about a wide range of problems, from sharp 
run-ups in the value of raw land to the difficulty of lining up financing for 
new projects. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most common complaint was that elected and appointed officials, as 
well as slow-growth advocates, are creating costly delays for builders through 
their bureaucratic red tape and -- occasionally -- lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Anna M. Hassell, president of Bella Vida-Jones Ltd. in El Toro, 
said it took three years just to win the approval of local officials to build a 
35-home tract in the San Diego suburb of Santee. 
</P>
<P>
Another year was added when officials ordered changes to the project. Hassell 
complained that actual construction time took yet another year "due to changes 
and city constraints," meaning it took half a decade to build 35 houses. 
</P>
<P>
Several builders said that such long delays add to their construction costs and 
eventually are passed on to buyers through higher purchase prices, exacerbating 
the Southland's already serious affordability problems. 
</P>
<P>
Many builders -- large and small -- also said that they're being hurt by the 
slowdown in new-home sales that set in during the second half of last year. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the 185 builders who responded to this year's survey had a total of 
5,574 empty homes for sale at the end of 1989 -- a hefty 26% more than the 194 
builders who responded to last year's survey. 
</P>
<P>
And in a dramatic reversal, two-thirds of all the builders said they had at 
least some completed homes sitting empty at the end of last year. At the end of 
1988, two-thirds of the builders said they were sold out. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the big builders said they're trying to lure buyers back to their 
tracts by offering a variety of incentives, from price discounts to free trips 
and upgrades. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller builders are feeling the pinch too. 
</P>
<P>
Garfield Sorenson, president of W. B. Construction Co. -- at No. 184, the 
second-smallest company in this year's survey -- built just three homes last 
year but could sell only two. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a three-bedroom, two-bath home in Santa Paula for $169,900 -- that's 
very affordable -- but I haven't been able to sell it for 5 1/2 months," 
Sorenson said. "Last year, I sold an identical home for $185,000. 
</P>
<P>
"If I cut the price again, I'm going to lose all my profit. But I might have to 
bite the bullet. This market is dead in the water." 
</P>
<P>
Even some of the builders who anticipated last year's slowdown and subsequently 
cut back on new development projects remain cautious about 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't start a single new development last year, but (instead) concentrated 
on the three projects we already had under way," said James W. Oates, a 
principal of the Whitehawk Partnership Inc. in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the downturn in sales is going to last long, and we'll probably 
get back into the market toward the end of the year. But right now, we're just 
looking at possible sites -- there's no reason to rush." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the sales slowdown, builders remain optimistic about this year's 
outlook. 
</P>
<P>
About 73% of the builders said they expected to see their sales volume rise 
this year. However, that's down from the 82% who predicted a sales increase in 
1989 from their '88 levels. 
</P>
<P>
If the 184 companies that provided 1990 sales projections meet their 
expectations, their total sales volume this year will reach $14,738,000,000. 
That would be an 18.8% increase over their 1989 sales of $12,402,000,000. 
</P>
<P>
However, builders have a reputation for being optimistic -- sometimes overly 
so. 
</P>
<P>
For example, 137 firms took part in both the 1988 and 1989 surveys. Back in 
'88, they all made projections for sales in '89 -- and 80% said their sales 
would likely improve. 
</P>
<P>
But results from this year's survey show that only 29% of those companies met 
or exceeded their sales goals for 1989. The other 71% fell short. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the builders who responded to the survey said that they're diversifying 
into other types of construction to counter the cyclical nature of the home 
building business. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Weston Development -- until recently a company that built only 
residential property -- last year built two mid-sized shopping centers in 
Ventura County, in addition to 214 homes. 
</P>
<P>
"Commercial property and residential property usually follow different cycles," 
said Bob Jones, a Weston vice president. 
</P>
<P>
"By diversifying into shopping centers, we're smoothing out our cash flow and 
aren't as vulnerable to the ups and downs of the home-building business." 
</P>
<P>
Despite widespread concern that the nation is becoming overly dependent on 
imported oil and gas, only 13 builders -- 7% of the survey's respondents -- 
said they plan to construct homes or pools with active solar-energy systems. 
</P>
<P>
In the previous year's survey, 9.3% of the builders said they would include 
solar-energy systems in their new homes. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, nearly half of the 3,648 planned units that will have solar-energy 
systems will be in two large apartment projects built by one company -- GBW 
Properties Inc. of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"The up-front cost of installing the systems is pretty high, but we can recoup 
the investment in about a year and a half because it reduces the time it takes 
to lease up the project," said Ken Charlton, GBW's chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
The solar-energy systems reduce the typical tenant's bill by about 25%, 
Charlton said. "Since the tenants know that their utility bills are going to be 
lower, they're usually willing to pay a little bit more in rent. That helps us 
recover part of our up-front costs too."

The name of each company is followed by its headquarters city and then by its 
principal officer. Sales figures are given for 1989, and have been limited to 
residential sales in Kern, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San 
Diego and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
Sales projections are for anticipated residential sales in the above-mentioned 
counties for 1990. The number of units constructed in 1989 includes units 
completed for sale during 1989 and is broken out by number and percent of each 
type of unit: single-family homes, apartments and condominiums (including units 
in planned-unit developments). Inventory includes any units completed for sale 
that were unsold by the end of the accounting period. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Ranking is based on rounded sales figures. Subtotals may not add to 
100.0% due to computer rounding. Firms with the same 1989 sales volume are 
ranked in alphabetical order. 
</P>
<P>
* Firm reporting on a fiscal-year basis.

COVER STORY: 'BARBARA WALTERS SPECIAL': AN OSCAR-NIGHT TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Daniel Cerone 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Warren Beatty, with the demeanor of an innocent man being led to the gallows, 
approached Arnold Schwarzenegger at a wedding not long ago. As Barbara Walters 
tells the story, Beatty, a media recluse who had not done a one-on-one TV 
interview in more than a dozen years, was beginning to feel a sense of doom 
about his impending session with Walters. 
</P>
<P>
"Have you done it yet?" Beatty asked Schwarzenegger earnestly. "What did she 
ask you?" 
</P>
<P>
With his interview scheduled for the next week, Schwarzenegger decided to have 
some fun. He said to Beatty, "The first thing that she asked me was, 'Of all 
your women, which one was the best?' " 
</P>
<P>
Beatty grew nervous and concerned. "She did?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
Schwarzenegger said, "Yeah. And the second question was, 'How much money do you 
have?' They must have some great researchers, Warren. Because she knew how much 
money I had, right down to the penny." 
</P>
<P>
Walters laughed nervously, recounting the incident that was told to her by 
Schwarzenegger. The TV interviewer, like an experienced big-game hunter, has 
built her larger-than-life reputation on bagging the most elusive celebrities 
and political figures, and Schwarzenegger's practical joke could have cost her 
one of her greatest trophies to date -- an interview with the tight-lipped 
Beatty. 
</P>
<P>
"The Barbara Walters Special," an Academy Awards night tradition that airs 
Monday on ABC (Channels 7, 3, 10, 42) immediately following the Oscar ceremony, 
features three of Hollywood's blockbuster movie stars -- Beatty, Schwarzenegger 
and Chevy Chase. 
</P>
<P>
Chase headlined the surprise $70-million holiday hit, "National Lampoon's 
Christmas Vacation." Schwarzenegger and Beatty, meanwhile, are sitting on two 
of this summer's potentially biggest films. Schwarzenegger stars in "Total 
Recall," a reported $60-million science-fiction epic, and Beatty produces, 
directs and stars in a film version of the comic strip "Dick Tracy," 
co-starring Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
This wasn't the first time around for Walters and Beatty. About 20 years 
earlier, she interviewed him on NBC's morning show "Today." She abruptly cut to 
a commercial in the middle of the segment because Beatty's responses were so 
nervous and halting. She calls it her worst interview ever. 
</P>
<P>
"We both talked about that and laughed," said Walters, sitting in her Century 
City office overlooking Los Angeles, where she recently took a breather from 
her cross-country schedule -- she maintains homes in New York City and Bel-Air. 
</P>
<P>
"Warren remembers the interview even better than I do," she continued. "He 
reminds me of an artist who paints a picture and wants to stay silent and let 
people make their own interpretations of the work. He always felt interviews 
got in the way of the film, which is totally different from Schwarzenegger, who 
markets and packages himself like a product to sell his films. Now Beatty wants 
to step out." 
</P>
<P>
And what better place to step out than on a Barbara Walters special. If all the 
world's a stage, then Walters has the best seat in the house. A parade of top 
celebrities, world leaders, royalty, business tycoons and professional athletes 
have all faced her. Over the years, she has fostered a safe and familiar haven 
where superstars emerge as ordinary people. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a place where they can tell it like it is," Walters said. "Their words 
are not going to be distorted. They're not sitting there thinking, 'Is this 
going to be a hostile interview?' So much of today's journalism is tearing 
down. You know, 'If we can't make a mean piece, than we're not going to make 
it.' So I think, in that sense, they feel safe. 
</P>
<P>
Chase apparently felt safe enough in his interview with Walters to admit 
publicly for the first time that he left "Saturday Night" too soon, that he 
always regretted leaving when he did and that he's been in a professional slump 
until now. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of people who turn us down because it feels too safe," Walters 
added, "as if I have some Svengali power to make them say something they don't 
want to say." 
</P>
<P>
Ever since she became the nation's first female evening news anchor, when she 
accepted ABC's now-famous $1-million offer to join ABC News in 1976, Walters 
has been churning out at least three celebrity specials a year. Their 
popularity is generally reflected in their strong ratings. Walters is a 
hands-on reporter, personally involved in every phase of her interviews -- 
sometimes even in the interview itself. For Monday's special, she joined 
Schwarzenegger for a light workout at the World Gym in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
"Doing the specials, I think, have made me far better known to the country," 
Walters said slowly. "They may have made me more human. But they also made me 
more open to ridicule, because they're easy to make fun of." 
</P>
<P>
Walter's hard-edged interviews are reserved for the ABC news program "20/20," 
where this season the veteran reporter has faced former President Ronald Reagan 
and his wife, Nancy; Pete Rose, Lech Walesa, Ted Turner, Vaclav Havel and NBC 
competitor Bryant Gumbel. 
</P>
<P>
"The specials have taken away from the hard news interviews that I do," Walters 
said. "If I just did '20/20,' I would be regarded in a different way. News is 
kind of a rarefied world. There are certain rules and regulations you're 
supposed to follow. Doing '20/20' has allowed me to keep up my news 
credentials." 
</P>
<P>
Walters says that, unlike many of the celebrities she interviews, her public 
life is much more exciting than her private life. Still, Walters' ABC contract 
lapses next year, and she already is looking to a day when she can slow down 
and spend more time with her husband, studio executive Merv Adelson. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how much longer I'll be doing these specials, truthfully," 
Walters said. "I don't know how many more new stars there are. Each year I 
think, 'Now, this is it. I mean, we've done everybody. There's really nobody 
else to do.' And then along comes a Roseanne Barr or a Tom Cruise. And you say, 
'Well, OK, one more year."'

Your March 5 cover story ("Walter Matthau: TV Actor?") stated the actor's 
reason for doing the TV film ("The Incident") as "the well-written script." 
</P>
<P>
This was not only mentioned in the piece, but accentuated in the accompanying 
bold-faced quote. 
</P>
<P>
Strange thing is, the writer's name did not appear anywhere in the piece. So 
what is it, a state secret? A revelation punishable by death? Did the writer 
request anonymity? If not, I'm sure you will print his or her name in your next 
issue. Right?

 Right. The writers were Michael Norell and James Norell.

I have often wanted to write and tell a television producer exactly how I feel. 
</P>
<P>
However, in the Feb. 25 edition of Viewers' Views, someone beat me to it. 
Bernice Bowers is the woman who commented about Deborah Norville's performance 
on "Today." I agree with her -- Deborah is a horrible replacement for the 
seasoned and even-natured Jane Pauley. I'm glad Bryant Gumbel is there to 
improve things.

MARY HART: SPECIAL BRINGS HART TO HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Daniel Cerone 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Sunday at 6 p.m. on KNBC, Mary Hart will join the fold of broadcast 
journalists who have jumped on the nighttime bandwagon with her first special, 
"Mary Hart Presents: Love in the Public Eye." The one-hour program examines the 
struggles public couples endure to maintain private relationships. The dynamic 
duos who talk include President and Mrs. George Bush, Vice President and Mrs. 
Dan Quayle, Roseanne Barr and Tom Arnold, and Wayne Gretzky and Janet Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Hart herself is no stranger to the limelight. From high school English teacher, 
to Miss South Dakota, to talk show host, the life of the 37-year-old 
"Entertainment Tonight" co-host is an open book. The late Malcolm Forbes placed 
her legs-which were insured for $1 million as a publicity gimmick-from the 
knees down on the cover of the first edition of his new Egg magazine. Daniel 
Cerone interviewed Hart about her new special and her new place in television. 
</P>
<P>
Why did you decide to do a nighttime special? 
</P>
<P>
Paramount and I negotiated a new contract last April for 2 1/2 years. The 
specials were part of my expanded duties for the expanded contract. I'll keep 
hosting "Entertainment Tonight," but I'll also do two specials a year. They 
came about because Paramount felt it was time to expand on what I was doing 
ithin the Paramount world. 
</P>
<P>
I had expressed an idea to come up with an evening program. I think people have 
shown an interest in good reality-based shows, particularly celebrity oriented 
shows. It was completely up to me and my creative team to develop the concept. 
</P>
<P>
What is the concept for "Mary Hart Presents: Love in the Public Eye"? 
</P>
<P>
The idea started with me and my husband, Burt Sugarman. We've been married for 
about a year now. We wondered: "How do you keep a semblance of normalcy in your 
personal life and your relationships, when you're constantly being watched and 
written about? How do you stay immune to it all? Or do you?" 
</P>
<P>
So far, it hasn't been too difficult for me and Burt to conduct our 
relationship privately because we work together. He was in the entertainment 
business for years and helped executive produce this show. I couldn't find a 
better partner to work with-both personally and professionally. That's been our 
saving grace. 
</P>
<P>
Why are people so fascinated by celebrities? 
</P>
<P>
We have our politicians to scrutinize and examine, but we don't have the kind 
of royalty that some countries have. We all need our heroes. And in America, 
entertainers are larger than life, and they become heroes for many people. We 
vicariously live out fantasy lives through them. It comes down to that basic 
desire to say, "Look how good somebody else has it." Or during rough times to 
say, "Look how bad they have it." Either way, you can compare yourself and 
indulge in a little self-pity or self-satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
When we started at "Entertainment Tonight," for the first three or four years, 
we were all a little worried that people would finally have their fill of 
celebrity news and interviews. But we just came off our highest ratings period 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
There are more celebrity segments on the network nightly news programs than 
ever before. And the morning shows have increased their celebrity coverage 
dramatically. It's a phenomenon that has grown and grown. 
</P>
<P>
Your celebrity stature seems to be growing day by day. Did you know that 
Malcolm Forbes was going to use your legs on the cover of his new Egg magazine? 
</P>
<P>
They wouldn't have done that without my permission. Malcolm called me himself 
and explained the concept of the magazine to me, that it was a new pop culture 
magazine with a sense of humor-a fun sense of humor, not negative like Spy 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
What he told me was that my legs have become a symbol of pop culture in 
America. I've been asked so many times for photos of my legs, and I always 
refused. But this was the first time it sounded like an intriguing and fun 
idea. They promised me that it wouldn't be a cruel story, and they were true to 
their word. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrity interviews are generally considered soft news. Do you receive 
criticism for being a soft news reporter? 
</P>
<P>
I work in a soft news environment. I have not tried-and I don't feel a burning 
need-to prove that I can do harder edged interviews. I don't feel the least bit 
defensive about it. I come from a talk show background. I developed and 
produced my own talk shows in South Dakota, Iowa and Oklahoma City before 
coming to Los Angeles to "PM Magazine." 
</P>
<P>
No news about entertainment television is ever going to be considered as hard 
news. I sat for years listening to people call "Entertainment Tonight" gossipy. 
That doesn't bother me. When people think about Hollywood, the very name 
becomes almost synonymous with gossip. That's OK by me. With this new show, we 
hope it will be entertaining, and somewhat enlightening also. 
</P>
<P>
You talked to some public figures who rarely grant personal interviews. Why did 
they agree to be on your show? 
</P>
<P>
I hope it's because they're comfortable talking with me. I've spent a number of 
years talking about them on "Entertainment Tonight." I think there's a comfort 
level and a trust that has built up. 
</P>
<P>
I do my homework. I think I'm a good listener. And I try to make sure that I'm 
nice in my approach. I can ask tough questions, but there's a difference in 
doing it in a way that can be perceived as mean or digging, as a opposed to a 
way of doing it nicely. I want people to go away with the feeling that they 
enjoyed doing the interview with me. 
</P>
<P>
How did you assemble the guests for your special? 
</P>
<P>
I made a lot of phone calls. First, I came up with a list of people I wanted to 
talk to. I didn't want to make a special about just movie stars or TV stars or 
rock stars. I wanted to go beyond the world of entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
I was curious about the Quayles ever since they first began campaigning 
together for the vice presidency. This is their first sit-down interview 
together in their home. I was very flattered that they did it. I think you will 
see a very interesting interview. They hit the issue of negative publicity 
head-on. They're charming and strong as a couple. But they have a sense of 
humor about the vice president's negative image.

men, lifelong friends and writing partners, who are suddenly confronted with 
terminal illness. Lithgow portrays an obsessive chain-smoker with a family. 
Woods plays a loner with a penchant for trendy health foods who is diagnosed 
with lung cancer-an illness that may be due to breathing his partner's 
cigarette smoke for 20 years. The two-hour ABC movie will air in May or next 
season.

After screening an early cut of "Dreamer of Oz: The L. Frank Baum Story," 
executives of the NBC programming department "were so impressed" that they 
decided to push back the air date of the fantasy TV movie starring John Ritter 
from its scheduled fall premiere to December. The network said that the holiday 
season is more appropriate for the special effects-packed family drama, about 
the author of "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz." The movie co-stars Rue McClanahan, 
Annette O'Toole, Charles Haid, David Schram and Jerry Marin, one of the 
original Munchkins from the 1939 movie classic.

It's not enough to see Hal Fishman, Pat Lalama and Warren Olney et al during 
almost every commercial break; we must also put up with a recap of a recap for 
a recap via those obtrusive boxes during the credits of movies shown on KTLA, 
KTTV and KCOP. 
</P>
<P>
Why? I don't know. It's the same news we heard 20 minutes earlier, most of 
which we're already aware of anyway. It's unfortunate enough that most films 
are cut. If that can't be helped, the stations at least can show their film 
libraries a little respect by giving the 10 o'clock newscasts a rest until 10 
o'clock.

<P>
In regard to the March 8 edition of "48 Hours," I was depressed, maddened and 
confused to see those various episodes of people so busy, busy, busy. 
</P>
<P>
Get it done! Let's move in the fast lane! Gotta stay on the go-that's the name 
of the game in this day and age! All very efficient. 
</P>
<P>
So much so that their children are ignored. "Well, the kids have a busy 
schedule too." 
</P>
<P>
OK. But where and when does all this busy efficiency filter down to the common 
folk? Every time I call someone, I get a recording saying they're busy, "but 
we'll get right back to you" -- rarely is that the case. A letter mailed with 
an enclosed self-addressed, stamped envelope is seldom returned. I have an 
automobile accident (not my fault), and it takes weeks just for an insurance 
man to look at it. 
</P>
<P>
Just what is being done by these movers and shakers?

WHEN A TEEN IDOL TRIES TO BREAK AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jason Bateman is prime teen idol material. The 21-year-old regular of NBC's 
"The Hogan Family" is dreamboat cute, and teeny-boppers around the country tune 
into the popular sitcom every Monday evening at 8:30 to gaze at his baby blue 
eyes. 
</P>
<P>
But Bateman doesn't want to be a teen dream and has refused to become fodder 
for teen magazines. 
</P>
<P>
"Two, three and four years ago, those magazines were pounding at my door," 
Bateman said. "I constantly ran away from them. Still, they used existing art 
and took quotes and excerpts from other interviews, so there was some exposure 
in them. Being a teen-ager and on a situation comedy kind of puts you in that 
bracket, but I don't feel like I am a Kirk Cameron or a Scott Baio. After this 
series makes its initial run, hopefully the transition to adult actor will be 
easy. I expect it to." 
</P>
<P>
Bateman took his first adult steps at 19 when the producers let him direct an 
episode of "The Hogan Family," thus becoming the youngest person ever admitted 
to the Director's Guild. Bateman also directed an episode this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I want do to any more episodes," he said, between tosses of 
his football in his dressing room. "It's a lot of extra work, and you can't 
concentrate on your own acting bit. I'm real interested in growing as an actor. 
I would like to take the steam I have built up here and push toward doing some 
acting, as opposed to just performing (on a series)." 
</P>
<P>
Bateman hopes his new feature film, "Sketches," due for release later this 
year, will help him break out of the sitcom mold. He plays a young man with 
leukemia who drives across the country with two friends. 
</P>
<P>
Despite acting since he was 10, Bateman insists that he had a normal childhood. 
The majority of his friends are former high school buddies. Though one of his 
good friends, he said, is an actress-big sister Justine, who played Mallory on 
the long-running series, "Family Ties." 
</P>
<P>
"On the whole, I pretty much dislike most actors," he said. "This business can 
be kind of cheesy at times, and I am real thankful I have real people in my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
These "real" people, Bateman said are "surfers-broke surfers who paint houses 
and build houses." 
</P>
<P>
And they all hang out at Bateman's house. "I have a roommate now who is my best 
friend," he said. "There's a full court basketball in the living room and a 
pool table in the dining room, so it's pretty nice. There's a satellite dish on 
the roof and a 60-inch TV set. There's poker nights on Tuesday. It's a very 
normal 21-year-old life." 
</P>
<P>
When he's not acting, Bateman participates in several sports, including auto 
racing. "I did the Long Beach Toyota Grand Prix two years ago and won it on my 
first year," he said proudly. "I really enjoy and respect driving. It's not 
something I have been recognized for, and it was a new experience. I jumped 
into it and got lucky." 
</P>
<P>
Bateman also jumped into golfing last year and after one lesson is shooting in 
the 90s. "It's like car racing," he said. "It's just you and the ball. It was 
so aggravating because it was so difficult. I'm the type of guy who picks up 
sports like boom! I couldn't get this one, and then I finally started to play 
it well. Now I am a member of a country club." 
</P>
<P>
But he said don't expect him to go Hollywood. "I've done my share of telethons. 
I just think it's sort of a cliche to jump on this big trendy bandwagon and 
stand behind some thing that a lot of people don't know anything about," he 
said. "I have so many things better to do with my weekends, like playing 
basketbaal with my high school friends. It's so much more important to me than 
running around with the paparazzi on Saturday or Sunday. Acting is my job, 
which I love and respect, but it's not my lifestyle."

VIDEO'S BLACK BOX; 
</P>
<P>
'UNDERGROUND' PRODUCT CIRCUMVENTS CODING ON PRERECORDED CASSETTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Psssstttt. Wanna buy a black box?" 
</P>
<P>
Don't be surprised if some huckster approaches you this way in or around your 
local video store. The black box is a mechanism that erases Macrovision. That's 
the anti-copying protection encoded on many prerecorded cassettes, which 
produces a distorted picture if you try to copy a tape. 
</P>
<P>
By hooking up the black box to two VCRs-inserting a blank tape in one and a 
Macrovision-encoded cassette in the other-the box electronically strips the 
Macrovision coding so that the picture on the copy is not distorted. 
</P>
<P>
Most black boxes are sold for $50-$90 by mail order-many from ads in consumer 
electronics magazines. But some black boxes are sold in the $25 range by 
enterprising businessmen who hang around video stores, which are loaded with 
potential buyers for these boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Many home-video fans hate Macrovision. Before it was perfected and used 
extensively, all that was needed to copy a rented movie were two VCRs, a set of 
wires and a blank tape. But with Macrovision, encoded in the tape by the 
manufacturer, the picture on the copy is jittery or spoiled by erratic 
brightness or uneven color or various forms of visual noise. It's not easily 
watchable. 
</P>
<P>
According to recent industry surveys, 10% to 20% of VCR owners engage in 
copying of prerecorded tapes, which is a violation of federal copyright laws. 
That percentage would be much higher if so many tapes weren't protected by 
Macrovision. Of the 190 million movie cassettes made in this country last year, 
88 million (or 46%) were encoded with Macrovision. 
</P>
<P>
Often when home-video customers find a rented tape has a distorted picture, 
they assume that while Macrovision was being encoded at the factory, it warped 
the picture in the original copy. 
</P>
<P>
Vigorously defending his company's product, Macrovision's Bill Krepick, vice 
president of sales and marketing, claims that last year only a handful of such 
quality complaints were legitimately traceable to the Macrovision process. 
</P>
<P>
It's not only the consumer who's interested in the black box. Retailers often 
buy them to make rental copies that are Macrovision-free in order to build up 
their inventory of hit films for the cost of blank tapes. What often happens, 
Krepick explained, is that customers will get copies that the retailer made 
imperfectly. "But that's not the fault of Macrovision," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Macrovision was first introduced in late 1985, used on the movie "The Cotton 
Club." But then the process wasn't perfected and instead it distorted the 
picture in the original prerecorded tape or didn't successfully make the copy 
unwatchable. For a while, Macrovision fell out of favor with home-video 
companies that pay for the process, roughly one-half percent or less of the 
retail price per copy. But the process has been improved, leading to its 
extensive use. 
</P>
<P>
Macrovision's primary enemy is now the manufacturers of these black boxes. Six 
to eight companies make them, Krepick estimated. He declined to speculate on 
how many black boxes are in use. "These are underground operations," he said. 
"Nobody knows how many boxes are made or sold because it's hard to get 
legitimate figures." 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to reach any company reps for comment are futile. Anticipating 
prosecution, these outfits operate rather covertly. Though reachable through 
the 800 numbers used to place orders, the company reps aren't interested in 
talking to the press. 
</P>
<P>
The scales of justice are tipped in favor of these manufacturers. The products 
protect themselves by including such notices as, "This object must not be used 
for copying anti-copy encoded information carriers, except as permitted under 
copyright law." 
</P>
<P>
Macrovision's sole recourse is to sue for patent infringement, a slow process 
that would be extremely expensive-for Macrovision. What Macrovision is pushing, 
Krepick said, is an amendment to the federal copyright law that would outlaw 
the sale and distribution of the black boxes and subject violators to stiff 
penalties and jail terms.

MEET NICK AND NORA AND REPARTEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE SALTZMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The best part of home video is being able to view films long lost to memory or 
last seen on late-night TV in mutilated, scratched, barely viewable prints cut 
up for commercial breaks that come every 1O minutes. 
</P>
<P>
That brings us to Nick and Nora. 
</P>
<P>
Nora: (Commmnting on a woman she has seen her husband with) "Pretty girl." 
</P>
<P>
Nick: "Very nice type." 
</P>
<P>
Nora: "You got types?" 
</P>
<P>
Nick: "Only you, darling. Lanky brunettes with wicked jaws." 
</P>
<P>
A case can be made that Nick and Nora Charles, the wickedly sophisticated 
husbasbaand wife detective team that burst upon the scene in 1934 in "The Thin 
Man," changed America's perception of what married life could and should be. 
</P>
<P>
Here, finally, were two witty people, in love and married, just as clever and 
affectionate after marriage as their single screen counterparts were before 
marriage. This was a radical concept in the 1930s when director W.S. Van Dyke 
decided to put the Dashiell Hammett characters in the movies. Sharp cookies 
like William Powell and Myrna Loy, who played the "retired" detective and his 
heiress wife, were usually single, sexy heroes who didn't marry, if they 
married at all, until the fade-out. 
</P>
<P>
Not Nick and Nora. 
</P>
<P>
They were two mature adults cavorting on the screen, bickering, trading 
one-liners, obviously enjoying each other's company. They did everything 
worldly married couples do except sleep in one bed-in those years, everyone in 
the movies slept in twin beds. 
</P>
<P>
The grand surprise is that Nick and Nora, deliciously played by Powell and Loy, 
are just as wonderful company today as they were 50 years ago. MGM/UA has 
released the "Thin Man" series of six films on videocassette at less than $25 
each. 
</P>
<P>
"The Thin Man" (1934, 93 minutes, tape and laser videodisc) was shot in 16 days 
and opened to sensational reviews. It was box-office smash, and Powell and the 
film received Oscar nominations. Watching "The Thin Man" on the small screen is 
the best of champagne, all sparkling and so agreeable to the senses that the 
rather overwrought plot can be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich fashioned the daring repartee and 
fast-moving screenplay from the more serious Hammett novel. (After Nick is 
wounded fighting the good fight, he opens the paper, looks at the front page 
and says, "I'm a hero. I was shot twice in the Tribune." Nora: "I read you were 
shot five times in the tabloids." Nick: "It's not true. He didn't come anywhere 
near my tabloids.") 
</P>
<P>
Here was a married couple who had a sense of humor about each other, who drank 
more than today's health-conscious generation would allow and who still had 
time to face danger and solve a mystery. Add a surrogate child (the perfect 
child, silent and housebroken) in the guise of a wire-hair terrier, Asta, and 
you have a symbol of wedded bliss. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, the name of the film and series has little meaning. The "thin 
man" is not Nick Charles but an eccentric inventor (played by Edward Ellis) 
whose disappearance sets the plot in motion. 
</P>
<P>
"The Thin Man" and its sequel, "After the Thin Man" (1936, 107 minutes) are 
glorious romps. It's also fun seeing young actors in the series who would go on 
to more fame, including Jimmy Stewart, Donna Reed and Cesar Romero. 
</P>
<P>
Director Van Dyke was responsible for two more films, but they never equaled 
the bubbling quality of the first two. One problem is that the Charleses are 
given a human child, who along with Asta, threatens to turn the series into 
"Ozzie and Harriet" solve a crime. 
</P>
<P>
The third film, "Another Thin Man" (1939, 101 minutes) was the last to be based 
on a Hammett story and holds up. "Shadow of the Thin Man" (1941, 97 minutes) 
features a young Donna Reed . 
</P>
<P>
Although Powell and Loy remain as ingratiating as ever, the series turns into a 
predictable sitcom with "The Thin Man Goes Home" (1944, 100 minutes). 
</P>
<P>
The last in the series, "Song of the Thin Man" (1947, 86 minutes) is better. 
Dean Stockwell (of "Quantum Leap") makes an appealing Nick Jr. 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA has done a fine job of packaging, and the videos have the crispness of 
the original prints. 
</P>
<P>
The idea that wedded life can be the greatest of fun may be just as 
revolutionary a lesson for the video generation as it was for 1930s moviegoers. 
Nora had the money and the kind of husband to be as independent as she wanted 
to be. Nick loved her for who and what she was, not for what she could do for 
him.

THE MIGHTY QUINN; 
</P>
<P>
NOT EVEN HEART SURGERY KEEPS ANTHONY QUINN DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About a year ago, Anthony Quinn deliberately and painstakingly chiseled a large 
sculpture of a depleted man dying in the desert, his arm still strong and 
defiant, holding a sword high above his head. The 74-year-old actor, sculptor 
and painter got his inspiration to create the marble figure- which he called 
"Destroyed but Not Defeated" -- from the theme of Ernest Hemingway's novella, 
"The Old Man and the Sea." 
</P>
<P>
The marble statue was an omen. 
</P>
<P>
Several months later, Quinn suffered severe chest pains. They came during an 
exhaustive ocean shoot in the Virgin Islands during the filming of "Ernest 
Hemingway's Old Man and the Sea" as a TV movie (Sunday at 9 p.m. on KNBC). 
After the shoot, tests revealed that two of Quinn's arteries were almost 
completely blocked and the others were as crusty as the muddy boots on one of 
his screen villains. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctors said, 'We can avoid an operation. We can give you medicine, and 
you can go on the way you are,' " Quinn said gruffly. "And I said, 'To hell 
with it. I don't have the energy. I'll either die or be cured.' " 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Quinn underwent three hours of heart bypass surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"The consequences are that I'm much stronger," Quinn said recently from his New 
York office, a week after he was released from Mt. Sinai Hospital. "I'm walking 
about three miles a day now. I'm in good shape. A bull." 
</P>
<P>
Destroyed but not defeated. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Old Man and the Sea," Quinn plays a fisherman, once considered the best 
in his village, who sets out to catch a "great fish" after 84 days without a 
bite. Quinn calls the role the biggest statement he's ever attempted. 
</P>
<P>
"I just read a book about the life of (late film director) John Huston," he 
said. "You can see in Huston's life that the sharks were all eating him at the 
end, surrounding his boat, taking a whack at the great pictures he made. That 
happens to every man. I expect it to happen to me any day now." 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't yet. Quinn has been praised for his work on canvas ann on screen. 
Quinn the artist has showings at a gallery in Honolulu, where his works command 
a generous price. Quinn the actor has been honored with Oscars for roles in 
"Viva Zapata!" (1952) and "Lust for Life" (1956). 
</P>
<P>
Because of his Mexican heritage, the Chihuahua-born actor has played roguish 
characters of mostly foreign descent-an Italian strong man in "La Strada," a 
Greek peasant in "Zorba the Greek" and Arab leaders in "Lawrence of Arabia" and 
"Lion of the Desert." But eventually, Quinn faced typecasting problems in the 
United States and 10 years ago moved to Italy. 
</P>
<P>
"In America, they always wanted me to play Italians, Indians or Mexican 
bandits," said Quinn, who made about 25 European films after moving there. "I 
was doing all right in Italy. And then suddenly, I said, 'I'm an American I I'm 
not going to be forced to work in Europe.' " 
</P>
<P>
Director Tony Scott took a chance on Quinn last year in the steamy film 
"Revenge," co-starring Kevin Costner. It was Quinn's first U.S. movie in more 
than a decade. Shortly after he began work on "The Old Man and the Sea." The 
actor said the heart condition that plagued him during the shoot actually 
brought him closer to the old man. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a weak old man. He's not terribly strong. Without the angina, I was too 
strong for the part," Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn is a Hemingway fanatic. He once had the chance to meet Hemingway at a 
bar, but the usually bold actor got cold feet. Quinn said the writer was drunk 
at the time, and "I was afraid that he might insult me. I never saw him after 
that." 
</P>
<P>
As long as Quinn is able-or perhaps even longer-he will keep working. "I was 
born to work," said the actor, whose first job came shortly after the Mexican 
Revolution when, at 2, he collected sticks in the desert with his mother to 
sell for firewood. In his storied career-which has seen him as ditch digger, 
fruit picker, boxer and taxi driver-Quinn said he has made at least 265 motion 
pictures and more than 1,000 drawings, 500 paintings and 250 sculptures. He 
even sang on three record albums. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned to read between the lines of what Hemingway wrote," Quinn said. 
"In 'The Old Man and the Sea,' it's the unwritten expression that we all have 
to go out for the big fish. I think it's a parable. It's like every man's life. 
We all know the dry periods, the 84 days without a fish. Every man experiences 
that. He says, 'Give me one last chance, even though I might fail, before I 
die.' "

HOUSING PLAN DIVIDES CANDIDATES IN QUIET RACE;

EIGHT ARE VYING FOR TWO OPEN SEATS. THE CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN NOTICEABLY FREE OF 
THE CITY'S OFTEN-DIVISIVE POLITICS OF THE LAST 20 YEARS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is not uncommon to hear residents here refer to their seaside community as 
an island, but when it comes to politics, few would describe the city as a 
paradise. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's City Council election, however, is shaping up to be different from 
many others in recent years. Eight candidates are vying for two open seats and 
are evenly split on the hottest election issue, a huge proposed housing 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the campaign has been noticeably free of the often-divisive politics of 
the last 20 years -- two decades that included a recall of three council 
members and a bitter 1988 fight over a slow-growth initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"This election is a lot more quiet than some people thought it would be. People 
were all geared up for more mudslinging," said candidate Douglas Hoxeng, who 
has lived in Seal Beach for 31 years and runs a downtown tavern. "It's nice to 
have the candidates get along." 
</P>
<P>
The seats up for grabs represent two of the most diverse council districts in 
Seal Beach, a city of distinctive neighborhoods that is an island surrounded by 
the Naval Weapons Station, the San Gabriel River and the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
In District 1, which covers downtown and Surfside, the candidates are Orange 
County planner Charles Antos, firefighter James Cook, property management 
specialist Marilyn Bruce Hastings, tavern operator Hoxeng and engineering 
contractor Joe Rullo. 
</P>
<P>
In District 3, which covers part of the Leisure World retirement community and 
the area just between Pacific Coast Highway and Gum Grove Park known locally as 
the Hill, the candidates are financial controller Galen F. Ambrose, Planning 
Commissioner Gwen Forsythe and insurance executive Dennis K. Pollman. 
</P>
<P>
The current council members from the districts -- Victor S. Grgas and Joyce 
Risner -- are prohibited from running again because of a two-term limit. 
</P>
<P>
The mild tone of this election can be explained in part by a common campaign 
theme: Keeping Seal Beach basically the way it is now. 
</P>
<P>
Quality of life -- or what a recent newspaper real estate advertisement 
described as the "charisma of Seal Beach living" -- has been the central issue 
in much of the city's political battling. 
</P>
<P>
All the candidates say they fear anything -- especially development -- that 
might make the city an undesirable place. 
</P>
<P>
"Seal Beach has been the same for the last 15 years and will essentially stay 
that way," said Grgas, noting that there has been deep-seated opposition by 
residents to major changes in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The issue that divides the candidates is what to do with a 149-acre piece of 
picturesque land in the heart of town. The Hellman Ranch property, one of the 
few remaining chunks of developable land in the city, offers sweeping views of 
downtown Long Beach and the surrounding beaches and is centrally located off 
Seal Beach Boulevard, one of just two roads that directly connect Seal Beach 
with the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
In October, the City Council voted, 4-1, after months of hearings and debate, 
to approve a 329-home project that sets aside 41 acres for wetlands 
restoration. 
</P>
<P>
Half the candidates are dissatisfied with that Mola Development Corp. plan. And 
an Orange County Superior Court decision delivered March 16 may require the 
incoming City Council to vote on the project, thrusting the Hellman plan on 
center stage in the election. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the development hail the project as far better than the original 
773-unit plan and say it represents a fair balance of environmental and 
commercial concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good compromise. It's important to be open and receptive to all 
sides," said Forsythe, who helped work out an agreement between Mola and the 
city and believes it represents the best deal the city can get. 
</P>
<P>
Other supporters of the compromise are Cook, Rullo and Pollman, all of whom 
stressed that they are for controlled slow growth but believe that some 
development is needed to provide more city revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Most supporters of the plan say the Mola project will not harm the city and 
fear what other kind of development could be built on the private land. "My 
main concern is that if it isn't Mola, what is going to go in there?" Rullo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For critics of the project, however, the compromise does not go far enough in 
addressing environmental and traffic concerns. Ambrose, Antos, Hastings and 
Hoxeng oppose the project, saying they would like a plan that offers more 
wetlands and fewer homes. 
</P>
<P>
"Although property owners have rights, any development must be acceptable to 
the community, because the (residents) inherit any problems," Antos said. 
</P>
<P>
The staunchest development foe is Ambrose, who has made the evils of 
development the centerpiece in his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
As vice president of the Seal Beach-based Wetlands Restoration Society, he 
helped prepare the lawsuit that resulted in the Superior Court ruling that is 
forcing the city to revise its outdated General Plan and review the Mola 
development for a second time. 
</P>
<P>
"Seal Beach is in a crisis . . . as massive developments go through that will 
change our city," Ambrose said at an election forum. "Is the city of Seal Beach 
going to sell itself like a whore to the first person who comes along with a 
checkbook?" 
</P>
<P>
Mola foes say they believe that the project will cause traffic, pollution and 
even crime in the city of 26,000 people and that the diplomatic attitude taken 
by project backers will lead to overdevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
"People are concerned about traffic on Seal Beach Boulevard once this thing is 
in," Hastings said. "When they're done, I don't know if anyone is going to get 
through if there's an emergency. The traffic will be terrible." 
</P>
<P>
Grgas, who supports Rullo, described some of the statements made by anti-growth 
candidates as "hysteria" and said the city could be vulnerable legally if it 
tries to violate people's property rights. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the General Plan revisions, it is uncertain whether the vote on the 
Hellman Ranch plan will come before the current council or the newly elected 
council, which will take office May 15. Both supporters and opponents of the 
Mola development agree that the project faces an uncertain future if 
anti-growth forces win at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
Grgas and Risner were part of the 4-1 majority that supports the project. Their 
open seats could make possible a shift to a 3-2 majority against the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Growth has traditionally been a hot issue in Seal Beach. A 1988 initiative that 
would have restricted the City Council's power to vote on certain development 
issues prompted a furious and divisive campaign. The measure ultimately failed 
at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
However, the current debate over development is tame in comparison with the 
politics of the mid-1970s, when pro- and anti-growth candidates repeatedly 
clashed over the General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier that decade, three city councilmen were recalled and two city managers 
were ousted in power struggles over control of the council. 
</P>
<P>
In this year's election, other issues have been discussed in the race besides 
development, but there seems to be more agreement on them. Most candidates have 
called for better communications between the council and the citizens, and many 
support repairing old sidewalks and maintaining strong police and fire 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
"The infrastructure is a less-than-glamorous thing, but it still must be taken 
care of," Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
Hastings, Antos and Cook have focused attention on the loss of sand on several 
city beaches, calling for sand replacement and other measures. Hoxeng and 
Pollman have stressed their ties to the Seal Beach business community and say 
they would best represent all the elements of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Pollman wants the city to sponsor athletics programs for teen-agers as a 
deterrent to drugs. 
</P>
<P>

THRILLS COME IN ALL SIZES AT AIRPORT WINGDING; 
</P>
<P>
AVIATION: 18,000 ATTEND "AIRPORT DAY 90" IN FULLERTON, WHERE ATTRACTIONS RANGED 
FROM THE GOODYEAR BLIMP TO RADIO-CONTROLLED MINIATURE PLANES.

Even Fred Brandenfels, who had no intention of being around Fullerton Municipal 
Airport on Saturday for an air show, liked the festivities. 
</P>
<P>
Brandenfels, of Eugene, Ore., had flown here to spend a day at Disneyland, then 
planned to fly home Saturday. But he was grounded temporarily because planes 
could not take off during the show. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here watching the show and my wife is watching her watch," he said. "I say 
if you have to get stuck and stranded, the best place to do it is at an air 
show. So, today I'm a happy and frustrated aviator." 
</P>
<P>
He was one of about 18,000 people at the airport watching parachute teams 
perform precision sky diving and small-scale model airplanes perform 
aerobatics. "Airport Day 90" also included fly-bys by World War I and World War 
II vintage aircraft and a visit by the Goodyear blimp. Sponsored by the city 
and the airport, the show was the third such event held at the site since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
A major attraction was the California Air Show Team, whose members maneuvered 
miniature airplanes in loops and dogfights by radio control. 
</P>
<P>
"If it can be done with a full-size bird, it can be done with a miniature," air 
team announcer John Elliot told the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Miniatures cost between $500 and $3,000, depending on how advanced the model 
is, Elliot said. Some of the model planes at the show have been used in movies, 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to provide an air show in miniature since FAA rules won't allow 
(full-size planes) to perform here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Wolfe, another Air Show Team member, said: "People consider these as 
toys. They are not. Sure it's a hobby, but it's also a sport." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 20 full-size aircraft flew by or into the airport for the show, 
including a 1917 Fokker triplane, a single-passenger Super Cub, three Marchetti 
planes used to teach combat fighting and a Spearman biplane with pilot Rick 
Vargas and Chris Alba performing the "Wing Walker": Alba stood on the top wing 
strapped to a support frame and waved to the crowd as the aircraft flew by. 
</P>
<P>
Not all the planes were able to make it to the show as planned. Even though it 
was a warm, sunny day in Fullerton, fog in other cities delayed departures or 
caused cancellation of flights. 
</P>
<P>
Guests included Robert Gilliland, test pilot of the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, 
considered by aviators to be the fastest plane in the world; Roland Sperry, one 
of the original "Flying Tigers," and Don Taylor, holder of more than 30 world 
records for flying experimental aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Lila Lovell of Huntington Beach said: "I thought it was fantastic. I've never 
been so close to a blimp before." 
</P>
<P>
Marie Marciel of Fullerton said she had been to every one of the air shows. 
</P>
<P>
"The crowd is bigger this year," she said as she tended to her 9-year-old 
grandson, Brian Ceballos. 
</P>
<P>
Clad in shorts, a T-shirt and an Air Force cap, Brian played with a toy plane 
and leafed through an aircraft magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"I like airplanes," he said. "I want to be an Air Force pilot when I grow up. I 
went to my first show when I was 5 years old." 
</P>
<P>
Vintage, modern and experimental aircraft were on exhibit. In the afternoon, 
helicopter and airplane rides were also available. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsoring the plane rides were Orange County members of 99s, a group of women 
aviators.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: TRAIN BUFF'S DREAM: RIDING THE RAILS TO PARIS AT 186 
M.P.H. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
It was a boyhood dream come true. 
</P>
<P>
I was about to board France's TGV, the 186-m.p.h. Train a Grande Vitesse, in 
the town of Rennes on March 17, when I was told that I would be sitting in the 
front cab, next to the engineer. 
</P>
<P>
The sleek, low-slung train looked like a high-tech version of the giant worm 
described in the science fiction novel "Dune." 
</P>
<P>
All those days and nights in my youth spent playing around with an American 
Flyer train set -- complete with tunnels my father built from wire, plaster and 
papier-mache -- replayed in my mind. 
</P>
<P>
This included, of course, those times when I opened the throttle on my electric 
transformer too far and sent my train careening around sharp curves into 
telephone poles, billboards and even an occasional passenger depot. 
</P>
<P>
Brrrng! With the sound of a school bell, which is the authorization to depart, 
TGV engineer Georges Beuve, a 28-year veteran of the French National Railroad, 
turned what looked like a steering wheel to increase the amount of electricity 
going from an overhead power line above the tracks into the train's 
all-electric motors. 
</P>
<P>
The engines answered with a whine reminiscent of "Star Trek's" starship 
Enterprise, only we were still earthbound. We glided out of the station and, 
within a minute or two, were traveling at more than 100 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
I was aboard the TGV as part of a tour by Orange County officials and business 
executives who had come to Europe to compare the French technology of steel 
wheels on a steel track with a train magnetically levitated without friction at 
a test track in Emsland, West Germany. The California-Nevada Super Speed Train 
Commission hopes to select one of the two technologies later this year for a 
proposed Anaheim-Las Vegas route. 
</P>
<P>
The sun-bleached town of Rennes, dotted with orange-tiled roofs, rapidly shrank 
behind us. Ahead, poles, trees and farms swished by in an endless blur. Another 
TGV approached us on the next track and looked as if it would hit us head-on. 
We were on a stretch of older tracks, and multiple steel rails seemed to weave 
through each other, crisscrossing several times. There was much more swaying in 
the cab than in the passenger compartments, in which I had earlier ridden from 
Paris to Rennes. 
</P>
<P>
Denis A. Doute, a French train consultant accompanying me, tried to be 
reassuring. Some of these crisscrosses can handle the TGV at very high speeds 
without a derailing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The TGV's cab resembles an airplane cockpit but with fewer lights and dials. 
One light indicates what the last safety switch we passed over indicated about 
the condition of the track. Another indicates whether it's safe ahead and is 
backed up by a system of bells and buzzers. A small computer screen provides 
speed, time and other data, with analog backups, all right in front of the 
engineer. There's also a lever for the horn, a radio-telephone and a 
microphone. 
</P>
<P>
Behind us, a mainframe computer forms part of the cabin's rear wall, monitoring 
the train's performance and automating most of its operations. Attached to it, 
in the engine compartment behind us, is the "black box," which records 
performance data for evaluation later. 
</P>
<P>
Both the engineer and I sat on chair-stools facing the dashboard. 
</P>
<P>
As we hit a stretch of new track, under which is concrete instead of wooden 
ties, Beuve turned the wheel again to get more power. We hit 186 m.p.h. This is 
the maximum speed allowed by TGV officials, although they say the train can go 
much faster. 
</P>
<P>
We raised our voices slightly to be heard. Cows grazed on nearby fields, not 
lifting a head in response to the noise. They rushed by like videotape on fast 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
If only my father -- and the guys back in my office -- could see me now! 
</P>
<P>
 Cars on a nearby highway seemed to be in first gear. This felt strange. In 
Southern California, cars frequently overtake Amtrak trains I ride. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, without warning, the engines whined down. We rapidly lost speed. 
Normally this happens when the engineer coasts to save power or wants to avoid 
braking, which saves on maintenance costs. Beuve is trained to cut power at 
just the right times to ensure that the train will come to rest at the right 
spots without braking. 
</P>
<P>
But now something was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"We have lost all power," Beuve announced calmly in French. "There is no 
electricity in the overhead line." 
</P>
<P>
He kept one hand on the power wheel while fiddling with the ignition switch. A 
fail-safe device requires that he touch the power wheel or floor pedals every 
so often, or else the train automatically brakes to a stop. 
</P>
<P>
A national railroad inspector also riding with us in the cab showed no sign of 
panic, either. He simply asked Beuve a few technical questions. 
</P>
<P>
After a few minutes of coasting, the motors kicked in again. Beuve learned from 
a radio message that another TGV train traveling about six miles behind had 
come onto the same electrical power grid, overtaxing an older power station. 
</P>
<P>
Slamming through the countryside at 186 m.p.h. again, suddenly there was a loud 
thump on the front windshield. 
</P>
<P>
"A bird," Beuve said in French. 
</P>
<P>
Doute said birds used to be a big problem but "most of them are smarter now. 
They have learned to stay away." 
</P>
<P>
Another TGV approached head-on, my stomach turning as it seemed to come within 
inches of hitting us. 
</P>
<P>
The train's windshield has a yellow stripe painted across the top, like the 
tinting on auto windshields, to help railroad workers see the train before it 
strikes them, Doute said. The train is painted a silvery gray and blue and 
fades into the background horizon easily. By the time someone hears it coming, 
it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
Entering a tunnel, it became pitch-black. The train has no headlights. I felt 
as if we were hurtling inside Disneyland's Space Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, a tiny dot of light ahead exploded into sunlight at the tunnel's end. 
My ears popped. 
</P>
<P>
We passed under a bridge. Doute said it was made of wood to please 
environmentalists. "They think the animals around here will like the wood 
better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another bridge was topped by electrified fencing to keep vandals away, although 
Doute said damage from vandalism is not frequent. 
</P>
<P>
One TGV engineer was killed, he said, when someone once hung a large rock over 
the side of the bridge, right at the height of the train's windshield. 
</P>
<P>
As we approached Montparnasse station in Paris, the train slowed gradually, and 
we passed a series of sound walls in different shapes that bounce noise at many 
different angles. 
</P>
<P>
Doute pointed out that we had reached Paris in two hours, even though we had to 
slow down for the last few miles through the Paris suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the network effect," Doute said. "We use old tracks for part of the trip 
but still gain a lot of time by traveling faster on the other section. . . . We 
have a saying that you don't have to go as fast as you can to attract 
passengers, but only as fast as necessary." 
</P>
<P>
The TGV Atlantique train quietly came to rest at exactly the right spot on the 
passenger platform. Beuve, the engineer, picked up a black briefcase and, 
wearing a light jacket, climbed backward down the steps. 
</P>
<P>
"Au revoir," he said, before disappearing into the warm, hazy Parisian 
afternoon.

16-YEAR-OLD BOY KILLED BY GUNFIRE AFTER HE REPORTEDLY SHOOTS AT MAN

<P>
A 16-year-old boy was shot and killed outside an apartment complex Saturday 
after he reportedly shot and injured a man during a dispute over drugs, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Another man also was shot in a separate incident that police believe may be 
related. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds to me like a fight that started one place with people driving around 
in cars trading shots with each other," Santa Ana Police Sgt. Joe Easter said. 
Police believe several youths were involved in the shootings, which occurred 
within blocks of each other early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Police gave a sketchy account of the incidents. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old youth was gunned down and killed about 1:40 a.m. in front of an 
apartment complex at 801 S. Townsend St. as he fled from unknown assailants, 
Easter said. The teen had not been identified late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe the youth shot a man in an argument over drugs, then was chased 
by the man's companions and gunned down in the street in front of an apartment 
complex. The man who was shot at was not identified by police and was not 
seriously wounded, Easter said. He was treated at an area hospital and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
Easter said the third shooting occurred nearby, at 1st and Fairview streets. An 
unidentified man was wounded and police said they did not know his condition. 
Investigators so far have been unable to link this third shooting to the other 
two but police said they believe all three are connected.

Oklahoma State won two individual titles and made a strong showing in the 
consolation round to gain its second consecutive title Saturday at the 60th 
NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys built an 8 1/2-point lead during the afternoon session, after 
opening the day tied with Arizona State, and clinched their 29th title when 
Oklahoma's Joe Reynolds defeated ASU's Thom Ortiz, 7-3, at 142 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma State had clinched the championship before its first finalist set foot 
on the mat. Freshman Pat Smith, top-seeded at 158, won an 11-7 decision over 
Scott Schleicher of Navy. Defending 177-pound champion Chris Barnes of OSU 
repeated with a 10-2 decision over Minnesota's Marty Morgan. Iowa also won two 
individual titles but was nosed out by Arizona State for second place. Oklahoma 
State finished with 117.75 points, ASU 104.75, and Iowa 102.75. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawkeye individual championships were won by Terry Brands, at 126 pounds, 
who beat Nebraska's Jason Kelber, 3-2; and his twin brother Tom Brands, at 134 
pounds, beating top-seeded Dave Zuniga of Minnesota, 9-7. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton finished 24th, the highest finish ever for the Titan team. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton heavyweight David Jones, ranked ninth nationally before the 
tournament, lost to Jon Llewellyn of Illinois, 8-5, in a third-place match. 
</P>
<P>
Jones had defeated Llewellyn, 7-6, in Friday's quarterfinals before losing to 
Penn State's Greg Haladay on a criteria decision in the semifinals. Jones 
defeated Navy's Brett Bourne, 3-1, in overtime of the consolation semifinals to 
reach the third-place match. 
</P>
<P>
Jones finished 25-5-2 and his fourth-place finish is the highest ever by a 
Fullerton wrestler.

Johnny Ray suffered a sore neck and a few moments of lightheadedness Saturday 
after being hit on the helmet twice during a simulated game. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' second baseman was hitting right-handed when a Scott Bailes 
curveball sent him diving to the dirt, and was hitting left-handed when a 
fastball got away from Bryan Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
Ray's neck snapped back on the second occasion and he needed several minutes to 
regain his composure, but walked off the field unaided. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of figured it was my day to get out of there after the second one," Ray 
said. "It wasn't too bad. It's one of those things. Pitchers just lose one 
sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
Ray felt fortunate that he lost no more than his breath. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty scary when you're looking at a ball coming at your head at 
90-something miles per hour and feeling that you can't get out of the way," he 
said. "Other than that, it was a piece of cake." HELENE ELLIOTT

ROLISH PITCHES A NO-HITTER, STRIKING OUT 18, FOR SERVITE

Chad Rolish of Servite High School pitched a no-hitter and struck out 18 in the 
Friars' 4-0 victory over Bishop Montgomery in an Angelus League game Saturday 
at Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
The senior left-hander, relying on his breaking ball, walked three but had 
two-strike counts on each of the three batters he didn't strike out. Two 
grounded to short and the other popped out. 
</P>
<P>
Rolish (2-0) has struck out 30 in 14 innings this season. He played for 
Servite's junior varsity team last year after transferring from Orange 
Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
Servite (7-3, 1-1 in league) scored its runs in the fifth inning. Rolish came 
in on a squeeze by Ed Crippen. Steve Sandoval's bases-loaded single drove in 
two, and the final run scored on a passed ball. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Montgomery is 2-5-2, 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Amat 3, Mater Dei 0 -- Right-hander Eric White allowed three hits and 
struck out six to lead host Bishop Amat (6-4, 2-1) past Mater Dei for the fifth 
consecutive year on its home field in La Puente. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei (8-3, 2-1) had only two runners reach third base and had its best 
scoring opportunity in the sixth, when it loaded the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Amat broke a scoreless tie in the sixth inning off relief pitcher Colin 
Galronski. Juan Hernandez hit a two-out single to right to drive in a run and 
another scored when right fielder Frank Setera misplayed Hernandez's hit. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Amat increased its lead to 3-0 when Ted Persell lined a single down the 
left-field line, scoring Hernandez. Bishop Amat got only two hits off starter 
Jason Dietrich, but the Lancers got four singles off Galronski in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Ellis, Mater Dei's leadoff hitter, had two of the three hits off White and 
stole a base. Mater Dei stole five bases, including two by catcher Cale Carter. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't ever seem to come here mentally prepared to play," Mater Dei Coach 
Bob Ickes said. "White didn't overpower us, but he threw strikes and we didn't 
hit the ball." TOM HAMILTON

The Dons (19-5, 8-3 in conference) are tied with Riverside (19-6, 8-3), which 
had a bye Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Martineau hit a three-run home run in the fourth inning to give Rancho 
Santiago a 3-0 lead. But Golden West tied it on a three-run home run by 
pinch-hitter Josh Bammer in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
In the bottom of the fifth, Steve Grack hit a double, advanced to third on an 
error and scored on Jeremy Sherman's single to give Rancho Santiago a 4-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman added an RBI double in the seventh for Rancho Santiago's final run. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Nay (3-1) got the victory, working 3 2/3 innings of shutout relief. Matt 
Lackie earned his second save, allowing one hit in the final 1 1/3 innings.

ROUGH TIMES IN A PROTECTED MARKET; 
</P>
<P>
AUTO PRODUCTS: ARMOR ALL STILL COMMANDS 81% OF SEGMENT SALES, BUT CRACKS HAVE 
STARTED TO APPEAR IN THE FIRM'S ONCE-INVINCIBLE DEFENSES IN THE FACE OF 
MOUNTING COMPETITION.

<TEXT>
<P>
Almost from the day that it was introduced in 1972, Armor All Protectant has 
been a hit in the retail marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
Within a few years of its debut, millions of car owners had become convinced 
that they couldn't do without the waxy white spray treatment for vinyl, 
leather, plastics and rubber: a classic case of a product creating its own 
market. 
</P>
<P>
By 1979, when founder Alan Forman Rypinski sold the company, then based in 
Irvine, to San Francisco's McKesson Corp. for $49 million, Armor All Products 
Corp. controlled 93% of the market in terms of sales dollars. 
</P>
<P>
And since the day that it opened its doors, Armor All, now headquartered in the 
southern Orange County community of Aliso Viejo, posted nothing but a string of 
ever-increasing profits. 
</P>
<P>
Until now. 
</P>
<P>
Armor All's once-invincible grip on the market has begun to slip. The company's 
longtime president has resigned. Armor All has admitted that for fiscal 1990, 
which ends Saturday, it will report the first decrease in annual earnings in 
its history. And Wall Street has responded by trashing the company's stock. 
</P>
<P>
The turmoil underscores that Armor All is a textbook example of what can happen 
when an entrepreneurial company grows up without changing its management style 
and when success goes unchallenged for too long. 
</P>
<P>
True, the company's current 81% market share, as reported by A. C. Nielsen 
Co.'s Market Research Group, is still an awesome position that most companies 
can only dream of achieving. But it signals to a plethora of would-be 
challengers that there's a chink in the champion's armor. 
</P>
<P>
It is also true that Armor All is reporting only a decline in earnings -- not a 
loss -- and that the decline comes in the wake of a major expansion. 
</P>
<P>
But the report of the earnings decline was embarrassing. It came just two 
months after company President Jeffrey M. Sherman said, after three consecutive 
quarters of declining profit, that the fourth quarter would pick up and that 
fiscal 1990 earnings "are expected to be flat to down modestly." 
</P>
<P>
On March 12, the company repudiated Sherman's statement and said fourth-quarter 
and annual profit would be down significantly. At the same time, the company 
announced the resignation of Sherman, who had been president since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
The events caught market analysts off guard, and the company's stock promptly 
lost 15% of its value. 
</P>
<P>
Trading in the days immediately after the March 12 announcements was frenetic. 
On March 13 alone, 38.8 million shares changed hands -- an average of nearly 
two sales for each of the 20.9 million shares of stock outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
By Friday, two weeks after the announcement, trading had returned to a normal 
volume of about 10,000 shares a day, but the stock price closed at $14, down 
35% from the $20.75 at which it began the year. For its part, McKesson, which 
still owns 83% of Armor All after selling 17% of the company's stock in a 
public offering that raised $41 million in 1986, has raced to reassure 
investors and customers that the market reaction is excessive and that there is 
nothing fundamentally wrong with the company. 
</P>
<P>
The first step was to name Kenneth C. Hicken, longtime executive vice president 
of operations at McKesson, to serve as Armor All's new president and chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
McKesson and Armor All also have teamed up to communicate their message to 
institutional investors and to the scant handful of stock analysts who monitor 
and issue reports on Armor All. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials are being closely questioned in three areas: 
</P>
<P>
* The sudden appearance in the market 18 months ago of a well-financed, 
determined challenger. Son of a Gun! protectant, from the STP division of First 
Brands Corp. in Danbury, Conn., is the first of more than 120 Armor All 
imitators to capture a significant market share, climbing to 10% of the dollar 
volume in less than two years. 
</P>
<P>
* The company's ambitious expansion drive overseen by Sherman in late 1988. It 
generated unforeseen costs and didn't come across with the promised profit. 
</P>
<P>
* A corporate culture that stressed freewheeling entrepreneurial values and 
failed to keep close tabs on the nuts and bolts of what had become by early 
last year a major distribution operation. That style apparently ended with 
Sherman's resignation and Hicken's arrival Monday at Armor All's new $7-million 
corporate headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts believe that the company's biggest obstacle is its new, 
well-heeled challenger. 
</P>
<P>
Jeanine C. Heller, auto products analyst with Stifel Nicholas, a St. Louis, 
Mo., brokerage, said she based her recommendation at the end of February that 
clients sell their Armor All shares largely on the push that Son of a Gun! was 
making. 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot have a competitor spending as much as First Brands has been 
spending to market Son of a Gun! without it affecting profits," she said. "They 
are attacking Armor All with huge amounts of advertising and they are buying 
shelf space for Son of a Gun!" 
</P>
<P>
Heller said she believes that First Brands will pull back on its advertising to 
improve profit, "but they obviously think it is worth it. Their presence could 
wreak havoc with Armor All's profits." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Bowen, vice president of marketing for First Brands' auto products 
division, said the company spent $6 million last year on Son of a Gun! 
advertising. In comparison, Armor All spent about $7 million advertising its 
protectant. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, both companies spend millions on incentives to retailers in an 
effort to get good displays on store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
First Brands decided to launch a challenge to Armor All's supremacy, Bowen 
said, "because we figured that was one of the automotive after-market areas 
showing growth and with room for us." 
</P>
<P>
One of First Brands' strategies has been to price Son of a Gun! considerably 
below Armor All. A 20-ounce bottle of Son of a Gun! retailing for $2.97 at a 
Kragen Auto Parts store in Costa Mesa is displayed next to a 16-ounce bottle of 
Armor All, priced at $4.47. 
</P>
<P>
And while officials at Armor All say the challenge has not forced them to lower 
prices, they have increased the fluid weight of its most popular size. A new 
20-ounce bottle of Armor All Protectant now shouts "25% Free. 4 Oz. Extra" at 
the top of the label. At a Chief Auto Parts store in Santa Ana, the new size 
was priced at $4.49 versus $3.99 for the Son of a Gun! 20-ounce bottle. 
</P>
<P>
Hicken, in his first interview since taking over at Armor All, acknowledged 
that First Brands' challenge was forcing his company to spend considerably more 
on advertising and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
He said some of the costs will likely show up in the fourth quarter but warned 
that others could be delayed until the first quarter of the company's fiscal 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
"The board of directors hasn't even seen our proposals yet," he said. "They get 
them on Monday. But basically, we have increased spending for advertising and 
can either take the costs in the fourth quarter, when the ads were made, or in 
the quarters in which they run. It depends on whether the board wants to take 
all the hits in 1990." 
</P>
<P>
Hicken also agreed with analysts that the company has lost the confidence of 
the investment community. But restoring it is perhaps the easiest of the tasks 
facing him. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel comfortable that, for 1991, the numbers we are generating are good 
numbers. We intend to regain our lost face with the Street by doing 
operationally what we say we are going to do." 
</P>
<P>
Hicken said that while fiscal 1990 earnings will fall below the $27.1 million 
posted in 1989, the "stumbles" that led to the decline won't be repeated in 
1991. In fact, new management and financial control measures already being 
instituted will result in a profit increase for fiscal 1991, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not a gloom-and-doom projection for 1991," Hicken said. "Earnings growth 
will be above 1990, although probably not above 1989." 
</P>
<P>
While declining to discuss his predecessor or the specific reasons for 
Sherman's resignation, Hicken characterized the Armor All of just a year ago as 
"a tremendous company that was doing hellaciously well with a bunch of go-go 
entrepreneurs at the helm." 
</P>
<P>
But in late 1988, Armor All acquired the Borden Co.'s car-care products group, 
consisting of Rain Dance and Rally lines of car waxes and the No. 7 line of 
polishes and additives and launched a line of Armor All waxes and washes. 
</P>
<P>
With that $29-million acquisition, Armor All became a multiline distributor, 
and the original entrepreneurial managers "suddenly found themselves in an 
arena they did not have much experience in," Hicken said. 
</P>
<P>
"Armor All was not this little whizzing company anymore, it was a substantial 
corporation." 
</P>
<P>
Several analysts suggested that Armor All's management team dropped the ball 
with the Borden acquisition. (Sherman did not respond to requests for 
interviews.) 
</P>
<P>
"They needed to diversify because having a one-product company is risky, but 
Borden didn't work out as well as they hoped," said analyst Heller. "With the 
Borden products and the new Armor All line of wax they came out with last year, 
they have about 30% of the car wax market, and that can be good," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Hicken acknowledges that Armor All was hurt immediately after the Borden 
acquisitions. He says it was because retailers had overstocked in anticipation 
of a price hike by Borden and they virtually stopped buying for the next 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"This was their first acquisition," said Heller, "and they missed that." 
</P>
<P>
But Hicken disputes claims that a more experienced or less complacent 
management would have seen that Borden poured product into the pipeline and 
would have negotiated a different deal to account for it. 
</P>
<P>
The wax and chemicals buyer for a major automotive parts chain offers one more 
reason for the revenue deficiencies from the Borden acquisition. Armor All 
"didn't push the products very hard and they were priced too high," said the 
buyer, who asked not be be identified because of his company's ongoing business 
relationship with Armor All. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of buyers just backed off," the buyer said. "We thought Armor All just 
bought the Borden brands to eliminate a competitor to the waxes it was bringing 
out under its own name." 
</P>
<P>
That misconception has now been corrected, with Armor All positioning its own 
brand of waxes in a middle range between Rain Dance and Rally and pushing hard 
for sales of all three brands. 
</P>
<P>
Pushing hard for sales is what Armor All has done best in the past, Hicken 
said. It is also at the root of the financial problems he is now charged with 
curing. 
</P>
<P>
Even as the company outgrew its entrepreneurial roots with its 1988 expansion, 
he said, Armor All's management kept stressing what it had always done best -- 
sales and marketing. Scant attention was paid to the unexciting but 
all-important accounting department, where a significant problem was 
developing. 
</P>
<P>
In its entrepreneurial phase, Armor All "had one basic product and a dozen 
SKUs," the product codes denoting product type and package size. Now, Hicken 
said, "there's a dozen products and more than 160 SKUs to keep track of." 
</P>
<P>
The company has cooperative advertising pacts with hundreds of retail chains 
and each quarter must estimate the next quarter's outlay for reimbursing the 
retailers. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a tremendous delay between the time the retailers earn the 
cooperative monies and the time they send in their bills," Hicken said, 
"Because things grew so fast, we had much bigger fourth-quarter outlays than 
anticipated. Several were more than $1 million each, and every million dollars 
subtracts three cents from our per-share earnings." 
</P>
<P>
As part of the new, corporate management style that he is bringing to Armor 
All, Hicken has hired Mervin McCulloch, former Deloitte &amp; Touche regional 
managing partner, to serve as chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
No other management changes have occurred and none are planned, Hicken said. 
"We feel this is a very good team, but the train got a little derailed because 
the controls couldn't keep up with the frantic pace of growth," he said.

WHY HE BOUGHT ECLIPSE, NOT LASER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I gather from your March 4 article entitled "Mitsubishi Calls Iacocca Promos 
Just Sour Grapes" (that) Lee Iacocca can't seem to understand why car buyers 
prefer the Mitsubishi Eclipse to its sister car, the Plymouth Laser. He states 
that except for the nameplates, the cars are identical, so buying the Japanese 
version is "not right." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps I can enlighten him a shade. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, I thoroughly compared both the Eclipse and its twin, the Laser. In 
the turbocharged versions, the two cars are not identical. The Eclipse came 
standard with a deeper front air dam and a functional rear spoiler that 
stabilizes high-speed performance and gives the car a more aggressive, sportier 
overall look. The Laser lacked these additions. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, I later bought the Eclipse but would have been happy to buy 
the Laser had it come with these additions. 
</P>
<P>
I fear the same situation will befall Iacocca when the new Dodge Stealth and 
Mitsubishi 3000 GT come out this fall. Although mechanically identical, the 
Mitsubishi version benefits from a slightly sleeker, more integrated-looking 
body. Unfortunately, I believe these small differences will sway many potential 
Dodge buyers to the Mitsubishi version. 
</P>
<P>
Iacocca has to learn -- the small details do count.

BOOK RAPS IDEA THAT SMALL BUSINESS IS BEAUTIFUL; 
</P>
<P>
COMPANIES: AUTHORS SAY LARGE FIRMS OFFER HIGHER WAGES, BETTER BENEFITS AND MORE 
JOB SECURITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTORIA SHANNON, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 1980s venerated the small company as lean and mean -- the engine of the 
economy and the backbone of the business world. Small business was seen as a 
nest for creative, happy workers, a wellspring of new jobs and the birthplace 
of innovation. 
</P>
<P>
Here come the '90s. A new book due out in June bashes those notions and argues 
that, rather than "small is beautiful," small is, on average, not very pretty 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
Large companies -- those with more than 500 employees -- offer higher wages, 
better benefits and more job security, the authors say. Large and small 
companies appear not to differ much in the amount of training they give their 
employees, and job satisfaction apparently isn't dependent on company size. 
</P>
<P>
And the notion that small firms create the jobs that fuel the economy is a 
myth, the authors maintain. 
</P>
<P>
James L. Medoff, a Harvard University economics professor and co-author of 
"Employers Large and Small," to be published by Harvard University Press, said 
the positive image of small companies comes from Americans' ingrained distrust 
of any large organization. 
</P>
<P>
"We are really a Populist society," Medoff said in an interview. "We have come 
to believe that anything small is good." 
</P>
<P>
But in business, he argued, the positive image of "small" has given the 
small-business-owner lobby so much power that the small-business employee 
suffers. 
</P>
<P>
"There are two American work forces," he said. "One is the 50% of the labor 
force that is employed by large companies. It is treated well, and the 
government watches over it. The other (small-company employees) is not watched 
over at all." 
</P>
<P>
The aim of the book -- co-authored by Charles Brown of the University of 
Michigan and James T. Hamilton, a Harvard teaching fellow -- is to present 
evidence that public policy favors the large-company employee. 
</P>
<P>
"Good policy should be impervious to size," Medoff said. "If unsafe working 
conditions are no good, they're no good for everybody, and small companies 
shouldn't be exempted." 
</P>
<P>
One powerful illustration of the small-business punch was last fall's repeal of 
Section 89, a part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 addressing company benefits. 
Some businesses might have had taxes imposed on their benefits; businesses with 
fewer than 20 employees would have been required to offer a health plan to all 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
Groups such as the Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of 
Independent Business banded together, pulled out all the stops and insisted on 
unconditional victory on Capitol Hill. In the end, the benefits-tax law 
remained unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
The research of Medoff and his colleagues paints an unflattering picture of 
small companies: 
</P>
<P>
*Job creation: The oft-quoted statistic is that small business is responsible 
for eight out of every 10 new jobs. Medoff looks at the creation rate of those 
jobs as well as their duration. Small Business Administration data does indeed 
show that small business was responsible for more than its share of current 
jobs: 63.5% of the total in 1980-86 and 59.7% in 1976-82. 
</P>
<P>
But the book argues that a more accurate way of looking at the numbers is to 
look at industries: The jobs are actually coming from industries -- such as 
consulting, financial services, real estate and health care -- that are 
dominated by small companies. 
</P>
<P>
Industries in which 60% or more of the workers are employed by small business 
-- about half of private-sector employment -- accounted for 85% of the increase 
in net employment in 1981-86, according to SBA figures. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, when the economy grew, certain industries were stimulated, and 
small businesses in those industries rode the wave of job growth. 
</P>
<P>
Small-company jobs also are less likely to remain in the economy, Medoff said. 
Employment in small firms that existed in 1981 declined by about 10% over the 
next four years, while employment in large firms existing in 1981 remained 
essentially unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Employment has shifted toward industries dominated by smaller firms. At the 
same time, it has shifted away from small firms in those industries. So, Medoff 
said, a policy favorable to small business is not necessarily going to generate 
new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
* Working conditions: Although confessing that solid data is hard to come by, 
Medoff and his colleagues conclude there is a slight increase in pay associated 
with working at a large location-"the exact opposite of what one would expect 
if larger workplaces had inferior working conditions." 
</P>
<P>
Citing length of time in a job as evidence of job satisfaction, Medoff said 
Labor Department surveys show that those working for large companies are less 
likely to change their employer. There also appears to be more internal job 
movement among workers of large firms. 
</P>
<P>
* Salary: Large employers offer much higher wages than smaller ones. The 
average wage of workers in large firms was 35% higher than their counterparts 
in small firms, according to 1983 Bureau of Labor Statistics figures. 
</P>
<P>
Many explanations are possible for the existence of such a pay gap, Medoff 
said. It could be because larger establishments require higher levels of skill 
or training.

ENROLLMENT IS THE PRIZE IN PRESCHOOL WAITING GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
It's spring, and many Orange County parents' thoughts turn to camping. 
Overnight. On the sidewalk. In front of some of the most coveted preschools in 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
This is registration time for the schools, and parents are willing to go to 
extremes to assure that their youngsters take the proper first step toward a 
quality education. 
</P>
<P>
"If you do it for a house, you should do it for your kid as well," said Bob 
Ludovise, a businessman from Laguna Niguel who spent an evening in a sleeping 
bag outside the shared campus of Children's Choice preschool and McDowell 
Elementary School in Laguna Niguel to assure getting his child enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the problem stems from an extreme shortage of child care in South 
Orange County, where the population of young families has mushroomed in recent 
years. The Children's Home Society of California reported 4,218 requests for 
child care from South County in 1989 -- and 1,000 to 1,500 openings. 
</P>
<P>
But lines outside preschools crop up throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a nightmare," said Vickie Vega, who finally registered her child 
at Children's Choice preschool this year after paying fees at two other 
preschools just in case. "There are a lot of dual-income families down here. 
The need is such, families are doing whatever they have to to be sure their 
children are enrolled in schools." 
</P>
<P>
Each spring, Children's Choice director Sandra Senn issues numbers to waiting 
parents and keeps bathrooms open all night. 
</P>
<P>
After working late one night before registration, she said, she tried to open 
the door to leave, but found it blocked at 8 p.m. by a sleeping parent. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, she said, some parents replaced her procedure sign with one of their 
own and issued new numbers. A brawl broke out between two fathers when they 
found that they both had No. 1, she said. So Senn decided to hire security 
guards to keep the peace during the overnight vigil. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Woods of Laguna Hills said she was in the hospital having her second 
child March 8 while her husband, Gary, stood in line at Children's Choice to 
register their kindergartner. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, (the director) told everyone not to come before 7. I thought 
everyone would think they'd be there by 6," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Arriving at 5:30 a.m., her husband was first in line to register their 
5-year-old for three mornings a week, two hours each. 
</P>
<P>
At the Fullerton United Methodist Preschool, where families have camped out for 
the past 10 years, director Barbara Beasley said it is sometimes hard to tell 
the parents from the homeless who also sleep on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, I saw a vagrant on the stoop and said, 'You'll have to move on.' It 
was Mr. Knudsen, one of the church leaders, trying to get his child in." 
</P>
<P>
Her registration will be held this year in April. 
</P>
<P>
But particularly among schools in the fast-growing South County, camp-outs for 
school registration have become as commonplace as they are for opening days for 
selling new tract homes. 
</P>
<P>
One father installed himself in the sanctuary of Church of the Master in 
Mission Viejo at 4:30 p.m. last year to be the first in line for the next 
morning's preschool registration. "The mom said he had a better night's sleep 
then she did," director Marsha Cowper said. "She worried about it all night. 
</P>
<P>
"They bring their TVs, their record players, they ordered pizza that year. They 
all seem very happy. It's very strange." 
</P>
<P>
Parents will sometimes take turns in line. "One mom came and brought her son 
when the dad left to go to work," she said. "The dad said, 'Boy, I hope you 
understand what I gave up for you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Like other directors, Cowper has seen the camp-outs begin earlier and earlier 
as word spreads among parents. 
</P>
<P>
Senn of Children's Choice called it "psychological group hysteria." 
</P>
<P>
Parents, she said, "spread the word: You'd better get there early." 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that development was exacerbating the day-care problem in South 
County, the Orange County Board of Supervisors has stipulated that South County 
builders either contribute to a day-care fund or provide child care in their 
projects. This year, $60,000 from the fund was distributed among seven 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
But so far, the money has apparently done little to alleviate the crunch. To 
the day-care directors, it looks like more of the same. 
</P>
<P>
From the Church of the Master Preschool, Cowper can see more houses sprouting 
on the rolling hillsides like wildflowers. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be no place for these families," she said. "There are not enough 
preschools to accommodate the people who will live in these houses." 
</P>
<P>
Other high-demand schools that do not have camp-outs say the first-come, 
first-serve situation can be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
"I call from the waiting list, and people come in," said Gretchen Schoren, 
director of St. John's Preschool in Rancho Santa Margarita. "I don't have them 
all come and register in one day. I think it's dramatics." 
</P>
<P>
Having parents camp out at your school "gets to be kind of a status symbol," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Senn of Children's Choice said she had considered using a lottery system but 
rejected it as unfair: "I don't like to give a number to a human being. Maybe 
if it's an object, like a house. But I don't think a human being should be 
treated randomly like a number. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year, we try to rack our brains for a better system. I just shake my 
head."

SIMMONS BATTLES 'RAIDER' LABEL IN BID FOR LOCKHEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harold C. Simmons is trying to take control of Lockheed Corp., the aerospace 
giant based in Calabasas, but he doesn't like being called a "takeover 
specialist." 
</P>
<P>
"I am not a takeover specialist," he said, responding at a recent New York news 
conference to a question that characterized him as a corporate raider. "I am a 
builder of companies." 
</P>
<P>
The distinction is crucial. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, high-yield, high-risk junk bonds have been used to finance 
many corporate takeovers, but with the growing unpopularity of the bonds in the 
past year, many outsiders trying to seize control of big companies have had to 
find other methods. Simmons has chosen to go the way of the proxy fight. 
</P>
<P>
And that means that he must persuade a majority of the shareholders that he is 
not an enemy -- not a raider -- and that he and his colleagues can run Lockheed 
better and more profitably than its present managers. The results will be 
announced Thursday at the company's annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Before then, the Texas financier hopes to emphasize another image: that of a 
master strategist who develops the companies that he acquires. The effort is a 
key part of his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons' rejection of the "raider" label at the New York news conference was 
also revealing because he did not -- at that moment -- support his assertion 
with details of his business record or his management philosophy. In fact, 
Simmons appeared ill at ease. He is, by his own admission, shy in the 
spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
He professes to be comfortable in boardrooms and in one-on-one chats with 
individual reporters. He acknowledged during a recent interview: "I've had 
stage fright in the past, and I still have it. . . . I don't like to make 
speeches, and I (generally) don't accept speaking engagements because I'm not a 
good speaker." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On the Road 
</P>
<P>
But despite his discomfort, he clearly recognizes the need to woo shareholders 
and has hit the road to meet Wall Street analysts and Lockheed's institutional 
investors. Much depends on his ability to perform effectively in the larger 
forums, gatherings of pension fund managers and other holders of large blocks 
of Lockheed stock. 
</P>
<P>
"This (campaigning) is certainly different," Simmons said in the interview. "I 
didn't expect to be doing this and I don't like it." 
</P>
<P>
The question-and-answer sessions at the shareholder meetings present 
opportunities for Simmons to both score and stumble. He has a history of 
controversy over things that he has done and said -- things he says were 
misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
There are lawsuits and financial failures in Simmons' past, but the companies 
that he now controls have generally performed well, many Wall Street analysts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
The Simmons empire is vast. He has either a controlling interest or 100% 
ownership in 17 companies, 13 of them incorporated. It is a diverse dominion 
that includes firms offering products as varied as furniture and roast beef 
sandwiches, wire fencing and oil field services. 
</P>
<P>
The Simmons corporate collection is of Byzantine complexity and is better 
understood when charted on paper. Simply put, all of his companies are owned or 
controlled by Contran Corp., which is 100% owned by a family trust that Simmons 
controls. The trust is the treasure chest of his empire. 
</P>
<P>
The major jewel is a Dallas-based holding company called Valhi Inc., under 
whose umbrella are seven companies. Among them are Amalgamated Sugar Co.; 
Baroid Corp., an oil field services firm, and NL Industries, a Houston-based 
chemical company. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the value of the Simmons trust's holdings has been pegged at $1.9 
billion, making him one of the nation's wealthiest people, according to a 1989 
Forbes magazine survey. He has five homes, including a 24-acre estate in 
Montecito, near Santa Barbara, that he bought from actor Gene Hackman. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons, 58, was brought up in extremely modest circumstances. He first became 
well-known by borrowing to acquire a chain of drugstores in Texas in the 1960s 
and establishing himself in the insurance business. He lost much of his wealth 
in a series of financial reversals and legal entanglements in the 1970s, then 
rebounded by making big gains in the stock market and by acquiring and 
retaining control of a number of companies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Humble Beginnings 
</P>
<P>
Recognition of his success is important to Simmons. The inadvertent omission of 
his name from one annual listing of billionaires in Forbes magazine prompted 
Simmons to protest with dry humor in a letter to the magazine's editor: 
</P>
<P>
"Since your last issue about billionaires omitted my name, I have been 
embarrassingly besieged by calls from my friends wanting to know what financial 
catastrophe has befallen me." 
</P>
<P>
Simmons is clearly proud of his climb up the financial ladder. The rise is 
chronicled in biographical material he has had prepared. It describes his 
upbringing by his parents, both grade school teachers, in a home without indoor 
plumbing in tiny, rural Golden, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of Golden's old-timers remember Harold as the shy Simmons boy who was 
thoughtful and mentally quick," the biography states. 
</P>
<P>
At another point it says: "His success in acquiring companies and investing are 
legendary." 
</P>
<P>
But before that legend began to grow, Simmons had his troubles. Borrowing 
heavily in the 1960s, he built a chain of 100 drugstores in Texas, then sold 
the chain to another drugstore group, Jack Eckerd Corp., for $50 million in 
Eckerd stock in 1973. Under the agreement, he was prohibited from selling the 
stock for one year. 
</P>
<P>
The value of the stock plunged to about $14 million in 1974, leaving him in 
dire straits. His banks even canceled his credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
At about the same time, state investigators accused him of looting and 
bankrupting his two Texas insurance companies, and he was hauled into court. 
Then he was indicted by a federal grand jury in Chicago on charges of mail and 
securities fraud in connection with the collapse of his Illinois insurance 
company. The courts found in his favor in all three cases, but there were 
millions of dollars in losses and legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons now says he borrowed too heavily during that period. 
</P>
<P>
The experience "made me more conscious of how much I borrow, the terms under 
which I borrow and what I borrow for," he said. "It helped my self-confidence 
to come through bad times." 
</P>
<P>
Simmons brought himself back to financial health by playing the market, 
successfully buying and selling stock in a variety of industries for large 
profits. More recently, the Valhi holding company has been Simmons' principal 
profit vehicle. It announced a 20% increase in earnings in 1989. Net income for 
1989 was a record $103.4 million on revenue of $2.4 billion, compared to the 
previous record of $85.9 million on revenue of $2.3 billion in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Valhi owns 66% of Houston-based NL Industries, one of the world's largest 
producers of additives used in paints, inks, adhesives and cosmetics. Simmons 
acquired the controlling interest in NL for Valhi in a hostile takeover in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proxy Challenge 
</P>
<P>
Now NL has become Simmons' vehicle for his effort to gain control of Lockheed. 
The chemical company owns 18.9% of Lockheed's stock, the largest stake in the 
aerospace firm. 
</P>
<P>
Although Simmons had been buying and selling significant amounts of Lockheed 
stock for about a year, NL did not officially launch its proxy challenge until 
March 12. Simmons had indicated that he would mount the attack in January, when 
Lockheed refused to allow NL to place six representatives on Lockheed's board. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons had demanded representation on the board after Lockheed reported a 
decline in earnings in 1989. Lockheed, citing losses associated with cost 
overruns on fixed-price Defense Department contracts, posted earnings of $2 
million on sales of $9.9 billion, compared to a profit of $624 million on sales 
of $10.4 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons has contrasted the performance of NL Industries with that of Lockheed, 
noting that NL's stock price has more than doubled since 1986, when he gained 
control, while Lockheed's stock price has dropped about $15 since last April. 
He is also quick to cite earnings reports that show NL's 1989 profit of $172.9 
million on sales of about $1 billion, compared to a $162.9-million profit on 
sales of about $1 billion in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed has responded by raising questions about Simmons' ability, intentions 
and integrity. For example, in a March 5 letter to shareholders, the company 
noted that Simmons was "found by a court to have violated his fiduciary duties" 
in his handling of the pension fund at Keystone Consolidated Industries, a 
Dallas-based steel and wire-fence maker that he controls. 
</P>
<P>
Keystone had been experiencing financial losses and difficulties in keeping its 
pension fund adequately funded before Simmons acquired the company in the early 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The case involved shifts of assets Simmons made between Keystone's pension fund 
and other Simmons companies. In 1983 and 1984, he moved about $15 million in 
real estate assets from his other companies into the pension fund and used $15 
million of the pension fund money to help finance his takeover of Amalgamated 
Sugar. The court frowned on the moves because federal regulations stipulate 
that all contributions to pension funds are to be made in cash or guaranteed 
assets like government bonds. They also require that those who control assets 
belonging to others act solely for the benefit of pension plan members and not 
in their own interest. 
</P>
<P>
However, the court also found that Simmons' violation was not willful and that 
the shifts were "good faith" actions involving sound business judgment. Under 
terms of a settlement with the court in 1985, Simmons admitted no wrongdoing 
and was enjoined from violating any other provisions of federal pension fund 
law for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Simmons Defended 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Simmons has claimed that if the court had not reversed the asset 
shifts, the pension fund would have benefited substantially because the value 
of the real estate increased. 
</P>
<P>
Many associates -- former Keystone Chairman J. Walter Tucker, for example -- 
defend Simmons, saying that Keystone's performance has improved under his 
guidance. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker said Simmons' backing of a decision to modernize a mill in Peoria, Ill., 
was significant. With more efficient plant facilities, Keystone recorded 
earnings of about $12 million in 1989, he said. Ironically, however, mechanical 
problems associated with the mill, which was completed in March, 1988, 
contributed to a $24-million loss at Keystone that year, according to the 
company's annual report. 
</P>
<P>
Other Simmons associates note two successful spinoffs by Simmons companies. 
</P>
<P>
Keycon, once a unit of Keystone, was converted into a separate company in 1984 
and later placed under the Valhi umbrella. A 1989 Forbes survey of corporate 
spinoffs found that, of the companies studied, Keycon stock experienced the 
greatest increase in value between 1984 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The other example involves oil field services operations that were part of NL 
Industries until a December, 1988, spinoff, when the business was reconstituted 
as a separate firm called Baroid Corp. Since the spinoff, Baroid shares have 
also increased in value. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons has been citing his successes in talks to groups of financial analysts 
and institutional investors around the country. However, in many forums, he 
allows NL Industries President J. Landis Martin, who seems more comfortable in 
the limelight, to do most of the talking. 
</P>
<P>
Standing stiffly and speaking in his rapid-fire Texas accent, Simmons recently 
told investors in New York that Lockheed had erred by diversifying too heavily 
away from its "core" business of defense and aerospace contracting. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not allow investments to linger in areas that do not give an adequate 
return," Simmons said. "We know how to deploy our capital. . . . We do that 
better than Lockheed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lingering Controversy 
</P>
<P>
However, Lockheed's managers have said the company's diversified operations are 
producing acceptable profits, contending that Simmons doesn't understand 
Lockheed. They defend as wise their moves to increase the proportion of 
Lockheed's revenues that come from non-defense sectors, pointing to the 
declining Pentagon budget. 
</P>
<P>
They have also raised questions about Simmons' intentions, suggesting that he 
might sell off valuable Lockheed operations. Lockheed executives have described 
their operations as interdependent, saying certain units rely on the technology 
and expertise of others to develop products and attract business. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what he (Simmons) plans to do," Lockheed Chairman Daniel M. 
Tellep said in a recent interview. "If someone started breaking it (Lockheed) 
up . . . parts couldn't help each other. Any split-up diminishes the value of 
the whole." 
</P>
<P>
Simmons says he has boosted the value of his companies by eliminating 
"under-performing" units. He insists that he would put certain Lockheed 
operations on the block only if he were unable to make them more profitable. 
And he bristles at any implication that he buys companies just to make 
quick-and-easy profits by selling off parts. 
</P>
<P>
He is still haunted by a controversy over remarks that he made in an Oct. 6 
interview published in the Woodland Hills-based Daily News. According to the 
report, Simmons said he hoped to sell his shares in Lockheed and had been 
feigning interest in taking over the company to mislead arbitragers Such 
speculators buy stock of takeover targets, driving up the price and hoping to 
profit from the increase. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to put out misinformation if you really want to buy something for a 
fair price," Simmons was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after publication of the article, Simmons said he made the remark 
in jest, an assertion that he continues to make. 
</P>
<P>
With staff to help him guard against mistakes and associates to encourage him, 
Simmons is out on the potentially hazardous public speaking circuit again. And 
he says he's encouraged by the response that he has received from Lockheed 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there's not much immediate gratification for Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to campaign," he said. "I do it reluctantly." 
</P>
<P>
But if the shy billionaire's effort succeeds on Thursday, it will all have been 
worth it.
