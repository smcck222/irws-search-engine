A PRAYER FOR OWEN MEANY BY JOHN IRVING (WILLIAM MORROW: $19.95; 560 PP.)

<P>
Years ago, Stan Freberg used to do a bit on radio about how in one specific way 
that medium was superior to television and movies; he would use sound and 
clever shifts of context showing how the radio could rely on the audience's 
powers of imagination to produce preposterous effects that could never be 
duplicated on television or film. I am reminded of this, reading John Irving's 
new novel, because much of what happens in it is quite preposterous and because 
Irving makes me believe it anyway, as if I had been sitting in a room listening 
to an adventure on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
The speaker in "A Prayer for Owen Meany" is a middle-aged virgin named John 
Wheelwright, who describes himself as being "doomed to remember a boy with a 
wrecked voice -- not because of his voice, or because he was the smallest 
person I ever knew, or even because he was the instrument of my mother's death, 
but because he is the reason I believe in God: I am a Christian because of Owen 
Meany." Wheelwright never explains quite why he became Owen Meany's best 
friend, and much of what he does tell us about him strains the limits of 
plausibility: For instance, Owen at 11 years old is so small that other 
children his age can easily lift him and "pass him back and forth, overhead." 
We are told that this is accomplished by both boys and girls and that the game 
is to do so while remaining seated. "Someone would get up, seize Owen, sit back 
down with him, pass him to the next person, who would pass him on, and so 
forth. Everyone could lift up Owen." 
</P>
<P>
A little later, we learn that this tiny person manages to hit a baseball in a 
Little League game with enough force to kill John Wheelwright's mother, who is 
described as standing nearer to third base than home plate. Now, anyone who has 
ever held a baseball or thrown one knows that a child so small that he can be 
held overhead from a sitting position by other children, could not hit a 
baseball with enough velocity to do the damage that Owen Meany's batted ball 
does, even if it hits the victim on the temple: The ball, hard as it is, is too 
light to cause anything but a little bump at that distance, even if it is hit 
on the fat part of the bat. If Bob Feller pitches it, and Ted Williams hits it, 
it could kill someone standing at third base. Yet the whole novel is predicated 
on that fateful batted ball, and everything else about the character of Owen 
Meany comes from this one outlandish incident. 
</P>
<P>
We read on because something in the urgency of John Wheelwright's voice compels 
us to, and as the story unfolds, through the last 30 years of America's 
complicated and troubled history, a pattern emerges, a sense of some impending 
revelation grows. 
</P>
<P>
On the way, of course, even with the sonorous undertones of the prose, there's 
plenty of Irving's slapstick comedy -- the action taking place at a New 
Hampshire prep school called Gravesend Academy. We witness a hilariously 
botched Christmas pageant -- which also provides certain clues as to the 
novel's real subject. And, as is typical of Irving, there's a large cast of 
quirky, and sometimes absurd characters engaged in several different mysteries, 
concerning Wheelwright, his dead mother, and Owen Meany. 
</P>
<P>
Wheelwright is in search of his father's identity, and in a way is also on a 
quest to find out what sort of person his mother really was; Owen Meany is 
vouchsafed a vision while playing the Ghost of the Future in the Christmas Eve 
performance of "A Christmas Carol" by the Gravesend Academy Players, and John 
Wheelwright must also try to solve the mystery of what that vision was. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, Owen Meany progresses toward some dreamed of moment, which is 
revealed in hints and clues and faint suggestions, and which gradually achieves 
the force and inevitability of the fated moment in Greek tragedy. The twists of 
plot, the coincidences, the accidents along the way, are Dickensian in scope, 
and because Irving is a novelist whose models are the great practitioners of 
the novel in the 19th Century, this big book seems quite like his others: 
roomy, intelligent, exhilarating and darkly comic, with leisurely -- almost 
luxurious -- pacing, and a fulsome portrayal of places and people; a large 
canvas, and a complicated chain of uncannily connected events. 
</P>
<P>
Yet while all of these things are true of "A Prayer for Owen Meany," there is 
something else happening, too -- something quite stunning, and very ambitious. 
"Many things the Gods achieve beyond our judgment," says one of the Gravesend 
Academy Players during a performance of "The Medea." "What we thought is not 
confirmed and what we thought not God contrives." These lines from Euripides 
could very well be the central expression of "A Prayer for Owen Meany." 
</P>
<P>
It would be unfair to give away the novel's secrets in a review, but all the 
preposterous elements of the story add up to a question of belief. We arrive, 
finally, at the most preposterous of all stories, the story of Christ. "Lord, I 
believe," says the father of the possessed son in the passage from Mark, "Help 
thou my unbelief." 
</P>
<P>
And so while I began this review by talking about the cocky radio voice giving 
forth fanciful and imaginary stunts of magic and deceit, the magic of "A Prayer 
for Owen Meany" is that it forces us into a confrontation with our own 
carapaces of skepticism: We come to the realization that Irving, in this big, 
complicated, richly absurd creation, has given us a religious novel, a book 
that challenges the modern sensibility, the complacent assumptions of 
secularism, and the bastions of doubt. It is a brave and subtly disturbing 
affirmation of faith, and it is all the more remarkable for its engagement with 
the deepest questions, the most painful mysteries of our lives.

EASY DOES IT, BOSS LADY; 
</P>
<P>
TENDER POWER BY SHERRY SUIB COHEN (ADDISON-WESLEY: $15.95; 224 PP.; 
0-201-09242-5) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Nel Noddings, Noddings is author of Caring: A Feminine Approach to Ethics 
and Moral Education (University of California Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sherry Cohen has written a book that should be inspiring to women and men 
alike. Her major point is that tenderness and concern for relationships -- 
traits historically associated with women -- need not be drawbacks in business 
or professional life. Rather, Cohen says, tenderness is in corporate 
leadership, in entrepreneurial ventures, in the professions, in home life, in 
relationships. 
</P>
<P>
She tells marvelous and touching stories about the nurturing qualities of women 
in business: Ruth Hendler (Barbie and Ken dolls), Polly Bergen (ups and downs 
in cosmetics and jewelry), Mary Cunningham (The Nurturing Network), and a host 
of others. In all of these anecdotes, Cohen emphasizes the power of tenderness. 
Here are women, in all sorts of enterprises, attributing their success to the 
very qualities they had been told to forsake if they wanted to make it in the 
rough world of business. 
</P>
<P>
Many anecdotes are deeply touching, and a few are funny in a bitter way. Among 
the former, the story of Martha Bridges stands out. Abandoned by her husband at 
53, Martha feared becoming a "basket case": 
</P>
<P>
One day, Martha remembers, she stood helplessly near the sink in her own 
kitchen filled with tears and fears, surrounded by her daughters and her own 
87-year-old mother. 
</P>
<P>
The old woman planted her hands on her frail hips and confronted Martha. 
</P>
<P>
"I am of pioneer stock," said the 87-year-old, "and so are you. You will pull 
yourself together. These girls and I will not let you fall, or fail. We are 
connected." 
</P>
<P>
This story illustrates a strength and weakness in "Tender Power." The stories 
are moving and inspiring, but they tend to overplay the rosy side. Not all 
women have strong old mothers to offer support. Some have lost their mothers, 
some grieve over sick or mentally incapacitated mothers, and some suffer lives 
with mothers who were never supportive. It can be very hard to draw on tender 
power if you are the one who has to forge all the connections, give all the 
tenderness, maintain all the relations. Further, tenderness sometimes fails and 
sometimes invites exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
One of the bitter-funny stories could also be a downer, but Cohen uses it to 
emphasize how much wiser women are today than they were a few years ago about 
their female friendships: 
</P>
<P>
That was the era that Lily Tomlin remembers when she tells of the man who 
approached a woman having cocktails with three women friends. "Hey, baby," he 
said, "what are you doing here alone?" 
</P>
<P>
Cohen is right to celebrate the strength of female relationships, but she says 
too little about the lack of recognition granted to these relationships by 
either men or women. She admits that there is a recent troubling trend among 
business women to neglect one-on-one work friendships, and she deplores the 
common advice to women to adopt male modes of friendship, but she fails to 
analyze the situation of most professional women -- that most of our colleagues 
are male. The scene that Tomlin described is not totally a thing of the past. 
Women gathered together are still often seen as "alone" -- that is, as 
peripheral to what is really going on. 
</P>
<P>
No academic could say the things Cohen says in "Tender Power." First, even 
though hundreds of male writers have attributed tender and nurturing qualities 
to women (good women, that is), any academic who claims such traits for women 
is immediately challenged as unfairly excluding men from the community of 
careers. Worse, we are accused of maintaining a stereotype to make ourselves 
look morally superior to men. 
</P>
<P>
Second, some feminists raise a similar yet opposite objection. The stereotype 
was used to keep women in subordinate positions and states of passive 
resignation. If we now glorify traits historically associated with women, we 
run the risk of endorsing the exploitation of women. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind. Cohen's message is cogent. It will ring true to many women and to 
some men as well. It is high time for all of us to reconsider what really 
matters in life and how we can help each other to achieve it. Tenderness may 
not guarantee success, but serious attention to it can induce a redefinition of 
success. That's important and may lead a lot of readers to do just that.

RIVER ETERNAL 
</P>
<P>
by Lance Kinseth 
</P>
<P>
(Viking: $16.95; 117 pp.) 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly searching for a Walden safely secluded from urbiculture, naturalist 
authors of the baby boom generation tend to be "allergic to what we write 
about," as Gary Nabhan put it, even "distrustful of the forest, or any other 
wilderness, as a place to live," as Annie Dillard has confessed. Like earlier 
generations of the city-weary, they view nature as reinvigorating, a feeling 
Lance Kinseth eloquently captures when portraying the "wild, splitting and 
fusing" terrain of a river. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike their parents' generation, however, they also view nature as a source of 
spiritual inspiration, an alternative value system to institutions such as 
politics and religion. The purity of nature seems to offer an appealing 
contrast to the perceived "impurity" of these institutions; the 
interconnectedness of nature, in turn, seems to comfort the feelings of social 
alienation so common among baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
While generally an underlying theme in the new nature writing, this spiritual 
quest is the explicit focus of "River Eternal." Kinseth offers some eloquent 
depictions of wilderness, but his river is essentially metaphorical: "In all 
landscapes there is that powerful commonness that holds the world together. It 
is river eternal, the streaming beyond appearances, the inseparability that 
makes one thing also the other, that is nothing but cooperation and 
fittedness." 
</P>
<P>
Kinseth's writing is highly ambitious ("I am going to fly so deep inside the 
dance of a river that your everyday may be changed forever") and as such 
suffers from the problems, as the late naturalist Edward Abbey put it, of 
"gushing about finding God in every bush." Kinseth's sentences sound 
impressive, but their meaning is often muddled ("There is a rivering of sorts . 
. . in the astro-ecology of galaxies") and their metaphors often mixed: "My 
eyes have been sealed up in my head and used sparingly, as razors, to cut the 
landscape apart or to plug a gap in the wall of my thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Also confused is Kinseth's philosophy, which celebrates just the kind of 
relativism that has riled conservatives in recent years: "Nothing is 
important," Kinseth writes, "and nothing is unimportant." Kinseth tries to cast 
a positive light on this conclusion, which is based on his belief that nature 
can be experienced but never understood, by contending that "such a perception 
facilitates a view beyond the limits of time and the narrow three dimensions of 
space." It is more likely, however, that this outlook, increasingly common 
among baby boomers, will only limit our faith in human perception and in any 
knowledge that endures. 
</P>
<P>
WORDSTRUCK 
</P>
<P>
by Robert MacNeil 
</P>
<P>
(Viking: $18.95; 230 pp.) 
</P>
<P>
 In an era when teen-agers dissent by crying, "Gag me with a spoon!" and 
leaders inspire by invoking "the vision thing," one might expect to sense an 
elegiac quality in this deeply felt tribute to the power of the English 
language, "the collective memory of our culture . . . the living DNA, if you 
like, of our race." In "Wordstruck," however, Robert MacNeil actually presents 
a spirited defense of such expressions, contending that they are as valid a 
contribution to the language as "the tortured image of the academic, or the 
line the poet sweats over for a week." "Our language is not the special private 
property of the language police, or grammarians, or teachers, or even great 
writers," MacNeil writes, arguing persuasively that purists often discourage 
pleasure in the language in the name of saving it. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on his own advice that writers can better assure language's livelihood 
by inspiring rather than castigating, MacNeil describes how literature 
intensified his moods and clarified his thoughts when he was a boy growing up 
during the Depression. He remembers, for instance, the way Hamlet's words, "How 
weary, stale, flat and unprofitable / seem to me all the uses of this world," 
exquisitely portrayed the "enervating mood" and "painful-delicious" despairs he 
felt as a 17-year-old: "Never before had there been such instant connection 
between something I felt and words to describe it." 
</P>
<P>
One need not be a snob such as Allan Bloom to lament the fact that today's 
17-year-olds do not feel as viscerally connected to the language. MacNeil seems 
to underestimate the danger of their apathy: "It is all English," he writes, 
"and it belongs to everyone -- to those of us who wish to be careful with it 
and those who don't care." One suspects, however, that MacNeil is merely 
playing down his criticism to avoid tying the tongues of teen-agers, for toward 
public officials who can take the heat, he is unsparing: "The United States was 
founded on words that weighed heavily, words that carried the deepest 
convictions of thoughtful, daring men, (but) politics, the law, advertising, 
religion have become the art of employing words to cover for the moment, to get 
you off the hook, to win a verdict, pass a test, fill a space, get rid of a 
question."

<P>
FORCED OUT 
</P>
<P>
The Agony of 
</P>
<P>
the Refugee in Our Time 
</P>
<P>
edited by Carole Kismaric; 
</P>
<P>
introduction by William Shawcross 
</P>
<P>
(Random House: $19.95; 193 pp.) 
</P>
<P>
 The plight of the people graphically portrayed here is especially tragic 
because most of them are not "refugees" at all according to the editor's 
definition: "A person who has . . . a well-founded fear of persecution upon 
returning (home) on account of race, religion, political opinion or membership 
in a particular social group." Were these people in fact able to draw strength 
and purpose from a political cause or from practicing traditions in solidarity, 
their "marching, stopping, marching," as William Shawcross writes in the 
introduction, "sailing, landing, sailing; shuttling, pausing, shuffling," might 
sparkle with the glint of defiance. These first-person accounts and full-page 
photos clearly show, however, that these people are too absorbed in a 
day-to-day struggle for survival to build a liberating social or political 
identity. A photo here of a Nicaraguan woman wondering whether to accept money 
from Contra soldiers after giving them food shows not a person deliberating 
between "liberty" and "socialism," for example, but an anxious mother trying to 
decide which course will best ensure her children's survival. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the misleading definition of "refugee," the design of "Forced Out" 
seems to recognize that these people are apolitical victims. Integrating 
photographs and stories from various regions and cultures, it encourages us to 
see the common bond, for instance, between an Ethiopian photographed on one 
page who had been forced to flee from his farm ("I left before my harvest. They 
would have taken it anyway") and a Vietnamese grandmother and refugee pictured 
on the facing page. 
</P>
<P>
Shawcross more explicitly recognizes that these people are pawns rather than 
dissidents, pawns not only of their home nations, he writes provocatively, but 
of the superpowers. "In the last decades of the 20th Century, while the nuclear 
rivalry of the superpowers has kept war out of one traditional battleground -- 
Europe -- proxy wars or surrogate conflicts have been fought all over other 
parts of the world in the pursuit of that same rivalry." Refugees are often the 
victims of these wars, Shawcross writes; they are "a commodity to be traded for 
political ends." 
</P>
<P>
Reading these accounts of cannibalism on a Vietnamese boat and viewing pictures 
of dozens of outstretched hands almost undoubtedly will give readers 
"compassion fatigue," a condition Shawcross names and then denigrates, for it 
is the reason "today's cause becomes tomorrow's bore." It is unfortunate that 
Shawcross and the editor dismiss this feeling so quickly, however, for it could 
have been mitigated had the editor focused on practical solutions as well as 
problems. "Forced Out" is, nevertheless, an extraordinarily powerful book, 
ingeniously designed to bring immediacy to worlds we too often like to think of 
as far away.

IDEAS AND INFORMATION

<P>
Managing in a High-Tech World 
</P>
<P>
by Arno Penzias 
</P>
<P>
(W. W. Norton: $17.95; 219 pp.) 
</P>
<P>
 In sharp contrast to the predictions of sociologists such as Barbara Garson 
and Shoshana Zuboff that information technology will transform society, Arno 
Penzias, Bell Labs' vice president of research and ever the pragmatic engineer, 
contends that people most likely will use new advances in computers and 
communications to "cushion against impending disruption" rather than to bring 
about dramatic change.

<TEXT>
<P>
Dear Sir: We haven't met but my father knew you 
</P>
<P>
and spoke of you often, implying an intimacy 
</P>
<P>
on which I perhaps presume. Soon now I too 
</P>
<P>
must make a more formal visit, just as he 
</P>
<P>
knocked, seemingly sure of being received. 
</P>
<P>
I enclose a book I have written. It's mostly questions 
</P>
<P>
he, perhaps, could answer. He once believed 
</P>
<P>
we might communicate. Are there provisions? 
</P>
<P>
If so, would you pass it on to him? If not, 
</P>
<P>
I beg you to forgive the intrusion. We 
</P>
<P>
are uncertain of the protocol. The thought, 
</P>
<P>
whatever the form, is all of courtesy, 
</P>
<P>
and in the hope of hearing from him again. 
</P>
<P>
Till which, with your permission, I remain 
</P>
<P>
etc., and for a while his son 
</P>
<P>
and in some sense I suppose yours also --

<P>
John.

The third of "Four Poems," published in the fall, 1988, issue of the literary 
quarterly New Letters, 5216 Rockhill Road, Kansas City, Mo. 64110. Miller 
Williams, who was John Ciardi's close friend and publisher is now literary 
executor of the estate, writes by way of preface: "When John Ciardi died on 
Easter Sunday, 1986, he left thousands of pages of poetry in manuscript. Two 
years of reading and sorting have been rewarded by a surprising number of 
finished poems, a selection from which will be published the week of Easter, 
1989, by the University of Arkansas Press. Among these, the most lyrical and 
moving of any Ciardi wrote, are four about the God the poet quarreled with for 
most of his life, wondering, complaining, loving, and denying. If some irony is 
found in Ciardi's Easter death, it takes on a touching rightness in the light 
of these poems."

If the A. C. Nielsen Co. had phoned me on March 12 to ask what TV program I was 
watching, I would have been too embarrassed to admit it was "The People's 
Choice Awards." And yet I sat -- benumbed by its self-serving pomposity -- 
through two hours of pre-announced and pre-taped winners; interminable 
thank-you speeches (at one point there were 11 "acceptees" on stage); and, of 
course, the usual endless program plugs and commercials. The only interesting 
sidelight to the entire fiasco was that CBS had the guts to present what turned 
out to be a running promo for ABC's "Roseanne" and NBC's "The Cosby Show."

<P>
In her insightful introduction to "The Book of Fantasy," Ursula K. Le Guin 
reflects on how fantasy today has become a business. One need only to visit the 
nearest bookstore-in-a-mall to see that this is so. Rows upon rows of gaudily 
packaged "fantasy" paperbacks are there to be consumerized. 
</P>
<P>
What is disconcerting is their turgid sameness. Their covers and texts would 
suggest that fantasy is primarily concerned with semi-nude barbarians and 
Amazons who are forever slaying each other with glowing swords. There are 
certainly some exceptions, but most current fiction parading as fantasy 
displays a paucity of imagination that is deadening to the soul. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, "The Book of Fantasy" provides a woodshed of tales, parables and 
fragments to rekindle the fire of our imagination. Borges and his friends have 
plucked paradoxes from the mists of ancient centuries, gathered tales of whimsy 
and revenge from the more discernible past, while adding modern stories of both 
apocalyptic dread and persistent hope. They have harvested these works from 
nearly every era and continent on Earth. Though the scope of their differences 
is enormous, they all share a special capacity to invite the reader to expand 
his world by challenging the static perceptions of reality. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the intrinsic charm of this anthology stems from its unusual inception. 
Although published now for the first time in English, it is no 
hastily-thrown-together product of some publisher's desire to capitalize on a 
fashionable trend. Rather its birth was on a rare evening in Buenos Aires, in 
1937, when Jorge Luis Borges, Silvina Ocampo and A. Bioy Casares, three friends 
with literate and discerning minds, had the simple but pure idea to bring 
together a volume of fantasy based solely on what they liked best. 
</P>
<P>
One cannot help but wonder how they arrived at their choices. Was there much 
argument? Why did they select Nathaniel Hawthorne's "Earth's Holocaust," an 
oddly expository parable about the world's population divesting itself of all 
institutional and intellectual trappings by throwing virtually everything, 
including books, into a giant conflagration? Surely one of them must have 
pointed out the superiority of Hawthorne's darkly alluring "Rappaccini's 
Daughter." Perhaps they thought it was too commonly known. 
</P>
<P>
It is easier to imagine them all eagerly assenting to Max Beerbohm's "Enoch 
Soames." This masterpiece of cynical humor about a frustrated writer who sells 
his soul to the devil for a chance to check out his literary reputation 100 
years hence is a wonderfully welcome old friend. For those readers who remember 
it only as through a high school assignment dimly, its caustically precise 
dissection of artistic vanity is a joy to re-behold. 
</P>
<P>
Their decision to open the volume with "Sennin" by the Japanese writer, 
Ryunosuke Akutagawa, was inspired. "Sennin" is a beautiful fable that 
demonstrates how the power of true belief, no matter how bizarre, can conquer 
the forces of those who accept nothing that reaches beyond the barriers of 
small-minded reality. An enchanting tale, it also aids the reader joyfully to 
embrace the suspension of disbelief that he needs to fully explore the 
labyrinths in the pages just ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Here are tales of fantastic joy, terror and fear, satire and irony, and 
ugliness and beauty. Classics of horror such as W. W. Jacobs' "The Monkey's 
Paw" are juxtaposed with the ephemeral brevity of A. A. Ireland's six-line 
"Ending for a Ghost Story." The former drenches one in dread, while the latter 
clears the palate with a draught of delight. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, a few more contemporary pieces have been added. The most 
successful of these is J. G. Ballard's "The Drowned Giant." This bitter, yet 
superbly crafted tale tells of the brutal fate that a giant's corpse suffers at 
the hands of callous humanity after it is washed up on an ocean beach. With 
this story alone, Ballard may lay claim to the misanthropic mantle of Jonathan 
Swift. 
</P>
<P>
Borges and his colleagues have yoked together such disparate geniuses as Franz 
Kafka and Lord Dunsany; Chaung Tzu and Edgar Allan Poe; Oscar Wilde and Borges 
himself. Somehow, they all fit. 
</P>
<P>
"The Book of Fantasy" is one of those marvelous volumes that are not meant to 
be read at a gallop. Rather, each story should be savored and mulled over, 
discussed and argued about in front of a winter fire or on the back porch on a 
hot mid-summer's day. This book should be passed around from friend to friend, 
from parent to child, from lover to lover. It is a book of true fantasy and 
therefore filled with the wonder of boundless thought.

THE EXORCISM OF A PRE-RUMPOLE DEMON; 
</P>
<P>
LIKE MEN BETRAYED BY JOHN MORTIMER (VIKING: $16.95; 208 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Clancy Sigal, Sigal teaches at USC's Journalism School. Author of several 
novels, including Going Away, he divides his time between London and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Mortimer is best known as creator of that lovable British TV series 
"Rumpole of the Bailey," which has become a virtual one-man industry including 
plays and six books of Rumpole stories. In English interviews and TV 
appearances, Mortimer's plump, cheerful persona positivley overflows with a 
sort of liberal bonhomie. He is living proof that much food and good wine 
needn't blunt your most obvious energies. 
</P>
<P>
But what about the more obscure demons? They're to be found in "Like Men 
Betrayed," a short novel originally published here in 1953 and now reissued 
presumably to cash in on Mortimer's TV fame. It's a bad novel, overwritten, 
mechanically fatalistic, its prose at once stilted and exhausted. Curious, 
this. It's as if Mortimer had reversed the usual writer's passage, from 
youthful exuberance to elderly resignation. But a good writer's mistakes are 
often instructive for a reader who, like myself, has sometimes wished that his 
author, famed for his good temper, might just occasionally kick the cat for no 
particular reason. 
</P>
<P>
There's plenty of that in "Like Men Betrayed." Christopher Kennet is an 
agreeably dull, stoically inhibited solicitor in a bad marriage with a hating 
wife and a crooked son, Kit. Until Kit embezzles some money from one of his 
father's clients, Kennet's life is grayly predictable. "In Kennet, a type of 
middle-class Englishman had, in a sense, reached its culmination. The brutality 
and cunning that had brought the Kennets' original wealth had been refined and 
educated away." Mortimer admires, even loves, this "man of moderate sensuality 
who kept his head." I suspect that Kennet, here understood and unworked-out, 
later found his way into a less advertised part of the character of the 
lawyer-philosopher Rumpole. 
</P>
<P>
When Kit disappears into the London underworld -- described unconvincingly as 
if taken from old Dirk Bogarde movies -- Kennet searches for his son. The 
exploration shakes him out of himself, into an affair with a younger woman, and 
finally to a grisly end. Julian Symons has called this book "one of the great 
forgotten novels of the '50s." A generous view, that. Charitably this is a 
thriller that reads like a first draft for a Grahame Greene "entertainment." A 
more skilled hand might have turned it into a sympathetic study of the darker 
side of the England that we still insist on seeing as quaint and "civilized." 
There's a raw hatred of people here, a bleak loathing of all things English, 
which Mortimer has refined over the years into something more polished and 
bright. Of course we prefer Rumpole; I know I do. But I wonder if Mortimer 
might yet circle back on himself to do something with the snarling, resentful 
demon he exorcised -- or not? -- such a long time ago.

THE CHILDREN'S BOOKSHELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLYN MEYER, Wild Rover, Meyer's newest book for teen-agers, will be 
published by Macmillan in the fall. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whether you're talking clothes, cars, or kids' books, it pays to go classic and 
choose something that will wear well. Among the near-score of new books for 
children and adolescents that recently crossed my desk, several pass the test; 
many more fail. 
</P>
<P>
If you can buy only one children's book this year, consider The Random House 
Book of Humor for Children, a fat and satisfying collection of 34 funny 
stories, selected by Pamela Pollack and enhanced with warm pencil drawings by 
Paul O. Zelinsky. There are chunks from books by kids' favorites like Beverly 
Cleary ("Ramona"), Louise Fitzhugh ("Harriet the Spy"), and Judy Blume as well 
as pieces by humorists such as Garrison Keillor, Delia Ephron, and James 
Thurber. The time line runs from the 19th Century (Twain and Kipling) through 
this decade without ever seeming dated. Aimed at middle-graders, the collection 
should appeal to a wide age range. Furthermore, it fills the definition of 
"classic" at a great price: It works out to about 44 cents a story. 
</P>
<P>
Picture books for younger children must be more than merely eye-catching, but 
sometimes captivating illustrations are sabotaged by a weak text. A "classic" 
calls for a balance between story and pictures -- like Marcia Sewall's 
jewel-bright illustrations and Roni Schotter's imaginative prose in Captain 
Snap and the Children of Vinegar Lane, the story of the misunderstood 
misanthrope who is teased by the neighborhood children and ultimately rescued 
by them. 
</P>
<P>
What a letdown, then, in the case of Warm and Cold, in which acclaimed 
playwright David Mamet collaborated with artist Donald Sultan. With that pair 
of powerhouse names on the jacket, you'd have a right to expect more than 14 
oversize pages with acres of white space and some dashed-off drawings to 
illustrate 29 miserly lines of "poetry." My understanding of the poem is at 
odds with both the flap copy and a still different summary on the copyright 
page. Give this one a big black-and-white zero and save your money. 
</P>
<P>
If the Mamet-Sultan book was designed to appeal to minimalists, World of 
Wonders: A Trip Through Numbers is packaged for more-must-be-better. Numbers 
from 1 to 12 are illustrated in a series of large, bright photographs by Starr 
Ockenga, crammed with dozens of toys and tiny objects, somehow related. Lines 
of poetry by Eileen Doolittle do little to enlighten, although the last pages 
of the book provide a numbered key to each photograph. 
</P>
<P>
Two pen-and-ink Mutt and Jeff characters are walking down a hill toward the 
water. "What's a simile?" one asks the other as they climb into twin wooden 
boats and sail off to explore a land where everything exists in the form of a 
simile, "a figure of speech as clever as zippers, as fresh as a peach" and 
often as familiar as your own hand. This is the premise of a witty and unlikely 
book called As: A Surfeit of Similes by Norton Juster, author of "The Phantom 
Tollbooth." Ingenious drawings by David Small manage to combine strings of 
rhyming but otherwise unrelated similes into pictures that carry the two 
characters through a series of visual adventures before they sail away, asking: 
"Now, what is a surfeit?" This is a book to be read aloud for the sheer fun of 
it -- and to stimulate readers to play with language and invent similes of 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
The Ballad of Wilbur and the Moose by John Stadler is the kind of unpretentious 
nonsense that kids love. The zany adventures of a pint-sized cowboy named 
Wilbur, who drinks lime juice, rides a big blue moose called Alvin, and herds 
pigs for a living, are related in rollicking rhyme with goofy pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Cats with wings? Winged cats who decide to fly back from their home in the 
country to visit their dear mother in the city dumpster where they were born 
and reared? Well, why not? If anyone could pull off such an idea, Ursula K. Le 
Guin, renowned writer of fantasy, could -- and does in Catwings Return. The 
gentle story of the cats' journey, their rescue of a winged kitten in a 
condemned building, and finally the discovery of their mother in her new life 
is illustrated with S. D. Schindler's drawings, delicate as aqua-tints. This 
small gem could become a favorite of children aged 7 to 10 and lead them to its 
predecessor, "Catwings," by the same author and illustrator. 
</P>
<P>
It's a challenge to steer kids over 12 to books you'd like them to read -- like 
Come the Morning by Mark Jonathan Harris, a novel that successfully tackles a 
tough subject: homelessness. Ben Gibson is 13 when his father leaves the family 
in El Paso, Tex., and heads for Los Angeles, named "for the angels who watch 
over your dreams." But dreams turn into nightmares when Ben and his mother, 
younger brother and sister take a bus to Los Angeles in search of their father. 
Money runs out fast, and the Gibsons are caught in a downward spiral of misery 
that takes them from filthy flophouses and dehumanizing shelters to the terror 
of the streets. The story is told with gritty realism that does allow a glimmer 
of hope -- but not much more than that -- at the end. Harris is to be applauded 
for his effort; he doesn't flinch, although the reader will. And should. 
</P>
<P>
The Arizona Kid by Ron Koertge is a realistic treatment of another difficult 
subject -- sexuality. Billy, an overprotected kid from a hick town in Missouri, 
learns a lot about life during the summer he spends in Tucson, working at a 
racetrack. But Billy's life isn't totally centered on horses. There's his gay 
uncle, Wes, and Wes' friends. And then there's Cara Mae, who does things with 
Billy that parents hope their teen-age daughters and sons won't do -- at least 
not yet. The subject is handled with humor and good taste, although the 
language is straightforward (that is to say, rough in spots). Teen-agers will 
enjoy the book, but not all parents will approve.

Photo, "So Diamond sat down again and took the baby in his lap." The Books of 
Wonder series from William Morrow has just reissued George MacDonald's classic 
fairy tale "At the Back of the North Wind' ($17.95; 352 pp.; age 10 and up) -- 
the story of a little boy, Diamond, and the North Wind, personified as a 
dark-haired mysterious woman. MacDonald, a close friend of Charles Dodgson 
(Lewis Carroll), published his allegory about a child and the wind in 1871, 
Peter Glassman tells us in an afterword to the new edition, a facsimile of the 
1919 American edition. Both J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis, Glassman adds, 
cite MacDonald as a major influence in their writings. Though MacDonald is 
unmistakably Victorian, his "combination of compelling fantasy with powerful 
moral allegory" makes his work "a striking departure from the work of his 
predecessors and has enabled it to remain a beloved classic of children's 
literature for over a century."

FOR YOUNG ADULTS: THE INVISIBLE ADOLESCENT; 
</P>
<P>
FADE BY ROBERT CORMIER (DELACORTE: $15.95; 310 PP.); 
</P>
<P>
THE MERMAID SUMMER BY MOLLIE HUNTER (HARPER &amp; ROW: $12.95; 119 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kristiana Gregory, Gregory reviews regularly for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First off, I loved "Fade." Couldn't put it down. There's no question that 
Robert Cormier is an exquisite, tight writer, as proven in his celebrated "The 
Chocolate War" (1974) and now, in this fantasy that Delacorte Press is 
marketing for age 12 and up. It is, however, twice as long as the average young 
adult book and there are passages that will make some parents jump from their 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
"Fade" is not for kids. 
</P>
<P>
During the summer of 1938 in Frenchtown, Canada, 13-year-old Paul discovers 
that he has the power to become invisible. What fun, he at first thinks: He can 
avenge the town bully, play tricks on people or, better yet, observe private 
lives. Unfortunately, Paul's spying unveils "dark and nasty secrets it was 
better not to know about(.)" He is so horrified by the unnatural sexual acts he 
witnesses (described clearly), his "Catcher-in-the-Rye" innocence is lost. 
After he stabs a villain to death, he vows never again to turn invisible. Thus 
ends the novel's first half. 
</P>
<P>
Now flash to 1988. Susan has just finished reading "Fade," a final manuscript 
of the now-deceased Paul, the world-famous writer who was also her cousin. 
Susan and Paul's literary agent are trying to decide if "Fade" is truth or 
fiction, and if it is truth, how utterly incredible. Cormier's novel now moves 
back and forth between Susan's narration, Paul's, and Paul's nephew, 
13-year-old Ozzie who has inherited the fade. 
</P>
<P>
The destruction and bloody deeds unleashed by Ozzie are unsettling, partly 
because the reader is vicariously involved, another testimony to Cormier's 
skill. But most of all, it's frightening to think what an unhappy adolescent -- 
or any of us for that matter -- would do if no one could see us. Cormier seems 
to be saying that we have dual natures and depending on who's watching us, two 
faces. 
</P>
<P>
My disappointment is not with the author, but with a publisher who misleads its 
audience. "Young Adult" is very much different than "Mature, Almost Adult." 
</P>
<P>
"The Mermaid Summer" (ages 8-12) should be read aloud in front of a warm stone 
hearth by someone with a Scottish burr. Set in a fishing village during the 
1800s, the story tells of "a mermaid who ruled the cold, wild sea that washes 
around northern lands." She is a cruel mistress who lures boats onto rocks and 
blackmails the townsfolk with her power. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Anderson so fears for his life that he leaves the village to work aboard 
an oceangoing ship, far away from the creature's spell. After three years at 
sea, his grandchildren, Anna and Jon, ages 12 and 13, decide the only way 
they'll ever see him again is if they trick the mermaid. If they can tame her, 
then it will be safe for Granda Eric to return. By ingenuity, bravery and a 
little help from the town medicine woman, the two kids succeed in doing what no 
one had ever done before. 
</P>
<P>
Mollie Hunter unwinds her tale as spontaneously as a village storyteller. 
Suspense builds perfectly. As one of Scotland's foremost writers for young 
people, she shares the rhythm and language of her countryfolk so well.

SCIENCE AND HOMOSEXUALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I found some of the implications in Judd Marmor's review of Kenneth Lewes' 
"Psychoanalytic Theory of Male Homosexuality" (Book Review, Feb. 19) as 
interesting as the review itself. Science should not be a hostage to politics 
or the public taste. The question of whether or not homosexuality is to be 
regarded as a psychiatric disorder should be left to scientists unmoved by 
picketing and political acts of those who disagree with the classification. 
Edmund Bergler's quoted statements do generalize from the particular and are 
intemperate. However, his point was that homosexuality, impotence, and 
frigidity were counterfeit sex: Sexual behavior used to express and disguise 
other non-sexual needs and drives. Modern psychotherapy recognizes that the 
symptom not only expresses an internal conflict, but also communicates a social 
statement. Marmor wishes to ignore that possible social message by implying 
that homosexuals are "born that way" due to biochemistry. Any message of 
rebellion against a heterosexual society or family is then erased. More than 
this, Marmor defends homosexuals by implying that their sexual object is not 
chosen by homosexuals as a preference or an existential option, rather, they 
are victims of conditions in utero, which determine their wants and behavior. 
He thereby acknowledges that homosexuals would be heterosexual if they could. 
He denies a psychiatric disorder to arrive at a biological disorder without 
recognizing his own bias that homosexuality is a dysfunction of the sexual 
drive.

Wow! I'm impressed! While on my routine odyssey through the Sunday paper, as is 
somewhat usual, I found that turning to a new page brought me face-to-face with 
yet another saturnine story of bad news. But as I perused the Book Review 
section, I flipped to a series of reviews titled "Children's Bookshelf" by Mark 
Harris (Book Review, Feb. 26). Harris wrote a wonderful summary of five 
children's books and showed how the notable themes of each story go together, 
leaving the reader with only one thought in mind -- "Our children need to be 
exposed to more educational books like these!" 
</P>
<P>
I read about the books now available for children with a hint of envy. We 
adults are constantly being blessed with the privilege of reading, and hearing, 
about AIDS, gun control, terrorism, etc., etc. Considering how readily our 
children are exposed to our Draconian world, these are stories I certainly 
wouldn't want my children to grow up reading and worrying about. I found 
Harris' review to be a reminder that there still are authors who almost 
miraculously continue to write jovial, hate-free stories for our children. 
Wouldn't it be great if we could one day pick up a newspaper and read nothing 
but stories of an Elysian quality? Well, next time don't skip over the 
children's reviews. It's important to keep up with what our children are 
reading, and who knows, we may even learn something from the simple goodness of 
children's books.

Here I am again, after all these years, 25 or 30 of them, taking pen in hand to 
tell you of what it was like when I was young and lived in Africa. Although it 
has been so long, I can still see myself there, still close my eyes and see the 
way that it was: the wind whipping across the plain, the rows of hunters going 
in front of me to comb the brush, the stars twinkling in that darkest of skies 
that is Africa's. 
</P>
<P>
All of these things are there for me when I shut my eyes. 
</P>
<P>
When I was a child, I spent my days with the Kakewpie, hunting naked in the 
bush or in the rain forests of the Galstosee. We would hunt all day, and then I 
would return home and my mother would make me a big bowl of Campbell's Country 
Vegetable Soup. 
</P>
<P>
When I was a child, I hunted all the time. At first I had a hard time hunting 
the swift capped langur and the cunning red-capped mangabey, but my friends 
among the Kakewpie were very kind and patient with me. I remember the first day 
I went hunting with them. Nobody had told me that we were all going to be 
naked, and I showed up in absolutely the worst thing: a midnight rose silk 
T-shirt, cotton/polyester Lycra spandex shorts and some Reeboks. I looked 
around at everybody else and I could have died. But the Kakewpie, all naked and 
smiling, didn't even laugh at me. They were too kind, those Kakewpie, if that's 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
"Why do you dress like that?" one Kakewpie asked. "Your head is filled with 
dawn-fog today, is that it?" 
</P>
<P>
Maybe my head was filled with dawn-fog that day, but I was young and I soon 
learned. Lycra spandex was for holy days, not hunting days. 
</P>
<P>
There were so many things to hunt: muntjac, chousingha, ibex, dik-dik, gayal, 
bushback, ree-ja-mo, klipspringer, cerothere, bharal, chevrotain, oryx, 
blesbok, eland, geese, ducks, cows. There were so many things to hunt. There 
were even some big furry-looking things, but I don't know what they were. 
</P>
<P>
And there was Thompson's gazelle. And sometimes Thompson, but usually only on 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
And, after a long day of hunting all of these things, Dad would drive me home 
in the wagon with all of the bumper stickers. And I'd try to get a rock-format 
station on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
When Dad picked me up, I'd wave goodby and call out to my Kakewpie friends out 
the window. 
</P>
<P>
I'd wave like crazy. 
</P>
<P>
"Goodby, Karkoweel!" 
</P>
<P>
"Goodby, Kokobeaner!" 
</P>
<P>
And they'd call back. 
</P>
<P>
"Goodby, Dawn-fog head!" 
</P>
<P>
"Goodby, Skill-ball head!" 
</P>
<P>
After a day like that, I'd always fall sleep in front of the TV, no matter what 
was on. 
</P>
<P>
There was a place called Mustachandbeard, and I used to ride to it on horseback 
or sometimes Dad would let me take the Plymouth Horizon. And there was an old 
man there whom I got very close to on several occasions. He would tell me about 
the Gogowiplash and the Mojomen, and the great leaders of the past and the 
great priests and magicians that had once lived there. He would tell me about 
Mount Moonyou and the mountain of beasts, Lizardlandthemepark. 
</P>
<P>
I would sit for hours listening to the old man and his stories of how things 
had been before they put up the mall. And later, when I returned to my home and 
family, I would find myself sitting quietly and thinking while I watched a 
couple of videos of what the old man had said. 
</P>
<P>
One day the old man and I were out at Mustachandbeard watching some cape 
buffalo rut. The old man turned to me, and I guess I'll always remember what he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Cape Buffalo are better than most men. They rut better, for instance." 
</P>
<P>
He was a very wise old man. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, I remember leaving Africa. I got out of the taxi at the airport, and 
the wise old man, who was riding with me, helped me with my luggage. I looked 
around me. To the west I saw the Notmysister Hills, their majestic peaks 
seeming to support the very sky. To the east I saw the awesome sight of Mount 
Liquidpaper. It was so far away that I couldn't remember how big it really was. 
It was like a still, blue cloud, or something. Like my memories of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Then I thought, (expletive deleted), I forgot my hair dryer.

PAINFUL WORDS ON AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Do the editors of Book Review or reviewer Arthur Kleinman begin to realize the 
pain that has been caused to thousands of your readers who are HIV Positive or 
have ARC/AIDS, by the excessively descriptive review of "AIDS and Its 
Metaphors" by Susan Sontag (Book Review, Feb. 26)? 
</P>
<P>
While many people with AIDS are carrying on a close to normal life, imagine you 
are one who is housebound and The Times is one of your important links to the 
outside. You read the review and the words and phrases used or quoted tear into 
your emotions: "Terrifying new disease," "epitome of evil," "alienating 
repulsive taint of deadly sin," "degrading pain," "terminates in the 
preparation for death," all hang in your mind. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS patients will not analyze the philosophic content. They will hear only the 
words, added to the other words that have been aimed at them. 
</P>
<P>
The agony of those in pain is far more important than fuzzy political rhetoric 
of either author or reviewer. The review could have been done in a factual 
manner without hurtful pejorative phrases being used. That way, only those who 
bought the book would be hurt. 
</P>
<P>
I am a "straight" WASP woman with five children. I don't have AIDS, except in 
the way that we now all have this disease. . . . "Is it nothing to you, all ye 
who pass by?"

Someone tell Littwin that there is no such thing as "reverse sexism." You're

I am very sorry that Littwin has met with such negative experiences; they can 
happen to anyone, of either sex. I might lend her the same advice that I lent 
to someone else who complained to me about the crowded conditions at our health 
club: "If you'd really like to see something done about the crowds here, why 
don't you go home?"

As a typical middle-aged male, I have been aware for years that Littwin and her 
colleagues consider men like me offensive, and I have attempted to conduct my 
efforts toward physical fitness furtively under the cover of darkness and baggy 
sweat clothes. However, I had always thought that my lack of coordination, 
excessive perspiration and general insensitivity were due to my own failings as 
a human being. Little did I realize they were, as Littwin says, a matter of 
hormones, specifically a lack of estrogen.

Littwin is miserable in class and should do herself a favor and take private 
dance lessons, where she will not be distracted to critique other members of 
her class. The fact that she allows a locker key pinned to the shorts of 
another class member to irritate her underscores her pettiness. Unlike Littwin, 
not everyone who attends aerobics classes thinks he is perfect. Many of us 
attend for cardiovascular exercise to improve as well as to maintain our 
stamina and coordination. A group workout offers everyone a higher level of 
enthusiasm, spirit -- and fun.

Since Littwin believes that aerobics is part of the feminine domain and that 
men are intruders in it, I'll be perfectly willing to stay out of her aerobics 
classes if she and her friends will stay away from the weights and other 
exercise equipment at the gym.

PATRICK TERRAIL CAN'T GO HOME AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S A HOTEL, IT'S A RESTAURANT, IT'S MA MAISON -- AND IT'S CHANGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH REICHL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ma Maison, 8555 Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles. (213) 655-1991. Open for lunch and 
dinner Monday-Saturday. Full bar. Valet parking. All major credit cards 
accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $60-$85. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Movie remembers Ma Maison. That's the restaurant where he couldn't get any 
respect. "They'd look at my Pontiac as if it had a disease," he says 
vehemently, "and then they'd give me the worst table in the house." 
</P>
<P>
In the five years since Ma Maison closed, Mr. Movie has come up in the world. 
He now expects the best of everything. If Ma Maison were still a little place 
on Melrose where the fancy cars were parked out front, his Jaguar would 
probably get a prized position. He himself would indubitably rate a top table. 
But the new Ma Maison is housed in a hotel, and Mr. Movie isn't sure that this 
is where he wants to be. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody who was anybody ate at the old Ma Maison," he says. Then he adds 
disparagingly, "This one is filled with agents from ICM." He looks around the 
room seeking out pockets of power. Nothing catches his eye. He leans over 
conspiratorially. "You know what the really hot restaurant in town is these 
days?" he asks. "Forget Morton's. Forget Spago. The place to go is Il Giardino. 
It's where you go when you don't want to be seen. But of course everybody's 
there, so everybody sees you. That's the point." 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Movie would like everybody to see him at Ma Maison. But everybody seems to 
have moved on. His eyes sweep the room, taking in what is one of the loveliest 
new places in Los Angeles. "It's like a fantastically comfortable greenhouse," 
says Mr. Movie, looking out the windows to the vines that are growing quickly 
in a valiant effort to block out Beverly Boulevard. He looks up at the 
skylight, which actually opens. "It's a lot classier than the old place," he 
muses, noting that the rug, although still green, is not Astroturf. Flowered 
prints and pink cloths are draped across the tables; plants and flowers are 
everywhere you look. Waiters glide smoothly past, bearing trays topped with 
silver domes. People look happy. 
</P>
<P>
"There's only one thing wrong," says Mr. Movie. "All the people who aren't 
agents look like they're from out of town." 
</P>
<P>
Just then he brightens up. He tugs on his little ponytail, straightens his 
shoulders. What has he seen? I turn. Rod Stewart is walking toward us with a 
date. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe Ma Maison can be forever young," says Mr. Movie, taking his eyes off the 
room and grabbing a handful of the thin little smoked salmon sandwiches that 
the waiter has deposited on the table as an amuse-gueule. "These are terrific." 
he says. The presence of a celebrity probably improves the flavor, but these 
little tidbits don't need any help. "Wouldn't it be wonderful if Patrick 
Terrail had actually managed to bring back Ma Maison?" says Mr. Movie 
wistfully. He wants it to be just like the old place -- only this time he will 
be the one Patrick Terrail escorts past envious eyes to the best table in the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
"He can make you feel so important," says Mr. Movie as Patrick Terrail comes 
over and proceeds to do just that. Terrail chats us up, gossips a little, sends 
over a whole plate of smoked salmon. "We make it every day," he says proudly, 
and indeed this is fine silky stuff. Mr. Movie sips his wine and starts to 
relax. Patrick Terrail adjusts the flower in his buttonhole and moves on to the 
next table, turning to say in his gravelly voice, "Have the escargots in baked 
potato. It's my favorite dish." 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Movie has the snails. He likes them. And no wonder. Unlike your ordinary 
escargots, these come snuggled into a crisp, briefly fried baked potato so that 
there is something to soak up the sauce. Mr. Movie eats every last drop, then 
devours most of the plateau of fresh oysters his date has ordered. He tastes a 
salad, says it's good, overlooking the fact that it has far too much dressing 
-- and far too much salt. Now he turns his attention to my flourless ravioli. 
"What is that stuff?" he asks, "It looks just like regular ravioli." 
</P>
<P>
I taste it. "They've used thin slices of turnip instead of pasta," I say. It's 
a clever idea. Unfortunately, the filling between the slices of turnip is goat 
cheese embellished with too many herbs, so that the overwhelming impression is 
far from subtle. Subtlety, however, is lost on Mr. Movie; he is looking very 
hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
At least until the entrees arrive. And then, try as he might, Mr. Movie is not 
impressed. "This duck is gray and dried out," he says, looking down at his own 
plate where slices of duck are surrounded by sauteed apples and leaden little 
corn pancakes, all drowned in a heavy brown Calvados sauce. "I thought it'd be 
rare and pink." 
</P>
<P>
I point out that his date's liver in raspberry vinaigrette sauce is very nice, 
but Mr. Movie has no intention of eating liver. I'm also pleased with a thin 
steak served with a huge pile of French fries in the best French bistro 
tradition. I think it's the best thing on the menu; Mr. Movie thinks it's a 
bore. "I didn't come to a fancy restaurant to eat steak and fries," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen prides itself on fish, offering a large and varied selection every 
day. Today we try a nice piece of Norwegian salmon perched on a bed of spinach 
and bathed in a peppery grapefruit sauce. It would be a fine dish if only the 
fish were considerably less cooked. In fact, the fish have been overcooked 
every time I've tried them. Some of the preparations -- salmon in sorrel sauce, 
yellowtail in a tropical salsa, sole meuniere -- would have been wonderful had 
the fish spent less time in the pan. But even when I specifically asked for 
undercooked fish, it came out dry and well done. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Movie isn't all that interested in fish. But he does have a problem with 
the plates. "There's too much on them," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, while the kitchen is to be commended for its imaginative use of 
vegetables -- each entree is garnished in a different manner -- the plates have 
a saucey, messy, overfilled look. "It looks like hotel food," says Mr. Movie. 
He has a point. 
</P>
<P>
But dessert is arriving, and Mr. Movie is amused. His profiteroles arrive in a 
frosted pink swan that looks like it belongs at an 8-year-old's birthday party. 
"I'm not sure a sophisticated restaurant ought to be using these dishes," he 
says, "but the ladies who lunch must love them." He himself is in love with the 
chocolate sorbet. It is fantastic stuff -- like the most sophisticated 
Fudgesicle you can possibly imagine. "They ought to put it on sticks and sell 
it to go," says Mr. Movie, "I'd fill up my freezer." 
</P>
<P>
Now Patrick Terrail is back, offering Grappa, Framboise, Poire William. Mr. 
Movie sips on his icy, alcoholic drink and leans back in his seat. He casts a 
last hopeful glance around the room. Rod Stewart is still here. But he is the 
sole celebrity. "This place is pretty, but it just isn't the old Ma Maison," 
says Mr. Movie. "I guess that's gone forever." He brightens and adds, "But 
Patrick Terrail doesn't change, and he's back doing what he does best." 
</P>
<P>
And that, of course, makes Mr. Movie feel like a million bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Recommended dishes: smoked salmon, $9.95; snails in baked potato, $9.95; steak 
and French fries, $21.95; Norwegian salmon, $21.95; chocolate sorbet, $6.95.

REASON TO PARDON MA MAISON WINE LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When a restaurant offers perfect glassware and perfect service -- an extremely 
rare occurence -- the wine-loving patron is almost prepared to overlook 
problems with the wine list itself. 
</P>
<P>
At Ma Maison, glassware and service are near-perfect and these factors do help 
soothe feelings after seeing a wine list that is chosen more to impress wine 
connoisseurs than to provide good wine at fair prices. The prices, though not 
too high for the wines on a percentage basis, are still too much for the 
average patron. 
</P>
<P>
The list itself has the requisite choices -- fine white and red Burgundies, 
Rhones, a wide range of California wines -- and then adds some surprises. 
</P>
<P>
Among the serendipitous finds are Alsatian wines, an excellent Muscadet, a 
Cahors, and a handful of fairly old red wines (such as 1967 Chateau Haut-Brion 
at $165). 
</P>
<P>
However, pricing is high. Not that you expect any bargains at a place like Ma 
Maison, but by using a standard markup that is close to three times wholesale, 
the price of most wines is well above $30. 
</P>
<P>
The least expensive red wine, 1987 Saintsbury Garnet (listed as "Granit 
Vineyard"), is $21. The least expensive white is a simple Entre-Deux-Mers at 
$18. The least expensive sparkling wine is Louis Roederer nonvintage Brut at 
$37. I was not impressed by the house sparkling wine ($20), a Blanc de Blancs 
that tasted clumsy. 
</P>
<P>
This is a true French wine connoisseur's list and includes some names that only 
a wine maven would know (names like Durup, Dubreuil Fontaine, Leroy). There are 
also some names I am unfamiliar with and are not listed in my reference works. 
Moreover, the list has no Italian wines, no German wines, no Australian wines, 
and no wines from Oregon or Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The California list is unimaginative and the range of styles offered is 
limited. Also, there is no Zinfandel and just one Pinot Noir and one Merlot. 
</P>
<P>
However, the service we had was exceptional, knowledgeable and friendly. And 
the wine we ordered, a 1987 Beaujolais Villages from George Duboeuf ($22), was 
brought to the table at the proper cellar temperature. Then the waiter asked if 
we wanted it placed in an ice bucket for a slight chilling. 
</P>
<P>
The wine program is the work of Patrick Terrail, who has plans to improve the 
list. Today I'd term it a fine first effort. Knowing of plans by all six 
American Sofitel hotels to offer premium wine lists, I expect this one to 
improve.

NOTEBOOK: MICHAEL MCCARTY AND HIS PARTNER DIVVY THEIR STAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Adirondacks have stopped moving, the Rattlesnake isn't dead yet and 
Michael's is going to New York. There is big news, in other words, from Michael 
McCarty. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, McCarty, the high-profile Santa Monica restaurateur and his 
partner of four years, chef Jimmy Schmidt, have parted ways. The pair had 
opened three restaurants across the country -- the Rattlesnake Club in Denver 
in 1985; a second Rattlesnake in Detroit, where Schmidt had originally come to 
prominence as chef at the venerable London Chop House, last year; and what was 
originally to have been a third Rattlesnake, now known instead as Adirondacks, 
in Washington, D.C., in the early days of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
McCarty says that ever since the opening of the Detroit restaurant, he and 
Schmidt have been discussing the possibility of an amicable split. "Jimmy loves 
Detroit and they love him," McCarty says, "and he really likes running the 
restaurant there as a sort of one-man band. That's very different than the 
management style we've been using in Denver and Washington, where we delegate a 
lot of authority. So we decided to divvy things up so that Jimmy would own 100% 
of the restaurant in Detroit, and our management company would control the 
other two places." 
</P>
<P>
"Michael will be doing his own menus in Denver and D.C.," adds Schmidt, "and 
I'll do my own type of food here in Detroit. We're still good friends, and we 
had lots of fun together. We were just going in different directions, though." 
</P>
<P>
One of the things he is most looking forward to, Schmidt said, is 
re-establishing contacts with suppliers he used in his Chop House days, and 
using more and more regional products. 
</P>
<P>
McCarty and Schmidt had recently announced that they were changing the names of 
their Denver and Detroit restaurants to Adirondacks, to match the Washington 
establishment -- because, said McCarty at the time, "We don't serve rattlesnake 
and they're not private clubs." Now, he says, Schmidt will keep the Rattlesnake 
name for Detroit -- and the Denver restaurant will become Adirondacks, not this 
month as originally planned, but in early May. 
</P>
<P>
McCarty's other big news is that he has just bought a new restaurant location 
in New York City, on 55th Street and Fifth Avenue -- a space currently occupied 
by the Italian Pavilion, which he had originally expected to move into, he 
says, in September of 1980. He plans to open a Manhattan branch of his Santa 
Monica flagship restaurant, Michael's (which celebrates its tenth anniversary 
on April 22). 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he adds, he is spending the majority of his time working on the 
massive hotel and community center he plans to open in late 1991 on the site of 
the old Sand and Sea Club on the beach in Santa Monica. Plans to open further 
Adirondacks have been curtailed. "I have no time to do any other restaurants 
right now, " he says. 
</P>
<P>
DRIED SHRIMP AND PEANUT SAUCE PIZZA?: Shakey's Pizza Restaurants Inc., which 
was the first franchise pizza-parlor chain in America, has been purchased by 
Inno-Pacific Holdings, a company based in Singapore. All 221 domestic Shakey's 
units were included in the deal, whose terms have not been disclosed. 
Inno-Pacific has owned rights to Shakey's outside the United States since 
September. . . .

ON THE FIRE: Opera in Santa Monica resumes serving Sunday dinner next week, 
April 2, and will reopen for lunch soon. . . . The Radisson Plaza Hotel in 
Manhattan Beach hosts the second annual South Bay Free Clinic Gourmet Sampler

A TV-ERA MONSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I feel compelled to write after viewing only a few minutes of probably the most 
demented show on television, "Freddy's Nightmares." I am horrified our society 
has allowed TV to sensationalize and glorify suffering, perversion and 
mutilation. 
</P>
<P>
I truly enjoy the horror classics -- Frankenstein, the Wolfman, the Mummy. 
These movies left much to the imagination, yet still thrilled and chilled. 
</P>
<P>
Freddy is a psychotic mutilator who only fuels sick and misguided minds. It's 
time to draw the line. Today's children mustn't grow up thinking this is 
"normal." 
</P>
<P>
I hope that more people speak out against the programming on today's 
television. If the quality of programming doesn't improve soon, my children may 
end up the better for it because my television will be put out on the curb, in 
the trash, where it belongs.

ANOTHER NOMINATION

<TEXT>
<P>
I nominate "Rain Man's" producers and studio (United Artists) for best 
non-supporting performance of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The movie is about an autistic man. Great. And a big Beverly Hills benefit 
premiere was held. Wonderful; but wait: In an insensitive move, the premiere 
proceeds, more than $250,000, were given not to one of the severely underfunded 
efforts to unlock the mystery of autism but to a unrelated charity. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, nobody involved with the benefit recognized the irony or, if they 
did, they didn't care enough to correct it.

I have just finished seeing the five movies nominated for best picture in the 
Oscar race: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Working Girl," a piece of fluff with uninspired direction; 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Dangerous Liaisons," about people I care nothing about; 
</P>
<P>
 -- One truly good movie, "Mississippi Burning," which features a performance 
by a national treasure, Gene Hackman; 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Accidental Tourist," a lovely "little" picture that rates a 7; 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Rain Man" . . . Dustin Hoffman was good but I never forgot he was Dustin 
Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
Oh well, I shouldn't be too crabby: I've just seen, for the third time, my 
videotape of a great movie, better than anything in 1988. And the TV miniseries 
"Lonesome Dove" didn't cost me a nickel.

THREE MILE ISLAND; 
</P>
<P>
CONFLICTING REPORTS STOKED FEAR IN NUCLEAR ACCIDENT; 
</P>
<P>
CONFIDENCE IN AUTHORITIES EVAPORATED DURING CRUCIAL 7 DAYS OF DOUBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT DVORCHAK, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MIDDLETOWN, Pa. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By the fourth day of the Three Mile Island accident, a stream of conflicting 
statements was in full torrent. 
</P>
<P>
The power company was saying the crisis was over, but the company had lost its 
credibility. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission warned that a hydrogen bubble 
in the reactor was potentially explosive and blocked efforts to cool the 
uranium core. 
</P>
<P>
The NRC in Washington said the bubble could reach an inflammable stage within 
five days. 
</P>
<P>
NRC officials at the scene said that detonation would be impossible for at 
least nine days. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disjointed Information 
</P>
<P>
It took seven days to get a clear story from all involved. By the time the NRC 
confirmed that the hydrogen bubble was gone and gave a plain account of what 
had happened, everything that had gone before seemed disjointed. 
</P>
<P>
Scores of reporters, carrying radiation detection badges with their pads and 
pens, rushed the office of Gov. Dick Thornburgh. "They were no longer 
interested in the story. They feared for their own safety," Paul Critchlow, 
then an aide to the governor, recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters by trade are detached observers, but during the nation's worst 
commercial nuclear accident, they were as personally involved as the people who 
lived in the shadows of the huge, hourglass-shaped towers. 
</P>
<P>
The vanguard of a press invasion about 400 strong came from the state capital, 
Harrisburg, 10 miles away, where a new governor was in his 71st day of office 
and the Legislature was debating the sorry condition of the state's roads. 
</P>
<P>
Three Mile Island overwhelmed everyone. Reporters found themselves trying to 
cover a nightmare of confounding technology, contradictions, feverish emotions 
and limited access to information. 
</P>
<P>
The near-calamity lacked any visual evidence. There were no flames, funnel 
clouds, floodwaters or wreckage. The most popular photograph was of the huge, 
concrete cooling towers. Reporters had to learn quickly about the extremely 
complex workings of a nuclear-powered generator. 
</P>
<P>
At 4 a.m. on March 28, 1979 -- a Wednesday -- Three Mile Island was working 
like a giant tea kettle, producing steam for electricity from its reactor. Then 
a balky valve caused two pumps to shut off, halting a steam turbine and 
interrupting the chain reaction within the reactor. 
</P>
<P>
As 100 tons of uranium sizzled in the heat of decay, a pressure-relief valve 
opened and the emergency cooling system flooded the reactor with water. But the 
valve stuck and stayed open for two hours, draining vital coolant water and 
letting radiation escape into the air. 
</P>
<P>
The operators checked a faulty gauge and mistakenly shut off the emergency 
cooling system. The core was uncovered and the top half of it melted. A bubble 
of hydrogen formed. 
</P>
<P>
Still, no one had a clue as to what was going on. 
</P>
<P>
There was nothing in the operators' manuals about a bubble. It was as if they 
had been given history books to study for an algebra test. A computer used to 
measure core temperatures spit out only question marks, the machine's 
equivalent of scratching its head. 
</P>
<P>
The nuclear power industry, which touted its product as cleaner than coal and 
cheaper than oil, had bragged that such an accident could never happen. 
Metropolitan Edison Co., the plant's operator at the time, downplayed the 
gravity of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
The first word from Metropolitan Edison came from its headquarters in Reading, 
55 miles away. "There have been no recordings of any significant levels of 
radiation, and none are expected off site," Blaine Fabian, spokesman for the 
utility, said. 
</P>
<P>
At 11 a.m., Lt. Gov. William Scranton III told reporters: "Everything is under 
control." As he spoke, unknown to him or the reporters, radioactive steam was 
escaping from the plant. 
</P>
<P>
An angry Scranton returned at 4:30 p.m. to say: "Metropolitan Edison has been 
giving you and us conflicting information." 
</P>
<P>
Later, when he was asked why reporters had not been told about the leak, 
Metropolitan Edison Vice President Jack Herbein said: "They didn't ask." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rosy Statements 
</P>
<P>
The power company wasn't alone in making rosy statements. A Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission staffer said that the accident "wasn't close to a catastrophe." 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Metropolitan Edison President Walter Creitz said the plant had 
been safely shut down. In reality, it was still leaking radioactivity and 
remained stubbornly hot. 
</P>
<P>
All trust disintegrated with a new burst of radiation Friday, and the public 
was prompted to flee a nuclear accident for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Mothers left dishes in the sink and clothes in the washer after Thornburgh 
advised that pregnant women and young children should not remain within five 
miles of the plant. In Harrisburg, an unauthorized Civil Defense signal wailed 
eerily. 
</P>
<P>
"We are operating almost totally in the blind," NRC Chairman Joseph Hendrie 
said that morning. "It's like a couple of blind 
</P>
<P>
men staggering around making decisions." 
</P>
<P>
A reporter on the story could attend a Metropolitan Edison news conference at 
American Legion Post 594, head down the street to hear the NRC's report, then 
drive back to Harrisburg to get the state's version. 
</P>
<P>
At one of these antsy sessions, with reporters standing on chairs and shouting 
questions, Herbein said: "I don't know why we need to tell you each and every 
thing we do." 
</P>
<P>
Desperate for information, Gov. Thornburgh turned to President Jimmy Carter and 
the White House sent in Harold Denton of the NRC. Denton's Southern drawl and 
knowledge of reactors helped to soothe nerves. The White House also put a gag 
order on Metropolitan Edison, so that only one story would come out. On Sunday, 
President Carter visited the area to reassure a jumpy populace, while 
technicians worked to eliminate the bubble. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Metropolitan Edison said the bubble was gone. A company official 
had to repeat the news over the phone to four reporters before they felt 
comfortable with the information. On Tuesday, the NRC confirmed that the bubble 
was gone. Six days later, the agency declared the crisis to be over. 
</P>
<P>
There were interviews with jittery residents who had hung radiation detectors 
on their back yard shrubbery. 
</P>
<P>
In a quiet rural area where Amish farmers still use horses to pull plows, 
Middletown Mayor Robert Reid ordered the police to shoot looters. 
</P>
<P>
A church service in the Susquehanna River town of Goldsboro drew just four 
worshipers, along with a reporter and two photographers. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the salt and pepper shakers shaped liked the cooling towers, signs in 
stores of "We don't sell Pennsylvania milk," and weather jokes about it being 
partly cloudy with a 40% chance of survival. 
</P>
<P>
The swarm of out-of-town media found this note from the locals in the newsroom 
of the state Capitol: 
</P>
<P>
"If you must go out on the streets of Harrisburg and see they are dark and 
empty, this is not -- repeat, not -- because of the accident at Three Mile 
Island. That's the way they always are."

JUSTICE KAUFMAN PROVIDES THE LONG ARM OF THE LAW WITH A LOUD VOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB EGELKO, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reporters who got their first look at state Supreme Court Justice Marcus 
Kaufman giving a lawyer a verbal pounding during the court's hearing on 
Proposition 103 had a common question. 
</P>
<P>
Is he always like this? 
</P>
<P>
The answer: No, not always. But often. 
</P>
<P>
You usually don't need a score card to identify Kaufman at the court's oral 
arguments, or a microphone to hear him. 
</P>
<P>
About once in each monthly set of hearings, a large man with heavy features 
will start asking questions in a booming voice. Each time the lawyer tries to 
answer, the voice will grow louder, the tone more exasperated, the questions 
more exclamatory. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Considered an Intellectual Conservative 
</P>
<P>
That's Kaufman, who spent 17 years on a state appeals court in San Bernardino 
and gained a reputation as an intellectual conservative before Gov. George 
Deukmejian appointed him to the Supreme Court in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
It was widely predicted that Kaufman would lead the court to the right after 
the voters' removal of Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird and two liberal 
colleagues in the November, 1986, elections. It hasn't quite turned out that 
way. 
</P>
<P>
The court has moved to the right, but for the most part Chief Justice Malcolm 
Lucas has led the way, writing opinions for most major cases. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman has joined the majority most of the time, and was the author of an 
important 1987 decision upholding police roadblocks to look for drunk drivers. 
But he hasn't been the leader of the conservative bloc, or even its most 
consistent member. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, Kaufman wrote a dissent from a ruling by Lucas severely limiting 
damages in most suits by fired employees. He earlier dissented from a Lucas 
opinion that California antitrust laws could not be used against mergers. He 
also refused to vote to reconsider two important Bird court decisions, one 
continuing Medi-Cal abortions, the other requiring preliminary hearings for 
indicted defendants; conservatives remain two votes short of reopening both 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
But in the court's public sessions, Kaufman, 59, has lived up to his 
reputation. If not the leader, he has often been the dominant figure. 
</P>
<P>
Television cameras caught a classic Kaufman performance in the Proposition 103 
case March 7, when he hammered at a lawyer defending the insurance initiative, 
asking what evidence could justify a 20% rate rollback. 
</P>
<P>
The court does not have to accept factual claims "just because someone said 
that certain things exist without any evidence whatever," Kaufman said, his 
decibel level climbing steadily. "Tell me one thing in the record that shows it 
(the rollback) is necessary. . . . Read me the findings on (rate) 
excessiveness. . . . There's not one finding. . . . It makes me very annoyed to 
have my question avoided." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looked Like a Partisan 
</P>
<P>
Despite the attempts of attorney Karl Manheim to reply, it was apparent Kaufman 
wasn't really asking questions. His pronouncements may have been aimed at the 
public, or at the swing votes on the court; whatever his intentions, he looked 
like a partisan trying to nail an opponent to the wall. 
</P>
<P>
At other times, Kaufman seems to be on a rescue mission. When a lawyer whose 
side he appears to favor is having trouble with other justices' questions, 
Kaufman is the court's most frequent practitioner of the "softball" question, 
which typically begins, "Don't you mean to say . . . ?" 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman, described by one friend as a "redneck with a high IQ," isn't the only 
justice who uses questions to steer the argument his way. Justice Stanley Mosk, 
once he's chosen sides, will typically ask a lawyer on the other side an 
innocent-sounding question to set up his own cutting reply. 
</P>
<P>
But where Mosk uses a scalpel, Kaufman wields a sledgehammer. 
</P>
<P>
In his first day on the court in April, 1987, Kaufman interrupted a defense 
lawyer asking the justices to uphold a key death penalty ruling, demanding to 
know how long the court had to enforce any past decision "if it's incorrectly 
decided, incorrectly reasoned and incorrectly analyzed." The court later 
reversed the previous ruling, with Kaufman in the majority. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1988, reporters described Kaufman as red-faced and angry as he 
berated a lawyer defending a judge's order for county employees to register 
low-income voters, a case that is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
"Who elected the trial judge in this case (as) the Board of Supervisors?" 
Kaufman asked, shouting. "The courts do not run the counties, they do not run 
the state." 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer in that case, Dennis Perluss, said afterward that he wasn't bothered 
by Kaufman. "It was kind of fun . . . just like arguing with my father," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Others have not always reacted so calmly. It is not difficult to find lawyers 
who will describe Kaufman as an advocate in judge's robes, though it is almost 
impossible to find a critic willing to be quoted by name. 
</P>
<P>
An exception is the United Farm Workers, which burned its bridges with Kaufman 
long ago. 
</P>
<P>
On the appeals court in 1980, Kaufman declared -- in a voice described by 
several accounts as loud and angry -- that the UFW and the state farm labor 
board had been in collusion. 
</P>
<P>
The union tried to remove him from its cases; a state fact-finder found 
evidence of bias, but the state Supreme Court, in a precedent-setting ruling, 
said appellate judges must decide whether to remove themselves from cases. 
Kaufman stayed on the cases and ruled consistently against the UFW and the 
board, a pattern that has continued on the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman's actions in the dispute "fly in the face of notions of fairness and 
due process," Dianna Lyons, the union's chief appellate lawyer, said at the 
time of his nomination to the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman has denied being biased. He has described himself as sometimes "overly 
argumentative," telling an interviewer at the time of his Supreme Court 
appointment that he got "impatient with arguments that are so unreasonable, so 
ill-founded as to be an insult to the court's intelligence." 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman has stopped giving interviews, a disappointment to reporters who found 
him livelier and more informative than most of his colleagues. But reporters 
who caught up with him at a conference recently got a few comments on 
Deukmejian's nomination of Joyce Kennard to the Supreme Court, and one barb 
directed at himself. 
</P>
<P>
As he headed for a panel where he would be sitting alongside lawyers, Kaufman 
smiled and remarked that he was glad to "get a chance to go somewhere I don't 
have to yell."

THE WORST CAN BE A PLUS FOR CITIES RATED IN 'PLACES' INDEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Alphabetically speaking, Yuba City, Calif., was used to being last on lists. 
But catching the caboose in Rand McNally's "Places Rated Almanac" four years 
ago insulted residents right down to their toes. 
</P>
<P>
At first, they fumed, they raged, they stamped their collective civic feet. 
Then they got smart. 
</P>
<P>
City leaders decided "there are only two places to be on the list: the top -- 
and the bottom," said Mary Knapp, Yuba-Sutter Chamber of Commerce executive 
vice president. "It depends what you make of both of them." 
</P>
<P>
What Yuba made from last place was a heap of first-rate public relations hay. 
As city leaders reflected on how to make the best out of being the worst, they 
decided to lighten up. 
</P>
<P>
"If you screamed and ranted and raved, you made a fool of yourself," Knapp 
said. "We decided to make a fun thing of it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Burned Maps 
</P>
<P>
First, 1,000 residents burned hundreds of Rand McNally maps at a community pep 
rally, packaged the ashes in a walnut box and had a local mortician present 
them to a Rand McNally vice president, who flew out from Chicago just for the 
occasion. 
</P>
<P>
Then the city helped a radio station in Pittsburgh -- rated No. 1 in the same 
survey -- award an all-expense paid trip to Yuba City as a contest prize. The 
happy winners toured the city by limousine and rode a float in the 105th Annual 
Bok-Kai Festival. A good time was had by all. 
</P>
<P>
And at year's end, when Life magazine wrapped up 1985, it was Yuba City, not 
Pittsburgh, that received a full page. "And they spelled the name right," Knapp 
said, a little amazed. 
</P>
<P>
In the 50 years since one E. L. Thorndike created his "goodness index" for 
American cities, academicians, special interest groups, magazines and the 
federal government have cranked out a plethora of rankings identifying the best 
of all possible towns. 
</P>
<P>
Stressed out? Live in State College, Pa., says one survey; Cedar Rapids, Iowa, 
says another. 
</P>
<P>
Best place for a hip, contemporary career woman? Seattle, Savvy magazine says. 
</P>
<P>
Easiest place to make friends? San Francisco, Forbes magazine says. 
</P>
<P>
No. 1 overall? It's Pittsburgh, says one survey; Danbury, Conn., says another. 
</P>
<P>
In a nation where everybody loves the underdog but nobody wants to be one, 
where everyone says it doesn't matter what other people think but no one 
believes it, city ratings have become a source of indignation, elation, 
frustration and, always, fascination. 
</P>
<P>
Now, it's almost time for another edition of "Places Rated," the most objective 
and carefully researched of the bunch. Like the presidential election, it 
appears every four years -- and a lot of people don't like the results. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lawsuits Threatened 
</P>
<P>
The fallout has included threatened lawsuits, map and magazine burnings and, on 
a number of occasions, campaigns for civic improvements. 
</P>
<P>
But ask researchers, city officials and municipal groups what city rankings 
mean, and how seriously to take them, and the answers seem to be not much, and 
not very. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no best city, just like there's no best work of art," said Bert 
Sperling, a Portland, Ore., computer researcher who, despite that opinion, 
created software that rates cities. "Who's to say Van Gogh's 'Sunflower' is 
better than (da Vinci's) 'The Last Supper'?" 
</P>
<P>
And who's to say there are 328 better places to live than Yuba City? Why, 
"Places Rated" authors David Savageau and Richard Boyer, that's who. 
</P>
<P>
But in their next "Places Rated," Savageau and Boyer plan a section designed to 
make everyone happy by showing how under certain conditions, using factors in 
the book, any burg can be a Pittsburgh. Even last-place Yuba City. 
</P>
<P>
"For instance, if the only thing you're interested in are cities in California 
with a moderate climate and low cost of living," Savageau said, "Yuba City 
would be the best place in the whole country." 
</P>
<P>
It took "Places Rated" not only to rocket Yuba City out of obscurity but to 
propel the metro ratings game onto the best-seller list. 
</P>
<P>
The idea sprang from the authors' desire to move out of Boston and their 
discovery that there was no single source for good, solid data on life in U.S. 
cities. They decided to compile a comprehensive American cities reference 
guide, and sold Rand McNally on the idea in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
The first edition, with Atlanta at the top and Lawrence, Mass., in the cellar, 
came out in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
More than 300,000 book sales later, Savageau says he's a bit disappointed that 
the book is considered more the topic of cocktail party chitchat than the 
serious reference tool the authors intended, and he acknowledges that its 
popularity still baffles him. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't go out and buy a book that said Pittsburgh was the best place in 
the country," he said, taking a rare break from his computer and the latest 
edition of "Places Rated," due out this fall from Simon &amp; Schuster Inc., 
which acquired the series last year from Rand McNally. 
</P>
<P>
When the statistics laid the exalted mantle of extreme livability on 
Pittsburgh, a city once known as "hell with the lid off," even Rand McNally 
didn't believe it at first. 
</P>
<P>
The crowning of Pittsburgh illustrates the key difference between "Places 
Rated" and other city rankings. 
</P>
<P>
The Savageau-Boyer study gives equal weight to climate, housing, crime, 
transportation, health care, recreation, education, the arts and economics. 
That might tend to give an edge to larger cities, which have more amenities, 
and doesn't take into account which factors people think are most important. 
</P>
<P>
Other studies tend to focus on one aspect of life, such as relief from stress 
-- which the advocacy group Zero Population Growth found in Cedar Rapids and a 
study in Psychology Today magazine found in State College. 
</P>
<P>
Or they consider the preferences of a specific group of people, as Money 
magazine does, polling 251 subscribers. In its 1987 survey, Pittsburgh was 
43rd; Nashua, N.H., was No. 1. Last year, Pittsburgh moved to No. 20; Danbury, 
Conn., was top of the heap. 
</P>
<P>
A change from one year to the next in what the subscribers consider most 
important -- say, education over leisure, or transportation over weather -- 
plus even a small shift in a city's vital statistics can account for a wild 
fluctuation, said Sperling, whose company, Fast Forward, has created a computer 
program called "Places U.S.A." used by Money. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the cities that have been disappointingly rated have used it to say, 
'Oh, yeah?,' and show they have a strong community support base," said Randy 
Arndt, spokesman for the National League of Cities. "It depends on the 
resourcefulness of the city." 
</P>
<P>
The league wouldn't dream of ranking its 1,400 members. "I don't know who these 
surveys benefit, except the authors. Everybody doesn't live in the perfect 
place, but it's home to us," Arndt said. "Whether you live in Scarsdale or 
Saginaw, life is what you make of it."

GAY COUPLES WOULD GAIN LEGAL STATUS UNDER PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER McNULTY, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Laura Goldin wants to substitute five words in the state Civil Code with two 
words that supporters say would undo years of anti-gay discrimination, and 
opponents say would undermine society's structure. 
</P>
<P>
The change Goldin wrote in a proposed code revision, unanimously endorsed by 
directors of the Bar Assn. of San Francisco, would define marriage as a 
"personal relation arising out of a civil contract between two people." 
</P>
<P>
Under current law the wording is, between "a man and a woman." 
</P>
<P>
The change would have let Larry Brinkin take a three-day leave after the death 
of his lover of 11 years. His employer would not let him off, although a 
co-worker got time off for the death of a stepmother he had never met. 
</P>
<P>
It would have made it easier for Donna Hitchens and her partner to adopt. 
Hitchens, an attorney, had to become the child's guardian, leaving her partner 
with no legal parental authority until they successfully challenged the law; 
ultimately, they legally adopted two children. 
</P>
<P>
It also would force hospitals to allow a gay AIDS patient's lover to visit in 
an intensive care unit. Many hospitals now only let in relatives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Limbo-Like State' 
</P>
<P>
Gay couples live in a "limbo-like state outside of the law," said Peter Keane, 
president of the local association. "It's a pariah-type class that's set up 
within the law. To me, it's an unfairness issue." 
</P>
<P>
Redefining marriage to include homosexuals would grant all the rights, 
privileges -- and burdens -- of marriage to gay couples. Among the areas 
affected if the proposal is made into law are tax exemptions, inheritance laws, 
pensions and health plans, as well as parenting privileges and adoption rights. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not for it," said Deacon Norman D. Phillips, spokesman for Catholic 
Archbishop John Quinn. "To us, marriage is a sacrament with deeply religious 
overtones. Our church believes marriage can only be entered into by a male and 
a female." He said that Quinn believes that some inequities may warrant 
compensation, but calls for use of contracts "that don't establish a 
quasi-marriage." 
</P>
<P>
The resolution must survive two local reviews to be considered by the State Bar 
Conference of Delegates in September, when about 500 representatives of the 
state's 117,000 lawyers will consider and propose new laws and plan repeal 
efforts. If it passes, Bar lobbyists will seek a legislative sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
The specification of "a man and a woman" became law in 1977 after a spate of 
gay marriages, which were not prohibited then. Under the amendment signed by 
former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., homosexuals have little say regarding 
partners' medical care and cannot share insurance coverage or health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
In West Hollywood, the first U.S. city governed by a majority of gay city 
officials, unmarried city employees may add their partners to health benefit 
and pension plans. Berkeley and Santa Cruz offer similar benefits. 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, where an estimated 10% of the residents are homosexual, Board 
of Supervisors President Harry Britt, the panel's only gay member, has spent 
years trying to provide sweeping rights to "alternative families." 
</P>
<P>
Goldin, who is not gay, said her proposal also would include child custody, 
community property and spousal support obligations. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters do not anticipate throngs of gay couples flocking to the altar, but 
they insist that everyone should have the opportunity -- and equal rights. 
</P>
<P>
Auto insurance companies that offer family reductions exclude homosexuals and 
unmarried heterosexual couples, and income tax laws favor married couples in 
some ways, according to Karen Strauss of the Lesbian Rights Project. 
</P>
<P>
"So long as benefits are given or taken away based on relationship status, then 
we want access to them as well," said Cynthia Goldstein, an attorney with 
National Gay Rights Advocates. 
</P>
<P>
Like many lesbians, Hitchens says she would marry if she could. After 12 years 
with her partner and two adopted children, she said economics -- not emotion -- 
would prompt her to tie the legal knot. 
</P>
<P>
Brinkin, who lost a court battle against his employer over bereavement leave 
for the death of Richard Reich, is not sure whether he would marry. "My 
commitment comes from my heart and I don't need a piece of paper to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of the change contend that the issue is purely a question of law, 
that the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution 
prohibits discrimination against classes of people and should cover 
homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
"My guess is that the debate is going to be much more sociological than legal," 
said Colin W. Wied, president of the California Bar. "Society would recoil at 
this idea. My guess is that lawyers will follow suit."

FLYING 'DOCTOR' TREATS PIANOS IN AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL RODDY, Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andre Bergeot is a flying doctor with a difference: His patients across vast 
areas of West Africa are pianos suffering from the ravages of desert heat, 
tropical steam and assorted pests. 
</P>
<P>
He is the only professional piano tuner serving much of Francophone West 
Africa. His work takes him flying thousands of miles from the extreme Sahara 
Desert dryness of Mali and Niger to the sauna atmosphere of Ivory Coast. 
</P>
<P>
The problems he faces among the few hundred pianos he serves are as varied as 
the climates in which they survive. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen a snake inside a piano, but that could come," Bergeot, whose 
wire-rimmed glasses and moustache give him a professorial look, said in a 
recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
An amateur pilot, Bergeot used to fly light planes into the interior of Ivory 
Coast to keep customers in tune. Now he flies commercial jets from his home in 
Abidjan to the Sahel countries bordering the desert. 
</P>
<P>
Extreme dryness and extreme humidity wreck pianos, and Bergeot sees a lot of 
both plus mice, mites, cockroaches and termites that nibble at wood, wires and 
felt. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the pianos," he said sadly, "are beyond repair." 
</P>
<P>
Bergeot, 59, knows the region's handful of Steinways, Pleyels and Yamahas 
intimately. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the only person doing this work here and I like the climate," he said. 
"And people are nicer than they are in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Bergeot, who was born in the Loire region of France, wanted to be a military 
pilot but couldn't because he has weak eyes. 
</P>
<P>
A family friend who was head of the French piano tuners' union urged him to 
learn his present trade. Another friend said piano owners in Ivory Coast were 
desperate for someone to ease the pain of swelled wood and rusted strings. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeot moved to Abidjan with his wife and family in 1966 for a two-year trial 
period and has been here ever since. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Influx of French 
</P>
<P>
His arrival coincided with a post-independence influx of French working in 
Ivorian government and business, many of whom brought pianos. 
</P>
<P>
He estimated that at the peak in the early 1980s there were about 400 pianos in 
Ivory Coast but the number has dwindled as many French have left. 
</P>
<P>
Used pianos are rare and in high demand. Bergeot reckoned that one that was 50 
years old, with sticking keys and mite-eaten felt was a steal for $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Although he plans to retire in a few years, Bergeot does not want West Africa's 
pianos to fall flat when he leaves and is training an African apprentice to 
take over the business. 
</P>
<P>
"There will always be French here," he said. "So there will always be pianos."

CATERINA'S STORY READS LIKE A PULP ROMANCE; 
</P>
<P>
CYPRIOT QUEEN WAS NO TRAGIC FIGURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
NICOSIA, Cyprus 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Caterina Cornaro was a pawn in superpower intrigues five centuries ago, but she 
ruled as queen of Cyprus for almost 16 years and won a lasting reputation as a 
fascinating Renaissance personality. 
</P>
<P>
Caterina, a Venetian aristocrat, inspired dozens of portraits as a dark-eyed 
beauty, a string of biographies and five operas, including one by the Italian 
composer Gaetano Donizetti. 
</P>
<P>
Her life story reads like a pulp romance, starting with a short-lived marriage 
at 18 to James the Bastard, king of Cyprus, and ending with retirement near 
Venice presiding over a glittering salon of poets, painters and musicians. 
</P>
<P>
But a new book published to mark the 500th anniversary of Caterina's enforced 
abdication in 1489 avoids depicting her as a tragic heroine. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, she comes across as a tough survivor, maneuvering to stay alive in an 
maelstrom of violence and political treachery between Greeks and Italians on 
this east Mediterranean island. 
</P>
<P>
According to one of the three contributors to "Caterina Cornaro, Queen of 
Cyprus," the chroniclers' references to her as la bella donna (the beautiful 
lady) probably were inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
"She must have had what we would call charisma, but I don't think she could be 
considered beautiful . . . more a woman of character," Terence Mullaly, a 
British art critic and Renaissance specialist, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"She was certainly hard-headed and realistic, and not the sad deposed queen of 
the sentimental legend." 
</P>
<P>
Mullaly said that none of the portraits of Caterina as a young woman were 
definitely contemporary. The only one that dates from her lifetime, by the 
renowned Venetian painter Gentile Bellini, shows a plump matron "with shrewd 
eyes and a capable air," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Caterina rose to fame when she sailed to Cyprus in September, 1472, to marry 
James, a ruthless but popular king who seized the throne from his half-sister, 
Charlotte, the legitimate heir. 
</P>
<P>
But James died suddenly nine months later, apparently of dysentery, and so did 
Caterina's infant son, both in suspicious circumstances, according to Joachim 
G. Joachim, a Cypriot historian who also contributed to the book. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced that both James and his son were poisoned, and the Venetians are 
the prime suspects," Joachim said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
The historian, who researched Caterina's life in libraries around Europe, 
added: "It was their favored method of assassination. They had professional 
poisoners on the state payroll . . . and they benefited most from James' 
death." 
</P>
<P>
Caterina succeeded to the throne. But she was hemmed in by her Venetian 
relatives and advisers who accused her of spending extravagantly. They also 
blocked her plans to marry Prince Alonzo of Naples, when she was 34 and he was 
22. 
</P>
<P>
Caterina fought back, writing letters to Venice complaining that her counselors 
spoke to her rudely and failed to consult her on financial and judicial issues. 
</P>
<P>
But in the face of a growing threat from Ottoman Turkey, Caterina was finally 
persuaded to abdicate in 1489 and make a gift of Cyprus to the Venetian 
republic. 
</P>
<P>
In return, she got a pension of 8,000 ducats a year for life and sovereignty 
over the small hill town of Asolo, 33 miles from Venice. Histories say 8,000 
ducats was a comfortable royal stipend for that time. According to calculations 
based on the amount of gold in a ducat, the stipend would be worth around 
$450,000 today. 
</P>
<P>
"The Venetians were the all-time masters of diplomacy," Joachim said. "They 
knew when to act, and Caterina knew when she had to give in." 
</P>
<P>
In Asolo and her three other homes in the Veneto, Caterina sponsored theatrical 
performances and concerts and entertained the leading intellectuals of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Caterina died in 1510 and was buried in Venice. The Venetians held on to Cyprus 
until 1570, when it was captured by the Turks.

PERU'S LAND REFORM PROGRAM IS FAILING TO FEED ITS GROWING POPULATION

<TEXT>
<P>
Though the ancient Incas thrived on this Andean nation's stingy soil, Peru 
today has farming woes that drain its funds and leave it short of food. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the major culprit is a land reform program, South America's 
largest, that has failed to keep modern Peru's feeble farm production growing 
at the same pace as the population. 
</P>
<P>
"Agriculture was mortally wounded by the agrarian program," Peru's leading 
newspaper El Comercio said in a recent editorial bemoaning the 20th anniversary 
of the event. 
</P>
<P>
Many people think the spreading chaos in Peru -- marked by the flight of 
hundreds of thousands of highland peasants to city slums, a deep economic 
recession and a leftist guerrilla insurgency -- has been aggravated by the 
failure of land reform. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians and agronomists alike are frantically seeking solutions, and they 
hope recent legislation will help. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is reflected by "The Castle," an ornate mansion on a former cotton 
baron's estate. It sits like a fading symbol on the outskirts of Canete, an 
oasis town on the desert coast, 100 miles south of Lima, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
Like hundreds of other large farms, the estate's 1,500 acres were expropriated 
and organized into a cooperative for the 100 peasant families who had worked 
the land as virtual serfs. 
</P>
<P>
Today The Castle lies abandoned and deteriorating, much like the agrarian 
reform instituted by the leftist military ruler at the time, Gen. Juan Velasco. 
</P>
<P>
But its surrounding fertile farmlands have begun to reflect their former glory 
since the government allowed the cooperatives to be divided up among their 
members. 
</P>
<P>
"Under Velasco we all made good money, but no one wanted to work," said Jubilio 
Ensiso, 42, one of The Castle's farmers. "They'd spend just four or six hours 
in the fields. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we put in twice that because we are working for ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Velasco's land reform program sought to break the aristocracy's grip over the 
countryside. 
</P>
<P>
About 22 million acres were redistributed, more land than in any reform program 
outside of Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
Productivity suffered as peasants with no management experience took control. 
Analysts say the program eventually failed in a morass of inefficiency due to 
poor planning and execution. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer than 20% of Peru's landless peasants actually received land, according to 
the Institute for Peruvian Studies, a private social research center. 
</P>
<P>
Since the program began in 1969, farm output has grown slightly more than 1% 
yearly, while the population grew by 2.5% a year. 
</P>
<P>
As a result successive governments have had to increase imports of food 
staples. The 1988 foreign grocery bill reached $600 million, one-quarter of 
Peru's export earnings. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was aggravated when the debt-strapped government of President Alan 
Garcia late last year ran low of foreign currency to pay for the imports. 
</P>
<P>
Sporadic shortages of wheat, dried milk and other staples have plagued Peru 
since then, and the government has asked other nations for emergency food. 
</P>
<P>
Modern farming woes contrast sharply with the success of the Incas, who 
routinely had a surplus after feeding a population estimated at more than half 
of Peru's current 21 million. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Spanish destroyed the Incas' highly organized society, some of their 
agricultural expertise, including desert irrigation canals and mountain 
terraces, is still widely applied by Peruvian peasants today. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago the government drastically modified the failing reform program 
and began allowing cooperatives to cut their lands into parcels, with equal 
sections going to members to reap whatever profits they could. 
</P>
<P>
Farmer Ensiso says output since then at the former cotton estate here has grown 
about 20% since then, a figure he says is generally true of other cooperatives 
that divided up their lands.

ILLITERACY IN MATH CAN ADD UP TO NEGATIVE LIFE, PROFESSOR SAYS

<P>
Quick, what's the difference between 1 million, 1 billion and 1 trillion? 
</P>
<P>
You're in trouble if you respond with something like, "What's the difference 
when the figures get that high?" 
</P>
<P>
If you think the Empire State Building is about a mile high, plead guilty 
again. 
</P>
<P>
You're an innumerate. 
</P>
<P>
Help, however, is at hand. 
</P>
<P>
Meet the oxymoronic John Allen Paulos, a witty mathematics professor who quotes 
philosophers, devours novels, once did a stand-up comedy act in a Philadelphia 
club and passionately hopes that his fifth-grade math teacher reads his latest 
book. He's also a man who doesn't think the world would be a better place if we 
were all able to work quadratic equations. 
</P>
<P>
"Come to the fifth floor," he instructs a visitor, "and go to room . . . this 
is rather embarrassing given the subject of the book, but it's either room 540 
or 542." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Russell's Shadow 
</P>
<P>
A huge poster of Bertrand Russell, one of his idols, looks over his shoulder as 
he works. A pyramid of blue and magenta empty Hawaiian Punch cans -- fun to 
move around in different configurations -- rests quietly now in a garish 
display on his windowsill. 
</P>
<P>
Paulos, a 43-year-old Temple University professor, has written "Innumeracy: 
Mathematical Illiteracy and its Consequences," a book whose title would not 
compel the average reader to snap it off the shelf. But it's fun, and Paulos 
tells you it's OK to skip the tough parts. 
</P>
<P>
One of the tough parts is the title itself. The word "innumeracy," which means 
the inability to deal comfortably with the fundamental notions of number and 
chance, has been in usage in England since the 1950s, Paulos says. He first 
came across it several years ago in an article in Scientific American. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be in American dictionaries soon," he says. "Dan Rather has used it a 
few times, and that's got to be an imprimatur." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Numbers Within Easy Grasp 
</P>
<P>
But back to that first question. Throughout the book, Paulos has a knack of 
breaking things down into easily grasped units. 
</P>
<P>
He wants people to have a sense of the vast difference among the members of the 
" . . . illion" family. He suggests that you look at it this way: One million 
seconds takes about 11 1/2 days to tick by. A billion seconds would take almost 
32 years. A trillion seconds equals 32,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
Paulos says he sometimes asks his freshman students how high the Empire State 
Building is. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want them to go and look it up," he says. "I just want to know about 
their sense of proportion and scale. I would consider 1,000 feet a correct 
answer, even 2,000 feet, because it's in the range. (Actual footage is 1,200 
feet.) But if a student said 50 feet or a mile, he has no sense of what a mile 
is, what a mile is like straight up in the air." 
</P>
<P>
Paulos, who teaches freshmen as well as graduate students, is a recognized 
expert in symbolic logic, computer languages and artificial intelligence. Born 
in Denver, he grew up in Milwaukee and describes himself as a bright kid but 
very shy. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a book for educated people," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Paulos notes that he once accompanied his wife, a former French teacher turned 
romance novelist, to the doctor to learn more about a minor procedure she was 
facing. 
</P>
<P>
"Within 20 minutes, the doctor said there was only a million-to-one shot of 
something going wrong, that it was a 99% safe procedure, and then he said that 
it usually went quite well," he says. When Paulos tried to explain to the 
physician that he just said three entirely different things, he was met with a 
grim stare and incomprehension. 
</P>
<P>
"Even in their areas of expertise, people just use numbers, not knowing what 
they mean," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Paulos has met with blank stares before. When he did the comedy club act, one 
of his jokes had to do with the sign suggesting citizens put litter where it 
belongs. Paulos pointed out that if people did that, it would no longer be 
litter, it would be garbage. Litter, he pointed out, is litter only when it is 
littering. 
</P>
<P>
Not too many chuckles. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, most of it went quite well, but some of it was a little too cerebral 
for the club," he says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Quite Discounts 
</P>
<P>
He also gets blank stares when he quips that something selling at a "fraction 
of its normal cost" probably is -- and that the fraction is 4/3. 
</P>
<P>
His quixotic quest is serious. He believes that innumeracy contributes to a 
lack of skepticism and lack of critical thinking, which leads to poor life 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"People should know, for instance, that when they see a headline that says 
something like 1 million American children kidnaped every year, that it's 
simply not true," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"Innumerates, if I can use that as a noun, tend to personalize things and 
overvalue coincidences," he says. "They don't have a sense of how unrare 
coincidences are, so they read entirely too much into them." 
</P>
<P>
These are the people, he says, who get involved with numerology, astrology, and 
such largely because they don't understand the laws of probabilities, nor do 
they think critically. Do they ever wonder how many times the psychic was 
wrong, rather than boasting about the one time he was right? 
</P>
<P>
Paulos has many funny examples in his book, such as the Wisconsin legislator 
who opposed daylight-saving time on the ground that that much more sun would 
fade the curtains and the carpets faster. 
</P>
<P>
He blames math teachers, the social acceptability of even intelligent men and 
women rather proudly flaunting their innumeracy, and a general unawareness of 
how important these things are in a society that is rapidly becoming more and 
more scientific and technical. 
</P>
<P>
He has no patience with people who proclaim that they do not have a head for 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone can master the elements of mathematics," Paulos says. "The unfortunate 
thing is that some of it is kind of ugly. It's like learning to parse a 
sentence. That's not fun, but it's necessary to get to the fun things like 
literature. Before you play with patterns and structures and have fun with 
math, you have to go through the ugly part too." 
</P>
<P>
He partly blames the math teachers who lack imagination. As a fifth-grader, he 
was very proud to have computed the ERA (earned run average) of one of the 
worst pitchers the Milwaukee Braves ever had -- a 135. He showed it to his 
teacher. The teacher told him to go sit down, announcing authoritatively that 
the highest possible ERA was 27. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the year, the Milwaukee Journal published all the ERAs, and since 
this guy had been kicked down to the minors and not pitched again, there it was 
in black and white -- 135. 
</P>
<P>
When confronted with this, the teacher, though dead wrong, told Paulos to sit 
down. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that martinet is reading my book," Paulos says. "His idea of teaching 
math was getting students to sit down." 
</P>
<P>
Paulos also wrote two previous books, "Mathematics and Humor," and "I Think 
Therefore I Laugh," as well as various newspaper and magazine articles. He is 
negotiating a contract to write a syndicated weekly column on problems great 
and small, sort of a Paulos on numbers and probabilities rather than a William 
Safire on usage. 
</P>
<P>
Paulos is also concerned about a blind faith in numbers. He stresses that the 
human assumptions must be correct before the math is good. 
</P>
<P>
He points out that even the most basic "one and one is two" is not correct if 
the assumptions are wrong. His example: One cup of popcorn plus one cup of 
water does not equal two of anything. It equals 1 1/2 cups of soggy popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
The book, published by Hill and Wang, is an alternate Book-of-the-Month Club 
selection and has received generally good reviews.

LANGUAGES ABOUND IN SAN DIEGO'S DOYLE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

A typical morning at Doyle Elementary School finds instructional aide Nobu Baum 
talking and writing in Japanese both about that language's ideograms and about 
English consonant combinations for a group of Japanese first- and 
second-graders. 
</P>
<P>
Across the hall, a second aide, Bat-Sheva Zimran, discusses math and grammar 
problems in Hebrew with a couple of second-grade Israeli students. 
</P>
<P>
In Victoria Ingalls' regular kindergarten class, students from Japan, China, 
Korea, Denmark and Germany -- to name just a few countries -- read books and 
piece together puzzles with their American peers under watchful eyes of parent 
volunteers from Denmark, Japan and from the school's Golden Triangle 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
And at recess, there is the potential babble of at least 21 different languages 
on the playgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unique Among Schools 
</P>
<P>
The international world of Doyle Elementary, tucked away among large apartment 
and condominium complexes just east of UC San Diego, is unique among schools in 
San Diego County and equaled only at a few similar campuses across the country. 
</P>
<P>
By virtue of its location, Doyle draws most of its population from among the 
large numbers of university graduate students and scholars at UCSD, Scripps 
Clinic, the La Jolla Veterans Hospital and adjacent research institutions who 
live in the attractive, nearby off-campus residential developments. 
</P>
<P>
Among those scholars are about 2,000 foreign residents, an increasing number 
with young children who qualify for public school education, the same as the 
offspring of American university scholars and company employees living in the 
same La Jolla Colony and University Towne Centre neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a school of children of highly educated and highly motivated 
parents, but where up to one-third of the 600 students may be from foreign 
lands and who come with little or no English preparation. 
</P>
<P>
"The unique richness of cultures and languages you find here is really 
extraordinary," Doyle Principal Jerry Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
Said kindergarten teacher Ingalls, one of four English-as-a-second-language 
(ESL) teachers: "On the average, the foreign kids are here from six months to 
two years, but they pick up a tremendous amount of English in a very, very 
short time. 
</P>
<P>
"Traditionally, most teaching material for limited English-speaking children is 
aimed at an immigrant population, those children who may not have had much 
education in their native land, and who may not have had educated parents. 
</P>
<P>
"Here we've got mainly a college- or medicine-related foreign population, where 
at least one parent is highly educated and quite proficient in reading or 
writing English, and who came from outstanding educational facilities in their 
own countries." 
</P>
<P>
The largest number of foreign students are from Japan and Israel. The school 
has a growing number of Spanish-speaking students, some the offspring of 
foreign scholars and others the sons and daughters of workers in the Golden 
Triangle commercial and hotel complexes. In addition, a number of upwardly 
mobile Vietnamese and Laotian immigrant families have moved into area 
apartments during the last two years, adding to the cultural mix. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Typical Lessons 
</P>
<P>
There are smaller numbers of students from Sweden, Korea, Portugal, Brazil, 
Finland, Iran, the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany and Hungary, with the breadth 
of international representation varying somewhat from year to year. 
</P>
<P>
All students are placed in regular classrooms at their grade level, and those 
who have limited English ability -- the vast majority -- also receive intensive 
ESL instruction, which emphasizes speaking and listening comprehension. In a 
typical lesson the other day, ESL aide Latanya Martin led five kindergarten 
students -- from Brazil, Vietnam, Japan, Iran and Israel -- through a 
conversation lesson using "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs." 
</P>
<P>
Further, the school offers native-language teaching in Japanese and Hebrew for 
up to an hour each day because of the large number of Japanese and Israeli 
students, instruction that administrators admit is highly unusual but 
nevertheless valuable and justified under the district's second-language 
curriculum. All of the district's native-language programs at other schools are 
in Spanish or one of several Indochinese languages. 
</P>
<P>
Language specialists say that primary-language instruction -- at the same time 
that the students are receiving English the rest of the day -- helps to make 
the transition to English comprehension easier. That's because the students 
become literate in their first language and therefore make a more natural 
switch to English, administrators say. They add that it also allows students to 
learn new concepts in math and social studies areas without having to sit 
through all-English instruction that they would not understand initially. 
</P>
<P>
"If you learn to read in your own language, the transition to a second is much 
easier," said Alex Belliaeff, a second-language resource teacher who helps with 
the Doyle curriculum. But Belliaeff is sometimes asked why such special 
assistance is offered to students who probably will be in the United States for 
an average of two years, as opposed to primary-language instruction for 
students who have immigrated permanently. 
</P>
<P>
"By law, we cannot ask parents whether the children are going back to Israel or 
Japan, or wherever, in a year or two," Belliaeff said, "just like we don't ask 
parents of Spanish-speaking children if they are going to return to Mexico at 
some point. 
</P>
<P>
"If the child has need for primary-language help while they are learning 
English, and the parent agrees to it, then we offer it as we have the resources 
to do it, on a 'pull-out' basis." 
</P>
<P>
The district does not have funds to provide primary language teaching in most 
cases where there are only a few students from a single country, and it finds 
that many European students already come with some English understanding, 
Belliaeff said. But it will try to add courses in Vietnamese, Chinese or any 
other language at Doyle if the need develops, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The parents of the Israeli and Japanese students at Doyle also see benefits 
from the Doyle curriculum for their children when they return to their home 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
"The school district goal, of course, is to help the students achieve better in 
English," Zimran, the Hebrew aide, said. 
</P>
<P>
"When you know your own language well enough, when you know what nouns and 
verbs are, for example, it's easier then to get the English," Zimran added, 
referring to the progress made by her own children, one at Doyle and the second 
now at Standley Junior High School. 
</P>
<P>
"But of course, we want the children to keep their Hebrew up, through grammar, 
spelling and literature. So we also read Jack London, Mark Twain, Hemingway in 
Hebrew for the upper-grade kids." 
</P>
<P>
Japanese-language teacher Baum said she helps the students prepare for the 
regular English reading program by emphasizing recognition of English consonant 
and vowel sounds, but she also provides advanced math and social studies 
enrichment similar to what the students would receive in Japan. And she 
stresses the complicated Japanese writing system, with a classroom wall banner 
in Japanese exhorting the students to "Memorize Kanji," the 1,850 ideograms 
that are the basis of the Japanese language. 
</P>
<P>
"From time to time, we talk about things happening in Japan, and about Japanese 
festivals," she said. "And I also give them tutoring in other subjects that 
they may have trouble comprehending in English, but I also give them the 
English words at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
While Baum said the Japanese parents hope their children will learn English, 
"they very much want the (Japanese) language instruction although they always 
worry that it is not enough . . . and most send their children as well to 
Saturday school (a special school paid for by the Japanese community in San 
Diego and overseen by educational officials from Japan). The feeling is that 
with the Kanji characters, you must use them or you forget them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Walks a Fine Line' 
</P>
<P>
Ingalls said that the school "walks a fine line" on the primary-language 
curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, primary fluency is popular with parents but legally our goal is not 
to have it solely for keeping the children up on their own language," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Ingalls said that even though most children spend two years or less at 
Doyle, a significant number become fluent enough in English to complete the ESL 
curriculum. Others become highly proficient but are unable to read quickly 
enough to achieve the necessary score on district tests to be listed as fluent. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Doyle's large number of foreign students, the school ranks 21st out of 
107 San Diego Unified School District elementaries in achievement based on 
standardized language and math tests. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I think I was surprised at first about my daughter's kindergarten class," 
said Dr. Kenji Ueda, a visiting Japanese researcher in the UCSD Department of 
Neurosciences. "She has much homework, and that was a little surprising." 
</P>
<P>
Bjorn Hansen, from Denmark, said his son, Jakob, enjoys American schools very 
much. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no expectations at all at first," said Hansen, a parent volunteer at 
Doyle while his wife, Julia, pursues advanced studies at UCSD in biology. "The 
level of learning is very, very high. . . . I have no problems in sending him 
here. We heard about Doyle from professors at UCSD and they told us that we 
should not worry about the public schools." 
</P>
<P>
Afreda Beverly, a neighborhood parent volunteer, said she and her husband, a 
Great American executive, almost placed their daughter, Zikarra, in a private 
school, "but after visiting Doyle and seeing how international it is, we said 
that this is a good school. . . . It offers everything but prayer, but we can 
teach that at home." 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla resident Alma Coles, who talks with many foreign parents at UCSD as a 
longtime member of the Friends of the UCSD International Center, said that 
teachers at Doyle have both experience and expertise in dealing with an 
international clientele. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that many parents are pleasantly surprised to find that our schools do 
have discipline, do have computers, that certainly there is much more than what 
they have seen on television (in their countries) or read about pregnancy, 
drugs, violence in schools," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The foreign students tend to make friends with each other more than with 
American students, however. Baum said that the foreign students all have in 
common the fact they come from elsewhere than America, that they may only be in 
the United States a short time, and that they speak English with an accent. 
</P>
<P>
"Other foreign students can't tell the accent difference so much," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Zimran added that while some friendships are made with Americans, "You find 
more my son, for example, having friends from Finland and Mexico, or my 
daughter with a girl from Iran, or between Japanese and Swedish." 
</P>
<P>
Principal Jordan said that the school has had little or no interracial tension, 
although it copes with the same problems as other schools in "trying to get 
children to accept one another for what they are" as part of the district's 
race-human relations educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
"For the most part, we haven't had many problems come up. . . . We try and take 
advantage of our international basis," Jordan said. "We take the viewpoint that 
we are preparing children for a diminishing world in terms of isolation and 
that the values we teach here for the foreign kids and our own will affect us 
in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at how much a country like Japan is involved in our country today, so in 
a way we are really teaching our own kids (when we teach the Japanese) and 
hoping that the interchange will result in an advantage to us."

HAS ALASKA LEARNED FROM ITS QUAKE? MANY FEAR NOT

<P>
Lidia Selkregg speaks quickly, gesturing intently as she recalls the day the 
Earth unleashed titanic forces in Alaska and the land slid, heaved and sank. 
</P>
<P>
Deep beneath the coastline of Prince William Sound, giant layers of rock 
jostled and slipped on March 27, 1964. The earthquake measured 8.5 on the 
Richter scale, and it killed 131 people as far south as California. 
</P>
<P>
Now Selkregg, a geologist and former Anchorage assemblywoman, says she fears 
that many officials and developers have forgotten that day's tragic lessons. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to think they are more powerful than God. Nature is nature," she 
said, adding, "I feel terrible that I have to say what I'm saying." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'There Will Be One' 
</P>
<P>
Some devastated cities have rebuilt away from the areas that proved vulnerable 
in 1964, but in others, including Anchorage, reconstruction was on the old 
sites. Selkregg and others are afraid that will mean greater losses in the next 
great quake, something they call inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm positive there will be one, I just don't know when," says John Davies, 
state seismologist. "But I think the tendency is for us to forget the lessons." 
</P>
<P>
In Anchorage, safety-conscious engineers have clashed with development-oriented 
landowners since the rebuilding began. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a camp that essentially believes development should go forward 
anywhere in the city with little or no regard to the consequences of 
earthquakes," said Dave Cole, an engineer and past chairman of the city's 
advisory Geotechnical Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Anchorage building codes have addressed the safety of buildings, but not the 
ground beneath. Critics say that means sturdy structures have been built on 
land that is prone to slide, notably high ground sought after for its views. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Nicer Property' 
</P>
<P>
Around Anchorage in 1964, "the primary reason for damage and loss of life was 
not the shaking of ground, but rather the failure of the bluff areas," Davies 
said. "We're rebuilding on those areas right now." 
</P>
<P>
Those areas are some of the city's prime pieces of land. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nicer property, the view property," said John Aho, an engineer and 
12-year member of the Geotechnical Commission. "It's been long enough (since 
1964) so people have forgotten how hard things can shake. 
</P>
<P>
"The developers are not really into wanting to hear about these things. The 
administration doesn't want to hear about these things. People who own the 
property don't want to hear." 
</P>
<P>
Before the quake, homes stood on Turnagain Street. But a quake-triggered 
landslide dragged the neighborhood into the sea. There is debate over whether 
the site has been adequately buttressed. 
</P>
<P>
On L Street, site of another major slide, high-rise buildings have been allowed 
to sprout, looming over condominiums below. 
</P>
<P>
"L Street, that's the one I have no question saying it will move again if there 
is a large enough, long enough earthquake," said Duane Miller, head of the 
Geotechnical Commission. 
</P>
<P>
But Bruce Phelps, comprehensive planning manager for Anchorage, said he thinks 
the city has done enough to protect residents, though he acknowledged, "I'm in 
the minority." 
</P>
<P>
Developers built in danger areas because "there was no legal way to stop them," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a major policy question. 'Do we develop?' I don't know if it was 
ill-advised or not." 
</P>
<P>
It may be too late to draft more stringent regulations regarding ground 
failure. "What happens with the buildings that already exist?" Phelps asked. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$300 Million in Damage 
</P>
<P>
A draft seismic risk study ordered by the city estimates there could be $300 
million in damage from another quake as strong as the one in 1964, almost half 
of it in slide-prone areas, Coles said. 
</P>
<P>
Across Alaska, other cities also have had to deal with the ravages of the 
monster quake. 
</P>
<P>
The Valdez dock area collapsed into the harbor when 95-foot waves lashed the 
waterfront. The city since has been moved to more solid ground. The site of the 
old town stands barren. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to predict what would happen if we had another one," said Doug 
Griffin, Valdez city manager. "I believe that we have largely learned from the 
experience and that it would not be as bad." 
</P>
<P>
Seward also was in ruins after the 1964 quake. The jolt and 30-foot waves 
destroyed more than buildings; they also ruined the economy. The city's 
railroad tracks, warehouses, fuel tanks, canneries, ship loading and unloading 
facilities were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
When the ground started shaking, Seward was the seaport for Alaska's interior. 
"After that, everything moved to Anchorage," said Mayor Harry Gieseler. 
</P>
<P>
"That area was not rebuilt; what we've done is move the industrial base across 
the bay to an area that is safe," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If another quake and sea wave come, Seward would fare better than last time, 
Gieseler said. "The way the bay lies, all houses and things are above the 
50-foot line, and that's where the water came up to last time." 
</P>
<P>
But in Kodiak, there could be a rerun of the 1964 devastation. 
</P>
<P>
"There would be a lot more property loss because . . . when the federal 
government assisted the city in rebuilding, they rebuilt primarily where the 
event occurred," said Gordon Gould, city manager and head of Kodiak's emergency 
management organization, which has developed a plan to evacuate the town in 15 
to 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the city's industrial base -- canneries, fuel docks, warehouses -- is 
on the waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a fishing village, and you have to accept a certain amount of risk 
from the sea," he said. "Other than build huge dikes, there's not much you can 
do."

'SUPERQUAKE' MAY LIE AHEAD ALMOST ANYWHERE IN U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE SIEGEL, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The horror that rocked Alaska 25 years ago inevitably will happen again 
somewhere, as huge plates of the Earth's crust regularly slip and produce 
monstrous earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
"There's absolute certainty a great quake will hit Earth somewhere every few 
years, and almost as much certainty that every 20 to 30 years we'll have one of 
the supergiant quakes, as in Chile in 1960 and Alaska in 1964," said John 
Nance, author of "On Shaky Ground: An Invitation to Disaster." 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, Alaska and perhaps the Pacific Northwest are most prone 
to superquakes, but California and the eastern half of the United States have 
trembled violently in somewhat smaller temblors -- and will do so again. 
</P>
<P>
"It's dangerous arrogance for any of us, wherever we live, to assume the 
problem is isolated to any particular region," Nance said by telephone from 
Tacoma, Wash. "We stand united in the shadow of seismic peril." 
</P>
<P>
The quake that shook south-central Alaska on March 27, 1964, measured 8.5 on 
the Richter scale and 9.2 on the "moment magnitude" scale, which seismologists 
say is the most accurate measure of large temblors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rare 'Supergiant' Quake 
</P>
<P>
That makes it the second-largest quake ever recorded, and one of only three 
"supergiant" quakes this century. 
</P>
<P>
The largest was of magnitude 9.5 on May 21, 1960. It generated a tidal wave 
that killed 5,700 people in Chile. The third superquake was of magnitude 9.0 on 
April 11, 1952, on the Kamchatka Peninsula of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska's giant quake relieved so much underground stress that a repeat in the 
same location is unlikely for 300 to 1,200 years, said Christopher Stevens, a 
U.S. Geological Survey seismologist in Menlo Park, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
A less powerful but still dangerous quake could hit the same area much sooner, 
said USGS seismologist Stuart Nishenko in Golden, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Supergiant quakes and great ones -- beyond magnitude 8 -- are most likely along 
the edges of the enormous, constantly drifting plates of rock that make up the 
Earth's crust. 
</P>
<P>
One danger zone is the Circum-Pacific "ring of fire," which includes the 
Pacific coasts of South, Central and North America, Japan and New Zealand. The 
other zone stretches from the Mediterranean through Turkey, Iran, the southern 
Soviet Union and into Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Superquakes happen only in certain parts of these belts, called subduction 
zones, where thinner crustal plates beneath the oceans smash into and dive 
beneath thicker continental plates. The diving plate often hangs up on the 
overlying plate for decades or centuries, allowing tremendous stress to build. 
</P>
<P>
At 5:36 p.m. on Good Friday in 1964, such stress reached the breaking point 12 
1/2 miles beneath Alaska's Prince William Sound. A chunk of the Pacific plate, 
hundreds of square miles in area, jerked spasmodically under Alaska and the 
North American plate. 
</P>
<P>
There is potential for similar sudden movement farther south. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lurks Off Coast 
</P>
<P>
"A (future) quake equally destructive to Alaska 1964 lurks only a few dozen 
miles off the Oregon-Washington coast, ready to lash an area from northern 
Vancouver Island all the way to Northern California," killing thousands, Nance 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although superquakes happen only along subduction zones, lesser temblors can 
occur within plates, such as in the interior of China and the eastern half of 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Three "intraplate" quakes, estimated at up to 8.6 on the Richter scale, were 
centered on a fault deep beneath New Madrid, Mo., in 1811 and 1812. They killed 
several dozen people, temporarily reversed the flow of the Mississippi River 
and rang church bells in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Ketter, director of the National Center for Earthquake Engineering 
Research, has estimated that a modern New Madrid quake would kill thousands. 
</P>
<P>
"The Eastern Seaboard is in more danger than the West because they are 
abysmally unprepared," with building standards far less stringent than 
California's, Nance said.

UNSELD JOINS COACH-OF-YEAR FIELD

<P>
Three weeks to go in the regular season, and a new name has appeared in the 
talk for coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
There were four obvious names -- Don Nelson, who's managed to win with a 
shortie lineup and with Manute Bol firing up three-pointers; Cotton 
Fitzsimmons, who has overseen the revitalization of a moribund Phoenix 
franchise; Lenny Wilkens, who has molded the young Cavaliers into title 
contenders and kept them on an even keel; and Rick Pitino, who has kept the 
press on in New York all season even when the pundits said it couldn't be done. 
</P>
<P>
Add to the mix Washington's Wes Unseld. 
</P>
<P>
There were some in the Bullets' organization who wondered if Washington would 
win 20 games this season. That wasn't pessimistic. A lot of people around the 
league agreed. But Unseld, along with assistants Jeff Bzdelik and Bill Blair, 
has implemented a motion offense and a trapping defense that, while not the 
equal of the Knicks', has won its share of games. 
</P>
<P>
And the Bullets, who won 38 games all of last season, have won 30 this season 
without Moses Malone, Bol and Muggsy Bogues, with 18 regular-season games to 
go. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the stunning about-faces in Phoenix and Golden State (the Suns 
already have won 14 more games than last season; the Warriors, 17), Unseld is 
unlikely to win the award. But he may grab a handful of votes. 
</P>
<P>
"He's done a terrific job," said Philadelphia Coach Jim Lynam. "We played them 
twice in pre-season and I liked the way they were sharing the ball and playing 
unselfishly then. It was a dramatic change in style and they've taken some time 
to get it down." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Unseld continues to insist he's not smart enough to know anything 
about coaching. Someone knows something, for the Bullets have been playing as 
well as they possibly can play for the last three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers aren't anonymous anymore, what with their great record this 
season, and they find themselves getting in more and more scraps, especially 
with a team from Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
"I think teams that take you seriously prepare for you," said center Brad 
Daugherty. "Games become more difficult. You really have to play well every 
night in order to take a team's best shot." 
</P>
<P>
As far as the Pistons, who got him suspended for a game and knocked Mark Price 
out for two, courtesy of a Rick Mahorn elbow, Daugherty said what they do is 
smart, but a nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
"They try to provoke an incident to take your mind away from the game of 
basketball," he said. "They're within the rules. They're fouling aggressively, 
pushing and shoving and things like that, but what makes it so hard to deal 
with is when you get caught doing the same things ... the game's fine when 
you're playing hard and they're pushing and shoving, but when you get called 
for a foul for doing the same thing, that's when everything gets worked up. 
That's when it gets hard to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frustrating. What the hell am I supposed to do? ... (the league) is 
wrapped up into it just like everyone else. That just proves the point. They 
intimidate a lot of people. Sometimes, maybe, you wonder if they don't 
intimidate everyone." 
</P>
<P>
He left the definition of "everyone" to others. ... 
</P>
<P>
Charles Barkley's 43-point, 14-rebound effort against the Knicks last Thursday 
was, the all-pro forward said, a message to the New Yorkers for future playoff 
reference. 
</P>
<P>
"More than likely, we're going to play them in the first round. So it's going 
to be (difficult)," he said. "It's going to five games. It's going to be a war 
when we play these guys. They'll probably have the home court. But it ain't 
gonna be easy. It's going to be five games. We don't think they can beat us in 
Philly, and we know it's going to be tough when we play here. But it's going to 
be a serious game when we play these guys." 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
When Bernie Bickerstaff and assistant Bob Kloppenburg were out of commission on 
the same day a couple of weeks ago, the running of the team was left to second 
assistant Tom Newell, scout Gary Wortman and an unfamiliar face on the bench -- 
SuperSonics President Bob Whitsitt. "I've coached pee-wees," Whitsitt told 
Seattle reporters. "Well, actually, I just kept stats for them. That's the 
extent of my experience." Bickerstaff returned to practice Monday. . . . Add 
odd assistants: the injured Jeff Malone took stats and, he said, drew up plays 
during Washington's win over Philadelphia Saturday. "I called a couple of 
20-second timeouts," he said. "I drew up a couple of plays that I didn't get a 
chance to run. I think they would have been very effective. If we had, we might 
have won by two or three more points." . . . Denver's Doug Moe, angered when 
the Pistons fouled Denver players in the last minute of a 129-112 victory to 
try for 130 points, so fans would get free pizza, told the Nuggets not to play 
defense. With seconds left, Detroit turned over the ball to Elston Turner, who 
said he thought about shooting at the Pistons' basket. But he stopped, saying 
he didn't know how well it would go over with Moe. . . . When the Heat won its 
ninth game of the season, assuring Miami it wouldn't set a record for worst 
record in league history, Coach Ron Rothstein was asked where the victory 
ranked. "Right up there, with the other eight," he said.

Ronny Thompson needed to talk with his father, John, the basketball coach at 
Georgetown University. 
</P>
<P>
"It was about this time last year," recalled Ronny, whose skills as a 6-foot-4 
guard for Flint Hill Academy had grabbed the attention of many college coaches. 
"It was after our last game and coaches were starting to call." 
</P>
<P>
"Dad, I have to start making my visits." 
</P>
<P>
Laughter. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I'm serious. I want to make my visits and think about schools I'm going 
to." 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to do any of that." 
</P>
<P>
"What do you mean?" 
</P>
<P>
"I want you to come to Georgetown." 
</P>
<P>
Laughter. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he was kidding," recalled Ronny, the second of three children -- 
John III is 6-4 and graduated last year from Princeton after playing guard 
there for four seasons, and Tiffany, a 13 year old, at 6-1, seems to have 
inherited most of her 47-year-old father's 6-10 height. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since I was little," Ronny said, "I'd wanted to come to Georgetown and 
play for him, but he was always like, 'You're never going to come play for me, 
so get that thought out of your mind.' So, when he told me, 'I want you to come 
here,' I was like, 'No, Dad. Be serious. I'm trying to be serious and get this 
college stuff out of the way because coaches are starting to call.' 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'I am serious. I want you to come play with me. Give it some 
thought.' " 
</P>
<P>
The choice was not as easy as it seems. 
</P>
<P>
"Every other (Georgetown) player has an outlet," John III said. "They can get 
fed up. It happens to anybody who plays collegiate athletics. You get to that 
point where you need a break. You need to go and curse the coach out. You need 
to go and fuss about everybody on the team. You need to just go and cry. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going through the strain at school on the team and then have to come 
home and hear it more, it can get to be a problem. It can wear on you 
physically as well as mentally. Ronny realized that. Pops realized that." 
</P>
<P>
So did Gwendolyn Thompson, Pops' wife, and Mary Fenlon, Pops' academic 
coordinator at Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
Ronny said Mrs. Thompson was concerned mainly about the effect his 
matriculation at Georgetown would have on her family -- over which she has 
considerable influence. ("Moms is the boss of the house," John III said. "That 
tough-guy image is all a facade. Gwendolyn Thompson runs this household. If he 
gets out of line, she'll straighten him out.") 
</P>
<P>
Fenlon has equal influence on virtually all team affairs involving matters 
other than the technical aspects of the game. She does not talk to the media, 
but Ronny knows her concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it's hard on my teammates with my being around," Ronny said, "because a 
lot of times, they've had to censor what they say. And there are a lot of times 
when he's on us hard and you want to go up to the locker room after practice 
and just say whatever you want to about him. Or, they might want to say 
something or do something outside, and they may hesitate because they think I'm 
going to go back and tell my dad. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first got here, I could tell there was a lot of that going on. They 
would talk real quietly. But then when they got to know me better and know that 
I wasn't his little reporter running around telling everything they did, that 
worked out." 
</P>
<P>
Senior guard Bobby Winston said mischievously: "Ronny is no angel. He does 
stuff that anyone else in college would do. If he goes back, we have people who 
will know the things he's done, too. No problem there." 
</P>
<P>
Winston also said, "The coach gets on him as much as he gets on us." 
</P>
<P>
That's where Gwendolyn Thompson's concerns came in. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she kind of wanted me to go away," Ronny said. "I think she kind of 
thought that there were going to be problems. But so far everything has worked 
out fine." 
</P>
<P>
In part, that is because Ronny lives on campus. 
</P>
<P>
"But that was always the threat," he said with a laugh, " 'If you mess up, 
you're going to come back home.' " 
</P>
<P>
It's funny now, but in the early 1970s -- too long ago for Ronny to remember -- 
there was a young man named Donald Washington. At the time, John Thompson was 
coaching at St. Anthony's High School in Washington, D.C. Thompson had lured 
Washington to St. Anthony's from Bertie Backus Junior High School. Two years 
later, in 1970, Washington's mother died. Thompson became Washington's legal 
guardian. 
</P>
<P>
Washington was a terrific player. A 6-8 forward, he was two-time first-team 
All-Met and a high school all-American. He went on to attend North Carolina, 
where, as a sophomore, he averaged more than 21 points per game until he broke 
his foot. Grade trouble ensued and he went to Switzerland, where he played 
amateur basketball for a year before joining the ABA's Denver Nuggets. He later 
returned to Europe and played out his pro career in France, where he still 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, being a great basketball player for John Thompson while living in 
his house was no easy task. 
</P>
<P>
"You see, Donald was a star, and you're always on the star to do better," said 
Aaron Long, a teammate of Washington's for three years at St. Anthony's who 
later was Thompson's first recruit when Thompson left St. Anthony's for 
Georgetown. "Ronny's not being depended on to be the star. But Donald was the 
star. And I think, at times, the pressure at times got to Donald." 
</P>
<P>
Said Coach Thompson: "Donald's situation was a little bit different because he 
lived in the house. He had to hear about boxing out in the gym, at the dinner 
table and everywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
"Ronny doesn't have to hear that. It's not the way people feel that it is 
because he lives on the campus. If he lived at home, it would be a little bit 
different. Plus, I got a little bit familiar with what (coaching a son) would 
be like. That experience is not a new experience for me. But I feel good about 
what has happened. It's worked out much better than I thought it would." 
</P>
<P>
Ronny agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I thought there were going to be problems," he said, "but I feel 
everything has pretty much worked out. I can talk to him just like any son can 
talk to his father. I mean there is that balance between coach and father. 
There's a separation between the two. And that's worked out pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
So have things on the court. Going into the Hoyas' NCAA tournament East 
regional semifinal against North Carolina State on Friday night in East 
Rutherford, N.J., Ronny has played in 26 of Georgetown's 32 games. He has 
averaged only 1.8 points and 5.5 minutes per game, but when senior guard 
Charles Smith missed the March 5 game at Syracuse, Ronny played 18 minutes and 
scored 11 points, nine in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been confident in my ability," Ronny said. "But to be honest, I 
didn't think that I would do as well as I'm doing now." 
</P>
<P>
At first, Ronny didn't even know whether to address John as "Coach" or "Dad."

"I asked him that just before practice was going to begin back in October," 
Ronny said, "He looked at me like I was crazy. He said, 'I can't believe you 
even asked me that question. I'm your dad first. You should always call me 
that. I'll always be your father.' That was comforting." 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, Ronny's teammates joined in the fun. 
</P>
<P>
"They used to tease me," Ronny said. "A lot. Something would happen and they 
would go, 'Aaawww, dad. Aaawww, dad.' They still tease me about that off and 
on. If I have a problem, they say, 'Go see daddy. Go see daddy." 
</P>
<P>
For most of his life, it was a problem John III wanted to have. 
</P>
<P>
"Growing up in Washington, growing up in the same house, I grew up with 
Georgetown basketball," said John III, who now works in a Ford Motor Co. dealer 
training program. "Most of my life I could say that I wanted to go to 
Georgetown. That was the fantasy. That was the dream. But as you get older and 
you start to look at college with regard to where it will take you, I just 
thought for me, personally, it was best to go to Princeton. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to get away from home, to go somewhere else," said John III, who 
visited one school other than Princeton -- North Carolina. "But at the same 
time, basketball is an important part of my life and Princeton has a very good 
basketball program. I went to Princeton because I got a chance to go to a very 
good school that has a very good basketball program with a very good coach." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Pete Carril reminded John III of home. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the similarities between Coach Carril and Pops are, uh, well, 
they're incredible," John III said. "You would never realize that by looking at 
the type of game that both teams play. But what they demand, what they expect, 
what they require and how they treat their players is very similar. What 
players can get out of both programs is comparable also." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the similarity between Carril and his father was a reason he chose 
Princeton, John III replied, "It definitely was." 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Carril's very honest," John III said. "He has no problems telling you 
what he's thinking and how he's feeling, regardless of how it's going to hurt 
your feelings. You know where you stand. There's no pacifying of players, no 
telling you what you want to hear. He treats you as men and expects you to act 
like men. It definitely takes time getting used to, just like playing for Pops 
take time getting used to." 
</P>
<P>
Being John Thompson III is easy by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that he's a public figure and I'm his namesake, it's keyed right 
there," John III said. "But there have been a lot of things I've received and 
been blessed with because I'm his son. At the same time, there were some rough 
situations and some things I didn't get because I was his son. But it balances 
out, and that's my dad. I've been John Thompson III all my life and I wouldn't 
trade it with anybody."

IT'S SIMPLY NOT ALL HOG WILD FOR KENTUCKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN DENLINGER, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is one of those magical datelines: Lexington, Ky. For anyone who cares 
deeply about college basketball, it is something of a shrine. As serious 
golfers need to visit The Augusta National, as a baseball life is not quite 
complete without poking around Yankee Stadium and as football fanatics must 
explore Packer Country, more than four very good basketball teams are drawn to 
the University of Kentucky this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The fascination with Kentucky basketball is excess. Good and bad. No team in 
Division I history has won as many games (1,469 in 86 years) or amassed a 
higher winning percentage (75). From 1943 through 1955, or 129 games, the 
Wildcats did not lose at home. The five starters who helped win the 1948 NCAA 
championship also participated, as a unit, in the London Olympics and averaged 
more points themselves than all but one opponent scored in any game against the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
On the sour side, listed in the all-time records section along with so much 
glory, between a team that went 29-3 and another that was unbeaten in 25 games, 
is this: 
</P>
<P>
"1952-53 -- No Schedule 
</P>
<P>
"(Under suspension by NCAA)" 
</P>
<P>
During the early part of the point-shaving scandal about 40 years ago, oach 
Adolph Rupp boasted that gamblers couldn't get within "a 10-foot pole" of his 
players. Some did. Rupp may have run off better players than many coaches ever 
attract but was sinfully slow in recruiting blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Whispers among NCAA insiders the last 15 or so years were that Kentucky escaped 
probation not by being clean but because its methods of cheating were so 
sophisticated. Nobody will ever nail Kentucky, Jerry Tarkanian once cried. It's 
too big. Too sacred. 
</P>
<P>
As Virginia and Oklahoma, North Carolina and Michigan were arriving for the 
Southeast regional, Kentucky was reacting to the resignations earlier in the 
week of Coach Eddie Sutton and an assistant, Dwane Casey. And waiting to see 
how that impacts on NCAA enforcement of 18 charges against Wildcat basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, each of the schools involved in that regional has reason to examine 
Kentucky and learn something from it. Many Virginia fans, for instance, dream 
of the chance for an NCAA title more often than when a wonderchild (Ralph 
Sampson) happens to grow up at its doorstep. The bitterness and embarrassment 
evident in Lexington should cause renewed respect for Virginia's gentleman 
coach, Terry Holland. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan basketball is getting too much sympathy these days. The timing on Bill 
Frieder's jumping to Arizona State was terrible, but perhaps could not be 
avoided. Arizona State, after all, had a football coach snatched away by Ohio 
State a year ago at an inopportune time. And what of the mood at Michigan that 
caused Frieder to leave? 
</P>
<P>
Let's say Frieder did the morally proper thing, told Arizona State he could not 
disrupt his team at this critical moment. Let's say Arizona State, already 
jilted by Purdue's Gene Keady and recalling the football experience, simply 
wished Frieder well and grabbed somebody else. Frieder is left to endure all 
those can't-win-the-big-one taunts that would eventually erode his program. 
</P>
<P>
Better coaches than Frieder couldn't get past Dean Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Carolina slipped by Michigan in the NCAAs the last two seasons. Getting to the 
round of 16 last weekend enabled Smith to tie John Wooden for total career 
victories (667) and move within about eight seasons of Rupp's all-time mark of 
875. Smith's staggering success over 27 years allowed Carolina three seasons 
ago to match 23,000-seat Rupp Arena as a college showpiece. 
</P>
<P>
Smith has had Final Four teams in the '60s, the '70s and the '80s, having 
overcome an under-.500 record his first season and being just 35-27 after three 
years. He may well be the most cautious coach in all of college sport, but does 
leave clues about his success now and then. 
</P>
<P>
During the on-court celebration after Carolina won its 10th Atlantic Coast 
Conference tournament title under Smith, two weeks ago, the coach was given a 
long and affectionate ovation. As he walked back toward the bench, Smith 
suddenly affected a gunslinger in suit and tie, pointing a finger of each hand 
toward his players and mouthing: "Thank you. Thank you." 
</P>
<P>
Smith has the final word about everything but does allow his seniors 
considerable say in team policy. A former senior, Mitch Kupchak, said 
seldom-seen David May and the Tar Heel manager undoubtedly have as much input 
this season as stars Jeff Lebo and Steve Bucknall. 
</P>
<P>
"No one knows how he's stayed so competitive for so long, or how much longer 
he'll stay on," Kupchak said of Smith. "It might be one or two years; it might 
be five or 10." 
</P>
<P>
The fourth team in Lexington, Oklahoma, the one picked to leave victorious, 
also leans the most toward Kentucky-like excess. Coach Billy Tubbs dreams of 
the Sooners scoring 200 points in a game and refuses to lower his head an inch 
after keeping his starters on the court during 45-point victories. If 
Oklahomans ever grip basketball half as enthusiastically as they do football, 
some sort of Tubbs Tub will be built. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how exciting the games, thoughts this week in Lexington and elsewhere 
about college basketball ought to include a once-gifted player and the man who, 
20 years ago, inherited him his first season as a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
The player was Cyril Baptiste, whose talent and drug-related sadness were 
enormous. Those near him, including the young coach, suspected Baptiste played 
his sophomore and junior seasons at Creighton on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was shooting heroin," Baptiste later said, "that's all I thought about. 
... The school carried me through on some grades, especially when I got strung 
out." 
</P>
<P>
"I probably will never get another ballplayer with that much ability," said the 
young and ambitious Creighton coach, Eddie Sutton.

VIRGINIA'S PRESENCE IN FINAL EIGHT IS NO FLUKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

LEXINGTON, Ky. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the sort of tap-tap roll that eventually builds to a triumphal 
crescendo for Virginia: fairly early in the second half, mighty Oklahoma starts 
a run that creates a three-point lead. Instead of hurrying next time down the 
court, the Cavaliers take it sloooow and easy. 
</P>
<P>
Patiently, Virginia runs the clock down, but Richard Morgan misses. As would 
happen surprisingly often, the Cavaliers get the rebound and go into another 
semi-stall, this time getting two points on Bryant Stith free throws. 
</P>
<P>
And so it went. The clever counterpunchers knocked out a heavyweight, although 
no basketball Mike Tyson, Thursday night. Although startling, Virginia's 
six-point victory was no fluke. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like we were seeded way down," coach Terry Holland reminded those 
bent on David-slays-Goliath angles. The Cavaliers' fifth seed, after all, meant 
NCAA handicappers figured them among the 20 best teams in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that is why Holland stayed on his chair and calmly applauded pull-ahead 
free throws in the final seconds, seemingly no more excited than at the end of 
a predictable film. 
</P>
<P>
Truth is, the upset had gone as scripted. Unheralded Cavaliers inside players 
did a splendid defensive job on Stacey King the first half. Holland gambled the 
Sooners would bomb out on their three-point bombs -- and won. 
</P>
<P>
The players were more playful at game's end. Before one of the major heroes, 
John Crotty, went to the line for the final foul shots, freshman sensation 
Stith jumped toward sharpshooter Morgan, who slapped hands with anyone close. 
</P>
<P>
Even director Holland could not have imagined these halftime numbers: one 
basket and one rebound for all-American center King; six points and six 
rebounds for Cavaliers center Brent Dabbs. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at the stat sheet, it might not seem so," said Virginia point 
guard Crotty. "But our inside men did a great job. Stopping King (until late in 
the second half). Cleaning the glass in both halves really well." 
</P>
<P>
Much better was another OU all-American, Mookie Blaylock, missing nearly 
everything he launched. That was before a collision near the end of the first 
half that caused him to play with one eye half shut in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't seem that different (after the injury)," Crotty said. "It was tough 
for him to get into the flow." 
</P>
<P>
Crotty was a major reason. 
</P>
<P>
"(Blaylock) makes a pass out front, then goes through and usually scores (from 
the baseline) on a return pass. I tried to deny that pass." 
</P>
<P>
This was something the stat sheet also failed to show -- Crotty's keen defense. 
Which elevated him even more, what with those eight assists and breaking the 
Sooners' full-court press often and routinely. 
</P>
<P>
Typical was Crotty bursting through a double team after getting an inbouds pass 
and blowing by Blaylock near midcourt, driving toward the basket and drawing a 
two-shot foul. 
</P>
<P>
Also on display regularly was Stith, who showed uncommon maturity on inside 
postups against larger Sooners. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to settle for turnaround jump shots," Holland said. "We wanted 
to get a shoulder by 'em. If we can slide by 'em, there's a good chance for an 
offensive rebound." 
</P>
<P>
Or some foul shots, the Sooners playing grab-grab too often when a Dabbs or 
Matt Blundin would slip inside for an offensive rebound. As Holland had hoped, 
his version of Blaylock was accurate enough at critical times. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Morgan missed more than half his shots for the game. But when two points 
would be more than useful, Morgan nailed a three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to look for an excuse to take Richard and John out of the game," 
Holland admitted. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma eventually worked the ball to King the second half -- and gained a 
72-69 lead. Once more, Virginia failed to get giddy -- and Morgan immediately 
hit a trey. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't looking for a three," Holland said. "But Richard was." 
</P>
<P>
He always is. 
</P>
<P>
Even Morgan stayed on a reasonably tight rein at important times. The Sooners 
tried to lure such as Morgan into two-one-one situations off the press that 
King could handle himself. It worked a couple of times. 
</P>
<P>
As almost always happened, Morgan or Stith would move toward King, than back 
off and get the ball to the calm and surehanded Crotty. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at the stage where we can play anywhere," said Crotty, still 
appreciative that Michigan and North Carolina fans joined Cavaliers crazies as 
the upset became more and more evident. Several seconds before the final 
buzzer, Rupp Arena was abuzz with: "ACC ... ACC ... ACC." 
</P>
<P>
Also, Virginians could not resist this dig at OU coach Billy Tubbs, who had 
allowed his team to run up a 48-point victory early last season. 
</P>
<P>
"Good job, Billy," came a wave of sarcasm. "Goog job, Billy." 
</P>
<P>
That was shortly after this bit of heart-stabbing from little Crotty and 
Blundin at another critical point. Crotty moved toward the right baseline and a 
couple of Sooners leaped to trap him. 
</P>
<P>
What happened made it seem as though Crotty planned the trouble so he could 
execute the marvelous escape that followed. Slick as can be, he whipped a 
bounce pass between some Sooners legs and the baseline, to the very open 
Blundin for a layup. 
</P>
<P>
"We isolated certain guys at certain times," Morgan said. But always in a 
wonderfully coordinated way.

STANICEK KNOWS WHAT HE MUST DO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LITTWIN, Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MIAMI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Inscribed on the back of Pete Stanicek's T-shirt are these words: "Just Do It." 
</P>
<P>
If only it were that easy. 
</P>
<P>
For most of spring training, all Stanicek has done is laps in the whirlpool, 
where he has nursed one injury or another, not the least of them to his psyche. 
At least, while in the tub, he doesn't have to listen to suggestions that he is 
a college-boy wimp who can't play with pain. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball, like most businesses, is a fairly unforgiving institution, and among 
the worst sins a player can commit is to be injured, especially when no bones 
are showing. 
</P>
<P>
"Some guys will drag a leg out there," says Frank Robinson, the man who will 
determine Stanicek's immediate future. "These are the guys we call gamers. You 
love that attitude, for selfish reasons. But a manager has to be selfish. 
</P>
<P>
"Billy Ripken, I think he'd go out there with a broken leg. He's the kind of 
guy you have to say, 'Billy, you can't play until they take the cast off.' " 
</P>
<P>
Billy Ripken is the Orioles' incumbent at second base, the position Stanicek 
was expected to challenge for this spring. If Ripken is the kind of player who 
would run through a brick wall, Stanicek, the Stanford graduate, would climb a 
ladder over the wall and twist his knee in the process, putting him on the 
disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what people say," Stanicek says. "They wonder if I'm tough enough. Only 
I know inside how I feel and how my leg is. If someone says I'm not tough 
enough or I don't play hurt, it's hard to change their minds. But, believe me, 
as soon as I can play, I'll be out there, giving it everything I've got." 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Stanicek suffered a broken wrist, and, since that point, he has had 
one injury after another, evoking memories of former Oriole Fred Lynn. When 
Stanicek's wrist was hurt last year, the talk began. Why wasn't it healing? Why 
wasn't it healing much faster? This spring, he began with a bad back and, that 
cured, moved on to the hamstring pull that has him, well, hamstrung. 
</P>
<P>
The hamstring has been a week-long affair and figures to last maybe a week 
more. 
</P>
<P>
How hurt is hurt? Managers are reliably unsympathetic on this subject. Though 
Robinson says he understands that if a player says he's hurt that he's hurt, he 
adds this: 
</P>
<P>
"Some guys play through pain. Some guys can't. In this game, you have to play 
less than 100% if you want to make a career out of it." 
</P>
<P>
He also says that if Stanicek isn't ready to play second base soon, he can 
forget the position for the near future, leaving him the outfield and 
designated hitter as possibilities. With Ripken hitting .200, Stanicek 
understands his inability to get out on the field is an opportunity missed. 
</P>
<P>
"I need the time to judge him," Robinson says. "It wouldn't be fair to the team 
otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, his teammates wonder what his problem really is, and Stanicek, who 
was never injured before last year, is getting pretty upset about the talk and 
its implications for him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm kidded all the time," he says. "It's frustrating. I try not to take it too 
seriously, but it's easy for someone who's not hurt to say, 'I've played hurt 
before. I'd be out there.' But they don't know to what extent you're hurt. Only 
you know that. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe if I had a three-year contract, I could sit on an injury. But I don't. 
I'm trying to make the team and get a career going. It would make no sense for 
me to sit down. But people still think I should be out there. If I don't play, 
I'm going back to Rochester. I don't want to go back to Triple-A. I know I can 
play in the big leagues. It does me no good to sit in here. It's as simple as 
that. There's no other way to explain it." 
</P>
<P>
Where he is sitting is in the Orioles clubhouse. It's a lively place this 
season, full of bright, new faces and young promise. For this spring, at least, 
it's great once again to be young and to be an Oriole. Stanicek, 25, is young, 
and he has speed and can switch hit and plays the outfield and second base, 
meaning he should be one of the youngsters who figure to get a chance. 
</P>
<P>
He has motive and opportunity, but he can't seem to pull the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
A bright young man, Stanicek certainly understands the stakes. His life, to 
this point, has been a steady pursuit of the game he loves, and to suggest he 
wouldn't give himself every chance to take the next step would seem, on the 
face of it, pure folly. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Orioles are loath to waste a spot on the roster to 
someone they wonder if they can rely on. A year ago, the then-lumbering Orioles 
were begging for someone with speed. This year, the Orioles can probably field 
a better relay team than baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we were desperate for a leadoff hitter," Robinson says. "We're not 
in that situation any more." 
</P>
<P>
So it comes down to these few questions: Will Stanicek be ready in time? And if 
he does get ready, will he stay ready? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I think I'm tough enough." Stanicek says.

HORN POSES A DILEMMA FOR RED SOX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE BUCKLEY, The Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WINTER HAVEN, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the early days of spring training, when Wade vs. Margo was still the only 
big story for the Boston Red Sox, Sam Horn could come and go at his leisure 
without attracting much attention. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the man looks great, everyone agreed. Horn had used his winter to 
transform himself, dropping 17 pounds from his beefy frame. Then he broke out 
his rarely trusty first baseman's mitt, and, surprise of surprises, he was 
picking balls out of the dirt and, even more surprising, backhanding hard 
grounders down the line. 
</P>
<P>
"When he showed up here, his chances of making the team were nil, absolutely 
nil," Red Sox General Manager Lou Gorman said. "We had a lot of roster 
decisions to make for the 1989 season, but I think our decision had been made 
with Sam." 
</P>
<P>
And now? 
</P>
<P>
"Now," said Gorman, "you have to take a look at him. Everything he has done 
this spring has made us take notice of him." 
</P>
<P>
Red Sox Manager Joe Morgan took it a step further: "I just have a feeling that 
Sam Horn is going to become a real good hitter," Morgan said. "He's made a 
believer out of me to this day." Asked if he was a believer when spring 
training began, Morgan answered, "No." 
</P>
<P>
The Sam Horn Comeback was a day-long success Monday, beginning with a "B" game 
at Yawkey Field in which Horn hit a two-run homer in a 3-1 victory over the 
Kansas City Royals. In the afternoon main attraction at Chain O' Lakes Park, 
Horn slammed an Ed Olwine pitch down the right-field line and thundered into 
third with a triple. Thanks to an Ed Romero home run in the bottom of the 11th, 
the game labored through 13 innings before both the Red Sox and Royals called 
it quits with a 7-7 tie. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Red Sox are understandably delighted to see Horn in shape and in a 
groove, but it means their roster decisions will be weighty ones. Where at one 
time the only Horn decision to make was whether to trade him or send him back 
to triple-A, the Red Sox now have three decisions -- a trade, the minor 
leagues, or the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Each decision has its whys and wherefores. If the Red Sox dump Horn, might they 
one day regret having given away another good young hitter a la Ben Oglivie or 
Cecil Cooper? If they decide to farm out Horn, who is out of options, will he 
be able to clear waivers? And there is this: if they keep him on the 24-man 
roster, how will they find room for him? 
</P>
<P>
One idea would be to scrap the Kevin Romine-Randy Kutcher battle for the 24th 
spot on the roster. Both are right-handed hitting outfielders who can run, and 
Kutcher plays some third. But both are being groomed as third-string catchers 
in the event Morgan needs a catcher in the late innings of a game, and the 
manager intends to stay with that idea. 
</P>
<P>
"At no time," Morgan said, "will I get into a situation where I have to put 
someone behind the plate who's never played there. To me, if we had to do it 
once all season, that would be too much." 
</P>
<P>
So Romine or Kutcher will be on the team. Morgan seems to favor Kutcher. Gorman 
seems to favor Romine, saying of Kutcher Monday, "He was just a .230 (actually 
.233) hitter at Pawtucket last year." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Rice, who hit his third home run of the spring Monday, is a lock to make 
the team. So, too, is professional substitute Danny Heep, whom Morgan likes. 
Given that another spot must be kept for a backup catcher (Rick Cerone or, 
possibly, John Marzano) and another for a back-up middle infielder (Romero or 
Luis Rivera) there is only one spot for Horn -- Carlos Quintana's spot. 
</P>
<P>
Quintana has also been a hot hitter in spring training, going 1 for 1 in the 
"B" game Monday and 2 for 3 in the main game. Morgan has been saying that he'd 
rather have Quintana on his big-league bench than playing every day in the 
minors. Of course keeping Horn and sending Quintana down removes a right-handed 
bat from the bench, but said, "We don't pinch hit that much anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Gorman won't commit himself to any Sam Horn trade possibilities. Asked if the 
Red Sox had received any offers for Horn, the general manager likes to say, 
"We've received offers on a lot of our players." 
</P>
<P>
But, hinted Morgan, "Who knows what's going to happen between now and the end 
of spring training? I might have to make a decision, but, then again, maybe the 
decision will make itself. 
</P>
<P>
"But I do know that Horn has been impressive," Morgan said. "His approach to 
pitches is what I'm looking at, and I don't see him swinging at pitches down in 
the dirt, except maybe a couple of low curves."

THE FAMILY HOME SITS ON AN UNFAIR TAX BASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bill Stall, Bill Stall is a Times editorial writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
California's property tax counterrevolution should have occurred one day during 
the last four or five years. That day was when a majority of homeowners woke up 
to realize that they constituted a class of citizens paying higher property 
taxes than everyone else. Everyone else belonged to the privileged shrinking 
minority able to reap the full advantage of Proposition 13 merely by not 
moving. 
</P>
<P>
Up to now, barely a shot has been fired, let alone a counterrevolution. The 
major threat to the state's Proposition 13 property tax law is a legal one, and 
at this moment, still relatively remote. But there is considerable anxiety 
about what might happen to the property tax system should an anti-Proposition 
13 case make its way to the U.S. Supreme Court -- and succeed -- as did a 
recent, similar West Virginia lawsuit. For many people, the prospect of 
certainty -- even unpleasant certainty -- is preferable to chaos. 
</P>
<P>
While a federal constitutional test of Proposition 13 is not just around the 
corner, the threat of legal challenge causes stirrings among two groups of 
people. First are those officials who have believed all along that something 
must be done to eliminate, or at least reduce, the inequity between two classes 
of taxpayers in California. They dared not try because of swift and sure 
political retribution for anyone tinkering with Proposition 13. Second are 
those who think California must be ready to preserve some property tax limits 
in case the law is overturned in court. 
</P>
<P>
There never has been any lack of complaint about the inequities of the system 
created by the proposition passed in the June, 1978, election. Anyone who 
bought a home in California after adoption of Article XIIIA of the state 
Constitution has some sort of horror story about the disparity between his tax 
bill and a neighbor's. The newcomer to the block could find a property tax bill 
five or more times that of a neighbor's, even if the houses were identical and 
worth the same on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone pays the same tax rate, 1% of assessed value. The difference is that 
the low-tax neighbor has stayed in the same house since 1978; thus, the home's 
assessed value remains unchanged except for a 2% annual increase applied to 
everyone. The stay-putters now are in the minority, their numbers down to 
barely 40% in Los Angeles County and even lower in other fast-developing areas 
throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The home buyer triggers a reassessment through purchase. The sale price 
automatically becomes the new assessment. Under Proposition 13, property in 
California is reassessed only when it changes ownership or undergoes 
substantial reconstruction. In more than two-thirds of the other 49 states, 
property tax assessments are reviewed every one to five years, to keep current 
with actual home values. But the premise of Proposition 13 is that houses 
should be taxed primarily on their worth at the time of purchase -- and not on 
the paper value created by rampant housing inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The problem for those who would like to foment revolution is that once the home 
buyer remains at the same address for a year or so, he or she is susceptible to 
becoming a convert. The tax on a house bought for $200,000 the first year will 
be $2,000, all other things being equal. The tax the next year will be no more 
than $2,040. The longer the owner stays put, the greater the benefits relative 
to those who bought later. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are two distinct classes of homeowners in California based on an 
arbitrary declaration of law. Even if Proposition 13 survives court challenges, 
that is poor public policy. One of the major tenets of a "good" tax is that it 
be applied fairly. The inequity of Proposition 13 is compounded in growing 
areas where local governments impose fees on developers to pay for streets, 
schools and other facilities. The fees, lumped into the new house sale price, 
average about $12,000. They constitute an indirect tax to help make up for the 
loss of property tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Another argument for change is the widespread perception that businesses have 
benefitted disproportionately from Proposition 13. This theory maintains that 
businesses change ownership less often than homes and therefore remain at the 
lower tax level. State tax officials, however, claim turnover is just about the 
same in residential and commercial property. In Los Angeles County, 40.4% of 
all homes have not been reassessed since Proposition 13, compared with 43.2% of 
all commercial property. 
</P>
<P>
But one state study indicated that in the first five years after Proposition 
13, businesses realized two-thirds of the property tax relief. In San 
Francisco, the assessor's office says that 1,900 business properties out of the 
city's total 163,000 parcels accounted for more than $11 billion in assessments 
-- more than one-third the total. While in pure numbers, commercial property 
may be turning over about as fast as homes, many large businesses benefited 
more in dollar volume because they accounted for a greater portion of the tax 
base. . 
</P>
<P>
One proposed change is to create a split roll with residences on one assessment 
list and commercial property on another. More revenues could be raised by 
assessing businesses at a higher rate. Fifteen states have such a system. 
</P>
<P>
This plan (once on the same ballot as Proposition 13 in a rival package 
proposed by the Legislature) would not by itself eliminate the disparity 
between groups of homeowners. While stay-putters now are in a minority, it 
would be politically impossible at this point to close the gap by raising their 
taxes significantly and/or cutting the taxes of later home purchasers. Any 
change in Proposition 13 requires approval at a statewide election. 
</P>
<P>
To reduce all property taxes to the 1975 level (Proposition 13 rolled back 
assessments to that base year) would be prohibitively costly. Property taxes 
still raise more than $12 billion a year in California, most of it supporting 
city and county government. One suggestion is to increase the current 
homeowner's tax exemption for newer homeowners. The existing senior citizens' 
property tax relief program could be expanded to protect older Californians 
living on fixed incomes. Lost revenue would have to be replaced from some other 
tax source. 
</P>
<P>
Another method would be to allow assessments of stay-putters' homes to grow at 
a slightly-faster rate than the present maximum 2%, but to keep them capped at 
a reasonable level. This would protect taxpayers from surprise escalations of 
the sort that touched off the property tax rebellion of the late 1960s and 
early 1970s. The equity gap would be closed over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Fairness and common sense dictate that some attempt be made to equalize the tax 
load between new home buyers in California and those who have been content to 
remain in the same houses since 1978 -- including those whose professions do 
not require them, or entice them, to move. 
</P>
<P>
For all its faults, Proposition 13 has been immensely popular because it brings 
stability and certainty to the property tax system. Any reform must protect 
seniors and others who can least afford to keep up with soaring property taxes. 
Politically, the reformers will have to convince a majority of California 
voters that the proposed changes will give them a better deal. That will be a 
tough sell.

CALIFORNIA'S TOMORROW: A NEW SYSTEM OF VALUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

California Through the 1920s, to be published this fall (Oxford). This article 
is adapted from an address to the California Taxpayers Assn.

<TEXT>
<P>
Values flow beneath the surface of our consciousness like great Pacific 
currents. Nothing cuts more directly to this vast inner realm of choice than 
the question of taxation. 
</P>
<P>
Money is one of the two or three great and powerful mysteries of human culture. 
In social and political terms, money raised from taxes emerges as the most 
powerful force we own and administer in common. Alexander Hamilton saw this 
from one perspective. The power to tax, he said, is the power to govern. 
</P>
<P>
Thus when we Californians tax one another through legitimate agencies of 
government, we express the profundity of the ties that bind us together. 
Without money, without taxes, there is no res publica, no public thing, no 
common identity or commonweal. The old-fashioned English word commonwealth 
expresses this point perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
In California this question of "common wealth" has an even more powerful 
valence because we are a complex, multi-ethnic society. We constitute, in fact, 
what might very well be the first successful polycultural commonwealth in these 
United States -- a commonwealth that takes no one ethnic or cultural tradition 
as its preemptive norm but seeks instead to empower social and political 
structures that function efficiently on behalf of all individuals and all 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of lessons from the past, the relationship between value and taxation 
in California is fascinating. It also holds a few surprises. California, for 
instance, woefully underfunded education, especially secondary education, in 
the middle and late-middle 19th Century. Not until the 1890s was there anything 
resembling a flourishing high school system in place. Americans of that era 
tended to leave school after the primary grades. 
</P>
<P>
And 19th-Century Californians were also slow to spend proper funds on flood 
control. Prof. Robert Kelly of UC Santa Barbara, in his forthcoming book, 
"Battling the Inland Sea," writes about how state engineer William Hammond Hall 
struggled unsuccessfully in the 1880s to encourage a workable statewide water 
plan. Only by the late 19th Century did it finally dawn on the political 
community that water was the paramount public issue facing the state. Even 
then, it took another two decades and more before anything truly creative was 
done about it. 
</P>
<P>
Twentieth-Century California reversed itself on water and education. By the 
1960s, in fact, we had largely defined public state culture in terms of the 
excellence of the statewide water program, educational system and highways. 
</P>
<P>
These programs -- water, education and highways -- were empowered by vision and 
values. Each served the creation of California as a mega-state with a 
population moving toward 25 million. The heroes of this era were creating a 
society that could support a large educated population, with a level of 
physical mobility unprecedented in any previous culture -- a mobility, in fact, 
making automobiles and freeways the very symbols of a new world called 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Crime and social deviance was the exception in that era; today they become 
increasingly the rule. We plan vast prison systems and we raise the money 
through bond issues to build them without even allowing ourselves the luxury of 
lamenting the crime waves that make all this necessary. As I understand it, 
California has a higher portion of its population in prison than any other 
commonwealth on the planet. Our predecessors planned for the future; we are 
forced to plan for the social disaster of crime and its aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
We are also beset by the necessity of responding, through tax-supported 
programs, to other socially catastrophic problems: drugs; the breakdown of the 
family; the epidemic of violence including sexual abuse against children; the 
social effects of alcoholism ranging from deaths on the highways to industrial 
accidents to declining productivity; the increase of the severely mentally 
disturbed howling on our streets, and the new phenomenon, homelessness, 
displaying an intensity of visible suffering and disorder unprecedented since 
the long lines of the Great Depression. 
</P>
<P>
A recent report in San Francisco newspapers describes how the social effects of 
crack, joining with the health-care costs of the AIDS epidemic, could possibly 
bankrupt the city. Neither crack nor acquired immune deficiency syndrome were 
even heard of 10 years ago, and yet today they pose a substantial social and 
economic threat. 
</P>
<P>
As a taxpayer I have my own shopping list of values. First, I believe there 
resides in most California taxpayers a pervasive suspicion of large-scale 
public works or bureaucratic structures as solutions to problems. Thus we can 
expect to see taxpayer resistence to the construction of the peripheral canal 
as a solution to the state's water problem; to the construction of a massive 
multi-billion-dollar public transit system or heroic augmentation of existing 
highways as a solution to gridlock in Southern California and elsewhere; to the 
construction of block public housing; to the construction of more and more 
buildings as a solution to educational problems; to the construction of more 
and more prisons as protection against crime. 
</P>
<P>
One can expect, rather, an emphasis on programs as opposed to construction, 
solutions based on more sophisticated software as opposed to further hardware. 
Thus water-use patterns will be dramatically modified through tax penalties and 
incentives. Thus a process already under way -- the alignment of job sites and 
housing sites -- together with tax and toll systems will be used to ease the 
transportation crisis. 
</P>
<P>
In education, we will be emphasizing classroom discipline, student/teacher 
contracts with incentives and enforced penalties, parental responsibility and 
right of review, better teacher salaries and incentives as opposed to the 
construction of more buildings. In housing, more and more incentives will be 
given to developers who create affordable rental housing on unused sites 
adjacent to public transportation, on marginal properties near industrial parks 
or on metropolitan properties under public jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
In the matter of crime, we will have reached the physical limits of 
prison-building and prison capacity in the early 21st Century. There will 
therefore be an emphasis on longer sentences for the violent -- the relatively 
small group that repeatedly commits the truly terrible crimes -- and a growing 
use of community-sponsored public service and work programs for first-time 
offenders. Victims of adult crime will be awarded major financial indemnities 
from those who have abused them. Lifetime liens against income will become part 
of sentencing. Crime, in other words, will cease to be a free ride for the 
criminal. 
</P>
<P>
An emphasis on programmatic responses is based on a growing awareness, among 
liberals and conservatives alike, of the limitations of government. Again, if 
government were the solution, California would be Utopia; for we Californians 
support, in comparative terms, the most developed government infrastructure in 
the United States. We are, in fact, the most governed state in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Because each individual will be expected to put more effort into his or her own 
personal survival, the disposition to favor one or another targeted social 
group for special consideration will come under assault. With the exception of 
a growing bias in favor of children -- the most defenseless victims of poverty, 
crime and social misbehavior -- there will be a growing tendency toward a 
philosophy of equity cutting across ethnic groups and generations. This will 
not involve a philosophy of indifference or racial intolerance. It will, 
rather, be an increasing realization that Americans cannot sort themselves out 
from each other on the basis of race, creed or generation. 
</P>
<P>
We must struggle to be fair, finding ways to reward positive behavior in every 
sector of our culture. We will no longer take social misbehavior as the norm; 
instead we will regard all the peoples of California as equally capable of good 
and bad behavior. Thus we will cease to pay for programs out of guilt and start 
to pay for programs that work. 
</P>
<P>
California, in other words, the first true multicultural commonwealth on the 
planet, might be the first state to accept in its private values and public 
policies the full terror and glory of equality among its individual citizens. 
</P>
<P>
We will continue our bias toward the environment; for Californians, the 
environment has been a primary icon of identity since the days of John Muir. On 
the other hand, we will harmonize environmentalism with a program of proper 
growth, for we will have long since realized that a total no-growth philosophy 
represents violent injustice against aspiring minorities today and future 
generations of all ethnic backgrounds. Only dead entities cease to be nurtured 
and to grow. The current no-growth philosophy is based, simultaneously, on a 
massive selfishness and despair: selfishness regarding others who are not so 
prosperous, despair of our ability to find and enforce solutions that allow for 
growth that respects the environment. Thus California's already flourishing 
interplay of nature and technology, high-tech and high touch, will continue to 
flourish as a value system affecting the way we raise and spend our taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Hope for a larger measure of human happiness is, after all, the fundamental 
energy source for the California Dream. California is not just anywhere.

"They say that power corrupts," a political consultant observed, "but the lack 
of power corrupts too." 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats have been the majority party in the House of Representatives for 
35 years. Holding power for so long has made them arrogant and corrupt, the 
theory goes. Look at Speaker of the House Jim Wright (D-Tex.). He is the 
subject of a nine-month investigation by the House ethics committee, the 
results of which are due to be released early next month. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the aisle, House Republicans have become frustrated and 
demoralized after 35 years in the minority. The GOP leadership is ideologically 
corrupt, many younger Republicans feel. They criticize Minority Leader Robert 
H. Michel (R-Ill.) for being too accommodating. He makes deals with Democrats 
and takes whatever crumbs they are willing to offer. Last week, House 
Republicans repudiated Michel's approach by rejecting his candidate for 
minority whip, the second-ranking GOP leadership position. Instead, they chose 
Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), whose style is anything but accommodating. 
</P>
<P>
People have raised questions about death and taxes, but you can always count on 
a Democratic majority in the House. According to one favorite Washington story, 
the Almighty becomes upset about the terrible state of affairs in the world. So 
He decides to do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
The Lord appears before British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and asks, 
"What can I do to make the world better?" She replies, "You can figure out a 
solution to the troubles in Northern Ireland." God considers her request and 
says, "That is a difficult problem. It will take some time to resolve. But I 
can promise you a solution by the year 2025." On hearing that, Thatcher weeps. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Lord appears before Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and asks, 
"What can I do to make the world better?" Shamir answers, "You can find a 
solution to the Palestinian problem." God ponders this and says, "I can do 
that. But it will take a long time. I can promise you a solution by 2040." And 
Shamir weeps. 
</P>
<P>
Finally the Lord appears before President Bush and asks, "What can I do to make 
the world better?" Bush thinks about the question and replies, "The United 
States is the world's last great hope of freedom, but we cannot govern 
ourselves as long as we have a Republican President and a Democratic Congress. 
Maybe you can figure out some way for the GOP to gain control of the House." 
</P>
<P>
And the Lord weeps. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans have not given up the faith, however. The Lord works in mysterious 
ways, and right now, He has cast a pall of gloom over the Democrats. "We're all 
very depressed," said one House Democrat. "It's like a morgue." 
</P>
<P>
The immediate cause of Democratic depression is the Wright matter. The issue is 
so sensitive that the ethics committee decided not to release its report -- 
rumored to be more than 450 pages -- until after the Easter recess. Democrats 
did not want to go home to their districts and face a firestorm of criticism 
over Wright. 
</P>
<P>
If the committee finds that Wright violated House rules, even if it recommends 
no more than a reprimand -- the mildest punishment -- Wright is probably 
finished as Speaker. What if the report merely criticizes him for using poor 
judgment but finds that he did not break the rules? He's still in big trouble. 
As one congressman put it, "You can't have a 450-page report written about you 
and expect to be exonerated." 
</P>
<P>
Talk to Democrats in Congress and you will hear a constant refrain: "I'm not 
walking the plank for Jim Wright." This is partly -- but only partly -- due to 
the lack of esteem in which Wright is held by his colleagues. Many criticize 
his leadership. They resent the way Wright handled the congressional pay raise 
issue earlier this year. Instead of protecting members, he caved in to public 
pressure and allowed a vote. Many members plan to return the favor by forcing a 
vote on him. 
</P>
<P>
But there is another, more important, reason why Wright is in so much trouble. 
The environment of congressional politics has changed. There is no such thing 
as insider politics any more. Politics is now an outsiders' game. "You can't 
bury the committee report," said one congressman. "Not after what happened to 
Gary Hart and John Tower." 
</P>
<P>
Under the new political rules, everything is public -- and fair game. Wright 
didn't play by the new rules. That's why he got into trouble. Gingrich was one 
of the first congressmen to understand and exploit the new rules. That's why he 
has been vaulted into a position of leadership. 
</P>
<P>
The things Wright did were more or less accepted under the old rules. He had a 
friend publish a collection of his speeches and then sell the book to 
supporters and lobbyists under an arrangement involving unusually high 
royalties. He intervened with bank regulators on behalf of Texas 
savings-and-loan institutions. He accepted favors from a developer in his 
district. In Lyndon B. Johnson's day, you could get away with those things. 
</P>
<P>
But in LBJ's day, a politician could also drink and womanize and not expect 
anyone to care unless it interfered with his work. No more. Tower represents a 
turning point in congressional politics, just as Hart represented a turning 
point in presidential politics. 
</P>
<P>
Hart and Tower destroyed any remaining barriers between public and private 
behavior. There was no "smoking gun" in the Hart and Tower cases. They didn't 
get Hart and Tower on dereliction of duty. They got them on "judgment." 
</P>
<P>
These days, if you want to run for office or accept a position of public trust, 
everything is relevant. Your moral, medical, legal and financial background, 
even your college records, are subject to public scrutiny. In the old days, the 
scrutiny was done in private, and certain transgressions could be considered 
irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
But look at the kinds of questions you have to answer today in order to be 
eligible for a presidential appointment: Have you ever had psychological 
counseling? Have you used any illegal substance, including marijuana, since age 
18? Not that going to a marriage counselor or smoking pot in college makes you 
unfit for public service, but such revelations might embarrass the President. 
</P>
<P>
Wright feels confident that he did not violate House rules. "The main thing is, 
in my case, I just haven't paid any attention to my personal finances," he said 
last week. This is his way of explaining it. 
</P>
<P>
The congressman who initially raised questions about Wright's ethics was none 
other than Gingrich. He called Wright "the most corrupt Speaker in the 20th 
Century" and said he typified the venal, arrogant Democratic rule of Congress. 
Gingrich demanded a committee investigation, and the result was "a fishing 
expedition that caught a whale." 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich has never been an inside player. But he is a master of outside 
politics. Here is how Congressional Quarterly describes him: "He has made his 
name as the ringleader of a band of junior Republicans who perfected . . . a 
brash political strategy for coping with their minority status in the House: 
confronting and harassing the Democrats rather than negotiating with them." In 
other words, taking it to the streets. 
</P>
<P>
As GOP consultant Charles R. Black Jr. said, "Newt wakes up in the morning and 
the first thing he thinks about is how to become the majority party." 
</P>
<P>
One tactic is to go after the Democrats on issues such as pay raises and 
honorariums. Expose the House leadership as corrupt and tyrannical. Not only 
did Gingrich score a direct hit against Wright, several years ago he managed to 
humiliate Speaker Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill Jr., by having him ruled out of order 
on the House floor. The younger Republicans loved it. The Democratic 
Establishment was indignant. Now they are terrified.

<P>
Gingrich's objective is to carry on an ideological battle with Democrats. The 
reason is simple: Democrats lose ideological battles. That's how George Bush 
beat Michael S. Dukakis last year. Republicans are frustrated because Democrats 
at state and local level seem able to immunize themselves from ideological 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich wants to break down their immunity. His allies in this ideological 
offensive are Lee Atwater, chairman of the Republican National Committee, and 
Edward J. Rollins, head of the National Republican Congressional Committee. 
Their tactic is to expose Democrats as liberals -- in Congress and at home. 
</P>
<P>
While Democrats are masters of inside politics, they are not so good at outside 
politics. Republicans are the ones with great communication skills. Democrats 
know how to make deals. Republicans know they can't win the Democrats' game, so 
they play a new game. 
</P>
<P>
That's why something strange seems to be happening to House Democrats. They 
think about their future under Wright and Gingrich. And the Democrats weep.

INDIA'S DEMOCRACY COULD COME OF AGE WITH EMERGENCE OF EFFECTIVE OPPOSITION

<P>
Since India was born as a democracy 40 years ago, it has been ruled by the 
Congress Party, usually enjoying an imposing majority in the Parliament. With a 
monopoly of power comes a potential for abuse. Democracy suffers because of a 
lack of serious legislative restraint on the ruling party. In the past 20 
years, successive anti-civil-liberty measures have been passed in Parliament by 
an overwhelming majority. 
</P>
<P>
The most notorious was the Defamation Bill enacted last September. The law 
would have destroyed freedom of the press. Fortunately, the government finally 
withdrew the measure in the face of press opposition, supported by the 
intelligentsia and the electorate at large. Perhaps the pendulum now swings the 
other way. 
</P>
<P>
The future of Indian democracy depends upon the emergence of an organized, 
effective opposition to the party in power. And this may finally happen, as 
indicated by events in outlying states. 
</P>
<P>
Madras is about 2,000 kilometers south of Delhi; politically and 
psychologically it is much further away. The two cities had lived with each 
other for decades in a comfortable political isolation. They cannot any longer, 
for Madras now has a government Delhi opposes. In a January election, the 
people of the state of Tamil Nadu made choices that have to trouble the ruling 
Congress-I (I for Indira Gandhi) Party: 27 seats for the Congress and 170 seats 
for the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) Party out of 232 state legislative 
seats at stake. 
</P>
<P>
That was a crushing defeat for the Congress leader, Prime Minister Rajiv 
Gandhi, who staked his own stature on this election. It need not have been a 
contest between Delhi and Madras, but Gandhi made it one. 
</P>
<P>
For two decades, Tamil Nadu has been ruled by one of two regional parties, with 
Congress playing the role of a junior ally to one of them. This time the 
Congress decided to fight regional Tamil parties. More daring was Gandhi's 
decision to make this not-so-hospitable terrain a testing ground of his 
personal popularity. Over six months he made more than a dozen visits to this 
southern state, promising things no one believed he could deliver, including an 
end to corruption in politics. He hurt the pride of the Tamil people, so proud 
of their distinct cultural identity, by describing the rule of the Tamil 
parties as "dark rule." 
</P>
<P>
Normally what happens in states like Tamil Nadu, Kerala or Assam -- somewhat 
peripheral to the national mainstream as defined by the politically dominant 
Hindi heartland -- does not much affect national politics. But the outcome in 
Tamil Nadu has disturbed the balance within the Congress Party and between the 
Congress and its opponents. The political integration of this culturally 
diverse country has ripened to a point where regional politics is beginning to 
weigh in national politics. But the immediate significance of what happened in 
Madras is that all observers saw Tamil Nadu as a preview of the national 
contest near the end of this year (an election date has not been set). 
</P>
<P>
The Hindi heartland, which always decides the national winner, is in disarray. 
Encouraged by the Congress defeat in Tamil Nadu, disaffected congressmen in 
Bihar have challenged the leadership there. In Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and 
Gujarat, congressmen wanting power and pelf demand a stiff price for their 
party "loyalty." Economically backward but politically all-important Uttar 
Pradesh is no longer secure for the Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of a declining Congress Party presents opponents with a long- 
awaited moment to make a bid for power in the national election. The major 
national opposition parties are the Janta, the Lok Dal and the newly formed Jan 
Mureha. Normally they are at war with one another, though lately they have 
united to form what is called the Janta Dal. Whether this is a paper unity or a 
durable arrangement is a question the Indian voter asks, for the past record of 
opposition parties, in or out of power, is dismal. 
</P>
<P>
The crucial issue -- who will direct the opposition -- remains unresolved, 
despite the nominal leadership of Vishwanath Pratap Singh. A former Cabinet 
minister, Singh left the Congress Party to protest kickbacks in a defense deal. 
His pronounced moral streak appeals to Indians; they like a king to be just and 
a touch austere. 
</P>
<P>
Past failures to develop a workable coalition of opposition is one of the most 
perplexing questions of Indian politics. The problem is not so much reconciling 
divergent interests as reconciling the clashing egos and ambitions of singular 
leaders. In practice many of the parties, including the Congress, are like a 
faceless orchestra led by a fiery conductor. A party is often named after an 
individual here, where personality matters much more than institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of who wins, the coming election will be the most significant 
contest since 1967. In 22 years, the country has never had an election typical 
of those in other parliamentary democracies. Competition for power between 
various interest groups -- a common phenomenon in democratic politics -- has 
been overshadowed by the rise of the cult of personality. 
</P>
<P>
Indira Gandhi in 1970 established absolute dominance over the political system 
by greatly devaluing institutions -- the Congress Party, the judiciary and the 
bureaucracy. Every election since 1967 then became a kind of referendum staged 
to legitimize one-person rule. And each election was fought on such catchy 
populist slogans as "erase poverty," "save the country" or "national glory." 
</P>
<P>
But Rajiv Gandhi cannot match Indira Gandhi, his mother; personality and 
populist slogans can no longer be substitutes for performance. Congress' only 
appeal is political stability under one party. 
</P>
<P>
The responsible Indian voter has a poor choice: between a mal-performing but 
fairly cohesive Congress under one leader and the still-uncohesive opposition 
parties. Should the opposition, however, truly unite under one leader it would 
be a formidable rival. 
</P>
<P>
Gone are the days when the Congress could secure a more than two-thirds 
majority. Yet a two- or three-party system as exists in Western nations is not 
yet possible in a country as culturally diverse as India. Regional parties that 
articulate regional interests and regional cultures will always command power. 
The entire south and east are ruled by regional parties mostly hostile or 
apathetic to Delhi. Regional variations and cultural diversity are what really 
provide the roots of Indian democracy. The former prime minister of Pakistan, 
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who had promised to wage a thousand-year war with Hindu 
India, once said that it was the noise and cacophony of India that saves it 
from becoming authoritarian. That noise comes from its diversity.

<P>
I enjoyed Deukmejian's letter. However, I did feel his suggestion was 
inappropriate that Times Mirror Co. donate part of its $332 million profit to 
the state. A corporation is a neutral entity (even those protected by the First 
Amendment). Personally, I think the donations should come from the editorial 
staff only. A nominal amount of, say, 1/10 of 1% of your gross would be about 
right. 
</P>
<P>
Since I don't ask people to do what I won't do, I have enclosed my check to go 
along with all your voluntary contributions. You see, I prefer to donate 
voluntarily -- say to the L.A. Times Summer Camp Fund -- rather than in a 
compulsory way via taxes.

GOV. DEUKMEJIAN ON STATE BUDGET AND TIMES RESPONSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read Deukmejian's letter with great interest. I'm wondering why our governor, 
who's generally a nice, compassionate and understanding guy is so cruel and 
tight-fisted with our money, which really belongs to the people? 
</P>
<P>
Well, I believe that the answer lies in the recent political history. President 
Ronald Reagan cut taxes, decreased spending on social services, and all this 
has influenced many conservative politicians. Never mind that United States 
deficit has increased to horrible proportions, never mind the homeless, the 
mentally ill, the toxic dumps, the worn-out cities, the drugs, the street gangs 
and crime. Those politicians don't see that. They are hypnotized by the words 
of the Great Communicator, even though now we have different times, different 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
And that's the case with our governor. He's hypnotized. How will he get out of 
this state of hypnosis? I respectfully suggest that he take walks around Los 
Angeles slums, drive our freeways during rush hour, visit emergency services of 
county hospitals, visit our overcrowded schools and, perhaps, even visit our 
state hospitals and jails. He will learn something. At least, he will slip out 
of his state of blindness and rejection of facts.

Word proliferation! That's how I would describe your response to Deukmejian's 
reply to your Feb. 17 editorial on the state budget. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's letter and your response are analogous to your respective 
positions on the state budget. Your original editorial was not sufficient to 
describe your posture on the budget. You found it necessary to go into a wordy 
(more words are better?) recitation to support your editorial that "we" need a 
tax increase so "we" can spend more money (more money is better?) on state 
problems; a recitation almost three times the length of the governor's letter. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas, the governor was able to convey his position and response to your 
editorial in a succinct and concise letter (less words are better?) saying that 
higher revenue is not the answer (more money is not necessarily better?). 
</P>
<P>
When are you going to get with the program the voters of California desire? 
Remember, these same voters approved of Proposition 13 and Proposition 4 at the 
polls, and overwhelmingly reelected the governor.

Sorry, but if The Times devotes 10 or 20 times more column inches in its reply 
to the governor's short letter, the editorial gee-whiz big-spender kids will be 
unable to spook the Duke! 
</P>
<P>
The people, the taxpayers, respect and support this governor. He could be 
reelected by a great majority if he should change his mind and run again! 
</P>
<P>
Just like the U.S. 200 years ago, California welcomes pilgrims with statewide 
opportunities, but not with more and more welfare, government expansion and 
higher taxes for our citizens. 
</P>
<P>
And interesting -- evidently The Times does not want to accept the governor's 
challenge to "put your money where your mouth is" and donate funds to the state 
Treasury from its 1988 profit of $332 million. So I say, hurrah for the Duke!

THE CONTRA PACKAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration has reached agreement with Congress on what it 
advertises as bipartisan policy towards Nicaragua. Unfortunately, the "new" 
approach includes a very troublesome part of the old policy -- continued aid to 
the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement hammered out largely between Secretary of State James A. 
Baker III and House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.), the new Administration has 
agreed to give up the Reagan Administration's naive notion that the Sandinistas 
can be overthrown. Instead, the new policy revolves around the idea of 
confining the Nicaraguan revolution to that country and using diplomatic and 
economic pressure to get the Sandinistas to be more democratic. 
</P>
<P>
This level-headed approach to Nicaragua has long been the policy option favored 
by career professionals in the State Department. But former President Reagan 
preferred to follow the course set by right-wing activists in his 
Administration who were determined to oust the Sandinistas even if they had to 
break the law to do it. Baker had a difficult time winning support for 
President Bush's new approach because too many congressmen vividly remember the 
last eight years. 
</P>
<P>
With the important exception of the Contras, it appears that things have 
changed. Baker told dubious members of Congress, for example, that the 
Administration will now support the peace process recently begun by the five 
Central American presidents. That is in refreshing contrast to Reagan's stance 
of trying to delay, or even sabotage, peacemaking efforts in the region. But 
the Administration's request for 10 more months of "humanitarian" aid to the 
Contras will not help the peace process launched by Costa Rican President Oscar 
Arias. 
</P>
<P>
A key agreement in the Arias peace plan requires that the 11,000-person Contra 
army, now waiting in Honduras for more U.S. aid, be demobilized before 
elections are held next February in Nicaragua. Bush and Baker want to continue 
sending more than $4 million a month to the Nicaraguan rebels until February, 
demobilizing them only after the elections. They argue that the Contras are 
needed as a potential "stick" to keep Managua in line. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble with this second-hand logic is that nobody outside of Washington 
takes the Contras seriously anymore -- at least not as a fighting force. 
</P>
<P>
The Hondurans worry about them only as a crime problem. The Sandinistas are 
convinced that Reagan's surrogate army is defeated and are unlikely to be cowed 
by threats the Contras will be unleashed again. Arias and other peacemakers 
warn that continued funding of the Contras gives the Sandinistas an excuse to 
resist pressure to open up the Nicaraguan political system. 
</P>
<P>
That worrisome possibility seems more likely now, given the hostile reaction in 
Managua to Bush's announcement Friday of his request for more Contra funding. 
"Humanitarian aid to a standing military force is a contradiction in terms," a 
Sandinsita spokesman said. "Either you approve the dismantling of the Contras 
or you don't." 
</P>
<P>
The new Bush-Baker strategy towards Nicaragua is sensible in many ways. But it 
would have a far better chance of success if the Administration gave up the one 
remaining fantasy of Reagan's that still hampers Washington -- that the Contras 
can be a "viable" force in dealing with the Sandinistas. That policy has failed 
dismally and the Administration would be better off helping the Contras 
withdraw from the battlefield.

COMES GOVERNMENT TO MESS WITH OUR BARBECUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE F. WILL, George F. Will is a syndicated columnist in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The future often moves east from the West, being foreshadowed in Southern 
California. However, news usually travels east to west, so sufficient notice 
was not taken of 123 intimations of tomorrow's social issues and political 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District's jurisdiction is the Los 
Angeles Basin. That includes 13,350 square miles, an area larger than nine 
states, and 5% of the nation's population, more than the populations of 47 
states. The existence of the district may not even be known to most of the 12 
million people whose lives will be touched by implementation -- if that happens 
-- of the 123 recommendations for reducing smog. If they are implemented, it is 
possible that within 10 years average visibility in the basin will be 60 miles 
instead of today's 10 miles. 
</P>
<P>
The district operates on the provable premise that when 12 million people live 
together, anything that large numbers of them do, from driving cars to painting 
patio furniture to firing up their barbecues, matters a lot. It matters because 
life is a matter of cumulations. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago the problem of air pollution was considered a problem of vehicles 
and large stationary sources such as power plants and oil refineries. Not any 
more. Now the AQMD's proposals range from the minor and mundane (banning 
aerosol hair sprays and deodorants) to the major and visionary (electric 
vehicles). The proposals include a ban on bias-ply (non-radial) tires, steep 
increases in parking fees for cars carrying only one person and limits on the 
number of cars each family can have. 
</P>
<P>
The state should stay out of the bedroom? OK, but it may soon rummage around in 
the bathroom: Even some non-aerosol deodorants might have to be reformulated to 
eliminate certain reactive compounds. Gas-powered lawn mowers (think of 
millions of them shattering the silence of a May morning in the basin) may have 
to go. So, too, may lighter fluids for back-yard barbecues. But, then, when 
millions of barbecuers substitute twigs and crumpled newspapers . . . . 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD agenda has ignited what will be a decade of fierce debate: How much 
will it cost in money, jobs and freedom? Will the cost be regressive, falling 
heaviest on those with the least disposable income? 
</P>
<P>
Six days after the district spoke, the East was heard from on the subject of 
air pollution. Data gathered by the Environmental Protection Agency indicates 
that 329 chemicals -- only seven of them regulated by the EPA, 60 of them 
cancer-causing -- are being pumped into the air from industrial plants at the 
alarming rate of 2.4 billion pounds a year. 
</P>
<P>
The spate of news about air pollution comes while notice is being taken of the 
10th anniversary of what news stories still refer to as the Three Mile Island 
"disaster." Some disaster: No one killed, not even any measurable health 
consequences. The bad environmental consequences of Three Mile Island were the 
multiplication of delays in the development of an environmentally sound 
technology for generating power. In the name of reducing risks from nuclear 
power, we are incurring other risks. 
</P>
<P>
One of the large industries in developed societies, the insurance industry, 
embodies the modern determination to socialize risks. The welfare state, more 
properly called the social-insurance state, socializes risks of unemployment, 
sickness and aging. The pursuit of public health through environmental 
regulation is a policy of dispersing responsibility for reducing risks. 
</P>
<P>
Americans are intensely, sometimes unhealthily, health-conscious. But the 
nation's public-health priorities often are peculiar. The week that the AQMD 
proposed measures that would impinge on many freedoms, the nation was 
mesmerized by the health hazard posed by two lightly poisoned grapes. Health is 
indeed the first wealth, and Americans, who are more carefully polled 
concerning their appetites than concerning their willingness to pay the costs 
of them, constantly call for measures to produce a healthier environment. 
</P>
<P>
However, the AQMD agenda is a cold shower of costs. The costs can be calculated 
in money and in the social supervision of what once were taken for granted as 
spheres of private discretion. 
</P>
<P>
Philosophers of freedom have frequently had recourse to John Stuart Mill's 
essay "On Liberty" and his distinction between "self-regarding" and 
"other-regarding" acts. Self-regarding acts are those that affect no one other 
than the actor. In an open society, they are generally exempt from state 
control. 
</P>
<P>
The logic of environmental reasoning (it is scientific as well as social logic) 
is this: High-density urban living in the industrial age transforms many 
actions, such as driving and barbecuing, from self-regarding into 
other-regarding actions. Thus does government grow.

FSX COULD START SHIFTING AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY TO JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KUTTNER, Robert Kuttner is economics correspondent of the New 
Republic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The controversy over Japan's proposed FSX jet fighter speaks volumes about the 
difficulty the U.S. government has sorting out economic and military national 
interests. The FSX would be built jointly by U.S. and Japanese manufacturers, 
using F-16 technology developed by General Dynamics and paid for by American 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon likes the idea because it ensures what the generals call "security 
interdependence" between the United States and Japanese military forces. 
</P>
<P>
It has become increasingly clear, however, that Tokyo's main interest in 
building the FSX with U.S. technology has less to do with defense and more to 
do with the long-deferred Japanese goal of developing a commercial aviation 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Aircraft is the last major industry where the United States enjoys an 
overwhelming trade surplus. In 1987 we exported $19.47 billion worth of 
aircraft and parts, and imported just $5.14 billion worth. 
</P>
<P>
To a great extent, the American dominance in aircraft is the result of 
America's huge, unacknowledged industrial-planning agency -- the Pentagon. 
Since World War II, the Air Force has spent hundreds of billions of dollars on 
contracts and research-and-development support. It made Boeing, Lockheed, 
McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics not just makers of sophisticated 
military fighters and bombers, but world leaders in the production of civilian 
jetliners as well. 
</P>
<P>
Our official ideology, however, insists that the flow of commerce is none of 
the government's business. The free market takes care of it. If Japan makes 
better cars, televisions, etc., that must be the result of Japan's natural 
superiority in design, or marketing, or perhaps its higher rate of savings and 
capital investment. We also insist that national security equals military 
strength, and that economic strength is the job of the free market. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes the FSX project, whose implications are so clear that even the most 
reverent disciple of Adam Smith has a hard time denying that government hands, 
rather than invisible ones, are at work. One can hardly pretend that 
governments are uninvolved in the production of military aircraft. And with a 
U.S.-Japan trade deficit at $50 billion a year, it is also hard to pretend that 
the loss of a commercial aircraft industry would have no serious consequences 
for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
It is beginning to dawn on orthodox opinion leaders that our economic 
self-interest is as important as our military strength. But the Bush 
Administration is still locked into formulas more appropriate to the world of 
the mid-1950s in which America's overwhelming economic might took care of 
itself and the serious foreign-policy issues were all geopolitical. 
</P>
<P>
Since the FSX deal was approved by the Pentagon last November, the several 
power centers of the Bush Administration have been jousting over whether the 
agreement should be renegotiated to the greater advantage of American industry. 
The Pentagon, State Department and National Security Council all argued that 
the deal be left intact, lest we create a rift with our most loyal strategic 
ally. 
</P>
<P>
Carla Hills, the new chief trade negotiator, and John Sununu, the White House 
Chief of Staff, argued that the deal should be scrapped as bad for American 
industry. They said Japan should be asked to buy existing U.S. military planes 
for its air force, which technically doesn't exist since Japan supposedly 
renounced military force at the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, President Bush sided with Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, 
who took what was described as a middle position that technology-sharing 
details should be tightened up, but that the plan go forward. This leaves the 
broad outlines of the deal intact and continues the misguided policy of placing 
military goals ahead of commercial ones. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Administrations seem unable to bargain hard with the Japanese. Recently, 
the influential Japan Economic Journal warned, "The Japanese will lose faith in 
the United States if it objects to Japan developing its own fighter and scraps 
the co-production agreement." This familiar threat, implying an independent 
Japanese foreign policy, invariably makes normally resolute American military 
planners as supple as sushi. 
</P>
<P>
While there is still time, the Bush Administration needs to comprehend that 
military allies can be commercial rivals, and that there is indeed such a thing 
as a nation's commercial interests.

MAKE THE MASK OF DEMOCRACY REAL; 
</P>
<P>
PEACE BIDS FROM CENTRAL AMERICAN EXTREMES NEED REWARDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. PASTOR, Robert A. Pastor is a professor of political science at 
Emory University and director of the Latin American and Caribbean program of 
Emory's Carter Center. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Central America has attracted the world's attention, but its politics remain 
those of small, dependent nations with rigid classes, competing families, 
dominating caudillos and a reliance on force to settle disputes. Impatient 
outsiders tend to ignore these complexities and interpret Central American 
politics in terms of two wings and a prayer. In Guatemala and El Salvador, 
right-wing military forces fight left-wing guerrillas; in Nicaragua, a 
left-wing government fights right-wing guerrillas. It is only by prayer and the 
good dollar that the groups in the middle survive. 
</P>
<P>
Since the United States is most comfortable with the groups in the middle, we 
are often frustrated or easily fatigued by the region's battles. A decade ago, 
when I worked on the National Security Council, my nightmare was that Jose 
Napoleon Duarte, the courageous Salvadoran Christian Democrat, would be 
assassinated by one extreme or the other. He represented peaceful, moderate 
reform -- favorite words for Americans but anathema to the extremes, which 
viewed reform and Duarte as a threat to either revolution or privilege. Both 
wings aimed to eliminate the middle as a first step in defeating the other. 
</P>
<P>
To some, it appears that their wish has come true. Arena, the Salvadoran 
right-wing party, won the presidential election on March 19 by an overwhelming 
vote. As the election approached, the guerrillas stepped up their violence. 
Some leftists said that they wanted Arena to win, as this would polarize the 
country and increase their prospects for a successful revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the left succeeds will depend on who Alfredo Cristiani, the winner, is: 
a conservative democrat, who, like Richard Nixon, could negotiate peace with 
Marxists, or just a clean-looking mask for Maj. Roberto D'Aubussion's death 
squads? 
</P>
<P>
The question is the mirror image of the one that is asked of the Nicaraguan 
Sandinistas or the Salvadoran Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front. Are 
the Sandinistas sincere when they profess to want the opposition to compete 
openly and equally in a free election next February? Was the FMLN's proposal to 
participate in the presidential election if it was postponed for six months 
serious or merely a ploy? 
</P>
<P>
The only people who know the answers are the people who sit at the political 
extremes. To those on the left, Cristiani is a death mask, the guerrillas are 
serious about elections, and the Sandinistas are pluralists; to the right, 
Cristiani is a democrat and the promises of the Sandinistas and the FMLN are a 
ruse. These answers, however, may say more about the speakers than they do 
about the region's actors. They are both more certain and more ambivalent, and 
that is both their problem and their opportunity. Hard-liners on the right and 
left have been reluctant to acknowledge the legitimacy of their adversaries, 
but a decade of war has eroded their certainty, and that has made peace 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1979, Central America's economies have slipped two or three decades. In 
retrospect, it is clear that impressive, albeit uneven, economic development 
from 1960-78 gave rise to revolutions that in turn led to more poverty. Both 
wings now understand that only peace can bring development, and only political 
compromise will make peace possible. This is the reason for the very real, 
though hesitant steps by both sides toward peace since the five Central 
American presidents signed their accord in August, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The recent Sandinista decision to release the National Guardsmen, the FMLN 
recognition of the ballot box as the basis of legitimacy, and Arena's 
willingness to accept land reform and negotiations with the FMLN -- all are 
serious steps, but they are also half-hearted. The decisions were courageous in 
that they divided their movements at a time of weakness. At the same time, the 
extremes are nervous about fulfilling their democratic promises for fear of 
losing the chance to gain or maintain power. Their peace and democracy 
initiatives are serious, but unless those steps are encouraged and rewarded in 
some manner, the groups will be compelled for reasons of internal unity to take 
steps backwards. 
</P>
<P>
The same pattern applies to Arena (as the National Republican Alliance is 
known) if it pursues talks with the FMLN and implements its "privatized" land 
reform. Because of Arena's militarism and its hatred of the left, these steps 
will divide the party. If the talks fail, the party membership will reunite and 
breathe a collective sigh of relief. This does not mean that Arena is insincere 
about negotiations or that agreement is impossible, only that it will be 
difficult and needs outside help. 
</P>
<P>
The acceptance by both wings of the validity of elections and the imperative of 
outside verification provides the crucial framework to achieve peace. The 
United States and other governments must devise an incentive package to 
encourage the wings -- Arena and the Contras on the right, the FMLN and the 
Sandinistas on the left -- to compromise and make peaceful change a reality. 
</P>
<P>
The bipartisan accord reached between President Bush and Congress on Friday 
represents a positive and necessary first step for the United States to play an 
effective role in Central America. But the Administration should not confuse 
talks on Capitol Hill with negotiations in Central America. The real bargaining 
will be with Latin America, and it has not yet begun. 
</P>
<P>
After the Sandinistas took power, some argued that the United States should try 
to rip the "mask of democracy" from their face and show the world that they 
were really communists. A wise Venezuelan leader proposed a more sophisticated 
strategy: Instead of taking the mask off the Sandinistas, he suggested, the 
democracies might try pasting the mask on them. We should pursue that strategy 
in El Salvador as well as in Nicaragua.

ZAN THOMPSON: HER EASTER SHADES WERE BLACK AND BLUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Zan Thompson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One time when a Roman Catholic priest named Father Eamon O'Gorman had commanded 
me to be president of the Altar Society, I had a memorable experience, one of 
those that etches itself on your memory in letters of fire. 
</P>
<P>
Father O'Gorman had been an Army chaplain for years and was bored to 
distraction with the parish societies and all their works and pomps. He was 
bored with fund-raisers, with getting the new blacktop for the playground, with 
bake sales and magazine subscriptions. 
</P>
<P>
The poor old combat infantryman wore his high-topped infantry boots when he 
said Mass at St. Mary's Church in Fullerton, and when he whirled from one side 
of the altar to the other, his cassock would stand out from his ankles and the 
tea-cozy ladies would all cluck at his lack of dignity on the altar. 
</P>
<P>
He had the dignity of an Alp and did not buy a pair of black kid oxfords 
because, for the same money, he could bail a couple of his high-spirited 
itinerant fruit-pickers out of the local pokey, where some of them were apt to 
languish after too much wine on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
When Father O'Gorman met me, he spotted me for a sturdy Irish woman who had 
made it through Mount St. Mary's College, and he saw the opportunity to slide 
the Altar Society on to my shoulders and off his own. I tried to explain to him 
that I was not even a member and that surely several of the ladies would feel 
they had earned the office fairly. They had never encountered anyone like 
Father O'Gorman, who felt that obedience was a worthwhile trait in an 
infantryman or a parishioner, and never mind the protocol. 
</P>
<P>
So I was president of the Altar Society for that year, including Lent and 
Easter. During Holy Week preceding Easter, it was the custom in the Catholic 
Church to cover the statues in purple shrouds to denote the period of mourning 
at the death of Christ. The shrouds were like large, purple sateen pillow 
cases, which had to be taken off before the first Mass on Easter. 
</P>
<P>
The right side of the altar at St. Mary's was the St. Joseph altar, a 
particular favorite of mine, because I had been taught at school by the St. 
Joseph of Carondelet nuns and St. Joseph had always been helpful about untying 
knotty problems. 
</P>
<P>
I was flitting around the altar, whisking off the purple shrouds in my stocking 
feet when it came St. Joseph's turn. I climbed up on my kitchen stool and 
walked sideways with very small steps across the altar until I was right in 
front of the St. Joseph statue. I took one more step and my right leg dropped 
its full length into a hole in the altar, leaving the other leg to wave like 
that of an angry lobster. 
</P>
<P>
In the middle of every altar is an opening that holds the altar stone, where 
the sacred vessels are placed. Where I had stepped, there was no stone, just 
the opening about 10 inches square. 
</P>
<P>
Then I realized that the tall altar was not anchored to the floor and was 
rocking back and forth at an alarming rate. I called for Father O'Gorman in 
what I tried to make a soft voice, which is hard to do when you are almost 
cleft in twain like a grouse upon a spit. 
</P>
<P>
I suddenly remembered a line from a hymn I had known all my life. "We wander in 
a fragile bark o'er life's tempestuous sea." 
</P>
<P>
How fragile I had not dreamed until I realized I was about to be crushed by the 
statue of St. Joseph and his sturdy altar. "Well, St. Joseph dear," I thought, 
"if we're going crashing down together, can I count on some significant help 
when I reach the heavenly gates?" 
</P>
<P>
Surely, a lady crushed by an altar on Holy Saturday would be credited with at 
least extenuating circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Then Father O'Gorman came clumping out of the sacristy in his great shoes, saw 
my predicament and ran over and steadied the altar. But not before he stood and 
looked at me quizzically and asked, "Zan, how do you do these things?" 
</P>
<P>
I managed to pull my leg out of the hole in the altar, folded up the sateen 
shroud and tottered home. I was the only lady in the parish with a black and 
blue leg from toe to top for Easter Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Have a wonderful Easter under a sunny sky. We have been promised a pretty 
Southern California day, with a soft offshore breeze barely enough to ripple 
the Easter Bunny's fur. 
</P>
<P>
I hope everyone finds his basket, that the ham is crackling and savory and that 
the kids find at least most of the hidden hard-boiled eggs. Enjoy, and I'll 
tell you Patsy's secret for mimosas if you won't tell anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Put the orange juice and a few packets of Equal in the blender and add a couple 
of tablespoons of dehydrated low-fat milk. Whisk it all around until it's 
frothy. Then pour half a glass of the mixture into a stemmed wine glass or a 
tulip and top it off with half a glass of champagne. The color is like the 
first whisper of Easter dawn, the color of the inside of new peach, and the 
taste is like a whipped cloud.

THE COUSTEAU WATCH: OZONE DEPLETION: A SUNBURN ON THE SEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN-MICHEL COUSTEAU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I first learned to dive, my father taught me not to splash through the 
surface as I entered the water. Slamming the surface could hurt the body, 
especially the ears, if a diver were to land the wrong way. Splashing was also 
noisy, disruptive to the sea life we wished to observe. So our habit became to 
slip into the water slowly, to savor that comforting initial contact and caress 
of the sea, to respect the first touch of the water. 
</P>
<P>
But today the surface of the ocean requires more than a diver's reverence. It 
needs protection, for the surface is the key to the treasury of ocean life, the 
ocean's face to the sun. And it is ironic that the sun's energy, the ageless 
ally of life in the sea, could become its enemy in our time -- without a fully 
functioning ozone layer in the atmosphere to screen out harmful ultraviolet 
radiation. 
</P>
<P>
We have heard much about how ozone depletion can cause sunburn, skin cancer, 
weakened human immune systems and ruined agricultural crops. But we are also 
seeing that too much ultraviolet light reaching the ocean could seriously 
damage life at the vital ocean surface. 
</P>
<P>
The Earth's atmosphere is a relatively thin shield. Dr. Thomas Coohill, 
president-elect of the American Society of Photobiology, has said, "If the 
Earth were a peach, the atmosphere would be less than the fuzz on the peach." 
</P>
<P>
Ozone, a three-atom form of oxygen, is part of this protective "fuzz." In the 
lower atmosphere, if we breathe it in smog, ozone is a pollutant dangerous to 
our health. But in the stratosphere, ozone absorbs harmful solar rays. Thus, 
though invisible and colorless, ozone provides a critical filter. 
</P>
<P>
But ozone molecules can be split apart by man-made chemicals known as 
chlorofluorocarbons used in solvents, refrigerants, aerosols and foams. Rising 
into the stratosphere like bullets, these chemicals shatter ozone molecules, 
thus breaking down the ozone layer. Worse, CFCs linger in the skies, doing 
damage long after we may stop using them on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
For the ocean, the effects can be insidious. Some plants and animals live at 
the surface itself, some just below the surface, and some at the farthest 
depths to which light can reach, depending on the clarity of the water. In 
marine biology terms, the surface of the sea extends down roughly 100 meters in 
the open ocean, but much less in the fertile coastal areas. 
</P>
<P>
This sunlit layer of water is a world in itself. Microscopic ocean plants 
called phytoplankton conduct their business of living -- photosynthesis, the 
conversion of light to food. By taking in the radiant energy of the sun and 
chemicals in seawater, phytoplankton produce their nourishment. Thriving 
phytoplankton are in turn eaten by microscopic animals and small creatures, 
such as the shrimp-like krill, which in turn are eaten by fish, crabs, 
penguins, seals and on up the steps of the food chain. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the ocean surface is a community of creatures whose basic fuel 
is sunlight. If, to symbolize that surface, we draw a line on a blank piece of 
paper, the thickness of that line would contain plants and animals that can 
live only within the thickness of that line. 
</P>
<P>
Erase that line and most life in the ocean dies. 
</P>
<P>
The subtle link between dangerous ultraviolet light and the life of the sea has 
not yet been widely studied. Some investigations have been conducted in 
temperate and subtropical zones, and Dr. Sayed El-Sayed of Texas A&amp;M 
University has conducted the first experiments in Antarctic waters, fortunately 
before the recent oil spills earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
He found that ultraviolet radiation definitely inhibited photosynthesis of 
phytoplankton, and that the unwanted rays could penetrate, in Antarctica's 
clear waters, at least to 20 meters. Since phytoplankton must seek sunlight in 
order to live, they become "sitting ducks," as Dr. El-Sayed put it, for 
unfiltered sunlight. He added, "We have to be careful not to extrapolate too 
much from my work, but I have appealed to other scientists to go ahead and 
follow up, to gather more vitally needed information." 
</P>
<P>
Recently in London, the European Economic Community plus the United States, 
which account for 75% of worldwide CFC production, agreed to ban all such 
production by the year 2000. Then, just days later, France convened an 
international conference in The Hague calling for a supra-national United 
Nations agency with enforcement power to address global environmental problems. 
These meetings, of course, were very encouraging signs of international action 
at last to confront our planet's environmental deterioration. 
</P>
<P>
But feeling satisfied with handshakes and agreements on paper would be a 
dangerous luxury. Protecting the ozone layer will require the constant 
cooperation of science, industry, politics and people to make CFC substitutes 
universally available. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, life on Earth could slip through our hands as easily as the silky 
ocean slips through my fingers.

ELDERLY SUICIDE: MORE THAN A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Suicide Is a Tragic Secret for the Elderly." True, but think again. I would 
say Daniel Rosenthal chose the easiest way to go -- a quick death. I am 84 and 
I have no intention of just wasting away in a nursing home. When I cannot 
function as a normal human being, out I go. 
</P>
<P>
I have an idea that I hope will eventually be accepted by the civilized world: 
Let all of us who wish have hypodermic syringes filled with quick death, which 
we, ourselves, can inject in our veins.

What to do with a pet while vacationing? It's a sticky question, one that 
Dorothy McCorkle of La Crescenta referred to in a letter last Sunday. We've 
come up with some additional details. The group of sitters she mentioned will 
volunteer to look after your dog/cat while you're away. Or any other animal, 
bird or fish that shares your roof. These are sitters who care for pets at the 
owner's home. Besides the pets, the sitters pick up mail, water plants and even 
house-sit. Fees and services vary. This is an association with dozens of sitter 
groups, from Ventura south to San Diego: Page's Pet Patrol, Animalovers, 
Connie's Pet Sitting, Pets Luv Us, Pampered Pets &amp; Plants, Cat Home 
Companion, Creature Comforts, Allie Cat &amp; Home Care, etc.

TRAVELING OFF THE BEATEN PATH IN THE VIRGIN ISLANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE BORNN, Bornn, a native of the U.S. Virgin Islands, is a free-lance 
writer living on St. Thomas. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CHARLOTTE AMALIE, St. Thomas 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the visitor who treasures retreats off the beaten path, there are plenty 
where the sky meets the sea in the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
</P>
<P>
But don't expect such retreats to be listed by telephone number. You must learn 
the secrets from someone who's been there. I have -- and I have secrets to 
share. 
</P>
<P>
The Kite is my favorite hangout on St. John. It's a clean roadside shack with a 
tiny bar and a deck that hangs above a pair of turquoise bays and powder-white 
beaches. 
</P>
<P>
At the Kite a laid-back, personable St. Johnian named Victor Hall serves his 
delicious version of the pina colada and strums a 12-string guitar to the 
accompaniment of an electronic rhythm box as he sings. 
</P>
<P>
Boats sail by while board sailors do their fancy stuff in Cinnamon Bay below. 
And suddenly you're part of Hall's band, playing whatever you grab from behind 
the bar -- from drums and congas to tambourines and maracas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hue of Fire 
</P>
<P>
The sun sets in a hue of fire. As you look to the horizon you can see a chain 
of emerald cays ringed with white sand set in an active passage between the 
British Virgin Islands and the U.S. Virgins. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hall opens the Kite when the mood strikes him, a great time to visit 
is in the afternoon after a session on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
The light-green shack that houses the Kite is on Northshore Road between 
Cinnamon Bay and famous Trunk Bay in Virgin Islands National Park. 
</P>
<P>
For great charcoal-grilled burgers, try Bryan's Bar on St. Thomas. Everything 
is excellent. The menu is simple but the fish is fresh and the prices low. 
</P>
<P>
You can dine at a picnic table under a mango tree with the light from the moon 
to illuminate the moment. You can also chat at the bar with a French fisherman 
or shoot a breezy game of pool on the veranda overlooking Hull Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan's Bar is off the beaten path on Hull Bay Road, not far from the beach by 
the same name. To find it, consult a map. Dinner is served only from 6 to 10 
p.m. After 10 p.m., only sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Steel-Band Music 
</P>
<P>
Should you happen into Long Bay on St. Thomas, don't be surprised to hear the 
sweet pang of steel pans. Follow the sound to Vitraco Park and you'll come 
across the popular Rising Stars Steel Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Made up of more than 100 young people, the Rising Stars create a smorgasbord of 
music. You may hear the steel-band versions of pop hits and classical 
symphonies, as well as calypso. Return in April for the Virgin Islands carnival 
and you'll hear the Rising Stars at their best, in and around the streets of 
Charlotte Amalie. 
</P>
<P>
If you're a jazz lover, check out the nautically-appointed, air-conditioned 
tavern called Sparky's Waterfront Saloon. Although it has been around for long 
time, changing hands and names, Sparky's has always managed to attract a crowd 
of both residents and tourists. The food hits the spot and the bar is a good 
place to meet islanders after work. 
</P>
<P>
You might even run into Grammy nominee (for "Lady Love" and "Rashida") Jon 
Lucien, a native of St. Thomas, who might just show up to play a set or two. 
</P>
<P>
Sparky's is at the waterfront in downtown Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quiet Corner 
</P>
<P>
For those in search of a quiet corner, the Seaside Inn will prove a find. Its 
character is West Indian. Its decor is rustic and colorful, and its clientele 
99.9% native. 
</P>
<P>
The best thing about Seaside is that you can select a fish -- a plump trigger 
fish, local lobster, conch or whelk -- from a bucket containing the day's 
catch. Ask for it broiled, smothered with creole-style gravy and served with 
plantain, rice and boiled sweet potato. 
</P>
<P>
The Seaside is on Estate Frydenhoj on the lagoon between Virgin Islands 
Pleasure Boats and La Vida Marina on the way to Red Hook. It is open evenings. 
If you're in the area, stop in early to check out what's cooking for that 
night's dinner. 
</P>
<P>
For calypso and reggae, try Hillside Club. Dance to island melodies played by 
Sammy Watts and his combo. A St. Thomas native, Watts has played with soul 
great Isaac Hayes. Join him for happy hour while viewing the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday nights the Hillside Club offers a West Indian show including 
limbo, dancing on broken bottles and fire eating. The club is crowded on 
weekends, which makes it an ideal time to mingle with locals. 
</P>
<P>
Hillside is on St. Thomas on Mafolie Road on the way to Magens Bay from town. 
It's open every night except Monday, from 10 p.m. to 1:30 a.m., Fridays and 
Saturdays from 10:30 p.m. to 3:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>

VACATION MEMORIES;

<P>
THE DAY AFTER ALASKA'S GREAT SHAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILL FOWLER, Fowler is a free-lance writer living in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A quarter-century ago I flew north to visit my Air Force son, Will Jr., at 
Elmendorf Air Base outside Anchorage, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
It was a period following the frightening Alaska earthquake that struck at 5:56 
p.m. on Good Friday, March 27, 1964, registering the greatest earth-shock known 
to modern man. 
</P>
<P>
The quake's awesome power released immense pressure that had built up over 
eons. 
</P>
<P>
When it was over it carved down shorelines, thrust Kenai Peninsula up eight 
feet, dropped Kodiak Island five feet into the ocean and ripped slits hundreds 
of feet deep in bays, inlets and rivers. 
</P>
<P>
What damage the quake failed to do, monstrous tidal waves completed. In 
minutes, 114 were dead in Anchorage, Seward, Turnagain, Valdez, Cordova and 
Homer. It was the mightiest shock wave in recorded history, registering 8.6 on 
the Richter scale. 
</P>
<P>
Driving from Anchorage International Airport, I saw the extensive damage. In 
addition to leveled buildings and sidewalks, an area opened that appeared to 
have been cleared for a park. Later I learned that the space represented four 
city blocks that had literally been swallowed up by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tallest Survivor 
</P>
<P>
The 15-story Westward Hotel suddenly gained the distinction of being the 
tallest structure to survive a shock of such magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
The picture window in my room offered a panoramic view of mountain and sea. 
</P>
<P>
I peered down upon a now-quiet city. Rubble was being cleared away. It seemed 
natural to liken Anchorage to the mythical Phoenix, which rose from funerary 
ashes to live on through the ages. 
</P>
<P>
Later at the Anchorage Daily Times, editor Bernard Kosinski told us how the 
Civil Air Patrol, with only nine planes, had flown 986 sorties, carrying 321 
passengers and 427,760 pounds of medical supplies a total of 120,400 air miles. 
</P>
<P>
"Good Lord," said the intense Kosinski. "The eight-story Captain Cook Hotel was 
under construction when the quake hit. Now the work crews are going at it 24 
hours a day to finish it in time for the influx of visitors we expect to be 
coming up here so they can say, 'I visited Anchorage where they had the big 
quake.' " 
</P>
<P>
The quake moved Kosinski's newspaper building an entire city block from its 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tour of Destruction 
</P>
<P>
In 1964 only two roads led out of Anchorage, Seward Highway to the south and 
the Glenn Highway heading north for Fairbanks. 
</P>
<P>
With my son I took the Seward, beginning a 40-mile tour along the Turnagain 
Arm. As we tooled along, Will told how 80% of Alaska's highways were unpaved. 
The ruts kept us to a sensible speed. 
</P>
<P>
By then we had traveled 25 miles, and newly born tides had shut down the 
highway except for restricted hours in the mornings and afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
The Turnagain tide, which rose 40 feet in a matter of minutes, had become the 
second-greatest tide on earth, second only to the one at Newfoundland's Bay of 
Fundy. 
</P>
<P>
Later we continued past Kenai Peninsula to Girdwood, a happy little town of 75, 
snug in a lower crevasse of Mt. Alyeska. 
</P>
<P>
We took a chairlift to gaze across at the great Portage Glacier spilling into 
Turnagain Inlet. It lay across the brooding terrain like a great white bear 
languishing beneath a sun that skip-danced on the horizon, refusing to set. 
</P>
<P>
On our return we misjudged our timing as the tide moved in again. We would have 
to wait until 11 p.m. before continuing. 
</P>
<P>
That was when we saw a sign that read "Double Muskey Inn." Inside, we met 
proprietor Julian Mule, who said the Double Muskey was a drink he accidentally 
created when he had only ale and Burgundot mix. 
</P>
<P>
After tippling a couple of Muskeys, we headed back to Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
It had been one of those days to file away in memory -- a day of beauty and one 
filled with reminders of the earthquake that had shaken Alaska on Good Friday.

HER WORLD: LIVING NEW YORK STORIES, WITH A PERSONAL SEQUEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MORGAN, Morgan, of La Jolla, is a magazine and newspaper writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By 4 p.m. that cold day in Manhattan, my brisk walk had slowed to a trudge. My 
mind was crammed with sights and sounds; my shoes were crammed with toes. 
</P>
<P>
A small sign beckoned me into the Viand Coffee Shop on Madison Avenue near 
61st. I sat at the counter. 
</P>
<P>
"Coffee -- black," I said. It sounded less an order than a plea. 
</P>
<P>
"And?" asked the young Greek, with a gesture to a large glass case. Inside were 
chocolate cakes, carrot cakes and swirls of pastry. Whole cantaloupes rested 
near a bowl of white goop. 
</P>
<P>
"Try the rice pudding," he went on, since I seemed unable to speak. "It's good 
for you." 
</P>
<P>
"Just coffee," I said. 
</P>
<P>
After a couple of sips I began to perk up. I realized that I was a bit hungry. 
</P>
<P>
"I've changed my mind," I heard myself say. "I will try the rice pudding." 
</P>
<P>
"You won't regret it," said the dark-eyed lad, as he spooned it into a tall

A Tasty Treat 
</P>
<P>
He was right. The dessert was cold, fresh, sweet -- with hints of brown sugar, 
perhaps, and a trace of lemon. 
</P>
<P>
I did not tell him how long it had been since I had tasted rice pudding, 
because this might have been my first. Rice pudding was something like rhubarb 
or sweetbreads, which I had avoided by instinct. 
</P>
<P>
As I thanked him and stood to leave, I realized that once again I had been 
treated with kindness in New York City. Just as I had mastered my wary 
Manhattan mode -- walk fast, avoid eye contact, press purse into ribs -- a 
native had shown compassion. How disconcerting. 
</P>
<P>
My step was livelier as I hastened up Madison Avenue toward my hotel. It would 
be pleasant to stretch out before going to dinner and the opera. I saw a 
grocery store and veered in to buy milk, a favorite bedtime drink. Brown bag in 
hand, I marched on. 
</P>
<P>
At 72nd and Madison I succumbed to the hearth-and-home spell of Ralph Lauren's 
old mansion of a store. It is fragrant with leather and wood shavings, cashmere 
and fine tobacco. A fireplace crackles near the entrance. It's a place to curl 
up for the winter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shirt Shopping 
</P>
<P>
Instead, I talked cotton shirts with Sean, a clerk not long out of Texas. He 
showed me half a dozen striped models that might appeal to my 15 1/2-34 friend. 
He invited me to put my parcels in a handsome upholstered chair. Since one held 
a quart of milk, I placed them on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
New shirts in hand, I returned to my hotel and let my thoughts drift to the 
Metropolitan Opera and "La Boheme." Placido Domingo was singing that night. 
Fiamma Izzo D'Amico would be Mimi. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before curtain time an usher unlocked the door of our box. We were the 
first to arrive. It was a splendid perch from which to observe the excitement 
in the grand hall. And then the door opened again. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi," a man said. "We're Sid and Hermione. This your first time?" 
</P>
<P>
"We've been to the Met before," I replied. "But we've never sat in a box." 
</P>
<P>
"You'll love it," Sid said. "Whatta view. Right, honey?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," said Hermione. "When the chandeliers go up to the ceiling it's like 
'Phantom of the Opera' in reverse. Want a lemon drop?" 
</P>
<P>
She pulled a tin from her purse and passed it around. I remembered the 
admonition in the program: "Next to talking, the most serious offense to 
auditorium peace is to open cellophane-wrapped candies." 
</P>
<P>
The program suggested opening throat-soothers between acts or musical 
selections, or, if you're caught off-guard, open them swiftly. "Trying to be 
quiet by opening wrappers slowly only prolongs the torture for everyone around 
you," it concluded. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More to the Box 
</P>
<P>
Then a white-haired couple arrived, completing our box. They nodded, settled 
into the front chairs and pulled out opera glasses. 
</P>
<P>
Hermione offered them lemon drops. Sid told us about a pal of his who had gone 
to a rehearsal of the New York Philharmonic that week: 
</P>
<P>
"He was about to open the door on the Broadway side when a guy reaches out from 
behind and opens it for him. He turned around and it was Zubin Mehta. 'Wow,' he 
said, 'wait till I tell my friends that Zubin Mehta opened a door for me.' 
</P>
<P>
"So the maestro smiles, reaches out and holds open the second door. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Tell them he did it twice,' Mehta said." 
</P>
<P>
Sid and Hermione laughed. The lights dimmed. The conductor lifted his baton for 
"La Boheme." 
</P>
<P>
And I found myself thinking of tailgate parties.

The International Travel Section (March 5) had very helpful tips for persons 
traveling overseas, where I am always very cautious about protecting my purse 
and luggage. However, last November I had something new pulled on me. On a 
crowded bus in London a scruffy person sat down beside me with a raincoat over 
his arm. I did not like his looks, so I held very tightly to my purse by the 
top and straps. 
</P>
<P>
This person slashed the side of my purse with a razor and extracted an envelope 
containing money. He was so professional, I was not aware of it and didn't even 
feel him touch my purse. Fortunately, this was my last day in London and he 
secured only 3 (about $5.25 U.S.). I was lucky I did not see him slash my 
purse, because he might have used his razor on me. But since I always keep 
money in several compartments of my purse, only a portion can be stolen if one 
part is lifted.

STUDYING THE DOLPHINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some new luxury hotels are capturing dolphins and placing them in concrete 
pools under the pretense of "scientific study." Having 100 people a day swim 
with these captive dolphins is a study of their response to stress. The best 
environment for the study of dolphins, however, is in the open ocean, where the 
dolphins can swim away if they like. As a bonus, they don't need to be fed dead 
fish and don't need to be medicated for the stress that captivity creates. 
Dolphins are sensitive social beings that are interdependent and interactive 
with others within their group, which can number in the hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
To hold dolphins captive under any condition is wrong. To keep dolphins in a 
hotel lagoon is immoral. Last summer I spent an amazing week with the Wild 
Dolphin Project, under the direction of researcher Denise Herzing. She has been 
researching the same family of wild, free dolphins for four years. If one is 
interested, one can arrange to join Herzing for a week aboard the Wild Dolphins 
Project research vessel. The project can be contacted at P.O. Box 12141, Lake 
Park, Fla. 33403-0141.

Every year about this time the Mature Traveler column tells us what community 
tours offers for the summer in the way of overseas professor-led tours. So far 
I have been on four. They are wonderful tours and I plan on my fifth this 
summer -- the one to the Soviet Union. We have great socials and lectures 
before we leave and those reunions after the tours are really a lot of fun. I 
have made many friends from all parts of the United States through these trips 
and I thank you for the information.

SAM HALL KAPLAN: WESTWEEK: TIME TO LOOK, LISTEN, LEARN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Design is playing a more integral role in Los Angeles, from the obvious shaping 
of public places and buildings to the more subtle styling of fashions and 
furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
As Los Angeles grows and presses in upon us, we become more and more conscious 
of what academics call the man-made environment, the places where we live, 
work, shop or play. 
</P>
<P>
This has spurred a heightened public interest and involvement in design issues, 
as evidenced by the proliferation of local planning and design review boards, 
the popularity of architecture exhibits and house and garden tours, and the 
blossoming of shelter and fashion magazines. 
</P>
<P>
Also stimulated on another, more substantive level has been the urge to better 
shape and style the man-made environment to be more comfortable, useful and 
reflective of our tastes, position and wealth, be it building a house, planting 
a garden, decorating a room, selecting a new chair, choosing a spring outfit or 
simply setting the table. 
</P>
<P>
As we wade through this increasingly man-made environment, it is important to 
understand the difference between design and style. Simply defined, design is 
concerned with how things work, and style how they look. 
</P>
<P>
How these concepts are applied to, say, a building, a table or a tea set, is 
grist for the design profession's varied mills. 
</P>
<P>
"And there is certainly a lot of grist," commented Patrick Ela, director of the 
Los Angeles Craft and Folk Art Museum and a longtime observer of the emerging 
design field. 
</P>
<P>
"How it is milled, whether it integrates design and style into a tasty, 
nutritious concoction or into an attractive yet insubstantial fluff is the 
challenge," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The increasing demand for design has created a mixed bag of products, Ela said, 
from the ubiquitous Postmodernist-styled mini-malls to the tea kettles that 
look interesting but drip hot water in your lap. 
</P>
<P>
As Ela and others note, there is an obvious need in the design community for a 
better understanding of its own processes and who it serves -- particularly in 
Los Angeles, which -- if you haven't noticed because of the glitz and glitter 
-- has become a trend setter in an increasingly style-conscious world. 
</P>
<P>
The need for this understanding is the focus in part of Westweek, the three-day 
design show and symposium opening Wednesday at the expanded, glistening blue 
and green Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Expected to attend are some 35,000 people, including architects, graphic 
artists, interior and industrial designers and manufacturers, as well as the 
curious. 
</P>
<P>
Westweek has grown much like the local design community. 
</P>
<P>
What began modestly 14 years ago as an office furniture and furnishings show 
appealing mainly to Southern California is now a major event in the world 
design community. 
</P>
<P>
It now attracts the top professionals in the field and generates considerable 
interest in both the new products unveiled and the ideas discussed. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying at Westweek to set up a situation that goes beyond marketing to 
stimulating ideas in the showrooms, in the symposiums and in the social 
events," the design center's president, Richard Norfolk, said. 
</P>
<P>
Speakers from Japan, Italy, France and Mexico, as well as the United States, 
will discuss aspects of the show's theme, "Critical Choices: Intuition and 
Reason in the Design Process." 
</P>
<P>
"The design industry has been expanding at such a rate that it needs a 
Westweek," Norfolk said, "so those involved can take a breath, look around at 
what others are doing, listen to what leaders in the field are saying, and by 
doing so, generally aid their creativity." 
</P>
<P>
For Massoud Amini, who operates the trend-setting Massini showroom in the 
center, Westweek also is a time to display the latest in innovative European 
designs he has gathered over the last year. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, Westweek is like a medieval fair, a place to show your wares, to see 
and be seen," says Amini, who shuttles back and forth between Los Angeles and a 
home in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
Very much in the spirit of such a fair are the varied exhibitions and the award 
programs of a collection of trade publications. 
</P>
<P>
Of general interest is an architectural art exhibit inaugurating the new 
gallery designed by Cesar Pelli on San Vicente Boulevard to honor the late 
Murray Feldman, who for years guided the center. 
</P>
<P>
Also on display, and of particular interest, will be the models and drawings 
from the hotly contested Disney Concert Hall architectural competition, in 
which Frank Gehry won out over Hans Hollein of Austria, Gottfried Boehm of 
Germany, and James Sterling and Michael Wilford of England. All second-guessers 
welcome. 
</P>
<P>
Another exhibit features a selection of the recent winners of the first Design 
Excellence awards for civic architecture. 
</P>
<P>
The awards program is a welcome gesture by the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs 
Commission to recognize and encourage innovative design in the public sector 
which in the past seems to have too often rewarded mediocrity. 
</P>
<P>
That the city is sponsoring the exhibit at Westweek displays a certain 
confidence that also is welcome. 
</P>
<P>
But why not at Westweek? 
</P>
<P>
After all, it is a time when all those involved in the design profession, 
including critics, ought to be looking, listening and learning.

DISCOUNT BROKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a full-service, full-time real estate broker in California who has 
successfully worked in the field for 20 years, I have seen discount broker 
stories before: 1966, 1979 and now 1989. All that David W. Myers' story tells 
me is that we have reached another peak in a bull market, and we are less than 
a year from seeing sales fall sharply and prices either stabilizing or 
declining slightly for a while. 
</P>
<P>
In a rapidly rising market, it is easy to find a buyer and very difficult to 
price or value property so as to maximize the seller's investment income. 
Brokers are the surest way for a seller to protect himself as they give 
properties the widest exposure to the greatest number of buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The statement that brokers' costs have not risen as much as prices of homes 
reflects a naivete about even the cost of newspaper advertising, which has 
almost doubled over the past five years. And brokers are taking many, many more 
ads to get the job of selling resale homes done. During the same period, the 
number of documents and the responsibility of brokers assigned by the Internal 
Revenue Service and the state has grown 500%. 
</P>
<P>
Lastly is the matter of liability assumed by all brokers in doing the right job 
for the consumer. When a buyer or seller uses a broker who is a so-called "full 
service" company he has the comfort of knowing that in good times and bad, 
whenever he has a problem or a mistake has been made, he has a place that is 
still in business to look to for satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
The discount brokers seem only to last one cycle, so they are fair-weather 
companies only. Look at the names today, none is the same as 1979. In real 
estate, like all other things, you get what you pay for.

Hurrah for Mark Alves and hundreds of others who have given the 
Help-U-Sell-rate realtor an opportunity to demonstrate his professional skills 
and help the homeowner keep more of his profit. 
</P>
<P>
Realtors who call themselves "full-service" realtors are really only 
six-percenters. At one time 6% was a fair commission, but that was back when 
homes were selling for $20,000 -- $30,000 in the late 1960s. Times have 
changed. Today homes are selling for $150,000-plus, and 6% does not justify the 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
You can sell your own homes! Just put up a sign . . . get an agreement with the 
prospective buyers and take it to the nearby escrow office. They are the ones 
who do all the work and see it through for you . . . not the realtor.

We real estate agents are not all alike. Firms are just as different as two 
separate dry cleaners or restaurants. Usually, if you don't like the looks of 
the place, the sound of the proprietor or the initial service you get, you find 
another one. You don't decide to dry clean your own clothes or never go out to 
eat again! 
</P>
<P>
A bad experience with one agent usually means a lack of communication between 
the principal and agent or even a personality clash. Perhaps the seller wanted 
too much for the property and the agent gave an honest, professional, truthful 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
The public needs to understand that real estate agents are not "sales people at 
heart." We are service people. Our goal is to bring the buyers and sellers 
together and act as a communicator. In addition to being compensated for the 
hard work involved, there's a tremendous amount of satisfaction in seeing 
homeowners happy! 
</P>
<P>
With so much risk in these days of lawsuits, I can't imagine a professional, 
licensed agent (discounters) recommending that innocent, and most times 
ignorant, buyers and sellers take on the responsibility of transferring 
ownership of homes.

<P>
In the wake of glasnost, Russia has become very much a capitalist item, at 
least in the architecture and design book trade. Two of this season's more 
attractive, and pricey, offerings is "Russian Art Nouveau," by Elena Borisova 
and Grigory Sternin, and "Tatlin," edited by Larissa Aleksevna, both published 
by Rizzoli, and costing $95 and $75, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
"Russian Art Nouveau" explores the development of the sinuous, ornamental style 
in pre-Revolutionary Russia, as applied to a range of materials and designs. 
The effort is lushly illustrated with exquisite photographs of interiors and 
exteriors, stained-glass windows, lighting fixtures, furniture and a Czar's 
ransom of jewelry, tableware, sculpture, paintings and clothing. The total is a 
feast for the eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"Tatlin" is a heavily documented and well-illustrated collection of the 
writings, designs and art of Vladimir Tatlin, one of the more influential 
Soviet artists of the 20th Century who somehow survived as an avant-gardist 
under the heel of Stalin's represssive regime. The effort is more oriented to 
the scholar. SAM HALL KAPLAN

BRICK PLANT IN S.D. WILL BE DEVELOPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hazard Brick and Block plant in Mission Valley will be replaced soon with a 
$200-million center that will be one of the largest mixed-use projects in San 
Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Known as Hazard Center, the 42-acre development will replace the 30-year 
headquarters for R.E. Hazard's concrete manufacturing and sales operations and 
its engineering and grading contracting business. R.E. Hazard built more than 
$500 million in highways in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
When completed at California 163 and Friars Road, Hazard Center will have 
offices, retail space, a hotel, restaurants and residential units. 
</P>
<P>
Construction has begun on the $120-million first phase, which is expected to be 
completed in the spring of 1990. Phase I will include a 15-story, 
292,000-square-foot office tower, a 135,000-square-foot specialty retail center 
called "The Brickyard," with exclusive shops and restaurants, and a 
238,000-square-foot, 300-room Red Lion Inn hotel with several restaurants, a 
lounge and a full-service health club. 
</P>
<P>
A seven-screen Mann Theatre complex and a food court are also planned. 
</P>
<P>
Developed by Crow-Hazard Associates, a joint venture of Trammell Crow Co. and 
R.E. Hazard Contracting Co., Hazard Center is being constructed by 
Snyder-Langston Builders of Irvine. SGPA Planning &amp; Architecture is 
designing The Brickyard, and Arechaederra, Hong, Treiman of Santa Monica is 
designing the office tower.

CITY LINES: MORE WESTWARD TILT

<TEXT>

"Metropolis: The Architecture &amp; Design Magazine of New York" is looking 
beyond the Hudson, in response "to the desire for greater editorial and 
advertising coverage of California," says publisher Horace Havemeyer III, in 
the March issue. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine offered a tease for its expanded coverage in its January/February 
issue with an article on how MacArthur Place, a proposed Orange County 
development of Bell Canada Enterprises master-planned by New York-based urban 
designer M. Paul Friedberg, will cope with the car. It was the sort of article 
that serves a pre-leasing and pre-approval publicity effort well, albeit 
beginning with an obligatory freeway scene. 
</P>
<P>
In the current issue, there is an interesting, if dated article on the home as 
a workplace, using, among other examples, two engagingly designed, awkwardly 
styled townhouses in Hollywood Heights, fashioned by the Santa Monica-based 
architecture firm of Koning Eizenberg. 
</P>
<P>
And we always thought Metropolis is where the director Fritz Lange lived when 
he was not here visiting the studios. So much for parochialism. SAM HALL KAPLAN

CITY LINES: DESIGN IN BIG ORANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Architects in Orange County, disturbed by the lack of a basic dictionary of 
commonly accepted urban design ideas needed to give physical coherence to the 
area's burgeoning growth, have begun to move toward the creation of an advisory 
body that would spur county planning officials into adopting urban design 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
The new group, the Orange County Urban Design Advisory Coalition, was initiated 
by former UCI campus architect David Neuman in collaboration with the Orange 
County chapter of the American Institute of Architects. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to make the public and the official decision-makers more sensitive 
to urban issues by commenting on major projects," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the upcoming major projects coalition intends to comment on include 
John Wayne Airport, the Santa Ana Civic Center, the design of new freeways, new 
forms of high-density housing and the conversion of the Irvine Business Complex 
into an urban village. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time local design professionals made their collective voice heard in the 
evolution of the county's built environment," Neuman said. "If we don't, we 
can't in all conscience moan about the bastardization of our landscape." LEON

NEWS BRIEFS: DOWN ZONING STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EVELYN DE WOLFE, From staff reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The possible scaling down of existing zoning is being studied for more than 400 
acres scattered across Monterey Park's most congested areas. 
</P>
<P>
A temporary ban on construction of apartments and condominiums was unanimously 
enacted last May by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The building moratorium was imposed while city planners and officials study 
whether it would help correct problems with sewers, schools and streets 
overburdened by rapid growth during the last decade if the zoning on 
residential properties in the northeast neighborhoods were reduced.Sixty 
percent of the city is now zoned for single-family housing and another 19% for 
apartments and condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, residents will be able to vote on any zoning changes the council 
may decide to enact. A referendum approved in 1987 required that changing the 
zoning on more than one acre requires a vote by the community.

NEWS BRIEFS: OFFICE LEASING RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A record 3.9 million square feet of office space was leased in Orange County in 
the past year, according to a survey by Newport Economics Group. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the space, said the firm's president, Robert Dunham, was leased by 
large companies currently located in Orange County and expanding. 
</P>
<P>
Almost as much office space was built last year as was leased, Dunham said, so 
vacancy rates remained relatively high, registering 19.4% at the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
As before, the John Wayne Airport area had the most construction and the most 
new tenants, but Irvine Spectrum has 1 million square feet under construction 
already committed to major tenants, he said.

HANDYMAN Q &amp; A: PAINT CHIP COLORS MAY NOT LOOK SAME ON WALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDY LANG, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Soon I will be painting three of the rooms in our house. In each 
case, the color is being changed. I seem to have heard a long time ago that the 
colored paint chips in paint stores are not the same when they are applied to 
walls. Is this so, and what should I look for? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Paint chips give the true color most of the time, but paint applied to 
a large surface takes on an intensity it did not have in a small area. Thus, if 
you select a yellow, it will appear more "yellowish" when it's on the wall. 
This is true with any color. If a color is dark, it will seem darker when it 
covers a large surface. When you have made your selection, ask the advice of 
the dealer, especially if he has been in business for a considerable time. He 
should know instantly whether there will be any difference between the color of 
the chip and the color on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Carbide Bit Works Best for Drilling Concrete 
</P>
<P>
Q: Years ago, I often worked on concrete. I'd drill holes into it with a star 
drill, hitting it with a hammer and then turning it slightly each time. I am 
sure there is now a better way to make holes in concrete. Can you help? 
</P>
<P>
A: To make holes in concrete, such as those necessary to hold anchors for 
screws and bolts, you need a portable electric drill and a carbide-tipped bit. 
In making the hole, work carefully. The bit sometimes will jam in the hole. 
Remove it and take another crack at it. You may have to blow the dust and grit 
from the hole so it will not interfere with the whirling of the bit. 
</P>
<P>
Wallpapering a Ceiling Tougher Than Painting 
</P>
<P>
Q: We soon will be wallpapering four of the rooms in our house. We know how to 
handle the job, but would like to try something new -- papering the ceilings of 
at least two of the rooms. Is this difficult and should we undertake it? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, it's difficult and you may regret it before you are finished. Some 
residences have beautifully papered ceilings but remember they have been done 
professionally. Go ahead if you wish, but be ready to tackle a job that is a 
lot more difficult than painting. 
</P>
<P>
Use Paint, Not Varnish on Outdoor Furniture 
</P>
<P>
Q: I plan to refinish a set of wooden patio furniture. Would varnish hold up 
better than paint? 
</P>
<P>
A: Generally, paint withstands the elements better than varnish, even the 
outdoor type. 
</P>
<P>
Put House Addition on Reinforced Slab 
</P>
<P>
Q: I plan to set an addition to our house on a concrete slab. Will this be all 
right or is it necessary to use a foundation such as the house sets on? 
</P>
<P>
A: Putting an addition on a concrete slab is the modern way of handling the 
job. Are you doing the work yourself? If so, remember the slab must be 
reinforced with mesh and the slabs should be from 4 to 6 inches deep. Be 
careful handling the construction of the slab. If you have limited knowledge, 
better hire a professional. No matter who does the job, be sure waterproof 
insulation is placed around the perimeter of the slab. 
</P>
<P>
Use Double 2 by 4s to Hang New Door 
</P>
<P>
Q: We are making a room in our basement to use as a laundry. I have had some 
experience at this kind of work, but I have never hung a door, which will be 
necessary. Is it all right to use 2 by 4s to frame the opening? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, but use double 2 by 4s on both sides and at the top. In making a 
doorway, it's always a good idea to buy the door first, then frame it to fit. 
When you buy the door, get pre-cut jambs. Be sure to use a level to make the 
sides plumb and the top horizontal. The width of the finished opening should be 
one-eighth inch more than the width of the door. The height of the opening 
should be equal to the height of the door plus any clearance for the threshold, 
header, floor tile, etc. See if your dealer has a Stanley do-it-yourself door 
book. It is an excellent guide to the hanging of doors, their repair and 
maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Buff Marble Surface With Gritty Polish 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have a marble coffee table with several large stains. I have tried several 
things and cannot remove them. I hope you can help. I didn't know marble 
stained that way. 
</P>
<P>
A: The secret of polishing marble is to buff the surface with abrasive 
materials of successively finer grit sizes. The polishing usually will remove 
the stains. But it takes extensive effort and considerable time to achieve 
results. Your best bet is to go to a dealer who sells marble and buy a 
polishing compound or whatever poultice he recommends, being sure to get some 
kind of brochure or pamphlet that gives detailed instructions. 
</P>
<P>
Tighten Shade Tension by Re-Rolling Shade 
</P>
<P>
Q: How can I restore the spring tension on a window shade? It is now too loose. 
I know it has something to do with removing the shade and rerolling it, but I 
don't know how. Can you help? 
</P>
<P>
A: If you wish to tighten the spring tension on a shade, roll it down about 24 
inches. Hold it at that point as you remove the shade from its brackets. Now 
roll up the shade while it is in your hands and put it back in the brackets. It 
should work properly. If it works most of the way, but not all the way, do the 
same thing a second time. That should do it. 
</P>
<P>
Insulate Toilet Tank to Avoid Condensation 
</P>
<P>
Q: Last summer the toilet tank in our bathroom continually sweated and caused 
puddles on the floor. How can I stop that from happening again? 
</P>
<P>
A: The water that forms on the outside of the tank is condensation, caused when 
warm, moist air settles on a cold surface. Condensation of that kind can be 
stopped by insulating the inside of the tank so the outside does not get cold. 
</P>
<P>
You can also have a plumber put in a mixing valve that will keep the water in 
the tank lukewarm. Sometimes condensation can be halted merely by putting an 
absorbent cover on the tank so the moist air doesn't hit it, but you will also 
have to cover any other part of the fixture that gets cold. 
</P>
<P>
The techniques of using varnish, shellac, lacquer, stain, sealer, bleach, 
remover, etc., are detailed in Andy Lang's booklet, "Wood Finishing in the 
Home," which can be obtained by sending $1 to Know-How, P.0. Box 477, 
Huntington, N.Y. 11743. Questions of general interest will be answered in the

NEWS BRIEFS: DEVELOPER SEEKS LOAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Stalled work on the Compton Lazben Hotel, begun in 1986, may resume shortly 
following a request to Compton's City Council last week for a loan of at least 
$1.5 million to the developer of the long-delayed, $30-million project. 
</P>
<P>
Naftali Deutsch, a principal in several firms building the city-backed hotel 
and convention center, told officials that he cannot complete work because he 
is $3 million short. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager James Goins confirmed his intent to recommend to council members 
that they accept Deutsch's offer to come up with $1.5 million if the city is 
willing to loan him the other $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The project has been beset by financial problems, labor disputes and work 
stoppages since it began. The original completion date was May, 1988, but city 
officials agreed to adjust the completion date to mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
Loaning more money to Deutsch is only one of several alternatives to get going 
on the project again, Goins said. One could include suing Deutsch and his 
partners for breach of contract and hiring a new contractor to finish the job.

GROUP CALLS FOR BAN ON NEW HOTELS AT BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of Santa Monica slow-growth activists is seeking support for an 
initiative that would ban the construction of hotels, motels and large 
restaurants along Santa Monica Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the newly-formed "Save Our Beach Committee" said they hope 
to gather 10,000 signatures backing the initiative, enough to place it on the 
ballot for a special election this year. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Gilpin, a film maker and veteran of past slow-growth initiative 
campaigns, said she and a handful of activists began the drive because of a 
"flood" of hotel and motel construction in her beach neighborhood in the last 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
"The views from Palisades Park, the open beaches, these are valuable 
resources," Gilpin said. "We need to protect these resources for all 
generations." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed initiative would be an amendment to Santa Monica's Comprehensive 
Land Use and Zoning Ordinance and would create a "Beach Overlay Zone" from the 
center of Ocean Avenue east to Santa Monica Beach. Construction of hotels, 
motels and big restaurants would be prohibited in the zone, which would extend 
from Santa Monica's northern border along Ocean Avenue and along Nielson Way to 
the city's southern border. Santa Monica Pier would be exempted from the zone. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Failure Predicted 
</P>
<P>
Those close to the development community predicted the initiative would fail or 
would be challenged on legal grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"It's inconsistent with the California Coastal Law, which encourages hotel and 
visitor services in beach areas," said Christopher Harding, an attorney for the 
Santa Monica Area Chamber of Commerce. "I don't think there's a significant 
chance it would pass." 
</P>
<P>
City Councilwoman Christine E. Reed said the initiative, if passed, would 
hamper city efforts to revitalize the beach. "(The initiative) would have an 
adverse impact on the economy of the beachfront," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It would certainly stop the development approved by the council for the Sand 
and Sea Club site," she said. Last year, the City Council approved a 148-room 
hotel and community center for the site, which is owned by the city but leased 
by the private club. 
</P>
<P>
Gilpin said the initiative's supporters include Douglas Badt, manager of the 
Sand and Sea Club. Badt could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The committee submitted the proposed initiative to the city clerk's office 
Thursday. City Clerk Clarice Johnsen said the signatures of 15% of the 
approximately 56,000 registered voters in Santa Monica -- about 8,400 
signatures -- would be needed to call a special election. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hotel Construction 
</P>
<P>
At least two hotels are under construction along the beachfront -- the 
196-room, six-story Park Hyatt Santa Monica Beach Hotel at the end of Pico 
Boulevard, and the 349-room, four-story Lowes Santa Monica Beach at 1700 Ocean 
Ave. 
</P>
<P>
City planner Wanda Williams said she has received numerous complaints from 
residents near the sites of the two hotels. 
</P>
<P>
"They've expressed a lot of concern about the hotels going up around them," 
Williams said. "They are concerned that sunlight will be blocked and that 
traffic and noise will increase." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Gilpin supported another petition drive, a comprehensive slow-growth 
measure that would have placed restrictions on commercial construction. The 
initiative was denied a place on the ballot when a Los Angeles County Superior 
Court judge ruled that the petitions were invalid, in part because they did not 
include the names of the sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
According to the city clerk's office, the last petition drive to succeed in 
placing an initiative on the ballot was in June, 1986. Proposition M, an 
amendment to the city's rent control law, was defeated. 
</P>
<P>
The last successful initiative placed on the ballot by petitions passed in 
June, 1984, when Proposition Y changed the date of general municipal elections 
from April to November. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney will complete a review the initiative within 15 days, Johnsen 
said. The activists will then have 180 days to gather signatures, she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
James L. Ash Jr., selected last week to be president of Whittier College, is 
described by colleagues as one of the brightest, most creative administrators 
in higher education. 
</P>
<P>
Ash is now vice provost for student affairs at the University of Miami, a 
private university of 13,000 students in Coral Gables, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
The 43-year-old historian, an ordained Presbyterian minister, is credited with 
raising student enrollment in the university's honors program from 200 to 
1,300. He also drew praise for helping set up a residential dormitory program 
modeled after programs at America's Ivy League colleges, which borrowed the 
idea from England's Oxford and Cambridge universities. 
</P>
<P>
Ash will become Whittier's 12th president in July, succeeding Eugene S. Mills, 
63. Mills announced last fall that he will retire in June after a decade as 
president of the small but venerable college, which has been suffering from 
declining enrollment and chronic budget problems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vote Was Unanimous 
</P>
<P>
Trustees of the 101-year-old college and its 500-student law school voted 
unanimously at a special meeting Wednesday night to give the post to Ash. 
</P>
<P>
He says he was not looking for a job. 
</P>
<P>
"I was minding my own business in Miami," he said, when he received a call 
asking if he would be interested. "And the more I discovered, the more I was 
convinced that Whittier College was an academic jewel." 
</P>
<P>
In a brief telephone interview from Miami, Ash said: "The challenges are the 
same challenges that every liberal arts college faces in the next five years in 
this country." Two of the most important challenges, he said, are retaining a 
quality faculty and overcoming what he calls "unfavorable demographics," a 
shrinking pool of college-age youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
The next three years, he said, represent a valley in college admissions because 
there will be fewer people turning 18 and starting college than in previous 
years. And, as the older academic generation retires and the Ph.D. glut that 
characterized the 1970s and '80s disappears, he said, there is fierce 
competition for bright young faculty members. Universities are raiding smaller 
colleges that hired the faculty members during the glut. 
</P>
<P>
Ash acknowledged, too, that Whittier, compared to many other private colleges, 
has a meager endowment. But the man who always takes a positive approach to 
problems, according to one Miami colleague, put a positive face on the 
fund-raising aspect of his new job. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of my responsibility will be to give the Southern California community a 
chance to participate in the strengthening of one of their major resources," 
Ash said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he will maintain Whittier's generous scholarship policies, which some 
Whittier administrators have acknowledged contributed to the college's budget 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
At Miami, Ash teaches one class a semester and says he will do the same at 
Whittier, although maybe not the first year. Ash joined the university in 1977 
as an assistant professor of religious studies. He later served as chairman of 
the religious studies department. 
</P>
<P>
He holds a Ph.D. in American social, religious and intellectual history, a 
master's degree from the University of Chicago, and a master's degree in 
theology from Southern Methodist University. He is a native of Texas and did 
his undergraduate work at Abilene Christian University. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote "Protestantism in the American University," published by Southern 
Methodist University Press, and is finishing another book, "Primitivism in 
American Religion." 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I do to keep intellectually alive and it's more like fun than 
work," Ash said of his writing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wife Has Dean's Job 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Patricia Bryan Ash, will give up her job as assistant dean at the 
University of Miami Law School, to move to California. The couple have two 
daughters, ages 11 and 13. 
</P>
<P>
Colleagues and students who were contacted at Miami last week viewed Ash's 
impending departure with regret. 
</P>
<P>
"You run into people in your lifetime that have that kind of personality and 
seem to . . . inspire others," said David Kling, Ash's assistant at Miami. 
"That's why he's good for Whittier, because Whittier needs a shot in the arm." 
</P>
<P>
"It is a tremendous gain for Whittier," said Deborah Perry, associate provost 
and dean of enrollments at Miami, where Ash is credited with transforming 
university enrollment by boosting the number of honors students, and with 
helping create the residential college system in which faculty families were 
moved into student living quarters, where seminars were held and learning labs 
were established. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than just being a place to sleep, (the dorm) became a place to live and 
learn," Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bright and Creative 
</P>
<P>
"He is one of the brightest, most creative higher education administrators in 
the country today," she said. "With Jim's guidance," she said, "the university 
has been able to bring itself into a stable enrollment environment." 
</P>
<P>
To draw more honors students to the university, she said, Ash expanded the 
course offerings in the honors program and drew the best professors on campus 
into it. 
</P>
<P>
Twice, students have named him professor of the year, said Robert S. Marshall, 
assistant news editor of the university newspaper. "He's very respected by 
everyone on campus who comes in contact with him," Marshall said.

SCHOOL BOARD CANDIDATE SUES FOR SPOT IN RUNOFF

Arlene Moncrief, a losing candidate in the school board primary election, has 
filed a complaint in Superior Court to have her name put on the April 18 runoff 
ballot in place of another candidate who dropped out of the race more than a 
month ago. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, if no candidate receives more than 50% of the votes cast in a 
primary, there must be a runoff between the top two candidates. 
</P>
<P>
In the March 7 primary, George Padilla, a civil engineer, was the top 
vote-getter with 6,974 votes, followed by Francisco Lara, former assistant dean 
of the Graduate School of Education at UCLA, who came in second with 4,024 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
But Lara dropped out of the race well before the primary because of unspecified 
personal reasons and has said he has no plans to campaign in the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Moncrief, who came in third with 3,924 votes, says her name should be on the 
runoff ballot. She named City Clerk Pamela Swift as the defendant in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Moncrief, an auditor with the Internal Revenue Service, said it is 
"unconscionable, expensive and beyond the intent of the election code" to have 
Padilla face a candidate who has dropped out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
She said in her suit that voters are also being cheated of having a choice of 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Victor Kaleta said that under the state Election Code, the city has 
no choice but to put Lara's name on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Lara could have sought a court order from the Superior Court, compelling the 
city to remove his name, but the city never received such an order, Kaleta 
said. The city has 30 days to respond to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
Padilla and Moncrief have both campaigned before for the school board. In the 
1987 election, they ran against Roberta Moon, who won the seat with 57.2% of 
the vote. Padilla came in second with 29.8% of the vote, followed by Moncrief 
with 12.9%.

2-MONTH SECRET DRUG INVESTIGATION LEADS TO 43 ARRESTS

<P>
A few residents living in new townhouses on Gundry Avenue have complained at 
City Council meetings that officials were not doing enough to stop the blatant 
drug trafficking in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"Something was being done but we couldn't talk about it," Councilman Manuel E. 
Guillen said recently in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a two-month undercover operation by Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies, which ended Wednesday with the arrest of 43 people on drug 
charges, including possessing, selling and purchasing rock cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
After several dealers were arrested Wednesday the deputies, posing as dealers, 
arrested people who tried to buy drugs, said Capt. Ken Bayless, commander of 
the Lakewood sheriff's station, which serves Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 deputies participated in the operation, which was concentrated in the 
15300 block of Gundry. Many of the drug dealers operated out of an apartment 
complex at 15320 Gundry Ave., Bayless said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said it is not yet known how much the operation, which was 
funded by the city, will cost. "Whatever the cost, it is worth it," Deputy City 
Manager Patrick West said. The city asked the sheriff's deputies to conduct the 
undercover operation, and agreed to pay for the overtime, which was not part of 
the regular contract with the department. 
</P>
<P>
West said the undercover effort was directed at what was believed to be one of 
the largest drug-dealing operations in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Charles R. Weldon said: "We want drug pushers and drug users to 
understand that Paramount will not tolerate them and we will not surrender a 
single block to them." 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to further discourage drug trafficking, West said, the city 
Thursday plans to close Gundry Avenue at Somerset Boulevard by building a 
72-inch high concrete storm drain to create a cul-de-sac. 
</P>
<P>
West said officials believe criminals will be reluctant to come into the area 
where there is only one exit. A sheriff's deputy will be assigned to patrol the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Gundry is a residential street with a mix of older apartment buildings and the 
recently developed townhouses.

PARAMOUNT LOOKS AT WAYS TO HALT INCREASE IN GANG ASSAULTS, KILLINGS 
</P>

<P>
Alarmed by an increase in gang assaults and killings, the City Council is 
reviewing several proposals, including adding more sheriff's deputies to a gang 
detail, expanding an anti-gang program in the schools, and counseling families 
of suspected gang members. 
</P>
<P>
The entire project would cost more than $1 million and require an increase in 
taxes, City Manager Bill Holt said. The proposals were drawn up by the city 
staff and submitted to the council last week. The council is expected to 
discuss the proposals further at its next meeting April 4. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Going to Make an Effort' 
</P>
<P>
"We have got to try something. We're going to make an effort," Mayor Charles R. 
Weldon said. 
</P>
<P>
Weldon said he was "personally and emotionally" affected by the lastest gang 
killings in which two teen-age boys died in a drive-by shooting Feb. 27. 
</P>
<P>
Weldon said he knew the family of one of the boys, John Adrian Borrego, 16, and 
had coached one of his older brothers in Little League baseball several years 
ago. "I was moved. This was not right. It should not happen," Weldon said. 
</P>
<P>
Borrego and Saul Martinez, 14, were killed and three other youths wounded. The 
shooting occurred in the 13900 block of Downey Avenue, a few doors from 
Borrego's home. A group of youths were talking when shots were fired from a 
small red sports car, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Gang-related killings and assaults have risen in the past couple of years 
throughout the county, including Paramount, according to statistics from the 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
The Downey Avenue killing was the fifth gang-related murder in Paramount since 
June, 1988. There were three such slayings in fiscal 1987-88 ending June 30, 
and one in 1986-87. Gang-related assaults have shown a steady increase, from 15 
in 1986-87 to 27 in 1987-88, to 57 since last June. 
</P>
<P>
The staff submitted more than 30 anti-gang measures in response to a council 
request after the February drive-by shooting, Weldon said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3,000 Have Been Taught 
</P>
<P>
These included expanding an anti-gang program in the public schools to all 
grades from kindergarten through 12th grade. The existing program is limited to 
fifth, sixth and seventh grades of the Paramount Unified School District. The 
program, called Alternative to Gang Membership Program, has been a part of the 
regular curriculum since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick West, a deputy city manager, said more than 3,000 students have gone 
through the program, which covers the problems and dangers of belonging to a 
gang. The program expansion would cost more than $122,000 to hire additional 
personnel the first year. 
</P>
<P>
Another program calls for expanding the special two-member gang detail to four 
deputies, which would cost nearly $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
Under another proposal, a total of $75,000 would be earmarked for hiring 
counselors to work with gang members and their families. "We know that some 
gang members have parents and grandparents who were in gangs. This program 
would try and break this pattern," Councilman Manuel E. Gullien said. 
</P>
<P>
The staff also suggested that prison visits be scheduled for children "to be 
scared straight" by criminals. "We would get the permission of their parents 
before locking them up with criminals who would talk to them about going 
straight," City Manager Holt said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Future Tax Increase 
</P>
<P>
The city has about $200,000 in its budget that could be used to expand the 
anti-gang program in schools or establish the counseling program for families 
of gang members, Holt said. But taxes would have to be increased to pay for 
these and other programs in future years, he told the council. 
</P>
<P>
The council could consider increasing business license fees; levying a refinery 
tax on Paramount Petroleum, the city's only refinery; charging an admissions 
tax at the Paramount Swap Meet, and increasing dog license fees. 
</P>
<P>
"We need time to think about these proposals. We need to go to the public and 
see if people are willing to fund them," Weldon said. 
</P>
<P>
The council is expected to get the public's reaction at the April meeting, 
Weldon said.

HOSPITAL HEAD GETS NEW POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The commander of the Long Beach Naval Hospital is being transferred, but Navy 
officials said last week that the move is not related to recent claims that the 
facility has been dangerously under-equipped. 
</P>
<P>
Navy Capt. Clarence William Cote', commanding officer since 1987, will leave 
May 19 to assume command of the Naval Hospital Corps School in Great Lakes, 
Ill. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a regular change of command," said Ensign Richard Dewey, a hospital 
spokesman. "It's a step up in his career." 
</P>
<P>
As of Thursday, Dewey said, it was unclear who would replace Cote'. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the 114-bed facility -- the only Naval hospital in Los 
Angeles County -- made headlines after a group of physicians in its internal 
medicine department signed a memo saying they would refuse to treat seriously 
ill patients because of conditions at the facility, which they considered 
poorly equipped and under-staffed. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dewey, the commander's imminent reassignment is unrelated to those 
revelations. 
</P>
<P>
"His tenure here has been successful," Dewey said of Cote'. "(Such 
reassignments) happen every day in the Navy." 
</P>
<P>
Cote' could not be reached for comment.

REGROUPING IN THE COLD WAR; 
</P>
<P>
BIRCH SOCIETY TO CLOSE WEST COAST OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WARD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In outward appearance, the John Birch Society's West Coast office on Mission 
Street in San Marino is not much different from the chiropractic clinic next 
door or the legal and financial offices down the street. Except, that is, for a 
large world map in the window that shows the battle lines in the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
There are three categories of nations in the Birch view of the communist 
advance: those under communist control, those still free of communist 
domination and those in which the communist influence has reached 65% or more, 
a group that on the map includes Sweden, Spain, Mexico and large chunks of 
Africa and South America. 
</P>
<P>
Conditions may have changed since the map was drawn in 1984, said Jim Toft, who 
manages the San Marino office, but the anti-communists' position has not 
improved. These days, he complained, "it's chic to be pro-Soviet. We're being 
lulled to sleep by glasnost." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strategic Retreat 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it is the John Birch Society that is in strategic retreat, planning to 
close its headquarters in Belmont, Mass., and its West Coast office in San 
Marino this summer and consolidate operations in a new office in Appleton, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
John McManus, national public relations director, said the national and 
regional staff of 50 will be trimmed to 30. Only three of the eight employees 
in San Marino will be moving to Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
Not many people come by the San Marino office these days, although dealing with 
the public has never been a vital function. A regional office was established 
here 25 years ago because office space was available from a member. The office 
has been moved twice, both times to buildings owned by members. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the work involves serving chapters in 13 Western states, maintaining 
membership rolls and research files, and filling requests for society 
publications. A bookstore is maintained in front, Toft said, for the 
convenience of local members, although the curious occasionally wander in. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mistaken Impression 
</P>
<P>
Char Gonzalez, a black woman who sits at the receptionist desk, said people are 
sometimes shocked to see her there because they are under the mistaken 
impression that the John Birch Society is racist. 
</P>
<P>
"Back in the '60s, a lot of articles printed (about the society) in the 
newspapers were unfavorable," she said. "I think it was probably a communist 
sympathizer doing all the printing . . . they must have paid an awful lot of 
money to have this (bad publicity) in the papers." 
</P>
<P>
Books and pamphlets defending Sen. Joseph McCarthy are on display in the 
bookstore that occupies the outer lobby. Visitors can also find everything from 
McGuffey's Readers to books on homosexual influences on society. The political 
books range from the Federalist Papers to "Teddy Bare," subtitled "The Real 
Story of Chappaquiddick." 
</P>
<P>
Toft said a number of society members have expressed interest in maintaining a 
bookstore after the San Marino office is closed. Otherwise, he said, members 
would have to travel to the group's bookstores in Downey or North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Although closure of the office will be a loss to local members, Toft said, it 
will improve the organization. "It's the old business axiom of reducing the 
overhead and putting it into the product," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Membership Declined 
</P>
<P>
McManus said the Reagan years were tough on the John Birch Society. Although 
membership increased last year, he said, it declined during most of the 
Administration of President Reagan, apparently because some people felt that a 
strong conservative in the White House made the work of the John Birch Society 
less important. McManus said the society tried to tell its members that 
Reagan's "rhetoric would not be matched by his deeds," but it took a while for 
people to see that. 
</P>
<P>
McManus said the society does not disclose membership figures, but he said the 
total is in "the tens of thousands." He emphasized that the John Birch Society 
is not cutting its services to members or reducing its staff of about 40 field 
workers, who organize volunteers and serve chapters across the nation.

UCLA MEDICAL CENTER SEEKING HOSTS FOR OUT-OF-TOWN PATIENTS

West Los Angeles families are being asked to provide free temporary lodging to 
UCLA Medical Center patients and relatives as part of a special program 
designed to help out-of-town patients avoid the high cost of housing. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's Host Home Program, sponsored by the medical center's Clinical Social 
Work and Pastoral Care departments and University Religious Conference, is 
trying to identify about 50 families a year willing to open their doors to 
patients and families for brief stays.

The Rev. Janet Humphreys, director of pastoral care at UCLA Medical Center, 
said the combination of high costs for health care and high costs for lodging 
is more than many families can afford. 
</P>
<P>
"This program is beneficial in answering the numerous requests for housing we 
receive from out-of-town patients and families who, in addition to the stress 
of an illness, have to worry about the expense of a hotel," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the hosts are not asked to provide food, child care or 
transportation. "They just provide a place to stay," Humphreys said. The length 
of the stay varies from one night to about a week. 
</P>
<P>
She said the program has only been able to fill 13 of the 19 requests it has 
received since October. Many of those who need housing have come from out of 
state or from other countries to undergo special medical treatment at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone may fly in from Colorado for a bone marrow transplant and find that 
they don't need to stay in the hospital overnight and they can't fly back and 
forth from Colorado," Humphreys said. "We try to get them some place to stay 
near the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
The program also finds housing for out-of-town family members who want to be 
close to their loved ones during their recovery. Many of the patients involved 
in the program have undergone transplants, cancer treatment or heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Homes selected to become part of the program must be within a five-mile radius 
of the Westwood medical center, she said. 
</P>

Fitness guru Richard Simmons is trying to put together a Broadway musical 
called "Lbs.," which would cast him as the son of an eccentric woman who 
inherits a fat farm. Twelve songs have already been written for the two-act 
show, including "The Last Supper" -- a tribute to that final binge before 
serious dieting begins. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons told us he's been working on the project for three years with writer 
Bruce Vilanch and songwriters Earl Brown and Artie Butler. The William Morris 
Agency is handling the business end, and Simmons hopes to begin casting in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
"We four all have something in common: We love to eat and we've gone through 
periods where we would sell our mothers for a hot loaf of French bread," 
explained the 5-foot-6 1/2-inch Simmons, who weighed 268 pounds in high school, 
before averaging out at 155 pounds in recent years. The show, he promised, will 
be "very funny, but also with a sensitive message. Nobody who sees it will ever 
make fun of an overweight person again." 
</P>
<P>
But can the ex-chub sing? 
</P>

"Powwow Highway," the serio-comic story of a contemporary Cheyenne's quest to 
find his ancestral roots, has drawn some critical raves. But David Seals, who 
wrote the novel on which it is based, is complaining that the Warner Bros. 
release is "another Hollywood whitewash." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a bad movie," Seals said on the phone from South Dakota. "The 
cinematography is good and some of the acting is OK. But they took the magic 
out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Seals, who said he's descended from the Huron tribe, sold film rights to his 
unpublished novel in 1985 for $10,000. (The film cost only $3 million to make.) 
He castigated director Jonathan Wacks for alleged insensitivities to American 
Indians, including shooting atop a sacred South Dakota butte. 
</P>
<P>
Wacks admitted that he began filming there until "religious zealots" objected. 
"We packed up and left," he said, finishing the scenes in Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
Wacks said that the script was approved by a Cheyenne tribal chief and elder 
before shooting began and that the cast is primarily American Indian; Seals' 
wife and son both have roles. Wacks also pointed out that "Powwow" won awards 
for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor (Gary Farmer, as the road 
warrior) at the American Indian Film Festival in San Francisco last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Why, then, is Seals so upset? 
</P>
<P>
"I think David really wanted to be the consultant on the movie (Hanay Geigomah, 
a UCLA professor of Native American studies, was hired instead)," Wacks said. 
"We felt we wanted an authentic movie. And we wanted someone with some 
distance, not the novelist. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no animosity toward David. I hope he cools out."

Also attending the Oscars will be Nancy Hale -- fresh from the kitchen. 
Producer Hale's "Portrait of Imogen" was nominated in the Best Documentary 
category, but it hasn't made her rich or famous. She spent recent weeks in her 
sister's Chicago gourmet shop and cafe, supervising a cooking crew and selling 
food delicacies to retail outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Hale, who has a baby daughter and a husband who is in grad school, moved from 
San Francisco to Chicago just before "Imogen's" release, convinced that "there 
was not enough money in making films to support a family. The films I did cost 
money rather than paying money." 
</P>
<P>
Now that her husband has finished his course work at Northwestern, the Hales 
plan to move back to California this fall. "Maybe I can make a living in film 
after all," she said, hopefully. From Stacy Jenel Smith

BASEBALL IS STARTING TO SEEM LIKE HOME BASE; 
</P>
<P>
FOR ACTOR AND DIRECTOR JAMES GAMMON, GAME YIELDS THE HIGH HOPE OF HAVING A HAND 
IN A COUPLE OF HITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lately, James Gammon has developed a real soft spot in his heart for baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, I got to meet Steve Yeager and Pete Vuckovich," the veteran actor said in 
his low-pitched, easygoing voice. "I'm not a rabid fan, but I do enjoy it. And 
as the season goes on, it gets more and more exciting. I love the emotion 
baseball has: guys getting right up in each other's faces, swinging cleats at 
each other, trying to run each other down, bean somebody with a ball." 
</P>
<P>
Gammon gives baseball equally high marks as theatrical fodder. Besides 
co-starring in the coming feature "Major League" (with Charlie Sheen and Corbin 
Bernsen), Gammon directs the premiere of David Higgins' ode to semi-pro 
baseball, "Bonu$ Baby," at the Victory Theatre in Burbank. He describes the 
piece, set in 1964, as "a gritty, lusty, romantic comedy -- and there's a teeny 
piece of mystery in it, too." 
</P>
<P>
Originally, Gammon had intended to perform in the play. Then he was asked if 
he'd direct it as well. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Why don't I just direct?' I'm not one of those people who can see 
what's happening around me when I'm involved; I tend to look at everything from 
the perspective of my character. As a director now, I'm always looking at the 
mechanics, trying to improve things, enhance them." 
</P>
<P>
Gammon wants actors to make their own choices. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to see my direction appear," he said. "To ask an actor to do something, 
have him do it, then have it come screaming out at you is just . . . wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Long a fixture in local theater, Gammon solidified his position in 1972 when he 
and actor friend Alan Vint pooled their funds (largely proceeds from their 
roles as baddies in the film "Macon County Line") and started the MET Theatre 
in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a beauty parlor, and we helped convert it," he said. Among the MET's 
work was a trilogy of Inge plays -- "Bus Stop," "Picnic" and "Dark at the Top 
of the Stairs" -- that won multiple Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Awards. 
</P>
<P>
Another MET highlight was its 1979 West Coast premiere of Sam Shepard's "The 
Curse of the Starving Class." Gammon (who'd done the role a year earlier at 
Joseph Papp's Public Theatre in New York) played the boozy, dropout father, 
Sally Kirkland his benighted wife. "It's my all-time favorite thing I've done," 
the actor said. "It was quite a time, very mesmeric for me. I loved its truths 
about the world. Like my character: 'I didn't ask for it, kid -- I just got 
it.' 
</P>
<P>
"I think it helps to have an affinity for the character you're playing, parts 
you can hang onto," he said. "But with 'Curse,' I didn't ever, ever do the part 
right. I got by, but I never did it. I always feel like there's a ton of work 
to do, a mountain -- but then we're opening, and there's a kind of death 'cause 
you're running and you can't change it, so you can't progress much more. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
After 1982, Gammon became much less involved in the running of the theater. In 
1985, the MET (on Poinsettia Place, off Melrose Avenue) closed its doors. The 
building is now a men's cosmetic factory. "It was time to move on," the father 
of two teen-age daughters said simply. "I guess it was exhaustion more than 
anything. We'd been doing about three shows a year. My kids were growing up. We 
lived next door to the theater, and we had a canteen next to that. 
</P>
<P>
"Poor Nan," he said of his wife. "Every time something was needed for the set 
-- a picture, a chair -- we'd come in and rob the house. If Nancy hadn't been 
handling the front for me, taking care of the press, watching out over 
everything, I wouldn't have been able to stay back there and put on the show. 
Now we're out in Temecula, about an hour and a half out of town. I don't know 
how long that'll last, but I like it there. It's so quiet." 
</P>
<P>
Gammon came from such a background, "a teeny town in Illinois with, like, 50 
people. Before coming to California at 25, "I was working as a television 
cameraman in Florida, doing community theater in my off-hours. Then one day I 
was reading an L.A. Times and saw ads for all these acting classes." 
</P>
<P>
And off he went. Gammon's mentor in those days was Lawrence Park, with 
</P>
<P>
whom he studied when he arrived in Los Angeles 20-some years ago. "He was a 
very strict, knowledgeable acting coach, very much the disciplinarian," he 
said. "Quite frankly, he terrified us students. We were actually afraid to 
breathe." 
</P>
<P>
In spite of those terrors, Gammon never considered giving up acting. "I 
remember my first play in seventh grade," he recalled warmly. "It was called 
'Toby Lights the Christmas Tree,' and I was Toby. Laughter and pats on the back 
do wonderful things for people. I suppose that acceptance, more than anything 
else, pushed me. Also, in the early days here, I had a scholarship -- so I was 
able to stay at the theater, help clean and do errands for Larry in exchange 
for classes. That way, I could attend classes six days a week." 
</P>
<P>
Gammon said he is pleased to be cast as a nice guy at long last. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm playing dads now. I just finished filming an NBC movie, 'Common 
Knowledge,' with Holly Hunter," his co-star in the 1987 Taper production of 
Shepard's "A Lie of the Mind." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a warm, supportive father in that. In 'Major League,' I'm a warm, 
supportive manager -- maybe a little grouchy in the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
He said he doesn't know why he was cast in bad-guy roles. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it's these slitty eyes. Everyone always says, 'Open your eyes, Gammon.' 
"

MUSIC NOTEBOOK: BULLISH ON DURHAM; 
</P>
<P>
COUNTRY SINGER DAVE DURHAM AND HIS BAND ARE GETTING LOTS OF AIR PLAY -- AND 
HOPING FOR AN AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ARKUSH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dave Durham, singer/songwriter for a San Fernando Valley-based country band, 
doesn't do much touring -- maybe a few gigs every six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
That may win him an award. 
</P>
<P>
The Academy of Country Music has listed his group, Dave Durham and the Bull 
Durham Band, as one of three finalists in the category of Best Non-Touring 
Band. The awards show will air April 10 on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very surprised by this," Durham said. "This came totally out of the 
blue." 
</P>
<P>
Durham, of Van Nuys, is still beaming over the frequent air play of his recent 
single, "In My Car," the tale of a freeway driver singing during the daily 
commute: 
</P>
<P>
 In my car 
</P>
<P>
 I'm the best I've heard 
</P>
<P>
 I do two shows a day, to and from work 
</P>
<P>
 I'm a star in my car. 
</P>
<P>
 Durham said the song is being played at about 115 radio stations nationwide 
and was recently listed 19th on the chart of popular songs recorded by 
independent record labels. "In My Car" is distributed by Pearl Records. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's just a matter of time before Billboard notices us," Durham said. 
"The song has a life of its own." 
</P>
<P>
It's a life that almost never happened. Durham said he wrote the melody a 
couple of years ago and then forgot about it. One day last year, he was going 
through some tapes when 
</P>
<P>
he rediscovered it. He immediately penned the lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
"I had sung some nonsensical words the first time, and when I went over it, 
something popped out," Durham said. "I don't even know how I got started in 
this direction." 
</P>
<P>
His venture into country music can be more easily traced. In high school, 
Durham played in rock 'n' roll bands and began an extensive record collection 
that includes Led Zeppelin. But when he heard Roger Miller's "King of the 
Road," he realized which musical path to take. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just something about country music that hits me," Durham said. "It's 
story-oriented, which I love, and the delivery shows so much conviction. I grew 
up in Indiana, and my mom and dad used to play hillbilly music all the time. I 
guess it just always stuck with me." 
</P>
<P>
His group, which has been together for five years, used to be called the Bull 
Durham Band. (Durham earned the nickname "Bull" when he played football in high 
school.) Last year's popular baseball movie of the same name forced the band to 
alter its name. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Durham was selected male entertainer of the year by the Los Angeles 
chapter of California Country Music Assn. He will attend next month's Academy 
of Country Music presentation. 
</P>
<P>
"Should I wear what I wear on stage or should I get a tuxedo?" Durham asked. 
</P>
<P>
Durham will be on stage Tuesday night at KCSN's Barn Dance at the Palomino in 
North Hollywood.

BEEF UP TO TANGO: SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE AT NORAH'S PLACE, INCLUDING NEW HEALTH 
FOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The yellow sign, its flashing lights and the words "EAT IN . . . OUT" do not 
really prepare you for Norah's Place. 
</P>
<P>
It's an Argentine restaurant. It's an Italian restaurant. It's a Bolivian 
restaurant. It's a dress-up, live-music nightclub, with a cover charge after 9 
p.m. On Monday and Thursday nights, it's a dance studio -- specializing in the 
tango. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Norah's Place is probably the quinoa capital of Southern California. 
Quinoa (KEEN-wah), in case you haven't heard, is the latest magic grain on the 
health food circuit, promising to be everything amaranth wasn't. (You missed 
the amaranth era? Sorry.) 
</P>
<P>
Quinoa is the seed of a variety of the common weed, goosefoot, which was one of 
the mainstays of the ancient Inca diet. So many nutrients are apparently packed 
into each little seed that they could, well, practically explode. 
</P>
<P>
However, Norah's Place is nothing like a health food restaurant. The Argentine 
component alone means that the menu is heavily laden with meat -- particularly 
beef. A dish like parillada might give a quinoa enthusiast the karmic jitters 
for a week: big grilled pieces of either beef or chicken plus a semi-aged pork 
sausage, a great big blood sausage, some grilled sweetbreads and a braided 
length of milk tripe. And all quite good, though the pleasantly chewy texture 
of the grilled tripe may not be enough to persuade people who don't like tripe. 
</P>
<P>
There are two very good table sauces for meat: llaqua, a hot yellow chili 
sauce, and chimichurri, a thick paste of ground thyme and vinegar, flavored 
with garlic and red pepper. The third sauce that appears on the table, though, 
is not for meat. It's a mixture of tomato, onion and hearts of palm for putting 
on your salad after the oil and vinegar. 
</P>
<P>
As a self-respecting Argentine restaurant, Norah's naturally serves a number of 
Italian dishes. There's a list of pastas, nothing very exotic to look at it but 
in the Argentine-Italian tradition positively loaded with garlic. A huge plate 
of rigatoni con broccoli in cream sauce will protect the average person from 
vampires for at least two days. 
</P>
<P>
The Italian influence goes further than that, though. Even the breaded steaks 
known as milanesas, found in most Latin restaurants, have a particularly 
Italian coloring here. The one called napolitana is a paper-thin sheet of 
breaded ham, topped with tomato sauce and melted mozzarella. 
</P>
<P>
As at most Argentine-Italian restaurants in Los Angeles, the Argentine dish 
matambre, a mixture of vegetables rolled up in a steak and roasted, is quite 
Italianized. It's made with veal breast instead of flank steak, and in fact 
it's virtually the Genoese dish cima. That it's served as an appetizer shows 
how much it has been altered; the real Argentine matambre is a far from 
delicate dish, as its name, "hunger-killer," indicates. 
</P>
<P>
The Bolivian dishes occupy a short section of the menu, but include the best of 
Norah's appetizers: a little flat pie (empanada) with a spicy filling like 
Mexican chorizo, and an egg-shaped pie called saltena, filled with stewed beef 
and onions. Some of the Bolivian entrees might be hard to distinguish from the 
Argentine grilled meats, and others, such as lomo saltado, could pass for the 
Creole cooking of just about any Latin American country. It's beef sauteed with 
onions and tomatoes (well, some cheese is melted on top of it). 
</P>
<P>
The steak called lapping is another matter. On one level it's just a steak, 
although a marinated one. But to encourage the marinade, and possibly to speed 
up cooking as well, the meat is deeply scored in a crisscross pattern. It comes 
to the table looking like hedgehog, or perhaps a sort of lumpy waffle-iron made 
of meat. It's very good, and of course part of the cutting has already been 
done for you. 
</P>
<P>
And now it's quinoa time. I can't tell whether the primary motivation for 
featuring quinoa on this menu is nutrition-consciousness or pride in heritage 
(the wine list is certainly heritage-proud, listing dozens of Argentine wines). 
In any case, a serious attempt is being made to star quinoa in some dishes. 
</P>
<P>
This is an uphill battle because grains can rarely sustain a starring role, and 
the rich filling and the molasses sauce are barely enough to make the quinoa 
cake a decent dessert, interesting though its texture is. For dessert I'd 
prefer the panqueques, simple crepes with a caramel filling, unless I was 
really in the mood for megavitamins and mega-proteins. 
</P>
<P>
 Recommended dishes: empanada, $1.50; sopa de quinoa, $2; napolitana, $8.95; 
lapping, $8.50; panqueques, $2. 
</P>
<P>
 Norah's Place, 5667 Lankershim Blvd., North Hollywood, (818) 980-6900. Open 5 
to 11 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday, 11 a.m. to 1 a.m. Friday and Saturday, and 
11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Sunday. Full bar. Parking lot. American Express, Carte 
Blanche and Diners Club accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $21 to $42.

ART NOTEBOOK: WORK OF PHOTOGRAPHER WHO GETS THE JUMP ON LAKERS -- 'FROZEN 
MOMENTS' IN TIME

Malek Monsour loves basketball. He played with the UCLA Bruins in 1970. Now, as 
the L.A. Lakers' regular photographer, he shoots pictures instead of baskets. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the aspects of the game that's hard to see is how high they jump and 
exactly what they do in midair," Monsour said. "I try to capture those moments 
and freeze them." 
</P>
<P>
"Frozen Moments" is the title of Monsour's one-man photography exhibit, which 
opens at Beverly Hills' Galerie Michael on April 6. More than 50 color and 
black-and-white photographs will be on display, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic 
Johnson and James Worthy (among other Lakers) will be at a champagne reception 
opening night. 
</P>
<P>
The photos, taken during the last nine basketball seasons, differ from 
journalistic sports photography in that Monsour consciously attempted to get 
what he calls "a pure artistic appreciation of the game," concentrating on the 
balletic movements of the players rather than trying to tell a complete story 
with each picture. 
</P>
<P>
"People get so caught up in who's winning and losing, and keeping score, they 
tend to lose what's really going on in the game. That's what I try to show 
them," Monsour said. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit will continue through April 30. 
</P>
<P>
Galerie Michael, 430 N. Rodeo Drive. (213) 273-3377. Open 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. 
Mondays and Tuesdays, 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Wednesdays and Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 
11 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays, and noon to 6 p.m. Sundays.

<P>
RISING FOR THE OCCASION: "Catch a Rising Artist" is the title of the L.A. Arts 
Council's second annual art auction, to be held at 6:30 p.m. April 8 at the 
Marina Beach Hotel in Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
Two works apiece by 30 artists will be auctioned at the gala dinner, with 
proceeds benefiting the Arts Council's art scholarship program and operating 
funds. All works were picked by an in-house selection committee concentrating 
on art that is both affordable and produced by artists living in Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
The public can view the works free from 4 to 6:30 p.m. in the hotel lobby. The 
works include the origami of Sherman Oaks' Hyunsook Cho, acrylics by Santa 
Monica's David Garcia and pictures by Los Angeles photographer Howard 
Rosenfeld. Tickets for the gala are $125.

DOWN UNDER ON MELROSE: The CAZ Gallery in West Hollywood is presenting "Women 
Painters on the Central Desert," an exhibit featuring works by some of 
Australia's leading aboriginal women artists: Banduk Marika, Alison Anderson 
Nampijinpa and Mary Dixon Nungurrayi. 
</P>
<P>
Each artist tells tjukurrpa or "dreamtime" stories -- set in a time before the 
creation of mankind -- in her paintings. The stories have been handed down from 
generation to generation. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Central Desert, the separation of duties between the sexes is rather 
well-defined," said gallery owner Carol Lopes. "There are dreamings only the 
men know, dreamings only the ritual leaders know and, finally, what is 
appropriate for everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Each painting has various levels of meaning, incorporating mythology, history 
and topography. Access to the secrets contained within the paintings is 
maintained by a strict caste system that has been in effect among the 
aborigines for thousands of years. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit continues through April 30. 
</P>
<P>
CAZ Gallery, 8715 Melrose Ave. (213) 652-6952. Open 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Mondays 
through Fridays and 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturdays.

U.S. TO HALT ALL AK-47S AT THE BORDER; 
</P>
<P>
ACTS UPON LEARNING OF LICENSES FOR 400,000 IMPORTS 
</P>

<P>
A Treasury Department agency, stunned when it discovered that it had given gun 
dealers permission to import more than 400,000 AK-47s and other assault rifles, 
has ordered the Customs Service to halt all shipments of the weapons at the 
nation's borders, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
The action goes far beyond steps taken earlier this month, when the 
Administration announced a temporary moratorium on issuing new permits for five 
types of assault weapons, including the AK-47. 
</P>
<P>
It essentially revokes licenses that already had been issued to gun importers, 
a step almost certain to be challenged in court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Controversial Move 
</P>
<P>
William T. Drake, a top official at Treasury's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms, acknowledged in an interview that the move would be controversial. 
But he said that an internal audit detailing the vast extent of imports already 
authorized had persuaded the agency to take the emergency action. 
</P>
<P>
The bureau refused to disclose how many weapons have been approved for 
importation, but a knowledgeable Customs Service source said the number is 
420,000. 
</P>
<P>
These weapons were not affected by the moratorium two weeks ago, which only 
blocked approval of new applications for weapons imports. When the action was 
taken, new applications for importation of 110,000 assault weapons were 
pending. The moratorium will be lifted only if importers can prove that the 
weapons are used generally for sporting purposes. 
</P>
<P>
About 70,000 assault rifles have been imported into the United States in the 
last three years, according to bureau officials. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the moratorium on new permits, the officials indicated that they 
had no power to restrict imports of weapons for which permits had already been 
granted. But Drake said that the agency, which has been trying to persuade 
importers to halt assault-gun shipments voluntarily, believes that it has the 
authority to make that ban mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'God Taketh Away' 
</P>
<P>
The authority comes, he contended, from the Gun Control Act of 1968, which 
empowered the bureau to grant licenses authorizing gun imports. "What God 
giveth," Drake said of the permission to import weapons, "God can taketh away." 
</P>
<P>
The bureau's order, transmitted orally Thursday and made formal in a directive 
issued by Drake Friday afternoon, officially bars five types of assault weapons 
from entering the United States. 
</P>
<P>
They include a wide variety of AKS-type weapons, including the Chinese-made 
AK-47 and Finnish M-76, the Israeli Uzi carbine, the Belgian FNC, Austrian and 
Belgian FAL-type weapons and German Aug-type weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Customs agents across the country were ordered Friday to begin enforcing the 
order and were equipped with lists of assault-gun importers so that they might 
more easily identify the weapons shipments. As of Friday evening, however, no 
new shipments of assault weapons had arrived at U.S. ports, Administration 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Under arrangements worked out by Customs and the Treasury agency, any of the 
banned weapons that do arrive in the United States will be barred from entry 
until it is determined whether the weapons are generally used for sporting 
purposes. Only such weapons may be imported under U.S. laws. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bond Will Be Required 
</P>
<P>
Until that decision is reached, importers will be permitted to store the 
weapons in their own warehouses. The weapons will remain under Customs Service 
jurisdiction, however, and the importers will be required to leave a 
substantial bond on deposit with Customs. 
</P>
<P>
The effective confiscation of the rifles is almost certain to result in legal 
action as furious gun importers attempt to overturn the directive, 
Administration officials warned. 
</P>
<P>
The importers, they noted, stand to profit enormously in what has become a 
seller's market for assault weapons across much of the country. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the Administration ban and the decision by Colt Industries to 
take its AR-15 rifle off the market, gun enthusiasts -- fearful that the 
weapons might be banned altogether -- have bought up most of the assault rifles 
available. As demand has boomed, prices have skyrocketed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Painstaking Search 
</P>
<P>
When the ban on new permits was imposed two weeks ago, bureau officials said 
that they had no idea how many assault weapons might still be imported under 
existing authorization. The discovery that the number exceeded 400,000 resulted 
from a painstaking two-week search of the agency's files, which are not 
computerized. 
</P>
<P>
Although refusing to confirm that figure, Drake said the fact that permission 
to import had already been granted for a large number of weapons did not 
necessarily mean that the weapons would have been imported. 
</P>
<P>
Often, he said, gun dealers who plan to import fewer than 100 weapons file 
"Form 6" documents requesting permission to import 10,000 or even 20,000. The 
agency has no authority to ask dealers to modify such requests. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they were worried, however, that the increased demand for 
assault weapons might have prompted dealers to place orders for all the guns 
they were authorized to import. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concerns Eased 
</P>
<P>
Customs Service officials initially expressed qualms about the new import ban. 
But their concerns were eased when the bureau, with its directive Friday, took 
full responsibility for the order. That would make it likely that the bureau -- 
not Customs -- would face court challenges, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Drake said that the decision had been taken by the bureau under consultation 
with Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady.

CRACK WARS LEAVE D.C. UNDER SIEGE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In blighted brick housing projects and row houses just minutes from the grand 
marble buildings that represent the seat of national government, a city's 
obsession with cheap, addictive crack cocaine flares out of control. 
</P>
<P>
Almost every night, street scuffles end with a burst of gunfire, the shriek of 
sirens and yet another young black man turned corpse. 
</P>
<P>
The blood bath is overwhelming. Drug peddlers kill competitors over a 
disrespectful stare. Rivals are executed in their car on a dark, heavily wooded 
street that was once a lovers' lane. High school boys eager to become 
"hustlers" are shot to death while hanging out with the dealers they so admire. 
Shots are fired with chilling accuracy; there is little random spraying of 
gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Murder Capital 
</P>
<P>
An anguished District of Columbia is America's newly crowned murder capital. 
Its homicide rate has more than doubled in less than 15 months. By Friday there 
had been 120 killings already this year in a city of only 650,000. An estimated 
60% of the murders were drug related. 
</P>
<P>
Police are so overburdened that evidence investigators lag hundreds of cases 
behind. Residents calling police to report a burglary sometimes wait hours for 
a response. A television station devotes a nightly half-hour, called "City 
Under Siege," to the body count. 
</P>
<P>
Washington these days is the subject of much the same unwanted national 
attention for its crack wars that Los Angeles received in 1988 for its street 
gang wars. 
</P>
<P>
Both crises are rooted in the numbing despair of ghetto life. Both have sparked 
debates on the relationship between crime and poverty and whether America's 
drug crisis can best be attacked by cracking down on users or attacking foreign 
suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problem Explodes 
</P>
<P>
But while Los Angeles' gang murders are a long-term problem that popped into 
the nation's consciousness last year when two South-Central Los Angeles gangs 
took their violence to fashionable Westwood Village, the crack wars of 
Washington have exploded with shocking speed. 
</P>
<P>
And while Los Angeles' biggest homicide problem remains murders that grow out 
of a deeply embedded street psychosis, in which the murder of innocents is 
rationalized by gang rivalries, Washington is seized by a raw economic struggle 
among local and out-of-town drug distributors and independent street dealers. 
</P>
<P>
The battle is over the right to use thousands of vacant lots, apartment 
courtyards and alleys to sell the small $10 and $20 chunks of crack cocaine to 
an increasingly frenzied clientele that comes not only from the inner city but 
from the suburbs of Virginia and Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
"The fighting is over customers," said E. J. Spurlock, a deputy chief of the 
district Police Department. "This town is like an infant when it comes to 
crack. Nobody's been able to get a hold." 
</P>
<P>
Adjacent suburban areas are also experiencing record murder rates. On 
Wednesday, an Alexandria, Va., policeman was shot to death at a public housing 
complex by a shotgun-wielding man who took five hostages and demanded crack. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the fact that Washington does not have an entrenched network of 
street gangs like Los Angeles is one of the reasons that crack has caused so 
much bloodshed here, according to law enforcement sources. The lack of any 
traditional "turf" lines has led to a chaotic marketplace devoid of kingpins, 
rules or mercy, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Drug trading is brazen. At nearly 100 spots in the district, what police call 
"open-air markets" flourish, attracting scores or hundreds of buyers and 
sellers. In these densely crowded markets, betrayals and gunfire are 
inevitable. On hundreds of other depressed streets, in front of liquor stores 
and take-out restaurants and sagging chain-link fences that guard apartment 
complexes, lone dealers, flashing hand signs to indicate the type or price of 
their drug, flag down drive-up customers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weighing the Slaughter 
</P>
<P>
The violence that grows out of this business climate has given Washington a 
per-capita rate of drug-related killings that is more than five times Los 
Angeles' rate of gang killings. 
</P>
<P>
The particularly vicious addiction and aggressive, paranoid behavior that crack 
produces has contributed significantly to the slaughter, police say. 
</P>
<P>
Street dealers, most of whom are crack addicts, routinely get into fights with 
customers or suppliers. Lies, rip-offs and retaliation over what one officer 
calls "wounded manhood" are common. 
</P>
<P>
"Half of the killing is over nothing," said Sheldon Reese, a 34-year-old, 
self-confessed small-time criminal who says he does not sell drugs but travels 
in neighborhoods where crack is king. Last year he saw his 14-year-old son 
become a street dealer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like, a couple weeks ago a guy got killed on a street near me," said 
Reese, who spoke on condition his real name not be used. "He was buying a rock 
(of cocaine) from a guy. The guy put it in his hand. He said, 'No,' he didn't 
want to buy it after all. The guy shot him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confused Debate 
</P>
<P>
"A whole lot is over things like that. The people who sell heroin, they sit 
here and look at that and say, 'Lord, these (crack) people are crazy.' " 
</P>
<P>
Local and national politics have made the debate over what to do about the 
bloodshed as confused as the drug environment. 
</P>
<P>
The moral authority of Washington's mayor, Marion Barry, has been undermined by 
allegations that he uses cocaine and associates with drug dealers. Frustrated 
U.S. senators have threatened to fill the void by imposing federal control over 
the city's police force. And new federal drug czar William J. Bennett has 
promised to make the district a "test case" in the government's war on drugs, 
suggesting that he will deploy federal agents to "secure the perimeter" and 
allow the city's residents to reclaim the streets. 
</P>
<P>
While other drugs like heroin, PCP and marijuana have always been sold in 
depressed neighborhoods like Trinidad and Anacostia in the district's northeast 
and southeast quadrants, where the bulk of the crack murders now occur, nothing 
prepared residents for this level of madness. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crack Comes to Town 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, in fact, homicides had been decreasing sharply. From 1982 to 
1985 they fell 50%, to 148, a per-capita rate about equal to today's rate in 
Los Angeles. Only about 17% of the killings were drug-related. 
</P>
<P>
Then in 1986 crack came to town, two years after being introduced in Los 
Angeles and New York. 
</P>
<P>
In the next two years, murders in the district rose 54%. Half were blamed on 
disputes among people buying, selling or using drugs. 
</P>
<P>
That was nothing compared to what happened in 1988. Killings leaped from 228 to 
372, breaking the district's record of 287 set in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
In January, statistics showed that last year's per-capita murder rate -- 58 per 
100,000 citizens -- narrowly edged out a grateful Detroit, the previous 
title-holder. Los Angeles, with a per-capita rate of 24 per 100,000, 
experienced a 12% drop in homicides last year even though its gang murders were 
rising by 25%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Killing Pace 
</P>
<P>
With Washington's unwanted national notoriety came even more murders. They are 
now occurring 64% ahead of last year's pace. If the trend holds, drug-related 
homicides in the district will claim 370 lives this year. In Los Angeles, which 
has five times the population, gang deaths are expected to total about 315. 
</P>
<P>
In the same way that Los Angeles police conducted massive sweeps of suspected 
gang members last year, Washington police have arrested 46,000 people in the 
last two years in sweeps of drug-selling sites. However, many suspects were 
quickly released. The sweeps "disrupted us more than it did them," Spurlock 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Clergymen have attempted to mobilize law-abiding citizens. The Nation of Islam 
drove drug dealers out of one housing complex permanently with patrols 
augmented by police. And local politicians have proposed new laws, such as 
eviction of suspected drug dealers, new powers for police to disperse loiterers 
and an 11 p.m. curfew for youths under 18, the latter of which was temporarily 
blocked by a federal judge just hours before it was to go into effect. Midnight 
basketball leagues have been started to keep teen-agers off the street. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sobering Proximity 
</P>
<P>
As was the case 21 years ago, when riots broke out in poor Washington 
neighborhoods in the wake of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, there 
is a sobering proximity between the Capitol and the crack wars, which are 
fought only one to three miles away. 
</P>
<P>
Few physical barriers divide the two cultures. In marked contrast to Los 
Angeles, there is no network of freeways allowing commuters to cut through 
centers of urban crime and see nothing but the lane markers. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the distance between power and poverty is enormous. Even as waves 
of gentrification take over neighborhoods that whites once regarded as 
off-limits, the district remains largely segregated. At day's end, the poor, 
most of them black, migrate to the city's northeast, southeast and southwest 
quadrants. 
</P>
<P>
The wealthy head the other way, to the tree-lined streets and $300,000 homes of 
northwest Washington west of Rock Creek Park. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Urgency Tempered 
</P>
<P>
Any sense of urgency that the rich might have has been tempered by the fact 
that the crack wars have claimed few non-participants. Mayor Barry frequently 
claims that 80% of the killings are "assassinations" which cannot be stopped by 
any additional police effort. In Los Angeles, by comparison, police say at 
least half the victims of gang violence are not gang members. 
</P>
<P>
Travel agents assure convention planners that Washington is still a nice place 
to visit. Washingtonian magazine printed its first editorial in 24 years, 
proclaiming: "This is still a good city." And a defensive Barry has urged the 
federal government to spend its time and money wiping out coca crops in South 
America and to stay out of his city's business. 
</P>
<P>
"To suggest that the city is under siege is not an accurate reading," said H. 
H. Brookins, bishop of the district's African Methodist Episcopal churches, who 
came here last year after serving as AME bishop in Los Angeles. "Certain 
pockets, yes, but not all over." 
</P>
<P>
But among many blacks, who make up 70% of the district's population, and 
particularly among those who live, work or travel through the afflicted 
neighborhoods, an intense, hopeless kind of hand-wringing is taking place. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wrenching Reminder 
</P>
<P>
More than anywhere else, Washington is a wrenching reminder that homicide is 
the nation's leading cause of death for black males between 15 and 34. Last 
year 90% of the victims and 80% of the suspects in Washington's murders were 
black, and one-fifth of the suspects were 18 or 19. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, after 19-year-old Vondalia Robinson was shot to death by cross 
fire between rival drug dealers outside a popular nightclub in a dangerous part 
of town, a local gospel station broadcast her funeral to try to stir citizen 
outrage. 
</P>
<P>
"What can we do?" asked the station's commentator, broadcasting live from the 
funeral home. "What can we do?" 
</P>
<P>
Life now has disintegrated into "total chaos, a hopelessness that pervades 
every aspect of life," said Cathy Hughes, owner of another local radio station. 
"It means living in hell. The killings are taking place in the ghetto now. But 
the way the drugs were able to escape from ghettoes, so will the killing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
L.A. Experience 
</P>
<P>
When crack was introduced into Los Angeles' poor black neighborhoods in 1984, 
it created a fierce demand among thousands of people who became quickly 
addicted to smoking the "rocks" of cocaine. And, as happened in Washington, 
residents complained bitterly to police about dealers on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
But gradually, as many of Los Angeles' black gang members became involved in 
the highly profitable drug trade, either as middlemen or as street dealers, 
they tended to restrict themselves to their own gang territories, which had 
evolved since the early 1970s. These 250 or so small chunks of turf claimed by 
individual "sets" of Bloods and Crips gang members throughout Los Angeles 
County indirectly brought some rationality and order to the marketing of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Although gang murders do take place over drug disputes in Los Angeles, the 
strong majority are not drug-related. For example, the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department says only seven of the 96 gang murders it handled last 
year were drug-related. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New York Connection 
</P>
<P>
Because crack can be sold in Washington for twice the price it brings in New 
York, cocaine suppliers and free-lance dealers from New York, many of them 
Jamaicans with notorious reputations for violence, have swarmed to the 
district, frequently clashing with local dealers. 
</P>
<P>
"We had one street in southeast where we had New Yorkers (selling) at the top 
of the hill, Jamaicans on the bottom and locals trying to keep a foothold. It 
was war," one policeman said. 
</P>
<P>
The rings in Washington filter the drug down through a network of lieutenants, 
who are normally in charge of breaking a kilo or two of cocaine a week into 
smokable "rock" form and cutting deals with hundreds of street dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Police say a street dealer typically pays $300 to $600 for a half-ounce of 
cocaine. He can sell about 50 small rocks at $20 apiece -- $10 apiece in very 
poor neighborhoods -- nearly doubling his money within a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fatal Mistakes 
</P>
<P>
Mistakes are not forgiven. 
</P>
<P>
In northeast Washington, police said, a street dealer named JoJo was "fronted" 
10 small packs of crack by another dealer named Angie, who worked for a 
lieutenant named Earl. Rather than selling the crack and returning the bulk of 
the profits to Angie, JoJo used the crack himself. The word went up to Earl. An 
enforcer came to JoJo's home, clubbed him with a baseball bat and shot him 
twice through the head. 
</P>
<P>
The New York rings routinely pay welfare families for the use of their 
apartments, police say, and leave underlings there to handle business. A 
detective who recently raided an apartment found that the suspects in charge 
were five children from the Bronx, ages 12 to 15, who had been there two days 
selling crack. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Headen, who teaches health and physical education at a high school near 
a drug-infested neighborhood in the northeast quadrant, hears these stories. He 
has already had one drug-dealing student in his school killed and has heard 
that several former students have been murdered, including 21-year-old John 
Stokes Jr. A star high school football player, Stokes came home last year after 
being suspended from college and was arrested on suspicion of selling PCP. He 
subsequently became one of at least 20 victims of a war between several crack 
rings in his neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Boy on the Brink 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend Headen sat in his living room in a pleasant neighborhood in 
northwest Washington, where there are no street dealers, and thought about 
another boy who could go either way. Like Stokes, this one is a football 
player, a promising one. But he hasn't been able to keep up with the school 
district's C-average requirement and is ineligible to play. He spends his time 
selling drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now (when) I talk to some coaches, they say, 'Well, look, Coach, if he 
graduates maybe we can get him in junior college,' " Headen said. "That would 
be the best thing that could happen to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I could get him out in Kansas, Nebraska -- somewhere where he just 
can't come home on the weekends." 
</P>

 Washington's most troublesome crime problem is drug-related murders. Los 
Angeles' is killings by gang members, many of them growing out of drug disputes 
but the majority attributed by police to festering gang rivalries. Here is a

700 ABORTION FOES ARRESTED AT L.A. CLINIC; 
</P>
<P>
MOVEMENT FOUNDER IS BOOKED AS POLICE TAKE TOUGHER ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Anti-abortion militants, rallying on the third and last day of Easter Week 
demonstrations, descended on a Los Angeles clinic Saturday but ran up against a 
boisterous throng of pro-choice activists and a toughened police force. More 
than 700 abortion foes were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's demonstration was the largest in a three-day assault on Southern 
California family planning clinics staged by the New York-based anti-abortion 
group, Operation Rescue. Four Operation Rescue members will face felony 
charges, including the group's founder, Randall Terry. 
</P>
<P>
"We asked them not to come to L.A.," said Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, who 
arrived at the scene of Saturday's demonstration to personally oversee about 
300 police officers assigned to ending Operation Rescue's sit-in at Family 
Planning Associates on Westmoreland Avenue west of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Willful Children' 
</P>
<P>
"These are willful children . . . having tantrums," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gates also announced the city would seek to have Operation Rescue pay the costs 
of Saturday's police operation -- estimated by officials at $100,000. The city 
attorney's office said it will demand the costs in addition to other penalties 
when it takes arrested demonstrators to court. 
</P>
<P>
But Operation Rescue leaders angrily charged that police had brutalized their 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-abortionists canceled a post-demonstration rally because their leaders 
were jailed, but said they were calling area ministers, beseeching them to 
speak out on their behalf in Easter Sunday services today. They said they want 
to bring pressure on the district attorney to drop charges against those 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
About 300 pro-choice supporters celebrated what they viewed as the day's 
successes at a rally at Patriotic Hall Saturday night. They drank champagne and 
sang songs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Victory Claims 
</P>
<P>
While both sides claimed success and planned future strategies, Operation 
Rescue leaders acknowledged they had failed to produce the numbers of 
protesters they promised during their three-day siege of the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
Pro-choice activists at least matched the number of anti-abortion demonstrators 
and displayed a keen sense of organization that may have caught Operation 
Rescue off guard. Even though Operation Rescue took great pains to keep 
locations of its demonstrations secret, scores of pro-choice people were lined 
up at the clinic awaiting their enemy when the anti-abortion caravan arrived 
from Anaheim at 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Under a steady rain, more than 1,400 demonstrators representing both sides of 
the abortion issue surrounded the clinic near the edge of Koreatown. Operation 
Rescue members waved pictures of aborted fetuses and shielded themselves from 
the rain with plastic garbage bags, while pro-choice advocates chanted slogans, 
such as "Jesus is pro-choice." 
</P>
<P>
Police, some on horseback and in riot gear, cordoned off a four-block area and 
gave the order to disperse at about 9 a.m., after a clinic staff member signed 
a criminal complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Pro-choice people moved, but most of the Operation Rescue members stayed fast, 
praying and singing hymns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Four Felony Counts 
</P>
<P>
Police then moved in and spent the next four hours arresting the demonstrators 
one by one. Most were handcuffed and taken or dragged to waiting vans and buses 
as the other side jeered. While most were cited on misdemeanor trespassing 
charges, four leaders will be booked on felony charges of conspiracy to commit 
a crime, Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first to be arrested was Operation Rescue founder Terry, a 
29-year-old former car salesman who has injected elements of militant civil 
disobedience into the anti-abortion movement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Urging Them On 
</P>
<P>
Terry stood, bullhorn in hand, urging his followers to fan out and sit on the 
pavement to block access to the clinic even after police had given the order to 
disperse. 
</P>
<P>
Four officers approached Terry and bound his hands with plastic cuffs behind 
his back. When he appeared to struggle, the officers dragged him to a curb and 
lay him face down on the street, his face in a puddle of water. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, sweet Jesus, save me," he cried between prayers. 
</P>
<P>
Later, police closed in to arrest three other leaders who continued to exhort 
the crowd to block access to the clinic. Those being arrested allegedly 
resisted and were wrestled to the pavement by officers. Several officers were 
knocked to the ground in the scuffle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Criticized 
</P>
<P>
Operation Rescue scheduled a press conference late Saturday to denounce what 
they said was mistreatment and "excessive force" used by police. One man's face 
was rubbed into the pavement and a pastor was stepped on by a horse, charged 
Russ Neal, who was arrested and later released. 
</P>
<P>
Gates, defending the force used by his officers, said earlier that the 
technique is called a "pain compliance hold" and is effective when 
demonstrators make their bodies go limp. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should a police officer have to hurt his back when these people can walk. 
So we use a little pain compliance," said Gates. "We have wheelchairs if they 
can't walk." 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department came under fire last month when a smaller demonstration 
by Operation Rescue ended in no arrests -- even though two clinics were forced 
to close. Some pro-choice groups questioned whether some department leaders 
might be sympathetic to the anti-abortion cause. 
</P>
<P>
Pro-choice activists were pleased with their supporters' performance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leader Is Elated 
</P>
<P>
"We've out-smarted, outmaneuvered and beat" the anti-abortionists, said an 
elated Kathy Spillar, national spokeswoman for the Feminist Majority. 
</P>
<P>
"People who support abortion rights have seen that this was successful, and I 
think Operation Rescue is on notice," Spillar said. 
</P>
<P>
"The battle is just starting," proclaimed Linda Burstyn, spokeswoman for the 
American Civil Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Operation Rescue were also claiming victory. 
</P>
<P>
"If one baby is allowed to live because of this, it's a victory," said a man 
who identified himself as Paul, 42, of Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
"I've ignored this for 20 years, and I just can't do that anymore." 
</P>
<P>
"There's no telling how many babies were saved," declared one man as he drove 
up to Parker Center in search of jailed comrades. He drove away in a van with 
"Read the Bible" written on a side panel before giving his name. 
</P>
<P>
While some women have canceled abortion appointments in recent days, on 
Saturday lawyers from the ACLU intercepted patients headed for the clinic on 
Westmoreland and, as the demonstrations raged, shuttled them to other abortion 
clinics -- including one in Cypress, hit by Operation Rescue on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clinic 'on Schedule' 
</P>
<P>
And, once the commotion died down, several patients who had been inside the 
clinic during the demonstrations departed, and others entered, escorted by 
pro-choice activists. A private security guard who refused to identify himself 
said the clinic made arrangements to get patients in early and was "right on 
schedule" with the day's appointments. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic is part of a 28-facility statewide chain. But it is one of only two 
facilities in the chain that performs abortions up to 24 weeks, according to a 
staff member. Most others perform abortions only up to 13 weeks of gestation. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, smoke bombs were hurled into a pre-demonstration rally held by 
Operation Rescue at Melodyland in Anaheim. No injuries were reported. Three 
suspects were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with the huge number of arrests in Saturday's demonstration, police had 
to turn to makeshift booking centers, including the nearby Bellevue Recreation 
Center and the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
At Bellevue, where an Easter egg hunt and a basketball game were scheduled for 
Saturday, police converted the basketball court into a temporary holding area. 
The back offices were used as a processing center to book the protesters, many 
of whom waited on bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Signs of Support 
</P>
<P>
Terry came through the door, walked a few steps to a search area. Without being 
asked, he braced his head against the wall and spread his legs. He was 
eventually taken to police headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
As Terry was being processed, he received some unexpected support. 
</P>
<P>
"You are talking to the pro-life detail," Detective Bob Thoreson, whose job it 
was to take booking pictures, told Terry. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you mean?" the anti-abortion leader asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean," Thoreson replied, "that most of the guys in the building are active 
one way or another for life." 
</P>
<P>
Arrested demonstrators who identified themselves and had not been arrested 
before were released on their own recognizance. Those who gave their names as 
Jane or John Doe, or who had been arrested before, were bused to jail. 
Arraignments were scheduled for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Police were taking their time about the booking procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Vita Cicoria, who was directing the flow of bodies and paper, 
explained the pacing: "What we are not going to do is release them so quickly 
that they can go out again."

AUTO-TRUCK CRASH IN LANCASTER KILLS WOMAN, BOY, 5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 28-year-old woman and a 5-year-old boy were killed Saturday when their car 
was hit by a fast-moving pickup truck as the car attempted to cross a highway 
in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
The names of the victims, who authorities said may be from the same family, 
were not immediately available because next of kin had not been notified. 
</P>
<P>
A CHP spokeswoman said that the driver of the car, Hoang Hang, 24, of Los 
Angeles, was crossing Sierra Highway on Avenue G at 9:15 a.m. when he pulled 
out into the path of a pickup driven by Mike Goodwill, 24, of Rosamond. 
Goodwill's truck was traveling at about 50 m.p.h. It was not clear whether Hang 
had first stopped at a stop sign, the spokeswoman said. Both drivers suffered 
major injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Two other children were traveling in Hang's car. One, a 3-year-old girl, 
suffered moderate injuries and was in serious but stable condition at the 
Antelope Valley center. The other, a 7-year-old girl, suffered minor injuries 
and was in stable condition at the Lancaster facility.

OCEANSIDE SEES WATERFRONT RESORT HOTEL AS WAY TO ERASE ITS 'HONKY-TONK' IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE YASUDA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Undeterred by failures, Oceanside leaders are determined to revitalize the 
city's harbor area and have once again begun negotiations with developers to 
lure a major resort hotel to the waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Oceanside City Council, which also serves as the city's 
Community Development Commission, decided to pursue a hotel project proposed by 
Oceanside Hotel Partners -- a joint venture between Russell Grosse Development 
of Carlsbad and Calmark Commercial Development of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The developers' initial plans call for the construction of a 300-room resort 
hotel, convention center and condominium project on six acres of vacant land 
near the municipal harbor. They were unsure of the total cost of the project, 
which city officials hope will bolster a fragile tourism industry. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, a similar effort collapsed when City Equities-Oceanside Ltd., a 
development firm, was unable to get financing and had to abandon its plans for 
a $25-million hotel complex. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Honky-Tonk Image 
</P>
<P>
The setback underlined Oceanside's continuing difficulty in shaking its image 
as a honky-tonk town catering to Marines from nearby Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel industry analysts have speculated that a recent boom in hotel building in 
Southern California has saturated the market. Also, they say, lenders are 
hesitant to finance trailblazing projects in cities with image problems such as 
Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
But Oceanside officials see signs of rejuvenation in the recent successful 
restoration of the city's municipal pier and booming construction of beachfront 
condominiums. Redevelopment officials have feverishly pursued a resort hotel as 
the missing piece needed to restore Oceanside to its glory days as a summer 
haven in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Trailblazing Project' 
</P>
<P>
Jim Betz, vice president and general counsel with the Carlsbad development 
firm, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the city's image problems are definitely in Oceanside's past," Betz 
said. "But it is still a trailblazing project, and that's why I think the 
ability to get financing has been the key issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that was the overriding reason the city chose us to proceed with the 
project, because we have a track record in getting financing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Russell Grosse Development has been involved in many commercial projects, 
including three shopping centers in Oceanside, Betz said. 
</P>
<P>
Calmark Commercial Development also has experience building in San Diego 
County. The Los Angeles-based firm was a major developer behind the University 
Town Centre Mall in La Jolla and is the managing general partner for the 
210-room Ritz-Carlton Hotel project under construction in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hoteliers Interested 
</P>
<P>
Although the developers are far from choosing an operator, Betz said several 
hoteliers have expressed interest in the Oceanside project. 
</P>
<P>
"We've talked with several operators and, in addition, Calmark already has 
existing relationships with some hotel operators," Betz said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Betz, Calmark has previously undertaken ventures with Hyatt and 
Ritz-Carlton hotels. Calmark also owns the Beverly Heritage hotel chain, which 
may also be considered for the project, Betz said.

EDWARD DAVIS; PROMINENT L.A. NEUROLOGIST, 61 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles neurologist Edward H. Davis, who treated dozens of entertainers and 
other prominent figures during nearly 30 years of practice, died of pneumonia 
at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Saturday, his family said. He was 61. 
</P>
<P>
After the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, Davis appeared in court to 
testify that Kennedy's assassin, Sirhan B. Sirhan, was competent to stand 
trial. He diagnosed Kitty Dukakis' spinal cord compression while she was 
campaigning in California last year for her husband, Democratic presidential 
nominee Michael S. Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stroke Research 
</P>
<P>
Davis, former chief of clinical neurology at Cedars-Sinai, also did research on 
the connection between stroke victims' ability to recover and how well they had 
coped with the normal difficulties of life before suffering their strokes. 
</P>
<P>
Davis was undergoing chemotherapy treatments for lymphoma, when he caught 
pneumonia, his family said. He had survived two bouts with cancer already. In 
1983 and 1985 he was treated for Hodgkin's disease. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slated for Honors 
</P>
<P>
He was scheduled to be honored by the American Academy of Neurology for 
lifetime service at its national meeting next month. He served as chairman of 
the organization's Committee on Practice. 
</P>
<P>
Davis is survived by his wife, Ruth; three sons, Anthony of Los Angeles; Adam 
of New York City and Alexander of Victorville; two stepsons, Alexander and Ted 
Alben, both of Los Angeles; a sister, Ruth Bartfeld, of Bethesda, Md., and an 
aunt, Ceil Hammerling of New York City. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service will be held at 11 a.m. Tuesday at Leo Baeck Temple, 1300 N. 
Sepulveda Blvd. Burial will be private, the family said.

A BETTER TRIBUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the San Diego Convention Center, that name is appropriate and should 
remain as such. 
</P>
<P>
As for Martin Luther King Jr., there are many other things that could be named 
after him. My favorite would be Presidents Way in Balboa Park. That would be a 
tribute equal to his accomplishment.

A PARENT'S VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the parent of a child attending the school that employed Sharon Rogers, I 
was shocked to read of Congressman Bill Lowery's seemingly cavalier attitude 
toward the safety of these children. 
</P>
<P>
The congressman forgets that the school and parents' top priority is the safety 
of our children. His remarks ring hollow that we should "hang tough" against 
terrorists (by keeping Sharon Rogers on campus). 
</P>
<P>
I tried to enlist his support and help from some of the San Diego City Council 
to provide any kind of protection for the school grounds -- which are quite 
open and accessible. All for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
I did notice, however, that the congressman's busy schedule found time, in this 
agonizingly difficult week for us parents, to get headlines for some new 
detection equipment -- hardly the response needed for the safety of hundreds of 
children attending a school that was not only a few blocks from where the van 
was bombed, but also the recipient of a bomb threat a few days following the 
van's burning up. 
</P>
<P>
But I want to be fair. I don't want to prejudge Congressman Lowery. Let's see 
him put his money where his headline mouth is on standing up to terrorists. 
What would you do, congressman, if the terrorism shifted to your child's 
school? The national press has printed the exact name of the school, where it 
is located, and the grade your child is in. Let us know how you are going to 
place your child's school on the front line against terrorism, Bill. 
</P>
<P>
My son and I were blessed with the wonderful luck to experience Mrs. Rogers' 
magic in the classroom for two years (third and fourth grade). She is one of 
life's wonderful teachers and is a victim as surely as the children are. 
</P>
<P>
All we parents wanted to do is move the arena in which you fight terrorism to a 
more fair battleground; one where weapons are equal; where expertise can match 
madness -- a school ground full of children is not that place.

SCHOOL DRESS CODES: A COLORFUL, SOBERING LESSON IN HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Greg Johnson is a Times business writer and the father of two. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The school dress code was simple when I was in grammar school during the early 
1960s: clean shirts and ties for boys, uniforms for girls. That was at St. 
Christopher Grade School in Rocky River, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
That code now seems quaint alongside the strict rules that Jackson Elementary 
School at 54th Street and El Cajon Boulevard instituted March 9. Jackson 
students are now prohibited from wearing colors and particular items of 
clothing that are favored by gangs. 
</P>
<P>
I never once breached the St. Christopher dress code, so I don't know what 
happened to offenders. But my kindergarten son, Tim, has a working 
understanding of what might happen should he breach Jackson's new dress code: 
Gangs of kids might beat you up if you wear the wrong color, he told me last 
week. When I parroted the advice that parents traditionally offer -- find an 
adult if a problem arises -- he nonchalantly advised me that gangs beat up 
adults and police, too. 
</P>
<P>
So, when Tim picks out his clothes in the morning, we now must remember which 
colors and combinations are on the forbidden list and dress him accordingly. My 
son -- a dark-horse candidate who won a "Good Citizen" award during February -- 
doesn't wear outfits that are exclusively red, blue or green. He doesn't wear 
baseball caps or bandannas, and he doesn't wear colored shoelaces in his tennis 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Tim was confused by the dress code. At first, he thought the 
principal wanted students to wear gang colors. My wife explained that the 
opposite was true. Tim then wondered if he'd ever be able to wear his favorite 
red shirt. We explained that only outfits that include red shirts, red pants 
and red shoes are forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
That settled him down a bit. But it remains very confusing for this particular 
kindergartner. 
</P>
<P>
The new dress code is designed to ensure "a safe environment for all students," 
according to a letter Tim carried home from Jackson Principal R. J. Cunningham. 
"Students wearing any of the (banned) clothing will be asked to remove the item 
or they may be taken home to change their clothing." 
</P>
<P>
The dress code was instituted because "we are seeing increasing evidence of our 
students identifying with certain gang behavior," Cunningham wrote. "Some of 
our students have been found wearing clothing which is associated with gang 
behavior." 
</P>
<P>
For parents, the dress code is a sad, but not surprising, byproduct of San 
Diego's growing gang problem. 
</P>
<P>
Last year in San Diego, 96 drive-by shootings killed eight people and left 54 
others injured. The Police Department, which estimates San Diego's gang 
population at about 2,000, recently formed an 86-member Special Enforcement 
Division to identify and arrest gang members. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, gang members are heavily involved in the city's booming 
drug business. Many carry handguns, and some have automatic machine guns 
capable of firing 400 rounds a minute. 
</P>
<P>
That is a far cry from the neighborhood tough guys I worried about during grade 
school. Danny Coyne was the toughest guy at Impett Park, a playground on 
Cleveland's West Side. He once cornered my brother and me in a neighbor's 
garage, where we hid for several hours. But, when supper approached, my brother 
bravely confronted Danny to win our freedom. 
</P>
<P>
On occasion, my friends and I fought to keep outsiders from "our" park. But the 
only weapons were fists and rocks, and the only injuries were an occasional 
bruise and some hurt feelings. 
</P>
<P>
In large part, growing up in Cleveland was remarkably similar to "The Wonder 
Years," a television show that chronicles the coming of age of a grade-school 
boy growing up in a suburban setting during the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
There are more than just miles and time between St. Christopher Grade School, 
circa 1961, and Andrew Jackson Elementary School in 1989. And for that reason, 
I'm not very well equipped to offer gang-related advice to my kindergarten son. 
</P>
<P>
I grew up in all-white sections of Cleveland. In contrast, the principal's 
notes that Tim carries home are written in Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian, 
Spanish and English. 
</P>
<P>
Tim's schoolmates are card-carrying members of Jesse Jackson's Rainbow 
Coalition. And it is with them that Tim is forging his own decade of "Wonder 
Years." But I wonder, if these children are worrying about gangs at age 6, what 
kind of memories they will have to relish in their later years.

A FLOW OF IRONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ah, yes, the irony was flowing strong like sap in the spring through Mike 
Madigan's March 12 commentary ("Local Control Key Issue in Controversy Over 
SDG&amp;E Merger"). Here we have a senior executive from the Los Angeles-based 
Pardee corporation waxing eloquent on the importance of "local control." Yes, 
that is the same Mike Madigan -- local boy bought by outside interests -- who 
was principal spokesman against growth controls during last November's election 
(shades of Howard Allen). 
</P>
<P>
And yes, that is the same Pardee that spent the single largest sum -- close to 
half-a-million dollars -- to defeat not only the citizens' growth-control 
initiatives but the City Council and Board of Supervisors plans as well. 
</P>
<P>
And, in the final irony, Mr. Madigan takes a knock at Edison's full-page 
propaganda ads extolling the virtues of the merger. Mr. Madigan chooses to 
forget, of course, those huge blue-and-yellow billboards screaming "NO ON D AND 
J" above our freeways that Pardee (and Fieldstone) paid for.

STEADY RAIN TO GIVE WAY TO LIGHT SHOWERS TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several areas of San Diego County were drenched Saturday -- Palomar Mountain 
received nearly 3 inches of rainfall -- but forecasters said the steady rain 
would be replaced by light showers today. 
</P>
<P>
Today's precipitation -- the last remnants of Saturday's storm front -- may 
ruin weekend plans, but forecasters say the rain is greatly needed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're way below normal for this time of the year," said Wally Cegiel, a 
forecaster with the National Weather Service. "We're getting much-needed rain." 
</P>
<P>
At this stage of the rain season, which runs from July 1 to June 30, San Diego 
County typically has received 7.96 inches of rain. But so far, only 5.31 inches 
of rain has fallen. 
</P>
<P>
For Monday, warmer, sunnier weather is expected to return. 
</P>
<P>
Today's morning showers are expected to yield a mere .25 inch of rain, but it 
would add to Saturday's substantial rainfall, Cegiel said. 
</P>
<P>
Most areas of the county received at least nearly .50 inch of rain: San Diego 
had .48, Oceanside .60, El Cajon .63 and Escondido .80. Julian received 1.2 
inches of rain, and Palomar was thoroughly doused with 2.75 inches. 
</P>
<P>
After the morning showers, temperatures today are expected to reach 62 to 67 
degrees along the coast and inland. Overnight temperatures should drop into the 
mid-50s coastal and high 40s inland. GENE YASUDA

COUNTY SETS ASIDE $61 MILLION TO ADD 405 FREEWAY LANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The good news for commuters stuck on the South Bay segment of the San Diego 
Freeway is that construction of an additional lane for buses and car pools 
moved a step closer to reality this week as the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission announced it had earmarked $61 million for the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
The bad news is that the project still has bureaucratic hurdles to overcome and 
the lane will not be built for several years. 
</P>
<P>
And even then, Caltrans, which supports the project, predicts that the main 
effect the lane will have is to increase the number of cars, trucks and buses 
using the road, rather than causing any long-lasting rise in freeway speeds. 
Cars on the congested freeway now travel below 30 m.p.h. several hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
"Initially, it is going to certainly help. It is going to go into free flow," 
said Dave Roper, Caltrans deputy district director of traffic operations for 
Los Angeles and Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"But that is going to last a very short time -- I estimate a few weeks. People 
are going to flood into it and it is going to break down again. There will be 
more 'throughput,' but I would not expect over a long period of time that it 
will significantly reduce congestion. That is not the nature of traffic." 
</P>
<P>
The project, which has been planned for years, would add a freeway lane in each 
direction from the Marina Freeway in the north to the Orange County line in the 
south. The new lane will be reserved for buses and car pools. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gas Tax Money 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, a $56-million project is under way to add a bus and car-pool 
lane on the San Diego Freeway from the Orange-Los Angeles county line to the 
junction of the San Diego and Santa Ana freeways near El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
The $61 million, which comes from state gas tax revenues, amounts to more than 
half of the project's cost, estimated at $108 million. About a year ago, the 
transportation commission decided that the bus and car-pool lane was the most 
effective way to aid traffic along the San Diego Freeway, and it set aside $12 
million for the project. The remaining funds will probably be raised from gas 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The project will add some lane segments by restriping the freeway, and in other 
areas, a new lane will be constructed in the freeway median. 
</P>
<P>
The first part of the project to be completed is expected to be the South Bay 
segment -- from the Marina Freeway to the Harbor Freeway, a stretch that 
includes the South Bay curve, where congestion frequently occurs. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Caltrans' prediction that the San Diego Freeway would remain heavily 
congested after the additional lane opens, transportation commission 
spokeswoman Diane Perrine said that the county transportation agency expects 
the lane to allow people to get home and to work faster, "especially if they 
ride in the car-pool lane. It should also help people going to the airport." 
</P>
<P>
The decision to back the car-pool and bus lane was supported by the El Segundo 
Employers Assn., which includes aerospace companies who are trying to comply 
with regional air quality regulations that require them to provide incentives 
for car pools. 
</P>
<P>
Construction on the segment between the Harbor and Marina freeways is expected 
to begin by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
During construction, the commission hopes a computerized traffic light system 
will be working so that traffic may be diverted to surface streets where timed 
lights will permit faster flow. 
</P>
<P>
The car-pool funds are included in the Regional Transportation Improvement 
Plan, which sets priorities for construction projects intended to reduce 
congestion or to widen freeways. 
</P>
<P>
After approval by the commission, the regional plan will go to the Southern 
California Association of Governments on April 6. The California Transportation 
Commission is to consider final approval of the regional plan on June 29.

SLAIN GRANT TEACHER WAS FAN OF MYSTERIES AND VICTIM OF ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hal Arthur, the Grant High School teacher who was ambushed and shot to death as 
he was leaving his Sherman Oaks home for school early Friday, was fascinated by 
books about crime and mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
His own slaying -- a seemingly precise, well-planned assassination -- has 
presented police with the sort of mystery that might have been spun by his 
favorite crime writers: Why would a popular high school teacher become a target 
for murder? 
</P>
<P>
Police said Saturday that they have no leads in the case. A 16-year-old Van 
Nuys youth who had been transferred from Grant to North Hollywood High because 
of disciplinary problems after a campus fight had been questioned Friday but 
then ruled out as a suspect, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Friends and relatives say that Arthur, who owned the complete works of such 
crime writers as Joseph Wambaugh, had no known enemies. Ernie Blumenberg, a 
fellow teacher, said he could not imagine Arthur "involved in anything . . . 
that would get him killed." 
</P>
<P>
". . . From what I know of him, he was just a guy who was trying to put in his 
time and retire," said Frederick (Bud) Parker, another teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Saturday that they have no evidence to suggest that any of the 
3,100 students at Grant were involved. Detective Mel Arnold said the youth 
questioned Friday had a "solid" alibi. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Waiting for Phone to Ring' 
</P>
<P>
"We're just interviewing school personnel and people who knew him, and waiting 
for the phone to ring," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold said three detectives have been assigned to the case full time. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur was attacked about 6 a.m. Friday moments after he opened the door of his 
car parked in front of his home in the 13900 block of Milbank Street. He was 
about to enter the car when an assailant with a .22-caliber semiautomatic 
weapon fired on him from across the street. 
</P>
<P>
At least six shots were fired before the gunman sped away in a dark-colored 
sedan, police said. At least three bullets struck Arthur in the back. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the slaying, teachers and administrators have begun bracing for 
a tough day Monday when students return to Grant High from their Easter holiday 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when you'll see some real emotion because two-thirds of the kids were 
out last week for Good Friday," Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
Some students already have said it will be emotionally difficult for them to 
return to the classroom where Arthur taught history and advised seniors, said 
Arthur Benveniste, a social studies teacher at Grant for 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
A team of 12 district psychologists will remain at the school throughout the 
week to counsel students and teachers, said Shel Erlich of the Los Angeles 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Grant High administrators will meet Monday with student government 
representatives to determine when a memorial service will be held at the 
school, Erlich said. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur left his body to science. There will be a memorial service at 3:30 p.m. 
Tuesday at Temple Beth Hillel in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the lack of evidence implicating a student in Arthur's murder, the 
shooting has alarmed teachers, who have been concerned about their safety in 
the wake of recent attacks on teachers, including the stabbing of a teacher at 
Olive Vista Junior High School in Sylmar by a student earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Everyone Feels Vulnerable' 
</P>
<P>
"When something like this happens, everyone feels vulnerable, " said 
Blumenberg, an art teacher at Grant for 25 years. "If it can happen to Hal, who 
was a superb teacher that everyone loved, it can happen to anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Blumenberg, a longtime friend of Arthur's, said he is not worried about student 
violence but was bewildered by the slaying. "A cop at the scene told me that 
with no witnesses, they're going to have to get real lucky on this one," he 
said.

"The canyon walls become steep and rugged, the stream narrows, and you feel 
that the waterfalls are close. Several small falls come first, and you are 
challenged in climbing up some rock; then around to the right of a turn in the 
canyon is a beautiful, 12-foot waterfall.' 
</P>
<P>
Milt McAuley, Hiking Trails of the Santa Monica Mountains, 1980 
</P>
<P>
"You should see the waterfall. It is full of graffiti. . . . Even if they found 
some way to get rid of the graffiti, within six months it would be back up. . . 
. I have pictures when there was none at all, but I didn't have the heart to 
take the after-pictures today.' 
</P>
<P>
James Kenney, naturalist photographer, March, 1989 
</P>
<P>
The men quoted above were describing the same waterfall in the Santa Monica 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ynez Waterfalls, once a cool reward at the end of a two-mile hike 
through Santa Ynez Canyon, are a striking example of the way in which rocks, 
trees and paths in wilderness areas around Los Angeles have increasingly been 
defaced by graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
Stylized words and symbols are a common sight on trails from the Santa Susana 
Mountains to Griffith Park and all through the Santa Monica Mountains from 
Universal City to Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
"Any place people find where it's easy out, easy in, if there's something to be 
graffitied they'll graffiti it," said Jill Swift, a Sierra Club hiking leader. 
"Anything you can't put graffiti-proof paint on -- and who wants to do that to 
rocks? -- will be graffitied." 
</P>
<P>
Graffiti appear in some areas seasonally -- such as Malibu Creek State Park, 
where rangers brace themselves for fresh graffiti every spring. In other parks, 
graffiti appear sporadically year-round. 
</P>
<P>
Urban dwellers who head for the hills on the weekends seeking fresher air, open 
spaces and serenity are bombarded with constant reminders of the city they are 
trying to escape. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important reason for natural areas is the inspiration they provide," 
Swift said. "When we go out and they're messed up, it's like we've been raped. 
It makes us come out filled with anger." 
</P>
<P>
On the trails, the graffiti, rather than the beauty of the wilderness, tend to 
dominate conversations. As she hiked through Santa Ynez Canyon one weekend, 
Jean Dillingham, education director for the Topanga-Las Virgenes Resource 
Conservation District, said: "We've been grumbling about it all the way out. I 
never want to come back here again." 
</P>
<P>
Only one hiker interviewed along area trails said he had managed to overlook 
the graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Blueskies, a Hancock Park music producer, speed walks on trails above the 
Griffith Park Observatory nearly every day with hand weights and his dog, 
Poodle. He passes graffiti-splattered bridges, boulders, benches and a water 
tower. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very nearsighted and I just take my glasses off," Blueskies said. "I don't 
usually notice any of it. Everything just becomes a soft pastel watercolor 
wash." 
</P>
<P>
When the wilderness graffiti are allowed to remain, they multiply, or, as Jay 
Beswick, graffiti consultant for Community Youth Gang Services, explained: 
"Graffiti breeds graffiti, there's no question about that," challenging the 
next graffiti painter to add to it. 
</P>
<P>
Graffiti have spread deeper into the parks as rocks and trees closer to parking 
areas and roads have become covered with paint. Parks officials said anti-gang 
sweeps by police have also pushed gang hangouts, which are heavily marked by 
graffiti, farther into the forests. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really one of the signs of our times -- kind of like a challenge to find 
someplace that's never been graffitied and put their identity there," said 
Jackie Tatum, assistant city parks manager for the San Fernando Valley region. 
</P>
<P>
Yet state and city parks officials say little can be done about the 
back-country graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things we're trying to do is keep an eye on the place by keeping 
frequent patrols down there, but it's hard to catch anyone," said state park 
Ranger John Schmill. "We've looked at various types of eradication, but that's 
not too successful either -- paint gets into the pores of the rock." 
</P>
<P>
When graffiti artists choose sandstone, natural erosion accelerated by acid 
rain washes away some of the paint after several years, unless the rocks are 
painted again. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, sand-blasting equipment used on urban graffiti is too heavy and 
cumbersome to cart out on trails. "Graffiti doctor" crews paint over graffiti 
in city parks within 48 hours of a complaint, but parks officials said that 
they rarely hear about the wilderness graffiti and that it is impractical to 
paint large rocks. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy tried a graffiti-resistant coating on 
rocks at a Mulholland Drive overlook, but "it makes them look like they're wet 
all the time," Chief Ranger Gary Moser said. "It makes them look terrible." 
</P>
<P>
Solvents sometimes work, but they may not be ecologically sound because they 
destroy lichens essential to the ecosystem, Schmill said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quick Response 
</P>
<P>
Tom McKindley, manager of the relatively graffiti-free Presbyterian Conference 
Center in Temescal Canyon in Pacific Palisades, said hikers help his staff 
identify graffiti hot spots on the center's trails before they spread and help 
clean those areas. The volunteers use solvents, peel bark from graffiti-marred 
eucalyptus trees -- which naturally shed bark anyway -- and artfully repaint 
other trees and rocks so they look like trees and rocks again. 
</P>
<P>
McKindley became so upset about the situation in neighboring Santa Ynez Canyon 
that he persuaded his staff to paint a graffiti-covered culvert and drainage 
apron with beige paint. Within six months, the culvert and apron graffiti were 
worse than ever. 
</P>
<P>
Then McKindley tried to talk a muralist into systematically painting over sheer 
rock faces, caves and the Santa Ynez Waterfalls. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him to paint that same rock back on that face again," McKindley said. 
"But he said, 'There's going to be greater joy for the person who graffitis 
over my work than I would have painting it.' I said, 'Well, you're probably 
right.' " 
</P>
<P>
The tenor of wilderness graffiti varies from rock to rock, tree to tree and 
park to park. Much are created in the blue and red colors of opposing Los 
Angeles gangs, but silver and black also are popular hues. Some phrases hint at 
violence and drugs, others at love. 
</P>
<P>
"I would divide it into thirds," Beswick said. "A third is the 'John loves 
Susan,' a third of it is getting into the tagging stuff -- they look at 
themselves as artistic and they are not usually gang members -- a third would 
be the cultural writers, the gangs." 
</P>
<P>
Based on the few graffiti painters caught in the act, modern wilderness 
defacers range from inner-city youths on a back-country excursion to the 
children of the wealthy homeowners who live nearby. Len Milner, who lives on 
Palisades Drive, said many of the Santa Ynez perpetrators are neighborhood 
youngsters playing hooky. 
</P>
<P>
If they are actually caught with paint in hand, they face fines of up to $500 
and 200 hours of community work. But only a handful of the arrests have reached 
that stage, and none was from the back-country areas, parks officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence of partying usually accompanies a heavily painted spot. Above 
Chatsworth Park South, on the edge of the Santa Susana Mountains, bottles 
littered at the base of sandstone outcroppings hint at the young ages of those 
responsible for the fresh graffiti: Boone's Strawberry Hill wine and Mickey's 
malt liquor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ignoring Consequences 
</P>
<P>
"Our assumption is these kids who are doing this know they're being 
destructive," Kenney said. "But I think they just don't take this pristine 
environment as seriously as we do. I don't think they get together and say, 
'Let's go up and ruin the wilderness.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hikers and parks authorities say graffiti were the latest in a series of urban 
ills to seep into the wilderness. First came trash, then fires, then graffiti, 
they say. 
</P>
<P>
Some remember seeing occasional painted words up to a decade ago, but said they 
proliferated dramatically during the past four or five years. Graffiti artists 
provide evidence by dating much of their work. A date before 1980 is unusual. 
Many graffiti are so fresh the paint still shines. 
</P>
<P>
For hikers, there are early signs that a trail will be graffiti-plagued, such 
as paint-caked trail signs or giant letters spray-painted on asphalt parking 
lots. 
</P>
<P>
On the Betty B. Deering Trail connecting Mulholland Drive with the ocean, the 
first sign of something amiss comes at the initial mileage marker, which is 
obliterated by three layers of graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Remoteness a Factor 
</P>
<P>
As is the case with most trails, the farther out, the less frequent the paint. 
But every time civilization dips close to the trail, it reappears. 
</P>
<P>
Why some areas get hit and others don't remains a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
Newer trails remain clean. La Tuna Canyon trail near Sunland-Tujunga opened two 
months ago but won't be officially dedicated until July. There, a wide band of 
graffiti on a drainage culvert at the trail entrance appears to predict future 
problems, but to date even the wooden trail barriers are graffiti-free. 
</P>
<P>
Trails that lead out of guarded parking areas, such as the Presbyterian 
Conference Center and O'Melveny Park in Granada Hills, also tend to fare 
better. 
</P>
<P>
But even the city parks manager in charge of the Valley cannot guess why the 
flat rocks of the Santa Susanas are heavily painted above Chatsworth Park South 
yet are virtually untouched at nearby Chatsworth Oaks Park. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," Tatum said. "Maybe it's because south Chatsworth is very 
secluded." 
</P>
<P>
McAuley said he may have to revise his book's descriptions to warn hikers about 
the graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the people that need to read that -- the people doing the 
graffiti -- won't be reading my books," he said.

SUSPECTED DRUG DEALER KILLED IN CANOGA PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A suspected drug peddler was shot to death Saturday following an apparent 
dispute with a customer behind a Canoga Park apartment house, Los Angeles 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old victim, whose name was withheld until relatives can be 
notified, was identified as a transient from Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the man was shot several times in the 5:30 a.m. attack and 
was pronounced dead at the scene at the rear of apartments in the 21800 block 
of Lanark Street. 
</P>
<P>
The site is across from Lanark Park, which police have labeled "the worst area 
for open-air drug dealing" in the western San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said the victim slept in an apartment carport storage area and sold 
rock cocaine in an adjoining alley, Police Lt. Bill Gaida said. The dead man 
had been arrested in the past on suspicion of drug possession, Gaida said.

SIMI MAN HELD IN ATTACK ON JOHN WAYNE'S DAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE EMMONS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Newport Beach police said Saturday they have arrested a Simi Valley man in the 
attack in October on Aissa Wayne, daughter of actor John Wayne, and her 
companion, financier Roger Luby. 
</P>
<P>
Police identified the suspect as Jeffrey Kendall Bouey, 35, a swimming pool 
cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher J. Evans, the deputy district attorney assigned to the case, said 
Wayne and Luby have identified Bouey as one of two men who bound, beat and 
threatened to kill them after they drove onto Luby's $3-million Newport Beach 
estate on Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Evans has described the attack as a "contract assault" that was "cold, 
deliberate, premeditated." 
</P>
<P>
Bouey, arrested Friday night outside his home in Simi Valley, was being held in 
Newport Beach City Jail. Harbor Municipal Court Judge Russell A. Bostrom set 
Bouey's bail at $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Police described Bouey as a friend of Jerrel L. Hintergardt, 37, of Burbank, 
whom they arrested March 17 on suspicion of being one of the attackers. He is 
in Orange County Jail in lieu of $1-million bail. Both Hintergardt and Bouey 
are being held on suspicion of conspiracy and assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, Hintergardt is a former employee of private investigator 
O. Daniel Gal of Los Angeles, for whom an arrest warrant was issued two weeks 
ago as part of the Wayne-Luby investigation. Gal's agency had been hired by 
Aissa Wayne's former husband, Thomas A. Gionis of Pomona, an orthopedic 
surgeon, as part of a bitter fight over custody of the couple's 2-year-old 
daughter Anastasia. Gionis won custody in January. 
</P>
<P>
Police allege that Gionis paid Gal $40,000 during a two-week period a month 
before the attack on Wayne and Luby. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Gal is in Europe, where he went after being interviewed by 
investigators. Gionis could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred in daylight after Wayne, 32, and Luby, 52, had driven 
through the electrically controlled gate to Luby's home. 
</P>
<P>
Two men appearing to be construction workers walked through the open gate to 
the nearby garage and called out Luby's name. When Luby acknowledged his name, 
one man struck him in the head with a pistol, knocking him to the garage floor. 
The other man pushed Wayne to the garage floor and banged her head against the 
pavement. 
</P>
<P>
The attackers bound both victims, and one slashed the Achilles tendon in Luby's 
right leg and tried to slash the other as well. 
</P>
<P>
One of the men told Wayne that he was messing "with the wrong people. If you 
screw up again, you're dead." Then they left. 
</P>
<P>
Police say several witnesses saw the men at the scene of the attack and saw Gal 
parked nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Tim Newman said investigators learned the identity of the second suspect 
Friday afternoon and asked Simi Valley police to watch Bouey's home. At 6:55 
p.m. Friday, officers arrested Bouey as he started to drive off. He did not 
resist arrest, officers said.

THE VERDICT AGAINST SHERIFF BRAD GATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times' article (March 16) spoke of the jury verdict against Orange County 
Sheriff Brad Gates in the Guillory case. The jury felt that Gates had abused 
his powers. An accompanying article spoke of the views of some Orange County 
Republican politicians regarding that verdict. 
</P>
<P>
In that accompanying article, state Sen. Marian Bergeson stated that Gates was 
" . . . not going to be hurt in the long run. . . . I think he's pretty well 
entrenched." Mission Viejo City Councilman (Robert A.) Curtis doubts that Gates 
need worry much about the verdict and County Supervisor (Thomas F.) Riley spoke 
only of the money involved. 
</P>
<P>
As a longtime registered Republican, I ask those politicians when they are 
going to address themselves to their responsibilities as leading residents (not 
Republicans) of Orange County to see that the people get a sheriff-coroner who 
doesn't abuse his powers? These aren't slip-and-fall lawsuits out of some 
supermarket! How many abuse-of-power lawsuits does it take? Without their (and 
other civic leaders') support or neutrality, Gates wouldn't make it in any 
election. 
</P>
<P>
The mind-set of "my party right or wrong" has no place in civic leadership. The 
county paid off $357,000 in the first suit (the Wright case) because it didn't 
want the facts of that suit to be revealed in the newspapers and it feared a 
far greater judgment. The Guillory suit with attorney fees will probably equal 
that. What makes politicians so blase about a sheriff-coroner who abuses his 
powers and then gets the taxpayers to bail him out? Twice! And one to go! 
</P>
<P>
I strongly suggest that they inquire about the evidence of the case pending 
against Gates and that they then stand up to be counted.

SCHOOL TRANSIT PLAN FOR 1989-90 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing this letter to convey my concern over the Saddleback Valley 
Unified School District's proposal: Free "Home-to-School Transportation Plan 
for School Year 1989-90 in Response to State Department of Education's 
Directive to Discontinue the Charging of Fees for Home-to-School Transportation 
Services." 
</P>
<P>
More investigation and thought needs to go into the busing plan for next year 
inasmuch as the proposal before the board necessitates our children walking too 
far to "local" schools in areas that are unsafe and under road conditions that 
are pitiful at best. 
</P>
<P>
This proposal puts undue hardship on many parents in the area, especially 
single parents like myself, who must be at work prior to or at the time the 
children are to start school. 
</P>
<P>
I feel it is unrealistic to expect a 7-year-old child to walk 1 1/2 to 2 miles 
to school to be there for a 7:45 a.m. starting time as is currently proposed. 
Many of the children will have to walk down El Toro Road during early-morning 
rush hour, often when it will be dark, and there are no sidewalks in much of 
the area where they will have to walk. El Toro Road is far too busy and the 
speed limit much too high to put children of any age upon it at any time of the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
I urge the board to allow a committee of concerned parents to be set up to 
investigate this matter and give the board options that they might use to 
alleviate the busing problem that the board feels will exist next year. Other 
school districts in our area seem to have been able to solve the busing 
situation without requiring their children to walk long distances under unsafe 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
I cannot see where there is any reason to act with undue haste on the decision 
for next year's busing without first giving appropriate consideration to the 
concerns of the parents and the community.

THANKS FOR THE CONSERVATION OF A SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO HILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In this, the day of greed, grade and growth, I have had the good fortune to 
meet, albeit only by phone, a true conservationist. For the past 3 weeks, I 
have been inquiring as to what is happening to a lovely hill near my home in 
San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
The city Planning Department told me the owner is simply building an access 
road to his reservoir, digging up an old well and installing irrigation to 
enable him to plant the land to agriculture. (It's zoned agriculture.) 
</P>
<P>
I must admit I thought this story a bit farfetched, since he is obviously 
spending upwards of tens of thousands of dollars grading, not plowing, making 
steep slopes and flat areas, not gentle slopes and terraces; in essence, 
completely rearranging the whole hill, as though for building. 
</P>
<P>
My doubting mind and I took my question to the City Council meeting. "What is 
happening on the Mauer property?" I reported what the Planning Department had 
said, and the City Council told me that everything I was told was exactly true, 
and that the council is watching this project "very closely." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, I had called Mauer Development, and the following day Mr. 
Mauer himself returned my call and reaffirmed what city staff and City Council 
had told me. 
</P>
<P>
He is grading, cutting, rearranging that whole hill merely to build an access 
road to his reservoir, to dig up an old well, to put in a water line, to 
irrigate to try to save the existing eucalyptus from the Australian beetle 
blight, and to plant to agriculture! 
</P>
<P>
Here is a rare man and he should be applauded. His values have not been 
compromised by monetary success. Here is a man so grateful for his past 
successes in San Juan (he has developed and sold several housing tracts here), 
that he is spending a small fortune to preserve this one small area to 
agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
And so, good neighbors, all of you who have been concerned with me, as we awake 
each morning to the rumble of earthmovers and the tell-tale ding, ding, ding of 
the water truck, we can rest assured that soon we will see strawberries, 
peppers, or perhaps tomatoes, growing on that hill, and it will be lovely 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Forgive me for doubting. And let's hear it for Bob Mauer, an unsung hero in our 
midst.

STUDENT MURALS ON THE WALL OF A UCI CONSTRUCTION SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
T.A. Heppenheimer's letter of March 11 criticized the temporary construction 
site wall mural at UC Irvine as "having nothing to do with what a 
university-level art course, particularly at the junior or senior level, should 
be pursuing." 
</P>
<P>
My question is, what is worthy of an intermediate painting class pursuit? Is 
transferring sketches to scale, color theory, paint application techniques, 
collaboration for the expression of personal histories out of the territory 
that would be deemed appropriate artistic pursuit? Twenty years of experience 
as an art educator has brought me to the conclusion that these issues are 
perhaps among the most important for students. This is particularly important 
at a time when isolation and alienation for an increasingly ethnically diverse 
student population threatens their success rates. 
</P>
<P>
Or is it the mural form itself that is "unworthy" because of its association in 
the 20th Century with social movements or ethnicity? Clearly history has 
sustained murals as a worthy artistic pursuit from the caves of Lauscaux to the 
Mayan pyramids to the Italian Renaissance to the Mexican muralists of the 1920s 
to the U.S. Works Progress Administration public murals of the '30s, and 
finally to the more recent explosion of the '70s and '80s across our country. 
By the way, the "unschooled street artists of East L.A." who produced many 
murals during the latter period were mostly schooled in our universities and 
struggled to find voices that spoke to their own cultural experiences and 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
It is the university's job to pursue an "academic environment," which I take to 
mean a safe place for experimentation and research, in short, "learning." 
Which, if any, creative person is able to step forward into the world fully 
articulate? 
</P>
<P>
Sketches are only diagrams for another completed product and as such they are 
in themselves not completed artworks to be critiqued. That is not to say that 
my expectations of my students are not high. I expect them to produce "class 
work" that takes risks, possibly even makes the passionate mistakes necessary 
to learn self-expression. As a faculty member I promise, in return, support for 
these efforts and encouragement to grow. 
</P>
<P>
Last, as to the matter of "taste" in this time of a multiplicity of tastes in 
which acceptance of diversity should be our goal, which "taste" are we to 
teach? 
</P>
<P>
It is not my students who are guilty of a poverty of imagination or of being 
oracles of the obvious.

HOSPITALS AND PROBLEMS OF CARING FOR INDIGENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial "Government Must Pay for Care of Indigent" (March 19) is very 
timely. State and county governments point fingers at one another in blame and 
nothing gets done. Then they blame physicians and hospitals and again, nothing 
is done. 
</P>
<P>
We are all to blame in our own way. But the problem of financing gets worse, 
especially as it relates to care for the indigent and uncompensated care. Just 
ask county officials whether they would want to see a county hospital operated 
by the county. Why should they? Physicians and hospitals are absorbing the 
costs. And they face severe financial problems as a result. 
</P>
<P>
UCI Medical Center is the very large tip of the iceberg in Orange County. As 
its percentage of uncompensated-for and Medi-Cal patients increases, it loses 
more money. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals and physicians are responsible parties, but we cannot continue to 
carry this increasing burden while the County of Orange and state of California 
ignore their own obligations. 
</P>
<P>
I agree with The Times that we are all ultimately at risk, and I hope that 
members of the public will contact their elected representatives .

BRADLEY SKIPS DEBATE, FRUSTRATES ELECTION FOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One mayoral candidate proposed a four-day week for city workers and another 
pledged to veto proposals that increase crowding in residential neighborhoods 
as underdog challengers debated Saturday, without Los Angeles Mayor Tom 
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
The four-day week was advocated by Leonard Miropol, a former therapist who is 
running as "The Conscience of Los Angeles." The veto pledge came from former 
Los Angeles County Supervisor Baxter Ward, who said he would block any city 
legislation that has the effect of increasing density. 
</P>
<P>
But the candidate who spoke strongest of the issue most troubling to the 
challengers was Los Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden, who attacked the mayor 
for avoiding debates. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should we be ignored by the mayor?" Holden asked during the debate in Van 
Nuys. "Why should he be permitted to ignore us? TV cameras should be here 
photographing that empty chair. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The three candidates spoke to an audience of about 35 at a forum was sponsored 
by a group of San Fernando Valley homeowner and community organizations.

SHOWERS COULD OFFER TEST OF FAITH FOR THOSE AT EASTER SUNRISE SERVICES

The faithful may be tested today -- if only a little -- as cloudy skies held 
the chance of light showers for traditional Easter Sunday Sunrise Services in 
the Los Angeles region. 
</P>
<P>
"Early risers may get rained on," warned Rick Dittmann, a forecaster for 
WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts to The Times. Intermittent, 
scattered showers were forecast for the morning, "sputtering out" about noon, 
Dittmann said. 
</P>
<P>
Rain will be much weaker than the storm that started late Friday night and 
dumped half an inch of rain downtown by mid-morning Saturday, Dittmann said. 
Today's high temperatures are expected to range from the high 50s to the low 
60s, with overnight lows in the upper 30s and lower 40s, before sunny weather 
returns Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Change in Rituals 
</P>
<P>
Easter service organizers from Hollywood Bowl to Skid Row anticipated no change 
in their plans in rituals born of New Testament accounts of Jesus rising from 
the dead. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the 69th annual Hollywood Bowl service were anticipating as many 
as 15,000 worshipers for a 5:15 a.m. ecumenical program of sermons and song 
that was to be telecast locally and beamed by satellite to an audience 
throughout the world. The service this year was dedicated to Armenians affected 
by last December's devastating earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Even torrential rains would not stop the Hollywood Bowl service, said producer 
Ellen Foster on Saturday, because performers such as Cyd Charisse, Rhonda 
Fleming and Robert Guillame would be protected by the stage dome. 
</P>
<P>
More than 11,000 people were expected to attend sunrise services at the four 
Forest Lawn Memorial Parks -- in Covina Hills, Glendale, Hollywood Hills and 
Long Beach. Other outdoor early morning services were scheduled at Mt. Rubidoux 
in Riverside and at Wayfarers Chapel in Rancho Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Downtown Event 
</P>
<P>
Rain could also have dampened the annual Easter brunch at the Fred Jordan 
Mission on downtown Los Angeles' Skid Row. Organizers said the 5,000 people 
they had hoped to feed outdoors starting at 10 a.m. might have to be moved to 
the nearby Midnight Mission, with a line starting at noon. The Long Beach 
Rescue Mission was also planning to serve Easter meals starting at 10:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, nearly 4,000 men, women and children lined up in a drizzle 
for a holiday dinner at the Los Angeles Mission. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than sit down at tables in the rain, most sought shelter under nearby 
store awnings, eating from Styrofoam plates as they stood. 
</P>
<P>
"The rain definitely hinders what we do," said Mike Edwards, associate director 
of the mission.

<P>
PANEL MEMBERS CONTROL STYLES TO PRESERVE 1880S DESIGN OF NEIGHBORHOOD 
</P>

<P>
One hundred years ago, when the northwest boundary of Los Angeles was only a 
mile from downtown, the place to live and "get away from it all" was Angelino 
Heights, the city's first suburb. 
</P>
<P>
Gingerbread houses with gables, turrets and widows' walks sprang up, and 
despite their placement in a city that levels its past as a matter of routine, 
most of the graceful structures have managed to survive. 
</P>
<P>
Today Angelino Heights has the highest concentration of Victorian-era homes 
left in Los Angeles. Six years ago, this fact was recognized when the 
neighborhood became Los Angeles' first designated "historic preservation 
overlay zone," and it still is one of only three such zones in the city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demonstration of Power 
</P>
<P>
As such, Angelino Heights residents exercise unusual control over their 
neighborhood. A few homeowners demonstrated this power recently, sitting around 
a lace-covered mahogany dining table in a 102-year-old house. 
</P>
<P>
"It's boring, a mass of wood, that's all it is," Cecil Dover, one of five on 
the board of the Angelino Heights Preservation Assn. was telling a developer, 
Andy Lisowski, a West Los Angeles builder who knew nothing about the the 
Victorian, Craftsman or Mission Revival styles common to the Angelino Heights. 
</P>
<P>
Lisowski wanted to build on an empty lot on Edgeware Road, and his design was 
spread across the table. Under the preservation ordinance, passed in 1979 and 
similar to laws in Chicago, Seattle and Columbus, Ohio, those wanting to change 
or demolish existing structures, or construct new buildings, are obliged as a 
first step in the permit process to take their designs before a review 
committee of neighbors -- in this case, the association. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish you'd tell me what you want," the dark-haired builder said, scowling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Should Be Special' 
</P>
<P>
"We're not here to design your house for you," said Dover, a thickset man with 
long gray hair who spent 11 years restoring his house in the 1300 block of 
Carroll Avenue. That block is also listed on the National Register of Historic 
Places. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a special neighborhood and yours should be a special house," Dover 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not prepared to approve it this way," added Tom Morales, who had grown 
up in the Victorian house where they were meeting, and was chairman of the 
association. "Why don't you walk around the neighborhood?" 
</P>
<P>
Much of Angelino Heights today seems a tidy community of spacious lots and many 
trees. It is situated on two crescent-shaped hills just east of Echo Park. 
About a third of the homes have now been restored, out of 1,336 homes and 
apartment buildings. Most of the restoration has been done by young and 
middle-aged professionals, who have moved in during the last decade. In 
stretches, it resembles parts of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
While prosperous merchants, real estate and oil men were its first residents in 
the late 1880s, Angelino Heights had become another run-down inner city 
neighborhood by the 1960s. As such, it was, as one resident put it, "the lucky 
product of neglect." Forgotten by developers as urban sprawl pushed out to the 
valleys, the old houses lingered as if in a cocoon. 
</P>
<P>
"That allowed it to exist until preservation efforts could begin," said Karen 
Jaeger, who lived for nine years in an Angelino Heights Victorian. 
</P>
<P>
Angelino Heights is larger than the city's other historic zones, which are the 
compact South Carthay area southwest of the Miracle Mile and Hollywood's 
Melrose Hill, with only 45 residences. It also is the least homogeneous, with a 
mix of ethnic groups -- mostly white, Latino and Asian -- and a fairly large 
group of low-income tenants paying less than $600 a month. Despite preservation 
efforts, it still is not uncommon to see a run-down rental right next to an 
immaculately restored home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Source of Conflict 
</P>
<P>
The juxtaposition of preservationists and owners who, for either cultural or 
financial reasons, have no interest in preserving the architecture makes for 
conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
Morales, a short, bald man with a friendly, unpretentious manner, said he began 
restoring his parents' house in 1972. When it comes to preservation, he said, 
many of his neighbors "don't understand what we're talking about." 
</P>
<P>
Owners planning most changes within an historic zone must obtain a "certificate 
of appropriateness" from the city Planning Commission in addition to the 
standard permits. But the commission usually follows the recommendations of the 
preservation committee; committee members in all three zones said they cannot 
remember one instance when the commission went against one of their decisions. 
</P>
<P>
David Leslie, manager of the Planning Department's neighborhood planning 
division, said he does not know why Los Angeles has so few designated historic 
zones. Efforts to become historic zones are underway in Hollywood's Whitley 
Heights; a residential neighborhood north of the Miracle Mile, and in two 
sections of Highland Park. Heather Hoggan, a leader in the Highland Park 
effort, said the process is slow, because "we all work, so we do things when we 
can," and the city provides "no real place to go and get all the information 
you need." 
</P>
<P>
While board members in South Carthay and Melrose Hill said almost all the plans 
that come to them for review are restorations, Morales estimates that more than 
half of the 60 projects his board has considered involve new construction, 
additions and even demolitions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Educational Effort 
</P>
<P>
"We have to educate people, disseminate information and communicate," he said, 
adding that he supports a proposal to amend the ordinance to, in part, make the 
preservation board a city agency, "with a minimal budget" to pay for the 
education effort. 
</P>
<P>
"We are volunteers," he said. "We need a support group." 
</P>
<P>
Morales maintained that his committee is "not that strict, like Williamsburg 
(Va.). This is Los Angeles." The group, for example, did not take issue when 
one owner painted his house pink, or when another planted a menagerie of 
ceramic animal figurines across the front of his home. 
</P>
<P>
While the committee apparently makes exceptions for what Morales calls "bad 
taste," it draws the line at major changes, such as covering the exteriors with 
stucco. Or installing aluminum windows. Or demolishing of vintage houses. 
</P>
<P>
The power of the preservation board has yet to face a court test. The 
longest-running case of non-compliance involves a run-down apartment building 
where the owner began in 1984 to spread stucco over the exterior and installed 
aluminum windows. 
</P>
<P>
The Building and Safety Department mistakenly granted the owner a permit before 
the project was submitted for neighborhood review. Morales said the board later 
voted against the chances, because both stucco and aluminum windows were out of 
context with turn-of-the-century architecture. 
</P>
<P>
But since late 1984 -- despite the review committee position and the issuance 
of a compliance order by the Building and Safety Department -- the owner has 
neither removed the stucco nor replaced the windows. 
</P>
<P>
The case is sitting in Building and Safety's investigations bureau, where 
inspector Tim O'Connor said he is "waiting for the owner to comply," which 
would mean either returning the building to its original state or appealing to 
the Planning Commission. O'Connor said he could "not say" why the department 
has waited five years without turning the case over to the city attorney's 
office for prosecution, or how long he would continue to wait. 
</P>
<P>
On a week night in mid-March, the preservation board met to hear what was only 
its second demolition request in five years. Landlord Stanley Zurn sought board 
approval to demolish a dilapidated three-unit Craftsman apartment building on 
Edgeware Road. The tenants, he said, were all low-income and one apartment had 
12 people living in it. 
</P>
<P>
Zurn, a tall man with gray hair askew and blackened hands, seemed to enjoy his 
status as the neighborhood holdout against gentrification. Privately, some of 
the newer residents call him a "slumlord," a description he is aware of but 
won't comment on. 
</P>
<P>
He takes a jaundiced view of the whole business of a historic zone, or HPOZ's 
as the insiders call them: "There's no provision in HPOZ's to preserve 
low-income tenants," he said. "If anything it's meant to bring in higher-income 
tenants, higher real estate values." 
</P>
<P>
Home values have quadrupled over the last decade, and many houses now sell for 
$250,000 and more. Zurn had been offered a chance to sell, he said, but only if 
the buyer could tear down the structure and rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
"We're afraid of development," Morales said. "Demolition opens the door for new 
development that's not sensitive." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slope of the Roof 
</P>
<P>
Tom Levine, a board member who had spent several years restoring a turreted, 
gabled house where 43 people had been living before he moved in, said he wants 
to see the Zurn building's Craftsman-style architecture preserved. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at the gables, the slope of the roof, those nice little windows, the 
details," he rhapsodized. "This house is still part of the spirit of the 
neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
"It can't stay the way it is," Morales said. "The status quo is to leave it 
alone, and admire its beauty until it collapses. And live with the consequences 
of the people problem." 
</P>
<P>
The term "people problem" is a common euphemism among the preservationists, and 
Morales said it refers to tenants who are blamed for "trash and graffiti." 
Police Officer Joe Robinson of the Rampart Division noted, however, that 
Angelino Heights has "the least amount of crime" in the inner-city sector 
patrolled by the division. 
</P>
<P>
After much discussion, the board members told Zurn they would not consider 
approving his demolition request until the landlord spent five months seeking a 
buyer interested in restoring it. 
</P>
<P>
Perplexed by the board's defense of a building even he, the owner, calls "an 
eyesore," Zurn later drove by his building for a second look. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, hell, you could just have the next owner build and put a few 
details on the front," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Role as an Enforcer 
</P>
<P>
Board members are not completely comfortable with their role as the 
neighborhood Big Brother. "When we became an HPOZ," Morales said. "I thought 
the city would be the responsible party. But the concept is the community is 
its own watchdog, its own enforcer, and we realized we had a lot of work to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the newer residents, however, say they moved to Angelino Heights 
because of its architecture and historic status. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Collins, a 35-year-old financial director, bought an empty lot and then 
moved his great grandfather's 101-year-old two-story house near Boyle Heights 
-- a distance of several miles. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd been interested in this neighborhood for 10 years," he said, adding he 
also had to go all the way to Santa Cruz before he found a bank that would lend 
him money for his effort. "Every conventional lender in town laughed at me." 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood is distinctive in more than just its architecture. Once they 
move there, new residents find the community is a common spot for film 
locations -- with "Aspen," "Terminal Man" and Michael Jackson's "Thriller" 
video a few examples. People walk a lot and tend to know the names of their 
neighbors, and even their neighbors' dogs. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Tate, a retired teacher who has lived more than 40 years in a 17-room 
Victorian, likes to say, "It reminds me of a small town in the Midwest," except 
that he has a clear view from his front porch of the downtown skyline. 
</P>
<P>
Tourists are a fact of life. One recent Sunday afternoon, as Alan Whitney sat 
on his porch on Carroll Avenue reading a newspaper, several cars inched past 
his 102-year old yellow and white Victorian. Each time the retired actor looked 
up, it seemed, a stranger was staring back at him. Whitney smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't bother you," he said. "You miss them if they don't come by." 
</P>

A Peruvian diplomat was charged with smuggling 44 pounds of cocaine, valued at 
$10.3 million, into Britain in a diplomatic pouch, a British official and 
Peruvian sources said. A Customs and Excise spokesman said Jose Manuel Pacheco 
Nunez, 30, who was not accredited to Britain, was arrested in a London hotel 
after arousing the suspicions of Customs officers at Heathrow airport. The 
spokesman said that because Pacheco is not accredited to Britain he does not 
enjoy diplomatic immunity. In Lima, Peruvian Foreign Minister Guillermo Larco 
Cox said Pacheco is a second-level diplomat who may be dismissed from the 
Foreign Service. Sources there said Pacheco was in charge of the ministry's 
computer system.

A Munich-based newspaper reported that a member of the West German Parliament 
from the ecological Greens party has links to a Libyan-financed foundation. 
Party leaders said they will investigate the allegations. Sueddeutsche Zeitung 
said Alfred Mechtersheimer is involved with the M.A.G. Foundation for Peace and 
Solidarity based in Vaduz, Liechstenstein. It said the foundation was financed 
by a $10-million account set up in Switzerland by Libyan leader Col. Moammar 
Kadafi. Mechtersheimer was quoted by the newspaper as saying he acted "as a 
kind of adviser" to the foundation, which was set up to promote the "new 
thinking" in Libya.

The head of Lebanon's Muslim-led government appealed for peace negotiations 
after a 10-hour artillery barrage that turned parts of Beirut into an inferno. 
"A solution for Lebanon should not be negotiated through violence and guns but 
through dialogue among Lebanese," Acting Premier Salim Hoss said. Meanwhile, 
the head of a rival Christian government, Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, accused Syrian 
gunners of trying to assassinate him by shelling the presidential place in

A priest and nine other anti-nuclear activists were arrested at the Nevada Test 
Site in the town of Mercury after conducting religious ceremonies at a former 
chapel on the top-secret nuclear compound. Department of Energy spokesman Jim 
Boyer said 10 demonstrators, including some clergy members, were cited for 
penetrating the testing grounds -- a more serious offense than simple 
trespassing -- and transported to the jail in nearby Beatty. The incident was 
part of an annual Easter demonstration called the Lenten Desert Experience, 
sponsored by the group Nevada Desert Experience, which is opposed to nuclear 
weapons testing and the proliferation of the arms race. Boyer said there was no 
breach of classified security. The test site, about 65 miles northwest of Las 
Vegas, is the center of the nation's nuclear weapons testing program.

Democrats meeting in Casper, Wyo., selected state Sen. John Vinich to face 
Republican nominee Craig Thomas, a state representative in his third term, in 
the April 26 special election to fill the U.S. House seat left vacant by newly 
confirmed Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney. Cheney, a six-term Republican 
congressman, gave up the seat less than two weeks ago when he was confirmed as 
defense secretary by the U.S. Senate. Vinich won the nod over Bill Downes, a 
Casper attorney, and former state Tax Commissioner Carrol Orrison. Vinich said 
he hopes to influence some fellow Democrats in the House who have "senseless 
ideas and no understanding of the West."

U.S. and Vietnamese technical experts have discussed plans for further joint 
investigations to account for Americans listed as missing in action in the 
Vietnam War, the leader of the U.S. team said. Lt. Col. Joe Harvey, in a 
statement issued in Bangkok, Thailand, said the two sides met in Hanoi, the

Drug-related internal corruption and other staff problems are the targets of a 
special group of "field associates" deployed throughout the nation by the U.S. 
Customs Service. Spokesman Richard Weart said the agents "are assigned to a 
district office or regional office or to the office of enforcement" and are "to 
be alert for serious types of corruption. But they are not directly assigned to 
internal affairs." The Washington Post reported that Assistant Customs 
Commissioner for Internal Affairs William F. Green had recruited about 40 
agency employees as field associates assigned to key offices nationwide to 
"keep their eyes and ears open for any wrongdoing" among their colleagues. 
Weart said the approach of having employees act as informers against co-workers 
was "nothing new."

CANDLELIGHT ILLUMINATES VATICAN EASTER RITES

Thousands of small candles illuminated St. Peter's Basilica on Saturday night 
as Pope John Paul II celebrated Easter vigil services to usher in 
Christianity's holiest day. 
</P>
<P>
Before thousands of people packing the pews and aisles of Christendom's biggest 
church, the pontiff lighted a long white candle to open the service 
commemorating the tradition of Jesus Christ rising from the dead after his 
Crucifixion. 
</P>
<P>
The cavernous basilica was dark and silent as the Pope, preceded by cardinals 
and bishops, carried the candle in a slow procession toward the altar under the 
Baldacchino, the baroque canopy designed by the 17th-Century sculptor Gian 
Lorenzo Bernini. 
</P>
<P>
After the third chanting of the "Lumen Christi," or Light of Christ, the 
basilica slowly lit up as the congregation began lighting small candles to 
symbolize the "pilgrimage from darkness to light." 
</P>
<P>
The Pope then placed his candle at the altar, and the lights of the basilica 
were turned on. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pope Delivers Homily 
</P>
<P>
After prayers and readings, the Pope delivered a homily stressing the "natural 
power of water" and its role in the sacrament of baptism. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope then baptized and confirmed 16 people from eight countries: five each 
from Japan and the Korean peninsula and one each from the United States, 
France, the Philippines, Iran, Italy and Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
The American was Curtis Devorn Wilkerson, 26, from Joiner, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
"In a wonderful way, your baptism and the wait for the Resurrection of Christ, 
which will happen tonight, are taking place at the same time," the Pope said in 
his homily, delivered in Italian. 
</P>
<P>
The Mass lasted nearly two hours. The Pope was to celebrate an open-air Mass in 
St. Peter's Square this morning. 
</P>
<P>
In Britain, another Easter message questioned the view that Jesus Christ had 
literally risen from the dead. 
</P>
<P>
David Jenkins, the controversial Anglican bishop of the northern English county 
of Durham, said on a television program the Resurrection in the Gospels was 
spiritual rather than physical. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins said he believed the disciples had not seen a corpse coming to life but 
felt the spiritual presence of Jesus after his Crucifixion and burial. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it means a physical resurrection. It means a spiritual 
resurrection, a transforming resurrection, a real resurrection," he said. "To 
know He is alive in eternity must be more than the encountering of a ghost." 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins has stirred controversy before, questioning the literal truth of 
several basic Christian beliefs, including the Virgin Birth.

FOUR PALESTINIANS KILLED, 35 HURT IN OCCUPIED AREAS

Four Palestinians were killed Saturday and 35 were injured in some of the 
bloodiest outbreaks of anti-Israeli violence in the occupied territories, 
according to Arab and Israeli reports. 
</P>
<P>
The army confirmed four dead and nine wounded. It said two Palestinians were 
killed in clashes with soldiers in the occupied Gaza Strip. The bodies of two 
others found in Gaza were apparently killed after being suspected of 
collaborating with Israel, Arab reports and Israeli media said. 
</P>
<P>
After new unrest erupted, Israeli authorities imposed curfews on all refugee 
camps in the Gaza Strip and on several towns, affecting 400,000 Gaza residents. 
</P>
<P>
About 400 Palestinians have been killed in the 15-month uprising against 
Israeli rule. Fifteen Israelis also have died. 
</P>
<P>
Also Saturday, about 60 Israeli peace activists, including three rabbis, 
traveled to the West Bank town of Beit Sahour, where they discussed peace with 
dozens of Palestinians over plates of chicken and salad, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
The activists of the "Peace Now" movement said they sought to prove "dialogue 
between Israelis and Palestinians is possible when the government and the army 
do not interfere." 
</P>
<P>
The body of one alleged collaborator, Jamel Abdel Hamid Nadi, was found 
Saturday behind a school in Gaza City's Rimal Quarter with multiple stab wounds 
and signs of beatings, Arab reports said. 
</P>
<P>
The reports said graffiti reportedly scribbled on a wall near Nadi's home and 
signed by an Islamic fundamentalist group, claimed he had been killed for 
cooperating with the Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
The other body, found in Rafah in southern Gaza, was identified as Subhi Hamdan 
Elsoufi, 21. Arab reports said Elsoufi was killed as a collaborator. 
</P>
<P>
Israel television and radio also said both were killed on suspicion of 
collaborating with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
But the army denied either were collaborators and said that an investigation 
into their deaths showed "the men were killed as a result of an internal feud 
of a criminal nature." 
</P>
<P>
The two other deaths were in Rafah and Khan Yunis in the Gaza Strip, where 
soldiers opened fire on stone-throwing protesters, fatally wounding Ashraf Abu 
Jazar, 17, and Adli Erbea, 22, Arab reports said. 
</P>
<P>
It was one of the highest daily casualty tolls in the rebellion .

President Bush on Saturday called for "fresh thinking" to combat the daunting 
challenges that remain in the Middle East a decade after the historic accord 
between Israel and Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said in a statement released by the White House that the treaty that ended 
more than 30 years of war between the two countries 10 years ago today was "the 
product of vision, statesmanship, courage and persistence on the part of all 
the participants." 
</P>
<P>
Bush was spending the weekend with his family at Camp David, the presidential 
retreat where Israel's Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat worked 
out the historic agreement with then-President Jimmy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
"Recognizing the historic achievement of 10 years ago, however, turns our minds 
toward the still more daunting challenges ahead," the President said. "We need 
to complete the work they began. We must commit ourselves, as Anwar Sadat and 
Menachem Begin did, to fresh thinking." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said there is "growing understanding that a settlement can be reached 
which both satisfies Israel's security needs and addresses the legitimate 
political rights of the Palestinians."

SHOTS FIRED AT POLICE IN YUGOSLAV ETHNIC UNREST

Ethnic Albanian rioters shot at police Saturday as Yugoslavia's Kosovo province 
was shaken by a third straight day of violence, Tanjug news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators threw stones and bricks at police, and some fired shots from 
pistols, Tanjug reported from the Kosovo town of Urosevac, 150 miles south of 
Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
Tanjug did not mention any injuries, nor whether police returned fire. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Tanjug reported that police reinforcements ringed the town after 
dispersing the demonstrators but said there were sporadic clashes in back 
streets as protesters tried to regroup. 
</P>
<P>
Reuters correspondent Andrej Gustincic reported from Urosevac -- scene of the 
most widespread ethnic Albanian unrest in eight years -- that the main road out 
of town was strewn with broken glass and rocks. Three cars were overturned and 
a truck tire had been burned. 
</P>
<P>
In Kosovo, the ethnic Albanian majority objects to new rules that limit the 
province's self-rule and give control of the region to Serbia, largest of 
Yugoslavia's six republics. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators fired several shots at police in Urosevac on Thursday, the first 
day of riots following the agreement of Kosovo's assembly to the political 
changes. No one was hit and police did not return fire. 
</P>
<P>
Police ordered all people off the streets after dispersing most of the crowd of 
3,000 to 4,000 chanting demonstrators in Urosevac on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
A paramilitary policeman in a gas mask fired stun grenades onto one road, 
witnesses reported. They said protesters attacked three Yugoslav television 
teams, smashing cameras. 
</P>
<P>
The witnesses said the trouble in Urosevac flared suddenly. People were 
strolling around, then crowds gathered and shouted such slogans against the new 
rules as "Better dead than a slave." 
</P>
<P>
Police in riot gear and masks fired tear gas and used truncheons to break up 
the crowd and drive its members to the town's outskirts. 
</P>
<P>
Under the constitutional changes adopted by Kosovo's parliament Thursday, 
Serbia will control the province's police, civil defense, courts and selection 
of officials. It will also be able to change Kosovo's status in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Serbian denials, the 1.7 million ethnic Albanians fear these changes 
will erode their national rights. 
</P>
<P>
Serbia says Albanian nationalists are persecuting Kosovo's 200,000 Serbian 
minority with the aim of breaking away from the Yugoslav federation and joining 
neighboring Albania. 
</P>
<P>
In combatting resistance to the changes, the authorities have fired or 
suspended hundreds of miners and factory workers for defying work orders in 
Kosovo.

TWO STAPLESof Middle Eastern cooking since earliest recorded history, lamb and 
bulgur, seem to have a natural affinity. Bulgur -- wheat that has been cooked, 
dried and coarsely ground -- has a rich, nutty taste that blends well with 
lamb's distinctive flavor. 
</P>
<P>
These days, nutritionists are particularly fond of bulgur as a good source of 
fiber. Tabbouleh, the Middle Eastern salad, was the inspiration for the 
following recipe, best made with leftovers from a roast leg of lamb. Serve with 
Middle Eastern cracker bread and a green salad. 
</P>
<P>
LAMB WITH BULGUR, SPINACH AND SHIITAKE MUSHROOMS 
</P>
<P>
1 cup bulgur 
</P>
<P>
1 (14 1/2-ounce) can beef broth 
</P>
<P>
1 bunch fresh spinach 
</P>
<P>
4 fresh shiitake mushrooms 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup chopped onion 
</P>
<P>
1 clove garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
2 tomatoes, peeled, seeded and diced 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup toasted pine nuts 
</P>
<P>
1 cup cooked, diced lamb 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon fresh oregano leaves 
</P>
<P>
Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
Crumbled feta cheese 
</P>
<P>
Rinse bulgur, drain well and place in large mixing bowl. Stir in boiling broth 
to cover, place towel over bowl and set aside for 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Clean and remove stems from spinach leaves. Chop coarsely. Remove stems from 
mushrooms and discard. Chop mushroom tops coarsely. 
</P>
<P>
Heat olive oil in skillet, add onion and garlic, and saute a few minutes, just 
until onions soften. Stir in spinach leaves and mushrooms. Cook, stirring, 
until spinach wilts and mushrooms begin to soften. 
</P>
<P>
To bulgur, add spinach mixture, tomatoes, pine nuts, lamb and oregano, tossing 
lightly to mix well. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
</P>
<P>
Turn mixture into oven-proof casserole, and bake at 350 degrees 20 minutes. 
Sprinkle with feta cheese, and cook 10 minutes longer or until heated through. 
Makes 6 to 8 servings.

Joel Steinberg, convicted of killing his illegally adopted daughter, spent the 
first full day of his maximum sentence in a Brooklyn jail cell awaiting 
transfer to prison, officials said. The disbarred millionaire attorney, who was 
sentenced Friday to 8 1/3 to 25 years in prison for beating to death 6-year-old 
Lisa Steinberg, was forbidden visitors and was only allowed out of his cell for 
an hour of recreation in a jailhouse gymnasium, said Department of Correction 
spokeswoman Ruby Ryles. He was being held in punitive segregation, which 
entails being locked in a cell for 23 hours a day without radio or television, 
because he was discovered earlier this week with a 4-inch shank fashioned from 
a sharpened plastic spoon, she said. Steinberg's first stop on the transfer 
route will be the state's Downstate Reception Center in Fishkill.

Texas law protects prosecutors, and there is little chance Randall Dale Adams 
would be compensated through a lawsuit for his 12 1/2-year imprisonment and 
near-execution before being freed as the result of a movie about his ordeal. 
Adams was released from prison last week after new evidence brought out in the 
film "The Thin Blue Line" had strongly suggested that another man killed a 
Texas policeman. Adams' attorney, Randy Schaffer, said he intends to ask the 
Texas Legislature to authorize good-will compensation for Adams, who has since 
moved home to Columbus, Ohio. "Even if there's out-and-out misconduct ... you 
can't sue the prosecutor," Dallas civil rights attorney Doug Larson said.

As Americans look to the approach of the April 17 tax deadline, they are 
expressing more doubts than ever that the Tax Reform Act of 1986 actually made 
the system fairer, according to a Gallup Poll. In the survey on 1986 tax 
reforms, 39% of Americans say that tax reform has made for a less equitable 
distribution of the tax load, while only 13% of respondents feel the system 
spreads the tax load more fairly. An additional third (33%) think it has not 
made much difference. By contrast, a 1986 Gallup Poll found a majority of the 
respondents felt the new tax bill would either be no different (36%), or fairer 
(27%). Only one-fifth said it would be less fair (20%). About three-quarters 
(76%) of Americans expect taxes to rise. One-fifth (19%) think taxes will 
remain at their current level.

DOWNZONING FEVER RISES IN SAN PEDRO; 
</P>
<P>
INCREASED APARTMENT CONSTRUCTION CONCERNS 2 GROUPS OF RESIDENTS 
</P>

It was billed as a "town meeting" -- an open forum for the residents of San 
Pedro -- and it was held on a sunny Saturday afternoon when most people might 
be otherwise occupied. Shanaz Ardehali-Kordich, the anti-growth activist who 
planned the event, feared turnout would be low. 
</P>
<P>
She was clearly wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 400 residents packed the Peck Park auditorium March 18 to discuss what 
has become the hottest issue in San Pedro: downzoning. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 10 years after ethnically diverse San Pedro became the first community 
in Los Angeles to place strict curbs on its potential growth, many residents 
are saying they did not go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
Residents complain that shoe box-shaped apartments are scarring the 
single-family complexion of their seaside community. And the debate is taking 
on intensely emotional tones as people argue about how best to preserve the 
community for their children and their children's children. 
</P>
<P>
"This is like the last undeveloped beach city," said Ardehali-Kordich, 
chairwoman of the San Pedro Downzoning Committee, a grass-roots group that 
advocates a ban on all apartment construction, with the exception of duplexes. 
"We have to save it." 
</P>
<P>
The debate, however, will not be one-sided. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cost Concerns 
</P>
<P>
Some builders and business people argue that a ban on new apartment 
construction would cause rents and home prices to skyrocket in San Pedro, which 
is already becoming unaffordable for people who grew up there. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be a very emotional issue," said Leron Gubler, executive 
director of the San Pedro Peninsula Chamber of Commerce. "People do not want to 
lose the character and flavor of the community. The question is, 'How do we 
achieve that?' " 
</P>
<P>
Gubler noted that banning apartments could squeeze low-income people out of San 
Pedro. In an interview, he predicted opposition to downzoning on the part of 
some "old San Pedro families" who bought property with the intent of building 
apartments to provide retirement income. 
</P>
<P>
A member of one such family is real estate agent Bob Bradarich, who said his 
in-laws have property they had intended to develop. Bradarich said he is 
against blanket downzoning, saying he believes there are some parts of San 
Pedro where growth should be curtailed and others where it should be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my opinion," he said in an interview, "that these people that are 
adamantly wanting the downzoning are not really thinking in the best interests 
of the community. . . . There's going to be another 20,000 people in San Pedro 
in the next 10 years, and this is not going to accomplish what these people 
want." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, a 25-member citizens committee, appointed by Los Angeles 
Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, began what promises to be a lengthy examination 
of the zoning laws that govern development in San Pedro. Ardehali-Kordich, 
Gubler and Bradarich all were named to the committee, which is to make 
recommendations for change to Flores. 
</P>
<P>
The committee is limited to San Pedro residents, and it is weighted more 
heavily toward neighborhood representatives than business people. Only 10 of 
the 25 members do business in San Pedro and none are developers. The chairman, 
Noah Modisett, is president of the San Pedro &amp; Peninsula Homeowners 
Coalition, while the vice chairman, Bill Lusby, is a local architect. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's first order of business will likely be whether to recommend an 
"interim control ordinance" -- a temporary measure that would forestall new 
developments while the panel conducts its review. 
</P>
<P>
Flores said she limited the committee to residents because she wanted its 
recommendations to reflect a vested interest in San Pedro, and excluded 
developers because she feels it is difficult to "look at this unselfishly when 
all of your future earnings are tied up with the decisions that are being 
made." 
</P>
<P>
She said some developers were appointed to -- but eventually quit -- the 
committee that drew up the current San Pedro Community Plan. That plan, adopted 
in 1980 by the Los Angeles City Council, cut San Pedro's potential growth from 
a maximum population of 240,000 to 103,000. The community has about 70,000 
residents now. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-growth activists say that one of the problems with the current plan, and 
the zoning that goes along with it, is that it allows apartments to be built in 
single-family neighborhoods under the RD1.5 zone. 
</P>
<P>
RD1.5 permits one apartment for every 1,500 square feet of lot. On a standard 
5,000-square-foot lot, three apartments are allowed. Developers have taken 
advantage of that zone to tear down single-family homes and replace them with 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the RD1.5 zone allows developers to string lots together to 
squeeze in more apartments. Other zones -- such as R2, which permits duplexes 
-- do not allow developers to put lots together for bigger projects. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of apprehension right now about the RD1.5 loophole," said Jerry 
Gaines, a member of Flores' committee. "There's a lot of emotion right now, and 
it comes from example after example of old houses being removed quickly, 
overnight, and large boxes being put in their place." 
</P>
<P>
Flores asked the committee, which has no timetable to meet, to study the RD1.5 
matter and also to consider such issues as parking, landscaping and views when 
they look at the zoning code. 
</P>
<P>
The committee also is expected to look at apartment development along Pacific 
Avenue, which once was San Pedro's main commercial thoroughfare but has 
declined in recent years with the rise of business activities on Gaffey Street 
and Western Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
At the committee's first meeting Thursday, Flores urged the panel to be open to 
compromise and to come up with "creative, pointed" solutions. 
</P>
<P>
The councilwoman also marveled at the changes in San Pedro since the current 
plan was adopted. Many said then that the new development blueprint would hurt 
San Pedro's economy by scaring builders away. 
</P>
<P>
"It was revolutionary," Flores said. "At that time, people thought it was so 
restrictive that it would never work. Who would have suspected that, eight 
years later, that plan would be out of date?"

FISHER MAY BE INTERIM, BUT MICHIGAN WIN OVER VIRGINIA IS PERMANENT 
</P>

<P>
As the Michigan Pep Band saluted its basketball team Saturday with "Hail to The 
Victors," Virginia must have felt as if it had already endured a hailstorm. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines bombarded the Cavaliers, 102-65, before a crowd of 22,755 at 
Rupp Arena in the championship game of the Southeast Regional. 
</P>
<P>
Glen Rice dumped in 32 points on the retreating Cavaliers, and Sean Higgins 
scored 31 in 20 minutes off the bench. The Wolverines made 58.6% of their shots 
in extending an improbable ride through the tournament by Steve Fisher, the 
first interim coach to take a team to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
However, such instant celebrity didn't keep Tim Brant of CBS-TV from 
introducing Fisher after the game as Steve Frieder. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not so sure I care what you call me, other than (coach of) one of the 
teams headed to the Final Four," Fisher said later. 
</P>
<P>
Who would have thought it? 
</P>
<P>
Until 10 days ago, Fisher was an assistant coach. But when former coach Bill 
Frieder resigned March 15 to accept an offer to coach at Arizona State, 
Michigan Athletic Director Bo Schembechler told the Wolverines that Fisher 
would be Michigan's coach as long as it remained alive in the National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Little did anyone know that the Wolverines would reach the Final Four, where 
they will play the winner of today's Midwest Regional final, Illinois or 
Syracuse, in a semifinal game next Saturday at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Or that Fisher would become something of a folk hero. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, as Michigan students chanted, "Cut the net, Fish-er, cut the net," 
Fisher made his way to the basket at one end of the floor, where his players 
had left the nylon hanging from the rim by a single thread. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher cut it down and now it's on to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines (28-7) earned a trip by pressuring the Cavaliers at one end of 
the floor and literally shooting them down at the other. 
</P>
<P>
The former led to the latter. 
</P>
<P>
"They really got frustrated on the offensive end and didn't really play the 
defense they're capable of playing," Rice said of the Cavaliers, who upset 
top-seeded Oklahoma, 86-80, to reach the regional final. 
</P>
<P>
Rice said the Cavaliers seemed apprehensive even before the game. "It looked in 
the warmups like they were really worried about us." 
</P>
<P>
And for good reason. 
</P>
<P>
Rice made his first six shots, all from long range and the last three from 
beyond the three-point line, and Michigan, which ranks first in the nation in 
field-goal percentage, made 10 of 14 to open a 24-12 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt that Virginia may have been a little tight, and so we tried to take 
advantage of that by being aggressive," Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia never loosened up. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers (22-11) never got closer than seven points the rest of the way 
and trailed at halftime, 44-25, as Michigan made 57.6% of its first-half shots 
while limiting Virginia to 35.7% shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"What was really deflating, more than the way they played offensively, was the 
way we played offensively," said Virginia Coach Terry Holland, whose team was 
only slightly better in the second half, making 40% of its shots. "I can't tell 
you how deflating it is not to be able to score, particularly when the other 
team is having a big day." 
</P>
<P>
No Wolverines had bigger days than Rice and Higgins. 
</P>
<P>
Rice, who made 13 of 19 shots and scored 34 points Thursday night against North 
Carolina, was even more accurate against Virginia, making 13 of 16, including 
four of five from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-7 senior, expected to be a lottery pick this summer in the National 
Basketball Assn. draft, was named on all 109 ballots as the media's choice for 
most outstanding player in the Southeast Regional. 
</P>
<P>
It sounded as if Holland would have voted for him, too. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to rate players off individual performances, but I've seen him two 
games in a row and I'd have to say he's as fine an offensive player as I've 
seen in a long, long time, especially when you consider his range and his 
size," Holland said of Rice, who made nine of 10 shots in the first half. "That 
combination is very destructive and very difficult to defend." 
</P>
<P>
Virginia had its hands full, then, trying to defend Rice and Higgins, a 
sophomore from Fairfax High School in Los Angeles who is two inches taller than 
his teammate and possesses the same kind of range. 
</P>
<P>
At least, he did on this day, producing a career-high point total by making 
11-of-15 shots, including seven of 10 from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
Higgins helped the Wolverines build a 42-point lead in the second half, making 
six straight three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
Holland expected Virginia to make a run after halftime, but Michigan made 14 of 
its first 18 shots and Virginia continued to struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Especially ineffective was Richard Morgan, who averaged more than 30 points a 
game in tournament wins over Providence, Middle Tennessee State and Oklahoma, 
but made only two of his first 13 shots against Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
"The shot wasn't there today," said Morgan, who led the Cavaliers with 15 
points, but made only five of 18 shots. "I struggled on the release of it and I 
couldn't get open to get it off. Then I tried to create things, which was 
probably wrong. But I fell into that trap." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan, assigned defensively to Rice, said he was shaken when he realized he 
could do nothing to slow the Wolverines' All-American. 
</P>
<P>
"That really deflated my confidence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Also enduring a subpar day for Virginia was freshman forward Bryant Stith, who 
averaged almost 25 points in the Cavaliers' previous tournament games, but 
settled for only nine this day. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore point guard John Crotty had 14 points and seven assists and was named 
to the all-tournament team, but made only five of 13 shots. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Cavaliers were rushed offensively, which led to their poor shooting 
percentage and, ultimately, their demise. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't get too many good shots," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher gave credit to the Wolverines for that. 
</P>
<P>
"Virginia could not throw it in the ocean but part of that was Michigan's 
defense," he said. "I thought we did an excellent job coming out initially and 
pressuring the ball and not giving them easy baskets. 
</P>
<P>
"The more you miss, the tighter you become and I think that led to the 
lopsidedness of the final score." 
</P>
<P>
That, and the marksmanship of Rice and Higgins. 
</P>
<P>
"Once they got that working margin and they started feeling good about their 
shots, they got into a groove," Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
And set their sights, it turned out, for Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Southeast Regional Notes 
</P>
<P>
In eight seasons under former Coach Bill Frieder, Michigan advanced beyond the 
second round of the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. tournament only once and 
never advanced beyond the regional semifinals. . . . Michigan last reached the 
Final Four in 1976, when it lost in the championship game to Indiana. The 
Wolverines, who have made three previous trips to the Final Four, also lost in 
the final game in 1965 and have never won an NCAA championship. 
</P>
<P>
Glen Rice, Sean Higgins and John Crotty were joined on the all-tournament team 
by Michigan's Rumeal Robinson, who had 13 points and seven assists against 
Virginia, and North Carolina's J.R. Reid. . . . Virginia's Brent Dabbs scored 
12 points and took 12 rebounds against Michigan. . . . Higgins established his 
previous career high when he scored 22 points this season against Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Against North Carolina and Virginia this week, Rice averaged 33 points a game 
and made 74.3% of his shots, including 12 of 17 from three-point range. . . . 
Virginia's Richard Morgan, on Michigan's shooting: "It was frustrating because 
we were right there beside them and they still hit them." . . . Morgan had his 
problems from the field, but made both of his free throws. He didn't miss in 23 
attempts in four tournament games.

KINGS BEAT OILERS AND HOME IN ON ADVANTAGE FOR PLAYOFFS, 4-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With an impressive 4-2 victory over the Edmonton Oilers Saturday night at the 
Forum, the Kings served notice that they will be conceding nothing to the 
defending Stanley Cup champions when they meet again in the National Hockey 
League playoffs that are just around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings will be meeting the defending champions in the first round of the 
playoffs, which open in a little more than a week. That much has been decided 
already. But the battle for second place in the Smythe Division and the 
home-ice advantage that comes with it rages on. 
</P>
<P>
The victory Saturday, the Kings' third in a row over the team that traded them 
Wayne Gretzky last August, evened the season series at 4-4 and put the Kings 
alone in second place in the division, two points ahead of the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings improved to 39-31-6, and the Oilers dropped to 37-33-8. The Kings 
have four games to play, the Oilers just two. 
</P>
<P>
So the Kings took a giant step forward in a key game, one that Gretzky was 
calling "the biggest of the year." 
</P>
<P>
"Home-ice advantage is important," Gretzky said. "The thing is, they can win in 
our rink and we can win in their rink -- although theirs is about the toughest 
there is -- but if we have a seventh game, we want it in our own rink. It makes 
a difference then. That's why you play 80 games." 
</P>
<P>
Down the hall, Oiler Coach Glenn Sather was acknowledging the Kings' streak of 
victories and the Kings' edge in the race for second place. And he was trying 
to lay claim to the underdog role. 
</P>
<P>
Said Sather: "Wayne's done a lot for these guys. They're really playing. They 
just look like they want it more. It's the first time around for some of those 
guys, and there's not much more you can say than that." 
</P>
<P>
Marty McSorley, another King who has won a couple of rings with the Oilers, 
knows how Sather works. 
</P>
<P>
With a smile and a nod, McSorley said: "Sure, Glenn Sather is going to want to 
say they're the underdogs now. He wants to put the pressure on us. . . . But 
that team, with the talent they have, is not an underdog in any hockey game." 
</P>
<P>
That is not to say that the Kings think they should be the underdogs. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings and the Oilers have, among them, five of the league's top 10 scorers. 
The Kings have No. 2 Gretzky, No. 4 Bernie Nicholls and No. 10 Luc Robitaille, 
and the Oilers have No. 8 Jimmy Carson and No. 9 Jari Kurri. And everybody's 
list of top goalies includes both the Oilers' Grant Fuhr and the Kings' Kelly 
Hrudey. 
</P>
<P>
The win Saturday went to Hrudey, with a lot of help from his friends. 
</P>
<P>
Besides keeping the Oilers out of his territory, his teammates gave Hrudey some 
breathing room early by jumping to a 4-0 lead. And then they helped him keep 
the puck out of the net over the last 1 minute 38 seconds, when the Oilers not 
only had the power play but also pulled Fuhr, allowing them to attack six on 
four. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholls dazzled the sellout crowd of 16,005 twice in the first period, scoring 
first on a power play and then on a shorthanded breakaway. 
</P>
<P>
The goals were Nos. 66 and 67 of the season for Nicholls, who keeps adding to 
his club record. 
</P>
<P>
McSorley had put the power-play unit on the ice for the first time by taking a 
sharp elbow to the head from Oiler defenseman Jeff Beukeboom. The hit knocked 
McSorley's helmet off and sent him crashing into the boards in front of the 
Oiler bench as he raced up his left wing side, but he waited for the whistle. 
</P>
<P>
After one quick trip into their own end to retrieve the puck, the Kings spent 
almost all of their two minutes in a relentless attack on Fuhr, who made at 
least three brilliant stops before the quick-passing offense of the Kings 
finally overcame the outnumbered Oilers. The last series of passes went from 
Steve Duchesne to Igor Liba to Nicholls, who fired the puck in from the left 
side. 
</P>
<P>
Fuhr was beaten on two good plays and yet stopped 22 shots in the first period. 
Hrudey faced only seven in the period. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings' lead went to 3-0 in the second period when Steve Kasper skated down 
the right side, swept around the bottom of the faceoff circle and fired at Fuhr 
point-blank. It went to 4-0 later in the period when Mike Krushelnyski used a 
give-and-go play with Nicholls to put himself in front of Fuhr, where he deked 
right and flipped the puck into the left corner. 
</P>
<P>
At 16:23 of the second period, the Oilers finally got their first goal when 
defenseman Charlie Huddy passed the puck across the front of the goal to Jari 
Kurri. King defenseman Tim Watters blocked the pass, but before he could 
control the puck, Kurri had picked it up and put it past Hrudey. 
</P>
<P>
As the third period opened, the Kings still had 43 seconds left on a two-minute 
bench minor penalty, picked up by the Oilers for unsportsmanlike conduct at the 
end of the second. But it was the Oilers' Mark Messier who scored just 16 
seconds into the period, getting the shorthanded goal by rushing straight at 
Hrudey and lifting the puck over Hrudey's stick and between his pads. 
</P>
<P>
But all that was too little, too late after the Kings' strong start. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers' Kevin Lowe, who was sitting out the game with a suspension, was 
heading back to his seat in the press section Saturday night when a King fan 
made a remark to him that caused him to shove the fan. The fan fell on the 
steps and decided not to take Lowe up on his invitation to hit him. Later, 
however, other fans in the same group, seated just a few rows behind Lowe, 
continued to shout at him and challenge him until police escorted them out. . . 
. Three Kings missed Saturday's game because of suspensions: Jay Miller, out 
for one game on a game misconduct; Ken Baumgartner, out for two games as a 
result of his fourth game misconduct, and John Tonelli, out one game for his 
second stick infraction, a spearing foul Thursday night at Calgary.

ONE PUNCH, 88 SECONDS ARE ALL NUNN NEEDS TO KO KALAMBAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1 minute 28 seconds, with one explosive punch, Michael Nunn made all his 
skeptics vanish Saturday night, almost as fast as he made Italy's Sumbu 
Kalambay disappear at the Las Vegas Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn knocked out the former World Boxing Assn. middleweight champion with a 
short left hand that caught Kalambay on the right side of his face, dropping 
him flat on his back. 
</P>
<P>
It was as stunning as it was quick. Nunn was executing victory leaps in a 
neutral corner even before referee Richard Steele had counted out Kalambay. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn knew it was a once-in-a-career punch, the kind that makes a world-class 
fighter look like a guy who's just been hit by a bus. 
</P>
<P>
This one goes on the "Great Knockouts" video. It was like Sugar Ray Robinson, 
in 1957, knocking out Gene Fullmer in Chicago with that memorable left hook. Or 
Max Schmeling, in 1936, using that right-hand shot to turn Joe Louis into a 
sleepwalker. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the best punch I ever landed," Nunn said after earning $1.1 million, 
improving his record to 33-0, retaining his International Boxing Federation 
championship and positioning himself to take on a legend or two. 
</P>
<P>
By anyone's account -- even Nunn's -- this was a stunning result. It ended 
three seconds faster than Mike Tyson-Michael Spinks. The Zaire-born Kalambay 
didn't even break a sweat. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn was the aggressor from the opening bell, and Kalambay, now 46-4-1, chose 
to back up. Until the knockout blow, neither man landed a punch worthy of the 
name, but Nunn quickly spotted an error in Kalambay's style. 
</P>
<P>
When throwing a left jab at Nunn, Kalambay was dropping his fist instead of 
retracting it quickly into a defensive position. A lazy jab, trainers call it. 
It was only a matter of time, and Kalambay's time came in his own corner, not 
halfway through the opening round. As he came out of the corner, Nunn hit him 
with a couple of harmless jabs. Kalambay then threw his final punch -- the lazy 
jab. 
</P>
<P>
Worse yet, he dropped his right hand, too. 
</P>
<P>
Given the opening, Nunn delivered a short, straight left whose impact could be 
heard in the ringside rows. Kalambay seemed frozen for an instant, then he 
fell, almost in slow motion, onto his back. As Steele counted, Kalambay rolled 
over onto his right side, got up, then collapsed again, this time into Steele's 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn was a 4-1 favorite, but few were prepared for this. Kalambay, a pro since 
1980, had never been knocked out. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Surkein, the man who developed Nunn in the amateurs in Davenport, Iowa, 
seemed stunned himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone in this room can believe what they saw tonight," he said. 
"He'll go down in history as one of the great superstars in boxing . . . and 
let's see what the (Sugar Ray) Leonards and the (Thomas) Hearnses can do about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
In Nunn, promoter Bob Arum would seem to have a golden jackpot at the end of 
the Leonard-Hearns and Leonard- Roberto Duran fights. 
</P>
<P>
Arum even used the giddy aftermath to take a shot at Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Michael is going to develop into a bigger attraction than Mike Tyson," 
he said. "He projects better, he has a better image." 
</P>
<P>
Even though the WBA had stripped Kalambay of his world championship earlier 
this month, Arum had his ring announcer, Mike Buffer, introduce Kalambay to the 
4,253 present as the WBA champion. 
</P>
<P>
To Joe Goossen, Nunn's trainer, it didn't matter much that Kalambay was 
dropping his jab. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't matter, Michael was going to dominate the guy anyway," Goossen said. 
</P>
<P>
At the postfight news conference, Nunn sat at a table with his son, Michael 
Jr., on his lap, and daughter, Shanta, next to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to fight the legends now, the guys like Leonard, Duran, Hearns," he 
said. "I figure by April or May 1990, one of them will be left for me." 
</P>
<P>
On the undercard, two U.S. Olympic gold medalists remained unbeaten as pros, as 
did Kenyan gold medalist Robert Wangila. 
</P>
<P>
Most impressive was super-bantamweight Kennedy McKinney, the Seoul Games' 
bantamweight gold medalist. He had his opponent, Charles Hawkins, out on his 
feet halfway through the first round and stopped him at 2:37. McKinney is 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Maynard, the Olympic light-heavyweight Olympic champion, stopped Rodney 
Brown in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
Wangila, a welterweight, who looked like a sure-fire pro champion-to-be in 
Seoul, was unimpressive for the second time in his two pro outings. He couldn't 
put away an outclassed opponent, Luis Saucedo of Albuquerque. Instead, he 
stumbled his way to a decision in a four-rounder. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the undercard highlight was the second round of the Al Cole-Lorenzo 
Thomas light-heavyweight bout, when Cole pounded Thomas through the ropes. 
Thomas landed on top of Sugar Ray Leonard. Amazingly, Thomas climbed back into 
the ring and beat the count, only to be stopped in the third round by Cole. 
</P>
<P>
Marlon Starling, the World Boxing Council welterweight champion, will not fight 
Mark Breland, the World Boxing Assn. champion, April 15 at Atlantic City, N.J., 
as scheduled, because of an injured hand. The announcement of the injury was 
made after the main event.

<P>
Although most of the talk this season has been about the Detroit Pistons, 
Cleveland Cavaliers and New York Knicks, in truth, contention runs deep in the 
Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Hawks and Chicago Bulls, with Dominique Wilkins and Michael Jordan, 
respectively, are sure to make a strong bid for the championship. 
</P>
<P>
But the sleeper in the East may be the Milwaukee Bucks. With the departure of 
Coach Don Nelson two years ago, many thought the Bucks would start to fade 
away. 
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, they are one of the best teams in the National Basketball 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Although their leading scorer, Terry Cummings, was out with a viral infection, 
the Bucks, led by Ricky Pierce, beat the Cavaliers, 113-105, in overtime 
Saturday night at Milwaukee. The Bucks were also without Paul Pressey, who has 
a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce, moved to starting forward in the absence of Cummings, scored 29 points, 
seven in overtime, as the Bucks dropped the Cavaliers a game behind Detroit, 
the Central Division leader. 
</P>
<P>
"The good ballclubs find a way to win, especially when two starters are out," 
said Pierce, who has been a starter in only the last two games. "I don't care 
whether I start or come in off the bench. I just want to play." 
</P>
<P>
The Bucks rallied from an early 13-point deficit. 
</P>
<P>
With a 43-23 record, the surprising Bucks, who won only 42 games all last 
season, have the third-best record in the East. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 115, New York 108 -- Are the Knicks starting to panic? Only 22 days 
after undergoing arthroscopic surgery, Mark Jackson returned to the starting 
lineup in this game at New York. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks had lost two games in a row, one of them to Miami. But Jackson, a 
little rusty, was only six for 15 and had nine assists in 27 minutes. Wilkins 
and Moses Malone led the Hawks' offense as they handed the Knicks their third 
loss in 33 home games. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 144, Golden State 104 -- A sieve has finally developed in the defense 
of Don Nelson's surprising basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
In their last two games, both defeats, the Warriors have given up 298 points. 
Phoenix had 154 Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Although he played only 27 minutes, Akeem Olajuwon led the Rocket romp with 24 
points and 15 rebounds at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 111, Seattle 110 -- The Bulls completed a sweep of a four-game trip 
through the Pacific Division when Scottie Pippen made a three-point shot with 
five seconds left at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
In five nights, the Bulls beat the Lakers, Phoenix, Portland and Seattle. 
Jordan, despite a groin injury, played a major role in all the victories and 
continues to adjust to the role of playmaker. In this one he had 21 points, 12 
rebounds and 12 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Ellis, who scored 30 points, made a jumper to give the Sonics a 110-108 
lead with 20 seconds to play. Pippen's shot gave him 31 points and the Bulls a 
41-26 record. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 112, Denver 90 -- Karl Malone had 22 of his 37 points in the first half at 
Salt Lake City, but the Jazz broke the game open in the third quarter to end 
the Nuggets' five-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
In their last two games, the Jazz has beaten the two teams closest to them in 
the Midwest Division and lead Houston by 5 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 111, Indiana 108 -- If the Bullets have any chance to overtake the 
Boston Celtics for the last playoff spot in the East, they can't afford to lose 
any home games. 
</P>
<P>
Ledell Eackles and Bernard King sank the key baskets as the Bullets had to come 
from behind for their 11th consecutive home victory. 
</P>
<P>
Eacklesimade a layup with 30 seconds left in regulation to tie the game, then 
made another in overtime to raise the Bullets' lead to 110-104 with two minutes 
left in overtime. King had 26 points, including eight in the third quarter and 
four more in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
With 15 games remaining, eight of them at home, the Bullets trail the Celtics 
by 2 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 113, Charlotte 101 -- The soaring Pistons won this game at Charlotte, 
N.C., just about as they pleased. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Laimbeer made eight of his nine shots, and the Pistons were off to a fast 
start, winning their fourth in a row and 13th in their last 14. 
</P>
<P>
Although he played only 29 minutes, he had 16 points and 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Miami 107, San Antonio 105 -- Pearl Washington had two baskets and two assists 
in an 8-0 run early in the fourth quarter that helped the Heat win their third 
game in their last four at home. 
</P>
<P>
It was only the 12th victory for the expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento 106, Portland 105 -- Although the injury-riddled Dallas Mavericks 
have lost nine games in a row, the Trail Blazers are letting them stay in the 
race for the final playoff spot in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Ainge had 21 points, including five three-pointers, at Sacramento to help 
build a 14-point lead, and the Kings just lasted. DAN HAFNER

Janet Evans set an American record in the women's 1,000-yard freestyle Saturday 
night at the U.S. Swimming Short Course National Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, a triple gold medalist in the 1988 Olympics, was timed in 9 minutes 
25.49 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"Records are made to be broken," Evans said, "I wanted to take it out easy, but 
still fast and not spin my arms. Sometimes I lose a record when I spin my 
arms." 
</P>
<P>
Pam Minthorn was second to Evans in the 1,000-yard freestyle, then came back to 
win the 200-yard butterfly in 1:56.01. 
</P>
<P>
Jenny Thompson, 16, edged four-time U.S. Olympian Jill Sterkel to win the 
women's 50-yard freestyle in 22.66 seconds. Steve Crocker won the men's race in 
19.52. 
</P>
<P>
Derek Weatherford won the 100-yard backstroke in 49.08 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary's Tamas Darnyi won the men's 200-yard individual medley in 1:47.55, and 
Belgium's Jean-Marie Arnould took the 1,650-yard freestyle in 15:11.26. 
</P>
<P>
Longhorn Aquatics of Austin, Tex., took the combined title with 456 points; the 
Little Rock, Ark. Racquet Club won the men's team title with 230 points, and 
Dynamo of Atlanta was the women's champion with 276.

MIKE DOWNEY: COACH K, DUKE DOING IT THEIR WAY IN NCAA

Is this college basketball's best coach? Third best? Fifth best? Is this guy as 
competent and comical as he seems? Is this our next Olympic coach -- and, if 
so, is there something to be said for finally having an American coach who is 
as pleasant to be around as the Soviet coach? 
</P>
<P>
His unspellable, unpronounceable name is Mike Krzyzewski -- "shah-shev-skee" -- 
and what we presently know about him is that he demands and commands superior 
scholar-athletes at Duke University, vaguely resembles the actor Sam Waterston, 
and at face value is a kinder, gentler gentleman than the guy for whom he once 
worked, Indiana's Bob Knight, or the guy he confronts today in the fight for 
the Final Four, Georgetown's John Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
Word has it that Krzyzewski and Lute Olson of Arizona are the likeliest 
successors to Knight and Thompson as coach of the 1992 squad that would 
represent the U.S. in the Olympic Games at Barcelona, and a better choice than 
the K man we cannot imagine. In amassing six straight 20-victory seasons at 
Duke against awesome competition, Krzyzewski, or "Coach K," as Blue Devils 
everywhere call him, for understandable reasons, has demonstrated both style 
and substance. 
</P>
<P>
We have here a prim, proper, penny-loafered, practically genteel individual who 
once, waxing rhapsodically in the course of an otherwise ordinary basketball 
conversation, said: "I love trees and birds and flowers. I love the ocean, just 
to watch the ocean. I guess nature really is so fascinating to me because it's 
as unpredictable as people." 
</P>
<P>
These are sentiments he actually shares with fellow West Pointer and notorious 
tough-talker Knight, who has always seemed more comfortable in "nature," 
catching a salmon in a cold stream or aiming a rifle at a rabbit, than he has 
in human company. 
</P>
<P>
Like that other Coach K, Krzyzewski does display occasional fits of temper. He 
is no Captain Kangaroo. He can snap now and then. Generally, however, the Duke 
coach is a man of manners, matured by age and success, who never embarrasses 
his university and usually can charm his way through even the most tedious 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
Consider what happened here when a photographer abruptly stepped right in front 
of the coach and popped a flashbulb, only to experience a malfunction that 
triggered an odd, whirring noise. 
</P>
<P>
"Is that a Polish camera?" Krzyzewski asked. 
</P>
<P>
He shows little stress. Take this tournament, for instance. Sure, Duke could go 
to the Final Four for the third time in four years by beating Georgetown in the 
East Regional final today. Coach K's program is a big success. Except it has 
not escaped everyone's attention that Duke has never won a national 
championship, the Holy Grail of college basketball. 
</P>
<P>
To some, that is relevant. To the coach, it is not. "To me, there's no sense of 
urgency in sport," Krzyzewski said here Saturday. "We're trying to attain 
excellence, that's all. If your goal is to win a national championship, you're 
really losing sight of the things you should be enjoying from coaching. So, no, 
I'm not frustrated. I'd love to be frustrated every year the way we've been 
frustrated this year, win or lose against Georgetown." 
</P>
<P>
Duke's undeniably dedicated and adorably demented fans are happy to be in this 
man's camp. Before a Jan. 18 game against North Carolina, when their Blue 
Devils were still undefeated, an estimated 1,500 of them pitched tents -- 10 to 
a tent -- outside the Cameron Stadium box office for remaining available 
tickets, eight days before tipoff. The campsite was officially christened 
"Krzyzewskiville." 
</P>
<P>
The coach had 50 pizzas delivered to them one night. "Some coaches have gyms 
named after them," Krzyzewski said. "Others have hobo camps named after them." 
</P>
<P>
He has a wit and native intelligence that nicely accommodates this No Dummies 
Allowed institution of learning. Duke students know where the library is. They 
rarely call it the "li-barry," either. They even know their faculty deans 
better than they know Dean Smith. The best way to describe a typical Duke 
student, we suppose, is that he or she probably can pronounce their coach's 
name. 
</P>
<P>
Krzyzewski is the kind of guy who appeals to them, the kind who claims that the 
worst thing about tournament-time pressure is that his acne acts up. Not that 
he doesn't take his basketball business seriously. Far from it. It is just that 
one gets the feeling that Coach K could lead a very full, quite contented life 
if he threw away his chalk and whistle and never stepped inside another gym. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of John Thompson, whom he will be opposing head-to-head for the first 
time -- Duke and Georgetown haven't met since 1933, in fact -- Krzyzewski said: 
"He seems to me very intelligent, not just focused on sport." The same holds 
true for the man doing the speaking, as well as for his and Thompson's 
respective universities. Georgetown, too, gives diplomas to relatively few 
morons. 
</P>
<P>
Duke recruits heavily in the District of Columbia area, even finding 
All-America forward Danny Ferry there, but Coach K gets around. He went all the 
way to Mercer Island, Wash., to land scrawny playmaking guard Quin Snyder, who 
hopes the Final Four at Seattle will become his own personal homecoming. 
Someone wondered what was so special about Snyder that the coach traveled 
nearly 3,000 miles to bag him. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, he's cuter than most players," Krzyzewski said. "My wife made me recruit 
him." 
</P>
<P>
In National Collegiate Athletic Assn. postseason play, Mike Krzyzewski's 
winning percentage (.750) is better than any active coach who has been involved 
in 10 or more tournament games -- better than Knight's, better than Thompson's, 
better than anybody's. Should he win today, so much the better. Should he lose, 
well, it won't mean anybody will be wasting away in Krzyzewskiville.

BEAST RISES WITH GEORGETOWN, DUKE;

EAST POWERS MEET FOR RIGHT TO PLAY IN THE FINAL FOUR

<P>
Questions, like points and rebounds, abound. 
</P>
<P>
Such as: 
</P>
<P>
Which East Coast college basketball power -- Georgetown or Duke -- will survive 
today's East Regional title game and advance to the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. tournament's Final Four? 
</P>
<P>
Who will own the lane -- Danny Ferry, Duke's 6-foot 10-inch All-American of the 
present, or Alonzo Mourning, Georgetown's 6-10 All-American of the future? 
</P>
<P>
Which part-time player will be the favorite of the international satellite-dish 
set -- Georgetown's 7-foot Dikembe Mutombo or Duke's 6-10 Alaa Abdelnaby? 
</P>
<P>
And in what shape will we find these teams' outstanding senior guards -- Duke's 
Quin Snyder, who lately has been stricken with migraine headaches, and 
Georgetown's Charles Smith, who has been running a fever that keeps him playing 
hot and cold? 
</P>
<P>
Smith could hold the most important answer, if favored Georgetown is to win 
this season-making game. Coach John Thompson wants the real Charles Smith to 
please show up. The one who was voted the Big East Conference's player of the 
year. The one who averaged nearly 20 points a night. 
</P>
<P>
After Smith scored one point in 32 minutes in Friday's 69-61 victory over North 
Carolina State, Thompson wondered just how much Smith's strength had been 
sapped by his bout with the flu, and just how long it would take him to fully 
recover. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran into a friend who said, 'Charles Smith didn't look too good last night,' 
" Thompson said Saturday. "I know what he meant. Charles didn't feel too good, 
and I don't feel too good, either, when he's not around." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said he was reminded of a scene in a film in which a dead soldier was 
strapped to a horse and sent out to lead a charge, simply for inspiration's 
sake. He was thinking of trying that with Smith, he joked. 
</P>
<P>
Smith managed only a season-low four points in the regional opener against 
Princeton, but then bounced back with a healthy 34 against Notre Dame. 
Supposedly, he was back in form. Against N.C. State, though, Smith looked 
sickly. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who had snapped, "I'm entitled to a bad game," after the Princeton 
affair, claimed he got motivated against Notre Dame by a courtside fan who at 
halftime hollered that he was overrated. Thompson also took credit for prodding 
Smith with a 2 a.m. phone call that told him to stop being so nice and start 
being more selfish. 
</P>
<P>
"See, Charles gets caught up too much in that company line of ours where he 
thanks his teammates for everything and plays the game like it's an 
equal-opportunity sport," Thompson said. "It's not an equal-opportunity sport. 
He has to get things going for us and take over sometimes. We're a better team 
when he's not so democratic." 
</P>
<P>
Mourning, who looks up to the senior despite being nine inches taller, said of 
Smith: "He's our leader. It seems like the whole team rides on his shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
So, as Smith goes today, the Hoyas might go. Funny how these things work 
sometimes: Smith's teammates hope he is feeling selfish and malevolent, while 
Duke's players hope he is feeling sweet and benevolent. A timid Smith would 
work to Georgetown's disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
Even Ferry remembers, from U.S. Olympic training camp, that Smith was "the 
politest person I'd ever met." 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Devils would love it if Smith, a defensive ace, would politely allow 
them to drive right past him. 
</P>
<P>
Also worrying Duke is the shot-rejecting Mourning, who blocked five Friday 
night. Snyder said he and the Blue Devils intended to practice Saturday using 
the "broomstick method" -- having someone bat down shots with a broom, for an 
idea of how difficult it will be to shoot over Mourning's reach. "You can't 
pull up for a jump shot two feet from him or you'll get it blocked," Ferry 
said. "You've got to drive on him." 
</P>
<P>
The last time Duke confronted such an intimidating center, Blue Devil Coach 
Mike Krzyzewski said, it was Navy's David Robinson. "But he just had a bunch of 
Midshipmen around him," said the coach, an old Army man who could not resist a 
dig. "Georgetown's got some players to go along with Mourning." 
</P>
<P>
East Regional Notes 
</P>
<P>
Dikembe Mutombo, the Georgetown sophomore from Kinshasa, Zaire, was asked if he 
was familiar with Seattle, the Final Four site. "Oh, yes. I have big map of 
United States," he said. . . . Smiling his way through a locker-room 
conversation, Mutombo was interrupted by a mock-angry Georgetown Coach John 
Thompson, who said: "You're enjoying that interview too much. You can't do that 
if you want to be a good Georgetown man." 
</P>
<P>
A victory today would be Thompson's 400th. . . . Georgetown is averaging a 
staggering 9.2 blocks a game, and has long since eclipsed the National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. season record for blocks by a team. . . . When 
Charles Smith was a scrawny, 160-pound high school player, Thompson told him, 
on a recruiting visit in front of Smith's mother, "You will never start for us. 
Don't pout." The coach says now: "He epitomizes the person who's pulled himself 
up by his bootstraps." 
</P>
<P>
The career series favors Georgetown, 4-2, but the schools last met in 1933. 
"I'm amazed we haven't run into each other at least in tournaments," Duke Coach 
Mike Krzyzewski said. . . . Duke hasn't met any Big East team since a 1985 
National Invitation Tournament game against St. John's. . . . For the record: 
iDuke alumnus Richard M. Nixon was in the stands Friday night. His absence was 
incorrectly reported in some editions Saturday.

GOLF ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
NORMAN IS SEEING IN TRIPLICATE AND HE LIKES IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Greg Norman, fully recovered from a wrist injury he suffered last year, shot 
his third consecutive 68 Saturday to take the lead after three rounds of the 
USF&amp;G golf tournament at New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
"Four of these would be nice, wouldn't it," Norman said after moving past Tim 
Simpson for first place. "That's probably what it will take, anyway. I hope I 
shoot another 68 tomorrow, then we'll see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
Norman tore tendons in his left wrist last summer when his club hit a submerged 
boulder in the second round of the U.S. Open. He missed nearly two months of 
play and was slowed the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm doing well, playing well, hitting solid irons," he said. "I made a couple 
of nice putts. I think I missed three fairways all day." 
</P>
<P>
Norman's 54-hole score of 12-under-par 204 put him one shot ahead of Simpson, 
who entered the day tied for the lead with Dan Forsman. Simpson shot a 70. 
</P>
<P>
Norman had six birdies and two bogeys. His shortest birdie putt was a 
five-footer on the second hole. He also sank birdie putts of 15, 30, 30, 12 and 
12 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson had a chance to tie for the lead but bogeyed the 18th hole. 
</P>
<P>
"It was about as bad as anybody could putt," Simpson said. "I had an 
opportunity to run away and hide, slam the door, and I couldn't do it. At the 
very worst, I should be 15-16 under par. I'm so frustrated, I want to pull my 
hair out." 
</P>
<P>
Forsman had a 71 and was tied with Hal Sutton at 206. Sutton eagled the 11th 
after a 305-yard drive, a 240-yard 4-iron and a putt of less than six inches. 
</P>
<P>
After six years of being at or near the top in earnings, Sutton fell to 88th on 
the money list last year, when his best finish was 10th in the L.A. Open. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel a lot better about my game. And I think my self-esteem is better," 
Sutton said. "I was pretty down on myself. I never believed I'd hit the depths 
I hit." 
</P>
<P>
He said he had become too involved in other interests and lost his 
concentration. 
</P>
<P>
"I swung as bad last year as I ever did in my life," Sutton said. "I didn't 
think it was possible I could swing that bad, and lo and behold. . . . I hope 
this doesn't come back to haunt me tomorrow, but my game has been pretty solid 
all week." 
</P>
<P>
P.H. Horgan III was in fifth place at 207, and Payne Stewart was sixth at 208. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Kite, seeking a third consecutive tournament victory, shot a 74 and was at 
213, nine strokes behind. The last golfer to win three in a row was Gary Player 
in 1978. 
</P>

Beth Daniel sank an eight-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole to shoot a 
three-under-par 70 and take a one-shot lead over Allison Finney after three 
rounds of the $400,000 LPGA Turquoise tournament at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, it was my most consistent round this week as far as ball-striking," 
Daniel said. "I hit it very solid. Things are starting to look pretty good out 
there. If I can just shoot under par (today), the rest of the field has to 
shoot more under par to catch me. I feel pretty good about my chances." 
</P>
<P>
Daniel, who won this tournament in 1982 when it was played in nearby Sun City, 
had four birdies and one bogey. Her birdie on the 18th put her at 11-under-par 
208 heading into today's final round. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel, 32, is trying for the 15th win in her 11-year LPGA career. She hasn't 
won since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Finney, a non-winner in seven years, had a three-shot lead over Daniel after 
two rounds but shot a 74 for a three-round total of 209. 
</P>
<P>
"I was nervous today," said Finney, whose best previous finish is a tie for 
second in the 1985 Mazda Hall of Fame Championship. "I just wanted to stay 
around par and stay in the hunt and that's what I did. I'm not too displeased. 
I just have to come back strong now." 
</P>
<P>
Penny Hammel, who started the day six shots behind Finney, shot a 69 to move 
into third place at 210. Patti Rizzo had a 72 and was next at 211. Rosie Jones 
moved from 14th to fifth place at 213 after shooting a 69. 
</P>
<P>
Rizzo called her round "a boring day. I didn't hit it as close as yesterday. My 
ball marks were close, but I couldn't stop the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Ok-Hee Ku of South Korea shot a 74 and was in a six-way tie 
for sixth at 215. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Bob Charles of New Zealand shot a one-under-par 71 to take a 
three-stroke lead after the second round of a $370,000 Senior tournament in 
Katori, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Charles had a six-under-par 138 over the 6,660-yard Oak Hills Country Club 
course. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Mowry shot a 72 and is three strokes back in second place at 141. Tommy 
Aaron and Don January both shot 71 to share third at 142.

Mats Wilander, the world's No. 2-ranked player who has started slowly this 
year, was upset Saturday by Argentina's Alberto Mancini in the third round of 
the International Players Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Mancini, seeded 31st in the two-week tournament, defeated the defending 
champion, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-3. Mancini's strong cross-court backhand is among 
the best he has seen, Wilander said. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew he was really good, but I didn't think he could keep it up for that 
long," said Wilander, who won three Grand Slam events in 1988 but is off to a 
3-3 start this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he played really well. It seemed he was doing all the right things." 
</P>
<P>
Wilander lost his No. 1 ranking to Ivan Lendl after being beaten by Ramesh 
Krishnan of India in the second round of the Australian Open. He entered the 
International Players Championships with a 1-2 record after countryman Mikael 
Pernfors defeated him in a first-round match of the WCT Championships at 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander said his biggest problem has been a lack of playing time in 
tournaments but he was encouraged after beating David Pate and Scott Warner 
last week in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
But when Mancini, 19, broke him for a 2-1 lead in the third set, Wilander began 
to sense the match slipping away. 
</P>
<P>
Mancini, ranked 41st, said: "I felt stronger and felt like if I could win the 
second set, he would have a hard time beating me. 
</P>
<P>
Yannick Noah, seeded 12th, avoided an upset by overcoming a two-set deficit to 
defeat Alexander Volkov of the Soviet Union, 5-7, 6-7, 7-5, 6-3, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
In another five-setter, Carl Uwe-Steeb outlasted Jim Courier, 6-4, 4-6, 7-5, 
4-6, 6-4. Steeb defeated third-seeded Andre Agassi in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Gabriela Sabatini won her third consecutive match in straight sets, 
dominating Belinda Cordwell of New Zealand, 6-2, 6-1, to reach the fourth round 
of the women's draw of the $2.1-million event. 
</P>
<P>
The top-seeded Sabatini, 18, has bounced back from a third-round loss in the 
Virginia Slims of Florida tournament with impressive victories over Elly 
Hakami, Catherine Suire and Cordwell. 
</P>
<P>
She hasn't lost a game in three of the six sets and defeated Cordwell in 70 
minutes to set up a fourth-round match against Anne Grossman. 
</P>
<P>
Helena Sukova and Lori McNeil, seeded third and 10th, also advanced during the 
day session at the International Tennis Center. Meanwhile, sixth-seeded Manuela 
Maleeva of Bulgaria and No. 12 Arantxa Sanchez of Spain lost in straight sets. 
</P>
<P>
In men's play, fifth-seeded Jakob Hlasek of Switzerland beat Mark Kratzmann of 
Australia, 6-4, 6-0, 6-4; No. 14 Mikael Pernfors defeated Mexico's Leonardo 
Lavalle 1-6, 6-2, 6-1, 6-4, and Jim Grabb upset 16th-seeded Darren Cahill of 
Australia, 6-4, 0-6, 7-6, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Sukova, of Czechoslovakia, defeated Barbara Paulus of Austria, 6-1, 6-2, and 
McNeil downed Tine Scheuer-Larsen of Denmark, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Maleeva was hampered by two sore ankles and lost to Isabelle Demongeot of 
France, 6-3, 6-2. She hurt her left ankle in a tournament at Indian Wells three 
weeks ago and injured her right ankle here in a second-round victory over Gigi 
Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
Gretchen Magers upset Sanchez, 7-5, 6-3, and Grossman advanced to her match 
against Sabatini with a 6-3, 6-1 victory over Halle Cioffi.

MAPLE LEAFS KEEP HOPES ALIVE, 6-5

<P>
There was jubilation in Toronto Saturday night as the Maple Leafs rallied for 
four goals in the last 10 minutes to beat the Detroit Red Wings, 6-5, and keep 
their National Hockey League playoff hopes alive. 
</P>
<P>
With Ed Olczyk scoring two of his three goals in the late rush, the Maple Leafs 
moved within two points of the fourth-place Chicago Blackhawks in the Norris 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
The Maple Leafs have three games remaining, the Blackhawks four. The teams meet 
in the final game of the season April 2. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the loss, the Red Wings moved closer to clinching the Norris title. 
With St. Louis losing, the Red Wings need only one more point to win the 
division. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 1, Montreal 1 -- Former King defenseman Larry Murphy scored on a 
power play with 1:57 left in regulation at Montreal to give the North Stars a 
tie. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy's 10th goal put the North Stars just two points behind St. Louis in the 
race for second place in the Norris Division. The team that finishes second 
gets home-ice advantage in the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The tie gave Montreal a 110-109 lead over the Calgary Flames in the bid for the 
best overall record. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 6, New York Rangers 1 -- In the last two nights, the Flyers have 
virtually assured the Washington Capitals the title in the Patrick Division. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, the Flyers played poorly and lost to the Capitals. But they 
returned home to play one of their best games in a long time. Dave Poulin 
scored twice for the Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
With only five games to play, the Capitals lead the Rangers by six points. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 6, Chicago 3 -- Ken Linseman scored the tiebreaking goal with 7:17 left 
at Boston as the Bruins moved within a point of clinching second place in the 
Adams Division. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins weren't assured of the win until Ray Bourque scored into an empty 
net with 28 seconds left. Chris Janney completed the scoring with his second 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 4, St. Louis 0 -- Rookie goaltender Peter Sidorkiewicz stopped 29 
shots at Hartford, Conn., for his fourth shutout to keep the Whalers in the 
battle for third place in the Adams Division. 
</P>
<P>
The Whalers trail the third-place Buffalo Sabres by only two points and have 
four games left. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 5, New Jersey 4 -- Mario Lemieux had a hat trick as the Penguins 
bounced back from a 3-0 deficit. Lemieux's final goal, his 77th of the season, 
came with just five seconds remaining at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Quebec 4, Buffalo 1 -- Goaltender Ron Tugnutt stopped 30 shots at Quebec, and 
the Nordiques built a 4-0 second-period lead. DAN HAFNER

Former Olympic diver Bruce Kimball's insurance companies have reached "an 
agreement in principle" to pay a total of $1.3 million to five victims of the 
car accident that killed two teen-agers and injured six others last August, 
Kimball's attorney, James A. Murman, said. 
</P>
<P>
Word of the agreement came a week before Kimball plans to ask a judge to reduce 
his 17-year prison sentence for drunk-driving manslaughter. Kimball, 25, is 
seeking a term of less than 10 years, which could mean a transfer out of 
maximum-security Tomoka Correctional Institution.

Pete Rose described as "ridiculous" a report that he flashed signals relating 
to baseball betting to a friend in the stands at Riverfront Stadium, denied 
other gambling allegations made about him and warned of possible legal action 
because of some of the reports. 
</P>
<P>
In his first interview about the substance of allegations contained in a Sports 
Illustrated story, the Cincinnati Reds manager questioned the credibility of 
sources named by the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"They talked with four guys: two of them go to jail, the other says he's a 
bookie, and the other one's my friend; they didn't say nothing about him," Rose 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rose declined to say whether he has bet on baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying anything about that," he said. "I'll have my chance to talk. 
Now my best comment is 'no comment' because no comment can help me right now." 
</P>
<P>
Rose said he is troubled by media reports about his alleged links to gambling 
and large debts. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll sit down when this thing is over and we'll read everything that's been 
written," he said. "If there has to be some things done, there will be some 
things done. People better know what they're writing, better have substantial 
proof."

Lawrence Taylor, the New York Giants' All-Pro linebacker, had no drugs in his 
system when he was arrested on an alcohol-related charge, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"There were no drugs," state police Capt. Thomas B. Gallagher said in reporting 
on the results of a urine test at the New Jersey State Police laboratory in 
Little Falls. 
</P>
<P>
The sample was taken after Taylor was arrested early Friday and charged with 
driving under the influence of alcohol after police found him sleeping behind 
the wheel of his Jeep on the shoulder of the Garden State Parkway.

FRIEDER HAPPY FOR MICHIGAN BUT WISHES HE WAS WITH TEAM

Bill Frieder, who left Michigan on the eve of the National Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. tournament, had mixed emotions Saturday as he watched the Wolverines rout 
Virginia, 102-65, to reach the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
"I was extremely happy for (interim coach) Steve Fisher, (assistant coach) Mike 
Boyd and the entire team," Frieder said. "You have to remember that I hired 
Steve and Mike, and I recruited these players. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course it hurt a little that I couldn't be with them, but I was there in 
thought and spirit." 
</P>
<P>
Frieder, who accepted the coaching job at Arizona State the day before the 
tournament started, watched the Southeast Regional final on television from his 
temporary home in Scottsdale, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
Frieder was ordered to discontinue coaching Michigan by Athletic Director Bo 
Schembechler after he accepted the Arizona State position. 
</P>
<P>
"I was confident Michigan could handle Virginia," he said in a telephone 
interview. "They were just a better team, bigger and stronger." 
</P>
<P>
Frieder said he missed some of the telecast because of his recruiting duties at 
Arizona State, "but I got back in time to see them cut down the nets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a fine record during his nine years at Michigan, Frieder's Wolverines 
never advanced to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
"If that's the worst thing that ever happens to me, I'll have a great life," he 
said. "I'm just thrilled for (seniors) Mark Hughes and Glen Rice because this 
was their last chance to make it. I'll have another chance." 
</P>
<P>
Frieder said he thinks the Wolverines can win the national championship. To 
reach the final, Michigan will have to beat the winner of today's Midwest 
Regional final between Illinois and Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
"Illinois is an extremely tough basketball team," Frieder said. "They're 
undefeated with (guard) Kendall Gill. Of course, Michigan is undefeated with 
Steve Fisher." 
</P>
<P>
Frieder said it would be "a crime" if Fisher isn't named as his replacement. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a loyal assistant for seven years and now he's doing a great job in the 
tournament," Frieder said.

QUICK WIN LIFTS NUNN TO THE TOP OF HIS CLASS

<P>
A superstar was born here Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Once the best-kept secret in the Valley, Michael Nunn, with one devastating 
punch, has become a world-wide commodity. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Nunn, who was mocked by both the media and early opponents like Mike 
Tinley and Darnell Knox, has Sugar Ray Leonard squirming. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, promoter Bob Arum, who has been preoccupied hyping the Legends of 
Boxing -- Leonard, Thomas Hearns and Roberto Duran -- talks about seeing the 
future. And the future is Michael Nunn. 
</P>
<P>
To many, it is future shock to see Nunn, long hampered by a reputation as a 
slapper rather than a puncher, looming over the middleweight division. 
</P>
<P>
But his devastating first-round knockout of Sumbu Kalambay at the Las Vegas 
Hilton left Nunn -- who began his career far from the spotlight, fighting 
primarily at The Country Club in Reseda -- knocking on the door to boxing's 
penthouse. 
</P>
<P>
Make that banging on the door. 
</P>
<P>
Here is Leonard, set to meet Hearns in a June blockbuster with Duran awaiting 
the winner, and all people wanted to know Saturday was when would Leonard meet 
Nunn? 
</P>
<P>
Leonard, on hand as a television commentator, played down talk of a 
Leonard-Nunn fight, calling it "speculation" at this point. 
</P>
<P>
Arum did not, however. 
</P>
<P>
"If whichever one of the Legends," said Arum, referring to Leonard, Hearns and 
Duran, "who is left standing at the end of the year wants to fight Nunn, it'll 
be great. If not, we'll just keep Michael fighting other people. There are 
plenty of great fighters out there. But I think the last one standing is going 
to come to me and demand, 'Get me Michael Nunn.' " 
</P>
<P>
Arum, of course, is in the business of creating such situations, but another 
spectator at Saturday's fight already is already asking for Nunn, and is 
willing to put up the money to get him. Jerry Buss, owner of the Forum, wants 
Nunn's next fight to be in his Inglewood facility. 
</P>
<P>
"We could never compete for a number of big fights," said Buss, who stages 
monthly cards at the Forum, "but occasionally we'd like to get a big fight and 
I think the town is ready for this one. There's a feeling that this would be 
the fight for our city. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Lakers have shown that Los Angeles will respond to quality events. 
I really think we have the market for this fight." 
</P>
<P>
It will not come cheap. One report Saturday speculated that Nunn's next fight 
will be in Paris in July against former World Boxing Council middleweight 
champion Iran Barkley, but that talk was cooled by all sides. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley would seem to be Nunn's next logical opponent. Leonard is set to fight 
Hearns on June 12th, with the winner to meet Duran later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves Nunn on the outside for about 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
But the possibilities are endless. 
</P>
<P>
Having stripped Kalambay of his World Boxing Assn. middleweight title several 
weeks ago, WBA officials are now planning to give that title to the winner of a 
proposed bout between Mike McCallum and Herol Graham. 
</P>
<P>
John Reetz, Barkley's manager, said he would prefer to see his fighter go 
against the winner of McCallum-Graham before setting his sights on Nunn. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd be in a better position," Reetz said, "if we had a title going in against 
Nunn." 
</P>
<P>
No way, said Arum when Reetz's statement was relayed to him. 
</P>
<P>
"If Iran Barkley fights the winner of McCallum-Graham," Arum said, "he will 
never fight Michael Nunn. Never. We are boycotting the WBA because of what they 
did to Kalambay, stripping him of his title." 
</P>
<P>
And what does Dan Goossen, Nunn's manager and the man who will ultimately make 
the decision on Nunn's next fight, say? 
</P>
<P>
"We can't hang around waiting on somebody else," Goossen said. "If we fight one 
of the legends, that's fine. If not, Michael Nunn will be a superstar by 
himself. If the deal is right, we'll fight anybody in the world. We have never 
ducked anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Nunn, who was already guaranteed $1.2 million for his next fight but now 
figures to make a lot more, just beamed a magnetic smile when asked about his 
future. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd just like to tip my hat to those legends of boxing," he said. "They made 
it possible for guys like myself, Barkley and Kalambay to fight. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, by April or May of 1990, I'll be fighting Ray Leonard. He's the old 
legend of boxing. But I'm the new legend." 
</P>
<P>
Who can argue that now?

LANARK PARK PROGRAM OFFERS BOXING AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO DRUGS, GANGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Such is Lanark Park's unsavory reputation -- cops call it the West Valley's 
biggest open-air drug bazaar -- that any report from there about kids punching 
each other silly raises the obvious questions: 
</P>
<P>
1) Does it involve crack? 
</P>
<P>
2) Is it gang related? 
</P>
<P>
3) Why aren't they using large clubs? 
</P>
<P>
But the other night -- in an effort to show the park's virtues -- kids were 
fighting for sport, not turf. They were taking part in a boxing exhibition 
sponsored by the City of Los Angeles Recreation and Parks Department and held 
at the Lanark Recreation Center, a small cinder-block gym inside the park just 
a few yards from a circular driveway, the main trouble spot. 
</P>
<P>
"They buy drugs there as if it's a drive-through McDonald's," said Vicki 
Israel, former director at the center. 
</P>
<P>
To counter the pushers, Israel started a boxing program for young neighborhood 
boys. It might sound contradictory -- boxing as an alternative to a life of 
violence -- "but you can't be a boxer if you're on drugs," Israel said. 
</P>
<P>
Boxing also gives kids an identity and a place to hang out. "Instead of 'Let's 
be in a gang,' it's 'Let's go to the gym,' " says Ray Notaro, a former 
professional boxer who helped found the program. 
</P>
<P>
The recent exhibition -- the third in 15 months at the park -- drew about 40 
young amateur fighters from throughgout the Valley and an estimated 300 
spectators, many from an adjacent Canoga Park apartment complex. The turnout 
was a tribute to Israel's persistence and commitment. When she started working 
at Lanark nearly two years ago, the community largely ignored her efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't get anyone here with cultural programs," said Israel, 35, who left 
Lanark earlier this month after being promoted to a similar position at North 
Hollywood Park. But the Lanark sports programs have been successful. On and 
off, she says, some 100 boys have participated in the thrice-weekly boxing 
classes. They're supposed to pay $3 a week, but few do, and "nobody is ever 
turned away," she says. 
</P>
<P>
The classes are taught by Morris Reif, 60, a former professional boxer who says 
he had 75 knockouts and was "a murderous puncher," and Brian Miller, 34, who 
learned boxing at Notaro's now-defunct Canoga Park gym, the Left Hook. Miller, 
a North Hollywood building contractor, volunteers his time. Reif, retired, is 
supposed to get a small salary but he is "only paid sometimes," Israel said 
with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
To put on the free exhibition, Israel and her staff hung a few dozen balloons 
and arranged more than 200 folding chairs in the small gym. She persuaded local 
singer Mike (Majik) Boyd to sing the national anthem over a feedback-whining 
amp, got John Antonucci as the ring announcer and coerced a couple of reluctant 
teen-agers to parade as ring girls. ("This is embarrassing," one of them moaned 
as she was greeted with wolf whistles between rounds.) 
</P>
<P>
Even though the exhibition wasn't on the scale of a heavyweight title bout -- 
7-year-old pre-flyweights traded leather in the opening bout -- it did cause 
Israel headaches. She had to deal with an official of the U.S. Amateur Boxing 
Federation who threatened to stop the fights unless the fighters registered 
with the federation ("But he cooled off," she said.) She also had to finesse a 
coffee machine that wouldn't percolate. And she had to worry. 
</P>
<P>
"The bell?" she said to Notaro. "Is the bell here?" 
</P>
<P>
Israel relied on Notaro, 58, for his expertise and his crowd appeal, playing up 
his job as technical adviser on "Rocky III" and association with Sylvester 
Stallone (legend has it that each broke the other's ribs during sparring). 
Notaro, who lives in West Hills with his wife of 37 years, was 20-0 as an 
amateur and 19-1 as a pro. He sometimes fought twice a week, under the name 
Rocky DeAngelo or Rocky Montano, but gave up fighting in 1958 to raise five 
children. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, Notaro opened the Left Hook, which he operated for 15 years. Why did 
it close? "I was tired of taking punches from all my little guys," he said with 
a smile. The real reason was money. Like Israel, Notaro let fighters train for 
free. "If I had a nickel for everyone who owes me 10 bucks, I'd be a 
millionaire," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Notaro, along with another ex-boxer, Frankie Goodman, donated equipment to the 
Lanark program. Goodman, who owns a small gym in Van Nuys, gave Israel a 
regulation 18-foot-square ring, but it wouldn't fit. So rec and parks' 
Construction and Maintenance division built a ring on the center's stage. 
Specifications weren't approved by the Marquess of Queensberry: 15 feet by 25 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like boxing in a hallway," Notaro says. 
</P>
<P>
Before the bouts, the fighters were weighed by Reif and Miller inside a 
12-by-20-foot room that also served as the locker room. With dozens of boys 
taping hands, shadow boxing, warming up and hanging out, the room ripened 
quickly. Reif took a deep breath and smiled. This was the sweet smell of the 
fight game, part of its chemistry. Fighting isn't pretty. 
</P>
<P>
"A fighter has to want to be a fighter," Reif said. "He has to eat it, sleep it 
and live it. He's gotta have 100% heart." Reif, who wears miniature gold gloves 
around his neck, looked at the kids in the room and moved into a boxer's 
stance, raising his hands. "I teach them balance, and little by little they 
learn," he says, "but I can't teach them to love it. That comes from them." 
</P>
<P>
The program's goal is to teach self-defense and confidence and hope the kids 
use their knowledge to promote good will toward men. This does not always 
happen. One of Reif's pupils, 16-year-old Juan Miranda of Canoga Park, was a 
pushover before he took boxing lessons -- "Kids on the streets would beat me 
up" -- but now, he has had four street fights and won them all. Boxing, he 
said, has become "my favorite sport."

MONTGOMERY'S ERIK RUSSELL: SMALL-SCHOOL BACKGROUND, BIG-TIME ARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART MATTHEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a sophomore pitcher at Bishop Montgomery High School, Erik Russell found out 
for the first time what it was like to stare down off the mound into the 
barrels of Mater Dei's bats. 
</P>
<P>
Now, facing mighty Mater Dei is a scary enough task for any sophomore hurler. 
But for Russell, it was even tougher, because the hitters he had been pitching 
against the year before were from schools with enrollments of roughly 200 
students -- like Providence of Burbank or Chadwick School of Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
And the lineup that the baseball team of Mar Vista Windward (150 enrollment) 
sent to the plate was never confused with Murderer's Row -- or Mater Dei, for 
that matter. 
</P>
<P>
Russell, the ace of Bishop Montgomery's pitching staff, is a senior now. But he 
spent his freshman year at Queen of Angels -- an all-boys boarding school in 
Mission Hills in the San Fernando Valley that prepares young men for the Roman 
Catholic priesthood -- toiling on the hill against the likes of Chadwick and 
Providence and Santa Monica Crossroads. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't really fit at Queen of Angels," Russell said. "I guess the priesthood 
wasn't my thing. We lived in dorms, and it was strict -- but we found ways 
around that." 
</P>
<P>
By the following year, Russell had transferred to Bishop Montgomery and was 
trying to fire fastballs past the power-stocked teams of the Angelus League. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of crazy that first year," Russell said. "Those first couple of 
months I had a lot of adjusting to do." 
</P>
<P>
Especially being tall, dark and handsome -- and armed with an 85-mile-an-hour 
heater -- after spending the previous year with 145 boys in a seminary boarding 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it would be a tough adjustment," said Bishop Montgomery Coach Bob 
Anderson. "Especially with all the women hanging over him. Now, I've seen girls 
come out to see the guys play. But the girls used to come out to watch Erik 
practice. They'd flock over him, while he was running laps, shagging fly balls, 
whatever. He used to get a little sidetracked." 
</P>
<P>
Russell handled the attention -- and Mater Dei -- with his typical easy-going 
attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little bit shelter-shocked, though," Russell conceded. 
</P>
<P>
That's better than being shell-shocked. And fortunately for Russell, a 6-2 
right-hander, that doesn't happen very often. Russell is one of those tall, 
intimidating power pitchers that college coaches and professional scouts love 
so much. His fastball, when it's on, is nearly unhittable. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, for one, sometimes wishes Russell's best pitch were a little bit more 
hittable. 
</P>
<P>
"Erik tries to spot the ball on a pin too much," Anderson said. "His biggest 
mountain to overcome is his walks. He sometimes tries to be too fine." 
</P>
<P>
In Russell's three years at Bishop Montgomery, opposing batters have hit a 
meager .162 against him. He's struck out 70 hitters in his 60 innings as a 
Knight. And Russell has allowed only five extra-base hits in his entire high 
school career. 
</P>
<P>
Which goes to show that when Russell gets the ball over the plate, opponents 
usually don't do too much with it. When he's throwing strikes, Russell is one 
of the most dominating pitchers in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll take that any day," Anderson said. "Let him throw strikes every day. 
Don't try to strike 'em out, just get 'em out." 
</P>
<P>
But on Wednesday, Russell's control was again his Achilles' heel in his second 
start of the season against St. Paul. 
</P>
<P>
Russell (1-1) pitched 4 2/3 innings of no-hit ball in that game. Unfortunately, 
he walked five and beaned another in the same span. St. Paul jumped at its good 
fortune and manufactured five runs to chase Russell from the game early. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just missing by an inch here and there," Anderson said. "Before I took 
him out, he was almost trying to aim the ball. Once Erik becomes a confident 
pitcher, he'll be a tremendous pitcher. He got roughed up, but he'll get back 
up on that hill. If the horse bucks you off, get back on." 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Montgomery (10-2-1) will need a confident Russell for the upcoming 
Angelus League stretch drive. The Knights, in Anderson's third year as a coach, 
rolled unbeaten through the preseason only to drop two of their first three 
Angelus League games to Servite and St. Paul. 
</P>
<P>
The team heads north this week for a five-day Easter Break trip. The Knights 
will play Dos Pueblos of Santa Barbara on Thursday and Santa Maria on Saturday 
in their two final non-league tune-ups before steering back into the thick of 
the Angelus League schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"The trip is gonna make or break our season," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, when Anderson took the helm of Bishop Montgomery's struggling 
program, no one would have thought the Knights could be a contender in the 
Angelus League. The school has yet to reach the playoffs in baseball since it 
joined the league. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson was hired as baseball coach three weeks before the 1987 season. That 
year, Bishop Montgomery stumbled to a 4-16 record -- but the Knights won three 
of those games in the season's final week. Last year, the improved Knights 
finished 8-12, including five wins against league opponents. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the Knights, playing Anderson's style of scrappy baseball, could 
battle their way to a berth in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"We just have a bunch of singles, doubles hitters," Anderson said. "We try to 
hit line drives, hit the alleys, and make things happen with aggressive base 
running." 
</P>
<P>
Russell is Bishop Montgomery's main power threat. He's hit a pair of big home 
runs -- against Mary Star of the Sea and against Serra -- and is batting an 
even .400 in the third spot in the Knight's lineup. Senior first baseman Joe 
Ezzolo, the clean-up hitter, is batting .514 with one home run. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Montgomery's leadoff man, Curtis Bowman, is a 15-year-old shortstop who 
was a reserve infielder on Torrance's junior varsity last year. He transferred 
to Bishop for his junior season and responded with a .362 batting average, a 
.620 on-base percentage, and some smooth leather work in the field. No. 2 
hitter Dudley Callahan, a senior third baseman, is batting .405 and has become 
a hit-and-run specialist batting behind the speedy Bowman. 
</P>
<P>
Russell is the No. 1 starting pitcher, although he relinquished some of his 
playing time earlier this year to give some of Bishop Montgomery's younger 
pitchers some work in the preseason. Andy Branch, another senior right-hander, 
is 1-1, and sophomore Armando Cervantes has won all three of his starts, 
including a gutty pitching performance in the Knights' 5-2 win over defending 
Angelus League champion Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
The contributions to the Knights' success this season have been democratic. 
Anthony Vuoso, a senior right-hander (whom Anderson had intended to use only as 
a spot starter), pitched the team's best game of the year when he came within a 
pitch of throwing a perfect game against Marshall in the consolation 
championship of the Serra Tournament. Vuoso lost the perfect game when he gave 
up a triple with an 0-2 count with two outs in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never gotten much respect around the Angelus League," Anderson said. "I 
think we're just as good as any team in the league, but we're a young team, so 
we've got to go out and prove it." 
</P>
<P>
One of those young players, junior southpaw Brian Papia, has emerged as a 
bullpen stopper (four saves) and has allowed Anderson to shift Russell from 
reliever to a starter for his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
Russell had the same type of eye-opening success as a young pitcher. As a 
sophomore, he came in against Mary Star with the bases loaded and no one out 
and struck out the side in 10 pitches. He turned the same trick twice last 
season, against Mira Costa and St. Paul. 
</P>
<P>
In last year's league opener, against Mater Dei (then 9-0 and ranked No. 3 in 
the nation), Russell proved he had the stuff to be a starter. John Newville, 
last year's ace, went down with a groin pull in the first inning, and Russell 
came in from right field to shut down Mater Dei with a six-inning, 
nine-strikeout performance as if it was -- say, Windward. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing he needs to work on is confidence," Anderson said. "He's got a 
tremendous amount of talent. He just needs to get out on the mound and do it." 
</P>
<P>
Russell had enough raw ability to earn a spot on the Houston Astros' Southern 
California area scout team this past winter. On that team, Russell honed his 
skills against college and minor league players, and Vern Ruhle, the team's 
pitching coach, showed him a split-fingered fastball. 
</P>
<P>
And he learned some valuable lessons -- one in particular from Scott Kline of 
UCLA, who crushed a 3-2 fastball from Russell that sailed about 425 feet over 
the center-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real good experience," Russell said. "Those college guys are gonna 
hit anything you throw them. I learned that if you make a mistake, you pay for 
it."

BURBANK'S LEWIS DASHES QUALITY 800 FIELD IN PASADENA GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although Todd Lewis of Burbank High considers the 1,600 meters to be his best 
event, he defeated some of the state's top runners in the 800 at the Pasadena 
Games at Occidental College on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, runner-up in the 1,600 at last year's Southern Section 3-A Division 
championships, came from behind to win the 800 in 1 minute, 55.37 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Among Lewis' victims were Morgan Bateman of Crescenta Valley, the defending 
Southern Section 4-A Division 800 champion, Eric Smith of Redlands, the 
fifth-place finisher in last year's state championships, and Troy Collins of 
Hemet. 
</P>
<P>
Running conservatively the first lap, Lewis was eighth (58.7) at the 400-meter 
mark. Frank Sharp of Eisenhower led in a relatively slow 58.1. 
</P>
<P>
After moving into seventh down the back stretch, Lewis launched his finishing 
kick with 230 meters left and quickly moved into fifth before sweeping past 
leaders Jason Jenkins of Eisenhower and Bateman with 120 meters to go. 
</P>
<P>
Though Bateman displayed an impressive burst of speed down the home stretch, he 
finished second in 1:55.66. Jenkins placed third in 1:56.11 with Smith fourth 
in 1:56.75. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, who ran 1:55.9 for 880 yards -- equivalent to a 1:55.2 800 -- in a 
triangular meet at Hoover High 10 days ago, ran a 4:27 1,600 leg in the 
distance medley relay a half-hour after his 800 victory, anchoring the Bulldogs 
to a fifth-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
Running the 800 to improve his speed for the 1,600, Lewis will make his first 
serious effort of the season at the longer distance at the Arcadia Invitational 
on April 8. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really looking forward to that race," said Lewis, who has run 4:14.5 for 
1,600 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Brown of Channel Islands and Greg Sheets of Taft also won individual 
events, Brown taking the 300-meter intermediate hurdles in 39.33 and Sheets 
soaring 14 feet, 6 inches in the pole vault. 
</P>
<P>
Brown placed second in the 110-meter high hurdles (15.20) behind JacquinWebb of 
Eisenhower (14.94) earlier in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Sheets, runner-up in last year's City Section championships, cleared the 
winning height on his third attempt before missing three tries at a personal 
best of 15-3. 
</P>
<P>
In other events, Mike Williamson of Thousand Oaks and Craig Lawson of Granada 
Hills placed third and fourth in the 3,200 meters, and Cindy Byrneof Canyon 
placed third in the girls' 300 low hurdles.

"Castle Park is the most experienced," Bonita Vista Coach Ron Pietila said. 
</P>
<P>
"Castle Park has all the guns," Sweetwater Coach Jim Mann said. 
</P>
<P>
"Castle Park is really tough," Marian Coach George Milke said, "I don't see 
anyone beating them." 
</P>
<P>
Picked to finish behind the Trojans, but not necessarily in this order, are 
Sweetwater, Southwest, Bonita Vista and Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
Bonita Vista 
</P>
<P>
Last season: 17-11, 8-5 Mesa League (second, tie). 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Ron Pietila. 
</P>
<P>
Top returners: Jeff Bogle (senior, P); Craig Caitlin (senior, P); Jimmy 
Ilusorio (senior, 1B/OF); John Solomon (sophomore, P/OF); Casey June (junior, 
SS). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: None. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Duplicating last year's second-place performance in a conference twice 
the size will be difficult. Pietila says the Barons' major strengths are 
athletes and arms. Getting them to coordinate with their minds is what worries 
him. "We go from the penthouse to the outhouse," he said. Case in point: In a 
recent Lions tournament doubleheader, Bonita Vista iced a victory in the first 
game on a 5-4-3 double play, then turned around and committed 12 errors in the 
second. There are only three seniors on a roster that includes four starting 
sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
Castle Park 
</P>
<P>
Last season: 25-5-1, 11-2 South Bay League (first). 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Bob Korzep. 
</P>
<P>
Top returners: Juan Beltran (senior, SS/P); Joe Carrillo (senior, 1B/P); Chris 
Morris (senior, OF); Jackie Sosa (junior, 3B). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Benjamin Gil (sophomore, 3B/P, transfer from Sweetwater). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Beltran is the key to the Trojans unlocking a section championship. 
Last year, he was a section first-team pick and the league's player of the 
year. He batted .379 with five home runs and 36 RBIs and compiled a 9-2 
pitching record with a 1.10 ERA. Joining him at pitcher are Carrillo (3-1, 
2.99), junior Bobby Cardenas, transfer Gil (7-4, 2.33) and Sergio Hicks (9-0, 
2.64), who's nursing three broken ribs. 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista 
</P>
<P>
Last season: 14-12, 11-2 Mesa League (first). 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Dick Barcus. 
</P>
<P>
Top returners: Alex Garcia (senior, LF); Garrard Galvan (senior, P); Cesar 
Martinez (sophomore, P). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: David Dixon (junior, DH); Donny Edwards (sophomore, C). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: "Hurtin' for certain," best describes the current state of the 
Spartans, winners of four of the last six Mesa championships. With its top 
three pitchers out, two temporarily and one for the season -- Derek Chapman and 
Martinez will be back, but Steve Trainor is likely to be lost with a shoulder 
injury -- Chula Vista looks to Galvan and Sean Desmond. Edwards replaces 
catcher Brandon Gregg, out with a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
Coronado 
</P>
<P>
Last season: 16-10, 7-6 South Bay League (second, tie). 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Ron Smock. 
</P>
<P>
Top returners: Jason Fledderjohn (junior, P); Rich Bledsoe (junior, 1B/P); Ted 
Forney (senior, C); Kirk Duhala (junior, OF). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: None. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The Islanders have established talents in Fledderjohn and Bledsoe, but 
repeating last season's second-place performance would be a major 
accomplishment in the expanded league. Fledderjohn, (4-1 with a 3.03 ERA, .356 
with five home runs and 15 RBIs) will be joined by Bledsoe (.370), Forney 
(.288) and Duhala (.286). 
</P>
<P>
Hilltop 
</P>
<P>
Last season: 8-14, 7-6 South Bay League (second, tie). 
</P>
<P>
Coach: John Baumgarten. 
</P>
<P>
Top returners: Chad Boyd (senior, SS); Martin Villanueva (junior, P/OF); David 
Chapman (junior, OF); Larry Beebe (senior, 2B). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Jose Silva (sophomore, P). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Run production isn't a problem for the Lancers -- they were pool 
winners in the Lions tournament with 29 runs in three games -- but errors have 
diminished their effectiveness. "We have as many errors as we do hits," 
Baumgarten said. Martin Villanueva (.280 last year) is hitting .500 now, and 
Boyd is a three-year letterman. 
</P>
<P>
Mar Vista 
</P>
<P>
Last season: 7-19, 3-10 South Bay League (fourth). Coach: Alex Santana. 
</P>
<P>
Top returners: Tim O'Neal (junior, P); Francisco Mondragon (senior, P); Jose 
Galaz (senior, OF). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Miguel Martinez (senior, P). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The Mariners will be hard-pressed to improve with a lineup featuring 
eight new starters. O'Neal should add some stability. He appeared in 17 games 
last year (3-9, 5.57 ERA), batted .273 and drove in 10 runs. Galaz hit .140 
last year and must improve to his .385 sophomore season form. 
</P>
<P>
Marian 
</P>
<P>
Last season: 4-19-1, 2-11 South Bay League (fifth). 
</P>
<P>
Coach: George Milke. 
</P>
<P>
Top returners: Leo Ortiz (senior, P); Alex Guevara (senior, P); Beto Martinez 
(sophomore, IF); Jamaar Brown (sophomore, OF). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Hector Concepcion (freshman, OF). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: How much the Crusaders will improve depends on how much they improve 
defensively and whether they can gain some intensity, according to Milke. The 
early 2-7 record indicates there's still much left to do. Ortiz and Guevara hit 
.350 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery 
</P>
<P>
Last season: 14-10, 7-6 Mesa League (fourth). 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Manny Hermosillo. 
</P>
<P>
Top returners: Alberto Candelaria (senior, P/SS); Chris Charfauros (senior, 
CF); Junior Manrique (senior, P/1B); Miguel Perez (junior, C). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: John Diehi (senior, RF). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The Aztecs return six players, four starters. Candelaria is 
Montgomery's pitching mainstay. He was the ERA champion of the league (0.53) 
and hit .350 last year and is 2-1 this season. The Aztecs will not hit for 
power, Hermosillo said, and will instead have to rely on ground balls and line 
drives. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest 
</P>
<P>
Last season: 2-21, 1-12 Mesa League (fifth). 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Tom Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
Top returners: Fernando Ontiveros (senior, P); Armando Magallones (senior, 
P/3B); Tony Delatorre (junior, P/2B). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Victor Caracoza (freshman, P). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The new and improved Raiders are 6-3 and were surprise winners of the 
GMC tournament under first-year coach Hernandez, a former Mexican Winter League 
coach. "It's a great thing for our program," said Tony Maio, the junior varsity 
coach. There are only four seniors on the 13-member Southwest roster. Caracoza, 
at 14 the youngest team member, was the winning pitcher in the GMC title game. 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater 
</P>
<P>
Last season: 15-14-1, 8-5 Mesa League (second, tie). 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Jim Mann. 
</P>
<P>
Top returners: Larry Meza (junior, SS/P); Issac Bruce (junior, 3B/P); Walter 
Magallon (senior, C); Joe Picone (senior, CF/P). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Lorenzo Inzunza (freshman, OF/P); Yoshi Ohkawa (junior, IF). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Pitching appears to be the Red Devils' strength with Vicente Garcia up 
from the junior varsity to join the strong trio of Meza, Bruce and Picone, 
three of four returning starters. Star catcher Juan Price is gone, but 
Magallon, a designated hitter last year, has fit easily into his new role. 
Meza, who hit .261 last year and was an all-section pick, led the league in 
walks and stolen bases.

<P>
Trina McCartney hit two free throws to put Oregon ahead for just the second 
time with 1:35 to play, and Stefanie Kasperski scored from underneath with 13 
seconds left to finish off a 67-64 victory over top-seeded San Diego State 
Saturday in the final of the Women's National Invitation Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
After Kasperski's basket, SDSU tried to set up for a final shot at three points 
but failed to score. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU's Chana Perry, who finished with just 10 points, was named the 
tournament's most valuable player. Brooke Meadows, who led SDSU against Oregon 
with 20 points, was also selected to the all-tournament team, as were McCartney 
and Kasperski. 
</P>
<P>
The score was tied, 34-34, at halftime, and SDSU didn't trail in the second 
half until McCartney's two free throws gave Oregon a 65-64 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Perry, playing her last game for SDSU (25-9), collected 10 rebounds. Perry, who 
broke tournament records by making 14 of 14 free throws Friday against Murray 
State to give her 23 in a row over two games, did not go to the line against 
Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
Julie Evans added 14 points for SDSU. 
</P>
<P>
McCartney scored a game-high 23 points for Oregon (22-10), and Kasperski added 
22. Oregon shot 57% from the field, SDSU shot 45%. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs led by as many as nine in the first half, 16-7, before Oregon came 
back to take its first lead, 29-28, on a Kasperski layup 3:13 before halftime. 
Evans put the Aztecs back in front with a 15-footer with 2:40 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU's biggest lead of the second half was eight, 54-46, after Perry connected 
on an inside shot with 10:14 to play.

DELTA ROCKET LAUNCH A BIG STEP FOR SPACE COMMERCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID OLMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If all goes as planned, a Delta rocket will blast off from Cape Canaveral in 
Florida this spring, sending into space the first payload of the nation's 
fledgling commercial satellite-launching industry. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas, manufacturer of the Delta, plans to mark the May 31 launch 
with a public relations bash aimed at wooing customers and winning political 
support for the U.S. industry. The aerospace giant plans to bring in 
congressmen and customers from around the world to witness the launch, and 
company executives are counting on the reliable Delta to perform according to 
script. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of attention on this launch," said Louis Raburn, general manager 
of McDonnell Douglas' Delta program in Huntington Beach. "It's a revival of the 
launch vehicle marketplace. And it's also the first step toward the 
commercialization of space." 
</P>
<P>
The commercial launch market is an outgrowth of the 1986 Challenger space 
shuttle disaster that led President Reagan to retire the shuttle from 
commercial-launching duties -- which mostly involve putting communications 
satellites in orbit -- and to encourage development of a private space industry 
using unmanned, expendable rockets. 
</P>
<P>
The United States was caught without a ready supply of alternative launchers 
because rocket makers had shut down their production lines years earlier when 
the government designated the shuttle, operated by the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration, as the nation's only launcher for both commercial and 
military satellites. It has taken the U.S. manufacturers -- McDonnell Douglas, 
General Dynamics and Martin Marietta -- about three years to modify their 
existing rockets for the commercial market and to get their production lines 
rolling again. 
</P>
<P>
However, even as McDonnell Douglas prepares for its inaugural launch, the 
American rocket industry is facing serious problems because of increasing 
foreign competition and a market that is sputtering before takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
"There are too many rockets and not enough satellites," said John E. Pike, a 
space policy analyst for the Federation of American Scientists in Washington. 
"The optimistic vision that people had of the commercial rocket business a 
couple of years ago isn't going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
About 20 satellites a year, on average, will be launched through the early 
1990s, according to various industry forecasts. With each launch contract worth 
between $40 million and $60 million, the annual worldwide market is valued at 
roughly $1 billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
While a $1-billion business is significant, industry executives are less 
encouraged by forecasts of little or no growth in the market through the 1990s. 
With more competitors joining the field, there will be less business to go 
around. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the soft market is that satellite customers, such as telephone 
companies, are booking fewer launches. Much of the telecommunications traffic 
that used to travel by satellite links now is being carried by ground-based 
fiber-optic networks. And new satellite uses that might give a boost to the 
market -- for example, direct broadcast of television programs to homes with 
satellite dishes -- have not caught on in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Price Disadvantage Cited 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the new generation of satellites is expected to remain in operation 
longer, perhaps 10 years or more, meaning fewer launches to send up replacement 
hardware. 
</P>
<P>
Another threat to the U.S. rocket industry, company executives say, comes from 
foreign competitors whose launch programs are subsidized by governments. These 
subsidies enable foreign rivals to market their services below cost, the 
Americans say, making it difficult for the American manufacturers to compete. 
</P>
<P>
Arianespace, the chief foreign competitor, receives its funds for product 
research and development from the European Space Agency, while American 
companies must fund those costs on their own, said Dennis R. Dunbar, managing 
director of General Dynamics Commercial Launch Services in San Diego. "We're 
carrying a $5-million to $10-million-per-unit price disadvantage because we 
need to recover that investment," Dunbar said. 
</P>
<P>
Arianespace is a 13-member, French-based consortium set up by the European 
Space Agency in 1980 to market launches to satellite customers. The consortium 
has launched 29 commercial satellites and claims more than half the world 
market for launches. 
</P>
<P>
Arianespace officials say American complaints about unfair subsidies are 
unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
"The subsidy claim is a red herring and always will be," said Doug A. Heydon, 
president of Arianespace's U.S. marketing subsidiary. "Since our company was 
formed nine years ago, we have been totally responsible for all our operating 
costs." 
</P>
<P>
Arianespace began its business in 1980 by competing with the U.S. space shuttle 
and had the market virtually to itself after the Challenger accident grounded 
the American-satellite launching business. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its current leadership position, Arianespace has the most to lose of 
any of the rocket makers from increasing competition in the market. Unlike its 
American competitors, which have large military launch contracts, Arianespace 
is totally dependent on commercial business. The French-based company produces 
rockets that compete with all three U.S. producers. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lost business to all three of the U.S. companies," Heydon said. "We've 
also lost to (China). But that's part of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Arianespace's biggest problem, Heydon said, is the weakened condition of the 
U.S. dollar. He said the cost of the Ariane to U.S. customers has risen 70% in 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
But both European and American rocket makers share a bad case of pre-launch 
jitters about the potential competition from China and the Soviet Union. 
Analysts say the Chinese and Soviets are likely to heavily subsidize their 
launch businesses in order to gain international prestige and foreign currency. 
</P>
<P>
"The introduction of the Chinese Long March (rocket) and, ultimately, the 
Soviet Proton will serve to make the market more unpleasant," Heydon said. "I 
don't think there is adequate business to support all these people in the 
commercial business." 
</P>
<P>
Industry executives were upset with the Reagan Administration's decision last 
fall to relax export restrictions and allow China to launch three Hughes 
Aircraft satellites aboard the Long March. In January, China signed its first 
commercial contract to launch a Western-built satellite -- a $30-million deal 
for a 1990 launch of the telecommunications satellite Asiasat 1. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very disappointed in the Administration's decision to allow the 
Chinese to enter the market," said General Dynamics' Dunbar. "It contradicts 
the government's objective of having a strong domestic rocket industry." 
</P>
<P>
Under the U.S.-China trade agreement signed in January, the Chinese are limited 
to nine launches during the next six years and are supposed to offer their 
services for prices comparable to those of Western companies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Soviet Effort Stymied 
</P>
<P>
But Western executives complain that the Chinese are already violating the 
trade accord. One industry executive said they recently won a launch contract 
with Aussat, the Australian satellite authority, by bidding less than one-third 
the price of its Western rivals. 
</P>
<P>
John M. Logsdon, director of George Washington University's Space Policy 
Institute, believes that the Chinese will play a role in the commercial market. 
"But the notion that they'll take a significant market share from the United 
States and Europe is not very plausible" because of restrictions limiting the 
number of Chinese launches. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Soviets have been actively marketing their Proton rocket for about 
two years, they have been stymied by U.S. law that prohibits Soviet launches of 
satellites with American technology. Virtually all satellites launched outside 
the Soviet Bloc incorporate American technology. 
</P>
<P>
"If there are no constraints placed on the Chinese or Soviets, we won't be in 
the commercial launch business," said Roger Chamberlin, vice president in 
charge of Martin Marietta's commercial Titan program. "We have no desire to 
sell vehicles at a loss." 
</P>
<P>
But industry observers say other nations eventually will be able to develop 
satellites without the benefit of American technology. In order to break into 
the commercial market, the Soviets may provide technical assistance to nations 
that want to develop a satellite business, said William B. Wirin, vice 
president of Space Commerce, a two-year-old Houston company formed as a joint 
venture with the Soviets to market the Proton. 
</P>
<P>
"We will go to countries that want to develop satellites and help them do so," 
said Wirin, a former chief attorney for the U.S. Air Force Space Command. "We 
will look to the Third World countries and try to help them lower their cost of 
launches. If you bring down the cost of communications, you will create a 
requirement for many more launches." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets believe that they can market the Proton to developing nations at 
half the world market price, Wirin said, "and still make a handsome profit." 
</P>
<P>
Still another potential competitor, Japan, is expected to make its move into 
the commercial business in the early 1990s. Under a license agreement with the 
U.S. government, the Japanese acquired technology used in McDonnell Douglas' 
Delta rocket and have been developing a launch system called the H-2. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese are not saying much publicly, but it is obviously their intent to 
be a major player in the space transport game," said an official with the 
Office of Space Commerce, a Commerce Department agency. Industry observers say 
the Japanese have improved upon the Delta's second-stage engine -- the 
mid-stage engine that puts the satellite into an elliptical orbit. McDonnell 
Douglas is now mulling the possibility of obtaining the enhanced booster 
technology under license from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
All three U.S. rockets, the McDonnell Douglas Delta, General Dynamics Atlas and 
Martin Marietta Titan, are descendants of ballistic missiles developed in the 
1950s and 1960s. They have been modified at various times throughout the years 
for different missions. 
</P>
<P>
After a two-and-a-half-year shutdown, McDonnell Douglas Space Systems of 
Huntington Beach reopened its Delta production line in January, 1987. The 
contract that put the Delta back in business was a military rather than 
commercial order. The company received an Air Force order valued at nearly $1 
billion to build 20 Deltas for launching military satellites that would have 
gone up on the space shuttle had it not been for the Challenger accident. 
</P>
<P>
On the commercial side, McDonnell Douglas has nine orders for its Delta rockets 
valued at $500 million. The company's first launch in May will carry a 
communications satellite for the government of India. 
</P>
<P>
General Dynamics Space Systems in San Diego, manufacturer of the Atlas launch 
vehicle, has four firm commercial orders. The first launch will be early next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Marietta Commercial Titan Systems in Denver has five contracts for 
launches of its Titan rocket, with a value of $500 million. Its first launch is 
scheduled for the third quarter of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The three rocket makers generally compete for different pieces of the market 
because their launchers vary in the size of payloads they can carry into space. 
The Titan rocket, the largest of the three launchers, is capable of lifting 
more than 11,000 pounds into geosynchronous transfer orbit -- which is where 
most communications satellites are placed. General Dynamics' Atlas, with a lift 
capability of 6,000 pounds, is next in size, and the Delta is the smallest with 
a maximum payload of 4,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Some doubt that the commercial market can support three U.S. rocket makers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Military Contracts Crucial 
</P>
<P>
None of the three would be seriously hurt if it were squeezed out of the 
commercial market. McDonnell Douglas, General Dynamics and Martin Marietta are 
all major aerospace and defense contractors with substantial resources. 
Moreover, the American companies have large government contracts to launch 
satellites for the military and other federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department has on order 37 Titan, 20 Delta and 11 Atlas rockets. 
Those contracts have a total value of about $6.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the American rocket makers say they would like to recoup their 
investments in the commercial market, which total about $500 million among the 
three companies.

Pike, the Federation of American Scientists analyst, said increasing 
competition in the market may make it difficult for the U.S. firms to earn a 
profit. He argues that there is insufficient business to support three U.S. 
rocket makers and that without military contracts one or more of the firms 
would probably be out of the business. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. General Dynamics, for example, probably could not compete in the 
commercial business had it not won the Air Force business, he said. Last year, 
the company won Air Force contracts valued at $171 million for three Atlas 
rockets, with options for eight additional rockets. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that decision was taken simply for keeping General Dynamics in the 
rocket business," Pike said. "The rational decision would have been to keep the 
Delta and Titan and tell the Atlas to go to the Smithsonian."

ENGINEERS PUT HEARTS, SOULS INTO ROCKETS

<P>
When McDonnell Douglas' space business slumped in the mid-1970s, rocket 
engineer Casey Patelski found himself without a launch to look forward to for 
the first time in two decades. 
</P>
<P>
He also found himself without a job. 
</P>
<P>
Patelski was one of thousands of McDonnell Douglas employees in Huntington 
Beach who were laid off when the company's Apollo and Skylab programs drew to a 
close. 
</P>
<P>
Patelski quickly found a job with Fluor Corp. building oil refineries in Saudi 
Arabia and gas pipelines in Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
Though he found that work interesting, Patelski says he jumped at the chance to 
return to the rocket business in 1987 when McDonnell Douglas asked him back to 
work on its Delta rocket program. The program had been newly revived because 
the government's space shuttle was barred from launches of commercial 
satellites in the wake of the 1986 Challenger space shuttle disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Patelski was joined by dozens of other former McDonnell Douglas engineers who 
had been laid off in the 1970s. "We all had space in our blood," Patelski, 60, 
said in a recent interview. "So, when there was an opportunity to come back, I 
came back." 
</P>
<P>
Patelski was part of a small group of about 20 scientists and engineers who 
worked on the original Delta rocket program in 1960. McDonnell Douglas had 
received a National Aeronautics and Space Administration contract to develop 
the first satellite launch vehicle. The satellite was to launch an 
experimental, 150-pound inflatable balloon called the Echo to study how radio 
signals could be sent and received by bouncing them off an object in space. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very challenging work because there was no one who had any experience 
launching satellites," Patelski said. "We were all in our 20s and 30s. We were 
so young, and we just felt it was a real technical challenge to design the 
thing and get a satellite into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
"To get a satellite to stay in a stationary orbit, you must first get it over 
the Equator. The objective is to get the correct speed, velocity and engine 
cutoff all at the proper time," Patelski said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Piece of the Action' 
</P>
<P>
The first launch failed when the Echo balloon did not properly inflate. The 
second launch was a success. 
</P>
<P>
The Delta rocket technology that Patelski and the others worked on had its 
origins in the German V-2 program of World War II and was brought to the United 
States by a group of German scientists after the war. The technology was used 
for the Thor ballistic missile in the late 1950s and early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the Delta has been scheduled to be phased out several times. In 
mid-1984, the Delta production line was shut down for 2 1/2 years. It was 
reopened in January, 1987, after McDonnell Douglas was awarded a large Air 
Force contract. 
</P>
<P>
Patelski, a Costa Mesa resident who through the years has watched more than 25 
Delta launches, is glad to see the Delta back in business because "it gives you 
a feeling that the space program is back on its feet." 
</P>
<P>
"The esprit de corps is different with a rocket," Patelski said. "You each have 
a piece of the action. That's your little valve or your little transistor in 
there. Each person feels that part of the rocket is his or hers."

STATE'S TOP FRANCHISE CLEANS UP ON RUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Some of California's top-ranking franchises have prospered by selling 
affordable businesses reflecting the California life style -- real estate and 
fitness. But at the top of the list is something a little more mundane: clean 
carpets. 
</P>
<P>
Chem-Dry Carpet Cleaning, Century 21 Real Estate and Jazzercise lead the list 
of California firms on Entrepreneur magazine's list of top 100 franchisers in 
1988. The magazine ranks franchisers based on years in business, start-up costs 
and growth. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Harris, founder and president of Chem-Dry; Richard J.Loughlin, president 
and chief executive of Century 21, and Judi Sheppard Missett, founder, 
president and choreographer of Jazzercise, have all created strong, supportive 
franchising companies, according to franchise industry experts. 
</P>
<P>
All three offer affordable franchises. Jazzercise is the cheapest, charging 
$500 each. Century 21 charges between $12,000 to $25,000, depending on the 
region. Chem-Dry, which features a carbonated cleaning process, sells 
franchises for $9,400 to $13,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
And no formal complaints are pending against the companies by state officials, 
according to the Department of Corporations' enforcement staff. 
</P>
<P>
Each of three is headed by an individual who has built it from scratch and 
watched it prosper. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Has 2,000 Franchises 
</P>
<P>
"I had no intention of starting a carpet cleaning business," said Robert 
Harris, who began cleaning carpets in 1977 to put himself through Brigham Young 
University. When the business began to grow, Harris left law school to devote 
all his time to the company. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Chem-Dry, based in Cameron Park near Sacramento, has about 2,000 
franchises worldwide. Until 3 1/2 years ago, the company did not advertise at 
all, relying on word-of-mouth recommendations to sell virtually every new 
franchise, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
Chem-Dry features a carbonated cleaning process. "We are typically the most 
expensive carpet cleaners," said Harris. "We are not cut rate, and we have the 
reputation of being the quality one." 
</P>
<P>
The privately held company reported $12 million in sales and $6 million in 
profit last year. Harris said Chem-Dry generates 64% of its profit by selling 
cleaning products and equipment to franchisees. One reason for Chem-Dry's 
financial success is that it manufactures all its own products. 
</P>
<P>
"Our chemistry department develops the products," Harris said. "We do 
everything ourselves and cut out the middle men." 
</P>
<P>
Harris said the next big step is to sell cleaning products directly to 
customers. "Our people are in 10,000 homes every day and we already have 
credibility," he said. The first Chem-Dry consumer product will be a 
concentrated laundry detergent called "Dirt Wrangler." While Harris' 
franchisees are busy cleaning carpets, Richard Loughlin's 7,000 franchisees are 
busy selling houses around the world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$60 Billion in Deals 
</P>
<P>
"The concept of regionalization in franchising was virtually unheard of when we 
came into it in 1971," said Loughlin. "Our primarily clients are the people who 
run the regions. This keeps the management at a very local level." 
</P>
<P>
Based in Irvine, Century 21 divides the country into 25 regions and has 6,200 
franchises in the United States alone. In 1988, its agents participated in more 
than $60 billion worth of real estate transactions and earned $2.4 billion in 
commissions. The company, which is owned by Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., 
posted $126 million in revenue and $35 million pretax profit for 1988, Loughlin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After working for several real estate trade associations, Loughlin joined 
Century 21 in 1972 and purchased the Northern California region. He headed the 
region until 1981, when he sold it back to the parent company with plans to buy 
another business. But he said he was pleased to serve as president of the 
company when Century 21 asked him. 
</P>
<P>
Loughlin, who spends about a quarter of his time visiting the regions and 
dealing with regional managers, said he supports the Federal Trade Commission's 
proposal to streamline and unify the regulations covering franchising. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy to see federal control," he said. "Now each state is different. 
Every time the state administration changes, the franchise law changes, and it 
creates a tremendous amount of extra work." 
</P>
<P>
California's No. 3 ranked franchise is Jazzercise. The company, founded by 
dancer Judi Sheppard Missett, ranked 15th in the country and was first among 
fitness businesses, according to Entrepreneur magazine's 1988 franchise survey. 
</P>
<P>
Jazzercise founder and President Judi Sheppard Missett was in Japan last week 
and was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
With a $500 franchise fee, Jazzercise makes most of its money by charging a 20% 
royalty fee. The royalty is high compared to the average royalties of 5% to 8% 
charged by other franchisers, according to franchise consultant Ed Kushell. But 
Kushell and others said the low franchisee fee makes the business an attractive 
one. Franchisees provide their own space for classes. Every two months, they 
receive videotapes with two dozen new dance routines developed by Missett. 
</P>
<P>
Missett, a professional jazz dancer, started teaching classes in Evanston, Ill. 
in 1969. Concerned about the high drop-out rate among adult dance students, she 
created a blend of jazz dance routines and aerobic exercise to keep the 
students' interest. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, she moved to San Diego County and formally launched the company. 
Jazzercise's worldwide franchises gross $40 million a year and trains and 
supports 3,900 instructors, according to a company spokeswoman. With 400,000 
students worldwide, the company believes Jazzercise is the world's most widely 
taught fitness program.

PROMOTE GROWTH BY CUTTING FRESH FLOWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Summer is the best time to sit back and relax outdoors, but it's the worst time 
to neglect your yard and garden. Here's how to keep your annuals blooming. 
</P>
<P>
Deadheading: To ensure color until frost, remove blooms from your annuals as 
soon as they fade. This simple procedure, called deadheading, ensures maximum 
and continuous blooming all summer. You can also promote growth by regularly 
cutting fresh flowers for indoor bouquets. 
</P>
<P>
Shearing back: Many annuals need rejuvenating in midsummer. To encourage fresh 
growth and more flowers, cut the stems back by one-third with pruning shears. 
</P>
<P>
Pinching back. Tall, leggy stems are a common malady of such annuals as 
petunia, geranium, browallia, begonia and impatiens. 
</P>
<P>
Keep them bushy and blooming by pinching back stems just above a set of leaves. 
This will stimulate new side branching and flower formation within a couple of 
weeks.

HANDICAPPING THE WINNERS: A REVIEW OF THE BEST ACTOR/BEST ACTRESS NOMINEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE CHRISTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George C. Scott once mentioned that having all the actor and actress nominees 
play the same role in an Oscar race would be the only way to determine who'd be 
best at it. 
</P>
<P>
In principle, he's right. Actors are only empowered to play parts in settings 
of larger intent. Does that mean Meryl Streep should be penalized because Fred 
Schepisi's purpose in "A Cry in the Dark" was to expose an entire society swept 
up in a firestorm of vicious gossip while, in "Dangerous Liaisons," director 
Stephen Frears and writer-producer Christopher Hampton focused more on 
individual character? Yes it does, unless there are enough Meryl militants out 
there to stuff the ballot boxes in favor of their diva. 
</P>
<P>
That having been dutifully said, it's time to shoulder our way in with the rest 
of the handicapping rabble for the only game in town this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
Three things separate the great from the good in acting: technique (which is 
invisible when it's really working), the capacity to project more than one 
quality or emotion at the same time, and the ability to convey thought. Dustin 
Hoffman shows the first in "Rain Man," Jodie Foster the second in "The 
Accused," and Glenn Close the third in "Dangerous Liaisons," all to an 
extraordinary degree. That's why they're Oscar front-runners for best actor and 
actress. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman made some shrewd moves before he ever stepped in front of "Rain Man's" 
camera, but his most calculated was in re-conceiving some ideas about 
performance. Actors don't always get stuck in habits that become mannerisms 
because they're lazy; they can get tied up because they see a problem the same 
way over and over again. That's why Paul Newman or Al Pacino, for example, tend 
to play grief or anger the same way in different movies -- the emotional cue 
never changes. 
</P>
<P>
For "Rain Man," the story of an imported-car dealer named Charlie Babbit (Tom 
Cruise) who kidnaps his older brother (Hoffman), an autistic savant, in order 
to break into his $3-million trust, Hoffman studied a number of savants (people 
who have brilliant mental capacities in tandem with their retardation). He 
needed to come up with a behavioral pattern that was both true to his subject 
yet busy enough to hold an impenetrable character in living space. 
</P>
<P>
In effect, it meant re-thinking every normal acting response, the vocabulary of 
gesture one builds up over the years, and finding a plausible way to keep an 
audience engaged with a fundamentally disconnected character. The savant 
challenges our notions of personality. His compulsive repetitions are an answer 
to terror, and whether or not the disorder is purely biological, he reminds us 
that our notion of reality is at bottom no more than an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"Rain Man" isn't interested in any philosophical speculations on the notion of 
personality. Basically, as Martin Brest said (he's one of the directors who 
preceded Barry Levinson on the job), it's more "a story of two schmucks driving 
West" that comes to a predictable if ambiguous end. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman's folded-in, metronomic performance braced the movie's over-easy 
emotions. Every device he used -- the tight bird-like walk, the explosive 
panics, the zonked-out face with its stone blank eyes that only flickered when 
counting, the "uh-oh" two-note expression of dismay when something threatened 
an inviolate routine -- added expressive notes to busy the surface of a 
character so intractable that he was hardly a character at all. Nor was he a 
hopeless case. We saw that someone locked so deep into a black hole of solitude 
could now and then generate a gleam of new light. 
</P>
<P>
That, and the absolute rigor of Hoffman's performance were what gave "Rain Man" 
its edge. One of the movie's big scenes is when Charlie gets himself and his 
brother duded up to make a run at the Las Vegas tables, where they win $80,000. 
One of Hoffman's earlier models for his role, a Salt Lake City man of 
exceptional gifts (even for a savant), was once invited to gamble in Reno and 
refused, saying he thought gambling was immoral. To portray a moral dimension 
at play beneath the light and shadow of such an ungraspable character -- that 
would have been the real challenge. The movie took the easy way out, but 
Hoffman still gave a great technical performance. 
</P>
<P>
"Dangerous Liaisons" begins and ends with a close-up on a face -- that of Glenn 
Close's Marquise de Merteuil -- and therein lies the tale. The setting is the 
ancient regime at its most sumptuous and overripe, and the face the marquise 
first contemplates for us in her mirror is poised, pampered, ironic, and 
immensely pleased with itself. 
</P>
<P>
The marquise is a consummate sexual tactician who, spurned by her lover, 
enlists the Vicomte de Valmont (John Malkovich), a rake of no small talents 
himself (he looks at women like a lepidopterist fingering his pin), to exact an 
exquisitely plotted revenge -- Valmont will deflower the lover's convent-bred 
fiancee. 
</P>
<P>
The marquise possesses the kind of monumental pride in which every pain and 
slight she's ever suffered has been permanently chipped. "Liaisons" openly 
gives us her rationale when she tells Valmont: "I was born to dominate your sex 
and avenge my own. I learned detachment. I became a virtuoso of deceit. In the 
end I distilled everything to one principle: Win or die." She consoles the 
fallen virgin with a bit of incalculable bitterness drawn like a smelling salt 
from her silken past: "You'll find the shame is like the pain. You only feel it 
once." 
</P>
<P>
There is no point at which Close is out of touch with the marquise's capacity 
for feline Mandarin intrigue, even while the messy implications of love and 
death swell around her like a bloodstain on a carpet. We see it in the way she 
plays Valmont, turning ever so slightly away from his profferred kiss, 
bemusedly trailing innuendo and seductive promise behind her like the smell of 
perfume. The angle of her jaw is majestically uptilted. Her fond eyes don't 
miss a trick. 
</P>
<P>
At a vocal recital she catches the way Valmont looks at Madame de Tourvel 
(Michelle Pfeiffer), a woman who had interested him at first only as a 
challenge. In an instant she understands how much he loves her. When the 
marquise offers her cheek for a genteel kiss, a small adjustment in the eyes 
tells us how much she loves him, or wants to possess him, which may in her mind 
amount to the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, Close's performance is suavely in keeping with "Dangerous 
Liaison's" elegant ambiance and literate dialogue. But most of what we see 
going on inside of the marquise is owed to her wordless expressiveness. And she 
gets to play the sine qua non of any best-actress performance, the enraged 
trashing of a dressing room. When, at the end, she angrily strips her face of 
not only its makeup but its affectation, we see the sour, pulpy mask of a 
harridan. In an instant she's transformed into a ruin. 
</P>
<P>
That Malkovich, who is every bit her equal in this movie, wasn't nominated for 
anything, is one of the more egregious examples of the academy's capacity for 
dumb logic, which in this case is no logic at all. 
</P>
<P>
Jodie Foster single-handedly raises "The Accused" from a movie-of-the-week 
banality into something far more compelling -- at least for as long as she's on 
the screen. She plays Sarah, a young fast-food waitress in a Pacific Northwest 
town who's spinning her wheels toward a dead-end life, a crusty, hard-drinking 
woman who may not have made it out of high school and for whom any amenity, and 
any degree of real affection, is taken in meager scraps. You can almost smell 
the cigarette smoke in her lank hair. 
</P>
<P>
That she's a bit of a hard case makes her a dubious witness for her own defense 
after she's been gang-raped in a roadside saloon. The rapists have been 
arrested, but the law has nodded to their plea bargains and turned indifferent 
toward her. 
</P>
<P>
Foster gives us three Sarahs: a raucous, sensual good-time girl before the 
rape; a frightened, wounded, combative animal afterwards for as long as the 
state keeps her filed away; and finally, a woman who's been struggling for a 
kind of decency all along and sees the effort redeemed. 
</P>
<P>
Foster's Sarah is a woman who's out for revenge not just for revenge's sake 
(which a lesser artist would have been satisfied doing) but because the rape, 
and her treatment at the hands of all those people who were supposed to aid her 
and prosecute her case -- in a word, society -- threaten to trash her fragile 
self-esteem. The case brings into focus something she's been trying to clarify 
for a long time -- she doesn't want to be any kind of victim. 
</P>
<P>
Foster's defensively hunched shoulders, her defiant, embittered mouth, her 
startled, almost feral eyes are only some of the many tense and articulate 
expressions she brings to a character capable of great rage and a guarded 
tenderness. And there isn't an ounce of self-pity in the performance. 
</P>
<P>
In one scene she's seated at a small table with the district attorney (Kelly 
McGillis) who has been handling her case. All she has to offer in her gratitude 
is a home-made horoscope chart, which she believes in but knows the attorney 
thinks is ridiculous. As she offers it her body tightens, anticipating a 
rebuke, and her face looks hopeful, eager, taut and defensive all at once. A 
very young person's naked face peering through a crust. It's an eloquent 
expression of someone risking a wound in the desire for a trust, and you 
understand why McGillis won't turn her away. That would be criminal. 
</P>
<P>
This is the year of the performer inasmuch as most of the nominees have turned 
in truly first-rate work, but for a variety of reasons the rest of the pack 
will probably follow in the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Edward James Olmos in "Stand and Deliver," Sigourney Weaver in "Gorillas in the 
Mist" and Meryl Streep in "A Cry in the Dark" face a common dilemma: Each of 
these movies is about real people. Perhaps from fear of lawsuits, or of 
offending relatives, or, for that matter, the living subject, true-story movies 
tend to return shallow characters. It's as though history offers a sparse 
backlight where fiction frees the artist to jiggle what spotlights he needs to 
probe the heart of a matter. 
</P>
<P>
Or else character is incidental to another concern. In his sunken-chested 
pedagogical shuffle (reminiscent of a younger Andres Segovia), alert humor, and 
heavy man-with-a-mission single-mindedness, Olmos' portrayal of Jaime Escalante 
is vivid and supple (Escalante is the math teacher who taught calculus to 
Garfield High students when nobody thought it could be done). And he plays the 
best heart attack scene since Oscar Werner crumpled to the deck in "Ship of 
Fools" (Olmos' body seizes up in sections as its center collapses). But "Stand 
and Deliver" is a heroic civics lesson movie in which roles are conceived as 
symbols, either of uplift or of uplift's Lex Luthor detractors. 
</P>
<P>
So, in its way, is "Gorillas in the Mist," the movie about how Sigourney Weaver 
as Dian Fossey saved the day for the Central African mountain gorilla at the 
expense of her life. Sigourney's scenes with the gorillas have an engaging, 
almost rapt intimacy, and her great physical presence always holds the eye. 
Statuesque might be a better word, as it implies the absence of a psychological 
interior that extends beyond compulsion and becomes shrouded here in the 
incense of movie martyrdom. 
</P>
<P>
Streep has never been subtler and more complete than she is in her role as 
Lindy Chamberlain in "A Cry in the Dark," the story of the Australian mother 
and wife of a Seventh-Day Adventist minister whose 9-week-old baby was carried 
away by a dingo while they were on a camping trip. The 1980 incident became a 
phenomenal magnet for Australia's tabloid-fed blood-lust for gossip, the kind 
of tragedy that in this country could be blown into an instant media 
conflagration too if conditions were right, say on a slow news day. 
</P>
<P>
Streep's Chamberlain is an even-tempered, good-natured, somewhat dowdy woman of 
remarkable patience and reserve who digs into a prideful and angry silence as 
the lynch-mob frenzy gathers around her. As the outcry over her case guaranteed 
a murder charge and conviction, you began to think of Meursault in Camus' "The 
Stranger," whose pride was in resisting "the imprecations of the mob." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately (for the performance), "A Cry in the Dark's" preoccupation is 
with the question of how an ostensibly civilized modern society can become so 
ravenous and unhinged, and how ordinary lives can be ruined by mercilessly 
capricious news media. We're deprived of the one or two scenes, after she's 
been forsaken by everyone (including her husband), that could have left us 
alone with her for a few memorable minutes. Maybe their absence is director and 
co-writer Fred Schepisi's way of saying enough is enough. A note at the end 
tells us she was finally acquitted in September of 1987 and that the 
Chamberlains are still in the process of restoring their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Of the remaining performances, Max von Sydow offers a quietly heart-rending 
portrayal of a timorous, self-effacing widower who emigrates to Denmark with 
his young son in "Pelle the Conqueror." Von Sydow is a stable hand on an awful 
brutish estate aptly named Stone Farm. What his son Pelle will one day conquer 
is the New World -- America. Von Sydow's performance is the opposite of 
sentimental and declamatory, but the muck on his diffident ruddy face does 
nothing to obscure the glow of tribute to parents who drove themselves to death 
for the future of their children. "Pelle the Conqueror" is a rough Millet-like 
pastorale. The academy almost never awards a performance that lacks a Big 
Scene. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Hanks' faun-like head and his rare penchant for slapstick serve him well in 
"Big." He abandons himself to the world of childhood with amazing dexterity, 
showing us a kid's floppy coordination, his capacity for boneless languor, his 
goofy, enthusiastic outbursts and his wariness in the face of adults. "Big" is 
well acted by everyone in it, but the shotgun marriage between naturalism and 
the Peter Pan principle doesn't quite take. No chance. Besides, Hanks' role in 
"Punchline" showed a potential for genius, which means he'll be up again 
sometime. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Hackman's prophetic grin through the early part of "Mississippi Burning" 
almost insures that at some point his good 'ol boy mask will be ripped off and 
Popeye the Avenger will once again emerge. Hackman is one of our great actors 
and is as thoughtful as he can be here, but he has little to work with in this 
self-righteous movie, with its distorted view of the civil rights movement and 
its leering fixation on violence. 
</P>
<P>
Melanie Griffith is the one performer whose nomination, for "Working Girl," is 
based on pure likability. With a wispy nymphet voice and sleepy demeanor, she 
plays the role like an afterthought. She's this year's Sally Field, without the 
spunk. 
</P>
<P>
Who'll win? If you haven't already guessed, the bet here is on Hoffman and 
Close.

WRITER-ACTOR BRUCE VILANCH IS THE COMIC PRESENCE BEHIND THE 'LINES' FROM THE 
PODIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
For Bruce Vilanch, it's glamour, glamour, glamour. So much glamour, so little 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Glamour is his life. At the moment, anyway. At least since December, when he 
started writing the 61st Academy Awards show, to the world the apotheosis of 
glamour. 
</P>
<P>
But with Hollywood glamour, what you see isn't what's always there. 
</P>
<P>
ABC's Oscar office off La Cienega and Santa Monica boulevards is a labyrinth of 
starkly white rooms on the second floor, above Adolescent Outreach and below 
Advance Memory. Next-door neighbors are Total Tan and Leo's Flowers. Out of his 
office window, Vilanch can regard a vision of tar-paper roofs. 
</P>
<P>
His room is identified "Miss Grable's Dressing Room," with a still of The Legs. 
</P>
<P>
This man of glamour sits lonesome at his computer keyboard ingesting the real 
writer's regimen of Diet Coke and taco chips. At appropriate hours he watches 
"Santa Barbara" on a tiny desk TV. 
</P>
<P>
Vilanch is a familiar image to the Hollywood comedy community -- sort of squat, 
Muppet look, with a substantial beard and a shag of blond hair. He is a robust 
comic presence that is constantly self-defacing: "This is Farrah Fawcett's old 
hair." 
</P>
<P>
(Oscar show producer Allan Carr affirms that this is Vilanch's real hair color: 
"I walked by the other day and looked at his roots. I said: 'You know that 
Candy Bergen must spend $20,000 a year to get her hair this color?' ") 
</P>
<P>
And Vilanch has on his signature T-shirt. He has a collection of T-shirts and 
is invariably never seen out and around but in a T-shirt. On this day it was a 
purple "NEW YAWK," with a red big apple with a chomp out ot it. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the elegant designer Bob Mackie made one for him and he wears it in 
his comedy act: "It's black and got plunging cleavage that's built in and long 
sleeves with rhinestones," as Vilanch describes it. "I say: 'I'm so thrilled 
that Bob made this for me. It's my very own. But as soon as I'm done tonight it 
goes right back to Brenda Vaccaro.' 
</P>
<P>
"But I have a T-shirt underneath that says in very large letters, 'Yes, I'm a 
model.' Because it's my second most-asked question." 
</P>
<P>
Producer Carr wanted everything this year "crafted" for the stars, Vilanch 
related. "It's possible to write just a great generic mass of material, just 
hand it to the performer and say: 'OK, you get to do the speech about film is 
the universal language,' and 'You get to do the speech about how music in 
movies underscores our emotions. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
Said Carr: "He wants the performers to sound the way they sound, so they don't 
come to rehearsal and go, 'What is this? What are these words? I never saw this 
before. I can't pronounce that. . . . ' " 
</P>
<P>
And, dispensing with the tradition of a team of four or five writers for the 
show, Carr hired only Vilanch: "Other years they didn't have people who were 
compatible and it always looked disjointed." 
</P>
<P>
(Carr said he hired Vilanch because "he makes me look thin. That's the real 
reason.") 
</P>
<P>
But the process this year, especially with the additional volume of presenters 
coming and going on the stage, became "gargantuan, physically, humanly 
impossible," Carr said. 
</P>
<P>
Much "baby-sitting" and "ego massaging" is required by the nature of stardom. 
And there are a lot of helpful suggestions -- or not helpful. Vilanch related: 
"Yesterday somebody called to say that they'd like Fay Wray to sit there 
holding her new book -- because it would be a nice plug. Then I thought, what 
if everybody came on holding their books? Jane Fonda wouldn't be able to make 
it up the stairs if she were holding all her videos!" 
</P>
<P>
Carr explained: "It was basically my fault. Because of the time element and all 
the filler stuff -- I forgot that you have to write all the voiceover lines and 
the station breaks. . . . Bruce and I don't do that. We just sit around being 
funny." 
</P>
<P>
So the other day, barely two weeks before the show, Carr brought Hildy Parks to 
the rescue. She's a celebrated New York writer who with husband Alexander 
Cohen, a major Broadway producer, effectively elevated the Tony Awards show 
from just another listing in the TV logs to the top of the highlights. 
</P>
<P>
Carr began boasting: "I've created a new Edna Ferber and Moss Hart. It's 
divine." 
</P>
<P>
Much of Vilanch's employment has been spent in negotiations over his lines, a 
not-unfamiliar Hollywood endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had to deal with a lot of middlemen -- and a lot of people who are afraid 
to give their clients the material. You wind up saying, 'If they hate it, it's 
OK. But I want them to see it.' I had a publicist actually call me and say: 'I 
can't send this to her (the client) because he (the other star) has more 
lines.' 
</P>
<P>
"I said: 'So she's not gonna shoot you; blame me. And point out to her that he 
may have the lines but she has the big joke." 
</P>
<P>
He lost some double entendres in the Dudley Moore-Bo Derek script: "They were 
doing the costume category and it seemed like a great place to do jokes about 
the fact that they didn't wear anything in their big movie ("10"). Dudley loved 
it but she was a little skittish. She didn't want to say some things." 
</P>
<P>
At this sitting it wasn't clear what was happening with the Goldie Hawn-Kurt 
Russell script: "We lost this cute thing that Goldie didn't want to do. Then 
she changed her mind. It was kind of giggly and she would like to be not Giggly 
Goldie. She wants to be Irene Dunne." 
</P>
<P>
One day he got a call from Auschwitz, Poland, where Willem Dafoe and Edward 
James Olmos are making a death-camp film, "Triumph of the Spirit." 
</P>
<P>
"They (the movie representative) said that they were coming over to be 
presenters and they both shaved their heads for the movie, and it would be nice 
if you explained why they look like this. 
</P>
<P>
"The call itself isn't so noteworthy, except that I've never gotten a call from 
Auschwitz before. I was unaware that Auschwitz had a switchboard or direct 
dialing -- and it's very eerie when the secretary buzzes you and says, 
'Auschwitz on Line 2.' " 
</P>
<P>
Vilanch came to show biz as a tot as a child actor. Then Ohio State and the 
Chicago Tribune: "I was every kind of critic. I was the TV critic, the movie 
critic, the nightclub critic, the rock critic. . . . I was the wipe-up critic." 
</P>
<P>
One night the then-unknown Bette Midler arrived from New York to do her 
then-unknown act. "She was opening for Jackie Vernon, to an audience of people 
who looked like Jackie Vernon." 
</P>
<P>
He did the interview and both decided that the other was funny. He advised her 
to localize part of her act and began calling TV critics whom he knew for local 
joke ideas: "There was always some kind of local political buffoon and always a 
Virginia Graham type who ran a talk show." 
</P>
<P>
Through Midler he caught on with the Manhattan Transfer troupe and helped put 
together their act, which in turned helped land them get a summer series on 
CBS. 
</P>
<P>
So Vilanch moved West in 1975 to work on a variety of variety shows, including 
"The Donny and Marie Show." He won Emmys for Midler and Barry Manilow specials 
and has an enormous list of writing credits. 
</P>
<P>
Plus acting roles (like "Mahagony," "The Ice Pirates," "The Morning After," 
etc.). He's up for the lead in a TV pilot, reports his agent. 
</P>
<P>
"I do a lot of benefits," Vilanch said. "My company is Benefits R Us." 
</P>
<P>
He helps write probably most AIDS shows in Los Angeles: "I'll do any AIDS 
benefits." He also is writing (with Alan and Marilyn Bergman) Saturday's Steven 
Spielberg tribute being put on by American Cinematheque. 
</P>
<P>
He's co-writing (with Jeff Silverman) a comedy feature film based on the board 
game Monopoly for NBC Productions. 
</P>
<P>
He has a rep as a sought-after "script doctor," that most mysterious of 
Hollywood callings. These unheralded ghost writers liven up a character or 
insert a few jokes or twist around a scene or two: "I can't say what those 
movies are because I'm not credited . . . but it's not the newest work in the 
world. It's perhaps the third oldest profession." 
</P>
<P>
So, turning 40 (a year ago), he decided to try expanding his horizons with a 
"sit-down" act that he does on occasion at the Gardenia, the Art-Decorian club. 
He describes his life on "Donny and Marie" and "The Brady Bunch" shows and his 
other lives and times and talks some show tunes. He's not sure where this will 
all end up. 
</P>
<P>
His ambition: "I'd prefer to write Woody Allen movies from now on." 
</P>
<P>
The job, of course, is already taken. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, one loves to bask in the glory. When one has no glory to bask in, then 
you just settle for the work."

CLEAR THE STAGE FOR 1990; 
</P>
<P>
PREDICTING SOME OF THE PROBABLE CONTENDERS -- AND THE MOVIES HAVEN'T BEEN 
RELEASED YET

If "Rain Man" has taken the suspense out of Wednesday's Academy Awards for you, 
if the only mysteries remaining are whether Dustin Hoffman will make his 
acceptance speech in character and producer Allan Carr will bring the show to a 
close before the bars close in Boston, here's something to consider: There are 
only 368 days until the 1990 awards are presented. 
</P>
<P>
What better time to begin sorting through the contenders than before the films 
have been shown to anyone, before some of them have been made, or even cast, 
before the publicity mills grind and critics compose the praise that will fuel 
next winter's long Oscar race? 
</P>
<P>
Go ahead, pick a winner. Say it -- "For best performance by an actor in a 
leading role . . . Marlon Brando in 'A Dry White Season"' -- and see how smart 
and right it feels before anyone has had a chance to write it off. 
</P>
<P>
Predicting next year's nominees is not the strain it seems. By following some 
simple rules, you can eliminate all but a handful of films from contention. 
First, you dismiss the B genre chaff -- action, horror and teen-age sex/slob 
comedies, anything with the word Ninja in the title. Then you concentrate on 
those films set to be released near the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Only five times since the Eisenhower Administration has a film released before 
July won the best picture Oscar. The last first-half winner was "Annie Hall," 
an April 1977 release. When a major studio sets a serious movie for release 
between September and the end of the year, it can be taken as a declared 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, with apologies to Lt. Renault in "Casablanca," you round up the usual 
suspects. Which previously honored "serious" stars and star directors have work 
coming out this year? Nicholson, Hoffman, Newman? Streep, Fonda, Winger? 
Forman, Allen, Jewison? 
</P>
<P>
This is more practical than it is cynical. The serious stars and star directors 
get the pick of the litter of serious screenplays, the plum roles and the juicy 
themes. Good scripts are often undermined in the process of accommodating the 
directors, stars, producers and studios first drawn to them (which accounts for 
so many bad movies made by so many talented people), but Oscar ambitions always 
start with the writing. 
</P>
<P>
The major studios don't make the best films every year, but they make most of 
the Academy Award contenders. It is a function of their being able to afford 
those classy stars' and directors' salaries, the big ad and publicity campaigns 
that stimulate the box office, and the Oscar campaigns that eventually lure 
academy voters out of their dens up in Benedict Canyon to see what the fuss is 
all about. 
</P>
<P>
So, who are the candidates for next year's awards? Some films will probably be 
postponed (for reasons of marketing, production delays or odor) and unforeseen 
titles will be slipped in. But based on the current schedule, some reluctant 
handicapping by studio sources, and the outrageous assumption that these films 
and performances will live up to their potential, here's an early look at the 
field for '90 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Best Picture 
</P>
<P>
"Untitled Woody Allen." Orion. Nobody outside Allen's immediate circle knows 
anything about this planned fall release, except that it's going to be 
funny/serious, in the mold, they say, of "Annie Hall" and he's in it! After 
"September" and "Another Woman," bleak trifles that the Grim Reaper might have 
walked out on, an Oscar nomination would almost be an act of national 
conscience. 
</P>
<P>
"Fat Man and Little Boy." Paramount. English director Roland Joffe ("The 
Killing Fields," "The Mission") is as serious as a World War II newsreel and 
he's got the sort of topic here (the creation of the atom bombs dropped on 
Japan) that will assure both massive publicity and sincere reflection by 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
"Valmont." Orion. Czech director Milos Forman doesn't make movies often, but 
when he does, they get Oscar nominations. His last effort, "Amadeus," was the 
big winner in 1986, and even though this is based on the same material that 
inspired the current nominee, "Dangerous Liaisons," it will be a major player 
in '90. 
</P>
<P>
"In Country." Warners. Director Norman Jewison, who won an Oscar 23 years ago 
for "In the Heat of the Night," is hot again. His "A Soldier's Story" was 
nominated for best picture in 1984, and he was nominated as best director last 
year for "Moonstruck." Known as an actors' director, Jewison is working here 
with a family's struggle to overcome the wounds of Vietnam, and if he gets a 
believable performance out of Bruce Willis, he's in. 
</P>
<P>
"I Love You to Death" (Tri-Star). The reliable Lawrence Kasdan returns to "The 
Big Chill" ensemble form with a psychological drama starring William Hurt, 
Kevin Kline, Tracey Ullman and River Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
"Two Jakes" (Paramount). The long-awaited sequel to "Chinatown" has yet to go 
into production, which makes a 1989 release a little iffy. But if it does make 
it, and if it's as good as the original, it will be the film to beat. It would 
also make Jack Nicholson a nominee in two categories, as best director and best 
actor. 
</P>
<P>
Other pictures bound to get a lot of attention are: "Steel Magnolias," the 
Herbert Ross-directed adaptation of the hit off-Broadway play set in a Southern 
beauty salon; "Born on the 4th of July" (Universal), Oliver Stone's profile of 
paraplegic Vietnam hero Ron Kovic; "Letters" (MGM/UA), a relationship movie 
that teams Jane Fonda with Robert De Niro and reteams director Marty Ritt with 
his "Norma Rae" writers Irving Ravitch and Harriet Frank, Jr.); "Family 
Business" (Tri-Star), a three-generation family drama starring Sean Connery, 
Dustin Hoffman and Matthew Broderick and directed by Sidney Lumet; "Always," 
another "serious" Steven Spielberg movie, this one starring Richard Dreyfuss 
and Holly Hunter; and "Dead Poet's Society" (Touchstone), which stars Robin 
Williams as a popular teacher in a boy's prep school and directed by the gifted 
Australian Peter Weir. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Best Actor 
</P>
<P>
The lead actors in any of the preceding films above could be nominated, 
providing the film's work and are well-reviewed. But these seem most likely: 
</P>
<P>
Paul Newman has two chances this year, playing Gen. Leslie Groves in "Fat Man 
and Little Boy" and Louisiana Gov. Earl Long in "Blaze." Historically, the 
academy members have just loved Newman's Southern accents. Three of his seven 
nominations came for Southern roles (in "Hud," "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" and 
"Cool Hand Luke"). 
</P>
<P>
Marlon Brando plays an aging lawyer in "A Dry White Season," his first role 
since "The Formula" in 1980. Brando, like Allen, never participates in the 
Oscars, but the academy loves him nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
Al Pacino, a perennial nominee until he starred in the ill-conceived 
"Revolution," plays a veteran New York cop in love with murder suspect Ellen 
Barkin in Harold Becker's "Sea of Love." 
</P>
<P>
Colin Firth, in the role John Malkovich plays in "Dangerous Liaisons," will be 
the newcomer to the category if "Valmont" is up to Milos Forman's standards. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Nicholson, who's at home in both lead and supporting roles, could end up 
with nominations in both categories, as best actor for "Two Jakes" and best 
supporting actor for "Batman," in which he plays the Joker. 
</P>
<P>
Robert De Niro is going to be seen all over the place this year. He can be seen 
right now playing a Vietnam veteran in "Jacknife," and later in the year as an 
illiterate factory worker getting the word and wisdom from Jane Fonda in 
"Letters" and as a con man on the lam with Sean Penn in Neil Jordan's "We're No 
Angels." 
</P>
<P>
Other actors with the right stuff: Richard Dreyfuss has done nothing but good 
work since his comeback in "Down and Out in Beverly Hills," and will appear in 
a big film ("Always"); Dustin Hoffman is always a contender, and will be this 
year for "Family Business"; Tom Cruise gained credibility in "Rain Main" and 
may cash it in for his role as Ron Kovic in "Born on the 4th of July"; the 
well-liked Jack Lemmon has another showcase role in "Dad," in which he plays a 
man in his late 80s; William Hurt ("I Love You to Death"), whose work seems to 
hold his acting colleagues in awe; and Robert Duvall, hot off the well-reviewed 
miniseries "Lonesome Dove," plays the fugitive Nazi Adolph Eichman in "The 
White Crow." 
</P>
<P>
Television fans will have several chances to root for their stars. Bruce Willis 
("In Country"), Tom Selleck ("Hard Rain") and Michael J. Fox ("Casualties of 
War") all have starring roles in heavy dramatic films. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Best Actress 
</P>
<P>
Meryl Streep is starring in something called "The Lives and Loves of a She 
Devil." No word on what the accent will be, but she's always a contender. 
</P>
<P>
If Glenn Close doesn't get the Oscar on Wednesday night (for "Dangerous 
Liaisons") that many people think she should have won last year (for "Fatal 
Attraction"), they're really going to owe her. And the payoff could come for 
either "Immediate Family," in which she co-stars with James Woods, or "The 
White Crow," where she plays an American professor confronting the truth of the 
Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Fonda has had a tired run in recent years, but in Marty Ritt's "Letters," 
she'll benefit from sage direction and the energy of co-star De Niro. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley MacLaine and Sally Field are the two most frequently mentioned stars of 
"Steel Magnolias," the Herbert Ross-directed adaptation of a hit Off-Broadway 
play about the relationships of several women in a Southern town. 
</P>
<P>
Bette Midler may be seen by the end of the year in Touchstone's "Stella," a 
remake of "Stella Dallas," a four-hankie weeper that won an Oscar nomination 
for Barbara Stanwyck in 1937. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other actresses with awards potential: Jessica Lange plays a big city 
widow with two kids in Paul Brickman's "Men Don't Leave" and a criminal 
attorney in Costa-Gavras' "Music Box"; Barbara Hershey, who keeps winning 
awards at Cannes and getting shut out by the academy, plays a lawyer in a 
tangled courtroom family drama "Defenseless"; Susan Sarandon, well-liked but 
overlooked in "Bull Durham," is a reporter in "A Dry White Season"; English 
discovery Emily Lloyd tries on a Southern American accent in "In Country"; and 
Holly Hunter from "Broadcast News" will appear in two films, as the flaming 
redhead title character in "Miss Firecracker" and a World War II pilot's girl 
in Spielberg's "Always." 
</P>
<P>
If all this takes the suspense out of next year's awards for you too, consider 
this: there are still 730 days or so before they give out the awards for 
excellence in 1990. But you heard it here first -- Warren Beatty's "Dick Tracy" 
is going to run the table.

GOD, AS SEEN BY ELVIS COSTELLO; 
</P>
<P>
HIS ALBUM 'SPIKE' HAS A TOUCH OF THE ALMIGHTY AND A BIG DOSE OF HUMOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Elvis Costello has never seemed much of a supernaturalist. "I know," he agrees 
-- ever the well-grounded rationalist -- "and I've not started now, have I?" 
</P>
<P>
Not exactly, but this most caustic and agreeably intellectual of rock stars 
does have a song about the Almighty on his acclaimed new album. And if it's 
true that mankind tends to remake God in its own image, then it should be scant 
surprise that Elvis Costello's God is a little like, well, Elvis Costello. That 
is, a student of pop culture, cynical, hyperaware, both disgusted and amused 
and, of course . . . comic. 
</P>
<P>
"Heaven as described in that song is a little bit like this bar -- a waiting 
room for something," says Costello, gesturing around the West Hollywood hotel 
lounge. That song is "God's Comic," a fairly riotous account of a recently 
deceased drunken comedian's first encounter with his Maker. Costello picks up 
the story, embellishing it along the way: 
</P>
<P>
"He's confronted with God on a big turquoise waterbed full of tropical fish. 
God's got like 19 TVs on there, all connected to satellite, with colorized 
versions of 'Dark Victory' and 'It's a Wonderful Life.' . . . He's reading 
books by Jackie Collins and Jeffrey Archer -- and Bret Easton Ellis, he loves 
Bret." 
</P>
<P>
God finally gets fed up with "all of this unbelievable junk," makes travel 
plans to go hide out at the North Pole and leaves the departing thought that 
maybe he "should have given the world to the monkeys." In interviews (he's 
given similar recountings of the song several times), Costello invariably adds 
the tag line: "Davy, Peter, Mickey and Michael." 
</P>
<P>
You can almost hear the rim shot and cymbal crash. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the once-and-future fiery Englishman was recently quoted in a magazine 
as saying that his new album, "Spike" -- with its title alluding to musical 
funnyman Spike Jones -- is "my first foray into comedy records." His tongue was 
wedged well into his cheek, probably more so than was Bob Dylan's when that 
songwriter claimed a few years back that "all my records are comedy records." 
</P>
<P>
"Who said that?" Costello asks, chuckling at having been beaten to the punch. 
"That could well be true. I think he's very funny. Dylan was right. He's an 
overlooked humorist." 
</P>
<P>
Costello's writing -- oft-accused in the early days of harboring misogyny and 
even now of being unnecessarily bitter -- has been taken at face value more 
often than not, its elegant pop formalism and sophistication throwing listeners 
off the trail of its puns and occasional sly self-deprecation. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with "Spike" -- which, for a "comedy" record, has some of his most somber 
and tragic songs ever -- Costello outrightly presents himself as the clown. Its 
outrageous cover has his grinning, harlequin-like visage mounted on a wall 
plaque in the shape of the logo of Warner Bros., his new record label after a 
dozen years with Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, there's humor where I can find it, as dark as it might be. If there's no 
light at all, you can't see anything, it's completely black. There's no such 
thing as completely black. Well, there is, but you wouldn't be able to take a 
picture of it, or you wouldn't be able to make a song out of it, I don't think. 
They're not all humorous like fall-on-the-floor laughing. The song 'Chewing 
Gum' is certainly humorous, and very sad," he noted of his story about a 
dissatisfied mail-order bride who plugs up her ears with gum. 
</P>
<P>
"But there are some songs on this album without any redeeming humor. 'Tramp the 
Dirt Down' is the only one without even any apparent hope. And 'Let 'Em Dangle' 
doesn't have a tremendous amount of laughs in it, does it? But that one does 
have hope in it. It is for life, it's not against it." 
</P>
<P>
There's an irony in comparing those two songs that doesn't completely escape 
Costello: While "Let 'Em Dangle" makes a cogent argument against capital 
punishment, "Tramp the Dirt Down" has Costello almost wishing someone -- 
Margaret Thatcher, to be precise -- dead. 
</P>
<P>
"Definitely wishing someone dead, not almost," he corrects, laughing. "There's 
no reasonable argument intended there; it's an unreasonable response to very 
unreasonable events. . . . If you call somebody 'a madam of a whorehouse' as I 
do, it's a fairly cheap insult. But there are plenty of times that they 
patronize you and insult your intelligence. So let's trade the language; let's 
talk at their level." 
</P>
<P>
That Dylan joker couldn't have said it better. 
</P>
<P>
"Spike" may prove Costello's best American seller ever; it's currently bulleted 
at No. 35 on the Billboard album chart in only its fifth week out, though it's 
his most unconventional album ever. In place of his longtime backing band, the 
Attractions, the singer-songwriter employed a diverse cast of musicians in a 
variety of locales, including Los Angeles, New Orleans and his new home, 
Ireland. Putting in noteworthy appearances are Paul McCartney, Roger McGuinn, T 
Bone Burnett, Chrissie Hynde and the Dirty Dozen Brass Band. Many of the 
players on the same songs -- McCartney and McGuinn, for example -- never met 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
"Heaven knows I've been an exponent and a champion of the live, spontaneous 
recording against any other production value, but you have to acknowledge it 
can have certain pitfalls. With this record, each player that came in had to 
play in reaction to what was on the track before he came in. And some very 
happy accidents came about. . ." 
</P>
<P>
That Costello would end up taking on Paul McCartney as his first continuing 
songwriting partner -- at the latter's behest -- has confused some fans. Where 
Costello is dry and often cryptic, McCartney has had the less esteemed 
reputation in recent years of being a sentimental writer. (McCartney helped out 
only a little on the writing of two of this album's songs, the single 
"Veronica" and "Pads, Paws and Claws"; the more equal collaborations between 
these two won't be heard till McCartney's own album comes out.) 
</P>
<P>
"I end up in this very curious situation of having to defend writing with him, 
and therefore having to defend his writing -- which I don't see as my place," 
says Costello. "It's kind of patronizing. It's not really anybody's business 
what I think of his other writing. I don't like every record he's made, and he 
doesn't like every record I've made, either. That wasn't important. We're 
trying to write new records, not rewrite old ones." 
</P>
<P>
On the subject of old collaborators, Costello is a bit defensive. Much loved as 
this album's multiplicity of textures is, many fans want to know if there will 
ever be another record from what many consider one of the great rock 'n' roll 
quartets of all time: Elvis Costello &amp; the Attractions. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know. Ask them. I wanted them to play on this record, but Steve 
(Nieve) had a problem with not being the only keyboard player on it. Because he 
has a different conception of there being a group called Elvis Costello &amp; 
the Attractions, like the Who or something, and I don't think that's the case. 
So my feeling is that it's a mistake to be sentimental about these matters. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw Bill Monroe play at McCabe's, and right at the end of the show he 
thanked everybody for coming and he said, 'I remember the old days.' Everybody 
went, 'Oh, Bill's gonna tell us some confidence, some old tale. . . .' And then 
he said, 'They're gone.' " 
</P>
<P>
Costello very nearly guffaws at the brusqueness of the sentiment. "I agree, 
man, they're gone. You either saw it or you missed it." 
</P>
<P>
Guess who plans to have the last laugh?

<P>
KJLH(102.3 FM; 2.3 Arbitron rating or approximately 37,300 listeners per 
average quarter hour) Los Angeles' highest-rated black-oriented station, KJLH 
stresses the dance music sounds of such artists as Jody Watley, Paula Abdul, 
James Brown, and Keith Sweat plus occasional reggae, jazz and rap, said program 
director Cliff Winston. "We play city-dweller music for 'hip' people," he said. 
The station aims for an 18-plus age group with annual incomes of between 
$25,000 and $50,000. An average ad costs about $200 on the station owned by 
Taxi Productions and Stevie Wonder. 
</P>
<P>
KACE (103.9 FM; 1.4 rating or 22,700 listeners per average quarter hour). Up

GERHARD RICHTER'S HAT TRICK; 
</P>
<P>
FOR THIS PROTEAN GERMAN ARTIST, THE ONLY CONSTANT IS CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Things are not what they seem. Take Gerhard Richter. When you travel to West 
Germany his paintings are as much a staple of museums' contemporary galleries 
as, say, Andy Warhol or Frank Stella. The difference is that whether you are in 
Dusseldorf or Cologne, Stuttgart or Hanover you always recognize the Warhols, 
Stellas and other products of the brotherhood of the international art 
franchise. Art museums' contemporary galleries are as homogenized as Burger 
Kings. 
</P>
<P>
Gerhard Richter is different. You always wonder if this Richter in Berlin is 
the same Richter you saw in Frankfurt. That Richter painted a black-and-white 
snapshot scene of a family of burghers at the beach. This Richter paints 
massive Abstract Expressionisms. Can it be the same chap, der selbe Kerl? You 
can run around for years wondering if Gerhard Richter is one guy or a family. 
But in that case wouldn't you have Richter der Junge and Richter der Alte, as 
with the Holbeins? Maybe he is a corporation. 
</P>
<P>
The question nags in the back of the mind like the name of a 1940s character 
actor you just can't remember. Now finally, and at last, the San Francisco 
Museum of Modern Art performs a great public service in presenting a traveling 
retrospective of Gerhard Richter's art (through May 28). Some 70 works spanning 
more than two decades prove he is indeed one discrete free-standing person. He 
just changes hats a lot. 
</P>
<P>
It's a relief to have that cleared up, but no sooner is one veil removed than 
another falls in its place. Enigmas are like that. 
</P>
<P>
Why has Gerhard Richter gone on changing? Artistic convention holds that its 
practitioners must maintain a certain consistency of style. The most famous 
modern artist to break this rule was Pablo Picasso but through all his changes 
his work maintained a certain trademark look. An artist's manner is supposed to 
express his integrity, character and personality. If, for example, we have a 
friend whose natural personality is a bit like John Wayne's we do not expect 
him to suddenly start behaving like Bette Midler. If he does, we assume he's a 
terrible poseur, has gone mad or is putting us on. 
</P>
<P>
Richter bobbles around from photo-based Pop images of cows to color-chart 
rectangles to gentle pastel landscapes to panes of glass suspended in metal 
frames and back to portraits of famous men. The first nasty suspicion is that 
he is a familiar sort of artistic opportunist who changes style to exploit the 
current fashion. 
</P>
<P>
But things are not what they seem. An aesthetically innocent girl walks through 
the gallery singing Richter's praises for doing so many different things so 
well. Any artnik with an ounce of objectivity then realizes he is operating 
with a load of mental baggage that may do as much to block insight as to create 
it. Just another Pirandello character who is only right because he thinks he 
is. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, the chronological evidence doesn't altogether support the supposition 
that Richter is a camp-follower. It tends to support the other, drearier, 
supposition that he is a pedant. An early work from 1966 depicts a nude young 
woman descending a staircase in a blurry Photorealist style. It clearly refers 
to modern art's greatest intellectual and ironist, Marcel Duchamp. Nearby hangs 
another 1966 work of radically contradictory appearance -- a color chart. Just 
rectangles of color. That's all, folks. 
</P>
<P>
It appears we have fallen into the clammy clutches of a conceptual artist. It 
appears that Richter is interested in "questioning the act of perception." It 
appears we are going to once again be the victim of that suffocating scold 
about how all art is a meaningless illusion. It must be very depressing to make 
a career of telling the world your work is worthless. 
</P>
<P>
Catalogue essays in Teutontic style prop up this hypothesis surrounding 
Richter's art with ponderous palaver about semiotics, demythification and 
appropriation. We are informed that the artist has been actively engaged in an 
attitude of nihilism. Wow, Nihlism, I bet nobody's thought of that since 
Nietzsche. Good thing, too. 
</P>
<P>
It's certainly possible to read Richter's art as an act of neutralization. If 
we buy the intellectual script attached to it, then Richter's habit of using 
traditional painting as a vehicle for vanguard ideas is indeed an attempt to 
attain a state of perfect expressive nothingness. In that case there is nothing 
to do but go home and nurse the massive migraine induced by an art of suicidal 
denial. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, things are not what they seem. 
</P>
<P>
Good news. It appears that Richter has expressed himself in spite of himself. 
If you forget all the surrounding guff and just look at the art, it is never 
uninteresting. It also implies a brave and difficult personal odyssey. 
</P>
<P>
Gerhard Richter was born in Dresden in 1932. The most superficial memory of 
recent history suggests his childhood cannot have been any picnic, what with 
fire-bombings and the city winding up on the wrong side when it was all over. 
Somehow he survived it and remained in the Eastern zone where he was trained in 
the dreary artistic discipline of Socialist Realism. No wonder he made his way 
to the West in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
All that suggests a much more plausible understanding of his early art than 
arid art theory. The gray flatness of his earliest work suggests authentic 
depression. The emotional deadness of art copied from blurred newspaper 
photographs feels like a literal transcription of the inner state of a 
traumatized refugee. He muses on the impersonality of modern victimization in 
grimy images of a murdered prostitute or eight student nurses slaughtered in 
Chicago. He is preoccupied with violated innocence, but the pictures also have 
a weird erotic charge that is denied. Feeling is just too painful, so there is 
an escape into rationalization and art games. 
</P>
<P>
Something else happens in aerial landscapes that want to play at being real 
views and brushy abstract paintings at once. One pictures downtown Madrid. 
Given traditional German leanings to symbolism, it is no doubt an evocation of 
another country that fell to fascism, but something more important happens. 
Despite its grayness the work takes pleasure in its own juicy thick paint. 
Emotion stirs. 
</P>
<P>
Then come a series of soft pictures in pastel shades -- big candles, a skull, a 
churchyard and views of the German landscape and sky. They evoke the great 
Romantic Caspar David Friedrich and throb with Heimweh -- an almost religious 
homesickness for an idealized Germany that may never have been. Feeling is 
alive in these touching pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it was too much for him because the '70s saw a retreat into colorless 
Minimalism, goopy fields of gunmetal gray, big panes of glass. After all maybe 
it was a concession to fashion. People are complicated. Faces painted from 
photographs also return but with a new twist. Richter made a huge wall of 48 
portraits of famous men of the modern era ranging from H. G. Wells to Anton 
Bruckner. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly conceptual, the work touches many things, including a erman 
preoccupation with history and documentation. Richter's version looks very 
public but comes across as a personal rumination. The faces -- as faces -- 
clearly are meaningless. What counted with these men were their works, their 
ideas, and overriding all that the fact they were all so authentically and 
obdurately themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Richter must have decided to take the example because his latest work is 
astonishing. He has taken to making very large Abstract Expressionist paintings 
whose existence can only be accounted for by the artist's decision to finally 
feel and let it all hang out. They do retain a whiff of personal elusiveness in 
brushwork that can't be traced to the human hand -- big swaths of paint that 
must have been made with a broad squeegee. The paintings look blown up like 
enlarged fragments from microscopic photographs. They mix geometric elements 
with brushy areas and flat and deep space. They mix the sublime aspirations 
expected of abstraction with a vulgarity so coarse it has to be conscious. They 
are colored the fluorescent hues of a kitsch carnival at night. 
</P>
<P>
You can feel the artist's gusto in a wildly theatrical picture that seems to 
unfurl a red Baroque drapery revealing a blinding yellow sun on one side, a 
teeming landscape on the other. He lets himself be tense and complex in the 
apocalyptic wave of "Net." Just to make sure we know he knows what he's doing, 
he calls more than one picture "Courbet," connecting himself to the glorious 
overripeness of the French master. 
</P>
<P>
Richter found out that art is an illusion but not a meaningless one. He 
discovered that you don't need issues or trends to make terrific art. If you 
just paint the socks off something, the endless yardstick of quality will bring 
it home.

KITCHENS ON THE FRONT BURNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The open kitchen is as much an emblem of the 'New American Cuisine' as 
goat-cheese pizzas or mesquite-grilled fish. And though the mere installation 
of an open kitchen does not guarantee an establishment's success, it is a fact 
that a good many of the most successful restaurants in town do possess them. At 
Ma Maison, customers can look down into the kitchen from the bar. Other 
restaurants provide wide-open views from the dining room -- among them Spago, 
Chinois on Main, Citrus, Angeli and Trattoria Angeli, Morton's, Locanda Veneta, 
Rebecca's, Kate Mantilini, DC 3, the Pregos in both Beverly Hills and Irvine, 
the Parkway Grill, the Crocodile Cafe, and Chianti Cucina (which doesn't just 
have an open kitchen -- it is one). 
</P>
<P>
The kitchens at the last eight of these restaurants are the work of the K.I.A. 
That's the Kitchen Intelligence Agency run by Paul Bisno and Larry Wirth. 
("We've probably worked on kitchens -- open and otherwise -- for something like 
200 restaurants in all," estimates Bisno.) 
</P>
<P>
Because it's their business, Bisno and Wirth have kept a track of the recent 
genealogy of the open kitchen: 
</P>
<P>
"In the sixties," Bisno says, "about the only open kitchens around here were at 
the Chuck's Steak Houses. They, in turn, had gotten the idea from Buzz 
Schneider, who has restaurants all over Hawaii -- and he used to say that he 
had gotten the idea from cafeterias, which were sort of open kitchens by 
definition. " 
</P>
<P>
"Another real pioneer," adds Wirth, "was David Alderman, who put open kitchens 
in all his places -- Moonshadows, Orville &amp; Wilbur's, Nantucket Light, and 
Carlos &amp; Pepe's. 
</P>
<P>
For whatever reasons, Bisno and Wirth note, open kitchens went out of fashion 
for the most part in the mid-1970s, with the serious new restaurants that had 
started opening around the country mostly keeping their kitchens out of sight. 
Then came the exhibition kitchen Alice Waters installed in her Cafe at Chez 
Panisse in Berkeley, followed closely by Spectrum Foods' original San Francisco 
Prego (where even the fresh pasta was made out in the open) and the 
kitchen-as-stage-set that Barbara Lazaroff designed for Wolfgang Puck at Spago. 
Suddenly open kitchens were in -- or, rather, "out" -- again. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of that," says Wirth, "was probably because the equipment people had 
started cooking with brick pizza ovens, rotisseries, and so on -- just looked 
too good. You didn't want to hide it away." 
</P>
<P>
Bisno suggests another factor: "Restaurants in general changed -- formal was 
out, fun was in. Open kitchens automatically give restaurants a certain 
informality, and that became what people were looking for. It's the difference 
between a Ma Maison and a Spago." 
</P>
<P>
He adds that one of his favorite local restaurant kitchens was at the late La 
Couronne in Pasadena (the work of designer Ed Sovich of Laschover and Sovich in 
South Pasadena), which was an exhibition kitchen in the sense that it displayed 
itself through a bay window onto an adjacent courtyard. But was concealed from 
the dining room. "It was one of the greatest kitchens I've ever seen," says 
Bisno, "and I think it was wasted. 
</P>
<P>
But Wirth admits that open kitchens do present problems. "To begin with," he 
explains, "once you get past the brick ovens and rotisseries, not everything in 
a kitchen is good-looking, so you've got line-of-sight problems to deal with, 
and you automatically have to go to the best fabricators for sheet metal and so 
on -- which of course jacks up the price of things. Then, heat and smoke can 
cause real problems -- especially if you've got wood-burning ovens or mesquite 
grills. And you've got to worry about lighting, because kitchens are usually 
fluorescent-lit and very bright, while dining rooms tend to be incandescent-lit 
and softer." 
</P>
<P>
Bisno adds that noise can be a problem, too. "If you just open a rule-book and 
design an exhaust system according to the specs and put it in an open kitchen," 
he says, "you'll probably end up drowning out everybody in the dining room." 
</P>
<P>
One way to help solve the problems posed by kitchen heat, smoke, and noise is 
to glass the kitchen off -- a solution Bisno and Wirth have employed at DC 3. 
The kitchen is still "open" in the sense of being visible from the dining room, 
but the emanations from it are considerably reduced. Citrus and the new Victor 
Hugo in Beverly Hills are two other high-profile restaurants with glassed-in 
kitchens. Is this, then, a new trend -- the next step after kitchens that are 
completely open? "I don't think so," Bisno replies. "You'll definitely be 
seeing more kitchens behind glass, but they take up more space than plain open 
ones, and you generally have to arrange the traffic patterns differently. They 
don't always work."

A GREAT RHINO? HE SHOULD KNOW; 
</P>
<P>
BILL BURRUD, A PIONEER OF 'REALITY TV,' HAS HIT THE DOCUMENTARY TRAIL AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The leathery-faced, white-haired TV veteran was giving away a good part of the 
spotlight to his considerably younger co-star, but if he harbored any 
resentment, it didn't show. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the greatest rhinos I've ever worked with," said Bill Burrud, 
handing yet another apple to Lasai -- Hindi for "Fat Boy" -- a 7,000-pound 
beast that roams the ranges of San Diego County's Wild Animal Park. "He's just 
great, isn't he?" 
</P>
<P>
Burrud should know. Over the years, he has worked with a lot of rhinos -- and 
tigers, crocodiles, Komodo dragons and scores of other beastly creatures. In 
the years after he filmed his first show with a rented camera in 1954, Burrud 
produced more than 800 episodes of such animal and adventure programs as 
"Animal World", "Safari to Adventure" and "Wanderlust." 
</P>
<P>
"He is one of the pioneers of reality television," says Terry Bales, an 
instructor in TV history and chairman of the telecommunications department at 
Rancho Santiago College. "I used to watch all those films as a kid, growing up 
in a small town (like) Upland. . . . All those trips that he used to take were 
amazing." 
</P>
<P>
Now, after a few years of semi-dormancy, Burrud and the company he started, 
Bill Burrud Productions Inc., are back, riding the wave of "reality television" 
that increasingly has been filling the schedules of networks, independents and 
cable stations alike. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which recently moved its offices from Hollywood to Orange County, 
is busy reformatting old shows and taping new ones for the Discovery Channel, 
an all-documentary station that has grown rapidly since it was launched in 1985 
and that now reaches more than 30 million households on cable networks. 
</P>
<P>
Burrud has also signed deals with the Disney Channel and Yorkshire Television 
International in England and is negotiating for an adventure series with 
A&amp;E, the Arts and Entertainment Network. 
</P>
<P>
These days, though the show still takes viewers to the wild jungles of Borneo 
or the grassy plains of Africa, Burrud's own trips are more likely to be to a 
place like Wild Animal Park. At 64, the Sunset Beach resident is semi-retired; 
he still appears as narrator and host of the documentaries ("Hi, I'm Bill 
Burrud. Join me for an animal odyssey, right here on Discovery. . . ."), but no 
longer is he the driving force behind them. 
</P>
<P>
That position, along with those of president and CEO of Bill Burrud Productions 
Inc., has been assumed by Burrud's 35-year-old son, John, who does the 
negotiating, seeks out locations and directs the programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Dad stays away from the business end," John said. "I like pressure. I like 
negotiating. My father has always disliked confrontation." 
</P>
<P>
The business end has been good for Bill Burrud Productions lately. The recent 
deals with the Discovery Channel are worth about $2 million to the company, 
John said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a real resurgence in reality programming," John noted. "Four or 5 
years ago . . . the only place you'd find reality TV was PBS. Now, you find it 
even on the networks and independents -- newsmagazine shows, armchair 
adventures. People want to see exotic places. . . . They travel more, and maybe 
they're tired of the drivel that's normally on TV." 
</P>
<P>
Bales of Rancho Santiago also has noticed that reality TV is displacing some of 
the vapid sitcoms that have stifled the airwaves over the past few years. But 
many of the new shows, such as NBC's "Unsolved Mysteries" and Fox Television's 
"America's Most Wanted," have "gone into the trash variety," Bales said. 
"They're crime-stopper shows, tabloid television." 
</P>
<P>
Burrud's shows, Bales said, don't fall into that category, though their 
popularity may be due in part to the same phenomenon: a paucity of new ideas 
for fictional TV. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they've run out," Bales said. "You can see from all these reunion 
shows. . . . Realism presumably needs no writing. You just go out and start 
shooting." 
</P>
<P>
Burrud Productions moved its offices from Hollywood to a suite in Huntington 
Harbour last year because "we didn't really have to have a studio in 
Hollywood," John said. "Most of our locations are around the world." 
</P>
<P>
One of his most recent locations was the Pacific island of Tarawa. The program 
he taped there, called "Return to Tarawa" and scheduled to air on Discovery 
this summer, tells of the U.S. Marine assault on the island during World War II 
when it was occupied by the Japanese. Actual combat footage shot by a Marine is 
mixed with interviews of veterans of the battle who returned to the island with 
the film crew. 
</P>
<P>
The first of four 1-hour specials Burrud is under contract to produce for 
Discovery, "Tarawa" is something of a departure from the sort of thing that 
made him such a familiar face in the late '60s and '70s. His most successful 
show, "Animal World," was prime-time on a major network from 1968 to '71, about 
the same period as Marlon Perkins' "Wild Kingdom." 
</P>
<P>
The show, which eventually went into syndication, featured usually wild but 
sometimes controlled animals placed in natural settings. They were not highly 
detailed, problem-oriented National Geographic specials, just armchair nature 
tours. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the appeal of Bill's programs is they are fairly impressionistic," 
says Greg Moyer, vice president for programming at Discovery. "They are 
organized around the observations of Burrud himself. . . . I'm sure that's what 
makes them accessible. They represent one man's view of something, never 
represented as the definitive look (at) the animal he chooses to observe." 
</P>
<P>
Burrud agrees with Moyer's assessment. "I'm not a zoologist," he said. "I'm not 
an expert. I've had the pleasure of meeting scientists, and there are so many 
guys in the field who are experts." 
</P>
<P>
In return for their help on his shows, Burrud sometimes brings various kinds of 
equipment to field researchers. "I wouldn't mind paying them, but they'd much 
rather have the equipment," he said. "We once brought a rectal thermometer to a 
scientist on the Komodo Islands. It was the only way he could take the 
temperatures of Komodo dragons." 
</P>
<P>
The Discovery Channel thought enough of Burrud's programs to buy more than 230 
half-hour episodes from the company's inventory. Footage from some of those 
shows will be mixed with previously unreleased footage to create a new 1-hour 
series called "Bill Burrud's Animal Odyssey." The show will debut April 2. Each 
episode will feature three 20-minute segments. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the Burruds traveled to Wild Animal Park with a crew to tape new 
"intros," "outros" and "bumpers" ("Next we'll travel to the Arctic. . . . but 
first, these words"). 
</P>
<P>
When he wasn't feeding apples to Lasai, Bill Burrud kneeled in a pen with 
hungry cheetahs ("Aren't these beautiful cheetahs?" he asked, smiling into the 
camera), let a tarantula crawl on his arm, and mugged with a black bear, 
beavers and elephants. He also shot segments with a serval (a small African 
wildcat), Przewalski's horses, dromedary camels and gorillas. 
</P>
<P>
Three straight days of taping in the bright sun took its toll, but Burrud was 
still sharp and maintained his upbeat sense of humor. As the end of the final 
day approached, two women on the Discovery staff were hurriedly writing the 
lines for the last few spots. "Come on, girls," Bill said. "I've gotta get home 
and cash my Social Security check. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Burrud has the healthy, tanned look of a man who has spent his whole life 
in the right parts of Southern California. He still swims year-round in the 
ocean and plays handball regularly at the Hollywood YMCA. He accompanied the 
crew on its recent trip to Tarawa, and hopes to make more programs about and 
with the soldiers who fought in the Pacific war. 
</P>
<P>
Burrud himself was in the Navy during that campaign, and his brother was killed 
in the war while flying over Japan. 
</P>
<P>
A Hollywood native, he broke into show business as a 7-year-old in 1932 in a 
traveling production of "Music in the Air." He went on to appear in about 30 
movies for 20th Century-Fox, Columbia and MGM. 
</P>
<P>
It was Burrud's success as a child actor that first brought him to Orange 
County. His grandfather had built a cottage on Sunset Beach in the early 1900s, 
and young Bill wanted to use some of his own money from the movies to buy his 
own surf-side lot. 
</P>
<P>
"My money was in trust, so we had to go to court to get it freed up," he 
recalls. "The lot cost $1,100, and I remember the judge saying that $1,100 
seemed like a lot for a piece of sand." 
</P>
<P>
Such advice notwithstanding, Bill bought the lot, and about 8 years ago he sold 
his house in Pacific Palisades and moved to his house in Sunset Beach. John and 
his family live next door. 
</P>
<P>
When he returned to Los Angeles after the war, Burrud finished his studies at 
USC and received a degree in business administration. A few years later, he 
sold his first film -- "Open Road" -- to KTTV, and Bill Burrud Productions was 
on its way. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I did straight travel shows," Burrud said. "But every time we did 
animals, we'd get a higher rating." 
</P>
<P>
So he began producing the animal series and several specials, including an 
hourlong film in 1974 called "Where Did All the Animals Go?" It raised about 
$120,000 for an anti-poaching fund; the proceeds were used to purchase a 
helicopter and other equipment to fight poachers in Kenya's Tsavo Park West. 
</P>
<P>
John Burrud learned documentary film-making at his father's side, traveling 
with him to Africa at 14 to film the pilot episode for "Animal World," and from 
then on, spending his summer vacations from Palisades High School on location 
with the company. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved it," John said. "I would work as a grip, a go-fer, that kind of thing. 
. . . When I graduated from high school, rather than go to college, I decided 
that this is what I wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
Young Burrud spent several years learning how to edit and shoot film before he 
produced his first feature -- on sharks -- in 1976. He took over as president 
of the company about 7 years ago. How does he like working with his famous 
father? 
</P>
<P>
"It's been fabulous and horrible all at the same time," he said. "It's great 
because we've gotten real close. But there's a little bit of a role reversal at 
times. And it's hard because this is a creative business, and sometimes there 
is a difference of opinion . . . but I wouldn't have traded it for anything."

CINEMATIC SLEIGHT OF HAND;

<P>
THAT GRACEFUL RAIL STATION IN 'RAIN MAN' IS IN, GASP, SANTA ANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Quick -- what's the location for the closing scene of "Rain Man," when Charlie 
Babbitt puts his brother on a train bound east from Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
Gotta be Union Station, right? Where else do you board a train in L.A.? 
</P>
<P>
Wrong. It's the Santa Ana Regional Transportation Center. 
</P>
<P>
The station's tiled courtyard, curved stairways and graceful, wrought-iron 
railings provided just the backdrop the scene needed, according to Robin 
Citrin, location manager for the film, which is the odds-on favorite to sweep 
the Academy Awards this week. 
</P>
<P>
The film tells the story of the brothers' cross-country journey, and "we wanted 
a real transition from coast to coast," she said. The Santa Ana station 
"exemplified (the West) with its Spanish-style architecture." 
</P>
<P>
Union Station in downtown Los Angeles not only was too cavernous and old, but 
regulations there were too restrictive. 
</P>
<P>
"They only wanted us to film at night," Citrin said. "The script called for a 
daytime scene." 
</P>
<P>
Also, Union Station has extraordinarily high insurance requirements for film 
productions. California Film Commission director Lisa Rawlins said each star 
working there must be insured for $10 million to $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
"If you film on state property, the general requirement is $1 million" in 
insurance, Rawlins said. "Union Station traditionally has required much more." 
</P>
<P>
Once it was clear that Union Station would not work out, Citrin contacted 
Rawlins at the Film Commission, which maintains files on locations throughout 
the state. Rawlins sent pictures of the Santa Ana station. Citrin said she 
chose it over several others, including Glendale and Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The $17-million transportation center, on Santa Ana Boulevard just west of 
Grand Avenue, opened in 1985, replacing an old depot a few blocks south, on 4th 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
Citrin said: "It wasn't too small, it wasn't too large and, to our 
understanding, it had never been shot before. . . . It looked real great in the 
film. It's always a plus to have an undisclosed location. It gives (the scene) 
a fresh look." 
</P>
<P>
Getting the scene was a coup for Santa Ana, which, except for the Old County 
Courthouse, has few venues that make it into the movies. In general, Rawlins 
said, the film industry considers Orange County to be "as far away as Miami." 
</P>
<P>
The city is "just outside the (30-mile) union zone," Rawlins said, "so if they 
come down there . . . (the movie companies) have to pay additional expenses." 
</P>
<P>
Still, about 120 cast and crew members trekked from Los Angeles to film the 
scene July 20. The scene lasts just a couple of minutes, but the crew spent 13 
hours at the station getting it right. 
</P>
<P>
A train was sent down from L.A. by Amtrak. A spur behind the regular track 
allowed filming to go on without interrupting the regularly scheduled trains 
bound for Los Angeles and San Diego, according to Israel Garcia, the 
transportation center manager. 
</P>
<P>
The station was subsequently the setting for part of pop star Tiffany's most 
recent music video, "All This Time." Garcia is hoping that his building's show 
biz career is just starting to bloom. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good for the city," said Garcia, who almost made it into the movie 
himself but, after putting on a conductor's uniform, was told he looked too 
young. "It's something we would like to promote." 
</P>
<P>
And how was the climactic "Rain Man" scene received in Santa Ana? Did anyone 
notice the old town's gleaming train station up there on the silver screen? 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people recognized it," Garcia said. "They thought it was great. But I 
was amazed how many people are not aware of this facility. They think we're 
still on 4th Street." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

Long a fan of the movies in general and Dustin Hoffman in particular, Brian 
Johnson of Orange hopped into his van and headed to rural Nevada in July the 
moment he read that the cast and crew of "Rain Man" would be filming on 
location outside Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
A window cleaner by profession while he pursues a degree in cinematography at 
Cal State Fullerton, Johnson was hoping to witness a major-studio production in 
progress. He rolled into Blue Diamond (pop. 300) and Pahrump (pop. 1,000), 
towns where scenes in a desert diner and self-service laundry were shot. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble was that Johnson got there a day late: Shooting had wrapped, and 
the crew was gone. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until months later, after "Rain Man" was released and Johnson was 
reading stories about the movie, that he learned the bitter truth: The very day 
that he got to Pahrump, "Rain Man" was setting up shop to film the movie's 
final scenes -- at the train station in Santa Ana, a few miles from home. 
</P>
<P>
"I drove 750 miles," Johnson said, throwing up his hands, "and Dustin Hoffman 
is in Santa Ana." RANDY LEWIS

RANDY LEWIS: CRIME PLAYS, BUT NOT ACCORDION OWNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps it was a crime of need. Or of desperation. Maybe even a crime of 
passion. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever incited the burglary of my car last weekend, it was, in the 
parlance of all those pithy TV detectives, "a senseless crime." 
</P>
<P>
When I returned to the car from a concert I had attended, I didn't detect any 
damage right away. Such was the level of the thieves' expertise. Only later -- 
when I was on my way into the house and popped the trunk to collect my 
belongings -- was I struck by the enormity of this vile act. 
</P>
<P>
At least the miscreant bypassed the passenger compartment and all its 
valuables: my car stereo (must have been 'cause it's an in-dash, or he didn't 
like the Chieftains tape in it), my trusty Swiss army knife, automobile 
registration, Thomas Bros. map book and the sheet music to "Black Denim 
Trousers and Motorcycle Boots." 
</P>
<P>
The criminal mind. Go figure. 
</P>
<P>
This desperado even left behind a tool box with some excellent, pre-storewide 
discount Sears wrenches and screwdrivers. (He's evidently not one of those 
crafty vandals who sneaks into your house when you're gone and makes the 
faucets leak.) 
</P>
<P>
No, it seemed this villain knew just what he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
Yep. My accordion. 
</P>
<P>
"Why??!" wondered I, gazing in stunned disbelief at the space where only a few 
hours earlier my metallic-red, marble-finish instrument had rested. It had been 
on its way to join in the revelry at a St. Patrick's Day party; still echoing 
in my ears was the sound of a rendition I'd just worked up of Elvis' "Are You 
Lonesome Tonight?" which I had re-dubbed "Are You Gaelic Tonight?" 
</P>
<P>
On top of that, they had nabbed a bag with some laundry and a hair brush, but 
that's not what made me bristle: It's time to step up the war on poverty when 
street criminals stoop to accordion theft. 
</P>
<P>
I filed a police report immediately, though the desk sergeant sounded less than 
morally incensed when I reported the burglary at 2 a.m. He had that tone in his 
voice. You know the one: "What do you expect us to do? Arrest the guy or give 
him a reward?" 
</P>
<P>
Obviously a man insensitive to the savage-breast-soothing charm of a good 
polka. 
</P>
<P>
He asked whether I wanted to bring the car down to check for fingerprints or 
simply file the report over the phone. I scoffed. Certainly anyone clever 
enough to zero in on the one car in all of Southern California with a vintage 
12-bass keyboard accordion in the trunk would be astute enough to wear gloves. 
Blockhead. 
</P>
<P>
My insurance agent wasn't much better: "And you don't know who did it?" she 
blithely asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, yes," I said, "but then if I told you it wouldn't be a surprise anymore, 
would it?" 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, I want the scoundrel caught. Not to exact revenge (though I did 
have moments when I fantasized about what delicious sentence the Ayatollah 
would mete out for this offense. Always a believer that the punishment should 
fit the crime, I would stand the guy up against a wall, offer him a blindfold, 
then catch his chest hairs in the accordion's bellows). 
</P>
<P>
No, I wanted to understand the unfathomable. Who could have done this thing? 
Was it a disadvantaged youth from a broken home, the victim of a family driven 
apart by an incompetent accordion teacher? The owner of a Mexican restaurant 
finally pushed over the edge of sanity by bad nortenos music? Perhaps even a 
fellow musician contracted to play one too many Italian weddings? 
</P>
<P>
I felt eternally grateful that I left my clarinet at home, lest I might 
single-handedly have provided the tools of a roving polka mob. 
</P>
<P>
Even worse to consider: perhaps the thief had a partner in crime who now would 
insist they go for a tuba. 
</P>
<P>
The worst part, of course, wasn't the monetary loss I suffered but a sense that 
my person had been violated. I felt disoriented, slightly queasy. I'm told it's 
the same feeling most people experience after a theft. Or an accordion recital. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's the ripple effect that these brigands never consider: Not only 
did this crime deprive me of a creative outlet, it also will be felt by the 
intermittent rock band I play in (we specialize in the little-known sub-genre 
of intermittent rock). Not to mention our fans, which number into the dozens. 
</P>
<P>
I realize I'll probably never see the accordion again. But be on the lookout -- 
if you see some guy on a street corner who's wearing steel-gray pants, a 
green-striped shirt, freshly brushed hair and playing a red accordion, call the 
cops. 
</P>
<P>
Society will thank you.

SPRING STORM CAUSES ONLY A FEW PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first spring storm to hit the Southland, dropping less than half an inch of 
rain in most of Orange County, was enough to dampen the spirits of hundreds of 
youngsters ready for the annual Easter Fair at Garden Grove Park in Garden 
Grove. 
</P>
<P>
The fair had to rescheduled to a new date, which will be announced later, City 
Manager George Tindall said. 
</P>
<P>
The rain also caused a few minor accidents in the county, but nothing as 
serious as most police agencies had expected. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually a rain like this, we'll have about a dozen fender benders," said 
Placentia police spokesman David Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
"Today we didn't have a single one. Very unusual, but we were happy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Varies Around County 
</P>
<P>
The rain was twice as heavy in parts of south Orange County than in the north 
and central sections. 
</P>
<P>
At 7 p.m., San Juan Capistrano had received 0.82 of an inch of rain, the 
National Weather Service reported, in comparison to less than half an inch in 
most of the county. 
</P>
<P>
"It was funny weather," said one San Clemente police spokesman. "I left home in 
Laguna Hills where there wasn't a drop. Then I drive to work and hit a hell of 
a rain." 
</P>
<P>
The rainy weather brought cooler-than-average temperatures to the county, with 
the high in Santa Ana at 64 degrees and the high along the coast at 60. Winds 
in Newport Beach were reported Saturday evening at 15 m.p.h., and the evening 
temperatures along the coast dropped to the low 50s. 
</P>
<P>
In other incidents, the weather was blamed for a mudslide at 9:30 a.m. Saturday 
in Los Angeles County that temporarily blocked one lane of the Long Beach 
Freeway near Lakewood. It also caused a downed power line that left 1,600 
people on Los Angeles' Koreatown area and 800 in Encino without electricity for 
part of the day.

CROWS NEST IN CITIES' 'UNNATURAL FORESTS'; 
</P>
<P>
MISCHIEVOUS BIRDS THRIVE ALONGSIDE HUMANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eleven-year-old Paula Everett didn't intend to ruffle any feathers when she 
picked up a fledgling crow that had fallen out of its nest and began carrying 
it home to her mother, who nurses injured birds. 
</P>
<P>
But a flock of protective adult crows grabbed rocks from the gravel roof of a 
house and began dropping the stones on the girl's head. "Mom, the crows are 
throwing rocks at me," she complained when she ran into the house, recalled her 
mother, Judy Everett. 
</P>
<P>
The avian assault in the San Gabriel Valley illustrates a fact of modern life 
in America's cities. Big, black, loud, mischievous and intelligent, crows are 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taste for McDonald's 
</P>
<P>
The birds were once dynamited out of their roosts by the thousands. Now crows 
and their relatives are prospering as the uninvited guests of their historic 
enemy, man. 
</P>
<P>
While they haven't yet become the national bird of suburbia, crows seem 
ubiquitous in the unnatural "forests" around big cities, where they have 
developed a taste for McDonald's french fries, birthday cake and cat food. 
</P>
<P>
The crow population in California is growing a brisk 4% a year, according to 
the federal Breeding Bird Survey. Once shy of man, there are now thousands of 
crows in residential areas of Orange County and the San Fernando and San 
Gabriel valleys, according to expert estimates. 
</P>
<P>
"In Irvine we've gone from no crows" to the point where they are "one of our 
most common birds," said H. Lee Jones, a member of survey team for the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
Ravens, larger cousins of the crow and once thought to be in decline, are 
reproducing so rapidly in Southern California that biologists want to poison or 
shoot them to save the desert tortoise. Audubon Society volunteers counted 293 
ravens, once a rare sight, in the Malibu area in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"The population is exploding. It's kind of like Bangladesh," said Dan Taylor, 
western regional representative for the National Audubon Society in Sacramento. 
Actually, while both species are increasing, California's crow population is 
growing a third faster than the human population in Bangladesh. 
</P>
<P>
Daryl Brun of Blue Diamond Growers in Sacramento said nut growers look forward 
to the arrival of crows at certain times of the year because they clean the 
trees of "mummies," worthless fruit that stays on the trees over the winter. 
But the crow population is accelerating so fast in the San Joaquin Valley -- 
13% a year -- that farmers are beginning to complain, according to Cosmo 
Insalaco, the Fresno County agricultural commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
The population boom parallels a growing appreciation of crows and ravens as 
eggheads of the feathered world. They learn faster than some monkeys and are 
able to use tools. An instructor at UC Davis published a paper several years 
ago in which he suggested that campus crows were purposely dropping walnuts on 
the road in front of cars, inventing the world's first gasoline-powered 
nutcrackers. 
</P>
<P>
A behavioral ecologist at UCLA who has observed 40 families of tagged birds in 
the San ernando Valley for 4 years thinks she has seen even more complex 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
"They have definite personalities, and they also have friends, and that's 
unheard of outside primates," said Carolee Caffrey, who is working toward a 
doctorate in crow behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Once upon a time, the shaggy-headed ravens were seen infrequently, picking over 
animal carcasses on the desert or in the mountains. Crows were found out in the 
country, harassing farmers, though often in big numbers. A flock estimated as 
big as 1 million destroyed a promising almond industry in Klickitat County, 
Wash., in 1926. 
</P>
<P>
Such attacks made man declare war on the birds. Communities began dynamiting 
the huge Midwestern roosts at night. In Illinois 40 years ago, 328,000 crows 
were killed before a flock abandoned its rural roost. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Drennan, editor of American Birds magazine, said crows migrated to cities 
after World War II. Bird experts suggest that laws against shooting guns within 
city limits may have contributed to the movement. Then in 1972, Mexico insisted 
that crows and their relatives in the corvidae family be added to the list of 
species protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which made the city streets 
safer than ever for the birds. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the messages we're getting is that crows are increasingly becoming 
birds of suburban and urban areas," said Charles Smith, director of Special 
Projects for the Laboratory of Ornithology at Cornell University in Ithaca, 
N.Y. "There are plenty of scraps for them from human activities, whether it's 
from the local McDonald's or the bakery." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Knight, an assistant professor at Colorado State University, found in 
1985 that when he approached the nests of urban crows, they simply sat there 
watching. Rural crows always took wing. Knight concluded, "Our results suggest 
that recent colonization of cities by nesting crows may be in part a response 
to different levels of persecution in urban and rural areas." 
</P>
<P>
The most reliable indicator of bird trends is the Breeding Bird Survey of the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, a census taken since 1965 in 25-mile corridors 
throughout the nation. The survey indicates that California's crow population 
has grown rapidly as suburbs expanded and new urban "woodlands" were created. 
</P>
<P>
The Audubon Society's annual Christmas Bird Count has tallied crows, ravens and 
other species for several decades. While some experts caution that it is 
subject to wide fluctuations based on the number of volunteers used and other 
things, the Audubon Society says the survey can reflect bird population trends. 
The Christmas Bird Count since 1946 in Orange County, which has seen a 
tremendous growth in human habitation, shows a steadily upward trend among 
crows. 
</P>
<P>
Once it was assumed that a large black bird in an urban area was a crow. "But 
now you can't say that anymore, because ravens are moving in," said Kristin 
Berry, a wildlife biologist for the Bureau of Land Management. They can now be 
seen nesting on buildings in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. raven population has grown 3% yearly for 2 decades. Ravens are 
becoming so numerous that wildlife officials have drafted a proposal calling 
for poisoning and, perhaps, shooting hundreds of them in the Mojave Desert to 
save the desert tortoise, which is proposed for federal protection as an 
endangered species. The shells of 250 young tortoises have been found around 
the nest of just one pair of ravens. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts fear the population explosion will damage other bird species. 
"It's going to go very hard on the songbirds," whose nests are raided by crows, 
said Lloyd Kiff, curator of Ornithology at the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Natural History. 
</P>
<P>
Other experts, however, said they have seen no evidence that urban crows are 
driving out other birds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looks Belie Brains 
</P>
<P>
Bird intelligence is a subject of debate. The fact that a meadowlark will 
attack a stuffed rival placed in its territory doesn't do much for its 
reputation. But Jones believes that "we don't give birds enough credit," in 
part because "they don't look very much like us." 
</P>
<P>
Recent studies are challenging assumptions that birds are simple creatures. A 
study of crow vocalization at the University of Maryland showed that the simple 
"caw" is used in a variety of ways to signal alert, approaching danger, alarm 
and all clear. Different social groups have different songs, and when new 
members join the group, the song changes. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to complex behavior, "we're finding out that we as humans don't 
have a corner on the market," said Cornell's Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Knight said crows often outscore dogs on learning tests. Humans might have a 
lot higher opinion of bird intelligence if the first work on birds had been 
done on crows instead of pigeons, Knight said.

COSTA MESA MAN, VICTIM OF VIRUS, TAKES HEART AS HE WAITS FOR ONE FROM DONOR 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until last summer, Raymond Smallcomb's life style was like that of many young 
Southern Californians who live near the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
When not taking classes at a community college, Smallcomb, 22, of Costa Mesa 
surfed and played two-man volleyball under the sunshine at Newport Beach, as 
yet not touched by the tragedy that had felled so many members of his family. 
</P>
<P>
For, although his mother and a sister died of an unknown virus that attacks the 
heart, Smallcomb appeared to be living a normal life, unaffected by the malady. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the guy who would take the largest wave and could get out of it no 
matter what," said his father, Thomas Smallcomb. 
</P>
<P>
With his son now facing a challenge more formidable than any wave he ever 
conquered, Smallcomb hopes that his son once again will find a way to "get out 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
As the same virus that claimed the life of his mother, sister and seven other 
blood relatives threatens now to take his own life, the younger Smallcomb waits 
for a new heart at a San Diego hospital, attached to a device that acts as an 
artificial heart outside of his body, providing oxygen to his blood and pumping 
it through his body. 
</P>
<P>
Each day as he waits, doctors say the situation can worsen as the odds for 
complications and infection increase. 
</P>
<P>
The signal that something was wrong came last summer, when his shortness of 
breath and general weakness provided the first signs that the same virus that 
has so devastatingly plagued his family had struck him, withering the left side 
of his once-healthy heart. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Smallcomb was taken to Sharp Memorial Hospital so his kidneys, 
pancreas and partly collapsed lung could be strengthened with the help of a 
machine called the acute ventricular assist device. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp Hospital has done transplants on 46 patients since 1983, said Judy 
Coburn, Sharp's transplant coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
Smallcomb is first on the list of 10 people waiting for heart transplants 
there, but a recent shortage of donors has made the need even more critical, 
Sharp officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Most patients on the list for donated hearts are not expected to live more than 
a few months. Because Smallcomb is the only patient on mechanical life support, 
he is scheduled to be the next recipient of a heart from a donor with type O 
blood. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the college student, whose 6-foot-4-inch frame now only holds 
120 pounds -- 60 pounds less than he once weighed -- passes his time visiting 
with his family from Costa Mesa and talking with nurses. When his family can't 
be with him, he watches videos of his nine brothers and sisters and their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
A visit Friday with his father, stepmother and younger sister on his 42nd day 
on the machine was much like previous ones. 
</P>
<P>
His stepmother, Amy, said that although the past 6 weeks have tempered 
Raymond's outlook on life, the wait for a donor has tested the entire family's 
faith and confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never forget a few weeks ago I said to him, 'What's going on in your 
head?' as he looked straight ahead, and he said, 'I don't know if I'm going to 
make it,' " she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Tears came frequently to his eyes during the early visits, she said, but since 
then doctors have told the family that Raymond may now be pulling out of a deep 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen tears in the last 2 weeks," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the machine has pumped oxygen-rich blood back into his failing organs, 
bringing them back up to strength, he remains isolated in intensive care, 
connected to the machine by an 8-foot line that acts, in his stepmother's 
words, "like an umbilical cord." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the family's ordeal nearly ended when the heart from a 17-year-old 
with type O blood became available after the youth was killed in a drive-by 
shooting in Southeast San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Smallcomb rushed down to the hospital after midnight March 18 to meet 
with doctors. But at 4 a.m., doctors told him that the potential replacement 
heart could not be stabilized, explaining that it had stopped beating as they 
attempted to transport it to the hospital for possible transplantation. 
</P>
<P>
But that incident -- and two others in which families of other potential donors 
asked doctors not to go through with the organ donation wishes of their dying 
relatives -- has not undermined the family's hope that a heart eventually will 
become available. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's made us more aware," said Thomas Smallcomb, whose entire family 
now has organ donor cards attached to their driver licenses. "We would hope 
that our family would be a recipient of a heart just like any other family, and 
we know that others after us will need them. We will be available to help 
others who come forward after us in any way we can." 
</P>
<P>
"Every day, you wake up thinking it is going to be the day," Amy added, 
referring to the uncertainty of the wait for a heart or the possibility of her 
stepson's death. 
</P>
<P>
"It could go either way."

NO LEADS DEVELOP IN ABDUCTION CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Placentia police said Saturday that they have no new leads on the abduction of 
a 65-year-old woman who was returned to anxious relatives Friday night, 7 hours 
after two men forced her into their van and sped away. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, Anelica Maria Perez, telephoned her family shortly before 9 p.m. 
from a fast-food restaurant in the City of Industry, where she told them her 
kidnapers had released her. 
</P>
<P>
Perez had been sweeping her front sidewalk at 3:12 p.m. Friday when the two men 
drove up and pulled her into the van, police and neighbors said.

COUNTY EVENTS ARE POSTPONED BECAUSE OF RAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rain caused the postponement of numerous Orange County athletic events 
scheduled for Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine tennis Coach Greg Patton called off play in the UC Irvine tennis 
tournament and rescheduled the matches for today. 
</P>
<P>
Patton spent most of the day shuffling back and forth between two phones in his 
office fielding calls from coaches regarding the final 19 matches. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a nightmare, I can't believe this (rain) is happening," said Patton. 
"It's going to be a marathon of tennis (Sunday). We're just going to be jamming 
all day." 
</P>
<P>
The contingency plan, provided rain does not interfere today, translates into a 
19-match schedule beginning at 7:15 a.m. The championship final is scheduled to 
begin at 1 p.m. at the UC Irvine tennis stadium. Other matches are scheduled to 
be played at the Newport Marriott, the Mesa Verde Tennis Club, the Balboa Bay 
Club, the Racquet Club of Irvine and Christ College Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
All games in the Pony softball tournament scheduled to be played Saturday at 
Cal State Fullerton were postponed until today. 
</P>
<P>
In the championship-round games, Cal State Fullerton, ranked No. 5 in the 
nation, will play Arizona, ranked No. 10, at 9:30 a.m. Akron plays Cal State 
Long Beach, ranked No. 11, also at 9:30. 
</P>
<P>
No. 3 Oklahoma State plays Cal Poly Pomona at 11 a.m., and No. 1 ranked Fresno 
State plays Texas A&amp;M, also at 11. 
</P>
<P>
Semifinal games are scheduled for 1 p.m. and the championship game is scheduled 
for 2:30 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
Also because of rain, the site of today's nonconference baseball game between 
UC Irvine and Minnesota has been changed from Irvine to Loyola Marymount, and 
the game will be played at 11 a.m. instead of noon. 
</P>
<P>
And the final games of the Saddleback College baseball tournament Saturday were 
canceled.

BROWN'S BACK IN FORM, NEW TIGER INJURED AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WOLF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LAKELAND, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It probably will come as no surprise to Padre fans to learn that third baseman 
Chris Brown has already suffered his first injury as a member of the Detroit 
Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Brown's back has been bothering him, and to those who have followed 
his career closely, the only question is: What will be next? 
</P>
<P>
The term nagging injury could have been coined for Brown. He had so many of 
them in his year and a half with the Padres that they couldn't wait to unload 
him. Just 26 days after the 1988 season ended, they found a buyer in the 
Tigers, who took him and another Padre flop -- first baseman/outfielder Keith 
Moreland -- for pitcher Walt Terrell. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from what Terrell is expected to do for the Padres and what Brown and 
Moreland didn't do for them, the deal may have been the steal of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, 27, has picked up where he left off in San Diego. His aching back has 
kept him out of five exhibition games and limited him to 37 at-bats. He has 
nine hits for a .243 average. 
</P>
<P>
(As an aside, Moreland is batting .073 -- three for 41 -- and hasn't had a hit 
in his last 22 at-bats.) 
</P>
<P>
Despite his shaky start, Brown has changed for the better in one respect this 
spring. Instead of pouting, he is upbeat. Even though he stretches his 
credibility a bit when he says, "There wasn't anything wrong with me last 
year." 
</P>
<P>
This might be a shock to Larry Bowa and Jack McKeon, the Padre managers who 
kept waiting for Brown to say he was ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
The log of Brown's 1988 injuries reads like something out of Ripley's "Believe 
It or Not." 
</P>
<P>
First, he suffered a bruised tooth when a ball bounced up and hit him in the 
mouth during batting practice. Then, he hurt his right thumb while landing a 
punch on teammate Marvell Wynne in a clubhouse brawl. Finally, he tripped while 
walking off the field, twisting his right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Both Bowa and McKeon were convinced that Brown was a malingerer. Before Bowa 
was fired on May 28, he told Brown, "Come to me when you can play." McKeon 
played Brown for a while but eventually gave up on him. 
</P>
<P>
Offering his version of what happened, Brown said, "Larry tried to get me to 
bat the way he batted, to use his stance. When everything didn't work his way, 
he started benching me. If I didn't get a hit, I didn't play the next day. 
Toward the end, Jack didn't play me either." 
</P>
<P>
Brown appeared in 80 games, batting 247 times and hitting .235. 
</P>
<P>
Just two years earlier, Brown hit .317 for the San Francisco Giants and played 
in the All-Star Game. But he was injured twice by pitched balls in 1987, 
suffering a broken jaw while with the Giants and a broken right hand after 
being traded to the Padres. Since then, his career has gone downhill. 
</P>
<P>
Brown spent 63 days on the disabled list in 1987 but, strangely, none at all 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Talking like a man with new determination, Brown said, "I want to shake the 
reputation everybody put on me in San Diego and San Francisco. I think I'll get 
a better chance in Detroit. Working with weights, I've got my strength up, and 
my body fat is lower than it's ever been. I seem to get stronger and stronger." 
</P>
<P>
Of his new manager, Sparky Anderson, Brown said, "I know he has confidence in 
me. That makes me feel more relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson confirmed Brown's last statement both in words and action last week. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll be my third baseman," he said. "There's no choice there. He's the man." 
</P>
<P>
He backed that up Thursday when he traded Tom Brookens, the Tigers' regular 
third baseman last year, to the New York Yankees for pitcher Charles Hudson and 
dealt Luis Salazar, who also can play third, to the Padres for shortstop Mike 
Brumley. 
</P>
<P>
Brookens, 35, hit just .243 with five home runs last season. Anderson wants 
more sock at the position. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said it didn't matter who he was competing against for a starting spot. 
</P>
<P>
"It's Chris Brown against Chris Brown," he said. "If I play every day, 
everything will take care of itself."

NEW ERA FOR LAUNCH VEHICLE MARKETPLACE LIFTING OFF WITH MCDONNELL DOUGLAS' 
DELTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID OLMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If all goes as planned, a Delta rocket will blast off from Cape Canaveral in 
Florida this spring, sending into space the first payload of the nation's 
fledgling commercial satellite-launching industry. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas, manufacturer of the Delta, plans to mark the May 31 launch 
with a public relations bash aimed at wooing customers and winning political 
support for the U.S. industry. The aerospace giant plans to bring in members of 
Congress and customers from around the world to witness the launch, and company 
executives are counting on the reliable Delta to perform according to script. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of attention on this launch," said Louis Raburn, general manager 
of McDonnell Douglas' Delta program in Huntington Beach. "It's a revival of the 
launch vehicle marketplace. And it's also the first step toward the 
commercialization of space." 
</P>
<P>
The commercial launch market is an outgrowth of the 1986 Challenger space 
shuttle disaster that led President Reagan to retire the shuttle from 
commercial-launching duties -- which mostly involve putting communications 
satellites in orbit -- and to encourage development of a private space industry 
using unmanned, expendable rockets. 
</P>
<P>
The United States was caught without a ready supply of alternative launchers 
because rocket makers had shut down their production lines years earlier when 
the government designated the shuttle, operated by the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration, as the nation's only launcher for both commercial and 
military satellites. It has taken the U.S. manufacturers -- McDonnell Douglas, 
General Dynamics and Martin Marietta -- about 3 years to modify their existing 
rockets for the commercial market and to get their production lines rolling 
again. 
</P>
<P>
The launch is an important milestone for the Orange County operations of 
McDonnell Douglas, which has several hundred people working on the Delta 
program. Each commercial launch contract is worth about $50 million to the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
However, even as McDonnell Douglas prepares for its inaugural commercial 
launch, the American rocket industry is facing serious problems because of 
increasing foreign competition and a market that is sputtering before takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
"There are too many rockets and not enough satellites," said John E. Pike, a 
space policy analyst for the Federation of American Scientists in Washington. 
"The optimistic vision that people had of the commercial rocket business a 
couple of years ago isn't going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
About 20 satellites a year, on average, will be launched through the early 
1990s, according to various industry forecasts. With each launch contract worth 
between $40 million and $60 million, the annual worldwide market is valued at 
roughly $1 billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
Although a $1-billion business is significant, industry executives are less 
encouraged by forecasts of little or no growth in the market through the 1990s. 
With more competitors joining the field, there will be less business to go 
around. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the soft market is that satellite customers, such as telephone 
companies, are booking fewer launches. Much of the telecommunications traffic 
that used to travel by satellite links now is being carried by ground-based 
fiber-optic networks. And new satellite uses that might give a boost to the 
market -- for example, direct broadcast of television programs to homes with 
satellite dishes -- have not caught on in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the new generation of satellites is expected to remain in operation 
longer, perhaps 10 years or more, meaning fewer launches to send up replacement 
hardware. 
</P>
<P>
Another threat to the U.S. rocket industry, company executives say, comes from 
foreign competitors whose launch programs are subsidized by governments. These 
subsidies enable foreign rivals to market their services below cost, the 
Americans say, making it difficult for the American manufacturers to compete. 
</P>
<P>
Arianespace, the chief foreign competitor, receives its funds for product 
research and development from the European Space Agency, while American 
companies must fund those costs on their own, said Dennis R. Dunbar, managing 
director of General Dynamics Commercial Launch Services in San Diego. "We're 
carrying a $5-million to $10-million-per-unit price disadvantage because we 
need to recover that investment," Dunbar said. 
</P>
<P>
Arianespace is a 13-member, French-based consortium set up by the European 
Space Agency in 1980 to market launches to satellite customers. The consortium 
has launched 29 commercial satellites and claims more than half the world 
market for launches. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Subsidy Issue 
</P>
<P>
Arianespace officials say American complaints about unfair subsidies are 
unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
"The subsidy claim is a red herring and always will be," said Doug A. Heydon, 
president of Arianespace's U.S. marketing subsidiary. "Since our company was 
formed 9 years ago, we have been totally responsible for all our operating 
costs." 
</P>
<P>
Arianespace began its business in 1980 by competing with the U.S. space shuttle 
and had the market virtually to itself after the Challenger accident grounded 
the American-satellite launching business. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its current leadership position, Arianespace has the most to lose of 
any of the rocket makers from increasing competition in the market. Unlike its 
American competitors, which have large military launch contracts, Arianespace 
is totally dependent on commercial business. The French-based company produces 
rockets that compete with all three U.S. producers. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lost business to all three of the U.S. companies," Heydon said. "We've 
also lost to (China). But that's part of the game." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Upset Over China 
</P>
<P>
Arianespace's biggest problem, Heydon said, is the weakened condition of the 
U.S. dollar. He said the cost of the Ariane to U.S. customers has risen 70% in 
4 years. 
</P>
<P>
But both European and American rocket makers share a bad case of pre-launch 
jitters about the potential competition from China and the Soviet Union. 
Analysts say the Chinese and Soviets are likely to heavily subsidize their 
launch businesses to gain international prestige and foreign currency. 
</P>
<P>
"The introduction of the Chinese Long March (rocket) and, ultimately, the 
Soviet Proton will serve to make the market more unpleasant," Heydon said. "I 
don't think there is adequate business to support all these people in the 
commercial business." 
</P>
<P>
Industry executives were upset with the Reagan Administration's decision last 
fall to relax export restrictions and allow China to launch three Hughes 
Aircraft satellites aboard the Long March. In January, China signed its first 
commercial contract to launch a Western-built satellite -- a $30-million deal 
for a 1990 launch of the telecommunications satellite Asiasat 1. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very disappointed in the Administration's decision to allow the 
Chinese to enter the market," said General Dynamics' Dunbar. "It contradicts 
the government's objective of having a strong domestic rocket industry." 
</P>
<P>
Under the U.S.-China trade agreement signed in January, the Chinese are limited 
to nine launches during the next 6 years and are supposed to offer their 
services for prices comparable to Western companies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Soviet Effort Stymied 
</P>
<P>
But Western executives complain that the Chinese are already violating the 
trade accord. One industry executive said they recently won a launch contract 
with Aussat, the Australian satellite authority, by bidding less than one-third 
the price of its Western rivals. 
</P>
<P>
John M. Logsdon, director of George Washington University's Space Policy 
Institute, believes that the Chinese will play a role in the commercial market. 
"But the notion that they'll take a significant market share from the United 
States and Europe is not very plausible" because of restrictions limiting the 
number of Chinese launches. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Soviets have been actively marketing their Proton rocket for about 
2 years, they have been stymied by a U.S. law that prohibits Soviet launches of 
satellites with American technology. Virtually all satellites launched outside 
the Soviet Bloc incorporate American technology. 
</P>
<P>
"If there are no constraints placed on the Chinese or Soviets, we won't be in 
the commercial launch business," said Roger Chamberlin, vice president in 
charge of Martin Marietta's commercial Titan program. "We have no desire to 
sell vehicles at a loss." 
</P>
<P>
But industry observers say other nations eventually will be able to develop 
satellites without the benefit of American technology. In order to break into 
the commercial market, the Soviets may provide technical assistance to nations 
that want to develop a satellite business, said William B. Wirin, vice 
president of Space Commerce, a 2-year-old Houston company formed as a joint 
venture with the Soviets to market the Proton. 
</P>
<P>
"We will go to countries that want to develop satellites and help them do so," 
said Wirin, a former chief attorney for the U.S. Air Force Space Command. "We 
will look to the Third World countries and try to help them lower their cost of 
launches. If you bring down the cost of communications, you will create a 
requirement for many more launches." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets believe that they can market the Proton to developing nations at 
half the world market price, Wirin said, "and still make a handsome profit." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Modifications 
</P>
<P>
Still another potential competitor, Japan, is expected to make its move into 
the commercial business in the early 1990s. Under a license agreement with the 
U.S. government, the Japanese acquired technology used in McDonnell Douglas' 
Delta rocket and have been developing a launch system called the H-2. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese are not saying much publicly, but it is obviously their intent to 
be a major player in the space transport game," said an official with the 
Office of Space Commerce, a Commerce Department agency. Industry observers say 
the Japanese have improved upon the Delta's second-stage engine -- the 
mid-stage engine that puts the satellite into an elliptical orbit. McDonnell 
Douglas is now mulling the possibility of obtaining the enhanced booster 
technology under license from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
All three U.S. rockets, the McDonnell Douglas Delta, General Dynamics Atlas and 
Martin Marietta Titan, are descendants of ballistic missiles developed in the 
1950s and 1960s. They have been modified various times throughout the years for 
different missions. 
</P>
<P>
After a 2 1/2-year shutdown, McDonnell Douglas Space Systems of Huntington 
Beach reopened its Delta production line in January, 1987. The contract that 
put the Delta back in business was a military rather than commercial order. The 
company received an Air Force order valued at nearly $1 billion to build 20 
Deltas for launching military satellites that would have gone up on the space 
shuttle had it not been for the Challenger accident. 
</P>
<P>
On the commercial side, McDonnell Douglas has nine orders for its Delta rockets 
valued at $500 million. The company's first launch in May will carry a 
communications satellite for the government of India. 
</P>
<P>
General Dynamics Space Systems in San Diego, manufacturer of the Atlas launch 
vehicle, has four firm commercial orders. The first launch will be early next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Marietta Commercial Titan Systems in Denver has five contracts for 
launches of its Titan rocket, with a value of $500 million. Its first launch is 
scheduled for the third quarter of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The three rocket makers generally compete for different pieces of the market 
because their launchers vary in the size of payloads they can carry into space. 
The Titan rocket, the largest of the three launchers, is capable of lifting 
more than 11,000 pounds into geosynchronous transfer orbit -- which is where 
most communications satellites are placed. General Dynamics' Atlas, with a lift 
capability of 6,000 pounds, is next in size, and the Delta is the smallest with 
a maximum payload of 4,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Some doubt that the commercial market can support three U.S. rocket makers. 
</P>
<P>
None of the three would be seriously hurt if it was squeezed out of the 
commercial market. McDonnell Douglas, General Dynamics and Martin Marietta are 
all major aerospace and defense contractors with substantial resources. 
Moreover, the American companies have large government contracts to launch 
satellites for the military and other federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department has on order 37 Titan, 20 Delta and 11 Atlas rockets. 
Those contracts have a total value of about $6.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the American rocket makers say they would like to recoup their 
investments in the commercial market, which totals about $500 million among the 
three companies. 
</P>
<P>
Pike, the Federation of American Scientists analyst, said increasing 
competition in the market may make it difficult for the U.S. firms to earn a 
profit. He argues that there is insufficient business to support three U.S. 
rocket makers and that without military contracts one or more of the firms 
would probably be out of the business. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. General Dynamics, for example, probably could not compete in the 
commercial business had it not won the Air Force business, he said. Last year, 
the company won Air Force contracts valued at $171 million for three Atlas 
rockets, with options for eight additional rockets. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that decision was taken simply for keeping General Dynamics in the 
rocket business," Pike said. "The rational decision would have been to keep the 
Delta and Titan and tell the Atlas to go to the Smithsonian."

CROWDED LUXURY IMPORT MARKET GIRDS FOR BRUISING CAR CAMPAIGNS

<P>
Two Japanese players revving up for entry into the crowded field of $20,000 to 
$40,000 luxury cars in the United States are on a collision course with 
European makers for a share of the growing upscale segment. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, auto industry analysts predict some foreign competitors could get 
severely bruised in one of the most lucrative markets in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"Neutral country attacks Germany and Japan," says an advertising campaign 
recently started by Saab-Scania of America, fighting to keep the Swedish auto 
maker's spot in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Peugeot Motors of America, with its roots in France, also is cranking up a new 
campaign and has offered dealers incentives they can pass to customers. 
</P>
<P>
Britain's Sterling Motor Cars meanwhile is restructuring its entire U.S. 
marketing, service and parts plan to slow a sales skid. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are seeing happen is that a lot of the European manufacturers who have 
taken their niche for granted have realized all of a sudden that it's not a 
guarantee," said auto-industry analyst Jeannette Garretty of the Bank of 
America in San Francisco. "The prevailing attitude has been that there is a 
Saab buyer, a Mercedes buyer who will always be there." 
</P>
<P>
That's been changing. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. sales for 14 European-made cars last year were 16.4% behind 1987 levels, 
led by Audi's 44.7% tumble and Sterling's sales dip of 37.9%. During the same 
time, sales of all imported cars dropped 4%. 
</P>
<P>
European cars made up 5.5% of the entire U.S. car market in 1988, down from 
6.8% the year before. 
</P>
<P>
The fiercest competition promises to be among the expensive, relatively 
low-volume European imports, including Saab, Peugeot, Sterling, BMW, 
Mercedes-Benz, Volvo and Audi. Some analysts wonder how those companies will 
fare in the scrap over the market pie. 
</P>
<P>
"We have dealers saying this is the most competitive time they've ever faced," 
said Tony Kirton, director of marketing for Audi of America. "They often say 
that, but this time I believe them." 
</P>
<P>
Besides watching each other, European makers are scrutinizing the latest wave 
in the Japanese invasion of the United States car market -- Toyota's Lexus and 
Nissan's Infiniti luxury car divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the Japanese auto makers plan to begin selling two models this fall. 
The Lexus cars are expected to cost between $20,000 and $35,000. Infiniti's 
prices will range from $25,000 to around $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
That wedges them into the market now divvied up by Volvo, Saab, Peugeot, 
Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Sterling and Audi. The Japanese makers have said their 
target with Infiniti and Lexus principally is the European competition, not the 
few U.S. entries from General Motors' Cadillac and Ford's Lincoln-Mercury 
divisions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they will get off to a pretty good start," said auto analyst David 
Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert of New York. "The names of the companies are 
known. These guys have deep pockets and a lot of patience.

"I think we can count on the fact that it will be a pretty good product."

Saab's U.S. president, Bob Sinclair, disagrees.

"The Japanese are moving upscale, and that's a very significant move," he said. 
"They're reliable, but they're bland and look basically alike."

Japan's move into the luxury import segment, challenging the Europeans, began 
in March, 1986, with Honda's Acura division. In 1988, sales for the division 
rose 16.5% over the year before. By volume, Acura sold more cars last year than 
did all European imports except Volkswagen. Division spokesman Mike Spencer 
said Honda is counting on Acura's sales to increase 15% to 20% this model year.

Auto makers and analysts predict the luxury-performance segment of the car 
market will grow during the next year, partly reflecting the financial success 
of the baby-boom generation. Nonetheless, there's still concern whether it will 
grow enough for everybody to survive.

"We're really fortunate we've had a 3 1/2-year head start in that segment," 
Spencer said. 
</P>
<P>
Acura will remain strong in the market, Garretty said, because of established 
reputation. It's priced lower than most of the Europeans and what's expected 
for Lexus and Infiniti. Acura's prices are more in line with Saab's.

"They (Saab) do have reason to be concerned," said analyst Kathleen Heaney of 
Nikko Securities Co. International of New York. "Saab is more of a cult 
following. People either love it or hate it," she added. "Saab is one of those 
companies which is stuck in no man's land."

Healy agreed and wondered about the future of Saab and Peugeot in the United 
States. Peugeot has a much smaller U.S. presence than Saab -- selling about 
two-thirds as many cars last year -- but its European automobile operations are 
stronger, Healy said.

<P>
So, Saab has decided to take off the gloves in its advertising in an attempt to 
make its name better known in the United States.

"I think it's the old story about the farmer with the mule. First you have to 
get its attention," Sinclair said. "We thought we should throw bombs and hand 
grenades to get their attention."
