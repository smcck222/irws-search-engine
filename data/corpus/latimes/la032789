'MOUNTAIN MANEUVERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial "Mountain Maneuvers" (March 4) has to give your readers concern 
about your views of the proper role that local government should play in the 
acquisition of lands for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
Stripped to its essentials, The Times is advocating that in this case, the 
county should have used its zoning powers to restrict the use of private 
property so that the National Park Service could buy it more cheaply for the 
park. Knowing that this would be both illegal and unethical, and knowing that 
county counsel so advised the board, The Times nonetheless argues that we could 
have gotten away with it if we tried hard enough. That is outrageous! 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere in the editorial was there any discussion of the merits of the proposed 
project. No mention was made that existing zoning originally would have 
permitted as many as 2,500 homes. No mention was made that when I took office 
in late 1980, the current General Plan would have permitted up to 234 homes on 
the property and that in 1981 the board, on my motion, voted to adopt an 
Areawide General Plan that further reduced the allowable densities on the 
property. No mention was made that the board's action on March 2 simply 
corrected this error while retaining the property in a rural classification. 
</P>
<P>
No mention is made that prior to approving the project, we made several changes 
to the design, such as requiring the applicant to delete developable lots so 
that a continuous and substantial open-space buffer would be provided along the 
entire southern border with the park. Nor do you acknowledge that this project 
of less than one home per two acres is very similar to other existing 
developments in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is that when I first took office in 1980, the property could 
have been developed to as many as 234 homes. Today it is limited to only 150, 
or less than two-thirds of the 1980 allowance. 
</P>
<P>
The Times would better serve its readers if it spoke out on the meager funding 
provided by Congress each year to fund the acquisition if it truly was 
concerned about the future of the park. I wonder whether The Times would 
support the down-zoning of its Tejon Ranch property if it should be sought in 
the future as a federal park. I wonder.

'SAVING THE EARTH'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Larry Stammer's report from London, "Saving the Earth: Who Sacrifices?" (Part 
I, March 13) and the editorial "A Truce With Nature" on the same day give a 
dire prognosis on the state of the Earth's health. Hopefully, such information 
will help arouse the consciousness of people as to the sacrifices it will be 
necessary for us all to make if we are to survive. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder, do we stand by and watch our magnificent planet and all the life it 
holds being destroyed in the same manner we have allowed the continuation of 
the building of nuclear weapons, spending billions and billions of dollars each 
year while people starve and our Earth suffers?

The story asks, "Will U.S. consumers do without air conditioners in new cars?" 
This sacrifice to save the planet from further destruction. Probably not. 
</P>
<P>
But will U.S. citizens put up with no shelter for the homeless, inadequate 
health care for the poor and elderly, failing savings and loans, decaying inner 
cities, pollution, etc., etc.? Will we pay more than a billion dollars every 
working day for "defense?" You betcha!

A careful reading of Stammer's excellent stories from London on the 
international meeting to deal with new atmospheric ozone problems suggests that 
U.S. and world environmentalists have their work cut out for them in persuading 
world leaders, including President Bush, to stop pouring chlorofluorocarbons 
and halons into the air. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's endorsement of speeding-up the phase-out of ozone-destroying chemicals 
contained a giant loophole -- a ban on CFCs by the turn of the century "if safe 
alternatives can be developed." 
</P>
<P>
This is a naive and totally misleading view. The world has no alternatives. All 
nations must end the use of CFCs and halons (a chemical used in fire 
suppressants) or face a health-threatening and environmental-threatening global 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The destruction of the ozone shield by industrial chemicals is now an 
established, proven scientific fact. 
</P>
<P>
Stammer reported that recent findings by scientists show "there are enough 
chemical pollutants in the Arctic to deplete the ozone layer there at the 
staggering rate of 1% a day if climatic conditions are right." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush's wishy-washy "support" for a ban on ozone destroyers will not 
persuade Third World foot draggers to go along with the industrialized world 
when their economic development is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William K. Reilly, who knows 
the score on chlorofluorocarbons, is going to have to assemble our top 
atmospheric scientists and go have a talk with Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Europe must lead the way on this issue. It's a matter of life and 
death.

EVEN AS WE TIE THE KNOT TIGHTER, NUCLEAR POWER REMAINS UNGOVERNABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK READER, Mark Reader is an associate professor of political science at 
Arizona State University and co-author of Atom's Eve: Ending the Nuclear Age, 
(McGraw-Hill, 1980). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The prime difficulty with nuclear power today is the same as it was before the 
Three Mile Island reactor accident 10 years ago. A radiation-producing energy 
source is simply ungovernable by any ordinary human measure. 
</P>
<P>
This is true whether one thinks about fission-produced electricity or bombs. 
</P>
<P>
As events in recent years remind us, nuclear reactors are not immaculately 
conceived. Whether part of a larger radiation-producing fuel or weapons cycle, 
the 700 research and commercial reactors currently in operation throughout the 
world create a number of critical health and environmental hazards that 
simultaneously demand, and yet resist, human solution. 
</P>
<P>
Several challenges arise for a society dependent on the fissioned atom. As the 
nuclear industry expands, we have to find a way to protect more of the Earth's 
limited fresh water supplies and arable land from radioactive contamination. We 
must insulate ever-changing social and ecological systems from unwanted 
interactions with dangerous and centuries-old radioactive wastes. We have to 
find a way to offset the many physical- and mental-health problems that emerge 
in the aftermath of "unscheduled" releases of radioactive materials anywhere 
along the overlapping nuclear fuel and arms networks. We need to ask if there 
is a way to justify to an increasingly skeptical public the morality of 
randomly passing on cancer deaths and/or radiation-related birth defects to 
innocent persons over the generations. We must reduce the often disastrous 
consequences of human error within the nuclear weapons and fuel systems without 
deeding life-or-death decisions to equally fallible, and often less flexible, 
computers. We need to halt the spread of proliferation of thermonuclear and 
biochemical weapons, as well as the anti-democratic imperatives they engender, 
by severing atomic weapons from the commercial atomic-power industries. 
</P>
<P>
Even if we manage to accomplish all that, can we shield nuclear critics from 
economic and political reprisals so that their frequently well-placed warnings 
of radiation danger can be used to forestall predictable disasters? 
</P>
<P>
Quite evidently, each of these problems has been aggravated in the years since 
the radiation accidents at Three Mile Island and, more recently, Chernobyl. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the opening months of 1989 carry with them ominous signs of humanity's 
deepening nuclear bondage. There are many examples: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Soviet press reports a doubling of cancer rates among adults and of 
thyroid illnesses among more than half of the children in the Chernobyl damage 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 -- American and Soviet policy-makers are rushing to bring additional reactors 
on line and to introduce supposedly "melt-down-free" models for the 1990s. They 
hope to shore up their troubled economies and reduce acid rain and greenhouse 
effect problems posed by the burning of fossil fuels. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Radiation-related leaks at Hanford, Rocky Flats, Fernald and Savannah River 
are forcing the shutdown of major parts of the U.S. nuclear arms industry at an 
estimated on-site clean-up cost of at least $80 billion over the next 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Iran, Iraq and Libya seek to stockpile chemical weapons to offset Israel's 
strength and the West's nuclear superiority in that hapless region. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Technocrats are considering the launching of more and larger 
nuclear-powered satellites into Earth's orbit for military as well as 
scientific purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Respected environmental groups, like Worldwatch Institute, caution that the 
globe may be awash in plutonium by century's end as nations reprocess highly 
toxic spent reactor fuel to either extend their energy supplies and/or make 
atomic bombs. 
</P>
<P>
Tragically, we have not yet learned that the threats of nuclear war and 
radiation accident require us to control the potentially devastating 
properties. In order to guard against nuclear accident or war, we have divided 
the human community into nuclear "haves" and "have nots." This division itself 
has given rise to the very conflicts that must be avoided if serious nuclear 
breakdowns are to be prevented. 
</P>
<P>
The need to resolve this seemingly fatal paradox has been at the heart of those 
tragedies already experienced in the nuclear age. The paradox is complicated by 
the fact that radiation accidents of the kind first experienced at Three Mile 
Island remind people of their own complicity in the making and maintenance of a 
world that neither they nor their children can sustain or endure. 
</P>
<P>
These accidents tell people that in return for the Faustian promise of an 
infinite supply of energy, wealth and military security, they must saddle their 
children with a highly versatile radiation killer. 
</P>
<P>
And so, a decade after what might have been the beginning-of-the-end of the 
nuclear age, humanity slips deeper into its common nuclear nightmare, 
humiliated into accepting the rule of a lawless nuclear elite that it 
alternately worships and dreads. 
</P>
<P>
But matters could be otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Were people honest about it, they might admit that their newly proclaimed 
search for a safer and cleaner environment will come to little unless they 
change their habit of valuing convenient consumption over conservation. 
</P>
<P>
Taking Einstein's injunction seriously -- that we need to change our mode of 
thinking to survive the Atomic Age -- probably requires us to abandon the 
nuclear game entirely and to link the quest for nuclear disarmament to the 
delivery of safe and ecologically sound energy systems. 
</P>
<P>
It would seem the only way out of the world's mounting nuclear dilemma is to 
cut the Gordian knot, as did a young Alexander, thereby announcing the passing 
of the old and the beginning of a new global economic and political order.

THERE WERE TWO SIDES TO ARGENTINA'S 'DIRTY WAR,' AND BOTH ARE STIRRING ANEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM RATLIFF, William Ratliff, a senior research fellow at the Hoover 
Institution, Stanford University, visited Argentina in the 1970s and twice 
during the last two years. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 20 years Argentines have been grappling with two of human history's great 
vices: the banality of evil and the evil of banality. 
</P>
<P>
Recent events have brought flashbacks of the "dirty war" of the 1970s, the 
civil conflict that thrust these two vices on the nation. It was a decade that 
Argentines have not yet been able to fully come to grips with and move beyond. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in this presidential election year, the fallout from that war still 
poses a threat to the democratic process in Argentina. Two weeks ago, Foreign 
Minister Dante Caputo warned that "hawks" in the military are planning a coup 
attempt, the fourth in two years, against President Raul Alfonsin. 
</P>
<P>
In late January, 40 heavily armed guerrillas with links to the leftist 
terrorists of the 1970s blasted their way into a military base near Buenos 
Aires, hoping to steal weapons for use in the next uprising. They failed, but 
36 people -- soldiers and guerrillas -- were killed. Another, smaller attack 
occurred at a provincial outpost in February, and the terrorists have pledged 
to strike again. 
</P>
<P>
The flashback compels all who seek true solutions to Argentina's problems to be 
more balanced and realistic in their evaluations of the "dirty war" -- both its 
causes and its continuing repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
Two casts played out the banality of evil in the conflict of the 1970s: the 
military and the guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
But most commentators, especially abroad, have zeroed in only on the military. 
</P>
<P>
Before and after the coup that threw out a hopelessly inept Peronist government 
in 1976, some officers routinely tortured and murdered Argentines they thought 
were guerrillas or sympathetic to Marxist terrorists in the country. Thousands 
of Argentines died in custody and thousands more simply "disappeared." 
</P>
<P>
But, put in the most direct of terms, the guerrillas started the violence, as 
newspaper editor Jacobo Timerman, who was himself jailed by the military, wrote 
in his "Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a Number." Those guilty of the 
evil of banality don't seem to grasp this fact and its meaning. 
</P>
<P>
The violence that ultimately provoked the 1976 coup began in 1964, Timerman 
wrote, "with the appearance of the first guerrillas, trained in Cuba." By the 
early 1970s, "the eroticism of violence" meant daily kidnapings and murder by 
large and small groups. "Systemized violence" then swept the country, so that 
"when the army seized the government, the entire country . . . breathed a sign 
of relief." 
</P>
<P>
The People's Revolutionary Army, one of the two main terrorist groups whose 
remnants were involved in the recent guerrilla attacks, had openly stated that 
its goal was to make Argentina part of a "Vietnam" engulfing all of Latin 
America. The military, which had no historical record of unusual brutality, 
sought to prevent the terrorists from bringing this conflagration about. It did 
so with the "dirty war." 
</P>
<P>
In a way, it worked. Neither Alfonsin nor anyone else would have been elected 
president of Argentina if the guerrillas had won. If Alfonsin survives until 
the presidential election in May, he will be the first president since 1928 to 
complete his constitutional term in office. 
</P>
<P>
Most or all of these complexities are ignored or discounted by those guilty of 
the evil of banality. Terrible simplifiers all, they moralize in blacks and 
whites, drawing a caricature of a vast national tragedy in Argentina and in 
other nations as well, from El Salvador to Colombia to Peru. 
</P>
<P>
The true story of Argentina, and of other countries then and now, is far more 
complex and deeply tragic. It is of a troubled nation generating political 
extremists who introduce and escalate a barbarity that is equaled or topped by 
government authorities putting it down. 
</P>
<P>
This falsifying of history, which makes it impossible to find solutions to real 
problems, is seen with striking clarity in much of the media, trendy history 
and literature and the activities of some human-rights organizations. Take 
Lawrence Thornton's recent and much-praised novel, "Imagining Argentina." This 
writer, like so many others, seems to think that Argentine history began when 
the military took over and that only military brutality matters. How ironic 
that he has his characters working for Timerman's paper, yet they haven't a 
hint of the historical perspective that makes "Prisoner Without a Name" an 
important historical document. Even though part of "Imagining" is true, the 
context is so warped that it ends up a pernicious political tract. 
</P>
<P>
Many nations will watch to see if the Argentines can put aside ignorant and 
self-righteous moralizing, recognize the moral ambiguities and complexities, 
and respond as civilized people to an era when barbarity bred barbarity. 
</P>
<P>
If the Argentines rise to the challenge, a precedent of sorts will be set. This 
precedent must note the duty of governments to serve their people to the limits 
of their resources and thus to eliminate their seeing justification for 
terrorism. It also must reaffirm the duty of military forces to prevent 
terrorists from overthrowing governments and even entire societies, while 
setting limits to the tactics used. 
</P>
<P>
It is a daunting challenge. If they don't meet it, in time the successful coup 
will come in Argentina. What is more, when coups come in other countries, as 
they will in response to guerrilla terrorism, military forces will be reluctant 
to return power to democratic governments for fear of being punished for their 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
The best thing that armchair moralists and the rest of us foreigners can do is 
pray for the Argentines and then get off their backs as they struggle for a 
precedent in a world that admits few easy answers.

PRAYERFUL AND FESTIVE EVENTS MARK EASTER FOR MAN, BEAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern Californians celebrated the Easter weekend with prayers, blessings, 
charity and frivolity. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of worshipers dressed warmly for showers and gray clouds Sunday at 
the traditional Easter Sunrise service at the Hollywood Bowl, but were rewarded 
with blue skies. Dedicated to the victims of December's earthquake in Armenia, 
the ceremony featured an appearance by Archbishop Vatche Hovsepian of the 
Armenian Church of North America -- the first time in the event's 69 years that 
an Armenian churchman delivered the sermon. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers gathered on Skid Row to serve Easter meals to the homeless at 
shelters and missions. At the downtown Los Angeles Midnight Mission, more than 
3,000 homeless people were expected to partake in a meal of ham, candied yams, 
punch and apple pie. 
</P>
<P>
Some people cavorted in local parks or covered their heads in all manner of 
hats and bonnets. Penny Rubbert, 88, showed up for a party at St. Vincent's 
Hospital wearing a massive wheel topped with an assortment of food items. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a modern girl in a bonnet too hot to handle," said Rubbert, whose unusual 
headgear represented the hospital's Meals-On-Wheels program for the elderly.

YOUTH BAND FINDING IT HARDER TO KEEP TEMPO OF PAST HONORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The band marched proudly down Hollywood Boulevard. Looking crisp in their red, 
blue and gold uniforms, the young musicians launched into a rendition of 
"McNamara's Band," the piece they had practiced especially for the annual 
Greater Los Angeles Irish-American St. Patrick's Day Parade. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, nearly a fourth of the marchers lowered their instruments and stepped 
onto the sidewalk. Sauntering casually behind the crowd of onlookers they 
hovered a moment, then walked in a ragged group several blocks west before 
rejoining the parade. 
</P>
<P>
In the interim, the depleted columns still in the street marched smartly to the 
judges' stand, paused at attention in front of it and played an anthem, "That's 
the Spirit of Liberty," in brisk military style while a corps of young girls in 
short colorful skirts waved flags and a majorette twirled a baton. 
</P>
<P>
Thus the Long Beach Junior Concert Band, competing against 11 other musical 
groups in one of Southern California's many competitive parades, won another 
sweepstakes. But it won by fewer points than usual, said director Marvin 
Marker. And if those musicians had not dropped out, he said, the band would not 
have won at all. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Band in Decline 
</P>
<P>
For 37 years the group, officially composed of youths ages 12 to 21, has been a 
Long Beach institution and one of the region's handful of independent youth 
bands. Now it has fallen on hard times, experiencing, among other things, the 
loss of its regular rehearsal space and a dramatic decline in membership. 
</P>
<P>
To bolster sagging numbers, Marker recently invited band alumni to return to 
the fold. Because they are over 21, however, their presence during parade 
judging could lead to the group's disqualification. So when participating in 
parades, the alumni move off to the side during judging. 
</P>
<P>
"They are good teachers," Marker said of the 19 alumni and adult staff members 
who routinely march with the band's 51 regular musicians. They are also 
providing much-needed stability, he said, while the group seeks a permanent 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Marker founded the band in 1952, when he was a 16-year-old Wilson High School 
student. The initial idea, he says, was to create a way for student musicians 
to continue playing during summer vacations when school was out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hawaiian Shirts 
</P>
<P>
About 40 musical friends showed up for the first rehearsal, recalls Marker, now 
53. The group made its debut in that year's Westminster Fiesta Parade wearing 
Hawaiian shirts, and received such an enthusiastic response that it decided to 
remain together year-round. Three years later, after a fight for financial 
support, the band took the grand prize at a parade in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Marker says, the group has won more than 1,000 first-place or 
sweepstakes trophies. It averages about 65 parades, concerts and other shows a 
year in such diverse locations as Portland, Ore.; Prescott, Ariz., and Hawaii. 
In addition, he said, the band has been featured in television commercials and 
promotional videos, establishing a statewide reputation for excellence. 
</P>
<P>
For its first 20 years, Marker said, the band was a hobby supported by his work 
as a production manager at Disneyland. Since 1972, he said, he has been its 
full-time director and the only salaried member of its staff. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a wonderful entertainment band," said Ronnie Lomas, parade coordinator 
for Pageantry Productions, a Lynwood-based company that produces parades all 
over the state, including the recent Hollywood event. Lomas said she would rate 
the Long Beach Junior Concert Band as one of the top two marching bands on the 
West Coast. "They have showmanship," she said. "They don't just play at the 
judges' stand and march away; (Marker's) unit performs for the crowd." 
</P>
<P>
At its height in the late 1970s, Marker said, the band had 156 musicians and 45 
pageantry performers, including dancers and flag girls. 
</P>
<P>
Then came Proposition 13, which greatly reduced property taxes and diminished 
public school incomes. 
</P>
<P>
The group had been rehearsing at local high schools, but school officials began 
charging for the use of facilities. So the band -- an independent nonprofit 
entity operated on about $80,000 a year from fund-raisers, membership dues, 
corporate donations and an annual city stipend -- began meeting in unused 
buildings. They rehearsed in an abandoned fire station for the first two years, 
and later in a boys' club. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Marker said, the group moved its rehearsals to an abandoned warehouse 
at Spring Street and Pacific Avenue. But last year the warehouse was acquired 
by a new owner determined to redevelop the property. So for the last several 
months the band has been rehearsing at the Veterans Park Clubhouse on Pacific 
Avenue, a city-owned facility that is hosting the group for free. 
</P>
<P>
The only problem, Marker says, is that the 2,500-square-foot room is not big 
enough to meet the organization's wide-ranging musical needs. The group's 21 
dancers and flag girls practice on a patio. And its 13 drummers practice in a 
nearby kitchen by rapping their sticks on a wooden table rather than on their 
instruments with the band. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting twice a week, Marker says, the band has had to reduce its weekly 
practice time to a total of about four hours to allow time for setting up and 
breaking down equipment before and after rehearsals. 
</P>
<P>
One result of the instability is a nearly 30% decline in the number of 
musicians just in the last year, bringing band membership to 51 -- its lowest 
since shortly after the group was formed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Losing Championship Status 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the band is in danger of disappearing," Marker said, "but it is 
in danger of losing its championship status." 
</P>
<P>
While the group is still winning trophies, he said, it is winning them by fewer 
and fewer points. And last year for the first time in memory, he said, the band 
failed to win the sweepstakes in several of the parades it entered. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids in the junior concert band are on the street," Marker said, referring 
to their marching activities, "but they're there to do good. Everyone needs to 
be proud of something, and when these kids win they stand tall." 
</P>
<P>
To offset the downward trend, Marker recently began visiting local junior high 
schools in search of new members. While school bands sometimes compete with 
Marker's group in parades, they are generally supportive of it as a positive 
educational experience for their students, an attitude Marker encourages by 
insisting that his musicians give first priority to the needs of their school 
bands. 
</P>
<P>
And to provide some morale-boosting stability while his group searches for new 
quarters, Marker began inviting the alumni. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my second family," said Dave Ford, 25, a mail room clerk who plays 
saxophone. He first joined the junior concert band in 1979 at age 14. "It's an 
organization I've grown up in. Marvin Marker sort of raised me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Colleen Davis, 32, a Long Beach mother who was in the band from 1970 to 
1975 and recently returned to play glockenspiel: "I realized that the band had 
given me so much that I wanted to put something back. I want the band to be 
here for my son." 
</P>
<P>
Regular youth members seem to be taking the invasion in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"At times it's a problem," said Don La Plume, 20, leader of the band's trumpet 
section. "The alumni are very anxious to help, a little too anxious sometimes. 
Sometimes they think they have special privileges (such as ignoring 
directions), and then I have to put them in line."

LATINO CUSTOMS AGENTS BATTLE FOR BETTER JOB STATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H. G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alfonso Rivera, a criminal investigator with the U. S. Customs Service in San 
Diego, said he was tired of working for Anglo bosses with "an open-door policy 
and a closed mind." In January, he joined 10 other veteran Latino agents and 
inspectors from throughout the country in filing an unfair-discrimination 
lawsuit against the agency. 
</P>
<P>
Rivera, a 17-year veteran of the Customs Service, said "the policy of 
discrimination should have been challenged a long, long time ago." Five of the 
11 plaintiffs in the suit work in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Rivera, the plaintiffs include two other investigators working 
out of the San Diego office of the special agent in charge, and two inspectors 
who work at the Otay and San Ysidro ports of entry. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint, which was filed in U. S. District Court in Washington, alleges 
that, since about 1980, when the Reagan Administration took power, customs 
officials "have actively sought to reduce the number of Hispanic employees at 
upper-level management." 
</P>
<P>
As an example, attorneys for the agents and inspectors said that, in 1980, nine 
Latinos with a GS-15 job rating were working for the Customs Service. Now there 
are only three, they said. Of the 49 Senior Executive Service employees with 
the agency, none is Latino, the attorneys said. By contrast, 25% off all 
employees at entry-level positions are Latino, according to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
The Latino employees are represented by attorneys from the Mexican-American 
Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) office in Chicago. The complaint 
names 27 defendants, including Nicholas Brady, who, as secretary of the 
Treasury, administers the Customs Service; William Von Raab, commissioner of 
the Customs Service, and Quintin L. Villanueva Jr., regional commissioner for 
the Pacific region. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Shimkowski, customs spokesman in Washington, said officials will not 
comment on the lawsuit while it is pending. 
</P>
<P>
MALDEF attorney Ruben Castillo said the experiences and complaints of the 
Latino customs employees in San Diego are representative of the complaints 
heard from other Latinos throughout the country. He is waiting for the court to 
certify the complaint as a class-action lawsuit so MALDEF can represent the 
about 1,763 Latinos in the Customs Service, which has 15,632 employees, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rivera, 48, a Marine veteran of the Vietnam War, is especially vocal in his 
allegations of unfair treatment. Much of his criticism is directed at Kenneth 
Ingleby, special agent in charge of the Customs Service's San Diego office of 
criminal investigations. Ingleby, who is not named as a defendant in the 
lawsuit, failed to return several phone calls to his office. 
</P>
<P>
According to Rivera and others interviewed, Ingleby frequently displays favored 
treatment toward Anglo agents. They also said that, like other customs 
supervisors throughout the Southwest, supervisors in the San Diego office of 
criminal investigations use Spanish-speaking agents in ways that restrict their 
opportunities for promotion. 
</P>
<P>
Spanish-speaking agents said that being bilingual is often a liability rather 
than an asset. The lawsuit alleges that Latino agents are routinely assigned to 
mundane duties such as listening in on wiretaps involving Spanish-speaking 
defendants, rather than to cases that provide opportunities for career 
enhancement. 
</P>
<P>
"These (wiretap) assignments are involuntary, involve unusually long hours . . 
. and result in the reassignment of career-enhancing cases to non-Hispanic 
employees," the lawsuit says. " . . . The monitoring of Spanish-language 
wiretaps is not rewarded with benefits or promotions." 
</P>
<P>
"After the wiretap is done, you get an 'attaboy' letter and are sent home. . . 
. The Anglo agents get all the glory and are promoted," Rivera said. 
</P>
<P>
Customs employees said their hopes for a successful lawsuit were buoyed by a 
federal judge's ruling last fall in a similar suit brought by Latino FBI agents 
against that agency. After a lengthy trial, the judge ruled that the FBI 
systematically discriminated against Latino agents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many of Same Complaints 
</P>
<P>
In the suit, Latino FBI agents lodged many of the same complaints echoed by 
customs investigators and inspectors. They complained about being assigned to 
Spanish-language wiretap assignments, testifying that those assignments are 
among the most tedious for FBI agents. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the customs agents interviewed said they expect reprisals as a result 
of initiating the lawsuit. Richard Medina, an internal affairs supervisor 
working out of Ingleby's office, was recently transferred to Washington for 
temporary duty. Medina, who is a plaintiff in the suit and a critic of 
Ingleby's management style, was reassigned to Washington for 120 days for 
"attitudinal adjustment," said an Anglo agent who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
"All of these people in San Diego and elsewhere have a lot of courage putting 
their names on a lawsuit against their employer," said attorney Castillo. 
"Richard's transfer is the type of transfer that concerns us. We see a pattern 
of transfers like these, which are used to hurt the progression of Hispanics in 
the Customs Service." 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit also charges that Latinos are concentrated in "Hispanic areas" of 
the Southwest, Pacific Coast and the Southeast, namely Miami. It says that, 
while these three geographical areas account for 44% of the total customs work 
force, 83% of all Latino employees are assigned to the three areas. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos "are not considered for promotion in non-Hispanic areas" such as the U. 
S.-Canada border, the suit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Turned Down Twice 
</P>
<P>
Charles Mazon, 44 and a customs inspector supervisor at Otay Mesa, has worked 
for the agency 17 years and was the first Latino to be named port director at 
Tecate. He said he was twice rejected for promotions to jobs at the 
Washington-Canada border. On both occasions, the positions were filled by 
lower-ranking Anglo inspectors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"My first application was for a position at Port Angeles, Wash., where there 
was a vacancy for a GS-11 port director. It was a merit promotion; I was a 
GS-11 at the time . . . but I was not selected. A GS-9 inspector who was Anglo 
was selected instead," Mazon said. 
</P>
<P>
"The following year, in 1986, I applied for two GS-11 openings in Vancouver. I 
was up for GS-12 at the time, so I was willing to take the demotion. But I was 
bypassed again, and two lower-level inspectors were selected. One was Anglo, 
and I'm not sure about the other," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mazon said he filed two equal-employment-opportunity complaints with the 
Customs Service as a result of being turned down for the three positions, but 
has yet to hear from the agency. 
</P>
<P>
Mazon, who is looked to for leadership by other Latino customs inspectors at 
the San Ysidro and Otay ports, said each disappointment has left a bitter 
aftertaste with his family. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want special treatment. The only thing that we want is a fair shake. 
That's all we ask," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Anglo Support 
</P>
<P>
The agents and inspectors have received support from some Anglo colleagues, 
Mazon said, and some of them have offered to testify on their behalf. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gotten calls of support from Anglo agents in Denver and other places. 
There's a good possibility that some Anglo supervisors will testify for us," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Leslie, 50, is an equal-employment counselor for customs inspectors at the 
San Ysidro Port of Entry. The 16-year veteran of the Customs Service said he is 
working with district director Allan Rappoport to increase the number of Latino 
inspectors at San Ysidro. 
</P>
<P>
"We have almost 285 inspectors in San Ysidro, but only about 52 are Hispanic," 
Leslie said. 
</P>
<P>
The San Ysidro port was "full of bigotry" when he arrived in 1978, after 
serving at the Canal Zone, Leslie said. The dissatisfaction among Latino 
inspectors came to a head in 1983, when they banded together to file a 
class-action complaint with Rappoport. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1983, the port director promoted three Anglo supervisors, when the No. 1 
person on the list was an Hispanic," Leslie said. "When we complained, he told 
us that, if we wanted to get promoted, we could go work at the Calexico port," 
Leslie said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Troubled 
</P>
<P>
The Latino inspectors took their complaints to Rappoport, who subsequently 
agreed to promote three Latino supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Rappoport, who is not a defendant in the lawsuit, said he is not troubled by 
Mazon and Inspector Victor Sanchez's involvement in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"I know they're ventilating their concerns. . . . You're not going to make 
everybody happy all the time, so why take it personally? My own personal 
reputation is one who is not a biased person," Rappoport said. ". . . No group 
of people has come to me and told me there are serious problems here. . . . Our 
policy here is to recruit quality people, not just fill numbers. I try not to 
promote someone just because of race." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
30% Latino 
</P>
<P>
Rappoport said that, according to a recent in-house survey, 30% of all 
employees in his district are Latino. He also denied charges that Latinos are 
under-represented in the supervisorial ranks at the San Ysidro and Otay ports 
of entry. According to Rappoport's figures, two of the four GS-13 supervisors 
at both ports are Latinos, and four of 17 GS-12 supervisors, or 24%, are 
Latinos, as are nine of 39, or 23%, GS-11 employees. 
</P>
<P>
The total representation of Latinos in these ranks is higher than the 13.4% 
representation in the local civilian work force, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Castillo said that MALDEF's research shows that, more often than not, the 
Customs Service's employee-promotion policy "does not reflect what other 
agencies and companies are doing, namely promoting Hispanics into supervisorial 
and management roles." 
</P>
<P>
"We allege that this is intentional. It doesn't represent equal employment 
opportunity," said Castillo, a former federal prosecutor in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Subjected to Slurs 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Inspector Robert Ramirez, 42, a 13-year customs veteran, said Latino 
agents are commonly subjected to racial slurs from non-Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many comments made by my peers that really bother me. I've heard 
them say that we are nothing but greasers or dumb Mexicans," said Ramirez, who 
also works as a recruiter for customs inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
Still, not all Latino agents and inspectors are supporting the lawsuit. Rivera 
and Mazon said that at least one local man who was a party to the complaint is 
having second thoughts about proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
"They're dangling a carrot in front of him, promising him a promotion. Now he 
says that he doesn't want to do anything to hurt his chances of moving up," 
Rivera said. 
</P>
<P>
Other Latinos do not want to get involved because they are new employees and on 
probation, and still others are afraid of retribution, Mazon said. And many of 
the younger Latinos who are not part of the lawsuit "are afraid of what their 
Anglo friends are going to say about them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As an equal-employment counselor and veteran of many discrimination battles, 
Leslie said he is saddened by the younger agents' attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys are following in our footsteps," he said. "The pattern that we set 
now with this lawsuit is the pattern that they're going to follow. These guys 
don't realize that we're trying to open doors for them -- doors that have been 
closed to us for many years."

EASTER AT DRIVE-IN;

WORSHIPERS PREFER THE INFORMALITY OF SERVICE ON WHEELS

It was Easter Sunday service with a difference. Worshipers waved to each other 
from their cars, mostly late-model American sedans. In response to the 
preacher, they honked their horns. Many tuned in to the sermon on their vehicle 
radios, 540 on their AM dials. And, since this service was being held on the 
site of a drive-in movie theater, others monitored the preachers' words on the 
drive-in's speakers. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, they had the option of checking out the swap meet in the adjoining 
parking lot or trading in their vehicles at any of the nearby dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't want to get out of their cars, that's how this whole thing 
started," Phyllis Mosier was explaining as she checked off the numbers of 
vehicles attending Sunday's 9 a.m. service. "We had 58 cars the first Sunday 
this month, 53 the second. We had 32 at our Easter sunrise services this 
morning. It was beautiful. There must be another 50 or so cars here now." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pulpit on Back of Truck 
</P>
<P>
Since November, 1974, the Chula Vista Community Church has held Sunday services 
in the parking lot of the Harbor Drive-In Theater, near the National City line, 
at the south end of the celebrated "Mile of Cars," a seemingly endless series 
of dealerships and signs. The minister preaches to his flock from a pulpit 
fashioned in the back of a truck, a large cross providing the backdrop. 
Microphones hook up his words with the drive-in's speaker system and with the 
local radio station. Also amplified are religious tapes and music by the church 
pianist, who sits in the church truck. On Sunday, pots of lilies festooned the 
pulpit. The blank movie screen stood behind the site. 
</P>
<P>
The vision of worshipers praying in their Chevrolets and Plymouths, 
concentrating on a minister preaching from the back of a truck, is initially a 
bit jarring for those who have long associated organized religious worship with 
churches, temples and mosques, many lavishly designed and decorated. The 
setting can lead to some clashing images: A recent drive-in marquee featured a 
number of films, including a movie called "Unholy," above the sign advertising 
the drive-in church services. 
</P>
<P>
No matter. However bizarre it may appear, the drive-in worship concept is a 
logical and fairly well-rooted extension of America's fascination with the 
automobile (drive-in eateries, movies and funeral homes are long-established). 
And it does have an allure for many -- and not only in Southern California, 
where the notion seems almost emblematic. Such services have, in fact, been 
held for some time at scattered sites throughout the nation. (At one Michigan 
drive-in, a parishioner here noted, worshipers during winter months use 
portable heaters hooked to the speaker poles.) 
</P>
<P>
Why a drive-in church? A lot of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, many of the more than 100 or so worshipers each Sunday are 
elderly, infirm or disabled; the drive-in ceremony is accessible. Others speak 
of the ease of having their children in the back of the car and not having to 
worry about them screaming and upsetting other worshipers, or finding baby 
sitters. Smokers like being able to light up with their supplications. 
</P>
<P>
For others, though, some of whom drive her from as far away as Riverside, there 
are deeper reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people feel more comfortable; this has become their place," explained the 
Rev. Paul Veenstra, senior pastor of the Chula Vista Community Church, who 
performs the weekly service between ceremonies at the congregation's nearby 
community church. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Linked to Crystal Cathedral 
</P>
<P>
The Chula Vista church, of evangelical Christian beliefs, is a sister 
institution to the Crystal Cathedral Ministry of Robert Schuller, the noted 
"Hour of Power" televangelist who has also held such outdoor services. Rev. 
Veenstra, who is committed to the drive-in concept, says his outdoor sermon is 
the same as his in-church message, though he speaks of a special feeling among 
the drive-in congregation. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a congenial family atmosphere prevails at the service. The congregation 
of 100-150 at the drive-in session is mostly white, although a number of black 
families also attended. (The large area Latino population, mostly Roman 
Catholic, was not in evidence at the drive-in service.) Young and old alike 
were present. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, a need is filled. For those too intimidated or turned off to walk into 
a church, the drive-in option provides a relatively non-threatening 
alternative. Such services, says Rev. Veenstra, frequently serve as a kind of 
half-way facility for worshipers "transitioning" back to church after being 
away from organized religion for months or years. Many one-time churchgoers 
become reacclimated here and later return to more standard worship. 
</P>
<P>
But many others say they have no real interest in returning to the old way. 
They're happy in their cars. While some park in the back of the lot and 
studiously avoid fellow-churchgoers, preferring solitary contemplation, many 
others mingle before services at a coffee table set up in front of the theater 
concession stand. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Turn on Lights for Communion 
</P>
<P>
Apart from its setting, the service resembles other Sunday offerings. As in 
most churches, a collection is included; the usher goes car to car. On a 
bimonthly basis, communion is also served. Those who want to receive the bread 
are asked to illuminate their headlights. The minister also performs Baptisms 
in front of the congregants. 
</P>
<P>
"What better place to worship than in the outdoors, in God's own creation?" 
asked John Van Ballegooijen, a genial retiree from the Midwest, who has been 
attending Sunday drive-in services regularly almost since the concept took hold 
here almost 15 years ago. Van Ballegooijen spoke as he fiddled with the speaker 
system in a booth set up behind the pulpit in the truck. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the convenience of not having to exit from one's car, there are also 
other practical advantages. For instance, pets aren't welcome at most church 
services. It's different here. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say we get a good half-dozen dogs here every Sunday," noted Phyllis 
Mosier, the volunteer, who was going to car to car as her pet, Pretzel, 
remained back in the car with her husband, Bob. (Occasional barks could be 
heard during the hour-long service.) Mosier also plays her accordion on 
Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
Many drive-in aficionados spoke approvingly of the informality. Even on Easter 
Sunday, a traditional time of strutting new outfits, many of those present wore 
jeans. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to wear a suit the rest of the week," said Ron Dellinger, a banker from 
Chula Vista, who donned a leather jacket and open-neck shirt. "It's a more 
relaxed atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Children in attendance appear to appreciate the novelty and the ease of it all. 
The church runs a Sunday school concurrent with the services. An Easter egg 
hunt preceded services Sunday, sending youths scurrying about the parking lot 
and projection building seeking the hidden eggs. In the summer, the Sunday 
school sponsors "Jesus loves you" hikes in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"At least you don't have to sit on those hard church seats," noted Angel Perry, 
10, dressed in pink for the occasion. "You're more comfortable. If it's 
raining, you turn on the windshield wiper. If it's cold, you just put on the 
heater." 
</P>
<P>
Added Tiffany Smith, 9, also dressed in her Easter best: "You don't have to get 
out of your car. If you like something, you don't have to clap. You just honk 
your horn." 
</P>

Premature babies grow better if they swing in a hammock rather than lie still 
in a crib, according to a new Dutch study. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty premature babies kept in hammock incubators in the first few weeks of 
life grew more and moved better than a control group of premature infants kept 
in regular incubators, the study at Utrecht's Wilhemina Children's Hospital 
showed. 
</P>
<P>
"The babies in the hammocks showed more alertness, their movements were more 
fluid, their sucking behavior was better and their heart and breathing was more 
regular than the other babies," said hospital physiotherapist Paul Helders. 
</P>
<P>
"In their first year, they also grew more than the other babies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Utrecht hospital plans to introduce hammocks in incubators because of the 
results.

IN BRIEF: COCAINE AND HEART ATTACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times staff and wire reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mystery of how cocaine triggers heart attacks may have been partly solved 
by scientists who found that the drug can induce spasms in dog and rabbit 
arteries. 
</P>
<P>
"There's now overwhelming evidence cocaine may cause spasm of vascular smooth 
muscle, the principal component of the normal artery," said Dr. Jeffrey Isner, 
a cardiovascular medicine professor at Boston's Tufts University. 
</P>
<P>
Studies presented last week at the American College of Cardiology's annual 
meeting in Anaheim indicated that cocaine can kill by narrowing arteries and 
that it also impairs the heart's electrical system. 
</P>
<P>
Smoked crack cocaine is more dangerous because it is absorbed into blood more 
quickly, but inhaled powder cocaine "is clearly enough to achieve blood levels 
that can cause these cardiac complications," Isner said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Kloner, heart research director at Hospital of the Good Samaritan in 
Los Angeles, said his study found that high dosages of cocaine given rapidly 
cause narrowing of coronary arteries and depression of the function of the 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
"Recreational doses also have been shown to have effects," he said. "You don't 
need to be on a binge to have a heart attack."

IN BRIEF: LIBRARY GETS LAPLACE PAPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times staff and wire reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bancroft Library at UC Berkeley has acquired 25 boxes of scientific and 
personal papers that belonged to Pierre Simon Laplace, one of France's top 
scientists at the time of the French Revolution. The papers are the literary 
remains of a fire at the Laplace home in Normandy in 1925, and historians 
believe they should reveal much about the work of Laplace, an astronomer, 
mathematician and physicist who is credited with major achievements in 
celestial mechanics and probability theory. 
</P>
<P>
UC Berkeley history professor Roger Hahn, who is writing a biography of 
Laplace, was largely responsible for arranging the acquisition with a grant 
from the Flora Lamson Hewlett Memorial Fund. The papers will be housed at the 
Bancroft Library on the Berkeley campus. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the collection, which will be open to scholars, are Laplace's 
manuscripts on a wide range of scientific endeavors and personal papers that 
could add much to the understanding of that critical period in France's 
history. Laplace was a minister under Napoleon Bonaparte and a founder of the 
Legion of Honor.

SUBDIVISION PLAN PUTS 'MEADOW' IN AN UPROAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Colfax Meadow hasn't been in such an uproar since 1938. 
</P>
<P>
That's the year the Los Angeles River went on a rampage in Studio City and 
surged into the meadow, flooding silent screen star Alice Terry's home. 
</P>
<P>
Terry, who played opposite Rudolph Valentino in such films as "The Four 
Horsemen of the Apocalypse" and died 15 months ago at age 88, lost most of her 
front yard to the raging waters. 
</P>
<P>
These days, her property is again at the center of a storm that is engulfing 
"the meadow" -- as residents still call a four-block-wide enclave of 71 
residences east of Colfax Avenue and north of the river. It is still home to 
many people in the entertainment business, including actor Robert Blake. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
10-House Tract 
</P>
<P>
A developer has purchased Terry's former Kelsey Street home and announced plans 
to demolish it, subdivide its 1 1/3-acre lot and build six large houses. 
</P>
<P>
The project would resemble a 10-house tract the same developer is finishing on 
nearby Troost Avenue. There, he has replaced another of the meadow's original 
ranch homes with two rows of two-story mini-mansions. 
</P>
<P>
The flurry of house building has jolted Colfax Meadow residents who pride 
themselves on having hung onto their neighborhood's country-like atmosphere for 
nearly 55 years. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of curbs and sidewalks and street lights, the meadow's streets -- 
Kelsey, Dilling, Chiquita and Acama -- are lined by vine-covered picket fences. 
Most of its homes are shaded by aging oak, sycamore and eucalyptus trees that 
tower over lots that are an acre or more in size. 
</P>
<P>
Residents say the large lots are a powerful lure to builders who are running 
out of undeveloped land in surrounding Studio City and elsewhere in the 
southeastern San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
At the urging of 67 of the meadow's 71 families, Los Angeles officials are 
taking steps to prevent the big lots from being chopped into smaller home 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Council Motion 
</P>
<P>
A City Council motion introduced Feb. 24 by Studio City-area representatives 
Joel Wachs and Mike Woo calls for zoning that would prohibit homes from being 
built on parcels smaller than 15,000 square feet. The current law allows 
5,000-square-foot lots. 
</P>
<P>
To residents' dismay, officials predict that it could take up to eight months 
for the zoning change proposal to be reviewed by city lawyers and planners and 
then be voted on by the council. 
</P>
<P>
The rezoning proposal has prompted builder Eli Elaz to step up plans to develop 
30 more houses on Terry's former property and other large meadow lots. He has 
hired a land-use lawyer in hopes of blocking the rezoning. 
</P>
<P>
Elaz says he is proud of the 4,100-square-foot houses he has already built on 
62 1/2-foot-wide lots he carved out of Colfax Meadow. All but three of the 
$850,000-plus dwellings have been sold. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm saying I'm consistent with the zoning and with the existing neighborhood," 
Elaz said. "I'll lose a lot of money if they stop me from building. It's not 
fair." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Similar Interiors 
</P>
<P>
His houses have similar interiors -- soaring living room ceilings, wet bars and 
spacious kitchens. Their exteriors are variously covered with brick or stone 
facings to give them differing looks. "This one's Cape Cod, that's Spanish, 
that's 'castle'," Elaz said. 
</P>
<P>
Elaz denies neighbors' complaints that his new houses are too big for their 
lots or are built too close together. Their two-story height creates an 
illusion that they are closer than the required 10-foot minimum separation, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Elaz, his new houses will increase property values in the meadow. 
</P>
<P>
"We are running out of land in the Valley," he said. "This is very selfish for 
these guys to try and downzone. I'm very reasonable. I'm willing to reduce the 
number of lots and not go to the max. But I guess people don't like changes." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors fear that Elaz's subdivisions will strangle the meadow. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel he figures he has found a cash cow in our neighborhood and he's going 
to milk it," said Ron Taylor, a television producer who lives in a 50-year-old 
Kelsey Street home. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not letting our fantasy get away. We know what he does. We've seen it. 
L.A. can't grow any further. The city is turning on itself. Los Angeles is 
devouring itself." 
</P>
<P>
Darren Robinson, an electronics technician who lives in a meadow home built in 
1937, said the neighborhood "didn't know the law and the power of city 
councilmen" to change the rules when Elaz sought city permission for his first 
subdivision two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson asserted that Elaz is waiting for old-time meadow residents "to kick 
off so he can buy their lots" and build on them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hopes Family Keeps House 
</P>
<P>
Original meadow settler Cris Hewitt said she hopes her family holds onto the 
home she built 53 years ago. She said that for years she has fended off realty 
agents and speculators interested in buying her home's large Chiquita Street 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate what they're doing," said Hewitt, who invited much of Colfax Meadow to 
her 80th birthday party at her home recently. "I think it's ridiculous the way 
they put 10 houses where there had been one house before. I don't think that's 
progress." 
</P>
<P>
Hewitt, whose property was narrowly spared by the 1938 flood, said the 
resulting washout left much of the meadow "like the Grand Canyon." She said it 
took officials 12 years to replace the Colfax bridge, which had disappeared in 
the river's surging waters. 
</P>
<P>
She said she and her neighbors hope city officials come to the meadow's rescue 
faster this time.

Sunday for a 6 a.m. Easter sunrise service. The service revived a tradition 
begun in the 1920s but abandoned in the 1970s that was designed to create a 
chance for blacks to worship together at Easter. Planners of this year's event,

BYSTANDER WOUNDED IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 26-year-old man struck in the back by a gunshot Sunday night was the 
unintended victim of a gang-related drive-by shooting, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Stuart Maislin said the man, who was not identified, was with friends near 
the intersection of Valerio Street and Vineland Avenue about 7:30 p.m. when he 
was hit once by a shot fired from a car. Maislin said the man was taken to St. 
Joseph Hospital in Burbank and was expected to survive. 
</P>
<P>
"He happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time," Maislin said.

Aliso Canyon and the brown hills overlooking it have begun to green again. Only 
an occasional blackened shrub serves as a reminder of a fire that swept through 
the Porter Ranch area three months ago. Next door, on residential Beaufait 
Avenue, the recovery is slower. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels like life is on hold until we come back here," said Steve Friedman, 
46, who is about a month away from starting a new house on his lot. 
</P>
<P>
"We're over the despair and sadness -- and now it's hope. We're going to build 
a new house, bigger and better, with the wall sockets where we want them and 
the telephones where we want them," he said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
The Dec. 9 fire, of unknown origin, was driven by Santa Ana winds and scorched 
3,200 acres above Granada Hills and Northridge, destroying 15 homes and 
damaging 25 others. Fire officials estimated damage at $4.3 million.

Exclusive Tract 
</P>
<P>
All but four of the homes were in two blocks of Beaufait Avenue, an exclusive 
neighborhood of $400,000 tract homes built in the early 1970s. Residents lost 
everything from computers to family photos to homing pigeons to palm trees. A 
few families have started rebuilding. Others are still waiting for insurance 
companies, architects and contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman's wife, Ann, had been going to look at their empty lot every day. "But 
recently, two other people have already started building, so it's kind of 
depressing." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people, including even friends, say, 'Well, you get a new house, you 
get to buy new clothes, furniture,' " said Linda Struthoff, whose five-bedroom 
home next to the canyon burned to the ground. But "you don't just go to a store 
and say, 'I'll take this and that,' and put your house together in a week or a 
month. All the warmth you can't replace." 
</P>
<P>
Turning onto Beaufait from Reseda Boulevard today, the houses look cozy, the 
lawns manicured, the street clean. The canyon below holds fast-growing 
ryegrass, planted by the city after the fire to prevent erosion, and the 
sproutings of the natural grass. 
</P>
<P>
But farther up Beaufait, roofing trucks, dumpsters and signs such as "Another 
Home Insured by Allstate" dot the street. 
</P>
<P>
The early-morning fire hopscotched across the neighborhood. Through a 
combination of quirky wind, luck, and the difference between tile and wood 
roofs, some houses emerged unscathed while others next door were gutted. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Steve Friedman said, neighbors who didn't lose anything "felt guilty 
talking to us. They couldn't look you in the eye." 
</P>
<P>
"The worst was the night of the fire," said Nedda Hartenstein, 37, whose front 
bushes were charred but whose house was untouched. "All the neighbors were 
coming back to get their belongings and go to hotels, and here I am, going 
shopping at Alpha Beta and life is normal." 
</P>
<P>
Although the homeowners have insurance, some have applied for federal Small 
Business Adminstration loans, up to $100,000 for real estate and $20,000 for 
personal property not covered by insurance. George Camp, deputy area director 
for the SBA Disaster Assistance Office, said 10 Northridge residents, including 
some on Beaufait, have applied. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Starting Over 
</P>
<P>
Those who were burned out spent several weeks trying to get copies of lost 
documents, finding rental housing that would accept dogs and starting new 
wardrobes. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Nassiri, a manager for Unum Co., went to work the next Monday wearing the 
same clothes he had worn Friday as he ran from his house: black shirt and black 
slacks, "not exactly a suit." 
</P>
<P>
Linda and Eric Struthoff and their two daughters moved into a four-bedroom 
Porter Ranch rental house, sleeping on inflatable mattresses for six nights. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know we could rent furniture through the insurance company," said 
Linda Struthoff, 40. "There should be a book on what to do. . . . We really 
didn't know what to do at a time when you can't even think." 
</P>
<P>
Christmas plans changed. The Friedmans and their sons, Eric and David, 
described to each other the presents destroyed by the fire, enacting the adage, 
"It's the thought that counts," as Steve Friedman pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Staying in Home 
</P>
<P>
John and Madi Impellizzeri stuck it out in their house, despite holes in the 
roof and waterlogged carpets, so their two children could continue car-pooling 
to school, said John Impellizzeri, 46. 
</P>
<P>
"The carpeting, floor were soaked, so you'd squish, squish," he recalled. 
During the weeklong wait for the carpet company to come, "the mildew smelled 
like three dead dogs." 
</P>
<P>
Before the roof was repaired, wind would whip aside the plywood and plastic 
covering, letting the rain drip in. "I used to sleep in the fields when I was 
in the Army, so it's no big deal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even now, months after the fire, people say that they lack many material goods 
-- but that they aren't so important. "Why have five VCRs?" asked Steve 
Friedman, scanning the tarp-covered swimming pool, scorched tree and 
regenerating ivy on his lot. "I had built a storage room just to store stuff -- 
why save it?" 
</P>
<P>
Did the family really have five VCRs? Friedman threw up his hands. "Probably 
five or so. It's stupid, it really is." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Buying Basics 
</P>
<P>
Those who used to shop until they dropped are only now starting to return to 
the malls with any enthusiasm. "Some of the shopping fun is taken away because 
most of the things are so taken for granted: sheets, mattress pads, pots, 
towels, hair dryer, shaving cream," Linda Struthoff said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a chore," she said, when "you need everything." 
</P>
<P>
Residents have found different techniques for coping. Eric Friedman, 20, said 
his Cal State Northridge fraternity brothers will suggest going swimming at his 
home. "And they'll say, 'We'll have a barbecue there.' Somebody will say, 'We 
already had a barbecue there.' You have to be able to laugh at it." 
</P>
<P>
Grasping for something to bring back fond memories, Linda Struthoff bought a 
hammock like the one that used to hang between two trees in the back yard, 
where browned patio furniture and singed Corning Ware dishes now lie. "I don't 
know why I bought it because the trees burned and it'll take years to grow 
back. It didn't dawn on me until later that it makes no sense," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Roost for Pigeons 
</P>
<P>
Homing pigeons owned by Homa and Margaret Larijani roost on Beaufait rooftops, 
even though the Larijanis are now renting a house on Tampa Avenue. Two of their 
four pigeons died after the fire, probably from smoke inhalation, and the 
Larijanis bought and trained more. Homa Larijani now returns to the remains of 
their home every day to feed the birds. "They just fly around and come back. 
They only know this house," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Psychologically, the neighborhood is closer, residents say. Before, Linda 
Struthoff said, she and Ann Friedman, who lives across the street, would just 
say "hi and bye as you're backing up the car." Now, added Friedman, "we're on 
the phone a lot." 
</P>
<P>
On New Year's Eve, the Friedmans invited the "Beaufait Burnouts" to a party and 
a showing of a video of the fire. In February, there was a dinner at the Porter 
Ranch Country Club. A block party to thank police and firefighters is planned 
for August.

PALM SPRINGS HOTEL; 
</P>
<P>
FALL HOSPITALIZES STUDENT FROM MOORPARK COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 19-year-old Simi Valley college student was in serious condition at a Palm 
Springs hospital Sunday recovering from head injuries suffered when she fell 
from a hotel balcony during spring break revelry. 
</P>
<P>
A nursing supervisor at Desert Hospital said Shelli Hoyt, a student at Moorpark 
College, remained in the hospital's intensive care unit after undergoing 
surgery. Her condition was reported as critical Saturday but had improved by 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Palm Springs police said Hoyt fell from the second-floor balcony of her room at 
the Dunes Hotel about 1:30 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Ghrabety, a desk clerk at the hotel, said a security guard told Hoyt, who 
had been drinking, not to sit on the balcony railing. But, he said, she did not 
move. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a straightforward accident as far as we could tell," a police spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Melee 
</P>
<P>
Two hours before the fall, police wearing riot gear had gone to the hotel to 
break up a fist fight among about 15 young men, authorities said. The fight 
spread throughout the hotel and police threatened to close it before the 
disruption subsided. 
</P>
<P>
Ghrabety said only about 15 guests remained Sunday afternoon at the 128-room 
hotel. He said the hotel planned to hire several additional security guards for 
next weekend, when college students celebrating spring break a week later are 
expected to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fall and the death of a 22-year-old Santa Ana woman in a traffic 
accident two days earlier, police consider the weeklong celebration by college 
students to have been relatively quiet. The woman was killed when the truck in 
which she was riding flipped over, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole city was gridlocked last night but there were no major incidents," 
Sgt. Ron Starrs said. "In fact, there hasn't been a major incident this year." 
</P>
<P>
By Sunday, police had issued 5,736 citations, mostly for traffic violations. 
They had also arrested 1,640 people. Nearly 700 of those arrested were jailed 
on a variety of charges.

SUNNY SKIES, WARMER DAYS HEAD THIS WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that weekend picnics and holiday get-togethers have been ruined by drizzle 
and clouds, it looks like the weather will clear up just in time for another 
workweek. 
</P>
<P>
The recent storm that passed through San Diego County should be just a memory 
by this morning, according to the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
Sunnier skies and warmer temperatures are on tap for the rest of the week, 
forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
The showers that lingered in the mountains and inland valleys Sunday evening 
will be gone today, leaving only a few chilly gusts of wind and high clouds 
throughout the county, forecaster Wally Segiel said. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures in downtown San Diego will be about 69 degrees today, with 
nighttime lows in the 50s, Segiel said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warming Trend 
</P>
<P>
There will be more clearing and warmer temperatures Tuesday and throughout the 
rest of the week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The weekend storm dropped .63 inches of rain on San Diego, bringing the total 
rainfall for the season to 5.43 inches -- still 2.58 inches short of the normal 
seasonal rainfall, according to weather service statistics. 
</P>
<P>
The heaviest rainfall was in the mountains, with Palomar Mountain reporting 
4.20 inches of rain and Julian measuring 3 inches, since the storm began 
Saturday morning, Segiel said. 
</P>
<P>
Campo, Escondido and Poway each reported at least an inch of rain, with lesser 
amounts falling in coastal areas. 
</P>
<P>
The relatively mild storm provided "a good drenching," but there were no 
reported damages, Segiel said.

1,300 SIMI VALLEY HOMES LOSE POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 1,300 customers in an area of northeast Simi Valley were without 
electricity for about 1 1/2 hours late Sunday afternoon and another 400 were 
without power for even longer as Southern California Edison workers hunted for 
the source of the outage, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Company spokesman David Barron said the outage occurred about 5:25 p.m. Power 
was rerouted, restoring service to most of the homes by 6:50 p.m. Several hours 
later electricity was still off for the remaining customers. 
</P>
<P>
The boundaries of the area affected by the outage were Cochran Street on the 
north, Kuehner Drive on the east, Los Angeles Avenue on the south and Stow 
Street on the west.

ACCIDENT DOES NOT STOP OJEDA; 
</P>
<P>
SURGEON'S SKILL, WIFE'S SUPPORT SAVE MET PITCHER'S CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Ojeda rides motorcycles. He goes backpacking and rock-climbing, where one 
slip can mean death. 
</P>
<P>
"I put myself in those situations because I like them," said the left-handed 
pitcher for the New York Mets. "That's just the way I am." 
</P>
<P>
But Ojeda never liked power tools. His father, Bob Ojeda Sr., always had warned 
him to stay away from them. And on a September morning last fall in his own 
back yard, the worst fears of both Ojeda and his father were realized. 
</P>
<P>
A common homeowner's chore -- trimming the hedges -- became a nightmare when 
Ojeda nearly severed the tip of the middle finger of his left hand with a pair 
of electric clippers. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like machines," Ojeda said. "I've never liked machines, but I was 
using one, and I did something I always thought I'd do if I ever touched one." 
</P>
<P>
Even when he had elbow surgery in 1987 and missed almost the entire season 
after doctors repositioned the ulnar nerve in his elbow, Ojeda never had 
experienced the pain he felt on the morning when the clippers slipped and he 
sliced into flesh and bone. 
</P>
<P>
"When it first happened, I called to my wife, Ellen," Ojeda said. "She came 
running when she heard my voice, she knew something bad had happened, she came 
flying out. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't show it to her, she didn't know what I did. I said, 'Just go to the 
hospital.' She saw all the blood all over me, it was squirting out like Freddie 
in 'Nightmare on Elm Street.' " 
</P>
<P>
With his hand clutched to his chest, Ojeda climbed into the passenger seat of 
his car, fighting the urge to pass out. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like cutting myself," he said. "I don't like needles. I don't like to 
bleed, and I could feel the piece of my finger drop off. What kept me from 
going into shock was my wife's driving. 
</P>
<P>
"She was driving on the wrong side of the road, swerving around people. I 
swear, I got nervous about her driving. I said, 'Honey, slow down, I'm going to 
be all right.' " 
</P>
<P>
At the first hospital Ojeda went to, doctors wrapped the finger to stop the 
bleeding. But they immediately sent him to another hospital, where Richard 
Eaton and James Parkes, the Mets' physicians, were awaiting them with a team of 
hand specialists. 
</P>
<P>
"People say that it doesn't hurt," Ojeda said. "Well, it hurt like hell." 
</P>
<P>
It hurt even more when the doctors began to probe the injured finger. 
</P>
<P>
"He had cut every nerve and every artery and every tendon," Parkes recalled. 
"Everything except a little skin on the top bone." 
</P>
<P>
The joint was destroyed, and a decision had to be made quickly. The doctors 
decided to attempt to fuse the joint together at a 10-degree angle, the same 
position Ojeda holds the finger when he grips a baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to be very positive about it," Parkes said. "We told him he would get 
back to pitching again." 
</P>
<P>
Ojeda said he was in no condition to understand what the doctors were telling 
him. "I just told them, 'Make my finger straight.' What Dr. Eaton did was a 
miracle." 
</P>
<P>
What Eaton did was 6 1/2 hours of delicate microsurgery, using sutures as thin 
as spider webs to sew Ojeda's finger back together again, tendons, arteries and 
nerves. 
</P>
<P>
"All night long," said Ojeda, who had been given an anesthetic, "I was in the 
twilight zone. When I came to, I had a cast on, but the tip of my finger was 
sticking out, you could see that much. 
</P>
<P>
"The nurse kept coming in to check it with a flashlight and touch it, to make 
sure the color was good. If it had started to change colors, that would have 
meant it had clotted. 
</P>
<P>
"I even had an oxygen mask on. I was a mess. The next day, when I woke up, it 
didn't really dawn on me. I couldn't watch the guys on TV, because I knew they 
were talking about me." 
</P>
<P>
While the Mets were on their way to the playoffs and a date with the Dodgers, 
Ojeda was in a New York hospital room, knowing he would not pitch again in 
1988, wondering if he would ever pitch again. 
</P>
<P>
"I think pitching was the farthest thing from Dr. Eaton's mind," Ojeda said. 
"He wanted to save my finger, and he did." 
</P>
<P>
Now it was up to Ojeda to try to salvage his career. 
</P>
<P>
It began with a game of catch with his father, back in Visalia, Calif., where 
Ojeda was reared, where he had been most valuable player for Redwood High 
School, where he had been all-conference as a first baseman, outfielder and 
pitcher for the College of Sequoias, where he had been signed as a free agent 
by Red Sox scout Larry Flynn in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"The first two weeks," Ojeda said, "I played catch with my dad every day. I 
didn't know if it would stop hurting, but I said, 'Let's keep going, it will 
build up.' 
</P>
<P>
"Gradually, I could feel the improvement, and I started throwing off the mound 
around Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
There were setbacks -- like the time, unbeknown to his doctors, that Ojeda went 
to Shea Stadium and threw a ball to his brother-in-law, Jim Mengone. 
</P>
<P>
"I was out there throwing, and my finger had barely closed up and the seams of 
the ball hurt like hell," he said. "There were all these cameras and stuff, I 
had no place to hide, so I just started to BS and say, 'It's no big deal.' 
Meanwhile, it really hurt." 
</P>
<P>
It hurt so much that after everyone had left, Ojeda told his wife, Ellen, that 
he couldn't continue, it wasn't worth the agony. Her response was a suggestion 
that he answer some more of the dozens of cards and letters he had received 
while in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"It amazed me how much people cared," Ojeda said. "People really pulled for me. 
They showed me how much they cared. I'm not a big media person, but to find 
that out, how much people cared, really touched me. Ellen knew what she was 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened to me is something so many people do. It's not an athlete's 
injury, it's just a regular guy's injury. I think that's what kind of hit 
people, it was like, 'Athletes do bleed when they work around the house and get 
cut.' 
</P>
<P>
"People always think we're doing other things, but we're regular people like 
everybody else. And believe me, we bleed when we get cut." 
</P>
<P>
By the end of January, Ojeda was beginning to feel confident that maybe he 
could make a comeback. "I said to myself, 'I'm going to be able to do this. I 
don't know how well I'm going to do this, but I'm going to do this.' " 
</P>
<P>
The biggest hurdle would come in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, his teammates were apprehensive about approaching Ojeda, they 
didn't quite know how to ask him about the finger. But just as Ellen began to 
tease him about the injury, so did the other Mets. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of asking me to slap five, they'd say 'Give me four,' " Ojeda said, 
laughing. "Guys would come up and tell me they'd heard I had come up with a new 
pitch: the split-fingered fastball." 
</P>
<P>
But while Ojeda was happy to laugh along with them, he was anxious to find out 
how the old pitches worked. 
</P>
<P>
"I was throwing my curveball, I was throwing my slider, and I asked my catchers 
-- Gary Carter and Barry Lyons and Mackey Sasser -- and they told me my pitches 
looked exactly the same," Ojeda said. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the real test. I needed to hear that. I needed to build some 
confidence. I told the beat writers, I'm in great shape, I feel great, but it's 
my spring training now, too. Don't expect me to use the finger as a crutch. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want people's reaction to be, 'Oh, no, he hung a slider, it must be 
the finger.' I'm still going to make lousy pitches. I'm still going to hang a 
slider, I'm still going to make good pitches, too. I don't want it to be a 
constant crutch." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the results have been encouraging. Ojeda has taken his regular turn in 
spring training and has claimed his former spot in the rotation, where he won 
18 games in 1986 when the Mets won the championship, and won 10 with a 2.88 
earned-run average last season. There are those who say his ball actually has 
some different movement, making him even more difficult to hit. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Ojeda went fishing with Dodger pitcher John Tudor, his former 
teammate when both played for the Boston Red Sox. Tudor is recovering from 
elbow surgery that is expected to sideline him until at least July. 
</P>
<P>
It was like a scene out of Jaws, Ojeda said, the one in which shark hunters 
Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw compare scars. 
</P>
<P>
"You remember, they're sitting around drinking, and one guy points to a spot 
and says, 'Mako shark.' I say to John, 'Hedge clippers.' "

MORNING BRIEFING: MALARCHUK DID NOT HAVE TO WAIT IN VEIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Buffalo Sabres goaltender Clint Malarchuk, who had his jugular vein cut in a 
collision with St. Louis Blues forward Steve Tuttle last week, recalled the 
gruesome incident after being released from a Buffalo hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Malarchuk, 27, said he struggled to his feet and refused to be taken off the 
ice on a stretcher after Tuttle's skate opened a six-inch gash in his neck. 
</P>
<P>
"The day I go off on a stretcher is the day they have to make funeral 
arrangements," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Malarchuk said he remembered telling the team trainer: "It's my jugular vein 
that's cut, and I've got three minutes." 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't sure why he said it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why three minutes. I've heard that. I thought that's what I had. 
When they got me into the dressing room, I said: 'I've got two and a-half now.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Doctors made sure he has a lot more. 
</P>
<P>
Just asking: Has any father-son duo ever before hit home runs on the same day 
during the exhibition season? 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, veteran Ken Griffey, 39, homered for the Cincinnati Reds at Plant 
City, Fla., against the Boston Red Sox, and Ken Griffey Jr. helped the Seattle 
Mariners beat the Milwaukee Brewers with a home run at Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
50 years ago today: On March 27, 1939, Oregon beat Ohio State, 46-33, in the 
championship game of the first National Collegiate Athletic Assn. basketball 
tournament.

A weighty matter: Jockey Kent Desormeaux, who is intent on breaking Chris 
McCarron's record of 546 winning rides in one season, has a good chance this 
year, barring injury. 
</P>
<P>
Riding primarily at Laurel and Pimlico, he already has more than 160 winners. 
If he keeps that pace, he would finish the year with at least 640. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Baltimore Sun's Dale Austin, Desormeaux, who used to be known 
as "Pee Wee," has grown some. 
</P>
<P>
Well, maybe. He now rides at 114 pounds instead of 112. 
</P>
<P>
The new Mariano: One of the many players trying to earn the last spot on the 
Dodger roster is an old face -- infielder Mariano Duncan. Duncan, 26, had a 
sensational rookie season in 1985, but was sent to Albuquerque last year after 
two mediocre seasons filled with injuries and error-filled play. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a good attitude now," he said. "People think Pete (Pedro Guerrero) was 
a bad influence on me, and because he isn't here anymore it will help me. But 
Pete tried to help me. He said I got mad too fast. He never tried to teach me 
bad things." 
</P>
<P>
An icing call: NHL referee Andy van Hellemond has an odd perspective on 
violence in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I, for one, really don't have any concern about fighting," he said. "Seldom do 
you see anybody get hurt, and the cheering indicates to me that nobody minds 
much. To me, things are under control." 
</P>

Quotebook: Bucky Waters, basketball analyst for NBC, after watching the 
Broadway show "Metamorphosis," which stars Mikhail Baryshnikov and is based on 
Franz Kafka's story of a man transformed into a bug: "Baryshnikov was great,

SIMPSON BREAKS 4-YEAR SLUMP WITH VICTORY 
</P>

Tim Simpson, winless for four years, worked out with a putting aid, consulted a 
sports psychologist and made the shots that counted Sunday, regaining his 
confidence and pocketing the $135,000 winner's check at the USF&amp;G Classic 
at New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really, really thrilled," Simpson said. "For the past two years, I've been 
struggling with my confidence, wondering if I'd ever win again." 
</P>
<P>
After a round of 70 on Saturday, which left him "so frustrated I could pull my 
hair out," he worked Saturday night and Sunday morning with a putting aid 
designed by New Orleans club pro Jimmy Self and talked to sports psychologist 
Bob Rotella on the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me to stay focused -- focus all of my attention on the hole and let 
nothing bother me. That's what I did, and it worked," Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
The $750,000 tournament was played over the 7,106-yard, par-72 course at 
English Turn. It was the first professional event at the course designed by 
Jack Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson shot a three-under-par 69 Sunday and had a tournament total of 274, 
14-under par. 
</P>
<P>
It was only the second professional victory for Simpson in a career that began 
in 1977. He won the Southern Open in 1985, won $200,748 last year, 56th on the 
money list, and had won $84,418 in nine tournaments this year. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson started the final round a stroke behind Greg Norman. 
</P>
<P>
Norman finished two strokes back, tied with Hal Sutton at 276, worth $66,000 
each. Norman shot 72 Sunday, and Sutton shot 70. 
</P>
<P>
After 66 holes, Simpson and Norman were tied at 13-under par. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson took the lead for good with an eight-foot birdie putt on No. 13 and 
made it a two-stroke lead with a birdie putt on No. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson bogeyed No. 17, but so did Norman. 
</P>
<P>
Norman had a 35-foot putt for an eagle on No. 15, but that rolled three feet 
past the hole, and he missed the second putt, too, before tapping in for par. 
</P>
<P>
He missed a nine-foot putt for a birdie on 16, and missed another shot at a 
birdie on 17. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Kite failed in his bid for a third straight tournament title, shooting a 73 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Allison Finney shot an even-par 73 on a rain-soaked course and took advantage 
of Beth Daniel's lone mistake -- a double-bogey on the second hole -- to win 
the $400,000 LPGA Turquoise Classic at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first tournament victory in seven years on the tour for Finney, 
whose previous best was a second-place tie at the 1985 Mazda Hall of Fame 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
Finney, 30, finished with a 10-under 282 total to take the $60,000 top prize. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel, who started the day one shot ahead of Finney, parred every hole except 
the par-3 second, where she four-putted for the double-bogey. She had a 
two-over 75 for a 283 total and settled for the $37,000 second-place check. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Bob Charles of New Zealand won the $370,000 Fuji Electric 
Grand Slam seniors title at Narita, Japan, by four strokes with a 
nine-under-par 207. 
</P>
<P>
Charles shot a final-round 69 and won $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
Americans Don January, Charles Coody and Larry Mowry finished in a three-way 
tie for second at 211. January had a final-round 69, Coody 68 and Mowry 70. 
</P>
<P>
American Holly Hartley of Oceanside, the L.A city champion in 1976, shot an 
even-par 72 to score her first victory in Japan, a one-stroke triumph over 
Hiromi Kobayashi, who beat her in a sudden-death playoff two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley finished with a 215, and Kobayashi, with a 74, ended at 216 in the 
$308,000 Kibun Classic ladies golf tournament at Higashmatsuyama. The victory 
was worth $55,400.

<P>
Kevin Curren rallied from a two-set deficit Sunday to beat Jimmy Connors in the 
fourth round of the International Players Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Curren, seeded 13th, needed four hours to win, 4-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2. He has 
defeated Connors both times they've played this year, and the series between 
them is tied, 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
Connors' loss left No. 1-seeded Ivan Lendl as the lone player among the top 
four men still in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl swept No. 15 Andres Gomez of Ecuador, 6-4, 6-2, 6-4. Tenth-seeded Aaron 
Krickstein lost the first set but still beat Jaime Yzaga of Peru, 3-6, 7-6, 
6-3, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl said he was unaffected by the departure of second-seeded Mats Wilander 
and third-seeded Andre Agassi in early upsets. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not worried about it," Lendl said. "I'm worried about my game. And when 
I'm through worrying about my game, I'm worrying about my golf game." 
</P>
<P>
In fourth-round women's competition, No. 4-seeded Pam Shriver lost in straight 
sets to unseeded Jana Novotna of Czechoslovakia. No. 2 Chris Evert swept No. 9 
Mary Joe Fernandez; No. 11 Helen Kelesi beat No. 8 Katerina Maleeva; and No. 5 
Zina Garrison won in 53 minutes over unseeded Laura Golarsa of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Shriver said she wasn't upset about getting upset by Novotna. 
</P>
<P>
"All my priorities have changed," Shriver said after a 7-5, 6-4 loss, her first 
in four meetings with Novotna. "Right now, I'm sort of a person of ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Shriver, 26, said she has decided to concentrate on Grand Slam events, doubles 
and matters away from the court. 
</P>
<P>
"After 11 years, I cannot expect to go out there every match and be at my 
competitive best," Shriver said. "I have no more desire to play just because 
the system expects me to play. I did that for 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Shriver tried to motivate herself midway through the second set against 
Novotna, ranked 47th. 
</P>
<P>
When Shriver trailed 4-2 and lost the first point of the next game, she 
shouted, "Give me a warning! I need a warning!" She then hit a ball out of the 
stadium and received a warning for ball abuse from the smiling umpire. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just trying to give myself a kick," Shriver said later. She won that 
game and later had two break points with a chance to even the second set, 5-5. 
But Novotna, who was in top form with both her forehand and volleys, won the 
final four points of the match. 
</P>
<P>
"She was just a better player," Shriver said. "I'm not upset about it." 
</P>
<P>
Things didn't get any better for Shriver in doubles. She and partner Elise 
Burgin lost to Manon Bollegraf of the Netherlands and Eva Pfaff of West 
Germany, 6-4, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Evert, 34, won the final four games of her match to defeat Fernandez, a fellow 
South Floridian who is half Evert's age, 7-5, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
"She makes me work hard," Evert said. "She keeps me out there a long time. But 
I was going to stay out there all day, if I had to, to win the match." 
</P>
<P>
Kelesi ousted Maleeva, 6-2, 6-3. Garrison beat Golarsa, 6-1, 6-2.

BOGGS' TRADE TALK FADES AS PRICE IS TOO HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PALM SPRINGS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wade Boggs, the man they would ban from Boston, continues to have his name 
bandied about by Red Sox General Manager Lou Gorman, so it was only a matter of 
time before the phones in the Angel offices started ringing. 
</P>
<P>
According to Angel Manager Doug Rader, Gorman and Angel Vice President Mike 
Port discussed a trade involving Boston's five-time American League batting 
champion this weekend, but only until Gorman began naming names. 
</P>
<P>
Gorman reportedly asked for third baseman Jack Howell, left-handed pitcher 
Chuck Finley and two other players who figure to make the Angels' 24-man 
roster. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's dead," Rader said. "What (the Red Sox) were asking for was so 
unreasonable, so disproportionate that it just didn't make sense. I don't think 
it'd be smart to decimate the whole ballclub for him." 
</P>
<P>
Boston management has grown weary of the publicity surrounding the ongoing 
Boggs-Margo Adams saga, especially after Boggs agreed to Friday night's 
interview with Barbara Walters against the club's wishes. Owner Haywood 
Sullivan has instructed Gorman to attempt to make a trade. 
</P>
<P>
So far, most of Gorman's proposals have included a third baseman and a 
left-handed pitcher in return for Boggs. With the free-agent departure of Bruce 
Hurst, Boston has no left-handed starting pitcher in its rotation and lacks a 
bona fide replacement for Boggs in its farm system. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Gorman has talked to: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The New York Mets about Howard Johnson and Sid Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The New York Yankees about Mike Pagliarulo and Dave Righetti. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Kansas City Royals about Kevin Seitzer and Charlie Leibrandt. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Seattle Mariners about Jim Presley and Mark Langston. 
</P>
<P>
And, now, the Angels, apparently about Howell and Finley and assorted others. 
</P>
<P>
Port declined to mention specific names, saying only that "We have as much 
going on with Boston right now as we have with the Mets, Cleveland, Seattle, 
Kansas City, the Yankees and the Chicago White Sox. Those are all teams I've 
spoken to in the last couple days." 
</P>
<P>
Both Rader and Port wanted to emphasize that the Angels did not initiate talks 
with the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike wasn't openly soliciting the offer," Rader said. "I want to make that 
clear, because that would indicate that we're not happy with Jack. And that's 
not the case. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just one of those things that come up. There was an offer made, a 
counteroffer and then we decided to back off." 
</P>
<P>
Not that he was being showcased or anything, but Finley was the Angels' 
starting pitcher Sunday afternoon. He completed six shaky innings, allowing 
three runs on five hits and four walks, but the Angels were in position to win 
with two outs in the top of the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
They led the San Diego Padres, 5-4, with runners on second and third and batter 
Bip Roberts facing a 1-and-2 count. But on Angel reliever Vance Lovelace's next 
pitch, Roberts bopped a grounder through the middle of the infield, driving in 
two runs that gave San Diego a 6-5 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Lovelace, on the fringes of contention for a bullpen berth, allowed three runs 
and four hits in his one inning, but Rader insisted the rookie left-hander 
hadn't completely ruined his chances. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave up three runs, but they were all scored on cheap hits," Rader said. 
"And he walked a guy on four pitches that just as easily could've been strikes. 
He demonstrated good location and velocity. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the three runs do look bad on paper, but from our vantage point, Vance 
didn't look bad at all." 
</P>
<P>
The runs were the first Lovelace had allowed in four exhibition outings. Of 
course, he had pitched a total of only four innings before Sunday. Lovelace's 
left-handed competition is Bob McClure, who has an earned-run average of 0.96. 
</P>
<P>
Before Roberts' game-winning single, Angel starter-turned-reliever Willie 
Fraser was a pitch away from boosting his record to 4-0. Fraser had worked two 
innings of scoreless relief in support of Finley and was the pitcher of record 
until the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
He is still 3-0, which isn't bad for a pitcher who hadn't demonstrated much 
more than an effective fastball until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I was encouraged by Willie today," Rader said. "He's been a one-pitch pitcher 
all spring, and it's hard to get by on one pitch. He lost his forkball and his 
slider and was just fastball-fastball-fastball. 
</P>
<P>
"But he had three good pitches today, and I was so glad to see them again. The 
forkball hadn't been around for quite a while. It's been a little inconsistent 
for quite some time. With it, Willie can be an outstanding pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Ray and Mark McLemore split time at second base Sunday, both raising 
their batting averages in their bid for the starting assignment. Ray went two 
for three with a triple and a single to improve his average to .452 (14 for 
31). McLemore replaced him and went one for-two with a double, bringing his 
average to .364 (16 for 44). McLemore has 10 hits in his last 19 at-bats. "It's 
wonderful to see guys compete," Manager Doug Rader said. "Both men are doing a 
heroic job of it." 
</P>
<P>
Angel bullpen coach Joe Coleman hobbled off into the trainer's room after 
taking a line drive off his shin during batting practice. "And now he has a 
staph infection," Rader said. "How can you get a staph infection by getting hit 
by a ball?" Rader should have been around in 1986, when the same thing happened 
to Wally Joyner. Only then, the infection went undetected for two months and 
ultimately Joyner was admitted to a hospital, sidelining him for the final four 
games of that fateful playoff against Boston. Coleman's condition, to his good 
fortune, was diagnosed a little sooner.

CICCARELLI'S GOAL GIVES FIRST TITLE TO CAPITALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It was only fitting that Dino Ciccarelli scored the goal that clinched the 
first Patrick Division championship for the Washington Capitals. 
</P>
<P>
Ciccarelli scored with just 2:48 remaining Sunday to give the Capitals a 3-2 
victory over the stubborn New York Islanders at Landover, Md. With the New York 
Rangers losing to Pittsburgh, the Capitals, in their 15th season, won the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
Until the Capitals, long a defensive-minded team, acquired Ciccarelli, they 
seemed destined to finish second for the sixth consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout a nine-year career that has been turbulent both on and off the ice, 
there has been one constant for Ciccarelli: Few NHL players can play offense as 
well as he does. His emphasis on attack has made the Capitals a winner and a 
strong contender for the Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Ciccarelli's ninth goal since being obtained in a trade with Minnesota three 
weeks ago, gave the surging Capitals their eighth victory in a row. The shot 
handcuffed rookie goalie Mark Fitzpatrick, went under his arm and into the net. 
It appeared to carom off the stick of New York defenseman Gary Nylund. 
</P>
<P>
"I was excited about coming here and I'm more excited about helping them win 
the division," Ciccarelli said. "But their goalie was unbelievable. He was 
robbing guys right and left." 
</P>
<P>
The Capitals have a 40-26-10 record and have clinched with 90 points. Three 
times when they finished second they had 100 or more. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary 7, Chicago 5 -- The Flames scored three times late in the game at 
Chicago and moved one point ahead of Montreal, 111-110, in the hottest battle 
remaining in the regular season -- the bid for the highest overall point total. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackhawks continued to prolong the only other race remaining, the one for 
the last playoff spot in the Norris Division. The Blackhawks lead Toronto by 
two points. Both have three games left. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 6, New York Rangers 4 -- The Penguins didn't just put an end to the 
Rangers' hopes of winning the Patrick Division in this game at New York. 
</P>
<P>
For the second game in a row, Mario Lemieux, finally out of his slump, scored 
the tie-breaking goal. Saturday night against New Jersey, there were only five 
seconds left when he scored. In this one, he scored on a breakaway early in the 
last period. Before the finish, he scored into an empty net. The Penguins, with 
three games left, lead the Rangers by a point, 83-82. 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux has 79 goals, the third-highest for a single season in NHL history. 
Only Wayne Gretzky, with 92 and 87, has done better. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver 7, Winnipeg 3 -- Jim Sandlak scored three goals and Doug Smith two at 
Vancouver to enable the Canucks to end a three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Hawerchuk scored his 39th goal for the Jets and has four games in which to 
score another and reach 40 for the fifth consecutive season. DAN HAFNER

TAKEOVERS, MERGERS TAKE THEIR TOLL, TOO; 
</P>
<P>
DEPENDENCE ON CORPORATE SPONSORS CAN OFTEN LEAVE SPORTS VULNERABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
What's a little old $100 million or so when you're talking $25 billion? 
</P>
<P>
Not much, perhaps, unless you are one -- or all -- of the sports sponsorships 
that are part of the massive RJR Nabisco, Inc. special events marketing 
program, and you know that the largest leveraged buyout in financial history by 
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. will eventually lead to drastic cuts in the 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
It has been business as usual for Sports Marketing Enterprises, Inc. -- the 
company created last year within RJR to handle all major sports sponsorships -- 
since Henry R. Kravis and George R. Roberts completed the takeover last 
December. Still, it has been an uneasy time. 
</P>
<P>
What put sports executives' and competitors' on edge was a comment in Business 
Week attributed to J. Paul Sticht, who was acting as interim chief executive 
officer until a permanent one was named by the new owners, in which he referred 
to the sports-marketing program as "all fluff." 
</P>
<P>
If it is fluff, it's widespread. And expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Sports Marketing Enterprises has tentacles in NASCAR stock car racing, where it 
all began with a $100,000 point-fund investment in 1971; sports car racing, 
drag racing, dirt track motorcycle racing, motocross, professional golf, men's 
tennis, sailing, air races, unlimited hydroplane racing and soccer. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't really know what is going to happen until the new CEO (chief 
executive officer) comes on board April 3 and we know how much, and what, is 
going to be sold off," said Nat Walker, director of public relations for Sports 
Marketing Enterprises. "We know that we are one area, along with others, that 
will be looked at, but it's hard to believe, with the success we've had, that 
there could be significant changes in motor sports." 
</P>
<P>
Louis Gerstner, president and operations officer of American Express, was named 
last Tuesday as the new CEO. 
</P>
<P>
The first significant cutback occured Tuesday March 1, when the multimillion 
dollar smokeless cigarette Premier product program was scuttled. Premier had 
been the sponsor brand for the men's senior golf tour, but all 1989 
involvements of about $4 million in bonus point funds, tournament purses and 
electronic scoreboards will be met through the RJR banner. Thus, the Premier 
Cup series will become the RJR Cup series and the Premier Championship 
tournament will become the RJR Championship. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors are also persistent that some food products will be sold off to meet 
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.'s enormous debt within the next year. Most 
heavily involved if that occurs could be golf, in which Nabisco is the major 
sponsor of the men's tour and of the Dinah Shore tournament, richest on the 
women's tour. 
</P>
<P>
The Dinah Shore tournament and women's golf have felt the impact of changing 
CEOs before. When David Foster was in charge of Colgate, he developed an 
interest in women's golf and pumped millions into the LPGA with a worldwide 
program that included the Colgate European Open and the Colgate Far East Open, 
as well as the rich Dinah Shore. 
</P>
<P>
When Foster was ousted as CEO, however, the new management at Colgate dropped 
golf. Only the Dinah Shore tournament survived, with a new sponsor in Nabisco 
Brands, which later merged with R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. 
</P>
<P>
A leveraged buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts of Beatrice Industries in 1986 
was tough for motor racing. As CEO at Beatrice, James Dutt put together one of 
the most lucrative sponsorship deals in motor racing history with Lola 
distributor and car owner Carl Haas for not only an Indy car program involving 
Mario Andretti, but also a start-from-scratch venture into Formula One. 
</P>
<P>
When Dutt was ousted in the takeover shuffle, so was the racing program. 
</P>
<P>
The R.J. Reynolds excursion into sports began in late 1970, when company 
officials sought to find marketing exposure they had lost when tobacco 
advertising was banned from radio and television. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Seagraves, a second generation RJR employee who was raised in 
Winston-Salem, N.C., moved from district manager of the firm's Washington 
office to oversee the pilot program. 
</P>
<P>
"I was as happy as if I had just won the Southern 500," Seagraves, now retired, 
said. "I'd grown up watching fellows like Junior Johnson and Richard Petty and 
David Pearson race, and when I got the chance to work with them, it was like 
being in heaven." 
</P>
<P>
What started as a $100,000 point fund for NASCAR drivers, which was won in 1971 
by Petty, has grown to a $2.5-million fund this year. Petty won $30,000. This 
year's champion will receive $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, sports cars, rodeo and two more stock car programs were added. 
Rodeo has since been dropped, but the number of projects became so large that 
in May, 1988, Sports Marketing Enterprises, Inc., was formed to administer the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Besides putting up huge sums in point-fund and prize money, the company is 
actively involved in the marketing, promotion and public relations of each 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we can increase the visibility of the various sports programs through 
our efforts," said Gerald H. Long, former RJR Tobacco chief. "The more we are 
able to do this, the more exposure the various series will receive. 
</P>
<P>
"And the more exposure each series receives, the more people will want to come 
out and see what Winston Cup or Winston drag racing or Camel GT racing is all 
about." 
</P>
<P>
RJR has gone through six CEOs since 1971 and the sports-marketing program has 
survived each one, which may be as much a tribute to Seagraves' internal 
salesmanship as to his work on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
"If the man on top isn't certain that what you're doing is the right thing, 
you're battling a losing cause all around," Seagraves once said. "The bottom 
line, always, is, 'Is it helping to sell cigarettes, our brand of cigarettes?' 
We never claimed to want to influence anyone to smoke, but we do want to 
influence the ones who smoke to smoke our brand." 
</P>
<P>
How does a company measure it's success in sports promotions? 
</P>
<P>
"While we do not reveal specific sales figures for competitive reasons, we know 
that during the last 18 years, our special events sponsorships have paid off in 
additional sales dollars for our products," said Jeff Byrd, vice president of 
special events. 
</P>
<P>
"When we got involved in racing, our market research showed us that racing fans 
fit the demographic profile that Winston and Camel cigarettes are trying to 
reach, and we were convinced that these people would purchase a product that is 
instrumental in supporting their favorite sport. 
</P>
<P>
"And we believed that high visibility for our sports sponsorships would 
translate into additional sales dollars. And that has been the case." 
</P>
<P>
Visibility has been high. Last year, for instance, there were 64 telecasts of 
29 Winston Cup stock car events by CBS, WTBS, ESPN and ABC, as well as national 
syndicators Spectra Communications and SETN. According to the Sponsors Report, 
compiled by Joyce Julius and Associates, the televised events filled 174 
viewing hours and furnished 13,523 mentions of sponsors or company, which was 
estimated to have a value equivalency of $147 million. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than 3 million people attended Winston Cup races last year, 
with an estimated 15 million watching Winston Racing Series events on 80-odd 
small tracks throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
"R.J. Reynolds took stock car racing from its infancy and helped make it into 
an internationally prominent sport," H. A. (Humpy) Wheeler, president of 
Charlotte Motor Speedway, said last year. "Without their help, stock car racing 
would never have grown into the most popular form of auto racing in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Brands to be involved with sponsorships are selected according to the 
demographics of the sport with which they are associated. Most are tobacco 
products, but some are from Nabisco Brands. 
</P>
<P>
Winston cigarettes is the busiest and the most expansive. The Winston Cup stock 
car champion will receive a $1-million bonus from a $2.5-million point fund. 
</P>
<P>
If the same driver wins three of NASCAR's big four races -- the Daytona 500, 
Winston 500, Coca-Cola 600 and Southern 500 -- he will get a $1-million bonus. 
</P>
<P>
The Winston, an invitational race in May, for past winners only, will pay 
$200,000 for first and $50,000 to the fastest qualifier from a purse of 
$800,000. 
</P>
<P>
The company also sponsors the Winston 500 at Talladega, Ala., with a $700,000 
purse. 
</P>
<P>
In all, $4.5 million in sponsorship money will be available to Winston Cup 
drivers this season. 
</P>
<P>
In other stock car racing divisions, the Winston West series has a $50,000 
sponsorship with the champion getting $10,000, and the grass roots Winston 
Racing Series that touches nearly every short track in the country pays $1,000 
to the champion at tracks such as Ascot Park, Saugus Speedway, Orange Show 
Speedway in San Bernardino and Cajon Speedway in El Cajon and also determines a 
national short-track champion. 
</P>
<P>
Eighty-two tracks are divided into eight regions in which champions are 
determined by points based on the drivers' best 20 finishes during a 22-week 
season that will run from April through September. At the end of the season, 
the records of the eight regional champions will be compared to determine the 
national champion in a program that was started in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
The national champion will receive a minimum of $50,000 from the $500,000 
national point fund. 
</P>
<P>
If any sponsorship survives, most at Sports Marketing Enterprises believes it 
will be the stock car program. 
</P>
<P>
"We're comfortable that they will stay involved with the Winston Cup series," 
said Bill France Jr., NASCAR president. "We have received no indication from 
Reynolds that they're planning to pull out. We may see more budget restraints, 
but I don't see the sale as having an adverse effect on NASCAR racing." 
</P>
<P>
Winston also sponsors the National Hot Rod Assn. drag racing season for $1 
million. Winners of the top-fuel and funny car championship series will each 
collect $150,000 and the pro stock champion $100,000. It also sponsors the 
season-ending Winston Finals at the Los Angeles County Fairgrounds in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the NHRA recently signed a new two-year sponsorship contract with 
RJR Tobacco extending through 1991, the drag racing association has a 
contingency plan -- just in case. 
</P>
<P>
"We would probably be better off than most," said Brian Tracy, NHRA vice 
president for marketing and sales. "We could make up the $1 million by 
assessing each race $50,000. Our sport is very healthy and all but two races 
are fully sponsored. 
</P>
<P>
"We would probably have to separate the professional and sportsman classes and 
find two different sponsors. Right now, Winston sponsors them both, but from 
the way we're growing, it shouldn't be difficult to find two sponsors to share 
the load." 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in the RJR sports sponsorship program, Winston will be an 
individual team sponsor with the brand backing the Steve Woomer-owned 
Competition Specialties Racing, Inc., team, in the unlimited hydroplane series. 
Larry Lauterbach, who finished second in the final race last year at Las Vegas, 
will be the driver. 
</P>
<P>
"Series sponsorship will remain the heart of our program, but because the name 
of the boat is so much a part of unlimited hydroplane racing, we felt our best 
marketing tool in this case was a team sponsorship," said Wayne Robertson, 
senior vice president of Sports Marketing Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
Camel is the sponsor of GT sports car racing in the International Motor Sports 
Assn. and dirt track motorcycle racing and stadium motocross in the American 
Motorcyclist Assn. 
</P>
<P>
A package of $800,000, including $150,000 for the GTP champion and $50,000 to 
the Camel Lights champion, will be paid drivers after the year's final race, 
the Camel Grand Prix of Southern California at Del Mar on Oct. 22. The brand 
will also sponsor individual races at Lime Rock, Conn., and Watkins Glen, N.Y., 
on the 15-race schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds expanded its motorcycle program this year to include a three-year 
contract for the Supercross series as well as its 16th year with the Camel Pro 
Series for dirt track races. A $125,000 point fund has been posted for stadium 
motocross, with $50,000 going to the champion. This is the first year that RJR 
Nabisco has been involved in motocross. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-race AMA Grand National dirt track series has $400,000 in posted awards, 
of which $100,000 will go to the champion. 
</P>
<P>
For the past three years, the series was a combination of dirt track and road 
racing events, but this year the entire series will be dirt races, including 
two on the half-mile oval at Ascot Park on May 13 and Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
'The backbone of motorcycle racing is the dirt track series," Robertson said. 
"This series is what attracted us to motorcycle racing back in 1974, and when 
the fans talk about the Camel Pro champion they think of dirt track racing, so 
we decided it was best to return to it exclusively." 
</P>
<P>
Air races were introduced into the Sports Marketing Enterprises program last 
year with a package paying $75,000 in prize and point-fund money for the Camel 
Unlimited Warbirds class and the Air Camel Warbirds series at the Reno national 
championships. The Warbirds class is made up of World War II vintage fighter 
planes. 
</P>
<P>
The Salem brand is the sponsor of professional sailing, which consists of six 
national championship races for two classes. Nabisco Brands' involvement is 
heaviest in professional golf. 
</P>
<P>
On the men's PGA Tour, Nabisco has a four-pronged sponsorship program: 
</P>
<P>
 -- It bankrolls a year-long competition that will pay $1 million in bonus 
money to the season's leading money winners. Curtis Strange collected a 
$175,000 bonus last year to help pad his year's earnings to more than $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It holds a team charity competition throughout the season in which $2 
million is donated to charities in the name of tournament sponsors. Each 
tournament draws a team of four players and their year-long performance 
determines the winning team. First prize is $500,000, which last year went to 
charities in the Houston area. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Payouts of $25,000 each will go to players who lead in 10 statistical 
categories at the conclusion of the season. The categories are scoring, driving 
distance, driving accuracy, greens in regulation, par-breakers, putting, 
eagles, birdies, sand saves and all-around. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The season-ending Nabisco Championships, with a purse of $2.5 million, is 
the richest tournament in professional golf. Only the leading 30 money winners 
of the year are eligible. The purse was increased $500,000 after Strange won 
$360,000 in last year's tournament at Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In women's golf, Nabisco sponsors the $500,000 Dinah Shore tournament. Amy 
Alcott will be defending champion when the tournament is held for the 18th time 
at the Mission Hills Country Club in Rancho Mirage, starting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
RJR Nabisco is also involved in the Planters Pat Bradley International Open, a 
$400,000 tournament June 8-11 at High Point, N.C. Planters LifeSavers Co. is a 
subsidiary of Nabisco. 
</P>
<P>
Planters also sponsors actor-driver Paul Newman's race car in Trans-Am 
competition and Kenny Bernstein's cars in drag racing and the Indianapolis 500. 
Bernstein is a four-time funny car champion on the drag strip. His Indy car 
will be driven this year by Jim Crawford of Scotland, who finished sixth last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
On the men's senior tour, where the Premier brand was replaced by RJR when the 
smokeless cigarette was pulled off the market, the RJR Cup will pay the leading 
money winners an additional $1.5 million, an increase of $500,000 over last 
year, with the winner receiving $112,500. The RJR Championship tournament in 
Winston-Salem will be the richest in senior golf with a $1.5-million payoff. 
</P>
<P>
Tennis has been a part of the RJR Nabisco package for 10 years, but this will 
be the last. This has nothing to do with the takeover, however, since Sports 
Marketing Enterprises made the decision to end its tennis program a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Dropped will be the Nabisco Grand Prix, a $4-million bonus pool for the men's 
tour that is climaxed by season-ending Nabisco Masters tournaments -- singles 
at Madison Square Garden in New York City and doubles at the Royal Albert Hall 
in London. 
</P>
<P>
Then, too, there is a motor racing program in Europe, a marketing tool of R.J. 
Reynolds Tobacco International Inc., but not part of Sports Marketing 
Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
Headed by Duncan Lee, a former IMSA project director, and headquartered in 
London, the foreign involvement centers around individual teams sponsored by 
Camel. 
</P>
<P>
The latest is Paul Stewart Racing, a new Formula Three team directed by former 
Formula One champion Jackie Stewart, whose son, Paul, is one of the team's 
drivers. Otto Rensing of West Germany is the other. 
</P>
<P>
Young Stewart, 23, won the GTO portion of the Daytona 24-hour race last month 
in a Mercury Cougar. This will be his first venture into Formula Three after 
driving Formula Fords with Camel sponsorship last year. It will also be his 
father's first serious association with racing since he retired as a driver in 
1973. 
</P>
<P>
"This sponsorship signifies much more than a continuing association with a 
famous name in motor racing," Lee said from London. "The Camel Paul Stewart F3 
team will form the cornerstone of the Camel UK motorsports sponsorship program 
with a two-year commitment to develop a solid, professionally run operation." 
</P>
<P>
The blue and yellow Camel colors will also be on the AGS cars of Joachim 
Winkelhock of West Germany and Philippe Streiff of France in Formula One, a 
sponsorship that began in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Camel backed the Range Rover effort in the 8,000-mile Paris-to-Dakar 
Rally that included off-road racing veteran Malcolm Smith of Riverside and 
Formula One driver Patrick Tambay of France. Another project is the Camel 
Trophy Rally, which brings together cars from different countries to compete in 
an exotic setting. The last one was in Borneo.

LONG BEACH'S TURNABOUT HAS BEEN A REAL SNOW JOB; 
</P>
<P>
NEW BASEBALL COACH HAS PLAYERS WINNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before still another victory, senior second baseman Chris Gill sat in the Blair 
Field dugout and tried to describe Coach Dave Snow, who has been mainly 
responsible for the startling turnaround Cal State Long Beach's baseball 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"He's real quiet, a hard person to explain," Gill said. "He's got this aura. He 
doesn't say much, but when he talks, everyone shuts up. Whatever he says, you 
take away with you." 
</P>
<P>
Under Snow, the 11th-ranked 49ers are 27-4. Last season, they were 14-45. After 
coaching four years at Loyola Marymount, Snow was asked last June to raise the 
Long Beach program to respectability. 
</P>
<P>
When Snow talks, it usually is about hard work and fundamentals. Almost 39, 
Snow is known for his ability to teach the sport he once played as a third 
baseman. Low-key and modest, he can be seen before games with a hose or rake, 
grooming the field, a task he doesn't want his players to feel above either. 
</P>
<P>
"I want them to be humble," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, who have not had a winning year since 1983, have acquired an aura of 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a storybook season," Snow said. 
</P>
<P>
It started with an 18-game winning streak, during which the 49ers were ranked 
as high as fourth in the nation. The first defeat was to Loyola Marymount, two 
came at Arizona State and the other was at San Diego State. Among the victories 
were two over perennial power Arizona at Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach has a .327 batting average, a 2.72 earned-run average and has 
averaged fewer than one error a game. Except for Gill, most of the 49ers are 
community college transfers. 
</P>
<P>
"When we started I thought it wasn't going to work," said Gill, who is hitting 
.354. "With guys from different JC's, there were different cliques. But we all 
just kind of merged. I feel like I've been playing with these guys for four 
years." 
</P>
<P>
The melding came quicker than Snow had expected, and occured, he believes, 
because of the confidence gained from a half-dozen come-from-behind victories. 
</P>
<P>
It is an unselfish group, he said, one that rallies around its opportunity to 
be known for changing the image of 49er baseball. 
</P>
<P>
The winning streak had also been surprising because, until they moved into 
Blair Field last week, the 49ers had in effect been exclusively a road team. 
With the campus field unplayable because of irrigation problems and Blair's 
availability delayed by field conditions, they had to play their early home 
games at Cerritos College and Long Beach City College. 
</P>
<P>
"That was extremely difficult, but through all that the players didn't 
complain," Snow said. "They just said, 'Coach, where are we going to play 
today?' That kept me going." 
</P>
<P>
Practices were held at an old Pony League diamond, whose lack of grass the 
infielders accepted with a humor that enabled them to call one another Dirt 
Bags. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time we came off that field, someone had blood on them from a bad hop," 
Gill said. 
</P>
<P>
Gill had already been left rather bloodied from the last three seasons, during 
which he had experienced more than 100 losses. "I had to keep myself up," he 
said. "It hurt me to be around guys who didn't care. I kept telling myself I'm 
a winner." 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers seemed to be facing a bleak future under John Gonsalves. Fatigued and 
frustrated, primarily because he was able to give only five scholarships, 
Gonsalves resigned last May after 19 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Snow, who was 162-81-1 at Loyola Marymount and had the reputation of an 
effective recruiter, was hired by Athletic Director Corey Johnson. Once an 
assistant athletic director at baseball power Miami (Fla.), Johnson gave Snow 
10 scholarships and a promise to soon reach the maximum of 13. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Snow arrived, most of the best high school players had already 
signed with colleges, so he concentrated on recruiting community college 
players. The result was a class of recruits that the publication Baseball 
America ranked eighth-best in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"Mainly, these guys were overlooked by big schools," Snow said. "Yeah, I want 
horses too, but you can get caught up in big name players. This is a hungrier 
group; it shows up in their dedication and how they pay attention to things. 
Good players going good can be arrogant, and when they go bad, they can be a 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
"But they are on an even keel," he added, while watching the 49ers take batting 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
Snow said his two best hitters are center fielder Darrell Sherman (.392, 20 
RBIs) and first baseman Todd Guggiana (.339, 36). Both came from Cerritos 
College. Others hitting above .300 include third baseman Deryk Hudson 
(Fullerton College), outfielder Daniel Berthel (El Camino College) and 
outfielder Todd Lloyd (Rancho Santiago College). 
</P>
<P>
"The most consistent part of our game has been pitching," Snow said. 
</P>
<P>
The staff is led by junior left-hander Kyle Abbott, a transfer from UC San 
Diego who is 8-1 with a 1.71 ERA, and Andy Croghan (4-0, 2.51), a freshman 
right-hander from Servite High School in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Of his philosophy, Snow said: "The big key is to keep things simple. The 
challenge is the game itself, not the opponents. If you play catch (not make 
errors), throw strikes and put the ball in play, you have a chance to win any 
game. Baseball borderlines on being boring. Once the fundamentals are down, 
it's repetition. You're constantly teaching and re-emphasizing. (Sometimes) 
you'll add a wrinkle here or there." 
</P>
<P>
Sherman, who bats left-handed, is a good example of a player who has been made 
better by Snow. 
</P>
<P>
"He was an outstanding junior college player, but he could not pull the ball to 
the right of second base," Snow said. "We wanted to get him to learn to pull 
the ball. He has. Now he has another dimension and is catching the attention of 
pro scouts, where before he might not have been considered a prospect." 
</P>
<P>
There are a lot of victories in the 49er dugout. Wally Kincaid, one of Snow's 
three assistants, won 80% of his games in 22 years at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the master teacher," Snow said of his former coach. "When I come up with 
an idea, one I'm not sure about, I always go to him for advice." 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers' success has not bred cockiness. 
</P>
<P>
"We try not to get too emotional," Snow said. "In basketball and football you 
can get psyched out of your mind. But baseball is made to be played everyday. 
We don't try to get pumped up for one game. We're not too high when we win or 
too low when we lose. We focus on how we play." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike teams such as Stanford, whose players constantly stand and cheer, the 
49ers sit back in their dugout during games. 
</P>
<P>
"Our attitude is relaxed intensity," Gill said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, 49er baseball drew scant interest. Games were attended by a 
handful of parents and friends. 
</P>
<P>
But as the 49ers sprayed hits around Blair Field during a recent Sunday 
afternoon game against Utah, a crowd of about 1,200 watched from the 
grandstand. Gill said it seemed more like a million.

GIBRALTAR: BRITAIN'S ROCK IS ON A ROLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

GIBRALTAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The remains of Capt. Thomas Norman, Royal Marines, who was fatally wounded in 
the epic battle off Trafalgar in 1805, lie in a tiny cemetery at the foot of 
Main Street. Nearby, the Barbary Ape Take Away advertises fast food: breaded 
haddock and Spanish omelets. The apes themselves still gambol, under government 
subsidy, on the limestone cliffs thrusting, defiantly British, out of the blue 
Mediterranean Sea. 
</P>
<P>
Gibraltar's fortress image lingers, but the Rock is shifting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bankbooks in Fashion 
</P>
<P>
Bankbooks are more fashionable now than gun ports on an outpost long prized as 
an impregnable sentry at the western entrance to the Mediterranean. Residents, 
recognizing that forts are as passe as dreadnoughts, predict a profitable role 
for themselves as an offshore adjunct to the new Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"We're transforming ourselves from a fortress to a city," J. H. Bautista, an 
adviser to the Gibraltar government's ambitious attempt to transform the Rock 
into a major financial center, said recently. 
</P>
<P>
Amid economic ferment, a feisty hometown spirit is growing in Europe's last 
colony. After three centuries, the people who live here are demanding a piece 
of their Rock. 
</P>
<P>
If there is no room for nationalism on 2 1/4 square miles of precipitate 
limestone, then call it village-ism. What it means is that the 22,000 polyglot 
people want a controlling say in their future. 
</P>
<P>
This late-blooming assertion of local fervor may ultimately aggravate the 
British, who have controlled Gibraltar since 1704, as much as it irritates the 
Spanish, who for nearly as long have demanded the Rock's return. 
</P>
<P>
"What's wrong with our being prosperous?" said Joe Garcia, editor of a weekly 
newspaper here. "How can 22,000 souls be so threatening to two such big 
countries? This is our homeland. There is no other. We've never been Spanish, 
and although we identify with the British, I don't think we've ever trusted 
their governments." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Socialist Government 
</P>
<P>
Change on the Rock is being accelerated by a labor-based Socialist majority 
elected a year ago in the first philosophical change of local government since 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"The Gibraltar people are a free European community entitled to exercise 
freedom of choice," said Gibraltar's new chief minister, 48-year-old Joe 
Bossano, a union man. 
</P>
<P>
Bossano and his allies argue that there must be room for Gibraltar in the 
frontier-free Europe promised in 1992, just as there is for other "Euroquirks" 
like Monaco, Andorra, San Marino and Liechtenstein. 
</P>
<P>
Down the road, Bossano and many of his constituents envision some sort of free 
association with Britain, or with a united Europe, that would make Gibraltar 
master of its own rock. 
</P>
<P>
"The right to our land is at the bottom of our position," said acting Chief 
Minister Joe Pilcher, filling in for Bossano, who was traveling. "We agree that 
we are a very small country, but we have as much right of existence as anybody 
else. Gibraltar wants to become self-sufficent. Only that would assure our 
independence." 
</P>
<P>
The British government says it will respect the wishes of the people of 
Gibraltar in any political rejiggering. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an absolute commitment that Gibraltar will not pass to anybody else's 
sovereignty against its wishes," Deputy Gov. William Quantrill, a British 
diplomat, said. "We are not going to sell out Gibraltar for the sake of our 
relations with Spain." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Garrison Cutback 
</P>
<P>
But a recently announced cutback in the size of the British garrison has made 
some people nervous and will certainly have an economic impact on a colony 
where military spending has always been an economic mainstay. 
</P>
<P>
"We accept the cutback without liking it," said Michael Feetham, minister of 
trade and industry in the new government. "At the same time, while we are 
deeply bonded with Great Britain and have full faith in our long-term 
relationship, we must plan to use our own resources without help from Britain. 
We're on our own. That's a challenge we accept." 
</P>
<P>
In all, about 31,000 people live on the Rock. There are 5,000 British military 
and 26,000 civilians, of whom 22,000 can claim a relative living on the Rock in 
1925. That makes them officially Gibraltarian. 
</P>
<P>
So it is that Britain's rock is patrolled by dressed-for-Piccadilly bobbies 
who, like their brethren Gibraltarenos, are equally at home in both English and 
Spanish, often in the same sentence. This is a Gibraltar tradition. Another is 
a dish called calentita, a chickpea pie brought to the Rock by fishermen from 
Genoa. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the Genoese in the years after Britain wrested Gibraltar from Spain 
came Maltese, Portuguese, Spaniards and Sephardic Jews from Morocco, a group 
whose 600 descendants here wield great economic influence today. Recent 
immigrants include about 2,000 Moroccan workers. The mix is leavened by former 
British servicemen who never went home. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rock has molded a people who are different," said Peter Montegriffo, a 
young lawyer who is a leader of the opposition to Bossano. "Gibraltar is a 
unique Mediterranean community. Spanish? My God, I'm not Spanish! (He said this 
in Spanish.) But I'm not British either. (In English.) When we go to school in 
England we realize how different we are ethnically and culturally. They drink 
beer, play rugby, have all that bad weather. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scandinavians and Arabs 
</P>
<P>
On a recent day at Gibraltar's Cathedral of St. Mary the Crowned, the marriage 
banns of Brian Consigliero and Helen Martinez were posted. The Rock is 
overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, but while Bishop Bernard Patrick Devlin said 
noonday Mass, the Main Street throng in front of his church included 
Scandinavian tourists in shorts, shopping Spaniards, off-duty British 
servicemen (a sprinkling of them black), Arab women muffled from toes to nose 
and a gray-suited Jewish businessman in a yarmulke. 
</P>
<P>
"Until the border was closed, we were just a bunch of people who lived on a 
rock," said Devlin, who came from County Cork four decades ago to preach. 
</P>
<P>
To press Spanish claims, dictator Francisco Franco closed the land border in 
1969, forcing Gibraltarians to look inward. The frontier was not fully reopened 
until 1985 and is still subject to the caprice of Spanish immigration and 
customs inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
"None of us will ever forget it," recalled Clive Cooms, the 46-year-old clerk 
of Gibraltar's Parliament. "Nothing moved. Franco stopped even the oxygen for 
the hospitals and the Communion wine. As a result, my kids -- the whole younger 
generation -- want nothing to do with Spain. The Spanish say we're more British 
than the British, and, well, if we do paint the town red, white and blue now 
and again, it's because we know it annoys them. If Mongolia plays Spain in 
soccer, the Rock roots for Mongolia." 
</P>
<P>
Visiting Spanish tourists encounter no visible tension, but scratch a 
Gibraltarian and you'll find a Rock patriot with no love for Spain. 
</P>
<P>
"Franco gave identity to this place," said Sam Benzaquen, a Main Street 
merchant whose Sephardic family came to Gibraltar from Morocco in about 1750. 
"He fused us into one people. We're pro-British but not English. We're 
anti-Spanish. The British now seek a modus vivendi with Spain. Will they try to 
divorce us?" 
</P>
<P>
The last time Britain asked Gibraltarians if they wanted to align with Spain, 
in 1967, the answer was no by a vote of 12,138 to 44. 
</P>
<P>
Tensions with Spain have eased in the democratic years since Franco's death, 
and particularly since Spain joined the European Community in 1986. Under Prime 
Minister Felipe Gonzalez, Spain maintains its case for the recovery of 
territory ceded to Britain in perpetuity under a 1713 treaty, but not at a 
level that would sour relations between Spain and its British partners in a new 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Under its 1969 constitution, Gibraltar is internally self-governing; Britain 
retains responsibility for foreign affairs and defense. The Rock remains an 
important base for British forces, but the economy, once tied to military 
spending, is now linked more closely to private enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tourism, Financial Services 
</P>
<P>
Tourism and offshore financial services, both growing, are bigger moneymakers 
than the old Royal Navy shipyard, which is now administered by the Gibraltar 
government. 
</P>
<P>
With no taxes levied on non-residents, the number of banks in Gibraltar has 
grown from five to 23 since 1985, according to financial adviser Bautista. One 
of the banks opened 10,000 new accounts in the first six months of last year, 
when the Rock's economy grew by 6%. About 9,000 offshore companies are 
registered here, four times as many as when the land border with Spain was 
reopened in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Tourism has increased to 3.5 million visitors a year, most of them day-trippers 
from Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Gibraltar has become an important banking and shopping annex for several 
hundred thousand British and Northern European snowbirds who have settled along 
the Costa del Sol between Gibraltar and Malaga. Supermarkets that stock British 
goods are popular; so are cheap electronics and so, for reasons Gibraltarians 
cannot fathom, are umbrellas. 
</P>
<P>
At present, Spain and Britain are both frustrated by Gibraltarian 
intransigence. The 15-member Gibraltar House of Assembly is balking, 15 to 0, 
at an attempt by Britain and Spain to ease their historic enmity over the Rock 
by allowing joint commercial use of the Gibraltar airport. 
</P>
<P>
A bilateral agreement would allow travelers bound for Spain to have a separate 
exit and clear Spanish immigration and customs without reference to Gibraltar 
authorities. Gibraltar's approval is required, though, and in the assembly the 
concept is regarded unanimously as an unacceptable surrender of Gibraltarian 
sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Direct Flights 
</P>
<P>
Until there is an airport agreement, one of Gibraltar's peculiarities will 
continue to be that you can't get there from here. The only direct flights are 
from Britain or Tangier, Morocco. Otherwise, a visitor must fly to Malaga and 
then drive three hours along what little the developers have left of the Costa 
del Sol. En route, the Spanish disgust with England's Rock is manifest: There 
is not a single road sign mentioning Gibraltar. 
</P>
<P>
Gibraltarians are betting that the prospect of a unified, frontier-free Europe 
will make historic antagonisms seem out of step and old fashioned. Even if they 
are wrong, the Gibraltarenos say, they are by now as wed to their Rock as to 
the Barbary apes, who have survived 15 sieges and two world wars. 
</P>
<P>
Britain, legend says, will remain on the Rock as long as the apes are here. 
During World War II, Winston Churchill took that lore seriously enough to send 
a secret mission into the Atlas Mountains of North Africa for reinforcements 
when the ape population dwindled. 
</P>
<P>
By tradition, the apes figured on the muster list of the British army garrison. 
Now, in a sign of the changing times, the apes, all 67 of them, are on the 
rolls of the locally raised Gibraltar Regiment. 
</P>
<P>
There are even fresh breezes blowing at Ape's Den, according to Cpl. Ernest 
Asques, who commands there. Michael, longtime boss of the ape pack that 
tourists see, seems to be on his way out. An interloper named David, a newcomer 
from the wild pack of apes that roam the north end of the Rock, appears to be 
ready to take over, Asques says. 
</P>
<P>
GIBRALTAR: 'THE ROCK' 
</P>
<P>
The 2 1/4-square-mile island has been controlled by Britain since 1704. 
</P>
<P>
About 31,000 people live on the Rock: 5,000 British military personnel and 
26,000 civilians.

ALASKA TANKER PILOTED BY UNQUALIFIED OFFICER; 
</P>
<P>
EXXON UNABLE TO EXPLAIN CAPTAIN'S ABSENCE; RISING WINDS STIR FEARS OF OIL SLICK 
DAMAGE

VALDEZ, Alaska 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unqualified mate was piloting the Exxon Valdez -- violating both Coast Guard 
regulations and company policy -- when the tanker crashed into rocks, 
unleashing the worst oil spill in U.S. history, Exxon Shipping Co. said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon also disclosed that the Long Beach-bound tanker actually was involved in 
two separate accidents that night in pristine Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, winds kicked up around the crippled ship, stirring fears that choppy 
waters could destabilize the Exxon Valdez and sweep the slick ashore. 
</P>
<P>
Wildlife experts were summoned from California to coordinate any efforts to 
rescue birds and sea otters, whose feathers and fur make them the most 
vulnerable to oil contamination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oil-Covered Birds, Otters 
</P>
<P>
Biologists already have counted 95 birds and two otters covered with oil but 
were unable to capture them for cleaning. 
</P>
<P>
Killer whales, sea lions and ducks also have been spotted swimming in the muck. 
</P>
<P>
Cleanup efforts continued slowly, and Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper declared Prince 
William Sound a disaster area, freeing state resources for cleanup and paving 
the way for a federal disaster declaration. 
</P>
<P>
Many questions about the disaster remained unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
Still unexplained is why Third Mate Gregory Cousins was steering the 987-foot 
vessel through the tricky, iceberg-dotted waters on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Iarossi, president of Exxon Shipping, told reporters that Capt. Joseph 
Hazelwood was one flight below the bridge in his cabin when the Exxon Valdez 
hit the first jagged rock pinnacle about a mile outside shipping lanes. 
</P>
<P>
The ship then "slid about two miles" under full power and hit more underwater 
rocks, Iarossi said. At no time did the ship lose steering, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Iarossi said he did not know whether Hazelwood took the wheel after the first 
accident, or how much time elapsed between the two incidents. 
</P>
<P>
There would have been no reason for the 42-year-old captain to go below to use 
the bathroom or get coffee, since both are available on the bridge, Iarossi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I agree something is missing," Iarossi told reporters and local residents at a 
press conference. 
</P>
<P>
Cousins, a three-year employee of Exxon, did not have the Coast Guard 
certification required to pilot through the sound but was qualified under other 
circumstances to steer the ship, Iarossi said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Puts Off Filing Charges 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to file any charges until we are done with our investigation," 
said Coast Guard spokesman Todd Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
"The Coast Guard may seem slow and plodding at times, but if we file charges, 
we're going to make them stick," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said piloting a ship without proper certification is a civil, not 
criminal, violation, which ultimately could result in suspension or revocation 
of the captain's license. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon has not made any of the Exxon Valdez's 20 crew members available for 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard served subpoenas Saturday on the captain, helmsman and third 
mate to ensure that they make themselves available to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
A team from the National Transportation Safety Board arrived Sunday to probe 
the cause of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Experts from the International Bird Rescue Center in Berkeley, Calif., set up a 
rehabilitation center here Sunday in case oiled birds are captured. Otter 
experts from Hubbs Marine Research Institute at Sea World in San Diego were due 
to arrive today. 
</P>
<P>
But even if animals turn up in distress, rescues may not be feasible. 
</P>
<P>
"Human life and safety is more important," said Pamela Bergmann, the Department 
of the Interior representative assessing the situation. 
</P>
<P>
She said it might be too perilous to try to capture panicky birds and otters 
from boats in the frigid water, and there is no road access to the shores where 
they are likely to show up. 
</P>
<P>
A monitor from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said he felt encouraged about 
impact on the area's abundant marine life after patrolling the 50-square-mile 
slick by boat Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason we haven't seen a large number of birds affected so far is that the 
oil is out in the middle of the sound," said Everett Robinson-Wilson, the 
agency's environmental contaminant coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"The weather will help us or kill us," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Winds of up to 35 m.p.h. were expected by today. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Exxon nor the state and federal agencies involved in the operation 
could say how much oil had been mopped up or what percentage of the slick is 
contained. 
</P>
<P>
The Exxon Valdez spewed about 250,000 barrels of North Slope crude into the 
ice-blue waters. Another 1 million barrels remain aboard the damaged ship, but 
no new leakage has been reported. 
</P>
<P>
Pumps were being used to siphon the remaining oil into a sister tanker Sunday, 
an operation expected to take up to a week. 
</P>
<P>
Salvagers hope the two-year-old Exxon Valdez will be able to float free once 
its load is lightened. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Up to $20 Million Damages 
</P>
<P>
Iarossi estimated damage to the $125-million ship at $10 million to $20 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Videotapes filmed by divers revealed 10 sizable holes in the ship's hull, 
ranging from 8 feet by 15 feet to 20 feet by 6 feet, Iarossi said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rocks Charted 
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the rocks the ship hit were charted and well within range of 
the Exxon Valdez's navigational equipment. 
</P>
<P>
No disciplinary action has been taken against any crew members, Iarossi said. 
The executive promised to make public results of mandatory drug and alcohol 
tests on crew members. 
</P>
<P>
So far, oil has washed ashore only on two tiny islands in the sound, and beach 
cleanup efforts were under way. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hasn't Seen Plan 
</P>
<P>
"We have been told by Exxon that they will come up with an organized cleanup 
plan, but we've yet to see one," said Barbara Holian, spokeswoman for the state 
Department of Environmental Conservation. 
</P>
<P>
The agency is studying its "legal options" and may ask the Coast Guard to take 
over the cleanup from Exxon, she said. 
</P>
<P>
At Coast Guard offices here, Nelson said such a move was unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
"The Coast Guard doesn't have tons and tons of its own equipment, and it would 
have to hire the same people Exxon has," Nelson said. "That would just slow 
things down. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, Exxon is the oil company with the deep pockets, and it's cleaning 
up its own spill within federal guidelines." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RANKING THE EXXON VALDEZ SPILL 
</P>
<P>
11 million gallons that have leaked so far from the Exxon Valdez are dwarfed by 
some of the record spills around the world:

ASSEMBLYMAN FRANK HILL: 'CRUISING FOR A BRUISING'

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblyman Frank Hill was a man in a hurry, his critics say, like a driver 
careening down the highway heading for calamity. 
</P>
<P>
Even his political allies concede that the 35-year-old Whittier Republican 
courted trouble by boasting of his ability to use choice committee assignments 
and his influence with the governor's office to raise money for legislative 
races. 
</P>
<P>
"He was cruising for a bruising," said a former Republican legislative aide. 
</P>
<P>
The crash came last Aug. 24 when the FBI began a late-night search of Hill's 
office and the offices of three other legislators, the culmination of a 
three-year federal sting operation that targeted political corruption in the 
Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Hill nor any other legislator whose office was searched has been 
charged with a crime. 
</P>
<P>
But for the last seven months, since the FBI raid, the usually affable Hill has 
kept a low public profile. A spokesman for Hill said he has been advised not to 
make statements to the press. 
</P>
<P>
However, a detailed review of public records and dozens of interviews with 
legislators, aides, and lobbyists reveal that Hill has had a dangerous 
attraction to what his colleagues call "juice bills" -- special-interest 
legislation that can be counted on to win sizable campaign contributions and 
speaking fees. In the course of that review, The Times has learned that: 
</P>
<P>
* In at least two instances Hill may have violated the state's 
conflict-of-interest law by taking part in decisions that affect companies that 
paid him substantial speaking fees. 
</P>
<P>
* In numerous other cases, he carried or supported special-interest bills 
affecting groups that courted or rewarded him with gifts, campaign 
contributions and honorariums. 
</P>
<P>
* The FBI is continuing to review Hill's conduct in an inquiry ranging far 
beyond the sting itself and examining two bills that Hill authored for special 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
At an unusually young age, Hill became what Capitol insiders described as a 
"player" -- someone who would stake out positions on controversial issues and 
had to be reckoned with in any settlement. Before the sting controversy hit, 
Hill would talk openly about using his position as a GOP leader and vice 
chairman of the Assembly Governmental Organization Committee to raise money for 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Good Fund-Raiser' 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I'm a good fund-raiser. I'm one of the best in our caucus," Hill said in 
an interview two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
A former Republican legislative staff member described Hill's role more 
bluntly: "That was Frank's job, to make sure all our traditional friends who 
took us for granted knew that there was now going to be a price tag. . . . He 
used to brag how much money he raised, that he was the bagman for the caucus." 
</P>
<P>
Federal investigators have been focusing on Hill's dealings with special 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
This month, for example, FBI agents questioned officials of the Society of 
California Accountants about a $2,000 payment made to Hill in October, 1987, by 
the group's political action committee, the Independent CPA Practitioners 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hill reported the payment as an honorarium for a "speech," he never 
delivered a speech to the society, said the foundation's executive vice 
president, Charles A. Deen, one of those interviewed by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Advance Payment 
</P>
<P>
Deen said he sent the check a week after Hill met with a small group of society 
members at a get-acquainted lunch to discuss a bill that Hill had agreed to 
carry for the accountants. The measure later died in the Legislature. The 
money, according to Deen, was intended as an advance payment for a speech at 
one of the group's annual meetings in the spring. The meetings were held as 
scheduled, but Deen said he was unable to make arrangements with Hill for a 
speaking date. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, the FBI also obtained records of a bill Hill authored last 
year for Nickels &amp; Dimes Inc., a Texas-based chain of amusement arcades. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would have cleared up questions about the legality of "crane 
games," devices found in arcades, bars and liquor stores that require customers 
to manipulate a claw mechanism for a chance to pick up prizes. Los Angeles 
Police Department officials, who conducted an undercover investigation of the 
games, contend that the claw devices -- like slot machines -- can easily be 
tampered with and amount to games of chance, which are banned under state law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Case Became Test 
</P>
<P>
Nickels &amp; Dimes Inc., owner of the Goldmine Arcade in Los Angeles, was 
among those prosecuted for operating crane games. The case, which quickly 
became a test of whether the machines were permitted by California law, 
resulted in a hung jury last year. All charges against the firm have since been 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
But in the midst of its legal battle, Nickels &amp; Dimes decided to settle the 
matter by asking the Legislature to change the law. "Why fight it out for 10 
years (in court)?" asked Nickels &amp; Dimes lobbyist Scott R. Keene. The 
lobbyist reported that FBI agents have interviewed him about the measure, which 
ultimately was killed in committee. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have obtained copies of lobbying reports filed with the secretary 
of state by Nickels &amp; Dimes as well as Keene's lobbying firm. Those reports 
do not show any payments made to Hill or his campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
However, the center of the FBI's probe continues to be the meeting Hill had 
last June 27 with three undercover agents posing as businessmen in a room at 
Sacramento's Hyatt Regency Hotel across the street from the Capitol, according 
to information pieced together from sources familiar with the investigation and 
Hill's annual financial disclosure statement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special-Interest Bill 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the "businessmen" handed Hill a check for $2,500 drawn on the 
account of Peachstate Capital West Ltd., a bogus company set up by the FBI as 
part of the sting. The agents were seeking support for a special-interest bill 
that supposedly would have helped Peachstate build a shrimp-processing plant in 
West Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agents repeatedly asked Hill, who was accompanied by Republican legislative 
consultant Karin Watson, whether they could help him out with "green stuff" -- 
a cash payment of some kind -- and even offered to take him on a helicopter 
duck-hunting trip. By one account, Hill accepted the check but turned down the 
offer of cash. Sources indicate that the meeting was taped. 
</P>
<P>
Hill frequently received substantial honorariums, gifts and travel expenses as 
well as campaign contributions from companies and trade groups whose bills he 
carried or supported. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conflict-of-Interest Laws 
</P>
<P>
In at least two cases, he may have violated the state's conflict-of-interest 
law, which prohibits elected officials from playing a role in decisions 
affecting businesses that have provided them with gifts or income of $250 or 
more in the previous 12 months. However, the law has a major loophole that 
exempts legislators and other state elected officials from its penalty 
provisions. 
</P>
<P>
In one instance, Hill voted for a measure to add the popular anti-ulcer 
medication Zantac to the list of drugs approved for Medi-Cal patients, just 
weeks after receiving a $2,000 honorarium from the manufacturer, Glaxo Inc. of 
North Carolina. The payment was for speaking to a meeting of company personnel 
in California, Glaxo spokesman Jim Shamp said. 
</P>
<P>
In the other case, Hill reported receiving a $2,500 speaking fee and $541 in 
meals and accommodations from Sunrise/Desert Partners, a firm planning a resort 
development in the city of Indian Wells. Those payments came during the six 
months before Hill voted for a bill lobbied by Sunrise that would have 
benefited that development. The measure ultimately was vetoed by the governor 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Openly Critical 
</P>
<P>
Consumers Union lobbyist Harry Snyder is openly critical of Hill. 
</P>
<P>
"If you would say to people in the Capitol that this is a Frank Hill bill, 
their eyes would roll up in their heads," Snyder said. "They'd view it with 
suspicion." 
</P>
<P>
However, Hill has his defenders. 
</P>
<P>
"He never did anything wrong," said ex-Sen. H. L. Richardson (R-Glendora), who 
helped fund Hill's initial Assembly campaign in 1982. "He's not the type who 
goes out and does dumb things. Frank will lead out with a strong statement once 
in a while. It's more baloney than fact. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally have never known him to do anything illegal. . . . He's more 
boastful. He's not the kind who would go in to leverage (a bill) to feather his 
own pocketbook." 
</P>
<P>
In his legislative work, Hill has been a champion of making English the 
official state language and has worked to give local school districts more 
control over bilingual education. 
</P>
<P>
A hunter and outdoorsman, he has impressed colleagues -- Democrats as well as 
Republicans -- by fighting for measures intended to clean up the environment. 
And for his district, he carried one of the bills granting relief to victims of 
the 1987 Whittier earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
In late 1987, Hill became the Assembly GOP's "liaison to the governor" -- one 
of four Republican legislative leaders who meet regularly with Gov. George 
Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
His rise was rapid and rewarding financially. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1987-88 legislative session, only four legislators reported 
receiving more money in speaking fees and honorariums than Hill, who collected 
$48,892. 
</P>
<P>
He has also become one of the Assembly's top campaign fund-raisers, using the 
money he collects to support other Republican candidates and to maintain a 
political apparatus that he scarcely needs to keep his own Assembly seat. Over 
an 18-month period, ending June 30, 1988, only eight legislators doled out more 
money to other candidates, according to a report prepared by the Fair Political 
Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Controversial Legislation 
</P>
<P>
Since he won election to the Legislature in 1982, Hill has often been involved 
in controversial legislation. But he has managed to do so without alienating 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"He has more friends than any other legislator," said Assemblyman Gil Ferguson 
(R-Newport Beach). "He never did anything to make anybody mad at him." 
</P>
<P>
"Charming" is the way a number of legislators describe him. Maybe a little too 
"brash" at times, but definitely "likable" is the consensus. 
</P>
<P>
"Frank can be the life of a party," said a lobbyist who knows him well. "He can 
be the first person to put a lamp shade on his head." 
</P>
<P>
Born in El Paso, the oldest of six children, Hill got his start in politics 
while in high school, when he worked on the reelection campaign of 
then-Assemblyman Bill Campbell, now a Republican state senator from Hacienda 
Heights. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moved to Washington 
</P>
<P>
While a senior at UCLA, he volunteered for S. I. Hayakawa's 1976 U.S. Senate 
campaign. When Hayakawa won the primary, Hill, fresh out of college, became a 
full-time member of the campaign staff. After Hayakawa upset incumbent 
Democratic Sen. John V. Tunney that fall, Hill moved to Washington to work in 
the new senator's office. 
</P>
<P>
He has been in government ever since. His official legislative biography's 
description of him as a "legislator-businessman" notwithstanding, Hill's only 
business experience during his pre-legislative days was occasional political 
consulting work. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, Hill moved back to California to run then-Rep. Wayne Grisham's 
Whittier office. He was looking for an opportunity to break into politics 
himself, Republican Grisham said. 
</P>
<P>
He soon found it. In 1982, at age 28, Hill ran for a vacant Assembly seat in a 
district where the winner of the Republican primary could be expected to be 
victorious in the general election as well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Very Correct' 
</P>
<P>
His chief Republican opponent, Barbara Shell Stone, said she was annoyed that 
Hill ran while remaining on Grisham's payroll and collecting a federal salary 
of $3,320 a month. "Ethically, he should have resigned and not campaigned on 
taxpayers' money," Stone said. "It's not illegal, but it's not very correct." 
</P>
<P>
Hill beat Stone by 1,593 votes. Then, in the November general election, Hill 
won 66% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Even after the FBI investigation became public, Hill's popularity with voters 
in his district seemed to be hardly dented. In November, he was reelected with 
63% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Some Republican legislators report that Hill has been quieter since the FBI's 
Capitol raid, but they express confidence that he can survive politically. 
</P>
<P>
Ex-Assemblyman Grisham is certain that Hill did nothing wrong in accepting a 
$2,500 payment from the bogus FBI company, declaring: "I really think the FBI 
people are not used to the way Californians work. What they thought was illegal 
was perfectly legal." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proper Role 
</P>
<P>
But one veteran Capitol lobbyist, who has worked with Hill on several bills and 
clashed with him on others, believes that the assemblyman lost sight of his 
proper role as a legislator. 
</P>
<P>
"Frank Hill came up here as a young man, very naive," the lobbyist said. 
"What's happened is one of those things, where you dip your hands into water 
three or four times and don't get hurt and you figure you'll never get hurt. . 
. . He got sucked into it all and ended up going too far and got caught." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

Fatal accidents marred spring break festivities in Florida, where thousands of 
vacationing students created peak crowds over the Easter weekend. In Daytona 
Beach, a single-engine plane towing an advertising banner plunged into the 
ocean just 150 feet offshore from the crowded beach, killing the pilot. In 
Eatonville, two pedestrians were killed by a speeding car that fled the scene. 
Earlier in the week, a 22-year-old Burbank, Ill., man, whom police said was not 
a student, fell to his death from a Daytona Beach hotel balcony while trying to 
catch a Frisbee.

Scattered early returns in elections for thousands of local offices nationwide 
showed losses for Turkey's governing Motherland Party and gains for the leftist 
and conservative opposition. "The trend for early returns shows that we are no 
longer the first party," said Oltan Sungurlu, deputy chairman of the the 
Motherland Party. The election did not directly affect the government of Prime 
Minister Turgut Ozal, but opponents said the voting was a referendum on his 
policies. Ozal has said he may quit if voters favor the opposition. Two people 
were killed and 35 injured in violence at polling places in eastern Turkey, the 
Anatolia news agency reported.

Israel has decided to stop making grants of about $1,000 to Soviet Jews allowed 
to emigrate to Israel because many end up in other countries, a government 
official said. The grants previously were paid to Soviet Jews in Moscow or 
Vienna to help them emigrate, he said. Israel is frustrated that an 
overwhelming majority of Soviet Jews given Israeli visas move instead to the 
United States. In 1988, only 1,428 of 20,082 Jews who left the Soviet Union 
ended up in Israel. The government has been trying to set up flights that will 
pass through Romania rather than Austria to prevent emigres from changing 
destinations in Vienna.

A San Jose Superior Court judge approved issuing a search warrant to obtain a 
homosexual Sunnyvale man's blood sample for an AIDS test on the grounds that 
the man may have infected a police officer. An attorney for the man, Glen Allen 
Rice, 21, said she would advise him to submit. At issue was the 
precedent-setting order of a Palo Alto Municipal Court judge. In what is 
believed to be the first use of a new state law, Municipal Judge Stephen V. 
Manley on March 13 issued a search warrant to obtain blood samples from Rice 
for the purpose of AIDS testing. A Superior Court judge issued a stay the next 
day, setting the stage for another hearing before a second Superior Court 
judge, Jack Komar, who approved the search warrant. Rice was arrested on 
suspicion of drunk driving Jan. 29. During the arrest he was cut on the arms 
and so was Officer John Credi, who became fearful -- after disclosure of Rice's 
sexual orientation -- that blood from the injuries may have been mixed.

The National Security Agency and a research arm of the Commerce Department have 
reached an agreement aimed at strengthening protection of sensitive information 
handled by thousands of federal government computers. The memorandum of 
understanding was signed late last week by the NSA's director, Vice Adm. W. O. 
Studeman, and Raymond G. Kammer, acting director of the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology. Kammer said the agreement "provides a structure for 
discussions between NSA and us if there are issues that arise where there is a 
conflict between a classified or national security issue and regular civilian 
data issues." The effort has been spurred by concern over so-called computer 
viruses, computer code that can be inserted into software programs to cause 
computers to malfunction by clogging memory, destroying or altering data.

"I cry with you once more . . . we cannot seem to rouse our leaders to realize 
we are in a crisis," declared Bishop Paul Moore Jr., 69, in his final Easter 
sermon before retiring as head of the Episcopal diocese of New York. Moore was 
criticizing insensitivity to the plight of the poor in his sermon at the 
Cathedral of St. John the Divine. Moore, born to a wealthy family, has pursued 
an activist and liberal agenda as a clergyman, working with the poor, 
participating in the civil rights movement, leading a peace mission to Saigon 
in 1970 and traveling to Moscow in 1982 to promote nuclear disarmament. In 
1977, he ordained a homosexual man as an Episcopal priest.

Federal officials still do not know who injected cyanide into two grapes from 
Chile, although the origin of the crop has been identified, the head of the 
Food and Drug Administration said. Commissioner Frank E. Young told reporters 
on NBC's "Meet the Press" that the FDA's public warning and decision to 
withhold Chilean fruit from U.S. markets on March 13 was justified because the 
agency had received two threats about cyanide-laced fruit.

Doctors said the prognosis was good for a 7-year-old boy who fell through ice 
and was submerged in 40-degree water for nearly 20 minutes on Presque Isle Bay 
near Erie, Pa. Dwayne Peterson, in intensive care at St. Vincent Health Center, 
was fishing with his father when he fell through ice into the bay. He had no 
heartbeat when he was eventually pulled from the bay by John Wronek of the Erie 
County Sheriff's Department Search and Rescue SCUBA Team.

In its first official act, Sudan's new coalition Cabinet endorsed a tentative 
peace agreement with southern rebels that calls for an immediate cease-fire in 
the country's six-year civil war. The peace plan also calls for an end to the 
state of emergency in force since 1985 and the suspension of plans to introduce 
Islamic law until a national constitutional conference can be held. The rebels 
negotiated the agreement in November with the centrist Democratic Unionist 
Party, then the senior partner in Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi's Cabinet. 
Parliament, however, rejected the plan. Mahdi subsequently agreed to form a 
more broadly based government and to pursue peace talks with the rebels.

The Republican Party, during the 1987-88 election cycle, raised and spent more 
than double the amount of money taken in and spent by the Democrats, but the 
gap between the two parties' financial strength was less than in 1983-84, the 
Federal Election Commission said. A report issued by the commission said the 
GOP raised $263.3 million and spent $257 million in 1987-88, compared to $127.9 
million raised and $121.9 million spent by the Democratic Party. By contrast, 
when President Ronald Reagan ran for reelection in 1983-84, the Republicans 
raised a record $297.9 million and spent $300.8 million, while the Democrats 
raised $98.5 million and spent $97.4 million.

The body of 7-year-old Sara Nan Hodges, the object of a three-day search with 
police dogs and helicopters, was found Sunday afternoon in a house five doors

A 14-year-old Newhall boy was arrested late Sunday and was being held at the 
Santa Clarita Valley sheriff's station for investigation of murder, Los Angeles 
County sheriff's deputies said.

found, said the home's owner, Olga Kaczmar, found the body beneath a water bed 
mattress while she searched for the source of a sickening odor. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's spokeswoman Catherine Neilsen said Kaczmar rented the room where the 
body was found to the mother of the boy who was later arrested. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, whose name was not released, was sitting on the mattress when the body 
was found, Horner, 27, of Newhall, said. He said the boy had set up a fan in 
the room to blow the odor out an open window. 
</P>
<P>
"He (the boy) was crying and he said, 'I didn't do it,' " Horner said. 
</P>
<P>
Horner and other neighbors said the boy and his mother had lived at the Kaczmar 
home about a month. He had previously lived in Florida with his father, but had 
come back "because he got into some trouble," according to a neighbor who asked 
not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's officials would not confirm all of Horner's account. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Sgt. Barry Sandstrom confirmed that the body was found under a bed 
after adults smelled an odor. 
</P>
<P>
Coroner's officials said an autopsy would be performed to determine the cause 
of death and whether the child had been sexually molested. 
</P>
<P>
Sara had been living on Alderbrook Drive for about six weeks with her mother, 
Linda; her 16-year-old sister, Tisha, and her mother's boyfriend. They shared a 
home with Mary Alexander and her three children. 
</P>
<P>
The girl was last seen at 2 p.m. Thursday, playing with neighborhood children 
in front of her home. Her family reported her missing about 8 p.m. and a search 
began later that night. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Alexander's daughter, Jessica, said the blond, blue-eyed first-grader had 
told playmates that she was going to Kaczmar's home to ride horses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wondered About Odor 
</P>
<P>
Horner and Kaczmar attended church and went to brunch Sunday before returning 
to the home. They commented several times to each other about the odor in the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
"We smelled it . . . and nobody thought it was a dead body," Horner said. 
</P>
<P>
Pastor Robert Bloom of the nearby Village Church helped comfort Tisha, Sara's 
16-year-old sister, after the body was discovered. Bloom said Sara's mother and 
other family members had secluded themselves in a trailer behind the Alexander 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"She cried in my arms a long, long time," Bloom said of Tisha. "I told her that 
really, a thing like this takes God and time to heal." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, about 80 deputies, the Santa Clarita Search and Rescue team, 
Explorer Scouts and a sheriff's mounted posse scoured a two-square-mile 
wilderness area near the missing child's home. Searchers on the ground used 
three teams of bloodhounds, while others in a helicopter employed a 
high-intensity searchlight in a vain attempt to find the girl in the brushy 
terrain. The effort was called off Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Picture Distributed 
</P>
<P>
Since then, deputies had gone door-to-door inquiring about Sara's whereabouts 
and searching homes. The child's picture was printed on flyers distributed 
throughout the Newhall area and concern over her disappearance mounted through 
the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dan Cox said detectives had "in all likelihood" questioned the residents 
of the home where Sara's body was found. 
</P>
<P>
Sara's parents are divorced. Her father, Wallace Scott Mann, who lives in 
Ventura County, was in seclusion with the rest of the family at the Alexander 
home Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the disappearance, the child's family had hoped to be able to welcome 
her home with an Easter basket bulging with holiday favors and candy. 
</P>
<P>
But the sight of the basket early Sunday had caused her mother to break down 
crying. 
</P>
<P>
"We made her an Easter basket, because we want her to come home," her sister, 
Tisha, had said several hours before the body was found. But after the tears 
began, Tisha said, she hid the basket in a closet -- "where my Mom can't see 
it."

RULING ON RETURN OF SEIZED WEAPONS CRITICIZED BY POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Law enforcement officials in California say a recent decision by a San Diego 
appellate court threatens public safety by requiring police to return weapons 
confiscated from people who appear mentally disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say the decision by the 4th District Court of Appeal could force 
them to give back firearms and other weapons without first determining whether 
their owners -- typically detained for psychological evaluations -- are 
mentally fit. 
</P>
<P>
If the January ruling withstands an appeal to the state Supreme Court, city 
attorneys from Chula Vista to Humbolt County predict that it will oblige police 
to rearm people who may pose a danger to themselves or the public at large. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm required to give back all the weapons confiscated from these people 
without knowing whether they're OK, then to put it real blunt, it's going to 
hit the fan one of these days," San Diego Police Detective William Bird said. 
"It hasn't happened yet, but we could see some crazy guy wiping out his family 
or a neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Despite such dire forecasts, others say the court's decision properly abolished 
a system that stigmatized the weapon owners and made it costly and 
time-consuming for them to retrieve their property. 
</P>
<P>
"The thrust of the other side's argument is that this is wreaking havoc up and 
down the state. I have a hard time believing that," said San Diego attorney 
Christopher Larsen, who handled the case that prompted the appellate court 
decision. "For one thing, once a person is released there is nothing to keep 
him from going down to the gun store and buying new weapons." 
</P>
<P>
For another, Larsen said, police can rely on other statutes that give them wide 
latitude to confiscate firearms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Applicable Statute 
</P>
<P>
At issue is a section of the California Welfare and Institution Code requiring 
police officers to confiscate any "deadly weapon" found in the possession of 
people they believe are mentally disturbed. Under the statute, those who wish 
to retrieve their weapons must first obtain a Superior Court order certifying 
they do not pose a danger to themselves or others. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates of how frequently such cases arise vary widely. In Los Angeles, 
weapons were seized under the statute from 330 people in 1988. San Diego and 
San Francisco authorities could not produce such statistics but said they field 
requests for the return of confiscated firearms several times each month. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, a nurse whose six guns and dagger were impounded challenged the 
constitutionality of the statute after La Mesa police refused to release her 
weapons. A Superior Court judge rejected Kathleen Bryte's arguments, but in a 
seven-page decision issued Jan. 27, the Court of Appeal sided with her and 
declared the law unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unfair Burden 
</P>
<P>
In an opinion written by Justice Charles Froehlich, the court said the statute 
violates state and federal due process rights and unfairly places the burden of 
retrieving the weapons on their owner. 
</P>
<P>
The "requirement of affirmative action by the property owner, including the 
preparation of formal pleadings, the payment of a filing fee, and subsequent 
participation in all the formal procedural devices of a Superior Court action, 
must be deemed unreasonable," Froehlich wrote.

AFTER A 6-YEAR SILENCE, BEGIN BEMOANS ICY TIES WITH EGYPT

<TEXT>
<P>
Former Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, breaking a six-year silence, 
Sunday praised Israel's decade of peace with Egypt but bemoaned their still icy 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
Commenting on political issues at length for the first time since becoming a 
recluse in 1983, Begin told Israel Radio that the 1979 U.S.-brokered 
Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty remains the only basis for a Middle East 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
The 75-year-old Begin took issue with Washington's latest peace move, opening a 
dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization that broke a 13-year U.S. 
boycott of Yasser Arafat's organization. 
</P>
<P>
"This is in my opinion a negative, harmful phenomenon," he said in his 
characteristically hoarse voice. "The Americans, our friends, are in essence 
asked to reconsider this matter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Absolute Normalization' 
</P>
<P>
"Until now, we have achieved something very important -- a peace treaty with 
Egypt, the largest Arab state. . . . It is impossible to talk about 
celebrations so long as there is no absolute normalization," Begin said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want a full peace, normalization in all fields," he said in an interview 
marking the 10th anniversary of the treaty-signing in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Begin said he still opposes formation of a Palestinian state in the occupied 
West Bank and Gaza Strip as "a danger to Israel and the entire Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
He complained that Palestinians persist in clashing with Israeli soldiers in 
the occupied lands and sending guerrillas to raid northern Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"If this isn't terror, it is difficult to know what terror is," he said, 
referring to Arafat's renunciation of terror and recognition of Israel's right 
to exist that led to the Americans opening up a dialogue with PLO. 
</P>
<P>
Begin has lived in virtual seclusion in Jerusalem, leaving his apartment only 
eight times since his resignation in 1983 after reportedly becoming depressed 
over the death of his wife Aliza and Israel's losses in the 1982 Lebanon war. 
</P>
<P>
The once-fiery orator, who shared the Nobel Peace Prize with the late Egyptian 
President Anwar Sadat for the 1978 Camp David accords that led to the treaty, 
sounded weak. But he spoke clearly and showed a familiarity with recent 
political developments.

Inmates took over a prison farm on Sunday, seizing guards and visitors as 
hostages, according to news reports. 
</P>
<P>
TV station Notisiete broadcast unconfirmed reports that five people were killed 
-- three guards and two inmates. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters and Red Cross workers reportedly were seen entering the prison 
with five stretchers. 
</P>
<P>
The station said Easter was a visiting day and that about 250 prisoners were 
holding an estimated 400 people hostage, including guards, other inmates and 
visiting families, among them women and children. 
</P>
<P>
It did not say what set off the uprising at the Pavon prison farm, 12 miles 
east of Guatemala City. 
</P>
<P>
Notisiete said that national police were called in and that additional army 
units were on standby. 
</P>
<P>
Other reports said officials had tried to bargain with prisoners to get them to 
surrender rifles they grabbed from prison guards. After a shoot-out, most of 
the rifles were recovered. Negotiations were under way, according to the 
reports.

SUDAN'S NEW CABINET BACKS PLAN FOR CEASE-FIRE, TALKS WITH REBELS

<P>
In its first official act, Sudan's new coalition Cabinet on Sunday endorsed a 
tentative peace agreement with southern rebels that calls for an immediate 
cease-fire in the country's six-year civil war. 
</P>
<P>
The peace plan also calls for an end to the state of emergency in force since 
1985 and the suspension of plans to introduce Islamic law until a national 
constitutional conference can be held. 
</P>
<P>
Information and Culture Minister Hussein abu Saleh told reporters the Cabinet, 
which was sworn in Saturday, decided to form a committee headed by Foreign 
Minister Sidahmed Hussein to start contacts with the rebel Sudan People's 
Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels, led by John Garang, negotiated the agreement in November with the 
centrist Democratic Unionist Party, then the senior partner in Prime Minister 
Sadek Mahdi's Cabinet. Parliament rejected the plan, prompting the Democratic 
Unionists to quit the government. 
</P>
<P>
Mahdi, under pressure from the army, later agreed to form a more broadly based 
government and to pursue peace talks with the rebels. The Democratic Unionists 
then rejoined the government.

DOZENS SIGN PETITIONS OPPOSING ADMINISTRATION ROLE IN MISSOURI CASE; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE DEPT. LAWYERS PROTEST ABORTION STANCE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Justice Department is facing an internal protest over the Bush 
Administration's aggressive effort to persuade the Supreme Court to reverse its 
rulings legalizing abortion, according to department sources. 
</P>
<P>
Several dozen attorneys have signed petitions circulating within the department 
in the last week criticizing the Administration's attempt to turn a relatively 
narrow abortion appeal from Missouri into an all-out attack on the high court's 
1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the department blamed the court's once-solid pro-choice majority 
for "the deep divisions in American society" over the abortion issue. Its brief 
called the Roe decision "flawed" and "unworkable" and urged that it be 
overturned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Court Grants Request 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Supreme Court granted the department's request to have its 
solicitor general participate in the April 26 oral argument in the Missouri 
case to press for the reversal of the Roe decision. 
</P>
<P>
At least 50 government lawyers have signed protest petitions, and more 
signatures will be sought this week, said one government source. "We believe 
that every woman has the right to make her own decision about whether or not to 
continue her pregnancy," the petition states. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the protesting attorneys also say it is unseemly for top department 
lawyers to essentially ignore the issues presented by the Missouri case in 
order to seek a more sweeping ruling on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The Missouri law in question forbids the use of public funds or public 
employees for "encouraging" or "assisting" abortions. An appellate court struck 
down the law last year as an unconstitutional attempt to infringe on a woman's 
right to an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
But even if the justices were to reverse a lower court ruling and reinstate the 
law, they need not tamper with the underlying Roe doctrine giving a woman the 
right to choose abortion. More than 95% of the abortions in Missouri take place 
in private clinics and are unaffected by the state law, according to lawyers on 
both sides of the case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shrugs Shoulders 
</P>
<P>
David Runkel, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh's chief spokesman, said the attorney 
general is aware of the protest and has reacted "with a shrug of his 
shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh "recognizes that everybody has their right to free speech. He 
understands this is a particularly divisive issue, and that there are a lot of 
strong views on this," Runkel said. "If they are seeking a change in the 
(government's) position on this, that's not going to happen," he added. 
</P>
<P>
During the presidential campaign, President Bush said repeatedly he opposed 
abortion. And Thornburgh, who was first appointed by former President Ronald 
Reagan and retained by Bush, has been known as a strong foe of the Roe ruling 
since his days as governor of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as Missouri Atty. Gen. William L. Webster decided to challenge the 
appellate court decision, U.S. Justice Department officials sought to raise the 
stakes. Outgoing U.S. Assistant Atty. Gen. William Bradford Reynolds contacted 
Webster last fall and persuaded him to add a line to his initial appeal to the 
high court suggesting the case could be used as a basis to "reconsider" the Roe 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Officially Urge Appeal 
</P>
<P>
Two days after Bush was elected, the Justice Department announced it would 
officially urge the court to hear the Missouri appeal. That was followed by the 
Feb. 23 brief urging that the Missouri case be used as the basis for entirely 
overruling the Roe decision. 
</P>
<P>
Even without the Justice Department's active involvement, the Missouri appeal 
(Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services, 88-605) would have drawn intense 
interest because of the high court's changed makeup. In 1986, when the Roe 
doctrine was last affirmed, it came on a 5-4 vote. Since then, one pro-choice 
member, Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., retired and was replaced by Reagan's third 
appointee, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
The switch created speculation that the court was at least ready to alter its 
firm pro-choice stand, and possibly, overturn the Roe ruling.

RARE CONDOR LAYS 'EASTER' EGG AT L.A. ZOO

Zookeepers kept watch Sunday on a special Easter egg in hopes that it holds 
what could be the first California condor chick to hatch in Los Angeles. 
</P>

The large pale aqua egg was apparently laid early Sunday by Cachuma, a 
6-year-old California condor, who was found tending it about 6 a.m. with her 
mate, Cayama, also 6, said Los Angeles Zoo spokeswoman Deborah Pollack. 
</P>
<P>
Condor keepers should know in about a week whether the egg is fertile. If it 
is, it would be the first at the Los Angeles Zoo, home to 14 of the 28 
California condors left in the world. The others are at the San Diego Wild 
Animal Park. 
</P>
<P>
Cachuma laid an egg about a month ago, but it was infertile. Pollack said the 
Easter egg is the first time a condor female in captivity has 
"double-clutched," or laid two eggs in rapid succession. 
</P>
<P>
"We have great hopes for this one," Pollack said. If fertile, the egg could 
hatch in a little less than two months. 
</P>
<P>
Condor keepers placed the egg in an incubator after using a complex set of 
maneuvers to remove it from its parents' "condorminium," or cage, without 
disturbing them. 
</P>
<P>
Two other fertile eggs have been laid at the San Diego Wild Animal Park. One 
was laid about a month ago and the other produced a chick, named Moloko, nearly 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, the last known free-flying bird was captured on Easter Day, 
1987, in the government's controversial plan to save the huge birds, which are 
part of the vulture family, from extinction.

Worlds of Wonder Bailout: Investor Eli Jacobs of New York will pay $27.6 
million to revitalize Worlds of Wonder Inc., according to a plan of 
reorganization and disclosure statement filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. The 
documents, filed in Oakland, contain details of a five-year reorganization of 
the troubled Fremont, Calif., toy company, which last month announced an 
agreement to sell to investors headed by Jacobs, the majority stockholder of a 
group buying the Baltimore Orioles. Worlds of Wonder which became a success 
with such toys as Lazer Tag and the talking bear Teddy Ruxpin, filed under 
Chapter 11 of bankruptcy laws in December, 1987. According to the 
reorganization plan, Jacobs has agreed to buy the company's inventory and 
assets for $10 million and will pay an extra $17.6 million for stock and notes.

GM SAYS BOOK ON PEROT CLASH IS 'INACCURATE' 
</P>

General Motors Corp. says the book "Irreconcilable Differences: Ross Perot vs. 
General Motors" is an "inaccurate and misleading" portrayal of the clash 
between GM Chairman Roger B. Smith and H. Ross Perot, former head of a giant 
computer firm acquired by GM for $2.5 billion in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
GM, in its first official comment on the new book, said Friday that it "does a 
disservice to the hundreds of thousands of dedicated people at General Motors 
and EDS (Electronic Data Systems Corp.)." 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, GM also expressed concern that the book is being 
published at a time that its suit against Perot is about to come to trial. 
</P>
<P>
GM contends that Perot violated terms of a $743-million buyout under which the 
outspoken critic of the auto maker was terminated as head of EDS and thrown off 
GM's board. 
</P>
<P>
"While we do not think the book fairly tells the GM side of the story, we feel 
it inappropriate to cite its specific inaccuracies because of pending 
litigation," GM said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refused to Be Interviewed 
</P>
<P>
Smith, however, declined to be interviewed for the book, which was written by 
New York Times reporter Doron P. Levin and scheduled to officially go on sale 
April 6 -- the same day the GM vs. Perot trial begins in Fairfax, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Levin, who resigned as a Detroit reporter for the Wall Street Journal to write 
the book last year, now heads the New York Times' Detroit bureau. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can say is their statement differs from what I had been told previously 
by GM attorneys, who said the book is accurate and well written," Levin said in 
reaction to GM's statement, released while the car maker was closed for Good 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The book recounts the incidents that led Perot and Smith to feud publicly in 
1986 and result in the buyout, which gave Perot twice the value of his GM stock 
holdings and enraged many corporate shareholders who charged that the auto 
maker with wasting its money.

U.S. machine tool shipments soared 50.1% in February to $228.4 million from 
$152.20 million in January, up sharply from a 37.2% rise in February, 1988, the 
National Machine Tool Builders' Assn. said. 
</P>
<P>
In its monthly statistical report, the tool industry trade association said in 
a report to be released today that total machine tool orders also rose, 
climbing 22.3% to $282.2 million last month from January's total of $230.8 
million. February orders fell 5.3% from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Orders of metal forming tools rose 4.9% last month to $67 million from 
January's $63.85 million, the association said. Last year, February tool orders 
totaled $47.65 million. 
</P>
<P>
The association said metal cutting tool orders rose 28.9% last month from 
January to $215.2 million, but were down 14% from $250.4 million in February 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Metal forming shipments totaled $77.75 million in February, up 57.1% from 
January's $49.35 million total, while metal cutting shipments rose 46.7% to 
$150.9 million in February. 
</P>
<P>
The association said the backlog of orders in February was $2.32 billion, up 
from the January backlog of $2.26 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In the first two months of this year, metal cutting and forming tools were down 
13.8% at $513.10 million, but cutting and forming shipments increased 22.9% to 
$380.65 million.

Checks Go to Farmers: More than $18 million was mailed to 6,860 farmers in 10 
states who settled a legal dispute with Chubb Corp. over crop insurance 
applications rejected during the 1988 drought. Lawrence Kane Jr., a Cincinnati 
lawyer who was appointed by U.S. District Judge Carl Rubin last fall to oversee 
the payments, said the farmers should be mailed the remaining 50% of their 
settlement payments by late April. Kane said he and his staff are still trying 
to resolve objections by about 930 farmers who oppose the $36.6-million 
settlement with Chubb Corp., based in Warren, N.J., and its insurance 
subsidiaries. The class-action case involves 7,484 farmers in Illinois, Iowa, 
Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Tennessee, Minnesota, Michigan, Missouri and 
Wisconsin.

IN SURPRISE MOVE, VINTERS PROPOSE INCREASING STATE WINE TAX BY 900% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California wine makers have baffled the experts by proposing legislation to 
hike state wine taxes by 900%. 
</P>
<P>
After an approach by the 540-winery Wine Institute, bills were introduced last 
week by state Sen. Alfred Alquist and Assemblyman Dominic Cortese, both San 
Jose Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
"This is weird, completely unheard of," said Lou Gomberg, the dean of wine 
industry consultants with nearly 60 years of experience. "This is totally 
without precedent." 
</P>
<P>
Wine Institute President John A. De Luca said that was about the reaction he 
got from Alquist and Cortese when they heard the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The state tax collector already gathers about $190 million annually in taxes on 
wine; the new taxes would raise an additional $10 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
De Luca said the answer to questions about the unusual political move is that 
wine makers were convinced that they had to propose the higher taxes before 
voters were offered a tax-hiking initiative and to prove his industry's 
"credibility" and "responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
The $7-billion industry would rather submit to the "give and take" of tax 
questions in legislative committee than get hit with what he characterized as 
the take-it-or-leave-it of an initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Looming large in the background is the organized national "neo-prohibitionist" 
movement; suggestions that alcohol causes cancer and deformed babies; 
Proposition 65 and warning signs in restaurants, and federally mandated warning 
labels on alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 65 required that businesses employing 10 or more people -- such as 
most restaurants -- must warn people if they are being exposed to chemicals 
determined to cause cancer or birth defects. It led to signs being posted in 
many dining establishments. 
</P>
<P>
De Luca said the industry voted for the tax for "enlightened self-interest . . 
. we're saying we don't like taxes but this is an investment in our future and 
the future of this state . . . this is for us an act of responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
The measures by Alquist and Cortese would raise the tax on table wine from 1 
cent a gallon to 10 cents a gallon, and on dessert wines (port, sherry) from 2 
cents a gallon to 20 cents a gallon. Champagne, already taxed 30 cents a gallon 
by the state, was not included. 
</P>
<P>
According to Carolyn Martini, president of Napa Valley's Louis M. Martini 
Winery, the institute's board ratified the tax issue March 14 without 
objection. 
</P>
<P>
She called it "meeting the devil half-way." 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the pressure is on from all quarters on all alcoholic beverages," 
she said. "I think there was kind of an industry feeling that we hadn't had a 
state tax increase since Prohibition. This is a unique situation . . . at the 
institute meeting nobody argued against it -- nobody." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone saw it that way, however. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand this," said Phil Hiaring Jr., editor of the trade 
publication Wines &amp; Vines. "I just don't see giving in without a fight . . 
. why toss in the towel before the fight?" 
</P>
<P>
Syndicated wine writer Jerry Mead, whose column appears in 25 newspapers, said, 
"It's my opinion that the industry is shooting itself in the foot. . . . I 
don't think it will stop the neo-drys from using the initiative process to 
attack wine and other alcoholic beverages." 
</P>
<P>
De Luca explained that the tax move was done by "consensus" of the institute's 
executive committee and its board of directors as a means to deal with "a whole 
new puritanism" in California and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The tax move, he said, "is the price of credibility. You just can't do things 
and put out press releases and expect people today to say anything other than 
'that's self-serving.' "

MEMO: RINGING IT UP 
</P>

At a store in Morrow, Ga., supermarket giant Kroger Co. is taking another step 
with the scanner concept that it pioneered: At two of eight checkout lanes, 
customers may unload their carts and scan items themselves. The products then 
travel along a conveyor belt equipped with a sensor to make sure that all items 
have been "rung up." The shopper then gets an itemized receipt and pays a 
cashier. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fairly user-friendly system," said Paul Bernish, a spokesman for 
Cincinnati-based Kroger. Although Kroger plans to continue testing the nearly 
3-year-old program to "work out some of the kinks," Bernish acknowledged that 
the company has no plans to expand the idea to its other 1,234 stores. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the manpower and resources to devote to this project," said 
Bernish, noting that Kroger has been undergoing a costly corporate overhaul 
since last September. He added that there is tremendous "expense involved in 
trying to make a store totally scannable." 
</P>
<P>
Who likes self-service scanning? Not surprisingly, Bernish said, older 
customers haven't taken to it much. But younger shoppers have. "There is a 
perception that it saves time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another pilot program could help eliminate what many bargain-minded shoppers 
dread: the need to clip and keep track of coupons. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1987, a unit of Citicorp, the New York-based financial company, 
set up an electronic coupon program with the 18-store Ukrops supermarket chain 
in Richmond, Va. About 6,500 volunteers received cards to use when shopping. 
Each month they are also given a list of 40 items for which they can 
automatically receive cents-off credit. 
</P>
<P>
Each time participants visit a Ukrops store, they hand the card to the cashier, 
who runs it through a machine. Scanning equipment then captures a record of 
that person's purchases. If any items bought are on the electronic-coupon list, 
the equipment records the deduction. 
</P>
<P>
"For the consumer in the long run, this saves bother on clipping (coupons), and 
they get $500 per year of coupons," said William J. Ahearn, a Citicorp vice 
president. Ukrops gains because it can tailor promotions to individuals or 
families. And down the road, Ahearn added, Citicorp could benefit by having 
supermarket customers use debit cards tied to Citibank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about precise. Dwayne H. Rapp, operations manager for Stork Symbology in 
Monrovia, one of about 10 U.S. manufacturers of the bar codes that go on 
product packages, said each code must be correct to within 4/10,000ths of an 
inch. But to be on the safe side, Rapp said, "we don't like to send out any 
differences plus or minus 2/10,000ths." 
</P>
<P>
Grocery shoppers may benefit from the increased speed and accuracy that bar 
code scanning affords, but many cashiers pay a high price for the technology. 
Many checkout stands require clerks to stretch, reach, bend or stand in 
uncomfortable positions for long periods. Typically, cashiers move their wrists 
back and forth over a scanner up to 600 times an hour, in many cases twisting 
items so that the laser can read the bar code. Over an eight-hour shift, 
cashiers may handle more than three tons of groceries, according to a United 
Food and Commercial Workers report on problems stemming from scanner equipment. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the repetition, many workers suffer from cumulative trauma 
disorders, or repetitive trauma injuries. Back and shoulder strain and hand and 
wrist disorders, such as tendinitis and carpal tunnel syndrome, are common. 
</P>
<P>
One survey of 1,345 members of UFCW Local 899 in Santa Barbara found that 62.5% 
of female cashiers aged 18 to 49 reported symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, 
such as pain, numbness or tingling in the hands, wrists or fingers. 
</P>
<P>
When scanners first came on the scene, customers frequently complained that 
prices rung up at the register often differed from those in advertisements or 
on shelf tags, frequently in the store's favor. As supermarkets have gotten 
better at keeping their in-house computer price lists up to date, the problem 
has diminished considerably. 
</P>
<P>
But "it took legal action to improve compliance," contended Nahan Gluck, who 
carries the unwieldy title of deputy director of the Los Angeles County 
Department of Agricultural Commissioner/Weights and Measures. His agency is 
responsible for ensuring, for example, that boxes contain as many ounces of 
cereal as they advertise. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, investigations by Weights and Measures have led local and 
state officials to sue several Southland supermarket chains for pricing 
violations. Some stores have been forced to pay sizable fines for overcharging.

THOSE MYSTERIOUS STRIPES MAY STUMP CONSUMERS, BUT THEY LAY IT ALL OUT IN BLACK

Safeway Stores figured out a few years ago that shoppers bought more candy bars 
when they were stocked at front-end checkstands than when placed only on racks 
in the middle of stores. So the Oakland-based chain started stocking the sweets 
up front. 
</P>
<P>
Ralphs Grocery recently found in a store-by-store analysis that sales of fresh 
pasta had "really exploded" in certain of its locations, according to Al 
Marasca, executive vice president of the Compton firm. That enabled the company 
to expand the space for that product only in those stores where demand was 
greatest. 
</P>
<P>
What led to these changes were bar codes, those ubiquitous black and white 
stripes on products from peanut butter to kitty litter. To shoppers, the codes 
are best known for being pulled by a cashier across a window-like device in the 
checkout stand, which somehow translates them into a price that flashes onto a 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
But bar codes also have a secret life -- as speedy providers of facts and 
figures about what people buy and why. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to streamlining the checkout process and saving grocers the cost of 
tagging many items, bar codes are being used increasingly to help manufacturers 
and retailers make smarter decisions about which products to sell and how to 
market them. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers depend on the data to find out how well their products are moving 
and what promotions work best to stimulate sales. At Ralston Purina Co. in St. 
Louis, maker of Chex cereal, Wonder Bread, dog food and other products, bar 
code data is "relied upon in different degrees in our different divisions, but 
all of them do use it," said spokesman Patrick Farrell. 
</P>
<P>
The technology, which uses laser beams to scan bar codes, is worthy of "Star 
Wars." Scanning was pioneered in the early 1970s by Kroger, the big 
Cincinnati-based grocery company. Now, according to industry figures, nearly 
17,000 of the nation's 30,000 supermarkets (not including small mom-and-pop 
stores) have laser scanning equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how the process works: 
</P>
<P>
Before any information about a product can be collected, a supermarket company 
makes an entry in a host computer at headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The file usually contains a 10-digit number represented by the bar code plus 
the current price. The first five digits stand for the manufacturer, whose 
number is assigned by the Uniform Code Council in Dayton, Ohio. The council, 
which maintains a database of about 60,000 companies from 77 different 
countries, also determines the specifications for each bar code, including the 
width of stripes and the contrast between the bars and the background. 
</P>
<P>
The next five digits, assigned by each manufacturer, signify the product, with 
variations by flavor, size or weight. A 16-ounce box of Rice Krispies, for 
example, would have a slightly different code from a 24-ounce package. And an 
8-ounce container of strawberry-flavored Dannon yogurt would have a different 
number from an 8-ounce container of blueberry. 
</P>
<P>
Back at the checkout stand, a cashier passes the bar code across a window 
embedded in the counter that covers the inner workings of the laser scanner. 
The scanner can read the code in the proper order, even if the item is upside 
down. If the scanner recognizes the code as one contained in the store's 
computer, it sounds a beep and flashes a brief product description and the 
price on a screen. It also tallies another sale in that store for that product. 
</P>
<P>
Although stores could analyze the data on a daily basis, "most don't have the 
time," noted Jerry Morton, who runs Store Systems Consulting in Lawrence, Kan., 
and advises supermarkets about scanning equipment. 
</P>
<P>
More commonly, the headquarters computer retrieves information on a weekly 
basis from each store, and then the chain sells the data to services that 
analyze it for manufacturers. Some large chains get as much as $1 million a 
year just for selling the data, according to Tony MacNeary, vice president of 
retailer client services for one such company, Information Resources Inc. 
</P>
<P>
IRI and A. C. Nielsen Co., both based in Chicago, use the vast stores of data 
to track the success or failure of products and promotions. By tracking data 
from a representative sample of stores, these companies can analyze how an 
individual item (say, Diet Pepsi) or company (PepsiCo) is faring during a 
certain period or in a given region. They can also determine whether sales of 
bean dip go up if a supermarket puts taco chips on sale. 
</P>
<P>
"For the retailer or manufacturer, we can see whether it's worth more to run a 
feature ad in a newspaper or a huge display in a store," MacNeary said. 
"Combining them might be even more effective." 
</P>
<P>
As part of its service, Nielsen analyzes a wealth of data from 15,000 U.S. 
households. Using special hand-held scanning equipment at home, participating 
residents scan the groceries and other products they have bought. They note 
such factors as whether the price was marked down or whether they used a 
coupon. Nielsen also takes into account what magazines and newspapers these 
people read to find out what ads they may have seen. Participants are rewarded 
with gifts and trips. 
</P>
<P>
Although manufacturers have started putting such data to good use, retailers 
have yet to tap the full potential of scanner information, many observers say. 
Instead of using scanner data and computers to develop automated reordering of 
products, an estimated 98% of the nation's groceries still use manual methods. 
Usually, store personnel must walk the aisles with hand-held scanners that read 
bar code tags on the shelves.

"Nobody is getting more than 10% of value out of the data," said W. Frank Dell, 
vice president in the New York office of Cresap, a Towers Perrin company that 
consults for food and consumer products companies. 
</P>
<P>
Safeway Stores is an exception. In May, 1983, the big chain hired a 
developmental psychologist named Louise H. Booth to head an in-house marketing 
research organization. Her team collects and analyzes scanner data for other 
retailers and for manufacturers, such as Procter &amp; Gamble, Ralston Purina 
and PepsiCo. 
</P>
<P>
"We not only earn some money by doing research," said Booth, manager of Safeway 
Scanner Marketing Research Services. "We learn the answers to questions (our 
clients are) asking." Safeway also analyzes its own data, looking for ways to 
boost sales, as it did with candy bars. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with scanner data, manufacturers can get influential retailers such as 
Safeway on their side by proving that shelf space for their products can mean 
added profit all around. 
</P>
<P>
Take kiwis. In 1984, the New Zealand Kiwifruit Authority went to Safeway to 
learn how best to market the exotic fruit to U.S. customers. In a series of 
tests, Safeway showed that added display in the produce area plus special 
advertising and a reduced price could boost weekly kiwi sales to more than 450 
per store from 25. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so useful that we're thinking of updating it in the next year or two," 
said Hillary A. Brick, with the kiwi marketing board in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
(To be sure, kiwis and other fruits and vegetables don't have bar codes affixed 
to them. To ring up produce purchases, cashiers punch in a two-digit code that 
prompts the computer to look up the price for that item. The data is then 
analyzed in the same way as other bar code information.) 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, as the system becomes even more sophisticated, Booth expects 
Safeway's service to help manufacturers target customers more effectively. 
"P&amp;G might want to send a coupon to people who buy disposable diapers, in 
particular people who buy the other brand, or to anybody who buys baby food," 
she said. "This is a way for P&amp;G to get a mailing list based on the 
purchase behavior of a household."

ITALY SEEKS TO DELAY STEEL PLANT CLOSINGS

Italy has asked the European Commission to postpone the controversial closure 
of three steel plants, saying there has been an upturn in the steel market. 
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said Italy wanted the closure of a blast furnace at 
Bagnoli near Naples to be delayed by a year until the end of June, 1990. It 
wanted similar delays at plants in Turin and Sesto San Giovanni near Milan, 
both due to shut at the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
The Bagnoli plan, which would involve cutting 2,000 jobs, sparked rioting in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
Other governments that have cut production say cuts in Italy are needed to help 
make the European steel industry competitive.

ON YOUR OWN: IS HONESTY ALWAYS THE BEST POLICY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. HOWARD HALPERN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is being honest in romantic relationships always the best policy? That's the 
question raised by a Cincinnati reader, Joan Farrell. In a column about 
"commitmentphobia," I wrote that it is a well-kept male secret that a man often 
tells a woman he is afraid of commitment when the truth is that he would prefer 
not to be committed, or at least not to her. I said, "It feels easier and 
kinder to say that he is afraid than to say he would rather not be committed or 
that he does not care enough about her." 
</P>
<P>
Farrell writes that a man doing this "ill serves the woman. I am amazed that 
you seem to approve of this behavior. I find it dishonest and also a guilt 
mitigator for the man. However, there need be no guilt if one chooses to end a 
relationship with anyone. An honest but tactful approach is the best." 
</P>
<P>
In general, I agree. But there are times when honesty and tact do not go 
together very well. Let me ask you, Ms. Farrell, would you tell a very nice man 
that you wouldn't go out with him because you found him ugly and unappealing? 
Or would you tell a caring and decent man that you were ending it because he 
was a dud as a lover? 
</P>
<P>
However, there are times when honesty can serve a person well. If someone says, 
"You are so desperate and needy that it scares me off," or "You are so 
self-centered and ungiving that I feel unseen by you," the other person could 
gain important insight. I often suggest that people say simply, "I'm sorry but 
I don't feel what I need to feel in order to continue this relationship," but 
they have to be prepared to be asked repeatedly, "Why not?" 
</P>
<P>
Responding to a letter I printed from a man whose girlfriend resented the time 
he spent with his best friend, a 29-year-old Michigan man wrote: "His letter 
struck a chord with me. A similar situation ended the relationship between my 
ex-girlfriend and myself. She said that I was 'too close' to a friend and saw 
him 'too often.' I asked if she thought something sexual was going on and she 
wouldn't answer. Like the man who wrote to you, I reduced how often I saw my 
friend. Then one night when I was supposed to see her, he called and said his 
father had been in an accident. He asked if I could come to the hospital, and I 
said, 'Of course.' When I called my girlfriend, she became furious. That was 
the last straw for me. . . . Maybe that incident makes her sound self-centered 
and immature, but she wasn't that way about anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Interesting. Since I've now received two letters on this problem, I wonder how 
widespread it is. I'd like to hear from other men who have found that the women 
in their lives resented their male friendships, and from women who found that 
the men in their lives resented their friendships with other women. 
</P>
<P>
I recently responded to a 68-year-old woman who was unhappy that her children 
were not presenting her with grandchildren despite her attempts to pressure 
them into it. I wrote that having children to please one's parents was not a 
good idea. 
</P>
<P>
Two Upstate New York women responded with suggestions. Patricia Kaufman wrote: 
"You missed a wonderful opportunity to suggest that she work as a volunteer 
with the Adoptive Grandparents Program." And Elaine Schreiber wrote: "Many 
grandparents and grandchildren live miles apart. This woman could adopt a 
grandchild in her own special way and create the loving bond that I also hope 
to have with grandchildren. It would benefit the woman and enrich a child's 
life as well."

LOVE AND WAR IN THE FUTURISTIC CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City, Not Long After by Pat Murphy (Doubleday: $17.95; 242 pages) 
</P>
<P>
This novel is described on its blurb as an example of "magic realism," as if, 
when you come to think of it, all reality weren't magic. "The City, Not Long 
After" proceeds off the hypothesis that the world, as we know it, has already 
"ended," and that the "end" has not turned out to be such a bad thing. 
</P>
<P>
The place is San Francisco. The end has come in the form of a great plague. The 
circumstances surrounding this plague were these: Back in the 1980s, peace 
groups from all over the world heard of a monastery in the Himalayas that 
sheltered a group of monkeys reputed to bring peace wherever they lived. 
Peace-seekers concocted a plan whereby these monkeys might be shipped to world 
capitals everywhere -- making use of them as potent symbols. The monkeys indeed 
brought peace in a big way: They carried fleas that began a pandemic that 
killed off 99.9% of the population. Now during the time of this novel, there's 
nothing left to fight about. 
</P>
<P>
Only 100 or so people live, these days, in San Francisco. There's "Books," a 
nice man who tends to the library, "The Machine," who believes he survived the 
plague because he was a machine, Mrs. Migdale, who writes the weekly 
newsletter, a nice older man who creates glass mazes, and so on. Across the 
Golden Gate, over in Marin County, farmers labor, but San Francisco itself has 
become an artists' colony. (There don't seem to be any babies around, but maybe 
it's too soon.) The artists live a carefree, some might even say feckless, life 
in the city, working on that glass maze, constructing elaborate wind chimes, 
putting up solar-operated spiders, generally living the life of the artist. 
</P>
<P>
The question might then come up: Who is to be the audience for all this art? 
But a young man, Danny-boy, who's lived in the city all his life, explains it 
this way to Jax, a girl whose mother lived out in the sticks and who has just 
moved into town: "Sometimes you make things that won't last just for the 
pleasure of making them. . . . When you make something beautiful, you change. 
You put something of yourself into the thing you make. You're a different 
person when you're done." And, "While you change yourself, you change the 
world. Make it more your own." 
</P>
<P>
These city folk, then, living off the truck garden in Union Square, biking down 
deserted streets to Ocean Beach, feasting on leftover caviar from emptied-out 
department stores, are living an idyllic life. 
</P>
<P>
But -- wouldn't you know it? -- some Jell-O-brain named General "Four Star" 
Miles has got bit all over again by the military bug. He's formed an army, and 
is tramping all over Northern California from Sacramento to San Jose, occupying 
towns, imprisoning innocent passers-by for questioning, extolling the virtues 
of democracy, and so on. He intends, naturally, to invade San Francisco, make 
an example of the dissidents: All those things that military men hold so dear. 
</P>
<P>
Jax, in fact, has been instructed by a mysterious metallic angel to journey 
into the city to warn the inhabitants, and the middle third of the book 
consists of Jax's own process of getting "civilized" -- engaging in 
conversation with "Books," chatting along with "The Machine," and falling in 
love with Danny-boy. But Jax is also honor-bound to explain to them the 
exigencies of war. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Urban Warfare 
</P>
<P>
Finally, General Four Star invades, with mayhem on his mind. But Danny-boy has 
made an important strategic decision: What if he and his friends treat this war 
as an art project? This then develops into an engaging tale of guerrilla 
warfare: The real soldiers ride around on horses and in jeeps. They carry guns 
and threaten death: The artists use purple smoke and jars of cockroaches, angry 
wasps and cheap perfume laced with LSD. The value systems are Danny-boy's 
love-at-all-costs vs. Jax's "sometimes-you've-got-to-defend-yourself" 
philosophy. Both Jax and Danny-boy learn from each other. And -- ghosts, angels 
and the city itself pitch in against the bad guys. 
</P>
<P>
This novel is simple to a fault. Just hovering at the young-adult edge in terms 
of linguistic sophistication. But what's wrong with that? The ideas themselves 
here are subtle and interesting. It may be argued that the sooner people get 
exposed to this kind of material, the better.

MUSIC CENTER REVIVES GLORY OF 'OTELLO' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Otello" is back. 
</P>
<P>
Two-and-a-half years ago, Music Center Opera put its first production on the 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion stage -- an "Otello" directed by Gotz Friedrich, 
designed by Gunther Schneider-Siemssen and featuring the fledgling company's 
artistic consultant, Placido Domingo, in the title role. Saturday, it revived 
that effort. 
</P>
<P>
There are repertory and economy subtexts here, besides a reprise of inaugural 
glories, but having such a production in stock already -- and it is just one 
among several -- says much for the high aims and accomplishment of the company. 
Next month returns "Salome," the widely acclaimed and traveled production also 
from Music Center Opera's first season. 
</P>
<P>
"Otello" was not received with quite the same degree of enthusiasm and 
admiration as "Salome," and it seems to have changed in ways large and small. 
Most important, Jeannette Aster -- Friedrich's associate director for the 
original -- has inherited the staging, and gone are any precursory hints of 
hysteria in Otello's character. 
</P>
<P>
The Moor, of course, remains susceptible to sudden, larger-than-life emotions. 
But he begins as a bona-fide hero. 
</P>
<P>
That suited Domingo well. From his clarion "Esultate!" entrance, he exerted the 
easy authority of one used to command, and let the overwhelming feeling of the 
Love Duet reveal tenderness and sincerity rather than weakness. He sang freely 
and cleanly, supporting both legato lyricism and incoherent mania with 
appropriate sound, and made the swift blossoming of Iago's seeds of suspicion 
as dramatically credible as possible. 
</P>
<P>
As Iago, Justino Diaz was an equally imposing presence, vocally and 
theatrically. The erstwhile bass had little trouble with the range, and proved 
as cynically menacing in pianissimo insinuation as in bold incitement or iron 
triumph. 
</P>
<P>
In her company debut, Ilona Tokody offered a sweet, sympathetic portrait of 
Desdemona. Her warm soprano, though, was occasionally compromised with a slow, 
wide vibrato that lent a rather matronly aspect to her vocal characterization. 
</P>
<P>
Conductor John De Main, an early substitute for Lawrence Foster, let the 
bolstered Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra participate fully in the drama. He kept 
the action alertly paced, and accompanied sensitively while attending to 
orchestral, psychological and narrative nuance. 
</P>
<P>
A pity, then, that Aster did not trust Verdi's vivid orchestral Maelstrom to 
launch the opera. The curtain rose on the dark and stormy Cyprus night, not to 
Verdi's music but to the sounds of apparently a wind-machine and taped surf. 
Only after these spuriously realistic cues could the music begin, and it must 
be reinforced with more artificial nature. 
</P>
<P>
In general, Aster seemed to emphasize the more realistic and overtly theatrical 
elements of Friedrich's staging, rather than its intermittment bows to 
stylization and symbolism. Certainly it was the stony realism of 
Schneider-Siemssen's looming, ultimately claustrophobic set that was played to, 
rather its quirky abstractions. 
</P>
<P>
The chorus, supplied by the Los Angeles Master Chorale, contributed its own 
heroics to the storm scene, and made its presence effective in the other massed 
scenes with clear, resonant singing. The Los Angeles Children's Chorus sang 
prettily, if not in complete coordination, in presenting Desdemona with 
flowers. 
</P>
<P>
From the 1986 cast, Jonathan Mack returned as a blandly befuddled, lyrically 
ardent Cassio; Alice Baker as a forceful, supportive Emilia; Stephen Plummer as 
a light-voiced, suitably ineffectual Roderigo; and Michael Gallup as a bluff 
Montano. Louis Lebherz introduced a solid, dignified Lodovico.

An early morning fire gutted rock 'n' roll pioneer Chuck Berry's recording 
studio in Wentzville, Mo., on Saturday, injuring three firemen and destroying 
the studio, "quite a bit" of recently recorded audiotapes and some old 
nightclub furniture, officials said. The 7,500-square-foot, concrete-block 
studio built in 1959 is one of several buildings on Berry's farm about 30 miles 
west of St. Louis. The musician was not home at the time of the blaze. ALEENE

Tom Kirby, who has been president and general manager of Gannett-owned KOCO-TV 
in Oklahoma City, takes over today as executive producer of "USA Today on TV." 
It's the second major management change in recent months for the syndicated 
magazine series that's produced by GTG, a partnership between Grant Tinker and 
Gannett. Earlier, Jim Bellows, a former Los Angeles newspaper executive, was 
called in as managing editor to resuscitate the show following its debut last 
September. Bellows will continue as a consultant. With the changing of the 
guard, Grant Tinker, president of GTG Entertainment, assured the "USA-TV" staff 
that the program will remain on the air for its two-year commitment. He called 
Bellows "a brilliant editor . . . (who has) completed the task of reshaping the 
show and giving it new direction." Said Bellows: "I came in to do what they 
wanted and I did it. The show has a good, long future, and I feel good about 
the show." ALEENE MacMINN and STEVE WEINSTEIN

NBC's "Saturday Night Live" got a dig in at a Christian group and two major 
advertisers who had objected to language used on previous shows Saturday when 
guest host Mary Tyler Moore said the word penis twice in her opening monologue. 
Last week, Ralston Purina and General Mills had announced that they would no 
longer advertise on the program after they received letters from the American 
Family Assn., a Christian organization based in Mississippi that monitors 
television programs for what it perceives to be morally offensive content, 
protesting a sketch in which the word penis was used 28 times. Moore first used 
the word discussing her longtime association with wholesome family 
entertainment and assuring the audience that "that word" would not be uttered 
on Saturday's show. She then concluded her monologue, saying, musical guest 
"Elvis Costello's penis is here tonight, so stay tuned." ALEENE MacMINN and

When Barbara Bush walked into a reception here last Tuesday night for public 
television's new series "Learning in America," the first question she was asked 
concerned the vacancy for the top post at the National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
Livingston Biddle, a past chairman of the endowment, wondered how the selection 
process was coming along. "We're all waiting with bated breath," Mrs. Bush 
replied easily. But when Biddle said he had heard she was involved in the 
selection process, the First Lady demurred: "Oh, no!" 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Milton Rhodes, 44, president of the American Council for the 
Arts, a New York-based arts advocacy group and an announced candidate for the 
endowment position, showed up at a House subcommittee hearing on the arts 
budget. When he left, Rep. Sidney R. Yates (D-Ill.), the subcommittee chairman, 
casually wished him good luck. 
</P>
<P>
At about the same time, Rep. Ralph Regula (R-Ohio), who sits on Yates' 
subcommittee, left the hearing room to keep a luncheon appointment with another 
candidate for the endowment job, Schuyler Chapin, 66, a former dean of the 
School of Arts at Columbia and former general manager of the Metropolitan 
Opera. 
</P>
<P>
The hot name now, however, is Marta Casals Istomin, 52, artistic director at 
Kennedy Center. She is said by arts observers to offer three important 
attributes from Bush's perspective: She is a woman, she is a minority (a native 
of Puerto Rico) and, as a violinist and cellist, she is an artist. 
</P>
<P>
Lobbying, maneuvering and speculation regarding President Bush's nomination for 
the fifth chairman in the endowment's 24-year history are blossoming faster 
than the proverbial springtime cherry blossoms. 
</P>
<P>
Among the rumors: that Beverly Sills had been asked by the Bush Administration 
to take the endowment job but turned it down. A spokesman for her New York 
agent, Edgar Vincent, categorically denied the rumor. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is considered a small agency, with a $169.1 million budget, the 
National Endowment for the Arts is the arts community's link to the federal 
government, helping to fund arts organizations and artists. Although almost all 
endowment money requires matching dollars from the private sector, grantees 
feel that with the endowment's "seal of approval," they have entered a 
privileged circle. The chairmanship carries particular cachet among artists and 
literati. 
</P>
<P>
White House sources say Mrs. Bush is keenly interested in the choice as a way 
for the Bush Administration to make a statement about the importance of the 
arts. "The President and Mrs. Bush consider it a very important decision," a 
key personnel official said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the American Arts Alliance, the official arts advocacy and lobbying 
organization here, is attempting to play a major role in the selection process. 
The organization has written twice to Bush in the past two months asking for a 
nominee with two key qualifications: a "passionate commitment to the arts" and 
the "ability to communicate with and influence top decision-makers in the 
private and public sectors." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, executive director Anne Murphy said in an interview, the 
alliance wants someone who has high-level access at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
In the second letter, March 3, the alliance provided a list of people it 
considered to be qualified candidates. Although Istomin's name was not 
included, Murphy said that the alliance would "not be unhappy" with her choice. 
</P>
<P>
Istomin, who was on vacation for a few days with her husband, could not be 
reached for comment, but a spokeswoman at the Kennedy Center told The Times 
that Istomin has an appointment to meet with a member of the "search committee" 
at endowment headquarters to discuss the job. 
</P>
<P>
Istomin has been artistic director at the Kennedy Center since February, 1980 
and is responsible for policies and programs there in music, opera and dance. 
Her first husband, to whom she was married for 17 years, was the world-renowned 
cellist Pablo Casals. She helped the maestro create the Festival Casals in 
Puerto Rico, the Puerto Rico Symphony Orchestra and the Conservatory of Music. 
For the past 14 years, she has been married to concert pianist Eugene Istomin. 
</P>
<P>
Chapin was on the American Arts Alliance's list of qualified candidates. His 
supporters also include William F. Buckley and David Rockefeller, who have 
written letters on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
"I have spent 40 years of my life in the arts," Chapin said in an interview. "I 
think I have a sense of the needs of the artistic communities." 
</P>
<P>
Rhodes has had letters written on his behalf by friends of the Bush family, 
including Laura Lee Blanton, wife of Jack Blanton, a Texas tennis partner of 
the President, and Philip Hanes, a founder of the American Council for the 
Arts. 
</P>
<P>
The arts alliance considers Rhodes to have the right amount of passion but not 
enough access. And he may have diminished his chances by critical statements he 
made about Reagan-Bush arts policies during the presidential campaign last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Until Istomin's name cropped up, Barnabas McHenry, 59 -- co-vice chair of the 
President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities, with trusteeships on the 
Metropolitan Opera, the New York City Ballet and the Egg Theater in Albany, 
N.Y. -- was deemed the endowment front-runner. McHenry's solid-gold connections 
include friendships with Secretary of State James Baker and Secretary of the 
Treasury Nicholas F. Brady. McHenry roomed with Baker for four years at 
Princeton. 
</P>
<P>
Several arts leaders, however, told The Times that they let the White House 
know they would not view a McHenry nomination favorably, mainly because they 
consider his background to be in fund raising rather than the arts itself. 
</P>
<P>
Another highly visible candidate for the chairmanship is Lois Burke Shepard, 
51, the outgoing director of the Institute for Museum Services. As a former 
head of Republicans Abroad, Shepard says she is the only candidate with three 
years administrative experience in the federal bureaucracy.

MCENTIRE: STYLE, LITTLE EMOTION

<P>
It's not often that the names Reba McEntire and Chrissie Hynde are used in the 
same sentence, but the truth is both have played similar roles as strong, 
independent women in their respective country and rock fields. Much in the same 
way Hynde opened the door for other self-reliant women in rock, McEntire's huge 
success throughout this decade has helped pave the way for the likes of the 
Judds and K. T. Oslin. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, though, Oslin has challenged McEntire's reign as mainstream country's 
first lady. Saturday at the Universal Amphitheatre, McEntire rose to the 
challenge with a show that accented her talents as a consummate entertainer and 
remarkable vocal talent. But the presentation left something of a vacuum in 
terms of truly personal emotion and style -- precisely the things for which 
Oslin (who unlike McEntire writes her own songs) has earned acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
Oslin's whole persona comes off like a series of unguarded moments. McEntire's 
show Saturday didn't allow for any. 
</P>
<P>
Every move, every nod to the adoring crowd, every interaction with her 
accomplished seven-piece band seemed as planned out as the splashy lighting 
that framed the stage. The parade of hits and previews from her upcoming album, 
"Sweet Sixteen" (her 16th LP), was -- for all the attraction of such fine radio 
regulars as "Whoever's in New England" and "The Last One to Know" -- as 
show-biz sparkly a display of fashion as the three outfits she wore during the 
80-minute show. 
</P>
<P>
Not until McEntire closed the regular set with her now-standard, stately a 
cappella belting of Patsy Cline's "Sweet Dreams" did any cracks in the facade 
appear. Several times, as fans shouted often funny testimonies of affection to 
the singer during the pauses between phrases in the song, McEntire appeared 
close to breaking loose and laughing with the crowd. Though she recovered and 
finished the song virtually unphased, that hint of vulnerability added a 
much-needed element to the show. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it's the very sense of being in control that characterizes 
McEntire's career; the sense that she is master of her own fate -- as well as 
her craft -- is essential to her success. And her maturation as a performer, 
expanding her repertoire to include such non-country fare as the jazz-pop 
standard "Sunday Kind of Love," is something to be lauded. 
</P>
<P>
But if she keeps adding layers of glitz and glamour to her act, it's going to 
get harder and harder to tell where the show ends and the real Reba begins -- 
and that's not a problem with Oslin and certainly not with Hynde. 
</P>
<P>
With his fringed white jacket and wide-brimmed white hat, opening act Ricky Van 
Shelton looked like he just stepped out of a Tom Mix movie, and the best of his 
set would have gone down fine at a Saturday matinee. But as a whole, his 
material seemed selected because it sounds good, not because it says anything.

'LEARNING IN AMERICA'S' FACTS SICKEN EVEN NEWS VETERANS 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1951 and 1952, before he became a newsman, Roger Mudd taught at a private 
boys' school in Rome, Ga. On Monday, he'll take public-TV viewers back to class 
as host of a five-part series examining the state of "Learning in America." 
</P>
<P>
Its first chapter examines, with often gloomy conclusions, how American 
education compares with that in Japan and other countries. Succeeding chapters 
study such issues as the politics of school reform, social and economic 
inequality in education, and the growing shortage of teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Mudd, who after leaving teaching spent 19 years at CBS and another seven at NBC 
before joining public TV's "MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" in 1987, is quick to say 
that his time as an educator was short and was "limited to one thin strata of 
society" -- the sons of relatively affluent families. 
</P>
<P>
But in working on "Learning in America," he said in an interview, "what was 
interesting for me was to see how much the educators in America have had to 
change, or should be changing, to meet a really changing society." 
</P>
<P>
A $2-million, Chrysler-funded co-production of MacNeil/Lehrer Productions and 
public-TV station WETA in Washington, the series was no quick-hit, 
go-for-the-emotions project. 
</P>
<P>
Mudd and his fellow "MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" colleagues John Merrow, Paul 
Solman and Charlayne Hunter-Gault, and a team of 12 off-camera staffers, worked 
on the series over an eight-month period. Interviews were conducted in 21 
states, plus Europe and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"Learning in America" will air on successive Mondays at 9 p.m. on Channels 28 
and 15, and at 10 on Channel 24. MacNeil/Lehrer Productions has proposed to PBS 
turning it into a weekly series later this year. 
</P>
<P>
Executive producer Joe Quinlan, the son of a public school teacher in 
Philadelphia, said the idea was not to rehash such well-publicized issues as 
teen-age drug use or weapons on campus. Rather, he said, "we took what we 
thought were the important questions and stuck with them. . . . We focused in 
on things that had some breadth, some common denominator." 
</P>
<P>
The first 22 minutes of the third show, for example, will be devoted to an 
often-overlooked aspect of education, namely, "why textbooks are so bad," said 
Quinlan, explaining that that segment shows the process of selecting textbooks 
by committee. 
</P>
<P>
There was one particular eye-opener for Mudd that he said "sickened me a 
little." 
</P>
<P>
He related that New York Life Insurance, an insurance company, can't find -- 
"at the wage they offer" -- enough computer-literate high-school graduates to 
process medical claims at its office in Freehold, N.J. So the claims are put in 
a box each day and flown to Dublin, where high school kids working for New York 
Life's Irish subsidiary do the processing. 
</P>
<P>
"That makes you kind of ill, to realize that the New Jersey public school 
system -- and don't single out New Jersey, because it could happen in any other 
state -- is not turning out young men and women who are competent to do basic 
clerical work," Mudd said.

SOTHEBY'S WILL AUCTION PART OF H. BRADLEY MARTIN LIBRARY TROVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, Times Art Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 70 highlights -- including one of 23 known copies of the Declaration of 
Independence worth $400,000 to $600,000 -- from an upcoming auction of H. 
Bradley Martin's vast library go on view at Sotheby's Beverly Hills office 
today and Tuesday. Among the $6-million worth of items on view will be George 
Washington's copy of "The Federalist Papers" (estimated to bring $250,000 to 
$400,000) and Ptolemy's "Cosmographia," a group of hand-colored maps from the 
15th Century ($300,000 to $400,000). 
</P>
<P>
Exhibited pieces from Martin's ornithological collection include a folio of 
John James Audubon's "Birds of America" (expected to sell for $2 million to $3 
million), Audubon's 1826 journal and illustrated works by Eleazer Albin, Mark 
Cateby and Edward Lear. 
</P>
<P>
Martin's collection, billed by Sotheby's as "one of the finest private 
libraries in America," will be sold in New York and Monte Carlo in a series of 
auctions beginning in June and continuing next year. Martin's entire library of 
10,000 books and manuscripts is valued by the auction house at more than $30 
million. The collection is so large that it will require a nine-volume 
catalogue priced at more than $350, according to Matthew Weigman of Sotheby's. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, who died this year, was a grandson of Henry Phipps, a partner of Andrew 
Carnegie. During 63 years of avid collecting, Martin built a collection of 
7,000 illustrated ornithological books that Sotheby's calls "the best in 
private hands." He also acquired rare documents of American history and 
extraordinary collections of American, French, English and children's 
literature. Martin's holdings include more than 100 letters from Marcel Proust 
(most of them to Baron de Montesquiou) and a letter from Herman Melville 
denying symbolism in "Moby Dick." 
</P>
<P>
Among dozens of first editions and presentation copies of books exhibited are 
Beatrix Potter's "The Tale of Peter Rabbit," Honore de Balzac's "Le Pere 
Goriot," Charles Baudelaire's "Les Fleurs du Mal" and Edgar Allen Poe's 
"Eureka" and "Tamerlane, and Other Poems." 
</P>
<P>
The Beverly Hills exhibition, on view at 308 N. Rodeo Drive from 10 a.m. to 6 
p.m., is the last stop of a three-city tour that has already visited Chicago 
and Tokyo. Information: (213) 274-0340.

The Los Angeles Board of Education today will consider a 10-year, $431-million 
plan aimed at reversing academic failure, particularly among poor, minority 
students. The plan incorporates many ideas that school districts are 
increasingly adopting to fight chronically poor test scores and high dropout 
rates. Programs emphasize smaller classes and strong early education, as well 
as ways to restructure school management, shifting authority to individual 
schools and to teachers. With the board deliberating over $90 million in budget 
cuts that district officials say are needed to pay higher teacher salaries, the 
steep price of the plan is likely to prompt concern.

<TEXT>
<P>
Shortly before Christmas, Assemblymen Ross Johnson and John Lewis joined a 
colleague and about half a dozen Louisiana-Pacific lumber company employees on 
a 4-day fishing trip in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
The group mixed business and pleasure, viewing the timberlands and discussing 
issues as they fished for steelhead trout on the Klamath and Trinity rivers 
near Eureka, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
The fishing trip, which cost the company about $800 per person, was typical of 
scores of gratuities offered up by institutions and special interests and 
accepted by members of Orange County's delegation in the Legislature during 
1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The gifts ranged in value from a $3.65 batch of cinnamon rolls to overseas 
tours worth thousands of dollars. If they wished, lawmakers could obtain free, 
preferred parking at area airports, visit Disneyland, Sea World and the San 
Diego Zoo, attend college and professional football games, belong to yacht 
clubs, country clubs and athletic clubs, and even get their eyeglasses -- all 
without paying a cent. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County lawmakers also collect thousands of dollars in honorariums -- 
fees for making speeches -- most of which are paid by companies and trade 
associations seeking to influence the Legislature. Unlike campaign funds, which 
cannot be spent for personal purposes, speaking fees go directly into a 
lawmaker's pocket. 
</P>
<P>
For the Legislature, 1988 was the final year that members could accept 
unlimited gifts and fees for making speeches. Proposition 73, approved by the 
voters in June, now limits gifts and speech fees to $1,000 from each source 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
But it is by no means clear that the new law will stem the flow of personal 
gifts to lawmakers. Most of the gifts that members receive are valued below the 
$1,000 threshold. More valuable gratuities are usually associated with travel, 
and those are still permitted without limit if a legislator maintains that the 
travel was a necessary part of a speaking engagement. Legislation now under 
consideration would place even stricter limits on personal gifts from people 
who are trying to influence the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
During 1987 and 1988, the 13 members of the Orange County legislative 
delegation collected gifts worth $116,339, according to their annual statements 
of economic interest filed with the Fair Political Practices Commission. 
Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress) collected the most -- $23,443. 
Assemblyman Nolan Frizzelle (R-Huntington Beach) reported the least -- $358.83. 
</P>
<P>
The most valuable gifts are the trips, which are offered at one time or another 
to virtually every member of the Legislature. Most of the excursions are 
sponsored and paid for by private companies interested in issues weighed by the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Last Spring, Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) and his wife spent 5 
days in Bermuda, courtesy of Pfizer Pharmaceutical Co. The firm invited 
Campbell as part of an annual program known as "The Portfolio of State Issues," 
at which lawmakers from around the country gather with experts to discuss 
concerns at the state level. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the Bermuda trip, Pfizer was the sponsor of a bill pending in 
the Senate that would have protected Irvine-based Shiley Inc., a Pfizer 
subsidiary, from lawsuits filed over Shiley's faulty heart valve. The bill was 
later dropped without a vote. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell aide Jerry Haleva described the Bermuda session as a "valuable forum." 
He said he didn't remember if the Pfizer legislation was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an annual thing they do," Haleva said. "Any link between that and any 
legislation Pfizer had pending at the time is irrelevant." 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana-Pacific, a large lumber concern, had no specific legislation pending 
in the Legislature when the company invited Assemblymen Johnson (R-La Habra), 
Lewis (R-Orange) and Frank Hill (R-Whittier) to go fishing in Humboldt County 
in December. But Shepard Tucker, the company's director of legislative affairs, 
said the firm wanted to show the lawmakers firsthand what the timber industry 
is all about. 
</P>
<P>
The company flew the group to Eureka, put them up at a company-owned bed and 
breakfast inn, and arranged for guides and boats to take them fishing on two 
area rivers. One night, the group had dinner at the home of Louisiana-Pacific's 
division manager. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult to explain commercial forestry," Tucker said. "Many urban 
legislators do not understand the scale of things we're doing up here. . . . 
When we take them out fishing, we are able to talk to them about our company 
and the industry." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Johnson described the outing as little different from any other fishing 
trip, except that it was paid for by a lumber company. 
</P>
<P>
"As we were drifting down the river in the drift boat, they talked about a 
variety of things relating to the timber industry," he said. "But 99.9% of the 
conversations was about the river and about fishing. It was very relaxing." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) is a frequent traveler who last year 
toured Egypt courtesy of the Egyptian government and went to New Zealand on a 
trip paid for by several oil and chemical companies. But she described her 
sojourns as anything but relaxing. 
</P>
<P>
"These were good trips," Bergeson said. "We really spent a lot of time finding 
out about issues that are relevant to things we are looking at in California." 
</P>
<P>
Even when a trip is sponsored by a foreign government, private interest groups 
from California can find their way onto the itinerary. On Bergeson's visit to 
Egypt, she and the two senators with whom she traveled gave a dinner for the 
Egyptian officials who were hosting them. The Senate office of protocol 
arranged the dinner and solicited the California Retailers' Assn. and the 
California Optometric Assn. to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
"They helped to offset some of the costs," Bergeson said of the trade 
associations. "I don't remember seeing any of them over there." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Allen, who has long had an interest in fishing and hunting 
issues, was given round-trip plane tickets to Cabo San Lucas in Baja California 
by South Coast Sportfishing Magazine, a monthly publication based in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Kukada, the magazine's publisher, said he gave Allen the tickets, worth 
$652, "to say thank you" for her work on behalf of sportfishing. The magazine 
supports a bill Allen has introduced that would eliminate the use of gill nets 
by commercial fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
"I know she's worked hard and puts in a lot of time, and she has been very 
sensitive to some of the resource issues," Kukada said. "This was our way of 
indicating to her that we appreciate her effort on some of those issues." 
</P>
<P>
Other gifts that lawmakers receive are more on the order of perks that come 
with holding elective office. 
</P>

Sen. Cecil N. Green (D-Norwalk) reported receiving $600 worth of expanded cable 
television service during the 2-year period from Choice Television. Green said 
he began receiving the service when he was a Norwalk City Councilman, 
regulating the cable television franchise, so that he could see what his 
constituents were getting for their money. 
</P>
<P>
Green said the service included the Playboy Channel, which he watched once or 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not my station of choice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Several Orange County lawmakers have attended the Academy Awards in recent 
years, courtesy of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. The 
organization provides transportation between Sacramento and Los Angeles, 
lodging at a Los Angeles hotel and limousine service to the awards, in addition 
to tickets. The entire package comes to more than $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Lewis, who attended with his fiancee last year, said the couple 
almost missed the glitzy event. 
</P>
<P>
"The traffic jam going to the awards was ridiculous," he said. "We almost got 
locked out." 
</P>
<P>
Many legislators also take advantage of free and preferred parking at area 
airports. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Green parks at Los Angeles International, where legislators use a special 
lot and are shuttled by van to their terminal. Assemblyman Johnson generally 
flies into Ontario Airport, and parks free in an employee lot. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a business-oriented conservative, asked why he should get preferred 
parking when his constituents have to fight for a space, said he didn't have an 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been offered, it's an enormous convenience, and I've accepted it," he 
said. "I don't feel badly about it." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis reported $60 worth of free parking at Orange County's John Wayne Airport 
in 1987 and again in 1988. Lewis said he parks in a special lot at the 
airport's north end. 
</P>
<P>
But Jan Mittermeier, the assistant airport manager, said in an interview that 
neither she nor the airport manager, George Rebella, knew of Lewis' privileged 
parking spot. She said the free parking violates airport policy. 
</P>
<P>
"If we did this for one member of the Assembly, they'd all want it," she said. 
"We just don't have the room. The public doesn't even have enough room to 
park." 
</P>
<P>
Mittermeier promised to look into the matter. "He probably won't find his pass 
any good next time he tries to use it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Many legislators also receive free admission to Southern California tourist 
attractions, including Disneyland, Sea World and the San Diego Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
Last July, Sen. Bergeson wanted to take her family on an outing for the 
Independence Day holiday. So she arranged for five free tickets to the zoo on 
July 2, and the same number at Disneyland the next day. She said she took 
advantage of the free admission because it was offered. 
</P>
<P>
"Nearly all the functions I attend with my family, a night at the Music Center, 
for instance, we pay for ourselves," she said. "But, if there are invitations, 
and they'd like to extend it to you, it's something that I think its acceptable 
under the circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Zoo spokesman Jeff Jouett said the park extends free admission to 
lawmakers as a way to help compete for their attention. The park is currently 
embroiled in a controversy over its treatment of elephants and receives state 
funds for its condor breeding program. 
</P>
<P>
"We think they (legislators) might want to see what kind of facility their 
money is going for," Jouett said. "This helps to make them aware of the 
endangered species issue. They have a lot of issues before them. We think 
endangered species deserve their attention as well." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Allen, the county's top gift-getter, received some of the more 
unusual gratuities. Last year, she reported $15,500 in legal and accounting 
services from Lisa and Bruce Hughes of Santa Ana. She said the couple "wrote 
off" a large portion of what she owed them for work done on her divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Allen also accepted a free pair of eyeglasses valued at $110 from the 
California Optometric Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"They offer that all the time, through your optometrist," Allen said. "This is 
the first year I've done it. I went ahead and allowed it because it was only 
$110." 
</P>
<P>
Other gifts received by lawmakers included tickets to Rams, UCLA and USC 
football games and the Super Bowl, passes to movie theaters, free car washes 
and complimentary memberships in the Balboa Bay Club and Balboa Yacht Club. 
</P>
<P>
Even many of these gifts could be banned under a bill authored by Assemblyman 
Ted Lempert (D-San Mateo), who won an upset victory in November after basing 
his campaign on a theme of cleaning up corruption in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Since taking office, Lempert has introduced a package of legislation that 
would, among other things, ban gifts and honorariums valued at more than $50. 
Assemblyman Johnson has a measure that would set the limit at $250 from any 
source that uses a lobbyist in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"The public is frustrated with a lot of what goes on in Sacramento and the way 
the system is abused," Lempert said in an interview. "It's the abuses that need 
to be eliminated. But the only way we can deal with that now is a complete ban 
on gifts and honorariums." 
</P>
<P>
Yet lawmakers, almost without exception, say that even those gifts from private 
interests affected by bills in the Legislature do not influence their 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said his fishing trip did not change his view on the timber industry at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
"They know where I'm coming from," he said. "I've always been a supporter of 
the timber industry, and I'm against excessive radical environmentalism. I'm 
sure they appreciate that. Everything is fully disclosed. I don't think there's 
a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Robert Frazee (R-Carlsbad), who represents a portion of south 
Orange County, spent two free nights in a Palm Desert condominium owned by the 
Sunrise Co., a developer that was sponsoring legislation last year. 
</P>
<P>
Frazee, who was in the area for a meeting of the Assembly Republican Caucus 
agricultural task force, said he supported the Sunrise bill "all along." The 
measure, which was passed by the Legislature but vetoed by Gov. George 
Deukmejian, would have allowed the city of Indian Wells to build most of its 
state-required low-income housing outside its borders. 
</P>
<P>
Frazee said he subscribes to a philosophy first detailed by the late Jesse 
Unruh, one-time Assembly Speaker and later state treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
"You should be able to take these kinds of things and not let it affect you," 
Frazee said. "That's the measure of a good legislator." 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson said she has never completely understood the fascination with which 
the press and public treat the annual reports on which lawmakers disclose the 
gifts they receive. Most of what she gets, Bergeson said, is trivial. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess there's just an insatiable interest in our private lives," she said. 
"It's so boring." 
</P>
<P>

DIP SEPARATES THE LIFEGUARDS FROM THE DILETTANTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARCIDA DODSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forget the flowery bonnets and pastel frocks. The Easter finery worn to Sunday 
morning's function along the chilly coast consisted of rubberized swim caps and 
spandex swimsuits, topped off by lots of sweat suits and towels. 
</P>
<P>
Braving brisk air and even brisker water, 177 people spent Easter morning on 
the shore of Huntington Beach State Park competing for one of the most revered 
positions in California: lifeguard. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I thought this was sacrilegious, having it on Easter," said Steve 
Lesko, 31, who was one of 57 returning lifeguards who had to swim 1,000 yards 
in the frigid, rough water in less than 20 minutes to qualify for rehiring. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Easter Was Fitting 
</P>
<P>
But, he said facetiously, he came to believe the timing was all too fitting. 
</P>
<P>
"You 'hit the wall' out there," feel like you can go no farther, "and then you 
come back to life. So it's very appropriate," said Lesko, who worked last year 
at Huntington Beach State Park and for 13 years before that at Jones Beach in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
"Plus," he added, "you pray a lot." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the returning lifeguards, 120 new applicants took the plunge 
Sunday, the first step toward a seat in a tower overlooking a California state 
beach. The uninitiated not only had to swim 1,000 yards in rough water in less 
than 20 minutes, like the returning lifeguards, but had a second regimen: Run 
200 yards in soft sand, swim 400 yards in the ocean, then run another 200 yards 
-- all in less than 11 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lifeguards Rescued 5 
</P>
<P>
Of the 120, 31 never made it to the second tests -- and five of those had to be 
rescued by lifeguards supervising the competition. 
</P>
<P>
Rod Caunan, 24, of Los Angeles did not make it to the end of the first test, 
although he swam back to shore without a lifeguard's help. A former Los Angeles 
city lifeguard who now works on dry land as a claims adjuster for Xerox, Caunan 
said he had entered the competition not for a job but "just for the challenge." 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, he was body-slammed a few times in the water by ambitious 
competitors, knocking his breath out of him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's usually fun, but there are guys out there to kill," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The run-swim-run test eliminated 11 more hopefuls, leaving 78. But these are 
not lifeguards yet. First, the applicants must undergo interviews for positions 
at seven state beach districts. Those who pass the interview must then 
participate in a 6-day training course to learn rescue and lifesaving 
techniques, first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 
</P>
<P>
Only the top graduates are hired, as positions are available. (About 30 
openings are expected in the Huntington Beach area, lifeguard officials said.) 
</P>
<P>
Gus Avila, a state lifeguard in charge of Sunday's competition, said Saturday's 
storm "may have scared some people away," although the water temperature -- 
which he estimated at 60 degrees -- was about normal for the annual spring 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the returning lifeguards, out for their annual requalification test, 
admitted to more reservations about plunging into the water than did the 
tryouts. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to do this!" Riley Roice said with a laugh as he prepared for the 
ocean swim. Roice, 32, of Long Beach said he has been a lifeguard "since the 
towers were made of wood and the lifeguards were made of steel." 
</P>
<P>
As a chilly breeze blew the storm clouds away Sunday morning, the competitors 
stripped down to Speedo swimsuits and goggles. A few of the returning 
lifeguards donned wet suits -- allowed for the competition, although they tend 
to slow the swimmer down, one lifeguard said -- to help keep warm. 
</P>
<P>
"We're old," one lifeguard said, "and it's cold out there." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Whooping, Shouting Start 
</P>
<P>
With a blast of an air horn, the returning lifeguards bolted into the surf, 
whooping and shouting. 
</P>
<P>
Bram Tester, 20, of Fullerton, who served his first year as a lifeguard last 
year in Huntington Beach, was the first to run back onto the beach after his 
swim. Through labored breath and chattering teeth, he proclaimed: "It felt 
good." 
</P>
<P>
A veteran lifeguard, Eric Emery, 51, who has been a lifeguard since 1954 (the 
last 30 years with the state), passed his requalifying swim test last month but 
went the 1,000 yards again Sunday to keep some of his colleagues company, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Emery, who teaches English at Edison High School when he isn't on the sand, 
said the water temperature "really isn't bad, but there's a tremendous 
current." He finished, he said, in "19-something" -- ahead of a fellow 
lifeguard and former student, Ziggy Muhlhauser. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Water Polo Teacher Won 
</P>
<P>
"My old teacher beat me!" Muhlhauser, 33, said of Emery, his former water polo 
coach. Saturday's storm had made Muhlhauser apprehensive about the swim; he and 
his wife even came out to the beach Saturday night to see whether the water was 
choppy and difficult to swim. 
</P>
<P>
When the storm passed by morning, "we lucked out. I got by by the skin of my 
teeth," he said of his time of 19 1/2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The new applicants entered the water a bit more quietly than their experienced 
counterparts and returned with mixed reviews. Steve West, 16, a sophomore from 
Huntington Beach High School, finished first, 13 1/2 minutes after the race's 
start. "It got warm, once you got past the waves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hell," another competitor said. 
</P>
<P>
"I never want to swim again," said Corry Felix, 16, from El Dorado High School, 
who finished third among female applicants in the 1,000-yard swim. "I'm cold 
and tired. . . . On the way back, a wave hit me hard, and I thought, I'm not 
going to make it in." 
</P>
<P>
Competition director Avila that he had no say in the scheduling of the 
competition on Easter Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Timing Bothered Few 
</P>
<P>
The decision, he said, was made at state lifeguard district headquarters. But 
the timing appeared to bother only a few participants. Veteran lifeguard Emery, 
who said the swim made him rearrange his plans, toweled off and promply left 
with his wife to get dressed for church. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Bhesania, 15, of Fountain Valley, a sophomore at La Quinta High School, 
said she was eager to finish because a family Easter celebration was in store. 
"I have an egg hunt waiting for me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Tiffany Seale, 19, of Costa Mesa had less festive but equally enjoyable plans 
for the rest of her Easter Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to recuperate, eat, sleep and take a hot bath," she said.

PEOPLE: HER CAREER LEAPS FROM 5-2 SNOOPY TO TV'S BIG CATS 
</P>

Nicolienne Francois liked animals so much that she became one. Sort of. "Jobs 
were scarce after I graduated from an animal training program in the San 
Fernando Valley, so when Knott's Berry Farm offered me a chance to play 'Snoopy 
the Dog,' I jumped at the chance," said Francois, 23. "It was what you would 
call a starter job." 
</P>
<P>
That was in 1986. It led to other jobs involving animals, including one at the 
Santa Ana Zoo. In the last year, she has been in Africa, Taiwan, Lake Tahoe and 
Atlantic City, tending her four big cats -- two black panthers and two Bengal 
tigers. 
</P>
<P>
"If I hadn't taken the Snoopy job," Francois said, "I might never have had the 
chance to become an animal trainer, and I don't know what I would have been 
doing today." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Francois returned to Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park, but this time 
as an animal trainer to perform in "Spellbound," a magic show that features 
illusionist Mark Kalin and his high-tech act featuring her leopards and tigers. 
Kalin made the cats appear and disappear in the hourlong show. 
</P>
<P>
TV appearances make her more nervous than caring for the cats, although the 
tigers each weigh upward of 350 pounds. "You always have to be a little afraid, 
because they are so big," Francois said, but she has never suffered an injury 
from the animals. 
</P>
<P>
Training tigers has been her dream since age 10. "I remember seeing a woman 
handling a tiger on television, and I said that was for me," said Francois, who 
was raised in Manhattan Beach and stayed with her mother there during her 
weeklong stop at Knott's. She and the show are leaving for another yearlong 
tour that will include Australia and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot of fun traveling around the world, although it can be hard at 
times," she said. "What I'm really aiming for is a career in movies and 
commercials that include animals." 
</P>
<P>
Francois said she knows that it will not be easy breaking into movies and 
making ads with animals: "There are a lot of people out there with animals 
trying to do the same thing, and I know I can't restrict myself to just cats. 
When someone calls, you have to have what they want or they go to someone 
else." 
</P>
<P>
Francois said she told a fib when she applied for the first job as Snoopy: 
"They said I had to be 5 feet, 3 inches tall to fit into the costumes. I told 
them I was, but I'm not. I'm 5-feet-2 . . . almost." 
</P>
<P>
In 1945, George C. Titman was a Marine corporal stationed in El Toro and living 
in Santa Ana. But he decided he wanted to become a citizen of the world. 
</P>
<P>
After his discharge, he moved to Auckland, New Zealand, where he renounced his 
U.S. citizenship. Then he tore up his U.S. passport, not vindictively, he said, 
but to cancel it. 
</P>
<P>
Then he tried to develop a declaration of interdependence for a world federal 
government with enough power to ensure world peace. "It was along the lines of 
the United Nations concept and would prevent wars," said Titman, who still 
lives in Auckland. 
</P>
<P>
The 64-year-old former Marine, who has been married three times and has five 
grandchildren, returned to Orange County last week to visit his daughter, 
Denice McDermott, from his first marriage in Santa Ana. He had not seen her for 
41 years. He competed in the recent Los Angeles Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
"For years I walked and talked to everyone to get my point across, but I really 
don't feel my thinking was widely accepted," he said. "We really haven't 
reached a point in the world where disputes between nations are (settled) 
through talking."

FALL FROM PALM SPRINGS BALCONY HOSPITALIZES STUDENT 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 19-year-old Simi Valley college student was in serious condition at a Palm 
Springs hospital Sunday, recovering from head injuries suffered when she fell 
from a hotel balcony during spring break revelry. 
</P>
<P>
A nursing supervisor at Desert Hospital said Shelli Hoyt, a student at Moorpark 
College, remained in the hospital's intensive care unit after undergoing 
surgery. Her condition was reported as critical Saturday but had improved by 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Palm Springs police said Hoyt fell from the second-floor balcony of her room at 
the Dunes Hotel about 1:30 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Ghrabety, a desk clerk at the hotel, said a security guard told Hoyt, who 
had been drinking, not to sit on the balcony railing. But, he said, she did not 
move. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a straightforward accident, as far as we could tell," a police 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Two hours before the fall, police wearing riot gear had gone to the hotel to 
break up a fistfight among about 15 young men, authorities said. The fight 
spread throughout the hotel and police threatened to close it before the 
disruption subsided. 
</P>
<P>
Ghrabety said only about 15 guests remained Sunday afternoon at the 128-room 
hotel. He said the hotel planned to hire several additional security guards for 
next weekend, when college students celebrating spring break a week later are 
expected to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fall and the death of a 22-year-old Santa Ana woman in a traffic 
accident 2 days earlier, police consider the weeklong celebration by college 
students to have been relatively quiet.

The Devonshire Christian Church in Mission Hills held its traditional Easter 
services Sunday morning, despite an early morning fire that caused $30,000 in 
damage to the church structure and $5,000 in damage to its contents, a Los 
Angeles Fire Department spokesman said. The damage was limited mostly to the 
church's offices but the sanctuary was damaged by water and smelled like smoke. 
Fire Capt. Vince Cardinale of the department's Mission Hills station took his 
entire 10-member crew to the church to help it prepare for services. "Most of 
the church area itself was in pretty good shape," he said. A Fire Department 
spokesman said the fire was caused by electrical problems in the structure's 
attic.

<TEXT>

Long Beach Police Officer Mark Dickey was so distressed to hear that the city 
had dropped the resisting-arrest case against anti-brutality crusader Don 
Jackson that he coughed up blood and has taken a paid leave, officials said 
Thursday. "He's been under quite a bit of stress," said Long Beach Police Sgt. 
Gary Halliday, who said Dickey was placed on paid "injured-on-duty" status 
Wednesday after the coughing episode and was taken to a doctor. Dickey stopped 
Jackson for an alleged traffic violation, then apparently pushed him into a 
plate-glass window Jan. 14 while a TV crew secretly filmed the incident. Dickey 
arrested Jackson for allegedly interfering with a police officer, but the Long 
Beach prosecutor Wednesday dropped the charge, saying the case was too weak to 
prove. The Long Beach Police Department, the FBI and the Los Angeles County 
district attorney's office are all investigating the arrest to determine 
whether disciplinary action or criminal charges should be filed against Dickey.

<TEXT>

Barry Minkow was a "compulsive debtor" who had an uncontrollable need for 
millions of dollars the way a drug addict needs a fix, his defense lawyer said 
Friday. In a report filed for his sentencing Monday on 57 fraud counts stemming 
from the 1987 collapse of his ZZZZ Best carpet-cleaning company, lawyers for 
Minkow recanted the young entrepreneur's defense that the mob forced him into 
committing the fraud and said Minkow was the victim of an unhappy childhood. 
"The true story of ZZZZ Best is of a young man almost constantly in debt, 
struggling to prove that he will not become the failure depicted by his 
father," attorney David E. Kenner said in his report. "In Barry Minkow's case, 
the hoped for 'Big Fix' was the infusion of new funds -- funds that he could 
only obtain through activities that caused his prosecution."

FOR DURAN DURAN, GOOD OL' DAYS ARE PRECIOUS INDEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Besides inaugurating the outdoor concert season Friday on a temperate evening 
at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre, Duran Duran got a jump on '80s nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
"Does anybody remember the '80s?" John Taylor, the band's bassist, wondered 
during a pause. "They were some good years, weren't they?" 
</P>
<P>
Well, they were good for Duran Duran, anyway. The British band rose to immense 
teen-pop popularity in the first half of the decade. It then went on hiatus and 
lost a couple of members, but it's still around on the eve of the '90s to wax 
nostalgic about it all. 
</P>
<P>
But for anyone who values such qualities as conviction, depth and emotional 
honesty in music, Duran Duran, to put it mildly, does not represent the best of 
the decade. And with the '90s looming, Duran Duran's concert didn't give much 
indication that the group is about to find honesty and conviction -- which have 
made a welcome late '80s comeback on the pop charts. (Who could have imagined 5 
years ago that R.E.M. would one day be a hotter draw than the Duran boys?) 
</P>
<P>
In a decade when a good deal of our culture -- from the White House on down -- 
concentrated more on appearances than on realities, Duran Duran is a band that 
made a terrific appearance. Its members were handsome. They were dedicated 
followers of fashion. And they sold that image effectively on MTV in abstract, 
slickly alluring videos that have become models for so much marketing. 
</P>
<P>
On stage at Irvine Meadows, Duran Duran was still selling the same stuff. In 
fact, the show looked like a live re-enactment of a couple of hours of music 
video. 
</P>
<P>
Two scantily clad female backup singers did mechanical dance steps, like 
computer-age flappers. At one point, they did a striptease flashdance routine 
in silhouette, disrobing behind a lit screen. Can't make a video without a 
little of that soft-core show of flesh, right? 
</P>
<P>
There was a profligate, nearly continuous dispensation of stage smoke, of 
course, and elaborate lighting effects galore (one was exceptional: the spiral 
strands of blue-lit smoke that appeared during "Palomino," swirling like the 
whorls in Van Gogh's "Starry Night"). 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, you can't edit a concert the way you can a video, so Duran Duran 
-- Taylor, singer Simon Le Bon and keyboards player Nick Rhodes from the 
original lineup, plus four other musicians -- was stuck with its own generally 
uncompelling in-the-flesh presence. 
</P>
<P>
Le Bon performed energetically, with dance aerobics moves, but his singing was 
less robust. His thin voice, often boosted by echo effects, was muffled during 
some of the more dense song arrangements, and his singing lost power in the 
lower end of his range. 
</P>
<P>
If Duran Duran falls down on substance, it deserves some credit for style and 
proficiency. 
</P>
<P>
Songs like "Notorious" and "Is There Something I Should Know?" came across as 
effective, hard-hitting dance numbers that motivated a crowd somewhat older 
than the very young teens who made up the core of Duran Duran's following in 
the early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
And no band could have as many hits as Duran has registered without a good 
knack for a catchy pop hook. For those who are satisfied with a good beat, 
something pleasant to look at and a tune to hum, this was an enjoyably 
escapist, well-staged show. (In about 2 hours, it covered most of the hits by 
Duran Duran and its one-shot, offshoot band, the Power Station, as well as a 
good chunk of the current "Big Thing" album.) 
</P>
<P>
But intensity of feeling and force of expression still seem foreign to Duran 
Duran -- and by singing a song called "Do You Believe in Shame?" that was a 
shameless rip-off of Creedence Clearwater Revival's "Suzie Q," the group didn't 
score many points for originality, either. 
</P>
<P>
Having the women disrobe may have made good sense by music video's sex-sells 
standards, but it merely reinforced that, for this band, marketing outweighs 
meaning. The sequence came during a song, "Skin Trade," that purports to 
sympathize with a strip-joint dancer while lamenting the need to sell oneself 
for the sake of money: "In exploitation's name, we must be working for the Skin 
Trade." 
</P>
<P>
With this pimping stage enactment of the song, the group did all it could to 
exploit the very thing its lyrics question. But then again, why not? Pop 
music's Skin Trade has been very good to Duran Duran. 
</P>
<P>
If the public ever gets wise to this sort of seduction by video image, the '90s 
promise to be some good years, too -- although not necessarily for Duran Duran. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Band's Managers Bar Photos 
</P>
<P>
Duran Duran's managers refused to allow The Times to take pictures of the band 
during its performance at Irvine Meadows unless The Times signed over all 
rights to the photographs. The paper declined.

'GOSPEL EXTRAVAGANZA' WASN'T VERY STRONG ON SPIRIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While something of a mixed blessing, Saturday's "Feel the Spirit Gospel 
Extravaganza" at the Celebrity Theatre testified to the variety of avenues 
modern gospel music is taking. While updates of traditional black church music 
were offered by the Friendship Inspirational Voices and the Rev. Daryl Coley, 
singers Jon Gibson and Crystal Lewis presented music that drew more from 
secular pop-R&amp;B crossover styles, and J.C. and the Boys even presented a 
set of Christian rap music. 
</P>
<P>
If gospel music is now borrowing its styles from the pop charts, it's only 
fair, because the vocal styles that fueled R&amp;B and soul music (and, in 
turn, their rock imitators) for decades were drawn from black church music. Sam 
Cooke, Little Richard, Aretha Franklin, Al Green, James Brown, Marvin Gaye -- 
nearly without exception, the great R&amp;B and soul singers of the 1950s and 
'60s began in church and owed the raw, charged emotion of their styles to that 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
That undiluted style still runs strong in places. Anyone who has been in a 
gospel tent in the South -- where the music can fly like wild electricity and 
singers and musicians can become caught up in it far beyond their control -- 
would have found Saturday's show pallid by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Anaheim show offered other virtues. There was some fine ensemble 
singing from the 28-member Friendship Inspirational Voices from Yorba Linda's 
Friendship Baptist Church, though the choir scarcely had time to warm up in the 
two songs alloted. The Voices' director, Beverly Williams, and her husband, 
Duane, followed with a stronger set that mixed the dynamics and chorused 
responses of traditional gospel on a churchified "You Are the Sunshine of My 
Life" and three other tunes. 
</P>
<P>
Marring both performances somewhat was the backing bands' use of an array of 
squirrelly synthesizers, in place of the mainstay Hammond B3 organ. If there's 
a heaven and hell for musical instruments, there was strong indication of which 
destination has space reserved for synths. 
</P>
<P>
J.C. and the Boys, led by break-dance personality David Guzman (no breaking 
here, though), offered a capable, if little more than that, rap version of 
testifying. 
</P>
<P>
Singer Jon Gibson's use of backing tapes in place of a band made his set less 
immediate than it might have been, but he still proved an engaging performer. 
With a voice that at times sounds remarkably like Stevie Wonder's -- and 
passably like Michael Jackson's at others -- Gibson has found success on both 
the gospel and secular charts; his set reflected that mix. 
</P>
<P>
His strongest moments were the very Wonder-ish "Friend in You," an anti-suicide 
song, and a medley of Marvin Gaye's more spiritually minded songs, where 
instead of overlush backing tapes, he simply accompanied his voice with bongos. 
He was least compelling on the treacly pop of "Lost Inside You," a duet with 
Crystal Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her strong voice, Lewis' two-song set was similarly mired in weak, 
pop-derived material. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson's and Lewis' sets further suffered from the same malady that infects 
much of the rock music that aims to uplift in some manner: The artists 
evidently deem it sufficient to sing about inspiration, of whatever form, 
instead of delivering a performance that exemplifies inspiration by pushing at 
the limits of the artists' talent. 
</P>
<P>
Neither singer worked up too much of a sweat over the music, though singing to 
a theater that was less than one-quarter full could be an understandable 
damper. 
</P>
<P>
The closest the evening came to that kind of inspiration was in the closing set 
by Daryl Coley. The Oakland-based pastor isn't possessed of one of the more 
outstanding voices on the gospel circuit, but his tremendous group and 
inventive arrangements more than made up for that. Coley was backed by five 
singers and a hot, six-piece band influenced by fusion-funk, and his songs were 
full of rich, complex harmonies and percolating rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
Limited voice or no, Coley's singing and preaching conveyed a joy that had the 
audience on its feet and singing to close the lengthy program. 
</P>

SUGARMAN'S SCULPTURE LOOKS LIKE A G-RATED PLAYGROUND FOR ADULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Cathy Curtis 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Orange County's fledgling public-art front, every new entry inevitably 
invites comparison to "California Scenario," the sculpture garden by Isamu 
Noguchi in South Coast Plaza Town Center. 
</P>
<P>
Well, it looks like Town Center developer Henry Segerstrom can rest on his 
laurels for the time being. New York sculptor George Sugarman's cluster of 
painted steel pieces in the North sector of Koll Center Irvine, installed 
earlier this month, is more like a G-rated playground for adults than the kind 
of major work of art that people drive out of their way to see. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the 75-by-100-foot Sugarman sculpture plaza has undeniable charms as a 
lunchtime oasis for employees of the mixed-use commercial center, and as a 
welcoming fanfare for clients. Approaching the outdoor parking lot in front of 
Koll Center's looming landmark -- a pair of 12-story towers rising in 
horizontal slices of glass and red granite -- you can't help but notice the 
visual clamor the piece sets up. 
</P>
<P>
Massed together along the outer rim of the plaza in a careful way that respects 
the geometric divisions of the flagstone walkway, the eight sculptural groups 
-- composed of curving abstract forms that sometimes resemble figures or 
animals -- sing out like a musical-comedy chorus. 
</P>
<P>
But the most rewarding aspect of these pieces is their ability to welcome the 
casual stroller with amusing cut-out views of sky and buildings, variegated 
plays of light and shadow, and a variety of comfortable places to sit. 
</P>
<P>
The tallest sculpture (22 feet at its apex) presides from a central "upstage" 
position, looking very much like a huge, cut-paper construction. Viewed from 
the front, curved white ribbon-like pieces appear to anchor a big yellow 
central section pierced by a trio of large openings that let in the sky. As you 
walk around the piece, its forms can be read as simply as a child's primer. Yet 
they also afford a kaleidoscope of hide-and-seek views of the surrounding area. 
</P>
<P>
Directly "downstage," Sugarman has placed a pair of identical pieces. With 
their horizontal, undulating "bodies" capped by showy, free-form "heads," these 
sculptures -- one in pale apricot, the other in bright purple -- could be 
latter-day cousins of the ceremonial dragon shapes that appear in Chinese New 
Year parades. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere on the plaza, vertical elements in purple, turquoise, sky blue and 
leaf green cluster into two groups like conversing figures. (Sugarman has said, 
however, that he thinks of these pieces as "my abstract trees.") Slightly 
angled, as if bending from the waist, and unfolding in a flower-like way, these 
nearly identical pieces huddle in coveys of three and four. 
</P>
<P>
The other elements of the scheme are benches and chairs that incorporate the 
same flowing lines and shouting colors of the non-functional pieces. One bench 
"grows" out of three petal-like tiers in turquoise, green and maroon. Another 
bench, in sky blue and orange, incorporates a decorative hood-like element that 
provides protection from the sun's rays. Still another bench, with a curved 
back that mimics the arch of the tall yellow piece, rests on faintly humorous 
flat, wide "feet." 
</P>
<P>
Sitting on these pieces, you can hear the dull roar of traffic and the 
splashing sound of the fountain in front of the plaza, which spurts up in a 
genteel, close-to-the-vest way and then runs into a big pool. The play of water 
and sun and color (happily related to the turquoise trim of the terraced 
gardens and window trim on the buildings) creates a genuinely pleasing 
ambiance. 
</P>
<P>
Sugarman, 76, has come in for criticism over the years for his "vulgar" use of 
bright color. Vulgarity, of course, is in the eye of the beholder. As the 
artist has pointed out in his own defense, the ancient Greeks painted their 
statues in bright colors. 
</P>
<P>
What matters is that color is not tooting its horn at the expense of form. 
Besides, if ever there were an appropriate place to use assertive color, a 
sunny, aggressive Southern California business park would be have to be high on 
the list. 
</P>
<P>
The Sugarman sculpture plaza doesn't appear to embody any deep ideas or 
elaborate agenda as does the Noguchi sculpture garden, nor does it break new 
formal ground. Any group of art professionals could come up with many names of 
artists more likely to make a more ambitious and forward-looking statement. 
</P>
<P>
But, to its credit, the piece is neither a pious blue-chip monument or (as is 
so often the case) a blandly innocuous little ornament plopped in front of a 
building. And it is genuinely user-friendly. 
</P>
<P>
Koll Co. officials won't say what Sugarman's work cost, but it will be 
surprising if they don't feel they've recouped their investment when the two 
towers -- which opened in late 1987 and late 1988 -- are fully leased. (Koll 
Center's north parcel, to be completed in 1990, will include two more towers, a

The plaza is likely to be a popular gathering spot -- not a small thing in the 
featureless city of Irvine. Perhaps the Sugarman piece also will serve as one 
of several possible models for the city's Art in Public Places program, whose 
notions of how to choose and locate public sculpture so often seem to be 
nascent and confused. 
</P>
<P>
 George Sugarman's sculpture plaza is in the north sector of Koll Center 
Irvine, bounded by MacArthur Boulevard, Von Karman Avenue, the San Diego 
Freeway and Main Street.

SUDDEN STAR VAN SHELTON IS STILL A KID IN COUNTRY'S CANDY SHOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY GLEASON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A sinewy, slow-talking pipe fitter from Grit, Va., Ricky Van Shelton -- who 
will be at the Crazy Horse Steak House in Santa Ana tonight -- came to 
Nashville with big dreams and watched them come true: His debut album (called, 
appropriately enough, "Wild Eyed Dream") sold more than a million copies, and 
his follow-up, "Living Proof," is rapidly following suit. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel just like a kid in a candy shop," he said last week on the phone from 
Las Vegas, where he was sharing a bill with Reba McEntire. Like her, he has 
become a standard bearer for the "new traditional" movement in country music, 
recording songs originally performed by such classic acts as the Wilburn 
Brothers ("Somebody's Back in Town,") Patsy Cline ("He's Got You") and Jim 
Reeves ("From a Jack to a King.") 
</P>
<P>
Raised in the Pentecostal Holiness Church ("our church had lots of foot-stomper 
music"), Van Shelton, 37, "first heard country when I was running around with 
my older brother. The feel, the melody and the heart of it was so much like 
gospel, I immediately began loving it. I knew: That's what I wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
"I never went to a football game, a baseball game or a prom while I was in 
school. All I did was play, play, play." 
</P>
<P>
He did find time to get married, though. When he and his wife moved to 
Tennessee in 1984, she was instrumental in getting him his big break: She 
became friends with a prominent columnist from the Nashville Banner and gave 
the columnist one of Van Shelton's demo tapes. The columnist in turn gave the 
tape to Rick Blackburn, the head of CBS Records in Nashville. Intrigued by what 
he heard, Blackburn attended Van Shelton's live show. He offered the 
smoky-voiced crooner a contract on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
The next thing America knew, Van Shelton's first single, "Crime of Passion," 
was charging up the charts. The next three singles from "Wild Eyed Dream" -- 
"Somebody Lied," "Life Turned Her That Way" and "Don't We All Have the Right" 
-- all went straight to No. 1, and there's been no looking back since. 
</P>
<P>
Mixing a touch of rockabilly in with his traditional stylings has given Van 
Shelton a leg up with younger listeners. Women, meanwhile, seem captured by his 
smoldering good looks, his strong jaw and his blue, bedroom eyes. He has 
already been featured in Vogue and Elle (though he continues to insist: "I'm 
country and don't know how much those magazines mean"). 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night -- country or not -- he'll make his "Tonight Show" debut. 
</P>
<P>
Future plans call for a third album, then a Christmas record that's "going to 
be a Christmas production," he said. "Not country, not rock 'n' roll. Christmas 
music, which is really its own kind of music, with strings and its own kind of 
production. Just like Perry Como and Bing Crosby used to do." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he has been playing upward of 150 live dates a year. Beyond that, 
"there's a helluva lot of (promotional) work behind the scenes," he said, "a 
lot more to it than the public ever sees. But I'm not complaining. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until the year before last, I'd never paid more for a car than $500. I 
never had nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, if it all went away tomorrow, I wouldn't mind. I know about hard work 
and surviving. Once you've got that, there's nothing that'll scare you." 
</P>
<P>
 Ricky Van Shelton sings tonight at 7 and 10 at the Crazy Horse Steak House, 
1580 Brookhollow Drive, Santa Ana. Tickets: $29.50. Information: (714)

GIRL STRANGLED; 14-YEAR-OLD HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven-year-old Sara Nan Hodges of Newhall was strangled and her body stuffed 
into an 18-by-18-inch space beneath the headboard of a 14-year-old neighbor's 
water bed, apparently before she was reported missing last Thursday, Los 
Angeles County sheriff's deputies said this morning. 
</P>
<P>
The girl's body was found Sunday afternoon in a house five doors from her own 
home on Alderbrook Drive. (Story, Part I, Page 3.) The 14-year-old, who had 
lived with his mother in the house about two months, was arrested on suspicion 
of murder and was being held at Sylmar Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies said the suspect, who moved to Newhall from Florida after being 
involved in burglaries there, slept at night on the bed where the body was 
hidden until it was found Sunday by the owner of the home. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of death had not yet been determined. Deputies said the decomposition 
of the body led them to conclude that the girl was killed sometime after she 
was noticed missing at 2 p.m. Thursday, but before she was reported missing to 
the Sheriff's Department six hours later.

A massive mudslide closed the main road to Cedar Breaks National Monument and 
stripped off a half-mile section of pavement, and it continued to ooze downhill 
today, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The slide, roughly half a mile long and half a mile wide, sent mud and boulders 
cascading across State Road 14 sometime during the night and was discovered 
this morning, said Utah Department of Transportation spokesman Kim Morris. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported. The highway had been heavily traveled during the 
Easter weekend, the Utah Highway Patrol said.

WEATHER SLOWS ALASKAN OIL CLEANUP WORK;

GOVERNOR TO SEEK FEDERAL AID AFTER LARGEST U.S. OIL SPILL

<TEXT>
<P>
Rising winds today threatened efforts by about 200 workers to clean up the 
worst oil spill in North America, and Alaska's governor said he will ask 
President Bush to declare Prince William Sound a federal disaster area. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Steve Cowper has declared a state of emergency in the area -- one of the 
nation's richest waterways -- where 11 million gallons of crude oil gushed from 
the supertanker Exxon Valdez when it ran aground last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Cowper said he will ask Bush to declare the sound a federal disaster area to 
free funds for the immediate cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
"I say immediately because it's clear that Exxon is going to have to foot the 
bill sooner or later," he said. "I don't want to see any equipment sitting in 
port and waiting for a decision on whose decision it is to use it." 
</P>
<P>
The Exxon Shipping Co., which owns the Exxon Valdez, said an unqualified 
officer was in charge of the 987-foot supertanker at the time of the accident, 
which punctured eight of its 13 cargo tanks and spilled about 260,000 barrels 
of oil. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
100 Square Miles 
</P>
<P>
The flow of North Slope oil through the Alaskan Pipeline to Valdez has been cut 
to 800,000 barrels per day from its normal 2 million. The Alaskan Department of 
Environmental Conservation said tanker traffic could resume by Friday at the 
latest. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard said the spill grew to 100 square miles today and that rising 
winds -- reaching up to 30 knots -- and five- to six-foot seas threatened to 
hamper clean up efforts after calm weather over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Crews concentrated part of their efforts on pumping nearly 1 million barrels of 
oil remaining in the grounded tanker, perched on a rock reef 25 nautical miles 
south of Valdez, into another tanker, the Exxon Baton Rouge, tied alongside. 
</P>
<P>
"It's precariously balanced on the reef," Cowper said of the ship. "We don't 
want to have it roll over to one side and capsize. We also don't want it to 
break in half, obviously." 
</P>
<P>
The governor said in a radio interview that there were problems with the tanker 
because the computer that monitors its stability was "knocked out of whack" 
when it struck the rocks. 
</P>
<P>
He said very little of the spilled oil had reached the shoreline, but the Coast 
Guard said it had sent a group of seine fishing craft to lay booms around Bligh 
Island and the nearby subsistance fishing villages of Tatitlek and Galena. An 
Anchorage doctor said mandated blood alcohol tests of the captain, third mate 
and the helmsman might not be valid because samples were taken late.

THOUSANDS ROLL EGGS AT WHITE HOUSE

Thousands of children, with camera-toting parents in tow, swarmed the South 
Lawn of the White House today for the annual Easter egg roll. 
</P>
<P>
"This is neat," said Cara Gavejian, 9, of West Chester County, N.Y. Making her 
eighth visit to the event, she explained, "You get to go to the White House -- 
and get a day off from school." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush and his wife, Barbara, joined in the festivities that featured 
children rolling eggs across the thick lawn with spoons, and getting autographs 
from celebrities such as pro wrestler John Studd. 
</P>
<P>
Twice Bush blew a silver whistle to start egg rolls, but each time his 
grandchild, Ellie, 2, balked, prompting the President to raise his hands in 
mock frustration. 
</P>
<P>
Six Bush grandchildren -- Ellie, Marshall, 2, Pierce, 3, Loren, 4, Samuel, 4, 
and Ashley, 7 weeks -- joined youngsters from across the country on the South 
Lawn. 
</P>
<P>
The White House anticipated a crowd of 30,000 and had counted 22,000 by noon. 
</P>
<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle and his wife, Marilyn, also joined the crowd to sign 
autographs. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Turner of nearby Alexandria, Va., pushed a baby carriage holding her 
7-month-old child, Caitlin, and unabashedly admitted, "This is as much for 
parents, maybe more so, than it is for children." 
</P>
<P>
The White House event dates back to 1878 when Congress, weary of broken shells, 
banned the egg rolls initiated by Dolley Madison on the Capitol grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, except for wars and bad weather, the eggs have rolled every Easter 
Monday.

Tourists watched in amazement today as Venice's gondoliers dumped canal rubbish 
in front of the city hall for the second time in 24 hours to protest the city's 
squalid appearance.

On Sunday, 60 gondoliers toured the city in 30 boats collecting bottles, cans, 
fast food containers and other urban rubbish from the canals. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of tourists in Venice for the Easter weekend watched and took photos 
as the whole lot was dumped in front of the council's offices. "In recent 
months, we've made numerous appeals to the authorities (to clean up the city), 
but they've done nothing," said Antonio Scarpa, spokesman for the Gondoliers 
for Venice group.

The judge at Oliver L. North's trial ruled today that Ronald Reagan won't 
appear Friday as the defense's first witness but he held open the possibility 
that the former President might be called later. 
</P>
<P>
In a two-page order, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell directed North's 
lawyers to file "a succinct particularized statement of facts" that North 
"desires to elicit from President Reagan." Gesell said the defense should file 
that under seal by late Wednesday afternoon. The prosecution won't be permitted 
to see it. 
</P>
<P>
"There is insufficient time to resolve the pending questions relating to 
President Reagan's personal appearance to contemplate his appearance by Friday, 
March 31, as requested," Gesell said.

YELTSIN VIEWS VICTORY IN MOSCOW AS CALL FOR SPEEDED-UP REFORMS

<TEXT>
<P>
Maverick Communist Boris N. Yeltsin, savoring his landslide electoral victory, 
said today that his success proved a need to speed up Kremlin chief Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's perestroika reform program. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin won almost 90% of the vote in a battle against an officially backed 
candidate in Moscow in the first contested Soviet general election in 70 years. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Reuters, the white-haired former Moscow party boss seemed 
to regret that his relationship with Gorbachev had lost its old warmth. 
</P>
<P>
But he said his crushing victory created a need for a "faster choice on 
speeding up perestroika." 
</P>
<P>
"I think this has given perestroika a certain urgency and has helped to break 
away from our tradition of presenting all that we do in rosy colors," said 
Yeltsin, fired from the Moscow party leadership in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"It is time to call a spade a spade," he added in the blunt manner that has won 
him both enemies and admirers. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin refused to speculate on his career, apparently wary of reviving charges 
that he was driven by overwhelming ambition. 
</P>
<P>
He dismissed charges from the camp of his defeated rival, automobile plant 
director Yevgeny Brakov, that his campaign was based on "cheap publicity."

SEARS TO SELL DIVISION OF COLDWELL BANKER;

<P>
Sears, Roebuck and Co. today announced the sale of its Coldwell Banker 
commercial real estate business to a management group and a group of outside 
investors for an undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
Terms were not disclosed for the sale of the nation's largest commercial real 
estate company that Sears bought in December, 1981, when it was branching out 
into financial services. Analysts said they expected the sale to bring in about 
$300 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$460 Million in Revenue 
</P>
<P>
Coldwell Banker had 1988 gross revenues of more than $460 million. 
</P>
<P>
Sears said in a statement that the sale was part of its corporate restructuring 
plan to strengthen its consumer operations. Sears will retain ownership of the 
Coldwell Banker residential real estate business and of the Coldwell Banker 
name. 
</P>
<P>
The outside investors include Frederick V. Malek of Washington; the Carlyle 
Group, a Washington-based merchant banking firm, and a group of prominent U.S. 
and Japanese investors, Sears said in a statement. Financing is being arranged 
by Sumitomo Bank and Bankers Trust Co. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Employee Ownership 
</P>
<P>
Sears said a substantial part of the company will be owned by its 5,000 
employees, but did not specify the size. 
</P>
<P>
"The enthusiasm and commitment of our employees to participate in ownership of 
the company will return its ownership to an employee-based entrepreneurial 
direction and validates our existing strategies," Malek said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Largest Retail Chain 
</P>
<P>
Last October, Sears said it planned to sell the commercial real estate 
operation. The real estate group, which was founded in 1906 in San Francisco, 
has offices in about 100 locations in the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago-based Sears also operates the nation's largest retail chain and owns 
Allstate Insurance and the Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. brokerage firm. 
</P>
<P>
The retail stores have undergone a face lifting, changing to everyday low 
prices in a bid to lure customers to Sears' 824 retail outlets.

The Council of Agriculture said today it will not give in to pressure from the 
U.S. rice lobby to open up its market and renew an agreement to limit its rice 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not bow to their demand because it will disrupt our rice production 
and hurt our farmers," Keh Ching-chao, a spokesman for the Taiwan government 
agency, said. 
</P>
<P>
Council Chairman Yu I-hsien told Parliament last week that the U.S. Rice 
Millers Assn. had failed to open the Japanese market and had turned its 
attention to Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
Keh said the association was trying to use its political clout to gain access 
to the Taiwan market and force Taipei to renew the rice contracts.

Sales of existing homes fell 3.1% in February, the second straight monthly 
decline, as buyers put off purchases because of higher mortgage interest rates, 
a real estate trade group reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Realtors said sales of existing single-family homes 
dropped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.44 million units in February 
after a 9.4% decline in January. 
</P>
<P>
Last month's sales pace was the slowest since March, 1988, when the annual rate 
was 3.38 million units. 
</P>
<P>
The realtors group attributed the drop in sales to the Federal Reserve Board's 
yearlong campaign to drive up interest rates in an effort to slow the economy 
and ease inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fed's credit stance is working," said association President Ira Gribin. 
"Interest rates are pushed up and buyers are pushed out." 
</P>
<P>
Fixed-rate home mortgages last month averaged between 10.55% and 10.78%, 
according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. On one-year adjustable-rate 
mortgages, lenders were asking an average initial rate of between 8.56% and 
8.73%. 
</P>
<P>
The median price of an existing home sold last month rose 3.8% to $93,100 as 
buyers in the lower price ranges stayed out of the market due to the higher 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, in times of rising rates, the people left in the market tend to be 
upper-income buyers who can buy the house they want regardless of less 
affordable financing," said John Tuccillo, chief economist for the realtors. 
</P>
<P>
February's decline in home sales was led by a sharp drop in the Northeast, 
where resales were down 18.3% from the previous month. Sales were down 0.8% in 
the South and 1.1% in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
The West was the only region to record an increase in sales last month, with 
the annual rate rising 3.2%.

MCorp, the second largest banking company in Texas, said today it will file for 
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code because 
of involuntary bankruptcy petitions filed against it. 
</P>
<P>
The Texas-based banking concern, which last autumn stopped making interest and 
principal payments on about $470 million of debt while it attempted to 
recapitalize, said three noteholders last week filed a petition in federal 
bankruptcy court in New York seeking to have MCorp liquidated involuntarily. 
</P>
<P>
MCorp spokesman George A. McCane said it learned Friday that the involuntary 
bankruptcy petitions had been filed. 
</P>
<P>
Gene H. Bishop, MCorp's chairman and chief executive officer, said he hoped the 
action by a very small number of noteholders seeking to force MCorp to 
liquidate its holdings would not disrupt or interfere with ongoing discussions 
by prospective investors with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. on the terms 
of a comprehensive recapitalization plan. 
</P>
<P>
Under federal bankruptcy law, the MBanks cannot be made subject to a bankruptcy 
petition, and MCorp's Chapter 11 filing would supersede the Chapter 7 petition.
