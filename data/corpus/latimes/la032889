THE LONG LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The militant Operation Rescue leaders brought their campaign of intimidation to 
Los Angeles last week, and local supporters of women's rights proved they would 
not bow to the pressure. Clearly, the demonstrators had some impact by 
publicizing their cause and keeping some women away from the clinics. Just as 
clearly, those who support keeping abortion legal had an impact by showing that 
they would not be bullied. None of this, however, raises the level of debate. 
</P>
<P>
The clinics that were picketed last week will not close merely because people 
are willing to violate the law to blockade their entrances. They may close or 
be severely restricted, however, if the U.S. Supreme Court reinterprets its own 
decision on how closely states may regulate abortion. That is the real threat, 
and both sides are trying to ensure that their point of view cannot escape the 
justices' notice as they deliberate a Missouri case in coming months. The 
automobile convoys, the placards, the walkie-talkies employed here last week 
may be only a preview if the court throws abortion regulation open to the 50 
state legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion is the latest in the long chain of volatile issues that has emerged as 
women seek to change their place in American life. Past conflicts have emerged 
when women, left out of the Constitution by the Founding Fathers, sought not to 
be considered the property of their husbands, to own real property themselves, 
to attend college, to vote, to enter professions and blue-collar fields in 
which they had not traditionally worked, to obtain birth control information 
and to receive equal pay. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, abortion was not always this hot an issue. Reading history shows that 
abortion has been legal for much of the nation's 200 years. Historians around 
the country have been drafting a brief for the upcoming Supreme Court case in 
which they point out that abortion was a known and legal practice when the 
Constitution was written. It remained a common and highly visible practice well 
into the 19th Century. Those laws that did seek to regulate it did so to 
protect pregnant women from the dangerous abortion techniques of the time. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors were the leading force seeking regulation in the middle of the 19th 
Century. They wanted to control medical practice by keeping out midwives and 
abortionists. Other groups, reacting to the growing women's rights movement in 
the late 19th Century, sought to restrict abortion to keep women at home 
bearing children, the historians say; still others feared too many Protestants 
were using abortion and therefore white Anglo-Saxon families would be 
outnumbered by immigrants with large families. Only in recent decades has 
concern with killingfetuses become the focal point of abortion arguments. 
</P>
<P>
That is obviously the concern voiced by Operation Rescue. Its followers must be 
allowed to demonstrate, even to place their ugly signs in the hands of 
children, as long as they are willing to pay the law's price for their 
violations. In this regard, local police generally acted with restraint last 
week in the face of hundreds of demonstrators who wanted to be arrested but 
refused to cooperate during the procedure. Charging leader Randall Terry with 
conspiracy to commit a crime was, however, an excessive restriction on free 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
The long line that traces the progress of women's rights since the earliest 
days of the Republic is a line that inches ever upward despite the tactics of 
desperate opponents. It does so because of those women and men who repeatedly 
stand up for what they believe, as pro-choice advocates did this past week. As 
the poet Adrienne Rich has written, women knew early on that their efforts for 
equality would not be a simple walk across an open field.

THEY DESERVE A RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We Americans are the people of an idea and not of blood or tribe. 
</P>
<P>
We have come from many places and believe many different things. For that 
reason, we rely less than other nations on the unspoken consensus born of 
custom and tradition. In their place we have a written Constitution whose 
principles are elaborated in a dynamic code of law. To foreigners, the legal 
system through which we interpret that Constitution and enforce those laws 
often appears baroque and contentious. Sometimes it is. But it also is an 
historic engine of equality and equity. Faith in our courts and their judges is 
an essential article in the American creed. 
</P>
<P>
But while judges, particularly federal judges, stand high in the public's 
esteem, they rank rather low on the legal profession's payroll. That is why we 
support Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's recent call for Congress to vote 
the federal judiciary a 30% raise. 
</P>
<P>
The chief justice made his request at a rare press conference, called after 
Congress defeated a measure that would have given a 50% pay increase to its 
members, top officials of the executive branch and federal judges. 
</P>
<P>
Rehnquist, however, made a convincing case for letting a judicial pay increase 
stand or fall on its own merits. He called the situation urgent, and facts bear 
him out: Over the past 20 years, inflation has outpaced judicial pay raises by 
223%. While federal judicial salaries now range from $89,500 for a district 
judge to $115,000 for the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, private-sector 
legal salaries have skyrocketed. Major law firms in Los Angeles currently pay 
their partners more than half a million dollars a year, and at big city firms 
across the country, first year lawyers often earn more than $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
Rehnquist argued that the growing gap between judges' salaries and those of the 
lawyers who appear before them "poses the most serious threat to the future of 
the judiciary and its continued operations that I have observed during my 
lifetime." He said that without a pay raise, federal judges, who are appointed 
for life, increasingly may use the bench as a step on the ladder toward 
lucrative private careers. The American Bar Assn. believes that a quarter of 
the country's more than 1,000 federal judges may choose to step down for 
financial reasons. 
</P>
<P>
This is a telling point, for, as the chief justice pointed out, the federal 
tradition of lifetime judicial service "gives you a different kind of judge, 
someone simply devoted to judging rather than looking out of the corner of his 
eye for the next political opportunity that comes along."

15-CARRIER U.S. NAVY

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trost's column clearly articulates this nation's dependence on naval forces to 
fulfill our national security interests. Unfortunately, in his effort to tout 
the necessity for 15 carriers, the admiral omitted any reference to the 
contribution the amphibious forces make to a naval campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Conspicuously absent is any mention that an Amphibious Task Force (made up of 
Navy and Marine Corps forces) provides a credible forcible entry capability to 
project power ashore. This "Gator Navy" can and often does operate with the 
carrier battle group. It is doubtful that the carrier battle group alone can " 
. . . Take complete control of an area" without amphibious forces.

15-CARRIER U.S. NAVY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trost's defense of our need for a "15-carrier Navy" fails to address the most 
elementary consideration for these multibillion-dollar task forces, their 
vulnerability to ICBM attack. A point he did make which we can also seriously 
dispute in today's world is the ability of the Navy to protect us and insure 
our survival, let alone our prosperity. The nuclear standoff that has existed 
between us and the Soviets for the last 30 years is responsible for our 
survival, and not our 15-carrier Navy. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the battleships are gone all that remains of the traditional fleet for 
the admirals to man is its carrier task forces and nuclear submarines. With a 
defense budget that is now helping to bankrupt us, there is little doubt where 
our limited financial resources should be spent. Nuclear submarines, although 
they lack the visible deterrence of our carriers, are a far more effective 
defense than carriers simply because, in addition to their tremendous 
multiple-warhead missile firing capability, they are much less vulnerable to 
attack. They give those of us paying for the largest defense budget in our 
history a weapon capable of surviving a nuclear attack which is also a real 
deterrent to our enemies. 
</P>
<P>
Satellites and radar track the position of our carrier task forces within a few 
hundred feet anywhere on the earth. They are prime, highly vulnerable targets 
for ICBM attack in a nuclear war, and will be vaporized along with our cities. 
All that will be left are our Trident submarines.

U.S. POLICY ON IMMIGRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the traditional admonition "don't pick a fight with those who buy ink 
by the barrel," it seems appropriate to respond to several aspects of your 
editorials on Feb. 22 ("Bad Scene in South Texas") and March 8 ("Spotlight on 
the INS") regarding Immigration and Naturalization Service and U.S. immigration 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
First, with respect to my tenure as INS commissioner, please note the 
following: I am still on the job; I am currently the most senior high level 
political appointee in the Department of Justice, having served under Attorneys 
General William French Smith, Ed Meese and Dick Thornburgh over 7 1/2 years; I 
have not been informed either that I will be staying or departing; I will 
continue to serve at the pleasure of the President and attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
Second, it would seem The Times would recognize and acknowledge the tremendous 
management and policy improvements in immigration over the last 7 1/2 years. In 
Southern California alone, over 1 1/2 million former illegal aliens were 
legalized under the very successful program conducted by INS. 
</P>
<P>
With respect to some of the suggestions of The Times for reorganization, these 
in all probability would create more problems than they will solve. For 
example, the Border Patrol, with other immigration functions, has long been 
central to a successful national policy. 
</P>
<P>
The last point relates to The Times frequent support for the approach of 
"extended voluntary departure" (EVD) where aliens from Central American 
countries would be allowed to come to the U.S., stay here until conditions 
improve, and then be required to return. It is very naive for The Times not to 
realize the obvious: If we invite Central Americans (22 million) to come to the 
United States, it would be a tremendous magnet, with potentially millions of 
aliens coming to this country. Once they have come to the U.S., how would we 
make any reasonable determination in a few years that conditions were now all 
right for them to return? Beyond that, how would we effectively locate and then 
uproot people who had been here several years, become part of our society, and 
return them to Central America? 
</P>
<P>
If there is one lesson learned with illegal immigration, it is that the longer 
a person is here illegally, the more difficult it is to remove him. EVD is not 
a solution; it is part of the problem.

BUSH'S NICARAGUAN PLAN BUYS TIME BUT PERHAPS LITTLE ELSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABRAHAM F. LOWENTHAL, Abraham F. Lowenthal, a professor of international 
relations at USC, is executive director of the Inter-American Dialogue. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bipartisan accord on Nicaraguan policy unveiled last Friday by President 
Bush, Secretary of State James A. Baker III and the congressional leadership is 
an impressive and welcome achievement, yet it may be illusory and could presage 
trouble ahead. 
</P>
<P>
The new consensus, engineered personally by Baker over the past few weeks, is 
impressive because it has sharply narrowed the range of debate in Washington 
over Nicaragua. For the first time in years, it is now possible to imagine a 
sustainable national approach. Bush and Baker have acknowledged that the Reagan 
Administration policy of seeking the overthrow of the Sandinistas has failed. 
After almost a decade of bitter conflict between Democrats and Republicans and 
the executive branch and Congress -- as well as within both branches and 
parties -- there is now some real prospect that Washington can concentrate its 
attention and energy on other issues. 
</P>
<P>
This new consensus is possible in part because of broad agreement in Washington 
on the security and political objectives of U.S. policy: to prevent Nicaragua 
from becoming a Soviet military base, to protect Nicaragua's neighbors from 
subversion or attack by the Sandinistas and to promote political opening and 
movement toward democracy in Nicaragua. Up to now, however, agreement on these 
broad principles -- evident already in the agreement two years ago between 
President Ronald Reagan and House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) -- failed to 
produce a bipartisan policy because of important continuing differences over 
criteria for the evaluation of progress toward these goals, as well as strong 
disagreement over the means to achieve them, and because of the deep distrust 
between Congress and the executive branch. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush-Baker team managed to produce a heretofore elusive consensus by 
demonstrating astute flexibility on matters of substance and of procedure. The 
Administration has accepted the point made repeatedly by congressional 
Democrats -- that the aim of U.S. policy need not be to oust the Sandinista 
regime or force it to "cry uncle," as long as Nicaragua's actions do not 
threaten important American interests. And the Bush-Baker team, by conceding to 
Congress a chance to review and evaluate Administration policy next November, 
has won a chance to speak for U.S. policy in Central America without perpetual 
congressional dissent. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional Democrats, for their part, have been persuaded, at least for now, 
to trust that Secretary Baker will give diplomacy a real try in Central 
America. They are willing to provide further non-military assistance to the 
Contras, in part as a means of pressuring the Sandinistas to negotiate with 
their opponents. And most Republicans, suspicious of any move to negotiate with 
the Sandinistas, are going along with the Baker proposal because aid to the 
Contras will be sustained until next February, at which time the Sandinistas 
promise to hold free and fair national elections should be tested. The right 
believes that the scheduled elections, if held, will provide an opportunity to 
weaken and perhaps mortally wound the Sandinistas; if the elections are put off 
or blatantly rigged, conservative Republicans expect to build support for 
renewed military aid to the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
For all these reasons, the Administration's proposal for humanitarian aid to 
the Contras will probably be approved by a wide margin in both Houses. After a 
series of cliffhanger votes during the past several years, with the Contra aid 
spigot being turned on and off, the Bush-Baker team has succeeded in enlisting 
broad support for its policy for almost a year in advance. 
</P>
<P>
The undoubted virtues of the Bush-Baker strategy are that they open the door to 
a much more pragmatic regional approach and gives both the Administration and 
Central American diplomats some room to maneuver. The problems with this 
approach, however, are that it puts the consideration of security issues on 
hold, postpones any effort to promote regional economic recovery and leaves the 
Contras and others uncertain about eventual U.S. policy -- while Washington 
waits for a democratic opening in Nicaragua that could take years to 
accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration's plan, unfortunately, makes far more sense in terms of 
Washington's politics than in terms of Central America's realities -- or even 
of the fundamental priorities of U.S. policy. The danger is that by focusing on 
democracy as a goal -- one that all Americans can embrace -- the crucial need 
to reach security agreements reducing the Soviet and Cuban presence in 
Nicaragua may be postponed. Another problem is that the accord fails to define 
any criteria for judging adequate progress toward democracy. For congressional 
conservatives, the democratization of Nicaragua is still tantamount to the 
Sandinistas' defeat. In any event, it is unlikely that Nicaragua's Marxists 
will become Jeffersonians or that Nicaragua will soon resemble Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
If, as is entirely possible, the Sandinistas foreclose the immediate 
possibility of losing power, the conservatives will predictably return to 
arguing that U.S. interests require the Sandinistas' ouster. The debate in 
Washington will then be back close to square one. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is, Congress and the Administration still have not really decided 
whether -- as President Bush put it -- "to claim the right to order the 
politics of Nicaragua." Until this question is faced, Central America remains 
likely to demand an inordinate share of Washington's attention.

GIVE CRISTIANI A CHANCE TO DELIVER IN DEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID DREIER, Rep. David Dreier (R-La Verne) is chairman of the Republican 
Task Force on Foreign Policy. He was a member of a bipartisan U.S. observer 
team during El Salvador's election. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The significance of the March 19 presidential election in El Salvador cannot be 
overstated. The process was a fair one and, as a result, the first democratic 
succession to power in that nation's history will take place on June 1. The 
real outcome, however, may not be decided for as much as a full year. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the transportation boycott and terrorist threats by the Marxist 
guerrilla forces prior to and throughout the day of the election, Salvadorans 
risked their personal safety to vote. They were motivated by a strong desire 
for change, having grown weary of terrorism, corruption and a crippled economy. 
The results of their effort should be a clear sign to the United States that El 
Salvador is crying out for peace, stability and economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
During the post-election period, U.S. policy toward this war-torn country must 
remain consistent. Since 1981, the United States has supported three "centrist" 
governments in El Salvador in their struggle with the leftist Farabundo Marti 
National Liberation Front (FMLN). With U.S. encouragement, these governments 
enacted reforms and promoted democracy to undermine the leftist insurgency, 
while attempting to control the politically motivated killing attributed to 
death squads and security forces. 
</P>
<P>
Ongoing U.S.-Salvadoran cooperation has kept open and given shape to a 
democratic option that seemed unthinkable in 1980. The United States has since 
provided $2.4 billion in economic assistance for private-sector initiatives, as 
well as to the government to repair damage to the economic infrastructure from 
guerrilla sabotage and the October, 1986, earthquake. It also supports programs 
in education, health, land reform, human rights and judicial reform. From its 
inception in the waning days of the Jimmy Carter Administration, military and 
economic aid to El Salvador has grown to a level that places it fifth among the 
world's largest recipients of U.S. aid. After virtually no military assistance 
between 1977-81, the United States has provided more than $800 million in such 
aid to help equip, train and professionalize the Salvadoran army. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, El Salvador continues to be ripe for a communist takeover. Since 
the FMLN is not strong enough to win militarily or through the ballot box, it 
has adopted a strategy of violence that resists the democratization of power. 
</P>
<P>
Through terrorism and sabotage, the FMLN tried to provoke a pre-election 
outburst of governmental repression. The FMLN now openly hopes that such 
repression will come about since Arena the rightist Nationalist Republican 
Alliance, has won the presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels' course of action is to incite Arena's extremist element into 
resuming death-squad atrocities and immobilizing the government, resulting in a 
cutoff of U.S. aid. An end to U.S. aid would be followed by an army coup and a 
return to the military's "dirty war" tactics. Popular outrage would lead to 
increased support for the FMLN and eventually to a communist victory. Already, 
the FMLN has killed or forced from office 93 elected mayors and has threatened 
the judiciary. In addition, many believe that FMLN may sacrifice its own 
members and blame the deaths on Arena. 
</P>
<P>
In efforts to reach a negotiated settlement to the war, the FMLN has insisted 
on peace through government surrender. This position was outlined in guerrilla 
documents captured by the Salvadoran army in February, 1988. A communication 
between FMLN leaders on the peace talks reads in part: "The dialogue is not an 
end. It is a means. Whatever form a negotiated political solution takes does 
not mean that we cease the struggle." 
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Cristiani of Arena captured a majority of the votes March 19 and will 
become the next president. Before critics of Arena push for an end to U.S. aid, 
Cristiani deserves a chance to deliver on his pledges to improve the nation's 
health-care and education systems, the economy and the central government, and 
to be a true commander-in-chief. Continued U.S. aid must foster a free-market 
economy, sustained human-rights improvements and increased military 
professionalism. 
</P>
<P>
The election demonstrated again the Salvadorans' commitment to building a 
modern system of political debate, choices and competition. It is now up to 
Arena to prove with deeds, not words, that the party is up to the task. 
Cristiani must demonstrate that Arena has taken a moderate course. As Vice 
President Dan Quayle stressed during his February trip to El Salvador, the 
United States will be watching for signs of renewed death squad activity. 
</P>
<P>
If Cristiani and Arena fail, the winner of the March 19 election could well be 
the FMLN, with serious consequences for both U.S. security and democratic 
movements around the world.

Of course it sounds raw. But four of America's top mayors, each after more than 
a decade in office, might serve their cities best by exiting City Hall. Each, 
in his time, served his city well.

Marion Barry fought Congress' plantation-like white rule of black Washington,

</P>
<P>
Ed Koch got tough with municipal unions, cut fat out of New York's bloated 
budgets and exuded a kind of never-say-die chutzpah that restored the Big 
Apple's self-confidence after its disastrous fiscal crisis and "down years" of 
the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Bradley, a quiet and unassuming ex-cop, not only proved a black could get 
elected in a polyglot, non-black town, but presided over Los Angeles' 
maturation into one of the world's great cities. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman Young, fiery civil-rights radical who fought for union rights against 
the big auto companies in the '30s, inherited a Detroit in an advanced stage of 
urban rot in 1973. He made early alliances with a Republican Gov. William 
Milliken and Henry Ford II to pull public aid and private investment into his 
recession-racked city. 
</P>
<P>
But now, Koch and Barry are marshaling their tired political troops to run for 
unprecedented fourth terms; Bradley and Young for equally unprecedented fifth 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, New York, Los Angeles and Detroit all face new, tough problems that 
none of the incumbents seem well-equipped to deal with. One looks in vain for 
any sense of vision, of mission for their their cities. Instead, their honors 
busy themselves putting out political fires. Once the personification of the 
solution for his town, each man looks suspiciously like the problem. 
</P>
<P>
These incumbents might well heed the words of Charles Royer, who is voluntarily 
stepping down after 12 distinguished years as mayor of Seattle: "I don't want 
to be a hanger-on who runs because there is an election." What seems to 
motivate Barry, Koch, Bradley and Young is the thrill of the race -- not gusto 
for attacking their cities' mounting problems. 
</P>
<P>
Barry, personally embroiled in rumors of drug use, presides over a city in the 
grip of terrifying drug wars and a spiraling, worst-in-the-nation murder rate. 
His bloated bureaucracy appears increasingly dysfunctional. Business supporters 
once enamored of Barry's pro-development policies for downtown are jumping 
ship. There's plausible argument that Barry should resign now, but he says the 
odds are 60-40 that he'll run again next year. 
</P>
<P>
Koch looked the other way as scandals of epic proportions permeated New York 
officialdom. The city's finances are getting shaky again. There's a growing, 
fearsome gap between New York's ostentatious wealthy and its homeless, its 
underclass and just plain working poor. Koch's own hot racial rhetoric has 
polarized the city. Polls show his support at an all-time low. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, now 71, is such a nice guy that many call him a Teflon mayor. 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky raised more than $1 million to challenge Bradley, 
but stepped back when polls showed the mayor virtually unbeatable. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles was thus deprived, the California Journal reports, of a "tough 
debate about the leadership of a city that sometimes looks to be a 
palm-tree-lined swamp of drug dealers, street gangs, traffic congestion, smog, 
mini-malls and high-rises, sewage and unaffordable housing." 
</P>
<P>
Detroit has blocks of downtown emptiness reminiscent of many cities soon after 
the riots of the '60s -- despite the infusion of billions. Its neighborhoods 
are grievously neglected: In 1988, not a single new house was built in all of 
Detroit. Polls show a majority of Detroiters think Young, now 70, should step 
down. But with a $4-million war chest, the old master still lusts for the fray. 
</P>
<P>
Like the President, mayors should probably be limited to two -- or at most 
three -- four-year terms. After eight or 12 years, exhaustion, corruption, 
boredom, often times arrogance, come sneaking in, however brilliant the leader 
may have been. 
</P>
<P>
We have a Congress full of nearly invincible incumbents, feeding off 
special-interest contributions. And now we may be threatened by almost-for-life 
mayors feeding off the huge contributions of developers and other interests 
with a big stake in city contracts and zoning. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia, San Francisco, Dallas and Atlanta are lucky to be among the 
relatively few cities with limits on mayors' terms. For other towns, the only 
solution may be for voters alert enough to say, "Thanks for the memories" -- 
and then show their burnt-out incumbents the door.

TERAOKA -- SENSUAL BUT MORE SOMBER THIS TIME AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINE McKENNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Masami Teraoka has always taken a tolerant view of the folly of humankind. A 
social critic in the tradition of Daumier and Thomas Nast, he has explored 
man's ignorance and shortsightedness with the wise bemusement of an indulgent 
parent. 
</P>
<P>
Frantically racing about, soiling his own nest, a slave to sensual pleasure, 
blind to the glory of nature, man is obviously a rather foolish creature, but 
like a mischievous dog that persists in chewing up the paper, he makes you love 
him anyway. Teraoka affects a sharp shift in tone in his latest series, 
however. A mournful requiem for AIDS and a warning of even darker days to come, 
"Waves and Plagues" speaks with a grave sense of finality altogether absent in 
previous work by this enormously popular artist. 
</P>
<P>
On view at the Long Beach Museum of Art through April 25, "Waves and Plagues" 
may be a bit too heavy for Teraoka's longtime fans who have loved his work for 
its playful handling of erotica -- one of the cornerstones of Japanese art -- 
and the comical collision of the cultures of Japan and the United States. A 
master of the visual pun, Teraoka has explored pollution and the corruption of 
tradition as symbolized by such things as the junk-food industry and the 
tourist trade, and invariably made his point with an extremely light touch. If 
you failed to get the message or the jokes in his delightfully naughty 
paintings, you could always luxuriate in their overripe beauty or marvel at 
Teraoka's dazzling technique. 
</P>
<P>
It is, however, virtually impossible to miss the point in this new work; these 
pictures resonate with an overwhelming sadness that's moving and unmistakably 
grim. "Waves and Plagues" is but the latest in a spate of exhibitions designed 
to increase public awareness of the AIDS epidemic, and the recent death of 
esteemed photographer Robert Mapplethorpe will no doubt generate a few more. 
(LACE presented a survey of AIDS-related art last fall, and a similar 
exhibition of photographs by Rosalind Solomon opens at UC San Diego today). 
</P>
<P>
Born in Japan in 1936, Teraoka emigrated to the United States in 1961 and 
became caught up in the then-burgeoning Pop art movement. Synthesizing the 
disparate influences of Japan, America and Pop, he arrived at a style rooted in 
the traditional Japanese printmaking form known as Ukiyo-e. 
</P>
<P>
A vibrant yet meticulously controlled wood-block print technique, Ukiyo-e 
became popular in Japan in 1615 and thrived before it disappeared in 1868. 
Basically a form of genre art, Ukiyo-e is comparable to modern-day comic books 
in that these images are often inscribed with text illustrating a corresponding 
story. Teraoka revived the style and made it current by using it to tell modern 
stories loaded with hip nuances, and his reputation spread like wildfire after 
his first major one-man show in 1975. (The fact that his work reproduces well 
didn't hurt.) 
</P>
<P>
Teraoka's longtime preoccupation with nature and eros dovetail perfectly in 
AIDS, which he perceives as a metaphor for the wrath of nature and a 
foreshadowing of even greater ecological disasters to come. He delivers his 
warning here in the form of parables, many of which employ the structure of 
Kabuki theater. The recurring motifs in these highly detailed compositions 
function on multiple levels; the snake, for instance, symbolizes the AIDS 
virus, while condoms represent the forethought one must now bring to sex. 
</P>
<P>
Tormented, angry figures wear blue makeup that signifies they've died but are 
unable to rest in peace. "He died but his soul hasn't really passed on yet; it 
wanders around," reads the text on a particularly powerful image. The lush 
beauty of Teraoka's watercolor style juxtaposed with the anguish and confusion 
of the figures in these images makes them doubly heartbreaking. 
</P>
<P>
Nine years ago, Teraoka relocated from Los Angeles to Hawaii, and not 
surprisingly, the shift in locale is reflected in his art. Whereas previously 
his work occasionally verged on being hysterically busy, "Waves and Plagues" 
exudes a quiet, somber simplicity (which could, of course, have something to do 
with the subject matter). Life in a tropical paradise has also increased his 
concern with ecological issues, and he has begun doing straight landscapes, a 
few of which stand among his finest work. "Pali Lookout," a small landscape of 
a bank of green cliffs eroded by the sea pulsates with a mysterious ambiguity 
that leaves it open to more varied interpretation than his narrative scenes 
allow. 
</P>
<P>
However, the occasional luminous landscape does little to disguise the fact 
that Teraoka is essentially a fin de siecle artist working at the top of his 
form. Fin de siecle is a French term describing the final flowering of a 
culture that's become so perversely overwound and diseased that it's on the 
verge of blowing apart; that's pretty much what "Waves and Plagues" is about.

The Easter Bunny that visited Children's Hospital here on Sunday was tall, dark 
and handsome and had a glorious tenor voice. With Easter baskets and chocolate 
rabbits in tow, opera star Placido Domingo spent time with about 20 young 
patients, ages 3-16, who are suffering from cancer and other serious illnesses. 
Domingo is co-founder and international chairman of Children's Bright Horizons, 
a nonprofit foundation dedicated to improving the quality of life for sick and 
needy children. Last week, he had arranged for several hundred seriously ill 
children to attend "Otello" (which he is performing here), but when some were 
too sick to attend, he decided to pay them an Easter visit. "A lot of kids 
didn't recognize him, but I think they were really excited about having 
somebody visit them on Easter," hospital spokeswoman Michelle Barker said. The 
presence of television cameras also told them that something special was going 
on. ALEENE MacMINN

The telecast of the 61st Academy Awards Wednesday night will feature nearly 
seven minutes of computer animation, said to be a record for an awards 
broadcast. Designed by graphic artist C. David Pena, the visual lead-ins to the 
various categories feature silver film strips, gold Oscars statues and neon-lit 
movie marquees to match the program's theme of "That Old Hollywood Glamour." A 
computer-generated envelope will open to reveal the name of each winner and a 
simulation of the beaded curtain in the Shrine Auditorium will rise to reveal 
the staged production numbers. The animation was created at the Limelight 
Studio in Hollywood. ALEENE MacMINN

More on the Case of the Disappointed Jurist Desperately Seeking Oscar Tickets: 
"People's Court" Judge Joseph Wapner, who last week was in search of a ticket 
to the Academy Awards, has decided to just stay home and watch. He had wanted 
to attend the festivities because of Dustin Hoffman's repeated references to 
him in the much-nominated film "Rain Man," and a Warner Bros. rep even went so 
far as to try and get him booked onto the show. That plea was over-ruled by 
Oscar show producer Allan Carr. Now, it turns out, Wapner will be taping his 
own show on Wednesday, then will spend the evening in front of the TV like 
millions of others to watch the Oscar outcome. ALEENE MacMINN

SOUND BETTER THAN SIGHT IN MET'S DUSTY 'ONEGIN'

<TEXT>
<P>
"Yevgeny Onegin" as staged these days at the Metropolitan Opera isn't exactly a 
triumph of modern musical theater. 
</P>
<P>
The semi-whimsical sets of Rolf Gerard looked quaintly tacky when they were 
new, and that was in 1957. The costumes of Ray Diffen resemble afterthoughts, 
which they are. Under the dubious circumstances, one can hardly blame the 
latest stage director on duty, Bodo Igesz, for concentrating on safe and 
familiar traffic maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, Tchaikovsky's intimate setting of the Pushkin verse novel can triumph 
over a dusty production if it happens to be acted with conviction, sung with 
fervor and, perhaps most important, conducted with a sense of brooding passion. 
In these crucial respects, the forces at Lincoln Center performed nobly on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the primary hero of the afternoon hadn't even been scheduled to be 
there. If all had gone as planned, the man in the pit would have been Andrew 
Litton. The operatic neophyte was felled by appendicitis, however, at the first 
performance. Subsequently, his baton has been taken up by none less than the 
illustrious artistic director of the company, James Levine. 
</P>
<P>
Even though he had presided over an exhausting and exhaustive "Walkure" just a 
few hours earlier, Levine brought freshness, urgency and lyrical expansion to 
his inherited duties. It had been rumored that he agreed to serve as substitute 
maestro as a special favor for -- or tribute to -- his celebrated Tatiana, 
Mirella Freni. 
</P>
<P>
The tender orchestral bouquets he laid at her feet lent credence to the rumors. 
Levine breathed in unison with the soprano. He adjusted tempos liberally yet 
sensibly to accommodate every nuance in her particularly poignant Letter Scene. 
He gave her the sensitive support she deserved as she floated shimmering arcs 
of pianissimo tone in the final scene. This, indeed, was artistic 
communication, and collaboration, of a high order. 
</P>
<P>
As she already proved in San Francisco, Freni is an extraordinarily 
sympathetic, pensive yet impetuous, ultimately noble Tatiana. Not incidentally, 
she manages to create a staggering illusion of girlish innocence at the decent 
age of 54. 
</P>
<P>
On this occasion one could notice that a few climactic outbursts escaped ideal 
focus. Also, if measured by the most authentic Bolshoi standards, Freni's 
Tatiana remains rather Italianate. In this musico-dramatic context, it really 
didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
Jorma Hynninen, who happens to serve as general manager of the Finnish National 
Opera, complemented her as an Onegin of fierce elegance, muted ardor and, where 
appropriate, bel-canto finesse. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Hadley brought comparable delicacy and pathos to the painful reveries of 
Lensky. Michel Senechal offered a small tenoral revelation of his own by 
imbuing the serenade of old Monsieur Triquet with poetry rather than the usual 
buffo distortions. 
</P>
<P>
The lower voices proved less impressive. Hans Sotin made a rather bumpy ride of 
Prince Gremin's marvelous aria, the final descending phrase evaporating short 
of its intended destination. Sandra Walker seemed properly giddy in manner but 
somewhat lightweight in sound as Olga. Conversely, Gweneth Bean overpowered the 
grandmotherly mutterings of the nurse with an orotund contralto worthy of our 
friend Erda. Ariel Bybee reduced Mme. Larina to a pallid sketch. 
</P>
<P>
The functional but stilted and awkwardly integrated dance episodes were 
overseen by Norbert Vesak. Perhaps he ought to put in some time studying the 
anthological models of "Jerome Robbins' Broadway" at the Imperial Theatre.

LARRY GALES MAKES THE CONNECTION AT MARLA'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. JAMES LISKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bassist Larry Gales, a hard-working mainstream player for more than 30 of his 
53 years, presented his seven-man East-West Music Connection at Marla's Memory 
Lane on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The New York-born Gales, whose work has been featured with such musicians as 
J.C. Heard, Herbie Mann and Thelonious Monk, has been a mainstay of the local 
jazz scene since moving to Los Angeles in 1969. During the last 20 years, he 
has worked with such players as Errol Garner, Harold Land, Bill Berry and Benny 
Carter. 
</P>
<P>
All that diverse experience was on display during his opening set Saturday 
evening as he showed himself a capable player, at home with a ballad as he is 
with the tune from the demanding Monk repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
"Bye Bye Blues," a familiar old song whose three-note melodic theme uses up 
four bars, was instilled with a rhythmic excitement by Gales and drummer Paul 
Humphries. A three-man front line of trumpeter Oscar Brashear, 
tenor-saxophonist Herman Riley and trombonist Thurman Green, stated the melody 
in harmonized whole notes before each launched into bright solo moments. 
</P>
<P>
That basic format was used throughout the set, with the exception of Miles 
Davis' "So What," worked splendidly by the trio of Gales, Humphries and pianist 
Lanny Hartley, and "What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life," a ballad 
showcased for the richly toned trombone of Green. 
</P>
<P>
Though Gales soloed admirably on several occasions, and sang from the heart on 
his own composition, "Peach Melba," he was throughout the set what a good 
bassist should be: a rock-steady accompanist who propels the music and provides 
the basis of harmonic structure. Nowhere in the set was he better in that role 
than on Monk's "Straight, No Chaser," a tune that also provided the best 
vehicle for Brashear's soaring trumpet and Riley's pensive work on the soprano 
saxophone.A. JAMES LISKA

JONATHAN BUTLER DID IT -- A STAR IN THE MAKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most amazing thing about singer-guitarist Jonathan Butler is that he isn't 
better known. With two Grammy nominations and a gold record under his belt, he 
would seem ripe for major stardom. But it still hasn't happened. 
</P>
<P>
The South African-born performer's appearance at the Pantages on Friday night 
underscored the fact that a good portion of the music audience is missing an 
opportunity to see a star in the making. Roving the stage with the dynamic 
energy of a young James Brown, ripping off guitar licks with the creative 
ingenuity of a George Benson, singing with the style and communication of an Al 
Jarreau, Butler gave a performance that was just about as good as a pop music 
concert can get. 
</P>
<P>
Add to the fact that he wrote most of the material he sang, and the picture of 
an artist destined for much, much bigger things came clearly into focus. 
</P>
<P>
Butler opened his set with an instrumental in which his left-handed guitar 
chording exploded with bristling, brasslike clusters. Shifting to single-note 
lines, he spun out a sequence of disjunct melodies (blended, occasionally, with 
vocal scatting) that took persistently startling twists and turns. 
</P>
<P>
His singing was as good as his playing. On "I'm a Sucker for You" (from his new 
album) and "Lies" (a Grammy nomination in 1988), Butler told his stories of 
capricious desire in rhythmic bursts of high-voltage energy. Softer ballads -- 
"True Love Never Fails" and "More Than Friends" (his current single) -- were 
treated gentler and more sweetly, but without ever losing the undercurrent of 
performing passion that is intrinsic to Butler's singing. 
</P>
<P>
Angela Bofill, opening the program, sounded a bit more subdued than usual. 
Halfway through "Down the Line," however, she broke out in a soaring vocal 
improvisation that recalled how good she can be when she is at her best. 
</P>
<P>
Saxophonist Najee, also on the bill, displayed characteristically broad strokes 
of bright musical colors, but his finest moments came during a beautifully 
basic chorus on the standard "When Sunny Gets Blue."DON HECKMAN

TURTLE ISLAND STRING QUARTET DISPLAYS ECLECTIC INGENUITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Turtle Island String Quartet made a rare local appearance Saturday at the 
Valley Cities Jewish Community Center in Sherman Oaks. (The quartet will return 
Sunday for a free concert at the Wadsworth Theater.) 
</P>
<P>
It is hard to conceive of a musical area in which these totally gifted 
performers would not be at ease. Their eclecticism took them through a program 
in which composition, arrangements and improvisation were interwoven with 
uncanny ingenuity. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other similarly constituted groups, they all have the ability, both in 
ensembles and ad-lib solos, to convey a true feeling for the nature of jazz. 
Violinist David Balakrishnan's inspired arrangement of "Night in Tunisia" 
established their sensitivity in this idiom. Darol Anger, also an accomplished 
jazz violinist, composed "Grant Wood," displaying the quartet's adaptability to 
Nashville roots. There was even a touch of New Age in their salute to Ralph 
Towner of the group Roegon. 
</P>
<P>
With the cellist Mark Summer usually plucking the strings like a jazz bassist, 
the quartet often achieved a swinging intensity normally beyond the reach of a 
string group. Except for one number that used a prerecorded percussion part, 
there was no rhythm section in the conventional sense, yet there was an innate 
rhythmic essence to "Stolen Moments," the funky "Street Stuff" and violist 
Irene Sazer's arrangement of "The Sidewinder," a 24-bar blues in which Mark 
Summer played arco and pizzicato solos while the others offered riffing 
support. 
</P>
<P>
Sazer must be the world's foremost jazz viola player (admittedly this is not a 
crowded field). Her unaccompanied interlude on "Sunny August Full of Moon" was 
hypnotic, as was her every solo. 
</P>
<P>
Is the Turtle Island String Quartet too subtle to make its mark in a 
noise-oriented society? One can only hope that time, and a few intelligent 
promoters, will accord the foursome the worldwide exposure it deserves. LEONARD

Officials of Contra Costa County, one of the wealthiest in the state, are 
trying to persuade their affluent cities to contribute funds for temporary 
homeless shelters. The officials are also fighting to keep National Guard 
armories open until they can find temporary shelter for more than 650 people 
who live on the county's streets. "We didn't have this uncaring attitude during 
the Depression," said Larry Organ, an aide to county Supervisor Tom Powers. 
"People brought people in need into their homes. Now they wander the street 
while we're in the most expansive economic period in our history since World 
War II." Powers and Richmond Mayor George Livingston led a rally at a local 
armory to convince the governor and county residents that homelessness is 
everyone's problem.

NATION'S BOOKSELLERS BATTLE BACK IN FACE OF THREATS, FIREBOMBINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just inside Cody's Books in Berkeley stands a charred rack of shelves, filled 
with blackened books that no one will ever read. Owner Andy Ross has decided to 
keep it there, a stark reminder of the morning that a Molotov cocktail was 
hurled through the window, setting the bookstore on fire. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people want to leave it for time immemorial," the shop owner said, nearly 
a month after the pre-dawn incident. "They want to shellac it and leave it, 
like a museum piece." 
</P>
<P>
The bombing of Cody's sent new waves of concern into a book industry already 
beset by threats and protests over Salman Rushdie's novel, "The Satanic 
Verses," the work that provoked death threats for its alleged blaspheming of 
the Muslim religion. In the days before and after the bombing, the industry in 
America seemed under siege: Already, the nation's two largest bookstore chains 
had briefly pulled the novel from their shelves. Bombings similar to the one at 
Cody's occurred at another bookstore in Berkeley and at a New York-based 
newspaper that had praised the book. Pundits predicted a long-term chilling 
effect in the book market for other works that might stir controversy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Show of Unity 
</P>
<P>
Yet already there are signs -- like the memorial at Cody's -- that the industry 
will carry on as always. With an unusual show of unity, members of the 
bookselling industry have battled back against the threats of violence and 
censorship. Publishers, writers and booksellers -- who vowed soon after the 
bombing to take a stand in support of Rushdie -- are generally following 
through on that promise now that the novel is becoming widely available. 
</P>
<P>
With sales booming, "The Satanic Verses" reached No. 1 last week on the Los 
Angeles Times best-seller list and is expected to hit the top this week on the 
New York Times list. At the same time, bookstores and libraries in Los Angeles 
and San Diego are at last filling their shelves as overdue shipments have begun 
to pour in. Most stores, including the two that were bombed in Berkeley, are 
eagerly pressing ahead with sales while remaining on guard against further 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
"From the very beginning, everyone's feeling here was that we wanted to carry 
and display the book," said Steven Root, assistant manager of Waldenbooks in 
Berkeley, which was firebombed on the same morning that Cody's was hit. 
</P>
<P>
The Waldenbooks outlet, which was only slightly damaged, had been trying vainly 
to acquire copies of the novel ever since the firebombing, and the late 
shipments finally arrived last week. The store filled about 75 back orders and 
put an 20 additional copies on display. The $19.95 book is being discounted to 
$16 at the small shop and is being handled much like any other new release, 
Root said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Security Measures 
</P>
<P>
However, the store has hired a security guard in the wake of the bombing and is 
cautiously keeping the novel out of its window display. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided we weren't going to do anything to flaunt it," Root said of the 
book. "We don't want to provoke or inflame anyone's feelings or sensitivities 
about it. We certainly don't want to put a poster in the window saying, 'Break 
Me.' " 
</P>
<P>
At Waldenbooks stores in San Diego, most employees would not comment on the 
book's sales, but, similar to the Berkeley store, Waldenbooks in Fashion Valley 
is not flaunting the book in its window. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot behind the counter, but we don't have them in the window . . . 
," said Kathleen Shumate, assistant manager of the store. "My manager is 
willing to have the book out (on display)," but not in the window, she said. 
"Another Waldenbooks store put it in their window and the mall asked them to 
remove it." 
</P>
<P>
The store, which has had the book in stock only for the past week, has sold 
about 50 copies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Poll of Employees 
</P>
<P>
At Cody's, the 55 employees took a poll before deciding to go ahead with sales, 
keenly aware of the questions of free speech and personal safety. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Crown Books in San Diego also were interested in what their 
employees had to say. The assistant manager of Crown Books on Rosecrans Avenue, 
who would identify himself only as Alan, said that Crown Books' executives sent 
a letter to employees asking if they had objections to selling the book. 
</P>
<P>
The seven employees of his store had no objections, and Alan said that although 
the company's gesture was "thoughtful," he admitted he had some trepidation. "I 
couldn't say for the manager, but if the store was threatened, I'd think twice 
about having it here, yes. But we (employees) signed an agreement that would 
allow the sale to go on. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to have the book behind the counter, and you had to come in and ask 
for it. Now it's out on display, in plain view in back of the store with our 
other best sellers," he said. "But it's not in the window. We don't want 
someone to throw a bomb through the window while we're gone." 
</P>
<P>
Sales are still high for the book, noting that the store has sold about 100 
copies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'True to Principles' 
</P>
<P>
Like its Berkeley rival, Cody's is proceeding gingerly. The store has hired 
additional security guards and closed one of its two entrances as precautionary 
measures. No longer does it display a wall poster vowing to defy Rushdie's 
critics, as it once did. 
</P>
<P>
"We've come to the point where you put your life on the line in order to carry 
a book," said one company spokesman, who asked not to be identified. "We are 
being true to our principles, and I think most booksellers are. When the story 
is told, I think booksellers are going to be the heroes in this thing." 
</P>
<P>
Concern over how the book would be handled has been prevalent since 
mid-February, when Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini denounced "The Satanic 
Verses" as blasphemous to the Islamic faith and called for the death of Rushdie 
and "others" associated with the novel. 
</P>
<P>
The reaction of the nation's two largest bookstore chains -- B. Dalton and 
Waldenbooks -- was to immediately pull the book from the shelves out of fear 
for the safety of employees. Days later, under pressure from employees and 
writers' groups, the chains reversed their stance and allowed the book to be 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
Then, however, on Feb. 28, came the Berkeley store bombings. A firebomb ignited 
the same day also gutted the offices of Riverdale Press, a New York-based 
weekly newspaper that had written an editorial in support of Rushdie. Cody's in 
Berkeley had widely advertised the novel in the days just before the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worry About Future Books 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in any of the three incidents, but writers' groups quickly 
forecast a long-term chilling effect, particularly for books, like Rushdie's, 
that might address Islamic themes. Joanne Leedom-Ackerman, president of PEN 
Center USA West, a 500-member writers' organization based in Los Angeles, 
predicted that influence would affect writers, publishers and booksellers 
alike. 
</P>
<P>
"How ready might the next publisher be to publish a book that might offend a 
Muslim group?" she asked. "We've seen historically that . . . when there is 
risk, people do what they can to hedge themselves." 
</P>
<P>
But the book industry responded almost at once. 
</P>
<P>
Writers, publishers and sellers vowed to keep the book available to the public. 
Rushdie's publishing house, Viking Penguin of New York, quickly sold out its 
first run of 50,000 copies and made plans for additional printings. A two-week 
delay in gaining press time was responsible for a widespread shortage of "The 
Satanic Verses" earlier this month, according to a Viking spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
But since then, the publishing house has been printing to keep up with demand, 
the spokesman said. Although the company will not disclose how many additional 
copies are being printed, Viking has carried on despite a wave of threats 
against the publishing house. The company's New York offices have been 
evacuated 12 times since December because of bomb threats motivated by the 
book, said the spokesman, who asked not to be named for fear of his own safety. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the threats have come since mid-February, when Khomeini issued his 
death decree. 
</P>
<P>
"After a while, you get tired of leaving the building," the spokesman 
commented. "But you don't want to stay there and have that be the one time 
there is a bomb." 
</P>
<P>
The evacuations forced the hiring of additional security guards and required 
the close protection of high-ranking executives, the spokesman added. Mail had 
to be closely watched and checked for explosives. 
</P>
<P>
By one estimate, the firm so far has received 100,000 letters of protest from 
Muslims, more than a few of which have contained threats, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"In all likelihood, we won't make any money off the book if one factors in the 
tremendous amount of money we've had to spend . . . on security," he said. "Our 
top priorities have been keeping the book in print and making sure nobody gets 
hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Although most San Diego bookstores did not receive any threats, some, like 
Crown Books and Waldenbooks, have retained security companies that their 
employees can call if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
But, as Conrad Jansen, acting manager for Crown Books on El Cajon Boulevard, 
said, "We're here to sell books. I know I wouldn't pull the book, but I'm just 
acting manager right now. If it came down to it right now, I wouldn't pull it, 
but I'm not going to hold my breath. If someone tells me to do it, I'll do it." 
</P>
<P>
Sally Goodell, owner of the The Book Nook in El Centro, said that even if she 
had gotten threats and wanted to pull the book, "I would have been forced to 
leave it on the shelf. You have to take a stand someplace. You may be afraid, 
but it would just be something we'd have to do," she said. "It's necessary and 
it's important to let people know that we sell it." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, perhaps the most defiant stance was taken by Book Soup, on 
Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood. Owner Glenn Goldman published a newspaper 
ad prior to the Berkeley bombings, saying: "Book Soup supports freedom of 
expression and the public's right to read whatever it chooses. We will not bow 
to pressure from any quarter." 
</P>
<P>
The bombings did not change Goldman's position. Afterward, his store was 
selling a waist-high stack of the books. 
</P>

PRISTINA, Yugoslavia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two police officials and a demonstrator were shot and killed Monday as the 
worst violence Yugoslavia has seen in eight years swept through the southern 
province of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth straight day of rioting by ethnic Albanians who object to 
government moves to curb the province's autonomy. They stoned police and 
property in at least nine towns, including the area's capital, Pristina, 150 
miles south of Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo Interior Ministry banned walking in groups of more than three people 
and shut schools, the university, cinemas, theaters and markets. 
</P>
<P>
A total ban on movement will be imposed in certain places at certain times, it 
said without elaborating. Yugoslav radio reported that the national government 
has ordered a curfew. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators opened fire in the town of Podujevo, 12 miles north of Pristina, 
killing local Police Chief Jetulah Kuchi, 39, an ethnic Albanian, and wounding 
a second policeman, a police technician and two civilians. 
</P>
<P>
Another police officer and a demonstrator were shot to death in riots at the 
nearby mining town of Titova Mitrovica. 
</P>
<P>
In the suburbs of Pristina, police opened fire with automatic weapons to warn 
off rioters as helicopters dropped tear gas. 
</P>
<P>
Some rioters in Pristina charged police with a bulldozer. 
</P>
<P>
Tear gas swirled in the streets as rocks and other objects rained down from all 
directions on helmeted police in many towns. Buses, cars and shop windows were 
stoned. 
</P>
<P>
It was the worst violence since ethnic Albanian riots in 1981, when at least 
nine people died and hundreds were injured in a monthlong rampage. 
</P>
<P>
The disturbances were triggered last Thursday when Kosovo's Parliament adopted 
constitutional changes giving Serbia -- the largest of six Yugoslav republics 
-- control of Kosovo's police, courts, civil defense and official appointments. 
</P>
<P>
Serbia, of which Kosovo is an part, will also have a free hand to reduce the 
province's autonomy further.

STORE OWNERS, HUMANE SOCIETY DISGUSTED OVER RETURN OF UNWANTED EASTER PETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the San Diego Humane Society calls it "a big problem." 
</P>
<P>
A local pet shop owner calls it "a near-epidemic." 
</P>
<P>
Every year around this time -- to be precise, the day after Easter -- parents 
who purchased bunnies, baby chicks and ducks as presents commemorative of the 
holiday, start returning them. 
</P>
<P>
"Families come in and buy a bunny for their child, and then, the day after 
Easter they say, 'My God, we've got a pet -- we don't want a pet!' " said Zlona 
Swarts, a saleswoman at Point Loma Pet Shop, which stopped selling rabbits, 
chickens and ducks three years ago because of the wave of post-Easter returns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Novelty Wears Off' 
</P>
<P>
Animal House Pet Shop in Normal Heights continues to sell them, and, by early 
Monday afternoon, Janice Mullen, co-owner of the shop, had taken back two 
bunnies and fielded "quite a few" phone calls about other returns. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost like we're the test station," Mullen said angrily. "They test them 
and bring them back. They buy them for the novelty, and, the day after Easter, 
the novelty wears off. The excuse they always give is allergies. They say the 
rabbit gave them allergies. But, before Easter, there was no problem with 
allergies. So every year we go through this near-epidemic of bunnies bouncing 
back to the shop." 
</P>
<P>
Mullen said she refuses to grant a refund. Instead, she gives only a store 
credit. Rabbits at her shop sold for $19.99 apiece this year. All that's 
required to care for them, she said, is a cage, rabbit pellets for food and 
bedding. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, "a little TLC (tender loving care) that we hope extends beyond 
Easter," she added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Holiday Adoption Ban 
</P>
<P>
"This rabbit return business isn't off the wall at all," said Lani Kian, a 
spokeswoman for the San Diego Humane Society and Society for the Prevention of 
Cruelty to Animals (SPCA). "We're very concerned about the situation, so every 
year now we prohibit the adoption of rabbits, guinea pigs and chicks and ducks 
two weeks before Easter and about a week after. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided not to adopt out any of those animals this year from March 12 until 
April 12 for that reason -- the reason of return. People adopt these animals 
impulsively, without concern for the pet's welfare. Once the holiday is gone, 
the thrill is gone. And often, the animals are brought back in a neglected 
state." 
</P>
<P>
Kian said that potential buyers should remember that rabbits, like any animal, 
need more than just food. 
</P>
<P>
"They should ask themselves if they intend to own this animal for the rest of 
its life," she added. "If they can't make that commitment -- and many shop 
owners are beginning to ask them that -- then they have no business owning the 
animal. A new pet needs consistency and regularity, and many of these people 
don't give them that. 
</P>
<P>
"They give them nothing but trauma. Kids 'ooh' and 'ahh' at them until the day 
is over, and then they don't want them. Rabbits need a consistency of people 
and routines, and proper feeding, for a long, long time." A well-cared-for 
rabbit can live up to eight years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Same Problem at Christmas 
</P>
<P>
Kian said the same scenario occurs around Christmas, with puppies and kittens 
the victims. She said pet shops contribute to the problem by simply trying to 
make a sale. Many of the animals being returned then show up on the doorstep of 
the Humane Society. 
</P>
<P>
Several pet shops contacted said they quit selling rabbits, chicks and ducks 
because of returns or because of buyers being irate when shops refuse to accept 
the returns. 
</P>
<P>
"We stopped carrying those animals five years ago," said Carol Regis, owner of 
Mission Hills Pet House. "The purchase of animals like these, as symbols of a 
holiday, has to be thought out, and, in so many cases, it just wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
"The rate of chicks and ducks coming back was phenomenal," said Judy Pippett, 
manager of Pet Kingdom in Loma Portal. "So, we don't carry them anymore. As far 
as bunnies go, we put up a huge sign saying, 'Please consider that you're 
getting a pet with this purchase -- not an Easter bunny.' That seems to turn a 
lot of people away at the cash register. We sold about 30 bunnies for Easter, 
and so far -- my fingers are crossed -- we haven't had any back. I think it's 
only because of the sign. It's been a huge problem at other stores." 
</P>
<P>
As Janice Mullen of the Animal House Pet Shop put it, "People who buy bunnies 
for their kids are like the ladies who buy velvet dresses to go to the big 
ball. Once the ball's over, and the event has come and gone, they return them. 
The fact that these animals are living creatures just doesn't matter to most 
people."

JUDGE RULES U.S. ENVOY CAN TESTIFY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

A federal judge ruled Monday that the U. S. ambassador to Mexico may testify as 
a witness in a complex drug case, and defense attorneys said they plan to call 
him to the stand Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. District Judge William B. Enright, who last month quashed a subpoena for 
the appearance of Ambassador Charles J. Pilliod, reversed his ruling Monday 
after reviewing State Department documents submitted by the defense. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys have asserted that Pilliod will cast doubt on prosecution 
claims that three of the seven men on trial were high-ranking Mexican 
government or military officials when they were arrested in an undercover sting 
operation last year. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors have fought to keep Pilliod off the witness stand, arguing 
that he has no first-hand knowledge of the investigation and little to offer as 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
However, Cynthia G. Aaron, an attorney for Jorge Carranza, who prosecutors say 
is a retired Mexican army colonel, argued Monday that a two-page Teletype 
message sent by Pilliod in January, 1988, to then-Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III 
indicates that all three Mexicans were less important than federal prosecutors 
claim. The message details Pilliod's discussions with Mexican government 
officials about the backgrounds of the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
The Teletype informed State Department officials that Carranza was discharged 
from the Mexican army as a major, not a colonel; that another defendant, Pablo 
Giron Ortiz, was not a high-ranking member of the Mexican Federal Judicial 
Police; and that a third defendant, Hector Manual Brumel Alvarez, had not 
served as a Mexican government official with ties to the country's ruling 
Institutional Revolutionary Party. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Nelson, the assistant U. S. attorney prosecuting the case, said Monday 
that Pilliod's statements last year were made shortly after the arrests and 
that his information was "third-hand" at best. "Before he's even briefed on the 
case he makes these gratuitous comments," Nelson said. "It was pretty rank 
hearsay. He would not have been informed or briefed on it. . . . He was kept 
out of the loop." 
</P>
<P>
Four Bolivian citizens also are charged in the case, which resulted from an 
undercover investigation by U. S. agents attempting to expose corruption among 
top Mexican officials. The investigation ended a year ago in the parking lot of 
a La Jolla supermarket, where Carranza was arrested while wearing the uniform 
of a Mexican army colonel. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron said Monday that it is her understanding that Pilliod "voluntarily" did a 
background check on the Mexicans by contacting Mexican authorities after 
reading press accounts that Carranza had been arrested wearing a Mexican 
military uniform. 
</P>
<P>
"He did this checking on his own because he became suspicious that Carranza was 
in uniform," she said. "That seemed bizarre to him. So he called and learned 
that Carranza was not on the military list." 
</P>
<P>
Aaron said she intends to question Pilliod "about his relationships with 
various branches of the Mexican government . . . and how he first learned about 
the indictment in this case." 
</P>
<P>
Pilliod's testimony also should demonstrate how easy it would have been for U. 
S. agents to determine that the defendants were not the powerful Mexican 
officials the agents had hoped to bring down, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It shows the shoddiness of their investigation," she said. "The agents wanted 
to believe it so bad they weren't willing to verify anything. And they still 
want to believe it." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson on Monday denied that the investigation was shoddy and said that, if 
Pilliod testifies, the prosecution will be forced to present rebuttal witnesses 
who will show the "absolute stonewalling of the Mexican government" on the 
case. "To this day, we have not received one bit of official information from 
the Mexican government," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron said she at first hoped to have Pilliod, who is in Mexico City, in the 
courtroom today, but, after discussing the situation with State Department 
officials, she now hopes to have Pilliod on the witness stand on Thursday.

1 ACCUSED OF KILLING MIGRANTS DENIES GUILT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
One of two San Diego men arrested last week and charged with the possible 
hate-crime slayings of two Mexican farm workers pleaded not guilty Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The two alleged killers were characterized as "aspiring Rambos" by A. David 
Stutz, the San Diego County deputy district attorney prosecuting the case. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been some indication that they were going out and ridding San Diego 
County of anyone with darker skin than theirs," Stutz said in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
The two victims were shot a number of times Nov. 9 with a South Korean-made 
semiautomatic assault weapon, said San Diego police, who said they recovered 
the weapon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reportedly Boasted of Crime 
</P>
<P>
After committing the killings, officials said, the two boasted about the crime 
to friends and acquaintances. However, San Diego Police Sgt. Frank Martinez 
said one of the two, Dennis Bencivenga, 19, of San Diego, who entered the 
not-guilty plea Monday, apparently felt remorse later and reported the incident 
to police, leading to the arrests last week. 
</P>
<P>
Police and the district attorney's office said there was no evidence that 
either man was affiliated with any white supremacy hate group, such as the 
Skinheads, who have been active in the San Diego area. 
</P>
<P>
Until Bencivenga came forward Jan. 13, police said, the investigation of the 
slayings had been stalled. In statements to police, Bencivenga said he did not 
at first think his friend, Kenneth Kovzelove, would actually follow through on 
threats to shoot and kill some "Mexicans," according to a police affidavit on 
file in San Diego Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Talked About Killing People' 
</P>
<P>
Bencivenga told police that he was behind the wheel of a pickup while 
Kovzelove, 17, fired the shots that killed the two migrants, according to the 
affidavit. Kovzelove, who pulled his shirt over his face as he committed the 
crime, fired from the bed of the pickup, the document states. 
</P>
<P>
"Kovzelove had talked about killing people before, but Bencivenga thought it 
was just because he was going into the Army," stated the affidavit, which is 
signed by police Officer P. A. Ruffner. 
</P>
<P>
The two had driven to the site after Kovzelove had talked about robbing some 
"Mexicans" in the area, according to the affidavit. Bencivenga said he was 
going to ask his companion for a loan if he managed to obtain some money, 
according to the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
The two victims, who died at the scene, were found with more than $300 in their 
possession, according to the deputy district attorney. The suspects drove off 
shortly after the killings when they noticed other vehicles approaching, 
Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unclear if they intended to kill and then rob," said Stutz, the deputy 
district attorney. "All that's clear is that they killed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arrested in Georgia 
</P>
<P>
Kovzelove, who is being held in lieu of $100,000 bail, was arrested Thursday at 
Ft. Benning, Ga., where he was in training as an Army paratrooper. He was 
scheduled to be arraigned today in Juvenile Court in San Diego. Prosecutors 
intend to seek court permission to try Kovzelove as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
"If he's old enough to fight for his country, he can be tried in adult court," 
Stutz said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Stutz said that, because Kovzelove is a minor, prosecutors are 
prevented by state law from using a "special circumstances" sentencing 
argument, which is necessary for a death penalty. It is also unlikely that the 
death penalty will be sought for Bencivenga, said the prosecutor, who noted 
that the older suspect helped break the case by coming forward. 
</P>
<P>
Bencivenga, who is being held on $250,000 bail, entered his not-guilty plea 
before San Diego Municipal Court Judge Patricia A. Y. Cowett. 
</P>
<P>
The two victims -- Hilario Casteneda Salgado, 22, and Matilde Macedo de la 
Sancha, 19 -- were killed along an isolated stretch of Black Mountain Road in a 
rural area near San Diego's northern city limits. They were shot a total of 11 
times, according to police. Both were legal residents of the United States, 
possibly having qualified for legal residence under the farm-worker amnesty 
program, according to Stutz. Both are believed to have lived in migrant camps 
near the slaying site, police said.

STAFF SHARPLY CUT AT SPANISH PAPER; CLOSING IS FEARED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE BECKLUND, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Noticias del Mundo, a Spanish-language daily newspaper opened in Los Angeles 
five years ago by a conglomerate associated with cult figure Rev. Sun Myung 
Moon, has laid off one-third of its staff, raising concern among employees that 
it may close. 
</P>
<P>
The layoffs of 20 people are the result of "very reduced operating subsidies" 
by News World Communications, a subsidiary of Moon's Unification Church 
International, according to a statement in Monday's edition by New York-based 
publisher Phillip V. Sanchez. An official in Los Angeles, sales manager Amparo 
Gonzalez, said there are no plans to close the paper. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Local, Foreign Mix 
</P>
<P>
The five-day-a-week newspaper, one of three Spanish-language dailies in Los 
Angeles, combines substantial local coverage with foreign coverage that 
reflects the conservative politics of Moon's Unification Church. 
</P>
<P>
The cutbacks affected all departments. The staff of local reporters has been 
reduced from about half a dozen to two, one of them part time, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Two sources close to the paper estimated Monday that News World has spent $10 
to $15 million on the Los Angeles paper since it opened. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the church is tired of financially supporting the newspaper project 
they had originally planned," said Rafael Prieto, former editor of the Los 
Angeles edition. "It looks as though they are closing down the paper, step by 
step." 
</P>
<P>
Columnist Octavio Costa, 74, a journalistic institution in Spanish-language 
media here, was one of those laid off. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me you know we have instructions to reduce to the very minimum the 
cost of the paper," he said. "The truth is the paper never paid for itself. As 
for circulation, I don't think they were even printing 10,000 papers. The 
public didn't want to read Noticias del Mundo." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez asserted the paper has a paid circulation of 25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Only two reporters will remain on the staff, Gonzalez said. One will work half 
time. "Those of us who are left will work extra hard to make sure the quality 
of the paper doesn't suffer," she said. "We are restructuring the paper, not 
closing it." 
</P>
<P>
When the Los Angeles edition opened five years ago, a News World official 
described it as "just the first step to a national newspaper in Spanish . . . a 
la USA Today." 
</P>
<P>
News World opened offices in other cities, but then closed them. Sanchez said 
in his statement Monday that the cutbacks will affect Noticias del Mundo 
operations across the country. He said offices will be reopened in San 
Francisco and New Jersey.

9-MONTH FETUS SLAIN, WOMAN MISCARRIES IN SEPARATE CASES; 2 HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY MILLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Pomona men were in jail on suspicion of murder Monday in unrelated cases 
after an apparently accidental shooting resulted in the death of a near-term 
fetus in one case and a domestic fight ended in a miscarriage by a woman who 
was three months pregnant in the other. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Coleman, 19, was arrested Sunday night after he allegedly shot and 
seriously wounded a 16-year-old girl, Lillian Kelley, who was nine months 
pregnant, police said. 
</P>
<P>
In the second case, police arrested Armando Cisneros, 39, on Saturday after he 
allegedly knocked to the ground the woman with whom he lives and she suffered a 
miscarriage. 
</P>
<P>
Both men were held without bail on suspicion of murder, pending their 
arraignments today in Pomona. Police said they believe it was likely that the 
charges against Cisneros would be reduced, because murder charges can be filed 
only if it is determined that the fetus would have been capable of surviving 
outside the womb. 
</P>
<P>
In the incident involving Coleman, Kelley's near-term fetus was killed when a 
slug from a .38-caliber revolver pierced her abdomen as she sat in a Pomona 
apartment that she was visiting, Pomona Police Detective Ed McLean said. Kelley 
was listed in serious condition at Pomona Valley Community Hospital Monday, a 
hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred after Yamil Henderson of Pomona, who was also visiting 
the apartment, took out the revolver and began playing with it, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was cocking the gun, pointing it around, pointing it at himself," Pomona 
Police Lt. Chuck Heilman said. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman, who lived in the apartment, apparently was trying to take the gun away 
from the man when it went off, McLean said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Be Accident 
</P>
<P>
"It conceivably could just be an accident -- an unfortunate accident," Heilman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The father of Kelley's unborn child was present at the time but was not 
involved in the incident, he said. No charges were filed against Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taken to Hospital 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested Cisneros on suspicion of felonious assault after he allegedly 
knocked down his girlfriend, Maria Barrios, 32, during a fight at their Pomona 
apartment. Barrios, who was three months pregnant, complained of abdominal 
pains after the incident and was taken to Pomona Valley Community Hospital, 
where she miscarried, Heilman said. 
</P>
<P>
Barrios was discharged from the hospital Sunday, a spokeswoman said. After the 
miscarriage, police filed a murder complaint against Cisneros, Heilman said. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office had not decided Monday whether to file murder 
charges against either man. Heilman, noting that the district attorney may not 
find that Barrios' fetus was capable of surviving outside the womb, said he 
doubted that Cisneros would be charged with murder. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe, based on experience, what will happen is that felonious assault 
charges will be filed, not murder," he said.

BOYS FOUND ABANDONED IN DEL MAR HOTEL; 
</P>
<P>
MOTHER, BOYFRIEND SOUGHT IN ABUSE OF TWINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY BEAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego County sheriff's detectives were seeking a mother and her Phoenix 
boyfriend Monday for questioning in connection with the abandonment, abuse and 
molestation of twin 2-year-old boys found Saturday in a Del Mar hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The boyfriend, Charles Thomas McCoy, 27, whose last known address is in 
Phoenix, was identified by one of the twins and two employees of the hotel who 
viewed a photo lineup Monday, said Mary Stables, detective in the sheriff's 
child abuse unit. 
</P>
<P>
The twins, who were found Saturday night by employees at the Del Mar Inn, were 
in Children's Hospital recovering from their injuries, including bruises that 
were 4 to 5 days old, Stables said. Stables described the injuries as "deep 
bruises from hand imprints on their faces like they were shoved, cuts on their 
necks and cigarette burns on their stomachs and sides." Both boys had been 
sexually abused, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The boys had refused to give investigators their names, making the case 
difficult to work, Stables said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mother Also Wanted for Questioning 
</P>
<P>
"The children are not talking about how they were hurt," Stables said. She 
added that the mother, who has yet to be located, is also wanted for 
questioning. 
</P>
<P>
Stables said the mother called the hospital Monday afternoon, told a hospital 
employee she wanted to see her children, but did not appear after saying she 
would, Stables said. 
</P>
<P>
Stables said it was not known whether the mother was at the hotel Saturday or 
if she could be linked to the abuse of the twins. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know if she had a hand in it," Stables said. "That's why we need to 
talk to her. Hopefully, she'll come forward and talk to us." 
</P>
<P>
McCoy, who is an unemployed tile setter, listed a Phoenix address as of March 
14, according to California Department of Motor Vehicles records. From 
November, 1987, until then, he listed a Genine Drive address in Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
McCoy Previously Arrested 
</P>
<P>
McCoy has been arrested before, but not in connection with child abuse, Stables 
said. She declined to say what he had been arrested for, or whether he had been 
convicted of any crimes. 
</P>
<P>
The first break in the case came when sheriff's detectives were able to 
identify the twins. Detectives received a phone tip Monday afternoon from a 
friend of the twins' baby sitter, who gave them information leading to McCoy 
and the identities of the boys and their mother, Stables said. The call was one 
of many that poured in after photos of the boys were broadcast on local 
television news programs. 
</P>
<P>
After detectives determined McCoy's identity, his photo was shown to both boys 
and one of them pointed to it and said McCoy had hurt them, Stables said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Stables, the boy used McCoy's middle name, saying: "Tommy hurt me. 
That's Tommy." 
</P>
<P>
The twins, who are expected to stay in the hospital for at least three more 
days until they can be placed in an emergency foster home, were recovering and 
starting to eat and drink, said hospital spokesman Mark Morelli. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been getting great support with money and clothing coming in," Morelli 
said.

OGDEN INCINERATOR WATCHED CLOSELY AS TOXIC TEST BURN BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Free of regulatory and legal obstacles, Ogden Environmental Services on Monday 
began firing up its controversial incinerator atop Torrey Pines Mesa for a 
long-awaited test burn of hazardous waste, scheduled to begin early today. 
</P>
<P>
The test, which will be conducted under the watchful eyes of federal and county 
regulators or their proxies during parts of the next four days, was to start 
when the incinerator reached the optimum temperature of 1,700 degrees 
Fahrenheit. Ogden officials said that could be as early as 2 a.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes according to 
</P>
<P>
Ogden's plans, workers will begin the burn by introducing a mixture of clean 
sand and contaminated soil from the McColl waste dump in Fullerton into the 
incinerator, where hazardous wastes are to be 99.99% destroyed in a swirling 
dust storm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ash Settles to Bottom 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-two compounds, including 18 suspected carcinogens, are the targets of 
the process. After they are burned, gases will be cooled to about 200 degrees, 
cleaned and released into the atmosphere; ash will settle to the bottom of the 
chamber and will be removed. The procedure will be repeated during the next 
four days until the equivalent of 30 drums of waste is consumed. 
</P>
<P>
The test is the first step toward Ogden's goal of winning an approximately 
$120-million federal Superfund contract to clean up 150,000 tons of sludges and 
oils at the McColl dump. The federal Environmental Protection Agency has 
determined that incineration is the preferred method of doing that, but Ogden 
faces competition from other firms vying for the contract, John Blevins, McColl 
project manager for the EPA, told reporters at a briefing held by Ogden. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA will pay three private contractors $560,000 to monitor the gases and 
ash, maintain the sampling equipment and prepare a report that is due out in 
about six weeks. Also on hand will be representatives from the county Air 
Pollution Control District. 
</P>
<P>
"We wouldn't be conducting this if our own technical evaluation of the test 
left any doubt in our minds" about safety, said Joe McSorley, the project 
manager of the EPA's Superfund Innovative Technology Evaluation project. The 
EPA is encouraging the development of innovative technology for disposal of 
hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
County Air Pollution Control Officer R. J. Sommerville said his office will 
monitor the test burn "very closely" and is prepared to halt it if there is an 
unexpected release of toxic gases into the air. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Programmed to Shut Down 
</P>
<P>
Sommerville said that is highly unlikely because the incinerator's computer is 
programmed to stop feeding material into the chamber if higher than expected 
amounts of toxic compounds are discovered by internal monitors. The incinerator 
is also programmed to shut down automatically if the situation worsens. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ogden has contingency plans that would be used in the event of a 
"catastrophe," executives believe there is a "tremendously remote chance of 
that happening," said Jack Allen, senior vice president for the firm. 
</P>
<P>
However, Director of Operations Robert G. Wilbourn acknowledged that, in a 1985 
test of the incinerator, a filter malfunctioned and dust circulating inside the 
incinerator was sprayed about the building housing the facility. No one was 
contaminated in that accident, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ogden and its predecessor, GA Technologies, have gone through years of 
regulatory review by the EPA, the state Department of Health Services and the 
county Air Pollution Control District to reach this moment. Ogden also won a 
lengthy legal battle with the city of San Diego, which sought to block the test 
burn, and has been the target of critics opposed to burning the waste in a 
populated section of La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at three nearby hospitals and UC San Diego reported that they are 
taking no extra precautions during the test burn. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't really felt it was necessary," said Marty Malter, director of 
environmental health and safety at UCSD, where students are off for the week 
but a child-care center near the Ogden facility is expected to be open. "Last 
year, when it was going through the permitting process, we reviewed it very 
carefully. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a gentleman's agreement with them that, if they release anything 
they're not expecting, they'll call us immediately," she added. "I personally 
feel very comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
Jim McIlraith, director of environmental health and safety at Scripps Clinic 
and Research Foundation, said the hospital has made no special plans for the 
week. "They're meeting the EPA requirements for effluent, and we're upwind from 
them," he said.

DEVELOPER'S WILL TO INCLUDE $5 MILLION FOR BURBANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sherman Whitmore, who battled Burbank residents and officials for eight years 
over development rights in the Verdugo Mountains, announced Monday that he 
intends to establish a trust that will grant the city at least $5 million when 
he dies. 
</P>
<P>
Whitmore, 55, said he wants the money to go to the city's schools, libraries 
and "helping the disenfranchised. I want this to help the city of Burbank." 
</P>
<P>
Whitmore met opposition from the community and the Burbank City Council when he 
tried to develop the more than 170 acres he owns in the Verdugo Mountains. The 
council approved development plans in December, 1987, but only after reducing 
the number of proposed homes on the property from 212 to 129. 
</P>
<P>
Whitmore denied that he is trying to win favor with city officials, whom he 
once called "unconscionable." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any more property or projects pending in Burbank," he said. 
"Nobody can say I'm doing this to feather my nest because it's already been 
feathered." 
</P>
<P>
The announcement caught many city officials by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first I've heard of it," Mayor Al F. Dossin said when told of the 
announcement. "He's a very young, healthy man. Depending on the details, I 
think it's a pretty nice gesture." 
</P>
<P>
Dossin said the grant is the first of its kind that he knows of in Burbank. He 
said other developers have donated money to charitable organizations in the 
city, but never to the city itself. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank City Manager Bud Ovrom said Whitmore had discussed the matter 
informally with some city officials, but the developer had not presented formal 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a lot of money for the city," Ovrom said. "But frankly, we wish him a 
long life and good health, and we don't see us getting any money from him in 
the foreseeable future." 
</P>
<P>
The money will be held in a "charitable remainder unitrust" worth from $10 
million to $12 million, at least half of which will go to Burbank, said 
Whitmore's accountant, Jeff Jones. Until his death, Whitmore will be entitled 
to 10% annually of the fair market value of the trust's assets, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Ovrom said he believes that Whitmore will draw substantial tax advantages from 
the trust. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure there are obvious consequences," he said. "And he has explained the 
tax consequences to me, but I don't remember the conversations well enough to 
explain how those work." 
</P>
<P>
Jones said the trust was submitted to the Internal Revenue Service for approval 
two months ago. He said he expects the fund to be approved in two months. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to cutting the number of homes that Whitmore could build in his 
Verdugo Mountains development, city officials in 1986 rejected his plans to put 
33 single-family homes on a 61-acre parcel in Craig Canyon. Whitmore later sold 
the land to the city for $1.1 million, half of which was paid for by the state. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for the Verdugo Mountains development were recently delayed after the 
federal Environmental Protection Agency announced that it wanted to review an 
environmental study of the land by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Burbank 
City Atty. Douglas C. Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
Holland said the review is to ensure that Whitmore will replace water sources, 
needed by wildlife, that will be removed during construction of the project.

A massive mudslide blocked the main road to Cedar Breaks National Monument, 
stripped off a section of pavement half a mile long and continued to ooze 
downhill Monday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The slide, roughly half a mile long and half a mile wide, broke loose sometime 
during the night and sent mud and boulders cascading across State Road 14, Kim 
Morris of the state Department of Transportation said. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported, Morris said, and visitors to the monument were able 
to take other roads out.

<P>
CHAMINADE HITTERS POUND LOYOLA WITH 17 HITS, 10-RUN 4TH INNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chaminade High tallied 17 hits -- nine during a 10-run fourth inning -- as the 
Eagles pounded Loyola, 13-5, Monday in the first round of the St. Paul high 
school baseball tournament in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Chaminade (4-6), which has collected 33 hits in the past two games, belted four 
doubles and a triple. But as powerful as the Eagles were, they failed to hit a 
home run in spacious Blair Field. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about 350 down the lines and 400 to center with a 15-foot fence," 
Chaminade Coach Steve Costley said. "(Justin) Stark would have had, maybe, 
three home runs in a regular-sized field." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Justin Stark settled for a double and three runs batted in while going 
three for five. Greg Baumgartner (2-2), who struck out five in five innings to 
earn the win, was two for five. Colin Havert was two for four with three RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Every Chaminade player collected at least two hits, except Jeff Burdick and 
Pete Miller, who each had one. 
</P>
<P>
In other first-round games: 
</P>
<P>
St. Genevieve 1, Alemany 0 -- Roland De La Maza tossed a two-hitter and Joe 
Cascione singled in the winning run in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
De La Maza had 11 strikeouts and no walks. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone has had much batting practice with the rain and the long 
layoff for Easter," St. Genevieve Coach Kevin Kane said. "You need your timing 
to hit Roland, especially when he's hitting spots with his pitches." 
</P>
<P>
Herman Merchan singled to left, advanced to second on Mike Cassidy's bunt 
single and scored on Cascione's single to right field. 
</P>
<P>
St. Genevieve (5-3) will play Mater Dei tonight at 7 at Blair Field. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi 4, St. Bernard 3 -- Crespi scored twice in the bottom of the seventh to 
come from behind and win. 
</P>
<P>
Chad Nichols and John Dempsey each delivered run-scoring singles with one out. 
Dempsey's bases-loaded hit scored Tim Weir to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi led, 2-1, entering the seventh, but St. Bernard scored twice to take the 
lead. Dan Malendez reached base on a fielding error which allowed John Coleman 
to score from third. Jeff Richardson later scored on a squeeze bunt by Grant 
Hohman. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Bennett (3-0) pitched two innings in relief of starter Chad Nichols to earn 
the win. 
</P>
<P>
SOFTBALL 
</P>
<P>
Poly 6, Sylmar 4 -- Jodi Soto (6-0) pitched a six-hitter with two strikeouts as 
Poly (9-2, 3-0) avenged last year's 4-3 second-round loss in the City Section 
4-A Division playoffs with a Valley Pac-8 Conference win at Poly. 
</P>
<P>
Tracey Bell hit a triple, home run and walked twice. 
</P>
<P>
Reseda 24, Grant 3 -- Michelle Brewer pitched a four-hitter and was four for 
five, including a solo home run, as Reseda (7-1, 3-0) breezed to a Valley Pac-8 
Conference win at Grant. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy Dockery was five for five to lead the Regents' 22-hit attack. Wendy Yanez 
was three for four, including a three-run home run. 
</P>
<P>
Brewer (5-1) struck out nine and walked five.

</P>

Chatsworth d. Taft, 15-6, 15-13, 15-5 -- Greg Weaver had 17 kills, and Chris 
Gleason and Jeremy Graham each had seven blocks to lead the Chancellors (6-0, 
2-0) in a Northwest Valley Conference match at Chatsworth. 
</P>

NORTHRIDGE TAKES A PEEK AT FUTURE WHILE FALLING TO PEPPERDINE, 6-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The development of a young ballplayer is not unlike the gradual maturity of 
young child: Success often comes after a series of failures. 
</P>
<P>
But every once in a while, there is a glimmer of what is to come -- the tiny 
shuffle before that big first step. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Kernen, Cal State Northridge's first-year baseball coach, caught a glimpse 
of the future Monday and liked what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, Northridge dropped a 6-5 decision to Pepperdine in a nonconference game 
at CSUN, but that wasn't the point. The Matadors-in-training -- five of 
Northridge's starting eight in the field were freshmen -- had given a good 
enough account of themselves to inspire some serious post-game verb tossing. 
</P>
<P>
"For us to go two games against a talented, experienced, quality, top-level 
Division I team like Pepperdine and beat them by one, then lose by one, that's 
a positive step for the program," said Kernen, whose team beat Pepperdine 5-4 a 
month ago. "I've been a lot more disappointed after some of our wins than I am 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Kernen was smiling over what he referred to as a "significant 
event" that took place in the fourth inning of Northridge's seventh loss in 10 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Four consecutive Matador batters -- three of them freshmen -- took turns 
tatooing the wall surrounding Matador field. The barrier survived the attack, 
but Pepperdine starter Wayne Helm didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Helm, who came in averaging a strikeout an inning, led, 2-0, and had allowed 
only two hits through 3 2/3 innings, but that impressive start quickly 
unraveled. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Shockey staggered Helm by blasting a triple that landed halfway up the 
wall in straight-away center field, 400 feet from home plate. J. D. Haendiges, 
also a first-year player, followed with a double that one-hopped the spot where 
Shockey's ball landed. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (13-9-1) tied the game, 2-2, when Ted Weisfuss scored Haendiges with 
a line-drive double down the left-field line. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Clayton, another freshman, chased Helm and gave the Matadors a 3-2 lead 
with a double off the wall in right-center. 
</P>
<P>
"Right there," Kernen said, "they showed who they really are and who they're 
going to be when they grow up." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Pepperdine's Andy Lopez is one coach who isn't thrilled with the 
prospect of facing these same not-so-cherubic faces in, say, another two years. 
</P>
<P>
"They're going to be good," Lopez said. "They're not just playing five 
freshmen. They're playing five really good freshmen." 
</P>
<P>
Of Northridge's 11 hits, eight were by freshmen -- including solo home runs by 
Denny Vigo and Clayton. 
</P>
<P>
Vigo's homer, which easily cleared the 375-foot sign in left-center field, tied 
the game, 4-4, after Pepperdine used two singles, an error and a sacrifice fly 
to regain the lead in the fifth inning. It was Vigo's first collegiate home 
run. 
</P>
<P>
Clayton's third homer of the season, another drive to left, pulled the Matadors 
within a run with one out in the ninth inning. And it almost ignited a winning 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
With two outs, Chae-Ho Chong walked and Anton Siegl doubled. Rusty McLain then 
lifted a fly ball to shallow right field that Pepperdine outfielder Jalal Leach 
caught off his shoe tops for the final out. 
</P>
<P>
Britt Craven earned the save for Pepperdine, pitching the last 2 2/3 innings in 
relief of winning pitcher Kipp Landis. 
</P>
<P>
Landis (2-0) came on in place of Helm in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Vale Lopez went the distance for Northridge, allowing 11 hits, walking four, 
hitting a batter and striking out one. Lopez (3-4) served up home runs by Rick 
Hirtensteiner, Chris Martin and Scott Shockey, Greg's older brother. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Shockey's eighth-inning homer, which traveled approximately 450 feet to 
right field, was the game-winning hit. MIKE HISERMAN

ICA HALVES INCOME GOAL, CITES LOAN LOSSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Imperial Corp. of America, parent company of Imperial Savings of California, 
has reduced its expected 1989 net income to $16 million, down from a previously 
announced goal of about $30 million, Vice President Andy Micheletti said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The revision was prompted by "an increase in estimated future losses" in ICA's 
wholesale consumer loan portfolio, which includes automobile leases, car loans 
and mobile home loans, Micheletti said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Those anticipated losses were driven by "higher levels of delinquency and lower 
recovery rates" in connection with consumer loan portfolios that ICA has 
purchased in the past, Micheletti said. 
</P>
<P>
The problem-plagued wholesale consumer loan portfolio earlier contributed to a 
$15.6-million net loss during the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, 1988. At that 
time, San Diego-based ICA established $50 million in reserves to cover 
anticipated loan losses, including some losses associated with the wholesale 
consumer loan portfolio. ICA also eliminated its fourth-quarter dividend. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the past and anticipated losses, ICA has begun to phase out its 
wholesale consumer loan business, Micheletti said. Wholesale consumer loans 
account for $1.6 billion, or about 19%, of ICA's $8.9 billion in total loans 
and mortgage-related securities. 
</P>
<P>
ICA is now "restructuring" the mortgage banking and consumer lending department 
that handled wholesale consumer loan originations, Micheletti said. Several 
executives in the department who directed the wholesale consumer loan 
origination business "are no longer with us," Micheletti said. Some of the 
department's 50 employees will be reassigned or lose their jobs because of the 
restructuring, Micheletti said. 
</P>
<P>
In January, ICA Chairman Kenneth Thygerson predicted that ICA's 1989 net income 
would "return to levels of profitability experienced during the first three 
quarters of 1988." ICA reported $30 million in net income during those three 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
"That isn't going to happen," Micheletti said Monday. "We expect 1989 earnings 
to be something close to $16 million or worse." 
</P>
<P>
The $16 million net income would match the 1989 total that ICA reported for 
1988. ICA reported $51 million in net income during 1987. 
</P>
<P>
ICA's 1989 consumer loan losses "will depend upon the delinquency level for the 
remainder of the year, among other factors," Micheletti said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the delinquency rates experienced during 1988 and early 1989 "may 
indicate continued high levels of delinquencies which previously were expected 
to decline," Micheletti said.

SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market rallied Monday on very light volume after falling 100 points 
in the Dow Jones Industrial Average during the previous five trading days, said 
Irving Katz, Director of Research at Thomas Green/SD Securities. Continued 
fears of inflation and higher interest rates continue to scare away investors 
as stocks have difficulty finding support, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this forbidding outlook, four San Diego stocks managed to make new 
highs. Molecular Biosystems reached a new high of $21.625 and closed the week 
up $1.75, at $20. The company went public in 1983 at an adjusted price of $2 
and since has risen tenfold. 
</P>
<P>
Other new highs were recorded by Christiana, at $8.125, Southwest Bank, at 
$5.625, and BSD Bancorp, at $5.75. BSD Bancorp is still selling below its 
year-end book value. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham Pacific Properties gained $.375, to $18.50, after receiving favorable 
mention in this week's Barron's magazine. 
</P>
<P>
A new low was hit by Imperial Corp. of America, at $6.375, as it fell $.875, to 
$6.75, on the announcement that 1989 earnings may be at or below the 1988 
level. The company has experienced higher than expected losses on its purchased 
consumer loan portfolio. Other new lows were hit by Synbiotics, at $4.75, and 
Yuba Natural Resources, at $.75. 
</P>
<P>
Price Co., which fell $1.125, to $34.875, continues to suffer from its 
intention to issue later this year a $5 convertible preferred stock share for 
each 10 shares of common stock owned. Investors are overlooking the strengths 
of the company, the earnings of which have increased more than 20% in each year 
since 1985. 
</P>

BUSTING CABLE PIRATES; 
</P>
<P>
SIMI VALLEY PIRACY CASE IS ONE OF THE FIRST TO RESULT IN A CONVICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The investigation began two years ago year when a Walt Disney Co. executive 
spotted a van with the logo "Cable Busters" tooling around his neighborhood. 
Disney alerted the Motion Picture Assn. of America and last month a Simi Valley 
businessmen was sentenced in Ventura Municipal Court after his conviction on 
three counts of violating the state's cable theft law. 
</P>
<P>
Itzhak Bejerano, 43, owned Cable Busters, a Simi Valley store that sold 
satellite TV dishes. According to prosecutors, he also sold illegal decoding 
equipment so that his customers could watch whatever cable TV programs they 
wanted without paying the cable companies for the service. 
</P>
<P>
Bejerano was sentenced to 90 days in jail and ordered to pay a $15,000 fine. He 
is appealing the case. 
</P>
<P>
Bejerano had an employee, Max Sarango, who also was charged with cable piracy. 
In July, Sarango pleaded no contest to a single count of violating the state's 
cable theft law and later was sentenced to 60 days in jail and fined $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Deputy Dist. Atty. Mike K. Frawley said the Bejerano case was 
one of the first in the nation in which satellite signal piracy had ended in a 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
It's part of a fledgling national effort by the Motion Picture Assn. of 
America, the Federal Communications Commission and the cable industry to try to 
slow the theft of cable programming, which amounts to $1.4 billion a year in 
lost income. The problem is that TV-addled couch potatoes can go out and buy 
sophisticated electronics gear that illegally unscrambles cable TV signals that 
arrive via satellite dishes, or divert signals in homes already wired for 
cable. 
</P>
<P>
In the past couple of years, there have been about 30 cases of cable piracy 
theft prosecuted by federal and local officials, according to James Allen, head 
of the National Cable Assn.'s office of cable signal theft. 
</P>
<P>
Besides trying to put the makers of illegal cable decoding equipment out of 
business, Allen said, "we're trying to educate consumers that if you 
participate in cable piracy, you may have to bear responsibility." Some 
important federal cable piracy cases are winding up, and he hopes that the 
elaborate customer lists kept by cable decoding equipment sellers will be 
turned over to local cable franchises so they can try to collect unpaid fees 
from those who bought the illegal equipment. 
</P>
<P>
But trying to stop cable piracy is like trying to stop an advancing army with a 
peashooter. The mathematics of cable theft is daunting. There are about 1 
million satellite dishes in the United States today, and "as much as 50%" of 
the owners are pirating some cable programming, said Mark Harrad, spokesman for 
the Motion Picture Assn. of America. 
</P>
<P>
The other thievery occurs in areas already wired for cable. Allen says 78 
million American homes are cable-ready and in 12%, or 9 million of those homes, 
"there is some level of signal theft." 
</P>
<P>
It's all the more appalling for cable companies because they have spent plenty 
trying to protect their product. Moved in part by the surge in satellite dish 
sales, in January, 1986, HBO and Cinemax began scrambling their signals and, 
since then, most cable companies have followed. So in theory, cable customers 
who want to watch, say HBO, have to pay a monthly fee for the privilege. 
</P>
<P>
But where there is a will, there is a way. Anyone skimming through the pages of 
electronics magazines will find plenty of ads by elusive retailers, with 800 
numbers and obscure post office boxes, offering to sell illegal cable decoding 
systems for $200 and up. 
</P>
<P>
"We're never going to develop a decoder box that's 100% tamper-proof. It's just 
a matter of time before electronic wizards out there trying to defeat 
electronic scramblers break through," said Chuck Peters, security manager for 
Cox Cable in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Curt Christenson, technical manager for United Cable, which has a cable 
franchise in the east San Fernando Valley, pointed out that 98% of his 
company's programming is scrambled, including the visual and audio signals. 
Despite those precautions, "everything is defeatable by the average black 
market converter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bejerano case, prosecutors say, helps explain how the system can be beat. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Bejerano nor Sarango would return phone calls requesting comment on 
their cases. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the way a satellite dish system is set up, if you buy a TV dish -- 
presumably because you live in a rural area that doesn't have cable -- to 
legally watch most cable channels, you also need to buy a decoder (cost: about 
$400). A customer calls the individual cable company and signs up for the 
service and, via a satellite signal, the customer's decoder box is 
electronically authorized to pick up the TV signal. 
</P>
<P>
Terrence Luddey, director of security for a division of General Instruments in 
San Diego that is one of the prime suppliers of scrambling technology the cable 
industry, was called in by police to look over Bejerano and Sarango's 
handiwork. He called it "very sophisticated." 
</P>
<P>
Luddey said Bejerano and Sarango removed circuit boards from legal satellite 
decoders, altered the one computer chip that contains the signal access code, 
then "reprogrammed the computer chip and reinserted it back into the board." 
</P>
<P>
The idea is to find an access code for a satellite dish customer who is paying 
for the cable programming, Luddy said. A cable pirate clones a computer chip 
with the same access code and installs it in another decoder. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the undercover work on the Bejerano-Sarango case was done by Tom Sheil, 
an investigator for the Motion Picture Assn. of America. According to Frawley, 
Sheil called Sarango and said he was interested in buying a satellite dish and 
Sarango told him that it was possible to "fix you up with a descrambler. Pay 
one price and get everything." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Posing as Buyer 
</P>
<P>
So Sheil, with the cooperation of Simi Valley police, posed as a local 
homeowner and agreed to buy a satellite dish with all the illegal trimmings. 
Both Sarango and Bejerano showed up to close the deal with Sheil. After some 
last-minute dickering, Frawley said, Sheil agreed to buy a fancy satellite dish 
from them for $3,150 and, for another $1,150, he would buy their doctored 
satellite decoder. 
</P>
<P>
The one caveat, Frawley said, was that Sheil was told that he'd have to pay for 
the $1,150 decoder in cash. Sheil duly paid it out, mostly in $20 bills, 
Frawley said, and Bejerano and Sarango were arrested in February, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
After getting search warrants, police hunted through Bejerano's store and went 
through Bejerano and Sarango's homes, finding a variety of illegal satellite 
gear and computer chips essential for rigging a decoder, Frawley said. He said 
police also found $25,000 in cash in Bejerano's home. 
</P>
<P>
Although satellite dishes can be pirated, Luddey said homes already wired for 
cable make even easier targets. 
</P>
<P>
But cable companies vary in how they cope with cable pirates. Cox Cable in San 
Diego has a 13-member investigative unit that actively hunts for cable theft in 
its territory, including using street patrols that look for unauthorized taps 
on cable lines and following up on tips that somebody has an illegal 
descrambler in his home. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the company says it hauled in $126,000 in unpaid fees from cable 
customers who were pirating signals. 
</P>
<P>
But Christenson at United Cable says his company doesn't bother with a serious 
anti-piracy campaign. "You have to weigh how much it costs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the matter of overcoming public sentiment. Frawley said he had a 
tough time picking a jury for the Bejerano case. 
</P>
<P>
One potential juror "had drawn up his own plans for a blueprint on how to make 
a descrambler," Frawley said. "I asked a lot of people what they would do if 
they were offered an opportunity to get free signals, and they said they would 
do it. It's so prevalent, it's tough to get people to agree to follow the law."

ST. IVES DENIES TAKEOVER RUMORS AFTER STOCK SOARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stock of St. Ives Laboratories has been as hot as the devil lately. 
</P>
<P>
Amid persistent Wall Street rumors that the Chatsworth manufacturer of 
personal-care products might soon get a takeover bid, St. Ives' stock rose 
sharply last week in very heavy trading, the latest gain in a steady surge that 
began in January. 
</P>
<P>
The stock closed Monday at $14.625 a share, down 37.5 cents, in national 
over-the-counter trading after advancing $1.875 last week. Last Tuesday alone, 
St. Ives' stock jumped nearly 3 points before settling back to close with a 
75-cent gain, as about 14 times the company's normal trading volume changed 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
The volatility prompted St. Ives to set aside its policy of not commenting on 
market rumors and announce last week that it was "not a party to any 
discussions or negotiations with any potential suitors." 
</P>
<P>
However, St. Ives also hinted that it was open to a deal by saying it 
periodically "examines its strategic direction and is currently doing so." 
</P>
<P>
St. Ives, with sales of $104 million last year, makes shampoos, skin lotions 
and other personal-care items that it markets under the "Swiss Formula" logo. 
The company went public in July, 1987, at $13 a share, then watched the stock 
drop below $6 last year before ending the year at $8.875 a share. 
</P>
<P>
The stock got a boost early this year after Stephen Redding, a vice president 
of Nexxus Products Co., another personal-care products maker, disclosed that he 
bought 5.3% of St. Ives' shares. 
</P>
<P>
St. Ives' shares spurted further early this month after Minnetonka Corp., a 
Minnesota-based cosmetics concern, put itself on the sales block. Traders 
apparently speculated that a new round of takeover interest in 
personal-products companies might be in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
But St. Ives, in its announcement last week, dampened any speculation about a 
possible bid by Redding or Nexxus -- to which St. Ives sells some products -- 
by saying Redding recently sold 40,000 of his shares, paring his St. Ives stake 
to 4.9%. Redding had previously said he bought the stock as an investment. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, it's unlikely that a takeover proposal would materialize without 
the blessing of St. Ives' management. Gary H. Worth, chairman, and Robert Van 
Dine, vice chairman, together own a controlling 53.3% of the company's stock.

VALLEY EARNINGS: REPUBLIC AMERICAN TELLS 4TH-QUARTER DROP OF 65% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republic American Corp. said it earned $2 million in the fourth quarter that 
ended Dec. 31, down 65% from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The Encino workers compensation insurance company posted a $5.3-million 
underwriting loss on a 17% decline to $51.1 million in net premiums earned, an 
insurance industry figure similar to revenue. That loss was offset by $6.6 
million in net investment income in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
For all of 1988, Republic American earned $19 million, down 30% from 1987. Net 
premiums earned fell 5% to $226.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Slightly more than half of Republic American's shares are owned by two 
companies, Penn Central Corp. of Greenwich, Conn., and American Financial Corp. 
of Cincinnati, which are controlled by Cincinnati financier Carl H. Lindner. 
</P>
<P>
Republic American shareholders are scheduled to vote next month on the 
company's acquisition by Penn Central. Penn Central is offering $15.75 a share, 
or nearly $140 million, for the shares not already owned by Lindner-controlled 
companies.

VALLEY EARNINGS: HOUSE OF FABRICS PROFIT RISES 9% FOR 4TH QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
House of Fabrics said its fiscal fourth-quarter profit rose 9% from a year 
earlier on a 10% increase in sales. 
</P>
<P>
The Sherman Oaks company, which operates a chain of 653 fabric and 
sewing-accessories stores, said net income in the quarter that ended Jan. 31 
climbed to $4.73 million from $4.33 million, and sales increased to $100.8 
million from $91.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
House of Fabrics attributed the gains to its recent restructuring, in which the 
company phased out many of its smaller mall stores and opened larger, 
stand-alone outlets. The new stores are more popular because they offer more 
merchandise and are more convenient for customers, House of Fabrics contends. 
</P>
<P>
For its full fiscal year, House of Fabrics' profit rose 9% to $11.4 million 
from $10.5 million, and its annual sales were up 5% to $338 million from $322.5 
million.

San Diego dancer Michelle Schumacher was only a teen-ager in 1985, when she was 
spotted at a cattle call and cast for a starring role in Starlight's "A Chorus 
Line." After that, she became a familiar face in the musical theater scene 
around town -- until she took a hiatus in Los Angeles to sharpen her skills. 
Schumacher is back on stage now, in the Lawrence Welk Village Theater's 
production of "Promises Promises," where she will remain through May 6.

A decade of bargaining between the Air Force Logistics Command and a federal 
workers' union has ended with the military offering child care to the command's 
83,000 civilian employees nationwide. The Assn. of Federal Government Employees 
since 1978 had sought Air Force funding for union-operated day care for 
children of civilian AFLC employees. The agreement gives control to the Air 
Force, which by October will expand its existing AFLC child-care facilities and 
offer them to all families of civilian workers. Families of uniformed personnel 
in the Air Force, as in other services, long have had access to subsidized day 
care.

Anne Henderson Pollard, who is serving a prison term on charges related to her 
husband's spying, pleaded with U.S. District Judge Harry MacLaughlin in 
Minneapolis to be transferred from a federal prison hospital in Rochester, 
Minn., where she said she is being mistreated. Pollard, who is serving two 
concurrent five-year prison terms, is the wife of Jonathan Jay Pollard, 34, who 
was sentenced in 1987 to life in prison for supplying classified documents to 
Israeli agents. Pollard, 28, and her lawyers argued that she should be 
transferred to a less stressful facility, namely a federal prison camp in 
Danbury, Conn. She has a gastro-intestinal disorder. Among other things, 
Pollard said she feels isolated because she is the only female prisoner.

The Soviet Union abandoned construction work at the Krasnodar nuclear power 
station near the Black Sea after an outcry over its location and safety, the 
official Tass news agency said. The decision came just nine days after the 
government shut down the only working nuclear power station in the Armenian 
republic, the first plant decommissioned in the Soviet Union. The Soviets had 
plans to double its nuclear power generation, but after the 1986 disaster at 
the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, which killed 31 people, the government 
abandoned plans to build six more stations. Nuclear power accounts for 12.7% of 
all electricity generated in the Soviet Union.

A mother and her boyfriend were sought by San Diego County authorities in the 
abandonment, abuse and molestation of 2-year-old twin brothers found in a Del 
Mar hotel. The boyfriend, Charles Thomas McCoy, 27, of Phoenix, was identified 
by one of the twins and Del Mar Inn employees who viewed a photo lineup, said 
sheriff's Detective Mary Stables. The twins were being treated at a hospital 
for sexual abuse and what Stables described as "deep bruises from hand imprints 
on their faces -- like they were shoved; cuts on their necks and cigarette 
burns on their stomachs and sides." The children would not say how they were 
hurt, Stables said. The detective added that the mother, whose name was not 
released, also was sought for questioning after she called the hospital, 
requesting to see her children, but did not show up.

COST OF HOUSE RACES PUT AT $204 MILLION

It cost more than $204 million to fill the 435 House seats in the November 
election, with incumbents -- almost all of whom won -- trouncing opponents in 
donations, spending and political action committee money, according to a new 
study. The report from Common Cause, a self-styled public interest group, 
showed that the 789 candidates who ran for the House in the general election 
raised $240.9 million and spent $204.3 million. PACs contributed a record $99.6 
million. The 408 incumbents in the election raised $174.2 million, of which 
$82.1 million came from PACs, and spent $141.8 million, the study found. The 
328 challengers, meanwhile, raised $38.9 million, of which $9 million came from 
PACs, and spent $36.4 million. The 53 candidates who sought open seats raised 
$27.7 million, $8.4 million from PACs, and spent $26 million. Eventually, 98.6% 
of House incumbents were reelected.

BAN ON SKI RESORT LIFTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal appeals court has lifted the ban on construction of a $100-million 
ski and golf resort at Squaw Valley. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals 
ruled that the Army Corps of Engineers acted properly in limiting its 
environmental review of the project to 11 acres of federally protected 
wetlands. Writing for a unanimous three-judge panel, Judge Joseph Sneed said 
courts should defer to the corps' own regulations on projects that touch 
federal and non-federal land. Those regulations tell the corps to review an 
entire project only when the federal portion -- here, the wetlands -- is a link 
in a chain that holds the project together, Sneed said. But the court left the 
door open for further challenges, and environmental groups said they would seek 
a new ban.

Laos has put on hold plans to cooperate with the United States against drug 
trafficking because of a U.S. report accusing Laotian government officials of 
involvement in the drug trade, Deputy Foreign Minister Souban Salitthilat said 
in Vientiane. "We were absolutely stunned and surprised at the American 
government report (issued March 1)," Souban said. Before the report, he said, 
Laos had been prepared to discuss direct U.S. aid and to send officials to the 
United States for anti-drug training. Under U.S. law, the negative report means 
that Laos cannot receive direct bilateral aid.

WOO EMERGES AS A MAN WITH 2 CONSTITUENCIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rolling Stone article infuriated Yoon Hee Kim. 
</P>
<P>
In a satire of the South Korean presidential election last year, the magazine 
made references that were offensive to Koreans. 
</P>
<P>
Kim and other leaders from Los Angeles' Korean community, looking for an 
apology, turned to the one man they knew would help: City Councilman Michael 
Woo. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Role Model' 
</P>
<P>
Woo immediately called a press conference and denounced the article as racist. 
Rolling Stone flew an editor to Los Angeles from New York, apologized for the 
story and pledged, among other things, to hire an Asian intern. 
</P>
<P>
"Woo is a role model for Korean-Americans, and a positive symbol," said Kim, 
who heads the Korean American Coalition, an advocacy group based in Koreatown. 
"Having the support of a politician goes a long way." 
</P>
<P>
During his first term on the City Council, Woo -- the grandson of a Chinese 
laundryman and the only Asian ever to serve on the council -- has emerged as 
the point man for Asians throughout Los Angeles, the vast majority of whom have 
never cast a ballot for him because they live outside his 13th District. 
</P>
<P>
As he approaches what most observers predict will be certain reelection, Woo's 
stature in the city's growing Asian community has made him a man with two 
constituencies. While he dutifully returns calls from supporters in Chinatown, 
he also tends to voters in his diverse and demanding district, which stretches 
from the affluent hills above Sherman Oaks, to the immigrant neighborhoods of 
Hollywood to the gay enclaves of Silver Lake. 
</P>
<P>
Only 10% of the residents in Woo's district are Asian, and less than one-third 
of those are registered to vote. Caltech political science professor Bruce Cain 
said Asian immigrants have a history of not voting, possibly because they are 
still too few in number or because they emigrated for economic rather than 
political reasons. In addition, many are not citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"About 95% of my (voters) are not Asian, do not care what I do for the Asian 
community, and would be offended if they thought I was doing more for Asians 
and not enough for them," Woo said in a recent interview. "I find my political 
identification as an Asian-American to be a strong asset in terms of the 
growing Asian population. . . . At the same time, (it) causes some strains in 
terms of the seemingly unlimited demands I get in terms of showing up for 
dinners and meeting the expectations of Asian community groups." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Expectations 
</P>
<P>
And the expectations are often very high. Woo appears at banquets in Chinatown, 
lends his name to fund-raisers in Little Tokyo and meets with businessmen in 
Koreatown. Leaders in those communities -- none of which fall within Woo's 
district -- say the councilman's support can mean the difference between a 
marginal and a successful event. 
</P>
<P>
Woo routinely is asked to recommend Asians to serve on boards for nonprofit 
foundations, banks and museums. He is called upon to speak at Asian functions 
outside Los Angeles, and is now president of a national association of Asian 
council members and mayors. 
</P>
<P>
His office also fields hundreds of inquiries from Asians in and out of the 
city, ranging from questions about immigration to complaints about 
discrimination. In that sense, several community leaders said, Woo serves as 
the unofficial clearinghouse for much of Asian Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"He is the highest-ranking Asian . . . at the elected level," said Stewart 
Kwoh, executive director of the Asian Pacific American Legal Center of Southern 
California. "When people are desperate and they don't know where to turn, they 
often turn to him. They may not know about my agency, but they will know about 
Councilman Mike Woo." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lifeblood of Career 
</P>
<P>
Woo's Asian connection, while demanding, has also been the lifeblood of his 
budding political career, which started as an aide to state Sen. David A. 
Roberti (D-Los Angeles) and, some supporters expect, eventually will entail a 
run for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Woo's triumph over incumbent Peggy Stevenson in 1985 was bankrolled in large 
part by Asian contributors -- with his father, Chinatown banker Wilbur Woo, 
leading the list. His first bid for Stevenson's seat in 1981 was also largely 
funded by Asian supporters. 
</P>
<P>
This time around, the councilman has collected funds from a broader base -- 
including developers, a traditional gold mine for City Council incumbents -- 
but he continues to hold fund-raisers in Chinatown and his campaign finance 
reports include scores of Asian donors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tumultuous Redistricting 
</P>
<P>
Equally important, Woo and others credit his Asian followers with rescuing him 
from near political extinction during the City Council's tumultuous 
redistricting just a year after his election. More than 30 Asian leaders and 
organizations protested a plan proposed by Councilman Richard Alatorre that 
would have placed Woo in a new, predominantly Latino district. 
</P>
<P>
The council approved Alatorre's plan, but Mayor Tom Bradley, noting that it 
would likely rob Asians of their first representative on the council, vetoed 
it. In the end, Woo kept the core of his original Hollywood-area district, 
losing most of Echo Park on the east and picking up Studio City and some of 
Sherman Oaks in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Woo says he works hard to balance Asian and non-Asian demands on his time -- 
putting in 13 and 14 hours a day and packing his schedule with meetings and 
events in and out of his district. After being accused during his unsuccessful 
1981 campaign of being too closely tied to Asian concerns, Woo says he has 
deliberately broadened his political base -- sometimes at the expense of his 
fellow Asians. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agonized Over Decision 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, for example, Woo said he agonized over a decision to endorse 
Gloria Molina in the race for the newly created 1st District council seat, 
which the council designed to elect a Latino. Woo said he supported Molina -- 
even though the district includes Chinatown and two Asians were also running -- 
because "she was the best-qualified candidate" and he wanted to make a strong 
statement about his own independence. 
</P>
<P>
"While I am proud to be the first Asian on the council, I don't want people to 
stereotype me and expect a knee-jerk reaction whenever a demand is placed on me 
by the Asian community," Woo said. 
</P>
<P>
Although there have been some grumblings in Woo's district about the amount of 
time he spends on non-district issues, even his harshest critics have shied 
away from blaming his Asian commitments. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many things I have to criticize Mike for, but I don't think that is 
anywhere on my list," said Bennett Kayser, 42, one of four candidates 
challenging Woo in the April 11 primary. "His problem is that he ignores his 
constituents, except those who have big money and big development interests." 
</P>
<P>
Woo draws mixed reviews from residents in the 13th District, having alienated 
some homeowners in Sherman Oaks over a boundary dispute with neighboring Studio 
City and scores of property owners over proposed building restrictions in the 
Hollywood Hills. He also faces a fierce and vocal group of opponents in 
Hollywood, who complain that his support for the Hollywood Redevelopment 
Project has sentenced the community to a future of traffic jams and congested, 
high-rise development. 
</P>
<P>
But Woo's opposition is fractured, poorly organized and has little money. His 
critics in Hollywood, for example, have failed to rally behind one candidate. 
Kayser, Venus De Milo and Zahrina Machadah all lay claim to the 
anti-redevelopment vote. Even candidate Berndt Lohr-Schmidt, an attorney from 
the Hollywood Hills who first clashed with Woo over the hillside building 
restrictions, has worked hard to attract redevelopment foes. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders in both Woo constituencies -- the Asian and the 13th District -- 
attribute his success in part to his considerable political skills. Friends and 
enemies alike say Woo has the fine touch of a seasoned politician -- never at a 
loss for words, ever aware of his public image and always on hand to make an 
important phone call or write a personal note. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael is smooth," said Collin Lai, a Chinatown businessman who is active in 
the Chinese American Citizens Alliance. "He reminds me of Roberti. They are 
smooth. They have a sense of community responsibility, like a social worker. 
They don't say, 'Hey, buddy, get the hell out of here.' They try to be pleasant 
and let you down easily." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
13th CITY COUNCIL DISTRICT 
</P>
<P>
Like Los Angeles itself, the 13th City Council District is a multi-ethnic 
collection of Anglos, Asians, Latinos, blacks, Russians and Armenians, 
represented by an Asian, Councilman Michael Woo. It reaches from the 
fashionable and expensive Hollywood Hills to the crowded, low-income flatlands 
of old Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The largest number of Asians live in an area from the Silver Lake Reservoir 
east to Hollywood, and it is here that Woo, of Chinese descent, is assured of 
enthusiastic support. But not enough to win, by far. For despite the ethnic 
variety, political power is held by Anglos, and Woo has had to rely on them 
much more than on Asians. That is because the district's Asians, like the other 
ethnic minorities, have a low voter registration.

THE CHALLENGERS 
</P>
<P>
Venus De Milo, 49, has previously run for mayor and county supervisor. A renter 
in Hollywood, De Milo is a self-described rent control activist. A former 
stripper, she now lists her occupation as a computer consultant. She describes 
Woo as a "shadow without a face" and says she is running because he "has not 
kept any of his promises." She lists traffic, crime and social services among 
the key campaign issues. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett Kayser, 42, had to go to court to get his name on the ballot after the 
city clerk's office said he did not collect enough valid signatures to qualify. 
Kayser, former president of the Federation of Hillside and Canyon Assns., has 
lived in the Silver Lake-Echo Park area for 17 years. He has been critical of 
Woo's support of the Hollywood redevelopment project, until recently serving on 
the project's citizens advisory panel as a representative of an 
anti-redevelopment group. Kayser said he is running to give the district a 
"true slow-growth representative who will represent people rather than do 
battle against them." 
</P>
<P>
Berndt Lohr-Schmidt, 45, is a Harvard-educated attorney who has lived in the 
Hollywood Hills for 16 years and owns property there. He first clashed with Woo 
</P>
<P>
over Woo's proposed restrictions on hillside residential construction, which 
Lohr-Schmidt says would unfairly punish property owners who have not yet 
developed their lots. He describes the election as "a referendum on Mr. Woo," 
who he says has "made our district a model of neglect." Lohr-Schmidt has been 
making efforts to extend his base of support beyond the hillsides, recently 
picking up the endorsement of the Greater Hollywood Civic Assn., a group that 
has been critical of Woo's support of the Hollywood redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
Zahrina Machadah, 58, who rents an apartment in the Beachwood Canyon area of 
Hollywood, also ran for the seat in the 1970s. The former owner of a shoeshine 
stand on Sunset Boulevard, she says Woo failed to deliver on several campaign 
promises, including one to provide crosswalks and better lighting in her 
neighborhood. She has also criticized Woo for spending several hundred thousand 
dollars to renovate his City Hall office. "What I lack in experience and funds, 
I make up in energy, integrity and my big mouth," she said.

WRECKING CREW CHECKS IN AT OLD HUNTINGTON HOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bulldozer wrestled chunks of concrete into a pile and a 170-foot-tall crane 
moved demolition equipment Monday into the big, empty Huntington Hotel in 
Pasadena, whose glassless windows gaped open to the elements. 
</P>
<P>
The event marked the final chapter in a long struggle between developers and 
the city's preservationist forces, who lost a 1987 referendum seeking to 
restore the historic structure. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done a lot of planning and thinking on this project," said co-owner 
Thomas R. Tellefsen, part of a consortium that intends to build a modern, 
"similar-looking" hostelry, then lease it to Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co. "Now we're 
here. It's finally actually happening." 
</P>
<P>
The new hotel will be called the Ritz-Carlton Huntington Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The $100-million hotel project, which was bitterly contested by Pasadena 
preservationists, should be completed by the end of 1990, said developer Lary 
Mielke. Demolition, which began Monday, should be done by midsummer, he said. 
Construction of the new 385-room hotel, financed by Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. 
of Tokyo, will then begin immediately, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just one step in the process," Mielke said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Argument for Restoration 
</P>
<P>
Preservationist groups, such as the influential Pasadena Heritage, had argued 
that the original hotel should be restored. 
</P>
<P>
"Indications are that they're going to build a high-quality new hotel," 
conceded Sue Mossman, program director for the group. "But it will never be the 
original Huntington," the last of Pasadena's once-elegant resort hotels. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel had hosted Presidents from Teddy Roosevelt to Richard M. Nixon, as 
well as a range of the famous from Bing Crosby to Arturo Toscanini and from 
Albert Einstein to Billy Graham. The hotel was also a setting for movies, 
including "Love Story" and "Bad News Bears Go to Japan." 
</P>
<P>
The 280-room main building of the 82-year-old hotel had been closed since 
October, 1985, when Keikyu U.S.A. Inc., a branch of the Japanese electric 
railway company that bought the hotel in 1974, found that it did not have 
sufficient structural strength to withstand a major earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
During both demolition and construction, 110 rooms outside the main building, 
in cottages and other structures, will continue to operate as a "country inn," 
Tellefsen said. 
</P>
<P>
Mossman said many of the fine architectural details of the hotel, which for 
decades had been a focus for Pasadena's social and cultural life, will be 
sacrificed to modern construction techniques. 
</P>
<P>
"Craftsmanship today is not what it was when that building was built," Mossman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But the developers said they will preserve some features of the old building, 
such as its wrought-iron balconies. 
</P>
<P>
The faded elegance of the old building could not compete with modern hotels, 
said Lathrop K. Leishman, president of this year's Tournament of Roses. 
</P>
<P>
"The rooms were narrow, the doors were narrow and the elevators were lousy," he 
said. "Imagine having to put three of those football players in a room like 
that. People today want class and comfort."

COURT ACTION ENDS 26-YEAR L.A. SCHOOL DESEGREGATION CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE WOO, Times Education Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ending an often bitter 26-year legal battle, a federal judge in Los Angeles on 
Monday dismissed the last remaining defendant in a class-action lawsuit to 
desegregate the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima dropped the state Department of 
Education and Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig from the suit at the 
request of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, which said 
it could not afford to continue pressing the case. 
</P>
<P>
The state had become the sole defendant in January, when Tashima dismissed the 
Los Angeles school district from the case. 
</P>
<P>
Because the NAACP agreed to the dismissal, it cannot appeal the decision. 
Moreover, it is effectively barred from legally renewing its charges that the 
district caused the intentional segregation of black students from 1963, when 
the original desegregation suit was filed, to the present. 
</P>
<P>
But the district still faces allegations of unequal treatment of minority 
students in a suit brought by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education 
Fund and other public-interest law firms in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
And the federal court action does not preclude the NAACP from suing the 
district for discriminating against ethnic minority students if it finds 
evidence of such discrimination in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The dismissal came as the Los Angeles Board of Education was scheduled to vote 
on a massive plan to raise achievement levels of minority students. The 
proposed plan is not related to the NAACP suit, but addresses some of the same 
issues and acknowledges that "institutional racism" contributes to inferior 
education for minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers said they were doubtful that any civil rights organization could 
afford the monumental costs of litigating a major school desegregation lawsuit 
in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Orfield, a University of Chicago desegregation expert, said the end of the 
Los Angeles desegregation case focuses attention on the "special problems in 
the very largest cities -- Chicago, New York and Los Angeles -- that have 
patterns of segregation no one can afford to litigate. It would cost so many 
millions of dollars, beyond the capacity of any minority group in the country 
to pay . . . so we may have a situation where justice exists, but no one can 
afford to obtain it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Learned the Hard Way 
</P>
<P>
Said Joseph H. Duff, an NAACP lawyer who recently was elected president of the 
organization's Los Angeles branch: "That is essentially the lesson we learned 
-- the hard way." 
</P>
<P>
Duff would not comment on the long-term impact of the judge's decision to end 
the protracted lawsuit, but said he is keenly disappointed by it. 
</P>
<P>
"We clearly have not gained any desegregation in the district," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Duff said the NAACP lacks the manpower and the money to adequately research the 
case, which would have involved reviewing thousands of pages of documents 
produced by the district and the state. He said he does not know how much the 
group has spent on the lawsuit. But school district officials estimate district 
expenses at more than $4 million since 1963. 
</P>
<P>
"The NAACP will be working politically" to try to force changes in the Los 
Angeles school district that will improve education for minorities, 
particularly for black youngsters, Duff added. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Atty. Gen. G. R. Overton, representing the state, said Monday that "this 
case couldn't have been brought successfully even eight years ago" because of 
demographic shifts in the district toward a majority of non-Anglo students and 
because of the hardships posed by the long commutes many children would have 
had to endure if mandatory busing was ordered. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Enough Anglos 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1960s, the school district was more than 55% Anglo. Today, Anglo 
youngsters account for 15.8% of the total enrollment of 595,000 students. 
Fifty-nine percent are Latino, 16.7% are black, 6.4% are Asian and Pacific 
Islander, 1.9% are Filipino and 0.2% are American Indian. 
</P>
<P>
The NAACP filed its original desegregation case on behalf of the district's 
black students in 1963 in Los Angeles Superior Court. That suit led to nearly 
three combative years of court-ordered busing, which ended after voters 
approved Proposition 1 in 1979, an initiative that barred state courts from 
ordering busing as a remedy for segregation. 
</P>
<P>
The civil rights group refiled the case in federal court in 1981, again 
alleging that the district has unlawfully discriminated against black students 
through policies and actions dating back to 1969. 
</P>
<P>
School district officials say, however, that the district's voluntary 
desegregation efforts have achieved as much integration as possible in a 
district with fewer than 100,000 white students. 
</P>
<P>
The district spends about $260 million a year on integration programs, 
including voluntary busing -- chiefly of black students to predominantly Anglo 
schools -- and magnet schools, which offer specialized or accelerated learning 
to about 25,000 of the district's 595,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Programs in Place 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a lot of programs in place that are helping minority kids right 
now," said Peter W. James, a lawyer with McCutchen, Black, Verleger &amp; Shea, 
which represented the district in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Last June, NAACP officials were hopeful that they could craft a settlement with 
the district that would create new educational programs for minority youngsters 
that would begin to reverse years of academic failure. Among the efforts the 
civil rights group had envisioned were an expansion of the district's "10 
Schools Program," in which 10 of the district's lowest achieving black schools 
were reorganized and given special aid, and reducing class sizes in 
predominantly black and Latino schools to a maximum of 18 students each. The 
district estimated that the new programs would cost in excess of $80 million. 
</P>
<P>
The district relies heavily on the state to cover the costs of integration. But 
late last year the state said it would not pay for the proposed programs, and 
settlement efforts crumbled. 
</P>
<P>
Duff was critical of the 10-year plan for ending low achievement that was to be 
addressed by the school board Monday. The plan calls for a number of costly 
changes, such as smaller classes in kindergarten through second grades and more 
pre-kindergarten programs. But Duff said it failed to adequately focus on the 
specific needs of black youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
"In this district, the achievement problem is essentially a black problem, and 
until they deal with that, the other problems are not going to get solved." 
</P>
<P>
The NAACP lawyer acknowledged that the desegregation battles produced some 
benefits for minority children, noting that the district's magnet and voluntary 
busing programs resulted in "an opening up of white schools to minority 
children." But overall, he said, the solutions offered by the district "haven't 
matched the problems."

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 17-year-old girl was ordered Monday to be prosecuted as an adult on charges

TRASH RECYCLING CENTER OPENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley and other Los Angeles city officials broke ground Monday for 
a downtown trash recycling center and transfer station intended to reduce truck 
traffic on freeways and the amount of refuse dumped at landfills. 
</P>
<P>
The facility at 2201 E. Washington St. will accept trash from private and 
public trash haulers so their trucks will not have to travel 40 miles to a 
landfill, said Tony Harris, spokesman for the city Department of Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
With the controversial Lopez Canyon facility near Lake View Terrace the only 
city-owned landfill still in operation, city officials have increasingly looked 
to recycling as a way to reduce the amount of waste going into dumps.

GRADUATING SENIORS CAN SLEEP BIT LONGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For graduating seniors at Cal State Northridge, the first day of the rest of 
their lives will start a little later. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to complaints from students and parents, the university said it will 
change the start of spring graduation ceremonies on May 26 from 7 a.m. to 11 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
School administrators had announced the 7 a.m. start time last month, hoping 
the early hour would avoid hot temperatures and be symbolic of a new beginning 
for graduates. 
</P>
<P>
"We had thought that the students would be excited about it," university 
spokeswoman Ann Salisbury said. "That didn't happen. . . . You have to listen 
to what the students want." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the 4,650 graduating students and their parents complained to 
university officials that they would have to wake before dawn to attend the 
ceremony at the Hollywood Bowl.

PETS ARE NOT FOOD IN U.S., SPCA WILL ADVISE IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PENELOPE McMILLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is putting 
together an educational campaign to teach immigrants that American culture 
"does not tolerate the consumption of dogs and other domestic pets as food," 
according to Edward C. Cubrda, the group's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of a controversial court case this month involving two Cambodian 
refugees who ate a German shepherd puppy, Cubrda said his organization will try 
in particular to reach immigrants from countries such as Cambodia, Korea, 
Vietnam and the Philippines, where dogs are reputedly considered delicacies. 
</P>
<P>
Cubrda said he does not know precisely what form the campaign will take, but 
John Larkhart, who handles public relations for the organization, said the SPCA 
is "networking with members of the Asian community groups to help us." The 
group may, for example, "pull together recipes, with meat substitutes and other 
things that can be used, not pet-type meats from dogs and cats," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Accepted Custom 
</P>
<P>
Eating dogs or pet animals is an exception, not accepted custom, and not one 
transferred when people move to America, some Asians here said. 
</P>
<P>
In South Korea, however, where reporters covering the Olympics last year 
commented on the availability of dog meat, Los Angeles psychologist Soo Chang, 
director of Asian Pacific Services of the YWCA, said dog is considered "a 
gourmet food. People use it especially in the summertime, saying it gives them 
extra energy." Men believe that it increases their virility, she added. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all a matter of perspective," said a Chinatown professional, who asked 
that his name not be used. "When I first came here my uncle took me for prime 
rib and it was very rare," he noted. "In terms of cultural subtleties, I 
thought eating barely cooked meat was barbaric." 
</P>
<P>
Due to the recent case of the Cambodian refugees and the puppy, members of the 
Cambodian community are sensitive about the issue. Nil Hul, executive director 
of the Cambodian Assn. of America, maintained that "nobody does it." But he 
added: "We started an educational campaign the first day the case was in the 
newspapers, with flyers and radio broadcasts in Cambodian. We told the 
community you (have) got to abide not only the law, but the norms of society." 
</P>
<P>
Changes in state law are also needed, SPCA's Cubrda said, because according to 
the state Penal Code, "There's nothing to prohibit you from killing your pet in 
order to eat it, as long as it's done humanely." 
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian case was dismissed in Long Beach Municipal Court. Judge Bradford 
L. Andrews found there was not enough evidence to show that the puppy had been 
killed inhumanely.

GATES' DISMAY FORCES 2 AIDES TO SELL STOCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM OVEREND, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the urging of Chief Daryl F. Gates, two officials of the Los Angeles Police 
Department -- one a civilian computer manager and the other the department's 
chief spokesman -- have sold their stock in a company that will provide the 
city with an electronic stolen-car recovery system. 
</P>
<P>
The stock sale followed a meeting of top LAPD officials last week at which 
Gates expressed dismay that any of his top aides would have purchased stock in 
LoJack Corp., the Massachusetts firm involved in the project. 
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned about this. I would hope the top staff of this department 
wouldn't buy any LoJack stock," Gates said. "Given the sensitivity of the 
project, I wish no one had bought any stock." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bought Stock Last Year 
</P>
<P>
Gates spoke out after learning that Charles Drescher, civilian commanding 
officer of LAPD's information resource division, and Cmdr. William Booth, the 
department's chief spokesman since 1977, both had purchased LoJack stock last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, LoJack Corp. was lobbying for passage of state legislation that 
would have permitted it to set up operations throughout California. The 
legislation was dropped, however, after an amendment was introduced that would 
have forced the firm to share its technology with rival companies. 
</P>
<P>
LoJack and the LAPD then began talks that led in March to unanimous passage by 
the City Council of a contract in which the firm will provide the city with 
$1.5 million in computers and electronic tracking devices in exchange for the 
right to sell car security transponders to the public. 
</P>
<P>
With the LoJack system, police can track stolen cars using small transmitting 
devices hidden in the vehicles and tracking devices in patrol cars that can 
monitor the movements of the stolen vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
In urging his top officials to avoid buying stock in LoJack, Gates stressed 
that he saw no conflict of interest in the actions of Drescher and Booth. But, 
he said, the LAPD views its contract with LoJack as sensitive because the 
company holds a temporary monopoly on the technology required to plug into its 
recovery system. 
</P>
<P>
While Gates avoided any rebuke of Booth for buying 400 shares of LoJack stock 
last year, he singled out Drescher for criticism, calling his purchase of 500 
shares a "very unfortunate" decision. 
</P>
<P>
Booth, Gates said, "certainly doesn't make decisions about this issue. As for 
Drescher, he's not in the line (of command on LoJack), but he does have 
department computer and information systems. I think it was very poor taste and 
very poor judgement." 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the comments from Gates, at a meeting with The Times and five top 
LAPD commanders last Wednesday, Booth immediately sold his stock, which he had 
purchased for about $3 a share, making a profit of about $500. 
</P>
<P>
"I suffer no feelings of conflict or anything wrong, but I do wish I had never 
bought it," Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
Drescher, who purchased his shares at $5 last July, sold his shares Monday at a 
slight loss. He said he saw no conflict at the time he bought the stock, but 
had begun to wonder about the issue and was happy to dispose of the stock in 
view of Gates' comments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contract Defended 
</P>
<P>
Gates defended LAPD's contract with LoJack, a firm that so far operates in 
Massachusetts and Florida. In an earlier controversy, a Massachusetts State 
Police officer drew criticism for profiting from LoJack stock. 
</P>
<P>
"All I want to do is solve the damn auto theft problem and this seems to be a 
way to do it," Gates said. "I don't see how we can lose. They are giving us the 
equipment. They are also giving us a contract that says it can be broken if 
somebody else comes along." 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who introduced the proposed contract with 
LoJack in the City Council, first uncovered Drescher's purchase of stock and 
criticized LAPD officials for not keeping Gates and the City Council better 
informed of any possible controversies relating to LoJack. 
</P>
<P>
"I do think the higher-ups need to be sensitive to the problems being 
presented," Yaroslavsky said. "This is an issue of public trust." 
</P>
<P>
The LAPD said that all its employees directly involved with LoJack have 
promised not to purchase stock in the company. 
</P>
<P>
According to LoJack officials, the company's earlier stock controversy involved 
a Massachusetts police official who allegedly made a profit in LoJack stock 
while involved in testing the system. 
</P>
<P>
LoJack President C. Michael Daley said the firm, after a management 
reorganization three years ago, has been expanding its sales and has launched 
an aggressive national marketing program.

STUDENTS MOURN TEACHER SHOT TO DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Grant High School students on Monday mourned a popular longtime teacher and 
senior class adviser who was fatally shot last week by an unknown assassin 
outside of his Sherman Oaks home. 
</P>
<P>
School administrators and senior class representatives spent much of the day 
sharing their grief, as well as their determination to complete plans for the 
year-end senior activities that teacher and class adviser Hal Arthur had 
started. Arthur, 60, was shot and killed Friday morning as he was leaving for 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"You've been chosen by your class to be the leaders and sometimes it's a hard 
role," said Grant High Principal Bob Collins to a meeting of student body 
officers. The students are planning a memorial service on the Van Nuys campus 
Thursday to honor Arthur, who had taught history and government classes at the 
school since 1962. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Basically in Shock' 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is basically in shock right now," said Helen Edelstein, the senior 
class secretary. She and other students say they still cannot believe that 
anyone would want to harm Arthur. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police detectives said they have no suspects or motive in the 
slaying. A 16-year-old former Grant student was questioned for six hours Friday 
and then released. "We were convinced at the end of the discussion with him 
that he was not involved," Lt. Warren Knowles said. 
</P>
<P>
The student, in an interview Monday, said police gave him a polygraph test and 
for several hours asked questions about his whereabouts on Friday. But he said 
that he does not even know Arthur. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sad what happened, but I was home in bed," the boy said. "I'm not a bad 
guy and I'm not a trouble-maker." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Year-End Activities 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, senior officers began the job of preparing for the flurry of 
year-end activities, such as the prom and graduation, that Arthur had organized 
for senior classes at Grant for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"There's the gowns and the invitations, ordering everything, picking colors, 
everything that comes with being a senior he knew about because of his 
experience," said Karen Berelowitz, the senior class historian. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur was a friend to his fifth-period senior leadership class, his students 
said. He spoke often of his travels and "knew about everything," said Janna 
Talbot, the senior vice president.

"I came in to talk to him on Thursday, I was sick and the last thing he said to 
me was, 'Take care,' " Talbot said. "That was typical. He cared a lot about 
students and you felt it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Easy-Going Style 
</P>
<P>
Arthur wore a Grant team jacket that had "Hal Baby" stitched on the front. He 
earned the nickname because of his easy-going style in dealing with the many 
vendors that did business for senior class activities, the students said. 
</P>
<P>
Senior class officers decided over the weekend to dedicate the senior lawn quad 
area in memory of Arthur. They spent only a few minutes deciding what to put on 
the plaque that will be placed on the senior lawn: 
</P>
<P>
"Hal Arthur, devoted teacher, caring senior sponsor and an inspiration to all." 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't a teacher to us," Berelowitz said. "He was our friend."

JIM MURRAY: WHITTINGHAM IS QUIETLY TOUTING SUNDAY SILENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Charlie Whittingham has been training race horses as far back as he, or anyone 
else, can remember. He can't tell you what Man o' War was like, but he saw Phar 
Lap. 
</P>
<P>
He started out in the days when racing was legal in only a few places on this 
continent and he got his early training around the barns and walking rings of 
Caliente where in those anything-goes days some trainers used to put heroin on 
the tongues of horses to get their attention. "I don't know if it made them run 
faster but it improved their disposition some," Charlie recalls. 
</P>
<P>
Not much a horse -- or horseman -- does, surprises Charlie. Whatever it is, 
chances are he has seen it before. He stares at the world with these bright 
blue eyes that always seem to be looking at something no one else can see. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie gypsied around the country with the best of them in the days when 
racing would drop its tack wherever the politicians or the Bible Belters would 
let it. He learned how to get a horse and a meeting ready at the same time 
under some of the legendary racetrackers of the day -- Senor Horatio Luro, for 
example. He kept a low profile. Charlie talked just more than a horse. He was 
part of that long line of horsemen who worked their colts in the dark so the 
clockers wouldn't be able to get a good look -- and a time -- on them. 
</P>
<P>
They called him "The Bald Eagle" around a track. Charlie lost his hair a long 
time ago. It fell out when he contracted malaria on a landing with the 2nd 
Marines on Guadalcanal in 1943. Charlie doesn't want any medals. "It might have 
fell out anyway," he shrugs. "There was baldness on my mother's side." Charlie 
just shaved it all off and got on with it. He always wore a hat anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie was as restless as a 2-year-old in his first gate. He always seemed 
ill-at-ease away from shed row. He tried a vacation in the Bahamas once but it 
was too far from the action. He prowls a race track like a hungry cat. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie didn't spread himself thin like other trainers. He didn't keep a string 
in New York, Florida, the Midwest or the bayous. He had his own wheel, 
California, and he rolled nothing but winners. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie didn't win the most races of any trainer on the tracks, just the 
richest. He reeled off Santa Anita Handicaps (seven), Hollywood Gold Cups 
(eight), and more stake races (543) and more hundred-thousand-dollar races 
(206) than any trainer in history. If you brought your horse west of the 
Tehachapis, you had Charlie's horses to beat. 
</P>
<P>
But, if there was one flaw in Charlie's career, one blind spot in his outlook, 
it was the Kentucky Derby. Charlie thought it was just another horse race. A 
sucker bet, actually. It was too early in the year, too far away, too long. It 
used up your horse. Charlie would rather save him for later in the year when 
the purses were grander and the races easier. Anyway, California horses were 
betting into a pat hand. Racing on harder tracks against easier company, they 
would look like rubes in a subway rush when they got in the Kentucky field. 
</P>
<P>
And, then, Charlie won one. 
</P>
<P>
It happened three years ago. Charlie finally had a horse who looked as if he 
wouldn't faint at the head of the stretch in Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
Ferdinand never put anybody in mind of Phar Lap. He had five races as a 
2-year-old and won only one of them. But he was out of the money in only one of 
them. Charlie liked him. He was a puncher. "This horse will win the Kentucky 
Derby," he told the rider, Bill Shoemaker, at Del Mar when Ferdinand was a 
2-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
So, he went back to Kentucky, a 73-year-old trainer with a 3-year-old horse and 
a 54-year-old rider, and the press couldn't believe their good luck. They 
dubbed the entry "The Sunshine Boys" and pulled all the stops. It was a 
scenario right out of Disney. All you needed was Walter Brennan and a 
harmonica. The last roundup. 
</P>
<P>
The hardboots were less sentimental than the rest of the world. They let the 
horse and the Shoe -- and Whittingham -- get away at 17-1. They weren't into 
any corny Hollywood endings. 
</P>
<P>
Big mistake. 
</P>
<P>
But, if Charlie wasn't shocked at the outcome of the race, he was overwhelmed 
at the reaction of the rest of the country. Here was a man who had won 2,000 
races and the public reacted as if it were his first. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie was on crack-of-dawn television shows, magazine covers, banquet daises. 
People gave him parties. He got fan letters. So did the horse. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie had thought he was a celebrity. Now, he found out what celebrity was. 
He thought he had just won another Grade 1 stakes. They say around the race 
tracks, if you go to heaven and tell St. Peter you're a horse trainer or a race 
car driver, he frowns and consults a list. If you say you won the Kentucky 
Derby or the Indy 500, he says "Go right in!" 
</P>
<P>
Charlie had gone back to Louisville previously with a couple of no-chance colts 
belonging to the late Liz Whitney, who always overestimated her racers. Gone 
Fishin' and Diving Comedy ran down the track. As Charlie could have told her. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie still won't go back to Louisville with some overblown plating horse 
with delusions of grandeur. But, this year, he's getting that look in the eye 
again. Charlie has a colt by Halo, the sire who already has a Kentucky Derby 
winner in his pedigree. The 3-year-old Sunday Silence looks to Charlie as if he 
can run some. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence has not been breaking clocks. But, neither did Ferdinand. Sunday 
Silence has run five times and never been worse than second. Charlie put him in 
against the wonder colt, Houston, who is supposed to be able to do everything 
but talk, and Sunday Silence was all over the race track in the stretch and 
still lost only by a head. "He doesn't like to get beat," grins Charlie. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie likes that in a horse. 
</P>
<P>
The sporting press won't get The Sunshine Boys Part II if Sunday Silence gets 
to Louisville. Patrick Valenzuela, who has ridden Sunday Silence in all three 
of his wins, is just a little bit older than the horse. 
</P>
<P>
Can Charlie get his second Kentucky Derby? Or, his first Preakness or Belmont? 
</P>
<P>
It first hinges on the Santa Anita Derby April 8. Whether Houston comes West 
for it or not, Sunday Silence must do well in the Derby here (Ferdinand was 
third). You get a good clue into Charlie's orientation when you know that, of 
the 2,140 races he has won, only one is a Santa Anita Derby. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't that Charlie wants to get stopped for his autograph or wants to have 
people know him on sight. Charlie, no social butterfly, is always where 
everybody already knows him. And, if you're ever looking for him, try the 
winners' circle.

THE NBA / SAM MCMANIS; 
</P>
<P>
LIKE W.C. FIELDS, 76ER WOULD RATHER BE IN PHILADELPHIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Gminski signed a long-term contract with the Philadelphia 76ers last week, 
but if he hadn't, he says he could have become a Laker. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, that is of little consolation to the Lakers, who will go on the 
market for a replacement for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Gminski, the only potential unrestricted free agent center of any real value 
after the season, signed a reported four-year, $7 million contract extension. 
"With L.A. in the postion they are in on the West Coast, that was a viable 
alternative," Gminski said. "But that would've meant a drastic life style 
change. I'm happy all this is behind me." 
</P>
<P>
Now, it appears the Lakers will have to trade for a center or decide to use 
Mychal Thompson at center and spend the $1.5 million (half of Abdul-Jabbar's 
salary) the salary cap will let them spend on a non-center. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the league, interest is high in the Clippers' Benoit Benjamin, who 
will be a restricted free agent. The Lakers reportedly would like to sign 
Benjamin, but it is likely the Clippers would match any offer sheet to avoid 
their center moving cross-town. 
</P>
<P>
Gminski is averaging 17 points and 9.5 rebounds a game, ranking him sixth among 
NBA starting centers. But because he was the only quality free-agent center 
available with no dominant centers in college eligible for the NBA draft, his 
market value soared. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny, even when I look at game films of myself, it doesn't look like I'm 
doing a lot," Gminski said. "But you pick up box score at end of night, and 
I've got 18 or 19 points, a couple of blocked shots, maybe 12 rebounds, a few 
assists and I've played good defense. I just don't do things in a flashy 
manner, that's my personality. I guess underrated is the best way to describe 
my game." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, Golden State Warrior Coach Don Nelson returned to Milwaukee, 
where he coached for 11 seasons, for the first time since his resignation two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
After arriving Sunday night, friends of Nelson provided a limo to take him to 
the team's hotel. Nelson declined and rode on the team bus. Later Sunday night, 
there was an invitation-only dinner in Nelson's honor. Still later Sunday 
night, the Miller Brewing Co. threw a "Welcome Back Don Nelson" party. 
</P>
<P>
Monday afternoon, Nelson spoke to the Wisconsin "Pen and Mike Club." Then, 
there was a luncheon in his honor. After the Warriors played the Bucks, another 
welcome back party was scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson was involved in charity work in Milwaukee, but current Buck Coach Del 
Harris, a former Nelson assistant, said Nelson's popularity came from a more 
conventional source. 
</P>
<P>
"He won," Harris said. "If he hadn't won, he wouldn't have been popular. What 
makes you popular is not farm funds and charity golf tournaments and things 
like that. It's winning basketball games." 
</P>
<P>
Said Nelson of his return: "I had a special relationship there that a person 
doesn't get back in his lifetime. I had a relationship with the city and state 
where I always felt we were one. . . . I thought I'd be there the rest of my 
life. As far as I know, I only have one enemy in Milwaukee, and he just happens 
to be the owner of the club (Herb Kohl)." 
</P>
<P>
Add Nelson: There was a strange controversy last week involving the Warriors, 
the Portland Trail Blazers, Bigfoot and Tony Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
It all came about last Tuesday, when the Trail Blazers beat the Warriors in 
Portland. In that game, Bigfoot, the Trail Blazers' mascot, brought a model of 
the Golden Gate bridge to midcourt and, while the public address system played 
"I left My Heart in San Francisco," stomped on it with his foot. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors got their revenge last Tuesday in Oakland, beating Portland, 
151-127. 
</P>
<P>
"That (stunt) didn't go over with me at all," Nelson said. "They were 30 points 
ahead of us, and they poked fun at us. I've been waiting for this game. I 
wanted to have a comeback victory, and the team gave it to me. I wanted to get 
150 points on them, and we did. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't rub stuff like that in on a team that's getting smoked. I wouldn't 
allow it here." 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, Philadelphia's Charles Barkley said the Atlanta Hawks were the 
league's most selfish team and that "they'll never win because the NBA only 
lets you play with one ball." 
</P>
<P>
Hawk Coach Mike Fratello was so angered he brought the newspaper article to 
practice and stomped his foot on it. 
</P>
<P>
But last week, after Atlanta lost seven of 10 games, Fratello stomped all over 
his team. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I think Charles Barkley was right," Fratello said. "Some of our 
people don't want to recognize the problem. They don't want to submerge their 
egos." 
</P>
<P>
Said center Moses Malone: "We got too many individuals on this team. You can't 
win if you don't play as a team. We don't play as a team. That's why we lose. 
</P>
<P>
"The coaches prepare us to play a team game. The players don't do it. I can't 
blame the coaches for the way we play. If we keep playing like this, we won't 
have home court (advantage) at all in the playoffs. We'll make it tougher on 
ourselves. I'm not saying we can't win. I'm saying we can't keep playing like 
this and accomplish anything. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to take pride in what you do; I don't see it here. I didn't come here 
to lose." 
</P>
<P>
The self criticism must have helped the Hawks. On Saturday, they handed the New 
York Knicks only their third home-court loss this season. 
</P>
<P>
NBA Notes 
</P>
<P>
Larry Bird update: Originally, the Boston Celtics hoped for Bird's return from 
Achilles' tendon surgery on March 1. It was amended to March 8, then March 15. 
Now, the Celtics are saying that Bird will only return if he can help the club 
during the playoffs. Bird has not practiced with the Celtics since March 10 and 
Celtic doctors say that his right Achilles is only 70% healed. The Celtics, 
however, are starting to make a move without Bird. With a victory over the 
Philadelphia 76ers on Sunday, Boston improved its record to three games over 
.500 for the first time this season and moved to within 1 1/2 games of 
Philadelphia for the Eastern Conference's seventh playoff spot. . . . Portland 
Coach Rick Adelman on Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls: "They can beat 
anybody in the playoffs. If they can just keep the games close, they can win. 
If the game is close at the end, the ball is going to be in (Jordan's) hands." 
. . . The bad timing award of the week goes to Miami Heat center Rony Seikaly, 
who missed a game last week against the Phoenix Suns after having two wisdom 
teeth removed. Turns out, the Suns' promotion that night was Dental Health 
Night, in which young fans received free tooth brushes. . . . Charles Barkley, 
one of the most quotable players in the league, was strangely humble (i.e., 
boring) on Friday night against San Antonio after making all 10 shots he 
attempted from the field and all nine free-throw attempts. Barkley said, "I 
played well, but that's what I get paid for." Barkley is better when he's not 
the subject. When someone recently noted that it looked as if Atlanta's Moses 
Malone had lost weight, Barkley replied: "That's because he's going bald."

BUSS SUED BY ADVERTISING FIRM FOR $72 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Inglewood advertising firm has filed a $72 million suit against Jerry Buss, 
owner of the Lakers and the Forum, claiming breach of contract, conversion of 
funds, deceit, fraud and defamation. 
</P>
<P>
In the suit, filed March 10 in Los Angeles County Superior Court, H&amp;H 
Sports, Inc., charges that Buss and California Sports, Buss' corporation, 
violated verbal and written contracts and used money due the advertising firm 
without its knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
Neither James Hunkins nor Steven Hohensee, owners of H&amp;H Sports, the firm 
that sells television and newspaper advertising as well as corporate sign space 
inside the Forum, could be reached Monday. 
</P>
<P>
George Schulman, an attorney representing H&amp;H Sports, Inc., said that the 
firm "made a great deal of money for Buss, and he did not hold up his end, even 
though he kept promising to do so." 
</P>
<P>
Schulman said Buss has until April 27 to answer the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Steiner, a spokesman for California Sports, said Buss will not comment 
while the matter is in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
In the 12 complaints listed in the suit, H&amp;H Sports is seeking in excess of 
$72 million, plus punitive damages. The suit also asks for an accounting from 
Buss' books to determine the actual sum owed H&amp;H Sports. 
</P>
<P>
"The acts of Buss were malicious and oppressive and were carried out because of 
Buss' feelings of hatred or ill-will toward H&amp;H Sports, and because of 
Buss' desire to terminate the contract and misappropriate H&amp;H Sports' 
established customers and business," the suit says. 
</P>
<P>
Among the allegations: 
</P>
<P>
 -- That Buss, when starting the Prime Ticket cable network in 1984, promised 
to sell H&amp;H Sports one-third of the network for $3.2 million if it would 
sell advertising at a lower commission and make Prime Ticket financially 
viable. "Buss made the promises fraudulently with the intent to deceive and 
mislead H&amp;H Sports and at no time did Buss ever intend to comply with these 
promises," the suit contends. 
</P>
<P>
 -- That Buss, in 1986, failed to follow through on the terms of a $200,000 
loan he received from H&amp;H Sports and converted the money due the 
advertising firm even before asking for the loan. 
</P>
<P>
The suit contends that Buss promised to extend H&amp;H Sports' contract with 
Prime Ticket through 1994 and provide the firm a note for the $200,000 at an 
interest rate of 2% above the prime lending rate, payable in one year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- After Buss sold controlling interest in Prime Ticket in 1988, Prime Ticket 
terminated its contract with firm. The suit says that Buss contacted H&amp;H 
Sports' clients and informed them that the H&amp;H Sports had overcharged the 
clients. The suit claims that Buss set and approved all prices. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Great Western Bank was a client of H&amp;H Sports when Buss began 
negotiations to change the Forum's name to the Great Western Forum. 
</P>
<P>
In order to avoid paying H&amp;H Sports commissions entitled to it when the 
agreement with Great Western Bank was made, Buss allegedly delayed agreeing to 
terms with the bank until last November after terminating the firm's exclusive 
representation of Buss.

DODGER NOTEBOOK; 
</P>
<P>
SEARAGE STAKES CLAIM TO A SPOT IN BULLPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON EDES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In one of the most improbable developments of the spring, left-handed reliever 
Ray Searage -- who has kicked around organized baseball since 1976 and has a 
total of 16 major-league decisions -- has all but won a spot on the Dodgers' 
pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
It's not official, but after the Dodgers' 5-3 exhibition win over the New York 
Mets Monday, it appears that Searage -- who has not allowed an earned run in 
six innings over his last three appearances -- will join Ricky Horton as the 
left-handers in the Dodger bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
Searage, who will be 34 on May 1, originally was drafted by the St. Louis 
Cardinals. He never pitched in the big leagues for the Cardinals, but had 
stints with the Mets, Milwaukee Brewers and Chicago White Sox before signing 
with the Dodgers as a free agent last April. 
</P>
<P>
He spent last season in Albuquerque, where he made 51 appearances in relief and 
had eight saves with a 5.10 earned run average. With a change in his delivery, 
Searage is throwing harder this spring and with William Brennan -- one of the 
other leading candidates for the 10th spot on the staff -- getting lit up for 
six runs and eight hits in four innings of the Dodgers' 10-4 loss to Atlanta in 
a split-squad game, Searage moved ahead of the field. 
</P>
<P>
If he's still on the roster today, Searage's $141,000 salary will be 
guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers, in a procedural move to keep pitcher Jeff Fischer, sent 
minor-league catcher Gilberto Reyes to the Montreal Expos. The Dodgers drafted 
Fischer from the Expos last winter, and under the rules of the winter draft, 
would have had to send Fischer back to the Expos if he didn't make the 
major-league roster. The deal for Reyes eliminated that requirement. 
</P>
<P>
Ramon Martinez, who gave up two runs on three hits in five innings against the 
Mets, appears a likely candidate to start the season in Albuquerque, assuming 
that Mike Morgan -- scheduled to pitch today against the New York Yankees -- 
shows enough to win the No. 5 starting position. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a good changeup and good fastball," said Manager Tom Lasorda, still not 
satisfied with Martinez's progress with his curve ball. "If he were to start 
the season with us now, those are the pitches he'd have to get by on right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson was a spectator Monday and Lasorda strongly suggested that the 
sore-shouldered, flu-weakened outfielder will not be with the team when it 
opens the season Monday in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to ask him to do something he can't do if he's not ready to play 
up to his capabilities," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Marshall, who also has missed a week with the flu, worked out Monday, but 
did not play. 
</P>
<P>
Third baseman Jeff Hamilton, who had been out with a pulled muscle in his 
thigh, played in the game against the Braves. Jay Howell, also stricken by the 
flu, hasn't pitched in nine days.

For the 12th time in 13 seasons, Stewart Cliburn will begin the year in the 
minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Cliburn met with Manager Doug Rader, General Manager Mike Port and pitching 
coach Marcel Lachemann Monday and listened calmly as they explained he was 
being sent to Edmonton, the Angels' triple-A farm team. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't new," Cliburn said. "It's never fun, but it's the nature of the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Cliburn was 9-3 with six saves in 1985 as set-up man for Donnie Moore and then, 
after two years of arm problems in the minors, he returned to the Angels last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
He was 4-2 with a 4.07 earned-run average in 40 appearances in 1989, but has 
been struggling this spring. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wasn't very sharp the last couple of outings," said Cliburn, who 
allowed seven hits and five runs in 2 1/3 innings Thursday. "There's nothing 
wrong physically. It's not like I can't pitch anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not the kind of pitcher who will impress a new manager in one outing. I 
have to impress over the course of a season. When you're the ninth or 10th 
pitcher on a squad, you know you have to go out and win a spot. I haven't been 
very impressive lately." 
</P>
<P>
Rader said Cliburn still is in the Angels' plans, however, and that the 
32-year-old right-hander simply needs to work out a few kinks in his delivery 
that have kept his pitches up. 
</P>
<P>
When Cliburn is up, he doesn't get outs. 
</P>
<P>
"Stewart Cliburn has a good arm," Rader said. "I think he'll be able to pitch 
in the big leagues again. He just needs to figure out how to keep the ball 
down. When he gets the ball up, it's not a very forgiving area for him." 
</P>
<P>
Cliburn says he will keep his chin up, work on keeping his pitches down and 
wait for the Angels to call him in Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
"Doug Rader didn't see me at my best, but I'll impress him somewhere down the 
line," he said, managing a smile. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Jim Abbott seemed more upset about the news than Cliburn, even though 
Abbott seems assured of making the 24-man roster. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard for me to feel good about my situation," Abbott said. "When I came 
out to Anaheim (this winter) by myself, Stewart went out of his way to take me 
out to breakfast a couple of times. He's been a good friend. It's kind of tough 
to see him go." 
</P>
<P>
Abbott may have been a dark-horse candidate to make the team, but pitcher Vance 
Lovelace was an even longer shot when camp opened this spring. 
</P>
<P>
If the Angels do keep 11 pitchers, Lovelace has made the team. If they go with 
10, the 6-foot-5, 25-year-old left-hander will be battling Abbott for the No. 
10 spot. 
</P>
<P>
Lovelace is 0-1 with a 5.40 ERA in five innings this spring. 
</P>
<P>
The Angel staff, as it appears now: Starters Mike Witt, Kirk McCaskill, Chuck 
Finley, Bert Blyleven, and Dan Petry or Abbott; relievers Willie Fraser, Greg 
Minton, Bob McClure, Bryan Harvey and Lovelace. 
</P>
<P>
In other roster moves Monday, utility man Darrell Miller was given his 
unconditional release; the contract of outfielder Marcus Lawton was returned to 
Tidewater of the International League (the Mets' triple-A affiliate) and 
pitcher Terry Clark was placed on the 21-day disabled list, retroactive to 
March 19. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, who hit .241 in parts of five seasons with the Angels, had a .221 
batting average and appeared in 70 games last season. Miller cleared out his 
locker and left Palm Springs early Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We released him out of deference to the human being," Rader said. "Darrell 
said he didn't think he should have to go back to Edmonton for the fifth time 
and I think he's right. That's above and beyond the call of duty." 
</P>
<P>
Miller, used as an outfielder, a catcher, pinch-hitter and designated hitter, 
had one hit in eight at-bats this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Bert Blyleven pitched six innings, allowing four hits and one run Monday as the 
Angels beat the San Diego Padres, 2-1, in front of 4,113 at Angels Stadium. 
Bryan Harvey picked up his fifth save of the spring. . . . Manager Doug Rader 
said he wants to cut the roster to 24 as soon as possible. "There will be full 
documentation as soon as we can justify it," he said after being asked for the 
umpteenth time about Jim Abbott's status. "I don't see any point in prolonging 
the agony for anyone." . . . Marc Johnson, 7, of Yucaipa, was hit in the head 
by a line drive off the bat of Claudell Washington during batting practice 
Monday. Johnson, who suffered a concussion, was taken to Desert Hospital and 
held overnight for observation.

NEWSWIRE: STILL TRYING TO MAKE BOGGS DEAL, RED SOX REPORTEDLY TALK WITH ROYALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Boston Red Sox, stepping up their attempts to trade controversial star Wade 
Boggs, talked to the Kansas City Royals last weekend about a deal for the 
five-time American League batting champion. 
</P>
<P>
Royals General Manager John Schuerholz told the Kansas City Star that talks 
have taken place but would not identify the Royal players involved and said 
chances of a deal are slim. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals executive described Boggs' personal problems as "somewhat 
disconcerting." 
</P>
<P>
The revelations resulting from Boggs' relationship with Margo Adams have 
troubled Red Sox brass, which was further angered by his appearance last week 
with Barbara Walters on "20/20." The team has since stepped up efforts to trade 
Boggs.

Atlanta Braves right-hander Bruce Sutter, who has undergone three operations on 
his right rotator cuff, has suffered another tear in it that may end his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
Sutter left the Braves' spring training camp Sunday. Sutter, 36, missed nearly 
two seasons after undergoing surgery to the same shoulder. He underwent the 
operations on the shoulder between September 1985 and February 1987. He ranks 
third on the all-time major league save list with 300, behind Rollie Fingers 
(341) and Goose Gossage (302). 
</P>
<P>
Sutter signed a six-year, $10.6 million contract in 1984 with the Braves.

Former Texas A&amp;M football Coach Jackie Sherrill's contract called for an 
initial base salary of $95,000 when he was hired Jan. 6, 1982, but increased to 
$185,120 by the time A&amp;M bought out his contract three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Bryan-College Station, Tex., Eagle obtained a copy of Sherrill's contract 
last week under the Texas Open Records Act. It showed that Sherrill also had a 
separate arrangement with A&amp;M for his services on the "Jackie Sherrill 
Show," a highlight program that ran weekly during football seasons. At the time 
of the buyout, the talent contract was worth $142,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The contract called for an automatic salary increase of at least 10% annually, 
or the percentage increase of the average faculty salary, whichever was 
greater. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Sherrill received a month's base pay for each bowl appearance "in 
order to compensate for the extra time needed to prepare for the appearance and 
for the tangible benefit derived by (A&amp;M) from such appearance." 
</P>
<P>
The university also provided Sherrill with a car and required him to be a 
member of Briarcrest Country Club in Bryan -- at university expense -- because, 
"It is the desire of the University that Sherrill be active in the affairs of 
the community, maintain good alumni relations, vigorously recruit student 
athletes, esteem himself socially and morally, act as a spokesman for the Texas 
A&amp;M University Athletic Department." 
</P>
<P>
In an agreement not mentioned in the contract, A&amp;M provided a five-year 
$150,000 loan to Sherrill for the purchase of his home. Twenty percent of the 
loan was written off by A&amp;M for each year Sherrill was employed. 
</P>
<P>
Last September, the NCAA put A&amp;M on probation for two years for violations 
of several regulations. A number of other sanctions were imposed but under the 
terms of Sherrill's contract, the sanctions were not enough to cause his 
dismissal.

COMPULSIVE GAMBLING: A NEW ROUND OF VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY LIBMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 12 years, Diane played poker in Gardena casinos nightly until 4:30 a.m. 
While regularly kiting checks and stealing from her husband and children to 
finance her habit, she quit her job because she believed she could earn a 
living gambling. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny also gambled in Gardena -- three nights during the week and all weekend. 
Although he counted cards well and won regularly at blackjack in Nevada 
casinos, he didn't feel the narcoticlike rush he got from poker. So he played 
poker all night unless he ran out of money and couldn't finagle more. 
Frequently he left the casino crying and vowing never to return, but he did -- 
for the better part of eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Diane, a great-grandmother who lives in West Los Angeles, and Johnny, a black 
teacher from Los Angeles, represent segments of society -- women and non-whites 
-- who experts say become compulsive gamblers more commonly than had been 
thought. Both Diane and Johnny, who asked that their last names not be used, 
now belong to Gamblers Anonymous, an organization patterned after Alcoholics 
Anonymous and founded in Los Angeles 32 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Although Cincinnati Reds Manager Pete Rose grabbed headlines recently for 
alleged sports betting as prodigious as his 4,256 career hits, and although 
compulsive gambling is commonly perceived as the province of white, middle-aged 
males like Rose, a study conducted for the National Institute of Mental Health 
found that women comprised 34% of all problem gamblers in New York, New Jersey 
and Maryland. The figure for non-white minorities was 39%. The extent of the 
problem nationwide and in California is not known, but experts agree that more 
women and non-whites are seeking treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"I see more women and non-whites," said Dr. Robert Custer, a Bethesda, Md., 
psychiatrist who specializes in compulsive gambling and lectures around the 
world. "When I started 15 years ago, I would say they were probably around 5% 
of my patients. Now it's approaching 30%. I assume that by the turn of the 
century it will be 50%." 
</P>
<P>
"We find a much higher proportion of women, blacks, Hispanics and Asians in 
treatment programs, and their numbers are increasing," said Dr. Durand F. 
Jacobs, chief of psychology service for the Veteran's Administration hospital 
in Loma Linda. "They are acutely involved with problems of a legal, economic, 
marital or psychological nature. Usually they are very depressed and often they 
are suicidal." 
</P>
<P>
Although women and non-whites joining the 15 GA chapters around Los Angeles 
suffer from the same symptoms as men -- chronic and progressive failure to 
resist the impulse to gamble -- they appear to bet differently. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Addicted to Slot Machines 
</P>
<P>
Whereas men more often bet on sports or competitive casino games such as poker 
or blackjack, women become addicted to slot machines, video poker games, bingo 
or lotteries, said Henry Lesieur, a St. John's University sociologist who 
interviewed 50 addicted female gamblers in Reno, Las Vegas and on the East 
Coast. According to Custer, blacks and Latinos commonly wager on sports, the 
lottery or illegal numbers games. 
</P>
<P>
Men and women choose different types of gambling because they are addicted for 
different reasons. A man may bet on horses, Lesieur said, because the 
competition is exciting. "They are into the handicapping. Their intention is to 
win money." Female gamblers, he said, often are trying to relieve loneliness or 
to escape an alcoholic husband or a traumatic past. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Richard J. Rosenthal of Beverly Hills, a psychiatrist who is president of 
the California Council on Compulsive Gambling, said that he has noticed two 
patterns among female gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
"The first woman feels empty and depressed," he said. "She is more apt to be a 
solitary gambler, spending hours in front of the slot machines or playing video 
poker. This may also be the lottery addict. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Social Outlet 
</P>
<P>
"In the second group, loneliness seems most striking and gambling provides a 
social outlet. Competitive aspects are less important than they are with her 
male counterparts. She views the people that she is playing cards with, for 
example, as friends." 
</P>
<P>
Women also start gambling later than men -- in adulthood -- but get hooked 
quickly, Rosenthal said. "Most men start in childhood or early adolescence. A 
boy might lose his collection of baseball cards on a bet at age 6 or 8." 
</P>
<P>
Massive social changes have made it easier for women to be pulled into 
gambling, just as men have been, said Valerie Lorenz, director of the National 
Center for Pathological Gambling in Baltimore, Md. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years ago if someone wanted to gamble on a legal basis, she would have 
to fly to Las Vegas or drive to a race track, which (might) be in the next 
state," Lorenz said. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, society ruled that she had to be accompanied by her husband or 
an escort. Additionally, that took money, big money, and a woman did not have 
it. A woman did not have her own credit card or her own checking account or 
job. 
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays, she has money from her job or her credit card and she can walk down 
the street and use her food money to buy lottery tickets at the grocery store. 
Or she can go play bingo." 
</P>
<P>
Although more women and minorities are entering private treatment or Gamblers 
Anonymous, still only a small fraction of those addicted seek help. Margie, a 
compulsive gambler from Santa Monica, agreed with other GA members that she 
invariably saw only a few women or non-whites at meetings. Experts say many 
newcomers enter the group but don't stay. 
</P>
<P>
"If a woman is going to be the only female in a room with 30 to 50 men at a GA 
meeting, she is going to have a hard time," Rosenthal said. "She may have a 
hard time identifying with their issues as they might with hers. In one 
situation, for example, a woman had been prostituting herself in order to 
continue her gambling habit. If she has to talk about that and is worried that 
the men are going to start hitting on her, it's difficult." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Intimidating to Women 
</P>
<P>
"GA is still a predominantly white-male group," Lorenz said. "It's intimidating 
to women, and some gamblers' wives resent the fact that the husband spends time 
with other gamblers, especially female gamblers, since he spent so much time 
away from home when he was gambling." 
</P>
<P>
Women who succeed in GA say that they joined when their lives had reached 
bottom and they were desperate to break their life style of lying, stealing and 
manipulating. 
</P>
<P>
"When I went in I became sexless," said Diane, a West Los Angeles card player 
who joined the group 25 years ago. "I wasn't a man or a woman. . . . I felt 
completely worthless. I felt like a thing. . . . I wanted a decent life, which 
I knew I was not going to get out there. I couldn't stand the stress of lying 
and cheating and trying to get money." 
</P>
<P>
The male members respected her situation, and today she and other female and 
non-white GA members serenely recount their triumphs, no matter how seemingly 
commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
"One day, on Nov. 20, 1984, I left the casino and two days later I came into 
GA," said Johnny, who has not gambled since. "I was sick and tired of being 
sick and tired." 
</P>
<P>
"When I quit gambling, my credit was not worth a good gosh darn," Diane said. 
"I couldn't have borrowed 10 cents from any bank in the world. Today I have 
triple-A credit and that is a wonderful feeling. I worked hard enough to get it 
up there. When I got my first credit card, I thought it was the most wonderful 
thing in the world."

SIMILAR TO DEFEATED MEASURE A; 
</P>
<P>
O.C. SUPERVISORS MAY OK SLOW-GROWTH PLAN TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN and STEVEN R. CHURM, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scrambling to cope with the impact of explosive growth in south Orange County, 
the Board of Supervisors today is expected to divide unincorporated county 
areas into five growth-management zones, where new development will be tied to 
improvements in roads, libraries, flood control, and police and fire 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, which is expected to be adopted without opposition, developers 
will have to pay for improvements needed to ensure that public facilities meet 
specific service levels, especially traffic flow at intersections. 
</P>
<P>
But the plan, by not requiring developers to correct traffic problems that are 
a result of previous commercial and residential growth, sidesteps objections 
raised in recent court decisions that invalidated slow-growth initiatives 
adopted by voters in San Clemente and San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
The growth-management zones attempt to link neighborhoods that have common 
problems, life styles and facility needs. The area affected by the county's 
plan is expected to grow by an estimated 600,000 people in the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-member citizens' committee that drafted the plan voted to disband last 
Friday. And some members expressed disappointment that more progress has not 
been made on efforts to protect rural areas from urban encroachment. 
</P>
<P>
The panel was appointed by county supervisors a year ago in the heat of a 
petition drive that netted 96,000 signatures on behalf of Measure A, a 
countywide, slow-growth ballot initiative. Measure A failed last June by a 
margin of 56% to 44%, despite strong support in the less-populated southern 
portion of the county. 
</P>
<P>
Approval of the growth-management plan by the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday 
would be a "milestone," said Michael Ruane, the county's director of advance 
planning. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, Ruane said, growth in unincorporated areas, particularly 
the south county, would be phased and managed under a single plan. The plan 
would also require, for the most part, that developers pay for facilities and 
services before any construction can begin, a major feature of Measure A. 
</P>
<P>
Ruane said the plan is an adequate safeguard against unreasonable and 
uncontrolled development, and he called it "as tough a plan as the court would 
allow." 
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased," he said. "It's the foundation for a countywide 
growth-management effort and some interregional cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who appointed the citizens' panel last year when 
she was chairman of the board, said the group has performed as she had hoped. 
"We had to demonstrate (to the public) that we were listening, and this plan 
shows that we did, before the election." 
</P>
<P>
Former Supervisor Bruce Nestande, who headed the panel, said that county 
officials were moving in the direction of such a growth-management plan even 
before the slow-growth forces qualified their ballot initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"I can even make a case that Measure A was a handicap to doing it in a more 
thoughtful manner," said Nestande, now vice chairman of Costa Mesa-based Arnel 
Development Co. "As a result of the initiative process, there was a great deal 
of haste on the part of many developers to get under the protection of 
developer agreements. And now, there's a great deal of confusion about which 
takes precedence -- this plan or a development agreement that the county has 
signed with a developer in good faith." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a major disappointment to environmentalists is that more than 60,000 
new housing units planned for construction during the next 20 years will be 
exempt from the county's growth-management plan because they are protected by 
those so-called developer agreements, in which developers basically agree to 
help fund public facilities, including roads, in exchange for protection from 
future changes in county land-use policies. 
</P>
<P>
Norm Grossman, a committee member on the boards of both Laguna Greenbelt Inc. 
and Citizens for Sensible Growth and Traffic Control, the sponsor of Measure A, 
said he is pleased with the plan. But he said he and some other panelists were 
disappointed that more progress has not been made on efforts to protect rural 
areas and natural resources, such as oak trees and ridgelines. 
</P>
<P>
While anticipating further work by county staff members on the concept of 
buffer zones, Grossman said, the committee has recommended strict enforcement 
of policies barring ridgeline development as an interim step. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing in life is perfect," said Grossman, who contended that no plan would 
have been completed without the pressure of Measure A. He said he is convinced 
that the plan will be enforced because of county officials' plans to place a 
half-cent, countywide sales tax for transportation projects before voters in 
November or sometime next year. Polls show that voters want growth-management 
policies to accompany any plan for spending revenue from such a sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman is on the citizens' committee that is working on the proposed 
sales-tax measure. 
</P>
<P>
John Erskine, executive director of the Orange County Building Industry Assn. 
and a Huntington Beach city councilman who also served on the citizens' 
growth-management committee, said he is happy with the county plan and believes 
it is "tougher than most jurisdictions would tolerate." 
</P>
<P>
Ruane said county officials have 90 days to "fine tune" the plan before 
supervisors will take a final vote on the document. The plan will be reviewed 
annually, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Before the citizens' committee disbanded, it issued a controversial 
recommendation that the county establish rural transition (buffer) zones as 
part of the county's General Plan, a legal document intended to guide county 
housing, zoning, land-use and transportation policies. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists, in particular, believe that such buffer zones between new 
development and wilderness areas are needed to protect ecologically sensitive 
regions, such as the foothills and canyon lands of eastern Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
In those zones, there would be limited development, large tracts of open space, 
and tight controls on use and access. 
</P>
<P>
Incorporating those zones in the General Plan would give those areas a "higher 
stature" or priority, Ruane said, making it more difficult to alter the use of 
that land in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The committee also recommended hiring an ombudsman to answer questions and 
concerns of the public on controversial development projects, and to give the 
county complete control of the environmental review process of development 
projects, which now relies heavily on consultants hired by developers. Both 
actions would improve the county's image and improve the county's credibility 
on development issues, the committee said.

MANSLAUGHTER CHARGE FILED IN BOY'S HIT-AND-RUN DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Orange County district attorney's office Monday filed felony hit-and-run 
and manslaughter charges against a Santa Ana man in connection with the death 
of a 7-year-old Anaheim boy. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Miguel Guerrero, 27, was driving a 1970 Chevrolet Nova from the 
scene of a brawl March 11 when he hit the boy, Victor Magana, in an alley near 
an apartment complex in the 1600 block of South Jeffrey Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Guerrero was arrested Friday and taken to Orange County Jail, where 
he is being held in lieu of $25,000 bail. Police did not release many details 
about the investigation or arrest, but said Guerrero was arrested without 
incident at his business in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"Our investigation placed him behind the wheel of the car," Anaheim Police 
Officer Clint Melberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Police spent almost a week searching for leads in the case before they found 
the Nova -- with license plate 322 ADX -- on Los Flores Street in Fountain 
Valley. But they were unable to locate a suspect until Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police that two men had been fighting in a narrow alleyway 
behind South Jeffrey Drive about 4 p.m. March 11. 
</P>
<P>
One of the men, who appeared to be drunk, jumped into the Nova, police said. He 
drove down the alley, striking two metal posts and a garage door before hitting 
Victor, who was watching the fight. The driver did not stop, and Victor died an 
hour later at a local hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Victor lived with his parents, Celia and Guadalupe Magana, and four brothers 
and sisters. 
</P>
<P>
His parents moved to the United States in 1979 from their native state in 
Michoacan, Mexico. The family had lived in the apartment complex just a block 
west of the Disneyland Hotel for 3 years. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero's pretrial hearing is scheduled Wednesday in Municipal Court, 
Fullerton.

RURAL JAIL INITIATIVE FAILS TO MAKE BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN R. CHURM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A drive to qualify a ballot measure aimed at keeping a new jail out of Santa 
Ana or any Orange County city failed Monday, but leaders of the movement vowed 
to continue battling to have the facility built in a rural area. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young, who has spearheaded the effort since 
September, said supporters of the Rural Jail Initiative had collected "a shade 
under 50,000" signatures by the deadline of 5 p.m. Monday. The group needed the 
signatures of about 65,000 registered voters to qualify the measure for the 
June, 1990, ballot, according to the county registrar of voters. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the setback, an upbeat Young promised to launch new efforts to block 
construction of a 6,720-bed jail in Santa Ana, which he said may include 
another signature-gathering drive to put the issue on the countywide ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately we just ran out of time," Young said Monday of the initiative, 
which would have banned construction of new county jails in any incorporated 
city or within a mile of any school. 
</P>
<P>
"We hoped to make one last push (last) weekend," Young said. "But between the 
rain and Easter, we never had a chance. But I remain committed to preventing 
any new jail from being built in this city or any other place in this county 
where such a facility would be located near schools or homes." 
</P>
<P>
The Rural Jail Initiative was intended to counter another measure that would 
require all future jail facilities be built in Santa Ana. That initiative -- 
sponsored mainly by Anaheim Hills residents organized as Taxpayers for a 
Centralized Jail, who oppose a new jail planned for Gypsum Canyon -- will 
appear on the June, 1990, ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the county is proceeding with plans for a new jail in Gypsum Canyon, 
east of Anaheim Hills and south of the Riverside Freeway. The county, under 
court order to reduce severe overcrowding in existing jail facilities, is in 
the design phase for the Gypsum Canyon jail -- by far the largest of three 
proposed projects in the county's $430-million jail expansion program. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor said he will wait at least two weeks before deciding on the group's 
next move. He supports legislation recently introduced by state Sen. Marian 
Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) that would require that revenues from a proposed 
half-cent sales tax increase for jail construction be spent only on a project 
targeted for a specific site. Such legislation, Young reasoned, would link 
funding for a new jail to the Gypsum Canyon site, which was chosen on a 3-2 
vote of the Board of Supervisors in July, 1987, after more than a decade of 
studies and rancorous debates. 
</P>
<P>
No one has disputed the need for new jail facilities as the inmate population 
has soared in recent years. But there have been continued political battles 
among county supervisors over specific sites, and supervisors more than once 
sent staff members back to study still more rural locations that would not meet 
with community opposition. The eventual selection of Gypsum Canyon followed 
weeks of protests from residents living near all four potential sites: Gypsum 
Canyon, Fremont Canyon, Irvine Lake and Chiquita Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Young blamed the failure of his initiative drive on the lack of resources. 
Gathering enough signatures to qualify a countywide measure "is a monumental 
undertaking," he said, one made more difficult because his group relied heavily 
on volunteers to go door-to-door. Young said the group spent about $10,000 on 
the effort, most of it coming from donations. 
</P>
<P>
Taking heart from his opponents, Young pointed out that Taxpayers for a 
Centralized Jail tried twice before qualifying their measure for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Young and Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) took the lead on the Rural 
Jail Initiative during their campaigns for elective office and were criticized 
for trying to capitalize on an emotional issue. Young was seeking to become 
Santa Ana's first popularly elected mayor, and Pringle was locked in a close 
race with Democrat Christian F. (Rick) Thierbach in the 72nd Assembly District, 
which includes Santa Ana. Both were elected. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, both men denied that their interest in the jail was merely for 
political advantage and that they had subsequently abandoned the jail issue 
because it no longer benefited their personal careers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an insult to talk about putting a jail in the heart of Santa Ana as a 
political issue," Young said. "The jail fight isn't my project. It's a 
community project. About 1,500 people helped get those signatures." 
</P>
<P>
During his campaign, Pringle mailed several thousand petitions for the Rural 
Jail Initiative along with his campaign literature to voters. 
</P>
<P>
"If being committed to a cause in one's district is capitalizing on an issue, 
then that's what I did," Pringle said. "But it's a vitally important issue to 
my district, and it remains so."

UCI CHILD CENTER GETS $65,000 GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The UC Irvine Child Development Center has received a $65,000 grant for a 
teaching and treatment program for children with hyperactivity and other 
behavioral disorders. 
</P>
<P>
The grant, from the Educational Foundation of America, will fund a program that 
began last year in cooperation with the Orange County Department of Education, 
which has involved more than 60 Irvine-area schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
The program teaches children social skills in group therapy and closely 
monitored classroom situations. After the special training, the youngsters 
transfer to intermediary schools where they can test their new skills before 
returning to their own academic environment. Progress is monitored and 
evaluated throughout the treatment and transition. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically, new behavior learned in a controlled therapy setting is not 
likely to be applied when the child returns to his or her natural environment," 
said James Swanson, director of the Child Development Center. "Our transition 
program allows us to approximate the natural environment during training. The 
results have been very promising." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Education Foundation, based in Westport, Conn., contributors 
to the treatment program have been the Irvine Health Foundation and the 
MacArthur Foundation of Chicago. 
</P>

MAN HELD IN KIDNAPING OF TEEN-AGE RELATIVE

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brea police on Monday arrested a 28-year-old man on suspicion of kidnaping and 
sexually assaulting a 17-year-old female relative about 3 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Jaracuaro Orozco of Brea was arrested at his workplace in the city without 
incident, Police Lt. Jim Winder said. 
</P>
<P>
Winder said the arrest concluded a 3-month investigation of the girl's report 
that she had been abducted and molested by a relative. Winder said police are 
not releasing information about how the girl is related to Orozco. 
</P>
<P>
Winder said the girl had been kidnaped from her home in Brea and taken by car 
on a 4-day journey covering a large geographical area. 
</P>
<P>
"She suffered psychological trauma, but she was not physically injured," Winder 
said. He added that the girl is now back in Brea and is recovering 
satisfactorily from the ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
Orozco is being held at the Orange County Jail in lieu of $100,000 bail, Winder 
said.

PANEL TENTATIVELY BACKS WETLANDS COMPROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY WRIDE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A plan to limit building in the Bolsa Chica wetlands area to residential 
projects and to seek restoration of nearly 1,000 acres of degraded salt marsh 
won tentative support Monday from an advisory group. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Bolsa Chica Planning Coalition, the advisory group, 
rejected two other development plans for the environmentally sensitive coastal 
tracts in unincorporated land surrounded by Huntington Beach. Although the 
group made substantial progress Monday, the plan it endorsed in concept will be 
subject to many conditions by the five coalition members. 
</P>
<P>
The members are primary land owner Signal Landmark Inc.; the state Lands 
Commission, which owns about 200 acres of restored wetlands in the project 
area; Amigos de Bolsa Chica, a wetlands conservation group; the county, and 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the boards of directors for the Amigos and Signal Landmark's 
parent company, the Henley Group, must review and approve the plan before it is 
considered for final agreement at an April 10 meeting of the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition, which meets at Huntington Beach City Hall several times a month, 
was formed in the fall to seek a way both to restore more than 900 acres of 
degraded wetlands and to build thousands of homes on the rest of the 
ecologically sensitive land, the fate of which has been the subject of a 
20-year battle between environmentalists and Signal. 
</P>
<P>
The Mesa Plan that was approved in concept Monday is an alternative to a land 
use plan approved by the county Board of Supervisors in 1984. The '84 plan has 
met with continued community resistance. 
</P>
<P>
The Mesa Plan calls for building up to 4,200 homes, most on the mesa above the 
degraded wetlands. It also provides for restoration of at least 927 acres of 
wetlands. This plan is based on the theory that the port authorities of Long 
Beach and Los Angeles will pay to restore the wetlands, because they are 
required by law to make up for wetlands destroyed as they expand their own 
harbors. 
</P>
<P>
The Mesa Plan calls for no commercial development; parkland would be included. 
</P>
<P>
One potential obstacle was eliminated Monday when the coalition agreed that a 
38-acre pocket of environmentally sensitive land would be preserved; Signal, in 
return, would be allowed to build at the other end of the parcel. 
</P>
<P>
Amigos representatives on the coalition, who have historically opposed any 
development in the lowlands, have tentatively accepted the compromise, which 
calls for Signal to build homes on about 200 acres of the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
If the coalition formally adopts the Mesa Plan on April 10, development and 
wetland restoration in the Bolsa Chica would still be years away. The county 
Board of Supervisors would have to withdraw its 1984 plan, and many government 
agencies would have to hold public hearings and review the new plan. 
</P>
<P>
However, coalition members said after Monday's meeting in Huntington Beach that 
they are pleased with progress made so far.

CABLE FIRM TO ADD MAINLINE RELIGIOUS SERVICE, TRIM TBN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move that affects 100,000 cable television subscribers and comes at a 
critical juncture for two influential religious broadcast services, a south 
Orange County cable operator will add mainline religious programming at the 
expense of time allotted to the conservative, evangelical Trinity Broadcasting 
Network. 
</P>
<P>
Dimension Cable's decision to put both services on a single channel, effective 
April 4, is another blow to Tustin-based TBN, which has been losing spots on 
various cable systems nationwide. TBN now will be sharing a Dimension channel 
with the new Vision Interfaith Satellite Network, a multidenominational, 
ecumenical service. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of both Dimension Cable and VISN agreed that the local 
channel-sharing arrangement would be a critical test of VISN's viability as a 
service and whether it will be able to earn an audience equal to or better than 
KTBN Channel 40, the flagship station of TBN. TBN officials did not return 
telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called It Unpopular 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement will take effect despite a survey of 450 subscribers in an 
affluent area including Laguna Beach, Mission Viejo, Dana Point, El Toro and 
San Juan Capistrano that indicated religious programming in general was 
unpopular, a Dimension official said. Dimension is a subsidiary of the Times 
Mirror Co., publisher of the Orange County Edition of The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Although Dimension is actually expanding its channel capacity, according to 
Christopher Forgy, a senior vice president for programming and marketing, 
viewers asked their preferences for new channels stated clearly that they were 
least-interested in adding religious programming of any kind. 
</P>
<P>
The same survey found that KTBN was the least-popular of all of Dimension's 
existing basic services, with 70% of respondents saying they have never watched 
it. (KTBN, a UHF station, can be seen throughout Orange County without the 
assistance of cable.) 
</P>
<P>
In other cities, TBN has sometimes waged advertising and letter-writing 
campaigns to stay on cable systems, and one TBN official once described VISN as 
"a network that is developed by liberal, non-Bible-believing denominations." 
</P>
<P>
In this case, however, TBN itself may have been the victim of an orchestrated 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Forgy acknowledged that Dimension received more than 700 letters requesting 
that the system carry VISN. A spokesman for VISN in New York said that the 
service had contacted local churches and ecumenical councils around the country 
through its denominational representatives, mailing out kits describing VISN 
and urging members to contact cable services. 
</P>
<P>
KTBN is one of 17 UHF stations controlled by Trinity, which produces a 24-hour 
Christian programming service that also appears on the network's 80 low-power 
stations and several dozen affiliated stations, as well as 580 cable systems, 
according to its sales brochure. 
</P>
<P>
Phillip Crouch, brother of TBN founder and president Paul F. Crouch, recently 
told Cable Television Business magazine that Trinity was less concerned with 
gaining cable viewers than with building the low-power stations -- smaller 
stations that reach a limited area but those that can be received without cable 
or any other special equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the new arrangement was welcomed by a VISN official. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Glad to Be in County 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's significant that this programming is going to be carried in 
Orange County," said William W. Airey, VISN's director of affiliate relations. 
"This area has been dominated by a relatively narrow type of religious 
programming that appeals to a comparatively small group of viewers." 
</P>
<P>
Both Airey and Dimension's Forgy agreed that the arrangement also would be a 
test of whether either VISN or TBN or both will remain on the Orange County 
system and whether VISN will be carried on any of Dimension's other systems. 
Irvine-based Dimension has a million subscribers nationwide, Forgy said. 
</P>
<P>
VISN'S main financial backer has been Tele-Communications Inc. of Denver, the 
nation's largest cable operator. Because it does not sell time to 
televangelists or permit solicitation of funds by broadcasters, it has 
attracted the support of other large system operators. 
</P>
<P>
"With the scandals of religious broadcasters in the last several years, 
principally (Jim and Tammy Bakker's Praise the Lord Club), there was almost a 
groundswell of opinion in the cable industry" for a service like VISN, said 
Gregory J. Liptak, president of Jones Intercable Inc., another industry giant 
also headquartered in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dropped TBN for Z Channel 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, Rogers Cable, one of the largest operators in the nation and which 
serves 73,000 subscribers in Garden Grove, Huntington Beach, Fountain Valley, 
Westminster, Stanton, Cypress and Los Alamitos, dropped Trinity to make room 
for the Z Channel after a viewer survey suggested that the TBN outlet was the 
least-watched station on the system. The move was carried out without 
controversy, said Mike Schenker, Rogers' executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, Cox Cable, which serves 300,000 subscribers, dropped a Christian 
cable service that included TBN programming for another religious service, a 
development that Crouch has mentioned several times on the air. Daniels Cable, 
which serves 42,000 customers in northern San Diego County, will begin running 
5 hours of VISN April 1 but will leave KTBN in place for now, according to Phil 
Urbino, the system's director of community relations. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, when Jones Intercable decided to gradually replace TBN programming 
with VISN in Albuquerque, N.M., Jack Hightower, head of TBN Cable Sales, tried 
to rally support among area residents who were receiving Trinity's newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters were urged to call or write Jones Intercable in protest, and 
thousands did, but the reduction remained and TBN issued an apology. Hightower, 
who is based in Denver, declined to answer any questions about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
In Greensboro, N.C., when Cablevison dropped two Christian stations -- 
including one owned by Trinity -- from the system, TBN took out newspaper ads, 
asking supporters to write or call the cable company, which they did without 
success. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Cordial' Talks With Crouch 
</P>
<P>
Dimension's decision to cut back on KTBN's hours followed "cordial, 
professional" talks with Paul Crouch, Forgy said. 
</P>
<P>
"Early on they were predictably excited" when they learned of the cutback, 
Forgy said. Later, they requested that their 12 hours include evening prime 
time, voicing particular concern about "Praise the Lord," TBN's live, 
prime-time talk show host by Paul Crouch and his wife, Jan. 
</P>
<P>
Dimension agreed, Forgy said, adding: "I don't really expect a concerted effort 
on their part to protest the shift, given these discussions." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from programming differences, there is a financial difference between the 
two systems. Cable system operators are paid up to 25 cents per subscriber per 
year to carry KTBN. VISN, on the other hand, charges cable system operators 36 
cents per subscriber to carry the service. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to "Praise the Lord," TBN features paid broadcasts by such other 
televangelists as Robert H. Schuller of Garden Grove's Crystal Cathedral, Jimmy 
Swaggart, James Robison, Kenneth Copeland and Richard Roberts, son of Oral 
Roberts. Show business hosts include Art Linkletter, Dale Evans, Gavin Macleod, 
Efrem Zimbalist Jr. and Meadowlark Lemon, with frequent guest appearances by 
Pat Boone and Jane Russell. The format is dominated by talk shows, but there 
are also children's and exercise programs, soap operas and game shows, and even 
a late-night, Christian version of MTV, called "Reel Videos," hosted by 
Crouch's son, Matt, and daughter-in-law, Laurie. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assemblies of God 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of Schuller, who is a member of the mainline Reformed Church 
in America, one Catholic priest and several fundamentalist Baptists, most 
broadcasters on TBN come from the Assemblies of God, the conservative 
denomination in which Crouch and his brother, Phillip, the network's vice 
president, were ordained. 
</P>
<P>
While Trinity does sell some of its broadcast time to televangelists who ask 
for money, it does not carry product commercials and raises most of its income 
from twice-yearly fund-raising drives. 
</P>
<P>
VISN's 15 hours of programming per day includes a weekday morning worship 
service that rotates between religious groups. On Sundays, services include two 
Catholic Masses and the service from the Marble Collegiate Church in New York. 
Other shows feature music, documentaries, magazine formats, cartoons, dramas 
and soap operas, and family films followed by discussions. On "One in the 
Spirit," Protestant groups bring to viewers "the stories of Christians who have

KOPP'S ROLE SHIFTS, BUT HIS VALUE REMAINS HIGH

Troy Kopp of Mission Viejo High School is considered a good professional 
prospect as a catcher. 
</P>
<P>
A great arm, a good hitter, a little power. 
</P>
<P>
"Troy has one thing that all scouts are looking for in a catcher -- a cannon 
for an arm," Mission Viejo Coach Ron Drake said. 
</P>
<P>
Trouble is, no one has seen Kopp catch lately. 
</P>
<P>
Kopp, The Times' athlete of the week, hasn't had to squat behind the plate once 
this season. A fact that Drake is pleased about. 
</P>
<P>
"Troy pitched last year too and, by the end of the season, his arm was worn 
out," Drake said. "We needed him to pitch this season so we wanted to save his 
arm." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the plan is working. 
</P>
<P>
Kopp had two victories and one save last week in the Santa Ana Elks tournament. 
At the plate he was five for 11 with five runs batted in, five runs scored and 
was named the most valuable player as the Diablos won the tournament title for 
the fourth consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
Kopp not only won the championship game, he also saved it. He started, went 4 
1/3 innings, then re-entered in the seventh to get the final two outs. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach asked me if I wanted to go back in," said Kopp, who was a second-team 
All-County quarterback last season. "I got out there and realized that I could 
save my own win. That's definitely a new one for me." 
</P>
<P>
What also is new for Kopp is second base, the position he now plays when not 
pitching. 
</P>
<P>
As a sophomore, Kopp played third base before switching to catcher as a junior. 
Drake wanted to move him from behind the plate this season, but already had a 
third baseman, Lance Sabella. 
</P>
<P>
Drake did have an opening at second base, so Kopp gave it a try. 
</P>
<P>
"All I want to do is help the team," said Kopp, who has signed a letter of 
intent to play football at the University of the Pacific. "If that means not 
catching, then it's fine with me." 
</P>
<P>
But second base is not just a place for Kopp to hide between pitching 
assignments. He has excelled at the position. 
</P>
<P>
Drake said that Kopp adjusted to playing second quickly and his arm strength is 
a definite asset when it comes to turning a double paly. 
</P>
<P>
"Troy has really quick hands, which helps, but it's his arm that makes him good 
at it," Drake said. "A lot of second basemen get rid of the ball quickly, but 
Troy gets some mustard on his throw." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
<P>
Eric Ekdahl of Mission Viejo was 10 for 16 with two home runs, seven runs 
scored and four stolen bases in the Santa Ana Elks tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Lavelle of Corona del Mar won the 1,600-meter run at the Pasadena Games 
Saturday. Lavelle finished in 4 minutes 15.54 seconds, a personal record and 
the fastest time of Orange County runners this season. 
</P>
<P>
Corey Giuliano of La Quinta was named the most valuable pitcher in the Anaheim 
Lions tournament. Giuliano was 2-0 in the tournament, including a four-hitter 
in the title game. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Parsons of La Quinta was named the most valuable player in the Anaheim 
Lions tournament. Parsons went two for four with a two-run triple in the title 
game.

VERSATILE SHEFF CONCENTRATES ON BASEBALL, HIS NO. 1 SPORT AT LAGUNA HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chris Sheff has always stood out on the Laguna Hills High School athletic 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's because he has been a starting outfielder on the baseball team for 
four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Or that he was a four-year starter on the Hawks' basketball team, and its 
leading scorer the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's the All-American crew cut he wears. 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe it's that you just can't miss Sheff playing center field in the Hawks' 
baseball field. It's only 300 feet from home plate to the center-field fence, 
and Sheff seems close enough to touch. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reason, people tend to notice Sheff, particularly now that it's 
baseball season and he's free to concentrate on his No. 1 sport. 
</P>
<P>
Basketball was fun, but it's baseball that Sheff, a 6-foot-3, 190-pound senior, 
wants to pursue in college. It is, he said, the sport he loves. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been one of the top athletes ever at the school," said Jack Hodges, 
Laguna Hills baseball coach. "Now that he has the chance to devote himself to 
baseball full time, he's really going to improve." 
</P>
<P>
Not that there was anything wrong with Sheff's game before, but Hodges believes 
his outfielder is ready to blossom into one of the county's best players. 
</P>
<P>
Great strength -- in hitting and throwing -- and great speed -- in stealing 
bases and patrolling center field -- are two of Sheff's attributes. 
</P>
<P>
But his best quality may be his reliability, according to Hodges. 
</P>
<P>
"Chris is a gamer," Hodges said. "He comes up (to bat) in a lot of tough 
situations and comes through." 
</P>
<P>
Sheff has always seemed to have more potential than others his age. Certainly, 
he's been able to do more with it. 
</P>
<P>
When he was in elementary school, Sheff played in pickup basketball games with 
the high school guys. When he was a freshman, he started on the varsity 
basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
He became the star of the team as a junior, averaging 16 points a game. This 
past season, he again led the Hawks with an 18.7-point average. 
</P>
<P>
Sheff also played on the Hawks' varsity baseball team as a freshman. By the 
midpoint of the season, he was starting in the Hawks' outfield, playing all 
three positions. He hit "about .275 to .290," he said, but never felt very 
confident at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a little bit intimidating," Sheff said. "As a freshman I had to fight 
for a job. Every at-bat meant something to my chances of playing." 
</P>
<P>
Playing in the smallish outfield at Laguna Hills -- a cliff at the edge of the 
hilltop field dictates the short center-field dimensions -- also was a little 
difficult to get used to. Even now he admits it's not his favorite place to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough to get your legs going," Sheff said. "It's so shallow. You're so 
dang close to the infield." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Sheff became a fixture in center as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
As a junior, he hit .440 and stole 24 bases, fourth best in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
This season, he's off to a record-breaking start in helping Laguna Hills to a 
9-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, he tied the school record with his 100th career hit, a solo 
home run in a 6-3 victory over Los Alamitos in the consolation championship of 
the Santa Ana Elks tournament. Friday, he broke the record in a doubleheader 
sweep of San Dimas. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he's closing in on the Orange County record of 116 career hits held by La 
Quinta's Jeff Osborn (1982-84). It would appear to be well within Sheff's grasp 
as Laguna Hills has 15 games remaining in its regular season. Even the Southern 
Section record of 133, set by Montclair Prep's Tom McKay from 1978-81, isn't 
out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
It helps that the Hawks are favorites to win their second consecutive Pacific 
Coast League championship. The added Southern Section playoff games would give 
Sheff more time to chase the records. 
</P>
<P>
It also helps to have players such as Mike Helm, a senior catcher who batted 
.449, and Rob Milo, a senior pitcher and first baseman, in the lineup with him. 
The two make it tough to pitch around Sheff. 
</P>
<P>
And as his sweet swing has developed, he has swatted away any lingering lack of 
confidence as if it were just another fastball from an opposing pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm more prepared now," Sheff said. "I like playing baseball a lot 
better now as a senior. I'm a lot more comfortable."

GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK; 
</P>
<P>
MCDONALD IS HAVING A FIELD DAY AT MATER DEI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
To some track and field athletes, competing in the 200- and 400-meter runs, the 
high jump and the long jump in one meet would not only be grueling but 
detrimental to peak performance. Not so for sophomore Melissa McDonald of Mater 
Dei High School. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald, The Times' athlete of the week, thrives on work and competition, said 
her coach, Pat Callahan. In a 79-44 dual-meet victory over Bishop Montgomery 
Wednesday, she won the 400 (59.2), the 200 (27.5), the high jump (5-4) and the 
long jump (16-4 1/2). 
</P>
<P>
She came back Saturday to place third in the 400 with a personal best 58.3 at 
the prestigious Pasadena Games, an invitational meet at Occidental College 
featuring some of the top high school track and field athletes in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"She is very strong and she has got a lot of energy," Callahan said. "She 
doesn't worry about getting tired. She just goes from event to event." 
</P>
<P>
Her only weakness, according to Callahan, is the mental toughness that comes 
with maturity. "She needs to learn how to compete and get herself mentally 
ready," Callahan said. 
</P>
<P>
Until she hones her mental edge, shuttling from event to event is a blessing in 
disguise of sorts. It keeps her focused, Callahan said. 
</P>
<P>
For her part, McDonald has been working on improving physically and mentally. 
She lifts weights year-round, which has helped her improve in the high jump 
from 5-0 to 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
"She is not a prima donna, which is very helpful to the team," Callahan said. 
"She has a tremendous work ethic. She doesn't just have great talent." 
</P>
<P>
Mentally, she has been working on thinking positively to minimize nervousness. 
</P>
<P>
"You always think of the negative things like losing or falling, but you can't 
do that or you will never get anywhere," she said. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald, a starting guard on the Mater Dei varsity basketball team and the 
eighth of nine children, said her first love is basketball because she likes 
team sports. Her parents are very supportive even if they tease her about being 
the next Ms. Olympia because of her weight training, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Her father also gives her newspaper articles of great basketball and track 
performances to inspire her. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald said she enjoys track because of its competitiveness. Callahan just 
enjoys having her around. "She means four first-place finishes every time," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we could run her in eight or nine events, we would." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
<P>
Pam Fogg of Huntington Beach (4-1) pitched a one-hitter in a 3-0 victory over 
Woodbridge Monday in a quarterfinal game of the Woodbridge tournament and a 
six-hit shutout in a 2-0 victory over El Toro Wednesday to lead the Oilers to a 
third-place finish. 
</P>

a jump of 5-6.

KNOTT'S PUTS NEW THRILLS, SPLASH INTO SUMMER DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN GALANTE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The thrill is back at Knott's Berry Farm. 
</P>
<P>
At least it will be by Memorial Day weekend, when Knott's plans to open two new 
thrill rides and what its promotions department is touting as the "most 
advanced" fountain display ever built. 
</P>
<P>
The Buena Park facility is spending $4 million on the attractions to perk up 
attendance figures during the upcoming busiest season of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California, after all, is the most competitive area of the country 
when it comes to recreation dollars. And Knott's faces especially stiff 
competition this summer from two multimillion-dollar attractions: Universal 
Studios' brand new Earthquake: The Big One and Disneyland's long overdue Splash 
Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
"On the local market, (those attractions) make the competition a lot tougher," 
Knott's spokesman Stuart Zanville said Monday. Knott's drew about 4 million 
patrons last year, ranking it sixth in attendance in the United States, 
according to Amusement Business, a trade magazine. 
</P>
<P>
To keep its turnstiles spinning this summer, Knott's plans to unleash two of 
the kind of thrill attractions that Knott's president and chief operating 
officer Terry E. Van Gorder calls "throw-up rides" -- the sort of tossing, 
twisting, spinning white-knucklers that appeal to teens. 
</P>
<P>
They are the latest in a major upgrading that has brought major renovations, 
Kingdom of the Dinosaurs, Wild Water Wilderness -- and three thrill rides -- to 
Knott's since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
With the two newest rides Knott's "completes the program we started 2 years ago 
of bringing our thrill rides back up to the current state of the industry," 
Zanville said. "Now we feel the quality of ours is comparable to that of any 
park." 
</P>
<P>
One of the rides -- the XK-1 -- puts thrill-seekers 70 feet above the ground in 
peanut-shaped capsules that are attached to a center shaft. The capsules -- 
which are supposed to resemble space cockpits -- lift up and spin at more than 
10 revolutions per minute. 
</P>
<P>
What gives the $2-million, XK-1 its kick is a microcomputer system that allows 
patrons to control their own capsules. By pushing on a control stick, customers 
can dive, swing straight up, or flop in dizzying, 360-degree barrel roles. 
</P>
<P>
It's not original, but the XK-1 is relatively new. Only two other versions 
exist -- at Santa Clara's Great America park where it opened 2 weeks ago and at 
King's Dominion in Virginia where it opened Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a whole new concept," said Tim O'Brien, managing editor of Amusement 
Business. "It's a combination of the Condor (at Magic Mountain) that takes you 
high in the air and turns you around and Dumbo (at Disneyland)" where you can 
move in and out. But with this, you can completely turn upside-down if you want 
to." 
</P>
<P>
Knott's is betting that the XK-1 will appeal to more than teen-agers. By giving 
patrons control over how much they want to toss and turn, Knott's is hoping it 
will attract its share of parents with 6-year-olds who will want to just sit 
back and enjoy the ride. 
</P>
<P>
Knott's second ride, called "Whirlpool," is an updated version of a very 
traditional theme park ride known in the industry as the "scrambler." 
</P>
<P>
Patrons sit at ground level in open cars that are suspended on the ends of long 
arms. The riders are thrilled when cars spin in one direction as they turn, "as 
if you put one car on the arms of a pinwheel," Zanville said. 
</P>
<P>
To add some pizazz, Knott's is putting its $1-million "Whirlpool" in a darkened 
building then adding lights and projected special effects to create the feeling 
that the riders are underwater. 
</P>
<P>
Both are located in the Roaring 20s area -- which should help spread crowds 
from the center of Knott's (where the log ride and Montezuma's Revenge are 
located) to the northwest corner. 
</P>
<P>
"The Incredible Waterworks Show," meanwhile, should help draw people to Knott's 
Reflection Lake, the acre or so of water in the western portion of the park. 
The show -- actually a gigantic (25 feet by 90 feet) fountain -- will contain 
1,100 jets of water that can shoot as high as 100 feet. The streams can be 
changed from show to show and will be combined with about 200 colored lights 
and music. 
</P>
<P>
At night, lasers and fireworks can be added to the 5- to 15-minute water show, 
which will spout up about 30 times each day the park is open. "It'll be the 
sleeper" of the latest attractions, Zanville said. "It's going to be 
spectacular, and people don't realize the size of it." 
</P>
<P>
The two newest thrill rides will help scare some life into the old box office 
receipts in two ways: for one thing, Knott's is purchasing the attractions -- 
not designing them -- so the cost is much cheaper than an original ride. 
</P>
<P>
Why thrill rides? 
</P>
<P>
Because they attract teen-agers and "that's one of the easiest markets to 
deliver," said Stephen Clark, president of Management Resources, a Tustin-based 
consultant to the leisure and amusement park business. Teen-agers "have the 
highest propensity" and are most likely to go to a new attraction, Clark 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
For Knott's competitors, the thrill rides may not be thrilling -- but they're 
not scary, either. 
</P>
<P>
"We complement each other," said Bob Roth, Disneyland's spokesman. "If Knott's 
adds to what they have there, that's basically good for the industry." 
</P>
<P>
"It's good for all of us," agreed Joan Bullard, spokeswoman for Universal 
Studios Hollywood. The new attractions "will bring more people to Southern 
California . . . and we hope that will bring more tourists to our area."

MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO 3 FRAUD COUNTS IN PRECIOUS-METAL CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA L. La GANGA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Texas man who migrated west "to find fame and fortune" pleaded guilty Monday 
in federal court in Santa Ana to three counts of wire fraud that stemmed from a 
precious-metals telemarketing scheme, a federal prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Matthew Dickey, 25, and his business, Eastern Financial Services, used 
hard-sell telephone tactics to get clients to wire money to buy contracts for 
future delivery of silver and platinum. Instead of completing the transactions, 
though, Dickey pocketed the proceeds, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 15 would-be investors lost more than $200,000 -- money that went 
directly into Dickey's bank account and eventually paid for charges at a 
limousine service and tony hotels in California and Hawaii, said Nancy Wieben 
Stock, the assistant U.S. attorney who handled the case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Own Business in Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
Dickey began his California career as a telemarketing salesman in a San Diego 
boiler room before striking out on his own in Newport Beach, Stock said. He 
operated his business from condominiums and apartments in that city, then 
relocated to a house in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
That house was raided by Newport Beach police and Postal Service agents in late 
January; Dickey was arrested on suspicion of grand theft. He was held in jail 
for 2 weeks before posting bail. 
</P>
<P>
Stock said Dickey's stint as a phone salesman convinced him "that he could make 
a lot more money running his own telemarketing outfit because as a salesman he 
could secure only a small, percentage commission. 
</P>
<P>
"So, he set up Eastern Financial Services, got a bank account, a mail drop, a 
telephone answering service, utilized the names of previous investors provided 
by colleagues, and he was in business," Stock said. "It doesn't take much." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Faces Up to 15 Years in Prison 
</P>
<P>
He now faces up to 15 years in federal prison and fines of up to $750,000. In 
addition, Dickey could be ordered to pay restitution to his victims -- 
throughout the country -- of as much as $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
The victims, Stock said, included two ministers in New York state. "One pastor 
in Amsterdam, N.Y., was brought in by a fellow pastor who believed he was 
making large profits on paper," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Dickey is scheduled for sentencing June 12.

AST Research Inc. has sold its Camintonn division, which makes computer 
enhancements for use on Digital Equipment Corp. products, to Camintonn 
management for an undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
AST, an Irvine computer maker, had previously disclosed plans to sell the 
operation as part of a strategy to focus on its principal business: selling 
personal computers and related products compatible with International Business 
Machines systems. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of expenses from the sale, AST recorded a pretax charge to earnings 
of $3 million for the quarter ended Dec. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Camintonn, based in Irvine, manufactures add-on computer boards and laser 
printers for Digital Equipment computers. It employs 21 people. 
</P>
<P>
Bosco K. Sun, formerly general manager of AST's Camintonn division, will serve 
as president and chief executive of the newly independent company. 
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased that Camintonn will continue to serve the DEC marketplace," 
said Bruce Edwards, AST's chief financial officer. "The sale to a group of AST 
employees is important in maintaining the continuity of Camintonn's service to 
its customers."

PACIFICA RADIO PUSHES FIRST-AMENDMENT FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McDOUGAL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beleaguered best-selling author Salman Rushdie may have rallied broad support 
among Western nations, but at least some of his work would not qualify as being 
decent enough to be read over the air under current federal broadcast 
standards, according to the Pacifica Foundation, a longtime champion of First 
Amendment rights. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based foundation, which operates KPFK-FM (90.7) and four other 
radio stations, bought a full-page advertisement in the national edition of the 
New York Times on Monday, soliciting funds for its First Amendment defense 
fund. In the ad, Pacifica compared the Bush Administration to Ayatollah 
Khomeini's Iran when it comes to censorship. 
</P>
<P>
The ad, which was paid for through the Public Media Center in San Francisco, 
cost Pacifica less than $10,000 because of its non-profit corporate status, 
according to David Salniker, Pacifica president and general manager of 
Pacifica's flagship station, KPFA-FM in Berkeley. Pacifica's annual operating 
budget is about $5 million, but there is no advertising allotment, so the 
Pacifica board had to vote a special payment for the New York Times ad earlier 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
"If we were to read Rushdie or other contemporary literature over the air, we 
would face fines and a jail term," said David Salniker. "It seems a little 
hypocritical for this Administration to jump on the First Amendment bandwagon 
about 'The Satanic Verses' when it has this kind of a double standard." 
</P>
<P>
The United States joined Britain and other Western nations last month in 
defending Rushdie's freedom of expression in light of Khomeini's death 
sentence, leveled against the Indian-born British novelist for allegedly 
blaspheming the prophet Mohammed in Rushdie's novel, "The Satanic Verses." 
</P>
<P>
The thrust of Pacifica's advertisement is that the same Bush Administration 
that condemns Khomeini's extreme form of censorship actually supports 
24-hour-a-day censorship on television and radio in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Under a rider that Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) attached to an appropriations bill 
last fall, Congress instructed the Federal Communications Commission to put the 
24-hour-a-day ban on "indecent" broadcasting into effect Jan. 27, one week 
after President Bush was inaugurated. The ban carries penalties of a $10,000 
fine and the possibility of two years' federal imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
A Washington federal circuit court stayed the ban one day before it was to go 
into effect, and the three-judge panel has not yet issued a ruling on whether 
it is constitutional. 
</P>
<P>
A coalition headed by Action for Children's Television joined Pacifica last 
year in its fight against the broadcast ban. The coalition includes ABC, CBS, 
NBC, the Motion Picture Producers Assn., the National Assn. of Broadcasters, 
National Public Radio and half a dozen other organizations. 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate the potential effects of the Helms ban, KPFK and the other 
Pacifica stations read from Rushdie's novels Feb. 27, but purposely censored 
phrases and words that they thought were explicitly or suggestively sexual. 
</P>
<P>
The self-censorship, according to Salniker, is a direct result of the FCC's 
failure to define what constitutes indecent broadcasting. The commission issued 
a ban against indecency two years ago, censuring Pacifica and two other 
broadcast organizations for allegedly broadcasting indecent material, but never 
spelled out what it meant by the term. 
</P>
<P>
When broadcasters asked for specific guidelines as to what constitutes 
indecency, the commission fell back on an amorphous, 10-year-old federal 
statutory definition that bans words or pictures of a "sexual or excretory 
nature." The commission said that the nation's 1,200 TV stations and 10,000 
radio stations could only broadcast such material between midnight and 6 a.m., 
when young children would be least likely to hear or see it. 
</P>
<P>
Helms, responding to pressure from such groups as Morality in Media and the 
American Family Assn., authored a law banning "indecent" broadcasting around 
the clock. 
</P>
<P>
"That (definition of indecency) still leaves us in limbo," said Bill Burns, an 
attorney for Pacifica. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, he said, the question of broadcast indecency may ultimately find 
its way to the U.S. Supreme Court next month in the form of an allegedly 
obscene phone call. 
</P>
<P>
He said a California "dial-a-porn" case that is scheduled to go before the high 
court April 19 may supersede the Action for Children's Television challenge to 
the Helms law before the federal circuit court has an opportunity to render its 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
In the "dial-a-porn" case, Los Angeles-based Sable Communications Inc. has 
challenged the Federal Communications Commission's right to regulate the 
content of its 976 phone messages. According to Washington attorney Tim Dyk, 
lead counsel for the Action for Children's Television coalition, all of the 
coalition members filed friend-of-the-court briefs in support of Sable 
Communications on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Burns said that even though the Sable case involves censorship of telephone 
calls and not over-the-air broadcasting, the same indecency question is 
involved. The U.S. Solicitor General's Office, which is arguing the 
government's case, has invoked the Helms ban on broadcast indecency as an 
argument against telephone indecency, Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the FCC has made provision for exempting literary and artistic 
works such as James Joyce's "Ulysses" from the indecency ban, according to a 
commission spokesman. The spokesman said that such exemptions would probably 
apply to Rushdie's fiction as well, but added that the pending status of the 
legal challenge to the Helms bill precluded the commission from making a 
decision.

X'S JOHN DOE TO INTRODUCE SONGS AT SAN JUAN SESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year after the members of seminal Los Angeles punk band X went on indefinite 
hold to pursue outside projects, bassist-singer-songwriter John Doe is finding 
that the freedom he anticipated by working alone can be double-edged. 
</P>
<P>
"It's much more frightening," Doe said by phone last week from Los Angeles, as 
his 13-month-old daughter, Veronica Jane, played noisily in the background. 
"You really have to decide everything all over again. There are no givens. 
While it's also exciting, what's frightening is you have to make all the 
decisions on your own because you're not working within a band so much as 
leading other musicians. And unlike X, which was together long before we made a 
record, I don't have the luxury of developing a sound over a 2- or 3-year 
period." 
</P>
<P>
There will be a few X songs sprinkled into his show Wednesday at the Coach 
House, where Doe will perform both solo and accompanied by Blasters drummer 
Bill Bateman, Cruzados bassist Tony Marsico and guitarist Greg Leisz, who has 
worked with Dave Alvin, K.D. Lang and Highway 101. But chiefly, Doe will be 
introducing a set of new songs he hopes to have out by summer on a solo album 
on Geffen Records. The album will feature his present band and other musicians, 
with the likely participation of Fabulous Thunderbirds guitarist Jimmie Vaughan 
and keyboardist Steve Nieve of Elvis Costello's Attractions. 
</P>
<P>
X went on hiatus last year, allowing members to pursue solo projects -- Exene 
Cervenka also has an album pending, with guitarist Tony Gilkyson producing -- 
and to allow Cervenka and Doe time with their families, as both became parents 
last winter. X fans shouldn't hold their breath for a swift reunion, if indeed 
the band ever gets back together: "We all have irons in the fire now, so we're 
on hold at least until the fall," Doe said, "and after that we'll see." 
</P>
<P>
As for the influences going into his new songs, Doe said, "They're just the old 
ones. . . . There's folk, country and rock 'n' roll. It turned out being a lot 
less country than I'd thought it would. The music has an emphasis on dynamics 
-- it's not just one thing or another." 
</P>
<P>
Since X's debut album titled "Los Angeles" in 1980, fans have considered the 
group and the city to be inextricably linked. Cervenka, though, recently moved 
to Idaho, and over a year ago, Doe claimed to be fed up with L.A. 
</P>
<P>
"That hasn't changed, and I just bought a house," he said with a laugh. "At 
least it's about an hour-and-a-half away, in the high desert out near the 
Grapevine. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The things I enjoyed about L.A. -- the personal landmarks and the music scene 
-- have disappeared. Of the little restaurants and buildings that meant 
something to me, half or more have been torn down. There's a different feeling 
here now." 
</P>
<P>
One thing tying Doe to the area is his acting. Following his appearance in the 
ill-received "Slamdance" movie in 1987, Doe will be seen soon in three more 
films -- playing the father of Myra Brown (who at age 13 became Mrs. Jerry Lee 
Lewis) in "Great Balls of Fire," a crooked bartender in "Roadhouse," where he's 
"just another one of the henchmen to get killed by John Patrick Swayze," and in 
"Matter of Degrees," a feature by Bill Morgan, director of "X, the Unheard 
Music." 
</P>
<P>
As to that 1985 documentary about the group, Doe would prefer that that title 
had been unnecessary. "I would like to have had a hit record, so that we could 
have something to show for our sweat, blood and pain. But, I think sometimes 
that's the role of a band like ours: You don't get financial reward for it, but 
you can still be proud of what you did." Yet he's not ruling out the 
possibility that X's members may find that reward eventually. "I don't think 
the Replacements record would have done as well if they hadn't worked as hard 
for so long, or R.E.M. either. It's all cumulative." 
</P>
<P>
Doe feels that for its part, X "opened doors and helped open people's minds," 
something most popular music doesn't aspire to. "It depends on what kind of 
music you concentrate on. I think some of the people doing acoustic music still 
carry that impact but the real big moneymakers, like Guns N' Roses, don't. A 
lot of artists are politically and socially aware and an equal number aren't. 
You can't discount John Cougar or Bruce Springsteen or Tracy Chapman or any of 
those people because I think they genuinely believe what they're saying and 
they back it up." 
</P>
<P>
Though he wished X had found a similar commercial success, Doe says he's 
satisfied to have made music that had a profound impact on a small number of 
people, rather than only a superficial effect on a large audience. 
</P>
<P>
"I would much rather do that. It can get a bit claustrophobic, though, when a 
person approaches you and tells you that you've changed their life. You're not 
really sure if that's good or bad, though you have to hope it was for the good. 
But they can be so fanatical about their support, you feel like taking a few 
steps back and saying, 'Look, I didn't really mean that, it was just a song,' 
Doe said, laughing, "But I'd rather deal with that than just to have sold out 
and rolled over for whoever was going to sign the checks." 
</P>
<P>
 The John Doe Band will play Wednesday at 8 p.m. at the Coach House, 33157 
Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $13.50. Information: (714) 
496-8930.

FEGHALI'S KEY: FRESH VIEWS AND VARIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since he won the gold medal at the Seventh Van Cliburn International Piano 
Competition in 1985, Jose Feghali has been praised for revitalizing warhorses. 
</P>
<P>
Words such as freshness and a real sense of discovery pepper his reviews. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't go out of my way to make things sound new," Feghali said from Denver 
between concerts. "I don't think, 'What can we do different here?' 
</P>
<P>
"But, for instance, the Tchaikovsky First Piano Concerto is a great piece of 
music which is (played) to death. To look at that piece and think 'octaves' is 
wrong. It has a lot of very tender and very anguished feelings in it. 
</P>
<P>
"It is certainly not a mature piece of Tchaikovsky's, but it looks forward a 
lot to the symphonies and later works. Those elements are frequently 
neglected." 
</P>
<P>
Standard repertory -- works of Beethoven, Brahms and Debussy -- will make up 
Feghali's recital tonight at the South Coast Community Church in Irvine to 
benefit the South Coast Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
The organization had canceled his earlier concert with the orchestra for 
budgetary reasons. But Feghali agreed to play not only the evening recital for 
the benefit of the orchestra but also a 2 p.m. program at the Church for Senior 
Citizens. 
</P>
<P>
(County audiences will also hear Feghali with the Pacific Symphony under 
Kazimierz Kord on May 23 and 24, 1990, playing Mozart's Concerto No. 17.) 
</P>
<P>
"I don't specialize in warhorses," Feghali insisted. "I try to have a variety 
in my repertory. All of music has something to say. . . . Communication is the 
most important thing -- with the orchestra, the audience and, hopefully, with 
the composer. 
</P>
<P>
"I (also) always believe it's more important to try to communicate what your 
feelings and interests are than to play something perfectly. There is the 
moment and what you do with the moment. There is no such thing as perfection." 
</P>
<P>
Feghali was born in Brazil in 1961 and began taking lessons at 3 because "my 
brother was having lessons," he said. His brother, who is 3 years older, became 
a civil engineer in Rio, like their father. 
</P>
<P>
"I pretty much wanted to be a pianist ever since I can remember," he said. "But 
I made the decision to make it my career when I was 15 and moved to London -- a 
new country, a strange country. . . . It was a completely different society, 
and, of course, there was more music there than I ever imagined possible, and 
the quality of the music was astonishing. The quality of teaching and concerts 
was certainly overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the best place to be to study and learn the piano. . . . But London is 
crazy, like L.A. is." 
</P>
<P>
Feghali now divides his time between London and Fort Worth, Tex., where the 
Cliburn competition is held. With his busy schedule, he gets back to his 
homeland only "about once a year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Feghali does not consider himself a missionary for Brazilian music: "I don't 
think one is necessarily duty-bound to perform one's own countryman's pieces. I 
think it's important to choose pieces that are close to one's heart, pieces one 
loves." 
</P>
<P>
Brazilian composers he plays include Heitor Villa-Lobos, Oscar Lorenzo 
Fernandez and Ernesto Nazareth, "the Brazilian equivalent of (Scott) Joplin," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Feghali acknowledged that competitions are controversial but calls them "a 
platform in a world today -- where things are so competitive -- unlike any 
other where you can be heard. 
</P>
<P>
"You need to show your work to managers, to recording producers and concert 
producers," he said. "Competitions are first and foremost a platform for that. 
However you may disagree about the results, what other paths are there? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying competitions are right," he added. "It is not a matter of being 
right or wrong but of being realistic. Competitions have played very important 
part of musical scene today. Not only in piano competitions. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest names of piano playing today, 99% of them have come out of the 
competition route: the likes of Argerich, Perahia, Michelangeli, Richter, 
Pollini, Zimerman, Ashkenazy. . . . I could go on and on. Thank God for 
competitions! 
</P>
<P>
"Also, pianists don't have the same opportunities of going into orchestras as 
other instrumentalists have. So our workplace is much narrower in that respect. 
I think competitions, especially in piano, play a very important part. 
</P>
<P>
He was equally insistent about the quality of music-making today and rejected 
the notion that we are not living in a golden age of music. 
</P>
<P>
"How can one say that? I just heard Richter live in London. What is that if not 
music at its most transcendental? 
</P>
<P>
"People like Michelangeli, Ashkenazy -- don't tell me that those people are 
homogeneous. Or Jessye Norman, Placido Domingo, Itzhak Perlman, Andre Watts. . 
. . I mean, come on. 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand what people are saying, but look at the young musicians 
coming up. There are a lot of people out there who have a very individual point 
of view. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a time people were playing ascetically, but I think that's over. 
People are tired of hearing people playing the same way. There is a lot of 
individualism out there. The scope of feelings is remarkable, and that's 
basically what I try to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Feghali will play music by Beethoven, Brahms, Chopin and Debussy today at 
7:30 p.m. at South Coast Community Church, 5120 Bonita Canyon Drive, in Irvine. 
Tickets: $10. Feghali will also offer a recital for senior citizens only at 2 
p.m. at the church. This program -- which will also include music by Chopin and 
Debussy -- will be different from the evening program. Tickets: $7. Information 
for both events: (714) 662-7220.

faculty of nine. Its doors are open daily from 7:30 in the morning until 10 at 
night. Every summer, the whole school spends a seven-week "working vacation" at 
Lake Placid. After graduation, the school pays the students' tuitions to 
private high schools or gets them scholarships, offers daily tutoring and helps 
with college placement. The cost per family is $10 a month. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a wonderful place," said playwright Bill Cain, who taught at the school 
for four years. Situated in a tenement in New York's Lower East Side, it is an 
environment he describes as "bursting with life. You can open your window and 
watch little kids of great beauty playing fantastic streetball -- and at the 
same time you're watching drug sales, hookers going up and down the block, the 
vestiges of the old Jewish neighborhood and a constant basketball game going on 
in the park. It's an incredible stew." 
</P>
<P>
In his "Stand-Up Tragedy" (at Taper, Too), Cain tells the story of his 
experiences in that world -- most specifically, of the relationship between a 
teacher and his 13-year-old student, who struggles to transcend both an abusive 
family and the surrounding world of drugs, gangs and violence. 
</P>
<P>
"The play talks about the idea of an ecology of evil," said Cain, 40. "There's 
a lot of evil around us: the dropout rate, drugs -- whatever. For the most 
part, we live in balance with it. But what happens if somebody upsets that 
balance? Whenever anybody would attempt to help one of the hookers working in 
front of the school, she'd be beaten by a pimp. So do you live in that ecology 
without upsetting it -- or do you say, 'I'm gonna unravel this sucker, get to 
the source'? The play follows that journey." 
</P>
<P>
Equally important are the journeys of the individual students. 
</P>
<P>
"My relationships with the kids continue," Cain said proudly. "The real kid in 
the story became my godson while I was there. He went on to art/design school 
for a year, then dropped out. But since then, he's been doing great. He got a 
job at St. Mark's Comics. He knows everything about them, so he's really in his 
milieu. It's perfect for him." As for the inevitable failures, Cain said 
softly, "You don't reconcile them. It still hurts. But you stay with the kid; 
he stays a part of you and how you live your life." 
</P>
<P>
The playwright (whose material springs from diaries he's kept for 17 years) has 
dramatized the material in a decidedly offbeat fashion -- with a storytelling 
technique that mimics stand-up comedy, an original rap score and "lots of 
dancing." Ron Link, who staged the stylish "Bouncers" and "Shakers," is 
directing -- with three of his "Bouncers" stars: Jack Coleman, Dan Gerrity and 
John C. Cooke. 
</P>
<P>
Cain, who left the Nativity school a year ago on good terms (and doesn't rule 
out the possibility of a return), has since directed "Twelfth Night" at the 
Oregon Shakespeare Festival; he'll stage "Two Gentlemen of Verona" there later 
this year. "It's hard to figure out -- how to put together theater that's on 
the cutting edge of life," he said. "You know some of the South African theater 
that's been around: 'Sarafina,' 'Asinamali'? Somehow they've found a way to 
combine talking about truly essential issues of their lives with theater. 
That's what I'm looking for." 
</P>
<P>
In the telling of this story, Cain sees himself as observer only. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to be fair to everybody in the show," he said slowly. "Everyone there is 
telling the truth. It isn't like there's one person who has the answers, who's 
the standard-bearer. The teacher offers the kid skills; the kid offers the 
teacher his own world. I guess my position in the play is my admiration for the 
boy, my desire to see him -- or anyone like him or like us -- live a life 
that's powerful and passionate . . . without being killed by the passion." 
</P>
<P>
Cain, who brought his street-comedy background of juggling and storytelling 
skills (he also studied in 1972 with a Santa Barbara group called the Royal 
Liechtenstein Circus) to his seven years running the Boston Shakespeare 
Company, believes "Stand-Up" offers theatergoers a healthy shake-up. 
</P>
<P>
"I think most of us lead deprived lives," he shrugged. "With an education 
behind us and some bucks in our pockets, we live fairly rarefied, slightly 
uninteresting lives. We hurl ourselves into our professions, our professional 
lives. Not a lot of people live in a neighborhood anymore, or have interests 
that go much beyond their doorsteps. In this neighborhood, there are Hispanics 
and whites, lots of artists. There's also a great sense of community, of 
communal life. It's risky, scary most of the time. But it's life."

MAJOR FIGURE PLEADS GUILTY TO FRAUD IN PENTAGON PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Former defense consultant William L. Parkin, wan and haggard nine days after an 
unsuccessful suicide attempt, withdrew his claims of innocence in the Pentagon 
procurement scandal Monday and admitted that he had bribed a Navy official in 
schemes to win lucrative contracts for his corporate clients. 
</P>
<P>
As he kept his eyes downcast and his head bowed, the 65-year-old Parkin was 
asked three times by U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton how he pleaded to counts 
of fraud, bribery and wire fraud. Three times, he whispered: "Guilty." 
</P>
<P>
The charges against Parkin, who had been a central target in the massive 
federal investigation of corruption in the Pentagon procurement process, carry 
a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison and $750,000 in fines. Hilton set 
sentencing for June 3. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the conviction potentially enlists Parkin as another star witness 
for the government, which now has struck deals with three leading defendants in 
the inquiry, apparently in an attempt to build cases against high-ranking 
persons who have not been indicted. 
</P>
<P>
Those persons apparently include former Assistant Navy Secretary Melvyn R. 
Paisley and former defense consultant William M. Galvin. 
</P>
<P>
"They have clearly decided to focus on Paisley and Galvin," a defense attorney 
involved in the case said in the wake of the recent flurry of plea bargains. 
"They think they've got 'em in their sights." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Paisley and Galvin have insisted that their clients are guilty of 
no wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still sitting here waiting," said Galvin attorney William Nussbaum, who 
noted that Galvin has not been charged with any crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Plotkin, an attorney for Paisley, refused to comment on Parkin's guilty 
pleas. 
</P>
<P>
The principal prosecutor in the case, Assistant U.S. Atty. Joseph Aronica, 
refused to say whether he expects Parkin's cooperation to bolster a criminal 
case against the two. 
</P>
<P>
But he said that Parkin's promise to testify against all "confederates, 
accomplices and co-defendants" would "advance the investigation" beyond the 
conspiracy to which the former defense consultant pleaded guilty Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"The investigation is moving forward across the board," Aronica said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecution documents have alleged that Parkin, who rose to the top civil 
service ranks in the Navy before establishing a consulting business in late 
1982, operated for nearly six years at the center of a network of consultants 
who bribed Pentagon officials for inside information and sold it to contractors 
eager to get an edge on their competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Among Parkin's close associates after he left his post as acquisition chief for 
the Navy's Joint Cruise Missile Project was Galvin, the high-powered consultant 
who was a partner of Paisley. 
</P>
<P>
Parkin once boasted that he had obtained Paisley's assistance in steering a 
contract to the Northrop Corp., according to a federal affidavit filed last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
The charges to which Parkin admitted guilt relate to his dealings with Los 
Angeles-based consultant Fred H. Lackner and Navy purchasing officer Stuart E. 
Berlin. He was part of a scheme to obtain favored Pentagon treatment for 
Teledyne Industries Inc. of Newbury Park, Calif., and Hazeltine Corp., a 
subsidiary of St. Louis-based Emerson Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
Under the arrangement, which has been detailed in previous indictments and 
guilty pleas, Parkin agreed to share his consulting fees with Berlin and, 
allegedly, with Lackner in return for assistance that was to bring a contract 
for the AN/APM 424 radar test gear to Teledyne and the award of a different 
Navy electronics project to Hazeltine. 
</P>
<P>
Parkin's plea in the scheme is the latest in a series that began in January, 
when Hazeltine and two of its executives agreed to plea bargains. 
</P>
<P>
Through his attorney and in interviews, Parkin long had maintained his 
innocence and complained angrily that the investigation had exhausted his 
finances and destroyed his personal life. 
</P>
<P>
At his arraignment in January, he disguised himself with a false beard and 
baseball cap in an attempt to elude photographers. Then, on March 18, with his 
trial scheduled to begin just nine days later, Parkin took an overdose of 
sleeping pills in what police said was an unsuccessful suicide attempt. 
</P>
<P>
While he was recovering last week, Berlin and Teledyne implicated him in their 
own pleas of guilt. That apparently persuaded Parkin to abandon his fight. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought this was an appropriate place to stop," his attorney, Gerard F. 
Treanor, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Treanor said that Parkin's health is "improving." But the former consultant, 
who has grown a flowing white beard, appeared ashen and wrung his hands 
nervously as the judge spoke to him. 
</P>
<P>
Lackner and three Teledyne employees face trial next week on charges alleging 
their involvement in the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Neither they nor their attorneys could be reached for comment on Monday.

COUNSEL TO BUSH DRAWS REBUKE FOR AIRING HIS DISSENT 
</P>

<P>
Administration officials publicly rebuked C. Boyden Gray Monday after the White 
House lawyer openly questioned the Contra-aid deal between President Bush and 
congressional leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The incident has emerged as a rare -- and embarrassing -- display of internal 
tension within a Bush White House staff faulted by some critics as 
inexperienced but which had won high marks for teamwork. 
</P>
<P>
"This was not Boyden's finest hour," said one senior White House aide. 
"Hopefully, we're back on the right track." 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater broadly hinted to reporters that 
Gray had been admonished. Bush and White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu 
met with Gray Monday morning to have "a polite discussion about how things work 
in the White House," Fitzwater said. The two discussed with Gray "how the 
system works and he fully understands that," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Gray publicly questioned over the weekend whether the agreement for more aid to 
the Nicaraguan rebels called for Bush to surrender too much power. Monday, 
however, he backed away from those concerns, telling colleagues at the morning 
White House senior staff meeting that his objections had been "overblown" in 
newspaper reports, staff members said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was asked about Gray while he attended Monday's annual White House Easter 
egg roll. Looking up at the sunny sky he replied: "On a day like this, I am not 
angry at anybody." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vague Job Description 
</P>
<P>
Gray's post as White House counsel officially makes him the President's lawyer, 
with a broad but vague job description. In some administrations the counsel has 
been involved in nearly all major policy decisions. In others, the office has 
been largely technical in nature. 
</P>
<P>
The present counsel is personally close to Bush, having served as a key adviser 
during all eight years of Bush's vice presidency. But his current role is 
somewhat unclear -- a factor that may have influenced him to try to become 
involved in this case, White House aides suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Gray's objections had no substantive impact. But their public nature was an 
embarrassing distraction from the White House campaign to gain maximum public 
advantage from the new policy. "It's a major accomplishment," a senior Bush 
aide said. "We hope it doesn't all get swept aside by this." 
</P>
<P>
When asked if Bush or Sununu had told Gray to stop airing policy objections in 
newspaper interviews, Fitzwater replied: "I think that's a good idea -- I'd be 
glad to tell him that." 
</P>
<P>
The incident began to develop Friday after Bush presided over a White House 
ceremony in which he signed a new accord on Central America with congressional 
leaders and praised the new agreement as a major accomplishment and a step 
toward restoring a bipartisan foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours, Gray, who was not consulted on the deal, sent a memo to Bush 
questioning the terms. Gray focused particularly on Bush's agreement that none 
of the money appropriated for Contra aid would be spent after Nov. 30 without 
the approval of four congressional committees. That, he said, smacked of an 
unconstitutional "legislative veto" of executive action. 
</P>
<P>
Other Bush aides responded to the memo, explaining that the deal with Congress 
had been carefully reviewed by State Department lawyers and other attorneys on 
the White House staff and that no legal problems had been found. The agreement 
on the November review was simply a "moral agreement" under which the President 
promised not to do something if Congress objects, not a legislative veto, they 
said.

MINKOW GIVEN 25-YEAR TERM; 'ENJOYED' ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Barry Minkow, who started the ZZZZ Best carpet cleaning company in his parents' 
garage and turned it into a fraudulent $100-million empire, was sentenced 
Monday to 25 years in prison after admitting he had "enjoyed being a little 
Mafioso." 
</P>
<P>
"Today is a great day for this country. The system works. . . . They got the 
right guy," Minkow, 23, said in a spirited speech to the judge that suggested 
the days when his fast-talking charm and ability to inspire people made him a 
millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
"I see victims here today," Minkow said, turning to a courtroom filled with 
investors who were among those who lost tens of millions of dollars when ZZZZ 
Best collapsed in July, 1987, amid allegations that the company's books were 
padded with phantom revenues. "I can only say how sorry I am. I am going to get 
what I got coming -- and I deserve every bit of it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$26 Million in Restitution 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian, expressing doubts about Minkow's 
professions of remorse, imposed the prison term recommended by the prosecution 
and also ordered him to pay $26 million in restitution for his conviction on 57 
counts of fraud and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't use the word that really describes what you're trying to level at me. 
El toro poo-poo, that's what I'm hearing. . . . I have to ask myself: Is he 
trying to clean my carpet, or what?" the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
"You're dangerous because you have this charisma, this gift of gab, this 
ability to communicate, but you have no conscience," he told Minkow. 
</P>
<P>
The 25-year prison term was one of the longest ever handed down in Los Angeles 
in a white-collar crime case. Minkow will become eligible for parole after 
serving one-third of the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the sentence was appropriate," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Gordon 
Greenberg, who with co-prosecutor James R. Asperger obtained the convictions of 
Minkow and 11 ZZZZ Best associates. "Barry Minkow did it the good, 
old-fashioned way. He earned every day of it." 
</P>
<P>
In his 10-minute statement at the sentencing hearing, Minkow announced that, as 
proof of his genuine regret over his crimes, he will not appeal his Dec. 14 
conviction. But his lawyer, David E. Kenner, said he will file a motion to seek 
reconsideration of the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Minkow, described by prosecutors as one of the most significant white-collar 
criminals ever prosecuted in the West, started his company at age 15 and had 
many of his early business meetings in the late afternoon after school. 
</P>
<P>
His talkative charm and natural head for business convinced top-notch 
accountants, lawyers and investment bankers for more than two years that he had 
figured out a way to cheaply restore office buildings damaged by fire and 
flood, a business that was supposedly earning ZZZZ Best up to $43 million a 
year from insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
ZZZZ Best also had a legitimate residential carpet cleaning enterprise -- 
eventually opening 21 offices in three states -- supported by television ads 
featuring Minkow confidently promising that his was the honest firm in a 
competitive field. 
</P>
<P>
Within a few years, Minkow, with the help of several more experienced business 
colleagues, transformed the private company into a public one and garnered 
nearly $13 million in a stock offering, obtained millions of dollars in loans 
from banks across America and talked dozens of private investors -- even some 
ZZZZ Best board members who did not know what he was up to -- to pledge their 
savings with the promise of huge profits. 
</P>
<P>
But, as it turned out, the majority of the lucrative restoration jobs never 
existed -- and neither did the revenues. Within days of Minkow's resignation in 
July of 1987, ZZZZ Best collapsed, leaving investors holding thousands of 
shares of worthless stock. 
</P>
<P>
The ZZZZ Best associates convicted in the case have received sentences ranging 
from 30 days to eight years in prison for various roles in helping Minkow carry 
out the fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout his three-month trial in Los Angeles federal court, Minkow claimed 
he had been manipulated by mobsters and stock swindlers who had taken advantage 
of his youth and grabbed the hidden reins of power at his company, forcing him 
to lie to banks and investors to keep their profits coming in. He described 
being beaten until he coughed up blood and being accompanied constantly by huge 
thugs masquerading as bodyguards. 
</P>
<P>
But making his first public statements since his nearly two-week-long 
appearance on the witness stand, Minkow told the judge that he was really using 
the reputed mobsters with whom he was involved the same way he was using 
everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned that it wasn't money that motivated me, as most people believe, 
but the attention, power and prestige the money brought me," Minkow said in a 
letter to the court. The "same" is true, he said, "for my relationship with 
organized crime figures. We used each other. . . . Barry Minkow enjoyed being a 
little Mafioso." 
</P>
<P>
When he got up to address the court, wearing jail issue blue trousers that were 
cuffed up to keep them from dragging on the ground, Minkow quickly became 
animated, waving his arms and, for a moment, holding the courtroom nearly 
spellbound. 
</P>
<P>
Minkow said he exemplified what he saw as the morality of his generation. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, winning meant everything -- everything, at all costs," he said. 
"Prestige, power and money. What else was there? And that's wrong. . . . The 
attitudes that made me fall and led me to do what I did, they're wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"If I took all these God-given talents that I had and used them, instead of for 
the bad, for the good, I'd never be here today. All the young entrepreneurs who 
said, 'I want to be like Barry Minkow.' Now they're saying, 'We can't get bank 
loans 'cause of Barry Minkow.' " 
</P>
<P>
The defense has said that Minkow does not have anything left of the $2.4 
million to $3.3 million he earned while at the helm of ZZZZ Best. But Minkow 
pledged to use his business talents to pay investors back when he is released 
from prison. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't think for a second that I don't know to the penny how many people I 
hurt, how I'm going to work for the rest of my life to pay them back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tevrizian said Minkow brought more presence to the podium than some 
$500,000-a-year trial lawyers. But the judge said it was hard to take Minkow 
seriously when he admits he lied during his 11 days of testimony about mob 
beatings and threats from his own friends. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day he'd come into court and testify, and every day was at variance with 
the previous day," the judge said. "It was like a game show we were playing, a 
TV game show. Who could tell the biggest lie?" 
</P>
<P>
Asperger, who had recommended a sentence of at least 25 years, said Southern 
California has become the "Wild West" of white-collar crime and compared Minkow 
to such youthful offenders as Billy the Kid and Al Capone, who controlled 
rackets in Chicago by the age of 25. 
</P>
<P>
"He committed crimes on each and every day for more than five years. The nature 
of his crimes, I think, is mind-boggling," the federal prosecutor said. "His 
motive was simple: greed, and to become the biggest, richest and most famous 
entrepreneur ever." 
</P>
<P>
Tevrizian landed a final blow at Minkow when he jokingly referred to a 
Christmas card the young entrepreneur had sent to the prosecutors, who by then 
were midway through a rancorous, 3 1/2-month effort to send him to prison. 
</P>
<P>
Said the judge: "You sent the Christmas card to the wrong guy."

VICTORIES VASTLY OUTNUMBER LOSSES, YET STUNNING SETBACKS ARE SUFFERED

<P>
In a protest vote that will echo across the Soviet Union, senior Communist 
Party officials were defeated in Moscow, Leningrad, the Ukraine and the Baltic 
republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in the country's first contested 
national elections virtually since the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution brought the 
party to power. 
</P>
<P>
Partial election results showed Monday that in one defeat after another, many 
of them stunning in their margin, official party candidates bore the brunt of 
the rising popular anger over shortages of consumer goods and poor living 
conditions, over pollution and fears of nuclear power, over the country's 
undiminished bureaucracy and the lack of national self-determination. 
</P>
<P>
Among the unofficial candidates sweeping to victory was Boris N. Yeltsin, who 
had been dismissed as the Moscow party leader and a non-voting member of the 
ruling Politburo because of his radical populism. He won 89% of the more than 
5.7 million votes cast in a citywide constituency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Party Hold Not at Stake 
</P>
<P>
The party's hold on political power was not directly at stake in Sunday's 
voting for the Congress of People's Deputies, the country's new legislature, 
and its victories vastly outnumbered the defeats, according to the results 
released by election officials here. Full results from the weekend voting 
should become available Wednesday from all 1,500 constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
But never in its 71 years in power has the party's leadership been so broadly 
and sharply challenged at home, and that challenge now confronts President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev. It was Gorbachev who proposed the elections as a way of 
energizing the country and propelling it into further reforms and who must now 
deal with the results. 
</P>
<P>
As the scope of the party's setbacks emerged Monday, Gorbachev stressed in a 
statement that the value of the elections transcended the immediate victories 
and defeats. It was vitally important for the future of the country, he said, 
to give the people a chance to voice their opinions and then to listen to those 
views. 
</P>
<P>
"The main moving force in perestroika is Soviet man," he told the official news 
agency Tass, referring to his program of political, economic and social 
reforms, "and today we can register the fact that Soviet man has spoken up -- 
the voters' intense activity has shown that. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Master of the Country' 
</P>
<P>
"And even if not everyone is pleased by the outcome of the elections -- well, 
there is nothing that can be done about it. The master of the country has 
spoken." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, perhaps not even Gorbachev, for whom the whole election process is a key 
element of his reform strategy, was prepared for the scale on which party 
candidates were rejected in elections that were designed as much to protect 
them as to permit popular challenges against them. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Yeltsin's victory in the country's largest and most prestigious 
constituency came at the expense of the official party candidate, Yevgeny 
Brakov, the manager of a giant automotive plant in Moscow, who received less 
than 7% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who now has a popular mandate that approaches Gorbachev's, immediately 
began making plans to form a bloc in the new legislature and fight for the 
program of faster reform on which he was elected. 
</P>
<P>
As the results were announced at Moscow's City Hall, the scene of two 
pro-Yeltsin demonstrations before the election, crowds of Yeltsin supporters 
gathered outside, shouting "We won! We won!" and then taking up the rhythmic 
chant of his campaign, "Yel-tsin, Yel-tsin." 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also began to make plans for his election to the Supreme Soviet, the 
country's newly strengthened legislature of about 450 people that will be drawn 
from the 2,250 members of the Congress of People's Deputies next month. He 
hopes to form an influential bloc of 30 to 40 deputies in the Supreme Soviet. 
</P>
<P>
"My spirit is full of joy, and of concern about what I can realistically do to 
help Muscovites, to help all our people," he told hundreds of supporters 
outside his office at the State Construction Committee. "The battle is far from 
over -- in fact, we have only begun." 
</P>
<P>
Moscow's mayor, Valery Saikin, meanwhile, was beaten by Nina Ageyeva, the 
forewoman of a team of house painters. Ageyeva herself failed to get 50% of the 
votes required for election, so that the district's race was voided and a new 
election will have to be held later. But by running against Saikin and winning 
more votes than he did, she evidently succeeded in her goal of challenging the 
mayor to account for his administration of the Soviet capital. 
</P>
<P>
In Leningrad, the top two party leaders and the city's mayor were apparently 
all defeated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Names Crossed Off 
</P>
<P>
Yuri F. Soloyev, a voting member of the Politburo and the regional party 
leader, was omitted from a list of victors provided by election officials to 
local news media, although he was unopposed. That implied that more than half 
the voters crossed his name off their ballots in a massive vote of 
no-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
The city's first secretary, Anatoly Gerasimov, received only 15% of the vote, 
according to Tass, and lost to a previously unknown shipbuilding engineer, Yuri 
Boldyrev, who received more than 74%. 
</P>
<P>
The city's mayor, Vladimir Khodyrev, was also omitted from the official list of 
winners, according to editors at the official newspaper, Leningrad Pravda. 
</P>
<P>
In Lithuania, candidates from the Lithuanian Movement for Perestroika, known in 
Lithuanian as Sajudis, won 30 of the 42 seats at stake, and they will compete 
in runoff or new elections in nine others. 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian Communist Party's first secretary and his deputy were elected 
unopposed -- after Sajudis withdrew its candidates in a gesture of good will -- 
but the republic's president and prime minister were defeated by their Sajudis 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"We will send a full Sajudis team to Moscow to press our case for sovereignty 
now," Vytautis Landsbergis, the Sajudis chairman, said by telephone from 
Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital. "We have a clear mandate from the people, a 
mandate that the party can only envy and not challenge." 
</P>
<P>
In eight Lithuanian districts and scores of others around the country, runoff 
elections will be required April 9 under Soviet election law because, with 
multiple candidates contesting the same district, no one received more than 50% 
of the votes. 
</P>
<P>
As in the Moscow district involving the capital's mayor, a ninth Lithuanian 
district was left undecided by the voters Sunday, when they apparently rejected 
both candidates by failing to give either the required 50% of the votes. In all 
districts where this stalemate between two candidates occurred, the elections 
were voided and new elections will have to be held before the end of May. 
</P>
<P>
In neighboring Latvia, the party's first secretary, Jan J. Vagris, won by what 
Tass described as "a tiny margin" after vigorous challenges from the left and 
the right. On the left, a candidate from the Latvian Popular Front called for 
the republic's secession from the Soviet Union and its full independence, while 
one the right, a Russian charged that there had been too many concessions to 
the nationalists. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, candidates from the Latvian Popular Front or those who had received 
its endorsement, including Latvia's popular president, Anatoly V. Gorbunov, won 
25 of the republic's 29 seats, according to local newspaper editors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Party Leaders Defeated 
</P>
<P>
In Estonia, the other Baltic republic where nationalist sentiment is at an 
all-time high since the forcible incorporation of the three states into the 
Soviet Union in 1940, candidates from the Estonian Popular Front won half the 
seats, defeating a number of local party leaders and Russians from a rival 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
But the Estonian Communist Party's top three leaders won endorsement by more 
than 90% of the voters -- with the front's active backing. 
</P>
<P>
In the Ukraine, five local party first secretaries, including those of the 
principal cities of Kiev and Lvov, failed to win election even though they were 
unopposed because of a widespread movement by Ukrainian nationalists to vote 
against party officials. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of ballots marked "boycott" were received, particularly in Lvov, 
where 36,000 ballots were declared invalid. Elections will have to be run again 
in two of Lvov's three constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
"We declared these elections anti-democratic," Orest Sheika of the Ukrainian 
nationalist Lion Society said, "and it appears that the people agree with us." 
</P>
<P>
There were similar defeats for party officials in districts across the country, 
according to reports by Tass. In the Siberian city of Tomsk, for example, the 
regional first secretary was defeated, although he was unopposed, when a 
majority of voters scratched out his name in an apparent protest over local 
living conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The mood was also clear in lesser contests where voters rejected veteran party 
officials to elect people they believed would represent them and pursue faster 
change. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, for example, voters chose as deputies Professor Oleg T. Bogomolev, 
one of the most outspoken reformers among Soviet political scientists and Ilya 
Zaslavsky, leader of a self-help movement for the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
In another Moscow district, historian Roy A. Medvedev, who was under effective 
house arrest for years, topped the poll in a multi-candidate race and will take 
part in a runoff election in two weeks.

ABORTION PROTEST ARRESTEES FORCE SLOWDOWN IN COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
More than 300 jailed Operation Rescue demonstrators jammed Los Angeles 
arraignment courts Monday, withholding their names for hours in their 
determination to go on trial to further publicize their contention that 
abortion is murder. 
</P>
<P>
The arraignment process moved with excruciating slowness -- just as the 
arrestees intended. 
</P>
<P>
By late Monday night, only 17 of them had been released, and it looked as 
though a great number would spend another night in jail. The 17 were let go 
after prosecutors, who could not find their files, decided not to file charges. 
</P>
<P>
Others, buoyed by reports that charges against their leaders were being 
reduced, finally relented and relinquished their anonymity. One by one, they 
gave court officials their names, Social Security numbers and ages so that the 
arraignment process could inch forward at last. 
</P>
<P>
Each, in turn, then pleaded "not guilty" to such misdemeanor charges as 
trespassing, resisting arrest and blocking a public street. Trial for each was 
set on April 14. 
</P>
<P>
Still other "John Does" and "Jane Does" awaited their turns. 
</P>
<P>
"We're up to our eyeballs," Los Angeles Deputy City Atty. Alice Hand had 
groaned hours earlier, as she and her colleagues began to realize just how long 
it all would take. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all 'John Does,' she had explained. "That's why we're having a hard 
time. It throws everything into chaos. . . . We probably won't get done until 
midnight." 
</P>
<P>
It was not until 5:15 p.m. that Municipal Court Commissioner David A. Stephens 
announced that paper work had reached him and he was prepared to proceed. But, 
he said, the attorneys had to go over all the cases "and apparently they are 
not yet ready." 
</P>
<P>
Only two defense attorneys, Mary Murphy Quintero and Robert Sassone, were on 
hand to represent any demonstrators who wanted them. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, the city attorney's office made a blanket offer of straight 
probation if the arrestees would plead guilty or no contest. The offer was 
turned down. 
</P>
<P>
It was well past 7 p.m., when the first groups of arrestees began filing into 
two of the courtrooms on Bauchet Street near the Men's Central County Jail -- 
the men in Division 82, the women in Division 80. It had been a long day in the 
holding tanks for all of them, and they showed it, sitting in subdued silence 
on the wooden courtroom benches until their individual cases were called. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's office asked that bail be set at $3,000, but the courts 
decided to stay with the original figure of $250. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said only those with photo identification would be released Monday 
night. In a show of solidarity, some with identification chose to remain in 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
While his followers were awaiting their arraignments, Operation Rescue founder 
Randall Terry and three associates learned that they apparently will not face 
felony charges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Referred Case 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office declined to issue such a 
complaint and referred the case to the city attorney for possible misdemeanor 
action, district attorney's spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
However, late Monday, the city attorney's office said the Los Angeles Police 
Department was seeking to have the felony charges filed. 
</P>
<P>
Police sought a complaint charging Terry, 29; Michael McMonagle, 36; Donald 
Benette, 35, and Andrew Eppink, 41, with conspiracy to commit unlawful 
assembly. 
</P>
<P>
More than 700 members of Operation Rescue were arrested Saturday as they tried 
to blockade a Koreatown-area women's medical center on the third and final day 
of the "Holy Week of Rescue." The demonstrations by the organization seeking to 
close Southern California abortion clinics were staged at a time when the U.S. 
Supreme Court is about to reconsider the abortion question. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of the arrested demonstrators had identified themselves and 
bailed out of jail over the weekend. But those who remained were determined to 
go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to put forth the case of the unborn child," Joseph Foreman, national 
field director for Operation Rescue, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The result was the long, slow day at the courtrooms at 441 Bauchet St., as the 
demonstrators were brought by Sheriff's Department buses from various jail 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Dailey, a woman arrestee who relented early and gave her name in order to 
get released at midday Monday, explained that her sister in New York needed a 
blood transfusion and that she, Dailey, was the only possible donor. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Stephens plodded through the routine of arraigning the usual 
weekend collection of suspected drunks, wife beaters and bar brawlers while he 
waited for prosecutors to ready the cases against the demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
As the buses headed toward Bauchet Street, Stephens mused aloud, "Are we gonna 
put them in the Bloods tank or the Crips tank? Wait'll they see the metal 
toilets and the baloney sandwiches." 
</P>
<P>
By midafternoon, he observed, "Well, they ate their lunch, and they haven't 
begun to tear the concrete out of the walls yet." 
</P>
<P>
Then he went back to processing the weekend backlog of misdemeanor cases. When 
a toothless, elderly man accused of breaking a window said he did not want to 
"languish in jail," Stephens advised him to talk to one of the free, available 
"anti-languishing lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resolve Matter 
</P>
<P>
Despite the slowdown, Presiding Municipal Judge Larry P. Fidler said, "It does 
not prevent us from doing our job. It just takes that much longer to get it 
done. We're prepared to work as many hours as it takes to get the matter 
resolved." 
</P>
<P>
A small group of Operation Rescue supporters gathered outside the courtrooms, 
where they formed a circle, held hands and prayed. 
</P>
<P>
One woman asked God to "break open these walls and let our men go." 
</P>
<P>
A male member of the group said, "Please, let us not lose sight of why we're 
here -- that there are babies still being murdered." 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach police avoided arresting any of the demonstrators who tried to block 
the entrances of a small women's clinic in that city Friday, but it was a 
different story on Saturday in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long, long time since we arrested this many people at a single 
incident," Los Angeles police spokesman Cmdr. William Booth said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Although he conceded that the arrestees were making the process difficult, 
Booth declared, "They don't create so many problems that we wouldn't do the 
same thing if (it) happened again." 
</P>
<P>
He described the situation as "a large lump going through the system" but 
added, "We will pass the lump." 
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that trespassing, resisting arrest, interfering with a police 
officer and the other charges are crimes, Booth observed, "It's so darn foolish 
to think you have to do this to make the nation listen to you. They are 
following some very foolish leadership." 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Daryl F. Gates said Monday that he was "enormously proud of the 
manner in which (the officers) responded." 
</P>
<P>
"The strategical planning, the execution of tactics, the exercise of individual 
discipline, patience, restraint and tolerance were obvious to all objective 
observers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Roman Catholic Archbishop Roger Mahony released a statement Monday 
in which he criticized pro-choice activists, saying they "support taking the 
life of an unborn child." 
</P>
<P>
He urged the U.S. Supreme Court to reconsider the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision 
that legalized abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope and pray that the court will see clearly the flawed reasoning (in Roe 
vs. Wade) and once again restore the right to life to every person from the 
moment of conception to natural death," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the pro-choice group Coalition for Safe and Legal Abortions 
said they will organize public information campaigns, rallies and community 
forums to stir public support for the continued legalization of abortions.

SCHOOL SAYS IT NOW IS ASKING SHARON ROGERS TO TEACH AGAIN 
</P>

<P>
Officials at La Jolla Country Day School reversed themselves Monday and said 
they are inviting Sharon Rogers, wife of Navy Capt. Will Rogers III, to work 
for the school again next year. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Roth, a public relations specialist hired by the school in the mounting 
dissension over the fourth-grade teacher's removal from her classroom, said 
that "if we can assure 100% security for her, the faculty and the children," 
the school will present her a new contract offer inviting her to return to the 
school when classes resume next fall. 
</P>
<P>
If that cannot be worked out, then Rogers will be asked to work "off-campus" 
and contribute to the school by preparing teachers' lessons and working with 
the alumni association, Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
Other options being discussed call for her to teach via a live television 
hookup, or for her students to be bused to a more secure location, according to 
a parent of one of Sharon Rogers' fourth graders. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers was told by the school not to return after her van exploded on the 
morning of March 10 at a busy intersection just blocks away from the school. 
The FBI has been investigating the bombing as a possible terrorist attack in 
retaliation for her husband's command on the guided missile cruiser Vincennes, 
which last summer shot down, by mistake, an Iranian airliner in the Persian 
Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason here is that she's a tremendous asset," Roth said. "She's a master 
teacher. She's worked here 12 years, and we're doing everything possible to 
have her still make a contribution to the school." 
</P>
<P>
The school spokesman denied that Monday's announcement was a turnaround from 
the school's earlier decision to remove Sharon Rogers, even though school 
officials had told The Times that she would not return to the school next year. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't necessarily concede that it is a new development," he said. "She's 
employed now like any other teacher. She's doing work for her compensation. And 
we've said we would honor her contract for the remainder of this year and give 
her full pay. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we're just trying to figure out what we're going to do next year." 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Rogers could not be reached for comment Monday. But Navy Cmdr. David 
(Matt) Dillon said he spoke with her Monday afternoon and told her that the 
school was considering re-extending her teaching contract. 
</P>
<P>
"She didn't know anything about it," he said. "She's not received any calls 
from them. 
</P>
<P>
"But when I told her, she just kind of said, 'Oh, OK.' But she's still waiting 
to talk to them directly before she has any response." 
</P>
<P>
Roth said administrators have been trying to contact Rogers to discuss a new 
contract offer, but have been unable to reach her. She and her husband are 
under the protection of the Naval Investigative Service at a location away from 
their home. 
</P>
<P>
He said school officials are "assuming that she does" want to return to her 
Country Day classroom.

HIGH COURT TO WEIGH EXECUTING YOUTHS WHO KILLED WHEN THEY WERE UNDER 18 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Can a state whose laws call a 16-year-old too young to serve on a jury and too 
young even to witness an execution impose the death penalty for a crime 
committed at that age? 
</P>
<P>
That question was put to the Supreme Court Monday as the justices again weighed 
whether to ban the death penalty for juveniles as cruel and unusual punishment. 
</P>
<P>
Only 27 of this nation's nearly 2,200 Death Row inmates committed their crimes 
when they were under 18. But death penalty foes have focused on the execution 
of teen-agers as a symbol of what they see as the immorality of capital 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Capital Punishment Backed 
</P>
<P>
Since 1976, the court majority has strongly upheld the constitutionality of 
capital punishment. But the justices are almost evenly split on whether 
juveniles may be put to death. 
</P>
<P>
Last June, the court threw out the death sentence for a crime committed by a 
15-year-old in Oklahoma but was unable to fashion a broad ruling. On Monday, 
the court heard challenges to death sentences imposed in Missouri and Kentucky 
on youths who had been 16 and 17 when they committed murder. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the two young killers pointed to an array of laws that treat 
children as less competent and less responsible than adults. A lawyer for Heath 
Wilkins, 16 at the time of his crime, said that, under Missouri law, he would 
be deemed too young to serve on the jury that convicted him, too young to get 
medical care without his parents' permission, too young to vote, too young to 
control his own finances and "too young and impressionable" to witness an 
execution. 
</P>
<P>
Those laws "lend strong support to the notion that there is a national 
consensus against executing the young," attorney Nancy McDerrow said. "When we 
draw a line between childhood and adulthood, we usually choose 18," she said, 
urging the court to adopt the same rule for capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
But the high court's conservatives disputed whether there is a need for a broad 
ruling, suggesting that the task should be left to state legislatures. Chief 
Justice William H. Rehnquist wondered how there could be a "national consensus" 
to abolish the death penalty for juveniles when legislatures in 18 states 
permit it. California law limits capital punishment to those who commit crimes 
at age 18 or older. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Considered as State Issue 
</P>
<P>
Questions from four conservative justices -- Byron R. White, Antonin Scalia and 
Anthony M. Kennedy -- as well as Rehnquist, suggest that they believe the 
matter should be left to the states. 
</P>
<P>
The four generally liberal members -- Justices William J. Brennan Jr., Thurgood 
Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens -- said last year that they 
believe a public consensus exists to invalidate capital punishment for 
juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
The deciding vote likely will be cast by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who voted 
last June to reject the death sentence in the case of the 15-year-old killer 
but who generally believes that such issues should be settled by state 
legislators. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky Atty. Gen. Frederic Cowan said that it would be unfair and unwise for 
the court to set a firm national minimum of age 18 for the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
He asked the court to consider a murder committed by a 17-year-old and an 
18-year-old in which the evidence showed that the younger person was the 
ringleader. Because of cases like this, Cowan argued, it makes sense to let a 
jury consider the facts -- including the youth of the defendant -- in deciding 
who gets what punishment. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkins stabbed a liquor store clerk to death near Kansas City in 1985. The 
Kentucky defendant, Kevin Stanford, robbed, raped and shot a young mother at a 
Louisville gas station in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
A ruling on the two cases (Wilkins vs. Missouri, 87-6026, and Stanford vs. 
Kentucky, 87-5765) can be expected in July. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Court Actions 
</P>
<P>
The court also: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Agreed to decide whether Pennsylvania's death penalty law is 
unconstitutional because it says that a sentencing jury "must" impose a verdict 
of death if the aggravating factors in a first-degree murder case "outweigh the 
mitigating circumstances" (Blystone vs. Pennsylvania, 88-6222). In 1976, the 
justices struck down all laws that mandate the death penalty for certain 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Allowed a public hospital to keep a chaplain on its payroll. Three atheists 
from Iowa contended that using taxpayers' funds to pay for a chaplain violates 
the First Amendment's ban on "an establishment of religion." But an appeals 
court ruled that the chaplain's job involved comforting patients, not promoting 
religion. Without comment, the justices denied a further appeal in the case 
(Carter vs. Broadlawns Medical Center, 88-1286).

Inmates holding more than 600 hostages -- most of them women and children -- in 
the second day of a prison siege began negotiating their demands Monday with 
the government's human rights ombudsman. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the inmates released 19 of their 646 hostages. 
</P>
<P>
At least 10 people were killed and 60 wounded Sunday in the takeover of El 
Pavon prison outside the capital, a prison official said. 
</P>
<P>
The hostages are mostly family members who were on Easter visits to the prison. 
According to some reports, many relatives of inmates stayed voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
Prison spokesman Conrado Monroy said human rights ombudsman Gonzalo Menendez de 
la Riva is hearing the prisoners' demands. 
</P>
<P>
The prisoner are demanding amnesty or a reduction in their sentences, the 
replacement of prison officials and improved prison conditions. The government 
has rejected the amnesty demand.

S. KOREA DISSIDENT'S SURPRISE TRIP TO NORTH STIRS FUROR 
</P>

<P>
The unauthorized visit of a South Korean dissident leader to Pyongyang, the 
capital of Communist North Korea, has sparked an uproar here and threatens to 
destabilize an already tense political situation. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Moon Ik Hwan, 71, shocked officials in Seoul by appearing in Pyongyang 
over the weekend after making a clandestine journey via Tokyo and Beijing. By 
Monday, news of his bold, free-lance attempt to promote the cause of Korean 
reunification had aroused the indignation of the media and the disapproval of 
opposition parties. 
</P>
<P>
Government authorities were irate and vowed to arrest Moon on his return for 
violating the National Security Law, which bans unauthorized contacts with the 
North Korean enemy. The reaction was in sharp contrast to the exuberant mood 
that greeted a trip to North Korea in January by Chung Ju Yung, founder of the 
Hyundai conglomerate, who undertook a private trade mission with the blessings 
of the government. 
</P>
<P>
Moon's gambit came on the heels of a controversial decision by President Roh 
Tae Woo to cancel an anticipated midterm referendum on his first year in 
office, ostensibly because he and his mainstream political opponents agreed 
that the vote might cause social unrest and provoke a confrontation between the 
radical left and the extreme right. 
</P>
<P>
Roh recently has been beset by hard-liners in the military and in the ruling 
circles who are expressing displeasure over the president's relatively tolerant 
approach to unfettered -- and unfamiliar -- democratic dissent. 
</P>
<P>
Roh canceled the referendum March 20 with a pledge to get tough on the "violent 
leftist fringe" that he warned was attempting to overthrow the government. 
</P>
<P>
Moon's challenge to the government's rigid control over contacts with North 
Korea appears to have generated enough confusion to provide Roh with a broad 
pretext to crack down on dissent for national security reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever (Moon's) motive for his unauthorized trip, either from romantic 
nationalism or idealism, it can only be damaging," declared an editorial in 
today's edition of the Korea Herald, a state-owned daily. "His impractical 
attempt will only play into the deceptive and masterful stratagem of North 
Korea." 
</P>
<P>
Much to the consternation of authorities here, Moon addressed North Korean 
President Kim Il Sung as "respectable chairman" and made a passing reference to 
"dictatorial forces" in South Korea in his arrival remarks Saturday. The 
remarks were reported in a dispatch by Pyongyang's official Korean Central News 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The Presbyterian minister attended an Easter service at a Pyongyang church 
Sunday, and he reportedly described a vision of Korean reunification as the 
"resurrection of the nation." 
</P>
<P>
Moon, a veteran dissident and former political prisoner who was educated at 
Princeton University, had been invited to Pyongyang, along with two other 
dissident leaders and the heads of South Korea's four political parties, by Kim 
Il Sung in the North Korean leader's most recent New Year's address. 
</P>
<P>
Minister for Unification Lee Hong Koo told reporters Monday that Moon's trip 
would only serve to strengthen the North Korean position in 
government-to-government negotiations. Talks on fielding a joint sports team in 
the 1990 Asian Games are set to resume today at Panmunjom, the peace village in 
the demilitarized zone. A third session aimed at arranging prime 
ministerial-level political dialogue is scheduled for April 12. 
</P>
<P>
"Rev. Moon's personal visit is feared to hamper our sincere efforts to have 
closer dialogue with the north, adding confusion to official talks," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition leader Kim Dae Jung, speaking to diplomats and reporters at the 
Seoul Foreign Correspondents' Club on Monday, said Moon's visit should be seen 
in the context of Roh's own policy of north-south reconciliation, which the 
president unveiled, with much fanfare, last July. 
</P>
<P>
"He declared that North Korea is our partner, not our enemy, and we should 
regard them as such. In this spirit, the exchange of people of all walks of 
life would be helpful to ease tension," Kim said. "I do believe, however, that 
it might have been much better if Rev. Moon consulted with the government 
before he went." 
</P>
<P>
Local press reports suggested the government was particularly miffed that its 
intelligence apparatus, which has a reputation for formidable efficiency, 
failed to detect Moon's plans to go to Pyongyang. The Korea Herald quoted an 
unidentified government source as saying authorities were studying plans to 
increase surveillance. Roh had promised to curtail spying on South Korean 
citizens as part of his democratic reforms.

TRIUMPHANT YELTSIN WANTS TO LEAD KREMLIN'S 'LOYAL OPPOSITION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Boris N. Yeltsin, the maverick Communist Party politician whose radical 
populism brought him a dramatic victory in the Soviet Union's parliamentary 
elections, immediately set out Monday to become the leader of what may in 
future be called "the loyal opposition" in the country's new legislature. 
</P>
<P>
After winning a stunning 89% of the 5.7 million votes cast in Moscow's citywide 
constituency in the Congress of People's Deputies, Yeltsin declared his 
candidacy for the Supreme Soviet, the new, full-time legislature to be elected 
next month by members of the congress. 
</P>
<P>
From there, he hopes to form a group of like-minded deputies, interested both 
in better meeting the demands of what he calls "social justice" and in 
accelerating the country's political, economic and social reforms to a pace 
faster than favored by the Communist Party leadership. 
</P>
<P>
And this could make Yeltsin, 58, a plain-spoken, burly construction engineer 
from Siberia who reached the party's top ranks before breaking with the 
leadership, the focus for those critical of the party, its policies and style 
and looking for political alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
"This has given perestroika (restructuring) greater urgency," an ebullient 
Yeltsin said of his victory as supporters and journalists crowded into his 
central Moscow office. "When nearly 90% of the people make clear their views, 
how can you ignore them? We will proceed now with what the people want." 
</P>
<P>
Even before the election, he calculated he could put together a bloc of perhaps 
30 or 40 deputies in the Supreme Soviet. That is not quite a tenth of the 
likely membership, but it holds the potential for what Yeltsin described as "a 
very active, very influential and perhaps strategic force." 
</P>
<P>
"We can perhaps take positions that will have an impact on (party and 
government) policy, positions that cannot be ignored,positions that we can 
present quite effectively, quite forcefully," he told The Times in a 
pre-election interview. "Don't worry -- Yeltsin is not going into the Congress 
of People's Deputies to sit quietly. I am not that type of man." 
</P>
<P>
He also talked Monday of forming alliances with other groups -- the 
nationalists from the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, other 
rebels who have won in cities scattered around Russia and the Ukraine, the 
environmentalists from across the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
His first task, however, will be to win election to the Supreme Soviet from the 
Congress of People's Deputies, a body of 2,250 that will hold "supreme 
authority" but will generally meet only once a year. 
</P>
<P>
About 450 deputies are expected to be elected late next month to this new 
legislature, but the exact number and the procedures are not yet known. As the 
overwhelming winner in the country's biggest constituency, Yeltsin has a good 
claim for inclusion, but Monday he described this as "my next struggle" against 
party leaders who may try to keep him out. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin had run on a platform calling upon the government to concentrate its 
resources on improving living standards and focusing economic development far 
more narrowly than in the past. He called for massive cuts in defense spending 
and in the space program -- with the money to be transferred to the civilian 
sector -- and for even greater cuts in industrial construction, which has long 
been the motor of economic growth here. 
</P>
<P>
But most of all, he had campaigned against the special privileges enjoyed by 
party and government officials and against the rampant corruption in Soviet 
society, particularly at official levels. 
</P>
<P>
He supported President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on foreign policy and on the 
overall strategy for perestroika, Yeltsin told The Times this month, but he 
differed on some priorities and on many points of tactics. 
</P>
<P>
His election rallies grew from hundreds at the start of the election campaign 
to more than 10,000 on Saturday, the day before voters went to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
But as his popularity became increasingly evident, the party apparatus grew 
more and more worried. He had to fight for his nomination and then for every 
meeting hall while his opponent, the director of an automobile plant, here, 
benefited from the party's full organization powers. 
</P>
<P>
Prevented from holding public rallies, Yeltsin's supporters took to the 
streets, demonstrating twice last week in front of the Moscow City Hall. 
Finally, battalions of younger soldiers were brought into Moscow to vote 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't fool the people," Yeltsin said Monday. "The more certain comrades in 
the apparat (party) tried to defeat Yeltsin, the more that the people were 
determined that Yeltsin should be elected and they should be heard. So be it." 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin was brought to Moscow by Gorbachev in 1985 to clean the political hacks 
out the local party machine built under the late Leonid I. Brezhnev and to 
crack down on corruption. 
</P>
<P>
But he was denounced by Gorbachev for his "over-weening ambition" and dismissed 
as the Moscow party leader in November, 1987; he was later removed as a 
candidate, or non-voting, member of the ruling Politburo and given the 
ministerial-level post of deputy chairman of the State Construction Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"To be a people's deputy, I would happily give up this job, this office and all 
of the paper work that go with them," Yeltsin said earlier this month. "To be a 
people's deputy, to speak for the people in Parliament, that is what I want."

JURY SELECTION TO BEGIN TODAY FOR HUNTER TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jury selection is set to begin today in the trial of Nancy Hoover Hunter, who 
is charged with fraud, conspiracy and income tax evasion stemming from the 
collapse of the J. David &amp; Co. investment firm, but much of the questioning 
of potential jurors will be done in private. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. District Judge Earl Gilliam said Monday that reporters will be barred 
from sessions where potential jurors are questioned individually about their 
views on a number of subjects, but did not specify what those subjects are. The 
potential jurors also will be asked to fill out a lengthy questionnaire 
intended to cut down on the amount of information they are asked to provide in 
questioning in open court. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers involved in the case said later that the private sessions, in which 
potential jurors will be questioned outside the presence of other potential 
jurors, will deal with questions about pre-trial publicity and other matters. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam said 119 potential jurors will be on hand today and a total of 300 will 
be available. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter was charged in November, 1986, in a 234-count indictment and faces 
another trial on an indictment returned in March, 1988, in which she is accused 
of 56 counts of conspiracy and using the mails to sell unregistered securities.

THE OIL SPILLOVER EFFECT; 
</P>
<P>
KEY CRUDE PRICES AT THEIR HIGHEST SINCE '87, BUT SURGE MAY BE SHORT-LIVED 
</P>

<P>
The Alaskan oil spill sent shock waves through energy markets Monday, with 
crude oil prices surging to their highest level in 19 months. 
</P>
<P>
But the increases -- which stirred up an already ebullient oil market -- may be 
short-lived if the Alaskan port of Valdez reopens this week and Alaskan oil 
resumes its flow to the United States, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, especially in the futures market, you had a knee-jerk reaction," said 
Dennis K. Winters, an economist with Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass. 
Winters said the longevity of the price rise will depend on "how quickly they 
can restore delivery" of the Alaskan oil. 
</P>
<P>
An often-used barometer of energy prices -- West Texas Intermediate -- shot up 
38 cents to $20.53 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange futures market 
Monday, the highest closing price since August, 1987. Earlier in the day it 
peaked at $20.95. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the most widely traded international crude -- North Sea Brent 
Blend -- rose above $19 a barrel for the first time since October, 1987. Also, 
unleaded gasoline for April delivery closed up 1.73 cents at 59.75 cents a 
gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, an official at Chevron Corp. said the disruption was in effect 
small change, barring unexpected delays. 
</P>
<P>
"If you lose all the money you've got in your pocket right now you'll be 
unhappy -- but it's not a big amount compared to your annual income, and that's 
the situation here," said Thomas G. Burns, manager of Chevron's economics 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
The price surge was triggered by an accident late last week, when an Exxon 
Corp. tanker spilled an estimated 10.1 million gallons of crude oil into Prince 
William Sound in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
The spill forced the closing of Valdez, where freighters pick up oil from the 
Alaska Pipeline and haul it to the rest of the United States, principally the 
West and Gulf coasts. Despite expectations that the oil spigot would soon be 
turned back on, analysts were following developments in Valdez closely. 
</P>
<P>
The Alaskan Pipeline provides one quarter of domestic U.S. oil production, or 
1.8 million barrels of oil per day. Of this amount, 1.2 million barrels go to 
the West Coast and the remainder is consumed by states along the Gulf of 
Mexico, according to DRI. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Alaskan petroleum accounts for 40% of oil consumed in California, 
said Dennis J. Eoff, senior energy specialist with the California Energy 
Commission in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
A sustained interruption would have serious ripple effects, pushing up prices 
in other oil markets, and likely forcing California to use more distant oil 
sources, such as Singapore, to supply its motorists. Such a move could cost 
four to six cents per gallon in added transportation costs, Eoff said. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, said Chevron's Burns, "if Alaska is going to be shut down for an extended 
period of time, it's a different ballgame entirely." 
</P>
<P>
Even if Alaska reopens soon, however, it remains that energy prices have risen 
dramatically in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
The pressures on energy prices have included brisk demand by robust economies 
in the United States and Asia, production cuts by the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries and production accidents. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, difficulties in the North Sea, including a platform explosion 
last year, have kept hundreds of thousands of gallons a day off the world oil 
market. Global demand for oil is estimated at 65 million barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
These factors have combined to push up crude oil prices more than 50% since 
last November, not even counting the Alaska problems. 
</P>
<P>
"For the last several months it just seems like we've been having a run of bad 
luck with supplies and that's been part of what's pushing prices up," said 
Morris Greenberg, an oil price forecaster with the WEFA Group, economic 
consultants in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts on Monday were predicting that luck for energy consumers might change 
for the better before the year is over. 
</P>
<P>
"I know a lot of people are saying that prices are going to move higher, but 
frankly it's a little hard to see how they can keep going farther up," 
Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of new, unforeseen problems, at least one expert suggested that 
OPEC, eager to regain its market share, might play a constructive role. 
</P>
<P>
"My guess is they (OPEC) would tend to increase production rather than stand by 
and watch the price skyrocket," Burns said.

SEARS OKS DEAL TO SELL COLDWELL COMMERCIAL UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sears, Roebuck said Monday that it has agreed to sell its Coldwell Banker 
commercial real estate group to employees and outside investors. The price was 
not disclosed, but sources in the industry put it in the range of $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
James J. Didion, the Los Angeles-based unit's 49-year-old chairman, said he 
will remain in his post as will other top managers. Under terms of the deal, 
the company's 4,990 employees will all be invited to participate in the 
ownership and could end up holding as much as 50%. 
</P>
<P>
As reported earlier, the outside investors, who will hold the remaining half, 
include the Carlyle Group, a merchant banking firm in Washington that former 
Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci joined after leaving the Pentagon, and 
other U.S. and Japanese investors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Use Name for 3 Years 
</P>
<P>
Financing for the deal is being put together by Sumitomo Bank and Bankers Trust 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
Sears announced in October that it planned to sell the Coldwell Banker 
Commercial Group as part of a corporate overhaul designed to strengthen its 
consumer operations. The giant retailing company, based in Chicago, will retain 
the arm of Coldwell Banker that sells residential real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Didion said in a telephone interview Monday that the commercial group will be 
allowed to use the Coldwell Banker name for three years. In the meantime, the 
new owners "will develop a new identity and new logo," a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Didion, a Sacramento native who started with Coldwell Banker as a salesman 26 
years ago, said the company is "excited by the opportunity of being independent 
again" and plans to accelerate its most recent growth plan, formulated in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"We had completed our geographical growth," he said, "and we're now focusing on 
increasing our market share and revenue potential with each individual 
(salesperson)." 
</P>
<P>
With 1988 gross sales of $460 million, Coldwell Banker is the nation's largest 
commercial real estate services company. It has 95 offices in the United States 
and four in Canada, up from 52 offices at the start of 1982 when the company 
was bought by Sears. 
</P>

Didion said other key officers at Coldwell Banker plan to remain in their 
posts. They include former UCLA football star Gary J. Beban, president; Peter 
L. Marr, Western division executive vice president; Boyd Van Ness, Eastern 
division executive vice president; Robert D. Scanlan, president of Coldwell 
Banker Capital Markets, and Tad Jones, president of Coldwell Banker Capital 
Management Services. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Ross, co-managing director of Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co., a Los Angeles 
accounting firm, said management's decision to stay on will be a major 
advantage for the company. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a very strong management group," he said. "Given the opportunity to 
operate freely in an entrepreneurial environment, they can be highly 
competitive." Ross said he expects the company to get more involved in property 
management and development. 
</P>
<P>
The involvement of Japanese investors and funding also should help the company 
develop business in East Asia, observers said. Didion said the company "will 
spend more time internationally than we have in the past" and expects to 
explore the idea of opening offices in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and 
"other places of commerce." 
</P>

Coldwell Banker started as a commercial real estate firm in San Francisco as 
Tucker, Lynch &amp; Coldwell in 1906. Two of its principal founders, Colbert 
Coldwell and Benjamin Arthur Banker, concentrated for years on building a 
network of offices in California. In 1952, the first location outside 
California was opened in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
A nationwide expansion was begun in 1969, when the company also moved into 
residential real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Carlyle Group, formed in May, 1987, has attracted a number of prominent 
Washington people, including Carlucci, who is vice chairman. Carlucci once 
served as chairman of Sears World Trade Corp., a short-lived subsidiary. The 
investment firm's senior adviser is Frederic V. Malek, a former president of 
Marriott Hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Malek said Monday that the investors plan to take no active role in managing 
the Coldwell Banker business. "We've got the best management group in America 
running this group," he said. He noted that the investors expect Coldwell 
Banker employees to be motivated by the chance to own a big chunk of the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Sources had said earlier that the investment group buying Coldwell Banker 
Commercial Group was also expected to include the Hillman family of Pittsburgh, 
whose real estate empire encompasses many rich properties in Southern 
California. Malek said, however, that "we never got to a point of commitment 
with them."

THE OIL SPILLOVER EFFECT; 
</P>
<P>
STATE'S REFINERIES FORESEE SHORTAGES UNLESS ALASKA OIL FLOW RESUMES SOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A massive oil spill that forced the closing of an Alaskan port has California 
oil refiners bracing themselves for possible shortages of crude oil if 
shipments do not resume quickly, say company officials. 
</P>
<P>
"If it stays closed for a couple of days it would disrupt supplies," said 
Chevron spokesman Mike Libbey. "Several days of that and you will start seeing 
gasoline shortages on the street." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't anticipate any impact assuming that the port opens for tanker traffic 
shortly," said Arco spokesman Al Greenstein. If Valdez remains closed, however, 
"that's a whole different ball game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The shutdown of the port of Valdez, closed since late last week, has drawn 
attention to how dependent California has become on Alaskan crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
California refineries rely on the state's own reserves for about 60% of their 
supply of crude oil -- Alaska accounts for nearly all of the remaining 40%. 
About one out of three cars in California runs on gasoline refined from 
Alaska's North Slope crude, according to Arco. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a very delicate balance of supply and demand," Steve Shelton, 
president of the Southern California Service Station Assn. "It doesn't take 
much to knock it out of whack." 
</P>
<P>
The California Energy Commission estimates that 20 million to 30 million 
barrels of Alaskan oil are in transit to the state refineries, which have 
another 20 million barrels in stock. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron refineries along the West Coast, including those in El Segundo and 
Richmond, Calif., would gradually begin to cut back production if Valdez 
remains shut down today, Libbey said. 
</P>
<P>
Industry officials say Arco, the state's largest gasoline retailer, is in a 
particularly tight spot since the recent temporary closure of a refinery in 
Cherry Point, Wash., for maintenance has left it with a smaller reserve than 
normal. Arco estimates that its refinery in Cherry Point and one in El Segundo 
have about a week's supply of crude on hand. 
</P>
<P>
Arco has four tankers waiting outside of Valdez, said Greenstein, who also said 
the company might be able to tap into a tanker loaded with a shipment of oil 
owned by Standard Oil of Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Arco said the U.S. Coast Guard is expected to open Valdez today on a limited 
basis. Tankers will be allowed to enter and exit one at a time, Arco says. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Arco's expectations, industry officials said delivery schedules have 
already been interrupted. It takes tankers about 24 hours to be filled at 
Valdez and another six days to reach California ports, say industry officials. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron said a tanker scheduled to arrive next week was still waiting outside 
of Valdez Monday and will probably be late. However, a Chevron tanker that 
departed just before the port closed was expected to have unloaded in Richmond 
early this morning. 
</P>
<P>
California, which consumes about 2 million barrels of oil daily, is relatively 
isolated from other domestic sources of crude oil. Only two oil pipelines 
connect California with the rest of the nation and those pipes are designed to 
transport oil out of the state. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of domestic connections might force California to turn to more 
expensive sources of foreign oil if Valdez remains closed, say industry 
analysts. Currently, foreign imports -- mostly from Indonesia -- make up only 
5% of the state's supply of crude oil, according to state figures. 
</P>
<P>
"The West Coast is essentially an energy island separated from the rest of the 
country," said one industry official. "We have plenty of oil with supplies from 
Alaska, but without it, that's when we have a problem." 
</P>
<P>
* Nearly 40% of all crude oil refined in California comes from Alaska's North 
Slope. 
</P>
<P>
* Nearly one of every three cars on California highways operates on gasoline 
refined from Alaskan oil.

MCorp, the second-largest Texas bank holding company, said Monday that it will 
seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors, sidestepping three 
bondholders who asked that the company be put into liquidation. 
</P>
<P>
The developments lent uncertainty to the government's effort to rescue the 
troubled banking company. 
</P>
<P>
MCorp said the bankruptcy would not affect its banking business and attempted 
to reassure customers that their deposits would be safe. 
</P>
<P>
The impact on the jittery savings and loan industry, which suffered heavy 
record withdrawals concentrated in Texas at the start of the year, could not be 
gauged. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Breakup Effort Likely 
</P>
<P>
"This really muddies the waters and puts us into uncharted territory," said 
banking analyst Frank Anderson of Stephens &amp; Co. in Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said it is likely the government will try to break the company into 
pieces rather than accept management's plan for a government-assisted rescue 
that would allow the holding company to remain intact. 
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy filing puts into the hands of a federal judge a key issue that 
has emerged in the current climate of failing banks -- whether holding 
companies must use money from their financially sound subsidiaries to cover 
losses at failing units. 
</P>
<P>
"You are definitely breaking new ground here," said a banking analyst in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Filed Under Chapter 7 
</P>
<P>
The involuntary petition from the creditors was filed under Chapter 7 of the 
federal Bankruptcy Code. Under this law a company's assets are sold off and the 
business is wound up. 
</P>
<P>
MCorp said it will convert the filing to a voluntary Chapter 11, which allows 
it to continue to operate under court supervision with existing management. 
</P>
<P>
It will also be protected from creditor and other claims while a reorganization 
plan is developed. 
</P>
<P>
MCorp said it had not seen the court papers filed by the bondholders but had 
learned late Friday that the legal action was taken against it in the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. 
</P>
<P>
"Since last fall, representatives of MCorp had met several times with 
noteholders and urged them not to take action prematurely despite the 
moratorium on payment of principal and interests on borrowed money while the 
company was proceeding with efforts to recapitalize," MCorp said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the pressure from the three bondholders, the company said "many of the 
noteholders recognized that their interests would be better served by 
withholding action pending completion of the recapitalization efforts." 
</P>
<P>
MCorp has been in a tug-of-war with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. for 
five months over various reorganization plans. The FDIC, which insures bank 
deposits, has been attempting to line up investors for a plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deadline to Expire 
</P>
<P>
While some have argued that the FDIC lacks the authority to order MCorp to use 
money from its healthy banks to help cover losses at its failing banks, the 
FDIC has said that bank holding companies have an unlimited obligation to help 
their failing subsidiary banks. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the five-month struggle, bankruptcy has loomed, with MCorp seen 
holding the upper hand because neither regulators nor creditors wanted MCorp to 
file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which they felt would only drive up the cost of 
reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
"This filing was not unforeseen, but it was unfortunate," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came just one week before expiration of a deadline set by the 
FDIC for acceptance of new bids to buy MCorp.

Ball Bearings Ruling Issued: The Commerce Department issued a final ruling that 
anti-friction bearings from nine countries were being sold unfairly in the 
United States, paving the way for permanent anti-dumping duties. It said the 
nations were West Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Romania, Singapore, Sweden, 
Thailand and Britain. The department also said Singapore and Thailand were 
"dumping" bearings on the U.S. market at less than fair value. Duties being 
imposed average 10% to 80%, with the highest at 212%, meaning that prices would 
have to be raised by that percent to bring them to a fair value.

<P>
In one of California's longest and costliest civil trials, a state jury has 
decided that an affiliate of Chubb Co. must pay Fibreboard Corp. $6.1 million 
to cover asbestos-related legal costs. 
</P>
<P>
Concord, Calif.-based Fibreboard, a lumber and insulation company, said Monday 
that a San Francisco Superior Court made the award in the lawsuit late Sunday 
against Pacific Indemnity Co. 
</P>
<P>
Fibreboard, which manufactured asbestos-containing insulation products until 
1972, said it has been hit with over 75,000 personal injury claims related to 
asbestos. Inhalation of asbestos fibers can cause lung cancer and other serious 
illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Fibreboard has been involved in a long-running battle with the insurance 
companies that had issued coverage to it over the years. Fibreboard said most 
of the insurers have previously settled the company's claims.

T-Bill Rates Rise: The Treasury sold $7.2 billion of new three-month bills at 
an average discount rate of 9.1%, up from 9% last week. Another $7.2 billion of 
six-month bills was sold at an average discount rate of 9.12%, up from 9.04% 
last week. The rates were the highest since three-month bills sold for 9.38% 
and six-month bills averaged 9.59% on Oct. 29, 1984. The new rates understate 
the actual return to investors -- 9.44% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 
bill selling for $9,770.00 and 9.69% for six-month bills selling for $9,538.90. 
The discount rate reflects the price discount received when government 
securities are purchased at less than face value.

Amgen Losses Mount: Amgen's chief executive said the Thousand Oaks 
biotechnology company faces losses in the millions of dollars for its fiscal 
year ending this month because of a court ruling that could delay federal 
approval of Amgen's new anti- anemia drug. Gordon M. Binder said the loss would 
not exceed $10 million but that Amgen had expected fourth-quarter sales of the 
drug, called erythropoietin, or EPO, to offset start-up costs. Amgen has been 
sued by its marketing partner, and a federal judge last week ordered Amgen to 
submit more data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which could delay 
FDA approval of the drug.

The government and Unisys Corp. reached a settlement under which the company 
will surrender up to $1.5 million in civil penalties and its predecessor is 
spared criminal prosecution for alleged false statements on an Air Force 
contract, the Justice Department said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement stems from alleged misrepresentations made by Sperry Corp., a 
predecessor company to Unisys, on an Air Force computerized support system 
known as the Phase IV program. 
</P>
<P>
The government had alleged that Sperry submitted false statements and claims, 
contending that it had performed all the work required by the contract between 
1983 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Sperry merged with the Burroughs Corp. to form Unisys. 
</P>
<P>
John Bolton, chief of the Justice Department's civil division, said the civil 
settlement accompanied an overall settlement of a criminal case handled by the 
U.S. Attorney's Office in Montgomery, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
Bolton said that, under the civil settlement agreement, Unisys has paid the 
government $700,000 and also will abandon a claim it filed against the Air 
Force for more than $800,000. 
</P>
<P>
James Wilson, the U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Alabama, also said 
that U.S. District Judge Joel Dubina has dismissed an Oct. 18, 1988, indictment 
against Sperry alleging that the firm made false statements on contract 
invoices. 
</P>
<P>
Dubina dismissed similar charges against Unisys in December.

Stock prices closed higher Monday, bolstered by a rising dollar and mild 
bargain hunting in the slowest trading of the year. The Dow Jones index of 30 
industrials, which fell 49.10 points last week, rebounded 14.82 points to 
2,257.86. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 6 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 112.96 million shares, down from 
153.75 million last Thursday and the lightest total since a 110.63 million 
share day on Dec. 28. 
</P>
<P>
A smattering of takeover activity and a steady dollar lent background support 
to traders looking for an excuse to hunt bargains after two weeks of setbacks 
in stocks. 
</P>
<P>
But trading was anemic, with many players reluctant to return to the market 
following the three-day Easter weekend. The market was closed for the Good 
Friday holiday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the lightest days I've seen in quite awhile," said Charles Jensen 
of MKI Securities. He said the advance was "not very convincing" and raised 
questions about its staying power. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't be impressed when volume is so light," said Larry Wachtel of 
Prudential-Bache Securities. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers attributed the tepid market to the absence of trading in Europe, where 
exchanges are still closed for the Easter holiday, and to market anxiety ahead 
of today's meeting of the Federal Reserve's key policy-making committee. 
</P>
<P>
"Europe was closed and the Japanese are winding up their fiscal year," said 
market analyst Trude Latimer of Josephthal &amp; Co, explaining the slack 
volume. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Hinkle of Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. said investors are trying to 
assess several issues, including the seriousness of inflation, further rises in 
interest rates, and whether the economy could be pushed into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
"We at Sanford C. Bernstein do not think there will be anything close to a 
recession but the marketplace is neurotic," Hinkle said. 
</P>
<P>
The market has drawn some support lately from suggestions by analysts that the 
Federal Reserve may bide its time for a while before deciding whether to 
tighten credit further. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Boskin, chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, said 
in a weekend interview that he believes interest rates are close to peaking 
out. He predicted lower rates later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
But worries have also increased of late that subsiding interest rates could be 
accompanied by a slowing of economic activity significant enough to qualify as 
a recession. 
</P>
<P>
In some scripts now being written on the Street, that would mean that corporate 
profits might also be topping out about now. 
</P>
<P>
American Medical International led the active list and jumped 3 5/8 to 21 1/2. 
An investor group led by Dr. M. Lee Pearce made a $24-a-share buyout offer for 
the company, which also announced that its board is considering a financial 
restructuring. In a related development, Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's 
Investors Service said they placed AMI's debt under review for possible 
downgrading. 
</P>
<P>
Other hospital-management stocks moved up in sympathy to the AMI buyout offer. 
Humana gained 1 to 29 5/8, and National Medical Enterprises added 1/4 to 27 
3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Polaroid fell 4 1/2 to 36. The company succeeded in fending off the takeover 
advances of Shamrock Holdings Inc. 
</P>
<P>
International Minerals &amp; Chemicals rose 2 1/8 to 41 1/4. The company said 
Curtiss-Wright Corp. had received clearance to acquire more than $15 million of 
International's stock. 
</P>
<P>
Sears Roebuck gained 1/8 to 42 1/2 in active trading. The company announced the 
sale of its Coldwell Banker commercial real estate business to the unit's 
employees and an investor group. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon was unchanged at 44 1/2, recovering from some early selling on news of 
the huge oil spill that occurred when an Exxon Shipping Co. tanker ran aground 
Friday near Valdez, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilshire index of 5,000 equities closed at 2,872.208, up 11.260, or 0.39, 
from the trading day. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained 0.68 to 
163.32. 
</P>
<P>
Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.94 to 334.73, and S&amp;P's 
500-stock composite index was up 1.59 at 290.57. 
</P>
<P>
The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market dropped 0.38 to 
400.56. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index closed at 
325.50, up 0.63. 
</P>
<P>
On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, prices eased in late trading Monday to close near 
their lows for the day after the dollar's rise to over 132 yen encouraged some 
profit taking, brokers said. The Nikkei 225-share index lost 56.12 points, or 
0.18%, to end at 31,512.40, near the low of 31,505.20. 
</P>

The London Stock Exchange was closed the Easter holiday.

The dollar headed sharply higher Monday against all key currencies, 
particularly the Japanese yen, in thin post-holiday trading. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices declined. Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bid at 
$390 an ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down $2 from late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
There was virtually no trading Friday in celebration of Good Friday. The 
European financial markets were closed for the Easter holiday until Tuesday, 
while many U.S. financial centers had scaled down operations Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Earl I. Johnson, a currency trader with Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago, said 
the dollar's advance was mainly at the yen's expense. The yen declined partly 
in reaction to a political scandal in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really a story of weak yen, more so than a strong dollar," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said higher oil prices due to the massive oil spill in Alaska also 
supported the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where global trading begins, the dollar closed at 132.30 yen, up 1.03 
yen from Friday's close. Later, in New York, the dollar stood at 132.70 yen, up 
from 131.475 yen Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose against the British pound, with sterling fetching $1.7085, 
compared to $1.7195 Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to late Thursday, included: 
1.8834 West German marks, up from 1.87375; 1.6415 Swiss francs, up from 1.6275; 
1.19305 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1905; 6.36375 French francs, up from 
6.3400, and 1,381.25 Italian lire, up from 1,376.88.

<P>
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery closed 
at $391.10 an ounce, down from $392.80 Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Silver prices also declined. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current 
delivery finished at $5.946 an ounce, compared to $6.008 Thursday.

U.S. CHIP MAKERS MUST TRY HARDER, JAPANESE FIRMS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Japan's six largest computer chip companies are now buying more than 18% of 
their chips from abroad, but they say that foreign firms will have to try 
harder if they want to grab a bigger share of the market. 
</P>
<P>
Company spokesmen say that if foreign firms are to achieve the 20% share of the 
total Japanese market that U.S. makers say they want by 1991, they have to 
supply the type of chips Japanese manufacturers need. 
</P>
<P>
The 18% average for the 1988-89 financial year is up from about 15% two years 
ago. But efforts to keep or raise those levels could run into trouble, and 
boosting sales to smaller firms -- essential if total foreign market share is 
to grow -- will be tough, the spokesmen and government officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our target is to maintain a 20% level of foreign purchases in 1991," said a 
spokesman for NEC Corp., the world's largest maker of silicon chips. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's going to be difficult," he said. 
</P>
<P>
NEC bought 20.8% of its chips from foreign firms in 1988-89, about the same 
level it was buying two years ago, the spokesman said. Most of these came from 
U.S. makers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Supply Concerns Cited 
</P>
<P>
But NEC could find it hard to maintain that level unless U.S. and other foreign 
makers start producing more of the chips that NEC needs, especially vital 
memory chips, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Such concerns were echoed by other Japanese chip makers. 
</P>
<P>
"Our target is to increase our foreign purchases bit by bit," said a spokesman 
for Toshiba, which bought 16% of its microchips from foreign sources in 
1988-89, compared to 12% in 1986-87. 
</P>
<P>
"But we want chips for use in consumer electronics products, and the foreign 
makers supply few of them, so we have to buy them from Japan," the Toshiba 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a question of whether we can buy the chips we want, at the price we want, 
when we need them," said a spokesman for Hitachi, which raised its foreign chip 
purchases to 15% in 1988-89 from about 8% in 1986-87. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. government and industry officials have charged that Japan is not living up 
to a 1986 pact on semiconductor trade in which Tokyo pledged to boost foreign 
chip makers access to the Japanese market. 
</P>
<P>
No market share figure was included in the agreement, but U.S. officials have 
said Japan committed itself to a 20% foreign share in a secret side-letter. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese government and industry officials have repeatedly denied promising any 
specific market share. 
</P>
<P>
Washington slapped 100% tariffs on $165 million worth of Japanese exports in 
1987 because of Japan's alleged failure to live up to the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
But while foreign semiconductor purchases by Japan's largest chip makers -- 
also its biggest microchip users -- are nearing the 20% level, raising the 
foreign share of Japan's total market above its current 10.6% will be tough, 
officials on both sides agree. 
</P>
<P>
What they disagree on is the reason for the uphill battle. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. industry sees Japanese companies' attitudes as a major problem. 
</P>
<P>
"The five largest (Japanese) users made efforts to improve their purchases of 
foreign semiconductors, but that change in practice has not percolated down to 
the rest of the structure," David Metz, executive director of the SIA's Japan 
office, told reporters last month. 
</P>
<P>
"The prime barrier now is the attitude that grew up over a long period of 
time," Metz said, noting that many smaller Japanese companies still believe 
foreign-made means poor quality, service and delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese makers and government officials see different obstacles to expanding 
foreign sales to smaller users. 
</P>
<P>
"The Big Six make a lot of computers and other office and industrial use 
products, so it is easier for them to use foreign chips," a Japanese trade 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
"But Americans aren't making consumer product-use chips, so the next level of 
users can't get the chips they want. It's a product mismatch," the official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. firms' sales efforts have also been criticized by some Japanese makers. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not doing enough marketing to the small users," said a Hitachi 
spokesman.

Russian watches, the ultimate anti-status status symbol, will be available in 
the United States this summer, Gruen Marketing Corp. said. 
</P>
<P>
Gruen said it had secured the rights to market Soviet-made watches, including 
the Russian military-style quartz watch that features CCCP (Union of Soviet 
Socialist Republics) and Soviet on the dial, through Wenger Ltd., a Canadian 
watch company. 
</P>
<P>
Wenger has North American distribution rights through Vremex, the official 
Soviet agency for Russian watches. 
</P>
<P>
Gruen said it has already received commitments from a number of leading 
department stores, including Bloomingdale's and Saks Fifth Avenue and will 
begin marketing the watches June 29. It did not disclose prices.

TOP BUSH AIDES SENT TO ALASKA SPILL 
</P>

President Bush today dispatched three senior federal officials to Alaska's 
oil-polluted Prince William Sound to "take a hard look at where this disaster 
stands" and said there are conflicting reports on whether Exxon's cleanup of 
the massive spill is sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
A federal takeover of the cleanup operation is one option that will be 
considered, the President told reporters at an Oval Office meeting with 
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, Environmental Protection Agency 
Administrator Bill Reilly and Coast Guard Commandant Paul Yost. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he asked the three "to go up to Alaska to take a hard look at where 
this disaster stands." They departed after leaving the White House. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Assess the Situation' 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's important these top officials, federal officials, go there and 
then they will report to me after they've had a chance to assess the situation 
on the ground," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said the spillage of 11 million gallons of oil from the tanker Exxon 
Valdez, the largest oil spill in U.S. history, was "a matter of tremendous 
concern to Alaskans and to all of us." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Exxon, which is overseeing the cleanup effort, was doing enough 
and if he was satisfied with the pace of the effort, he said: 
</P>
<P>
"They're certainly making a good beginning here, but there are some conflicting 
reports on that. I don't want to prejudge that. I think one of the things that 
we're interested in hearing is exactly how our top officials feel the cleanup 
is going." 
</P>
<P>
A federal takeover of the operation is "an option," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Bush and Skinner hinted that Exxon might face big civil penalties. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a variety of legal options that are available. But now the primary 
consideration is to make sure everything possible is being done," Skinner said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said: "The thing is to get it cleaned up, to protect the very precious 
environment out there, to make sure everything is being done to clean up this 
disaster. And then we'll have all these penalties and all that later on." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he still supports a proposal to open a pristine arctic wildlife 
refuge to oil drilling, which faces more intense scrutiny after the spill of 
millions of gallons of oil into environmentally sensitive waters off the Alaska 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no connection" between that and the oil spill, Bush said.

NBC's first broadcast of "Peter Pan" since 1973 enchanted viewers again, 
winning a respectable 27 share of the audience Friday night and helping the 
network tie CBS' all-time record of 40 weeks in a row atop the ratings, 
according to A. C. Nielsen figures released today. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's victory was not without a scare from ABC, which came within half a point 
of the leader, thanks to a strong performance by the movie "The Women of 
Brewster Place," which ranked No. 2 behind ABC's "Roseanne."

All but one of the 59 charges against an El Cerrito woman who was accused of 
prostituting her children were dropped after the youngsters told investigators 
they made the story up, prosecutors said today. 
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old woman, who has been held without bail since January, and the 
children's grandmother had been charged with pandering, aiding in the sexual 
molestation of children and furnishing drugs to minors. 
</P>
<P>
The woman's 12-year-old daughter and 9-year-old son accused her earlier this 
year of forcing them to have sex with dozens of adults and said they were given 
drugs to make them more compliant. But they said over the weekend that they had 
been neglected by their mother. She still faces a charge of felony child 
endangerment. Charges against the grandmother were dropped.

The Soviet Union lost "stable radio contact" with its backup space probe to the 
Martian moon Phobos, possibly dooming an ambitious program to scout out 
possible landing sites for a manned expedition to the planet, Tass said today. 
</P>
<P>
Last September, the Soviets lost contact and abandoned the first of the twin 
Martian probes, Phobos I, but space engineers redoubled efforts to ensure 
success of the sister probe, Phobos II, to Mars and the Martian moon Phobos. 
</P>
<P>
Tass reported that contact with Phobos II was lost on Monday when the probe 
focused its cameras to take pictures of the tiny Martian moon, which is 17 
miles wide. 
</P>
<P>
"After these operations were completed, the information was to be sent back to 
Earth, but Mission Control was unable to establish stable radio contact with 
the probe as scheduled," Tass said.

Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said today that the value of the "Star Wars" 
anti-missile defense concept was oversold during the Reagan Administration but 
that the program has potential. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said funding for the Strategic Defense Initiative, as the 
program is formally known, may have to be cut as part of Pentagon 
belt-tightening to pare the federal budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan's proposed fiscal 1990 budget called for total 
"Star Wars" spending of $5.9 billion, including $300 million for SDI research 
funded through the Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
That would represent a 44% increase over the current fiscal year -- a request 
considered unrealistically high by many members of Congress from both parties. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of interviews with U.S. television networks, Cheney said he did not 
view SDI as having the potential to block all incoming ballistic missiles. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I think I would argue . . . that oftentimes during the Reagan 
Administration it was described in terms that frankly I think oversold the 
concept," he said on NBC's "Today" show. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not 'Complete Shield' 
</P>
<P>
He added in an interview on ABC's "Good Morning America": "I don't advocate the 
view that some have in the past that it will provide a total and complete 
shield. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Reagan launched "Star Wars" on March 23, 1983, with a call to make nuclear 
weapons "impotent and obsolete" by developing the means to destroy Soviet 
missiles before they could hit U.S. soil. 
</P>
<P>
In his second inaugural address Jan. 21, 1985, Reagan described SDI research as 
designed to develop a "security shield" that would "render nuclear weapons 
obsolete."

IRAQ TO PAY $27.1 MILLION TO 37 STARK VICTIMS' KIN

The United States and Iraq have reached a tentative agreement calling for Iraq 
to pay $27.3 million to the families of 37 American sailors killed in the 1987 
missile attack on the frigate Stark, U.S. officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which totals about 92% of the amount the United States was 
seeking for the families, was accepted after what amounted to a 
take-it-or-leave-it offer to a delegation of State and Defense department 
officials who traveled to Baghdad, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The officials, who insisted on anonymity, said the American delegation had been 
called in to see Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz on Monday "and told that 
this was what (Iraqi) President (Saddam) Hussein had decided." 
</P>
<P>
"There were no negotiations," one source continued. "They just announced this 
was what they were prepared to pay." 
</P>
<P>
"It was apparent to our delegation that this was going to be the best they 
could do. They didn't dicker," another official said. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler had said Monday that the two 
sides were in "the final stages of achieving a substantial settlement on the 
claims." 
</P>
<P>
The United States submitted a $29.6-million claim for the 37 crew members who 
died on the guided missile frigate when an Iraqi jet fighter fired two 
French-made Exocet missiles at the ship on May 17, 1987. Iraq said the Persian 
Gulf attack was an accident, and the United States accepted the explanation. 
</P>
<P>
The claim was presented 11 months ago but Iraq stalled, arguing over the 
amount. The delay finally prompted the U.S. government to send a team to 
Baghdad last week, led by State Department legal adviser and trouble-shooter 
Abraham Sofaer.

After a night in which shellfire turned the sky a blazing red, thousands of 
residents poured out of Beirut today in a brief lull before rival Muslim and 
Christian gunners resumed artillery bombardments that have devastated areas of 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
Cars piled with bedding and belongings headed from both Muslim and Christian 
sectors for villages in remote areas after two weeks of fighting in which at 
least 78 people have died and 242 were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Other people left the city for villages in the south and east of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Security sources estimated that 17,000 artillery shells hit residential areas 
during the last five days after Christian army commander Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun 
vowed to drive Syrian forces from the country -- even if Beirut was flattened. 
</P>
<P>
"The night of fire covered half of Lebanon," Beirut's leftist As Safir 
newspaper said of the ferocious Christian-Muslim artillery duels overnight. 
</P>
<P>
"The sky poured rain and shells. Even thunder could not silence the thud of 
artillery explosions," the independent An Nahar added. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like living in a concentration camp of lunatics," a resident of Christian 
East Beirut said. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 4,000 shells rained down on East Beirut on Monday. About 1,000 
shells hit Muslim West Beirut and the Druze-held Shouf Mountains to the 
southeast. 
</P>
<P>
But most Lebanese, battle-wise after 14 years of civil war, survived as 
buildings crumbled in flames and smoke all around them. 
</P>
<P>
As the bombardment eased at dawn today, initial hospital casualty reports 
showed only six people killed and 12 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought I would come out alive after this horrific night. I couldn't 
breathe. I thought I was going to die of a heart attack if not of a shell," 
said one resident of East Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
"It's complete madness out there. This is the worst night we've witnessed," 
said a woman after days crammed into a shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Smoke still billowed from a fuel tank in the Dawrah oil refinery in East 
Beirut. Schools, businesses and shops stayed closed.

If the United States resents having Cuba as a neighbor, Americans can always 
move elsewhere, Cuban leader Fidel Castro said in remarks published today. 
</P>
<P>
The barb came at the end of a speech in which he warned Cubans never to lower 
their guard against imperialism and to redouble efforts in building an 
"ideological fortress." 
</P>
<P>
The Cuban leader said that as long as the United States exists "it will never 
tolerate socialism and the Cuban revolution" on its doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
"Cubans live next to imperialism. We cannot move. And even if we could we would 
not do it. Let them move," he said.

NWA Inc., the parent company of Northwest Airlines, said today that an investor 
group holding 4% of its stock is exploring the possibility of a leveraged 
buyout of the company. 
</P>
<P>
The news sent NWA's stock sharply higher. In morning trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange the stock soared $8 to $68.625 a share, a gain of 13.2%. 
</P>
<P>
NWA has been rumored as a takeover target, partly because of its holdings of 
prime real estate parcels in Tokyo, the world's most valuable market for land. 
</P>
<P>
NWA did not identify the group, but signaled that it would oppose a buyout, 
saying its board has determined the company's interests are best served by 
staying independent. In a leveraged buyout a company is taken private in a 
transaction financed primarily by debt.

force to study the use of alternative fuels for vehicles into the 1990s.

The West Virginia Democrat was in Detroit to meet with the nation's top auto

gasoline, such as methanol or natural gas.

He also said such a program to develop alternative fuels would put unemployed 
farmers and coal miners back to work.

The National Alternative Fuels Task Force will include representatives from 
General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co., Chrysler Corp., the National Coal Assn., 
United Mine Workers of America and major oil companies.

Ingersoll Publications plans to hit the streets with a daily newspaper called 
the St. Louis Sun in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
The morning paper will be a direct competitor of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, 
the city's only daily since the St. Louis Globe-Democrat closed in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper will be published seven days a week and will be operated directly 
by Ralph Ingersoll II, chairman and chief executive officer of Ingersoll 
Publications Co. 
</P>
<P>
Ingersoll Publications Co. said the Sun will be committed to "active, 
constructive involvement in the community's life" and will also emphasize 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
Ingersoll will be chairman and editor in chief and Thomas M. Tallarico, a 
senior vice president of the Post-Dispatch, will be the publisher. 
</P>
<P>
Tallarico submitted his resignation today. 
</P>
<P>
Ingersoll said in the statement that his company has invested more than $100 
million in the St. Louis area with its non-daily publications and is committing 
millions more to establish the Sun. 
</P>
<P>
Ingersoll Publications, a privately held company that had revenues of more than 
$700 million in 1988, operates 40 daily newspapers and more than 150 non-daily 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Circulation of the Ingersoll group daily newspapers exceeds more than 1.25 
million.

NBC announced today that it will televise the 1990 and 1991 NHL All-Star games, 
the first time the league will be on network television in nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The games on Sunday, Jan. 20, 1990, and Jan. 21, 1991, will be accompanied by a 
televised "Legends" game on SportsChannel America cable on the preceding 
Saturdays that will also include as-yet-to-be-determined other competition. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Nixon, the NHL's vice president for broadcasting, said it was modeled 
after the NBA's All-Star weekend, which includes a Sunday game on CBS and the 
other competitions on TBS cable Saturday. Nixon said he believed this would be 
the first time the NHL all-star game would be on network television. 
</P>
<P>
CBS carried the last NHL game on network television on May 24, 1980, when the 
New York Islanders beat the Philadelphia Flyers in the sixth game of the 
Stanley Cup finals to win the first of their four NHL titles. NBC last 
televised NHL games in 1975.

290 SOVIET ATHLETES PUNISHED FOR DRUG USE, MOSCOW PAPER REPORTS

<P>
In the second revelation on rampant Soviet doping practices in less than a 
week, a Moscow newspaper reported today that 290 Soviet athletes were punished 
for using forbidden drugs in the three years before last summer's Olympic 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
"In the three pre-Olympic years, the anti-doping laboratory of the Sports 
Committee had to work hard -- 290 of our athletes and trainers were punished 
for doping," the newspaper Leninskoye Znamya (Leninist Banner) said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Soviet magazine Smena (Change) revealed that Soviet Olympic 
athletes had their urine secretly prechecked for steroid use in a heavily 
guarded $2.5-million laboratory on a ship docked near Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tightening Control 
</P>
<P>
Leninskoye Znamya reported that the Soviet sports establishment is tightening 
control over illegal drug use by athletes by expanding its spot-testing and 
introducing new punishments. 
</P>
<P>
"The struggle against doping is entering a new phase," Vasily Gromyko, deputy 
chairman of the State Sports Committee, was quoted as saying by the newspaper. 
"Now we're starting to spot-test athletes during training," not just before 
competitions. 
</P>
<P>
A new agreement with the U.S. Olympic Committee will grant Soviet and American 
monitors the right to test each other's athletes, Leninskoye Znamya reported. A 
Soviet delegation will fly to the United States for the first round of testing 
within days, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet sports committee also plans to start publishing the names of 
athletes who are disqualified and punished for doping, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also revealed that world-class speed skater Liudmila Filimonova 
was barred from competition for two years after testing positive for forbidden 
hormones before the recent winter Spartakiad, a Soviet national competition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Denials Contradicted 
</P>
<P>
She and her trainer repeatedly denied that she was taking steroids, but tests 
in East Germany and Moscow contradicted her, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
The Smena article said that dozens of cases of doping were revealed among 
competitors in a recent Soviet youth Olympics and that many athletes were 
encouraged to use steroids by their trainers or team doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Some Soviet athletes, particularly in track and field and weightlifting, have 
withdrawn from competitions after secret tests revealed that they would not be 
able to pass official testing, Smena said.

require at least several more weeks," John Dowd said in a statement released by 
his law office in the nation's capital. "Rumors to the contrary are inaccurate 
and prompted this clarification." 
</P>
<P>
He characterized his committee's work as complicated and time-consuming. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner's office has never given details of what it called "serious 
allegations," but other sources have said the investigation deals with Rose's 
betting activities.

Left-hander Neal Heaton, who was unimpressive in his spring training bid for a 
spot in the Montreal Expos' starting rotation, was traded to the Pittsburgh 
Pirates today for a player to be named later. 
</P>
<P>
With Randy Johnson and Brian Holman securing the fourth and fifth spots on the 
pitching staff, Heaton became expendable. He did not help his cause with 
several mediocre outings during the exhibition season and had an 8.57 earned 
run average. 
</P>
<P>
"They know what they're doing when they don't put spring training statistics on 
the backs of bubble gum cards," Heaton said jokingly. 
</P>
<P>
Heaton was obtained by Montreal on Feb. 3, 1987, as part of the deal in which 
the Minnesota Twins acquired relief ace Jeff Reardon. Heaton had a 16-16 record 
in two seasons with Montreal.

The Kansas City Royals ended talks with Boston today over a possible trade for 
Red Sox third baseman Wade Boggs. 
</P>
<P>
Royals General Manager John Schuerholz told Boston General Manager Lou Gorman 
that nothing could be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to do anything with them," Schuerholz said. "There is no deal 
with the Red Sox, and there won't be." 
</P>
<P>
Schuerholz met with Gorman this morning at the Red Sox camp. 
</P>
<P>
Trade rumors had the Royals sending third baseman Kevin Seitzer and left-handed 
pitcher Floyd Bannister to the Red Sox for Boggs and a pitcher. There were also 
rumors of a three-way trade with Kansas City, Boston and the New York Mets 
involving Boggs and Royals right fielder Danny Tartabull. 
</P>
<P>
Boggs has angered the Boston management by his continued willingness to talk 
about his four-year affair with Margo Adams.

The Detroit Tigers reduced their roster to 28 players by asking waivers on 
veteran outfielder Dwayne Murphy for the purpose of giving him his 
unconditional release. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, 34, batted .300 (9 for 30) this spring with three home runs and five 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Tigers Manager Sparky Anderson said at the start of spring training that 
Murphy, who played for the Oakland A's through most of the 1980s, would be 
platooned this season with Gary Pettis in center field and also possibly be the 
lead-off hitter. 
</P>
<P>
"He can still hit but he doesn't run as well as he used to nor throw as well," 
Anderson said Monday. "And we can't afford the luxury of a part-time DH and 
pinch-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll still hit 20 home runs for somebody if he hits enough." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, hit .250 in 49 games last year with Detroit.

SHELBY HOMERS IN 13TH AS DODGERS BEAT METS

It wasn't as dramatic as Kirk Gibson's 12th-inning, game-winning home run in 
Game 4 of last year's National League championship series, but John Shelby will 
take it. 
</P>
<P>
Shelby hit a two-run homer with one out in the bottom of the 13th inning Monday 
to give the Dodgers a 5-3 exhibition victory over the new York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
It was Shelby's second homer of the spring and his second hit of the game. 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't been a good spring for Shelby, whose batting average had dipped to 
.174. But he said he has been more concerned with working on his timing and 
batting stroke than hitting for average. 
</P>
<P>
"It was nice to get this homer, but the spring hasn't been frustrating for me 
at all," Shelby said. "I'm down here in a position where I can work on some 
things and that's what I've been doing. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, I've had to fight for a job every spring. Now I have a job and 
I'm in a situation where I can work on things and I'm taking advantage of it. 
</P>
<P>
"The work I've been doing may not show up in the statistics, but I'm not 
worrying about that right now. It's going to pay off during the regular 
season." 
</P>
<P>
Shelby's homer came off Jack Savage (0-2) after a single by Chris Gwynn. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie left-hander Mike Munoz, who blanded the Mets on one hit over the final 
two innings, was the winner. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn went 3 for 6 to lead the Dodgers' 12-hit attack, while rookie outfielder 
Mark Griffin had three hits in his first spring start. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Murray had two hits. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg Jeffries and Mackey Sasser had two hits each for the Mets, who had only 
eight hits off five Dodger pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
David Cone was the Mets' starter, and he pitched six strong innings, allowing 
the Dodgers two runs on six hits while walking three and striking out four. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger rookie Ramon Martinez allowed the Mets two runs in his five innings on 
the mound, giving up three hits and striking out one. 
</P>
<P>
In a split-squad game Monday at West Palm Beach, Mike Davis had a two-run homer 
and a double in a 10-4 loss to the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves had 17 hits, including four each by Jeff Treadway and Andres Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Treadway, acquired for a reported $50,000 Saturday from the Cincinnati Reds, is 
now 5 of 6 for the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
Treadway, a second baseman, had an RBI single in a five-run fourth inning off 
loser William Brennan (0-1) as the Braves sent 10 men to the plate and had six 
consecutive singles. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson, who came up with a sore right shoulder following his second spring 
game Sunday, participated in a limited workout Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson did not swing a bat, but ran and shagged fly balls. He was re-examined 
by team physician Dr. Frank Jobe, who said he still believes the injury is not 
serious. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers announced they have traded minor league catcher Gilberto Reyes to 
Montreal in order to retain the rights to right-hander Brian Fischer. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers had selected Fischer off Montreal's triple-A roster in the major 
league draft last December. If Fischer had not made the opening-day roster, the 
Dodgers would have had to offer him back to Montreal for half the drafting 
price of $50,000.
