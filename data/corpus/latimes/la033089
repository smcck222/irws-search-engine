PAY FOR JUDGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article advocating higher pay for federal judges was rather one-sided and 
failed to mention several important points. Perhaps the most important is the 
retirement system for federal judges. It is the world's best. He or she can 
retire at age 65 on full salary after only 15 years service (Title 18 U.S. Code 
S. 371). By comparison, most other federal employees have to put in 40 years of 
service to earn the maximum retirement benefit of 80%. 
</P>
<P>
Another item omitted is that several federal judges now serving prison terms 
would have been entitled to the 51% salary increase. More significantly, the 
Associated Press recently reported that well over 100 federal senior judges (a 
senior judge is semi-retired) who have refused to hear any cases since 
requesting senior status would have been included in the salary increase along 
with their more active colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there is a vast difference between what $89,500 will buy in Los 
Angeles or Denver than in, say, Boise or Fort Smith. There should be 
differences in pay levels among judges in small, medium-sized and large cities.

GOVERNOR'S REPLY TO EDITORIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to my recent letter (March 15), you published three lengthy 
editorials which unmasked your definition of vision: higher taxes and more 
spending (March 15-17). There is virtually no limit to the big-spending, 
high-tax programs you want to impose on the workers and businesses of our 
state. These editorials alone call for spending an additional $2.6 billion in 
the coming year and you don't make any effort to price them for the out years. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, you conveniently neglected to account for many other spending 
increases you have called for in the recent past. Last year alone, The Times 
ran at least 70 editorials on the state budget and state programs. Only once 
did you call for a reduction in spending, and that was for $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
In all the other editorials, you advocated increased spending, higher taxes, or 
both -- yet the costs of many of the proposals were not factored into the 
spending totals mentioned in your response. Did you forget, or should we now 
consider those editorials "inoperative"? 
</P>
<P>
Your call to slash our prudent reserve by more than a half is not very wise. To 
follow your advice would be to put California's fiscal solvency and our 
triple-A bond rating in serious jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
I find your advocacy of closing tax loopholes understandable and self-serving. 
You want to apply taxes to lawyers' services, but you failed to mention the 
sales tax exemption on the sales of newspapers and advertising revenues 
received by newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Since you have called for tax increases, can we expect that you will begin by 
publicly advocating that the sales tax be applied to newspaper sales and 
advertising revenues? The Times Mirror Co. can seek the introduction of 
legislation to accomplish that in the state Legislature. If you cannot do this, 
I think your readers deserve an explanation justifying the continuation of 
these exemptions at the same time you advocate taxing lawyers' services. 
</P>
<P>
In your editorials you bemoan the fact that Californians have received what you 
have calculated to be $115 billion in tax breaks during the past 10 years. If 
the people had followed your advice, they would have paid out $115 billion more 
in taxes. I'd like to suggest that you run for governor on that platform and 
bring your record of bigger spending and higher taxes to the voters. Then let 
the voters decide. 
</P>
<P>
I haven't received your voluntary additional tax payment. 
</P>
<P>
 (Editor's note: The governor's March 15 letter noted that Times Mirror Co., 
publisher of the Los Angeles Times, made $332 million in 1988 and stated, "We 
will gladly accept your voluntary higher tax payments.") 
</P>
<P>
 After publishing 87 column inches of reply editorials, versus my letter of 10 
inches, you have now published an 8-page slick reprint and mailed it to 
selective persons. You have apparently decided not to "put up or shut up." 
</P>
<P>
P.S. I'm still waiting for your check. Is it in the mail?

PAY FOR JUDGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Poor Judge Carrigan! It was all I could do to hold back the tears upon reading 
about the terrible life of Carrigan. 
</P>
<P>
First, he had to liquidate many of his financial holdings in order to send his 
children "through college and graduate school"; and only the finest private 
schools like Notre Dame sufficed. Welcome to the real world, Judge Carrigan! 
How about the thousands upon thousands of parents who earn but a small 
percentage of Carrigan's salary and yet manage to sacrifice virtually 
everything in life in order to help provide some degree of access to the 
educational system? Worse yet, how many tens of thousands of willing young 
people are forced to forgo a college education due to the severe financial 
structures such an undertaking entails? Is it just only recently that Carrigan 
has learned that capitalism is inherently unfair; that our society is replete 
with a myriad of institutionalized inequities? 
</P>
<P>
Tears also welled up in my eyes upon reading that Carrigan had to sell of "half 
interest in the family's Rocky Mountain retreat." I have heard this sad tale of 
woe countless times from many of the families in the inner-city in Los Angeles 
whose children attend our public schools. Their hearts go out to you, Judge 
Carrigan! 
</P>
<P>
And lest we be accused of being sexist, let's hear it for poor Beverly 
Carrigan. I mean, sure she could return to a menial and "low-paying occupation" 
like "social work." But, alas, being a "bride of the '50s" who likes 
"traditional things," it is simply not possible for her to work in order to 
supplement the family income. Again, I believe that I can speak for thousands 
of working mothers -- many of them single -- when I say that our hearts go out 
to you! 
</P>
<P>
One last point, Judge Carrigan. If you think you are not being paid adequately 
for your abilities and worth, I suggest that you try teaching for a while in 
the public school system for a starting salary in the low $20,000 range.

COLLEGE BOARD ENDORSEMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Community College District is at a turning point. It has a new 
chancellor, comparative labor peace and an opportunity to put into effect 
far-reaching reforms passed by the Legislature. The decisions made by the 
districts' board of trustees, including three members up for election April 11, 
will determine how well the nine local community colleges respond to these 
changes, in the way they write their budgets as well as in the approaches they 
use to help both vocationally oriented students and those who want to go on to 
four-year universities. 
</P>
<P>
We are endorsing the following candidates: 
</P>
<P>
Office No. 2 -- Rose Ochi has demonstrated as one of Mayor Tom Bradley's 
assistants that she gets things done. She has shown commitment to the community 
colleges both by seeking appointment for an earlier vacancy and by serving on 
the screening committee that helped select chancellor Donald Phelps. Ochi is a 
graduate of Los Angeles City College who transferred to UCLA and later earned 
both master's and law degrees. She understands the vital transfer role of the 
community colleges and their importance as an entry point for immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Her opponent, Mary Louise Longoria, has solid education credentials, but we 
think Rose Ochi has already proved her leadership and her concern for community 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Office No. 4 -- Attorney Lindsay Conner, running unopposed for a third term, 
has helped the district develop better relations with its teachers' union. He 
also has tried to tighten the performance of each campus in recruiting and 
retaining students, and deserves a vote of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Office No. 6 -- Althea R. Baker chairs the counseling department at Mission 
College. An attorney as well, she served as chief negotiator for the American 
Federation of Teachers local in its bargaining last year with the trustees. 
That union is widely perceived as having heavy influence on the college 
trustees, but it is a union that seems now to want to work more smoothly with 
the college administrators while still standing strongly for better pay and 
working conditions. Baker and her colleagues successfully negotiated a new 
contract in six weeks instead of the six months of confrontation that had been 
the norm. All seven of the current college trustees have endorsed her for this 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Baker's principal opponent, Patricia Hollingworth, a teacher at L.A. Trade 
Tech, has good credentials, especially in the area of community college 
financial management. But Baker has a track record of commitment. 
</P>
<P>
We believe that with the addition of Rose Ochi and Althea Baker and the 
reelection of Lindsay Conner, the community college trustees will gain strength 
for tackling the changes they face in the coming years.

WHAT WENT WRONG? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 240,000 barrels of crude oil that have spewed from the ruptured hull of the 
tanker Exxon Valdez since it ran aground Friday have blackened more than the 
pristine waters of Alaska's Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
They also have sullied the credibility of Exxon Co. U.S.A, which owns the 
vessel, of Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., which manages the trans-Alaskan 
pipeline and of the state and federal officials whose responsibility it is to 
see that these private firms operate in a responsible manner. 
</P>
<P>
This is a harsh judgment, but the facts of this shocking and unnecessary 
environmental catastrophe make no other possible. These facts also make it 
mandatory that Congress take a rigorous and skeptical look at the Bush 
Administration's claim that oil drilling can be expanded into the Arctic 
National Wildlife Refuge without unacceptable consequences. 
</P>
<P>
While the tardy and inexcusably chaotic cleanup of the worst oil spill ever to 
foul American waters proceeds, vexing questions demand answers: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Why were the vessel's master, who has a history alcohol abuse, and two 
senior officers absent from the bridge when it strayed out of the shipping 
channel? Why was an unqualifiedthird mate piloting the ship? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Why did Exxon officials fail so miserably in their responsibility to have 
an effective contingency cleanup plan in place? Why didn't they have the 
requisite equipment on site? Why did the company's officials move so slowly to 
contain the spill, thereby squandering the initial two days of good weather 
that might have made a quick cleanup feasible?. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Why did Alyeska rebuff earlier offers by Valdez city officials to stockpile 
cleanup equipment, assuring the local leaders -- falsely, as it now turns out 
-- that the oil companies had adequate supplies on hand? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Why did the Alaskan state government, which has the primary responsibility 
for legal oversight of these matters, fail to exercise it? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Why has the Bush Administration been so slow to intervene into what was 
from the first day obviously a major environmental crisis? 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the President waited until Tuesday before sending senior aides to the 
scene of the spill, and even then seemed to express doubts that the federal 
government ought to take a major role in the cleanup. Bush's approach to this 
disaster is perplexing.

BATTERED WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andrea Dworkin's column ("Living in Terror, Pain: Being a Battered Wife," 
Opinion, March 12) about the realities of living in a battering situation was 
excellent. 
</P>
<P>
I am a family therapist at Cedar House, a child abuse treatment program. Many 
abused children grow up in homes where battering is a way of life. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Dworkin is correct -- unless the cycle is broken, children grow 
up and become adult victims or batterers. 
</P>
<P>
Programs like Cedar House treat the children now in an attempt to stop the 
cycle. These programs are valuable assets to the community. The programs we 
have need to be expanded, and there is a need for many additional ones.

LIKE THE EASTSIDE PRISON, IMPACT REPORT IS FLAWED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLORIA MOLINA and LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD, Los Angeles City Councilwoman 
Gloria Molina formerly represented the proposed prison site area when she was a 
member of the state Assembly. State Assemblywoman Lucille Roybal-Allard 
currently represents the area. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When testifying at last July's hearing to consider the environmental-impact 
report on the proposed downtown prison, a businessman commented that if one of 
his employees produced a report of the same abysmal quality, he would throw it 
back at him. 
</P>
<P>
A three-member panel charged with the task of evaluating the 
environmental-impact report will begin to hear testimony at another hearing 
today. If the certification panel does its job and adheres to the intent of the 
California Environmental Quality Act, it will throw the report back to state 
Department of Corrections officials and tell them to do it right next time. If 
the governor and the Legislature do their jobs, they will tell the Department 
of Corrections not to bother with another report and abandon plans for yet 
another prison near Los Angeles' Eastside. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental review of the proposed prison, located southeast of Civic Center, 
was seriously flawed before it even started. An environmental-impact report 
should evaluate impacts from a project, identify how to eliminate the negative 
ones and propose alternatives with less drastic environmental consequences. 
Thus, the impact report should provide an environmental safety net to protect 
residents from harmful effects. 
</P>
<P>
The first two gaping holes in the safety net for the environment and Eastside 
residents were carved by the Legislature with the governor's hand firmly on the 
knife. 
</P>
<P>
First, the governor and Legislature eliminated the legal mandate to examine 
alternative sites. How can the suitability of one location for a prison be 
fairly judged if it cannot be compared to others? 
</P>
<P>
In a second assault on the review process, the Legislature fashioned another 
unfair environmental loophole solely for the proposed downtown prison. This 
allowed the state to purchase the downtown land before the prison plan was 
reviewed for environmental effects. But a different standard was applied for 
the other prison authorized by the Legislature. The land for that proposed 
prison, located in Lancaster, would not be purchased until after environmental 
studies are completed. 
</P>
<P>
This difference represents a total perversion of environmental review. Either 
the state so flagrantly disregarded the rights of Eastside residents that it 
was willing to subject them to another jail despite the environmental 
consequences, or the state threw fiscal responsibility out the window by 
spending approximately $30 million on a downtown site it may never use. To make 
matters worse, the city attorney estimates that it would cost approximately $60 
million more to locate a prison downtown than at a comparable rural site. 
</P>
<P>
The final unweaving of the environmental safety net occurred in the 
environmental-impact report itself. Instead of fairly addressing the concerns 
raised by residents, the report serves to rationalize the department's 
predetermined decision to build a prison on the Eastside. It relies upon 
speculation, irrelevant studies and unconvincing analysis to defend the plan 
for the first California prison ever located in the middle of a densely 
populated urban environment. 
</P>
<P>
For years, residents opposed this prison because they are concerned about the 
safety of their children, the future of their families and the character of 
their community. It seems unfathomable that an environmental-impact report 
could conclude that placement of a prison in a community that already houses 
75% of the inmates in Los Angeles County would not affect the environment. 
Merlin the Magician could not perform this sleight of hand. 
</P>
<P>
Just consider crime and public safety. The environmental-impact report, in 
effect, says, "Don't worry -- crime won't increase." This speculative 
conclusion is derived from studies of rural prisons that have perimeter 
security and remote locations irrelevant to the discussion of a downtown site. 
And the rural sites don't suffer from the severe urban gang and crime problems 
that the downtown location has. Further, the report irresponsibly dismissed the 
Los Angeles Police Department's concern that gang activity may increase in 
communities surrounding the prison. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps the most blatantly callous conclusion contained in the report is 
the suggestion that if an escape occurs and the escapee commits another crime, 
this should not be interpreted as having a significant impact on the 
environment. Has the Department of Corrections considered the impact it will 
have on the victim? The victim's family? The community? 
</P>
<P>
The 870,000 residents who live within five miles of the proposed prison deserve 
enforcement of the laws enacted to safeguard their environment. The parents of 
the 45,000 children who attend the 36 schools located within three miles of the 
planned lockup deserve the same environmental protections parents receive in 
more affluent communities. How can the Department of Corrections' 
environmental-impact report find no cause for concern regarding the abundance 
of schools surrounding the prison site? The Department of Corrections has 
produced a report better termed an Environmental Indifference Report. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, this pattern can stop. The certification panel can alter the 
course by rejecting the report. Then it's up to the Department of Corrections 
to pull the plug on this wasteful spending of public funds, search for a more 
appropriate prison site, and get on with the crucial prison expansion program.

IF YOU DANCE WITH KADAFI ON CHEMICAL ARMS, KISS THE AMERICAN MARKET GOODBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DOLE, Bob Dole is the Senate minority leader. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every day, step by step, Libya's lunatic leader, Moammar Kadafi, comes closer 
and closer to producing chemical weapons and perfecting the means to deliver 
them over long distances. If he gets there -- and he might well, not in years 
but in months -- we've got a new and deadly ball game in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
And Kadafi is not the only problem. Iraq not only has but has used chemical 
weapons in its war with Iran. Iran and Syria are hellbent on developing their 
own chemical weapons capability. And other Third World nations are moving in 
the same direction. 
</P>
<P>
The evil genie is already out of the bottle. There may still be time to get him 
back in there, but only if we act now. 
</P>
<P>
We've got the right overall policy. Our aim is to eliminate chemical weapons 
entirely. In fact, we've been reducing our own stockpiles of chemical weapons 
for years. The Soviets have now said they will start destroying theirs, too. I 
hope so. But let's make sure this offer is not just a sham, designed to get us 
to halt production of the newer, safer binary chemical weapons that we have 
developed to help offset the massive Soviet stockpiles and production lines. We 
have to make sure the world -- allies and adversaries alike -- understand this 
bottom line: The United States is prepared to agree to the destruction of all 
of our chemical weapons when the Soviets are ready to sign a binding, 
worldwide, verifiable agreement to ban all such weapons. 
</P>
<P>
But even as we try to negotiate this global ban, more and more nations seek to 
acquire chemical weapons. We're trying to stop them by pushing the adoption of 
a major international agreement to control the export of technology and 
equipment. We made some progress on that score recently at the Paris conference 
on chemical weapons. That must remain a top priority. But we also have to face 
facts: We're not going to have a good agreement for many months, perhaps years. 
</P>
<P>
We can't just sit back and wait for that day. We have to act now, with every 
bit of leverage we have. If Kadafi takes that last step and starts producing 
chemical weapons, we should make clear our determination to do whatever is 
necessary to deny him the opportunity to use his deadly new toys. 
</P>
<P>
And we have to do one other thing. According to many reports, Japanese and West 
European firms, in a sickening pursuit of the almighty dollar, or yen, or 
Deutsche mark, are helping Kadafi and his crowd produce chemical weapons or 
develop the means to deliver them. No firm that knowingly engages in that kind 
of reckless activity deserves the right to profit from the American market. 
That's why Sens. Jake Garn, John Heinz and others from both parties have joined 
me in introducing legislation that states this sound and simple proposition: If 
you deal with the likes of Kadafi on chemical weapons, you can kiss the 
American market goodby. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the bill requires the President to investigate and report on any 
firms engaged in such activity, and then bans all such firms from selling their 
products in America or contracting with our government anywhere in the world 
for many years. 
</P>
<P>
Do we have the right to take such action? You bet we do. Our security 
interests, our allies and friends, the lives of American citizens, they're all 
at stake. 
</P>
<P>
Do we need to take such action? We have to. If we don't, who will? 
</P>
<P>
And finally, do we need to act now? We had better. Because one of these 
tomorrows, it may be too late.

NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: RESEARCHERS ASSAIL LACK OF CALCIUM IN WOMEN'S DIETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONI TIPTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The scientific community, including the National Research Council (NRC) and 
U.S. Surgeon Gen. C. Everett Koop, has a bone to pick with women who regularly 
fail to meet the Recommended Dietary Allowance of 800 milligrams of calcium or 
who do so by swallowing calcium tablets in lieu of low-fat foods. There is 
concern that the importance of continuously replenishing the body's supply of 
the mineral through dietary sources has been under-evaluated and overshadowed 
by the fear of fat in the diet. 
</P>
<P>
A report released earlier this month by the NRC stressed the need for young and 
adolescent women to increase their intake of dietary calcium. The Surgeon 
General's Report on Nutrition and Health, published last year, also addressed 
this topic. 
</P>
<P>
"Calcium is an essential nutrient," the NRC report stated. "It is necessary for 
adequate growth and skeletal development. Certain segments of the population, 
especially women and adolescents, need to make careful food choices to obtain 
adequate calcium from the food supply. The committee recommends that 
consumption of low- and nonfat dairy products and dark green vegetables, which 
are rich sources of calcium, can assist in maintaining calcium intake at 
approximately the RDA levels." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the report continues, "the potential benefits of calcium intake 
above the RDAs to prevent osteoporosis or hypertension are not well-documented 
and do not justify the use of calcium supplements." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Intake Drops 
</P>
<P>
Figures taken from the USDA's nationwide food consumption survey found that in 
1985 women between the ages of 19 and 34 managed to achieve only about 80% of 
the RDA of calcium from food sources. Calcium intake for women in the 35- to 
50-year-old age range, dropped to as low as 68% of the RDA -- which is itself 
under scrutiny for being too low. 
</P>
<P>
And since 1984, when a National Institutes of Health panel concluded that 
post-menopausal women needed twice the RDA of calcium and pre-menopausal women 
needed 1 1/2 times the RDA, supplement sales have "skyrocketed," USDA reports. 
</P>
<P>
To improve consumer intake of dietary calcium, researchers have launched a 
triple attack. They are re-emphasizing the importance of building bone during 
the formative years, noting that older women consuming less than half the 
calcium needed over a prolonged period can suffer a loss of nearly 5% of spinal 
bone per year. They are stressing that the female hormone estrogen has a 
significant role in bone loss. And they are citing the negative effects of 
meeting the recommended goal through supplementation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Best Insurance 
</P>
<P>
Research data indicates that taking extra calcium after menopause probably 
doesn't slow bone loss and building additional bone during youth -- when the 
soft tissue inside the bones is in a continuous state of development -- is the 
best insurance against osteoporosis later in life. 
</P>
<P>
This was underscored most recently when studies of high calcium intake in older 
rats were completed. The research was directed by Dr. James C. Smith, head of 
the Vitamin and Mineral Nutrition Laboratory at Beltsville, Md., part of the 
government's Agricultural Research Service. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a body of evidence that the best way is to build up the bones 
before menopause," Smith said in an interview, adding, "but I haven't worked 
with women." 
</P>
<P>
His investigation was conducted at the Beltsville lab by University of Maryland 
graduate students under the direction of Joseph H. Soares, nutrition professor. 
</P>
<P>
It is scientific fact that the body's ability to absorb calcium is variable 
with age. During typical periods of growth, intestinal absorption of calcium 
increases, with infants and children absorbing up to 60% of the calcium they 
ingest. Pregnant women use about 50% and other adults only retain about 30%. 
Calcium available from supplements is often even less, depending upon the 
binders used in the product, which can hold onto the calcium and prevent the 
body from using it. The ability of an individual's stomach acid to dissolve the 
supplements also is associated with malabsorption. 
</P>
<P>
And there are other factors: bone loss accelerates naturally after age 35 and 
becomes more and more difficult to retard with age; after menopause a steady 
decline of estrogen -- an important component in bone mineralization -- is 
observed, and the process of bone development appears to slow down as an animal 
ages, making the bones solid, more brittle and thus less efficient at storing 
calcium. 
</P>
<P>
(Ninety-nine percent of the body's calcium is stored in the bones and teeth. 
But it is used for various bodily functions. These include: regulating cell and 
nerve functions, maintaining normal blood pressure, muscle contraction 
capabilities including maintaining heartbeat, clotting of blood and preserving 
the material that holds cells together.) 
</P>
<P>
"The high calcium intake did not affect bone dynamics in the aged female rats 
but increased bone formation in the young rats," said Rashmi Sinha, the 
nutritionist who conducted the study. "Just taking a lot of calcium later in 
life, without replacing the female hormones, is not going to increase bone 
formation as it does earlier in life." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Risk of Cancer 
</P>
<P>
But estrogen replacement therapy is associated with an increased risk for 
endometrial cancer and requires ongoing medical follow-up, according to Dr. 
Bess Dawson Hughes, director of the Calcium and Bone Research Laboratory at the 
USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University. She is 
currently conducting a five-year study of 360 post-menopausal women to 
determine the benefit of taking calcium, how much is necessary to minimize bone 
loss and the potential hazards associated with calcium supplementation. 
Preliminary results indicate that with extremely low intakes of calcium -- 
below the current U.S. intake level of 600 milligrams -- there is some benefit, 
even without estrogen replacement therapy. 
</P>
<P>
"The study suggests that postmenopausal women most likely to benefit from 
increased calcium are those who consume less than 400 milligrams a day, the 
equivalent of 1 1/3 glasses of milk," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"If our research shows calcium can retard bone loss in some women regardless of 
estrogen, that's good news, because estrogen replacement therapy isn't for 
everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Osteoporosis is the gradual loss of bone mineral from the skeleton, occuring in 
millions of American women (and some men), and it "goes on for many, many 
years," she said. It starts as early as age 20 and continues at a rate of 1% a 
year in women throughout their lives. The rate in men is about .25% per year. 
</P>
<P>
This deterioration typically starts out in the spine, and manifests itself as a 
compression fracture. It is a very common disorder, according to Dawson Hughes, 
who estimated that one out of every four white women over the age of 60 will be 
afflicted with the ailment. There are a number of factors that increase risk. 
</P>
<P>
Since women have less bone to start with and tend to lose it at a greater rate 
from their spines, being a female is the primary factor, said Dawson Hughes. 
Being either Asian or Caucasian is another. Family history has a role, as does 
a lifetime of low calcium intake. Early menopause, low body weight, sedentary 
life style, bearing no children, alcohol abuse, high sodium intake, cigarette 
smoking, high caffeine intake, high protein intake and high phosphorus intake 
are others. 
</P>
<P>
One conclusion that can be drawn is that younger women, who typically are 
deficient in calcium as well as iron, should adjust their diets to include at 
least three servings of dairy products and other calcium-rich foods per day, 
instead of relying on supplements. 
</P>
<P>
According to the National Dairy Board, a serving size is: 1 cup milk, 8 ounces 
yogurt, 1 1/2 ounces natural cheese or 2 ounces processed cheese. 
</P>
<P>
Drinking nonfat or low-fat milk is the most efficient way to accomplish this. 
One (8-ounce) serving of fluid nonfat milk provides about 90 calories, less 
than a gram of fat and 300 milligrams of calcium. The same size serving of 1% 
low-fat milk offers 102 calories, 3 grams fat and 300 milligrams calcium. 
One-cup of whole milk provides the most calories and fat for its calcium 
benefit -- 150 calories, 8 grams fat and 291 grams calcium -- while 2% low fat 
has just slightly less calories and fat: 121 and 5 grams fat for its 297 grams 
calcium. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meeting Dairy Requirement 
</P>
<P>
If drinking milk is not an option, here are some dairy and non-dairy foods 
which in combination can help meet the daily requirement: 1 ounce of low-fat 
cheese, such as part-skim mozzarella adds 200 milligrams calcium; 1 cup low-fat 
cottage cheese offers about 140 milligrams calcium, 1 cup low-fat fruit-added 
yogurt, 345; 3 ounces canned salmon with bones, 180, and 3 ounces sardines, 300 
milligrams. 
</P>
<P>
Dark leafy vegetables, in general, are rich in calcium, but some, such as kale, 
broccoli and beet greens, are the best absorbed. Other types, such as spinach 
and turnip greens, contain a naturally occuring calcium binder, which tends to 
hold on to the calcium. 
</P>
<P>
Some processed foods, because of fortification or a calcium-salt additive used 
in the manufacturing process, are also good sources of dietary calcium. These 
include tofu (bean curd), canned tomatoes, stone-ground or self-rising flour 
and blackstrap molasses. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to increasing low-fat sources of calcium in the diet, women are 
encouraged to develop a regular routine of exercise. This helps maintain bone 
mass and stimulates new bone formation. Although Dawson Hughes admits that the 
exact role of exercise in the maintenance of bone mass remains a little 
unclear, it appears that it is "very, very important." 
</P>
<P>
She said it apparently increased bone density in a studied population 
representing a cross section of women of all ages -- particularly those who 
previously were extremely sedentary. 
</P>
<P>
In another study, women who exercised for one hour, three times a week 
increased their bone mineral content by 1% over a one-year period. Those, who 
did not decreased their bone mineral content by the same amount. 
</P>
<P>
"If you took the balance on a daily basis," she explained, "the exercisers were 
gaining 42 milligrams of calcium for their bodies. You have about 100,000 
milligrams in your body, so that doesn't sound like much. But every day, day 
in, day out, that adds up . . . . It's a very effective means of impact on your 
bones." 
</P>
<P>
To help in designing a calcium-conscious life style, consider some of the 
following recipes, which are based upon a popular Oriental cooking ingredient 
and non-dairy substitute, bean curd.

DEAR JEANNE: This recipe appeared in a newspaper recently. It's yummy, and we 
love it, but a quart of heavy cream? Can you help, please? 
</P>
<P>
 -- LIZ DOERING, Minneapolis, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TRADEWINDS CHICKEN FETTUCCINE 
</P>
<P>
2 pounds fettuccine noodles 
</P>
<P>
4 cups whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 tablespoons chopped garlic 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons powdered chicken base 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper 
</P>
<P>
2 cups freshly grated imported Parmesan cheese 
</P>
<P>
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cubed 
</P>
<P>
1 ounce butter or margarine 
</P>
<P>
Freshly chopped parsley 
</P>
<P>
Cook noodles according to package directions. Drain and cool. 
</P>
<P>
Reduce cream by 1/4 in saucepan over low heat. While reducing, add garlic, 
powdered chicken base and white pepper, stirring occasionally. When reduced, 
add cheese slowly while whipping with wire whisk until sauce has consistency of 
shake or malt. 
</P>
<P>
Saute chicken meat in butter or margarine in large non-stick saute pan over 
high heat. Stir and break up pieces. When outside of chicken is cooked, add 
sauce, reduce heat to medium and add noodles. Stir 5 to 10 minutes or until 
hot, being careful not to scorch. 
</P>
<P>
Garnish with parsley. Makes 4 to 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR LIZ: I agree, a quart of heavy cream is excessive -- and the fat and 
cholesterol can be dangerous. There are some other problems with this recipe, 
however. When I made it I realized that it yields about 16 cups, which means 
that if you are feeding six people, each one would have to eat almost three 
cups. 
</P>
<P>
I think a more realistic number of servings for this recipe would be 10 to 12. 
You will notice the difference this makes in the bottom-line figures when you 
compare the original recipe as figured for six servings and the revised figured 
for 12 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Another change you might want to make is to cut the recipe in half unless you 
are planning to serve it for company. You might also find that you can make the 
recipe without the noodles, then serve it as a sauce over pasta and keep the 
unused portion of sauce in the freezer. 
</P>
<P>
I substituted low-fat milk for the cream and eliminated the chicken base 
altogether since it contains sodium and MSG. I also reduced the amount of 
cheese called for, to help lower the calories and fat, as well as sodium. This 
revision will not taste as "fatty" as the original, but the garlic and cheese 
flavors will be more predominant. 
</P>
<P>

LIVER AND ONIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The secret of this recipe for classic Liver and Onions is the long, slow 
cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Cook the onions at least 20 minutes, during which time they will develop a rich 
brown color and release their natural sweet taste. 
</P>
<P>
Prepare the liver while the onions are cooking by cutting it into thin, even 
strips. By slicing the liver in this fashion you enable it to cook thoroughly 
in only about 3 minutes. The short cooking time gives the liver a velvety 
texture and helps it achieve the maximum flavor. Add a drop of vinegar or lemon 
juice at the end of the cooking time to further enhance the flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Peel and quarter 2 large onions and slice thinly. In large skillet heat 2 
tablespoons oil, then add onions and season to taste with salt and pepper. 
Cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are golden brown, about 20 minutes. 
Move onions to edge of pan, add 2 tablespoons oil and heat until hot. 
</P>
<P>
Add 1 pound calf's liver, cut into strips, and cook, stirring constantly, about 
3 minutes or until done. Sprinkle juice of 1 lemon over liver, then stir with 
onions. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons chopped parsley. Makes 4 servings.

THE KITCHEN CABINET: A GOOD PLACE TO COOK UP WEDDING GIFT IDEAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MINNIE BERNARDINO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the market for a wedding present? Try something for the couple's kitchen, 
which is always a great source for potential gift ideas. Varying in price 
range, the item could be anywhere from a nifty culinary gadget such as a small 
lemon reamer to a major appliance -- an upscale noise-free dishwasher, for 
instance. 
</P>
<P>
The duplication problem of ending up with a bridal present that stands the 
chance of becoming a candidate for store return or exchange may be avoided by 
providing an unusual but useful gift. Kitchen Whiz from Seiko Instruments is a 
brand new product that fits the needs of experienced and novel cooks, 
particularly dieters and those who adapt recipes from publications. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Than a Calculator 
</P>
<P>
Nicely packaged, Kitchen Whiz ($59.95) is a recipe conversion calculator and 
more. The first of its kind, the invention was based on an original design by 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. My first impression of this 
electronic device was that it seemed complicated to operate. But once 
directions were read (they were rather easy to comprehend by the way), the 
operation was surprisingly simple. The only requirement is to remember the 
techniques, which become easier through frequent use; otherwise it's just as 
easy to go over directions again. 
</P>
<P>
With the touch of a few buttons, you can program and convert to the desired 
number of servings from a larger or smaller recipe. Each ingredient can be 
reduced or increased proportionally with a simple formula. Other applications 
of the tool include controlling meal portions (which is terrific for dieters), 
converting recipes from metric to English weights and measures, computing 
cooking times for roasts and converting temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
The Kitchen Whiz also acts as a food preparation timer with a beep, a clock, a 
calendar and to say the least, a mathematical calculator. Unlike other 
calculators, the numerical figures and words in the washable key pad are easy 
to read and sensitive to the touch. Equally legible is the display screen with 
8-digit, 12-character dot matrix. The computer measures 8 1/2 by 4 1/2 by 1 1/2 
and is fitted with a special bar on the back for propping on a countertop or 
hanging on the wall. The Kitchen Whiz operates on two size AA batteries and 
comes with a full one-year warranty. For more information on the product, call 
Seiko Instruments' toll-free number: (800) 837-4568. 
</P>
<P>
Not an uncommon bridal gift is a set of cookware. For everyday cooking, 
particularly by those interested in low-fat dishes, nonstick cookware has fared 
very well in the past several years. Among the lines that have been successful 
is T-Fal. Attractive, lightweight and good heat conductors with its aluminum 
base, T-Fal nonstick cookware sets feature porcelain enameled pans in a variety 
of colors with heat resistant handles. The custom-fitted stainless steel covers 
are equipped with adjustable safety steam-vented cover knobs to help prevent 
boil-overs. 
</P>
<P>
The latest from this French-based company is the Classic Series ($70 for an 
eight-piece set), featuring an elegant pewter gray and etched trim look. The 
outside has a special nonstick coating too for even quicker cleanups. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gift of Cookware 
</P>
<P>
Introduced last fall is the Versailles line ($90 for an eight-piece set) in the 
prettiest, brightest cobalt blue. Each piece features "Ultrabase," an exclusive 
formulation from T-Fal that consists of three exterior layers: an outside 
porcelain enamel layer, a second thermic layer for heat distribution and a 
close contact layer for perfect contact on heat sources such as the newer 
ceramic cooktops. The interior features a nonstick surface that has improved 
resistance to scratches, abrasions and staining. 
</P>
<P>
Also available are the Durabase Royale Black ($70 for eight pieces), with 
high-tech black porcelain and reinforced bottom surfaces, and the premiere 
Signature collection ($80 for eight pieces). The latter is Euro-designed in 
handsome dove gray with white accent. Each T-Fal cookware set is available in 
colorful gift packaging. Open stock pieces are available and different series 
may also include a Dutch oven, chicken fryer, griddle, an oblong roaster or a 
wok. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Handmade Block Sets 
</P>
<P>
If you admire Corian countertops, you easily could fall for a Corian and Oak 
Knife Block Set ($519) from Kitchen Kitchen in Rancho Mirage. This beautiful 
block set includes a complete set of J. A. Henckels white Professional Series 
knives and sharpening steel plus a pair of Henckels shears. Phil Carter, owner 
of this desert specialty shop, designed the set and had them handmade by a 
Corian craftsman. He says: "The white-handled knives look out of place in an 
ordinary oak block, but absolutely come alive in the Corian block. The 
black-handled ones are also very attractive in it, especially when the kitchen 
has black appliances." After designing the block, Carter has gotten positive 
responses from decorators as well as from people who have the Corian tops in 
their kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
The block itself ($195) is usually available in Corian white with oak striping 
but can be specially ordered in a different Corian finish. For more information 
call (619) 568-0620. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seiko Instruments Kitchen Whiz will soon be available at Home Express, 
Arrowhead Business Machines, Buffum's, Federated, The Sharper Image and Long's 
Drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The T-Fal cookware sets are available at Robinson's and May Co and some 
specialty gourmet shops. 
</P>
<P>
 The Corian and Oak Knife Block Set is available at Kitchen Kitchen (Rancho 
Mirage).

HINTS FROM HELOISE: SOME SHORTCUTS TO EASY CLEANUP WHEN YOU'RE FLOURING A 
CHICKEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: One of my least favorite chores is trying to get a plate clean 
after using it when flouring chicken. After dipping the chicken in either milk 
or egg batter and then rubbing it in flour, the plate is a terrible mess. I 
scrub and scrub and eventually it comes clean. 
</P>
<P>
Now before I start cooking, I cover the plate with a piece of plastic wrap and 
then put the flour on it. This way I simply roll the flour and everything up 
and throw it away. This sure made my meal preparation much easier. 
</P>
<P>
 -- BETSY C., Anniston, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR BETSY: I use a paper plate and toss the whole mess away. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: When I have leftovers, I try to find clever ways of using them. 
My family hates the idea of eating leftovers, so when I succeed in disguising 
them they never even know, and mealtime is more pleasant for all of us. 
</P>
<P>
When I have a small amount of fruit left over, I add it to the batter of either 
pancakes or waffles, whichever I prepare for breakfast. Pancakes and waffles 
are now a favorite in this household. 
</P>
<P>
 -- GLORIA C. Phoenix, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I have some burned-on food on a stainless steel pot. Is there an 
easy method without scrubbing endlessly? I can't seem to find anything that 
works well. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A READER, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
DEAR READER: You are right, that burned-on food can be a devil to remove. The 
following method should only be used on stainless steel and not on aluminum 
cookware. 
</P>
<P>
Preheat the stainless steel pot until it is slightly warm and place it on a 
heavy brown paper bag to protect your counter. Generously spray the pot with 
some oven cleaner. Allow it to set for five to 10 minutes and then rinse off 
the pot. 
</P>
<P>
If the food has been on the pots for a long time or if it is a heavy 
concentration, it may take several applications and some scrubbing. Eventually 
most of the burned food will be removed. The pan should be washed after all the 
oven cleaner is rinsed off. Wash it well with hot soapy water and allow it to 
dry. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Here's a great tip on saving bottled salad oil from pouring out 
all over my vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
When I remove the cap from the bottle of oil, rather than removing the seal, I 
cut a slit in it. It pours out slowly so I can measure it, without spilling it 
everywhere. Sure saves on the calories, and no more soggy salad. 
</P>
<P>
 -- JOAN D., Oklahoma City, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: It seems I am forever dieting and when dieting it is important to 
drink eight to 10 glasses of water a day. This was always difficult for me. I 
mean, who actually likes to drink that much water? Certainly not me. 
</P>
<P>
So, to try to help I bought my very own special glass. It is very attractive 
and I use it all the time. Whenever it is empty, I refill it. It serves as a 
constant reminder of how great I'm going to look. 
</P>
<P>
 -- KAY S., Harrisburg, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR KAY: I use a beautiful crystal goblet. It does make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: How can I clean a solid copper kettle? I answered my door and 
when I returned, I found it black from being on the stove burner. 
</P>
<P>
 -- NINA, Metairie, La. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR NINA: Of course, you can use a good commercial cleaner or you could try 
our home-style remedy. Try pouring some white vinegar on a sponge along with a 
sprinkle of salt and rub the kettle. The black should come off. If the kettle 
is really black, you may need to do several applications. Good luck. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: This past summer I was invited to a picnic and was told to bring 
some soda pop. I stopped by a corner convenience store and bought four cold 
six-packs of soda to put in my two small coolers. 
</P>
<P>
When I saw the price of bags of ice, knowing the soda would be gulped down 
quickly when I got to the picnic, I bought four cans of frozen orange juice and 
put them in my coolers with the soda. The soda stayed cold until it was 
consumed. 
</P>
<P>
I took the cans of orange juice home, mixed them and drank it during the next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MIKE, Houston 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: For years I have hassled with the 13-gallon trash bags I put in 
my wastebasket. After emptying the trash, I always opened the new plastic bag 
and shook air into it, spread it at the bottom and hoped it covered the bottom 
and corners of the basket. 
</P>
<P>
Well, it didn't work. Almost every time I threw something in the new bag, the 
top part that I had carefully folded over the top edge would fall down inside 
the basket. 
</P>
<P>
I thought that a large rubber band (or an elastic cord that has a diameter 
about the size of a pencil) around the top of the basket would keep the bag in 
place. Since I didn't have either of those, I tried plain old clothespins. My 
wastebasket is round and I used three clothespins spaced around the top edge. 
They work well and do not interfere with me tossing trash in it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MARSHAL, Waco, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I am a short person and I found it hard to clean a chest freezer, 
but I finally discovered the trick to make it easy. After the freezer 
defrosted, I got a sponge mop and mopped up the bottom of the chest. The sponge 
takes up most of the water and is easy to wring out. No more bending over the 
side to reach the bottom, no more wet hands and no more backaches. 
</P>
<P>
 -- ELAINE, Northfield, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: My family loves frozen waffles. However, it seems that when I 
would get them to the table they would be cold. 
</P>
<P>
So, to alleviate this problem I now heat the syrup. I place the syrup in a pan 
of hot water for about 10 minutes. Now when the waffles are on the table we 
pour the hot syrup over them. 
</P>
<P>
It is delicious. 
</P>
<P>
 -- NANCY, San Diego 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: My family loves mushrooms. How can I get them sliced so the 
slices will be uniform? They look so much more appetizing when they are neatly 
cut and I know there has to be an easy way to do this. 
</P>
<P>
 -- PEGGY, Boise, Ida. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR PEGGY: You are right! There is a simple and easy method to slice them -- 
use an egg slicer! The slices come out evenly in just the flick of your wrist. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I remember reading in your column some time back several 
different uses for chopsticks. 
</P>
<P>
At that time I thought they were good ideas and now I can't seem to locate the 
clipping. Would you please reprint this information for me. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A READER, Orangeburg, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR READER: Chopsticks are quite handy to have in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
They are especially good for mixing eggs. They are also handy when mixing 
orange juice. You can "chop" at the frozen clump and it breaks apart much 
easier. 
</P>
<P>
I also find them helpful when measuring out ingredients. They are great for 
leveling off just about anything. 
</P>
<P>
One favorite is to use one to break up clumps of dirt in the ivy sitting in the 
kitchen window. 
</P>

DISEASES OF DIETARY EXCESS; 
</P>
<P>
AMERICANS EATING THEMSELVES TO DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLLEEN PIERRE, The Baltimore Sun Pierre is a registered dietitian 
specializing in sports nutrition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. surgeon general's report on nutrition and health, released several 
months ago, offered some good and some bad news. 
</P>
<P>
Our abundant food supply has virtually eliminated such deficiency diseases as 
rickets, scurvy, pellagra, beriberi, xerophthalmia and goiter. 
</P>
<P>
But we are eating ourselves to death. 
</P>
<P>
Diseases of dietary excess and imbalance now rank among the leading causes of 
illness and death in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Diet plays a part in five of our top 10 causes of death -- coronary heart 
disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis. In addition, 
diet also may contribute to other problems such as high blood pressure, 
obesity, dental disease, osteoporosis and gastrointestinal disorders such as 
diverticular disease. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the end costs of diet-related diseases were detailed in the surgeon 
general's report, along with recommendations for prevention. These included: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Line of Intervention 
</P>
<P>
Coronary heart disease. More than 1.25 million heart attacks occur each year, 
and more than 500,000 people die as a result. In 1985, illnesses and deaths 
from coronary heart disease cost Americans an estimated $49 billion in direct 
health care expenditures and lost productivity. 
</P>
<P>
The report's recommendation: "For individuals whose high total and LDL 
cholesterol levels warrant treatment, the first line of intervention is diet 
therapy." 
</P>
<P>
High blood pressure, or hypertension. This is a major risk factor for both 
heart disease and stroke. Almost 58 million people in the United States have 
hypertension, including 39 million younger than 65. About 50,000 Americans a 
year suffer a stroke, resulting in nearly 150,000 deaths in 1987 and long-term 
disability for many others. About 2 million living Americans suffer from 
stroke-related disabilities, at an estimated annual cost of more than $11 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Recommendation: People need to be informed of the likely benefit of dietary 
practices such as achieving and maintaining desirable body weight, moderating 
sodium and alcohol intake and moderating fat, especially saturated fat. 
</P>
<P>
Cancer. The costs of cancer for 1985 have been estimated to be $22 billion for 
direct health care costs, $9 billion in lost productivity due to treatment or 
disability and $41 billion in lost productivity due to premature death. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reduce Elevated Risk 
</P>
<P>
Recommendation: People at high risk for diet-related cancers because of family 
history, obesity or excessive alcohol intake should receive counseling from 
qualified health professionals to design approaches that could reduce their 
elevated risk for cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Diabetes. In 1985, diabetes was estimated to cost $13.8 billion a year. In 
addition to the nearly 38,000 deaths attributed directly to diabetes, 95,000 
deaths a year result from cardiac and kidney complications. 
</P>
<P>
Recommendation: Again, more information and counseling on diet. 
</P>
<P>
And the list goes on. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, we all just took eating for granted. But with escalating health 
care costs, we need to take another look at the food choices we make every day. 
</P>
<P>
Choosing an extra baked potato instead of a second serving of meat could be one 
step toward saving yourself the cost of bypass surgery.

A REASON TO AVOID NICOTINE CHEWING GUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I've been using nicotine chewing gum in a program to get me to stop 
smoking. Can I continue to use it if I become pregnant? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Nicotine chewing gum should not be used during a pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I've been making a point of using skim milk and cottage cheese instead of 
whole milk and solid cheeses because I was told that I would get less fat in my 
diet that way. But I'd like to know what low-fat really means. If I don't use 
skim milk and cottage cheese, how much fat do these other dairy products have 
in them? Does it really make a difference? 
</P>
<P>
A: Butter is about 100% fat, and many cheeses are at least 70% fat. As for 
whole milk, one-half of its calories come from fat. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My sister-in-law has cancer, and she's been accepted for a clinical trial. I 
know that it involves some form of treatment, but I'm not sure what a clinical 
trial actually is. Are there any risks to it? I would appreciate an 
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
A: Clinical trials usually are designed to evaluate a new form of treatment. 
New treatments may appear to be safe and effective when tested in the 
laboratory, but no one can be certain of this until it is used on humans. The 
clinical trial helps determine this. 
</P>
<P>
All treatments, both new and old, involve both risks and benefits; with a new 
treatment, however, there may be risks that could not have been foreseen. On 
the other hand, a clinical trial can provide patients with the finest in 
available medical care and with a form of treatment that may be superior to 
anything else they had been receiving.

As a counterpoint to Wednesday night's Oscar glitter, the Golden Raspberry 
Awards Foundation presented its dubious honors for the worst film achievements 
of the year. Sylvester Stallone was named worst actor for "Rambo III," his 
third razz in five years. (He also "won" in 1985 for "Rhinestone" and in 1986 
for "Rambo: First Blood Part II" and "Rocky IV.") Tom Cruise's "Cocktail" was 
selected worst picture for 1988. Others getting Razzies included Liza Minnelli 
for worst actress ("Arthur 2: On the Rocks" and "Rent-a-Cop"), Dan Aykroyd for 
worst supporting actor ("Caddyshack II") and Kristy McNichol for worst 
supporting actress ("Two-Moon Junction"). The Razzies are voted on by about 200 
publicists. ALEENE MacMINN

The U.S. Information Agency has decided not to appeal a pivotal court ruling 
that found the agency violated constitutional guarantees of free speech by 
denying export certificates to a group of documentary films that espoused 
liberal views opposed by the Reagan administration. The much-publicized 1986 
case pitted seven film makers, whose on-screen topics range from Nicaragua 
under the Sandinistas to the perils of nuclear energy, against the USIA and its 
former director, Charles Z. Wick. The agency refused to certify the films for 
export, and the film makers charged that the agency was attempting to censor 
the films' contents. The agency's criteria for determining suitability for 
export certification were challenged in Los Angeles federal court and found 
unconstitutional. That ruling was appealed and upheld in higher courts. The 
agency this week chose not to take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. (A 
related legal matter over a second set of USIA guidelines is still pending, 
however.) ALEENE MacMINN

Film director Steven Spielberg, whose megahits include "E.T. The 
Extra-Terrestrial," has donated $5 million to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center's 
pediatric program for research of childhood diseases, including cancer and 
genetic, infectious, blood, kidney and heart diseases. In response to the gift, 
the hospital's board of directors has decided to rename a three-story building 
that houses some of the center's pediatric research projects the Steven

HOLLOWAY/SHELDON TEAM AT GRAND AVENUE BAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Going to hear a quintet fronted by saxophonist Red Holloway and trumpeter Jack 
Sheldon is a little like settling down to watch a rerun of a favorite 
television show, or reading for the umpteenth time a favorite novel or poem. 
While you might be a bit fuzzy on the details, you know the gist of the whole 
thing and are eager to be impressed again by the quality. 
</P>
<P>
At the Biltmore Hotel's Grand Avenue Bar on Tuesday evening, Holloway and 
Sheldon -- two familiar hands on the jazz scene -- offered nothing startling 
over the course of two sets, but impressed nonetheless with the quality of 
their art. 
</P>
<P>
Holloway, an energetic saxophonist mired happily in the mainstream, is beyond 
having to display the screeching high end of his instrument's range -- or its 
belching bottom -- to impress. Rather, he stays firmly within the natural range 
and allows his ideas to gush forth with a mature musicality. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon, his partner in this venture, was likewise able to impress with 
bell-clear notes that rang true as he explored the vagaries of the written song 
and delivered a seemingly non-stop series of improvised gems. 
</P>
<P>
"Green Dolphin Street" is a song so overplayed that it belongs in permanent 
cold storage. But this group, spurred by drummer Paul Humphrey and anchored by 
bassist Richard Reid, found new life. New life was also found in the familiar 
"Don't Get Around Much Any More" and "Just Friends," two tunes that featured 
Sheldon's musky, yet effective vocals. Again, working from the time-honored 
tradition of improvisation, the quintet was able to make each of the songs 
bright and fresh. 
</P>
<P>
Though a bawdy little blues from Holloway and a rollicking rendition of Charlie 
Parker's "Billie's Bounce" were highlights, it was the ballad inclusions that 
were particularly special. Holloway's readings of "You Don't Know What Love Is" 
and "Here's That Rainy Day" were simply beautiful, with Sheldon accenting his 
co-leader's ideas with sensitivity and style. Pianist Dwight Dickerson was 
accomplished in both accompanying and soloing roles. 
</P>
<P>
For those who appreciate old wine in new bottles, the Holloway/Sheldon Quintet 
is a worthy find.A. JAMES LISKA

GEORGE O 'KEEFFE SHOW OPENS AT COUNTY ART MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>

Bleached cattle bones bake in the white-hot sun, lush poppies unfurl rich red 
petals, vivid abstractions reek with erotic overtones: Georgia O'Keeffe's art 
has come to town. 
</P>
<P>
Winding up a blockbuster five-city tour, "Georgia O'Keeffe: 1887-1986" opens 
today at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Critical assessments of the 
exhibit have varied, but museum officials who have hosted the revered American 
modernist's show, already seen by more than 1.3 million people, call it 
immensely popular. In Dallas, it broke attendance records. 
</P>
<P>
Organized in late 1987 by Washington's National Gallery of Art, the exhibit 
traveled from there to the Art Institute of Chicago, then to the Dallas Museum 
of Art, and was initially scheduled to conclude this February at New York's 
Metropolitan Museum of Art. Lenders weren't keen on loaning their works for too 
long. But big crowds and a little persuasion apparently paid off. 
</P>
<P>
"We were able to convince the National Gallery, (exhibit funder) Southwestern 
Bell Foundation, lenders, and the O'Keeffe estate that a West Coast venue would 
be not just desirable but essential," said Earl A. Powell, County Museum of Art 
director. The artist's estate loaned about one-third of 101 paintings and 
drawings on view through June 18. 
</P>
<P>
O'Keeffe, whose giant, sensuous flowers and transcendent Southwestern desert 
landscapes made her one of America's best-known and best-loved artists years 
before she died in 1986 at age 98, seems likely to cause long lines to form on 
Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Already about 45,000 tickets have been sold for the artist's first extensive 
posthumous exhibit, and the County Museum's membership, which has totaled about 
81,000 since 1984, leaped to 84,000 after an enrollment campaign keyed to the 
show offered new members two free tickets, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Chiefly for conservation reasons, the local exhibit contains about 20 fewer 
pieces than the traveling version, but it is essentially the same show, Powell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Keeffe, who wed photographer Alfred Stieglitz, left for months at a time the 
man she deeply loved to paint in the New Mexican desert, and has projected a 
pervasive, though perhaps not entirely accurate, persona of staunch 
independence and reclusion. 
</P>
<P>
But it had been nearly two decades since her last major retrospective and, 
while everybody knew about O'Keeffe the person, "a whole generation was 
unfamiliar with O'Keeffe the painter," said co-curator Juan Hamilton, 
representative of the O'Keeffe estate and a ceramic sculptor who cared for the 
artist during the last 13 years of her life. (In a much-publicized controversy, 
Hamilton's share of O'Keeffe's $79-million estate was recently reduced from 70% 
to 10% after relatives challenged her will.) 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit, not a definitive retrospective but a selective, chronological 
survey, strives to remedy this ignorance about the artist, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the artist's iconic desert and flower images, there are 
O'Keeffe's early charcoal drawings -- the works that led to her professional 
discovery by Stieglitz, then a leading New York avant-garde art dealer -- 
brilliantly colored-abstractions, views of New York and huge cloud paintings 
she made in her 70s. 
</P>
<P>
But the show may also shine new light on O'Keeffe's personality with a 
catalogue that presents some of her previously unpublished letters. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, people are able to hear her speaking directly," said 
National Gallery researcher Sarah Greenough, who edited the letters. "I think a 
very different side of O'Keeffe emerges." 
</P>
<P>
A correspondence from 1922 reveals that the artist loathed critics' 
interpretations of her work as "shameless" or "throbbing" symbols of female 
sexual anatomy, Greenough said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for "Georgia O'Keeffe" are on sale at all Ticketron locations and at 
the County Museum of Art. Information: (213) 857-6110.

STAGE WATCH : QUESTIONS CONTINUE OVER TAPER'S 'SANSEI'; 'STAND-UP' LATEST 
CONTENDER FOR MAIN STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>

<P>
Examine the credits for "Sansei" at the Mark Taper Forum. 
</P>
<P>
It was "created and performed by" Hiroshima, the band that is its subject. It 
was "developed and directed by" Robert Egan. The dramaturg was Brian Kulick. 
</P>
<P>
But no one wrote it. 
</P>
<P>
"Sansei" was drawn from taped reminiscences by four members of Hiroshima. The 
raw material was edited into a script, a collaboration between the members of 
the band and Egan. 
</P>
<P>
As the first Asian-American project to appear in a Mark Taper Forum mainstage 
season, "Sansei" is the subject of much comment among the Asian-American 
theatrical community. One question that has arisen: Why wasn't a writer hired 
to tie together the band members' stories into a real play? 
</P>
<P>
"It was entertaining, but there could have been much more meat to it, more 
insight, more of a structure," said actress and former television producer/host 
Sumi Haru. Rattling off a list of seven Asian-American writers, she said, "They 
know how to put a play together. I wonder if they were asked." 
</P>
<P>
" 'Sansei' is not a play; it's more of a concert piece," said Mako, former 
director of East-West Players. "Each member of the band had something to say, 
but it was told as opposed to shown. It lacked conflict." The Taper "deserves a 
little pat on the back for doing something" about Asian-Americans, he added, 
"but I wish it had been a lot stronger, more pertinent. The language wasn't 
heightened. Obviously they (the members of Hiroshima) are not playwrights." 
</P>
<P>
Jude Narita, whose "Coming Into Passion/Song for a Sansei" won a best play 
award Monday from the Assn. of Asian/Pacific American Artists, acknowledged 
that she "was quite moved to see Asians on stage (in 'Sansei'). It was a 
wonderful concert." She appreciated that the Taper supported "Sansei" "to the 
point of putting it into the big house" (main stage). 
</P>
<P>
However, Narita pointed to the contrast between the "crafted" quality of 
Hiroshima's music and "the casualness of the language" in "Sansei." "Writing 
for the theater is as demanding as writing a song and deserves as much 
respect," she continued. "You have to give up your commitment to the actual 
spoken word (from the taped interviews) and springboard off the thoughts. By 
remaining so true to the exact words, they missed the universal." 
</P>
<P>
" 'Sansei' is an entertaining and energetic endeavor," wrote critic John Saito 
Jr. in the Japanese-English newspaper Rafu Shimpo. But he didn't find enough 
"fiber in the plot." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone missed the presence of a writer. "I don't see how a writer could 
have been more sensitive, more aware," said Dolores Wong, president of Asian 
American Friends of Center Theatre Group, which raised approximately $50,000 
for "Sansei" at a benefit. She admitted "a certain amount of anxiety selling 
tickets for a performance for which we hadn't even seen a script." But she's 
now "very proud" of "Sansei," calling it "very honest, fair, authentic." 
</P>
<P>
Taper artistic director/producer Gordon Davidson said the decision not to use a 
writer was the band's -- and he respected it. "When we decided it would be 
their story (an earlier idea was for Hiroshima to provide music for another 
story), they wanted to tell it in their own words. It was a delicate 
experience. I knew it would yield certain results and certain problems. Clearly 
it lacks a writer's ability to take that material and transform it. But what 
I've got in return is a certain honesty and simplicity." 
</P>
<P>
Davidson added that "we weren't making a play. We were making something new." 
However, he also said, "the logical next step would be to take that material 
and see whether one could marry it with a writer. We'll play it, listen to it 
and talk about how we can turn the documentary material into a more artful form 
without losing the honesty." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether this process should have been completed before putting "Sansei" 
on the main stage, Davidson replied: "I've got to be able to experiment on the 
main stage. There's no way to do new work if you look at it as finished. Almost 
all the work you do in theater is work in process." Besides, he added, a 
smaller stage hardly could have accommodated the band with all of its 
instruments and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Hiroshima leader Dan Kuramoto agreed that "if there is another life for 
'Sansei,' we may consider (hiring a writer) then." And he recalled that at one 
point in the development of the play, director Egan had furnished "a list of 
writers, if we wanted to do that." 
</P>
<P>
But "the veracity of the show had a raw appeal that (Egan) liked," added 
Kuramoto. At Egan's suggestion, Kuramoto read some of Studs Terkel's oral 
histories and used them as an inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
Kuramoto himself has written plays. He studied the craft at San Francisco 
State, he said, and a Bay Area company wanted to perform one of his plays when 
he was only 18 years old. But he withdrew it, fearing that it wasn't ready yet. 
</P>
<P>
Now 41, he's no longer willing to wait for perfection. "In theater, everyone 
waits until it's too late," he said. "It's important to do it while the issues 
are still boiling." Also, given the band's touring schedule, "we don't know 
when we'll have another chance to do it." 
</P>
<P>
He conceded that "a lot of refining needs to go into it. But I don't know of 
any piece that couldn't stand a bit of touching up. I've seen many shows and 
wondered what they were doing in front of a paying audience." 
</P>
<P>
For Kuramoto, "how successful it is isn't as important as the fact that we're 
moving in a direction that includes (Asian-Americans) above the Equity Waiver 
level. Success is doing what you believe in. Hopefully there will be much 
better pieces than ours, but we have to start somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Veteran actor Sab Shimono agreed: "It could have been better, but at least it's 
there. I hope the Taper will bring in Asian writers soon, but at least they 
used Asian actors. They could have used Joel Grey to play Dan Kuramoto." 
</P>
<P>
LATE CUES: Some Taper main stage offerings do ascend from the lower rungs of 
the Taper ladder. The latest candidate for such a move is "Stand-Up Tragedy," 
now playing the Taper Too and originally developed at the Taper Lab last fall. 
Negotiations are under way to take it to the main stage, said a Taper 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Steven Banks is taking his "Home Entertainment Center" from the 
Pasadena Playhouse's Balcony Theatre to the Canon Theatre in Beverly Hills for 
an April 13 opening. Susan Dietz, the Playhouse's artistic director, is 
producing the venture (without Playhouse participation). 
</P>
<P>
"The Unsinkable Molly Brown" is so unsinkable that it established a Long Beach 
Civic Light Opera record for gross sales ($683,000 and counting) 45 days before 
its opening on May 6. . . . "At Wit's End " has extended its run at the Coronet 
through April 30. "Les Miserables" has added three more weeks; it will now play 
through July 23. 
</P>
<P>
Bring a non-perishable food or household item to the Doolittle Theatre box 
office and you'll get two tickets for the price of one for the Saturday 8 p.m. 
preview of Tom Stoppard's "Hapgood." All items will be donated to the 
"Necessities of Life" program of AIDS Project Los Angeles. . . . George 
Schaefer and Martin Tahse have organized a memorial gathering honoring actor 
Maurice Evans, who died March 12. It's at 4:30 p.m. Sunday at the Globe 
Playhouse, 1107 N. Kings Road.

ALICIA DE LARROCHA IN RECITAL AT ROYCE HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alicia de Larrocha's latest recital program was a curious, but utterly 
characteristic, thing of clear contrasts and an understated progression from 
comparative abstraction to full-bodied pictorialism. Tuesday evening at Royce 
Hall, she paired Schubert with an Iberian group; her previous recital here this 
season had matched Mendelssohn and Albeniz. 
</P>
<P>
In the overheated hall, the 65-year-old pianist began slowly, with a detached, 
ill-balanced account of Schubert's C-minor Impromptu, D. 899, No. 1. She 
communicated a much greater degree of involvement in a fleet performance of the 
A-flat Impromptu, No. 4, in the same set. 
</P>
<P>
The Sonata in A, D. 664, elicited a fully engaged performance. Larrocha allowed 
the sentiment and lyricism gracious space, while keeping formal shapes taut, in 
direct, evenly modulated playing. 
</P>
<P>
After intermission, Larrocha switched from pastels to primary colors in oil for 
a set culminating in Turina's "Sanlucar de Barrameda," appropriately subtitled 
"Sonata Pintoresca." Her boldly etched, expressive playing clarified textures 
and thematic links as well as painted moods with idiomatic flair. 
</P>
<P>
Larrocha's complete control of rhythmic and articulative nuance, and her 
formidable sense of concentrated direction, well served the "Tres Danzas 
Caracteristicas" of Oscar Espla. She unwound the Habanera with sinuous ease, 
let the Ronda Serrana glitter naturally, and drove the Sonatina Playera with 
indomitable zest. 
</P>
<P>
The "Sonatina pour Ivette" by Xavier Montsalvatge is at once austere and 
playful, aristocratically ordered and vividly earthy. Larrocha set it forth 
with clarity and brio, alert to inner tensions as well as surface sparkle. 
</P>
<P>
In encore, Larrocha furthered the cause of sophisticated Iberiana with a 
tenderly introverted account of Mompou's "El Secreto," and an intensely vital 
performance of Falla's "Dance of Terror" from "El Amor Brujo," delivered as a 
single fiery impulse. JOHN HENKEN

TESTS SHOW ALAR TRACES ON APPLES IN 2 COUNTY STORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Apples in two Los Angeles County supermarkets were found in independent tests 
to contain residues of Alar, a potentially hazardous chemical that the stores' 
suppliers had claimed was no longer used. 
</P>
<P>
The tests, conducted for The Times by a private San Francisco laboratory, found 
traces of Alar on apples sold at a Hughes market in Monterey Park and a Lucky 
store in Bell. Officers of both stores said their growers had pledged in 
letters not to use the chemical. Lucky was apparently confident enough of the 
claim to post it on signs on produce shelves. 
</P>
<P>
The test results demonstrate that supermarkets, increasingly sensitive to 
consumer concerns about pesticides and chemicals, may not be able to guarantee 
the purity of their produce without independent laboratory verification. Some 
environmentalists are demanding an immediate ban on Alar. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the results, a spokeswoman for Lucky said the chain pulled the 
apples from the market where The Times purchased them last week and will test 
them to verify The Times' findings. In the meantime, she said, Lucky's no-Alar 
signs will probably be revised. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes, concerned by the findings, began testing apples in its warehouse 
Wednesday and found Alar residues on three different brands of red apples. A 
Hughes vice president ordered its stores to pull those brands from the shelves 
late Wednesday afternoon and announced that the chain will now test apples in 
its warehouse on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
No Alar residue was detected in samples from two other stores, a Vons in La 
Canada and a Ralphs in South Pasadena. These two supermarket chains verify 
their growers' claims of Alar-free fruit with independent laboratory testing. 
</P>
<P>
The amounts detected in The Times' tests were substantially below the allowable 
limit set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. An EPA official said 
Alar residues at or below the allowable amount -- set before the chemical was 
linked to cancer -- could cause health problems over a lifetime of consumption 
but not in the short run. The agency next year is expected to ban the chemical, 
which is used to improve the appearance and extend the shelf life mainly of red 
apples. 
</P>
<P>
"The finding of Alar in so-called Alar-free apples demonstrates why we need the 
EPA to take this chemical off the market once and for all," said Lawrie Mott, a 
senior scientist for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental 
group that released a controversial study earlier this month about the 
chemical's effects on children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Private Lab Hired 
</P>
<P>
The Times last week purchased eight to 10 apples of each red and yellow variety 
at the four stores and hired Anresco Inc., a private San Francisco laboratory, 
to test them for residues of Alar, the trade name for the chemical daminozide. 
The laboratory used a testing method recognized by the EPA and the Food and 
Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Of 23 samples tested, five had detectable levels. The EPA's allowable limit for 
the residue is 20 parts per million. The EPA does not, however, say that apples 
containing that amount or less are safe. 
</P>
<P>
"We aren't saying there is any level that is absolutely without risk," said EPA 
spokesman Alber Heier. "However, we think the risk is small." 
</P>
<P>
Agency officials say the average Alar residue detected on apples is one part 
per million -- 1/20th of the limit. For every 100,000 people who eat apples 
containing that average amount, there will be about 4.5 additional cancer cases 
over the lifetime of those people, according to the EPA's calculations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Range of Findings 
</P>
<P>
The amounts found in The Times' tests ranged from .97 ppm to 9 ppm. Anne 
Lindsay, director of pesticide registration for the EPA, said any residue above 
1 ppm probably results from current use of Alar. Smaller amounts may be found 
on apples one or more years after the grower has stopped using the chemical 
because it persists in the soil and root system of the tree. 
</P>
<P>
At Hughes, a sample of McIntoshes was found to have residue of 9 ppm. A sample 
of large red Delicious apples had a detectable level of .97 ppm and "fancy" red 
Delicious had a level of 3.7 ppm. 
</P>
<P>
At Lucky, a large red Delicious sample showed 1.8 ppm and a regular red 
Delicious sample had 4.1 ppm. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Decker, a spokeswoman for Lucky Stores, said the chain will decide whether 
to make changes in its produce policies after receiving the results of its own 
laboratory analysis. She noted that Lucky produce signs say the chain has been 
asking growers for three years to certify that they do not use Alar. 
</P>
<P>
"The sign is still correct as far as I am concerned," Decker said. "The grower 
has certified to us that he has not used Alar." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Variance of Claims 
</P>
<P>
But claims of certification vary, said Tom Hale, president of the Washington 
Apple Commission, which represents 5,000 apple growers in the state. Some 
growers certify that no Alar was used to the best of their knowledge. Others 
certify that actual testing was done at harvest time. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the certifications that are occurring are honest," Hale said. "But 
I'm not saying it's foolproof and something couldn't slip through." 
</P>
<P>
Harland Polk, vice president of sales and marketing at Hughes, acknowledged 
that levels of certification from growers vary. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes will now post signs in stores informing customers that samples of their 
apple shipments are tested for the chemical, Polk said. Of seven apple samples 
tested by the store Wednesday, four had no traces of Alar. But some red 
Delicious apples had 1.2 ppm; others had 2.5 ppm and still others showed 3.6 
ppm, Polk said. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes used the same method of testing as Anresco, but the apples tested by 
Hughes may have come from different growers. 
</P>
<P>
Polk said Hughes had letters from each of those suppliers saying that Alar was 
not used on their apples to the best of their knowledge. "Those (apples) will 
be pulled from sale and returned to the supplier, and if it is appropriate we 
will take legal action against those suppliers," Polk said. 
</P>
<P>
Stores say that once apples are on the shelves, it is difficult to determine 
who the growers were. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA estimates that 5% of fresh apples are now treated with Alar. Lindsay, 
director of the agency's pesticide registration division, said that estimate is 
based on reports from county and state agricultural officials who work with 
growers, the amount of Alar production reported by its manufacturer and private 
services that collect such information. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay conceded, however, that the agency must rely in part on what growers 
say they are doing because "there is no official national reporting system of 
what people use." 
</P>
<P>
Consumers Union, the New York-based publisher of Consumer Reports, challenged 
that estimate in a report showing that 55% of raw apples purchased in the New 
York region contained Alar. The organization's test showed residues ranging 
from .4 to 2.3 ppm on 11 of 20 samples of red apples tested. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer Union called on the EPA to ban Alar "as soon as possible." In the 
meantime, consumers should not stop eating raw apples "because the health 
benefits of apples outweigh the very low risks" associated with Alar, said 
Consumers Union spokeswoman Marnie Goodman.

TESTING FOR ALAR 
</P>
<P>
 Apples from four stores -- Vons, Ralphs, Hughes and Lucky -- were tested for 
daminozide, a growth-regulator marketed under the brand name Alar, which is 
suspected of causing cancer. Twenty-three samples of eight to 10 apples each 
were tested. No Alar was found in the Vons or Ralphs samples. Five samples -- 
three from Hughes and two from Lucky -- showed traces of the chemical. The 
legal limit for Alar on apples is 20 parts per million. Anresco Inc., a San 
Francisco firm, did the testing for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The laboratory, established in 1943, tests for pesticides, preservatives, 
nutrients and other compounds in food, usually for private companies. The 
laboratory used the government-approved PAM II testing method in which apples 
are put in a blender, mixed with sodium hydroxide, titanium trichloride, an 
antifoam agent and zinc granules. The mixture is heated and decomposed into 
unsymmetrical dymethyl hydrazine (UDMH), a breakdown product of Alar. Results 
are read in a spectrometer, with color intensities proportional to the amount 
of Alar in the sample. The test has a margin of error of plus or minus 4%.

'JUNK BOND' KING MILKEN INDICTED FOR STOCK FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Milken, the Drexel Burnham Lambert "junk bond" wizard in Beverly Hills 
who revolutionized U.S. corporate finance and raised funds for dozens of 
corporate raids, was indicted Wednesday on federal racketeering, insider 
trading and other securities fraud counts. 
</P>
<P>
The long-expected indictment also named Milken's brother, Lowell Milken, and a 
former Drexel trader, Bruce L. Newberg. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted on the racketeering charges, the three could face an astronomical 
amount in financial penalties: The indictment asks that they forfeit a total of 
$1.85 billion, representing their salaries, other compensation and their share 
of Drexel profits, all earned in what the government charges was a continuing 
criminal enterprise operated at the New York-based investment banking firm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fines Could Be Doubled 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the federal racketeering law, known as the Racketeer Influenced 
and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, at least theoretically could subject 
them to twice that amount in fines. This means each defendant could face up to 
$3.7 billion in fines on the two RICO charges. They also face additional fines 
on the other counts totaling in the millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Milken faces a maximum jail sentence of about 300 years, with lesser 
amounts for the other two defendants. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment apparently marks the end of Milken's 20-year career at the firm 
that his junk bond operation transformed from a second-rank investment bank to 
one of the powerhouses on Wall Street. Junk bonds are high-risk, high-yield 
debt securities. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the 98-count indictment was returned by a federal grand jury, 
Drexel said that Milken, 42, and his brother, 40, had requested and been 
granted leaves of absence. John Kissick, formerly head of the firm's corporate 
finance department in Beverly Hills, has been expected to take Michael Milken's 
place. 
</P>
<P>
The criminal charges result from the biggest criminal securities fraud 
investigation ever undertaken by the government. The inquiry has been under way 
for over two years. Benito Romano, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said "this 
specific investigation is continuing" and didn't rule out the possibility that 
additional individuals may be charged soon. 
</P>
<P>
The charges filed Wednesday mean that Newberg is now facing two separate 
racketeering indictments. He is also named as a defendant in an indictment 
returned last July relating to Princeton/Newport Partners, a small investment 
firm that did business with Drexel. The charges against him in the two 
indictments appear to cover the same general chain of events. 
</P>
<P>
Lowell Milken, a lawyer, gave up a promising legal career in the 1970s to help 
his brother run Drexel's Beverly Hills office. The indictment charges that 
Lowell "was his brother's principal adviser in the conduct of the conspiracy." 
</P>
<P>
Sources at the firm said the indictment of Michael Milken probably would clear 
the way for Drexel to swiftly settle civil charges filed by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. Milken's continued presence at the firm was a major 
sticking point in the talks. 
</P>
<P>
Settlement with the SEC, in turn, would remove the last obstacle to Drexel's 
carrying out its pledge to plead guilty to six criminal counts and pay $650 
million in financial penalties. The firm had entered into that agreement in 
December, in part to avoid more serious racketeering charges and a possible 
huge forfeiture of assets. 
</P>
<P>
The 110-page indictment returned Wednesday appears to closely follow the civil 
charges contained in an SEC lawsuit filed in September against Drexel and the 
Milkens. It contains only a few charges that weren't in the SEC's complaint and 
leaves out a number that were. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment accuses Michael Milken of a prolonged pattern of insider 
trading, stock market manipulation and defrauding clients. It claims that he 
sought to enrich himself through self-dealing at the same time that he was 
acting on behalf of Drexel's customers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Areas of Wrongdoing 
</P>
<P>
The indictment charges three broad areas of wrongdoing. One involves 
transactions with former stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky, who pleaded guilty to 
a single criminal charge and gave prosecutors the information that touched off 
the Drexel investigation. The indictment charges that Milken used Boesky's firm 
to hide illegal stock trading. 
</P>
<P>
The second broad area involves transactions with Princeton/Newport Partners, in 
which Drexel and Milken allegedly helped Princeton/Newport carry out tax fraud 
through sham securities trades with Drexel. Among other charges, the indictment 
alleges that Drexel used Princeton/Newport to illegally manipulate the price of 
COMB Co. securities in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The third general area involves alleged straight insider trading in the 
securities of Lorimar Inc. and Viacom Inc. by Michael Milken. 
</P>
<P>
Although the government could immediately ask a federal judge to freeze the 
three defendants' personal assets, Romano, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said 
he probably will not do that. He said his office has been negotiating with the 
defendants' lawyers and added that he expects a bond to be posted by the three 
men, covering at least a part of the amount they may be required to forfeit to 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expects Assurances 
</P>
<P>
Romano said he expects to receive written assurances that assets covering the 
rest will not be dissipated before a trial is held. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the huge amounts, among the largest that individuals have been 
asked to forfeit in a RICO case, Romano said the numbers represented "the 
extraordinary levels of compensation and stock ownership in the (illegal) 
Drexel enterprise" paid to Michael Milken and the others. The indictment notes 
that Milken received $1.1 billion in direct compensation from Drexel from 1984 
through 1987, as well as millions in other forms of compensation, and that he 
is Drexel's largest individual stockholder, owning about 6% of the firm. 
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, Milken's pay was $123.8 million in 1984 and $135 
million in 1985, then more than doubled in 1986 to $294.8 million. In 1987, he 
was paid $550 million. The indictment says that, during those years, Milken's 
personal compensation amounted to between 28% and 44% of the junk bond 
department's gross revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Lowell Milken allegedly received $102 million in direct compensation during the 
same period. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel's tentative settlement of the six criminal charges pending against the 
firm calls for it to withhold nearly all of Michael Milken's compensation from 
1988, as well as about $13 million owed to Lowell Milken. But the brothers are 
challenging that in court as a violation of their constitutional rights, and it 
will be up to a federal judge to decide. 
</P>
<P>
The $1.85-billion total that the three are being asked to forfeit was based in 
part on calculations of how much each of them had received from Drexel. But 
Romano said that, under the law, each of them could be held "jointly and 
separately" liable for the full amount. Michael Milken has been reported to 
have a personal net worth of nearly $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur L. Liman, one of Milken's main defense lawyers, said in a written 
statement that Milken "will plead not guilty with confidence that in a fair 
trial he will be acquitted." Liman said: "The charges against Mr. Milken are 
essentially a repetition of the accusations made by Ivan Boesky and others as 
they bargained for leniency or immunity from prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
Both Milkens strongly denied the charges against them. Michael Milken said in a 
written press release: "I am confident that in the end I will be vindicated." 
Lowell Milken said that "the proof will show that I had virtually no contacts 
with Ivan Boesky, and that I had little, if anything, to do with the events the 
prosecutors misrepresent in order to construct their charges." 
</P>
<P>
He added that "I have been thrown into this indictment because of a fact in 
which I take great pride -- I am Michael Milken's brother." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Armstrong, Lowell's lawyer, said in a brief interview that he found 
little that was unexpected in the indictment. "It seems like little more than a 
rehash of what the SEC came out with six months ago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In another statement, two lawyers representing Newberg accused the government 
of seeking to punish Newberg for refusing to become a prosecution witness by 
indicting him twice on racketeering charges. 
</P>
<P>
"The second RICO indictment of Mr. Newberg, containing essentially the same 
charges as those in the first indictment, is a total perversion of the RICO 
statute," the lawyers said. Newberg could not be reached for comment. He left 
Drexel when it became apparent that he was going to be charged in the 
Princeton/Newport case. 
</P>
<P>
Romano said that none of the three would be arrested. Instead, they will be 
allowed to present themselves for arraignment, probably one week from today. 
The government requested that U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood be assigned to 
the case, because she is already presiding over the case in which Drexel is 
expected to plead guilty to six charges. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment conspicuously leaves out a number of names of Drexel employees 
who reportedly have been under investigation. Several of them had received 
"target" letters from prosecutors warning them that they faced indictment. 
Defense lawyers said they believe that the government may file additional 
indictments, or file a new indictment, superseding the one handed up Wednesday, 
that would include more individuals as defendants.

DEFENSE PROBE FIGURE LIKELY TO PLEAD GUILTY

<P>
Woodland Hills, Calif., defense consultant Fred H. Lackner will plead guilty 
Friday to federal fraud and bribery charges in the Ill Wind Pentagon corruption 
investigation, sources told The Times Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In an agreement almost identical to that struck last week between prosecutors 
and former Navy procurement official Stuart E. Berlin, Lackner will plead 
guilty in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Va., to charges of wire fraud, 
conspiracy and bribery of a public official. 
</P>
<P>
He faces a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison and fines of $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
Lackner, 52, will admit his role in a scheme to pay Berlin about $6,000 for 
inside information on two Navy electronics contracts, the sources said. Lackner 
and an associate, defense consultant William L. Parkin, sold the data to 
Teledyne Industries Inc., of Newbury Park, Calif., and Hazeltine Corp. of Long 
Island, N.Y., to help the firms win lucrative Navy business. 
</P>
<P>
With his plea, Lackner would become the 12th person to admit to charges arising 
from the Ill Wind inquiry. Teledyne and Hazeltine also have pleaded guilty to 
charges of conspiracy, fraud and lying to the government. 
</P>
<P>
Three Teledyne officials face trial, beginning Monday, on charges of using 
Parkin and Lackner to bribe the Navy official for inside information. 
</P>
<P>
The three-year investigation into corruption in military weapons-buying broke 
open last June when agents of the Naval Investigative Service and the FBI 
searched the homes and offices of four dozen defense contractors, consultants 
and government officials. The inquiry has been described as the broadest ever 
into fraud and bribery in the Pentagon's $150-billion-a-year procurement 
system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Charges Likely 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors, under the direction of Henry E. Hudson, U.S. Attorney for 
the Eastern District of Virginia, are continuing to build cases against a 
number of defense consultants and Pentagon officials who have not been 
indicted. 
</P>
<P>
Their chief target is said to be former Assistant Navy Secretary Melvyn R. 
Paisley, who left the Navy in 1987 to become a highly paid consultant. 
Investigators are pursuing allegations that Paisley bribed his former Navy 
colleagues to steer contracts to some of the nation's biggest defense 
contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Another target is former defense consultant William M. Galvin, a Paisley 
associate and a well-known figure in the defense industry. Attorneys for 
Paisley and Galvin have asserted that their clients are innocent of any 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said Wednesday that Lackner decided to plead guilty and cooperate with 
prosecutors after Berlin, 51, and Parkin, 65, confessed to their roles in the 
conspiracy. Parkin, who attempted suicide two weeks ago, pleaded guilty to 
bribery and fraud charges last Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The two men are scheduled to be sentenced June 3. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor's case was built largely around wiretapped conversations between 
Lackner and Parkin in which the two made veiled references to money for Berlin 
as "a little green" and "a lot of spaghetti and meatballs." 
</P>
<P>
FBI surveillance cameras also recorded Lackner's withdrawing money from a bank 
and later meeting with Berlin, federal investigative sources said. But the 
actual transfer of funds was never witnessed, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Berlin admitted last week that, beginning in 1985, he sold confidential 
information on a Navy electronics contract to Lackner and Parkin, who in turn 
sold it to officers of a Teledyne subsidiary for $160,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Documents Show Deceit 
</P>
<P>
Parkin and Lackner agreed to split the Teledyne fee and pay a one-third share 
to Berlin. But, according to government documents, they lied to Berlin about 
how much they were paid and gave him only a tiny fraction of their fees. 
</P>
<P>
Teledyne, in the plea agreement under which it will pay the government at least 
$4.3 million in fines and reimbursements, called the plan a "corrupt and 
illegal arrangement" to subvert the Pentagon's procurement process. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said that Lackner, Parkin and Berlin were involved in a similar 
scheme to help Hazeltine win a different Navy electronics contract. Lackner and 
Parkin again allegedly misrepresented the size of their fee and gave Berlin 
less than a one-third share.

HALLEY'S COMET MAY BE A DEEP SPACE 'INTERLOPER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DYE, Times Science Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Halley's comet, which has fascinated scientists and lay people alike because of 
its periodic and sometimes spectacular return to the Earth's neighborhood, may 
have originated somewhere beyond the solar system, making it truly a visitor 
from deep space, scientists reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
It has long been thought that the periodic comet came from a cloud of "dirty 
snowballs" on the fringe of the solar system, but a new chemical analysis 
suggests that Halley may be different from all other objects in the solar 
system and could have been an "interloper" that was captured by the sun's 
gravity as it passed nearby. 
</P>
<P>
That scenario offers one explanation for why Halley now appears to be somewhat 
different than scientists had thought, said astronomer Susan Wyckoff of Arizona 
State University. 
</P>
<P>
Using a technique that has allowed astronomers to examine the chemical 
composition of a comet for the first time, Wyckoff and a team of researchers 
discovered that the ratio between carbon 12 and carbon 13 in Halley "differs 
from all other solar system objects examined, including terrestrial and lunar 
rocks, meteorites and the atmospheres of large planets," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The National Science Foundation, which sponsored the research along with the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, announced the results Wednesday. 
The findings are also reported in the April 1 issue of the Astrophysical 
Journal. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists used a sensitive instrument that reveals the chemical 
composition of a celestial body through a process called "spectral analysis." 
</P>
<P>
She said even an instrument as sensitive as the one used by the team is 
effective only on bright objects. The big question now remaining is whether any 
other comets have the same composition as Halley. 
</P>
<P>
"There's another bright one coming in sometime this summer," Wyckoff said. That 
comet, called Brorsen-Metcalf, should be bright enough for chemical analysis, 
and like Halley, it passes this way rarely. 
</P>
<P>
If it turns out that Halley is different than all other comets, "it might mean 
that it was a captured comet," she said. "The sun just ventured too close to an 
interloper comet" and the comet became trapped in the sun's gravitational 
field. 
</P>
<P>
That would explain one thing that has mystified scientists for centuries: 
Halley travels in the wrong direction as it orbits the sun. 
</P>
<P>
"Only five out of 124 (periodic comets that return again and again to the inner 
solar system) go around the sun backwards," she said. "People have been puzzled 
by that." 
</P>
<P>
That could be explained if Halley was an interloper captured by the sun's 
gravity and it entered the solar system in such a way that it ended up going 
around the sun in the opposite direction of nearly everything else. 
</P>
<P>
An alternative reason could be that a star exploded nearby just as the our sun 
was forming, "splattering parts of the solar system with carbon 12 material," 
Wyckoff said. Some materials, possibly similar to whatever formed Halley's 
comet, may have been somehow shielded from the blast and ended up with less 
carbon 12 than others. 
</P>
<P>
That could explain why the ratio of carbon 12 to carbon 13 is 89 to 1 
throughout most of the solar system, including on Earth, and only 65 to 1 in 
Halley's comet, according to the new findings. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the explanation, Halley's comet continues to engage the astronomical 
community despite the fact that it long ago disappeared from the southern sky 
on its journey back toward the outer edge of the solar system. It takes about 
76 years for the comet to complete one orbit, and it has been observed for more 
than 3,000 years.

Powerful thunderstorms spawned tornadoes in Texas and Louisiana and dumped more 
than a foot of rain in some areas, while a low pressure system left nearly a 
foot of snow on the Upper Plains. The National Weather Service said tornadoes 
touched down near Nacogdoches, Lufkin and Huntington, Tex., and Anacoco, La. 
There were no reports of injuries or serious damage. More than 14 inches of 
rain fell at Longview and 13 inches at Henderson, Chalk Hill and Atlanta in 
east Texas, the weather service said. Six inches fell at Hope, Ark., and nearly 
that much at Texarkana. Some roads were flooded and others were washed out in 
northeast Texas. Some homes in Texarkana reported 2 feet of water inside. A dam 
failed near Henderson and some people had to be rescued from trees by boaters. 
In Panama, Okla., the Poteau River was 6 feet above flood stage. The weather 
service reported 11 inches of snow at Petersburg, N. D., 7 inches at Larimore 
and 4 inches at Grand Forks.

The chairman of the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control said 
he will urge President Bush to promptly call a western hemispheric drug summit. 
Rep. Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.) rejected as unacceptable federal drug czar 
William J. Bennett's suggestion that the summit not be held until Bennett first 
draws up a national drug strategy. That plan, due in September, is to address 
education, treatment, law enforcement and interdiction. Rangel has long 
complained that the United States has no coordinated foreign policy on drugs. 
"We should hold the summit now. Leaders of South America are pleading for one," 
Rangel said.

The Beckman Laser Institute, a private medical research organization closely 
affiliated with UC Irvine, has entered into partnership with USC to compete for 
a $15-million federal grant to develop a new laser technology. USC officials 
confirmed that there have been discussions about relocating the Beckman 
Institute, which now leases property on the UCI campus, to Los Angeles, but 
said work could continue at both sites if USC beats six other universities 
seeking the Department of Defense grant. The Institute's participation "helps 
tremendously" USC's chances of winning the grant, according to Pablo Valencia, 
a USC biomedical engineer and coordinator of the project.

Buildings in Belfast's business district were evacuated for several hours while 
soldiers defused a 500-pound Irish Republican Army bomb, police said. The bomb 
was discovered in a parked car one week after the Northern Ireland office of 
the Confederation of Business Industry told its members of a police warning 
that terrorists planned to target them to destabilize the province's economy. 
The bomb was defused safely and no one was injured, a police spokesman said. 
The homemade device was found after the outlawed IRA telephoned a warning to a 
Belfast newspaper.

Syrian troops and their Lebanese allies bombarded Christian areas of Beirut in 
defiance of an Arab League appeal for a truce, while Christian Maj. Gen. Michel 
Aoun stepped up his vitriolic rhetoric against Syria. At least seven people 
were killed and 24 wounded in the day's violence in Lebanon. At a news 
conference at the bombed-out presidential palace, Aoun criticized U.S. 
Ambassador John McCarthy for being "somewhat wanting in courage" and not 
speaking out to protest the shelling until the ambassador's residence was hit. 
The current fighting was triggered by a naval and aerial blockade imposed by 
Aoun against Muslim-run illegal ports.

The Guatemalan government promised to replace the warden and all guards at a 
besieged prison and work to reform prisons nationwide if armed inmates 
surrender and set hostages free. The proposal was an attempt to end a 
four-day-old uprising and free hundreds of inmates and family members in the 
compound at the Pavon prison farm, about 15 miles east of Guatemala City. 
Earlier, authorities cut off water and power to try to end the mutiny by 
prisoners demanding reduced sentences, better food and treatment and 
replacement of the warden. About 110 prisoners who took no part in the 
rebellion escaped and were transferred to other institutions.

A loan to rebuild a chemical plant has been approved after being delayed until 
the plant's owner was cleared of suspicion that it knew of secret attempts to 
ship a rocket fuel element from its plant to Iran. The $92-million loan for the 
plant, vital to the nation's rocket fuel supply, was approved by the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration nearly a year after the plant blew up at 
Henderson, Nev. The loan from a Seattle bank, to be repaid almost entirely by 
federal taxpayers, is to Pacific Engineering &amp; Production Co. NASA and the 
Defense Department have agreed to buy 140 million pounds of ammonium 
perchlorate -- a rocket fuel oxidizer -- over seven years. The destroyed plant 
is about 30% rebuilt but at a new location: Cedar City, Utah.

EXPERTS HOPE BRIDGE FALL WON'T DELAY TROLLEY LINE 
</P>

Los Angeles County transit officials were cautiously optimistic Wednesday that 
the collapse of a partly completed 400-ton trolley bridge will not 
significantly delay the summer, 1990, scheduled opening of the first line of 
the region's multibillion-dollar mass transit system. 
</P>
<P>
While the cause of Tuesday morning's spectacular accident was still to be 
determined, contractors were developing plans to make up construction time lost 
when the concrete trestle for the Los Angeles-to-Long Beach trolley fell onto 
Firestone Boulevard in an unincorporated area of South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Eight people were injured, none seriously. They included two men who were 
trapped in a pickup truck that was crushed by the falling bridge, five bridge 
workers and a pedestrian. 
</P>
<P>
Workers moved quickly to reopen the busy thoroughfare, which officials 
originally predicted might be blocked for three days. By early Wednesday 
morning, the 110-foot span had been broken up and removed and all four lanes 
were open to traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an interagency team of state and county engineers began a 
two-pronged investigation to determine the cause of the near-tragedy and to 
ensure that other bridge-building projects in the county are safe. 
</P>
<P>
Attention focused on the timber-and-steel temporary structure that had 
supported the bridge. One transit official told The Times that, for no apparent 
reason, the temporary support structure, or "falsework," appeared to shift 
several feet and toppled "like a domino." 
</P>
<P>
There was still no estimate of total damage Wednesday. But officials with the 
county Transportation Commission, which is building the trolley system, said 
their insurance would cover losses. 
</P>
<P>
The $720-million, 22-mile Long Beach trolley, dubbed the Blue Line, is about 
70% complete and will be the first in the system to carry passengers. 
</P>
<P>
A segment from Long Beach to the southern edge of the Central City financial 
district is scheduled to open in July, 1990. A final leg, which will drop into 
a subway station beneath 7th and Flower streets in downtown Los Angeles, is not 
expected to open until 1991. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Connecting Links 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Line will connect with the Metro Rail subway, or Red Line, and the 
Century Freeway trolley, or Green Line, which are both scheduled to open in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's bridge collapse was the largest mishap so far in the county's 
ambitious mass transit construction program, which includes the RTD's Metro 
Rail subway and the commission's trolley lines that planners hope will some day 
extend for 150 miles. Thus far, the mass transit program's problems mostly have 
been construction delays. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, however, there was an embarrassing foul-up on another Long Beach 
trolley bridge being built across Compton Creek. Cracks developed in the 
surface of the bridge because steel reinforcing was placed improperly and 
commission inspectors did not catch it. The problem has since been corrected, 
with the contractor agreeing to pick up the added costs. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation of Tuesday's collapse -- a mishap that engineering experts 
described as highly unusual -- was expected to take several weeks. A task force 
of bridge experts and public works engineers from Caltrans, the county Public 
Works Department and the Transportation Commission was being assembled 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to get in there and do a thorough investigation and analysis of 
exactly what occurred," said Ed McSpedon, the commission's rail construction 
chief. "What we do know is that something unusual happened on that south 
abutment" where the trestle fell. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Temporary Structure 
</P>
<P>
McSpedon has emphasized that it was a temporary support structure that failed, 
not the bridge itself. He noted that the span was "still very much intact" 
after the accident, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Concerns about the quality of construction on the Firestone bridge contract, 
which includes two separate spans, were raised last year in an internal memo by 
a design engineer on the project. 
</P>
<P>
Those concerns included possible soil settlement problems with a temporary 
support structure similar to the one that apparently failed Tuesday, as well as 
the need for field engineers to be more aggressive in enforcing contract 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
A Transportation Commission official insisted Wednesday that those concerns 
were addressed shortly after they were raised last year, as the first of the 
two spans was being built. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the issues were responded to and reviewed," said commission spokeswoman 
Erica Gobel. She said the memo was part of the "normal checks and balances" and 
"healthy dialogue" between engineers on such projects. 
</P>
<P>
The engineer, who works for a consulting consortium hired by the commission, 
has declined to comment. He referred inquiries to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Gobel said it is the commission's policy that its own officials, rather than 
contractors and their employees, respond to news media inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison-Knudsen, the bridge contractor, also declined comment.

U.S. TO TAKE LEAD IN 'WHISTLE-BLOWER' SUIT AGAINST LITTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Justice Department disclosed Wednesday that it will take over prosecution 
of a private "whistle-blower" lawsuit accusing a Litton Industries subsidiary 
of overcharging the government by at least $25 million for computer work on 
hundreds of defense contracts. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, ordered unsealed Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Matthew M. Byrne 
Jr. in Los Angeles, accuses the company's Woodland Hills computer division of 
boosting charges to the government for computer time so it could charge 
commercial customers less. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers representing the former Litton data systems analyst who initially filed 
the suit, James Carton of Moorpark, said the suit could make the company liable 
for hundreds of millions of dollars in damages. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department lawyers declined to comment on the case, but in court papers 
unsealed Wednesday, the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles said the 
government has completed its investigation of Carton's allegations and has 
elected to "assume primary responsibility for prosecuting the action." 
</P>
<P>
Litton, one of the nation's leading suppliers of defense electronics equipment, 
said there is no truth to any of the allegations and said the company had in 
fact saved the government money by sharing computer time with commercial 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Claims Money Saved 
</P>
<P>
"We're aware of the general allegations being made, and what we would like to 
say is that in fact the exact opposite is true," said company spokesman John 
Thom. "There's been no overcharging. In fact, there's been substantial 
reduction in costs for the data processing services that division charges. 
We've been saving American taxpayers literally millions of dollars by selling 
to commercial customers." 
</P>
<P>
Under the federal False Claims Act, private citizens like Carton who believe 
they have evidence of wrongdoing against the government are allowed to file 
lawsuits that are kept under seal until the government investigates the 
allegations. If the government decides there is merit to the case, it can elect 
to take over the lawsuit and share a portion of any damages collected with the 
original "whistle-blower." 
</P>
<P>
"It's precisely the kind of case that the False Claims Act was designed to 
unearth," said John Phillips, one of the lawyers representing Carton. "No 
government auditor would have turned this up, regardless of how careful and 
thorough they were." 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit alleges that Litton, apparently in an attempt to attract more 
commercial computer customers, did not charge commercial clients for using 
Litton's computer memory banks beyond a certain "cap" level. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Government Clients 
</P>
<P>
There were no such "caps" for government contract clients, however, and the 
government has ended up paying the excess overhead for commercial customers, 
the suit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
Carton, 46, said in an interview that he discovered the problem when he was 
asked as technical director of the Woodland Hills division to do a 
profitability study of the company's computer clients. 
</P>
<P>
Carton said he discovered within a few days that there was no way to determine 
how much profit Litton derived from each customer because the accounting system 
between government and commercial clients was so intertwined. "I was deep into 
the bowels of the software that runs the machine, and I was apparently touching 
some nerves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Carton said he confronted his superiors with his findings -- that the 
government was clearly being overcharged for computer services -- but got no 
response. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips said he believes that Litton officials deliberately designed the 
accounting system to pass excess costs to the government. "It was conscious, it 
was deliberate, it was planned, and they were reaping the benefits of it all 
along," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lawsuit Initiated 
</P>
<P>
Carton filed the lawsuit about a year after he left the company on friendly 
terms in 1987. But he continued to work as a consultant for Litton and believes 
that the company has continued to mischarge the government. 
</P>
<P>
Litton officials declined to discuss details of the company's accounting 
system, and also declined to say what proportion of the company's computer 
customers are commercial clients. 
</P>
<P>
But Thom did say that sharing computer time between government and private 
customers allowed for economies of scale that were passed off in the form of 
savings to the government. 
</P>
<P>
"We're stunned by the fact that we would get sued over such a matter, when 
we're saving the government money," he said.

A 14-month-old girl was killed in Azusa on Wednesday when her uncle 
accidentally drove his car over the toddler, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Jorge Curiel, 34, returned to his home on North Alameda Avenue at about 1 p.m. 
and honked his horn, signaling his 4-year-old daughter to come out and open the 
gate, said Lt. Karen Pihlak. Curiel's daughter ran outside, opened the gate and 
entered the car with her father, a routine they practiced every day, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Unknown to either Curiel or his daughter, "her cousin had crawled out of the 
house following her," Pihlak said. "The little girl crawled into the driveway 
where she could not be seen by either her uncle or her cousin. He ran over her, 
crushing her under the left front wheel." 
</P>
<P>
The officer said no charges would be filed because the death appeared to be 
accidental.

SCULPTOR AGAIN AT WORK ON LOY STATUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite an incurable illness, sculptor William Van Orden is back at work, once 
again restoring Venice High School's famous statue of actress Myrna Loy and two 
other figures that were damaged by vandals. Van Orden has repaired the statues 
12 times over the last decade, replacing arms and heads that were broken off 
and once even dynamited. 
</P>
<P>
Van Orden had thought he would not be able to repair the statue after the most 
recent attack by vandals, because he has cancer. Doctors say he may live only 
another two months. 
</P>
<P>
However, after a recent Times story about the statue and Van Orden, he received 
nearly $600 in donations. The support persuaded him to repair Loy's statue one 
more time. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided I couldn't abandon her," he said. "I had to return one more time, 
this is my life's work and after I finish this job, I feel I can pass the job 
on to someone else."

FIRST GOVERNOR TO VISIT; 
</P>
<P>
DEUKMEJIAN GETS WARM WELCOME IN KOREATOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIRGINIA ELLIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sounding more like a candidate than a lame-duck politician, Gov. George 
Deukmejian used his first official visit to Koreatown Wednesday to tout his 
efforts to reduce crime, aid small business and improve trade with Pacific Rim 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
In a pointed reference to his predecessor, former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., 
Deukmejian took credit for appointing "over 700 common-sense judges" during his 
tenure in office and signing new laws strengthening criminal penalties. 
Deukmejian has repeatedly criticized Brown in the past for his judicial 
appointments, especially that of former Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Visit 
</P>
<P>
The 200 business leaders, who paid $20 apiece to attend the luncheon with the 
governor, greeted Deukmejian with a standing ovation but seemed more interested 
in his presence than the 20-minute speech he gave. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really the first time that a governor has visited Koreatown," said 
Edward R. Borcherdt, chairman of the Los Angeles Pusan Sister City Committee. 
"They're very excited about it, because it is a recognition of the importance 
of the Korean-American community in this city and this state." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Economic Strength 
</P>
<P>
Yoon Hee Kim, president of the Korean American Coalition, said the governor's 
visit symbolized the emerging political and economic strength of the 
Korean-American community, whose population has exploded in the last two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 350,000 to 500,000 Korean-Americans now reside in Southern 
California, with Los Angeles being home for the largest Korean population 
outside Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Kim said only in the last six years have Korean-Americans really begun to look 
at themselves as a community and to register to vote in any numbers. Even so, 
their voting strength -- she estimates it at 25,000 -- is still relatively 
small. Kim said their voting patterns appear to be evenly divided between 
Democrats and Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Real Commitment' 
</P>
<P>
"This is a community whose growth is absolutely phenomenal," she said. "Now 
it's time that the Korean community work with outsiders, but at the same time, 
we need a real commitment from mainstream politicians. The first and critical 
thing for us is to bring them down to see the community." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian declined an invitation to tour Koreatown, citing other commitments 
in his schedule, but Craig Coleman, executive director of the Korea Society, 
said he had agreed to lend his name to efforts to promote cultural and 
educational exchanges between Korea and the United States.

COLLECTION AGENCY WILL SHUT DOWN ITS OPERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
North America Credit Assn., one of the oldest and largest credit collection 
agencies in Southern California, notified clients Wednesday that it will cease 
operating April 30. 
</P>
<P>
However, delinquent debtors will not be let off the hook. Companies that employ 
collection agencies generally have several firms doing collection work for 
them, and observers said competitors will quickly pick up the business. 
</P>
<P>
An unknown number of employees will be laid off by the Pasadena company, which 
has annually collected about $500,000 in delinquent credit payments on behalf 
of companies such as GTE California, the Broadway department store chain and 
First Interstate Bank. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
200 Employees 
</P>
<P>
Until about three weeks ago, the company reportedly had about 200 employees, 
but owner Alexander Kreger told state authorities then that he was in the 
process of reducing that number "significantly." A woman who answered the phone 
at the company late Wednesday said the firm had no comment to make. 
</P>
<P>
Alonzo D. Hall, chief of the Bureau of Collections and Investigative Services, 
a unit of the State Department of Consumer Affairs that licenses the state's 
678 collection agencies, said bureau auditors will begin examining the 
company's books Monday. Hall said he had no idea what prompted the planned 
shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
For a time, he said, "we will take over the client accounts" to ensure that any 
money already collected on behalf of clients is turned over to them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
55-Year-Old Agency 
</P>
<P>
NACA, as the nearly 55-year-old agency is known, notified the bureau in 
Wednesday's mail of its intention to close. Hall said he talked with Kreger 
three weeks ago after receiving an anonymous tip that NACA was having financial 
difficulties. Hall said Kreger at that time denied any financial woes but 
acknowledged that he was reducing his staff. 
</P>
<P>
At GTE California in Thousand Oaks, spokeswoman Ilona Smith acknowledged that 
the company had been notified of NACA's decision to close but said the action 
would have little effect on the phone company. "We have seven agencies that we 
use, plus we do some of our own in-house collections before we ever go to an 
agency," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas the closing is not expected to affect consumers, competitors 
immediately set out to try to lure NACA's clients. 
</P>
<P>
"That's dead meat out there now, and they will be picking at the bones," Hall 
said. For the collection industry, he added, "it is really a big deal."

IT'S CHRISTMAS IN MARCH FOR GLENDALE'S RESIDENT SANTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale city attorney who argued the case thought the ruling was nothing 
short of vindication. So did his opponent, Santa Claus. 
</P>
<P>
The two were squared off over a consent decree that Glendale's self-styled 
Santa, Robert George, who keeps his home decorated for the holidays all year, 
had signed in November, 1987. In it, George gave up, among other things, his 
right to have visitors come to his home, except "bona fide" friends and 
deliverymen. Later, on the advice of the American Civil Liberties Union, George 
reneged on the clause, which the city said was designed to keep sightseeing 
crowds under control. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals chided the city for what it 
viewed as an "Orwellian" attempt to abridge a citizen's most fundamental rights 
-- those of free speech and association. 
</P>
<P>
But the court did not side with George entirely, noted Senior Assistant City 
Atty. Scott Howard. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing in the Constitution, the judges ruled, precludes a city from limiting 
the number of "Styrofoam bells, baubles, artificial animals, statuaries, or any 
other temporary or permanent Christmas-type ornaments . . . lights or lighting" 
a resident can put up, or when. 
</P>
<P>
Thus the Court of Appeals let stand George's agreement not to put up any more 
decorations than he had on Oct. 1, 1987, and to turn the remaining ones on only 
during the Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
"If there were to be any gripes at all about the decision, or any feelings of 
disappointment, it is that the court allowed him to back out of an agreement," 
Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa, on the other hand, seemed a touch more ebullient. 
</P>
<P>
"I beat the city," George said. "Santa Claus beat the city. They said I 
couldn't do it, but I did." 
</P>
<P>
The court was clearly piqued at the city's attempt to "ban members of the 
public from entering or remaining on appellant's property" and to allow "no 
more than two visits a month by terminally ill children," as the consent degree 
called for. 
</P>
<P>
The city argued that both parties understood that those words referred to the 
large crowds of sightseers at George's home. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not what the order says, nor can the First Amendment rights be the 
subject of unwritten and, therefore, unenforceable understandings," the court 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither side, at this point, plans an appeal. But that doesn't mean the case is 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
George said he plans a victory party. He also intends to put back up the lights 
he took down after the city began enforcement against year-round Christmas at 
his rented home on Alameda Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Howard says he will be watching for illegal lights.

PROJECT ACTIVIST ALARMED BY HOUSING AUTHORITY REBUKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN F. BUNTING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last month, Margarito Gutierrez went door to door in the Estrada Courts public 
housing project, collecting money from his neighbors so he could attend a 
housing conference in Washington. One tenant gave four pennies. Another kicked 
in two quarters. In all, Gutierrez raised $627. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez, a member of the Housing Authority Residents Advisory Committee, 
returned from the conference three weeks ago with a message for his fellow 
tenants: Beware that the Housing Authority could sell Estrada Courts in East 
Los Angeles to a private developer just as it plans to do with the dilapidated 
Jordan Downs public housing project in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, according to Gutierrez, Housing Authority officials summoned him to 
the manager's office at Estrada Courts to rebuke him for going to Washington 
and for appearing on two Spanish-language television stations in Los Angeles to 
criticize the proposal to sell Jordan Downs. A housing official defended the 
visit to Gutierrez, claiming the tenant needlessly frightened other project 
dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez, 44, a longtime resident of Estrada Courts, said Wednesday that he 
was grilled during a 20-minute meeting with Leonard Karter, the agency's group 
operations manager for Eastside projects, and Georgina Garcia, the manager of 
Estrada Courts. Karter posed a series of questions on the trip to Washington 
and on his television appearances, Gutierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
"He started to interrogate me. 'What did I say in Washington? Who gave me 
permission to talk to television? Why was I making people afraid?' " Gutierrez, 
who speaks little English, said in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Karter said Wednesday the thrust of the meeting was to assure Gutierrez that 
Estrada Courts was not for sale. Karter denied that he inquired about the 
Washington trip, but acknowledged asking about the television appearances, 
including questions about Gutierrez's motivation and who initiated the 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
"We discussed the free speech thing," Karter said of the Tuesday meeting. 
"Anybody can say what they wish but at the same time, he had a responsibility 
not to alarm tenants." 
</P>
<P>
The meeting occurred Tuesday afternoon -- the same day that Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky assailed the Housing Authority and its executive director, Leila 
Gonzalez-Correa, for proposing a ban on public comment by the agency's 
employees. Gonzalez-Correa has introduced a policy that would prevent employees 
from writing or speaking to housing commissioners, City Council members, 
government workers and reporters without the executive director's permission. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky introduced a motion Wednesday recommending that the Housing 
Authority Board of Commissioners reject the proposed policy and that 
Gonzalez-Correa be required to appear before the City Council. The motion was 
scheduled to be heard next week. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez reported the meeting with Karter to David Etezadi, a Legal Aid 
Foundation attorney who represents East Los Angeles tenants. Etezadi said he 
was "outraged" by the incident and considers the actions by housing officials 
"a violation of Gutierrez's rights." Etezadi pointed out that, a year ago, the 
Housing Authority sent a police officer to question a tenant who had signed a 
petition calling for Gonzalez-Correa's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is an intimidation tactic," Etezadi said. "Clearly, they are trying 
to extend the gag order to residents." 
</P>
<P>
Etezadi said Gutierrez called him Tuesday "very much upset" that he had been 
reprimanded by the Housing Authority. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Gutierrez has been working real closely with residents throughout the city 
to oppose the sale of Jordan Downs," Etezadi said. "His fear as a tenant 
representative stems back to a year ago when the executive director guaranteed 
that the Housing Authority would never sell a development. He, as well as other 
residents, feel incredibly betrayed. He has been quite active since the 
announcement of the sale warning people that the same thing could happen in 
their own developments." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Gonzalez-Correa issued a bulletin advising tenants that the 
Housing Authority had no plans to sell Estrada Courts, housing officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez, a factory worker who has been on welfare since he was laid off two 
years ago, lives in a clean, well-kept five-bedroom apartment in Estrada Courts 
with his wife and six children. A captain of his Neighborhood Watch program, 
Gutierrez was elected two years ago by tenants at Estrada Courts as their 
representative on the residents advisory committee. Since then, he has been a 
relentless activist in organizing tenants at Estrada Courts to keep their 
project clean and crime-free. 
</P>
<P>
In news interviews that aired over the last week on television stations KMEX 
Channel 34 and KVEA Channel 52, Gutierrez said he feared that Estrada Courts 
may be put up for sale because tenants have spotted groups of Chinese investors 
walking through the project on weekend mornings. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez said he attended the National Convention of Urban Homesteading and 
Resident Management conference in early March because he wanted to learn how 
residents became owners and managers of public housing projects in Washington 
and other cities. He hopes to begin a process this year for residents to take 
over Estrada Courts.

ENCINITAS GENERAL PLAN STRICTLY LIMITS GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Culminating nearly two years of debate and scores of hearings, the Encinitas 
City Council on Wednesday adopted the fledgling municipality's first general 
plan, an ambitious blueprint for the future that includes strict limits on 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
The council approved the plan on a 4-1 vote, with Councilwoman Gail Hano 
dissenting because of her opposition to the slow-growth provisions of the 
document. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Anne Omsted said adoption of the plan marks "a milestone in city 
history," but echoed Hano's concerns about the tough controls on growth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
200 Units Annually 
</P>
<P>
Omsted expressed hope after the meeting that the council could work together in 
the coming months to hammer out less restrictive slow-growth measures 
acceptable to all factions in the city, which incorporated in 1986 on a wave of 
anti-development sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from dramatically reducing projected housing densities from the days of 
county rule, the new general plan includes a cap on housing construction of 
about 200 units annually and requires voter approval for significant changes in 
land use or for density increases. 
</P>
<P>
Taken in total, the density reductions would allow a population of 65,000 at 
buildout, contrasted with an eventual population of 75,000 under the old county 
land-use plans. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say adoption of the plan represents a significant symbolic step 
for Encinitas, the final act in throwing off the yoke of county rule. 
</P>
<P>
"I almost feel choked up thinking of all the things we requested for so many 
years, all of them finally being put into one general plan," Councilwoman 
Marjorie Gaines said before the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Acting as a sort of municipal constitution, the plan embodies a wide range of 
rules and standards for development, among them tighter grading restrictions, 
tougher landscaping requirements, strict design reviews and regulations to 
better protect environmentally sensitive areas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Effort for Migrants 
</P>
<P>
Although city officials were bullish on the new general plan, critics remained 
to the end. In particular, advocates of more low-income housing for migrant 
workers mounted a last-ditch effort to alter the plan. 
</P>
<P>
During the past year, migrants camping out in the hills around Encinitas have 
come under increasing pressure from local authorities eager to see them 
uprooted. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates for the immigrants argue that the city's new plan is a barrier to the 
construction of affordable housing for those displaced from their simple homes 
of scrap lumber and plastic sheeting in the squalid migrant encampments. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with California Rural Legal Assistance, a group that aids the 
impoverished migrants, wrote letters to the city and state in an effort to 
argue their case. 
</P>
<P>
"This plan is stunningly exclusionary," Claudia Smith, regional counsel for 
California Rural Legal Assistance, said in an interview before the meeting. "It 
makes Newport Beach look good. Encinitas officials don't want poor immigrant 
workers in any way, shape or form, and this general plan is the proof in the 
pudding." 
</P>
<P>
Smith protested an effort by the city to get a one-year extension on Friday's 
deadline for adopting the general plan. Under state law, cities have 30 months 
after incorporation to approve a general plan, but Encinitas is seeking to 
extend its deadline until next year to immunize its land-use plan from legal 
challenges while authorities tinker with the document. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Considered Suing 
</P>
<P>
Smith characterized the city's request as "a transparent attempt to foil 
litigation for a year." Her group has considered suing the city because of 
concerns about the plan's effect on low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
If the state grants the one-year extension, Smith said, the city should be 
allowed to approve construction of large projects consisting of 10 or more 
units only if 25% of the homes are set aside as affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Warren Shafer agreed that the city wants the time extension as a 
safeguard against litigation. 
</P>
<P>
But he said officials are wary of legal challenges simply because the general 
plan is still scheduled for review by the state Coastal Commission, which could 
order changes in the document. Moreover, city planners will continue to work on 
zoning provisions of the plan during the coming year. A lawsuit or two would 
only complicate either process, Shafer said. 
</P>
<P>
Although a suit over the migrant issue could loom, city officials contend that 
their greatest concern is a legal challenge by developers. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we're just trying to avoid unnecessary litigation and expense," 
Shafer said, noting that officials hope to have the city's plan before the 
Coastal Commission for review in the next few months.

SCHOOLS AWAIT WORD ON TEST SCORE MISTAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Schools in San Diego County and throughout California will find out later this 
week that their scores on a key statewide test of writing skills for 
eighth-graders were computed erroneously for the spring of 1987, the first year 
that the test was given. 
</P>
<P>
The schools only last week learned their scores for the second year of the 
writing test, given in the spring of 1988, and received comparisons between the 
two years, which will now have to be refigured by state California Assessment 
Program testing officials. 
</P>
<P>
For the San Diego Unified School District, the revised scores will offer little 
solace, as the results will still show that their students fall behind their 
peers in other county districts and across the state in their ability to 
organize their thoughts and write coherent essays on an assigned topic in a 
45-minute test. 
</P>
<P>
Some of San Diego's 22 junior highs and middle schools will find that they did 
better in 1988 than in 1987, and others will learn they did not do as well as 
they thought. But the trend in San Diego still points to shortcomings with the 
district's writing programs, despite the increased emphasis on teaching writing 
during the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Designed by UCSD Professor 
</P>
<P>
"No one is going to applaud, even with the (revised) scores," Robert Raines, a 
testing evaluator for the San Diego district, said Wednesday. "When all is said 
and done, the bad news is still going to be that the district is below the 
state on writing achievement, and that is not good enough for us." 
</P>
<P>
The CAP writing test, designed by UC San Diego literature and writing professor 
Charles Cooper, is the state's first to directly assess student writing ability 
rather than evaluate it on the basis of responses to multiple-choice questions 
on standardized tests. 
</P>
<P>
Students are asked to write an original essay on topics in one of six areas of 
writing -- including autobiography, evaluation and problem-solving -- with the 
grading done by selected teachers from around the state. 
</P>
<P>
Under CAP procedures, scores for individual students are not collected. Rather, 
data is compiled for individual schools and for school districts to measure the 
state's educational pulse each year and see whether state goals are being met 
by educators. 
</P>
<P>
The mistake happened because the consultants failed to take into consideration 
the number of students at each school who took the test, state CAP official Pat 
McCabe said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Performances Dropped 
</P>
<P>
No one noticed the discrepancy until scores for the spring 1988 test -- 
correctly calculated -- were received during the past couple of weeks, which 
showed that most San Diego city schools dropped in performance between 1987 and 
1988 -- or stayed about the same -- despite increased attention to writing in 
the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Several principals called Raines to ask how their scores could have dropped, in 
some cases quite dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
One example of what has happened is at Memorial Junior High School. It had been 
told there was a difference of only 1 point between its 1987 and 1988 scores. 
This was a disappointment because the school is now a special magnet writing 
academy in an effort to boost performance among its overwhelmingly Latino 
student body and to attract Caucasian students. 
</P>
<P>
Raines said that Memorial's revised 1987 score will now drop significantly, 
meaning that its 1988 score will reflect considerable improvement. 
</P>
<P>
But, despite expected comparison gains at some schools, most schools and the 
district will report 1988 scores below the state average. 
</P>
<P>
District administrators do not yet fully understand why their schools' writing 
performance lags behind countywide and state averages. The district has 
sponsored workshops for teachers to learn new techniques, participated in a 
countywide writing project for secondary schools, and in general stressed the 
need for more writing in all major academic areas. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD's Cooper said questions asked of students taking the CAP tests show that, 
no matter the socioeconomic base of a school, "where the emphasis is on writing 
in all areas of teaching and where every teacher takes an interest in writing, 
there are big gains. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Strong Leadership' 
</P>
<P>
"The research also supports the need to practice a lot of different kinds of 
writings, that gains in literacy are connected to specific uses and that 
teachers need to be encouraged to teach writing more carefully. 
</P>
<P>
"In addition, a principal has to show strong leadership in encouraging 
teachers." 
</P>
<P>
At one of the district's bright spots -- Mann Middle School in East San Diego 
-- its 1988 score is well above district and state averages, and its 1987 score 
will probably be revised downward, meaning the school will be one of the few in 
the district to make significant gains. 
</P>
<P>
"It results from a concentrated effort spearheaded by our teachers," Mann 
Principal Maruta Gardner said. "We devised a plan where each department, such 
as math, took upon itself to emphasize two particular types of writing and we 
did that throughout the year, not just during the testing period." 
</P>
<P>
Almost a quarter of Mann's students are not yet proficient in English, and 
about a quarter more, although fluent, are not native English speakers, making 
the school's performance all the more remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
"With our population, we knew we had to work hard at this, and not just tell 
the kids that they should get a good night's sleep before the test and to eat 
well. We decided last year that we needed to have a plan," Gardner said. 
</P>
<P>
At Correia Junior High in Point Loma, the revised scores will mean less of a 
drop between 1987 and 1988 than Principal Mike Lorch thought, although there 
will still be a drop. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very disappointing . . . and basically, instead of coming up with 
explanations to gloss over and mitigate, we basically know that we are not 
writing enough and not writing enough in a lot of areas. That's something I 
want to sit down with my teachers and support committees and figure out why.

ZERO-TOLERANCE POLICY ALIVE AND WELL, AND IN EFFECT ALONG THE BORDER

Adam Kramer, 23, was coming back across the border at Calexico last week with 
two friends after a mountain-climbing trip in Mexico wheS. Customs agents 
seized his 1975 Plymouth Valiant. Inspectors said they found a 10th of a gram 
of marijuana -- barely a pinch -- in the pocket of one of his friends. 
</P>
<P>
Two days earlier, the Thomas Washington, a Scripps Institution of Oceanography 
research ship, was seized in Honolulu after Customs agents said they found a 
gram of marijuana hidden in a crew member's berth. 
</P>
<P>
The Thomas Washington was allowed to sail on after of few days of legal 
wrangling. But Kramer, an art student at San Diego State University, has been 
without his car for more than a week, bumming rides from the friend who was 
caught with the pot. He is uncertain whether he will ever get his car back. 
</P>
<P>
The two incidents underscore the confusion that continues to characterize the 
government's implementation of its "zero-tolerance" anti-drug policy, which 
permits authorities to seize boats, cars, planes and trucks if even minute 
amounts of drugs are found on board. The policy came under fire about a year 
ago when authorities began a nationwide crackdown, threatening to seize cars 
and boats permanently. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the current confusion arises from the differing policies that apply to 
boats and cars. But owners also say they get conflicting information about 
whether, and how, they get their vehicles back. 
</P>
<P>
Seizures of boats are now relatively rare, but, with little fanfare, Customs 
has continued to seize cars at a steady pace at the California-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
Kate Thickston, a lawyer in the Federal Defenders office, said the seizure 
process is explained improperly to many motorists and, as a result, people like 
Kramer are unsure about how to petition for the return of their cars. 
</P>
<P>
"It's apparent that the Customs agents at the border take the opportunity that 
zero tolerance offers them to harass people at the border. It's not that I 
condone bringing any amount of a controlled substance into the country, but it 
seems people at the border are not given accurate information," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Confessions are taken from them . . . and some of the agents will say things 
like, 'If you don't admit it's yours, we'll just arrest you,' " Thickston said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Kramer: "I spoke to several of the officers there, and one of them said 
that usually the property is returned if the petition is valid. Two others said 
it was unlikely." 
</P>
<P>
Paper work handed to him by Customs agents reads, " . . . in appropriate cases, 
administrative relief may be considered. It should be noted that you will not 
be granted relief in the form of return of the seized property. Relief may be 
granted in the form of a monetary refund from the proceeds of sale of the 
property after it has been forfeited." 
</P>
<P>
To Kramer it was "fairly unclear exactly what you're supposed to do," Kramer 
said. The car, given to Kramer by his grandmother, has 30,000 miles on it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Should Get Car Back 
</P>
<P>
But Thickston said Kramer would probably get his car back if he could prove to 
Customs that he did not have any knowledge of the drugs being in his car, and 
after he pays a fine, probably about $300. 
</P>
<P>
"If he tried to prevent the controlled substance from getting into his car, 
he'll get his car back. He'll still pay towing and storage," Thickston said. 
</P>
<P>
Kramer's friend, who was allegedly in possession of what Customs agents at the 
border called "pipe scrapings," was released after being assessed a $150 
administrative penalty, the Customs Service said, confirming Kramer's account. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Customs Service relaxed the controversial policy for commercial 
fishing vessels last year to keep from penalizing innocent owners unaware of 
the actions of crew members or guests, authorities have been less lenient with 
car owners -- who form the bulk of people stopped under zero tolerance. Even 
though the Scripps vessel was not a fishing boat, Customs applied the relaxed 
policy in that case and allowed Scripps to continue operating the ship while 
the legal case is pending. 
</P>
<P>
But Customs agents continue to seize cars, refusing to return them even to 
"innocent" owners until the cases are resolved, which at best can take several 
months. Some lawyers label the policy a waste of taxpayer's money, an injustice 
to "innocent owners" and a burden on the court system. 
</P>
<P>
But Allan Rappoport, district director of the Customs Service in San Diego said 
the program seems to be operating smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Running Pretty Well' 
</P>
<P>
"Basically the zero-tolerance program for cars seems to be operating without a 
great deal of animosity or without much media visibility," Rappoport said. "I 
can only assume people for the most part have a better understanding of the 
program. It seems to be running pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, then-U.S. Atty. Peter K. Nunez arranged with the Customs 
Service to start the zero-tolerance policy in San Diego because "the notion had 
gained credence in the community that it was OK to use drugs in the community, 
just don't sell them. We had to dispel the notion that we had tacitly approved 
of using drugs." 
</P>
<P>
But, a year ago, a toughened policy created a backlog of cases and threatened 
to disrupt the functioning of federal courts and prompted an outcry against the 
crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, new guidelines have given more of the program's administrative 
duties to the Customs Service, lessening the burden on the U. S. attorney's 
office. Despite confusion in the minds of their clients, lawyers say the 
situation has reached "equilibrium," with most cars eventually being returned. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. Atty. Bill Braniff, who succeeded Nunez, says the program remains an 
important symbol in the fight against illegal drugs and is running smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you can't fight the war on drugs and say there is a safe haven for the 
personal use of drugs, that this is not criminal, that this is bad taste or 
otherwise, and expect everyone else to take it seriously . . . where (the 
federal government) has exclusive jurisdiction, we should show we're doing our 
part at all levels," Braniff said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Just the Principle' 
</P>
<P>
"The amounts that are seized aren't significant; it's just the principle." 
</P>
<P>
Compared to a year ago, the situation has improved, Braniff said. He has no 
plans to change the existing procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Figures from the U. S. attorney's criminal complaints section shows a slight 
decrease in zero-tolerance arrests since the program began in December, 1986. 
Braniff said there are 20 to 30 seizures a week at the border under the 
zero-tolerance policy. 
</P>
<P>
There were 49 such arrests this January, 54 in January, 1988, and 58 in 
January, 1987, a spokeswoman for the criminal complaints section said. 
</P>
<P>
Alleged offenders typically plead guilty to misdemeanor charges of possession 
of a controlled substance in order to have felony charges of importation of a 
controlled substance dropped. Generally, their cars are returned after they pay 
a fine. 
</P>
<P>
But the system nearly ground to a halt last May when the Customs Service 
refused to return cars and people refused to plead guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Customs Service spokesman John Miller in Los Angeles said that, although he is 
aware of challenges to the zero-tolerance policy "working their way through the 
court system," the program is working well now that the Customs Service had 
returned to its original policy of issuing fines instead of focusing on 
forfeiture. 
</P>
<P>
"There really is not a problem anymore . . . in most cases people can get their 
cars back -- with a hassle, I'll admit -- but it's a reasonable one," Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Kramer disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
"They detained us for an hour and a half. They said, 'Are you a calm person? 
Good, because we are taking your car.' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm furious, but what good does it do to be angry?" said Kramer. "I'm going to 
petition and do whatever I can to get back that car."

2 CAR FIRMS, TARGETED IN FRAUD PROBE, ARE CLOSED

<P>
Two auto sales companies, whose combined sales once dominated the local market 
but withered amid allegations of fraud, have been closed under the direction of 
a federal bankruptcy trustee. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, car carriers were loading inventory from Grand Chevrolet Inc. to 
transport the vehicles to an auction. Bankruptcy officials said the cars were 
being repossessed for liquidation by General Motors Acceptance Corp., the car 
maker's financing company. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Motor Vehicles failed last year in a bid to revoke the sales 
licenses of both Grand Chevrolet and Grand Motors Inc., members of a related 
chain of auto brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Owner Has Vanished 
</P>
<P>
Eminiano (Jun) Reodica, who owned the companies, vanished as his business 
empire collapsed. He is believed to have fled to the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
Department of Motor Vehicles investigators alleged that Reodica's companies had 
inflated sales figures, duped customers into signing documents that added extra 
charges, and processed loans through more than one lender. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, Reodica's sales force included members of a Filipino gang 
who occasionally strong-armed employees into cooperating with the fraudulent 
sales practices. 
</P>
<P>
Grand Chevrolet, which in 1987 ranked as the nation's third-largest auto 
dealership in sales volume, and Grand Motors both declared bankruptcy in 
August. Two other companies, a car financing arm and a real estate company, 
also closed. 
</P>
<P>
After two months of inactivity, the auto sales companies started selling cars 
under the direction of bankruptcy trustee Irving Sulmeyer, who took over after 
the companies filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors. 
</P>
<P>
During the reorganization, the companies set a monthly sales target of 300 to 
350 cars, about half the number the Grand companies reportedly sold each month 
before the collapse. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Total Debt 'Many Millions' 
</P>
<P>
"We fell substantially below the estimates," Sulmeyer said in an interview 
Wednesday. "Apparently, the community did not support the operations to the 
extent we had hoped . . . and the operations were not profitable." 
</P>
<P>
Pending the results of an audit, Sulmeyer said that he could not estimate the 
companies' total debt, but that "it obviously runs into the very many millions 
of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Until late last year, the companies had experienced rapid growth under the 
direction of Reodica, a Philippines native who built an automotive sales empire 
catering to immigrants. The companies became known for their liberal lending 
practices -- extending loans to people with credit histories that other auto 
dealers would not consider -- and for their multilingual sales force. 
</P>
<P>
Grand Chevrolet grew to be the largest minority-owned business in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
But in the aftermath of the collapse, several savings and loan firms and about 
1,000 individual investors in Reodica's companies were out tens of millions of 
dollars which they may never recover. More than 400 employees once were 
employed by the companies. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives from various investors have claimed that they have more than 
$42 million tied up in the companies. Imperial Savings &amp; Loan Corp. of San 
Diego, the largest creditor, bought $174 million in Grand car loans, $20 
million of which company officials have said may be uncollectable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Losses to City Cited 
</P>
<P>
Glendora stands to lose about $750,000 in annual sales taxes -- about 20% of 
the city's total sales tax revenue -- and will have to cut back on its budget 
for capital repairs and the purchase of new equipment, Larry Schroeder, city 
finance director, said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to make it, but it's been a rough year," he said.

<P>
The mother of twin boys who were found beaten and abandoned at a Del Mar hotel 
pleaded not guilty Wednesday to charges of child abuse, child abandonment and 
inflicting corporal injury on the boys. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Denise DeSimone, 25, of Oceanside was ordered held in jail in lieu of 
$250,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office filed the charges Wednesday against DeSimone and 
her boyfriend, Charles Thomas McCoy, 27. McCoy remains a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
No sex charges have been filed, despite earlier reports that the boys, found 
Saturday wandering at the Del Mar Inn, had been molested. 
</P>
<P>
A man suspected of being McCoy checked in with the 2 1/2-year-old boys earlier 
in the week. The occupant never checked out. 
</P>
<P>
The boys, who remain in Children's Hospital, had extensive bruises on their 
faces, some of which had been covered with makeup. 
</P>
<P>
The boys' uncle alerted police to their identities after seeing their pictures 
on television. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Municipal Judge Charles Patrick ordered a bail review for DeSimone 
for Monday and a preliminary hearing for April 12. 
</P>
<P>
She was arrested after arriving at the hospital to visit the twins.

STRUIKSMA HAS CHALLENGER IN COUNCIL RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Echoing the words of President Bush's inaugural address, lawyer Mike Eckmann 
announced Wednesday that he plans to oppose San Diego City Councilman Ed 
Struiksma in this fall's 5th District race. 
</P>
<P>
Calling for a "kinder and gentler philosophy at City Hall," Eckmann said he 
would bring a more balanced approach to land-use decisions and other issues 
than Struiksma, whom he described as "unquestionably the most pro-growth 
member" of the council. 
</P>
<P>
"The incumbent's eight years of special-interest considerations have resulted 
in community confusion, confrontation, divisiveness and citizen initiatives and 
referendums," Eckmann said. "We need new, enlightened leadership so that more 
citizen land-use initiatives and referendums will not be necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Eckmann is former head of Mayor Maureen O'Connor's open space task force and a 
former city budget official who, in addition to his legal career, has worked 
part time for the county planning department since 1980. The father of two, 
Eckmann, 44, and his wife live in Scripps Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
The 5th District, which Struiksma has represented since 1981, covers 
northeastern San Diego.

AIR/SPACE AMERICA DEMOTES ADMIRAL IN BID TO KEEP TROUBLED AIR SHOW FLYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move apparently intended to bolster its chances of recapturing city 
permission to hold a 1990 air show, Air/Space America has relieved retired Rear 
Adm. Bill Walsh of financial responsibilities and demoted him from president to 
vice president for operations. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Wilson, former San Diego congressman, chief executive officer and one of 
the founders of the organization, said Thursday that Walsh requested the change 
of duty to reduce his working hours. Wilson insisted that the change in title 
is not a demotion. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a forward step we've been planning for some time, and we're taking it, 
and it's going to work to our advantage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Several San Diego City Council members have pointed to a $4.2-million debt from 
the 1988 aerial extravaganza at Brown Field as one of the reasons for their 
Feb. 7 decision to revoke the organization's permit to stage a similar show 
next year and withdraw $300,000 in city support. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reconsideration Due 
</P>
<P>
At least one councilman, Ed Struiksma, has said he is doubtful about supporting 
the organization's bid for another show with Walsh in charge. Councilman Bob 
Filner has also said that he sees no reason to reconsider Air/Space America. 
</P>
<P>
"It's true that some of the council members have indicated . . . that he's the 
problem," Wilson said. "But it's very easy to say that without knowing the 
man." 
</P>
<P>
The decision comes just weeks before Air/Space America is scheduled to request 
that the council reconsider its closed-door vote to cancel the air show. The 
hearing will be conducted in open session April 10. 
</P>
<P>
Air/Space America is competing with an unnamed, rival group of aerial showmen 
that has proposed taking over the show. The group is led by four men who 
organized components of the show for Air/Space America last year, but have 
since broken away from the organization. 
</P>
<P>
Air/Space America has hired two men to handle finances along with Wilson, who 
also will take a more active role in organizing and promoting the show. Walsh's 
position is a new one that puts him in charge of arranging the show's events, 
Wilson said.

A 14-year-old Newhall boy pleaded not guilty Wednesday to a charge that he 
strangled a 7-year-old neighbor girl last week. 
</P>
<P>
At his arraignment in Sylmar Juvenile Court, Curtis Cooper denied that he 
murdered Sara Nan Hodges, whose body was found behind a water bed in the boy's 
bedroom Sunday, three days after she disappeared. Cooper will remain in custody 
and is to appear in court April 25, when a trial date will be scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Although Cooper cannot be tried as an adult, if convicted, he could serve time 
in the California Youth Authority until he is 25. A defendant must be 16 or 
older to be tried as an adult in California, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy's mother, accompanied by two social workers from the public defender's 
office, was the only relative of Cooper who attended the hearing Wednesday. She 
broke into sobs as she waited at the defense table for her son to be brought to 
the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
When he appeared wearing a gray sweat shirt, brown pants and tennis shoes, he 
sat next to his mother but they avoided eye contact and did not speak to each 
other during the brief proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courtroom, Cooper's attorney, Public Defender Barbara Duey, would 
not disclose her defense plans. Duey said she had not had enough time to review 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lived in Florida 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Michelle R. Rosenblatt declined to discuss a possible motive 
for the slaying. Citing juvenile privacy laws, Rosenblatt also refused to 
respond to reports that Cooper had committed burglaries in Spring Hill, Fla., 
where authorities said he lived with his father before moving to Newhall in 
February to stay with his mother. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't confirm or deny anything about his background," Rosenblatt said. 
Authorities in Florida also declined comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenblatt said that an investigation is continuing and that tests by the Los 
Angeles County sheriff's crime lab to determine whether the young girl had been 
sexually assaulted are not complete. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe that the victim was killed Thursday afternoon, hours 
before sheriff's deputies launched a massive search for the girl. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, who assisted in the search, was arrested late Sunday after the girl's 
body was found stuffed between a wall and the headboard of a water bed. The 
house is in the 24900 block of Alderbrook Drive, five doors from where the 
victim lived with her mother Linda Hodges and sister Tisha Gates, 16. 
</P>
<P>
Olga Kaczmar, who rented two rooms in her house to Cooper and his mother, sent 
a letter to newspapers this week describing Cooper as "quiet, polite, obedient 
and very willing." 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, he had a troubled past life in Florida and that's why he was here," 
Kaczmar wrote. "His father threw up his hands and said, 'Enough!' and here he 
was. 
</P>
<P>
"His mother and I took over," Kaczmar continued. "In our home of friendship, we 
believed we could help him." 
</P>
<P>
Kaczmar wrote that the boy had recently joined a church group, held a strong 
interest in drafting and helped with house chores. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't see unhappiness or hostility," she wrote. "We thought everything was 
working out just fine. How could we have known that destiny could turn out so 
ugly?" 
</P>
<P>
Kaczmar said in a brief interview Wednesday that she wrote the letter to help 
her deal with her feelings. She also said the boy's mother "hasn't slept hardly 
at all since this happened. She already is totally destroyed. I don't know if 
she can get through this." 
</P>
<P>
Services for Sara Hodges are scheduled at 2 p.m. Friday in the Chapel of the 
Oaks at Eternal Valley Memorial Park and Mortuary on Sierra Highway. Dan Lang, 
director of the mortuary, said his firm is donating the services. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a community effort," Lang said, adding that area florists had donated 
flowers for the services.

DAVIS UNVEILS PLAN TO ALLOW SEARCHES OF AUTOS FOR GUNS

State Sen. Ed Davis, a former Los Angeles police chief, Wednesday unveiled a 
bill he said would give law enforcement agencies a valuable tool to fight gang 
violence by permitting them to conduct searches of automobiles for guns even 
without reason to believe that a crime has been committed. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, which civil libertarians immediately challenged as unconstitutional, 
would phase in a program that would permit random searches of vehicles in 
specified high-crime areas after an emergency was declared by local elected 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
It also would allow superficial visual inspections for weapons at checkpoints 
much like those now used to detect drunken drivers, even when an emergency has 
not been declared. 
</P>
<P>
"We must be able to protect ourselves one way or another from murder," Davis 
(R-Valencia) said in an interview after a press conference where he announced 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
He identified South-Central Los Angeles, where gang violence and drive-by 
shootings are common, as one area where the proposed law might be invoked. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Legal Precedent 
</P>
<P>
Davis acknowledged that there is no legal precedent in this country for random 
searches of automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "we're going to make legal precedent. . . . This, I think, has a 
chance of being declared constitutional. Who in the world would oppose this 
except my friends in the ACLU?" 
</P>
<P>
Joan Howarth, associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union of 
Southern California, said the Davis bill, if enacted, would be a clear 
violation of citizens' Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable 
searches. 
</P>
<P>
"There is not a court in the land that would uphold that proposal," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Howarth said Davis' plan "would suspend the Constitution. . . . The only reason 
anyone would be proposing this is the deep frustration so many of us have about 
crime that seems to be out of control." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he thought his bill could survive the ACLU's inevitable challenge 
because city councils and county supervisors, after reasoned debate, would 
authorize the random searches, rather than police agencies. That approval 
process would show that the decision to search was reached after sufficient 
deliberation, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
"All searches are not prohibited, only unreasonable searches," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even after an emergency was declared, only drivers who had renewed their 
licenses after January, 1990, would have to submit to searches since they would 
have agreed to allow the inspections as a condition of license renewal, Davis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Within four years, all drivers licensed by California would have signed forms 
authorizing a weapons search in emergency situations, the senator said. Such a 
condition can be placed on a driver's license because driving is a privilege, 
not a right, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a reasonable restraint on that privilege," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Howarth, however, said drivers cannot be forced to sign away a right to privacy 
in exchange for a license. 
</P>
<P>
"People in California, particularly Southern California, need to drive to go to 
school and to work and to conduct their lives," she said. "The right of travel 
has been recognized in this state and other states" by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' bill should also be challenged, she said, because it allows cars to be 
stopped at checkpoints and examined for weapons, though not thoroughly searched 
unless evidence of weapons is detected. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legality Upheld 
</P>
<P>
The legality of sobriety checkpoints, after which Davis' provision is modeled, 
was upheld 4 to 3 by the state Supreme Court in 1987 after the majority 
concluded that a minimal intrusion into a driver's privacy was justified for 
the public good. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' bill, in allowing an examination that is likely to take longer than a 
sobriety check, would seem more intrusive and the court would be unlikely to 
approve it, Howarth said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said the legal principals on which checkpoint inspections for weapons 
would be based have been upheld in the state and federal supreme courts. 
</P>
<P>
While Davis said he knew of no previous effort to rewrite the law on weapons 
searches, Berkeley City Atty. Manuela Albuquerque said that she studied the use 
of legal principals applied to sobriety checkpoints in 1987 and was convinced 
that they could not be used effectively on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
She said she concluded that the precedents on sobriety searches would not apply 
to any kind of weapons stop. 
</P>
<P>
Albuquerque added: "Our police said there would be no way to detect weapons" 
based upon the superficial inspections courts allow at sobriety checkpoints. 
</P>
<P>
"My conclusion was that the constitutional limitations were such that we 
couldn't get any practical benefit unless we transgressed them."

CSUN STUDENTS PROTEST GRADUATION AT BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 90 Cal State Northridge students on Wednesday angrily demanded that the 
university drop its plans to hold this year's graduation in the Hollywood Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The students said they were upset that graduating seniors will not be allowed 
to bring more than three guests to the May 26 ceremony. They also said they 
were angry that university officials may not be able to shake the hand of each 
graduating senior at the event, as has been customary in past ceremonies. And 
they charged that students were not consulted in planning for the graduation, 
which has been the subject of heated debate on campus since plans were 
announced Feb. 22. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people have been here four or more years and it would be nice to get 
some kind of personal recognition for our accomplishments," said 21-year-old 
LeAnne Ferry, a graduating senior who is majoring in finance. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, students persuaded administrators to back away from plans to 
hold the event at 7 a.m. at the bowl. The starting time was changed to 11 a.m., 
but the controversy over other aspects of the ceremony has not died down. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN Vice President Edmund P. Peckham, who attended the noon protest in front 
of the university's administration building, said the graduation must take 
place off campus because construction has closed the campus area in front of 
the library normally used for the ceremony. Administrators limited the number 
of guests to prevent overcrowding at the bowl, which holds 17,960 people and 
has parking for 3,500 cars, university spokeswoman Ann Salisbury said. 
</P>
<P>
Students who attended the protest at times shouted in anger at Peckham, who 
attempted to defend the university's handling of the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a question of what's going on" at the graduation, one protester 
shouted. "It's how the administration is treating us." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Student Vote Asked 
</P>
<P>
Janice Morris, an Associated Students senator, said she has two petitions with 
a total of 900 signatures opposing the graduation plan. Protesters proposed a 
special ballot to determine how many graduating seniors oppose the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Salisbury said graduation probably will be held on campus again next year. She 
said a campus athletic field used for last year's ceremony could not be used 
again this year because the university does not have enough money to rent 
bleachers. Last year, bleachers were paid for by a one-time, $80,000 grant from 
the California State University system chancellor's office. The total cost of 
last year's graduation was about $120,000, compared to $50,000 for this year's 
event, Salisbury said. 
</P>
<P>
Peckham said seniors probably will receive some form of individual recognition 
at the ceremony. But the Hollywood Bowl's design prevents students from 
marching on stage and shaking President James W. Cleary's hand, Peckham said. 
</P>
<P>
The graduates will be recognized individually at receptions given by academic 
departments on campus after the ceremony, Peckham said. 
</P>
<P>
Salisbury said 3,900 bachelor's degrees and 750 master's degrees will be 
awarded at the graduation, the largest in the university's history.

ASSAILANT KILLS SELF DURING POLICE CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A despondent 46-year-old Long Beach man died Tuesday night after firing a shot 
into his head as he rode his motorcycle on a freeway with police in pursuit, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident culminated a series of events that began just before noon Tuesday 
when the man shot his ex-girlfriend at a Mission Valley hotel where she worked, 
police spokesman Dave Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Norman A. Logan walked into the hotel on Waring Road at 11:45 a.m., hit a clerk 
over the head and walked into the office of his ex-girlfriend, Carol Koepke, 
33, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Logan fired several shots into Koepke's legs and took her purse, keys 
and car, which he later ditched at a spot where he picked up his motorcycle. 
The car was found in the 6500 block of Mission Gorge Road early Wednesday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Logan was spotted by police about 12:15 p.m. riding north on Interstate 805 in 
Sorrento Valley. They flashed their overhead lights, Cohen said, and Logan, who 
was traveling about 60 m.p.h., slowed and began to pull his motorcycle to the 
freeway shoulder, then shot himself with a 9-millimeter automatic. 
</P>
<P>
His motorcycle skidded into the freeway, snarling traffic, but no one else was 
injured, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Koepke was in good condition Wednesday at Sharp Memorial Hospital with three 
gunshot wounds to her legs, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Logan died at 11:30 p.m. at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, Deputy 
Coroner Jerry Hillbrand said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Two men were fatally shot Tuesday night and a third wounded when two gunmen 
opened fire at a party in Southeast San Diego. Police said known gang members 
were at the party. 
</P>
<P>
The gunmen were about 75 feet away when they shot at a group of about 20 people 
in front of a residence in the 700 block of Pyramid Street just before 10 p.m. 
They then fled on foot, homicide Sgt. Frank Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
Brisco Tyrone Black, 21, was pronounced dead at the scene, police said. Edward 
Anthony Daniels, 18, died about an hour after being rushed to Mercy Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Hill, 21, was shot in the foot and was treated and released at San Diego 
Physicians &amp; Surgeons Hospital. None of the three men is a known gang 
member, Martinez said.

COMPROMISE OFFERED FOR USE OF BILTMORE SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Hermosa Beach citizens advisory committee, offering a compromise solution to 
a longstanding dispute, has recommended that 70% of the city-owned Biltmore 
site be used for an "urban public plaza" and that the rest be sold to 
commercial developers. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, which received the recommendation Tuesday night, indicated 
that it would study the proposal from the 11-member group. The council could 
adopt the recommendation, shelve it or put it on the November ballot -- along 
with a citizens initiative calling for using the 0.84-acre parcel entirely for 
open space. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative, circulated by community activist Parker Herriott, qualified for 
the ballot earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Residents, developers and city officials have wrestled for nearly a decade over 
the fate of the vacant property at 15th Street and The Strand, where the 
Biltmore Hotel once stood. Seven proposals, including various plans to build 
hotels, have been rejected by voters. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of the advisory group, set up by the council late last year, 
recommended using the west portion of the Biltmore site nearest The Strand as a 
recreational park or plaza. The remaining 30%, between 15th Court and 15th 
Street on the north and 14th Street on the south, would be sold for commercial 
use, such as a restaurant or bar -- but not a hotel or motel. The height of any 
buildings would be limited to 30 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Money from the sale would be used to prepare the open space for public use, 
with any leftover earmarked for the purchase of the Atchison, Topeka &amp; 
Santa Fe right of way through the city, which planners see as another park. 
</P>
<P>
Three members of the committee submitted minority reports. Rosamond Fogg and 
Kathy Bergstrom suggested building homes on the Biltmore site, and Patricia 
Hill proposed that the entire parcel be zoned open space and that residents be 
given a chance to vote on using it as a park. 
</P>
<P>
The group, headed by George Schmeltzer, spent more than two months listening to 
a wide variety of views before reaching the compromise between open space and 
commercial use.

LACK OF PERMIT CLOUDS STATUS OF DEVELOPMENT OF LAS PULGAS CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH J. GARCIA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ever since a developer purchased a rugged 26-acre coastal canyon in Pacific 
Palisades last year, plans to develop the site have been shrouded in secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
Now, they also are clouded by controversy. 
</P>
<P>
California Coastal Commission officials said recently that the developer may 
not be able to continue geologic testing in Las Pulgas Canyon unless he 
complies with the conditions they imposed on him two months ago. Although the 
commission granted the developer a permit to do the testing, it has refused to 
actually issue the permit until he complies. 
</P>
<P>
Commission staff members said the developer, Neil Senturia, had requested 
last-minute changes in the permit conditions, which were levied by the board 
after an investigation revealed that Senturia had illegally graded the slopes 
in the canyon. Coastal Commission Chairman Michael Wornum earlier called it 
"one of the most serious violations I have ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
Senturia was ordered by commissioners in January to fill in the roads that he 
cut into the landslide-plagued canyon and to post a $12,000 performance bond to 
ensure that he would comply with the commission's directive. But the bond was 
received late, and an environmental watchdog group, Save Las Pulgas Canyon, 
complained that the developer had failed to provide it with restoration plans 
as promised. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Too Late to Fix' 
</P>
<P>
"Before I can issue a permit, I have to make sure that they have done 
everything that they said they would do in order to comply with the 
conditions," said Pam Emerson, a commission staff analyst. "I can't issue part 
of a permit. Now is too late to fix a mistake if they've made one." 
</P>
<P>
Commission staffers said Senturia had requested a change in the landscaping 
plans included in the restoration project. Emerson said a decision on whether 
to grant the coastal permit probably would be made this week. 
</P>
<P>
The permit snag was just the latest problem to flare up in the long-running 
dispute over the fate of the canyon. Residents of the nearly 170 homes above 
the canyon, hit by a major landslide six years ago, say they fear that any 
further work in the canyon may jeopardize their hillside residences. 
</P>
<P>
And backers of the group trying to preserve the canyon as open space say 
Senturia has purposely delayed the restoration project, which was supposed to 
have been completed last week. In addition, they question whether the $12,000 
performance bond was enough to restore the huge road cuts in the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'As Cheaply As He Can' 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's trying to get by as cheaply as he can," said Ron Wolf, president 
of Save Las Pulgas. "In my wildest imagination, I can't see $12,000 coming 
close to paying for the work necessary to restore the canyon." 
</P>
<P>
Senturia could not be reached for comment. However, his attorney responded to 
the charges by sending a letter to the group accusing one of its members of 
trespassing on the property. Wolf denied the charge. 
</P>
<P>
Relations between the developer and the environmental group have deteriorated 
so badly that Senturia recently met with Councilman Marvin Braude to plead his 
case and apologize for illegally grading the fragile canyon slopes. Braude said 
he advised the developer to attempt to "get the community involved" and make 
amends with the Save Las Pulgas group. 
</P>
<P>
Sources involved in the fight over the canyon said Senturia is considering 
building about 40 homes on the site, which borders Sunset Boulevard just north 
of Temescal Canyon Road and extends to Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decision on Work 
</P>
<P>
L. Paul Cook, president of C.W. Cook Co., the civil engineering firm that 
Senturia hired to handle development plans, said an amendment to the permit 
conditions is being sought because of a decision not to do some of the 
landscaping work by hand. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided to use a different method of landscaping rather than have workmen 
planting in some of those landslide areas," Cook said. "After we do some of the 
remedial work, we can decide what needs to be fixed and what doesn't need to be 
fixed." 
</P>
<P>
Senturia purchased the canyon site at a fire-sale price of $1.4 million last 
summer. In previous interviews, he has insisted that he cannot divulge any 
plans about the site because no sound development plans can be drawn until 
geologic testing has been completed. 
</P>
<P>
However, the secrecy about the property has generated fear about the fate of 
Las Pulgas Canyon. A major hotel chain reportedly offered Senturia $30 million 
for the land last year, and a Los Angeles real estate broker who specializes in 
international properties disclosed that several foreign investors were eyeing 
the site to build a private estate. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Coastal Commission said it would grant Senturia a permit to 
continue geologic testing if the restoration work is done, several angry 
commissioners said such a decision would not preclude a investigation into the 
grading violation. Peter Douglas, executive director of the commission, said he 
wants to see the restoration work done as soon as possible to "minimize the 
damage" done to the canyon.

MCCALLUM MAY JOIN CHARGERS IN FALL; 
</P>
<P>
HE EXPECTS TRANSFER HERE, HOPES TO MAKE FOOTBALL PART-TIME JOB

Napoleon McCallum, the former Navy All-American and Raider running back, said 
Wednesday he expects to be transferred to a local Naval recruiting office here 
in May. And if the Navy doesn't change its regulations allowing personnel to 
work an outside job part time, he said he expects to play for the Chargers in 
the fall. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers obtained McCallum last October in a move that completed the terms 
of the controversial July trade that sent offensive lineman Jim Lachey to the 
Raiders for offensive lineman John Clay. The deal was controversial because 
Clay reported to the Chargers overweight and then missed most of the season 
with a neck injury. 
</P>
<P>
McCallum, who recently completed the sea portion of his Naval obligation, 
requested orders last November that would place him in the San Diego recruiting 
office. He must now attend a recruiting officers school in Orlando, Fla., that 
begins April 17 and ends May 10. If he then passes an exam, he would become 
eligible for assignment to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing definite right now, but I'm going to be working (for the Navy) 
in San Diego," McCallum said. "There's no doubt about it." 
</P>
<P>
He is so confident of that assignment that he recently entered an escrow 
agreement to purchase a house in north San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
McCallum's biggest concern is that the Navy could change its rules about 
allowing personnel to be employed in an outside part-time job. 
</P>
<P>
"I should be allowed to play," McCallum said when contacted by phone aboard the 
guided missile cruiser California, currently in port in Alameda. "But, if they 
(the Navy) want to make it so I can't play, they can. My situation is real 
political. It all depends on who's in office and what their feelings are." 
</P>
<P>
Naval officials were unavailable for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers are cautiously optimistic about having McCallum on the field next 
fall. Owner Alex Spanos stopped short of saying he expected McCallum in uniform 
next season. But, when asked if McCallum's attempt to purchase a house meant 
the Chargers could expect McCallum this year, Spanos said, "I'm pretty sure it 
does." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Ortmayer, the Chargers' director of football operations, emphasized the 
Chargers were "in no way" involved in McCallum's attempts to obtain the 
transfer to San Diego. "Other than that," he said. "I have no comment." 
</P>
<P>
McCallum said he talked briefly with Ortmayer Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
When the McCallum part of the trade was announced last October, the Chargers 
came under further criticism because McCallum's Naval obligations extended 
through December, 1989. What the Chargers didn't reveal was that McCallum's sea 
obligation would end early this year. According to McCallum, the Navy cannot 
assign him to duty at sea between now and the end of his obligation without his 
permission. 
</P>
<P>
McCallum, 28, graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in December, 1985 and was a 
fourth-round draft choice of the Raiders the following spring. He was assigned 
to the amphibious assault ship Peleliu, which was docked in Long Beach during 
the subsequent NFL season. 
</P>
<P>
Splitting time between the Navy and the Raiders, McCallum, 6-feet-2 and 215 
pounds, gained 536 yards on 142 carries and scored one touchdown. He returned 
eight kickoffs for a 22.9-yard average and seven punts for a 6.3 yard average. 
He also caught 13 passes. He started five games and rushed for a season-high 84 
yards against Houston. 
</P>
<P>
But the Navy subsequently reassigned him from the Peleliu to the California, 
berthed in Alameda. Geography prevented him from fulfilling his Naval duties 
and being a Raider. He did not play in 1987 or 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a tough question," McCallum said when asked if he was in physical 
condition to play football. "I don't have anyone to judge against to know if 
I'm in football shape." 
</P>
<P>
his replacement. 
</P>
<P>
The addition of McCallum to the Chargers would give them a big, fast back to 
complement Gary Anderson, who gained 1,119 yards last season, third best in the 
AFC. It also would mean they could eliminate one of their many areas of need 
before next month's NFL draft.

KINGS WIN TO CLINCH 2ND PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marty McSorley scored a fluke goal with 1:23 left in overtime as the Kings beat 
the Winnipeg Jets, 2-1, Wednesday night and clinched second place in the Smythe 
Division for the first time in their history. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave the Kings home ice advantage over the defending Stanley Cup 
champion Edmonton Oilers in the first round of the playoffs. The Kings, who had 
never finished higher than fourth in the Smythe Division, obtained Wayne 
Gretzky, McSorley and Mike Krushelnyski in a trade with the Oilers last August. 
</P>
<P>
It will be the fourth time in their last five playoff appearances that the 
Kings have faced Edmonton, and the first time they will have home ice 
advantage. The first two games will be played at the Forum next Wednesday and 
Thursday, with the series resuming April 8 and 9 at Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
It was the highest finish for the Kings since they moved from the Norris 
Division to the Smythe Division in 1981-82. 
</P>
<P>
On the Kings' winning goal, Steve Kasper took a 40-foot slap shot from the 
slot. Winnipeg goalie Pokey Reddick made a pad save and the rebound came out to 
McSorley at the left of the Winnipeg goal. As McSorley went past the goal line, 
he backhanded a pass toward Kasper, who continued toward the net. But the pass 
went off Winnipeg defenseman Dave Ellett's skate and deflected between 
Reddick's pads as he moved toward Kasper. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Fenton, a former King, scored at 6:18 of the second period for a 1-1 tie 
to force overtime. Fenton was at a deep angle on the right side and his 20-foot 
wrist shot went off Kelly Hrudey's left skate and in on the short side of the 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
Reddick, who made 48 saves, then kept the Jets in the game with big saves. He 
made a kick save as Gretzky tried to tap in a five-footer with 4:30 left. Then, 
with 28 seconds left in regulation, Gretzky broke in on Reddick and dropped the 
puck to Kasper, who got off a 10-foot backhander that Reddick smothered. 
</P>
<P>
With 2:10 left in overtime, Gretzky picked up a rebound and flipped it to Ron 
Duguay to the left of the Winnipeg goal. Duguay fired a backhander at Reddick, 
who made a sprawling save. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky netted his 54th goal of the season on an assist by Hrudey for a 1-0 
lead with 4:28 left in the first period. After making a save, Hrudey passed the 
puck to Gretzky, who moved down the left side, cut toward the middle and 
drilled a 35-foot shot past Reddick.

PADRE FAN FAVORITE RETURNS; 
</P>
<P>
FLANNERY CAUGHT WAVE AT END OF LAST SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tim Flannery won't give out the name of the place. If he gives out the name, 
next thing he knows, somebody is rooting around up there in a boutonniere 
passing out business cards and looking for building permits. 
</P>
<P>
He will say it is in remote Santa Barbara County. And he will give a 
translation. 
</P>
<P>
"The Indians used to call it Gateway of Souls," he explained. "You get up 
there, and you see why. The most beautiful coastline, the most unspoiled water. 
. . . it's a world we don't live in anymore." 
</P>
<P>
It is in this Gateway of Souls that Flannery recovers his every winter. He 
leaves his job as a Padre infielder to spend a total of six weeks roaming the 
10 1/2 miles of coastline, living in a tent. There is fishing during the day, 
sitting by the fire and telling lies at night. 
</P>
<P>
But more than all that, there is surfing. It is the earthly thing Flannery 
loves more than anything but his family and blue-collar baseball. To hear his 
good friend and former big-leaguer Gary Woods tell it, it is something in which 
Flannery possesses magic. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a spot up there, one of the most beautiful spots on the coast, where 
Flannery loves to surf," Woods explained. "We call it Flann's Place, and every 
night as the sun is going down, he wants to go there. Sometimes the wind is not 
right, the water is not high, and it's worthless. But it doesn't matter to him. 
He'll sit there on the edge of the water and wait and persevere. Sometimes for 
as long as an hour, he will wait there. 
</P>
<P>
"And then all of a sudden, things will change. The wind will turn around, the 
waves will get big, and it will be some of the best surfing ever. It's like 
Flann has the magical touch." 
</P>
<P>
So it has happened for Flannery on the baseball field. He joined the Padre 
organization in 1978 as a graduate of Anaheim High and Chapman College who was 
too small, too slow and couldn't jump to save his shoelaces. 
</P>
<P>
In the 12 years since, he has yet to be a full-time, full-season starter. He 
has a .257 career average as a platoon player and bench jockey, including a 
.159 career average against left-handed pitchers, better than only one big 
leaguer in the past 14 years. He hasn't hit a homer since 1986 -- only two 
other big-leaguers have gone without a home run in more at-bats. And a couple 
of years ago, he suffered from a torn right ankle that still requires nightly 
icings and will never get better. 
</P>
<P>
Yet within the baseball world, he has waited and persevered and refused to 
leave. And today, that tide has turned. In his 10th major league season, there 
is no Padre who receives more standing ovations, more outward shows of respect 
than Tim Flannery. There may be no Padre in the club's 20-year history who has 
been more loved. 
</P>
<P>
Fans love it that he still plays. He still gets dirty. He still yells at 
opponents' pitchers and still slides on his nose. 
</P>
<P>
Fans love it that, unlike bigger Padre stars of the past, they can always count 
on him. He has hit more than .300 with runners on base in three of the past 
four seasons. That includes .304 last year, when he scored eight of 10 runners 
from third with fewer than two out. 
</P>
<P>
"The fans look at Flannery and say, 'If he can succeed, anything is 
attainable,' " Woods said. "They say, 'If he can play like this, than I can go 
home and be successful pounding my nails.' " 
</P>
<P>
Check it out April 3 at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. Flannery won't be in the 
starting lineup -- he has never started an opener -- but amid the applause for 
the Tony Gwynns and Jack Clarks, one ovation will stand out. If the past is any 
indication, the cheers for the introduction of Flannery may last a minute and 
seem like an hour. 
</P>
<P>
And if the past is any indication, Flannery may cry. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been tears in my eyes before, and I'm sure they will be there 
again," Flannery said. "The fact that I have been accepted here, I don't take 
that for granted. Not for one minute. Look at me, how can I take anything for 
granted?" 
</P>
<P>
With Tim Flannery having recently signed a one-year contract, and with top 
young infielders sprouting from all levels of the Padre organization, one 
question is sure to be asked of him all summer. 
</P>
<P>
Is this his last? 
</P>
<P>
"Hard for me to answer that," said Flannery, who will be 32 by the season's 
end. "The way I've figured it, every summer has been my last summer." 
</P>
<P>
But if he does retire? 
</P>
<P>
"This much I promise you: I'm buying season tickets over the dugout and giving 
our players hell," he said. "I've told guys on the team, when they hear some 
beer-drinking loudmouth yelling at them to hustle, look up there. It's going to 
be me." 
</P>
<P>
That's OK, because most of them would listen. Even the most narrow-visioned of 
them could not miss the war that Flannery won last year with hustle, a victory 
over time and logic, one that ensured he would not be in those box seats this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Flannery's long-term guaranteed contract was up at the end of 1988. The Padres 
possessed an option, but as late as July 1 of last season, they weren't 
inclined to pick it up. Popularity and clubhouse chemistry is nice, but at the 
time, Flannery and his bad ankle had accounted for a .226 average and six RBIs. 
For the first time in his career, he had been reduced to strictly a 
pinch-hitting role, which he accepted by getting all of one hit in his first 15 
pinch plate appearances. 
</P>
<P>
His play-every-year-as-it-were-your-last line was no longer just a line. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden it was like, every at-bat was my last at-bat," Flannery said. 
"I thought there was a real chance that I was gone." 
</P>
<P>
As best he could, he returned to the surf. He called his surfing buddy Woods, a 
Santa Barbara native whose nine-year big-league outfielding career -- including 
stops in Toronto, Houston and with the Chicago Cubs -- ended in 1986. They 
talked about their great winters together. And they talked about the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"He called me and said he didn't know what to do," Woods recalled. "He told me 
he thought his back was finally to the wall." 
</P>
<P>
If his back wasn't precisely at the wall, Woods' advice pinned it there. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him his problem was easy, that he had two choices," Woods said. "I told 
him he could learn to pinch-hit well, regardless of the odds, or he could quit. 
Simple as that. Do it or quit. 
</P>
<P>
"I used the word 'quit' a lot. I knew that would get to him." 
</P>
<P>
Did it ever. Flannery proceeded to hit .296 in July and .355 in August. In his 
final 11 pinch appearances, he collected seven hits, including five consecutive 
at one time, tying a club record. He wound up as the National League's 
seventh-best pinch-hitter with a .308 average in 26 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
And that option year? It was picked up by the Padres in mid-September, ensuring 
Flannery one more season at $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
"He proved he is still an important member of this club," Manager Jack McKeon 
said. "The opportunity was there, and he went after it and got it." 
</P>
<P>
So what if $400,000 is not the major league average. Flannery has never made 
the major league average. For once, he and his friends said, the money wasn't 
the thing. 
</P>
<P>
"He looks at last year like the most important thing he's done in his career," 
said Dave Smith, Houston reliever and another surfing buddy. "He did the same 
thing he's had to do every spring -- make the team -- but did it during the 
heat of the season. That's not easy." 
</P>
<P>
Said Flannery: "I'm more proud of that than anything I've ever done 
individually. They didn't just bring me back because people like me. Baseball 
is a business, they wouldn't do that. I earned a spot. I earned this." 
</P>
<P>
Not that Flannery thinks the fans would accept anything less. That's what he 
likes about San Diego, and what he thinks some more ego-conscious players hate. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball players aren't that big of a deal to people in San Diego," Flannery 
said. "All they want is an honest day's work from them. They work eight hours a 
day, and they want the same attitude from you. 
</P>
<P>
"Some players have it tough here because fans don't worship them. People don't 
move to San Diego for the sports, they move because of the quality of life. 
They have their heads screwed on straight, they know what's important. 
Ballplayers aren't larger than life. Hard, honest work -- that's what's big." 
</P>
<P>
That and surfing, at least to Flannery. 
</P>
<P>
"If you ask me, that's a big part of Flannery's appeal," Woods said. "Like a 
large part of his audience down there, he's not afraid to take on the water." 
</P>
<P>
At dawn of an off-day last season, Randy Ready, Padre third baseman and novice 
surfer, was preparing to enter the ocean when he thought he spotted a seal in 
the dark water. Upon closer inspection, he was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just Flannery," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since Flannery bought his first board at age 13, he has been sold. His 
older brother, Greg, would drive him from Anaheim to the Leucadia beaches north 
of San Diego, but only after he pulled weeds. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad thought I was becoming a hippie, so he made me pull weeds every time I 
surfed to make sure I stayed straight," Flannery said of his father, a preacher 
at the First Christian Church of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Today, although his activities have been somewhat slowed by a 
no-responsibility-for-surfing-accidents clause in his contract, Flannery still 
looks and acts every bit the surfer. His blonde hair is thinning, but his tan 
is still dark, and his voice still speaks in reverent tones about "The 
landlord." 
</P>
<P>
"You know, the great white shark," Flannery explains. "Out there, he's the 
landlord." 
</P>
<P>
Flannery doesn't surf under the Huntington Beach Pier at midnight anymore, but 
"I still surf when necessary," he said. 
</P>
<P>
This means whenever he is tense. Whenever he is worried about life's little 
things. Whenever he wants to be reminded of both his good fortune and 
fragility. 
</P>
<P>
"Flann likes surfing because it can humble you," Smith said. "In a second, it 
can humble you." 
</P>
<P>
Said Flannery: "You have to approach surfing like you approach pinch-hitting -- 
you go all out and accept that fact that the result will be either outhouse or 
castle. Either you'll be great or terrible. But at least you won't have 
hesitated." 
</P>
<P>
"Flann attacks the water," Ready said. "Some guys go out there to paddle around 
and talk, but Flann works it hard." 
</P>
<P>
Although Flannery has never been injured surfing, once off the San Clemente 
coast he was taken under the water by a current for what he figures was a full 
minute, for what he thought were his last moments on earth. 
</P>
<P>
"When I finally came up, I got out of the water, put my board on my car, drove 
away and didn't surf for three weeks," Flannery recalled. "But I came back." 
</P>
<P>
Just as he always does. Just as he will keep doing for at least one more year. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell you right now, if I retire, there will be no big deal made," Flannery 
said with a laugh. "The fans don't owe me anything. Tell them I've had a great, 
great, great time here. Tell them, hey, it's been fun, I'll see them in the 
water." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' Sunday workout, contrary to what may have been implied from 
previous reports, is not open to the public. San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium will 
still be undergoing preparations for Monday's opening night against San 
Francisco. . . . Opening night starter Eric Show pitched his final spring 
innings Wednesday, allowing the Angels two runs on five hits in five innings, 
en route to an eventual 6-5 Padre victory. The only thing even mildly 
disturbing was his four walks. In his 29 2/3 spring innings, he has walked 15, 
just one less than his 16 strikeouts. This works out to 4.5 walks per nine 
innings after he allowed just two walks per nine innings last season. "I'm not 
worried about my control, you don't do what I did all of last season and then 
just lose it," said Show, who finished his spring with a 3.95 ERA. "My stuff 
has been good, and that's what's important. When you lose your stuff, it 
becomes a lot more mysterious." Show said that after pitching three opening 
days, this one won't have him quite so worried. "I might start thinking about 
it, well, when I arrive at the ballpark," he said of Monday's 7:20 p.m. game 
against the San Francisco Giants and Rick Reuschel. "I'll be excited but, you 
know, I've done this before." . . . After the Padres took a 4-2 lead in the top 
of sixth Wednesday following Show's departure, reliever Mark Grant promptly 
blew that lead by allowing two runs in two innings. The Padres finally won it 
for good with two runs in the eighth on back-to-back RBI doubles by Roberto 
Alomar and Luis Salazar, who played center and right fields, his fourth and 
fifth different positions in four days since joining the Padres from the 
Detroit Tigers Sunday (shortstop, third base and left field were the other 
three). . . . After Wednesday's game, the Padres departed Palm Springs for San 
Diego, where they will play their sixth annual game against San Diego State 
tonight at 7:05 at Jack Murphy. They will wind up their spring schedule with 
weekend games in Las Vegas, against the Seattle Mariners (Friday) and the 
Padres triple-A affiliate Las Vegas team (Saturday) . . . Catcher Benito 
Santiago gave the Padres a bit of a scare Wednesday when his hand collided with 
Wally Joyner's bat on a throw to second. But afterward, Santiago was lifting 
weights in the clubhouse and smiling. "Everything is fine, everything this 
spring has been fine," Santiago said. He probably will finish the spring as the 
club's leading hitter. He went two for three Wednesday to improve his average 
to .426. . . . There were a couple of firsts Wednesday -- Tony Gwynn struck out 
for the first time this spring after 59 at-bats (against Angel rookie pitcher 
Jim Abbott) while second baseman Alomar committed his first error of the 
spring. The left side of the Padre infield, on the other hand, has committed 
21. . . . Remember pitcher Mark Davis' two holes-in-one on golf courses this 
spring? Wednesday morning, fewer than 24 hours after his latest ace, Davis shot 
a 16 on one hole.

WAVES HOT AND COLD IN BIG GAMES; 
</P>
<P>
BUT FOUR RETURNING STANDOUTS LOOK TO TURN UP THE HEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Pepperdine's play in the last two basketball games of the season -- against New 
Mexico State and then the University of New Mexico in National Invitation 
Tournament road games -- mirrored the way the team often performed in big 
games. 
</P>
<P>
But the reflected images were sharply different. 
</P>
<P>
In probably their best game of the year, the Waves easily defeated New Mexico 
State, 84-69, in the first round of the NIT. 
</P>
<P>
Against the Aggies, they jumped out to a 7-0 lead, shared the ball and received 
balanced scoring from the regulars. They shot well (57%), controlled the tempo 
against a tough defense, extended their lead to 72-43 with 3:41 remaining and 
coasted home. 
</P>
<P>
In a second-round 86-69 loss to New Mexico, Pepperdine's performance was 
similar to that of the first-round game -- but in reverse. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves fell behind, 15-5, played as individuals rather than as a team, and a 
couple of players wound up doing much of the scoring. Pepperdine shot poorly 
(37.7%), was controlled by a strong defense, fell behind by as many as 17 
points late in the game and never got untracked. 
</P>
<P>
There were games, of course, that fit neither of those patterns -- games in 
which neither Pepperdine nor its opponent dominated from the outset. But there 
were at least five other contests against top opposition in which the Waves 
took charge early and five more against quality teams in which Pepperdine was 
led around by the nose. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine dictated what went on in road wins over UC Irvine and Marshall and 
in home victories over Santa Clara, the University of San Francisco and Loyola 
Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves also were easy pickings in losses at Nevada Las Vegas, Loyola 
Marymount, St. Mary's and Santa Clara and in a defeat at home by North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
But it still turned out to be Pepperdine's best season since Coach Jim 
Harrick's 1985-86 Waves finished with a 25-5 record. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988-89 Waves were 20-13, tied Loyola Marymount for second place in the 
West Coast Athletic Conference and were 1-1 in the conference tournament. 
</P>
<P>
In the NIT they won their first postseason game since Harrick's 1982 team 
defeated Pittsburgh, 99-88, in the first round of the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine was one of four WCAC teams to finish with 20 victories or more, the 
first time that happened in conference history. The other three were St. Mary's 
(25-5), Loyola Marymount (20-11) and Santa Clara (20-11), and all four won 
berths in postseason play, another conference first. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves accomplished all that under a head coach in his first year, Tom 
Asbury, who succeeded Harrick after he was named UCLA's coach. Asbury, 
Harrick's top assistant at Pepperdine for nine years, also installed a new 
offense, going from a high-post to a low-post attack. 
</P>
<P>
The change from a familiar offensive set may have caused difficulties for a few 
players, at least during the early part of the season, but Asbury said the 
change was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no way we could have run the same offense we had in the past and 
still have been productive," he said. "If we hadn't, we couldn't have played 
(senior center Casey) Crawford and (freshman forward-center Geoff) Lear at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
In explaining the switch before the season, Asbury said: 
</P>
<P>
"When guys like Crawford play the high post, they have difficulty being a force 
offensively because all they are are catchers and passers. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to get our big guys closer to the basket to do the things they are 
physically more capable of doing. Most big men have difficulty scoring from 15 
or 16 feet and (in a low-post offense) they should also increase their 
rebounding because they'll be closer." 
</P>
<P>
The new offense seemed to work for Crawford and Lear. 
</P>
<P>
After averaging five points and 5.5 rebounds as an occasional starter last 
year, Crawford led the team in rebounding as a regular this season with a 7.5 
average and averaged eight points a game. He also led the team with 43 blocked 
shots and was dominating inside in several games. 
</P>
<P>
Lear, who played more than 19 minutes a game, averaged five points and nearly 
five rebounds -- not bad production for a freshman who saw limited playing 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Asbury said that if someone had told him before the season that the Waves would 
do as well as they did "I would have taken it. By the same token, there were a 
number of games I would like to have had back too." 
</P>
<P>
He said that "no coach is ever fully satisfied unless his team goes 31-0," but 
added that his team's losses were not to patsies. Of the teams that defeated 
the Waves, only Montana State and USF did not win 20 games or more, he noted. 
Montana State won by three points in Pepperdine's second game of the season, 
and USF edged the Waves by one point at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"We probably didn't shoot the ball (as well) as we had hoped," Asbury added. 
The Waves shot 45.7%, compared to 51.5% last season. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting percentages of Asbury's three junior starters also dropped. 
Forward Tom Lewis went from 49.5% to 42.2%, guard Craig Davis from 49.3% to 
42.3%, and forward Dexter Howard, after a hot streak in the early going, from 
53.4% to 49.6%. 
</P>
<P>
"People figure out ways to stop your high scorers in league -- and not only in 
league," Asbury said. "My goal was to balance the scoring out anyway; I wasn't 
interested in Lewis leading the nation in scoring." 
</P>
<P>
Asbury got the balance he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, after leading the conference in scoring with 23 points a game last year, 
averaged a team-high 16.2 points this season. Howard averaged 15.9, Davis 12.5 
and Shann Ferch 10.2. Junior Ferch is the heir apparent to senior point guard 
Marty Wilson, the only other starter besides Crawford that Asbury will lose. 
</P>
<P>
Asbury said that he is "not a big preseason prognosticator" and would say only 
that "we are going to be decent" next year. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, Howard, Davis and Ferch will probably start, and eventually so will 
6-10, 250-pound center Mark Georgeson, the transfer from Arizona who has 2 1/2 
seasons of eligibility remaining. But Georgeson probably won't play his first 
game for Pepperdine until sometime next January because he transferred in the 
middle of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Asbury also said that Georgeson suffered a stress fracture of a small bone in 
his right foot in practice, for which he may need surgery. Even if the center 
has surgery, he said, he should be ready by January. 
</P>
<P>
Until Georgeson is ready, 6-9 sophomore Damon Braly and 6-8 David Hairston will 
probably take up some of the slack for him. 
</P>
<P>
Asbury said that Georgeson is a "better offensive player" than Crawford. "He is 
a good shooter and passer, and handles the ball well for a big guy. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark doesn't have Casey's speed, quickness or shot-blocking and jumping 
ability. But I think he's going to be a real solid player." 
</P>
<P>
He also expects solid play from redshirt forwards Steve Guild, a freshman, and 
Rex Manu, a junior, and from freshman guard Doug Christie, who was academically 
ineligible this season under Proposition 48. He said another good addition 
should be 6-9 forward Derek Noether, a senior at Clovis West High School in 
Fresno who signed an early letter of intent. Freshman Rick Welch, who played 
well, if briefly, this season, should push Ferch at point guard, and there is a 
high school point guard in Glendale, Ariz., that Asbury would like to see in a 
Pepperdine uniform next season. 
</P>
<P>
Asbury said he is in what looks like a race with Arizona State and Texas El 
Paso to sign 5-9 Damon Lopez, who played for his father at Apollo High School. 
</P>
<P>
He said Lopez is "a true point guard who can run the offense" and "really shoot 
the ball."

HAWTHORNE STEALS AND SLUGS TO 13-5 TRIUMPH OVER PV IN BAY OPENER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
There are sprinters around every corner at Hawthorne High School, but they 
aren't the sole commodities of the football and track teams anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Now the baseball team is getting into the act. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday afternoon, the Cougars stole six bases and banged out 12 hits en 
route to a 13-5 victory over visiting Palos Verdes in both teams' Bay League 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
"We had our rabbits running out there today," said Hawthorne Coach Lester 
Sakurai. "As long as we get on, we're gonna run and run until the catcher 
throws us out." 
</P>
<P>
Sakurai, who coached Mira Costa last year, has installed an aggressive, 
hard-running offense. His approach has worked. The speedy Cougars (5-3 overall, 
1-0 in the Bay League) have succeeded on 31 of 36 base-stealing attempts. 
</P>
<P>
The master thief for Hawthorne has been shortstop Kenny Alexander, who has yet 
to be caught in his senior season. Wednesday, Alexander walked four times, 
singled and stole his ninth base of the year -- even though Palos Verdes 
left-hander Jason Goldberg pitched out against him. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars got a complete game out of pitcher Steve Keith. The slender junior 
left-hander struck out a season-high eight and scattered eight hits on the way 
to his fourth win in as many starts. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes' Goldberg's control vanished in the fourth inning when he walked 
five. Hawthorne manufactured eight runs on only three hits in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Keith sailed right along. The only stain on his performance was the three-run 
homer he served up in the third to Palos Verdes catcher Mike Hoye. Hoye's 
opposite-field shot easily cleared the 370-foot sign in left-center. 
</P>
<P>
But Keith didn't let Hoye's blast shake him. He notched back-to-back strikeouts 
of Hoye and Spuds Powell -- Palos Verdes' best hitters -- to escape a jam two 
innings later. 
</P>
<P>
Left fielder Mando Fernandez (3 for 4, three steals, two runs batted in) led 
the Cougars. Rich Peters went 2 for 2 and had two RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez and teammate Teddy Golden have swiped seven bases apiece this year. 
And center fielder Maurice L'Allemand has stolen six. So don't expect Sakurai 
to abandon his philosophy soon. 
</P>
<P>
"We might have run a bit too much today," Sakurai said. "But we're learning how 
to work together on hit-and-run combinations and stealing." 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne and Palos Verdes (4-4, 0-1) meet again Friday at 3 p.m. at Palos 
Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger 7, Inglewood 1 -- Senior left-hander Tyrone Scott pitched a 
one-hitter and struck out a career-high 16 batters to power the Olympians in a 
Bay League opener at Sentinel Field in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, who walked five, improved to 4-1 and helped Leuzinger (8-2-1 overall) to 
its sixth straight win. Inglewood's run was unearned. Thomas Gordon went 3 for 
4 with two RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills 11, Beverly Hills 4 -- Greg Schwartz drove in five runs and Shaun 
Carpenter collected two RBIs to lead the Titans in a Bay League opener at 
Rolling Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans (5-5 overall) broke open a close game with four runs in the fourth 
inning, highlighted by Schwartz's two-run double. They added five runs in the 
fifth. Carpenter went 3 for 4 and Schwartz was 2 for 4 as Rolling Hills 
collected 11 hits. 
</P>
<P>
Right-hander Dan Block (3-1) relieved starter Ron Campbell in the fourth inning 
and gave up three hits and one run. He struck out six. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance 14, Santa Monica 11 -- The Tartars rallied from an 11-3 deficit and 
pulled out a Bay League victory with three unearned runs in the seventh inning 
at Santa Monica. Torrance (2-5 overall) scored on two errors and a sacrifice 
fly to break an 11-11 tie. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Kendall went 2 for 4 with two RBIs and shut out Santa Monica in the sixth 
and seventh to earn the win in relief. Howie Kingsmill and Antone Williamson 
were each 2 for 5 with two RBIs and three runs scored for Torrance, which had 
fallen behind by eight runs after five innings. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa 9, West Torrance 8 -- The Mustangs, taking advantage of four West 
errors and four walks, rallied for nine runs in the bottom of the seventh to 
post a victory in an Ocean League opener at Mira Costa. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 8-0, the Mustangs (5-3 overall) sent 13 batters to the plate in the 
seventh against West (1-7). Bobby Dominguez, who had a two-run double early in 
the rally, ended the game when his two-out grounder went past the third baseman 
for an error, allowing Scott Yetter and Scott Earnest to score from second and 
first. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo 8, South Torrance 4 -- Ian Martin homered and pitcher Mike Houck picked 
up his fourth win without a loss as the Sea Hawks cruised in an Ocean League 
opener at South. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, who hit a solo shot in the second inning, his second homer of the year, 
went 2 for 4 with two RBIs. Brian Davison and Robbie Zeller collected two hits 
each for Redondo (5-4 overall), which built an 8-2 lead through six innings. 
Houck, a senior right-hander, gave up four runs (three earned) through six 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
North Torrance 8, Morningside 4 -- Brian Dessert had three hits, four RBIs, 
three runs scored and three stolen bases to help the Saxons (2-5-1) to their 
second straight victory in an Ocean League opener at Morningside. North 
finished with 10 hits and nine steals.

NORTHRIDGE UPSTAGES USC IN A SIDESHOW, 4-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The parking lots that surround Dedeaux Field on the USC campus were jammed 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Limousines, hundreds of them, lined up side by side awaiting Academy 
Awards-goers who would be exiting from the nearby Shrine Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
While the awards show unfolded down the street, many members of the tuxedo-clad 
chauffeur force lined the edge of the three-story parking structure beyond 
right field and watched Northridge pitcher Fili Martinez drive USC batters 
batty during Northridge's 4-2 nonconference victory over the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge improved to 14-9-1 overall while USC, ranked ninth in Division I by 
Baseball America, is 26-12. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez (2-3), a senior left-hander who has been victimized by bad luck for 
much of the season, pitched a complete game, scattering five hits and striking 
out seven. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to be too fine," said Martinez, who walked five. "So I just tried 
to let it go and it worked out great." 
</P>
<P>
CSUN scored two runs in the second inning when Rusty McLain scored from third 
on a passed ball and Greg Shockey drove in Denny Vigo with a ground out to 
first. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors went ahead, 3-0, in the third inning on Chae-Ho Chong's sacrifice 
fly to center field that drove in Mike Solar. 
</P>
<P>
USC scored a run in the third on a passed ball and in the sixth when Martinez 
hit Kevin Farlow with a pitch with the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
McLain, a senior, hit his second home run of the season in the sixth inning, a 
solo shot over the left-field wall that provided the final margin of victory. 
</P>
<P>
"The team is maturing with the seniors leading the way a little bit," McLain 
said. "Everybody is helping each other out." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the clutch performances by seniors such as Martinez and McLain, the 
key, but wholly unspectacular play of the game, was turned in by freshman 
center fielder Shockey in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 4-2, USC had runners on first and second after Martinez issued 
consecutive walks to Corey Aurand and Bret Boone to lead off the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Brett Jenkins followed with a fly ball to center that Shockey caught for an out 
while the runners tagged. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the season, Shockey might have thrown to third base. This time, he 
threw to second to keep the double play in order and ended up nailing Boone to 
complete a double play, stalling a Trojan threat that Martinez ended by 
striking out Mark Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Shockey's decision showed a sign of maturity that pleased Northridge Coach Bill 
Kernen as much as the victory itself. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the type of play that never shows up in the box score," Kernen said. "But 
it was key tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a step for the program that means something to me." 
</P>

CSUN BEGINS WORKOUTS SET AT QUARTERBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What is a spring football practice without a quarterback controversy to add 
spice to an otherwise drab series of drills? 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge, which started workouts Wednesday at North Campus Stadium, 
is going to find out. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in four years, the Matadors are absolutely, positively 
beyond-a-shadow-of-a-doubt sure who will line up behind center to take the 
first snap of the season Sept. 2 at Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
It will be Sherdrick (pronounced Cedric) Bonner, an interesting, if not 
unexpected, choice. 
</P>
<P>
This marks the first time Bonner, a 6-foot-3, 185-pound junior, has been listed 
No. 1 on the depth chart at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Ever. 
</P>
<P>
The past two seasons he was a seldom-used understudy to Rob Huffman. Before 
that, he redshirted a season. And before that, he had a grand total of three 
games' experience at the quarterback position while playing for Azusa High. 
</P>
<P>
So why is it that Coach Bob Burt is so confident. 
</P>
<P>
Because he has seen Bonner run, jump, throw and jitterbug around a football 
field enough to know that an abundance of athletic ability likely will counter 
any lack of experience. 
</P>
<P>
For two years, Burt has referred to his string bean second-stringer as "the 
franchise" while favorably comparing him to a young Randall Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
There is no question that Bonner has the tools for his trade. As an all-around 
athlete, he has no peer on the CSUN team. Bonner, who has completed 43 of 77 
passes for 584 yards and five touchdowns in two seasons, leaped 6-10 in the 
high jump in high school and two years ago was a top reserve on the Matador 
basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a lot of competition at quarterback in the past, but at this point 
we don't anticipate him being threatened for the job," Burt said of Bonner. 
</P>
<P>
The quarterback's supporting cast is headed by tailback Albert Fann, a two-time 
All-Western Football Conference selection. Fann, a 6-2, 220-pound junior who 
has gained 1,795 yards in his CSUN career, will be running behind an offensive 
line that is expected to have five returning starters. 
</P>
<P>
Fullback and wide receiver are the positions with question marks. Russell 
Jenkins, Cornell Ward, Don Martin and Larnell Sykes are the top contenders at 
receiver. The starting fullback probably will be either Oscar Pittman, a 5-11, 
210-pound transfer from San Jose City College; Jason Ferguson, a converted 
tailback; or Tim Beattie, a reserve last season. 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, eight starters return for the Matadors, but only one is a lineman 
-- 6-5, 255-pound Mike Meehan. John Eichinger, a 6-4, 225-pound junior, is 
expected to make an impact at outside linebacker. He transferred from Oregon 
where he earned playing time as a freshman in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"We have talent," said Burt, who is beginning his fourth season. "I feel 
optimistic -- I always do. But I feel better about this group than I did last 
year. Their off-season program has been as good as any since we've been here." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge will visit Cal State Fullerton after the opener at Long Beach, 
marking the first time the Matadors will have faced Division I opponents in 
consecutive games.

OCCIDENTAL TRIO RETURNS FROM LSU SPINNING TALES ABOUT A WILD TIGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chris Anderson, Tony Berlin and Jason Greenstein -- all members of the 
Occidental College basketball team -- and friend Marc Monasch spent their 
spring vacation in the South and brought a ball and high-tops along. 
</P>
<P>
A favorite hangout was the field house on the campus of Louisiana State 
University. The four formed the core of a five-on-five team that had a monopoly 
on court time. 
</P>
<P>
Their dominance was jeopardized, however, when Chris Jackson, LSU's 
All-American freshman, entered the arena and joined the opposing team. 
</P>
<P>
Greenstein, a 5-foot-8 guard, took on Jackson, a 6-2 guard who averaged 30.2 
points a game for the LSU this season. According to the Occidental players, the 
two played to a standoff. 
</P>
<P>
"They couldn't stop each other," Anderson said, pausing. "Of course, Greenstein 
is playing the game of his life and Jackson's probably going at 50%." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who is 6-foot-10, said that he, too, had no trouble scoring against 
Jackson. "He was just another small guy trying to block my shot," Anderson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Just another small guy? 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson is the top freshman scorer in NCAA history. There had to be another 
side of the story. What about when Anderson tried to guard Jackson? 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing I could do," Anderson said. "He'd get the ball, go right by 
and dunk on me." 
</P>
<P>
Setbacks galore: Great things were predicted for this year's edition of the 
Pierce College men's tennis team, a squad Coach Paul Xanthos said might be his 
strongest ever. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the Brahmas have won or shared conference championships every year 
since 1976, that's saying something. 
</P>
<P>
But such lofty goals might have taken a precipitous fall. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Oliver, the top-ranked JC player in the state, was suspended from the 
team earlier this month for disciplinary reasons. Then, on the day Oliver was 
supposed to meet with Xanthos to discuss his return, he showed up with his knee 
in a full-length brace. He suffered a serious injury while on a skiing trip and 
is out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Sudantha Soysa, the top junior player from Sri Lanka, was next to fall. He is 
at least temporarily ineligible while awaiting funds to pay tuition for the 
spring semester. Soysa is not allowed to work according to the terms of his 
visa so he depends on money sent from Sri Lanka by his family. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, Xanthos said, is the family is experiencing difficulty shipping 
the money out of Sri Lanka because of government restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't lose players like those two and expect to compete against the big 
schools," Xanthos said. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce started the week ranked third in the state with an 8-0 record, but the 
Brahmas dropped a 7-2 decision to Moorpark College in a Western State 
Conference match Tuesday. It was only the fourth conference match Pierce has 
lost in 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
Memorial fund: The parents of Jeff Blank, a Valley College football player who 
died last August in an automobile accident, have established a $10,000 
scholarship that will be awarded to a needy sophomore football player. 
</P>
<P>
Valley Coach Chuck Ferrero, who will select the recipient, said that the funds 
will be awarded to a Monarch player who does not receive an athletic 
scholarship but still chooses to continue his education. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's something he would have wanted," said Steve Blank, Jeff's father. 
"We decided to do it in his honor." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Blank was a starting wide receiver for the Monarchs as a freshman in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Little tower of power: Brenda Frafjord does not look like a power hitter, yet 
the 5-foot-5 freshman is quickly gaining a reputation as a heavy hitter for the 
Cal Lutheran softball team. 
</P>
<P>
Frafjord became the first Cal Lutheran player to hit a ball out of Gibello 
Field when she powered one over the left-field fence last week in a 
nonconference game against Concordia College of St. Paul, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
It was Frafjord's third home run of the season, but Coach Wendy 
Olson-Beckemeyer still puts the reserve second baseman ninth in the batting 
order. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking at her, nobody would expect that she could hit it over the fence," 
Beckemeyer said. "Nobody would look at her and say, 'Gee, I had better back 
up.' " 
</P>
<P>
They might if they knew she was batting .563 with 11 runs batted in and 15 runs 
scored in 20 games. 
</P>
<P>
History repeats: It was no surprise that Cal State Northridge and Pepperdine 
split their two baseball games this season. The schools have played 38 games 
through the years with each team winning 18. There were two ties. 
</P>
<P>
Both games this season were decided by one run. Northridge won, 5-4, last month 
and Pepperdine won, 6-5, on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Los Angeles, Northridge's opponent Saturday at 1 p.m. at Matador 
Field, is another school that historically has played CSUN to a standoff. 
</P>
<P>
The California Collegiate Athletic Assn. rivals have played 74 games and 
Northridge has won 43 compared to CSLA's 39. There have been two ties. CSUN 
swept the Golden Eagles in a two-game series last month, 8-6 and 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
Running it up: Pitcher Mike Clark, who is 2-1 for Cal Lutheran, is enjoying 
offensive support for the first time in two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The junior right-hander was 4-6 for Pierce College last season, but in the 
games he lost the Brahmas scored a total of only seven runs. 
</P>
<P>
Starting time: Jay Anderson has emerged as Cal Lutheran's top starting pitcher 
after spending most of the past three seasons in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
The senior right-hander has won five consecutive games, including a four-hit 
shutout of Point Loma Nazarene on Monday.

FOR PADRE MCKEON, TONIGHT THERE'S A CATCH; 
</P>
<P>
DON'T BE UPSET IF YOU SEE HIM ROOTING FOR THE AZTECS -- THAT'S SON KASEY AT THE 
BAT

<P>
Look into the home dugout tonight when the Padres play San Diego State in their 
annual exhibition game at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, and you might see 
Manager Jack McKeon showing delight in a hit off Bruce Hurst. 
</P>
<P>
There might be a similar reaction if Tony Gwynn is thrown out trying to steal, 
or if Jack Clark is set up and set down on a mediocre pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Before you doubt McKeon's loyalty to his team, look first to see who is 
rounding first base or picking up his face mask after a perfect throw to second 
or tossing the ball around the horn after a strikeout. 
</P>
<P>
It could be Jack's son, Kasey McKeon, a senior catcher enjoying his last and 
finest season for the Aztecs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to it," Kasey said. "It's going to be great because he's 
on the field this year. He's going to be in uniform with me, I mean, against 
me." 
</P>
<P>
As a youngster, Kasey remembers his father moving from Omaha to Kansas City to 
Richmond to Oakland to Denver, plus every winter in Puerto Rico. While Jack 
moved where work took him, the McKeon family lived in Burlington, N.C. Jack 
didn't get to see Kasey play baseball very often. 
</P>
<P>
Even after the family moved to San Diego in 1981, and Kasey became an 
all-league player at Patrick Henry, Jack usually was too busy to watch more 
than a few games a season. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, Jack McKeon can be both a Padre and a padre. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be fun," he said. "I don't get a chance to see him play that much." 
</P>
<P>
As a player in the 1950s, Jack was a minor league catcher, as was his brother, 
Bill. Is it any wonder then that Kasey wears "the tools?" 
</P>
<P>
Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Kasey, 21, grew up playing infield and was a second baseman for three seasons 
at SDSU until last year. Before a summer tour of the Northwest, SDSU Coach Jim 
Dietz out of necessity asked team members who could catch. Kasey volunteered, 
and he might as well have thrown away his infielder's glove then. He has been a 
catcher since. 
</P>
<P>
And "he's more than just adequate," Dietz said. "He's pretty darn good. 
</P>
<P>
"I really think he's one of the best catchers I've seen this year. Other teams 
come in, and they remember him as a second baseman with an average arm, and 
they always try to run on him. He throws out most of them. 
</P>
<P>
"(The change has) really helped us as a team. It's given us something we didn't 
expect. It's really given him a chance to excel." 
</P>
<P>
He has excelled, but not without Jack's help at home in the back yard, the den 
-- and the kitchen. The kitchen? 
</P>
<P>
"Right during dinner," Kasey said. "He'd sit me down and tell me my butt's too 
high. He got me to slow down a little. I was trying to be too quick." 
</P>
<P>
Said Jack, "He caught on real fast. At first, I didn't like some of his 
mechanics, so I worked with him a little. 
</P>
<P>
"When I watched him play against Florida International, I couldn't believe it 
was Kasey. He looked like he'd been catching all his life. I was very impressed 
with him, and not because he's my son. 
</P>
<P>
"When he got home that night, my wife told him, 'You don't get too many 
compliments around here. You better sit down and enjoy this one.' " 
</P>
<P>
Kasey has enjoyed the move behind the plate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's given me a different angle, a different view of the game," he said. "You 
keep in the game more. You get to keep the pitchers in the game more. You keep 
everybody in the game." 
</P>
<P>
It might keep Kasey in the game, in a professional career. 
</P>
<P>
As a second baseman, Kasey was a good fielder with average range who hit .283 
in three seasons. According to Dietz and professional scouts, he was not a 
prospect. 
</P>
<P>
But as a catcher, Dietz said, "I'm positive Kasey's going to play the game 
professionally. And some day when he isn't playing, he'll make an outstanding 
coach or front-office guy. He has a fair idea of what's going on because he's 
been around the game so much." 
</P>
<P>
Jack agrees. "I think he'll do well. I think he's got enough on the ball to be 
successful in those areas. He's a very intelligent kid as far as baseball 
goes." 
</P>
<P>
Said Kasey, "I know some way I'll work my way up. It's in my blood. If I don't 
succeed in the minors, I'll know I'll have given it my best shot." 
</P>
<P>
When Kasey left high school, it was that attitude and a hustle-to-the-end style 
that prompted Dietz to recruit him. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew he was going to be a plus. He was a hustler," Dietz said. "He was one 
of the best recruits I've ever made just because of the kind of person he is. 
It's been a joy to see a kid through hard work and determination do well and 
really turn it around." 
</P>
<P>
Another plus is that he is a switch-hitter with a .280 average (fourth on the 
team) and has decent speed. He has stolen four bases out of six attempts this 
season and 24 of 32 in his career at SDSU. 
</P>
<P>
"When I played," Jack said, "I was a good catcher, but I hit three ways; right, 
left and seldom. He's a better hitter than I was." 
</P>
<P>
A natural right-hander, Kasey probably is a better hitter from the left side, 
and Dietz uses him more against right-handed pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
Which brings us to a certain right-hander on the Padre staff -- Greg Booker, 
Kasey's brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
"I really want to face Book," Kasey said. "I told him if it happened, I'm 
sending a line drive right back at him." 
</P>
<P>
Kasey gave Goose Gossage the same message in 1987 but never got the chance to 
deliver. The game was called in the second inning because of rain. But before 
it was cancelled, Kasey managed a single off Jimmy Jones. He then stole second, 
went to third on a fielder's choice and was thrown out at the plate trying to 
complete a double steal. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, an 8-0 Padre victory, Kasey said, "(Craig) Lefferts punched me out on 
a couple of screwgies." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Andy Hawkins got Kasey to pop to short in a 9-1 Padre victory. 
</P>
<P>
This will be the seventh meeting between the teams, and the McKeons are not the 
only family to have been represented on both sides. The Gwynn brothers, Tony 
and Chris, played against each other in 1984 and '85. 
</P>
<P>
In '84, the Padres won, 6-1, with Chris' homer accounting for the Aztecs' only 
run. The next year, Tony defeated Chris in a home-run hitting contest before 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's game at 7:05 is free for those who pick up tickets at area 
Jack-in-the-Box restaurants. Admission at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium is 
otherwise $1.50, with proceeds going to the San Diego Leukemia Society and 
SDSU's baseball program. . . . Bruce Hurst will be making his San Diego debut 
as a starting pitcher for the Padres. SDSU will counter with left-hander Rick 
Navarro, a 1988 graduate of Helix High. SDSU is 17-12, 2-2 in the Western 
Athletic Conference, and plays doubleheaders Saturday and Sunday against 
Wyoming (13-7, 3-1) at Smith Field.

SCOTT HOPES WORK HABITS AGAIN WORTH CARLSBAD VICTORY

<P>
No one expects to hear that Steve Scott -- who owns the current world road best 
for 5,000 meters and is America's No. 1-rated miler -- lacks talent. 
</P>
<P>
It's just not an easily digested piece of information, what with Scott's 121 
miles under four minutes, eight under 3:50. 
</P>
<P>
But there was Scott telling a gathering of rehabilitation patients at 
Tri-Cities Hospital on Wednesday that he doesn't think he has as much talent or 
ability as his opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"The people I'm racing against are getting younger and younger every year," 
said Scott, 32. "I don't think I'm as talented as the other guys are, but I 
train harder than they do." 
</P>
<P>
Whether his edge is in training or talent, one way or the other, Scott has made 
some impressive runs. 
</P>
<P>
He holds American track records in the 1,500 meters, 2,000 meters, mile and 
3,000 meters. He broke his own world road best in the 5,000 meters at last 
year's Carlsbad 5,000, when he ran 13:30.2. 
</P>
<P>
Looks like flat-out ability, right? Well, Scott disagrees, and instead credits 
mental preparedness with his successes. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing I've had on my side in the past is coaches who are strong on the 
mental aspects (of running)," Scott said. "The people who are going to win the 
races are the ones who are strong mentally." 
</P>
<P>
Scott makes his point by pointing to his biggest failure. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, Scott ran the 1,500 meters but finished a 
disappointing 10th. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back on that performance, Scott said that he lost the race even before 
it started, when he began putting what-if questions through his mind. What if 
he didn't win? 
</P>
<P>
That self-doubt, Scott said, led to his poor finish. 
</P>
<P>
Scott no longer harbors self-doubt, but he is somewhat concerned about his 
chances of defending his title in Sunday's Carlsbad 5,000. What's bothering him 
is the fact that he has won the thing three years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be tough," Scott said. "Every year you win, it decreases your 
chances for the following year." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Scott seems to own the race. Besides finishing first for three 
consecutive years, he has also set two world bests. There are two possible 
obvious reasons for Scott's mastery of Carlsbad: He lives right down the road 
in Encinitas and he designed the course. 
</P>
<P>
"The race is probably more meaningful to me than to any other person because it 
is my home track," Scott said. "Plus, because I designed it and because a lot 
of people here would like to see me win, that's a tremendous advantage. In pro 
sports, teams always have more wins at home than they do on the road." 
</P>
<P>
But the race means more to Scott than merely an opportunity to run in front of 
a home-town crowd. Scott, who in the past has always been more readily 
identified as a miler than a 5,000 runner, is working toward a new goal for 
which the Carlsbad 5,000 will help gauge his progress. 
</P>
<P>
No longer will Scott be going after Olympic gold in the 1,500, as he did in 
1984 and again in 1988 (when he was fifth). He has decided instead to train for 
the 5,000 at the Barcelona Games. 
</P>
<P>
And perhaps this is where the mental edge will come in to play. Scott will be 
35 when the 1992 Olympics begin. Obviously, he will have to draw on something 
other than youthful exuberance. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not satisfied with staying stagnant," Scott said. "I have to make 
improvements, and it gets harder as you get older. . . . The hardest thing is 
the regimen, coming in and working out on a day-to-day basis. I know I have to 
improve each day, but still it's difficult because you don't see progress on a 
daily basis." 
</P>
<P>
So besides training physically, Scott trains his mind by visualizing upcoming 
races. He visualizes setting the pace, visualizes runners such as Kenya's 
Julius Kariuki keeping up, visualizes shifting into his kick in the latter 
stages of the race. Finally, he visualizes breaking the tape. 
</P>
<P>
"It's mind over matter," Scott said. "The mind is a powerful tool, and we 
haven't even begun to learn how to use it, but we can practice by visualizing."

AVOCADO LEAGUE BASEBALL PREVIEW;

<P>
SEVERAL TEAMS SEEM READY TO CHALLENGE DEFENDING CHAMPION CARLSBAD

<P>
Carlsbad High School has plunged from the elite to the mediocre. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the Lancers finished atop the Avocado League standings with a 13-1 
record (20-5 overall). So far this spring, they are 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
And while Carlsbad seems to be falling to the middle of the pack, other teams 
are displaying upward mobility. 
</P>
<P>
San Pasqual, Escondido, Oceanside and Rancho Buena Vista are poised to wrestle 
the title from Carlsbad -- and Ramona might not be far behind. 
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad 
</P>
<P>
Last season: 20-5, 13-1 league (first). 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Joe Pimentel. 
</P>
<P>
Top returners: Buck Taylor (senior, C); Scott Karl (senior, 1B); Jeff Myers 
(senior, 1B); Larry Griffith (senior, 2B); Bryan Black (junior, CF). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Bryan Vasey (sophomore, SS); Geoff Stadnyk (sophomore, OF/1B); 
Jeff Westbay (junior, P); Jeff Jarred (junior, 3B); Chris Greene (junior, RF). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Pimentel insists his team has yet to put together "back-to-back games 
in which we've played really well." The main problem, he says, is a lack of 
leadership. There is no one yet to fill the shoes of graduated shortstop Tim 
Granich (Loyola Marymount) and catcher Adrian Lopez (Palomar College). 
</P>
<P>
El Camino 
</P>
<P>
Last season: 5-18, 4-10 league (seventh). 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Adrian Leon. 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Ricky Spears (junior, C); Todd Swanson (senior, CF); Scott 
Hertweck (senior, P); Reggie Carter (senior, 3B/2B). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Bobby Wamble (junior, 1B); Fred Hernandez (junior, SS); Jerry 
Almada (sophomore, OF/3B). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Last year's 4-10 league mark might not look great, but it represented 
an about-face from 1987, when the Wildcats were winless. The Wildcats have won 
four of 11 so far this season. "I think we're vastly improved over what we were 
last year," Leon said. Hernandez moves from third to shortstop and will anchor 
the infield. Swanson, point guard for El Camino's basketball team, also will be 
a leader here; he has an average over .500. Spears has four home runs, all 
since being moved to leadoff. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido 
</P>
<P>
Last season: 15-11, 9-5 league (third). 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Bill Kutzner. 
</P>
<P>
Top returners: Tom Afenir (junior, C); Robert Erp (senior P); Gerald Cabral 
(senior, SS); Brian Frank (senior, 1B). 
</P>
<P>
Top Newcomers: Robert Chavez (junior, P); Bryan Klungsetter (junior, P); Mike 
Garcia (junior, P); Brent Reynolds (senior, P). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: If it's true that you can't have enough pitching, Escondido should win 
the section championship. Reynolds has an ERA of 1.50 in 20-plus innings. 
Garcia, pitching for the first time in two years, shut out Marian during Mike 
Morrow/Lions tournament play last week. Strong defense at two positions -- 
Cabral at shortstop and Afenir catching -- should help the pitching staff keep 
its ERA down. "That's where I like to begin my teams -- at catcher and at 
shortstop," Kutzner said. 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside 
</P>
<P>
Last season: 8-17, 3-11 (eighth, last). 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Dave Barrett. 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Fred Armijo (senior 3B); Angel Torres (junior, SS); Steve Larson 
(senior 2B); Rico Lopez (senior, DH/C). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Andrew Acevedo (junior, P); Saul Gutierrez (sophomore, P); Bill 
Precht (junior, P); Ben Pai (junior, P); Kenya Hunt (junior, P); Sibian 
Fuimaono (senior, DH). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Like Escondido, Oceanside is well-stocked with pitchers. Unlike 
Escondido, Oceanside does not have a senior pitcher. Hunt -- 6-feet-5 -- is the 
hardest thrower on the staff. Acevedo already has a 13-strikeout performance 
(against Temecula Valley). Precht is a relief specialist with a 1-0 record and 
two saves. Lopez should lead at the plate. He batted .350 in league last year, 
.450 in 1987 and is over .400 this spring. Fuimaono is batting over .350 and 
has two home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Ramona 
</P>
<P>
Last season: 10-13, 4-10 league (fifth). 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Giff Asimos. 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Chris Gunnett (senior, P/CF); Ty Wilson (senior, 1B); Jason 
Waite (senior, P). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Troy Wood (senior, 3B); Jason Gonzales (senior, 2B). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The Bulldogs are 5-3 under their first-year coach. Their offense has 
come from Wilson (three home runs), Wood (three homers), Dart (batting more 
than .500) and Gonzales (who has some base-stealing potential with 4.5 speed in 
the 40). Ramona scored in double figures in its first four games of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Buena Vista 
</P>
<P>
Last season: 8-17, 4-10 league (sixth). 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Steve Hargrave. 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Jon Robirds (senior, 1B/P); Robert McLeod (senior, P/LF); Lonny 
Maniscalco (senior, RF); Greg Anderson (senior, DH); Steve Valencia (junior, 
2B); Jason Schmeiser (junior, SS). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Kevin Lippert (junior, C); James Gore (sophomore, CF). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: After suffering through the growing pains of a first-year school a 
year ago, the Longhorns now have a wealth of experience. McLeod is the big 
star, 4-0 pitching and a top hitter. In the Eldorado tournament in Las Vegas 
last week, he went nine for 14 with two doubles, six runs and seven RBIs. Gore, 
a transfer from Washington, has been a pleasant surprise. He hit over .700 in 
the tournament and scored 12 runs in four games. And he's the No. 9 hitter. Key 
statistic: Last year, the Longhorns hit .208. So far this season, they're at 
.320. 
</P>
<P>
San Marcos 
</P>
<P>
Last season: 13-9, 8-6 league (fourth). 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Ron Layton. 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Gordon Sanchez (senior, C); Toby Lehman (senior P/OF). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Joe Balardeta (senior, DH/3B); Steve Kundringer (junior, OF/IF); 
Eric Morton (sophomore, 3B/1B). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Since returning from a shoulder injury, Sanchez has gone eight for 15 
with two home runs. Kundringer has been on base in his last nine at-bats. The 
pitching, sporadic thus far, must find itself if the Knights are to finish 
among the top four. 
</P>
<P>
San Pasqual 
</P>
<P>
Last season: 15-9, 11-3 league (second). 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Bill McAllister. 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Kevin Herde (senior, P/3B/C); Mike Escarcega (senior, P/3B); Jim 
Clayton (senior, SS). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Tony Medina (senior, C); Dave Vejtasa (junior, 1B); Eric Marsh 
(junior, LF); Tim Young (junior, P). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Escarcega tied a section record at the beginning of the season, 
hitting safely in 12 consecutive at-bats. Escondido's Andy Martin set the 
record three years ago as a sophomore. Thus far, Escarcega is 24 for 37 (.649). 
Herde, like Escarcega a top college prospect, is 14 for 36. As a team, the 
Eagles are batting .340. "That's a real pleasant surprise," McAllister said. 
"Because one question I had going into the season was whether or not we could 
hit the ball." The pitching, which McAllister had no questions about, has 
faltered somewhat. The Eagles have scored 57 runs in the past five games, but 
they have allowed 38.

In search of entertainment for the young guests at her 4-year-old son's 
birthday party, Ann Shapiro wanted something different. 
</P>
<P>
"I have an older daughter, so I've gone through all the clowns and different 
things. The kids don't always appreciate the clowns. I wanted something I knew 
he would really enjoy," Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
In L.A. Parent magazine, she saw an ad for the Lizard Lady -- Melanie Pickrell, 
36, of Van Nuys, who brings an entourage of snakes and lizards to children's 
parties -- and Shapiro knew she had found the perfect entertainment for her 
dinosaur-obsessed son. 
</P>
<P>
At the party, about 12 children sat enthralled for an hour as Pickrell showed 
them a 7 1/2-foot-long Burmese python, a Dumerils lizard, skinny brightly 
colored milk snakes, corn snakes, tortoises, a chameleon and other reptiles. 
</P>
<P>
"Chameleons are white when they are sick, green when they are relaxed, and 
green and black when they are nervous. Now watch as she changes colors," 
Pickrell, a part-time preschool teacher, instructed the children. The tiny 
triceratops-shaped creature's skin, initially a pure bright green, transformed 
into a black-and-green circular pattern. 
</P>
<P>
The children, crowding close to see and touch each reptile, oohed and aahed 
appreciatively at each new discovery. "They're beautiful!" birthday boy Michael 
cried in delight. 
</P>
<P>
Pickrell said her hourlong snake display, which costs $100, has elicited 
similar responses at each of the nearly 30O children's parties where she has 
performed since she began in August. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids love it," Pickrell said. "They don't have the preconceived ideas 
about snakes that we do. They love dinosaurs, and reptiles are like dinosaurs." 
</P>
<P>
Pickrell works part time at All Children Great and Small preschool in Los 
Feliz, where she came up with the idea for the Lizard Lady when she saw how 
much the youngsters loved studying reptiles. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Pickrell borrowed most of the animals for her show from Slither City, 
a Van Nuys pet shop specializing in snakes, lizards, bugs and other unusual 
pets. Eventually, she decided to buy her own because the store kept selling off 
her favorites. She has been known to borrow an occasional reptile at a client's 
request. 
</P>
<P>
Despite some parents' laughing speculation ("What would happen if she forgets 
something and leaves it in your house?"), Pickrell said the snakes are not a 
threat to the children. She has not had a snake bite nor had a snake slither 
out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Really Tame' 
</P>
<P>
"There is a difference between a tame animal and a wild animal, and these are 
really tame," Pickrell said. "Snakes don't bite to eat people, they bite to 
defend themselves, and these snakes know that people aren't going to hurt them. 
They are used to people feeding them, being around them." 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro said she was not concerned that some of her son's friends could have 
been afraid of the creatures, and she did not give advance warning on the 
invitations. 
</P>
<P>
"Younger kids have a lot of animals in their classrooms, so they are used to 
different animals," she said. "I didn't want to tell them too far in advance 
because then they might get wound up about it. I wanted to let it happen 
naturally and let them enjoy it."

MALIBU TILE IS FEAT OF CLAY; 
</P>
<P>
ARTIST HELPS REVIVE HAND-GLAZED CERAMICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Today Malibu means surf, sand and movie stars. Fifty years ago, it meant tile. 
</P>
<P>
From 1926 to 1932, Malibu Potteries, located right on the beach in Santa 
Monica, produced some of the most prized ceramic tile in the United States. 
Hand-glazed in colors a parrot might envy, the tiles were available in more 
than 1,000 designs, including lines called Moorish and Saracen that echoed the 
traditional Islamic patterns of Moorish Spain and the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Once a fixture of the finest facades, floors and soda foundations, Malibu tile 
is making a comeback. Described in a recent issue of Metropolitan Home magazine 
as "the most exquisitely wrought decorative tile this side of the Alhambra," 
Malibu tile has become eminently collectible, with single 6-inch squares 
commanding $200. 
</P>
<P>
It is also being reproduced by a handful of Southern California ceramists, 
including Richard Thomas Keit, who makes copies of the glowing tiles, as well 
as other designs, in a shop at his home in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Malibu tile's "visual festivity" is a major factor in its growing popularity, 
Keit said. It is especially attractive to Southern Californians "who are 
looking for something to feel culturally rooted in." 
</P>
<P>
Like many other Angelenos, Keit first experienced the vivid beauty of Malibu 
tile a decade ago at a show organized by collector David Greenberg at the Craft 
and Folk Art Museum in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"What really struck me was the richness of the color," said Keit, who was 
especially taken with pieces that featured swirling combinations of blue, red 
and turquoise. 
</P>
<P>
Keit, 32, has been fascinated with tile since he was a youngster. "We spent 
vacations on Catalina Island. As a teen-ager, I used to take rubbings of the 
old tiles there." Catalina had its own famous ceramics plant, but as Keit 
pointed out, Malibu tile was also used extensively on the island. 
</P>
<P>
Keit bought books on ceramics and taught himself to make and decorate tile. He 
mastered such traditional techniques as cuerda seca (dry rope), often used for 
Malibu tile, in which areas to be colored are first outlined with an oily 
material that keeps the glazes from running into each other. After firing, a 
dark line remains around each area of color. 
</P>
<P>
Keit's first commercially successful tiles were reproductions of tile bird 
scenes found on buildings in Catalina. The bird sets sold so well at the 1981 
Catalina Art Festival that Keit was able to quit his job with a computer 
company to make ceramics full time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Made With Rancho Malibu Clay 
</P>
<P>
According to a new book on "The Ceramic Art of the Malibu Potteries" published 
by the Malibu Lagoon Museum, Malibu tile was originally made with red and buff 
clay from Rancho Malibu, the vast land holding of company founder May K. Rindge 
(Rancho Malibu ran along the Pacific Ocean for 22 miles, from Santa Monica to 
Zuma Beach). 
</P>
<P>
Rindge hired ceramic chemist Rufus B. Keeler to run her seaside factory, whose 
100-plus workers often swam in the afternoon after work. Keeler's most 
important task was creating the glazes that gave the tile its characteristic 
richness and depth of color. 
</P>
<P>
As the book recounts, the glazes were Malibu's treasure, and the company 
guarded them accordingly. Employees who wandered unauthorized into "the holy of 
holies," as the glaze room was called, were not only fired, they were 
blacklisted in the ceramics industry. 
</P>
<P>
Like Keeler, Keit formulates his own glazes. "I've developed about 6,000 glaze 
formulas," he said. Glazer Diane Henson actually decorates many of the tiles. 
She works much as the old Malibu glazers did. A pattern is silk-screened or 
transferred onto unglazed tiles in some other way. 
</P>
<P>
The tiles are arranged on a Lazy Susan, and Henson moves from tile to tile, 
using a bulb syringe to apply the full-bodied glazes that re-create the 
characteristic Malibu look. The tiles are fired at 2,000 degrees. They remain 
in the kiln for 36 hours, including 20 hours for cooling down. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, modern ceramic technology is so good that it is sometimes difficult 
to get an authentic Malibu look. The kilns of Malibu Potteries and other 
ceramics plants of the period produced much less consistent temperatures than 
modern equipment, Keit said, and, as a result, produced more variation from 
tile to tile. 
</P>
<P>
Keit makes it a point to find out exactly what customers want before he starts 
producing their tiles. "Most people, when they are paying $15 a tile, want it 
to be perfect, but more informed people sometimes want more ceramic 
spontaneity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Keit regularly produces Catalina, Victorian, Art Nouveau and Art Deco tiles, in 
addition to Malibus. He also creates his own designs. Influenced by M. C. 
Escher, his originals include interlocking panthers, griffins, unicorns and 
maidens. Keit accepts minimum orders of $500. Orders are usually filled in six 
to eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Celebrity Orders 
</P>
<P>
Boosted by good word of mouth, Keit has done a number of celebrity commissions, 
either on his own or while he was with Malibu Ceramic Works (1981-83). 
</P>
<P>
Film maker George Lucas ordered a Malibu-ish original design for his Marin 
County swimming pool. Jane Fonda had the kitchen and bathrooms in her Santa 
Monica house done in Malibu tile. Keit's favorite client was the late musician 
Carmen Dragon, who would buy imperfect tiles or seconds from Keit and use them 
to make fanciful works in the style of Spanish architect Antonio Gaudi. 
</P>
<P>
Malibu Potteries closed in 1932, destroyed by a fire and the Great Depression. 
Today its work can be seen in all its glory in Los Angeles City Hall and, most 
especially, in the Adamson House, home of the Malibu Lagoon Museum in Malibu 
Lagoon State Beach.

2 NORTHRIDGE STUDENTS WIN SCHOLARSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Northridge youths are among 546 outstanding black students nationwide who 
won awards for college undergraduate study in the 1989 Achievement Scholarship 
competition of the National Merit Scholarship Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Alexis Toomer, a student at the Buckley School in Sherman Oaks, was one of 350 
students who won achievement scholarships of $2,000, in addition to another 
scholarship financed by Arco Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Paul W. Magwene of Loyola High School, Los Angeles, won a scholarship sponsored 
by Lever Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Toomer and Magwene are among about 90,000 black students who asked to be 
considered for the achievement program and among 1,200 finalists in the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Toomer, who is interested in a career in music, was president of her senior and 
sophomore classes and vice president of her junior class. She was a member of 
the varsity girls tennis team, the varsity pep squad and the math club; toured 
the Soviet Union in the cast of the musical "Peace Child," and won a book award 
from Yale University, where she has been accepted for early attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Magwene is preparing for a career in electrical engineering. He plays bass 
guitar in the Loyola High School Pep Band and is president of the role-playing 
club. He has been active in political, intramural sports and religious 
activities at school. 
</P>
<P>
The corporate-sponsored scholarships are worth from $500 to $8,000 a year.

AREA NEWSSTANDS: WHERE TO GO TO FIND OUT WHAT'S UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By R. DANIEL FOSTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nurturing a reading habit at area newsstands is easy -- most are at busy 
intersections and along well-traveled corridors such as Ventura and Victory 
boulevards. Many have boulevard addresses, but actually front on a cross 
street, so look around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
"Newsstands are definitely growing in number," said Errol Pectol, general 
manager of ARA Services in Burbank, a major distributor of magazines and 
paperbacks. "We've had several new, major stands open in the Valley in the past 
several years, and none have died out." 
</P>
<P>
Some newsstands carry daily foreign newspapers, such as Britain's Daily 
Telegraph, France's Le Monde and Italy's Corriere Della Sera. The papers, flown 
in daily, arrive one day late and cost from $2.50 to $2.95 for dailies and 
$3.75 to $4.95 for Sunday editions. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday editions of out-of-town newspapers, such as the San Jose Mercury News, 
the San Francisco Examiner, the Denver Post and the Milwaukee Journal, are 
mainstays at many stands, and some vendors also carry daily editions. All 
arrive one day late. The newspapers are priced from $1 to $4 for dailies and 
$2.50 to $4 for Sunday editions. 
</P>
<P>

GLENDALE TRIES TO SQUEEZE OUT ADULT STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glendale officials took action this week to rid the city of its only sexually 
oriented adult book and video store and to discourage potential peep-show 
operators from locating in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated by constitutional guarantees of freedom of expression, the City 
Council on Tuesday proposed an ordinance with regulations so stringent that 
they hope any adult entertainment business will be rendered unprofitable. 
</P>
<P>
The action came just three weeks after the council adopted regulations that 
appeared to condone adult-oriented businesses in Glendale's downtown 
redevelopment zone. 
</P>
<P>
A measure introduced Tuesday and expected to be adopted next week would 
prohibit enclosed booths in any store that offers adult entertainment. 
Officials said the booths, used by customers to view sexually explicit videos, 
have contributed to incidents of lewd conduct among customers who frequent 
adult shops. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outright Ban Prohibited 
</P>
<P>
The council has grappled for months over what to do about the Total News &amp; 
Video store that has operated since May, 1986, at 6524 San Fernando Road in the 
city's industrial zone. 
</P>
<P>
An outright ban on adult-entertainment businesses is prohibited by court 
interpretations of the First Amendment to the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
The council March 7 adopted a law confining such adult-entertainment businesses 
to the downtown commercial district -- action that an attorney representing the 
video store said "opened a can of worms" and would attract, rather than 
discourage, adult-oriented businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Roger J. Diamond, who contends that Glendale's effort to ban Total 
News &amp; Video violates the operator's constitutional rights, said last month 
that the law restricting peep-show operations to the commercial district makes 
the city "ripe for the picking" by new adult-entertainment businesses. 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Carl Raggio said Tuesday that the proposed ordinance banning private 
viewing booths "will discourage this type of business in this city" by making 
such stores virtually unprofitable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Booths Are 'Lifeblood' 
</P>
<P>
Glendale Police Lt. Michael Post, commander of the vice and narcotics division, 
told the council that the proposed ordinance "would eliminate 90% to 100% of 
the lewd conduct that has been taking place" at the adult entertainment store. 
He said the booths "are the lifeblood of the business" and account for 70% of 
the store's income. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale City Atty. Frank R. Manzano said "numerous studies" have shown that 
peep-show operations "have an increased incidence of lewd conduct." He said an 
ordinance banning private viewing booths "is viable and enforceable and 
represents a reasonable means of dealing with the well-documented problems that 
this type of land-use activity generates." 
</P>
<P>
Diamond, in an interview this week, said he sees no purpose in protesting the 
council's latest action, but is considering a legal challenge. 
</P>
<P>
The law, when adopted, would give Total News &amp; Video 90 days to get rid of 
its private booths.

COUNCIL OKS DEVELOPMENT RESTRICTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council unanimously voted this week to approve an 
ordinance that would severely limit development in parts of Highland Park. 
</P>
<P>
The measure was approved without discussion, in stark contrast to the bitter 
opposition that it met from small business and property owners when it was 
first proposed in December. 
</P>
<P>
If signed by Mayor Tom Bradley, the ordinance would prohibit the demolition of 
buildings in most cases and limit new construction to projects deemed by city 
planners to be compatible with the surrounding neighborhood. It is a temporary 
measure designed to stave off development while planners revise the area's 
general plan over the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Boundaries of Area 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance covers sections of Highland Park that are part of the 1st and 
14th City Council districts. The long, irregular swath is bounded by the 
Pasadena Freeway and Griffin Avenue on the east, Avenue 35 on the south, Avenue 
50 and Marmion Way on the west, and York Boulevard on the north. 
</P>
<P>
Under the ordinance, city planners will review new construction projects in the 
area to determine if they are consistent with the "density, scale and 
character" of 75% of the existing buildings within a 300-foot radius of the 
project. Under existing law, building projects in most areas of Los Angeles are 
only individually reviewed if a zone change is requested. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance combines two measures introduced separately this fall by 
Councilwoman Gloria Molina and Councilman Richard Alatorre. 
</P>
<P>
Another interim control ordinance proposed by Alatorre this month would use 
means similar to those in the Highland Park ordinance to limit development over 
a much larger area -- all of northeast Los Angeles. A City Council committee 
directed city planners Tuesday to draw up that ordinance and hold hearings on 
it.

RAIL OFFICIAL SAYS GLENDALE STILL IN RUNNING FOR COMMUTER LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite a low priority rating, Glendale officials this week were told that they 
still are in competition for funding for a commuter rail system. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale leaders have long complained that the city was unfairly slighted in 
1983 when the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission assigned a high 
priority to construction of a commuter rail line to Pasadena, rather than 
Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
But Richard Stanger, the commission's director of rail development, told 
Glendale City Council members during a city transportation study session 
Tuesday that the low rating is no longer significant. "High priority, low 
priority is less and less clear," said Stanger, who urged the city to continue 
to work for early development of a rail system. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena was one of three destinations targeted for initial construction of a 
proposed 150-mile rail system in the Los Angeles Basin. Early priority also was 
given to proposed routes in the San Fernando Valley and along the new Century 
Freeway to Los Angeles International Airport and Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Commission is expected within a year to select which of the 
routes will receive funding from the Proposition A half-cent gas sales tax 
authorized by voters in 1980. It is estimated that about $800 million will be 
available for construction projects through the year 2000 -- not enough to fund 
all three proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Stanger encouraged Glendale officials to join forces with Pasadena and Highland 
Park in lobbying for construction of the northeast route out of Los Angeles. He 
said the key to construction of a route to any of the northeast communities 
depends upon getting funding for a transit line from the Metro Rail station at 
7th and Flower streets downtown to Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
"It is important for Glendale, Pasadena and Highland Park that that segment be 
built," Stanger said. Once the link to downtown is decided, he said the 
communities could then fight it out to determine which one will receive the 
first commuter rail service. 
</P>
<P>
Commission officials in 1983 said Glendale had little chance of getting a 
light-rail system in less than 20 years because of the city's low priority 
rating. Glendale officials have attributed the rating to the city's laxity in 
lobbying for commission support. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena, on the other hand, has been vociferous in its support of a light-rail 
system. Glendale City Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg this week described 
Pasadena's campaign as "extra lobbying behind the scenes." She said Glendale 
was "out in left field" when priorities were assigned by the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena is participating in a joint study with the Transportation Commission 
on potential light-rail routes within Pasadena connecting to the proposed 
commuter line to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Following Pasadena's example, Glendale last year voted to split the $200,000 
cost with the commission for a similar study in Glendale, even though no route 
is being considered to link the city with a proposed rail line. City officials 
said the study, expected to be completed within nine months, would allow the 
city to act quickly should funds become available for a transit corridor to 
Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
It was during a study session with the city's light-rail transit consultants 
Tuesday that the county commission official offered the city hope. "What we are 
doing in Pasadena is very much to your advantage," Stanger said. "Stay up on 
what we are doing and work with Pasadena. Together you represent substantial 
interest."

ORDINANCE TO CAP GROWTH WON'T WORK, COUNCIL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five months after requesting an ordinance designed to place a cap on population 
in Glendale's increasingly crowded neighborhoods, council members acknowledge 
that the proposed measure would do little more than improve the city's 
aesthetic appearance. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed zoning ordinance would require new apartment buildings to be 
smaller, shorter, better-looking and, therefore, more expensive to build than 
those now rising throughout the city's multiple-unit residential areas. But the 
proposed law would have a marginal impact on population growth, city officials 
said this week. 
</P>
<P>
After its third study session on the proposed changes Tuesday, the City Council 
postponed voting on the measure for at least a week. However, council members 
have yet to comment on the individual items that make up the complex proposal, 
and it may take well over a month before any decision is made. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll take as much time as we need to get it right," Councilman Larry Zarian 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Favorable Vote Indicated 
</P>
<P>
Several council members said they are inclined to vote for the package of 
zoning changes. But they also said the council will have to start from square 
one to achieve its oft-stated goal of limiting Glendale's population to about 
200,000, in accordance with the city's general plan. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Planner James Glazer, architect of the proposed ordinance, told the 
council that under present zoning laws, there is room in Glendale for 49,000 
new apartment units. The city has 40,788 multiple-family units and 27,687 
single-family units. 
</P>
<P>
If the council adopts the proposed ordinance, he said, building restrictions 
would reduce the number of units by 8,000. And if the council incorporates 
recommendations made by the Chamber of Commerce in the proposal, the number of 
potential new units would not change. 
</P>
<P>
The news did not please council members. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moratorium Imposed 
</P>
<P>
Problems caused by population growth such as school overcrowding and traffic 
congestion prompted the council six months ago to unanimously adopt a 
moratorium on building and begin work on the proposed zoning ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason for the moratorium is the dramatic growth in this area," Mayor Carl 
Raggio wrote in a Glendale News-Press editorial in October, one month after 
voting for the 150-day apartment-building freeze. The moratorium was later 
extended until April 24. 
</P>
<P>
"The five months should be sufficient to restructure an ordinance and code that 
assures quality associated with apartment building," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After Tuesday's study session, three council members acknowledged that they 
were surprised and disappointed when the planning staff introduced the measure 
Feb. 28 without provisions to drastically reduce growth. 
</P>
<P>
"They misunderstood our instructions," Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg said. "We 
thought we made it absolutely clear that we wanted a population cap, but they 
went into aesthetics and design when we thought they were working on population 
reduction. I was a little astonished when they came up with the ordinance." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Larry Zarian agreed. "The intent was to reduce population growth," 
he said. "Whether we stated it clearly or not, it should be clear through the 
numerous statements we made in public and to the press. We've been saying for 
three or four years that we want to limit our population to 200,000, and I was 
surprised that the ordinance does not accomplish that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Measure Called 'Inadequate' 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Jerold Milner called the proposed ordinance "totally inadequate. We 
wanted it to reduce the number of building units allowed it the city, and it 
clearly did not." 
</P>
<P>
Raggio would not criticize the work, but said further legislation would be 
required to limit the city's population growth. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Councilman John F. Day said that trying to control 
population growth is an "exercise in futility." He said the city could not 
control the influx of immigrants pouring into Glendale, "short of keeping 
people out, because the population is going to grow." 
</P>
<P>
Glazer said he estimates that Glendale's population of 165,000 will level off 
eventually at 200,000 to 230,000, as projected in the city's general plan. But 
before then, it will probably exceed that number by between 50,000 and 100,000, 
he said. He said he based his projections on the fact that the pace of growth 
is surpassing the attrition rate of large, nonconforming apartment buildings in 
single-family and low-density zones, but that population eventually will fall 
as such buildings are removed. 
</P>
<P>
He refused to say whether he had received a mandate from the council to address 
population growth in the proposed ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Glazer would only say that his instructions, as he understood them, were "one, 
to identify community values in terms of design and what's being built and, 
two, try to establish solutions." 
</P>
<P>
Population growth notwithstanding, council members said they were pleased with 
the planning staff's solutions to improve the quality of apartment buildings in 
Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Follow-Up Measure Possible 
</P>
<P>
Bremberg, Raggio and Zarian said they favor adopting the proposed ordinance 
without major changes, then immediately putting the staff to work on another 
ordinance that would restrict growth mainly by rewriting zoning laws to limit 
building heights and density. Zarian and Raggio said they believe that they can 
keep the population close to 200,000. "It will be very difficult but it's a 
wonderful goal," Bremberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Milner said he believed that the city's population could be kept to close to 
200,000 without having to rezone a single block. He said it could be 
accomplished by limiting the size of underground parking garages to 50% of the 
property area. 
</P>
<P>
This limitation, added to the requirement of 2 1/2 to three parking spaces per 
unit in the proposed ordinance, would automatically reduce the amount of units 
that a developer could place on any given lot, Milner said. He said he will 
make this proposal at the next council session where the proposed ordinance is 
discussed. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the council postponed acting on the measure to allow more public 
comment. The Fair Growth Coalition, a developers group, is scheduled to make a 
presentation Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Fair Growth Coalition representative Haik Vartanian told the council March 21 
that his group would not be making a presentation and accused the council of 
"political grandstanding." But he said Tuesday that his group changed its mind 
at the urging of Day and Zarian.

SUPERVISOR'S PLAN FOR NEW JAIL CRITICIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County Supervisor John Flynn on Wednesday unveiled a detailed plan to 
build a 400-cell jail at the county Government Center, but it was immediately 
attacked by other county officials, including Sheriff John Gillespie. 
</P>
<P>
The plan would also expand three other minimum-security facilities already 
operated by the county. 
</P>
<P>
"I am 100% diametrically opposed to the entire plan," Gillespie said in an 
interview. "It does not meet the criteria of the state Board of Corrections and 
the language of the jail bond itself, and we've told Mr. Flynn this many times. 
Everybody in the county is pulling in one direction and Mr. Flynn's pulling in 
another." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal also drew skeptical response from Supervisors Maggie Erickson, 
Madge L. Schaefer and Jim Dougherty, who said Flynn's plan would increase 
staffing costs and fail to meet long-term jail needs. The county must pick a 
site and start construction by late 1990 to qualify for $40 million in state 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is just a minor diversion," Schaefer said of Flynn's plan. She 
also criticized Flynn for his plans to disperse inmates throughout county 
facilities, but exclude his own supervisorial district of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
"Forty-eight percent of the jail population comes from Oxnard, yet John doesn't 
propose anything in Oxnard," Schaefer said, citing inmate population figures 
supplied by Gillespie. (The city of Ventura comes in second highest with 16% of 
the inmates.) 
</P>
<P>
Flynn's plan, which he disclosed at a Wednesday morning press conference, calls 
for building a 400-cell facility at the Government Center and adding space for 
another 50 inmates at the East Valley sheriff's station, an additional 100 at 
the sheriff's Honor Farm in Ojai and 150 at a proposed work furlough facility 
near Rose Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn also proposed building a seven-story parking structure -- three of the 
floors underground -- to replace the parking areas that would be forfeited for 
the new jail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plan Assailed 
</P>
<P>
"I'm offering something that's practical, achievable, that could go up in a 
couple of years. If we don't get moving, we're going to lose the little money 
we have," Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
But critics assailed Flynn's plan as impractical and unachievable, and added 
that it would set the county back two years in planning. 
</P>
<P>
According to Gillespie, the plan is flawed because it does not meet state jail 
bond requirements that require a new facility to have a potential capacity for 
2,000 cells. In addition, Gillespie said the county's contract with the U.S. 
Forest Service allows for no more than 160 inmates at Rose Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't expand that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson said Wednesday that she favors moving forward with a master plan that 
calls for a jail complex of six two-story modular buildings spread out over 20 
acres, with 80 acres remaining in open space. The jail is to be a 
medium-security facility that eventually could house up to 2,000 inmates, and 
would include recreational areas and a facility where prisoners could learn 
trades and "work as a revenue producer for the county," Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prove Expensive 
</P>
<P>
A Dougherty spokesman said Flynn's plan would prove prohibitively expensive in 
the long run because of the higher staffing costs associated with a multistory 
building. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn's proposal is the latest twist in the county's arduous battle for a new 
jail site. It already has 933 beds at four locations, but the Board of 
Corrections estimates that the county will need 962 more beds in the future to 
meet inmate growth. 
</P>
<P>
Overcrowding is at an all-time high, Gillespie said. The county's jail 
population increased 115% between 1976 and 1986, according to state figures. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the County Jail, which was built to hold 400 inmates, holds more 
than 1,000 inmates at times, and two prisoners often share 70-square-foot cells 
meant for one. Some overflow prisoners sleep on bunks in day rooms. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental impact report commissioned by the county initially only 
looked at two jail sites: 100 acres of farmland south of Hueneme and Nauman 
roads and Toland Park near Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Significant' Problems 
</P>
<P>
But the county expanded the report to three more sites after the report found 
"significant" problems with the Hueneme Road location, in part because it would 
destroy prime agricultural land. In addition, Oxnard city officials complained 
that a jail would cast a shadow on a resort planned for nearby Ormond Beach. 
</P>
<P>
But the Toland Park site also had problems. Located half a mile north of 
California 126 in the Santa Clara River Valley on a county-owned site overgrown 
with chaparral, it would require up to $8 million in grading, Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, since Toland is a dedicated park, the county would be forced to 
set aside similar acreage for park use in another part of the county. 
</P>
<P>
The additional areas under review are Todd Road between Ventura and Santa Paula 
off California 126, and two locations off Pleasant Valley Road, one of them 
near Camarillo State Hospital, Erickson said.

TUESDAY NIGHT LIVE;

SANTA MONICA COUNCIL MEMBERS COMPETE FOR TV VIEWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It took the cameramen about an hour to match the council members' names with 
their faces, and for the first 15 minutes, the director wasn't even sure if the 
show was on the air. 
</P>
<P>
But for the most part, all went smoothly late Tuesday as the Santa Monica City 
Council for the first time allowed a live broadcast of its twice-monthly 
meetings on cable television. 
</P>
<P>
"We started out shaky," conceded Marty Stolmack, a member of the six-man crew 
that produced the six-hour telecast for the city of Santa Monica's television 
station, cable Channel 16. "But for a first show, this has gone exceptionally 
well." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Compete for Viewers 
</P>
<P>
Still, no one could say for sure if the telecasts would really increase 
participation in local government -- as some council members hoped -- or if the 
council could compete with Johnny Carson and David Letterman for late night and 
early morning television viewers when the meetings drag on. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the conspicuous presence of three television cameras and bright 
2,000-watt lamps, which made some city officials perspire, most of the council 
members seemed to take their television debut in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"On tricky votes, are we going to have instant replay?," quipped Councilman 
William H. Jennings. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the technology has advanced that far yet," retorted a 
straight-faced Mayor Dennis Zane. 
</P>
<P>
The council allocated funds for the broadcasts in January, but placed some 
restrictions on what could be televised. Like their counterparts in the U.S. 
Congress, the council members will not allow the cameras to show audience 
reaction or "cutaways" of the lawmakers nodding off or committing other 
indiscretions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Focus on Yawns 
</P>
<P>
"We're not here to make them look bad, or to catch them in the act if they're 
yawning," said Laura Greenfield, manager of the cable station. "Our job is to 
be fair and respectful of the elected officials. We'll only take shots of them 
if they're speaking." 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was broadcast only to Santa Monica residents who subscribe to cable 
television and was available to about 16,000 households. 
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting began, Greenfield said she was confident her staff of 
interns and part-time television technicians could pull off the tricky live 
broadcast. "I have faith in them," Greenfield said. "Things can go wrong, but I 
think it'll be OK." 
</P>
<P>
As television viewing, the meeting didn't have the drama and suspense of, say, 
"Miami Vice" or "L.A. Law." Among the highlights of the six-hour broadcast were 
the council's decision to exempt an 83-year-old woman's organic garden from a 
weed abatement program and a long discussion among residents, city 
administrators and council members about issuing parking permits in one 
residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Point Is Information 
</P>
<P>
Council members pointed out that the meeting wasn't meant to be entertaining, 
but informative. 
</P>
<P>
"It's another level of public access," said Councilwoman Christine E. Reed. 
"It's my hope that we can get other agencies of the city involved. It saves 
people a trip to City Hall." 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, the council members said, the broadcasts would inspire Santa Monica 
citizens to step away from the glow of their television screens and drive to 
City Hall to actually participate in the meetings, something that has been 
known to happen at other Westside cities that televise council deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a few cases where people will come to testify at the meetings and 
say, 'Hey, I was watching this at home, and I have something to say about 
this,' " said Daniel Bruck, a technician who helps televise Beverly Hills City 
Council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
City officials in West Hollywood have also received compliments from viewers 
since the city began transmitting its council meetings in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had excellent response," said Ian Tanza, the city's cable television 
administrator. "It really brings local government to the people." 
</P>
<P>
When Santa Monica first discussed televising the meetings in January, however, 
some council members expressed their reluctance. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman David Finkel voted against the proposal because he said there are 
better uses for the city's money. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather they figure out what it's going to cost us and give that money to 
social service providers. We should be giving that money to the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Finkel added, the meetings are already broadcast on radio, a medium 
that he prefers because it "leaves more to the imagination." 
</P>
<P>
Greenfield said the broadcasts will cost the city about $650 per meeting now, 
but only $250 per meeting after permanent, remote-control cameras are installed 
on the walls of the council chambers. Installation is expected in July, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Van Bought 
</P>
<P>
The city also spent about $150,000 for a production van, which will also be 
used to broadcast basketball games, concerts and other events. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the city did not have time to publicize the premiere broadcast, 
and how many viewers actually saw Tuesday's meeting was uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
During a break in the proceedings shortly before midnight, Councilwoman Reed 
confirmed that there was at least one viewer. Telephoning her husband at home, 
she was surprised to discover he was actually watching the broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband says it's much easier to follow than on radio," Reed said. "For 
him, the most interesting part is seeing the people who are testifying." 
</P>
<P>
Greenfield said Tuesday's council meeting will be rebroadcast today and 
Saturday at 11:30 a.m.

GREEN STREET, RAILING AGAINST RAIL LINE, WINS

<TEXT>
<P>
The Green Street transit mall proposal is 'a planner's delight and a realist's 
nightmare.' 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mayor William E. Thomson Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Business and property owners on Green Street won a victory Tuesday in their 
battle to persuade the Pasadena Board of Directors to route a proposed regional 
light-rail line down the center of the Foothill Freeway, (Interstate 210) and 
keep it off their street. 
</P>
<P>
Although they deferred a decision on the route until April 11, a majority of 
the board made it clear that it agrees with owners of businesses and property 
there that Green Street would be a poor choice. The board instructed the city's 
light-rail alignment task force, which has been studying three potential routes 
-- including two involving Green Street -- to consider the statements made by 
board members and make a recommendation Wednesday so that the board can act the 
following week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Board's Choice Is Clear 
</P>
<P>
D. Gordon Bagby, task force chairman, said it is clear that the board wants the 
rail line to follow the freeway east through Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed rail line from Los Angeles would enter Pasadena along the Santa Fe 
railroad right of way and proceed north. Then it would turn east, either on the 
railroad right of way in the center of the Foothill Freeway or on surface 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
One plan would convert Green Street into a transit mall between Raymond Avenue 
and Hill Street, eliminating most auto traffic. Another plan would use Colorado 
Boulevard for the eastbound rail line and Green Street for the westbound line. 
Both lines would turn north at Hill Street and follow a route east near Walnut 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of an association formed to oppose the use of Green Street told the 
board Tuesday that 95% of the business and property owners contacted along the 
street are against the plan. 
</P>
<P>
John Mangoni, a pediatrician with an office on Green Street, said: "When I 
found out about the light-rail system possibly coming down Green Street, I was, 
to say the least, horrified, disappointed and confused -- confused as to why 
Pasadena would want to turn a beautiful tree-lined street into a train 
corridor." 
</P>
<P>
The light-rail line to Pasadena would be an extension of a rail line now under 
construction by the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission between Long 
Beach and Los Angeles. The system requires the use of station platforms that 
are about three feet high and 300 feet long to board cars that are 90 feet 
long. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission is studying a number of 
possible extensions, including routes in the San Fernando Valley and along the 
coast, between the Century Freeway in El Segundo and Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
Marcia Jacobs, a businesswoman and property owner, said the conversion of Green 
into a transit mall could cost businesses 300 parking spaces and would restrict 
access to 70 driveways. 
</P>
<P>
Businessman Jacob Maarse said the impact on his flower shop "would be 
disastrous." He would not gain any business from a commuter rail line, he said, 
but would lose customers that now drive to his shop. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas W. Fordyce, owner of a travel agency, said the effect on his business 
"would be devastating during construction, and if I survive, would be of 
minimal or no benefit" afterward. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PCC Support 
</P>
<P>
Most of the support for the Green Street route at Tuesday's board meeting came 
from a spokesman for Pasadena City College and from several handicapped 
persons. PCC took the position that the Green Street route, which would pass 
the college, would be more convenient than a freeway line three blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
Three persons who are disabled said the freeway route would be a disadvantage 
to them because stations would be remote from businesses and they would be 
required to travel on street overpasses and elevators to reach the line. 
</P>
<P>
Director Kathryn Nack said, "I'm sympathetic to the needs of handicapped people 
and their means of using public transit, but I'm also optimistic that there can 
be devised in this era of good engineering design ways of getting up and down 
and back and forth from the freeway." She also noted that the freeway line "is 
not that far from PCC." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor William E. Thomson Jr. said that if light rail is intended primarily as a 
commuter system, the clear choice is to put it along the freeway. He called the 
Green Street transit mall proposal "a planner's delight and a realist's 
nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Director Jess Hughston proposed that the city board instruct its light-rail 
task force to drop the Green Street route and give priority to studying the 
freeway line. Director Rick Cole said he would never support the Green Street 
route, but warned against "short-circuiting" the planning process. 
</P>
<P>
The light-rail task force is in the middle of engineering studies and had 
planned to recommend a route this summer. But the board instructed the task 
force Tuesday to speed up that process and make a recommendation Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The city has been considering, in addition to the light-rail route, development 
of a trolley or bus system to operate within the city. Officials have solicited 
proposals for engineering studies and economic ones that would examine a 
trolley system on both rails and rubber tires. 
</P>
<P>
Even if it used rails, the trolley system would be vastly different from the 
regional light-rail plan, since it would use smaller cars that could be boarded 
from the street level. 
</P>

<P>
Map, LIGHT RAIL TRANSIT ROUTE The Pasadena Board of Directors appears ready to 
adopt a light-rail line that follows the Santa Fe railway right of way north 
near Arroyo Parkway and east in the center of the Foothill Freeway. Most city 
directors Tuesday agreed with merchants and property owners along Green Street

MALIBU'S SEWER DISTRICT CRITICIZED AS UNFAIRLY DRAWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH J. GARCIA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Malibu community leaders are accusing Los Angeles County officials of 
gerrymandering the area's sewer assessment district by assigning less than 50% 
of the district to the town's residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
To mount a "majority protest" to overturn the sewer plan, the signatures of 
owners of more than 50% of property in the district would have been required. 
Instead, four of the area's major landowners, known to favor the $43-million 
sewer plan, were assigned the majority of acreage in the district. 
</P>
<P>
John B. Murdock, lawyer for the Malibu Township Council who filed a lawsuit 
challenging the financial "inequities" of the assessment district last month, 
said the acreage allotment would be challenged when additional court briefs are 
filed in May. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accusations by Sewer Foes 
</P>
<P>
Although four county supervisors voted to approve the sewer district in January 
-- the number needed to override any majority protest -- sewer foes say county 
public works officials purposely designed the district to block potential 
confrontation with residents. 
</P>
<P>
"I had credited the people who make these decisions with some degree of 
sophistication," said Leon Cooper, Township Council vice president. "But this 
is so obvious, I can't see how they could have done anything more to reveal 
their motives, their strategy and their objectives. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ironic that they worked so hard to plan this out, and they didn't even 
need to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Harry Stone, deputy director of public works, denied the gerrymandering 
allegation and noted that residents who own 18% of the acreage in the district 
had filed protests. He said the district was drawn up in the most equitable way 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
However, critics point to Pepperdine University's assessment as one example of 
the alleged gerrymandering. They say that although Pepperdine University's 
long-range plans call for only 311 acres of the sprawling campus to be 
developed, the county assessed all 785 acres owned by the university. As a 
result, even though more than half of the campus has been designated as open 
space, the university makes up 41% of the entire sewer district. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than 200 acres at the campus that are zoned for less than one 
dwelling unit per acre were included in the district, even though the district 
guidelines say that such land should not be assessed. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason the entire campus was zoned was that we were looking at Pepperdine 
as one holding," Stone said. "The acreage was spread out across the entire 
campus, specifically as a lien against the bond holding." 
</P>
<P>
The county has not issued the bonds to pay for the sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the sewer plan say the district's design underscores the "inequity" 
of the assessments. Although Pepperdine's acreage makes up 41% of the sewer 
district, the university's $3-million assessment is only 8% of the cost of 
system. 
</P>
<P>
"The county created an assessment district that could not be protested even if 
every resident in it objected," said Mike Caggiano, a former RAND Corp. analyst 
who challenged the district's makeup at the January supervisors' hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The typical homeowner in the sewer district faces a $9,900 tax bill for the 
project. However, the lawsuit by the Township Council and another suit by the 
California Coastal Commission has damaged the marketability of the bonds and 
could add about $12 million to the project cost, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unfair Burden 
</P>
<P>
The Township Council suit alleges that the county sewer plan burdens homeowners 
along a seven-mile coastal strip with an unfair share of fees. The Coastal 
Commission is challenging the legitimacy of the sewer district, maintaining 
that state approval was required but not obtained by the county. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Kurt Lewin set a May 8 hearing 
date for the Coastal Commission suit. The Township Council's challenge will 
probably be heard in June, Murdock said. 
</P>
<P>
The county has been trying to place a sewer system in Malibu for more than two 
decades. Opponents say a sewer would open the beachfront area to widespread 
commercial development. But sewer backers maintain that any growth would take 
place in an orderly fashion as permitted under local and state development 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
County officials insisted that a sewer was required based on staff studies that 
they say document a "significant public health hazard" because of discharges 
from malfunctioning septic tanks. The findings by the Department of Health 
Services allowed the county to impose a sewer system without a vote of the 
community.

OFFICIALS SAY CITIES SHOULD POOL EFFORTS TO FIGHT GANGS 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City officials have suggested that several cities in the Southeast and South 
Bay pool their resources to tackle growing problems with gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Lynwood Councilman Robert Henning said the city was attempting to create a 
nonprofit organization, called a Joint Powers Authority, to raise money and 
plan other strategy against gangs. 
</P>
<P>
The cities, in addition to Lynwood, would include Long Beach, Compton, South 
Gate, Carson and Gardena, Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was revealed Wednesday at a summit meeting attended by Sen. Alan 
Cranston (D-Calif.) and about 75 elected officials, community leaders and other 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'In a Crisis' 
</P>
<P>
"We are in a crisis," said Lynwood Councilman Paul Richards. "We need an 
approach that will cut across all jurisdictions." 
</P>
<P>
Gardena City Councilman James W. Cragin said: "We are tired of being blown up 
and shot up in our communities" by gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Many youths are lured into gangs because of the potential profit from drugs, 
said Emma Esparza, a member of the Lynwood Personnel Commission. She said a 
gang member had approached her daughter and offered to pay her $17,000 to sell 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Her daughter refused, Esparza said, but the commissioner questioned whether 
others would do the same. "How are you going to tell a gang member making 
$17,000 on drugs to get out of the gang?" Esparza asked. 
</P>
<P>
Lynwood resident Elizabeth Dixon, whose 19-year-old son, Eddie Melvin Dixon 
Jr., was killed in a drive-by shooting Feb 4. in South-Central Los Angeles, 
questioned whether authorities are devoting enough resources to gang problems 
in minority communities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Can't Find Money' 
</P>
<P>
"When there was a killing in Westwood the authorities found money for more 
police protection. But they tell us they can't find any money (to help with 
gangs)," said Dixon, who is black. 
</P>
<P>
The session was one of three that Cranston scheduled Wednesday in Southeast 
communities to discuss gang problems. 
</P>
<P>
He promised no specific action, but said this might be the time for the federal 
government "to cut back on what we are spending on the military and free the 
money for education, housing and fighting crime." 
</P>
<P>
Henning said other sessions are being set up "because elected officials need to 
know what is going on and to pass laws to protect us." Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally 
(D-Compton) has been invited to attend an April 7 session, Henning said.

RESTROOM VANDALISM, GRAFFITI GET MONROVIA STUDENTS TO THINK CLEAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jesse Romero was resting in the nurse's office at Monrovia High School when he 
noticed students lining up to use the restroom there. 
</P>
<P>
It was the only clean one they had access to, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"While I was lying there I was just thinking, 'Why doesn't somebody do 
something about this?' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old junior decided to lead a campaign for improvements. Within a 
week, school officials had pledged to repair and paint the nine restrooms over 
spring break next month. 
</P>
<P>
Romero photographed the effects of vandalism and neglect on the restrooms, 
documenting damaged toilet seats and walls smeared with graffiti. Towel and 
toilet paper dispensers are broken or missing, as are doors and stalls, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After investing a weekend and about $70 on posters and flyers touting the 
Restroom Improvement Movement, he collected 750 signatures on a petition 
requesting repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Romero bypassed the student government because "I wanted to do something right 
away," he said. "I decided to go straight to the top and get results." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
300 to Support Cause 
</P>
<P>
Romero said he had persuaded 300 students to support his cause at the Monrovia 
Unified School District's regular board meeting March 22, but district Supt. 
Don Montgomery informed him that day that the repairs would be made. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad when students care enough to work for changes," said school board 
President Christine Goudy. 
</P>
<P>
Principal Jack Clement said the 60-year-old restrooms usually get a new coat of 
paint every summer and are repaired as needed during the Christmas and spring 
breaks, but vandalism is a constant problem. The restrooms "were in tip-top 
condition" when the school year began, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see students police (the restrooms) themselves so we don't have to 
do it routinely," Clement said. "It's a waste of resources." 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the school's restrooms are no worse than many other public 
facilities, district Director of Maintenance Chuck Nickoley said his crews have 
a tough time keeping up with vandals. 
</P>
<P>
"We clean them, we paint them, we turn around and they graffiti them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem arises because amenities such as soap and paper towels are used 
to plug up sinks and toilets, said Goudy, who inspected the restrooms last 
Thursday. She pointed out that the school is vulnerable to vandals because it 
remains open until 10 p.m. four nights a week for adult education classes. 
</P>
<P>
Romero, who plans to run for student body president next year, doesn't intend 
to rest on his laurels after this campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I put a lot of time into this. I want the restrooms to stay clean," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pride Campaign 
</P>
<P>
Before spring break begins April 10, Romero said, he hopes to drum up interest 
among the 1,200 students at the school to monitor the restrooms and take pride 
in maintaining them. 
</P>
<P>
To reduce scrawling on the walls, he will suggest pinning up large sheets of 
paper in every restroom. 
</P>
<P>
"I've talked to some wall-writers and they said they'd use these areas," he 
said. At the end of each day, the graffiti-covered sheets would be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, students do things to the restroom," Romero said. "But if we make a big 
thing out of this, maybe we could make it trendy to keep the bathrooms clean."

RESTAURANT ON MAIN OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council voted Tuesday to make an exception to its zoning laws to allow 
a new restaurant on Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Fiondella, who has operated Chez Jay on Ocean Avenue for 30 years, will now 
be able to move the restaurant to a building he recently purchased on Main 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm elated. It's been a long, rocky road," Fiondella said after the council 
approved the exemption by a 5-2 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Ken Genser and Judy Abdo said they were sympathetic to 
Fiondella, but voted against the exemption because they oppose any waivers of a 
city ordinance that allows only four restaurants on each block of Main Street 
in the downtown area.

D.A. INVESTIGATES PAIR IN ALLEGED FRAUD AND THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Newbury Park couple convicted of consumer fraud in Los Angeles three years 
ago are under investigation by the Ventura County district attorney's office 
for alleged theft and false representation in operating a custom-door business 
called Universal Woodworking, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of complaints were made to our office and . . . they were not 
insignificant complaints," said Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregory W. Brose, who 
is in charge of consumer fraud prosecutions. He said his office is deciding 
whether to file criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
Also investigating more than two dozen complaints from Ventura County residents 
is the Los Angeles city attorney's office, which contends that the alleged 
frauds constitute a violation of the couple's probation. 
</P>
<P>
Sue L. Frauens, supervising attorney for the consumer protection section of the 
Los Angeles city attorney's office, maintains that Julie and Ronald Huber have 
allegedly bilked their Ventura County customers out of at least $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
She said the complaints are identical to those that led to the Hubers' 
conviction in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County complaints have already prompted a Los Angeles judge to 
revoke the Hubers' probation. On April 24, he is to decide whether the alleged 
violations are serious enough to send the Hubers back to jail. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they have each posted $25,000 bail and, as of Tuesday, could be 
reached at Universal Woodworking, where they continue to do business. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sentenced in '86 
</P>
<P>
Julie and Ronald Huber were sentenced in April, 1986, to 165 days and 150 days, 
respectively, for violating consumer fraud laws and were placed on three years 
probation, Frauens said. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of their conviction, the Hubers operated a retail hardware and 
custom door store in Woodland Hills called Creative Door and Sash. Around that 
time, the couple also started Universal Woodworking and opened offices in Simi 
Valley and Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
Frauens said the Hubers "violated numerous terms and conditions of probation by 
engaging in false and deceptive advertising" in Ventura County. The complaints 
included misrepresentation, shoddy workmanship, delivery of inferior goods and 
non-delivery of purchased goods, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief interview, Julie Huber denied any wrongdoing and said Universal 
Woodworking is owned by her 21-year-old daughter, Jolie Huber. "Ninety percent 
of the stuff we sell is from other manufacturers," she said. Customers "inspect 
it before they pay for it, and if there's a problem at that time, they don't 
accept it." 
</P>
<P>
Mary C. Harris of Thousand Oaks disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
Harris is a former customer of the Hubers who won a $1,500 settlement against 
them in Ventura County Small Claims Court two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
She also is a woman who has lived through a lot of pain and hoped, somewhat 
optimistically perhaps, that redecorating her house would help her recover from 
a great loss. 
</P>
<P>
Harris says she wanted to redecorate because she thought that it would help her 
get over the death of her 20-year-old son Brian, who had lived at home until 
1985, when he was brutally slain along with his girlfriend after being abducted 
near UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Couple Abducted 
</P>
<P>
A Cal State Northridge sophomore, Brian had been walking his 19-year-old 
girlfriend, Michelle A. Boyd, back to her apartment at UCLA when four young men 
from South-Central Los Angeles kidnaped the college sweethearts, took them to a 
secluded field off Mulholland Drive in the Santa Monica Mountains and shot them 
both in the back of the head. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Bennett, 23, and Damon L. Redmond, 22, were sentenced to 18 years to 
life for their roles in the killings. The trial of 26-year-old Stanley B. 
Davis, the alleged triggerman, is pending. The fourth man, DeAndre Brown, was 
given immunity from prosecution in return for his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1987, Mary Harris said, she paid Universal Woodworking more than 
$6,000 to purchase and install fancy oak doors, paneling and side moldings. 
</P>
<P>
Harris asserts that part of her order was never delivered. The doors that did 
arrive were of inferior quality -- cheap pine coated with an oak veneer and 
hollow inside, she said. Others were so poorly installed that a contractor 
brought in to fix the damage refused the work for fear of incurring 
liabilities, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
She is returning to court next month because she claims that the Hubers have 
paid only $750 of the court-ordered judgment against them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Horrible Nightmare' 
</P>
<P>
"The whole point in doing this was to change the house where we had lived, and 
it turned into a horrible nightmare. Our house was torn up from one end to the 
other. We got no satisfaction from them whatsoever. They're . . . making life 
miserable for a lot of people," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Julie Huber pleaded no contest to charges that she stole money from a 
customer by delivering doors that were not oak, as the customer required, by 
keeping the payment and by failing to provide accessory hardware as ordered, 
according to a statement from the Los Angeles city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Huber also admitted failing to pay the state more than $10,000 in sales taxes 
collected in 1984 and 1985, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Huber pleaded no contest to charges of false advertising, aiding and 
abetting his wife in fraudulent business dealings, and writing bad checks to 
suppliers of a firm he ran in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The court also ordered the Hubers to pay almost $12,000 in fines and penalties 
and to reimburse victims for their losses.

TOWING COMPANY LOSES BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite pleas from a dozen speakers who supported keeping the city's towing 
contract with a hometown firm, MPR Auto and Truck Repair, the City Council 
voted 3 to 1 Monday to give the work to a San Gabriel firm, Dickson Motor 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
MPR has held the contract since April, 1987, and was one of the seven firms 
that submitted bids for a new contract in January. 
</P>
<P>
"The city has a chance to keep business in the city," MPR owner Stephen Tan 
said. He argued that MPR's bid was comparable to Dickson's, if not lower. "I'm 
not asking for any favoritism. I'm asking for fair treatment." 
</P>
<P>
Tan and his partner, Fred Balderrama, disputed a complicated bid analysis by 
city officials who used a point system that ranked Dickson as the best choice 
and MPR as second. Both men suggested that city officials made mistakes in the 
bid analysis. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Barry L. Hatch said that if the city staff made a mistake, "it was a 
righteous mistake." 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, there are no errors," said Warren Funk, manager of 
the city's support services. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwomen Betty Couch and Judy Chu, in explaining their votes for Dickson, 
said they were troubled by the number of complaints about MPR that the city has 
received. 
</P>
<P>
Balderrama responded that he was proud of his firm's record. He complained that 
the council's rejection of his bid "was purely political." Balderrama was an 
unsuccessful candidate in last year's council election. Tan is a planning 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Christopher F. Houseman, on advice from City Atty. Anthony 
Canzoneri, left before the vote. He later explained that he had a conflict of 
interest because MPR's owners have given him political contributions twice 
since he was elected in 1986.

PROPOSAL FOR SINGLE TRASH HAULING FRANCHISE REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After some heavy lobbying by garbage collection companies, the Downey City 
Council unanimously voted this week to reject a proposal that would have 
awarded the city's franchise to only one hauler. Instead, the 16 firms that 
currently hold either commercial, industrial or residential trash collection 
licenses will be allowed to continue operation. 
</P>
<P>
When the issue of franchising to a single firm went before the council in 
February, members delayed action until the haulers were given an opportunity to 
address the council. At Tuesday's meeting, attorney Z. Harry Astor spoke 
against franchising on behalf of 12 of the 16 haulers. And city officials 
acknowledged that they had received 70 letters, mostly from local businesses 
opposed to making any change. 
</P>
<P>
As garbage hauler Michael Agopian put it, the current system is "the American 
way" because it allows for more competition. 
</P>
<P>
Astor said his clients will comply with the council's desire that they start 
work no earlier than 7 a.m. to avoid disturbing residents with noise from the 
compactors. They also promised to make sure their equipment operates safely and 
to repaint dumpster bins that are parked in alleys at businesses and identify 
them with the haulers' names. 
</P>
<P>
Astor said the haulers also are willing to let the city raise their permit fees 
from $187.50 per truck to $500 per truck.

NEIGHBORS COMPLAIN OF ROCK BANDS AT BALLROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 30 neighbors of the Fenders International Grand Ballroom complained 
to the Long Beach City Council this week of noisy bands and rowdy patrons, 
prompting the council to raise the possibility of revoking the ballroom's 
business licenses. 
</P>
<P>
The club, which hosts rock groups, is next door to the Lafayette condominium 
building, where residents say they are also plagued by clientele of catering 
rooms and a bar under the same ownership as the ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
"These people have no respect for the building, they have no respect for the 
neighborhood," said Scott Hunt of Lafayette Concerned Residents. 
</P>
<P>
In response, the council directed the city staff to investigate whether the 
city should declare the club, at 521 E. 1st St., a public nuisance or place 
some restrictions on its operation. The staff will report back to the council 
in several weeks.

MIXED-USE DEVELOPMENT PROPOSED FOR OLD PIKE SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal to turn the seashore site of a former amusement park into a 
sprawling complex of offices, residences and shops will go before the Long 
Beach Planning Commission this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Pike project developers received approval for their 11-building proposal Monday 
from the Redevelopment Agency and are now seeking an amendment to the local 
coastal plan to allow construction of the mixed-use complex planned for the 
last large tract of privately owned land left in the city south of Ocean 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Proposed for just south of downtown, the project calls for 3.3 million square 
feet of new construction, to be built in four phases, ending in year 2003.

49ERS OF THE FUTURE; 
</P>
<P>
COACH HARRINGTON OUTLINES NEXT YEAR'S TEAM WITH THE ADDITION OF SOME IMPRESSIVE 
RECRUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joe Harrington finally is getting what he has wanted since arriving two years 
ago as head basketball coach at Cal State Long Beach: big players who are good 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Never again, he hopes, will he face what he had to this season. There were 
games in which the 49ers, because of injuries, had only one player taller than 
6 feet 5 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Harrington, who has a 30-27 record at Long Beach, has won acclaim for getting 
the most from marginal talent. This season's team, 13-15 overall and 10-8 in 
the Big West Conference, competed effectively against all the Big West teams 
except the champion, Nevada Las Vegas. Outmatched in size, depth and athletic 
ability, the 49ers were overwhelmed twice by Las Vegas, which went to the NCAA 
West Regional finals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Results of Recruiting Efforts 
</P>
<P>
Harrington believes that will change soon. The recruiting efforts of the last 
two years have produced an impressive group of young players. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a boisterous person," Harrington said this week in his office as he 
looked at a board on which he had written the names of those players, "but 
these guys are pretty good, and they're good athletes. We have the bodies and 
the athletes to compete with Vegas. That doesn't mean we're going to win (right 
away), but you have to have that to start with. We're starting to approach (the 
point) where we can compete with the best teams in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Here is a look at the new players, listed by the academic class they will be in 
next season: 
</P>
<P>
JUNIORS: 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Cutler -- A 6-foot-8, 220-pound forward with 38-inch arms. Two years ago, 
while at Arizona Western College, he was Arizona's junior college player of the 
year. "He's an Illinois-type player," Harrington said, referring to the 
high-leaping players on the University of Illinois' Final Four team. "That's 
what it takes." Cutler's specialties are rebounding and intimidating the 
defense. "He changed the whole tone of our practices," Harrington said. "When 
he came out John Hatten and the other big guys could no longer shoot layups." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Williams -- Also 6-8 and 220, Williams played at Arizona Western, where 
he was rated the nation's No. 2 junior college power forward. Before that, he 
played at the University of Cincinnati. Seth Greenberg, 49ers assistant coach, 
said Williams is a scorer who can shoot outside and who reminds him of former 
NBA great Chet Walker. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Jarvis -- A 6-5 guard from Millikan High School in Long Beach, Jarvis 
averaged 11.5 points a game and shot 57% from the field, mostly on intermediate 
range jumpers, for the College of Southern Idaho in Twin Falls. "He's the 
prototype NBA guard," Greenberg said. "He can shoot and make plays for himself 
and his teammates." Jarvis could be the outside shooter the 49ers badly need. 
</P>
<P>
SOPHOMORES 
</P>
<P>
Frankie Edwards -- Another former all-CIF player from Millikan, the 6-8, 
220-pound Edwards, a power forward, sat out this season under the National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn.'s Proposition 48. He is now academically eligible. 
"He might be one of the meanest players I've had," Harrington said of Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Winbush -- Formerly of Crenshaw High School in Los Angeles, Winbush also 
sat out this season under Proposition 48. He is 6-9, 180 pounds and likely will 
play guard. "When we're trapping (in the full-court press) it will be hard for 
opponents to throw the ball over him," Harrington said. 
</P>
<P>
Troy Joseph -- Harrington discovered the 6-3 Joseph at a campus three-on-three 
tournament last fall. He played at Western High School in Anaheim and at 
Fullerton College. "A slashing athlete" who can shoot, defend and take the ball 
to the basket, Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Masucci -- A 6-10 center, he started eight games as a freshman two years 
ago at the University of Kansas. Greenberg said Masucci has the highest 
basketball IQ among the 49ers. But he might not have a future at Long Beach -- 
the coaches doubt he will be able to earn the 24 credits he needs to be 
eligible under NCAA transfer rules. 
</P>
<P>
FRESHMEN: 
</P>
<P>
Adam Henderson -- At 6-10 and 190 pounds, he was all-city this season at Los 
Angeles High School. "He could be the next Larry Nance," Greenberg said, 
referring to the Cleveland Cavalier forward known for his great jumping 
ability. "There aren't too many guys around with his ability. He has a chance 
to be a pro." 
</P>
<P>
Lucious Harris -- From Cleveland High in Reseda and another all-city player, 
Harris is a 6-5 guard who is known as a scorer. 
</P>
<P>
Bryon Russell -- A 6-7 forward from San Bernardino High, Russell scored 28 
points against Glendora High as his team won the CIF Southern Section 4-AA 
title. "A blue-collar worker who likes to rebound," Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the board were the names of players who will be returning from this 
season's team. 
</P>
<P>
The seniors will be point guard Tyrone Mitchell, who was recently named the 
team's player of the year; forward Rudy Harvey, and guards Darrell Faulkner and 
Walker Moore. 
</P>
<P>
There is doubt about the status of another senior-to-be, forward Andre Purry, 
who a year ago was an all-league forward. "In all reality he might not play," 
Harrington said of Purry, who had his knee surgically reconstructed after an 
injury last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Also returning as sophomores will be guards Bobby Sears and Brian Jones. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's Taken Two Years' 
</P>
<P>
Harrington looked at the board and said, "It's taken us two years to put that 
together. A lot of days and nights of recruiting. And we're not done. Two more 
are coming; there's going to be another 6-9 guy." 
</P>
<P>
He likes the competitiveness of his players. 
</P>
<P>
"Cutler, Williams, Jarvis, Joseph, Edwards, Winbush, Jones, Sears and Mitchell 
are straight-out gym rats, they play all day long," he said. "There are guys on 
that board who dream of playing pro basketball. It could be a reality for some 
of them." 
</P>
<P>
Harrington does not promise that the 49ers will become a Top 20 team next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take a couple years for them to mature but you'll see 
improvement next year," he said. "I saw how much our seniors, John Hatten and 
Marco Fleming, improved this year. I know we're doing the right things here. If 
this group improves like they did, I know we'll be very competitive. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to turn it around in college basketball. There are a lot of good 
players, a lot of good teams and a lot of good coaches." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
His Ultimate Goal 
</P>
<P>
Harrington's goal is to get into the NCAA Tournament. "Every athletic director 
wants his team to get there (because) there's a lot of money involved," he 
said. "Being in the tournament also generates so much enthusiasm for a 
program." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the players finally have arrived. But will Harrington always be there 
for them? 
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation that the day is not far away when Harrington -- who 
was named by one publication as one of the five best young coaches in America 
-- will go to a "basketball factory," a university that can offer him 
first-rate facilities and big money. 
</P>
<P>
But he has constantly expressed a fondness for Long Beach -- the school and the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think about leaving," he said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
He looked at the board again and saw the reasons for staying, at least for the 
next couple of seasons.

FOOTBALL COACHES CLINIC ALSO PLANNED; 
</P>
<P>
49ERS' BROWN-GOLD GAME SET SATURDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cal State Long Beach football team will play its annual Brown-Gold 
intra-squad spring game Saturday night at 7:30 at Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with the game, the Long Beach Century Club Coaches Clinic will 
be held from 8 a.m. to 4:40 p.m. at the Marriott Hotel, 4700 Airport Plaza 
Drive. The speakers will include John Robinson, coach of the Rams, and Chuck 
Knox, coach of the Seattle Seahawks. The cost is $30 a person. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers will start their third season under Coach Larry Reisbig on Sept. 2 
when they play host to Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Oates, 23, a former minor league baseball player, is the team's new 
quarterback, replacing Jeff Graham, who threw for 226 yards a game last season. 
</P>
<P>
"He is mobile and has a strong arm," Reisbig said of Oates. "He's a different 
kind of quarterback than Jeff Graham. Paul has the ability to scramble as well 
as drop back and throw,." 
</P>
<P>
Oates' main target will be wide receiver Derek Washington, who led the 49ers in 
catches with 48 last season. 
</P>
<P>
Other top players are running backs Andre Southerland and Jim Bittner, 
offensive tackle Dave McKinnon, linebackers Pepper Jenkins, Mark Ziegenhagen 
and David Riley, defensive tackle Dan Duffy and defensive backs Marc Tourville 
and Keith Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers were 3-9 last season and are 7-16 under Reisbig. 
</P>
<P>
They have 36 returning lettermen and 17 returning starters, nine on offense and 
eight on defense.

from 1978 to 1982, is swamped by Little Leaguers wanting to shake hands or have 
their caps autographed. Jackson threw the first ball at a ceremony marking the 
season opener for the Los Altos Little League, which plays at El Dorado Park in 
Long Beach. Jackson is educational spokesman these days for Charter Hospital of 
Long Beach. "Attitude is really important," he told the youngsters. "If you 
have a good attitude, listen to your coaches and your parents, throw in some 
hard work and get a good education, some of your dreams will come true." BILL

KENDALL MAKING NAME FOR HIMSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sam Farmer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For most of the final hour of the 12 Hours of Sebring two weeks ago, Bart 
Kendall toured the 4 1/2-mile track at a relative crawl to protect his five-lap 
lead and quiet the imaginary engine sputters that haunted him. 
</P>
<P>
But with three laps remaining and Kendall giddy from his imminent International 
Motor Sports Assn. GTU-class victory, he cut loose. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the longest hour of my entire life," said Kendall, who lives in La 
Canada. "I was being so conservative and still hearing (car) noises . . . Once 
I knew I had first place locked up, I drove real hard." 
</P>
<P>
The win, Kendall's first, might mark the turning point in his career, which has 
been overshadowed by that of his younger brother, Tom. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Kendall, a senior at UCLA, has already won three consecutive IMSA 
championships and has now moved up to the Trans-Am series. Tom, however, has 
never won an endurance race on the IMSA circuit. 
</P>
<P>
Any race that is longer than three hours is classified as an endurance race. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to winning the race, Bart Kendall was presented the Norelco Cup, 
which is awarded by the media to the outstanding driver in the GTO- and 
GTU-class. 
</P>
<P>
Kendall was assisted by co-drivers George Robinson and Johnny Unser, cousin of 
defending Long Beach Grand Prix winner Al Unser Jr. One reason for the team's 
success might have been the parity of the drivers. 
</P>
<P>
"All three of us could turn similar lap times," Kendall said. "Whereas the 
other teams had one or two drivers that were stronger and the third was a big 
drop off. We were able to run consistent where other people were fast, then 
slow, then fast." 
</P>
<P>
If only Kendall could find that type of consistency in a sponsor. He had six of 
12 races with a Mazda team last year and raced four times with other sponsors 
but was not provided enough money to finish the season. 
</P>
<P>
Sebring, he says, should push up his stock. 
</P>
<P>
"Now my name is at least on some people's list," he said. "And when my name 
comes up I will have leap-frogged past some people." 
</P>
<P>
Rugaboo: Maybe it was best that the rugby match wasn't played in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Oxy Olde Boys, a team composed mostly of Occidental College alumni, 
will have an easier time forgetting it. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Rugby Football Union Division 2 championship match was 
originally scheduled to be played in the Rose Bowl, but because of insurance 
complications, it took place on the lawn outside. 
</P>
<P>
The Olde Boys held a four-point lead over the Old Aztecs of San Diego State at 
the intermission but lost, 23-10. 
</P>
<P>
The contest was marred by 25 penalties -- 20 called again Occidental. 
</P>
<P>
Bryce Morton, an Olde Boy forward, says he and his teammates took exception to 
many of the calls. 
</P>
<P>
"The referee shouldn't have that much to do with the game," Morton said. "It's 
kind of disheartening that every time you get something going, you get a 
penalty. It was ridiculous. Things that are never called were called." 
</P>
<P>
Occidental will get a shot at redemption at the UC Santa Barbara tournament 
April 8-9. 
</P>
<P>
Said Coach Greg Holmes: "That will soothe some hurt feelings." 
</P>
<P>
Tops in high-tops: Senior basketball players from 22 high schools -- 10 in the 
Glendale area -- will participate in a Glendale/Burbank boys' and girls' 
all-star doubleheader April 1. 
</P>
<P>
The event will be held at Woodbury University in Burbank, and proceeds will 
benefit community sports and recreation facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The girls' game will begin at 6:30 with the boys' game at 8:15. Tickets are $5 
for adults 18 and over, $3 for high school students with identification and $2 
for children under 12. 
</P>
<P>
Teams were selected from recommendations of area coaches. 
</P>
<P>
The boys' team includes Allen Faalnik (Glendale); Chad Blatchley (Glendale); 
Brent Hoxie (Glendale); Aaron Shaw (Marshall); Michael Epps (Eagle Rock); Allen 
Freemon (St. Francis); Tom Parada (St. Francis); Chad Givens (La Canada); Chris 
Jones (La Canada); Greg Thompson (La Canada); Mike Hanson (La Canada); Raffie 
Eskandarian (Crescenta Valley); John Gilmore (Crescenta Valley); Gino Wang 
(Hoover); Maher Noueihed (Hoover); Robert Gonzalez (Hoover); Maurice Lawson 
(Ribet Academy); James Lawson (Ribet); and Charlie Specht (Flintridge Prep).

CRESCENTA VALLEY'S SHANE COWSILL GETS BACK INTO SWING OF THINGS IN LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe Tony Zarrillo should be humming the strains of "Viva Las Vegas." 
</P>
<P>
Viva something, at least. Because until last week, the Crescenta Valley High 
baseball coach figured he had about as much chance of finding his offense as he 
did of finding Elvis Presley. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem was Shane Cowsill. A junior who pitches and plays first 
base for the Falcons, Cowsill hit .390 last season and was named to The Times' 
All-Glendale team. But he got off to a painfully slow start this season, and 
when Crescenta Valley left for last week's Chaparral tournament in Las Vegas, 
Cowsill had just three hits in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
But the hot desert air went a long way toward cracking Cowsill's slump. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, three hits in a tournament is not always cause for jubilation, but 
Zarrillo saw Cowsill making large strides in confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a noticeable change," Zarrillo said. "He looked more comfortable at 
the plate." 
</P>
<P>
Shane isn't the first Cowsill to find comfort in Las Vegas. His father, Paul, 
was a member of the "The Cowsills," a popular bubble-gum rock band in the late 
1960's. The group, composed of eight members of the Cowsill family, was the 
true-life basis for "The Partridge Family" television show and had several hits 
including "Hair," and "The Rain, The Park, and Other Things." 
</P>
<P>
The Cowsills, under contract with the Flamingo Hotel, would spend three months 
a year in Las Vegas during their heyday. 
</P>
<P>
Fans remember. 
</P>
<P>
At one point during a tournament game, Cowsill noticed the first-base umpire 
gawking at the back of his jersey. 
</P>
<P>
"In the middle of a pitch he goes, 'Are you related to the singing Cowsills?' " 
Cowsill said. "I said, 'Paul's my dad.' And he says, 'Oh, wow! Which one is 
he?' He's looking up into the stands and I'm thinking, 'Hey, get in the game, 
bud.' " 
</P>
<P>
Paul Cowsill maintains fond memories of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a good time," he said. "Everything was cool when we were playing 
Vegas." 
</P>
<P>
Everything was cold when Shane was playing L. A. 
</P>
<P>
Cowsill reasons the slump was caused by self-imposed pressure for an encore 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I had to do it all by myself," he said. "And when I think I have to 
do everything by myself, I press and tense up." 
</P>
<P>
Zarrillo, who has talked with Cowsill at length in an attempt to relieve the 
tension, says he might have put too much emphasis on the junior's role, which 
might be expected since Cowsill's 39 runs batted in last season ranked third in 
the Southern Section 4-A division. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone associated with our program expects a great deal from him," Zarrillo 
said. "I think he's learning a lesson. As he gets older and the competition 
gets better, he realizes he has a role to play in the framework of the team. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important that he understand his role but not that the success or failure 
falls squarely upon his shoulders -- it certainly does not." 
</P>
<P>
It seems as if anything short of a Volkswagen could rest comfortably on 
Cowsill's shoulders, however. His 6-foot-3, 220-pound frame is 
less-than-svelte. 
</P>
<P>
Zarrillo says Cowsill will have to redistribute his bulk with a steady weight 
program to be most effective. "He will make his mark as a good hitter and good 
defensive first baseman," he said. "But he's never going to lead your team in 
stolen bases." 
</P>
<P>
Cowsill's size and soft hands made him a natural tight end on the football 
team. Though 1988 was his first year of organized football, and a broken hand 
abruptly ended his season, he was given serious All-Pacific League 
consideration by the league's coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"He can certainly play in college," Crescenta Valley football Coach Jim 
Beckenhauer said. "His hands are as good as a wide receiver's." 
</P>
<P>
Cowsill displayed those hands on an out pattern against South Pasadena. He 
leaped above a pack of defenders and snagged a pass, and when he landed he was 
popped soundly but held onto the ball. The play, Cowsill recollects, covered 25 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where I think he came of age," Beckenhauer said. "He took a tremendous 
hit and made it look easy. 
</P>
<P>
"Once he learns, he'll be a load because he's got that frame that can really 
move some bodies." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to football, Cowsill had a stint with the basketball team, but 
decided not to play when the season began to impinge on baseball. 
</P>
<P>
For Cowsill, all sports are second to baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"Shane's got a plan in his head and he hasn't really veered from it yet," said 
Paul, who now works as a free-lance contractor and coaches a Babe Ruth League 
baseball team. "He's all baseball."

CULVER CITY MAYOR'S VIEW; 
</P>
<P>
RESIDENTS MAY PAY MORE FOR SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Culver City residents may have to pay more if they want to continue enjoying 
the current level of city services, Mayor Paul A. Jacobs said this week. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a luncheon crowd of nearly 400 at the Veterans Memorial Auditorium 
on Tuesday, Jacobs said that if there is to be less commercial development, as 
residents seem to want, then residents will have to fill the gap in the city's 
general fund budget. 
</P>
<P>
With a fluctuating economy, the city must become less dependent on sales, hotel 
and other non-resident taxes as major sources of revenue if residents expect to 
maintain current city services, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to be less consumer-oriented and more service-oriented," Jacobs said. 
"The sales tax is the yoke around our collective necks." 
</P>
<P>
City officials estimate that 65% of the city's $34 million in general fund 
revenues comes from businesses, raised through sales, utility user and hotel 
occupancy taxes. They estimate that taxes and fees paid by residents account 
for 25% of revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city faced a deficit and increased some fees and taxes, 
including the utility user tax, to balance the budget. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
User Fee Increase 
</P>
<P>
Projected revenues for the 1989-90 are about $2 million less than anticipated 
expenditures. City officials are likely to raise more user fees to balance the 
budget, city officials said, although no specific fees have been identified. 
</P>
<P>
Many other cities facing a shortage of traditional sources of revenues also are 
turning to increased fees for city services to balance their budgets. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, for example, Beverly Hills reviewed all fees for city services to 
determine which ones could be increased. Increasing fees for such services as 
fire inspections, recreational programs and building permits is expected to 
raise an additional $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Don Oblander, Beverly Hills finance director, said cities are trying to 
recapture the cost of city services from residents who actually use the 
services instead of taxing everyone. 
</P>
<P>
In Culver City, Jacobs said residents have been lucky to have businesses raise 
most of the general fund revenues through business permits and hotel occupancy, 
property and utility user taxes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Free Ride' 
</P>
<P>
"We have been getting a free ride," Jacobs said in an interview after his 
speech. "As residents, we have enjoyed for a long time a good part of the bill 
being paid by non-residential taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
"Ideally, I would like to see the residents pay nothing and have the commercial 
side pay 100%. But realistically, if and when these sources of revenues are 
reduced, we must become prepared to fill that gap. I'm trying now to prepare 
the community to be sensitive to the budget constraints." 
</P>
<P>
At the luncheon were members of local civic and service groups, homeowners' 
associations, social service organizations and business owners. It is these 
leaders, Jacobs said, that must help prepare the community for the shift in 
revenue sources. 
</P>
<P>
"The time has come to send a message," Jacobs said. "Without that kind of 
leadership we are not going to make the kind of changes we need to."

WAVES HOT AND COLD IN BIG GAMES; 
</P>
<P>
BUT WITH THEIR 4 TOP SCORERS BACK FOR '89, PEPPERDINE LOOKS TO TURN UP THE HEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pepperdine's play in the last two basketball games of the season -- against New 
Mexico State and then the University of New Mexico in National Invitation 
Tournament road games -- mirrored the way the team often performed in big 
games. 
</P>
<P>
But the reflected images were sharply different. 
</P>
<P>
In probably their best game of the year, the Waves easily defeated New Mexico 
State, 84-69, in the first round of the NIT. 
</P>
<P>
Against the Aggies, they jumped out to a 7-0 lead, shared the ball and received 
balanced scoring from the regulars. They shot well (57%), controlled the tempo 
against a tough defense, extended their lead to 72-43 with 3:41 remaining and 
coasted home. 
</P>
<P>
In a second-round 86-69 loss to New Mexico, Pepperdine's performance was 
similar to that of the first-round game -- but in reverse. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves fell behind, 15-5, played as individuals rather than as a team, and a 
couple of players wound up doing much of the scoring. Pepperdine shot poorly 
(37.7%), was controlled by a strong defense, fell behind by as many as 17 
points late in the game and never got untracked. 
</P>
<P>
There were games, of course, that fit neither of those patterns -- games in 
which neither Pepperdine nor its opponent dominated from the outset. But there 
were at least five other contests against top opposition in which the Waves 
took charge early and five more against quality teams in which Pepperdine was 
led around by the nose. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine dictated what went on in road wins over UC Irvine and Marshall and 
in home victories over Santa Clara, the University of San Francisco and Loyola 
Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves also were easy pickings in losses at Nevada Las Vegas, Loyola 
Marymount, St. Mary's and Santa Clara and in a defeat at home by North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
But it still turned out to be Pepperdine's best season since Coach Jim 
Harrick's 1985-86 Waves finished with a 25-5 record. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988-89 Waves were 20-13, tied Loyola Marymount for second place in the 
West Coast Athletic Conference and were 1-1 in the conference tournament. 
</P>
<P>
In the NIT they won their first postseason game since Harrick's 1982 team 
defeated Pittsburgh, 99-88, in the first round of the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine was one of four WCAC teams to finish with 20 victories or more, the 
first time that happened in conference history. The other three were St. Mary's 
(25-5), Loyola Marymount (20-11) and Santa Clara (20-11), and all four won 
berths in postseason play, another conference first. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves accomplished all that under a head coach in his first year, Tom 
Asbury, who succeeded Harrick after he was named UCLA's coach. Asbury, 
Harrick's top assistant at Pepperdine for nine years, also installed a new 
offense, going from a high-post to a low-post attack. 
</P>
<P>
The change from a familiar offensive set may have caused difficulties for a few 
players, at least during the early part of the season, but Asbury said the 
change was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no way we could have run the same offense we had in the past and 
still have been productive," he said. "If we hadn't, we couldn't have played 
(senior center Casey) Crawford and (freshman forward-center Geoff) Lear at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
In explaining the switch before the season, Asbury said: 
</P>
<P>
"When guys like Crawford play the high post, they have difficulty being a force 
offensively because all they are are catchers and passers. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to get our big guys closer to the basket to do the things they are 
physically more capable of doing. Most big men have difficulty scoring from 15 
or 16 feet and (in a low-post offense) they should also increase their 
rebounding because they'll be closer." 
</P>
<P>
The new offense seemed to work for Crawford and Lear. 
</P>
<P>
After averaging five points and 5.5 rebounds as an occasional starter last 
year, Crawford led the team in rebounding as a regular this season with a 7.5 
average and averaged eight points a game. He also led the team with 43 blocked 
shots and was dominating inside in several games. 
</P>
<P>
Lear, who played more than 19 minutes a game, averaged five points and nearly 
five rebounds -- not bad production for a freshman who saw limited playing 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Asbury said that if someone had told him before the season that the Waves would 
do as well as they did "I would have taken it. By the same token, there were a 
number of games I would like to have had back too." 
</P>
<P>
He said that "no coach is ever fully satisfied unless his team goes 31-0," but 
added that his team's losses were not to patsies. Of the teams that defeated 
the Waves, only Montana State and USF did not win 20 games or more, he noted. 
Montana State won by three points in Pepperdine's second game of the season, 
and USF edged the Waves by one point at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"We probably didn't shoot the ball (as well) as we had hoped," Asbury added. 
The Waves shot 45.7%, compared to 51.5% last season. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting percentages of Asbury's three junior starters also dropped. 
Forward Tom Lewis went from 49.5% to 42.2%, guard Craig Davis from 49.3% to 
42.3%, and forward Dexter Howard, after a hot streak in the early going, from 
53.4% to 49.6%. 
</P>
<P>
"People figure out ways to stop your high scorers in league -- and not only in 
league," Asbury said. "My goal was to balance the scoring out anyway; I wasn't 
interested in Lewis leading the nation in scoring." 
</P>
<P>
Asbury got the balance he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, after leading the conference in scoring with 23 points a game last year, 
averaged a team-high 16.2 points this season. Howard averaged 15.9, Davis 12.5 
and Shann Ferch 10.2. Junior Ferch is the heir apparent to senior point guard 
Marty Wilson, the only other starter besides Crawford that Asbury will lose. 
</P>
<P>
Asbury said that he is "not a big preseason prognosticator" and would say only 
that "we are going to be decent" next year. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, Howard, Davis and Ferch will probably start, and eventually so will 
6-10, 250-pound center Mark Georgeson, the transfer from Arizona who has 2 1/2 
seasons of eligibility remaining. But Georgeson probably won't play his first 
game for Pepperdine until sometime next January because he transferred in the 
middle of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Asbury also said that Georgeson suffered a stress fracture of a small bone in 
his right foot in practice, for which he may need surgery. Even if the center 
has surgery, he said, he should be ready by January. 
</P>
<P>
Until Georgeson is ready, 6-9 sophomore Damon Braly and 6-8 David Hairston will 
probably take up some of the slack for him. 
</P>
<P>
Asbury said that Georgeson is a "better offensive player" than Crawford. "He is 
a good shooter and passer, and handles the ball well for a big guy. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark doesn't have Casey's speed, quickness or shot-blocking and jumping 
ability. But I think he's going to be a real solid player." 
</P>
<P>
He also expects solid play from redshirt forwards Steve Guild, a freshman, and 
Rex Manu, a junior, and from freshman guard Doug Christie, who was academically 
ineligible this season under Proposition 48. He said another good addition 
should be 6-9 forward Derek Noether, a senior at Clovis West High School in 
Fresno who signed an early letter of intent. Freshman Rick Welch, who played 
well, if briefly, this season, should push Ferch at point guard, and there is a 
high school point guard in Glendale, Ariz., that Asbury would like to see in a 
Pepperdine uniform next season. 
</P>
<P>
Asbury said he is in what looks like a race with Arizona State and Texas El 
Paso to sign 5-9 Damon Lopez, who played for his father at Apollo High School. 
</P>
<P>
He said Lopez is "a true point guard who can run the offense" and "really shoot 
the ball."

AZUSA BOXER TRIES TO STAY OFF DRUGS, WIN A WBC TITLE 
</P>

<P>
QUAIL VALLEY, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Attention screenwriters: Check out Bob Richardson and Paul Banke. As boxing's 
odd couple, it works. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson, 40, is a prosperous roofing contractor (200 employees) but is 
hooked on boxing. He runs an old-fashioned stable of fighters in the bouldered 
hills of western Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
Banke, 25, is a promising bantamweight, a little slugger who is a headliner at 
the Forum. He also admits he has a drug problem, and Richardson requires him to 
live on-site at the training camp and undergo unannounced, weekly drug tests. 
</P>
<P>
Theme: 
</P>
<P>
These guys love and hate each other. They have been seen embracing each other, 
and screaming at each other. Richardson: "I've threatened a dozen times to give 
him the heave-ho, but I don't think I could do it, and he knows I couldn't do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Plot point: 
</P>
<P>
Up for grabs right now. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson sat inside his motor home at his Quail Valley boxing compound and 
watched a landscaper with a tape measure take notes while studying the bare 
ground at his boxing compound. 
</P>
<P>
"They're coming in with rolls of grass in a couple of days, we'll finally have 
something green to look at here," he said. Then he shook his head at the 
thought of the bills. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife keeps asking me why I keep putting money into this operation. I've 
sunk about $350,000 in this operation, and I don't know if I'll ever break 
even." 
</P>
<P>
Richardson calls his boxing business All-Heart Boxing. He manages, trains, 
feeds, houses and generally nursemaids boxers. It all started when he was just 
a fan. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to go to the fight shows in Riverside with my employees," he said. "I'd 
buy 30 and 40 tickets per show. I met a few fighters, and got to know Al Long, 
my welterweight. He wasn't happy with his manager, so I offered to take him 
over, not really knowing what a boxing manager was supposed to do." 
</P>
<P>
Long, 26, is one of four All-Heart boxers. He's the No. 1-ranked International 
Boxing Federation welterweight and meets champion Simon Brown April 27 at 
London. 
</P>
<P>
Heavyweight Levi Billups, 27, cast adrift when the United States Football 
League folded five years ago (he was a Los Angeles Express linebacker), is a 
former California heavyweight champion and may be George Foreman's next 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Russell Mitchell, 31, is a Richardson junior-middleweight. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's Banke. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, he was a successful amateur flyweight in Azusa. He was 
thought to be a candidate for the 1984 U.S. Olympic team but lost to eventual 
gold medalist Steve McCrory in the Olympic trials. Being a slugger more than a 
boxer, Banke all along looked like a better pro prospect than an Olympic 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
"Paul was 12-3 when I bought his contract for $1,000," Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew he had a drug history, I went in with my eyes open. But I also thought 
he had a lot of talent, that he could go places if he was guided right. And I 
knew that deep down he wanted to put his drug problem behind him. 
</P>
<P>
"Right away, we got into some big arguments. I told him when he started with me 
that I didn't think he was in good boxing shape, that he would kick . . . for 
three or four rounds, then run out of gas. 
</P>
<P>
"We argued about that at first, but I convinced him I was right. 
</P>
<P>
"We also got into some big arguments over drugs. In the beginning, before I 
invested a whole lot of time in Paul, I gave him every opportunity to tell me 
to . . . and leave. But he never did. We yell at each other for a few minutes, 
and that's the end of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, anyone who sees him at the Forum will tell you he's as well-conditioned 
as anyone who regularly fights there." 
</P>
<P>
All-Heart boxers run every morning along a hilly 6.2-mile course near Canyon 
Lake. Richardson calls it quality running, not road work. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't just put in time, they train to beat their best times on the 
course," Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Paul's best time now for the course is 36 minutes 18 seconds, which is a 
little better than a six-minutes-per-mile pace." 
</P>
<P>
Banke is a month away from his dream: A world title fight. On April 25, at the 
Forum, he meets Mexico's Daniel Zaragoza, the World Boxing Council's 
super-bantamweight champion. The WBC ranks Banke eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Banke has become a Forum headliner. He won $100,000 for winning the Forum's 
super-bantamweight tournament championship a year ago, and is a favorite of 
Forum owner Jerry Buss. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson keeps his fingers crossed, knocks on wood and isn't taking bets yet 
. . . but he thinks Banke may have turned his back on the drug scene. 
</P>
<P>
Banke lives in his own trailer, with his girlfriend, at Richardson's compound. 
And he's confined to quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Banke banks most of his boxing income; Richardson pays him a $100 weekly 
salary. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been clean for over 60 days, and for him that's great," Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I require him to live here, and that if he leaves he must let me know where 
he's going and exactly when he's coming back. I (drug) test him every week, and 
he goes to weekly meetings in Redlands." 
</P>
<P>
Richardson's boxing compound is on 2 1/2 acres of a hillside, a few miles west 
of Interstate 15. In what was once a print shop building, Richardson has built 
a kitchen, small dormitory and gym. 
</P>
<P>
He walks around the compound, carrying a cellular telephone, attending to the 
details of running a boxing stable -- from ordering jumbo jars of peanut butter 
to negotiating for future fight dates. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife and I were married four years ago and in that time, we've probably 
spent a total of six months together," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I even wind up spending a lot of weekends out here, just cleaning up the 
place. My wife actually runs my roofing business." 
</P>
<P>
Even in Banke's amateur days, coaches gave up trying to turn him into a boxer. 
He's a slugger, a pure, flatfooted, leads-with-his-face puncher. 
</P>
<P>
He sets up like a boxer, though, hands held high, against the cheekbones. Guys 
such as Banke used to be introduced by ring announcers as " . . . and in the 
red corner, never in a dull fight . . . " 
</P>
<P>
In his last appearance, a Jan. 9 brawl against Ramiro Adames in the Forum, 
Banke left them standing and cheering for more after an exciting sixth-round 
TKO victory. 
</P>
<P>
Going into his title bout against Zaragoza, he is 17-3 with 10 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the success in the ring, he has struggled with drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"It all started after I won my third pro fight, in Las Vegas," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I came home, to Azusa, and for the first time in my life I had real money in 
my pocket, about $1,500. I went to a party to celebrate and got involved with 
some bad stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"It became the thing to do. I kept telling myself I wasn't addicted, but I 
was." 
</P>
<P>
After his first six pro bouts, Banke tried to run away from his drug problem. 
He moved to Blythe, but the climate was not any better. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the same . . . drugs were just as prevalent there. I knew I had a real 
problem, then. And I knew it was a problem I couldn't run away from." 
</P>
<P>
Banke, after having gone through two managers, was hired by Richardson as a 
sparring partner for his bantamweight at the time, Jorge Diaz. Banke turned 
Diaz inside out, and Richardson signed Banke. 
</P>
<P>
Banke has won five straight since he was stopped in the seventh round by Jesus 
Poll a year ago at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a guy I want again, Poll," Banke said. "That was when I wasn't taking 
care of myself, I wasn't in good shape. Since then, Bob has shown me I have to 
pay the price." 
</P>
<P>
Banke blames some of his problems on amateur boxing. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1983 and '84, I was concentrating so much on making the Olympic team, I 
almost stopped going to school (Azusa High School). I traveled to nine 
countries my senior year, and never did get a diploma." 
</P>
<P>
He was asked if beating Zaragoza would make up for not making the 1984 Olympic 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"That's hard to say," he said. "I cried so hard when Steve McCrory beat me in 
the trials that year. The only satisfaction I have now is that McCrory won the 
gold medal, so I can always say it took a gold medalist to keep me off the 
Olympic team." 
</P>
<P>
Of his relationship with Richardson, Banke described it pretty much as 
Richardson does. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it's like a father-son relationship, or it's like we're pals," he 
said. "But at other times, it's like we're enemies, when we're yelling at each 
other."

MAGAZINES: MORAL DEBATE RAGES OVER WRITERS WHO EXPLOIT HUMAN TRAGEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Some murder cases don't die. They become the source of endless literary 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
For most of this month, journalistic tongues have been wagging over a two-part 
article by Janet Malcolm in New Yorker magazine in which Malcolm -- after 
investigating the tangled aftermath of a celebrated multiple homicide -- 
castigated her colleagues for "preying on people's vanity, ignorance or 
loneliness, gaining their trust and betraying them without remorse." 
</P>
<P>
Titled "Reflections: The Journalist and the Murderer," Malcolm's 40,000 words 
have provoked a barrage of rebuttal, including an editorial in the New York 
Times and an expose on Malcolm in New York magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The argument, interestingly enough, is based on a Southern California court 
case that was largely ignored by the East Coast press at the time it occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm's chief contention is that journalists lull their subjects with 
displays of false camaraderie and -- after those naive subjects bare their 
souls -- turn on them by writing stories that are unflattering and often 
vicious. 
</P>
<P>
In her opening paragraph, Malcolm wrote, "Every journalist who is not too 
stupid or too full of himself to notice what is going on knows that what he 
does is morally indefensible. . . . Like the credulous widow who wakes up one 
day to find the charming young man and all her savings gone, so the consenting 
subject of a piece of nonfiction writing learns -- when the article or book 
appears -- his hard lesson." 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm's jumping-off point for this and other sweeping pronouncements was a 
lawsuit filed in 1984 by convicted murderer and former Green Beret Dr. Jeffrey 
MacDonald against writer Joe McGinniss, author of "Fatal Vision," a book -- and 
later a television miniseries -- about MacDonald and the murder of his wife and 
two young daughters Feb. 17, 1970. In the suit, MacDonald, who once practiced 
in Long Beach, charged that McGinniss had strung him along by pretending to 
believe that he was innocent, all the while writing a book that portrayed the 
former Army doctor as a psychopathic killer. The suit was tried in federal 
court in Los Angeles in 1987 and resulted in a mistrial. McGinniss, in a move 
that shocked many, later settled out of court with MacDonald, agreeing to pay 
him $325,000, rather than endure a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the trial -- and most of Malcolm's charges -- hinged on letters 
McGinniss wrote to MacDonald in prison in which McGinniss constantly reassured 
MacDonald with sympathetic comments. At the trial in Los Angeles, a number of 
witnesses, including columnist and author William F. Buckley and crime writer 
and novelist Joseph Wambaugh, testified that misleading or lying to subjects 
about their true feelings was an acceptable technique for writers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Got What He Deserves 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm concludes that McGinniss got what he deserved; that has provoked the 
outraged response to her articles. 
</P>
<P>
New York magazine contributing editor John Taylor got off the most telling blow 
in an article in the March 27 issue. Taylor reported that in preparing a New 
Yorker profile of psychoanalyst Jeffrey Masson, Malcolm had engaged in many of 
the same tactics for which she vilified McGinniss. 
</P>
<P>
Wrote Taylor: "Like McGinniss, she (Malcolm) acquired the trust of her subject 
("have a little faith," she told him at one point). Like McGinniss, she 
exploited the confidences her subject revealed. Like McGinniss, she portrayed 
her subject as a sort of monster. Like McGinniss, she left him feeling utterly 
betrayed. And, like McGinniss, she was sued." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor also reported that in Malcolm's article on Masson, "a number of 
quotations were not on Malcolm's tapes or in her handwritten notes." 
</P>
<P>
But he also noted that Malcolm successfully defended herself, with a federal 
court in San Francisco ruling that "there was an absence of malice and that 
'(t)he inclusion of quotation marks in a passage does not require complete 
accuracy; a writer may resort to rhetorical license.' " 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Taylor said there "has not been a letter or phone 
call from the New Yorker" contradicting his article. In his story, Taylor wrote 
that Malcolm did not reply "to numerous messages and requests for an 
interview." (Masson's suit against Malcolm is being appealed, and a New Yorker 
representative said the magazine would not comment until the case is finally 
settled.) 
</P>
<P>
Like others who have read Malcolm's article about McGinniss and MacDonald, 
Taylor said he was captivated by it. "I think the New Yorker's great . . . and 
I think Janet Malcolm is a very profound writer and her piece is very profound 
though skewed," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increasingly Puzzled 
</P>
<P>
But as he read the two installments, Taylor said he became increasingly puzzled 
because Malcolm never mentioned her clash with Masson despite its obvious 
parallels. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor speculated that Malcolm's examination of how journalists work struck a 
chord because "journalists, like most people, don't examine why they do what 
they do" and the article "really set people thinking." 
</P>
<P>
In the latest salvo on Malcolm, Washington Post critic Jonathan Yardley filed a 
commentary this week in which he made the distinction between journalists who 
ply their trade daily or weekly and nonfiction writers who turn out blockbuster 
books. 
</P>
<P>
Yardley concluded that "Janet Malcolm's exploration of this question is flawed 
in numerous ways, not least of them her reliance on precisely the amateur 
psychologizing she so deplores in McGinniss, but her essential arguments are 
sound and important. There is nothing sacred about the cynical process by which 
real human calamities are turned into blockbuster books; it is business pure 
and simple, not very pretty business at that, and it deserves exposure as 
precisely what it is." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps overlooked in this debate is one remarkable fact -- the murders that 
led to it happened more than 19 years ago. That they are still the ultimate 
source of news is due largely to the almost inhuman persistence of MacDonald, 
who continues to proclaim his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
In a prescient passage in "Fatal Vision," McGinniss quoted one of his sources 
as saying that MacDonald is "never going to accept his guilt. He's never going 
to just sit in jail. . . . The case is never going to be in a posture where he 
just quietly sits in jail and lets the years roll by." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Merger Consequences? 
</P>
<P>
Now that the initial spate of publicity over the merger of Time Inc. and Warner 
Communications Inc. has died down, Media Industry Newsletter, an insider's 
newsletter, has weighed in with some second thoughts. Among other things, the 
newsletter's anonymous authors wonder if film-TV giant Warner might not find 
magazines a bit passe 
</P>
<P>
"Is it too remote to imagine the 'entertainment power bloc' in the combined 
companies looking at magazine publishing as an anachronism in their new world 
of global film-TV-cable interests?" the newsletter asks. "If entertainment is 
TWI's new 'core' business, how long will the news and information print 
properties be looked upon favorably?" 
</P>
<P>
Good questions.

SOCIETY: FIRST-NIGHTERS STEP OUT IN STYLE AFTER BALLET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It isn't every day that a guy gets the chance to play lead cockroach in a 
Broadway production of Kafka's "The Metamorphosis," which is why Mikhail 
Baryshnikov, who always attends the opening-night gala when his American Ballet 
Theatre comes to San Diego, was not among those attending Monday's 
post-performance bash at the U. S. Grant Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Dunham, who danced the Odette/Odile role in the company's brand-new 
production of "Swan Lake," stood in successfully for the absent artistic 
director. Although she tried to tiptoe innocuously into the Grant's Grand 
Ballroom, where about 230 supporters of the San Diego Performances presenting 
organization had arrived shortly after the final curtain at the Civic Theatre, 
Dunham found a welcoming committee stationed in the doorway. 
</P>
<P>
The group consisted of six girls -- all dancers, and all alumnae of the San 
Francisco Ballet's local presentation of "The Nutcracker" last December -- who 
served as junior hostesses in return for the opportunity to ambush Dunham. 
Armed with pens and ear-to-ear grins, they giggled excitedly as Dunham 
dutifully scribbled her autograph on their toe shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Most guests may have been unaware of the fact, but dinner chairman Iris Strauss 
planned the buffet supper menu around the needs of Dunham and her fellow 
dancers. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand that they're very hungry after they perform and have special 
needs, so I ordered plenty of carbohydrates," said Strauss, whose menu included 
Scandinavian gravad lax salmon, roast veal and pasta salad. In specific 
reference to the performance, the kitchen whipped up a dessert of meringue 
swans stuffed, most unusually, with peanut butter mousse. 
</P>
<P>
"The dancers add an aura, a glamour to the event, an electricity to the air 
that permeates everything, and I wanted to make sure they were well fed," 
Strauss said. 
</P>
<P>
"Each dancer adds a different dimension to the party," said Linda Platt, who 
shared overall gala chairmanship duties with Sandy Levinson and who, in the 
interest of mingling, saw to it that a pair of dancers was assigned to each 
table. Platt and Levinson also tossed as much lavender into the table decor as 
it was capable of absorbing, as a tribute to the astonishing color that was 
used almost exclusively in the ballet's first act. Fat lavender ribbons tied 
bags that held the commemorative T-shirts donated as party favors by 
Baryshnikov Bodywear, a division of San Diego's Weekend Exercise Co. 
</P>
<P>
The clothing firm, owned by Sandy and Arthur Levinson, fully underwrote the 
gala, the first major fund-raiser given for the benefit of San Diego 
Performances, the youthful presenting organization that is midway through its 
second year in show biz. Suzanne Townsend, founder of San Diego Performances, 
said: "Our goal is just to get a lot of people out to the ballet. We're getting 
more and more support, and I don't know a better vehicle for generating 
excitement than the American Ballet Theatre." 
</P>
<P>
Townsend's assessment of the draw generated by the American Ballet seemed hard 
to challenge, especially in light of the fact that more than 200 San Diegans 
agreed to return to a hotel ballroom after 11 p.m. -- and in black tie on a 
Monday night. Even more surprising, there was no sensation of dine-and-dash in 
the air; most of the crowd seemed in a mood to linger over its meringue swans, 
and quite a few made more than one circuit of the dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
The American Ballet dancers, energized by the performance and refueled by pasta 
salad, likewise took advantage of the sentimental standards offered up by the 
Dick Braun Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
The fur may fly at the Acatemy Awards, the centerpiece of the third annual Fur 
Ball, which will be given at the U. S. Grant Hotel on Friday, April 7, as a 
benefit for the San Diego Humane Society. 
</P>
<P>
Morris the Cat and Spuds McKenzie have turned out for previous fur balls. This 
year, the top dog will be Alex, who helps sell suds and spread good will for 
the Stroh Brewing Co. Other pooches and felines will compete for votes in 
several categories, and the Humane Society expects that raw passions may be 
unleashed if the competition is close. 
</P>
<P>
The event will commence at 6 p.m. and feature hors d'oeuvres, door prizes and 
dancing to Soul Patrol. The dress code calls for business attire. Tickets cost 
$20 a person. For further information, call the San Diego Humane Society.

ERMA BOMBECK: WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF WEAPONRY

<P>
One of the funniest parts of a James Bond film is when the home office outfits 
him with enough gimmicky weapons to stock an arsenal. Briefcases harboring 
knives, cuff links holding cyanide pills, fountain pens with gas and cars that 
release oil slicks are all part of Bond's survival. It boggles the imagination. 
You just know they are going to get him out of any situation. It's the movies. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the real world of "Jamie" Bond -- the woman of the '80s, a time when 
trends are becoming too shocking to parody and too real to be funny. Imagine 
her getting these instructions: 
</P>
<P>
"Here is your little bitty Ladysmith gun, new from Smith &amp; Wesson. It comes 
with a pastel grip in glossy blue or frosted sterling. From Texas is a designer 
handbag with a special compartment for your gun so it won't roll around in the 
bottom with breath mints and loose powder. 
</P>
<P>
"For cocktail parties, there is an evening bag to accommodate a 5-inch-long 
barrel with optional gold straps and a touch of snakeskin. 
</P>
<P>
"Try this on for size. Out of New York, it's your bulletproof sable coat that 
is so lightweight you'll never realize it has a Kevlar lining. Hang onto it. We 
wouldn't want it to fall into the wrong hands. Also, the price tag is in the 
high five digits. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, there's your key ring with the little light and an innocent-looking 
button that will Mace the face of anyone who threatens you. If you have any 
questions, you can call the toll-free hotline for more information on your 
protection needs." 
</P>
<P>
Is Jamie off on an adventure to an exotic foreign country where evil people are 
constructing a bomb to destroy the United States? Actually, she's off to the 
mall to have her hair done. 
</P>
<P>
All of these items are real and are designed to give women an advantage over 
the criminals in this country. Before I become what has been characterized as a 
"Rambette," I want to know how far I have to go. Will I wear earrings with 
small cameras to photograph my attackers? Fake fingernails that release 
short-range missiles? Push a shopping cart that converts to a tank? Wear a bra 
that contains a parachute? How about a perfume atomizer that paralyzes its 
victims? Detonators disguised as water pills? Or a belt buckle that houses an 
automatic? 
</P>
<P>
If I thought for one moment that the world would be a safer place if we all 
mobilized and armed, I'd volunteer as a poster child for a cannon on every 
lawn. But I worry. I worry that after a while I won't be able to tell the 
difference between the enemy and me.

ART BUCHWALD: JUST PUT A WARNING LABEL ON EVERYTHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
I woke up this morning and thought I'd eat an orange. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you sure you want to do that?" my wife asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Why not?" 
</P>
<P>
"They could be from Chile. Somebody from Chile wants to kill us." 
</P>
<P>
"You're right. I think I'll have an apple instead." 
</P>
<P>
She threw herself down on her knees. "Please don't eat an apple. What will 
happen to all of us if you eat an apple?" 
</P>
<P>
"How selfish of me," I said. "I have no right to consume an apple when so many 
people depend on me. Any late bulletins on shredded wheat?" 
</P>
<P>
"None so far, but that doesn't mean the milk doesn't have pesticides in it. I 
read an article the other day that cows were ingesting all kinds of poisons in 
their foods. You'd be a fool to take a chance." 
</P>
<P>
"Then I'll have a slice of bread and a cup of coffee." 
</P>
<P>
My wife told me, "Marie Hawke says coffee causes cancer in rats." 
</P>
<P>
"Has she ever seen a rat with cancer?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, but Geraldo Rivera has, and he showed the rat on TV the other night." 
</P>
<P>
"So much for breakfast. I guess I'll be off to work." 
</P>
<P>
"You're not going to drive on the beltway?" she gasped. 
</P>
<P>
"What's wrong with that?" 
</P>
<P>
"There is 10 times as much hazardous waste being transported on the highway now 
as there was two years ago. One trailer spill and you'll be in cruise control 
with the angels." 
</P>
<P>
"That's not a very comforting thought. But we can't be intimidated by hazardous 
waste trucks. They would like nothing more than for us to stay home so that 
they can have the highways to themselves." 
</P>
<P>
I put on my driving gloves. 
</P>
<P>
"Suppose you get shot," she cried, blocking the door with her body. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to get shot," I assured her. "Nobody wants to shoot me." 
</P>
<P>
"It's happening to people in Washington every day. Don't you ever watch Dan 
Rather on television?" 
</P>
<P>
"The odds are still in my favor. I'm going to stay out of the neighborhoods 
where the shooting takes place." 
</P>
<P>
"So let's say you make it to the office. What about the asbestos in your 
ceiling?" she asked. "Doesn't that make you think twice about going to work?" 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in a new building. It's been inspected." 
</P>
<P>
"What are your plans for the lunch hour?" 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure yet, why?" 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever you do don't take a flight to Europe. The PLO is threatening to 
hijack a plane." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad you warned me. I probably would have flown to Shannon for corned beef 
and cabbage. Anything else I should be on the lookout for?" 
</P>
<P>
"The air is supposed to be foul today. I wouldn't go jogging if I were you, and 
don't stare at your computer screen too long or you'll go blind." 
</P>

YOUR COINS: GRADING STILL A PROBLEM FOR COLLECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON ALPERT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: In 1984, '85 and '86, I purchased many silver dollars and 50-cent 
coins from a local dealer. Every one was graded 65/65 by ANACS (American 
Numismatic Assn. Certification Service), and I received a "pedigree" for each, 
complete with picture and coin number. Last week I visited the same dealer and 
was told: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The ANACS rating is no longer operative. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It would cost $45 per coin to have them regraded. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If -- only if -- the new grade is 65/65, the coins would be worth just 
about half what I paid for them. 
</P>
<P>
Should I have them regraded? Have I been taken? What do you suggest? -- P.S. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Grading services came into being precisely to prevent situations such 
as you've described. Unfortunately, problems have not been totally eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, I heard about an early dollar that was submitted to one grading 
service recently and it was dubbed an MS-58. A second grading service called it 
an MS-65. Graded MS-58, it was a $4,000 coin. Graded MS-65, it was worth 
$50,000. 
</P>
<P>
As a rule of thumb, coin dealers believe coins graded by ANACS during 1984, '85 
and '86 were off about two grades. If so, your MS 65/65 silver dollars may 
actually be only 63/63. If so, they're only worth about $50 each. It's quite 
possible that the dealer sold them to you in good faith and that you both 
relied upon the grading service to determine a fair price. 
</P>
<P>
ANACS has recently restructured its grading practices and has teamed with the 
Professional Numismatists Guild in order to standardize industry practices. The 
Professional Coin Grading Service and Numismatic Guaranty Corp. of America are 
other leading services. Each has its own fee schedule and following. 
</P>
<P>
Should you have your coins regraded? Possibly. Get several opinions. If you 
decide to regrade, submit only one or two coins at a time to decide if it's 
worthwhile. You might want to try more than one service. The results may be 
surprising. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have some old coins and would like to know if they have any value. They 
include a large American cent, 1851; an 1895 U.S. nickel; 1955 gold piastre, 
Republique Libanaise; 1 new penny, 1976, Elizabeth II on the reverse; 1918 
Canada 1 cent; 1944 cinco centavos; seven Buffalo nickels; 1892 half dollar, 
World's Columbian Exposition; 1877 trade dollar, and two 1922 silver dollars 
and one dated 1923. -- R.V.A. 
</P>
<P>
A: Your large cent is worth about $4; the Liberty head nickel is $1; the 
Lebanon gold is $75; the new penny has little or no value; the 1918 Canadian 
cent is 50 cents; the centavo has little or no value; the Buffalo nickels are 7 
cents each; the Columbus commemorative is $7; the trade dollar is $50, and the 
silver dollars are $8 each. Prices will vary with condition.

HE WASN'T 'BORN' UNTIL HE TURNED 22 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>

Moon Palace by Paul Auster (Viking: $18.95; 286 pages) 
</P>
<P>
Marco Fogg's life began, he tells us, roughly at the point where "Moon Palace" 
ends. The narrator's "birth" takes place at the age of 22, after he uses up 
five pairs of boots walking across the Southwest desert, arrives at Laguna 
Beach and sees the moon rise over the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
All that goes before -- the novel itself -- is prenatal, in other words. It 
feels a bit that way, like an unsubstantial reverie of life before birth. 
</P>
<P>
A man doesn't properly begin to live, according to a drastic simplification of 
one of Freud's tenets, until he has sought his father out and symbolically 
killed him. "Moon Palace's" potential exuberance is constrained and sometimes 
neutralized by the tenet's excessive control. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the adventures that Marco relates revolve about locating -- through 
the broadest of coincidences -- not only his father but his grandfather, as 
well. And then, lovingly and with no hard feelings on either side, killing them 
both by approximate mischance. 
</P>
<P>
When the book begins, Marco is literally starving himself from a lack of roots. 
His mother was run over by a bus when he was little and died without telling 
him who his father was. Her brother, Victor, the amiable clarinetist who 
brought him up, dies in Marco's senior year at Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
Marco's only inheritance is his uncle's library. He piles the books in 
furniture stacks -- a bed stack, a table stack, a chair stack. He sells them 
off in threes and fours in order to eat; when they are gone he goes hungry. Not 
knowing who he is, he has nobody to work for or feed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Book by Design 
</P>
<P>
A friend finds him living in Central Park, ill with pneumonia after being 
drenched in a rainstorm. Finding him is a coincidence -- so, as we will see, is 
the near-death by drenching -- and there will be others. "Moon Palace" is a 
book by design, a fable-like design that is both mythical and laid-back. 
</P>
<P>
Food, shelter and the love of a young woman, Kitty, revive Marco enough so that 
he answers an employment ad as companion to an old man who can't walk. It is 
not really a step outside of himself. It will turn out later -- another 
coincidence -- that Thomas Effing is his grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
Effing, well-to-do and irascible, crippled and blind, has Marco read to him and 
take him for long walks. He is abusive but tender. He tells Marco his life 
story; a wildly variegated account of starting as a painter, traveling to the 
Far West, being abandoned by a treacherous guide in the desert, living as a 
hermit, killing three bandits, using their cache as a grubstake to make a 
fortune, and more. 
</P>
<P>
It is colorful and seemingly larger than life. It is also foreshortened and 
inert. The extravagant incident and the author's highly controlled sensibility 
make a curious post-modern match. It is the kind of match we find, for example, 
in Doctorow: fantasy without belief. 
</P>
<P>
Effing catches pneumonia himself, and dies of it, after one last errand. He has 
had Marco wheel him through New York so he can distribute $50 bills, and they 
are caught in a shower. Marco did not intend the death; nevertheless, he let 
himself be its instrument. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, he does not intend the death of Effing's son, Solomon. The latter 
looks Marco up and enlists him as his confidant. Finally, Marco learns that 
Solomon, as a professor, had seduced his mother when she was his student. She 
then disappeared, frustrating Solomon's efforts to trace her, and subsequently 
gave birth to Marco. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery enrages the young man. Retreating before his fury, Solomon, who 
is immensely fat, stumbles and breaks his back. Previously, he had given Marco 
a novel in which a whole series of fathers and sons search out, torment and 
kill each other. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arbitrary Exercise 
</P>
<P>
By this time, the reader may feel put-upon. Auster's cyclical father-son chase 
becomes an arbitrary exercise; a clothesline on which Marco's musings, conceits 
and adventures are hung out to dry. 
</P>
<P>
Marco is lively enough, and appealingly astringent. He tells of his outsize 
father and grandfather with a kind of whimsical dismay. He is not particularly 
memorable in himself, however. He has not been born yet.

YOUR WHEELS: PUTTING SKIDS ON SLIPPERY TRANSMISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: My wife's 1984 Buick developed a bothersome problem at 43,000 miles. 
Its automatic transmission slips. Under a heavy load, it seems to be 
free-wheeling or unable to downshift. For example, when she attempts to drive 
up our steep entrance drive, the car is left in a state of suspension. It 
finally catches hold and she moves up. It happens at stoplights as well. 
</P>
<P>
The Buick dealer speaks glibly about the need for a new transmission. I wonder 
if their diagnosis is accurate or whether there is something else that a 
less-than-wealthy motorist could do. -- A.B. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Welcome to the wonderful world of GM transmissions from the mid-1980s. 
Your transmission is designated a 125c, and you can take consolation in the 
fact that it is a lot more reliable than a GM 440 transmission, but not quite 
as reliable as a hot-water heater. 
</P>
<P>
A brief delay between the time you step on the accelerator and the time the car 
begins to move may be normal for this transmission. It seems that when the 
transmission is cold, fluid can drain out of the torque converter and 
momentarily disconnect the engine from the transmission. It takes a few moments 
for the transmission pump to refill the torque converter, which is the clutch 
an automatic transmission uses. 
</P>
<P>
But it is unlikely that this is the problem, because this chiefly occurs when 
you first start the car. Nonetheless, you should check the transmission fluid 
level, because a low fluid level can exacerbate this condition. If the fluid is 
low, you should examine to see whether it is oxidized. It will look burned and 
have a burnt smell. If this is the case, you have more serious problems. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible that the forward clutches on the transmission are shot. If you 
suspect the clutches, the transmission needs to be torn down and inspected. But 
it may not need a full rebuild. In fact, replacing the clutches can be done in 
about 10 standard hours of labor, which is a whole lot less than a total 
overhaul would require. 
</P>
<P>
On a final note, you might want to look into GM's Service Replace Transmission 
Assembly or SRTA. These are fully rebuilt transmissions that you buy off the 
shelf and have installed by the dealer. The GM 125c transmission is just now 
being offered under the SRTA program. I don't have a price for the 125c, but 
the 440s were being offered for $1,200. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have a 1984 Dodge Aries with a four-cylinder engine that refuses to start 
when it is hot unless I push the accelerator to the floor. What can I do? -- 
B.C. 
</P>
<P>
A: Pushing the accelerator to the floor is one correct way to start a hot 
engine. By pushing the accelerator to the floor, you will open the choke fully. 
Otherwise, a hot engine can flood.

Martina Flores of Pomona, who wanted photo albums that handle the old-fashioned

882-2161, has scrapbooks that can be used with corners. And Dorian Dunlavey of 
Rancho Palos Verdes says you can get the corners (and probably the albums too) 
from Exposures, 475 Oberlin Ave. South, Lakewood, N.J. 08701; telephone 
toll-free (800) 222-4947. We also heard from two readers who have some of these

MALL RENEWAL PLAN OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Redevelopment Agency gave preliminary approval Monday to a $57.3-million 
revitalization plan for the Fashion Plaza mall, instructing its staff to 
negotiate a development agreement with the mall owner, Sylvan Shulman Co., and 
May Centers Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for adding a 140,000- square-foot May Co. store, 100,000 square 
feet of new mall area and 82,000 square feet of peripheral commercial 
development. In approving it, the city rejected competing proposals from owners 
of two small mall properties for more limited rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
The May Co. will move from the Eastland Shopping Center, the city's other mall, 
which is owned by May Centers and is the focus of a separate revitalization 
proposal. May Centers is a subsidiary of St. Louis-based May Department Stores 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations over how much money the Redevelopment Agency will contribute are 
under way. The final contribution will probably involve a future sales tax or 
tax increment paid to the developers. Redevelopment officials said the city 
will provide no money up front for the project. 
</P>
<P>
The revitalization is intended to transform the 14-year-old center into a 
"super regional mall" competing with the Puente Hills Mall, Santa Anita Fashion 
Park and the Montclair Plaza. According to city studies, the Fashion Plaza has 
had a 7% decline in sales and a 19% decrease in customer traffic from last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
May Centers officials said the company has a $17.5-million budget for the 
project.

<P>
HISTORIC HOUSE MOVE OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council voted Tuesday to provide $53,500 to move a home built in the 
1890s to the new Santa Fe Trail Historic Park. 
</P>
<P>
The three-bedroom Osmond Ranch House, which the owner is donating to the El 
Monte Historical Society, will be moved from South El Monte to the park within 
a month, society President Helen Huffines said. 
</P>
<P>
Although some historians disagree, city officials say the site on Santa Anita 
Avenue marks the end of the pioneer trail taken by settlers from the Midwest. 
The park -- which also features El Monte's first jail, built in 1880 -- was 
declared a historical landmark by the state in 1987 and will open in June. 
</P>
<P>
Huffines, who is also curator of the El Monte Historical Museum, said only a 
dozen other homes from the late 19th Century remain in El Monte and South El 
Monte. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Osmond, a builder and farmer from Norway, constructed the 1 1/2-story 
house with redwood and square nails in 1892, Huffines said. An old water tower 
he built nearby will also be moved to the park. 
</P>
<P>
The society will restore the interior of the house, and the city Parks and 
Recreation Department will provide landscaping and maintain the exterior.

SNAPSHOTS: VIETNAMESE REFUGEE FINDS BALANCE BETWEEN TWO WORLDS AT CALTECH.

It's like a trip to the middle of the country in the middle of the century. 
Andy Hardyville. On this Pasadena block, old oaks and camphor trees arch into a 
canopy of green lace over the street; front yards are fragrant with flower beds 
bordering the squares of new mint-green grass. 
</P>
<P>
The apartment is decorated in Early Student. Poster of a bathing beauty. A 
license plate tacked on the wall. The TV is on. The MTV channel -- what else? 
The occupant is a student, as a matter of fact, a sophomore at Caltech in 
Pasadena. He will be 21 in June. True to the code, he wears acid jeans. 
</P>
<P>
But when Tan Pham speaks (both first and last names have the same vowel sound 
as calm) his views are hardly mainstream American. He doesn't care if he ever 
makes a lot of money, he says. 
</P>
<P>
That "money seems to be everything these days" can get on his nerves, he says, 
and so do "people who fall for money; who will do anything for money." He says 
he has had some friends who have done that. 
</P>
<P>
His apartment is on the second floor. And from a visitor's vantage point, the 
nerves he refers to are about as apparent as a ladybug would be on the lawn 
below. Pham radiates a sunny serenity. "I can be very nasty," he insists 
merrily. "I can lose my temper." Then he feels compelled to add: "For a few 
seconds." 
</P>
<P>
Pham spent his first 13 years in Vietnam. "My family was well-educated, and 
wanted me to leave to get a better education," he says, and staying in Vietnam 
would have meant joining the army at 18. 
</P>
<P>
His parents arranged for him to escape through a leader who organized the 
venture and was paid accordingly. "My parents didn't tell me until the day I 
was supposed to leave," to make sure he wouldn't inadvertently betray the plan. 
</P>
<P>
He has no trouble recalling his reaction to the news: "I just wanted to go." 
</P>
<P>
For 11 days, the boy sat in a boat with 21 other people. Studying the 
dimensions of his modest apartment for a moment, he says the boat was about the 
width of the living room, and perhaps as long as the living room plus the 
kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
"We ran out of food a few times. But fortunately, we met some fishing boats, 
and they gave us some food." Reading of the ordeals of other boat people makes 
him realize how much worse it could have been. "When people have to kill each 
other -- I never experienced that kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
Pham and his fellow refugees landed in Macao, across the bay from Hong Kong. 
And then the homesickness finally hit him, as a nine-month stay in a refugee 
camp began. 
</P>
<P>
A cousin in Hawaii sponsored Pham's entry into the United States, which led to 
another four months in a camp in the Philippines that was designed to prepare 
refugees for life here. "They taught us English." He looks doubtful. "Well, not 
much," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The international language of math saved him. Without that, "It would have been 
a lot more difficult. That's how I got brave enough to communicate with 
people." 
</P>
<P>
In Hawaii, an English teacher at the public school he was attending encouraged 
him to apply at a private school, where he was accepted. "My English was very 
horrible then," he says. "But I just took the test anyway, in case -- who 
knows?" Aiming at a career in physics, he came to the mainland to attend 
Caltech 1 1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Pham has four brothers and two sisters. One sister escaped Vietnam and is 
living in Holland, and his 15-year-old brother is living with him now in 
Pasadena. It's a big responsibility, he concedes. "I try to sort of tell him, 
just don't do the bad things. As long as he gets to a decent college. That's 
all I want. That's all my parents want." 
</P>
<P>
He works part time as a programmer for First Quadrant, an investment firm in 
Pasadena, gets A's and Bs at college, and keeps in touch with his parents, who 
don't intend to try and escape themselves, he says -- "just to send their 
children out." 
</P>
<P>
About half his friends are American, and about half are Vietnamese: "I think 
that's a good thing." 
</P>
<P>
How are the disparate cultures of the two sets demonstrated? "The way you eat, 
the way you act, the things you talk about, the way you treat people." 
</P>
<P>
In Asia, the young defer to the old; "Americans tend to do the opposite." Pham 
says, "I realize my parents' purpose for sending me out. I don't want to 
disappoint them." At the same time, he appreciates that "here, we have the 
right to express our opinions." 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want to go back there now," he says. 
</P>
<P>
And so here he is, like a tightrope performer with a long pole. To steady 
himself, a dip into the East here, into the West there. He is balanced because 
he is centered. His father believed in him, he says. And, he says: "I believe 
in myself."

PHONE TAX HIKE REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council voted 5-0 on Monday to reject a proposal to increase the 
city's utility tax by adding a fee for out-of-state telephone calls. The 
current 5% tax is levied only on calls within the state. 
</P>
<P>
The utility tax was imposed in 1983 on all commercial and residential users of 
electricity, natural gas, water, telephones and cable television. The council 
promised to eliminate it as as soon as the city could afford to. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the council has phased out the residential tax on water, 
electricity and natural gas. The tax on residential telephone users is 
scheduled to be eliminated Jan. 1, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
But at a council meeting Monday, the city staff recommended taking advantage of 
an Illinois court ruling that interstate telephone calls may also be taxed. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Mary Louise Bunker, saying she did not want to increase the tax on 
residential users, proposed adding a tax on interstate calls by businesses 
after Jan. 1 when the phone tax for residents will have been phased out. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Boyd Condie, while conceding that he ran for election last November 
on a pledge to eliminate the utility tax, also did not rule out a tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not backing down from (the campaign promise), but I do feel that there are 
times that we have to make provisions for things that come up in the future," 
Condie said. 
</P>
<P>
But his motion to table the matter so that the council could study it was 
defeated. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Michael Blanco and Councilman Talmage Burke both spoke out strongly 
against a tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
"It's idiotic for us to pass a tax just because it's available," Blanco said.

The City Council Monday approved spending $127,000 in federal community

</P>
<P>
But upset at the marked increase in the amount of graffiti in the city Mayor 
Barry L. Hatch said parents must be held accountable for the actions of 
children who are vandals. Hatch said that when he was a youngster and 
misbehaved, "my dad beat the hell out of me."

YWCA, YMCA FOLLOW SEPARATE PATHS

<P>
Officials of the Pasadena YWCA and YMCA say both organizations will pursue 
projects in the central Pasadena area even though the proposal to develop a 
joint recreation and social service complex is dead. 
</P>
<P>
The YWCA board of directors announced this week that is has pulled out of the 
joint project and will consider other options for developing its property at 
Marengo Avenue and Holly Street. 
</P>
<P>
Ernestine Moore, YWCA president, said the group is looking at ways to develop 
the property by itself or with others, but she declined to be more specific. In 
a written statement, Moore said: "Some of these options are extremely exciting 
and have the possibility of providing some long-term financial benefits to the 
agency." 
</P>
<P>
Moore said the property would be developed in a way that would allow the YWCA 
to remain at the location and to upgrade its facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the two organizations had planned to develop a joint $15-million 
complex on the YWCA site. But that plan was delayed by a lengthy design-review 
process that arose from concern about the preservation of historic and 
architecturally significant structures. Eventually the plan fell through 
because of an inability to secure financing. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Knox, YMCA president, said his organization is in escrow on the sale of 
its facilities across from the YWCA, and will continue to look for a new site. 
The YMCA closed the recreation portion of its building in February but is 
continuing to operate residential units. It will receive about $3.5 million 
from the sale and will use the money to develop new facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The YMCA and YWCA raised more than $5 million in pledges for the joint project 
and collected $2.2 million. Officials said they spent $2.5 million in the 
effort to develop the project. Some of the money went for plans that will go 
forward, since the YWCA intends to develop an aquatic center, and the new YMCA 
will house the planned Lathrop K. Leishman Activity Center.

U.S. WAIVES TENANT LAWS TO AID VIRGINIA BATTLE AGAINST DRUGS IN PUBLIC HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Troubled by the growing prevalence of drug trafficking in housing projects, the 
Bush Administration Wednesday officially exempted the state of Virginia from 
federal tenant-protection laws as part of an aggressive new effort to evict 
drug dealers from the nation's public housing. 
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented move, among the most far-reaching of the Administration's new 
anti-drug initiatives, faces an almost-certain legal challenge. But 
Administration officials defended the action, saying that it affords tenants 
adequate legal protections. 
</P>
<P>
As Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp proclaimed that the 
eviction of drug dealers is among his "top priorities," sources close to him 
said that it is likely the new tactic will be extended far beyond Virginia, 
which was granted an informal exemption late Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Response to Shoot-Out 
</P>
<P>
That action came in response to a shoot-out in Alexandria that left a policeman 
and a drug suspect dead and a neighborhood traumatized in an outbreak of 
drug-related violence that officials fear has become all too characteristic of 
the nation's housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
The exemption from the federal statutes gives Virginia public housing officials 
the power to evict drug dealers and users without first resorting to 
administrative proceedings that can delay action for months. Tenants who seek 
to challenge eviction orders must now appeal directly to the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Civil libertarians and tenants' rights advocates denounced the move, saying 
that it could deprive innocent people of shelter. They noted that a federal 
court in Washington last year overruled a Ronald Reagan Administration attempt 
to streamline the eviction procedures and charged that the latest move violates 
that court order. 
</P>
<P>
But public housing administrators across the country welcomed the move and many 
said that they would ask Kemp for similar powers. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as we've got drugs," said Chicago Housing Authority chairman Vince 
Evans, "life in the projects will be hell." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities in Alexandria used their new power immediately to evict 41 
suspected drug dealers and their families. "I just want them out of the city," 
said Mayor James P. Moran. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said they would decide whether to grant further 
exemptions after considering proposals from cities and states as part of a 
review conducted by Kemp and William J. Bennett, director of national drug 
control policy. 
</P>
<P>
They said that the government would move to speed the eviction process only in 
areas in which state law provides tenants with adequate protection. A spokesman 
for Kemp, Mary Brunette, emphasized that the federal exemption "certainly does 
not exempt states from going through the normal appeals procedure" to address 
tenant grievances. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of the new crackdown, Kemp said in a statement, is to "clean the drugs 
out of public housing and to help reclaim these communities for law-abiding 
public citizens." 
</P>
<P>
Public housing officials interviewed Wednesday said that the pervasiveness of 
drugs and violence in housing projects across the country has come to dominate 
life within them. Even in affluent Alexandria, Moran noted, "tenants feared for 
their lives and had difficulty keeping their children from being involved in 
drugs." 
</P>
<P>
At the Hopkins-Tancil Court housing project there, where the shooting took 
place, residents said Monday that while they want drug dealers to be evicted, 
they worry that residents not involved in drug activity also could lose their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
"Innocent people could get thrown out," said Pernell Taylor, who has lived in 
the project for 12 years. "It's ruination to them." 
</P>
<P>
In most states, authorities can move to evict a suspected drug dealer from 
public housing on the basis of a single arrest on a drug-related offense and 
need not await a conviction. In most cases, the evicted individual's family 
also loses the right to housing. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, such action could be appealed first in the federal administrative 
process and then in the state courts. Because Wednesday's decision on Virginia 
removes the federal step from the appeals process, housing advocates said they 
were concerned that housing authorities might now be encouraged to act too 
hastily. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one thing to bypass the grievance process when you're trying to evict an 
individual who is selling drugs," said David Bryson of the National Housing Law 
Center. "It's another thing when you try to evict the whole family because an 
individual in the family has done something wrong." 
</P>
<P>
The law center successfully blocked the previous effort to speed evictions, 
winning a temporary restraining order in federal court here early this year 
that invalidated new regulations proposed by the Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Bryson said that he believes the Bush Administration's granting of exemptions 
was merely a new attempt to implement the rules rejected by the court. But 
Brunette, the Kemp spokesman, said that the Administration is confident its 
action will be upheld.

2 CZECH YOUTHS HIJACK JETLINER TO WEST GERMANY

Two Czechoslovak teen-agers armed with shotguns and grenades hijacked a 
Hungarian airliner in Prague on Wednesday and flew with 15 hostages to 
Frankfurt, where they surrendered without incident, airport officials and 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
The Tupolev 154, a Soviet-made plane similar to a Boeing 727, landed at 
Frankfurt airport shortly after noon, and the boys, aged 15 and 16, gave 
themselves up 40 minutes later. No one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
The boys took control of Malev Hungarian Airlines Flight 640 at the airport in 
Prague, the Czechoslovak capital, at about 9:30 a.m. Witnesses at Ruzyne 
Airport said the teen-agers took a woman hostage, crashed through a glass wall 
of the VIP lounge, fired several shots and threatened a stewardess. 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian news agency MTI reported that the aircraft was on a scheduled 
flight from Budapest, Hungary, to Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
MTI said that Lajos Taba, Hungarian consul general in Prague, boarded the 
aircraft and negotiated the release of 82 passengers, including all women and 
children, by trading himself for them. Taba was among the 11 passengers when 
the plane landed in Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wanted to Go to U.S. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to go to America," MTI London spokesman Tibor Koves said of the 
hijackers. "They probably just wanted to get out." 
</P>
<P>
Hans Neitzel, chief spokesman for the Frankfurt police, said he could not 
confirm the hijackers' motives. 
</P>
<P>
"They said they wanted to go to America, but why they wanted to go, whether 
they have relatives there or what, we don't know," he said. "Maybe it was just 
youthful adventure." 
</P>
<P>
He said they were being held for hijacking, but "whether they will be 
extradited will be decided through diplomatic channels." 
</P>
<P>
West German television reported that the two had asked to stay in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Neitzel said the passengers still aboard the plane when it landed in Frankfurt 
were three Hungarians, four Czechoslovaks, a Dutch citizen, two Canadians and a 
Romanian, as well as the crew of four. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary's news agency and CTK, the official Czechoslovak agency, said the 
flight crew convinced the young hijackers that the plane could not cross the 
ocean and that they then demanded to be taken to Barcelona, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
After entering West German airspace, however, the youths told the pilot to land 
at Frankfurt because they wanted to deal with the Americans at nearby military 
facilities, said Hans-Ulrich Ohl, head of the federal flight safety office in 
Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. military authorities refused to allow the Hungarian jet onto Rhein-Main 
Air Base. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first hijacking of a Hungarian aircraft. There was a hijack attempt 
in Warsaw in 1982, but the plane did not take off and the suspects were 
captured.

CHINA CONFISCATES PETITIONS ON POLITICAL PRISONERS

<P>
Chinese customs officials have confiscated petitions signed by more than 24,000 
people in Hong Kong and 34 countries urging release of Chinese political 
prisoners, a group of Hong Kong activists said here Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The petitions were circulated by various organizations as part of an 
international campaign for the release of eight well-known pro-democracy 
activists, most of them imprisoned for nearly a decade, and other less famous 
prisoners. Wednesday was the 10th anniversary of the arrest of Wei Jingsheng, 
the most famous of the prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
The group of five Hong Kong activists told a news conference that the documents 
were seized Tuesday when they arrived in China. They had hoped to present the 
petitions to the current session of the National People's Congress, China's 
parliament, which has authority to grant amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
Wang Hanbin, vice chairman of the congress, appeared to rule out any amnesty 
for prisoners this year. The congress, which is in the middle of a 16-day 
annual session, "is not considering giving nor does it think it necessary to 
offer special pardons to prisoners on this occasion," Wang said at a press 
conference Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said that although he did not have enough information to comment on 
the incident involving the Hong Kong group, Chinese citizens and Hong Kong 
residents do have the legal right to submit petitions to the congress. 
</P>
<P>
A letter-writing campaign seeking amnesty for Wei and other prisoners was 
launched early this year by intellectuals in China. In recent weeks, it has 
drawn growing support from ethnic Chinese in Hong Kong, Taiwan, the United 
States and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese officials have criticized foreign support for the campaign as 
interference in China's internal affairs. But Beijing cannot dismiss the 
concerns of Hong Kong residents in the same sweeping fashion. The British 
colony is to revert to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 under the formula of "one 
country, two systems," and Beijing is trying to avoid undermining confidence in 
its future. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Implications for Hong Kong 
</P>
<P>
"In Hong Kong, we find quite a spontaneous response to this signature 
movement," said Lau Kin-chi, a college lecturer and political activist in Hong 
Kong. "People have come to see that without a democratic China, there cannot be 
a democratic future for Hong Kong. So now people are more concerned for 
promotion of democracy in China." 
</P>
<P>
A Chinese customs official told reporters Wednesday that the petitions were 
seized along with a quantity of magazines because the group was carrying "an 
unreasonable amount of printed matter into China" that was not for members' 
personal use. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't say 2,000 pieces of paper is a reasonable amount," said Huang 
Rufeng, deputy director of the customs department in Tianjin, a coastal city 
east of Beijing where the group entered China. 
</P>
<P>
Emily Lau, another member of the Hong Kong group, said they still hoped the 
petitions would reach the National People's Congress. On Wednesday, the group 
delivered to the congress mail room a letter in which they suggested that 
legislative officials instruct customs officials to turn the petitions over to 
the congress. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the congress' main business of the day, delegates heard officials 
give statistics on crime and punishment during 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Ren Jianxin, president of the Supreme People's Court, announced that 368,790 
people were sentenced last year. Murder cases were up 9%, robbery cases were up 
43% and cases of serious larceny were up 64%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Liu Fuzhi, head of the central government's office in charge of prosecutions, 
said there were 40,450 cases of infringement of people's rights by government 
officials or law enforcement officers. This included 4,700 cases in which 
police were guilty of offenses such as frame-ups, extorting confessions through 
torture or unlawful detentions, he said. Of these cases, he said, 227 led to 
disability or death.

Drivers who want to enter the center of Florence will have to pay $5 for the 
privilege after April 10, a city official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The councilman responsible for traffic, Graziano Cioni, said the move, which 
does not apply to residents or tourists staying in the center, will stop 
hundreds of vehicles from illegally entering the narrow medieval streets every 
day. The city set up a central exclusion zone two years ago to avoid congestion 
and protect its monuments from exhaust fumes.

PENTAGON BUDGET MAY BE SLASHED BEYOND $6.3 BILLION IN CUTS ALREADY UNDER REVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Lawmakers are preparing to slash the Pentagon budget by an additional $4 
billion to $5 billion, even as Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is weighing $6.3 
billion in cuts from the 1990 defense budget to meet President Bush's target of 
a freeze in defense spending, Pentagon and congressional sources said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The new cuts mean that military spending would suffer a real decline for the 
fifth consecutive year after a massive run-up early in the Ronald Reagan 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney vowed last week to fight "as aggressively as I know how" against further 
cuts in defense spending, but it appears that Democrats in Congress will turn a 
deaf ear as they try to trim the federal deficit and preserve popular domestic 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
The congressional action likely would force Cheney to reduce military manpower 
or cancel weapons systems, or both, alternatives that the Pentagon has so far 
resisted. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon's budget is being thrashed out by the House and Senate Budget 
committees, which next week are expected to present the Defense Department with 
a "top line" figure representing the maximum amount that the department can 
spend next year. 
</P>
<P>
Sources at the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill said that number will be as much as 
$5 billion below the $309 billion requested by Bush, marking a 2% decline from 
this year's spending level after adjusting for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon budget has fallen 11% in real terms over the last four years, 
after rising an average of 9% a year during the first five years of the Reagan 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Likely targets of the new round of Pentagon budget-cutting include such 
expensive long-term programs as the "star wars" missile shield, the B-2 stealth 
bomber and new aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines. But officials said 
that it is inevitable the 2.1-million-member armed forces also will shrink to 
achieve the savings sought by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said this week that all the easy cuts already have been made. "To the 
extent that there was any fat in the budget, if there was, it's gone. We're 
down to bone now and the choices I have to make are very difficult," he said in 
a television interview Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
And last week, Cheney expressed a clear preference for cutting overall troop 
levels rather than maintaining "a fiction of extensive forces" without money 
for ammunition, spare parts, flying hours and sailing days. 
</P>
<P>
"If forced to choose, I'd rather be in a position to maintain highly effective 
and capable forces, even if they were fewer in number," Cheney said last Friday 
in his first news conference as defense secretary. 
</P>
<P>
He hinted, also, that he will be likely to recommend outright cancellation of 
some weapons programs. Current plans to trim $6.3 billion from next year's 
Pentagon budget contain neither force reductions nor program terminations, 
defense sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to . . . convey the notion that somehow there is no pain involved 
in these budget cuts," Cheney said. Deferring or stretching out weapons 
purchases only pushes the problem down the road, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather make a clean break," the former Wyoming congressman said. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said in an 
interview this week that the Administration's proposed Pentagon budget of $309 
billion almost certainly would be reduced, but he would not predict by how 
much. 
</P>
<P>
"I do think there will be a cut below the Administration number," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Privately, however, lawmakers and committee staffers said that Congress would 
"split the difference" between the Administration request and the current year 
defense budget of $299 billion. The resulting $304 billion represents a 2% cut 
below the anticipated inflation rate. Defense Department budget planners did 
not disagree. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon presents an attractive target for Democratic budget-cutters 
because of the Soviet Union's promises of reduced military spending and an 
apparent lessening of global tensions, specialists said. The United States and 
the Soviets are negotiating cuts in both strategic forces and conventional 
arms, talks that some lawmakers believe offer opportunities for defense 
savings. 
</P>
<P>
"The climate of emergency that Reagan successfully fostered is no longer 
plausible," said Joshua M. Epstein, a defense analyst at Washington's Brookings 
Institution. "People feel there's room to relax the pace at which we've been 
building up our military forces." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, however, sharply disputed that premise. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very strongly that now is not the time for the U.S. to begin operating 
on the assumption that suddenly this is a safe and peaceful world and we no 
longer have to maintain our vigilance or our deterrence," he said at the press 
conference last week. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're forced by budget pressures to make unilateral decisions, in effect, 
and not get anything for them in terms of negotiations with the Soviets, that 
would not be in our interest," he added. 
</P>
<P>
If forced to cut spending, Cheney said, his first priority would be to protect 
what he called "quality of life issues" for military personnel, including pay, 
medical benefits, housing allowances and other benefits.

State Treasurer A. James Manchin faced impeachment proceedings Wednesday for 
losing $279 million in state funds through bad investments. 
</P>
<P>
The state House of Delegates voted 65 to 34 to approve 17 articles of 
impeachment against Manchin, 61, whom Delegate Stephen Bird called "the most 
popular man in West Virginia." 
</P>
<P>
The vote sends the case to the state Senate. Senate President Larry Tucker said 
a trial on the treasurer's removal probably would be held in late May. 
</P>
<P>
Manchin testified during 10 days of hearings that he knew little about 
investments. He said he was betrayed by subordinates he hired to run the 
consolidated investment fund that lost the $279 million.

SCRAMBLE IS ON TO SAVE SALMON FROM OIL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
At last, the enormous National Guard helicopter, its invaluable cargo of 
oil-containing booms slung under its belly, came in low from the north. 
</P>
<P>
The request for the booms had been made to Exxon two days ago. But like much 
that has gone wrong since the Exxon Valdez spilled more oil in U.S. waters than 
any other ship or rig or well, no booms appeared. 
</P>
<P>
A group of state officials on the beach and fishermen in their boats on the 
deep green water of Sawmill Bay in the southwestern corner of Prince William 
Sound watched anxiously. The huge oil slick was only five miles away, ready to 
come ashore in a few hours if the wind picked up. 
</P>
<P>
Many photogenic bays had already been abandoned to the purple-brown muck. But 
here on Evans Island a stand must be taken, with or without Exxon. Down the 
beach in a 40-by-40-foot pen, with the water of the bay flowing back and forth 
through the net sides, swam a million young salmon. 
</P>
<P>
The fishermen financed and personally built much of the hatchery, and their 
livelihood has depended on it. Last season, when the pink salmon crop was 
endangered by failures at the other hatcheries in the sound, salmon spawned 
here at the Armin F. Koernig hatchery made up 90% of the catch. 
</P>
<P>
So they came by boat to its defense. But until now, they had been forced to 
wait. 
</P>
<P>
The helicopter circled reluctantly, with no obvious place to land. 
</P>
<P>
"He's worried about tearing the shingles off the roof," of the nearby cannery, 
said Bob Hall, an oil-containment specialist brought in by the Alaska 
Department of Environmental Conservation. Hall attempted to guide the chopper 
in for landing in the morning chill, but the huge craft circled again then flew 
along the beach of Sawmill Bay, looking for a better spot. 
</P>
<P>
Five minutes later it returned, dropping inch by inch, the prop roaring as it 
scattered debris. The hull of a 30-foot skiff lifted like a Kleenex box and 
slammed into a tractor. The helicopter rose again and eventually, around the 
corner, found a stretch of beach more to its liking. 
</P>
<P>
The scramble was on to finish a series of long booms to divert, contain and if 
all else fails, absorb the approaching spill. By mid-morning, two long loops of 
yellow boom had been stretched out behind fishing boats. A pair of state 
troopers, running errands on their skiff, gathered bundles of the absorbent 
boom, which looks and feels like rolled-up toweling. 
</P>
<P>
A cargo plane with no place to land dropped more bundles from Exxon out the 
cargo doors into the bay. 
</P>
<P>
But gratitude is not on the fishermen's minds. "Without question, this has been 
the most unorganized situation," Eric Prestegard, hatchery manager, said 
tiredly. "I got calls two nights ago, telling me I'd have everything -- and 
you're just seeing it come in now." 
</P>
<P>
One small-boat owner reported that on his first run out on the sound for the 
Exxon containment effort his sole cargo was a crowbar. Tim Jones, a skipper who 
has been ferrying laborers out to the sound, said that after one run the 
company asked him to go out again immediately with a load of 60 sandwiches. 
"That's about $100 a sandwich by what I charge," he said incredulously. 
</P>
<P>
But the effort at Port San Juan is progressing. One reason may be that, in a 
3:30 a.m. meeting Tuesday with Exxon and other parties, the state of Alaska 
took over the effort here. 
</P>
<P>
By noon, one boom is across the bay. The pipeline of supplies, now that Exxon 
has turned its attention this direction, is bulging. Prestegard and his troops 
are more hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking pretty good. And they are starting to produce now," he said of 
the central planners in Valdez.

PRIVATE PANEL CALLS FOR FEDERAL PAY RAISE

A private commission examining how to make government service more attractive 
recommended Wednesday that salaries for top Administration officials, judges 
and members of Congress be increased. 
</P>
<P>
The 36-member National Commission on Public Service, headed by former Federal 
Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker, recommended a pay raise that could end up as 
large as the one Congress killed last month after public opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Volcker would not speculate on whether he believed Congress would endorse a pay 
increase, but he said that, based on talks with lawmakers: "I do find some 
renewal of interest in the subject." 
</P>
<P>
The commission's pay proposal is similar to the one made in the final weeks of 
the Ronald Reagan Administration by a congressionally created commission that 
assesses federal pay every four years. Reagan and President Bush endorsed that 
proposed 51% increase. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Volcker commission plan, a pay increase of 25% would be effective 
immediately. A second pay raise would wait until a new Congress convenes in 
1991. Also, members of Congress would have to give up speaking fees, or 
honorariums, with which many lawmakers supplement their incomes. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, most members of Congress are paid $89,500, Cabinet-level officials 
are paid $99,500 and directors of various bureaus, deputy secretaries, 
assistant secretaries and other top officials are paid from $75,500 to $89,500. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also recommended pay raises for rank-and-file federal employees, 
but the panel suggested that the increases be absorbed into existing budgets by 
reductions in force and the elimination of programs. It also suggested that the 
pay rates vary from locality to locality, based on the cost of living. 
</P>
<P>
Among other commission recommendations: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The number of presidential political appointees should be reduced from the 
current level of about 3,000 to about 2,000 and career officials should more 
frequently be considered for sub-Cabinet appointments. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The President and Congress should establish a public service scholarship 
program open to 1,000 students who would receive tuition and costs in return 
for a commitment to a specified term of government service. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The President should "set the highest standards of ethical conduct for 
those who hold the public trust, and act quickly and firmly to remove those who 
violate that trust." 
</P>
<P>
In comments to a group of high school students who visited the White House on 
Wednesday, Bush lauded the commission's report. He had met earlier in the day 
with the commission but was non-committal on the pay raise proposal.

THE INDICTMENT OF MICHAEL MILKEN; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE LIKELY TO ATTACK ACCUSERS, LABEL SOME CHARGES TECHNICALITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS FRANTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Milken's defense strategy is likely to evolve in two directions in the 
coming weeks: convincing a federal court jury that some of his trusted former 
associates are liars out to save their own skin, and challenging some charges 
against him as technical rather than criminal. 
</P>
<P>
A key decision for the defense during the trial, which is likely to begin later 
this year, will probably be whether to put Milken on the stand to rebut the 
claims anticipated from convicted stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky and from 
several Drexel Burnham Lambert employees cooperating with prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
He will not challenge all of the facts brought out by the government in its 
98-count indictment. But his lawyers are certain to argue that many of those 
facts do not constitute criminal behavior in instances such as stock parking, a 
practice used to conceal ownership of shares. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Who You Believe' 
</P>
<P>
"You can respond to the parking kinds of situations by using motions to fight 
them and saying that they were not actually violations," said Don D. Buchwald, 
a defense lawyer in New York who often represents white-collar criminals. "Then 
there are the charges where there can be no doubt that the conduct was 
criminal, and the question comes down to who you believe." 
</P>
<P>
It is the second category of allegations where Milken is believed to face the 
most potent government evidence -- the testimony of several former Milken 
associates who are expected to take the stand against him. 
</P>
<P>
One of those almost certain to testify is Boesky, who is serving a prison term 
for insider trading. Many of the charges against Milken stem from his extensive 
dealings with Boesky, including a $5.3-million payment to Drexel by Boesky in 
March of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The government argues that the money was payment for Milken illegally holding 
stock owned by Boesky, a form of parking. Milken's lawyers will contend the 
money was a legitimate payment for consulting services, which is how it was 
identified on an invoice at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense will attack Boesky and it will be over the $5.3 million," said 
William G. Hundley, a Washington defense lawyer who represents a Drexel 
employee. "Was it for consulting or something else? That's what the jury will 
have to decide." 
</P>
<P>
One of Milken's lead lawyers made clear Wednesday that challenging Boesky and 
others will be a key tactic. 
</P>
<P>
"The charges against Mr. Milken are essentially a repetition of the accusations 
made by Boesky and others as they bargained for leniency and immunity from 
prosecution," said Arthur L. Liman. 
</P>
<P>
Attacking Boesky and other former Milken associates will involve trying to 
persuade jurors that the witnesses are lying to protect themselves or to win 
better treatment from the government. But discrediting many of the witnesses is 
likely to be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Potent Witnesses' 
</P>
<P>
"If Milken dealt directly with those folks, they can be potent witnesses to a 
jury," Buchwald said. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most crucial trial decision will be whether to put Milken on the 
witness stand. He would be the person best able to rebut the testimony of 
witnesses against him. But testimony by a defendant always entails a high 
degree of risk. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael is incredibly rich and can appear somewhat arrogant," said one defense 
lawyer, who asked that his name not be used. "That can present a problem with a 
jury." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Milken can be charming, polite and persuasive, and those 
characteristics could work well on a jury. 
</P>
<P>
Milken's defense lawyers have been assembling evidence for more than two years, 
and most lawyers said Wednesday's charges contained few if any surprises. 
</P>
<P>
"This tracks the SEC civil case filed last fall, and I don't think there are 
any great surprises," said Ira Lee Sorkin, a New York defense lawyer and former 
regional administrator of the Securities and Exchange Commission. "They were 
really shooting for these guys, and this is a heavy indictment with a lot of 
counts." 
</P>
<P>
The 98 counts were regarded by several lawyers as an unusually high number, 
creating an enormous burden for defense lawyers who must analyze each 
allegation and assemble their case. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible that the defense task will become more difficult later if the 
government files a second indictment to take the place of the charges brought 
Wednesday. The new charges, called a superseding indictment, would contain new 
allegations and possibly name additional defendants. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. attorney's office has threatened to indict so many other people that 
I think it would be safe to say that they will follow their normal procedure 
and have several superseding indictments," said a lawyer who asked that his 
name be withheld. 
</P>
<P>
Buchwald agreed that new charges are likely before the case goes to trial, 
saying: "I can't remember a time in a substantial white-collar criminal case 
here where the government went to trial on its first indictment. It is very, 
very frustrating for defense lawyers because they end up with moving targets." 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers can end up spending weeks researching specific allegations only 
to have them replaced with new charges. 
</P>
<P>
However, Milken has assembled crack lawyers from several prominent firms, most 
notably New York's Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison and 
Washington's Williams &amp; Connolly. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the charges are filed, the defense will begin filing motions on 
technical and procedural questions aimed at discovering information about the 
nature of the prosecution's evidence and at weakening the government's case by 
having some charges dismissed before trial. 
</P>
<P>
Federal rules of evidence require the government to provide the defense with 
copies of testimony to the grand jury and the FBI by the witnesses against 
Milken. But the rules do not require the material to be provided until the 
witnesses actually testify in court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Smooth Trial 
</P>
<P>
Common practice in New York federal courts and most other jurisdictions, 
however, is to provide that material several days or weeks in advance of the 
court testimony to allow for a smooth trial. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers do not, however, have the automatic right to interview 
government witnesses before they testify. While some witnesses do agree to 
pretrial sessions with the defense, few if any are expected to do so in the 
Milken case. That means that the defense cannot be sure what the witnesses will 
say on the stand until they actually testify. 
</P>
<P>
"You have no right to interview Boesky, and if Boesky says he won't do it, 
that's it," said R. Stan Mortenson, a Washington defense lawyer. "That is one 
of the biggest hurdles for a defense lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
Federal rules require a trial to be held within 70 days of the filing of a 
criminal indictment, but no one expects Milken to go on trial that quickly. 
</P>
<P>
The court will undoubtedly allow more time to hear the barrage of complex 
motions expected to be filed by the defense, and the clock will start all over 
again if the government files a superseding indictment with new charges and 
possibly new defendants.

THE INDICTMENT OF MICHAEL MILKEN;

<P>
Employees at Drexel Burnham Lambert in Beverly Hills expressed every emotion 
but surprise at the news that Michael and Lowell Milken were indicted Wednesday 
on securities fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
Most Drexel employees learned the details of the 98-count indictment by reading 
the Dow Jones ticker tape or by talking to colleagues, workers said. They said 
"Mike" had been in the office quite a bit in the past few days, but no one 
seemed to know how he got the news. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all a bit numb," said a Drexel executive who asked not to be 
identified. "After all, it's been three years of this (the government 
investigation.)" 
</P>
<P>
"It's a terrible, terrible shame that they are doing this to Mike," he said. 
"The tragedy is that he has helped so many people." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loyal Associates 
</P>
<P>
When asked if he expected Milken to make a comeback, he said: "I would say a 
guy with Mike's genius and creativity will still be around long after this." 
</P>
<P>
The Beverly Hills office of Drexel Burnham is the headquarters of Michael 
Milken's "junk bond" operation, and it is here that he and intensely loyal 
associates worked to raise billions of dollars for corporate America. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel and the Beverly Hills office will endure, the executive said. The firm 
continues "to do lots of deals and raise lots of money" despite the adverse 
publicity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other workers echoed the executive's deep feelings for Milken. "Everybody's 
been expecting it for so long, but it's sad because Mike Milken is so smart," 
one employee said. 
</P>
<P>
But to some, even though it was expected, the actual news was unnerving. A 
secretary to John Kissick, a Drexel director who has taken over most of Michael 
Milken's duties, was so disturbed by the news and by a request to speak to 
Kissick that she abruptly hung up on a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said Drexel has been preparing for the indictment by grooming other 
executives to take on Milken's work. This is necessary because the company 
agreed that employees who are indicted will have to leave the firm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leveraged Buyout 
</P>
<P>
Kissick and Peter Ackerman, a close associate of Michael Milken, have taken 
over the day-to-day bond operation. Sources said Ackerman is the one who has 
followed Milken's footsteps in dreaming up creative financing ideas for 
clients. "It was Ackerman's idea and structuring that raised $5 billion instead 
of $3 billion for RJR (Nabisco)," said one source, referring to the recent 
$24.5-billion leveraged buyout of the giant food and tobacco firm. 
</P>
<P>
Several employees said they had been working hard and trying not to think about 
the impending charges. 
</P>
<P>
"You wouldn't know anything was different," said a secretary. "It has been 
business as usual, and that's what's been funny." 
</P>
<P>
Sources inside Drexel suggested that workers tend to be divided over the 
Milkens' troubles. One group, consisting of people who worked closely with 
Michael Milken and enjoyed substantial compensation, remain steadfastly loyal. 
Another group of generally younger, newer employees, tend to be somewhat 
embarrassed by the firm's troubles and feel that the scandal has tarred the 
reputation of the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Tensions within the company have been high since at least three employees have 
agreed to testify against Milken for the government's case. One witness, Terren 
S. Peizer, a bond trader, was told to take several days off last December after 
an argument with a supervisor, according to his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Many employees felt a sense of relief that the indictment was finally issued. 
But one former Drexel investment banker was openly angry at Milken and felt 
that he deserved to be criminally charged. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Predators' Ball' Still Planned 
</P>
<P>
"Here you are trying to do people a service and they think, 'Drexel -- oh, 
you're a bunch of crooks,' " he said, adding that Milken has given Drexel a bad 
name in the investment community. 
</P>
<P>
"We never had a reputation for being pretty, we just have a reputation for 
being able to perform," countered one Drexel executive. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment comes a week before Drexel's annual institutional research 
conference in Beverly Hills. Thousands of Drexel employees and clients from 
around the world are expected to attend the gathering from next Wednesday 
through April 8 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. The top-secret session climaxes 
with an elaborate dinner on April 7. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed the "Predators' Ball" by the financial press -- which is banned from the 
event -- it has traditionally attracted Drexel's most powerful clients. 
</P>
<P>
"The conference is definitely going to happen," said Steven Anreder, Drexel's 
spokesman. "It will be the 11th one." 
</P>
<P>
Another insider said it appeared that the government intended to add insult to 
injury by indicting the Milken brothers just days before the company's biggest 
public event.

Three men were convicted Wednesday in the execution-style murder of a rookie 
policeman whose death became an issue in last year's presidential campaign and 
helped set the national agenda in the war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Cobb, 25, was convicted of second-degree murder and weapons charges for 
his role in the death of Officer Edward Byrne, 22, who was shot five times on 
Feb. 26, 1988, while he sat in his patrol car guarding the home of a witness. 
</P>
<P>
About two hours after the Cobb verdict was announced, a second jury convicted 
Todd Scott, 20, and Philip Copeland, 23. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne's shooting became an issue in the presidential election when his father, 
Matthew Byrne, presented then-Vice President George Bush with his son's police 
shield. 
</P>
<P>
Bush showed the shield to audiences around the country when he spoke about the 
need to crack down on illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants each face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life on the murder 
charges and 5 to 15 years on second-degree criminal possession of a weapon.

UEBERROTH REPORTEDLY HAS PUT TOGETHER $412-MILLION PACKAGE TO BID FOR EASTERN 
</P>

<P>
Outgoing baseball commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth has lined up financing for a 
bid of approximately $412 million to acquire strike-crippled Eastern Airlines, 
The Times learned Wednesday. The board of Texas Air Corp., the parent company 
of Eastern, is scheduled to meet today to consider his offer. 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth, the former head of the Los Angeles Olympics Committee, has put 
together a team headed by seasoned airline executive J. Thomas Talbot, who 
helped found two West Coast carriers -- Air California and Jet America. He also 
has retained the Los Angeles law firm of Latham &amp; Watkins. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kerkorian Not Involved 
</P>
<P>
But contrary to some reports, Kirk Kerkorian, Ueberroth's friend and former 
employer in the airline industry, is not involved in the union-supported effort 
to acquire Eastern. As part of Ueberroth's package, union members would own 
about 30% of Eastern Airlines in return for contract concessions. 
</P>
<P>
But even if the board of Texas Air approves Ueberroth's offer, additional 
approval will be needed from a bankruptcy judge, a bankruptcy examiner, who 
will be appointed this week, and Eastern's unions. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, other potential hurdles exist. It was understood that Eastern has 
other suitors including Denver billionaire Marvin Davis, members of Chicago's 
wealthy Pritzker family and Carl C. Icahn, the chairman of Trans World 
Airlines, all of whom might make competing offers. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, America West Airlines, desperately seeking a major foothold in the 
lucrative northeastern market, is prepared to outbid billionaire developer 
Donald Trump for the Eastern shuttle, the Washington Post reported industry 
sources as saying. 
</P>
<P>
America West officials would not confirm that a formal bid had been made for 
the Washingtion-New York-Boston shuttle service, but a spokeswoman for the 
Phoenix-based airline acknowledged that the company had been talking to Texas 
Air about purchasing "certain (Eastern) assets." 
</P>
<P>
It was understood that the unions initiated discussions with Ueberroth some 
time ago. After the strike by the International Assn. of Machinists began March 
4, discussions resumed. 
</P>
<P>
Talbot, representing Ueberroth, and representatives of Frank Lorenzo, chairman 
of Texas Air, have been negotiating for the last 10 days. Lorenzo has also met 
several times with Ueberroth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seen as a Challenge 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the talks said that Ueberroth sees not only a management and 
human relations challenge in seeking to preserve the airline but he believes 
that a significant degree of employee ownership is vital if service industries 
are to remain competitive in the decade ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth, who steps down as baseball commissioner this week, has steadfastly 
declined all comment since his name has become connected with the bid for 
Eastern. Pilots union officials, however, have made it clear that they would 
like to see Ueberroth take over the airline. Machinists union sources have been 
more circumspect, having earlier supported an Icahn bid. 
</P>
<P>
He would bring not only airline experience to Eastern but broad knowledge of 
the travel business. Ueberroth created the First Travel Corp., turning it into 
the second-largest travel agency in North America. 
</P>
<P>
Talbot runs his own real estate firm, The Talbot Co., in Newport Beach. He was 
one of the founders of Air California, which later became AirCal and was 
acquired by American Airlines. He served as legal counsel to AirCal before 
becoming its chairman. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, he was one of the founders and later chairman of Jet America, which 
was acquired by Alaska Airlines in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Air spokesman Art Kent declined to say if the company, which is privately 
held, was holding a board meeting today. But Frank Borman, vice chairman of the 
board, said that a meeting would take place. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the prospects of Ueberroth's bid going through, Borman said: 
"We'll have to wait and see." 
</P>
<P>
Borman was the chairman of Eastern for several years before being forced out 
three years ago, when Lorenzo bought the carrier. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the board of Airline Pilots Assn. met in Miami Wednesday and 
continued to express guarded optimism that the Ueberroth deal would be 
consummated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Await Court Decision 
</P>
<P>
The pilots and other parties involved in the Eastern strike anxiously were 
awaiting word on the decision of U.S. Bankruptcy trustee Harold Jones on his 
choice of a bankruptcy examiner. Earlier this week, he indicated that he would 
make his recommendation to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland by early 
next week, perhaps as early as today. The list of candidates includes former 
Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and securities fraud lawyer Leon Silverman. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Edward J. Davis will hold a hearing in Miami today in 
response to a motion by Eastern seeking to compel its pilots to return to work. 
Eastern contends that the pilots are waging a strike of their own, not merely 
honoring the picket lines of the striking machinists. 
</P>
<P>
About 90% of Eastern's 3,600 pilots have been observing the picket lines since 
the strike began and this has forced Eastern to cancel about 90% of its 
flights. The company began training a new class of pilots this week. There are 
just 35 recruits enrolled in the six-week course.

Maxicare Unit For Sale: Insurance regulators in Illinois, Indiana and Ohio 
agreed to suspend a planned challenge to the health maintenance organization's 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding in Santa Ana federal court pending an attempt 
to place Maxicare Midwest's 250,000 subscribers with another HMO. The 
commissioners gave Inglewood-based Maxicare until Monday to place the unit's 
current enrollees, reasoning that the income would help pay current claims. But 
they reserved the right to dispute the court's jurisdiction unless agreement is 
reached with them on a plan to pay off all pending claims of enrollees and 
providers, said James Schacht, Illinois' chief deputy insurance director.

L.A. FIRM SHUTS S. KOREAN UNIT; CLAIMS LEFT HANGING

<P>
A Los Angeles company has been accused of questionable ethics in abandoning 
operations at a manufacturing subsidiary in South Korea, leaving employees and 
creditors with $1.15 million in unsettled claims. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute erupted into violence March 22, when more than 200 employees of 
Pico Korea Ltd., a maker of cable television components that is owned by Pico 
Macom Inc. of the Lake View Terrace district, stormed the offices of the 
American Chamber of Commerce in a downtown Seoul hotel, breaking down a thick 
glass door and sending panicked office workers scurrying out a window. 
</P>
<P>
Riot police destroyed a wall to rout the protesters, who were demanding back 
wages and severance pay, before busing them back to their suburban factory. No 
arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
The workers, mostly young female assemblers, claimed that Pico's two American 
managers in Seoul left the country on the sly in late February and early March 
and closed operations without prior notice during a wage dispute with the 
company union. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the U.S. firm said they were forced to break off negotiations and 
abandon the plant after militant members of the union held company executives 
hostage and made demands that would have nearly tripled their wage and benefits 
package -- to the equivalent of $3.40 an hour. Wages and benefits for South 
Korean workers in industries of this type average a total of about $2 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Union representatives denied the company's claims and accused Pico Korea 
managers of lying to them, of issuing a worthless check for payroll and of 
disregarding South Korean law. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Grossman, commercial attache at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul, corroborated 
the gist of the workers' story and said he attempted to intervene to help them 
seek compensation -- until communications broke down over last week's incident. 
</P>
<P>
"My concern was with the image of American investment and how this will hurt 
other American firms doing business here," Grossman said. "But (the workers) 
resorted to violence, and no American will respond to violence." 
</P>
<P>
The conflict comes amid rising anti-Americanism in South Korea, which has 
ranged from protests over the U.S. military presence to denunciations of U.S. 
cigarette and beef imports. Labor disputes have flared recently at other U.S. 
companies with plants here, most notably at Motorola Korea Ltd., where violent 
confrontations between union and pro-management workers resulted in several 
injuries earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The approximately 300 workers at the plant that Pico Korea operated for five 
years in Puchon, west of Seoul, were confused and frustrated this week, with no 
practical means of redress in sight. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tragedy, but nobody will talk to them now," Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Mi Sook, a union leader, said their last contact with company management 
was on the morning of March 22, when they received a facsimile message from the 
ultimate corporate parent, Pico Products Inc. of Liverpool, N.Y., asking if the 
labor union and creditors would be interested in taking over the plant and 
managing it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"We became enraged," Kim said. "We went to the American Chamber of Commerce to 
stage a sit-in and ask for the help of American company presidents, when we 
were brutally beaten and taken away by the riot police." 
</P>
<P>
Chamber officials said Pico Korea was not a member of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard K. Hitchcock, chairman of Pico Products and of Pico Macom, said in a 
telephone interview from his New York office that workers had held two American 
executives hostage on three separate occasions until the company conceded to 
union demands. 
</P>
<P>
He accused the union, which was formed last November, of extorting wage 
increases of 10% and 12% a month. 
</P>
<P>
"We abandoned the plant," Hitchcock said. "We figured that was the safest way 
to operate." 
</P>
<P>
According to allegations by the labor union, the subsidiary's president, James 
O'Connell, left the country in late February saying that he was going on a 
business trip, and never returned. Negotiations with the union over wage 
demands were suspended Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining American executive, James P. Brainard, told workers to stop 
production March 2 and left South Korea the following day, the union says. 
</P>
<P>
The union charged that a $45,000 check for factory payroll proved to be 
worthless, although a South Korean managing director received severance pay and 
Pico Korea paid a fee to a local law firm, Shin &amp; Kim. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Labor Costs a Factor 
</P>
<P>
The company hired Shin &amp; Kim to settle wages and liquidate assets, but 
Pico's Korean lawyers apparently resigned after an unfriendly confrontation 
with the workers, said Marion P. Spina, an American attorney based in Seoul 
who, with the Embassy's Grossman, had attempted to assist in resolving the 
matter before last week's violence. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be quite unusual for a Korean attorney to get involved in a business 
matter, especially one as messy as this," Spina said. "It's very easy to 
believe that these Americans pulled a fast one, that they saw their labor costs 
were so high they weren't going to make any money for several years and they 
decided to bail out." 
</P>
<P>
Spina said he was concerned about the negative impression Pico's handling of 
the liquidation would make at a time when labor relations are going through a 
crucial period of transition, along with democratization and social change in 
South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
"The lesson is, 'Yes, it's true, the system is stacked against you, and even in 
a very clear case like this, there is no justice,' " Spina said. 
</P>
<P>
Hitchcock, however, said he is still trying to resolve the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I'm trying to find somebody to take control and liquidate the assets and 
distribute the funds," he said. "I had hoped the situation would cool down so 
we could clear things up without risk to someone's life." 
</P>
<P>
Hitchcock said the plant's equipment and inventory of finished goods are worth 
about $1 million, enough to cover any liabilities. He said the employees are 
owed only one week's wages. 
</P>
<P>
The union, however, maintains that workers were not paid for the entire month 
of February and that the company is required to make severance payments under 
South Korean law. 
</P>
<P>
The union claims that the workers are owed about $444,000 in wages, severance 
pay and other labor costs, and says the company owes creditors about $706,000. 
Assets in the form of finished goods, raw materials, equipment and refundable 
rental deposits total about $260,000, the union reckons. 
</P>
<P>
Pico Products, the ultimate parent, is listed on the American Stock Exchange 
and had sales of $15.8 million but a loss of $2.8 million for the six months 
ended Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Pico Macom, the California subsidiary directly responsible for managing Pico 
Korea, recently withdrew plans to sell 1 million shares of common stock because 
of poor market conditions and the problems with the Korean plant, Hitchcock 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the plant's productivity dropped despite wage increases, resulting in a 
January operating loss of $167,000. He said the cost of labor as a percentage 
of sales rose to 74% in January from 20% before the workers organized. 
</P>
<P>
The Korean plant was the only company-owned offshore production site, said 
Michael Holland, president of Pico Macom. The company subcontracts production 
of other electronic systems and components to manufacturers in Taiwan, China 
and the Philippines, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Karl Schoenberger reported from Seoul and Nancy Yoshihara from Los Angeles.

WON'T QUIT THE OIL FIELDS; 
</P>
<P>
WILDCATTER AND INVENTOR STILL GOING STRONG AT 89 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
E. A. (Ben) Bender is often called the last of the great California oil field 
wildcatters -- and, at 89, he has no thought of calling it quits. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he hopes to make a killing on the latest of his more than 50 oil 
equipment inventions, a long-stroke pumping unit called Prolift, in which he 
has invested more than 20 years and $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Three prototypes of the new pumping unit, which features a continuous 
mechanical stroking system, stand behind Bender's office, ready to be sold at 
prices ranging from $32,000 to $72,000. 
</P>
<P>
"These mechanical rigs, powered by either gas engines or electric motors, will 
mean much higher and more efficient production to the operator," said Bender, 
who has worked in the oil fields of Kern County for 66 years. 
</P>
<P>
He has done it all: roustabout, roughneck, mechanic, driller, superintendent, 
wildcatter, independent contractor, inventor. It would be hard to find an oil 
field production rig anywhere in the world that does not have something on it 
that Bender either invented or developed. He receives royalties from many of 
his patents. 
</P>
<P>
And he is still going strong. He continues to own and operate several producing 
oil wells. 
</P>
<P>
He was the third of nine children, born May 11, 1899, in a sod house on a farm 
at Fesenden, N. D. "On the farm, if we needed something, we built it," Bender 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
He left North Dakota and the farm, and headed West, arriving in Bakersfield in 
1922 with $6 in his pocket. He went to work in the oil fields. 
</P>
<P>
"Rent was $5 a week. A good dinner, including soup, coffee and dessert, was 25 
cents. The opportunity was here, and I took advantage of it," he said recently. 
</P>
<P>
In 1936, when steam was still used to power oil equipment, Bender assembled his 
first internal combustion rig and was able to bring in a well in eight hours, 
instead of the 10 to 20 days it would have taken to do the job with steam. 
</P>
<P>
As a wildcatter drilling for oil on gut feelings rather than scientific 
knowledge, Bender says he hit more dry holes than anyone else in the state -- 
62 by his calculations -- but he also hit some pay dirt. He has drilled 230 
wells in all. "My biggest bonanza was in 1962, in a field called Asphalto in 
the McKittrick area that produced more than 34 million barrels," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"There are never any dull moments. I've been stupid. I've been smart. It's all 
a matter of timing. I have made oodles of money and had a good time. I have 
been everywhere in the world, China, Russia, South America, all over the 
Mideast and Europe -- you name it. 
</P>
<P>
"I came at the turn of the century and have no plans to leave before the turn 
of the next century. I am in good health. I don't wear glasses. I have my own 
teeth. I don't worry. I don't smoke, and I have a Scotch and soda now and then. 
</P>
<P>
"Retirement isn't in my vocabulary. It's a dirty, nasty word. Two of my best 
friends worked for major oil companies. They retired at 65, and within two 
years they were gone."

Goldman Sachs Gets Capital Infusion: Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. said a group of 
seven major insurance companies have invested $225 million in new capital in 
the company. The New York investment banking firm said the insurance companies, 
which were not identified, will be passive investors and have no voting rights 
or role in the management of Goldman Sachs. The new capital will enable Goldman 
to "maintain our position as a leading global investment banking firm and to 
support our clients' market objectives," said senior partner John L. Weinberg.

Giuliani to Advise Japan: Former Manhattan U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, who 
led a crackdown on white-collar crime during his five-year tenure, says he will 
travel to Japan next month to offer advice on prosecuting insider trading and 
other securities fraud. The Japanese government is embroiled in a stock scandal 
of its own that has implicated government officials and is putting pressure on 
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita. Giuliani, whose office brought about 50 
securities fraud indictments in his term that ended in January, said he was 
contacted by private attorneys in Japan and will lecture to officials in Tokyo 
April 13-14. "I think it's very, very important for the United States that in 
other countries that are part of the world market that we have a similar set of 
rules," he said. "Otherwise we're at a competitive disadvantage." Japan has the 
world's biggest stock market.

CONTRACTOR GROUP SEEKS LATE PENTAGON PAYMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A number of aerospace contractors, saying the Pentagon is delinquent in paying 
its bills, have organized a group within the California Society of Certified 
Public Accountants, which is scheduled to meet today. 
</P>
<P>
The payment problems involve a Defense Department business office in El Segundo 
called the Defense Contract Administration Service. The office is in the middle 
of an administrative crisis that has prompted growing protests by the industry. 
</P>
<P>
The CPA group includes representatives of several major contractors, banks and 
accounting firms, who are all attempting to speed up payments. About $10 
billion annually is paid out of the office in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
A second contractor group organized within the Aerospace Industries Assn. met 
with officials in Washington earlier this month to lodge protests about the 
DCAS office in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moving Office to Ohio 
</P>
<P>
The contractors have alleged that the Pentagon is delinquent on millions of 
dollars in contract payments, which has driven some small shops into virtual 
insolvency and forced major firms to increase their bank borrowing. They claim 
that paper work is often lost or rejected by DCAS for trivial errors, forcing 
additional payment delays. 
</P>
<P>
But DCAS officials have sharply disputed the allegations every time they 
surface. Officials of the agency say delinquent invoices have been reduced by 
80% and that the long-term problem will be solved by moving the entire payment 
office to Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
However, it is the plan to move the payment office to Columbus that has 
prompted growing industry concern. The new office will be known as the Defense 
Finance Center. 
</P>
<P>
By locating the office so far from Los Angles, the nation's largest 
defense-contracting center, the industry is concerned that payment problems 
will be even more difficult to clear up. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting of CPAs is scheduled this morning at the Los Angeles Stouffer 
Concourse Hotel, near Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Wilson, acting administrator of the new Defense Finance Center, is 
expected to make an appearance before the group to explain how it will help the 
industry get paid more promptly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Hire Accountant 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, many contractors are skeptical that a centralized government 
bureaucracy responsible for paying about $50 billion annually will be better 
than a local payment office. 
</P>
<P>
At an Aerospace Industries Assn. meeting earlier this month, officials at the 
Defense Logistics Agency, the parent organization of DCAS, said they would 
consider hiring a Big Eight accounting firm to help solve the DCAS problem. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the association is expected to create another working group to 
explore solutions to the DCAS problems.

UNISYS, LIKE IBM AND DIGITAL, LOWERS EARNINGS FORECAST

Unisys Corp. said it expects to report a loss for the first quarter, joining 
two of its largest computer industry rivals in downgrading earnings estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Unisys, the nation's third-largest computer company, estimates that it will 
report a first-quarter net loss of $60 million to $80 million. It reported net 
income of $149.3 million in first quarter 1988. 
</P>
<P>
International Business Machines Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp. have said 
within the past two weeks that they expect their first-quarter results to fall 
below analysts' estimates, casting doubt on the strength of the computer 
industry and prompting heavy slides in their share prices. 
</P>
<P>
The company blamed several factors for the expected loss, including the costs 
of a government probe of defense procurement and low shipments of its 1100 
mainframe computers as customers await its new 2200 replacement series. 
</P>
<P>
The company also said a reorganization announced in January, including the 
restructuring of its U.S. computer business, would weigh on the first-quarter 
results. 
</P>
<P>
But Unisys said it believes that the loss is an aberration and that it expects 
operating results to return to more normal profit levels in the second quarter. 
Last year, it reported second-quarter net income of $162.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Defense Department suspended three Unisys divisions 
from doing business with the government as part of its investigation of fraud 
in defense procurement. All three of the units were parts of Sperry Corp., 
which merged with Burroughs Corp. in 1986 to form Unisys. 
</P>
<P>
Unisys said these unusual disruptive factors and continued industrywide 
weakness in the U.S. computer business will result in lower than planned 
first-quarter shipments. 
</P>
<P>
It also said the first-quarter results, which it expects to report April 21, 
will show the worse-than-expected effect of operational factors, including 
lower production runs and inventory reduction programs. 
</P>
<P>
But the company expects to improve operating results substantially as the year 
progresses.

'ACCIDENTAL TOURIST' COLLECTS AN EARLY OSCAR; 
</P>
<P>
GEENA DAVIS WINS FOR HER SUPPORTING ROLE AS 61ST ACADEMY AWARDS CEREMONY OPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Geena Davis won best the supporting actress Oscar for her portrayal of a wacky, 
sweetly aggressive dog-trainer in "The Accidental Tourist" as the 61st Academy 
Awards ceremonies got under way Wednesday evening at the Shrine Auditorium in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old actress, a former model who made her screen debut in the 1982 
hit "Tootsie," was a first-time nominee. 
</P>
<P>
Her Oscar brought the evening's first distinction to a film that enjoyed four 
other nominations, including best picture. The movie was based on a 
best-selling novel by Anne Tyler. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Warner Brothers' "Bird" won an Oscar for sound, the only category in 
which the Clint Eastwood-directed film about jazz great Charlie Parker was 
nominated. 
</P>
<P>
Disney's "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" also won an early evening award for sound 
editing. "Roger Rabbit," a huge box office hit, did not receive nominations in 
any major category. 
</P>
<P>
The evening's heavy favorite remained MGM/UA's "Rain Man." The film, about the 
adventures of an autistic savant and his car-salesman brother, led the pack 
with eight nominations, including best-picture and a best-actor nomination for 
screen veteran Dustin Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
The 51-year-old Los Angeles-born actor has been nominated as best actor six 
times and won an Oscar in 1980 for his performance in "Kramer vs. Kramer." 
</P>
<P>
Other nominees for best actor included Gene Hackman for "Mississippi Burning," 
Tom Hanks for "Big," Max von Sydow for "Pelle the Conqueror" and Edward James 
Olmos for "Stand and Deliver." 
</P>
<P>
By the time the stars began to arrive, the crowd out front waiting to greet 
them was estimated at 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Carr, the ABC telecast's producer, opened the show with a tribute to the 
Cocoanut Grove, which had been an early Oscar venue. 
</P>
<P>
In one signal change, celebrity presenters were instructed to say, "And the 
Oscar goes to . . . ," rather than the customary "And the winner is. . . ." The 
new formula was supposed to lesson the sense of competition among the stars. 
</P>
<P>
The show was being aired live throughout the world, including in the Soviet 
Union for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
A triumph by "Rain Man" would be particularly sweet for Lee Rich, Tony 
Thomopoulos and other deposed executives of MGM/UA Communications Co., who left 
the studio last year amid differences with Kirk Kerkorian, the studio's 
principal owner. 
</P>
<P>
The film itself had a tumultuous production history. It evolved from a much 
rewritten screenplay originally conceived by Barry Morrow, ricocheted from one 
director to another before landing with Barry Levinson, and grew from a small, 
arty film into a big-budget star vehicle backed by the powerful Creative 
Artists Agency, which represents its co-stars Hoffman and Tom Cruise. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, "The Last Emperor," distributed by Columbia Pictures, swept nine 
Oscars, including the best picture award. This year Columbia, under a new 
studio administration, had no nominations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Best Picture Nominees 
</P>
<P>
Other best picture nominees this year included 20th Century Fox's "Working 
Girl," Warner Bros.' "The Accidental Tourist" and "Dangerous Liaisons," and 
Orion's "Mississippi Burning." 
</P>
<P>
"Dangerous Liaisons," about the immoral doings of 18th-Century French 
aristocrats, and "Mississippi Burning," a reality-based film about the murder 
of three civil rights workers in the 1960s, were close behind "Rain Man" with 
seven nominations each. 
</P>
<P>
Any recognition for "Mississippi Burning" could trigger controversy, since the 
film, while well received, has been excoriated by Coretta Scott King, widow of 
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and various black groups for downplaying the 
role of blacks in the '60s civil rights struggle. 
</P>
<P>
The bellwether pre-Oscar awards pointed in several directions this year. While 
the Directors Guild of America honored director Barry Levinson for his work on 
"Rain Man," the Writers Guild of America bypassed the film to honor 
screenwriter Ron Shelton for Orion's "Bull Durham," a baseball picture that 
received no other nominations. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood Foreign Press Assn., meanwhile, gave its Golden Globe Award for 
best movie to "Rain Man," but presented a best-director award to Eastwood for 
"Bird." 
</P>
<P>
The best actress category did not appear to be dominated by any heavy favorite 
in the pre-Oscar handicapping. 
</P>
<P>
Nominees included Glenn Close for "Dangerous Liaisons;" Jodie Foster for "The 
Accused;" Melanie Griffith for "Working Girl;" Meryl Streep for "A Cry in the 
Dark," and Sigourney Weaver for "Gorillas in the Mist." 
</P>
<P>
All but Griffith had previous Oscar nominations, and Weaver enjoyed the rare 
distinction of a second nomination this year as best supporting actress in 
"Working Girl." 
</P>
<P>
If Neilsen ratings for the three hour-plus show have dipped over the years, 
Hollywood appears more enamored of its annual celebration than ever. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which sponsors 
the awards, a record 87 screen stars were expected to attend this year's 
black-tie ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Among the best-picture nominees, "Rain Man" was clearly the box office 
favorite, with more than $120 million in ticket sales so far. "The Last 
Emperor," last year's winner, grossed only about $43 million at the U.S. box 
office. 
</P>
<P>
According to Entertainment Data Inc., a box office consulting firm, Sigourney 
Weaver and Tom Hanks are clearly the biggest grossing stars among this year's 
nominees. Films starring Weaver have grossed $401 million since 1982, while 
films starring Hanks have taken in $415 million for the same period. 
</P>
<P>
As the show opened, Oscar officials scouted for guests carrying any of 40 
tickets that had been picked up by a man claiming to be a 20th Century Fox 
publicity official. The academy said it would press charges if it could prove 
that any guest knowingly tried to use a stolen ticket. 
</P>
<P>
It could not immediately be learned if any guest had been stopped for carrying 
a stolen ticket. No arrests had been made in the theft of the tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Despite tight control by the academy, scalped tickets sold from $500 for 
balcony seats to $2,000 for the best seats. 
</P>
<P>
This year the academy chose not to present its Irving Thalberg Award, an Oscar 
that is periodically given for sustained excellence in film making. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the award was given to Austrian-born writer and director Billy 
Wilder.

TOSHIBA TO ADD 1,000 PEOPLE IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Toshiba, one of Japan's biggest industrial companies, will nearly double the 
size of its Orange County operations by adding nearly 1,000 employees in two 
subsidiaries over the next 3 years, company officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion begins next week when Toshiba America Information Systems 
launches production of office copiers in Irvine, said Kiichi Hataya, president. 
The move is part of the rapid growth of Toshiba's operations in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"Manufacturing copiers here in Irvine is the latest in a long series of steps . 
. . to locate manufacturing closer to its markets," Hataya said. "We are 
experiencing an increased market for our office automation products" in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Work Force of 2,200 
</P>
<P>
The additional jobs, which will range from assembly workers to advanced 
engineers, would boost Toshiba's work force in Orange County to about 2,200 by 
1991. Ricoh Electronics, which employs 1,450 people in Tustin, currently ranks 
as the county's largest Japanese employer. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the growth will occur within Toshiba America Information Systems, which 
plans to increase its Orange County work force by about 840 people. A second 
subsidiary, Toshiba America Medical Systems in Tustin, plans to add 100 to 150 
workers by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese companies increasingly are moving production to the United States to 
take advantage of a weaker U.S. dollar, which gives products made here a price 
advantage over similar goods manufactured in Japan. Domestic manufacturing also 
helps the Japanese circumvent trade barriers and produce their goods closer to 
markets in which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to producing office copiers in Irvine, Hataya said Toshiba may move 
manufacturing of computer printers and facsimile machines from Japan to Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine plant plans to produce 1,000 office copiers per month initially, 
doubling production in 6 months. Within 2 years, production is expected to 
reach 8,000 units per month. 
</P>
<P>
The copier operation will create 150 jobs. Others will be part of an expansion 
of the company's current production and addition of unannounced new product 
lines, Hataya said. 
</P>
<P>
The information systems unit currently makes laptop computers, cellular 
telephones, business telephone products and other electronic gear in Irvine. It 
expects to post sales of about $800 million for the fiscal year ending Friday 
and forecasts sales of $1 billion next year and $2 billion by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The separate medical systems unit in Tustin posted sales of $97 million in 1988 
and expects to hit $150 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
Toshiba opened a 350,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Irvine in early 
1987. The company recently expanded the plant by 150,000 square feet to make 
room for copier production and other anticipated growth. It has also leased 
50,000 square feet of nearby office space. 
</P>
<P>
Toshiba has five U.S. subsidiaries. Three are headquartered in Orange County: 
information systems, medical systems and Toshiba America Electronic Components 
in Irvine. The other two are based in San Francisco and Wayne, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
All five are being restructured as independent subsidiaries of Toshiba America 
instead of operating divisions, giving them more autonomy than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
The five subsidiaries "will have their own corporate research and development, 
production and marketing facilities, and will be able to respond more quickly 
and efficiently to market needs," Hataya said. 
</P>
<P>
Toshiba began operations in Orange County in 1981, when it moved its industrial 
electronics group from Wayne, N.J., to Tustin. In mid-1987, Toshiba moved 
production of portable laptop computers to Irvine, its first local 
manufacturing operation. The company later began producing business telephone 
systems and cellular phones in Irvine.

A farmer whose water buffalo swallowed his wife's gold jewelry 12 years ago 
patiently waited for the animal to die a natural death, then recovered the 
baubles from the beast's belly, it was reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
When the unidentified farmer bought the animal in Kaithal, 50 miles south of 
Chandigarh, his wife fed it a traditional mixture of sugary flour from a basin 
that she had forgotten also contained her jewelry, the Chandigarh Tribune 
reported. The buffalo swallowed the woman's necklace, earrings and bangles 
worth about $2,000. Friends suggested that the farmer kill the animal to 
recover the jewelry, but he decided to wait until it died a natural death, 
which occurred Sunday.

A small commercial rocket carrying six experiments soared into space for a 
brief suborbital flight Wednesday in a successful mission for a fledgling 
private space company. 
</P>
<P>
Starfire 1, owned by Space Services Inc. of America, a Houston firm run by 
developer David Hannah Jr. and former astronaut Donald (Deke) Slayton, 
thundered into clear blue skies from this desolate Army rocket facility. 
</P>
<P>
"The launch was picture perfect," said Don Montoya, a spokesman at the missile 
range. "It went off . . . exactly when it was supposed to go." 
</P>
<P>
The flight of Starfire 1 marked the first commercial launch involving a 
privately financed payload, officials said. The $1.1-million flight was paid 
for by the Consortium for Materials Development in Space at the University of 
Alabama in Huntsville. 
</P>
<P>
The payload parachuted back to White Sands, landing about 60 miles from the 
launch pad. It remained intact during the fall back to Earth and was retrieved 
for analysis by scientists. 
</P>
<P>
Starfire 1 was designed to provide more than seven minutes of weightlessness 
for the six on-board experiments. The experiments were devoted to materials 
processing, including one using a small furnace to learn more about how alloys 
are formed in weightlessness and another focused on studying how liquids mix in 
the absence of gravity.

FEDERAL PAY RAISE SIMILAR TO DEFEATED PROPOSAL URGED

<P>
A private commission examining how to make government service more attractive 
recommended Wednesday that salaries for top Administration officials, judges 
and members of Congress be increased. 
</P>
<P>
The 36-member National Commission on Public Service, headed by former Federal 
Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker, recommended a pay raise that could end up as 
large as the one Congress killed last month after public opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Volcker would not speculate on whether he believed Congress would endorse a pay 
increase, but he said that, based on talks with lawmakers: "I do find some 
renewal of interest in the subject." 
</P>
<P>
House Majority Whip Tony Coelho (D-Merced) was more pessimistic, saying: "Will 
something get done this year? I doubt it. Something needs to be done but I'm 
not at all optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
The commission's pay proposal is similar to the one made in the final weeks of 
the Ronald Reagan Administration by a congressionally created commission that 
assesses federal pay every four years. Reagan and President Bush endorsed that 
proposed 51% increase. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Volcker commission plan, a pay increase of 25% would be effective 
immediately. A second pay raise would wait until a new Congress convenes in 
1991. Also, members of Congress would have to give up speaking fees, or 
honorariums, with which many lawmakers supplement their incomes. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, most members of Congress are paid $89,500, Cabinet-level officials 
are paid $99,500 and directors of various bureaus, deputy secretaries, 
assistant secretaries and other top officials are paid from $75,500 to $89,500. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also recommended pay raises for rank-and-file federal employees, 
but the panel suggested that the increases be absorbed into existing budgets by 
reductions in force and the elimination of programs. It also suggested that the 
pay rates vary from locality to locality, based on the cost of living. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Fraser, former president of the United Auto Workers and a member of the 
commission, said that organized labor generally supports the commission's 
report but disagrees with the proposal that pay vary from locality to locality. 
"It creates in many cases gross inequalities," Fraser said. 
</P>
<P>
Among other commission recommendations: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The number of presidential political appointees should be reduced from the 
current level of about 3,000 to about 2,000 and career officials should more 
frequently be considered for sub-Cabinet appointments. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The President and Congress should establish a public service scholarship 
program open to 1,000 students who would receive tuition and costs in return 
for a commitment to a specified term of government service. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The President should "set the highest standards of ethical conduct for 
those who hold the public trust, and act quickly and firmly to remove those who 
violate that trust." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The financial disclosure process, "while a key protection against conflicts 
of interest, should be streamlined to ease the burdens on potential 
appointees."

REGISTRATION TO OPEN FOR SPECIALIZED SCHOOLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
High school students in the Santa Ana Unified School District who are 
interested in enrolling in specialized curricula for the 1989-90 school year at 
schools outside their attendance areas can register Saturday from 9 a.m. to 
noon at several schools. 
</P>
<P>
Other students can enroll for the program when they normally enroll for school. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called "strand" program was created by the school board when plans were 
made to begin a specialized high-technology program at Century High School, 
which will open in the fall. School trustees decided that they also wanted 
specialized programs available at three high schools. 
</P>
<P>
The "strand" programs available are the visual and performing arts program at 
Santa Ana High School; information processing at Saddleback High School; 
intensive academics at Valley High School, and the high-tech program at Century 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
Space for students who want to transfer from outside the attendance area of 
their high school is limited. Registration will be held for each school at the 
respective school offices, except for Century High School. 
</P>
<P>
Registration for Century's program will be at the Regional Occupational Program 
office at 1815 S. Ritchey St. in Santa Ana, also from 9 a.m. to noon on 
Saturday.4/1

NEW ORDINANCE AIMED AT CURBING PROSTITUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As part of a continuing effort to combat prostitution, Santa Ana police tonight 
will begin enforcing a new city ordinance barring motorists from stopping along 
Harbor Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"No Stopping" signs have been posted on Harbor Boulevard from Westminster 
Avenue on the city's north end to Warner Avenue in the south, an area that 
police say has the heaviest prostitution traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the City Council approved an ordinance prohibiting drivers 
from stopping along Harbor Boulevard between 4 p.m. and 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Drivers who stop in the prohibited area will be given one oral warning, which 
will be documented, before an arrest is made, police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said police also plan to arrest anyone encouraging drivers to stop. 
Those who do so create a public nuisance, Thomas said.

ACCUSATIONS AGAINST DEPUTIES WERE LATEST IN STRING OF TROUBLES; 
</P>
<P>
COUNTY SETTLES JAIL BEATING CLAIM FOR $82,500 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reaching a settlement that focuses renewed attention on the management of the 
Orange County Sheriff's Department, the county agreed Wednesday to pay $82,500 
to settle a convicted drug smuggler's claims that he was badly beaten by jail 
deputies. 
</P>
<P>
In making the settlement, county officials admitted no guilt in the alleged 
beating. But attorneys for the plaintiff pointed to the payment as yet another 
sign of trouble in a Sheriff's Department hit by a string of embarrassing 
setbacks in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement came as a jury was to have begun hearing evidence Wednesday on 
abuse claims by Dennis Bierilo, 39, a former Anaheim weightlifter and now a 
federal inmate. He maintained that he suffered broken bones, bruises and 
substantial hearing loss from a June 4, 1983, beating at the hands of sheriff's 
deputies in Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Bierilo accused the deputies of beating him in retaliation for his having 
assaulted and seriously injured a Garden Grove police officer earlier that 
night, landing the officer in a hospital and Bierilo in jail. 
</P>
<P>
But just before a trial on those claims was to have begun, attorneys for 
Bierilo and the county, working in closed chambers in Santa Ana with Superior 
Court Judge Thomas N. Thrasher, hammered out an agreement that will pay Bierilo 
the lump sum of $82,500. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Richard J. Olson, spokesman for the Sheriff's Department, said he had not 
been told of the settlement and could make no comment. Private attorneys 
Timothy J. Stafford and Albert P. Ballog, who handled the settlement for the 
county, could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But Dennis L. Bunker, the county's claim manager and a participant in the 
settlement talks, denied Bierilo's claims that he was beaten in his cell by 
Deputies Mark Daigle and Greg Upham. 
</P>
<P>
"We never admitted any guilt in making this settlement," Bunker said. "We're 
not admitting any liability. It's just that you never know when you try a case 
whether there'll be an award against you." 
</P>
<P>
Bunker declined to discuss details of the case, saying: "We've resolved this, 
so I'm not going to air the evidence in public." 
</P>
<P>
One condition of the settlement, according to Bierilo's attorneys, was that the 
judge drop an order he had previously imposed barring lawyers from discussing 
the case publicly. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really important to us to make sure there was no gag order," said 
Bierilo's attorney, Kevin Barry McDermott. 
</P>
<P>
As critical as the financial award, he contended, was the message that the 
settlement sends about the Sheriff's Department's management. 
</P>
<P>
The case comes as the department has been the focus of criticism over 
embarrassing incidents centering on Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
These have included the escape of four inmates and criticism over the 
department's handling of that escape; the acquittal of a convicted murderer who 
said he escaped the jail in fear for his life; a $190,000 award to a political 
rival of Sheriff Brad Gates as a settlement of a lawsuit accusing the sheriff 
of harassment, and concern among county supervisors about the early release of 
some prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Riley's View of Problems 
</P>
<P>
Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley, while cautioning that he had not 
been told of the Bierilo settlement, said the case poses another potential 
problem for the department at a time of increasing public concern. 
</P>
<P>
McDermott maintained that in the context of recent events, the settlement shows 
"a real lack of supervision at the Sheriff's Department." 
</P>
<P>
Even though the county denies that the settlement is an admission of any of the 
claims, McDermott maintained: "You can't justify that entire settlement as 
attorney's fees. This agreement makes it pretty clear that (sheriff's deputies 
at the jail) administered their own form of street justice." 
</P>
<P>
Bierilo had sought $1.5 million in punitive damages and medical expenses 
against the county. But McDermott said he was willing to settle for far less 
than that figure because of fear that a jury might examine Bierilo's past 
record, which includes a federal drug conviction and be biased against him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Injuries as Entered Jail 
</P>
<P>
If the case went to trial, McDermott said, he was prepared to offer testimony 
from a nurse who examined Bierilo as he entered the jail and found none of the 
injuries he later suffered, as well as a Sheriff's Department surveillance 
videotape that showed Bierilo's condition. 
</P>
<P>
Bierilo, now in Lompoc Federal Penitentiary awaiting a hearing on a parole 
violation, was not allowed to be present at Wednesday's court proceedings. His 
wife, Ann Bierilo of Anaheim, said she is not satisfied with the settlement 
amount but agreed to it because she was afraid a jury would not give a 
convicted felon a fair hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still very bitter," she said. "I wanted to go to trial all the way with 
this . . . to show that (sheriff's deputies) had no right to take justice into 
their own hands and beat my husband the way they did."

UCI'S BECKMAN INSTITUTE, USC TEAM UP ON LASER PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN DAVIDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Beckman Laser Institute, a private medical research organization closely 
affiliated with UC Irvine, has entered into partnership with the University of 
Southern California to compete for a $15-million federal grant to develop a new 
laser technology. 
</P>
<P>
USC officials confirmed that there have been discussions about relocating the 
institute, which now leases property on the UCI campus, to Los Angeles. 
However, they said, institute work could continue at both sites if USC beats 
out six other universities seeking the U.S. Department of Defense grant. 
</P>
<P>
The Beckman institute's participation "helps tremendously" USC's chances of 
winning the grant, according to Pablo Valencia, a USC biomedical engineer and 
coordinator of the project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Premature Speculation 
</P>
<P>
UCI Chancellor Jack Peltason said, however, that speculation that the institute 
or its director, UCI medical professor Dr. Michael Berns, might move is 
premature. 
</P>
<P>
"We treasure the relationship with the Beckman Institute and anticipate that it 
would continue in the future," he said. "As far as I know, Dr. Berns is going 
to stay here." 
</P>
<P>
Berns declined comment Wednesday on negotiations for a move or a satellite 
operation at USC. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a faculty member at UCI, and I'm not moving my program right now," Berns 
said. He said it is up to the nonprofit institute's board of directors "to 
decide whether it is in the best interest of the institute to move or to stay." 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to reach board president Dr. Arnold Beckman were unsuccessful 
Wednesday. Beckman, the multimillionaire founder of Beckman Instruments, has 
contributed $5 million to the institute since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Star Wars Technology 
</P>
<P>
The proposed USC project is for a free electron laser, which operates at a 
higher intensity and broader frequency than existing ones, making a single 
laser potentially useful in treating a wide variety of illnesses, according to 
Robert Spears, assistant dean of clinical affairs at USC. The technology, which 
grew out of Star Wars weapons research, theoretically could be used to kill 
brain cancer cells without harming delicate surrounding tissue or to destroy 
the AIDS virus in the blood supply, according to USC officials. 
</P>
<P>
Research with the new technology at USC depends on funding, Spears said, and a 
decision on the federal grant is not expected for several months. 
</P>
<P>
UCI sources said USC's overture is aimed at recruiting Berns, and they 
expressed doubt that the institute or staff members would follow him. News 
leaks about the negotiations come at a time when Peltason has demanded an 
accounting of donations to the institute and compensation paid to UCI faculty 
and staff who work there. 
</P>
<P>
Berns, a nationally-recognized pioneer in medical use of lasers, is a professor 
of surgery and cell biology. He founded the Beckman Laser Institute in 1982 and 
remains the leading force there. The institute treats patients with cancer, 
vascular disease, eye problems and other ailments, and recently has performed 
widely publicized surgeries on exotic animals, including a boa constrictor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Private Donations 
</P>
<P>
Although the institute was built with private donations and is governed by its 
own board, it is staffed by UCI employees, and all research conducted there is 
done under the auspices of the University of California. Under a lease-back 
agreement with UCI, the institute must operate a research center on the Irvine 
campus for 30 years or forfeit its building and much of the equipment inside. 
The agreement, however, would not prevent the institute from operating a second 
facility elsewhere, UCI officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"From what we can tell, this is a serious recruitment by USC," according to one 
informed source who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "Michael (Berns) has 
threatened to leave a number of times before and never has. But the institute 
is another issue -- if they leave, they walk away from the building and the 
great majority of the equipment in it. If this is a bluff on Michael's part to 
get the chancellor off his back, then the bluff may be called." 
</P>
<P>
The source said that Berns recently angered Peltason when he formed a separate 
fund-raising group of wealthy supporters for the institute without UCI's 
participation. Peltason has proposed adding two paragraphs to the agreement 
governing the relationship between the university and the research center. The 
amendments would require financial reporting to the university, according to 
the source. 
</P>
<P>
The institute has raised $15 million over the last 6 years, including a 
$5-million endowment. Although Beckman is considered likely to take his dollars 
wherever Berns goes, university officials downplayed speculation that other 
donors would also be swayed. 
</P>
<P>
The only existing free electron laser is located at Stanford University, but 
USC officials said the addition of the Beckman Institute's technological 
expertise makes USC the West Coast favorite if federal officials mete out 
dollars with an eye to geographic balance. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to USC, finalists for the federal grant money are Duke University, 
which recently recruited the developer of the Stanford laser, the University of 
Utah, Northwestern University, Baylor University and Vanderbilt University.

KRAFT WANTS TO LIMIT HIS TESTIMONY TO 5 OF 16 MURDER CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Randy Steven Kraft's lawyers revealed Wednesday that he wants to testify about 
five of the 16 murders with which he is charged, but whether Kraft will testify 
at all is unknown because the judge refused to restrict prosecutors in advance 
from questioning him about the other 11 cases. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a difficult dilemma," said a disappointed C. Thomas McDonald, one of 
Kraft's attorneys. "No decision has been made." 
</P>
<P>
Kraft's attorneys asked Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin to listen 
privately -- without prosecutors or the public present -- to a "detailed offer 
of proof" about what Kraft would say on the witness stand. Afterward, the 
defense asked for a court order forbidding Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown 
from asking questions about any cases beyond those that Kraft would mention on 
direct examination by his attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Judge Refused to Hear Offer 
</P>
<P>
But the judge refused to even hear their "offer of proof" in his chambers. 
</P>
<P>
McCartin said he could not rule on whether to exclude questions about the other 
11 cases until after he has heard Kraft testify. But the judge warned that 
Brown, the trial prosecutor, might be able to persuade the court to let him 
explore some of those other 11 slayings if he can show that they are tied to 
the five Kraft wants to talk about. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I can give you the comfort you might like to have," McCartin 
told Kraft's attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
To McDonald, that response means that if he puts Kraft on the stand, the judge 
intends to allow Brown wide latitude. 
</P>
<P>
Brown has argued in the past that the slaying cases are linked. For example, 
Brown has said 14 of the 16 are linked because they are alluded to on a coded 
list found in Kraft's car. Many law enforcement officials believe that it is 
this list that Kraft's attorneys want excluded from any cross-examination of 
their client. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft's attorneys argue that if he is forced to answer questions about any of 
the 11 cases he prefers not to discuss, it would violate his constitutional 
right against self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, now 44, is on trial in Santa Ana, accused of killing 16 men 18 to 25 
years old, most of whom were sexually abused. If convicted, prosecutors plan to 
tie him to up to 45 slayings at a hearing on whether to impose the death 
penalty. Some legal experts call it the biggest murder case in the state's 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft was arrested May 14, 1983, when two California Highway Patrol officers 
who stopped him for a traffic violation on Interstate 5 in the Mission Viejo 
area found a dead Marine -- Terry Lee Gambrel, 25 -- in the front seat of 
Kraft's car. The victim had been strangled, with a mark on his neck the same 
size as his own belt, found in the back seat. 
</P>
<P>
After 9 weeks of defense testimony, Kraft's attorneys have offered jurors no 
explanation for the bizarre circumstances of Gambrel's death. Nor have they 
offered jurors much testimony about several pictures of other slaying victims, 
some in lewd positions that could have been posed in death, found in Kraft's 
car and at his house. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft's attorneys would not reveal which are the five deaths about which Kraft 
is willing to testify. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft attorney William J. Kopeny did not mention a specific number when he made 
his initial argument to the court. But after Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas M. 
Goethals shot back at him in a lengthy rebuttal, Kopeny reluctantly revealed 
that the defense was talking about Kraft's testimony in five deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Kopeny argued that if Kraft had been granted separate trials on each of the 
deaths, he would have had the right to decide which charges he wanted to 
testify about. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm asking the court to rule about constitutional rights," Kopeny said. "Does 
the defendant have the right to defend himself on five of 16 murder trials, 
without the court ruling he has given up his constitutional right on the other 
11 he is facing?" 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Goethals argued that Kraft may not in fact be waiving his rights on 
those 11 slayings but that no one will know unless he takes the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
Judge McCartin did rule that if Kraft testifies, prosecutors would not be 
allowed to cross-examine him about the other 11 cases without first warning the 
court so a hearing could be held on that issue. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft's lawyers were not satisfied that that was enough of a guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, who took notes during the hearing, looked intently at the judge during 
his ruling but did not let disappointment show. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors Goethals and Brown left the courtroom extremely pleased by the 
judge's decision. 
</P>
<P>
Kopeny left the courtroom saying "no comment" about whether Kraft would testify 
in light of the ruling. But earlier, Kopeny had said that if the judge did not 
issue an order at the hearing limiting cross-examination, "it will be a shame. 
It will deny Randy the right to put on an assertive defense. It will be a 
violation of his constitutional rights, and it will not be a fair trial." 
</P>
<P>
Goethals told the court that if Kraft decides not to testify in light of the 
judge's ruling, then "that's a tactical decision he has to make. . . . I don't 
envy him having to make that decision." 
</P>
<P>
Goethals has said outside the courtroom that the prosecution is eager to have 
Kraft testify. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to hear what Kraft has to say," Goethals said. "But we don't 
think he should be allowed to just get up there and give a speech. If following 
the rules laid down in this state over the past 100 years means he will decide 
not to testify, that's life. We can live with that." 
</P>
<P>
The defense is expect to present just a few more witnesses before either 
resting its case or putting Kraft on the stand. Once the defense rests, 
prosecutors are expected to have about a week's worth of rebuttal witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
After closing arguments, the case would then go to the jurors. 
</P>
<P>
If Kraft is acquitted of all 16 slayings, he would be automatically held in 
several slayings in other jurisdictions where he has either been formally 
charged or is a suspect -- including six in Oregon, two in Michigan and four in 
San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
If Kraft is convicted, his trial would move into a lengthy penalty phase. But 
the defense would be expected to request a delay before that phase could begin.

An Israeli Arab went on trial Wednesday charged with stealing classified 
documents and sending them to a group affiliated with Britain's opposition 
Labor Party, Israel Radio said. 
</P>
<P>
The Tel Aviv district court agreed to a request by defense attorney Avigdor 
Feldman to lift a news blackout on the espionage charges against Mohammed 
Massawa, from the Arab town of Baqa el Gharbiya. But the judge barred reporting 
the documents' contents. 
</P>
<P>
Massawa is accused of stealing the classified army and police documents from a 
paper-crushing plant outside Tel Aviv in July, 1987, and mailing them to 
Britain.

FAHD AND MUBARAK CONFER ON A SLOW TRAIN TO ALEXANDRIA

<P>
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt resumed their 
talks on the Middle East on Wednesday while traveling on a slow train to the 
Mediterranean resort city of Alexandria, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Crowds cheered and waved as they rode by on their way to Alexandria, 140 miles 
northwest of Cairo. Fahd and Mubarak began Wednesday's talks on the train and 
planned to continue them at the former royal palace. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said that Fahd, who arrived in Egypt on Monday from Iraq on a 
four-day official tour, decided to extend his visit by one day to devote more 
time for talks with Mubarak. The visit was the first by a Saudi monarch in 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said the talks have covered a wide range of Arab, Islamic, 
regional and international issues but apparently have avoided the thorny issue 
of Egypt's request for readmission to the 22-member Arab League.

TRYING TO SPEED IT UP IN A CRUSH; 
</P>
<P>
RESCUERS NEED IMPROVED TOOLS TO DO JOBS FASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
With a grinding of saws and a hissing of torches, would-be rescuers from all 
over California were testing their methods for freeing people from collapsed 
buildings this week -- and found their tools largely slow and inefficient. 
</P>
<P>
"If you had to go through many, many building floors to get people out, you'd 
be too late," said Robert G. Curia, a U. S. Navy structural engineer, as he 
watched firefighters use fancy power tools and just plain brawn to hack through 
concrete blocks. 
</P>
<P>
This conclusion was not unexpected for members of Urban Search and Rescue, a 
national group of emergency rescuers and others interested in improving 
preparation for natural disasters such as earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, emphasizing that point was part of the reason the group brought 
together about 75 California emergency planners, front-line rescue workers, 
engineers and equipment manufacturing representatives at UC San Diego's Powell 
Structural Research Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighter rescuers from San Diego, Long Beach, Los Angeles and La Habra took 
turns Tuesday showing colleagues from throughout the state how they would cut 
through a 12-inch-thick concrete column or a 6-inch-thick block wall to rescue 
someone. Their tools ranged from picks and sledgehammers to a state-of-the-art 
hydraulic ring saw and super-hot torches. 
</P>
<P>
Although the firefighters accomplished those tasks, respectively, in as little 
as 1 1/4 hours and 17 minutes, their tools still were not as good as they 
should be, said Frieder Seible, associate director of the UCSD lab. 
</P>
<P>
Seible helped Urban Search and Rescue in recent months to survey the types of 
equipment available for freeing people from the rubble of collapsed buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very surprised that most of the equipment consisted of simple hand tools 
-- virtually no heavy equipment," Seible said. "Either you have just simple 
hand tools or then you have huge equipment like big cranes that can lift 
basically half the building, but there's virtually nothing in between." 
</P>
<P>
Seible noted that this lack of special equipment is what kept a team of 
California experts, for which he volunteered, from going to Armenia to help 
with rescue efforts after the Dec. 7 earthquake there that killed 25,000 
people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Special Equipment 
</P>
<P>
"We more or less had to tell ourselves, 'Look, the only tools we have to offer 
the people over there are our hands,' " Seible said. "We did not have a piece 
of special equipment which would have justified sending a team over there." 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Seible said, Tuesday's exercise was intended to show "more the 
limitations of what we cannot do right now, rather than what we can do." 
</P>
<P>
This gap is especially important in California as emergency workers prepare for 
major earthquakes in heavily populated areas of the state, said Mike McGroarty, 
a fire battalion chief in La Habra and chairman of Urban Search and Rescue. 
</P>
<P>
Although hand tools such as sledgehammers or simple jackhammers can be 
effective, they just aren't fast enough, McGroarty said. 
</P>
<P>
"Time is lives," he said. "That's the bottom line. How long will it take to get 
the job done?" 
</P>
<P>
The U. S. Geological Survey has estimated that there is a 60% chance of a major 
earthquake, of magnitude 7.5 or 8 on the Richter scale in Southern California 
over the next 30 years. In the peninsular San Francisco area, there is a 50% 
chance of a quake of magnitude 7, the survey estimates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Compact, Mobile and Fast 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, the Whittier quake of Oct. 1, 1987, measured magnitude 5.9, and 
thus released about 1,000 times less energy than a magnitude 7 quake would. 
(However, the difference in ground shaking would be only a few-fold, since a 
larger quake is felt over a wider geographical area.) 
</P>
<P>
In a major quake, rescuers need tools that are compact, mobile and fast if they 
are to save lives, said Capt. Mike Burns, a disaster planner for the Los 
Angeles Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's demonstration in a plaza between the UCSD Engineering Building and 
its structures lab -- where quake worthiness of building techniques is tested 
-- firefighters were most excited by a ring-shaped hydraulic saw that could cut 
through 10-inch-thick concrete. 
</P>
<P>
Also garnering attention were "exothermic" torches, which burn at several 
thousand degrees Fahrenheit and cut through steel reinforcing rods in seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy versions of those machines have become common on construction sites, but 
remain rare among emergency crews, Seible said. 
</P>
<P>
Burns and McGroarty said Urban Search and Rescue is urging manufacturers to 
refine such new technologies to create machines portable enough to use in 
emergencies.

GILLIAM OVERRULED ON JURY SELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 9th U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday ordered U. S. District 
Judge Earl B. Gilliam to conduct in public all jury selection proceedings in 
the trial of Nancy Hoover Hunter, who is charged with fraud, conspiracy and 
income tax evasion stemming from the collapse of the J. David &amp; Co. 
investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam had ruled on Tuesday that the press and the public be excluded from 
parts of jury selection dealing with pretrial publicity. He said the potential 
jurors might respond more candidly to questions about bias and preconceived 
notions of guilt if the sessions are held without the press in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
However, ruling on an appeal filed by lawyers for Copley Press, the 9th Circuit 
said Gilliam's ruling "does not meet the standard necessary to restrict the 
First Amendment rights of the press and public." 
</P>
<P>
Jury selection, which is expected to be unusually lengthy, enters its third day 
today.

ON THE PROWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As land development in Orange County pushes into the foothills and former wild 
land, residents have had an increasing number of confrontations with the areas' 
native inhabitants -- the wily coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
The coyote, like man, is a victim of the negative aspects of growth. And like 
man, the coyote adapts, adjusts and learns to live in new surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
The coexistence, however, is not entirely peaceful. Nor is it always desirable. 
Housing tracts on the doorstep of coyotes' natural habitat provide the setting 
for dangerous changes in the animal's behavior. 
</P>
<P>
The coyote, according to wildlife experts, is a member of the canine family 
that generally fears people and flees from them on sight. But familiarity 
brings about a change, and in the peaceful setting of a housing tract, with 
plenty of food, water and local pets to stalk, the coyotes lose their fear of 
humans. They become more brazen. Visible. Lazy. And dependent on the 
residential neighborhood for the easy abundance it provides. 
</P>
<P>
Coyote sightings have increased dramatically from San Clemente to the Anaheim 
Hills. Fortunately, there have been no deaths or attacks on children since 1987 
in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
But pets have been attacked and killed. There is talk once again of employing a 
sharpshooter to hunt down and kill the most daring coyotes causing the most 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
That, however, is a stopgap, short-range solution to a specific part of the 
coyote problem. 
</P>
<P>
As long as land development continues to rob coyotes of their living space and 
people push farther and farther into their domain, the most effective approach 
is still preventive. 
</P>
<P>
Residents should not, under any circumstances, feed coyotes or leave pet food 
and water dishes outside where coyotes can get to them. Some cities, like San 
Clemente, even have enacted laws against such feedings. Trash cans should be 
kept tightly closed. Underbrush should be trimmed and children and pets closely 
supervised. 
</P>
<P>
For its own protection, the community must also not take from coyotes their 
fear of humans and their natural ability to hunt and survive in what is left of 
the county's brush country.

NBA ROUNDUP;

<P>
CELTIC BACKUPS ARE STANDOUTS IN VICTORY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Many people believe the Boston Celtics' front line of Larry Bird, Kevin McHale 
and Robert Parish ranks among the best in National Basketball Assn. history. 
</P>
<P>
Can you imagine this trio being replaced by Reggie Lewis, Ed Pinckney and Joe 
Kleine? 
</P>
<P>
Lewis is an outstanding second-year player, but he figures to spend most of his 
career in the backcourt. The other two have spent most of their three NBA 
seasons warming the bench. 
</P>
<P>
But as a replacement for the ailing superstars, they reached new heights 
Wednesday night at Boston, leading the Celtics to a 106-97 victory over the 
Portland Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
In the victory that put the Celtics a step closer to a playoff berth, the three 
put up some impressive numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis had 27 of his 35 points in the second half as the Celtics held off a 
surge by the Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
Pinckney matched his season high with 22 points and had nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Kleine had only nine points, but he also had nine rebounds and four assists. 
</P>
<P>
Bird, of course, has been out almost the entire season because of surgery on 
both feet. That is the main reason the Celtics are struggling to make the 
playoffs instead of fighting for first place. 
</P>
<P>
McHale has missed the last three games because of a foot problem. 
</P>
<P>
Parish, at 35, is having a brilliant season, but, after starting the first 68 
games, missed this one with a bruised knee. 
</P>
<P>
The win gave the Celtics a four-game lead over the Washington Bullets in the 
battle for the eighth and final playoff spot in the East. With 13 games 
remaining, they trail the 76ers, the seventh-place team, by two games. 
</P>
<P>
There is hope that Bird will be able to play by the playoffs, but team 
physician Arnold Scheller admitted Bird was allowed to return to practice too 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
Although Parish is expected to play Friday against Houston, there is no target 
date for the return of McHale, who underwent surgery on his foot before the 
start of last season. 
</P>
<P>
With backup guard Jim Paxson out for the season after undergoing wrist surgery, 
the Celtics picked up free-agent guard Otis Birdsong. In 14 minutes, Birdsong 
was one for four. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew this team always had character," first-year Coach Jimmy Rodgers told 
the Associated Press. "I guess we're getting good at fighting adversity. 
Practice makes perfect. It takes courage and determination to survive, and 
these guys are survivors." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 106, Milwaukee 102 -- In his new role of playmaker, Michael Jordan is 
still getting his points and the Bulls are playing outstanding basketball. 
</P>
<P>
In this game at Milwaukee, Jordan had his third consecutive triple double and 
the Bulls improved their record with Jordan at point guard to 9-2. They have 
won six in a row, five of them on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan had 32 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists. His six free throws late in 
the game preserved the victory and put the Bulls just 1 1/2 games behind the 
third-place Bucks, who had won 11 home games in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The Bucks led most of the way. They built the lead to 12 points in the third 
quarter, but Jordan and Bill Cartwright, who had 16 points in the second half, 
rallied the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls have beaten the Bucks in 13 of the last 14 times they have played. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago Coach Doug Collins had trouble convincing Jordan that the Bulls would 
be a better team with him at point guard. Now, he likes the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know whether I could handle it for a full season," he said, "but right 
now I like it. And, I'm learning. I have a way to go. It has posed problems for 
our opponents, though, and that's good." 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 108, Utah 104 -- Isiah Thomas keeps saying that the Pistons are the 
best team in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
This game at Salt Lake City figured to be a tough defensive battle against the 
Jazz, the leaders of the Midwest Division with a 30-5 record at home. 
</P>
<P>
It took double overtime to do it, but Thomas scored on a jumper from the corner 
with three seconds left to put the Pistons in front and Joe Dumars made two 
free throws to clinch their sixth victory in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons, who have won 18 of their last 20, have a 51-17 record, best in the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
The Jazz jumped in front, 10-0, but after their ace, Karl Malone, fouled out 
late in the fourth quarter, they were just hanging on. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 120, Washington 102 -- Moses Malone helped deal the playoff hopes of 
his former teammates a severe blow with 28 points and 16 rebounds at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
The Bullets had been making a menacing move to catch the Celtics until losing 
successive games at San Antonio and Atlanta. Now they trail by four games. 
</P>
<P>
Dominique Wilkins, who was 13 for 20 from the field, had 30 points and eight 
rebounds to support Malone. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana 96, Miami 89 -- Chuck Person keyed an 8-0 run to open the fourth 
quarter at Indianapolis as the Pacers ended the Heat's winning streak at three 
games. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacers, winners of five of their last six games, had only a four-point lead 
after three quarters, but Person sank two jumpers and the eight-point run took 
care of the Heat. 
</P>
<P>
Person scored 31 points and Detleff Schrempf came off the bench to get 20 
points and 13 rebounds. DAN HAFNER

CLIPPERS SLICE AWAY AT LEAD AND WIN BY 6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A night of close shaves for the Clippers began before Wednesday night's game at 
the Sports Arena, when Eric White played barber and gave teammate Ken Norman a 
haircut. 
</P>
<P>
Then the real cutting began, and the Clippers took a little off the bottom. 
Namely, they chopped away at Sacramento's big first-half lead and won, 114-108, 
to slice the Kings' hold on sixth place in the Pacific Division to four games 
with 13 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Just as important, for appearance sake if nothing else, the win before 8,678 
pushed the Clipper record to 16-53. Surpassing last season's total of 17 wins, 
which seemed doubtful a month ago, is suddenly a very realistic possibility. 
</P>
<P>
Such statistical-minded notions do not exactly bring hair-raising enthusiasm to 
Coach Don Casey, but it does show how far the Clippers have come since he took 
over Jan. 19. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't pay attention to the standings," said Casey, who prefers to find 
victories in areas such as competitiveness and conditioning. "Not now. To me, 
it's insignificant. But I guess if you focus on that, it would be nice to be 
out of the cellar." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers took another step to getting out of last place by winning for the 
fifth time in nine games, including their second close victory. Quintin Dailey, 
Benoit Benjamin, Charles Smith and Norman all had significant contributions in 
the final minutes of this one. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin, who had 14 points, 14 rebounds and five blocked shots despite not 
starting for the second straight game because of a bad stomach, tied the game, 
105-105, with 3:06 to play on a free throw. Forty-two seconds later, Norman 
rebounded a Benjamin miss and gave the Clippers the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Smith then scored the winning points on a basket with 1:13 remaining for a 
109-105 advantage. Sacramento, which got 26 points and 10 assists from Danny 
Ainge, stayed close, but Dailey scored three of his game-high 29 points and 
grabbed a crucial King rebound in the final 38 seconds to secure the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely the start of something," Smith said. "We're winning and the 
guys are playing well. The biggest difference in the whole thing is the 
emergence of Ben. The way Ben is playing now, it turns the whole thing around 
because we have the big man in the middle." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers trailed by 17 late in the first half, 70-53, but charged back with 
a 29-12 run for an 82-82 tie on Dailey's spinning layup with 1:44 to play in 
the third quarter. That was their first advantage since 10-8. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Ennis Whatley, who has played well since joining the Clippers from Wichita 
Falls of the Continental Basketball Assn., will be signed to a second 10-day 
contract today. . . . Planning is under way for a tribute to Norm Nixon, who 
retired March 16 after a 10-year career. It will be held at an upcoming game. . 
. . Ken Norman made 13 of 16 shots from the field, including 11 of his first 
12. He finished with 26 points. . . . The Clippers play host to San Antonio 
Friday night.

DESPITE A POUNDING, VALENZUELA ALL SMILES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

VERO BEACH, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In six starts this spring, Fernando Valenzuela's earned-run average is 5.76. 
Wednesday against the Montreal Expos, he gave up eight runs in four innings, 
including a grand slam by Tim Wallach, and left the game trailing, 8-1. The 
regular-season opener is four days away. 
</P>
<P>
So, why was Valenzuela smiling as he packed up his belongings before departing 
on the Dodgers' chartered plane to Los Angeles, where they will open the 
Freeway Series with the Angels tonight at Dodger Stadium? 
</P>
<P>
"Today, they scored a lot of runs off me," Valenzuela said after the Dodgers' 
13-11 loss to the Expos, "but it doesn't matter to me. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt pretty good. I was a little wild, but I pay attention to how I'm 
feeling, and every game I'm making progress." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, as windy as Holman Stadium was Wednesday, Valenzuela said he might as 
well have been pitching in Chicago's Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the time I tried to throw the first pitch for a strike," Valenzuela 
said. "Two or three of their hits were on the first pitch, including Wallach's 
grand slam. I'm happy, because I was throwing the ball in the spot I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
If the glasses Valenzuela is wearing this spring appear rose-tinted, then so is 
the mask worn by catcher Mike Scioscia, at least while they're on the subject 
of the left-handed pitcher the Dodgers need desperately to recover from the 
shoulder problems that limited him to a 5-8 record in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he threw the ball really well," Scioscia said. "His velocity was a 
little better, his pitches were sharp, he had great breaking stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"I was encouraged. I don't care what kind of numbers he's got, Fernando's never 
been one to have a good spring. . . . Fernando accomplished what he had to do 
this spring." 
</P>
<P>
Scioscia again asked for patience from those who expect Valenzuela to be his 
old dominant self overnight. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you can put too much pressure on one outing, make it a do-or-die 
situation, and if he doesn't do it, say, 'What's wrong with Fernando?' " 
</P>
<P>
The year he came off shoulder surgery, 1984, Scioscia said it was nearly July 
before he felt 100%. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to teach yourself how to throw again after having a problem like 
that," Scioscia said. 
</P>
<P>
"If Fernando does well at the beginning of the season, it will be icing on the 
cake, because by June, July, August, Fernando will really come into form." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela still isn't breaking 80 m.p.h. with his fastball, but he insists 
he's feeling stronger. "I'm ready," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers can only hope he is. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson tested his sore right shoulder in Wednesday's game, only the third 
exhibition he's appeared in this spring. Gibson had one hit in three at-bats 
and the Dodgers are waiting to see how the shoulder responds tonight. . . . 
Willie Randolph, whose wife Gretchen underwent an emergency appendectomy 
Tuesday, will remain in Florida. He will rejoin the team in Cincinnati on 
Sunday, the day before the Dodgers open the regular season against the Reds. . 
. . Chris Gwynn was the unanimous choice for the Jim and Dearie Mulvey Award 
given to the player chosen top rookie in spring training. Gwynn hit .468 this 
spring. None of the last five Mulvey Award winners are with the Dodgers now: 
Craig Shipley, Mike Ramsey, Reggie Williams, Sid Bream and German Rivera.

JONES PITCHES 2-HITTER TO SPARK TUSTIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tustin High School got by with the expected and unexpected Wednesday in its Sea 
View League baseball game against Estancia. 
</P>
<P>
The expected came in the form of pitcher Monte Jones and his overpowering 
fastball, which made a 1-0 lead stand up at Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
A two-hit shutout, nine strikeouts, only four balls hit out of the infield -- 
just another day on the mound for Jones (4-0). 
</P>
<P>
"Monte usually has more strikeouts," Coach Vince Brown said. "We actually had 
to field the ball a little more behind him today." 
</P>
<P>
Which is where the unexpected came in. 
</P>
<P>
The Tillers (7-5 overall, 2-0 in league play) have been anything but exemplary 
fielders. Already this season the Tillers' infield has made 16 errors, 
including five in one game against Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
But on Wednesday, the infielders made big plays whenever Jones allowed runners 
on base. 
</P>
<P>
With one out in the third inning, Estancia's Jason White drew one of the five 
walks allowed by Jones. But the rally never got going. 
</P>
<P>
First, Tustin third baseman Brian Gill chased a foul pop fly half way down the 
left-field line, making an over-the-shoulder catch. Second baseman Chuck Var 
then made a diving stop on a ground ball to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
With one out in the fifth, the Eagles (7-5, 0-2) put two runners on base via 
walks. But again, the Tillers' infield bailed Jones out as Var started an 
inning-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
"Early in the season, we were working a lot on hitting and our fielding kind of 
sagged," Brown said. "The last couple of weeks we've been putting in a little 
extra time on the fielding." 
</P>
<P>
Tustin certainly had a better time in the field than the Eagles, who committed 
two costly errors in the second. 
</P>
<P>
After Eric Grove doubled with one out, Var hit a routine ground ball to 
shortstop White, who bobbled it to put runners on first and third. Ted 
Wieczorek then hit a chopper that went through the legs of third baseman Gary 
Burrows, scoring Grove. 
</P>
<P>
In other Sea View League games: 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar 3, Newport Harbor 2 -- Reese Thorkelson's base-loaded single 
scored the winning run with one out in the bottom of the seventh for Corona del 
Mar (5-6, 2-0). 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback 4, University 3 -- George Canhem singled home Sean Simon with no 
outs in the top of the seventh for Saddleback (6-6, 2-0).

THE NHL / TRACY DODDS; 
</P>
<P>
MALARCHUK IS SALUTED AFTER HIS CLOSE CALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Tracy Dodds 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clint Malarchuk of Buffalo got a one-minute standing ovation from his hometown 
crowd for just showing up and giving a wave before the Sabres' game last Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder the fans were so glad to see the goaltender. The last sight they had 
of him was chilling. Last Wednesday night, during the first period of a game 
against the St. Louis Blues, the crowd of 14,448 had watched in stunned silence 
as Malarchuk knelt in the crease with blood gushing from a partially severed 
jugular vein. 
</P>
<P>
Uwe Krupp of Buffalo and Steve Tuttle of St. Louis had collided with Malarchuk 
and they all had slid back into the goal. But only Malarchuk was injured, 
apparently by a skate blade. 
</P>
<P>
Surgery to repair his neck injuries, which included a severed muscle, took an 
hour and a half. But he was well enough to hold a press conference the next day 
in which he broke down and cried when he talked about how close he had come to 
dying. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo Coach Ted Sator said: "There's a time in sport when winning and losing 
doesn't take precedence. I think the bottom line is that our medical staff 
might have saved a life tonight on the ice." 
</P>
<P>
Malarchuk said Friday night that he was confident he would be ready for the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Referee Bob Hall instructed David Courtney, Kings' director of media relations, 
not to announce that Marty McSorley had been assessed double game misconduct 
penalties for not leaving the ice when he was told to leave after the fracas in 
a game against Edmonton last week. 
</P>
<P>
McSorley didn't even hear about the double game misconduct until he was back in 
the dressing room. 
</P>
<P>
So the officials didn't have to deal with reaction -- from him or the sellout 
crowd of 16,005. 
</P>
<P>
It took from Saturday night until Monday morning for the Kings to get a ruling 
from the National Hockey League on whether McSorley would be sitting out two 
games or three games because of his infraction. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, when Joel Otto of the Calgary Flames pinned referee Bob Finn, repeatedly 
pushing him back down to the ice, the Flames were told that night that Otto was 
suspended for just three games. 
</P>
<P>
NHL officials didn't even need to see tape of the incident to decide that the 
suspension should be three games and not, as many at the game expected, 20. 
</P>
<P>
Go figure. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary Coach Terry Crisp is looking ahead to the playoffs, but he's not 
looking past his first-round matchup with the Vancouver Canucks. 
</P>
<P>
Crisp went to Vancouver to scout the Canucks in a game against the Oilers last 
week while his players spent three days in Newport Beach before a game against 
the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
"The Canucks aren't a surprise to us at all," Crisp told Vancouver reporters, 
giving no special credence to his team's 6-1-1 record against the Canucks. "We 
know how well they're capable of playing. . . . Take your stats and put them in 
a shredder, because they don't mean anything in the playoffs. The goals 
against, the goals for, the power play, the penalty killing, it means zilch. 
Nothing." 
</P>
<P>
After Jim Wiemer scored the winning goal for the Kings against the Oilers 
Tuesday night, Edmonton Coach Glen Sather was asked about the March 7 trade in 
which he sent Wiemer to the Kings. He bristled. 
</P>
<P>
"If there was any kind of advantage, I thought it would have been in our 
favor," he said. "He's 30 years old (28, really) and slow to the outside. He 
scored on a fluky goal. Big deal, it happened. It's certainly not going to make 
or break the season because Jim Wiemer scored a goal against us. It's not as if 
he's a superstar. What do you want me to say?" 
</P>
<P>
That slow, old Wiemer scored a goal in the Kings' next game, at Calgary, too. 
</P>
<P>
There wasn't a penalty called when Mark Hunter of the Flames hit New York 
Rangers defenseman Michel Petit with his stick in a game two weeks ago. But 
when Ranger General Manager Phil Esposito saw the incident on tape, he sent a 
copy to league headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
So the Flames are thinking about asking the league to look into Petit's slash 
on right winger Hakan Loob during the same game. 
</P>
<P>
Said Flame General Manager Cliff Fletcher: "Maybe we should hire somebody full 
time to look at every tape of every game played." 
</P>
<P>
In his first eight seasons in the NHL, Wayne Gretzky won the Hart Trophy as the 
league's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Mario Lemieux won it. And it would seem that Lemieux, as the highest 
scorer in the league, would be Gretzky's main competition this season, too. But 
there seems to be a groundswell of support for Steve Yzerman, for playing so 
well and for holding his team together through the Bob Probert incident. 
</P>
<P>
It will be an interesting vote. If impact on the team is going to take 
precedence over points, though, the choice has to be for Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
There is one problem with Edmonton Coach Glen Sather's accusation that 
Gretzky's critical comments were an attempt to gain a psychological edge over 
the Oilers going into next week's playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, who took Sather to task for his part in the trade, made those comments 
in an interview with Jim Lampley last November and the syndicated program was 
first aired in Los Angeles last December, Lampley said. 
</P>
<P>
So much for Gretzky's timing. 
</P>
<P>
Hockey Notes 
</P>
<P>
Paul Coffey, who played for years with Wayne Gretzky in Edmonton, is still 
among the top scorers (sixth) in the league now that he's playing with Mario 
Lemieux in Pittsburgh. Coffey said: "It's pretty much like it was with Wayne. 
We seem to be developing the same kind of chemistry." . . . On Lanny McDonald's 
500th goal, scored against rookie Mark Fitzpatrick, Flame goalie coach Glenn 
Hall said: "The kid shouldn't feel bad. Lanny beat him with a wrap-around shot 
off the post. That's tough to stop." . . . Teammate Joe Nieuwendyk was lined up 
behind McDonald in the runway to the ice as they waited to skate out to 
acknowledge being selected stars of the game when Nieuwendyk inched his way to 
the front. Some guessed that he was teasing McDonald, suggesting that McDonald 
would be the No. 1 star. "I just wanted to get out there onto our bench," 
Nieuwendyk said. "I wanted to see how the crowd would react for him." 
</P>
<P>
With each victory Calgary adds to its club record for most victories in a 
single season. It was 49. . . . In the fight for which Marty McSorley was 
suspended, teammate Igor Liba was holding onto the Flames' Gary Roberts when 
McSorley took a punch at Roberts. Roberts ducked and McSorley hit Liba right in 
the face. 
</P>
<P>
The Islanders' fall from first place in the Patrick Division a year ago to last 
place is unprecedented since expansion brought on divisions in 1967. . . . 
Calgary's Mike Vernon is the only goalie with three consecutive 30-win seasons. 
. . . Last season only Calgary won 30 or more games outside its division. This 
season Calgary is 31-10-5 against teams outside its division, Montreal is 
30-10-6 and the Kings are 30-15-3. . . . Calgary's affiliate in the 
International Hockey League, the Milwaukee Admirals, has won eight straight and 
has set a club record with 50 victories.

RED WINGS BEAT RANGERS, CLINCH DIVISION TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Yzerman had only an assist Wednesday night at Detroit as the Red Wings 
beat the New York Rangers, 4-3, to win their second consecutive Norris Division 
title. 
</P>
<P>
But make no mistake, the Red Wings repeated because the 23-year-old center had 
a fabulous season. When he set up rookie Brent Fedyk's first National Hockey 
League goal in the second period to give the Wings a 3-1 lead, it was his 90th 
assist. 
</P>
<P>
He also has 64 goals and is the league's third-leading scorer. There are some 
who believe Yzerman is more valuable to the Wings than Mario Lemieux and Wayne 
Gretzky are to their respective teams. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe, he's just the third-best player in the league," Detroit Coach Jacques 
Demers said. "But he should be considered for the Hart Trophy (MVP) for what he 
means to this club. He almost never has a bad shift." 
</P>
<P>
While the Red Wings were eliminating St. Louis with just three games left in 
the regular season, the Rangers were missing a chance to move into second place 
ahead of Pittsburgh in the Patrick Division. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best of the two," Demers said. "For what we went through this 
hectic season, there's nothing that compares to this one." 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 3, Minnesota 1 -- The Maple Leafs just won't go away. They remained two 
points behind Chicago in the battle for the final playoff position in the 
Norris Division with the victory at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Vince Damphousse's goal late in the second period broke a 1-1 tie and Al 
Iafrate clinched the victory with his 13th goal at 13:39 of the final period. 
</P>
<P>
The Maple Leafs didn't seem to have much of a chance just a week ago, when they 
were six points behind the Blackhawks with six games remaining. Now, they are 
two points behind with two games left. The Leafs are at St. Louis Saturday 
night and Chicago Sunday. The Blackhawks are at Hartford Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 3, Quebec 1 -- Dirk Graham scored the tiebreaking goal just before the 
two-minute mark of the final period at Chicago and the Blackhawks maintained 
their lead over Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Graham picked off an errant pass at center ice and then scored his 32nd goal of 
the season to break a 1-1 tie. 
</P>
<P>
If the Blackhawks and Maple Leafs tie in points at the end of the season, the 
winner will be determined by most victories. The Maple Leafs have the edge with 
28 victories. The Blackhawks have won 26 games. 
</P>
<P>
Darin Kimble of the Nordiques was suspended for eight games because he slashed 
Ulf Samuelsson of Hartford on March 23. 
</P>
<P>
New York Islanders 5, New Jersey 4 -- Alan Kerr scored his second goal of the 
game on a power play 27 seconds into overtime as the Islanders won at East 
Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Kerr's 19th goal came off the rebound of a shot by Brent Sutter. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton 5, Vancouver 2 -- The Oilers gained the victory at Vancouver, but lost 
their chance to finish second when the Kings won in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers, defending Stanley Cup champions, finished second in the Smythe 
Division last season. But this time they have lost home-ice advantage for the 
first series against the Kings. DAN HAFNER

NEWSWIRE: REPORT SAYS ROSE FINED FOR CURRENCY VIOLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pete Rose brought $46,197.54 in cash into the United States from Japan in 1981 
without declaring the money and was fined half the amount, Sports Illustrated 
reported in its April 3 issue. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine also said that the Cincinnati Reds manager consulted with at least 
one of his former players for advice on picking horses to bet on. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine reported that it was told by a senior U.S. Customs official that 
Rose was investigated at least twice for currency violations. In 1981, 
according to the magazine, Rose failed to declare the cash he had received from 
Mizuno, a Japanese sporting goods company that he endorses. 
</P>
<P>
In editions released Wednesday, the magazine said it also uncovered further 
information on its report last week that Rose exchanged hand signals relating 
to baseball betting. Sports Illustrated reported that a source close to a 
federal investigation said that Paul Janszen, a friend of Rose's, said Rose was 
being investigated for allegedly exchanging the signals at Riverfront Stadium 
in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
"Two other sources close to the investigation said last week that the signals 
between Janszen and Rose didn't involve placing new wagers on games but related 
to updates on the scores of games in progress at a time early in the 1987 
season when the stadium scoreboard was not working," the magazine said. 
</P>
<P>
Rose denied exchanging any signals with Janszen.

MERGER SPECULATION FOR PARENT FIRM; 
</P>
<P>
FULLERTON-BASED BECKMAN ADOPTS TAKEOVER DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Merger speculation sparked heavy trading Wednesday in the stock of Philadelphia 
pharmaceutical giant SmithKline Beckman Corp., and the company's Beckman 
Instruments subsidiary in Fullerton said that it has adopted a "shareholder 
rights" takeover defense. 
</P>
<P>
A Philadelphia newspaper reported Wednesday that SmithKline, the subject of 
recurring takeover speculation in recent months, had discussed a merger with 
British medical supplies manufacturer Beecham PLC late last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Philadelphia Inquirer said SmithKline discussed merging its prescription 
drug business with Beecham and selling its non-drug businesses, such as Beckman 
Instruments. 
</P>
<P>
SmithKline has disappointed investors because its leading drug, the ulcer 
medication Tagamet, is faltering. The company has not found another major 
product to replace it. 
</P>
<P>
The discussions with Beecham broke up over the issue of who would control the 
new company, the Inquirer reported, and it was not clear whether the talks were 
continuing. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, SmithKline stock jumped $2.25 per share to close at $54.875 on 
Wednesday on heavy New York Stock Exchange trading of nearly 1.6 million 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
Beckman Instruments stock rose 37.5 cents to $19.75 per share. 
</P>
<P>
Beckman Instruments said its board on Tuesday approved a plan that will make a 
hostile takeover of the firm prohibitively expensive. The measure is identical 
to a poison-pill defense already in place at SmithKline Beckman. 
</P>
<P>
"We know of no effort to take control of the company at this point," said Jay 
Steffenhagen, manager of investment relations at Beckman Instruments. 
</P>
<P>
SmithKline sold about 16% of Beckman Instruments stock to the public last year, 
and SmithKline executives have said that additional stock sales or even a 
complete spinoff are under consideration to boost the parent company's 
lackluster profits. 
</P>
<P>
Steffenhagen said Beckman Instruments has not been told whether SmithKline will 
sell more stock to the public. But analysts said it seems likely because 
SmithKline still owns 84% of Beckman and the subsidiary will not be vulnerable 
to a hostile takeover unless more than half of its stock is in public hands. 
</P>
<P>
"You can infer that (adopting a poison pill) is a preliminary to more shares 
being sold to the public," said Samuel D. Isaly, an analyst at S.G. Warburg 
&amp; Co. "There's no other reason to do it, since the control of Beckman now 
is not an issue." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that although they have heard the Beecham rumors concerning 
SmithKline for months, they haven't heard of any potential big buyers waiting 
in the wings to snap up Beckman. 
</P>
<P>
SmithKline has also said that it is deciding whether to sell or restructure 
other subsidiaries to shore up its fading profits. The subsidiaries include 
Orange County-based Allergan in Irvine, a maker of eye-care and skin-care 
products, and Bio-Science Laboratories, the nation's largest chain of clinical 
laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
SmithKline bought Beckman Instruments 6 years ago, when SmithKline was flush 
with profits from soaring sales of Tagamet, which at that time had little 
competition in the United States. Now the product is besieged with competitors, 
and SmithKline has no new drug with Tagamet's profit potential. 
</P>
<P>
Beckman Instruments, on the other hand, is doing well. The company reported a 
9% increase in profits last year, to $42.5 million, and an 11% increase in 
sales, to $770 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company makes instruments for medical laboratories and employs 3,500 
people.

TOP MANAGEMENT MUST SUPPORT COMPUTER USE, MIT STUDY SAYS 
</P>

Unless top managers support the productive use of computers and other 
information technology with training and new corporate strategies, their 
companies may not survive the 1990s, an MIT study said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The findings were drawn from a 5-year research program conducted by the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and sponsored by Arthur Young and 11 
other companies, including American Express Co. and Eastman Kodak Co. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Young's 40-page report on the MIT study said executives should adopt a 
more liberal attitude toward technology. 
</P>
<P>
"Corporate executives may be blind-sided unless they understand its strategic 
impact, actively support it and contribute creatively to the use of information 
technology in their firms," the Arthur Young report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
William Gladstone, chairman of the management consulting firm, said U.S. 
executives should also be more alert about new technological developments. 
</P>
<P>
"In recent years, we have been . . . as a nation, slower than our foreign 
competitors, to anticipate new technologies and the vast markets they generate 
here at home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gladstone said managers could no longer afford to be passive. 
</P>
<P>
"The old process whereby the technology professional told management what will 
or can be done is reversing," he said. "Now, management must set the 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
Gladstone predicted corporate survival will also hinge on the way human 
resources managers introduce new technology to employees. 
</P>
<P>
"All of this means that people need to change the way they work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
John Sifonis, national director of strategic management consulting services for 
Arthur Young, said corporate success during the coming decade requires the 
strong support of top executives. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have a positive attitude, that trickles down" to lower levels of an 
organization, new technology will pay off, Sifonis said.

TESTING PLANNED FOR VIDEOCASSETTES THAT WOULD SELF-ERASE AFTER NUMBER OF PLAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reminiscent of the "Mission Impossible" television series, a major film company 
plans to test-market a videocassette that will self-destruct after the movie 
has been watched a set number of times. 
</P>
<P>
MGM-UA Home Video has decided to test the "disposable" tapes this summer in an 
undisclosed city, according to Herb Fischer, vice president of sales and 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
The mission of the new videocassette -- should studios decide to accept it -- 
will be to encourage the production companies to sell video rental stores more 
copies of a movie for the same price they would pay for fewer tapes with 
unlimited play. That would make it easier for movie renters nationwide to find 
a hot new release at their video stores. 
</P>
<P>
"It saves you going back three times to get the same film," said Steve Roberts, 
president of the Los Angeles-based S. Roberts Co. 
</P>
<P>
The company is consulting on the project for Rank Video Services America, a 
manufacturing duplicating company based in Torrance, Calif., that licensed the 
patent to the new product. 
</P>
<P>
Although these tapes will not go up in smoke when the limited number of plays 
are completed, they will erase themselves and cannot then be re-recorded, said 
Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
"It becomes inoperative as a normal cassette," said Bob Pfannkuch, chairman of 
Rank Video Services America. He said the technology for this type of 
videocassette has been around for 3 to 5 years. 
</P>
<P>
However, it will be the first test-marketing of this type of tape that could 
have a profound influence in the $8-billion videocassette industry. The first 
title has not yet been selected. 
</P>
<P>
Introduction of the new tapes, which will have green cases to distinguish them 
from the typical black cases, could meet strong initial demand for popular 
movies, Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
He said retailers lose from 5% to 20% of their potential business because 
frustrated customers who cannot find their first-choice movie leave without 
renting anything. 
</P>
<P>
A retail outlet currently pays more than $60 for a movie title and cannot 
afford to stock it in depth. However, with the disposable tapes programmed at 
20 plays, that retailer could buy the same movie for about $30, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The goal of this is not to replace the traditional black tapes," said Roberts, 
who explained that retailers would still buy the permanent tapes but would also 
purchase the green disposable movies for "depth of copy."

ACADEMY VOTERS SURVEY THE FIELD, AND SPREAD THE WEALTH 
</P>

<P>
Well, it did turn out to be "Rain Man's" evening, but not until the last few 
minutes, and if there was a message in Wednesday night's Academy Awards 
results, it's that parity has returned to Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
For two-thirds of the show, the academy voters seemed determined to give an 
award to every film nominated. As it was, 10 different movies split 17 awards, 
the most winners for one year in this decade. 
</P>
<P>
The major awards made the forecasters look smart and the academy predictable. 
"Rain Man" did win the grand prize (and three other big ones) and "Mississippi 
Burning," with just one Oscar for cinematography, did get punished for its 
highly publicized historical muddling. 
</P>
<P>
But gone, for a refreshing change, was the slate voting that has turned many 
recent Academy Awards shows into one-note evenings that kept some deserving 
people out of the Oscar resale market. 
</P>
<P>
"Rain Man," its director Barry Levinson, Hoffman and the screenwriters (the two 
of several who worked on it) may have fulfilled their roles as favorites, but 
there were no sure things elsewhere, and people looking for early patterns had 
to throw away the form. 
</P>
<P>
The final score shows "Rain Man" with four Oscars and "Dangerous Liaisons" and 
"Who Framed Roger Rabbit" with three each. But there were seven other films 
with one award each. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the spread represents a change in voting habits, or an absence of a 
film to rally around, it made for a great show and in some cases, the awards 
helped right some wrongs in the nominations process. 
</P>
<P>
That "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" won three of the six awards for which it was 
nominated may save the academy some embarrassment for neglecting the one 1988 
film sure to be regarded as a classic. 
</P>
<P>
The good news for observers of voter psychology were the awards given to films 
that were not box-office hits. The voters tend to favor those films that are 
both of substance and commercially successful (thus: "Rain Man"), and whether 
they even bother to see the other nominees is often questioned. 
</P>
<P>
This year, several winners came from films that failed to ring up big numbers 
at the box office: Jodie Foster as best actress from "The Accused," Geena Davis 
as best supporting actress from "The Accidental Tourist." 
</P>
<P>
More surprising were the awards given to "Bird" and "The Milagro Beanfield 
War," films that divided critics and sent moviegoers off to the video store 
looking for alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Both films were flawed, but the sound editing done for "Bird," which seamlessly 
blended old jazz recordings with fresh studio cuts done by contemporary 
musicians, was brilliant and deserved the award its four-man sound team won. 
</P>
<P>
David Grusin's Oscar for scoring "The Milagro Beanfield War" overcame even 
bigger odds, winning over popular John Williams' score for "The Accidental 
Tourist." 
</P>
<P>
The selective mood of the voters is a reflection of the kind of year the film 
industry had, and whether the spread is a quirk, one can hope it suggests a 
trend. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 slate of films was, on total, a marked improvement over recent years. 
The industry is still adjusting to its changing -- its older and more demanding 
audience -- and that means a wider variety of films. Nominees this year 
represented as wide a range of material as any in years, and they produced more 
winning films. 
</P>
<P>
The events last night played hell with the office pool, but it made for a 
better show. Maybe it's the start of something new.

THE ORIGINAL RAIN MAN: 'WE GOT IT ALL . . . '

"We did it! We got one!" 
</P>
<P>
Kim was sitting at the edge of a small dinner party in La Verne, peering at the 
floor and twirling a string when at approximately 8:30 Wednesday night, Dustin 
Hoffman was named best actor for 1988 at the Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
The party was the final destination of a long trip, figuratively begun in 1984 
when writer Barry Morrow met Kim, an autistic savant with extraordinary mental 
gifts, and decided to write the story that would become "Rain Man." 
</P>
<P>
The gathering of 10 adults and assorted children was held at the hilltop home 
of David and Cloyce Flaten. She's the sister of Morrow, who wrote the original 
story and co-wrote (with Ron Bass) the screenplay for "Rain Man." 
</P>
<P>
As the Oscar telecast went along, Kim, 37, (his father asked that Kim's surname 
not be printed) paced nervously from room to room, pausing to dispense his 
effortlessly spectacular mental computations. (Asked at one point how many 
seconds there are in 70 years, he instantly shot back the answer.) 
</P>
<P>
"We stand a good chance," he said. "AT&amp;T's Cliff Robertson won for 
'Charlie' in 1968. 'Johnny Belinda' won it for the (then) wife of the future 
President. She's now a wine heiress (on TV's 'Falcon Crest'). Her name is Jane 
Wyman." 
</P>
<P>
Kim's father, Fran, was watching as the early awards were handed out, and took 
a moment to update the story of his son. He said Kim has been addressing high 
schools and junior high schools in Salt Lake City, and his talks have been 
credited with bringing an increase of 20% in the reading rate there. 
</P>
<P>
Fran and Kim had driven here Sunday from Salt Lake City. "He wore his 'Rain 
Man' jacket and told people in every restaurant we stopped in that 'I am the 
original 'Rain Man'," Fran recalled. 
</P>
<P>
When at last Hoffman was named best actor, Kim tilted his head toward his 
father in an intimate, loving gesture. "This can only happen to someone once in 
a lifetime, and it's great," said Kim. 
</P>
<P>
Kim then paced the room nervously, flipping his hands and moaning with 
excitement, waiting for the other Oscar categories to be announced. Morrow and 
Bass went on to win for original screenplay, and Barry Levinson was named best 
director. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, "Rain Man" was named best picture. 
</P>
<P>
"We got it all," Kim exclaimed excitedly. "From now on, everyone will know who 
I am. The whole world will know I am the original 'Rain Man'." 
</P>
<P>
After one last party with Barry Morrow, Kim and his father will travel back to 
Salt Lake City this week. But Kim's story is ongoing. He is a prodigy who 
remains a mystery to medical science.

AUCTIONING OFF SILVER SCREEN'S GOLDEN PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christie's New York, one of the world's largest auction houses, is searching 
for Hollywood movie memorabilia for a June auction. 
</P>
<P>
Collectible's expert Eric Alberta arrived in town Wednesday to give free 
appraisals of movie props, autographs, photographs, costume designs, costumes 
and other personal artifacts of the stars. 
</P>
<P>
Every 15 minutes for more than eight hours, scores of memorabilia holders filed 
into Alberta's temporary office in Beverly Hills on Rodeo Drive, each owner 
bearing some unique piece of Hollywood history lifted from the silver screen to 
be placed on the auction block. 
</P>
<P>
"It's insane, isn't it?" said 58-year-old John Hunt, a retired Whittier museum 
curator who arrived early in the morning loaded down with several Marilyn 
Monroe photos and negatives, a signed Greta Garbo photo, Clark Gable's brass 
dressing room tag from MGM and a personal letter from Norma Shearer explaining 
why she turned down the role of Scarlett O'Hara. 
</P>
<P>
Alberta's day today is booked solid with more appointments, and on Friday he is 
expected to make house calls to appraise larger items and entire collections 
that cannot be carried in by hand. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the 50th anniversary of 1939, which was a historic year for classic 
film," Alberta said. ("Gone With the Wind," "The Wizard of Oz," "Gunga Din," 
"Goodby Mr. Chips," "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" and "Wuthering Heights" were 
among those released in 1939.) 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long time since then," Alberta continued, "and it's finally 
hitting home that this is part of our American heritage. Movies represent one 
of the greatest technological advances, as well as one of the greatest art 
forms, of the 20th Century. Whereas painters painted with a brush, (Cecil B.) 
DeMille, David O. Selznick and D. W. Griffith were painting their canvases on 
the screen." 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood memorabilia has suddenly become big business for auction houses and 
an undeniable investment for collectors. Appraisers such as Alberta have found 
it difficult to affix value to artifacts because there are no established 
buying patterns, so quickly has the popularity of Hollywood collectibles risen. 
</P>
<P>
In an auction held by Christie's two years ago, Charlie Chaplin's bowler hat, 
cane and floppy shoes were expected to bring in about $30,000. They sold for 
$150,000. A Gothic Revival oak desk used by DeMille, expected to sell in the 
neighborhood of $10,000, went for $121,000 in October. 
</P>
<P>
In December, Sotheby's sold one of two pianos used in "Casablanca" (1941) for 
$154,000; a 1938 radio type-script from "War of the Worlds" for $143,000, and a 
black-and-white Walt Disney animation cel from "The Orphan's Benefit" for 
$135,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The items that go for those prices are one-of-a-kind items," said Dana Hawkes, 
head of Sotheby's collectible department in New York. "But there are no 
precedents for prices; the market determines the price." 
</P>
<P>
It used to be that there was no market at all for Hollywood memorabilia. In the 
early years of film, costumes and props were mostly regarded as studio 
castoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody gave these things any value -- the studios never gave the property any 
value," said Gary Milan, a Beverly Hills dentist whose personal memorabilia 
collection includes one of several Maltese falcons used in the film of that 
name and the "Casablanca" piano that appeared in Rick's Cafe (he owned both 
pianos, but sold the upright piano used in the Parisian cafe flashback scene at 
the Sotheby's auction). 
</P>
<P>
"After the film was made, the property was given to actors, thrown out or even 
destroyed," Milan said. "Because after the picture was made, the piece had 
absolutely no worth to them." 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in the early 1980s, lost or forgotten Hollywood memorabilia items -- 
for a long time sold and traded privately -- began to surface in public 
auctions one by one, culled largely by collectors who salvaged them from the 
studios. The potential for financial windfall in Hollywood collectibles was 
realized in 1982 when Steven Spielberg paid $61,000 at a Sotheby's auction for 
one of the "Rosebud" sleds from "Citizen Kane." 
</P>
<P>
But the floodgates really opened wide last June, when a pair of ruby slippers 
from "The Wizard of Oz" -- one of seven believed to be in existence -- was 
auctioned off by Christie's for $165,000. 
</P>
<P>
And experts believe that may be just the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Shaw, an MGM childhood actor who is working now as a tour guide for 
Universal Studios, also has a pair of ruby slippers among his extensive private 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
"Both Christie's and Sotheby's have told me if I wait and auction them off, my 
shoes will probably bring a million dollars," he said. Although he would not 
confirm it, one source reported that Shaw originally bought the slippers for 
about $2,500 in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Christie's cattle call for Hollywood memorabilia has herded together a new 
batch of artifacts, with owners eager to capitalize on the rising auction 
fever. 
</P>
<P>
"The more provenance someone can show us the more likely they will get a good 
price," Alberta said. "For example, if you get a piece brought in by someone 
close to the Hollywood figure or studio and that can be verified, the price 
jumps. If the piece actually appeared in a movie, the price jumps. If it was 
used by someone famous, the price jumps again. And if it's a one-of-a-kind 
piece, the price jumps even higher. 
</P>
<P>
"One major mistake is people think that every piece is a ruby slipper."

VIETNAM FILM MAKERS, SANS VISAS, WON'T MAKE UCLA FEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three Vietnamese film makers scheduled to come to Los Angeles for a film 
festival opening this weekend at UCLA will not have their visas approved by the 
State Department in time for their appearance at the festival. 
</P>
<P>
"The Vietnam Film Project," to be held at UCLA's Melnitz Hall and then in New 
York and Washington, is intended to provide a look at the status of the film 
industry in Vietnam and to offer a glimpse into Vietnamese life. It will 
feature the North American premieres of several Vietnamese films never seen in 
the West. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen Thu, general director of the Vietnamese Film Department; Hai Ninh, 
director of the Hanoi Film Studio, and film director Hong Sen were to 
participate in a UCLA symposium to be held next Thursday during the festival, 
opening Saturday and running through April 9. At the symposium, the three men 
were to meet with Hollywood film makers who have made movies about Vietnam to 
discuss depictions of Vietnam on film. 
</P>
<P>
However, UCLA officials said they have postponed the symposium until April 29, 
allowing the men to travel to New York and Washington first -- assuming they 
are granted visas by the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
The "Vietnam Film Project" is sponsored jointly by the UCLA Film and Television 
Archive; U.S. Committee for Scientific Cooperation with Vietnam, based in 
Madison, Wis.; the East-West Center in Honolulu and the New York-based Asia 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
The visa applications for the three film makers were not filed on time, 
according to UCLA spokesman Clifford Gallo. 
</P>
<P>
"It was sort of a little problem on both sides," said Gallo, who said UCLA 
officials and Vietnamese authorities both contributed to the missed deadline. 
</P>
<P>
"It is more of a bureaucratic mishap than it is anything else; it's nothing 
political as far as I know," Gallo said. "They'll definitely be coming; it's 
just missed deadlines." 
</P>
<P>
Claire Aguilar, assistant film programmer at UCLA, said school officials simply 
did not realize how long the visa application process takes. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the State Department said they did not receive the applications 
until last week and that they require 15 working days from that date to conduct 
background and security checks. 
</P>
<P>
"What we do is send names to various agencies in U.S. government and if anybody 
has anything on them . . . then they let us know," said Frances Jones, 
spokeswoman for the Bureau of Consular Affairs. "We also check our own 
records." 
</P>
<P>
A decision on whether the visas will be granted will be made on April 11, Jones 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's working their hardest to get these things processed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA officials said that the postponement of the symposium will not interfere 
with the scheduled dates for the six films to be shown. 
</P>
<P>
"It's minor," Aguilar said of the postponed symposium. "It might actually turn 
into something more positive because by then people will have had a chance to 
see all the films and can have a kind of big perspective on what's happening in 
film in Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
"It's just too bad that the (film makers) won't be here to see the audience's 
reactions," she said.

CONTROVERSIAL NEW PYRAMID ENTRANCE TO THE LOUVRE OPENS IN PARIS

<P>
There were plenty of pre-birth jitters and confusion Wednesday under the 
controversial new glass pyramid at the Louvre Museum. 
</P>
<P>
As repair crews and cleaners made last-minute patrols through the acres of 
gleaming underground marble topped by the jutting 70-foot glass peak, 
distinguished American architect Ieoh Ming Pei was seen appealing to a museum 
guard to let him into a roped-off area of the new building. 
</P>
<P>
"But I am the architect," argued Pei, fumbling with his wallet in search of 
identification. 
</P>
<P>
Pei was eventually rescued by a blushing museum official. But he remained as 
nervous as an expectant father until his friend and admirer, French President 
Francois Mitterrand, formally inaugurated the impressive $300-million new 
addition to the museum Wednesday afternoon in a simple and elegant ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
After the ribbon-cutting, an enthusiastic crowd of tourists and onlookers were 
allowed to stream in, lending a spontaneous, populist feel to the grand opening 
of the structure that has been the focus of a lively French aesthetic and 
political debate for more than five years. 
</P>
<P>
I. M. Pei beamed. "You are never sure about these things until they are built," 
he said. As the architect spoke, a wash of brilliant sunlight poured in through 
the crystal-clear roof -- 793 panes of glass specially made from the pure white 
sand of a quarry in Fontainebleau. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Friday, the 650,000-square-foot new addition will serve as the 
entrance and reception area for the famous museum -- home of the Mona Lisa, the 
Venus de Milo, Winged Victory of Samothrace and many other great works of art. 
</P>
<P>
American visitors (there were more than 300,000 last year) will be especially 
happy to know that the new addition will include toilets, restaurants and 
multilingual information booths conspicuously lacking in the old museum and, 
indeed, in many other French museums. 
</P>
<P>
Whether this will help the tourists in their traditional quest to find the Mona 
Lisa and other major works remains to be seen. The new color-coded orientation 
guide released last week seemed not much more illuminating than the confusing 
old model. 
</P>
<P>
However, with spacious restaurants, cafes, cloakrooms, bathrooms and even 
separate lecture rooms for group tours, visitors will at least be more 
comfortable than before during their art hunt. 
</P>
<P>
Most visitors to the museum will now enter through a door in the glass pyramid, 
situated in the central Napoleon Courtyard of the giant, horseshoe-shaped 
former palace. 
</P>
<P>
Descending on escalators or a dramatic spiral staircase, the visitors arrive at 
a reception floor with information booths, banks of television screens, a 
400-seat auditorium, a large restaurant, a cafe and the main bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
From the reception area, more escalators lead to the three separate wings of 
the reoriented museum. In digging up the courtyard to install the underground 
complex, the builders unearthed the ancient ramparts of the early palaces and 
forts on the site, which have been kept as an archeological display. 
</P>
<P>
There is also an impressive new exhibit detailing the history of the museum 
from its days as a medieval fort to its modern vision, inspired by Mitterrand, 
to become the Grand Louvre, one of the world's largest and most technologically 
advanced art museums, by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The Mitterrand government has dedicated nearly $1 billion to this dream, which, 
along with the construction of the new Bastille Opera and a giant new national 
library, is seen as the president's personal, monumental legacy, in much the 
same way that the Arch of Triumph represented Napoleon I and the modernistic 
Pompidou Center reflects the rule of the late President Georges Pompidou. 
</P>
<P>
On a warm, bright afternoon that showed off his monument in jewel-like glory, 
Mitterrand was clearly happy. For the president, the museum and its 
controversial glass ornament had become a challenge not only to his government 
but, even more important in French eyes, to his good taste. 
</P>
<P>
Architectural critics mocked the design as "an annex to Disneyland." A Cabinet 
minister refused to move out of the building to make room for the new project. 
When construction workers made too much noise, the minister had them cited. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a very difficult birth, a sale histoire (dirty episode)," said 
an aide to French Minister of Culture Jack Lang. "But on a day like this, it 
all seems worth it." After all, the political problems were solved last summer 
by the defeat of the conservative government of Premier Jacques Chirac. 
</P>
<P>
The finance minister who was reluctant to move from his wing of the Louvre was 
forced out by the voters. Lang, a Mitterrand favorite, was reinstalled as 
culture minister to supervise the new building. 
</P>
<P>
Museum Director Michel Laclotte declared himself happy with the results. "I 
have always been a partisan to this design," Laclotte said. "The pyramid is not 
a gadget. The reason for the pyramid is to bring light inside."

EARLY ESSENCE OF ELVIS ESCAPES ATTENUATED ARTS CENTER SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There isn't a set of recordings more startling or enduring than the ones a 
then-unknown Elvis Presley made in 1954 for Sun Records. 
</P>
<P>
Wild and confident, with a force of personality that was pure because it had 
nothing to do with making an image and everything to do with just letting a 
fresh self leap into being for a free moment of expression, Elvis embodied and 
defined the alpha and omega of rock 'n' roll, right there in producer Sam 
Phillips' Memphis studio. 
</P>
<P>
To apply a Talmudic saying to rock history, "the rest is commentary" -- whether 
it be the Beatles, the Stones or any of the other great rock musicians to come. 
</P>
<P>
But don't look for any "Sun Sessions" vitality in "Elvis: A Musical 
Celebration," which opened Tuesday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
In its place, the show's creators offered a tame, attenuated version of rock 
'n' roll. They have bound rock's Prometheus to a tightly choreographed, 
fast-moving script. No great rock music -- especially not the music of the 
early Elvis -- can live by a script. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of exploding with fire and physicality, those earliest Sun songs -- 
"That's All Right Mama," "Blue Moon of Kentucky," "Mystery Train" -- were sung 
from behind a screen, with the first of the production's three Elvis 
impersonators barely visible amid a blanket of multimedia images. Elvis and his 
band looked like flickering ghosts behind that barrier; their performance had 
all the flesh and solidity of a holographic image. 
</P>
<P>
The first act of the show -- the one focusing on Presley's rock 'n' roll years, 
before he strayed from innovation in pursuit of movie fame and Vegas celebrity 
-- failed completely to acknowledge the collaborative nature of rock. 
</P>
<P>
The names Scotty Moore, Bill Black and D.J. Fontana -- the guitarist, bassist 
and drummer who supported Elvis in his early days -- were not mentioned, even 
though they were nearly as important a spark to rock's development as Presley 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
The show was too busy zipping through a dizzy array of set changes and flashing 
images to pause for a moment and evoke the give-and-take of a small band of 
musicians working in a collaborative community, which is the essence of rock. 
</P>
<P>
Besides being a great singer, Elvis was a savvy bandleader; you wouldn't know 
it from this tribute. 
</P>
<P>
The zest of rock was hinted at in a couple of instances -- notably a sequence 
in which Elvis and his pals staged an impromptu dance party at Graceland while 
film images of Bill Haley &amp; the Comets, Jerry Lee Lewis, the Platters and 
Little Richard flashed intermittently in the background. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Seaton, who played Elvis for the bulk of the show, was fully in command 
of the Presley look and style -- a very capable impersonator. (Terry Mike 
Jeffrey, who played the pre-1956 Elvis, and Julian Whitaker, who played Elvis 
in decline, gave less convincing performances.) 
</P>
<P>
A funny thing happened in Act II, which portrayed an Elvis gone to Hollywood, 
to Vegas, to seed -- an Elvis who hardly belonged any longer to the rock world. 
The more irrelevant Elvis became to rock's development, the better this tribute 
worked. It is the tragedy of his career, but Elvis transformed himself after 
1957 from a rocker into an entertainer, a conventional show-biz star, a 
follower of scripts capable of being replicated and captured in a 
by-the-numbers stage production. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the spare rockabilly arrangements of the early material, which needed to 
be infused with spontaneity and force of personality if they were to have any 
life, the more complex song arrangements of such numbers as "Jailhouse Rock," 
"Can't Help Falling in Love" and "Suspicious Minds" lent the music presence and 
bite that were missing in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
The Vegas sequences had zest and accuracy, and they delighted the near-capacity 
house. A cleverly staged Elvis-in-Hollywood segment brought some needed -- but, 
in this production, usually lacking -- insight by overtly mocking Elvis for 
lolling in a fantasy world of B-movies while the cultural explosion of the '60s 
went on without him. 
</P>
<P>
In a telling moment that provided the production's musical peak, supporting 
singer Collette Hill rendered a tough, soul-inflected rocker called "Backlash," 
drowning out Elvis singing a dreamy "Blue Hawaii" while real-life images of 
war, assassination and civil strife flashed on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
Those who loved the safe, sequined, show-biz Elvis who ruled Las Vegas will 
probably enjoy this "Celebration." Those who want to see a rock performance 
that takes chances, that moves unpredictably with the moment's mood and, above 
all, acts as an assertion of a real, breathing self, have a better chance of 
finding it at Jerry Lee Lewis' concert Saturday night at the Celebrity Theatre 
in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
The Killer on a good night is a more fitting tribute to the King and what his 
better artistic self stood for than this glitzy theatrical construct could ever 
be.

LIFE ON WHEELS: OCTC PLAN IS RUNNING ON EMPTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HOFMANN, Jan Hofmann is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember that fictional drive into the future we took last week, courtesy of 
the Orange County Transportation Commission's new 20-year plan? 
</P>
<P>
Well, don't unfasten your seat belt just yet. This week, we get the bill for 
our fanciful journey. 
</P>
<P>
That network of widened freeways, "super-streets," transit routes and expanded 
rail service projected for the year 2009 may not be the Tomorrowland of 
monorails and flying cars that some of us dream about, but it still comes with 
a price tag of about $19.6 billion, according to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
And if we add up all the transportation money we expect to have by then from 
existing sources -- federal, state, county and city funds, gas-tax revenues, 
various assessments, bus and train fares, etc. -- and if we scrape together 
every penny, we'll be able to come up with about $11.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
That will leave us about $7.8 billion short, or roughly 40%. To be more 
specific, we'll be $4.4 billion short for freeways, $2.7 billion short for 
local streets, $550 million short for urban transit and $77 million short for 
commuter rail. 
</P>
<P>
So why are the folks at OCTC planning a transportation future we can't afford? 
</P>
<P>
Well, frankly, the kind of future we can afford -- based on existing funding 
sources (pay close attention to those words) -- is a picture so horrifying none 
of us would want to look at it. 
</P>
<P>
By 2009, the county's population is expected to grow about 23%, from 2.2 
million to 2.8 million, even with growth management. 
</P>
<P>
There will be some transportation improvements by then, in any case. We can 
safely assume that the construction on the Costa Mesa Freeway will be 
completed. The super-street project is already under way, and we can count on 
an extra car-pool lane here and there. 
</P>
<P>
That's about it. 
</P>
<P>
So basically, although the OCTC doesn't quite put it this way, with our 
existing funding sources we can expect the county's freeways and surface 
streets to resemble that old "Star Trek" episode about a planet so crowded that 
some of its inhabitants were willing to contract a fatal disease just so there 
would be more room for the others. 
</P>
<P>
(Does that mean more people would consider car-pooling? Well, that may be 
getting a bit far-fetched.) 
</P>
<P>
So what can we do to avoid this nightmare? No, it won't help to call up 
Citibank and get an emergency increase in our credit line, although that would 
make a dandy commercial, wouldn't it? ("I was stranded on the Santa Ana 
Freeway, already an hour late for an important meeting. And I knew the only way 
to get moving again would be to add three extra lanes. So I got on the car 
phone and called the Citibank 800 number. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
("I checked our computer and saw that he was a good customer, so I authorized 
the increase over the phone. . . .") 
</P>
<P>
No, we need new funding sources, the report recommends, such as a 1/2-cent 
sales tax added to the existing statewide 6% tax. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County old-timers remember what happened the last time such a suggestion 
was made. That was back in 1984, and the proposal was for a 1-cent piggyback 
sales tax. The voters trounced the idea, many of them figuring that improving 
the freeways would only invite more growth. 
</P>
<P>
So we turned it down and the county grew anyway, about 10% in fact, during that 
5-year period. But the freeways did not grow, except for a 2-mile stretch of 
the Corona del Mar Freeway near John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, that project and the extension of the Orange Freeway from the Pomona 
Freeway to the Santa Ana Freeway, are the only additions to the county's 
freeway system since 1966. 
</P>
<P>
When you consider that we've been coasting for more than 20 years now, it's a 
wonder that traffic moves as well here as it does. 
</P>
<P>
Although Orange County's gross product ranks 10th among all the nation's 
metropolitan areas -- larger than that of 24 of the 50 states -- we 
traditionally haven't spent much of our wealth on transportation, unless you 
want to count all those BMWs and Mercedes-Benzes clogging the highways. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past 20 years, Californians in general, and Orange County residents in 
particular, have not invested in transportation," the OCTC report states. "In 
terms of per capita transportation expenditures, California ranks 50th among 
all states. In terms of California counties, Orange County rates 43 out of 58 
counties in terms of per capita investments. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of transportation taxes, 44 states have higher gasoline taxes than 
California. And in terms of California counties, 11 counties have adopted local 
transportation sales tax measures to deal with growing local traffic congestion 
problems," the report states. In our region, those counties include Los 
Angeles, Riverside and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, we could spend some time arguing over whose fault it is that 
Orange County fell so far behind, but that isn't going to solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, let's concentrate on what we're going to do now. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like any budgeting situation," says OCTC Executive Director Stanley T. 
Oftelie. "You look at what your needs will be, and you look at your revenues, 
and you try to balance the two. You cut some things, and you try to raise more 
money." 
</P>
<P>
The OCTC decided on a sales tax because it "provides the greatest revenue 
yield, self-adjusts for growth and inflation, is easy to collect (and) . . . is 
available to assist in financing all transportation areas," among other 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
But there are other options, such as a development fee on new construction, an 
employee charge, additional gas taxes, a worker's parking fee, an additional 
vehicle registration fee, and tolls on the proposed new transportation 
corridors. 
</P>
<P>
In public workshops on the plan held earlier this year, residents seemed to 
like the idea of user-based fees, giving them "equal or greater support," 
compared to the sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
Before bringing the idea of a new tax before the voters, the OCTC commissioned 
a survey of 600 Orange County voters. More than half (59%) said they would 
support such a tax. However, they "were skeptical about whether the funds would 
be spent wisely," according to the report. "Dissatisfaction with government's 
track record on planning for growth and transportation was clearly evident." 
</P>
<P>
The transportation commission's report recommends placing the question of a tax 
increase before the voters this November. 
</P>
<P>
But first, there will be a public hearing on May 8. 
</P>
<P>
Let's go ahead and get the discussion going before that. Would YOU vote for the 
transportation sales tax? Would you prefer one of the other options, or none of 
the above? Let us know. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
It's for You! (Or Is It?) 
</P>
<P>
Do you have a phone in your car? If so, we would like to know why you decided 
to go cellular. If not, tell us why you prefer to remain incommunicado on the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
My Other Car Is a . . . 
</P>
<P>
Is there such a thing as a one-car family in Orange County? If your household 
includes more than one person but only one set of wheels, tell us how the two 
(or more) of you manage to get around. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Watch Out! Slow Down! Turn Left! 
</P>
<P>
So many of us drive solo in Orange County that back-seat driving is becoming a 
lost art. But we'd like to preserve it by searching for the county's best -- 
and worst -- back-seat drivers. Tell us about your favorite candidate for 
either category.

Orange County's sometimes-elusive wildflowers can be easier to find at local 
parks and nature centers, where naturalists and rangers are available to help 
visitors with identification or to point them to the most colorful areas. 
Caspers Wilderness Park east of San Juan Capistrano and Santiago Oaks Regional 
Park in Orange are two of the best local areas to go flower-hunting, but all of 
the parks listed below have at least a few species of flowering plant. Each

DISCOVERY: TINY INN ACROSS THE TRACKS HAS OLD-ADOBE NEIGHBORS

Most of Carolyn Boyle's guests at her Hotel California bed and breakfast in San 
Juan Capistrano are of the romantic getaway sort, the kind who like to sneak 
away for a couple of days in an out-of-the-way little hide-out. 
</P>
<P>
One paradox, however: They often do their sneaking away on an Amtrak train that 
clanks right up to the hotel's back yard. And so much for obscurity. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the Hotel California, located directly across the tracks from the 
train station in San Juan Capistrano's Los Rios Historical District, is one of 
the more placid spots in town for all but about 10 or 15 minutes out of each 
day. It faces sleepy Los Rios Street, squarely in the middle of the county's 
oldest neighborhood, sharing the landscape with 200-year-old adobes and tall 
willows that droop over the quiet street. 
</P>
<P>
It also shares center stage a few times each day with the Amtrak passenger 
trains that stop just on the other side of the hotel's back stone wall. But, 
Boyle said, that's "all part of the ambiance" of the place and guests enjoy 
being a part of the passing railroad scene. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel likely is known to both residents and visitors as "that place across 
the tracks with all the gas pumps." Boyle's boyfriend, David Chorak, who bought 
and restored the property 4 years ago, has filled the front, back and side 
yards of the house with his collecting passion: vintage gas pumps, mostly the 
type that are surmounted by lighted glass globes. At night, those globes are 
switched on and provide a unique lighting effect around the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, the place is a jumble of amiable clutter. The front parlor and the 
dining room are furnished with antiques such as an old barber chair and an 
ancient floor-standing stove and are festooned with countrified geegaws of all 
sorts. The kitchen has an ancient Philco refrigerator and an even older 
Qualitor gas stove and oven, both of which work and are in daily use, Boyle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The single guest room -- the hotel accommodates only one visitor or couple at a 
time -- is largely taken up by an antique brass bed and a large armoire. 
</P>
<P>
When Chorak bought the place, Boyle said, it was covered in yellow stucco, 
looked out of place on the old street and had fallen into serious disrepair. 
Boyle said she and Chorak stripped the walls, replacing them with the more 
locally typical board-and-batten covering, pulled up the cracked floor linoleum 
to reveal the wooden floors and installed a stone wall to separate the property 
from the railroad tracks. For $125 a night, guests generally have the run of 
the place, Boyle said, as well as access to a pair of beach cruiser bikes for 
use on the nearby bike trail and birdseed for use at the mission.

JOSEPH N. BELL: OSCAR SEATS ARE JUST THE TICKET FOR SOME OF US 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I watched the Academy Awards last night more out of habit than either curiosity 
or expectation of any great entertainment value. And, I suppose, a little bit 
of deja vu. 
</P>
<P>
Except possibly for an invitation to a presidential inaugural, there's no 
greater one-upmanship than an invitation to the Academy Awards. I attended them 
for 12 years, and it was a sure grabber at a cocktail party. 
</P>
<P>
"Can we get together for some tennis Wednesday?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, I'm sorry. I've got to go to the Academy Awards." 
</P>
<P>
I was amused at a piece in The Times last week about the unsuccessful efforts 
of Judge Joseph Wapner -- who presides over TV's "People's Court" -- to get 
tickets to the ceremony. The motion picture industry's "A" list is tougher to 
make than a World Series for the California Angels. 
</P>
<P>
The public relations firm that handles the invitations for the Academy has 
listened to pleas from some of the most creative and most powerful people in 
the world, and they're impervious. The invitation list for people beyond the 
membership of the Academy is weighed strictly on what you have done recently or 
can do for the motion picture industry. When your usefulness ceases -- or even 
comes into question -- you're gone. 
</P>
<P>
I used to be invited because I wrote about Hollywood in what the industry 
considered highly important outlets (particularly the National Observer, the 
weekly extension of the Wall Street Journal). When the Observer went under, I 
continued to write about motion pictures for several highly visible national 
magazines, but I became suspect. And when entertainment became secondary to 
other subjects I wrote about, I was dropped instantly from the "A" list. My old 
buddies in the industry were sorry, but you know how it is, Joe. 
</P>
<P>
I know, but it was a good run while it lasted. The practice in those years (I 
don't know if this is still true) was to give the "A" list journalists press 
credentials and two guest tickets to the awards. I could sit in the auditorium 
with a guest or -- as I always did -- give away both my tickets and watch from 
the press room several floors up from the auditorium. We watched on TV monitors 
and then had the winners and presenters delivered in person to us. 
</P>
<P>
My wife tired of the fuss after several years, and so my then-high school and 
college-age children and some close friends had a rare opportunity to rub 
elbows with Hollywood royalty. We tried to use these tickets for people who 
would really be blown away by the chance to go -- and such people weren't hard 
to find. One of the most ecstatic was a student of mine at UCI named Stephen 
Silverman, who recently won a 3-year lawsuit against CBS to free him to put on 
a Broadway musical about Amos 'n' Andy. 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing quite like walking past the screaming bleachers full of people 
who have waiting all day to see their idols. They gawk as you get out of your 
car, then let out a distinct "naaaah" of displeasure as they realize you aren't 
anyone important. We would then wait just inside the door for the celebrities 
to arrive, forming our own set of discreet inside bleachers. There's an 
unwritten rule that the More Important you are in Hollywood, the later you 
arrive at the award ceremony, so there was always a lot of friction between 
ushers trying to get us to our seats and the desire to hang out for late 
arrivals. 
</P>
<P>
The action in the press room upstairs was frenetic. The foreign press would 
always arrive early and sweep the buffet table clean. Presenters and winners 
would be fed to each group one at a time, and it always appalled me that the 
technical award winners would be virtually ignored by reporters who would give 
all their attention to the presenters -- usually actresses with considerable 
decolletage who would try to retreat to the background so the sound or 
cinematographer winners they were shepherding could be the center of attention. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, there would be small dramas than transcended all this frenetic 
activity. The most vivid to me was the night Jane Fonda won the best actress 
award for "Coming Home" and Michael Cimino's "The Deer Hunter" won best 
picture. When the lights were off, and the TV coverage had segued into the 
sitcom that followed, Fonda and Cimino got into a fascinating and acrimonious 
debate about the liberties with accuracy Cimino had taken in his tale about the 
Vietnam War. I was one of the few reporters still hanging around and listening 
when it happened. 
</P>
<P>
I think on these things more than I pay attention to what is happening on the 
TV screen when I watch the Academy Awards now. And I guess I also wish I could 
make the "A" list one more time for the 11-year-old in my household who would 
happily give up his baseball card collection if he could go just once.

O'KEEFFE SHOW HAS GEORGIA ON ITS MIND 
</P>

<P>
"I think we're a hit!" declared Ilene Susan Fort, associate curator of American 
Art at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
She was referring to the impressive opening-night turnout for the Georgia 
O'Keeffe exhibition Tuesday, which drew about 2,000 O'Keeffe admirers into the 
Hammer galleries for the only West Coast showing of her work. 
</P>
<P>
Guests dressed in warm black tie and furs to brave the elements as they 
wandered through the open courtyard for the buffet dinner reception. The 
galleries were crowded early on, affirming O'Keeffe's enduring popularity and 
Los Angeles' current fascination with things Southwestern. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Southwestern Look 
</P>
<P>
Art patrons gazed upon the 35 oil paintings, watercolors, pastels and charcoals 
of still lifes, landscapes, flowers and abstractions. Some were even fascinated 
with the three black-and-white photographs of O'Keeffe that adorned the wall at 
the beginning of the exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
"We did the show in keeping with what O'Keeffe would have wanted," Fort 
explained. "For instance, the walls are not very strongly colored." 
</P>
<P>
Even the natural colors of the moldings and ropes designed to keep viewers a 
few inches away from the wall were in keeping with the Southwestern feel. 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't the only theme touch. The outside of the museum was bathed in a 
pinkish light and the cuisine was definitely Southwestern: ancho chile 
quesadillas, shrimp tamales, Indian corn pudding, fritters and bunuelo cups 
filled with pumpkin mousse and caramel apples. 
</P>
<P>
It was also a family event of sorts. O'Keeffe's niece, June O'Keeffe Sebring, 
attended the opening along with her children, Tom Sebring, Crina Bigelow and 
Karen Sexton. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so interesting to see the same paintings in a different gallery," said 
O'Keeffe Sebring, who had seen the show on tour at other galleries. "I find a 
different favorite that seems to speak to me. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing my aunt didn't want was for people to analyze her paintings," she 
continued. "She just wanted people to enjoy them. She was sharing her 
experience with someone else." 
</P>
<P>
Sexton said this was her first time seeing the works. "The thing that struck me 
most," she said after emerging from the galleries, "is how much of her 
personality was in it, the kind of emotions that come out of it, why she picked 
one particular part of a flower. These were the things she loved, and that's 
why she took the time to paint them and emphasize them." 
</P>
<P>
Seen milling through the courtyard and galleries were Oliver Stone, Eva Marie 
Saint and Jeffrey Hayden, museum director Earl A. Powell III and wife, Nancy; 
board of trustees Chairman Julian Ganz Jr. and wife, Jo Ann; Southwestern Bell 
Corp. CEO Zane E. Barnes, O'Keeffe estate representative Juan Hamilton, Eddie 
Albert, board of trustees President Daniel Belin and wife, Daisy; Dona and 
Dwight Kendall, Keith and Bill Kieschnick, Sheila and Walter Weisman and Anita 
and Julius Zelman.

STAMP OF APPROVAL FOR TINY OHIO POST OFFICE

<TEXT>
<P>
It was a cold, blustery day with a chilling wind blowing off Lake Erie as 
Bernice Mittower unlocked the door of the 165-year-old, tiny, white, clapboard 
post office. 
</P>
<P>
The post office is one of a dozen frame structures erected in the 1820s and 
1830s that were part of Lyme, Ohio, a 19th-Century town that never made it into 
the 20th Century, preserved as a historic village on the outskirts of Bellevue. 
</P>
<P>
Mittower, 72, is curator of the Old Lyme Post Office, now the headquarters, 
library, museum and only building ever owned by the national Post Mark 
Collectors Club. 
</P>
<P>
The old post office houses the largest collection of postmarks anywhere in 
America, more than 4 million postmarks from every post office in the nation, 
from hundreds of post offices that no longer exist. The earliest postmark in 
the collection is a letter canceled and mailed from a ship in Boston Harbor May 
5, 1793. 
</P>
<P>
Shelves in the PMCC library and museum are lined with large blue three-ring 
notebooks filled with postmarks on whole envelopes or portions of envelopes 
alphabetized by states, then broken down into cities and towns. Hundreds, for 
example, are from Los Angeles from the 1870s to the present. 
</P>
<P>
File cases are filled with postmarks. Shelves contain Postal Guides from 1789 
to 1989, histories of the U.S. Postal Service, books with information on the 
derivation of names of cities and towns. 
</P>
<P>
Collecting postmarks is the hobby of more than 800 members of PMCC who live in 
every state except Alaska and in nine foreign countries. California boasts the 
largest number of members, 78. Other leading states are Ohio with 52, Illinois, 
51, and New York, 45. 
</P>
<P>
"Our members are from various walks of life, including doctors, lawyers, 
merchants, ministers, teachers, teen-agers, retired people, a newspaper editor, 
the general manager of a Toronto radio station, an undertaker in Peoria, Ill., 
and a retired school custodian in Compton, Calif.," Mittower said. 
</P>
<P>
Vic Steward, 42, the Peoria mortician, recalled when he was 15 and started 
collecting postmarks from Illinois. "Then I began sending away all over the 
country for postmarks from towns with peculiar names like Peculiar, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
"One day I sent a stamped, self-addressed post card to the postmaster of Ninety 
Six, S.C., and when he sent me a postmark from his town he told me about the 
Post Mark Collectors Club. I never knew there was a national club for postmark 
collectors. I thought I was the only idiot in the world doing this," said 
Steward, who figures he has more than 150,000 postmarks. 
</P>
<P>
Postmark collectors swap with other collectors. They mail stamped, 
self-addressed postcards to post offices. They collect current and old 
postmarks. They buy old post cards and old letter envelopes at antique shops, 
swap meets and flea markets. They have companies, friends and relatives give 
them canceled envelopes. They ask almost everybody they encounter if they have 
old letters or post cards stashed away in the attic or basements. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in Hamilton, a little town in Utah, in a small antique shop and bought a 
shoe-box full of old post cards for $6," Steward recalled. "There were 1,200 
post cards with postmarks including one canceled at Piopolix, Ill., in 1897, 
that had been mailed to someone in Munich, Germany, and somehow ended up in 
Hamilton, Utah." 
</P>
<P>
J. Riley Groom, 77, of Compton, who was a conductor on the old Red Car in Los 
Angeles for 20 years and then a custodian for 18 years at Ralph Bunche Junior 
High School, has one of the largest postmark collections on the West Coast, 
numbering nearly 200,000. His earliest postmarks go back to 1853. 
</P>
<P>
The late Dr. Howard Thompson of New Hampshire had what is considered the finest 
private postmark collection in existence, numbering in excess of 1 million 
postmarks. That collection is now part of the PMCC archives. 
</P>
<P>
Members pay $9 a year dues -- $4 for 18 and younger -- which entitles them on 
entry to an assortment of postmarks plus a yearly subscription to the 24-page 
monthly PMCC bulletin. In existence since 1946, the club has annual 
conventions, the most recent held in Ridgecrest, Calif., last August. 
</P>
<P>
Some members collect postmarks from every state; some from every post office, 
and former post office in his or her state; some specialize collecting nearly 
every conceivable topic -- male and female names, romantic, humorous or odd 
names like Chicken, Alaska, and Tomato, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
The cover page on a recent copy of the PMCC bulletin featured reproductions of 
postmarks with country names and postal state abbreviations, for example, 
England, AR; America, MN; Russia, OH; China, TX; Germany, KY; Italy, TX; and 
Japan, NC. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulletin is filled with information about members, about coming club 
meetings, stories about histories of post offices and other features, 
description of duplicate postmarks to be auctioned from the club's collection 
and ads from members. 
</P>
<P>
Postmarks are generally auctioned in lots; for example, 400 postmarks from 
Texas. Prices are reasonable. The biggest auction of the year is at the PMCC 
convention for the benefit of maintaining the headquarters building. Last 
year's convention auction had 125 different lots that brought a total of 
$3,400. One of the highest prices ever paid for a single postmark was $80 from 
a 19th-Century post office by a member whose great-grandfather had been 
postmaster there.

SAN DIEGO FIRM MISSES 'WINDOW' FOR TOP-NOTCH MINI-SUPERCOMPUTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Scientific Computer Systems, a manufacturer of mini-supercomputers, has made 
the painful discovery that building a better mousetrap doesn't always attract a 
world of customers to your doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Scientific Computer discontinued its mini-supercomputer, 
the technical features of which had been lauded by industry observers. The 
announcement put an end to an effort that consumed 5 years and $50 million in 
venture capital and caused layoffs of 70 of the company's 100 employees. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen R. Campbell, vice president of marketing, maintained Monday that the 
company is still a going concern with a valuable asset: powerful networking 
software technology called VectorNet. Company officials insist that they intend 
to continue developing and marketing the software but concede that an infusion 
of new venture capital totaling "less than $5 million" is needed in the next 
several months if the effort is to stay alive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Market Window' 
</P>
<P>
Industry observers say the failure of Scientific Computers provides several 
object lessons, the most obvious being the high risk inherent in any 
high-technology venture. Others are the critical importance of introducing a 
product during the timely "market window," and how industry pundits can be dead 
wrong in projecting market demand for a given product. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the problems of Scientific Computer System illustrate how a company's 
fortunes -- and employees' jobs -- can hinge on events beyond the control of 
its executives, even those with an abundance of market and technical savvy. 
</P>
<P>
Scientific Computer was founded in 1983 by Bob Schuhmann, formerly an executive 
with Floating Point Systems, another pioneering supercomputer manufacturer, and 
proceeded to attract venture capital from 2 dozen of the brightest lights in 
the investment community including J. H. Whitney &amp; Co., TA Associates, 
Adler &amp; Co., and TVI. Local venture firms Henry &amp; Co. and CFB Ventures, 
a division of California First Bank, also chipped in. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the company brought out its SCS-40 mini-supercomputer on time and just 
as powerful as promised. Between a Cray supercomputer and a Digital Equipment 
or International Business Machines mainframe in processing power, the SCS-40 
could process data at 40 megaflops -- 40 million floating point operations or 
calculations -- per second. That's 10 times faster than a top-performing IBM 
mainframe and 1/20th the speed of a Cray. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Measure of Success 
</P>
<P>
Scientific Computer had some measure of success, selling 10 units its first 
year of sales and 40 all told, at an average price of $550,000. Like other 
computers in its class, the SCS-40 was marketed to research institutions and 
companies that needed to process vast amounts of data, such as calculations 
used in aerodynamic modeling and oil field exploration, but which either could 
not afford or didn't need Cray-level computing power. 
</P>
<P>
What distinguished Scientific Computer from its dozen or so competitors was 
that it billed its machine as "Cray-compatible" or designed to operate off the 
same "compiler" or operating software called COS that drove the giant Cray 
machines, said Christopher Willard, senior industry analyst with Dataquest, a 
market research firm in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
(Operating software translates instructions contained in applications 
programming into specific data-processing commands.) 
</P>
<P>
The company believed early that it could persuade Cray Research of Minneapolis 
to share its operating software. Cray would see the benefit because SCS-40 
customers would eventually move up to more powerful Cray machines, suffering 
minimal pain in adapting their expensive applications software in the process, 
the reasoning went. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Cray's agreeing to "play ball" with SCS was not needed because the 
Minneapolis-based company had released an early version of COS to the public 
domain, meaning that anyone could design a computer system around it. But, soon 
after the SCS-40 was introduced, Cray brought out an advanced version of COS 
that it kept proprietary. 
</P>
<P>
Scientific Computer was thus stuck with an outdated Cray compiler that 
applications software publishers were reluctant to support, a fact that reduced 
the appeal of the SCS-40. 
</P>
<P>
"Cray did not show any favoritism with SCS by cooperating or providing 
software," said Jeffry Canin, an independent technology analyst based in San 
Francisco who formerly worked at Hambrecht &amp; Quist investment bankers. 
"Cray did not perceive it to be in their interest to help start-up companies 
like SCS." 
</P>
<P>
SCS then retrenched by developing its own version of COS in cooperation with 
Boeing, a system based on another Cray operating software package also in the 
public domain called CTSS. At the same time, Boeing bought a number of SCS-40s 
and agreed to market the SCS machine. But the partnership fell short of 
generating the sales that SCS had hoped for, partly because the Cray-compatible 
marketplace was too small a niche and thus unattractive to software publishers. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how the company could, in effect, bet its future on the cooperation and 
good will of Cray, former Scientific Computer President Jack Hugus said Monday 
that Boeing and Scientific Computer were laboring under the impression that 
Cray "would indulge us the functional equivalents" of current Cray software. 
Hugus stressed that the Cray compatibility question was decided by Schuhmann of 
Floating Point Systems before he joined the company in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Hugus, who resigned from the company a year ago and is now marketing general 
manager for General Electric's government electronics systems division near 
Philadelphia, said the relationship with Cray was a "continually murky 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Scientific Computer's archrival -- Convex Computer Corp. of 
Richardson, Tex. -- had beaten it to the market by 18 months, introducing a 
mini-supercomputer based on UNIX operating software, a system also in the 
public domain but which is gaining increased popularity among workstation and 
mainframe computer users. 
</P>
<P>
Convex's decision to use UNIX was critical because it gave the company market 
access to a host of Digital Equipment mainframe owners using UNIX who would 
someday be ready to move up to a "mini-super," Convex marketing vice president 
Frank Vince said last week. Even Cray has recently introduced UNICOS, an 
operating system based on UNIX that may eventually replace its COS software. 
</P>
<P>
As critical months and Scientific Computer's problems with Cray continued, 
Hugus said, it became clear that the mini-supercomputer world was moving to 
UNIX-based operating software, Hugus said, not necessarily because UNIX was 
inherently a better language but because Convex hit the market window earlier 
and was able to establish itself over its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
For whatever reason, the SCS-40 was left hanging in the market with minimal 
software support, while Convex could market its machines as having the support 
of 200 or more application software programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, SCS has a better mousetrap in terms of its speed and technology. That 
wasn't the problem with the company," said Jack Dongarra, scientific director 
of the advanced computer research facility at Argonne National Laboratory in 
Argonne, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
"The failure was in concentrating on hardware and not devoting enough resources 
to software," he said. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Scientific Computer introduced a UNIX-based operating system of its 
own last year, it was too late for it to save the SCS-40 product. 
</P>
<P>
Several companies including Scientific Computer got into the mini-supercomputer 
business thinking that the market would grow much faster than it has. Projected 
by some analysts to reach $500 million in 1988 and $1 billion by 1990, just 
$330 million worth of mini-supercomputers were sold last year, said Dataquest's 
Willard, adding that the market could reach $1 billion in sales by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Severe price competition and a much smaller revenue pie to carve up has caused 
all but Convex, the mini-supercomputer leader with more than 100 machines 
installed, to be money-losers so far. Because of these factors, Willard expects 
the number of mini-supercomputer "players" to shrink from 15 in the mid-1980s 
to four or five over the next few years.

Moses Scurry, a Nevada Las Vegas basketball player, said he accepted $20 from 
his summer league coach to pay for lunch, unaware the man was a convicted 
gambler. 
</P>
<P>
Scurry denied receiving $100 from Sam Perry, as reported in the latest edition 
of Time magazine. The magazine reported that Scurry and David Butler received 
the money at a luncheon at Caesars Palace on Oct. 18, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine said Perry is also known as Richie (the Fixer) Perry. He was 
convicted in 1974 of sports bribery charges in connection with a major New York 
betting scandal at Roosevelt and Yonkers Raceways, both harness tracks, and 
pleaded guilty in 1984 in a sports bribery case involving Boston College.

A new survey for the Orange County Performing Arts Center recommends that board 
members consider building up to three new theaters, ranging from a drama 
theater for 650 or more to a concert hall with up to 2,500 seats. 
</P>
<P>
The study, prepared by Harrison Price Co. of Torrance and released this 
morning, found that the center's 3,000-seat Segerstrom Hall is operating at or 
near capacity. 
</P>
<P>
"The best way to relieve pressure on Segerstrom (Hall) is to construct a 
concert hall" at a cost of about $70 million, the study says, although "a 
lesser-quality concert hall . . . could be built for as low as $40-45 million." 
</P>
<P>
A drawback to the proposal, the study says, is that land next to the center is 
too small to accommodate such a hall, requiring construction at a different 
site.

BRITISH POLICE ADMIT LEAVING EXPLOSIVE ON JET

Police today acknowledged leaving a stick of explosive on a British Airways 
jumbo jet and letting it fly several times with the gelignite, left on board by 
a bomb-detection team during a dog-training drill. 
</P>
<P>
The incident sparked a new controversy over airline security. 
</P>
<P>
A cleaning worker found the gelignite, which officials said could flare up but 
not explode, aboard the Boeing 747 on Monday at London's Heathrow Airport, said 
Independent Television News, which broke the story Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The plane had just returned from a flight to Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Transport said today it has called for an urgent report. 
British Airways Chairman Lord King promised "a most thorough and detailed 
investigation," saying: "If heads fall, they fall." 
</P>
<P>
An airline spokesman, Derek Ross, said cleaners found the substance under a 
seat at the rear of the plane. ITN news said it was there about two weeks, 
during which the 747 made several journeys. 
</P>
<P>
Airport sources said it was believed that the package was placed in a seat 
pocket and then slipped through into the upholstery. 
</P>
<P>
Scotland Yard said police use British Airways planes for explosive search 
training from time to time.

The mother of a stabbing victim removed her son's life-support system at 12:01 
a.m. today over the objections of the assailant, who fears that he will be 
charged with murder. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Lane withdrew her son Mark Weaver's feeding tube at the earliest time 
that it was legal to do so and before leaving for her job on the early morning 
shift at a nursing home. A probate judge on Feb. 27 gave her permission 
beginning today. 
</P>
<P>
The feeding tube has kept her son alive nearly four years. Lane said doctors 
believe that Weaver, 26, will die in a week or two. 
</P>
<P>
Only then will prosecutors say whether they will file a murder charge against 
Noel Pagan, who served three years in prison for aggravated assault on Weaver. 
A judge this week refused to allow Pagan to intervene in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors said Weaver has no prospect of recovery from a "persistent vegetative 
state" caused by stab wounds to the neck that deprived his brain of oxygen.

Bordes left London after British tabloid newspapers made a series of 
allegations two weeks ago about her private life, including links to an unnamed 
Cabinet minister, two British national newspaper editors and a Libyan security 
official. The suggestion of a connection with Libya, with which Britain has no 
diplomatic ties, sparked an outcry about possible security breaches.

Former Rep. Bill Chappell (D-Fla.), who served in Congress for 20 years before 
he lost a reelection bid in the wake of allegations involving the Pentagon 
procurement scandal, died today in a Bethesda clinic where he had been 
undergoing treatment for bone cancer. He was 67. 
</P>
<P>
Chappell was defeated last November by political novice Craig James. Chappell 
lost by 732 votes but did not concede defeat for more than five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
A 20-year member of the House, Chappell was named in several documents related 
to the Pentagon kickback and bribery scandal but was not charged with any 
crime. He was criticized for allowing several major defense contractors to help 
him out of financial difficulties when they purchased or arranged for the sale 
of several failing business interests during the last five years.

6 TOP U.S. FIRMS OK JOINT VENTURES WITH SOVIET CONSORTIUM

<P>
Six giant U.S. companies today signed an agreement in the Kremlin on joint 
ventures that represent a breakthrough in commercial relations between the 
United States and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, signed between the American Trade Consortium and the 
Soviet Foreign Economic Consortium, the American companies could invest up to 
$10 billion in about 25 U.S.-Soviet joint ventures. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement establishes a legal and business framework that will provide the 
basis for members of the two groups to form individual joint ventures. 
</P>
<P>
It breaks new ground by allowing Chevron Corp., food and tobacco giant RJR 
Nabisco and four others to take out profits earned in the Soviet Union, said 
ATC President James Giffen. 
</P>
<P>
The inability to change profits earned in non-convertible rubles -- effectively 
valueless outside the Soviet Union -- into foreign currency has been a main 
obstacle to the development of Soviet ventures with Western partners. 
</P>
<P>
Giffen said at a news conference that room had been left for a seventh partner 
from the auto industry to replace Ford Motor Co., which last week dropped plans 
to make cars at a plant in the city of Gorky and left the consortium. 
</P>
<P>
Under the project, Ford would have first exported Scorpio-type vehicles from 
Ford of Europe plants to the Soviet Union and later built similar vehicles in 
the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Untapped . . . Market' 
</P>
<P>
"The signing of the agreement is a precedent-setting breakthrough in 
non-strategic commercial relations between the two countries," said Giffen, 
president of merchant bankers Mercator Corp., one of the partners. 
</P>
<P>
"The involvement of the American companies will permit them to enter and 
participate in a vast and virtually untapped national market." 
</P>
<P>
The other three U.S. members are Eastman Kodak Co., Johnson &amp; Johnson and 
Archer Daniels Midland. The Soviet consortium comprises 23 enterprises and 
several ministries. 
</P>
<P>
"We view it as the initial step of a long-term project," said American Trade 
Consortium Chairman Robert Carbonell. "We are not going to be able to supply 
the whole of Russia with Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers out of our initial 
joint venture." 
</P>
<P>
Trade between the United States and the Soviet Union totaled only $1.6 billion 
in 1987, the last year for which final figures are available.

Soviet journalists are hurt that they have been passed over for the first 
commercial trip to the space station Mir in favor of a Japanese reporter whose 
company can pay hard currency. 
</P>
<P>
Complaints surfaced in the Soviet press today after the announcement that Tokyo 
Broadcasting System signed a non-governmental deal with Glavkosmos, the Soviet 
civilian space agency, to send a reporter to Mir in 1991 as part of its 40th 
birthday celebration. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese television company plans to pay $11.3 million for the space 
flight, Komsomolskaya Pravda, the Communist Youth League newspaper, reported. 
</P>
<P>
"How could this happen in the country that produced Gagarin and Tereshkova?" 
columnist Yaroslav Golovanov wrote in the paper, referring to Yuri Gagarin and 
Valentina Tereshkova, the first man and woman in space. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't it clear that such a deal is degrading for our civic dignity? Don't our 
high-placed 'cosmic merchants' understand that?" Golovanov added. 
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the Soviet government to annul the "brazen contract." 
</P>
<P>
Pravda columnist A. Tarasov commented that it was easy to guess why, when 
Glavkosmos was deciding on its first paying passenger, "its eye passed 
indifferently over the Soviet press." 
</P>
<P>
"Alas, alas, we all get our pay in ordinary Soviet rubles and can't pay for the 
flight in the convertible currency which Glavkosmos needs so badly," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The flight is expected to last almost eight days. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo Broadcast System has begun a selection process among almost 40 of its 
reporters and plans to put two finalists through a two-year Soviet training 
course, deciding only at the last minute which one will actually make the trip, 
Komsomolskaya Pravda reported.

Virginia, home to major naval and Marine bases and several suburbs of the 
nation's capital, topped all states in per capita federal spending last year, 
the Census Bureau reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government spent $5,953.71 per resident in Virginia in 1988, moving 
it past Alaska to claim the top ranking. Alaska slipped to third, New Mexico 
was second and Maryland was fourth. Only those four states managed to receive 
federal spending of $5,000 or more per capita, largely a result of military 
bases or location near Washington. California ranked 16th.

The Japanese government today awarded an $81-million contract to Mitsubishi 
Heavy Industries to design the FSX fighter plane, going ahead despite a lack of 
agreement with Washington on the controversial plan. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Defense Agency said the signing took place just one day 
before the end of Japan's budget year, which allows it to spend money allocated 
for the project in this year's government budget. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Heavy, prime contractor for the project, won a contract that 
includes groundwork for a design based on the U.S.-built F-16 warplane, said 
the spokesman for the agency, the equivalent of the Pentagon.

Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Vinny Testaverde has filed for divorce from 
his wife of eight months and will seek a lump-sum alimony payment, according to 
court records. 
</P>
<P>
A document filed Wednesday in the clerk's office of the Hillsborough Circuit 
Court said the 1986 Heisman Trophy winner and his wife have been estranged 
since Jan. 26 when the marriage became "irretrievably broken." 
</P>
<P>
Testaverde met Laura Ann Gambucci in December, 1986, in Tempe, Ariz., when the 
University of Miami lost to Penn State in the Fiesta Bowl. He is entering the 
third season of a six-year, $8.2-million contract with the Bucs. 
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old quarterback requests a lump-sum alimony payment be a condition 
of the settlement. The court paper also stated that Testaverde and his wife 
have settled all claims against each other.

A French stunt man failed to set a 'round-the-Horn record today but slowly 
continued to work his way toward San Francisco in seeking to become the first 
solo sailor to make the 14,000-mile voyage from New York. 
</P>
<P>
Philippe Monnet, 30, was unable to reach the Golden Gate before 7:42 a.m., 
leaving intact the record of 80 days, 20 hours set Feb. 12 by Warren Luhrs and 
crew in the 60-foot Thursday's Child for sailing from New York to San Francisco 
around Cape Horn. The record had previously stood for more than a century. 
</P>
<P>
Backers who were in radio contact with Monnet estimated that his 60-foot boat 
would make San Francisco later today. 
</P>
<P>
Monnet set out from New York Jan. 8 at a record pace but suffered a series of 
mishaps this week. He was sailing with a jury-rigged forestay, which he 
refastened after it broke late Monday afternoon. To repair the wire line, he 
had to use a pulley and sling to hoist himself up the mast as it pitched back 
and forth. Monnet had no gloves to use, and suffered numerous cuts as he tried 
to re-rig his trimaran, his supporters said.

HEISMAN WINNER SANDERS WILL TURN PRO; 
</P>
<P>
JUNIOR AT OKLAHOMA STATE READY TO TEST NFL RESTRICTIONS

Heisman Trophy winner Barry Sanders will turn pro, testing the NFL's 
restrictions against drafting anyone not yet a senior, Oklahoma State Athletic 
Director Myron Roderick said today. 
</P>
<P>
"He is going to go pro," said Roderick, who added that the school had notified 
the NCAA and was in the process of declaring him ineligible to play next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a pro football source told the Associated Press that Sanders will be 
represented by David Ware, an Atlanta-based agent, to negotiate his contract. 
However, it was not clear whether he had formally signed with Ware. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Sanders nor his parents were available for comment. Ware was also 
unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders, a running back, will announce his decision at a news conference in 
Denver on Saturday run by All Pro Sports and Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
In January, the NCAA placed Oklahoma State on four years probation, barring the 
Cowboys from bowl games for the next three years and live television for the 
next two. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders is a true junior -- he has been at Oklahoma State for just three years 
-- and would be the first to attempt to enter the NFL through either the 
regular or supplemental draft. 
</P>
<P>
If he entered the regular draft, he might be picked as high as third -- the 
Detroit Lions, who pick in that spot, have indicated that they might choose 
him. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the NFL has permitted underclassmen to enter the draft rather than 
risk a lawsuit that might eliminate all restrictions. However, they spent four 
years in school, like Craig Heyward of Pitt, who had a year of eligibility 
remaining when he was taken by the New Orleans Saints in the first round last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is some question about whether Sanders would be granted 
eligibility. Some league officials have suggested that the league might take a 
stand in the Sanders case, hoping that it would be upheld by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sanders will be ineligible to play college football, even if he is 
barred from the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll notify the NCAA of that intention as far as ruling him ineligible for 
1989," Roderick said. "This is in the process of being done right now.
