<TEXT>
<P>
CSI Technologies of San Marcos had been selling its highly specialized voltage 
capacitors to the Iraqi government for years, mainly for use in radar and radio 
transmitters, until president Jerold Kowalsky sensed something fishy in late 
summer of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
That's when the Iraqis placed a new order that requested capacitors built along 
specifications that suspiciously fit only one product: a nuclear bomb 
detonator, probably for a missile. 
</P>
<P>
Kowalsky had every reason to know. CSI had been selling nuclear warhead 
detonators to the U.S defense industry since the company was formed in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
He also knew that the export of those devices is illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Kowalsky immediately notified U.S. Customs and the Central Intelligence Agency 
that a potentially illegal purchase of nuclear technology had been attempted. 
His calls set in motion an elaborate 18-month sting that ended Wednesday with 
the arrest of six alleged members of an Iraqi-sponsored smuggling ring as they 
purportedly tried to ship detonators to Iraq from a London airport. 
</P>
<P>
An ex-submarine officer and U.S. Naval Academy graduate, Kowalsky, 57, was 
persuaded by U.S. investigators "to play along with" the Iraqis and to assume a 
central part in the sting. 
</P>
<P>
Kowalsky was thoroughly coached in his cloak-and-dagger role by U.S. Customs 
agents. And, although he downplayed the intrigue involved in the sting, he said 
the experience was comparable to the time several decades ago when, as a Navy 
lieutenant, his submarine closely skirted the coast of the Soviet Union on a 
reconnaissance mission. 
</P>
<P>
Over the sting's 18 months, Kowalsky met with the Iraqis in London in February 
1989 and again last September. The second time, he was accompanied by Customs 
undercover agent Daniel Supnick who, wired for sound, posed as a CSI executive 
named Daniel Saunders. 
</P>
<P>
Kowalsky acknowledged to feeling like a character in a James Bond spy novel but 
said the meetings generally were businesslike. He never felt physically 
threatened because the London sites where they met were filled with British 
undercover intelligence agents. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't really bother me because the bulk (of his role in the sting) was 
what I did in everyday work, so I wasn't out of character," Kowalsky said. 
</P>
<P>
He said his motive for participating in the sting was less his fascination with 
intrigue than his strong opposition to nuclear proliferation, saying he would 
never permit his company to ship a nuclear weapon component to a foreign 
government or customer. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't read spy novels. . . . I've never been an actor," Kowalsky said. "With 
the Cold War winding down, I regard nuclear proliferation as a major threat to 
world peace, and that foreign countries building nuclear bombs is a major 
hazard." 
</P>
<P>
CSI makes a range of high-powered capacitors, devices that store and 
concentrate large amounts of electrical power. Only about 25% of CSI's business 
is selling weapon detonators to defense contractors. Its capacitors are also 
used in commercial products such as heart defibrillators and lasers. 
</P>
<P>
An indictment unsealed Thursday in federal court in San Diego describes, in 
lengthy detail, how CSI came to fill order number 1K/20/3, a contract for 85 
military electrical capacitors, 40 of which were for nuclear warheads. The 
entire deal ended up being for $10,490, the indictment said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, the negotiations and shipment of the capacitors 
involved a flurry of telexes, faxes and phone calls between Baghdad, London and 
San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Thursday in San Diego, Assistant U. S. Atty. Maria T. 
Arroyo-Tabin, who supervised the case, said all San Diego activity connected to 
the case occurred at CSI's San Marcos offices. There were no clandestine 
meetings between Supnick and any of the five indicted individual 
co-conspirators in San Diego, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Though bargaining began in September 1988, it wasn't until last Sept. 11 that 
the deal's specifications and price were agreed upon, after a meeting of 
officials from CSI, an Iraqi agency and the British go-between at the Cavendish 
Hotel in London, according to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Among those at that meeting were two agents of Al-Qaqaa State Establishment, 
described in the indictment as a division of the Iraqi Ministry of Industry and 
Military Industrialization. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why they needed nuclear warhead capacitors, the two agents initially said 
they were for "laser applications," the indictment said. Later, the two men 
said they were for "aerospace" use. 
</P>
<P>
Ali Ashour Daghir, an Iraqi, the managing director of the British middleman, 
Euromac (London) Ltd., also was at that meeting. According to the indictment, 
he told Supnick that his company sought no commission on the deal, not even "a 
single dollar for us." 
</P>
<P>
"I am an English company, but I am Iraqi. . . . If I profit my country, it is 
for me a profit," Daghir said. 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Supnick told Daghir that an American export license would be 
needed but probably would not be available for a shipment to Iraq. Jeanine 
Speckman, a French citizen living in England who was Euromac's export 
executive, suggested mislabeling the shipping carton so that it "wouldn't 
create any problems," according to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Speckman suggested to Supnick that the capacitors be mislabeled 
on the packing carton as "computer room air-conditioning units," according to 
the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
The contract was confirmed on Sept. 14. A week later, Euromac transferred 
$2,625, a down-payment, from an unnamed bank in England to CSI's account at a 
Bank of America branch in Escondido, the indictment said. 
</P>
<P>
Another $2,625 was wire-transferred last Dec. 19, the indictment said. On Jan. 
11, 1990, the balance, $5,240, followed. 
</P>
<P>
During last November and December, while CSI built the capacitors, a second 
order -- for high-speed switches called krytrons that are essential to the 
detonation of a nuclear bomb -- was discussed. That order never went through, 
Kenneth W. Ingleby, the special agent in charge of Customs' San Diego office, 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
During that period, there were a number of discussions about visits to Iraq by 
CSI personnel and tests of the capacitors, the indictment said. Because of 
logistic, neither the visits nor the tests were ever carried out, it said. 
</P>
<P>
Also during the same time frame, Daghir vacillated on the issue of where to 
ship the capacitors, the indictment said. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, he wanted them delivered to a "contact," never named, in the 
United States, the indictment said. In December, he acknowledged that exporting 
the capacitors from the U.S. to Iraq would be illegal but said that, because 
the order was "so small" it would not arouse concern, according to the court 
document. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 10 of this year, Daghir said that Al-Qaqaa contacts were not available 
in the U.S. and that, if the capacitors were to be shipped to England, they 
would have to be mislabeled as "air conditioning equipment," the indictment 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Daghir also said in a phone call that day to Supnick that the capacitors would 
be left in England for Al-Qaqaa agents, who would then decide "what is the best 
way" to move them to Iraq, the indictment said. 
</P>
<P>
On March 19, the capacitors were shipped out of San Diego, according to the 
indictment. They were labeled "electrical components for air conditioning 
equipment," it said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Customs generally regards high-powered voltage capacitors as a sensitive 
area of technology and often prohibits their export because of their potential 
use in a variety of weapons and communications systems, said president Monson 
Hayes of Maxwell Laboratories, a San Diego company that also makes capacitors. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes said that about 10% of Maxwell's export deals involving high-powered 
capacitors end up being disallowed by Customs. "We usually are surprised 
because we request only (deals) that we believe (involve the sale) of old 
state-of-the-art products that are readily available from other suppliers in 
Europe," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1969 by ex-Maxwell Laboratories employees, CSI has generated its 
share of headlines. In 1983, CSI employee Leslie Landersman, a 22-year-old 
newlywed, was abducted by a bank robber from the company's plant -- then 
located in Escondido -- and killed in a shoot-out by an Escondido policeman. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, CSI was fined $30,000 after pleading guilty to illegal importation and 
selling of capacitors containing PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, a toxic 
substance linked with cancer and birth defects. 
</P>
<P>
The company has 35 employees at its 25,000-square-foot plant on Rancheros 
Boulevard in San Marcos.

PROJECT TO UPGRADE CITY COMPUTER SYSTEM HALTED; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: AGENCY ORDERS REVIEW OF $1.3-MILLION CONTRACT AMID CONCERNS THAT 
CONSULTANT WILL BE UNABLE TO DELIVER MODIFIED SOFTWARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of San Diego's Data Processing Corp. has halted a $1.3-million 
computer project because, after investing more than $550,000 and 19 months in a 
consultant's work, city officials are worried that the consultant's product may 
prove useless. 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit computer agency decided March 16 not to authorize further work by 
Integral Systems Inc. while it determines if the Walnut Creek-based company can 
modify a long-awaited software program for the city auditor and its personnel 
department. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any of us are willing to continue down a suicide path here," 
said Rich Snapper, city personnel director. "We're not lemmings." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, lengthy, unexpected delays will force the city to spend 
$150,000 more to "patch" the existing, 22-year-old payroll system -- antiquated 
software that prevents the city from offering its workers deposit of paychecks 
to banks or pretax deductions for child-care expenses. The system is simply 
unable to handle such entries, said Ed Ryan, city auditor and comptroller. 
</P>
<P>
The system is so inadequate that tax forms for the handful of city officials 
who earn $100,000 or more have to be hand-written because the computer can 
display only five digits, Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief telephone interview, Wayne Macaulay, Integral Systems' vice 
president of professional services, denied that there have been problems and 
maintained that the city contract has not been put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
"The contract, as far as I'm concerned, has not been halted, and we're moving 
forward with it right now," Macaulay said. "I really don't know why we're going 
through this, and I have no further comment." 
</P>
<P>
But several city officials said this week that work has indeed been halted, 
pending the outcome of a 30-day review and negotiations with Integral to either 
modify the original system or install a system developed after the city signed 
a contract with Integral in August, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"We have put the project on hold," said Robert Metzger, executive vice 
president of Data Processing Corp. "We have stopped the expenditure of funds." 
</P>
<P>
Data Processing is also considering legal action against Integral and is 
determined to recoup its losses if the contract is eventually canceled, 
Assistant City Manager Jack McGrory said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Metzger defended Integral to some extent, saying that contracts 
for large, complex computer programs involve detailed give-and-take between the 
customer -- in this case Auditor Ryan and Personnel Director Snapper -- and the 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are different levels of expectations between what the contractor 
expected to deliver and what the city expected to receive," Metzger said. He 
noted that Integral's deadline to have the system running is not until late 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, were less charitable. 
</P>
<P>
Snapper, for example, estimated that, even in the best of circumstances, 
Integral could not deliver the system for 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in the middle of a project that is, by our estimation, taking far too 
long and is consuming much too much time and effort for what has been 
produced," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Integral has "the confidence that they can produce. I don't have that 
confidence that those modifications can be made and make it a working 
environment right now," Snapper added. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very disappointed about the performance of the contractor . . . because 
they didn't deliver what we thought we were getting," said Roger Talamantez, 
president of Data Processing's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
According to the minutes of the board's Jan. 25 meeting, Talamantez said, "The 
expense of the project under the present situation was absurd." 
</P>
<P>
Problems with Integral have caused additional delays for the payroll and 
personnel project, first conceived in 1984, according to a Jan. 19 Data 
Processing Corp. report. 
</P>
<P>
That year, a committee explored the purchase of software programs from private 
vendors and selected Integral's as the best product. However, city officials 
and Metzger decided not to buy the product. Instead, Data Processing Corp. 
developed a list of requirements for the system, which would handle payroll 
functions and track employees' careers, including training, exam processing, 
disciplinary actions and counseling, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
Data Processing also considered having its own staff produce the program but 
rejected that idea as too costly and time-consuming. 
</P>
<P>
But, because of "lack of progress" from May, 1986, to August, 1987, Integral 
was hired as a consultant for $100,000 "to review the project and recommend 
alternatives on how to proceed," the report states. Integral recommended that 
Data Processing purchase its system for about $250,000 and hire the company to 
modify and implement it. Data Processing Corp. contracted the company for $1.3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The project has been plagued, however, by three changes in the company's 
project manager and four changes in account managers since April, 1989, 
according to the report and Metzger. 
</P>
<P>
"Additionally, the project team was unable to make consistent progress in 
identification of requirements and specifications," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
In essence, the company has been unable to tailor a generic software package to 
the personnel and payroll demands of the city, officials explained. For 
example, it has been unable to devise a system to log the hours worked by the 
various classifications of its 8,000 employees, Snapper said. 
</P>
<P>
Data Processing Corp. now finds itself at a critical decision point, Metzger 
said, with three options: 
</P>
<P>
Scrapping the project, which would mean considerable extra expense and delays. 
</P>
<P>
Making the current system work. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiating the substitution of a replacement system. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a point in time when you come to a railroad crossing and you see the 
train coming," Metzger said, "and there comes a time when you have to say, 'I'm 
going to step on it,' or you're going to say, 'Let's stop.' "

BOWL-BOUND; 
</P>
<P>
AMPHITHEATER: ELIZABETH HARRIS MAY FACE HER ULTIMATE CHALLENGE. THE THEATRICAL 
COMPANY OWNER MIGHT USE THE NEGLECTED FOSTER PARK BOWL IF SHE RENOVATES IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
She's staged Broadway comedies and Shakespearean dramas and such offbeat shows 
as "Daytime for Dracula." 
</P>
<P>
Now community theater organizer Elizabeth Harris really has to produce. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura theatrical company owner has been given free and exclusive use of 
Ventura County's most unusual stage for the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
But there's a catch: In exchange, Harris must rescue the place from 62 years of 
ravage by nature -- and man. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County parks officials have turned over the keys to the Foster Park 
Bowl to Harris in return for a promise that she will renovate and upgrade the 
open-air amphitheater that is tucked into the side of a hill between Ojai and 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
That means constructing an electrical and plumbing system that will help make 
the 1,000-seat bowl attractive to visitors. And installing a fence and new 
security measures that will make it unattractive to vandals. 
</P>
<P>
The improvements could cost tens of thousands of dollars to Harris' nonprofit 
Ventura County Repertory Theatre, a volunteer group of 20 actors that sometimes 
has to rely on donations from its audiences to help pay for costumes and 
scenery. 
</P>
<P>
Harris' actors say that good crowds at this summer's still-unscheduled 
selection of plays will demonstrate the value of the bowl to potential donors. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought it would be a miracle if we pulled it off when we first started 
cleaning this place up," said actor Karl Thomas of Port Hueneme who also serves 
as technical director for the theater."It's a lot of fun to play up here. 
Sometimes dogs that are barking across the street interrupt the shows. 
Sometimes the dogs join us on the stage. But it's worth it." 
</P>
<P>
After two years of preliminary maintenance work at the bowl, Harris feels her 
troupe is ready to tackle the roles of historic preservationists. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, her theater company won the backing of a key arts support group 
that pledged to make the bowl its top fund-raising priority for this year. 
Meantime, her actors have decided to perform a series of free shows at the 
vine-shrouded stage this summer to draw attention to the place's potential. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets to last summer's bowl shows, the first season of the troupe's five-year 
lease, were priced at $6 and $7. But performances lured only about 100 
spectators each to the tree-shaded amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
"We were stunned," Harris said. "There were lots of people who didn't know 
about the bowl, even people who had lived here for years. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the difficult part. There's so much to do and we're not getting the 
crowds that could potentially be here. We just need people in Ventura to wake 
up and see what Mr. Foster did for their community." 
</P>
<P>
Pioneer Ventura County rancher and nurseryman Eugene P. Foster, who settled in 
the area in 1873, is credited with launching the county's public park system. 
</P>
<P>
In 1906, Foster purchased 30 acres of woodlands at the entrance to Casitas Pass 
to protect it from destruction by loggers. When he encouraged other property 
owners in the area to do the same, what became known as Foster Park grew to 205 
acres. 
</P>
<P>
The Foster Park Bowl was built there in 1928. Its construction was proposed by 
Ventura real estate agent Sadie Brown, who was supported by Ventura Chamber of 
Commerce leaders, churchmen and other business owners. 
</P>
<P>
The county Board of Supervisors allocated $13,000 to build the bowl after Brown 
and her group pledged that "organizations that often conduct open-air meetings 
and sponsor conventions and public gatherings needing open-air facilities" 
would use it. 
</P>
<P>
They petitioned supervisors to build a speakers' platform and bandstand. 
</P>
<P>
As eventually designed by Santa Paula architect Roy C. Wilson, the bowl 
resembled a World War I concrete bunker tucked into the hillside when viewed 
from Casitas Vista Road. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, however, "tall trees form a green canopy over the theater," stated 
newspaper editorials at the time. "This will give to this county a miniature 
Hollywood Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
Several groups, including student bands from Ventura's high school and junior 
college occasionally used the bowl after it opened. But old-timers say the 
place never really caught on like its backers had figured. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the bowl was ever used that much," said John H. "Jack" Morrison, 
an Ojai resident since his birth in 1917. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember there would be plays and concerts there. When I was in high school, 
we had an awards assembly there. But I don't think it was used enough. They'd 
envisioned a Hollywood Bowl, and it was never used as such. Maybe the 
Depression had something to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Pfeiler, who represents the area on the county Cultural Heritage Board, 
remembers Foster Park was a popular place in its early days. 
</P>
<P>
"As the years went by, we had other county parks and Foster Park was neglected 
. . . The county gave up on it. The bowl was successful for a number of years, 
then it fell in disrepair," Pfeiler said. 
</P>
<P>
According to documents on file at the Ventura County Historical Museum, there 
was a "short-lived" attempt by a local group in 1971 to renovate the bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The bowl was overgrown with brush and vines and littered with debris, including 
a pair of oak trees that had fallen across its concrete bench seats, when 
Harris stumbled across it about three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
She was looking for a permanent site for a "Shakespeare-in-the-Park" series 
that she had produced for eight years at various city parks around the county. 
</P>
<P>
"I was foraging around for another outdoor location because the city parks 
could no longer reserve consecutive dates," she said. "It was like an 
archeological dig. I felt like I'd found something that had been lost." 
</P>
<P>
The county was more than happy to let Harris use the bowl during the summer of 
1988 in exchange for cleaning it. Her acting troupe eventually hauled out 180 
large bags of trash. 
</P>
<P>
The five-year lease was approved last year when Harris agreed to make permanent 
improvements at the bowl in lieu of paying $100-per-event rent. The deal gives 
her authority to sublease the bowl to other groups or individuals who want to 
use it for such things as weddings. 
</P>
<P>
County officials, who say they lack the money to pay for the improvements 
themselves, are pleased with the arrangement. They say no timetable has been 
set for Harris' group to complete the bowl work. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd applied for a $200,000 grant from the State Historic Preservation office 
in Sacramento to use on renovating the bowl, but it was denied," said Katherine 
E. Garner, an administrative assistant at the county's Recreation Services 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra J. Sanders, who is also a parks administrator, said there is no 
timetable for Harris to meet. "One of the first things on the agenda would 
probably be putting alarms on the doors" and fencing, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although there have been break-ins at the bowl's basement storage area, 
vandalism is not as much a problem as "inappropriate activities, such as 
barbecues on the stage," Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
Responsibility for the initial money-raising for the bowl will fall to a group 
called Arts Partners, officials said. It is a group of Ventura-area business 
leaders who serve as the fund-raising arm of the county Arts Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"The bowl probably needs tens of thousands of dollars in work," said Gig 
Wishon, Arts Partners' president. "I think the project is a good one. I think 
the bowl is really worth saving. It's a natural, beautiful place." 
</P>
<P>
Wishon, who for 15 years has conducted a community affairs program for radio 
station KVEN, said it may take longer than the remaining four years of Harris' 
lease to renovate the bowl, however. 
</P>
<P>
She said she will be approaching companies, groups and organizations such as 
the Port Hueneme-based Naval Construction Battalion Center for help. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking for donations of things like one light pole or so many feet of 
fencing," she said. "But we'll certainly take donations of cash, too."

HOTEL OWNERS AGREE TO PAY U.S. $70,000 IN FINES; 
</P>
<P>
IMMIGRATION: INS PENALTY AGAINST TWO MISSION BAY INNS IS LARGEST AGAINST SAN 
DIEGO-AREA FIRMS FOR HIRING UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The owners of two large Mission Bay hotels, accused of hiring undocumented 
workers and committing numerous other violations of the 1986 immigration reform 
law, have agreed to pay $70,000 in federal fines -- the largest ever levied 
against a San Diego-area employer for such infractions. 
</P>
<P>
The fines stem from heavily publicized U.S. immigration raids last May against 
the two hotels, the Bahia and Catamaran Resort. 
</P>
<P>
William Evans, managing director of the two hotels, which have 640 rooms and 
about 600 employees, said the hotels have decided to pay the fines, which were 
proposed by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service on March 14. The 
hotels' attorneys have been negotiating with the INS for months. 
</P>
<P>
"We basically want to get on with our primary business, which is 
hotel-keeping," said Evans, who acknowledged a host of paper-work violations at 
the time the immigration inspectors arrived. 
</P>
<P>
In proposing the fines, the INS cited 362 separate counts, or violations, 
against hotel management, said Rudy Murillo, INS spokesman in San Diego. Hotel 
officials have 30 days to respond. Among the options are paying the fine or 
contesting the assessments and requesting a hearing before an administrative 
law judge. 
</P>
<P>
Evans conceded that some illegal immigrants may have been working at the 
hotels. He said the unauthorized workers had presented false documentation to 
hotel management. He was now confident, he added, that the hotel's immigration 
paper work is "pristine." 
</P>
<P>
Apart from paying the fine, Evans said that his mother, Anne L. Evans, one of 
two chiefs of protocol for the city of San Diego, had agreed to drop her 
related claim against INS officials. Evans, in a federal lawsuit filed last 
May, challenged the validity of the raids and sought a court injunction 
preventing similar actions. A long-delayed hearing was scheduled for next month 
in federal court in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
In court papers, hotel management charged that overzealous INS agents 
conducting the raids attempted to create a "panic" among hotel employees, many 
of whom are Latino. INS officials responded that the procedures used during the 
raid were legal and that a proper warrant had been secured. 
</P>
<P>
Of 30 people taken into custody during the raids, INS authorities determined 
that 29 were Mexican citizens living in the United States illegally, said 
Murillo, who added that the 29 were returned to Mexico. The other person 
apprehended was found to be in the United States legally and was released from 
custody, Murillo said. 
</P>
<P>
In the notice announcing the fine, U.S. officials charged that hotel management 
failed to maintain paper work as required by the Immigration Reform and Control 
Act of 1986. Among other provisions, that sweeping law forbids employers from 
knowingly hiring undocumented workers. The purpose is to cut off the job market 
for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
The statute set up an extensive set of documentation-keeping procedures that 
U.S. employers must follow. Employers must now fill out forms for each worker, 
attesting to workers' eligibility to be in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who continues to knowingly hire illegal aliens -- or employers who fail 
to comply with the paper-work requirements -- are subject to a range of civil 
and criminal penalties and fines, known as employer sanctions, that were also 
created by the 1986 law. 
</P>
<P>
The $70,000 proposed fine is by far the largest to date against an employer in 
San Diego for violations of the 1986 law.

BOY SUFFOCATED BEFORE HE WAS SET ON FIRE, CORONER RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County coroner ruled Thursday that an 8-year-old Northridge boy, 
whose burned, bound body was found near Simi Valley last Friday, suffocated 
while his mouth was gagged. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. F. Warren Lovell said that a bruise on Paul Bailly's neck indicated that he 
may have been strangled. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a classic strangulation," Lovell said. "It could have been, but I 
think it was something akin to . . . grabbing him around the neck." 
</P>
<P>
Lovell said that either strangulation or fear may have caused Paul to throw up 
at some point. Because of the gag sealing his mouth, Paul choked on his own 
vomit and died of asphyxia, the coroner said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he could tell whether Paul's death was intentionally caused, Lovell 
said, "I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Lovell said he ruled that Paul was dead when his body was set afire because 
there was no soot in the boy's nose or windpipe and no carbon monoxide in his 
blood. 
</P>
<P>
The coroner said that there was no evidence of sexual assault but added that 
investigators are conducting further tests. 
</P>
<P>
Paul disappeared last Friday morning after his mother dropped him off at a 
child-care program at Darby Avenue Elementary School in Northridge. 
Firefighters who were called to extinguish a brush fire in the Santa Susana 
Knolls area south of Simi Valley found his body that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Early Saturday morning, Ventura homicide investigators arrested Gregory Scott 
Smith, 21, who remains the sole suspect in the case. He is being held without 
bail by the Ventura County Sheriff's Department pending an arraignment hearing 
scheduled for Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Parent Teacher Student Assn. at Darby said this week that 
their records include notations of at least two incidents in which Smith was 
chastised for improper behavior with Paul. 
</P>
<P>
Smith worked permanently at two schools and as a fill-in aide in at least eight 
or more other schools, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our intention is to go over all evaluations of Greg, even where he had worked 
only an hour," said Cecelia Mansfield, president of the 31st District PTA. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Detective Sgt. Terry Hughes said Thursday that investigators believe 
a pair of handcuffs found near Paul's body belonged to Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators are trying to learn whether those were the same handcuffs Smith 
reportedly brought to a school Halloween party last fall at the Chatsworth Park 
Elementary School latchkey program, where he worked before he was fired on Dec. 
7. 
</P>
<P>
Staff members of the 31st District PTA child-care program said that Smith 
appeared at the party wearing camouflage fatigues and handcuffs, which he was 
asked to leave outside in his car. 
</P>
<P>
But Hughes declined to elaborate, saying only, "We consider it circumstantial 
evidence, and it has been incorporated into our investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Smith also had been fired March 6 for harshness in disciplining children he 
cared for in a PTA-run program for latchkey children at Darby.

NEW WATER RULES TO BE MAILED TO HOMES 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Notices explaining Ventura's water conservation ordinance and outlining the 
water allocations each household will receive will be sent out today and 
Saturday, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The mailing to the city's 23,000 customers was first scheduled for March 23 to 
kick off the city's public information campaign concerning water conservation 
measures approved earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
The delay was due to "glitches in the computer system that puts the mailers 
together," Ventura Public Information Officer Carol Green said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, which becomes effective April 12, residential users will be 
limited to 296 gallons a day, and multifamily residences to 196 gallons a day. 
Users may be given bonuses if they can document undue hardships resulting from 
the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The first bimonthly billing period will be a trial, with no penalties being 
assessed. But starting in mid-June, violators will be penalized with up to 10 
times the normal rate for excess use. SANTIAGO O'DONNELL

The big spring roundup is over, and the ranchers are driving their herds to 
market. Branding time must be a real bear: The three-day Great Snail Festival 
(they're always billed as the first annual -- hope springs eternal) begins 
today in the City of Industry, where snail ranchers from the San Joaquin Valley 
will give away samples of stuff they swear they actually sell: escargot jerky, 
escargot pizza, escargot turnovers, escargot caviar. The latter is fairly 
colorless and tasteless, it is said, so they add creme de menthe or raspberry 
flavoring and dollop it onto a cracker spread with cream cheese. 
</P>
<P>
Mmmm . . . make mine mollusk. 
</P>
<P>
The festival, also featuring free samples of, uh, real food from San Gabriel 
Valley restaurants, is the run-up to the Great Western Fair (which really is 
annual and begins next Wednesday at the City of Industry's equestrian center). 
The slogan is "Pest or pate? You decide!" and they honor snails on the hoof as 
well. The best-decorated snail wins $100, and snail bride and groom are the 
reported favorites here. 
</P>
<P>
Gastropod thin-clads will race up a 13-inch stick for a crack at the world's 
record of 2.31 minutes. The winner's owner gets $500 and the winner himself 
will, one hopes, not be eaten but be put out to stud. 
</P>
<P>
Now they know how those cold-fusion guys in Utah must feel. 
</P>
<P>
Eighth-grader Fernando Alamilla, one of 232 entrants in the Gidley Elementary 
Science Fair in El Monte, bought two small sharks and placed them in a tank to 
study them. Alas, he later found the creatures dead on the floor near the tank. 
They had leaped out. 
</P>
<P>
The young naturalist's conclusions: "That sharks are suicidal," said teacher 
Marilyn Coffin. 
</P>
<P>
Classmate Alyssa LaBrado won a prize for her study: "Which brand of gum has the 
most elasticity?" Alyssa, who gave the nod to Wrigley, wants to enter her 
project in a fair at the county Museum of Science and Industry. But she also 
has a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"The other kids stole all the sample gum mounted on her display," Coffin said. 
"As a matter of fact, I almost ate a piece myself while I was grading it." 
</P>
<P>
"Only" doesn't happen to tune in to this particular program, nor do they in all 
likelihood read "Only," but Hollywood apparently bested TV Thursday, when an 
actor about to be interviewed live in Los Angeles on "Good Morning America" was 
pulled away by his director and taken back to work. 
</P>
<P>
Reuben Blades, a singer-actor filming "Predator II," was talking via remote 
hookup to chatshow hostess Joan Lunden when the director, Stephen Hopkins, 
stepped in front of the camera, told Blades "We have a film to shoot," plucked 
out his earplug and led him off, leaving N.Y. with empty air. 
</P>
<P>
The rush, movie people said later, was to finish a night scene before the sun 
came up in Los Angeles. Something even Hollywood can't forestall.

In a survey of 46 major U.S. markets, L.A. ranked last in percentage of

Denver for first place in percentage of divorced or separated residents.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PASADENA DELAYS HIRING OF NEW CITY MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After two closed-door sessions, the Pasadena Board of Directors agreed Thursday 
to delay hiring a new city manager to allow more time to review each of the 
three candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor William E. Thomson Jr. said members of the board, which is equivalent to 
a city council, put off the decision so they can visit the cities where each of 
the applicants is currently working. 
</P>
<P>
"The board did not make a decision and will continue deliberations to permit 
additional careful and thorough consideration to each of the three candidates," 
Thomson said. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted to meet in two weeks to make a final decision on the 
candidates: Larry Moore of Richmond, Calif.; Jack Bond of Durham, N.C., and 
Philip Hawkey of Toledo, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
The new city manager will succeed City Manager Donald McIntire, who is retiring 
after 17 years.

LINK BETWEEN TANKER SPILL, TAR DOUBTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Coast Guard said Thursday that thousands of bad-smelling tar balls that 
washed up along the beach at Camp Pendleton and Oceanside probably didn't come 
from the Feb. 7 oil tanker spill off Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The oily globs were discovered earlier this week, and new deposits were found 
Thursday in La Jolla and on Coronado's Silver Strand, according to Lt. Pat 
Keane of the Coast Guard Marine Safety Office in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Although samples haven't been tested yet, Keane said the dark, hard substance 
found along beaches in San Diego County is different from the tan material that 
washed ashore in Orange County when 394,000 gallons of oil spilled from the 
American Trader. 
</P>
<P>
Keane doubted that the tar in San Diego County came from the tanker accident. 
"It's unlikely -- not impossible -- it came from the spill. It doesn't appear 
to be the same type of product," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, lifeguards noticed tar along 3 miles of Oceanside beach, and 
smaller deposits of tar were scattered on sections of Camp Pendleton's 17-mile 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
By Thursday, no more tar had arrived at the Marine Corps base, said Staff Sgt. 
John Midgette. It was the same in Oceanside, where city spokesman Larry Bauman 
said crews were operating two cleanup machines to collect the tar. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had episodes of tar before, but never of this magnitude," Bauman said. 
"Even though it's not a disaster, it was still considerably heavier than 
anybody here remembers." 
</P>
<P>
There have been no reports anywhere of injury to wildlife, and Bauman said, "We 
do not consider it a health hazard." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's sightings of beach tar, according to Keane, included one chunk at 
the beach near Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla and "little bits 
here and there" on the Silver Strand in Coronado.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CASITAS;

<P>
HANDLING OF WATER DISPUTE DEFENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THIA BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Preferring a gentleman's agreement over a lawsuit, Casitas Municipal Water 
District directors defended their approach to working out a water dispute with 
the city of Ventura this week against attacks from environmentalists and 
district taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
The Casitas board approved sending a letter to Ventura City Manager John Baker 
asking when the city is going to stop exporting water out of Casitas' service 
area. The letter alleged that the practice violated state laws and a 1976 
agreement between Casitas and the city. 
</P>
<P>
Casitas General Manager John Johnson said that the city may have exported 
between 600 and 4,000 acre-feet of water to residents on the eastern side of 
the city and that the quantity is expected to dramatically rise through the 
summer months. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than calling for an immediate halt to the practice, he said, the best 
way is to work with Ventura to help the city with its water crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The water district directors decided to ask Ventura to improve the accuracy of 
its data-reporting methods, report data monthly instead of yearly to the 
district, set a time schedule to stop exporting the water, pay it all back and 
pay an as yet unspecified "rental" fee on the total amount used outside the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
The letter suggests that negotiations take place before April 30 and that the 
Casitas board and Ventura City Council sign an agreement on the matter by July 
1, the end of the district's fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
A city spokesman said there would be no comment until the city receives the 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
Ojai environmentalist Pat Baggerly objected to the district's approach, saying, 
"It looks like the door is being left open . . . letting the city of Ventura 
steal the district's water." 
</P>
<P>
Ann Davis of Mira Monte agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"You're asking us to restrict our supply, and we resent it very much that 
people outside the district are using our water and not paying taxes," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Casitas Director Bill Austin told the critics that the letter is the best way 
to handle the situation in a gentlemanly manner. 
</P>
<P>
"If we go for something stricter, it would precipitate a lawsuit. We don't want 
this tied up for five years," Johnson said. "We're going to solve it quicker, 
easier and a heck of a lot cheaper this way." THIA BELL

There's magic going on at The Cosmic Cut. 
</P>
<P>
The hip downtown Inglewood hair salon is a place where teen-agers slink in, 
baseball hats covering overgrown heads; an hour later, chests sticking out, 
they leave sans hats with cuts so hot they sizzle. 
</P>
<P>
An afternoon in the shop, which draws customers from as far away as Orange 
County, shows you the cutting edge in black hairstyles. 
</P>
<P>
Its founder, Emmanuel Jones, sets the 13-year-old shop's far-out tone with his 
own bizarre style: EMMANUEL is etched ear-to-ear in huge block letters. 
</P>
<P>
This is a place where some cutters keep a notebook and paper -- to preview 
their creations -- next to the sterilized scissors. Here, haircutting has 
reached an art form known in industry parlance as "hair graphics." 
</P>
<P>
Clipper art uses the skull for a canvas. Picture a basketball player in mid-air 
jamming a ball in the hoop, a smiling Mickey Mouse, the Nike symbol, the Joker 
-- all shaved into the backs of heads. 
</P>
<P>
"I can do anything I can draw," said Tai Miller, one of the shop's popular 
clippers. "Roger Rabbit, Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Bambi, the Smurfs, any of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
None of them, however, would be allowed inside the doors of Inglewood High 
School, which is around the corner from the shop. 
</P>
<P>
In a clash of cultural vision, Principal Lawrence Freeman has banned the cuts, 
saying blacks do not need any more hurdles on the way to success. He even 
forced the current student body president to let his designs grow out before 
letting him run for the leadership post. 
</P>
<P>
But inside the Cosmic Cut, that view gets short shrift. Jones considers the 
cuts so popular that they will cross over to the the white culture. Someday 
you'll be able to get one at SuperCuts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Between trims, Jones, his wire-rimmed spectacles slung low on the nose, 
philosophizes out loud, talks up the black merchandise advertised on the walls, 
tells wild stories to the youngsters lined up for their chance in the chair and 
supervises occasional songfests from the shop's second-floor balcony. 
</P>
<P>
He has turned his shop into a hangout, a classroom, a marketplace, an amateur 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more than just a barbershop," said Cindy Cameron, one of Jones' staff. 
"It's an entertainment complex. You get more than a haircut. You get a show." 
</P>
<P>
Cosmic Cut outgrew its humble roots in a closet-like shop on Market Street 
about six months ago, moving down the block to a two-story salon where a dozen 
heads can be trimmed at a time. 
</P>
<P>
The closely cropped haircuts embellished with designs first became popular 
among young blacks on the East Coast and then spread to California in the 
mid-1980s, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Jones' 28-year-old son, Kevin, who also works at the shop, recalls cutting 
small lines in the mid-'80s and then occasional peace symbols and outlines of 
Africa. Now the designs fluctuate with the popular cultural icons of the day. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Jones said he etched thousands of bat symbols onto heads during the 
recent Batman craze. In one 40-minute session he copied an intricate T-shirt 
design of a grimacing Joker onto one teen-ager's skull. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, 50, said black hairstyles are a creature of the times, with Afros, short 
crops and processed curls going in and out of style. 
</P>
<P>
The graphic cut will be the cut of the '90s for the in crowd, Jones said. For 
those who can't decide on a particular graphic for their head, there are fade 
cuts in which the top of the head has long hair and the sides are shaved clean 
and different color styles in which patches of the head are dyed red, blond or 
some other color. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for sporting the graphic cuts are as varied as the designs 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"It separates you from everyone else," said Willis Turner, 19, a college 
student who was waiting for a Chicken-Hawk design one day last week. "Girls 
notice you." 
</P>
<P>
Turner of Placentia says he drives to Inglewood every couple of weeks for a new 
hair graphic because he doesn't trust his head to Orange County barbers. 
</P>
<P>
Upkeep is a constant concern with the graphic cuts, which cost anywhere from $8 
for a simple part to $20 and more for designer pictures that require more 
intricate clipper action. The cuts get fuzzy after a week and lose their 
picture completely in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Brandon Braff, 17, an amateur dancer who attends Crenshaw High School in Los 
Angeles, said a wild cut gives him an added lift. "You feel like a new man when 
you come out of that chair," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One high school track coach came into the shop one weekend because he had told 
his team members that he would get a graphic cut if the students won a big 
track meet. The white coach left the small shop with the school's initials 
shaved into the back of his otherwise conservative hairstyle. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman, who bans earrings on males and anything that can be construed as gang 
attire from Inglewood High, sums up the view of those who find the cuts 
laughable. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids have every constitutional right to make themselves look like a fool," he 
said. "But we are presenting our children as marketable items who have to be 
accepted for jobs and schools. When I send a student from Inglewood High 
School, I want someone I can be proud of." 
</P>
<P>
Jones, of course, disagrees. He sees in the wild haircuts an effort by young 
blacks to seek empowerment and build self-esteem in a society that tends to 
view blacks as a whole in a negative light. 
</P>
<P>
"Graphic cuts stir up a lot of excitement among those who see them," Jones 
said. "When the energy is focused on the person with the graphics, they feel it 
and it raises their self-esteem."

LAWSUIT BLAMES HOSPITALS FOR INDIGENT MAN'S DEATH 
</P>

In a case that highlights the crisis in medical care for the indigent, a 
4-year-old boy sued nine hospitals -- including four in San Diego County -- 
Thursday, contending that his father was illegally denied medical treatment 
when he was dying because he lacked private health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed on behalf of Patrick Jimenez in Imperial County Superior 
Court, alleges that the nine hospitals violated Juan Jimenez's civil rights 
when they refused to permit his transfer from Pioneers Memorial Hospital in 
Brawley several days after he was critically injured by a hit-and-run driver on 
May 30, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Jimenez, 43, a former boxer from Westminster, died of gangrene and widespread 
infection at Pioneers on June 18. Believing Jimenez needed more specialized 
care, administrators at Pioneers contacted nine better-equipped hospitals in 
San Diego, Los Angeles and Orange counties, but none reportedly would take him, 
even after his admission had been authorized by Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
Some hospitals said they could not accept him because they were full or lacked 
an attending physician to accept the transfer. Others said they were not in the 
Medi-Cal program or that they could not take patients from other counties. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators from the University of California and the state Department of 
Health Services determined that the nine hospitals did nothing wrong. The state 
health officials' report said that Jimenez was too ill to be moved. But Daniel 
H. Amos, the attorney who filed the suit, criticized those findings. 
</P>
<P>
"The results of those investigations were wrong," he said. "This civil suit 
will prove that what they did was not only reprehensible but against the law." 
</P>
<P>
Amos said the hospitals violated a section of the state Health and Safety Code 
that requires hospitals to provide life-saving services to patients regardless 
of their insurance status or ability to pay. 
</P>
<P>
Justin Clouser, general counsel for Santa Ana's Poverty Law Center, said the 
case exemplifies the growing problem of hospitals "dumping" indigent patients 
onto other facilities or refusing to accept them. Hospitals say they are being 
pinched by rising medical costs and Medi-Cal, which reimburses them only a 
small percentage of indigent patients' care. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick's mother, Maria Chinkin, lived with Jimenez for about two years but 
continued to help support their son until the father died, Amos said. 
</P>
<P>
Jimenez's widow, Leticia Jimenez, is also planning to sue the hospitals over 
her husband's death. Her lawyer, Leo J. Moriarty Jr., said he intends to file a 
similar suit in Orange County Superior Court next week, and another in U.S. 
District Court within a month. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals usually agree that they are obliged to accept emergency patients off 
the street, but say that they are under no such duty to accept transfer of 
patients from other facilities, Moriarty said. In his federal lawsuit, Moriarty 
hopes to establish that hospitals must treat any patient in a life-threatening 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
The nine hospitals named in the lawsuit are the medical centers at UC Irvine, 
UC San Diego and UCLA; Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center, 
Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, St. Joseph Hospital in Orange and three 
others in San Diego County: Mercy Hospital and Medical Center, Grossmont 
District Hospital and Donald N. Sharp Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Pioneers is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit, but Amos said he will not 
take action against the hospital unless he discovers that it did not do enough 
to facilitate Jimenez's transfer. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the hospitals or their lawyers refused to comment on the lawsuit. 
Officials at UCLA Medical Center and UC San Diego Medical Center said those 
institutions acted properly in refusing the transfer. 
</P>
<P>
Laura Avallone, a spokeswoman for Mercy Hospital, said that Mercy did not 
refuse to accept Jimenez. Mercy's trauma surgeon simply failed to follow 
through on the plans for the transfer, she said.

BOY SUFFOCATED BEFORE FIRE WAS SET, OFFICIAL SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
KIDNAPING: THE VENTURA COUNTY CORONER RULES THAT 8-YEAR-OLD PAUL BAILLY CHOKED 
TO DEATH WHILE HE WAS BOUND AND GAGGED.

<P>
Paul Bailly, the 8-year-old Northridge boy whose burned body was found Saturday 
in a field near Simi Valley, choked to death before being set on fire, the 
Ventura County coroner ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. F. Warren Lovell said the boy vomited at some point during his abduction 
March 23, but because he was gagged at the time, he choked on his own vomit and 
died of asphyxia. 
</P>
<P>
After Paul was dead, his body was set on fire, Lovell said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy's body was found about four hours after he was apparently abducted from 
the front of Darby Avenue Elementary School in Northridge, where his mother had 
dropped him off to attend a day-care program. 
</P>
<P>
The body was bound and gagged, investigators said. A set of handcuffs were 
found nearby. 
</P>
<P>
There was no evidence of sexual assault or other injury, Lovell said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said Gregory Scott Smith, 21, of Canoga Park is the sole suspect 
in the case, although he has not been charged. Smith, who had been fired March 
6 as a child-care aide at Darby, was arrested Saturday and is being held 
without bail in the Ventura County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
An arraignment hearing is scheduled for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Lovell said that pressure applied to Paul's neck, possibly from a strangulation 
attempt, may have caused the boy to throw up during the abduction ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
"It could have been" strangulation that cause him to vomit, Lovell said. "But I 
think it was something akin to . . . grabbing him around the neck." 
</P>
<P>
Fear also may have caused him to vomit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether it was possible that the boy's death was intentionally caused in 
such a manner, Lovell said, "I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said they are continuing to look into Smith's background as a 
$6-an-hour child-care aide employed by the 31st District Parent Teacher Student 
Assn. latchkey program. 
</P>
<P>
Included in their investigation is a report that he brought handcuffs to one 
school in October, said Sgt. Terry Hughes of the Ventura County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to being assigned to Darby, Smith previously was employed by at 
least nine other schools in the district. 
</P>
<P>
Staff members of the program said that, on Halloween, Smith came to the 
child-care center at Chatsworth Park Elementary School dressed in a camouflage 
outfit equipped with handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
Asupervisor told Smith that the handcuffs were inappropriate and ordered him to 
put them in his car. 
</P>
<P>
"We consider it circumstantial evidence, and it has been incorporated into our 
investigation," Hughes said of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes said investigators believe the handcuffs found near Paul's body belonged 
to Smith but would not elaborate on why. "We are still trying to determine if 
they are the ones he had taken to the school that day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators will review PTA records of any problems relating to Smith's 
treatment of children, Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
PTA officials said this week that their written records include notations of at 
least two incidents in which Smith was criticized by superiors for improper 
behavior with Paul. 
</P>
<P>
"We are aware of the documented activities between the victim and the suspect," 
Hughes said. "We are looking for anything else about his behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Administrators of the child-care program said they were gathering any notations 
about Smith from the supervisors' logs, at schools where he worked. 
</P>
<P>
"Our intention is to go over all evaluations of Greg, even where he had worked 
only an hour," said Cecelia Mansfield, president of the 31st District PTA.

SCHOOL BOARD SAYS 'NO' TO REEBOK PROMOTION; 
</P>
<P>
INGLEWOOD: FOR $30,000 IN RENOVATIONS TO THE MONROE JUNIOR HIGH BASKETBALL 
COURTS, THE COMPANY WANTED ITS NAME DISPLAYED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
As part of a nationwide promotional campaign, the company that makes Reebok 
shoes is overhauling the basketball courts at Monroe Junior High School in 
Inglewood -- the same ones where little Byron Scott had practiced his slam 
dunks and prepared for the day he would play for the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for the $30,000 renovation, Reebok International Ltd. wanted 
company logos to be displayed on the new court surface and backboards. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood school board members graciously accepted the donation this week but, 
for the first time in the company's two-year, 13-city promotion, someone said 
"no" to the logo request. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not in the business of advertising," said Thomasina Reed, one of three 
board members who voted to table the logo request and reconsider it later. 
"Reebok thinks that every time one of our students shoots a basket, they are 
going to see the Reebok logo and want to buy their sneakers." 
</P>
<P>
John Morgan, Reebok's director of marketing who conceived the promotion, said 
the logos are not what the program is all about. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to leave some mark behind," he said. "I don't think there's a 
problem with that. We don't want to over-commercialize it. I'm not expecting 
every kid in the neighborhood to go out and buy some of our sneakers." 
</P>
<P>
Reebok has already renovated Laker Coach Pat Riley's hometown court in 
Schenectady, N.Y., Sacramento King forward Wayman Tisdale's former court in 
Tulsa, Okla., and other courts in Boston, Atlanta and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
During the 3-2 vote, board Vice President Joseph Rouzan questioned whether it 
is proper to reject the logo after receiving a $30,000 gift. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you think the children really care that when they shoot, the ball hits that 
logo?" Rouzan asked at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that board members recently accepted about $60,000 from Burger 
King to start an academic enrichment program at Hillcrest High School. The 
program sets up a so-called Burger King Academy. A sign for what Rouzan called 
"hamburger high school" now sits in front of Hillcrest. 
</P>
<P>
But board member Lois Hill-Hale said there is a difference between a one-time 
$30,000 donation that brings continued advertising and the continuous academic 
program sponsored by Burger King. 
</P>
<P>
Reed joined Hill-Hale and Zyra McCloud in refusing to approve the Reebok logos. 
President Larry Aubry, who opposed the logos too, sought tougher action. He 
criticized the majority for tabling the logos instead of voting them down, 
saying the majority just did not want to interrupt Saturday's dedication. 
</P>
<P>
The day after the vote, workers preparing the new courts at Monroe had already 
installed much of the equipment -- logos and all -- in preparation for the 
dedication ceremony at 3:30 p.m. Reebok officials, Inglewood Mayor Edward 
Vincent, Scott and some of his Laker teammates will attend. 
</P>
<P>
District spokesman Maurice Wiley said workers may have to paint over the Reebok 
logos if the school board insists. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Inglewood, the shoe company plans to upgrade courts in Baltimore 
for Atlanta Hawk forward Dominique Wilkins, in Chicago for Atlanta Hawk guard 
Doc Rivers and in Compton for Boston Celtic guard Dennis Johnson. A special 
dedication is planned July 28 in Philadelphia for Hank Gathers, the Loyola 
Marymount star who died during a game March 4. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin M. Healey, an account executive for the New York City advertising agency 
that represents Reebok, said the logos are tastefully done and "don't scream 
Reebok." 
</P>
<P>
"It's subtle," he said. "The kids love the fact that it's Reebok that's doing 
it. They go around saying, 'Reebok gave us a court.' " 
</P>
<P>
Healey said the Reebok logo has never caused a real problem before. 
</P>
<P>
Reebok renovated courts at the Challengers Boys and Girls Club in South-Central 
Los Angeles last year. Director of operations Carl Reed said neighborhood 
children considered the new courts "the greatest thing that's happened since 
ice cream." 
</P>
<P>
The logo? 
</P>
<P>
"We really didn't mind because it shows our consideration for their work," he 
said. "It's like giving them a plaque." 
</P>
<P>
At the Inglewood school board meeting Wednesday night, Reed said there is a 
principle involved. "We have no obligation to allow a corporate logo," she 
said. "Is the mayor going to allow them to put a logo on City Hall?"

Ojai city officials hailed what they hope is a final victory in a seven-year 
legal struggle over a developer's right to build a large shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
An appeals court upheld Ventura County Superior Court Judge Jerome Berenson's 
1988 ruling on behalf of Ojai, following a trial in which more than 300 cities 
and counties filed briefs on Ojai's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Palmer of Anaheim, a partner in Ojai Investments, is reviewing his 
options to petition the state Supreme Court within 40 days to hear his case, 
said his attorney, John McConica of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer filed suit against Ojai in 1983 when he claimed the city took longer 
than a year to review his project application. He lost in 1984, won on appeal 
in 1986 and lost again two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Ojai City Atty. Monte Widders and City Councilman Jim Loebl said they are 
confident the city will win, if Palmer appeals. THIA BELL

USIU FAILS TO MEET PAYROLL AS IT STRUGGLES TO ARRANGE BAILOUT 
</P>

<P>
Unable to meet its payroll on schedule for the second time this year, United 
States International University has asked all of its employees for "patience 
and support" while it attempts to complete a $15-million refinancing package. 
</P>
<P>
Employees who expected their checks Monday will be paid "as soon as possible 
after April 1," according to a memo to employees. 
</P>
<P>
The financially troubled university expected to receive a $15-million loan Feb. 
28, but it was delayed after the university sold its 74% interest in KUSI-TV 
(Channel 51), acting university President Kenneth McLennan said. 
</P>
<P>
"The sale of the television station changed the university's financial status," 
McLennan said. "It required the revision of the financial data submitted to 
support the granting of the loan." 
</P>
<P>
The potential lenders have also asked the university to submit an environmental 
survey of the campus and further information about its accreditation with the 
Western Assn. of Schools and Colleges. The accreditation has been in doubt, 
partly because of the university's financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
The refinancing deal is being arranged through the Beverly Hills-based DS 
Financing Group. DS president Destan Seferaj didn't return phone calls 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In January, when the deal to sell its interest in the station to minority owner 
Michael McKinnon originally collapsed, the university was forced to ask about 
35 salaried employees to delay in picking up their paychecks. A few weeks 
later, the university received a $1-million advance from McKinnon for the sale 
of the television station, which helped it meet its payroll. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of the television station, which is still pending approval of the 
Federal Communications Commission, calls for McKinnon, who was the minority 
owner, to pay the university $9 million up front, lend it $7 million and 
forgive about $7 million in debt. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the agreement, McKinnon gave the university permission to use a 
small percentage of its shares in the television station as collateral to 
arrange short-term loans while awaiting approval of the sale from the Federal 
Communications Commission. But McLennan said the university has been unable use 
the shares to arrange a short-term loan. 
</P>
<P>
As of last week, no protests had been filed with the FCC against the sale, and 
it could be approved within the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
If the university is able to arrange the $15-million package, it will use the 
money to restructure about $12 million in secured debt and establish an 
endowment, McLennan said. In the past, the university, a nonprofit 
organization, has operated without reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, Bank of America filed notice threatening to foreclose if the 
university didn't repay its debt to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
"The university is not a business," McLennan said. "It's largely 
tuition-driven, and tuition comes in every three or four months. There's no 
steady income, which is one of the reasons we were anxious to sell the station 
and negotiate a loan."

PEDESTRIAN TUNNELS UNDER FREEWAY CLOSING TO CURB CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sepulveda residents living along the San Diego Freeway expressed relief 
Thursday that city crews will begin boarding up four pedestrian tunnels that 
the residents say provide "easy access, easy exit" to criminals and vandals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the best news I've had all week," said Mae Coleman, who lives two houses 
away from a pedestrian tunnel on Rayen Street. Coleman and many of her 
neighbors attribute neighborhood problems such as crime and vandalism to the 
dark, dank tunnel that cuts under the San Diego Freeway at the end of her 
street. 
</P>
<P>
After several years of community complaints, the Los Angeles Board of Public 
Works on Wednesday agreed to temporarily close tunnels at Chase, Rayen, Tupper 
and Superior streets with plywood. Work is scheduled to begin Tuesday. City 
officials said the much more expensive procedure of closing the tunnels 
permanently will be done later. 
</P>
<P>
Residents and police say the tunnels, built to provide a way to cross the busy 
freeway, are frequented by drug dealers, transients and thieves. Police said 
people occasionally are accosted in the tunnels, which often are covered with 
graffiti and reek of urine. 
</P>
<P>
The tunnels provide "easy access, easy exit" for criminals, Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
"We prefer them being blocked off," said police Sgt. J.W. Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
The four Sepulveda closures are the first in a new city program created in 
response to the increasing number of requests for tunnel closures. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 219 pedestrian tunnels in Los Angeles, 44 have been closed in the last 
30 years. Seven more, including two in the San Fernando Valley, are in various 
stages of being closed permanently. That process, which involves filling the 
tunnels with sand and bricking over the entrances, can cost $55,000, City 
Engineer Robert Horii said. 
</P>
<P>
Horii said the four tunnels in Sepulveda are scheduled to be closed permanently 
during the 1990-91 fiscal year, which begins July 1. In the meantime, the 
entrances to the tunnels will be blocked by plywood. Plywood barriers cost 
between $500 and $1,000, said Dave Reed, assistant director of the Los Angeles 
Bureau of Street Maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
"It won't stop them," Coleman said of the plywood's effectiveness against 
thieves and vandals. "But I'll take it for the moment."

OFFICIALS TOLD TO STAY SILENT ON WATER CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the aftermath of a report that the city of Ventura is considering using 
treated sewage water as one solution to the city's water crisis, Ventura's top 
water officials have been ordered to stop discussing the water problem in 
public. 
</P>
<P>
The ban was quietly imposed this week by City Manager John Baker, who said 
Thursday that he wanted to eliminate possible confusion as the city moves 
closer to water conservation measures. 
</P>
<P>
"The water problem is a very serious issue, so we can't have one person saying 
one thing and another saying something else," Baker said, adding that the city 
is referring all requests from newspapers to Carol Green, the city's public 
information officer. 
</P>
<P>
As assistant to the city manager, Green reports directly to Baker. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that we end up with contradicting stories, and, believe me, the 
council members read the newspapers and don't like it," Baker said. "That's why 
I've asked that all the information be centralized through Carol Green." 
</P>
<P>
Baker's policy -- which has resulted this week in a virtual news drought about 
the water drought -- was imposed after city Water Supt. John Mundy was quoted 
as saying the city is considering injecting reclaimed sewage water to recharge 
Ventura's underground water supply. 
</P>
<P>
He was the last city water official to make a public statement. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, interview requests to follow up on Mundy's provocative comments 
have invariably died on Green's desk. 
</P>
<P>
"The city is looking at ways of expanding its use of reclaimed water, but talks 
are at a very preliminary stage," Green said this week in reference to Mundy's 
comments. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if the city planned to use reclaimed water for drinking purposes 
instead of irrigation, as Mundy appeared to have suggested, Green did not 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're trying to do is to get together all the information. The meetings 
are ongoing. I'll get back to you when we have something available," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Public Works Director Shelley Jones and Mundy have been, in Green's 
words, either "unavailable" or "in meetings all day," every day this week. For 
months, both men had been among the city's most accessible public officials. On 
Thursday, hours before Baker announced his policy, Green, the new city water 
spokeswoman, was asked if such a policy did exist. She replied, "I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
City Council members said they were unaware of the new rules. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that such a policy exists," Mayor Richard Francis said before 
Baker confirmed the policy Thursday afternoon. "I haven't been told that they 
are not allowed to make comments." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Todd Collart also said he was not informed. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know that you are having trouble getting a hold of city officials," 
he said Thursday. "If in fact there is a policy of not letting top city 
officials talk to the press, I think it's wrong because we don't have anything 
to hide and this should be an open city."

SDSU GRADUATES TO HEAR HUMANITIES FUND'S CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lynne V. Cheney, chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, will 
address the nearly 7,000 graduates at San Diego State University in May. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU President Thomas B. Day said Cheney was invited to speak to the 91st 
graduating class because of her "contributions to journalism, literature and 
the humanities." 
</P>
<P>
Under Cheney's leadership the NEH/Reader's Digest Teacher-Scholar program was 
established in 1989. The program gives elementary and secondary school teachers 
who qualify $27,500 to study humanities for a year. Reader's Digest provides 
one-third of the funding. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney also oversaw the establishment of a $1.5-million research center at UCLA 
to study the way history is taught in the country. It will make recommendations 
for improving teaching methods. 
</P>
<P>
NEH is an independent federal agency created by Congress in 1965. It provides 
grants to scholars, colleges, museums, libraries and other cultural 
institutions to support research, education and public programs in the 
humanities. Cheney was appointed to NEH in 1986 and was recently reappointed by 
President George Bush. Her husband is Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope everyone will have an appreciation for what she has to say," said Rick 
Moore, an SDSU spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't just train people to go into marketing or to become scientists and 
engineers. They all take courses in the humanities, and, we hope, they learn 
how to appreciate the significance of what they are doing and how it fits in 
with the rest of society. That's what the humanities are all about."

MEDFLY SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He doesn't fool me. State Agriculture Director Henry J. Voss hasn't scheduled a 
May malathion phase-out, instead of the original June date, out of the goodness 
of his heart. 
</P>
<P>
The primary election is in June. He (and the Republican governor who appointed 
him) doesn't want the Republican Party to be known as the pro-poison party. 
</P>
<P>
They hope people are stupid enough, in the one-month interval, to forget they 
were malathioned against their will. They also hope people don't read between 
the lines. 
</P>
<P>
Although Voss talks discontinuance, he has approved spraying some communities 
every two weeks instead of every three. Also, he doesn't promise that the state 
won't spray in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Caveat emptor.

MEETING STATE'S WATER NEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Do the water resource people, the developers and the politicians know something 
about our future water supply that the general public doesn't know? 
</P>
<P>
At the same time that we hear about the possibility of a water shortage and the 
necessity for rationing, there is no talk of restrictions on the building of 
high-rises and housing developments that take millions of gallons of water 
every day. We have substitutes for many things but certainly none for water. 
Who is to say that our drought won't continue? 
</P>
<P>
I think we are owed an explanation for this inconsistency by those who should 
have control of the situation.

NEW LAW HELPS KEEP A LID ON SPENDING IN SANTA CLARITA COUNCIL RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Santa Clarita city cap on campaign contributions and a reluctance to accept 
money from developers have kept the race for City Council a mostly low-cost 
affair, according to financial disclosure statements released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The reports showed that some candidates have relied heavily on small donations 
of less than $100 while others have taken out large personal loans to finance 
campaigns in the first council election since Santa Clarita incorporated in 
1987. Ten candidates are running for three seats in the April 10 election. 
</P>
<P>
Two candidates, rancher Andy Martin and retired heating fitter Wayne Carter, 
said they had not raised any money for their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
A city ordinance that took effect March 15 banned individual political 
contributions exceeding $250. Even before the ordinance became law, most 
candidates declined to accept more than $250 or take money from developers in a 
city where overdevelopment is a common complaint among residents. 
</P>
<P>
When a proposed road tax was overwhelmingly defeated in the Santa Clarita 
Valley last fall, the measure's opponents credited its demise in part to the 
public's dislike of developers who backed the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Jo Anne Darcy and two other incumbents seeking reelection to four-year 
terms -- Councilmen Carl Boyer III and Dennis Koontz -- lead seven challengers 
in cash and in-kind donations, according to the financial statements submitted 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Darcy raised $18,783, about half of it in the form of $250 donations. Her 
largest contribution was $1,000 from Norm Gray, owner of a Lincoln-Mercury 
dealership, but that money was received before the campaign law went into 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
Koontz raised $8,042 and Boyer $6,966. Among Koontz's donations was $300 from 
three executives with Newhall Land and Farming Co., the area's largest 
developer. "I'm not embarrassed at all to take contributions from a responsible 
developer," Koontz said. 
</P>
<P>
Koontz noted that he had returned half of a $500 contribution even though he 
had received it before the campaign ordinance became effective. 
</P>
<P>
Jill Klajic, a community activist, raised $5,946, followed by Vera Johnson, a 
retired educator who reported $4,474. Johnson took out two loans totaling 
$2,600, campaign reports said. 
</P>
<P>
Herb Wolfe, a retired Air Force investigator, said he had raised $3,762, half 
of it in the form of a $1,900 loan. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Dean, an architectural designer, raised $425 in cash and spent $600 of 
his own money for a total of $1,025. Linda Calvert, a real estate agent, said 
she had raised $400. 
</P>
<P>
Most candidates spent their campaign funds on flyers, posters and postage.

GROWTH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Prof. James Moore's article ("Lock the Gates and the Castle Crumbles," 
California Commentary, Feb. 26), is a classic misapplication of cold economic 
theory to a human issue. He asserts that the unregulated marketplace ought to 
determine whether and how Los Angeles grows, rather than the democratic 
political process. 
</P>
<P>
That is the mistaken path that has produced smog, closed beaches, polluted 
water and diminishing open space. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, we ought to focus on the public health implications of development. 
Los Angeles suffers from the dirtiest air in the nation. Our beaches are too 
often the repository of sewage and sludge. Moore's marketplace theory ignores 
these ugly realities of overdeveloped Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Responsible slow-growth advocates do not want to hurt our strong economy. In 
fact, cleaning up the Los Angeles environment would improve property values and 
attract more tourists. 
</P>
<P>
I will have more confidence in our future if it is guided by the collective 
will of the public as expressed at the ballot box rather than by an invisible, 
unaccountable market dominated by an elite few. Public health must come before 
profits.

ART SUBSIDIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Theodore Bikel in "Cheap Way to Make Hay at Expense of Culture" (Op-Ed Page, 
March 15) seems to confuse freedom of expression with entitlement to subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
Many taxpayers do not object to the creation of art which they might find 
offensive, but resent the notion that they must have their sensibilities 
insulted at their expense. 
</P>
<P>
Some of us even dabble in art ourselves, but we lack the unmitigated gall to 
expect others to involuntarily pay for us so we don't have to get a job doing 
something constructive in society. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, to compare art subsidies against federal endowment to science is 
absurd. Science seeks physical truth, with that attainment driven by continued 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
Art is entirely subjective with no appeal to anything beyond superficial and 
highly personal tastes -- in fact most artists cringe at being universally 
appealing. 
</P>
<P>
Hence, I submit that American taxpayers are not obligated to support would-be 
taxi drivers from leaving their studios. If artists want funding, let them find 
patrons who appreciate their efforts and leave us unenlightened hoi polloi 
alone.

Regarding the formula for possible water rationing: One article suggested 
rationing might be based upon 75-80% of previous consumption. It seems that 
such a formula would only benefit overusers while penalizing responsible 
homeowners who have voluntarily reduced their consumption. 
</P>
<P>
The only fair plan would be to allot specific numbers of gallons of water per 
person per household.

NEW ERA FOR COLLEGE; 
</P>
<P>
WOMAN ELECTED STUDENT BODY LEADER AT CLAREMONT MCKENNA FOR 1ST TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELENA FARRINGTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christine Wight knows her college has a reputation for being a "macho school." 
</P>
<P>
But she's hoping that her election as Claremont McKenna College's first woman 
student body president will change all that. 
</P>
<P>
Wight, an economics major, won 54.2% of the 560 votes cast during elections 
last month at this small private college, formerly Claremont Men's College. 
Also elected Feb. 20 were three female class presidents: Ingrid Morris, 20, 
senior; Laura Lulejian , 20, junior, and Beth Curtis, 19, sophomore. The 
freshman class elects its officers in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes me really happy is that gender never came up in the election," said 
Wight, a 21-year-old junior. "I do think, though, that this will dispel some of 
the negative image that people have of the school. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this school has gotten a bad rap for being a macho school. But the 
years that I've been here, I've never felt it, and I don't think it's true." 
</P>
<P>
Claremont McKenna, one of the six Claremont Colleges, was founded in 1946; it 
did not admit women until 1976. Wight said the school's image is based 
primarily on its past practice of excluding women. 
</P>
<P>
"The climate was very different then," agreed Yvette Rodick, a 1986 graduate 
who is now director of internship and community relations for the college. She 
also is adviser for the school's Women's Forum, an informal group that meets 
twice a month to discuss issues of concern to women. "The environment is much 
more supportive now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Ormseth, 31, was part of the first class to attend Claremont McKenna 
after it opened its doors to women. She said she will never forget what it was 
like to be one of 60 women in the midst of 751 men. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember the first night I went to the dining hall for dinner," Ormseth 
recalled. "I sat down and looked around and I was the only woman in the hall 
surrounded by 300 men. . . . It was quite a feeling. 
</P>
<P>
"The school definitely had a masculine flavor to it," Ormseth said. "They were 
not used to having women around. For example, there were no bathtubs in the 
school (dormitories), only group showers, which most women are not used to." 
</P>
<P>
Ormseth, now vice president of Union Bank's San Jose Real Estate Loan Center, 
said it would have been "unlikely for a woman to be student body president at 
that time." 
</P>
<P>
"Society has changed a lot since I've graduated, and the fact the school has 
chosen its first female president is a reflection of that change," Ormseth 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The four newly elected presidents say they too are part of a changing era. "It 
has taken a long time before we reached this point, but progress takes time," 
Morris said. "It's finally here -- people are beginning to be judged as 
individuals, not as males or females."

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two teen-agers were shot late Wednesday, the third straight night young people 
have been hurt in suspected gang-related shootings, police reported. 
</P>
<P>
The latest incident occurred about 10 p.m. when Richard Mendez, 19, and an 
unidentified 15-year-old companion were wounded as they walked from a store in 
the 4600 block of Wightman Street in East San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The two youths were followed by a car. When the car stopped, the two teen-agers 
tried to run into an alley, said Lt. George Saldamando of the Police 
Department's gang unit. 
</P>
<P>
Saldamando said several people were in the car, and one of them fired a shotgun 
loaded with birdshot. 
</P>
<P>
Mendez was hit in the arm, and was treated at Hillside Hospital and released. 
The 15-year-old was hit in the chest and was taken to Mercy Hospital, where he 
was listed in serious but stable condition Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was the third successive night of violence, Saldamando said the 
incidents are not related. 
</P>
<P>
Those in the car, Saldamando said, may be members of an Asian-American gang. 
The shootings may be the result of an influx of Asian-Americans in what is a 
predominantly Latino community. Different gangs are now "beginning to run in 
the same area and are now bumping heads," Saldamando said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that police have a "good, solid lead" on the identity of the shooter.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: EL CAJON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A doctor who had been charged with plotting to kill his wife, also a doctor, 
was sentenced Thursday to perform 200 hours of community service after having 
plead guilty to a lesser charge. 
</P>
<P>
In December, Dr. Ashok Gidwani, 40, was accused of soliciting a former patient 
to kill his wife, Dr. Lata Gidwani, 39. 
</P>
<P>
Both are from India. His wife, a pathologist, appeared in court in December to 
show her support for her husband and told police she did not believe he 
intended to hurt her. In February, Gidwani pleaded guilty to the charge of 
solicitation to commit an assault. 
</P>
<P>
The orthopedic surgeon could have been sentenced to a maximum of three years in 
prison and a $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Instead Municipal Judge Frank Brown ordered Gidwani to perform the community 
service, to pay at $200 fine, and placed him on three years probation. 
</P>
<P>
The Gidwanis were wed in 1975 in a traditional Indian prearranged marriage.

TEMPLETON FEELS SECURE AT SHORT IN PADRES' PLANS; 
</P>
<P>
PADRES: HE'S TEACHING BIP ROBERTS HOW TO DO HIS JOB, BUT HAS NO INTENTION OF 
HANDING IT OVER TO HIM.

<P>
He sits in the corner of the clubhouse, slowly puffing on a cigarette, 
listening to his teammates telling him he's crazy. What he's doing, they say, 
is committing professional suicide. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll see," they tell him. "You'll see how much money you'll be costing 
yourself. And if you don't watch (out), you'll be losing your job by the 
All-Star break." 
</P>
<P>
Padre shortstop Garry Templeton just laughs, blowing smoke in their faces until 
they eventually walk away, shaking their heads in puzzlement. 
</P>
<P>
OK, so maybe it's not the wisest career move to be providing daily instruction 
to Bip Roberts on the art of playing shortstop, particularly considering the 
way Roberts is playing this spring. Maybe it's even more foolish considering 
that Templeton is 34 years old, has one bad knee, and has lost much of his 
speed. 
</P>
<P>
But maybe, just maybe, Templeton doesn't care about his own selfishness. If the 
Padres are going to benefit more by Roberts playing shortstop instead of 
himself, he said Thursday, so be it. 
</P>
<P>
"Not many guys would do what he's doing," Roberts said, "helping a guy play his 
own position. But that's Tempy. He's the best, absolutely the best. 
</P>
<P>
"You know I've heard the same thing, people talking about me taking his job. 
Hey, that's something I've never even looked at, taking his job. As long as 
he's here, he'll be the man. 
</P>
<P>
"And the way Tempy's looking right now, man, he may never leave." 
</P>
<P>
Templeton comes into this spring camp in what he says just might be the best 
shape of his career. He lifted weights. He rode his bicycle. He even watched 
what he ate. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, I don't know when the last time I ever felt this good," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He feels so good, he says, that he invites Roberts, Joey Cora and anyone else 
who carries a shortstop's glove to compete for the position. He'll take them 
all on. He has been a starting shortstop for the past 13 seasons, so why should 
that change now? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see anyone taking my job for at least a year," Templeton said, "maybe, 
not even then. I'm going to keep helping Bip out all I can, but I'm not going 
to just hand him my job. He'll get some time in there this year, which will 
help me out, but I'm still going to play my 130, 135 games. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to be one of those guys who has a big ego, thinking that if he 
has a big day, I'm in trouble. If Bip or Joey plays in more games this year at 
short, that'll just extend my career. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to help these guys become a success. I'm not going to be around 
forever, someone's going to have to fill my shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"But not now." 
</P>
<P>
There are those, of course, who do not share Templeton's views. He hears the 
whispers. He reads the newspapers. He listens to the talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
The same criticism keeps arising, refusing to go away. 
</P>
<P>
Templeton's lack of range. 
</P>
<P>
"I pick up the paper, and that's all I hear about, my bad knees," Templeton 
said. "Well, I've got one bad knee, and it feels fine. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear people say he doesn't get to the balls he used to. Come on, now, that 
was 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't realize what I'm trying to do. Sometimes, I'm just trying to take 
away an area. And when Larry Bowa was here, it got to be ridiculous. He had me 
out of position all the damn time. Finally, I just said to him, 'Will you let 
me play shortstop? You already had your time. Let me have mine.' 
</P>
<P>
"Things are a lot better now under (Padre Manager) Jack (McKeon), but still, I 
hear people say, 'You're not the same shortstop as Ozzie Smith. We never should 
have traded Ozzie away.' Well, look at the stats, will you? Will somebody 
please take a look at the stats?" 
</P>
<P>
OK, you want range? Only two National League shortstops got to more balls last 
season, Smith and Jose Uribe of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
You want consistency? Templeton made 20 errors for the fourth consecutive 
season, none in the final 24 games; was tied for second in the league with 232 
putouts; and was third with 409 assists. 
</P>
<P>
You want offense? Templeton batted .255 with six homers and 40 RBIs, his best 
offensive season since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
You want leadership? Templeton is the Padre captain for the fourth consecutive 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of crazy," Padre pitcher Ed Whitson said. "The guy's been around all 
these years, and he's probably the most underrated player in this clubhouse." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, whenever the Padres are mentioned as championship contenders the names 
that surface are Tony Gwynn, Jack Clark, Joe Carter, Bruce Hurst, Roberto 
Alomar, yeah, and even Bip Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
You bring up Templeton's name, and fans ask if he's still playing. 
</P>
<P>
"When you prove somebody wrong, you put a hush-mouth on them," Templeton said. 
"And that's what I intend to do." 
</P>
<P>
Templeton also has something else in mind. He's been in All-Star Games. He's 
been to a World Series. He's had a few years in which he batted higher than 
.300. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I've done just about everything I've wanted," Templeton said. "I made my 
money. I've had my good times. 
</P>
<P>
"But look at my hand, man. 
</P>
<P>
"It's bare. 
</P>
<P>
"I want a ring on it. 
</P>
<P>
The major concern involving Templeton is the same as it's been since his junior 
year in high school -- his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
Templeton had open surgery on the knee, which took out most of the cartilage 
and left the knee rubbing on bone. If it had occurred five years later, it 
would have been taken care of with arthroscopic surgery. But there was no such 
operation in existence in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
He has since had two operations, the last occurring in October, in which a 
piece of cartilage was removed just above his knee. It has allowed him more 
agility, he said, acknowledging that the pain never will completely go away. 
</P>
<P>
"The pain is there, and it will be there the rest of my life," he said. "But I 
still go out and play, because that's the way I was brought up, playing with 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, I'll get out of the game before I say, 'Damn, I can't even walk.' 
I'm sure every time I play on it, it's not helping matters. Maybe it's too late 
for me to get out of the game before I'm crippled. I do know I'll always have 
problems late in life just because of the operations. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's a choice I made, and one I'm happy with." 
</P>
<P>
It's become a time now, he said, where he'd just like to have everyone happy 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Padres made four errors, two by first baseman Jack Clark, leading to five 
unearned runs in a 13-8 loss to the Angels. They now have made 10 errors in 
four games. "I'm really not as concerned about my hitting as I am about first 
base," Clark said. "But we just got under way. You don't want to get too exotic 
out there." . . . Clark, playing in his first "A" game of the spring, hit a 
monstrous home run that cleared the center-field fence and landed atop a tool 
shed. "It felt good to finally play in one of these things," Clark said. " 'A' 
games are a lot different than 'B' games. There's no batting practice . . . 
They just throw a lot of bats and balls out there and say, 'Go play.' " So 
which game is Clark playing today against the Seattle Mariners? "The 'B' game," 
he said. "I guess once a B-gamer, always a B-gamer." . . . Padre starter Dennis 
Rasmussen was the lone Padre pitcher who didn't get shelled. He allowed two 
hits in the first inning, and then retired the next seven batters. The Padres' 
next three pitchers -- Ed Whitson, Dan Murphy and Ricky Bones -- yielded 11 
hits, 13 runs (eight earned), and nine walks in the final six innings. "We just 
couldn't get over the goal line," said Manager Jack McKeon, "all we could get 
was two field goals and a safety. But the most important guy was Raz 
(Rasmussen). We were looking closely at his control, and he didn't walk a 
soul." . . . Whitson attributed much of his poor outing -- two innings, seven 
hits and eight runs (three earned) -- to nerves. "I was just anxious, real 
eager, and that messed up my delivery," said Whitson, who threw 61 pitches. 
"You know it's funny. I've been in this game since '74, and I still get nervous 
in my first start of the spring. But show me a guy who comes to spring training 
and doesn't have butterflies, and I'll show you a failure. He'll never make 
it." . . . Pitcher Darrin Reichle became the first player optioned out of camp. 
More cuts are expected Friday. . . . Padre outfielder Thomas Howard went two 
for four, and scored two runs, but still is expected to be left off the 24-man 
roster in lieu of Jerald Clark.

GRADUATION WON'T TAKE BITE OUT OF THE LIONS; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: LOYOLA COACH PAUL WESTHEAD SEES AN 'UPBEAT TEAM WITH LOTS OF 
EXPERIENCE' NEXT SEASON, EVEN WITH SEVERAL OF ITS STARS GONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Now that the Hank and Bo Show has ended and Jeff Fryer has trained his sights 
on the pros, what's in store for the future of Loyola Marymount basketball? 
</P>
<P>
In the three seasons Hank Gathers, Bo Kimble and Fryer were casting away, the 
Lions averaged nearly 23 victories, went to the NCAA Tournament each year and 
led the nation in scoring each time. Gathers and Kimble produced back-to-back 
individual national scoring titles. Fryer led the nation in three-pointers and 
set an NCAA Tournament record in the same category. 
</P>
<P>
The culmination came at the end of this bittersweet season, after Gathers 
collapsed in a game and died March 4, when the Lions beat three highly ranked 
teams and advanced to the NCAA's final eight. They smashed all NCAA scoring 
records while averaging 122.4 points. 
</P>
<P>
With Gathers, the West Coast Conference's career scoring leader, gone, and 
Kimble and Fryer graduating, the Lions will miss their combined 87 points per 
game. 
</P>
<P>
As one opposing coach plainly put it: "They'll be back breathing the same air 
as the rest of us." 
</P>
<P>
But are dark days ahead for the Lions? Don't be so sure. 
</P>
<P>
While there are no players coming back of Gathers' or Kimble's caliber, the 
Lions may be better than people think next season. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be an upbeat team, with lots of experience, a substantial amount of 
carry-over," Westhead predicted. "We won't be devastated (by the loss of the 
seniors). There are some real bright lights. We may not be able to replace the 
87 points, but there are guys who will take as many shots." 
</P>
<P>
The core of experienced players is led by guards Tony Walker, Terrell Lowery 
and Tom Peabody. Walker, the point guard, and Peabody, the kamikaze swing man 
noted for his constant dives and hustle, will be seniors. Lowery, a mercurial 
driver who was the team's fourth-best scorer at 14.5 points per game and third 
most prolific three-point shooter behind Kimble and Fryer, will be a junior. He 
figures to play more as a shooting guard and increase his scoring. The three 
combined for nearly 16 assists a game. 
</P>
<P>
Up front, three young players will return: 6-foot-9 Chris Knight and 6-7 John 
O'Connell, both sophomores, and 6-8 freshman Chris Scott. Knight stepped into 
the starting lineup when Gathers went down before the NCAA Tournament, and 
Scott saw considerable playing time in the post-season. Knight tied Gathers for 
the team lead in blocked shots with 24. 
</P>
<P>
"So we have the two dimensions -- six or seven guys who are tournament-tested 
and the young guys who have shown up lately," Westhead said, "and it wouldn't 
be outlandish to think they could evolve into terrific players." 
</P>
<P>
Also in the wings might be the Lions' secret weapon -- 6-8 redshirt forward 
Brian McCloskey, an outstanding shooter who also runs the Lions' break well on 
the wing. Despite his slender build, he has also been a good rebounder in 
practices and scrimmages. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Coach Jay Hillock said McCloskey "is a very good offensive player. 
He's got cute moves; he can create a shot for himself. We'll be counting on him 
to contribute heavily." 
</P>
<P>
McCloskey, who transferred from UC Irvine after one season, is the nephew of 
former Loyola scoring star Jim McCloskey. He'll have sophomore eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest question mark for the Lions is the status of 6-7 forward Per 
Stumer, a Swedish native who has a year of eligibility left but may not want to 
spend another year away from home. At a well-conditioned 210 pounds, he has 
been one of Loyola's most solid rebounders the last two seasons, starting both 
years, and can shoot the three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
Stumer also has a commitment to the Swedish national team, which will be trying 
next year to qualify for the 1992 Olympics. He managed to play for the Swedish 
team several times over the winter without missing any Loyola games. 
</P>
<P>
Stumer sounded uncertain this week. "I definitely want to have that option (to 
return). I'm finishing my classes to stay eligible," he said. "I may play pro 
in Europe. That would be realistic for me. It's hard for me to say. I don't 
know if I want to spend a third year away from home." 
</P>
<P>
The Lions signed three players in the preseason, two guards and a swing man, 
and are recruiting a junior college player. 
</P>
<P>
The players who have already signed are 6-6 Ross Richardson, a three-sport 
player who had a "solid year" at Central High School in Flint, Mich., according 
to Hillock; point guard Greg Evans of Ocean View High, and shooting guard Greg 
Holt of West Valley College in Saratoga, Calif., who won most valuable player 
honors in two early-season tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble, potentially a high NBA draft choice, has already signed with an agent. 
He said he hopes to be able to play for one of the Los Angeles teams -- Lakers 
or Clippers -- but hopes to contribute immediately wherever he ends up. 
</P>
<P>
Fryer will compete in the three-point competition Sunday in Denver as part of 
the NCAA Final Four festivities, and will play in the rookie tryout camp in 
Portsmouth, Ohio, in April. He hopes to be invited to an NBA camp. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Lions hope to have made some recruiting inroads with their 
recent visibility. "The results of what we've done will show next November (in 
the early signing period)," Westhead said. 
</P>
<P>
Hillock said: "It's making us think about going after some of the top 100 
(prospects) next year" for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately," Westhead noted, "it's the players who decide your future."

COLLEGE NOTES / ALAN DROOZ: WESTHEAD WILL STAY -- UNLESS HE GETS OFFER HE CAN'T 
REFUSE 
</P>

The Paul Westhead job rumor mill has been working overtime since Westhead led 
the underdog Lions to the NCAA Tournament's Great Eight. In fact, going into 
the season, many observers around the country expected that with Hank Gathers, 
Bo Kimble and Jeff Fryer graduating, Westhead would follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
Miami, Colorado and Texas A &amp; M were among the schools that were supposedly 
serious Westhead suitors. 
</P>
<P>
But when Westhead finally addressed the issue this week, he was still firmly 
seated as Loyola coach -- and writing-class teacher -- and expects to be doing 
the same next season. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead and the Lions were so wrapped up in Gathers' death and the subsequent 
emotional ride through the tournament that he didn't have the time or desire to 
return job inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, he said: "Until this day, I have dismissed any notions of even 
partial contacts. There have been some phone messages; today I at least 
returned some. I have not set any meetings." 
</P>
<P>
He has always left the door open, but unless some major college bowls him over 
with an offer while he attends the Final Four, or an NBA team comes along with 
an offer too good to turn down, Westhead appears headed for his sixth season at 
Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never said to a team before, 'I'll be back.' I assume I will unless 
something comes up." 
</P>
<P>
Westhead said the perception in some places that he would use Loyola as a 
springboard to a bigger job has never been true. While he may leave someday, he 
said, "I never really looked to springboard." 
</P>
<P>
Players said Westhead has not told them he would be back. At least one, 
sophomore Chris Knight, has indicated that he doesn't want to return unless 
Westhead does. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope he comes back, but whatever he does, we wish him well," swing man Tom 
Peabody said. "I just want whatever's best for Coach." 
</P>
<P>
The craziness of the three weeks since Hank Gathers' death, the highs and lows 
and media shows, has subsided at Loyola Marymount (at least until the lawsuits 
are filed). Now that the games are over, the media firestorm has ended and the 
players are back to a normal schooltime routine, the time for reflection 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
As much as humanly possible, the team did it for Hank -- won three games in the 
NCAA Tournament, advanced to the Great Eight, knocked off defending national 
champion Michigan with a record-setting blitz, and made left-handed free throws 
as a mid-game reminder of Gathers' spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Coach Paul Westhead said it all hit him early this week when he drove 
along the northern base of the campus, where a big "LMU" sits on the hillside. 
It now reads "LMU 44," a reference to Gathers' uniform number. "It's the 
unexpected moments when it really hits you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something that's gonna hit everyone on this team now," Westhead said 
after Sunday's loss to Nevada-Las Vegas. "No more practice, no more games. The 
last three weeks it's been kind of a whirlwind for our team." 
</P>
<P>
Bo Kimble, Gathers' friend from their schoolboy days in Philadelphia, said the 
emotion suddenly hit him on the plane ride home from Oakland after Sunday's 
game. "I had my moments in the air; I had a difficult time gathering myself. 
But it was to myself, and nobody saw it," Kimble said. "I'm a lot stronger than 
I expected. All my life there'll be stages it's gonna hit me." 
</P>
<P>
This week Westhead said he hadn't yet fully considered the team's final days 
together. He and the players met briefly Tuesday and will hold their 
season-ending banquet next week, after Westhead returns from the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had time to think about the loss of Hank," he said. "I haven't had time 
to think about the loss of the rest." 
</P>
<P>
For most of the season, Westhead said, the Lions were a loose group who "did 
all the things of a normal basketball team" but nothing special. But after 
Gathers' death, the team took on emotional intensity and played with a courage 
and spirit that captured the nation's admiration. 
</P>
<P>
"The last three weeks they did things you wouldn't expect of a normal college 
player," he said. "They became a different team, and it will be harder to let 
go. It will be harder for me this time. These three weeks won't be repeated, 
and they can't be. It can't last; it's not something that's meant to last. 
These phenomena can't last that long; they flame out." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday the Lions were honored on campus with an impromptu parade. They cut 
down a net to commemorate the ceremony they never got to complete the weekend 
Gathers died. Kimble cut the last strand left-handed, then took over 
toastmaster duties in Gathers' absence. A large gathering of students responded 
enthusiastically. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead said: "They're better players and better persons; they can handle life 
situations with poise and dignity because of the last three weeks. They were 
forced to dig down in themselves, and they've grown." 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of Gathers' death and his teammates' courageous quest through the 
NCAA Tournament, the Lions became the focus of the kind of media coverage 
usually reserved for events of the scope of the World Series and the Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The morning after the Lions defeated Michigan, Loyola Sports Information 
Director Barry Zepel had 65 calls on his office answering machine. He wasn't 
able to return most of them because there were hordes of reporters and 
cameramen from around the nation on campus at all times. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead said that under normal circumstances, he would have shielded his team. 
But this time he felt the constant attention was helpful. "By and large it 
turned out to be a helpful friend," Westhead said. "With clusters of (media) 
people, even the hardest professional team begins to crack or get jittery. I 
think what happened was our fellows were so emotionally devastated, the media 
became a distraction, (a way) to funnel their sorrow. 
</P>
<P>
"It reached a point last week where normally I'd have thought it was hurting 
our team when you're gonna play two days later, but in this case I thought it 
was good for them. That's my guess." 
</P>
<P>
In a final season-ending gesture, Westhead called UNLV Coach Jerry Tarkanian 
and thanked him for the way his team carried itself Sunday. The Rebels, often 
known as college basketball's bad boys, shook Westhead's hand before the game 
and wished him luck, and played a gentlemanly game. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been maligned enough that they should be complimented when they show 
grace," Westhead said. 
</P>
<P>
"They, along with us, raised the level of the game. They were courteous and 
respectful. I haven't had a team come and shake my hand since the 1960s. It was 
for Hank. I accepted it as meaningful for their players. I sensed it would be a 
dignified game. I felt they were not going to spoil anything that had to do 
with Hank." 
</P>
<P>
Westhead also had a veiled prediction for this weekend's Final Four. "If (UNLV) 
can stay focused on the game, I don't see how anybody can beat them," he said. 
"That's how they were against us." 
</P>
<P>
Stat of the Week: Cal State Dominguez Hills sophomore Jennifer Boen leads the 
Lady Toros softball team in nearly every category, from pitching victories (8) 
to batting average (.412) to runs (15) to triples (2) to on-base percentage 
(.474). 
</P>
<P>
College Notes 
</P>
<P>
First baseman Darrell Conner has tied teammate Fred Camarena for the Dominguez 
Hills lead in batting at .381 and has a 14-game hitting streak. Unfortunately 
for the Toros, in the same game he extended his hitting streak, he injured his 
wrist in a rundown and may be lost for the season. His arm was immobilized in a 
cast last week, and doctors hoped to determine this week whether there is a 
fracture. . . . The Loyola men's volleyball team closes out its most successful 
season in years at home 7:30 p.m. Wednesday against Long Beach State. The 
Lions, rated ninth this week, defeated third-ranked Stanford on Wednesday in 
four games. They have won seven of their last 10 matches. . . . The Dominguez 
Hills softball team plays a home double-header at 1:30 Saturday against Cal 
State Hayward.

BRASWELL MOVES UP ONE NOTCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Long Beach assistant basketball Coach Bob Braswell spent Thursday 
morning on a jet traveling to Denver where he will attend the NCAA Final Four 
festivities. 
</P>
<P>
As if he needed a plane. 
</P>
<P>
One year after leaving the high school ranks, Braswell has moved a step closer 
to fulfilling his goal of becoming a Division I head coach. Braswell, who 
coached at Cleveland High from 1985-1989 and twice led the team to the City 
Section 4-A Division final, has been named the No. 1 assistant at Cal State 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty pumped up about it," Braswell said. 
</P>
<P>
Braswell, 28, who spent last season as the No. 2 assistant at Long Beach, was 
promoted when Coach Joe Harrington accepted a position at Colorado. Seth 
Greenberg, 33, Harrington's right-hand man and chief assistant the past three 
seasons, was named Thursday to replace Harrington. 
</P>
<P>
Braswell assumes Greenberg's duties as chief recruiter and scouting 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"It's exciting. I never would have expected to make the jump from Cleveland to 
where I am now this fast," Braswell said by telephone from Denver. "I've really 
learned a lot about basketball over the last year, on and off the court." 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg said he feels fortunate that he and Braswell will continue to work 
together. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm elated to have him staying with the program," Greenberg said. "Especially 
because he's such a great teacher." 
</P>
<P>
Harrington, 44, said he will recruit another staff at Colorado and that he 
accepted the position with the understanding that Greenberg and Braswell would 
be allowed to fill his shoes at Long Beach. Harrington said he did not consider 
bringing the pair with him. 
</P>
<P>
"Staying would be the best thing for (Braswell) professionally," said 
Harrington, who also is in Denver. "He needs to remain there and continue to 
develop as a college coach, because he can definitely become one."

MOORPARK, VENTURA PUT FINISHING TOUCHES ON FOES; 
</P>
<P>
PIRATES: A SEVEN-RUN NINTH INNING KNOCKS CANYONS OUT OF WSC LEAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Leads in the hit-happy world of junior college baseball are about as secure as 
paintings in Boston's Gardner Museum. 
</P>
<P>
However, the game Ventura stole from Canyons on Thursday afternoon was 
something less than a masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
This 3 1/2-hour gem included 11 errors, 11 walks, 11 pitchers, three wild 
pitches and two hit batters. 
</P>
<P>
Visiting Ventura finally determined the outcome by scoring seven runs in the 
top of the ninth to overcome a three-run deficit and win, 15-11, knocking 
Canyons out of first place in the Western State Conference. 
</P>
<P>
"It definitely wasn't pretty, but I was proud of the team," Ventura Coach Gary 
Anglin said. "This is one of my biggest wins in my 13 years here. To keep 
battling and beat Canyons at home . . . they don't lose here too often." 
</P>
<P>
In the decisive ninth, the first eight batters reached base for Ventura (14-9, 
6-6), which pounded out six hits in the rally. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons reliever Jason Farrell (1-3) entered the game with no earned runs 
allowed in 9 2/3 innings of WSC play but failed to get an out in the ninth and 
was charged with six runs and the loss. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons (17-8, 9-3), tied with Cuesta for second place in the WSC, loaded the 
bases in the bottom of the ninth, but Ventura's Rick Pearn induced the only 
batter he faced to hit into a game-ending double play. Bryan Leiser (4-0) 
picked up the first out of the ninth on a strikeout and earned the win. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons ace Mike Teich had been scheduled to start but could not because of 
soreness in his arm. Lance Gibson replaced Teich and surrendered six runs in 
the first two innings, including a three-run home run by Tom Lunsford in the 
first and a two-run homer by Gabe Diaz in the second. Gibson eventually settled 
down, allowing only one run through the next four innings. 
</P>
<P>
J. R. Trujillo hit a two-run home run for Canyons in the the first, and the 
Cougars pulled into a 7-7 tie after six innings. Canyons scored four more in 
the seventh, on a solo home run by Steve Kovacic and Ron Robart's three-run 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
Leadoff hitter Robart also doubled and singled and had five runs batted in. 
Bill Horvat scored four runs. 
</P>
<P>
"We hit pretty well," Canyons Coach Len Mohney said. "We just let one get away 
in the ninth." 
</P>
<P>
Al Sanderson scored four runs for Ventura.

HALIBUT DERBY HOOKS 1,132 ANGLERS, 300 FISH

<P>
The Marina del Rey Halibut Derby was declared a success with more than 300 
brought to the scales. 
</P>
<P>
The 16th annual derby attracted 1,132 anglers. Sponsored by the Marina del Rey 
Anglers, the event allowed catches from either private or chartered boats. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 17 fish tagged by the Department of Fish and Game were hooked. The 
department paid $5 for each tagged catch. 
</P>
<P>
Top winner was Robert Loll of La Habra, who landed a 29-pound, 4-ounce 
specimen. He received a trip for two to fish the Great Barrier Reef in 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Second place went to Steve John of Westminster who hooked a 25-pound, 3-ounce 
halibut. He won a fishing trip to Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Rozsa of West Los Angeles finished third and was awarded fishing tackle 
for his catch of 24 pounds, 3 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
The derby banquet will be held April 5 at 7:30 p.m. at the Doubletree Marina 
Beach Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Gear up for shallow rock cod fishing at San Nicolas Island. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth annual "Fishing For the Homeless" charity event is set for April 7 
aboard Capt. Russ Izor's boat, First String. According to organizer Tony Salas, 
last year's trip paid for more than 8,000 meals at the Los Angeles Rescue 
Mission. The cost for the event, which includes more than $1,000 in prizes and 
drawings, is $75 per angler. Call Salas at (818) 244-5348. 
</P>
<P>
Three Avalon siblings dropped their lines at Little Harbor while aboard their 
boat, May Time, and found plenty of action. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan Kerr got a bite from a 40-pound sand shark just as his sister, Justine, 
hooked a 14-pound halibut. Meanwhile, brother Phil tossed a line baited with 
squid overboard and got an immediate tug from a 16-pound white sea bass. All 
three catches were landed. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Hardcastle of San Pedro, fishing from a skiff outside the kelp beds near 
Pt. Fermin, caught a 10-pound halibut, then moved out to deeper water, tossing 
baited jigs in search of small calico bass. The fish refused to bite, so he 
removed the jig and inserted a hook with live squid. He reeled in a white sea 
bass that weighed just under 12 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: Tom Honaker of Long Beach, fishing aboard the City of Seal 
Beach at the Oil Rigs, caught the whopper of the week, a 36-pound lingcod. 
</P>
<P>
The cows were out of the barn again last week. Sandy Bross of Redondo Beach, 
fishing aboard the Blackjack at the Cherry Bank, won the jackpot with a 
25-pound cow cod. 
</P>
<P>
John Nance of West Los Angeles, fishing aboard the Toronado, caught a 19-pound 
cow cod at San Nicolas Island. 
</P>
<P>
And James Tani of San Pedro, fishing aboard the Southern Cal at Catalina 
Island, won the jackpot with a 19-pound cow.

RED-HOT HARBOR SQUAD BURNING UP OPPONENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Success is nothing new to Harbor College baseball Coach Jim O'Brien, but the 
depth and talent on this year's team may be unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien said at the start of the season that this may be his best team in 15 
years at the school. In that span, the Seahawks have won 10 conference 
championships and two state titles (1978 and 1984). 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very similar type of team (to the 1984 team), defensively and 
offensively," O'Brien said. "We have lots of versatility and play really well 
together." 
</P>
<P>
As usual, Harbor is headed to the state tournament, which will be held at UC 
Irvine in May. The Seahawks are ranked No. 1 in Southern California with a 31-3 
record that includes a 20-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the red-hot Seahawks beat state champion Cerritos, 3-1, in the 
championship game of the Casey Stengel Tournament. The loss snapped a 15-game 
winning streak for the Falcons, who are 20-3. 
</P>
<P>
And, as usual, the Seahawks are cruising through the six-member Southern 
California Athletic Conference with a 10-0 record. 
</P>
<P>
"The talent on this team is just amazing," said sophomore relief pitcher John 
Ingram. "I've never seen anything like it." 
</P>
<P>
Harbor is solid all around. O'Brien's preseason forecast said pitching would be 
his team's strength, and it is. The Seahawks' strong hitting, however, can't be 
overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
Nine players are batting at least .340. Freshman Rodney Garcia, an all-city 
selection at San Pedro High, leads the pack with a .448 average. Freshmen 
Carlos Dominguez and Robert Lewis (Rolling Hills) and sophomore shortstop Tony 
Liebsack are close to .400. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Jeff Hunter leads the Seahawks on the mound. The 6-foot-3, 185-pound 
right-hander from South Torrance High has a 7-0 record. Sophomore Pat Ahearne 
(St. Bernard High), who went 11-5 last season, has also been impressive this 
year with a 7-1 mark. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Sky Lasowitz, a part-time starter/reliever, has a 4-0 record, and 
Banning freshman Chico Limas is 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien says there's no limit to what this team can do. "Right now we're going 
on all cylinders," he said. "We're doing everything well, and we have a lot of 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino College is struggling under interim baseball Coach Glen LeVier, but 
there's plenty of time for improvement, and the Warriors are capitalizing. El 
Camino is riding a two-game winning streak after defeating a pair of South 
Coast Conference foes. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors beat cross-town rival Long Beach, 7-4, on Saturday and Pasadena, 
11-6, on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's win snapped a four-game losing streak for the Warriors, who are 3-6 
in the five-member SCC and 10-11 overall. 
</P>
<P>
The victory over Long Beach was extra sweet for LeVier, a former assistant 
coach there who didn't leave the school on good terms at the end of last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino's golf team is doing well, considering that two of its top players 
are no longer with the team. One dropped out of school for personal reasons, 
and the other transferred to USC. 
</P>
<P>
But that hasn't stopped El Camino from succeeding in the five-member South 
Coast Conference, which includes powerhouse Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Al Greenleaf says his team has a good chance of qualifying for the 
regional tournament in San Diego on May 7. The Warriors have a couple of 
early-season tournament victories and have placed well in all their events. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, El Camino placed second to Long Beach in a four-team tournament 
that also included conference rivals Cerritos and Mt. San Antonio College. 
</P>
<P>
"We're much improved from last year," said Greenleaf, who took over the program 
last season after a five-year hiatus. "We'll probably finish second or third in 
our conference. We definitely won't finish lower than third." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino's top three golfers -- Archie Uenishi, Scott Johnston and Holden Kim 
-- are shooting in the mid-70s. No. 4 Ruben Padilla and No. 5 Steve Jund 
average in the upper 70s, though they had never competed before this season.

LOYOLA WILL TRY TO BREAK LOGJAM AT TOP

<TEXT>
<P>
Loyola Marymount will try to break away from a scramble atop the West Coast 
Conference baseball standings when Nevada Reno comes to town for three games 
starting today. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions, leading by a half-game over Pepperdine and 1 1/2 over Santa Clara, 
face Reno at 2 p.m. today, then play an 11 a.m. double-header Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
All games will be in Loyola's Page Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions, 21-9 overall, are 10-4 in WCC play. Reno (11-12 and 3-6) is in fifth 
place. The teams had a three-game series wiped out by snow in Reno in late 
February. 
</P>
<P>
With a successful weekend, the Lions may be able to build a cushion in the 
conference. Pepperdine and Santa Clara will be playing a three-game series at 
Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola tops the conference in hitting with a team average of .334. The Lions 
also have the top fielding percentage. The Wolf Pack is last in the WCC in 
pitching with an earned-run average of 6.13. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola outfielder Rick Mediavilla leads the WCC in batting at .402, while Tony 
Kounas is battling for the lead in runs batted in (37) and home runs (8). Tim 
Williams is also in the RBI race with 35. 
</P>
<P>
Reno has one of the conference's top pitchers in Rod Nettnin (3-1). ALAN DROOZ

HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP;

MT. CARMEL GIRLS SUPER AGAINST POWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Forgive Mt. Carmel High School's girls' track team members if they walk around 
with an "S" emblazoned on their chests today. But the coach, Dennis McClanahan, 
said before the most highly anticipated dual meet of the year, against rival 
Poway, that it would take a "super human effort" by his team to win. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, the Sundevils let Clark Kent out of the telephone booth. Mt. Carmel 
defeated visiting Poway, 71-56, in a meet between two schools that many 
consider the best in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Poway won the boys' meet, 80-56. 
</P>
<P>
"It did take a super human effort to accomplish what we did," said McClanahan, 
whose girls are undefeated in five meets. 
</P>
<P>
Consider what McClanahan's girls accomplished: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sophomore Melanie Williams, who high jumped 5-feet-2, defeated the 
defending section champion, Christy Kurras (5-0). Kurras has gone as high as 
5-4. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sophomore Scia Maumausolo (37-7 1/2) defeated Cindy Beers (36-9) in the 
shot put, though Beers had been the county leader in the event at 37-1. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Charity Stowell (2:23.1), competing in her first 800 meters of the year, 
held off freshman Monica Callan by four-tenths of a second. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sophomore Allison Dring had two county-best times, in the 200 (25.9) and 
400 (58.1), and took second in the 100 (12.7). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Susan Scott overcame a big deficit over the final 125 meters of the 400 and 
nipped Poway's Jessica Brey at the finish, by four-hundredths of a second, to 
finish third (63.4). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cara Shiga finished third (12:15.1) in the 3,200, ahead of Poway's Tara 
Barnhart, whom she had never beaten. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Sundevils' 1,600-meter relay team of Scott, Williams, Vicki de Jesus, 
and Dring (4:09.6) beat Poway's foursome, which had previously run a 4:04.3. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not going to find a better dual meet," said Poway Coach Dan Schaitel.

Literary Find: Two works by Ernest Hemingway found among handwritten 
manuscripts at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston will be published for the 
first time next month. The two short stories will appear in the spring issue of 
the Hemingway Review. 
</P>
<P>
The finds were made by Susan Beegel, an independent scholar, and Donald 
Junkins, a professor at the University of Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
Honors: Tennis star Billie Jean King and Texas politician Barbara Jordan will 
be inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame Aug. 26. They were chosen 
from about 1,000 nominees, Sally Parr, the hall's executive director, said 
Wednesday in Washington, D.C. The other inductees are the late photojournalist 
Margaret Bourke-White and Florence Siebert, a medical researcher who isolated 
and purified protein.

Next Question: Richard Nixon still has the press to kick around. His new book, 
"In the Arena," contains some examples of typical reporters' comments, and what 
the former President thinks they really mean: Reporter: "You should hear what 
this other guy said about you." Nixon: "This is . . . entrapment . . . . Don't 
be surprised if your angry jibe appears in print and his doesn't." Reporter: 
"I'm going to write the story, whether you talk to me or not." Nixon: "The 
reporter might be worried he doesn't have a story at all unless you talk to 
him."

Hospitalized: Joy Baker, wife of former Senate Republican Leader Howard H. 
Baker Jr., has had a small malignant growth removed from her right lung. The 
tumor was removed Wednesday at a hospital in Rochester, Minn. A source familiar 
with her case, who did not wish to be identified, said the growth was "a 
low-grade tumor," not a recurrence of the cancer removed from the same lung in 
1982.

ARTISTIC SENSE INFUSES A RICH CHARACTER STUDY;

A CLOUD ON SAND BY GABRIELLA DE FERRARI, KNOPF $19.95, 323 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Born in Peru to Italian parents and educated in the United States, Gabriella De 
Ferrari has written her first novel in her third language. Though trained as a 
diplomat, she became director of Boston's Museum of Contemporary Art, then 
curator of the renowned Fogg Museum. All three national cultures and both 
professional disciplines figure significantly in "A Cloud on Sand," which 
begins in a small Italian coastal village, moves on to a provincial South 
American city with a sizeable Italian population, and is suffused throughout 
with an artistic sensibility to landscape, color and form. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the book is written in the English taught to an adult instead of 
the language naturally acquired by a child lends the prose a formal and 
somewhat dated quality perfectly suited to a story set abroad in the period 
from 1920 to the end of World War II. There's a lushness here, a sense of 
hyper-reality and an expansiveness of character that contrasts strongly with 
our contemporary home-grown pragmatism. The frame of reference is never taken 
for granted, but generously supplied by a variety of sensory images, so that 
the reader not only visualizes the exotic settings, but perceives the 
particular sounds, tastes and textures. At first the structure seems somewhat 
arbitrary and obscure. A woman named Marta, unidentified until the end of the 
novel, is asking questions of Antonia, eliciting the detailed answers that 
become the novel proper. After a brief prologue that takes place on a ship 
leaving Buenos Aires for the fictional town of Pica, in the country of Yayaku 
adjoining Chile, we're transported back to Antonia's girlhood in a small 
fishing village on the Italian Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
The time is the 1930s, and Artemisia is generally by-passed by foreign 
travelers eager to get from Genoa to Florence. Artemisia has few attractions, 
though it does boast a grand white stone villa set squarely in the midst of the 
crumbling medieval streets. This is Antonia's home, built as her father's 
capitulation to the wishes of her mother, Dora. After their wedding, Antonia's 
father had taken his capricious peasant bride to Argentina, where he was one of 
the newly prosperous Italian settlers. After one look at Buenos Aires, Dora 
refused to disembark, returning to Italy on the boat that brought her. Bowing 
to her indomitable will, her husband built the grand villa in Artemisia, 
visiting his family twice a year. In his long absences, Dora conducted herself 
as a single woman, taking a succession of casual lovers but soon settling upon 
the gentle and devoted Count Mora. He would be her protector for the rest of 
her days, acting in loco parentis for Antonia and her brother Marco, mitigating 
Dora's often baleful influence upon the children. 
</P>
<P>
In turn, Antonia falls in love and marries an Italian businessman living in 
Yayaku. Her character strengthened by the count's lofty ethical principles, 
Antonia remains in the remote outpost in which she finds herself, though she is 
still enough her mother's daughter to insist on living according to her own 
instincts and desires, not caring if she outrages Pica's tightly-knit and 
conservative Italian community. She becomes a strong and capable woman, a wife 
perhaps more adored than adoring, but essentially content with her 
extraordinary existence. 
</P>
<P>
De Ferrari gives us a spacious gallery of domestic interiors and landscape 
studies, re-creating the curious atmosphere of a European colony two continents 
away from its source; trapped in a time warp even more alienating than mere 
geographical distance. Against these rich, dense backgrounds, her characters 
grow in strength and vitality, welcoming us into a mysterious, vanished world.

I hope that Bree Walker and Jim Lampley will have a successful marriage, but I 
don't like what it says about our country's moral climate when the one person 
at KCBS who thought it was wrong for people who are married to be dating is 
referred to as "old-fashioned."

WHY NOT CALL HIM 'INTERRACIAL'? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the parent of an interracial child, I found Barack Obama an extreme example 
of the way society casts individuals into unquestioned sociopolitical 
classifications based upon skin tone ("Barack Obama's Law, " March 12). 
</P>
<P>
Here we have a person born of two races whose parents are citizens of Kenya and 
the United States, who grew up in Hawaii and Indonesia, and yet he finds 
himself at the age of 28 funneled and filtered into a category called "black" 
in an article that I imagine was intended to profile his achievements. 
</P>
<P>
After 38 paragraphs of the racial story we finally get to what "truly 
distinguishes" Obama: "his ability to make sense of complex legal arguments and 
translate them into current social concerns." 
</P>
<P>
The refusal to allow interracial people to identify themselves as such, and 
especially to acknowledge at all times their intimacy with two (or more) racial 
groups, I find as reactionary in this day and age as Jim Crow and Manzanar. 
</P>
<P>
While Mr. Obama has indeed become the first "black" to be elected president of 
the Harvard Law Review, he remains nonexistent as an interracial person, not to 
mention an individual.

<P>
When Bree Walker says "I don't think it has anything to do with my 
news-gathering abilities . . ." in defense of her apparent adulterous actions, 
it reminds me of Gary Hart. 
</P>
<P>
He used the same words in a vain attempt to defend his ability to run the 
country after being accused by the press and finally admitting the adultery 
during a presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
It's time the Fourth Estate stopped having it both ways. If you are going to 
call politicians to judgment on moral grounds, you must open yourselves to 
moral scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
If I have a right to know the integrity of my political representatives as 
defined by their personal lives, I have a right to know the same of my 
journalistic representatives. 
</P>
<P>
After all, the fact is that journalists have as much influence as politicians 
over the life of the average citizen.

What a delightful article. It serves to remind me that love is still "a 
many-splendored thing." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, there always seem to be some negative overtones from a few when 
happiness abounds. 
</P>
<P>
If these few find that Bree's and Jim's decorum doesn't meet their standards, 
nobody's stopping them from changing channels. 
</P>
<P>
I agree with Robert Hyland that one's personal life should be respected. We who 
hold positions in the professional arena hold these positions because we do the 
job that is expected of us. As long as Jim and Bree continue to do their jobs, 
it's none of the business of KCBS or their co-workers or the public whether 
they love or touch each other or not. 
</P>
<P>
I think they are two happy people and it shows. What a refreshing lift for the 
news.

R-Rated Films Banned in Class? In what is believed to be the first such case in 
California, Martinez Superior Court Judge Richard Patsey will consider whether 
R-rated films can be banned from high school classrooms. The case involves a 
1988 suit by the San Ramon Valley Education Assn. that challenged its school 
board's policy, which keeps films ranging from "Das Boot" and "One Flew Over 
the Cuckoo's Nest" to "The Breakfast Club" from being shown to students. The 
case was originally scheduled to be taken up today but was postponed until 
April 16. SHAUNA SNOW

'TWISTED JUSTICE' SLOW ON THE DRAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Twisted Justice" makes a quick stopover at selected theaters on its way to the 
video cassette stores. It's a relentlessly routine item set in 2020 when all 
guns have at last been banned, even for police. 
</P>
<P>
So what's a macho cop (David Heavener) to do when he goes up against a crazed 
scientist (David Campbell) who's impervious to standard issue stun guns, thanks 
to a a drug that both raises his intelligence and killer quotients? 
</P>
<P>
Never fear, Our Man does have an outlawed weapon that he conceals through 
disassembling it and incorporating it as parts of ordinary items in his seedy 
apartment -- e.g., the chamber of his gun becomes part of his shower head. Not 
exactly convenient for quick draws, but what the heck. 
</P>
<P>
The film is entirely negligible, but it is a professional effort, bolstered by 
such familiar names as Erik Estrada, Don Stroud, Jim Brown, Karen Black and 
Shannon Tweed in supporting roles. You have to hand it to Heavener, an 
erstwhile Nashville singer-composer, for having the determination to write, 
direct and produce a series of pictures -- "Twisted Justice" (rated R) is but 
the latest -- in which to showcase himself and which are viable in the 
international market. As an actor he's no better or worse than lots of others 
playing surly types with lots of attitude, but clearly his tenacity as a 
filmmaker sets him apart from the rest.KEVIN THOMAS

POIGNANT 'LONELY WOMAN SEEKS COMPANION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Irina Kupchenko, in the moving Soviet film "Lonely Woman Seeks Life Companion" 
(at the Monica 4-Plex) has a great movie face; layers and layers of emotion 
seem to be rippling underneath. In "Lonely Woman," her character at first seems 
drab, her expression drained and drawn. But it's a mask. Kupchenko can make 
herself plain, then make that plainness radiant. 
</P>
<P>
Here, she's playing seamstress Klavdia, an embittered woman of 43, unmarried, 
living alone, driven to posting little notices around Moscow -- "Lonely woman 
seeks life companion" -- in order to meet men. But Kupchenko, without 
sentimentality or trickery, shows what makes Klavdia special. Like all great 
actors, she unites us with her character, lets us feel and see with her. 
</P>
<P>
The plainness is part of the story's theme; it's about two people, equally 
alone, who briefly infiltrate each other lives. It's a poignant comedy of 
social barriers, with an air of wistful melancholy -- though, in translation, 
the pathos comes through more strongly than the humor. 
</P>
<P>
In the film, Klavdia's plaintive ad brings an unlikely respondent: an alcoholic 
ex-circus acrobat named Valentin (Alexander Zbruyev), a homeless man on a 
disability pension. Despite his winsome smile and charmingly straightforward 
manner, their first encounter almost ends in debacle. He tries to get money 
from her purse; she bops him on the head and throws him out. Then she relents. 
Beneath her brusque, weary surface -- a woman who's known too many wayward men, 
been stung too many times -- is a flow of tenderness and sympathy. Valentin 
seizes on this, returns to her again and again. 
</P>
<P>
The movie is a haunting little vignette. Shot in 1986, near the dawn of 
glasnost and perestroika, it reveals ideas and feelings that, to the West, 
later seemed to erupt from nowhere: discontent, malaise, oppression, a feeling 
that life under the old Communist rule was purposeless, empty and sad. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't the idyllic Moscow of Stalinist cinema, of brave workers striving 
for a better tomorrow. Instead, director Viacheslav Krishtofovich shows us a 
gray city, lines of men at the bars and liquor stores: real, unstaged views of 
Moscow, shot with a hidden camera. The blighted "romance" is clearly part of a 
larger social malaise, but the movie doesn't stress this. 
</P>
<P>
If a story like this had been made in an American studio during the '80s, it 
probably would have reflected the same selfish mind-set as Klavdia's snob-boss, 
who -- in an allegedly classless society -- castigates her for consorting with 
riff-raff. But this movie, with its low-key realism, looks at life more evenly. 
</P>
<P>
The obvious predecessors for Krishtofovich and writer Victor Merezhko are 
Delbert Mann, Paddy Chayefsky and movies like the 1955 "Marty." Like Mann, 
Krishtofovich is a first-time director from TV whose visual technique seem a 
little dull, almost styleless. Yet, at its best, "Lonely Woman" unrolls so 
naturally, so easily, it seems to be eavesdropping on life itself. There are 
some pat and preachy nudges in the writing but Krishtofovich has the right 
calm, compassionate tone throughout. 
</P>
<P>
As Valentin, Zbruyev is a fine homeless beau. His dialect shifts and inflated 
comic rhetoric aren't quite translatable, but his face is wonderfully hangdog. 
And Kupchenko, who won the best-actress award at the Montreal Festival with 
this film, is brilliant. She became a star early in life, in Andrei 
Konchalovsky's 1969 adaptation of Turgenev's "Nest of Gentry"; by now, her 
playing is effortless. 
</P>
<P>
Like Gerard Depardieu or Marlon Brando, she seems to be inhabiting her movies 
rather than acting in them, living out stories before the camera. And this 
story -- of lonely people in a society that tries to ignore its "losers" -- 
strikes chords far from Russia. Just like Klavdia's ad, "Lonely Woman Seeks 
Life Companion" (Times-rated Family, despite mature themes), is a plea for 
understanding, for the connections that make life bearable. Melancholy lies 
under its terseness, love under its simple lines.

JODOROWSKY SERVES UP MORE OF THE SAME IN 'SANTA SANGRE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Alejandro Jodorowsky, the Chilean-born maestro of wretched excess, is back at 
it after a 10-year absence. "Santa Sangre" (at the Nuart) is a grisly, 
grotesque cross between "Psycho" and the Tod Browning-Lon Chaney "The Unknown" 
served up with the writer-director's usual mishmash of religious and Freudian 
symbolism topped with Fellini flourishes. 
</P>
<P>
That Jodorowsky displays absolutely no sense of humor -- and not an iota of 
subtlety either -- makes this Mexican picture, which is being shown in a 
stilted English-language version, seem as silly as it is morbid. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder our hero Fenix (played by 8-year-old Adan Jodorowsky) suffers a 
mental breakdown, for he has witnessed his mother Concha (Blanca Guerra) and 
father El Gran Orgo (a portly Guy Stockwell), the gross, knife-throwing 
proprietor of Circo Gringo, caught up in the most savage acts of jealous rage 
and revenge. From the high wire, Concha spies her husband and the circus' 
voluptuous tattooed woman (Thelma Tixou) in the heat of passion. 
</P>
<P>
She throws a lethal dose of acid at his genitals; dying, he retaliates by 
slicing off her arms. There's crude poetic justice at work here, for Concha has 
been the high priestess at a Mexico City temple dedicated to the worship of a 
young girl raped by two brothers, who then cut off her arms; in the Browning 
film, Chaney plays a knife thrower who pretends to be armless, but then cuts 
off his arms in a macabre and tragic expression of love. 
</P>
<P>
Escaping from the asylum at age 20, Fenix (now played by Axel Jodorowsky) 
becomes his mother's red-nailed "hands," both offstage and on, where she 
pantomimes/recites the Fall in the Garden of Evil (inspired by "The Creation of 
the World" by mime Marcel Marceau, with whom Alejandro Jodorowsky worked and 
studied for six years). One of those crazed puritans who believe that all women 
other than herself are whores, Concha wills her son to become a mass murderer. 
</P>
<P>
Consumed with self-hatred, Fenix tries to concoct a potion that will render him 
invisible in emulation of Claude Rains in "The Invisible Man." However, his 
name isn't Fenix -- that's Spanish for phoenix -- for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
There's no denying Jodorowsky's visual flair in this film (rated a lenient R, 
considering the bloodshed), as in its all-too-similar predecessors, "El Topo" 
and "The Holy Mountain," but once again he exercises no restraint whatsoever 
upon his feverish imagination, which results repeatedly in the most obvious, 
overstated symbolism. Those weirdly compelling moments when Fenix becomes his 
mother's graceful, expressive hands and arms are lost amid gallons of spilled 
blood and garish, overwrought tableaux. 
</P>

HARD 'KNOCKS' FOR DANA CARVEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dana Carvey is such a blissfully twerpy presence on "Saturday Night Live" that 
his astonishing, Peter Sellers-like gift for mimicry is an added comic bonus. 
In his Church Lady and George Bush characterizations, he raises clenched WASP 
rectitude to dizzying satiric heights. 
</P>
<P>
In director Donald Petrie's "Opportunity Knocks" (citywide), Carvey has his 
first starring role in the movies. It's clearly meant to capitalize on his SNL 
personas; he gets a chance to impersonate an East Indian, a Japanese, and 
George Bush -- though not Church Lady. The results ought to be, if nothing 
else, an orgy of Carvey Characters, but few of his impersonations take hold. 
</P>
<P>
And when he's not dithering with some funny accent he's playing an affable con 
man with a heart of gold. He's supposed to be a romantic leading man here, and 
if there's one thing Carvey shouldn't be playing right now, it's romantic 
leads. Nothing kills comedy quicker than all this blubbery, ardent "sincerity." 
</P>
<P>
The plot has Carvey's Eddie and, later, his con-artist buddy Lou (Todd Graff) 
taking up residence in the ritzy suburban Chicago house they've broken into. 
The owner's mother (Doris Belack) mistakes Eddie for her son's house sitter -- 
and best friend from college. The father (Robert Loggia) is so taken with 
Eddie, whom he believes to be a hot-shot Harvard MBA type, that he secures him 
a vice presidency in his flagging bathroom fixtures company. And their 
physician daughter (Julia Campbell), initially skeptical of Eddie's supposed 
womanizer rep, also falls for him. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, Eddie falls for her, too. Since this whole scam is supposed to be a "love 
con" -- that is, Eddie sets out to wangle Dad's fortune by wooing the daughter 
-- his true-love stirrings threaten to ruin everything. 
</P>
<P>
They do more than ruin his scam; they ruin the movie. Carvey doesn't have the 
flair or the dramatic heft to portray a heartfelt romancer, and the script, by 
Mitchell Katlin and Nat Bernstein, doesn't provide the situations that might 
turn Eddie's seductions into something newfangled and funny. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing about "Opportunity Knocks" (rated PG-13) is newfangled; the jokes and 
plot mechanisms are moldy, even the characters are retreads. Robert Loggia's 
familial tycoon, for example, is a recap of his role in "Big." 
</P>
<P>
If you want to see Carvey do his George Bush impression, why haul yourself 
through this movie when you can just tune in to "Saturday Night Live"? Carvey 
is a wonderful lightweight joker who needs a tailor-made vehicle to shine. 
"Opportunity Knocks" is strictly off the rack.

HOME TECH / WHAT'S NEW IN VIDEO: 'DEAD POETS,' 'THE ABYSS' JOIN TAPE PARADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
THIS WEEK'S MOVIES 
</P>
<P>
Two very good but very different movies from last year make their video debut 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
"Dead Poets Society" (Touchstone, $89.95, PG) stars Robin Williams as an 
unconventional teacher at a private boys' school in 1959. Directed by Peter 
Weir, the funny and moving film shows -- as did "Stand and Deliver" -- how much 
difference a teacher can make when he or she is as daring as caring. 
</P>
<P>
"The Abyss" (CBS/Fox, $89.98, PG-13). You may be disappointed with the ending 
of this special-effects thriller, but chances are you'll enjoy the underwater 
trip that precedes it. Directed with dazzle by James Cameron ("The 
Terminator"). 
</P>
<P>
Other films fresh on tape: 
</P>
<P>
"The Pajama Game" (1957) and "Damn Yankees" (1958) both star Doris Day, both 
were co-directed by George Abbott and Stanley Donen, both feature exciting 
choreography by Bob Fosse, and both are colorful and lively versions of hit 
Broadway musicals. They're $59.95 each from Warner. 
</P>
<P>
"The Incredible Mr. Limpet" (1964) gave Don Knotts his strangest role (yes, 
even stranger than Barney) as a bookkeeper who turns into a, gulp, fish -- who, 
gulp again, becomes a war hero. The whimsical mix of live action and animation 
is no "Mary Poppins," but pretty charming all the same. Also $59.95 from 
Warner. 
</P>
<P>
"Chocolat" (1988, PG-13), "The Music Teacher" (1988, PG) and "Murmur of the 
Heart" (1971, R) are three notable foreign films from Orion ($79.98 each). All 
three feature easy-to-read yellow captions. 
</P>
<P>
"Night Ambush" (VidAmerica, $39.98), originally released in Britain in 1956 as 
"Ill Met By Moonlight," a taut World War II thriller, was the last film on 
which the famous "Archers" team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger worked 
together. 
</P>
<P>
"The Keys to the Kingdom" (1944), "A Man Called Peter" (1955) and "The Story of 
Ruth" all featured big Hollywood budgets and plenty of emotional 
self-sacrificing in the name of religion (Christian, of course), but not much 
else to recommend them. They're $29.98 each from CBS/Fox. 
</P>
<P>
"Fear Strikes Out" (1957) is a strong film depicting the battle baseball star 
Jimmy Piersall (Anthony Perkins) fought with mental illness. "Hell Is for 
Heroes" (1962) is a fairly decent WWII drama with Steve McQueen and Bobby 
Darin. Both are only $14.95 from Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
"Cookie" (Warner, $89.95, R) is one of the two crumby "comedies" director Susan 
Seidelman blessed us with last year (the other was "She-Devil"). This one has 
Emily Lloyd, Peter Falk, Dianne Wiest and Brenda Vaccaro in the tale of a teen 
and her racketeer father. 
</P>
<P>
OTHER NEW VIDEOS 
</P>
<P>
CBS/Fox has just released four volumes containing two "Twilight Zone" episodes 
each. These are the original, b&amp;w shows from the '50s and '60s, introduced 
by Rod Serling. Each volume sells for $14.98. 
</P>
<P>
That's not all, folks. MGM/UA has some more hourlong collections of those 
fantastic Warner Bros. cartoons from the '30s and '40s: "Daffy Duck and 
Company," "Porky Pig and Company" and "Bugs Vs. Elmer." They're $14.95 each.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: LAUNCHING AN UPSCALE BOATHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH REICHL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remi looks loved. 
</P>
<P>
This is not surprising. Remi, 1451 3rd St. Promenade, Santa Monica, (213) 
393-6545, was designed by architect Adam Tihany, who has already given us Bice 
and Pomodoro. 
</P>
<P>
But this time Tihany has done more than merely design a beautiful new 
restaurant; this time around, he's also the owner. 
</P>
<P>
That's him over there, walking worriedly around the room checking details. "Do 
you like your seat? How's the service? Is the pasta prepared the way you want 
it?" 
</P>
<P>
The answers are yes, very good, absolutely. The seats -- like everything else 
in this charmingly upscale boathouse -- are designed for both comfort and 
beauty. They cradle you. 
</P>
<P>
The service is solicitous: When the waiter arrives with your food, the captain 
is right behind him making sure that all is as you ordered it. 
</P>
<P>
And the food is -- for the most part -- good. Best dish of the evening: creamy 
polenta with squid in its own ink. Penne piccante was truly piquant, salads 
(especially one with arugula, Parmesan and walnuts) were superb. A veal chop 
was big, juicy and came with a comfortingly large mound of mashed potatoes. And 
the rest of the menu looks equally enticing. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. already has so many Italian restaurants, it's easy to wonder whether we 
really need another. But when the new one's this lovely, the answer is obvious.

AIN'T NOTHING PHONY ABOUT SONNIER'S CAJUN STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SANTA ANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Far more often than not, when an artist tries to bring a unique indigenous 
culture into the mainstream, that culture gets diluted or distorted beyond 
appreciation. Certainly Louisiana's Cajun culture has endured its share of 
bastardizations, with some accordion-ized efforts sounding like the musical 
equivalent of assembly-line Cajun potato chips. 
</P>
<P>
But in a splendid performance at Hamptons on Wednesday night, Jo-El Sonnier 
sank his Cajun roots into a number of musical territories, and made them all 
seem like home. 
</P>
<P>
A scant five years ago, Sonnier was known mainly as a musician's musician, 
which is a polite way of saying most people didn't know him from Superman's 
dad. On the pudgy side then, and sporting a Ringo haircut, he chiefly played 
traditional Cajun tunes on his diatonic button accordion. And even though his 
bands often included the likes of Garth Hudson, Albert Lee and David Lindley, 
his shows remained cloistered affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Today the slimmed-down, hair-slicked musician has a whole set of sharp stage 
moves, and a similarly revamped repertoire that has made him no stranger to the 
country Top 5. But, as evidenced Wednesday, he remains a passionate singer and 
a blindingly good accordionist, and nearly every song he touched in a varied 
26-song set was enriched by his bayou background. 
</P>
<P>
Sonnier and his four-piece band, the Instigators, opened with Hank Williams' 
"Jambalaya," giving it a slow, shimmering intro before kicking into a wild 
locomotive rhythm. Throughout the show his band worked with tight precision, 
with guitarist John Jackson being both the group's standout musician, thanks to 
inventive blues-based lines, and its occasional annoyance, when his high-volume 
fills at times trod over Sonnier's vocals. 
</P>
<P>
The set showed Sonnier's excellent ear for songs: He has given a second chance 
to undeservedly under-recognized tunes by Richard Thompson, Randy Newman, Dave 
Alvin, John Hiatt and others. His version of Alvin's song "So Long Baby 
Goodbye" rode like a hayride on fire, while a cover of Robert Cray Band writer 
Dennis Walker's "I've Slipped Her Mind" held a taut drama. 
</P>
<P>
Hiatt's "Have a Little Faith in Me," the title tune on Sonnier's current album, 
was the only song in the show to come up short. Hindered by an MOR-ballad 
arrangement, Sonnier's halfhearted vocal made no inroads on Hiatt's 
definitively emotive version. 
</P>
<P>
Sonnier more than made up for that lapse on Newman's beautiful "Louisiana 
1929." His vocal, full of that traditional Cajun plaint, gave an added 
firsthand character to Newman's account of a disastrous Louisiana flood. On the 
unaccompanied intro and end of the song, his haunting accordion interpretation 
of Newman's stately theme sounded like it was slowly wafting over a moonlit 
lake. 
</P>
<P>
There was a swampy menace mixed in with the feel of Elvis' early RCA sides on 
"The Hurt in My Heart," while versions of the insanely upbeat "Louisiana Blues" 
and Slim Harpo's "Rainin' in My Heart" were unquestionably from Dixie Beer 
territory. But even Sonnier's more pop-oriented attempts, such as the current 
single "Scene of the Crime" and the ballad "No More One More Time" had a Cajun 
earthiness to them. 
</P>
<P>
Sonnier saved his best for last, though. From Britisher Richard Thompson's 
Cajun-influenced "Tear-Stained Letter" through the pure Acadiana of the encore 
numbers "Evangeline Special" and "Chere Alice" and the zydeco boogie 
"Sugarbee," Sonnier shook his accordion as if it was a wolverine he was trying 
to get free of. 
</P>
<P>
Now 44, Sonnier cut his first Cajun record when he was 13. Though he now 
abandons his traditional button accordion on some of his more pop-based songs, 
he has few peers on the instrument, as his impossibly fast, ovation-drawing 
finger-work on "Sugarbee" demonstrated. And, as seems the case with all the 
best Cajun music, "Evangeline Special" and "Chere Alice" were brimming over 
with both sadness and celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Like the recent successes of Bonnie Raitt and Aaron Neville, Sonnier's music is 
cause for hope that music born of people, places, feelings and experiences can 
still find a place on the charts.

ETHNIC EATING: ETHIOPIAN KESTE DEMENA: IT'S AN ADVENTURE IN SPICINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eating Ethiopian style is a great ice breaker. Who can remain aloof while 
reaching into a communal platter and picking up food with your fingers? Pulling 
meat off the bones and dealing with soft, moist vegetable and lentil dishes in 
this fashion may be messy, but it's fun. 
</P>
<P>
What alleviates the mess is injera, a thin, spongy, fermented bread that is as 
soft as a handkerchief. Platters of food are lined with injera and more is 
served on the side. The technique is to tear off pieces and use them as scoops 
for the food. Made with wheat flour and with flour ground from a grain called 
teff, injera has a faint sour flavor. 
</P>
<P>
At Keste Demena (the name means rainbow), the Ethiopian food is fine and spicy. 
But more than anything, I'm intrigued by the way this Venice Boulevard 
restaurant serves coffee. The beans are roasted to order, and the rich, dark 
brew comes in a handleless earthen pot set on a brightly colored straw ring. 
You drink from tiny cups, like those used for Chinese tea. And while sipping, 
you inhale the sweet, strong perfume of incense. (Tiny incense pellets sit atop 
coals in a tall, golden container that is placed on the table alongside the 
coffee implements.) It's an enchanting ritual. 
</P>
<P>
But if sipping coffee here is a soothing experience, eating here can be a spicy 
adventure. Even the salad dressing tastes hot. At one meal, there were three of 
us, and we ordered only two dishes. That was plenty because salad, spiced red 
lentils and lots of injera were included in the dinner. One dish was doro wot, 
chicken with onion and hot pepper, simmered with spiced butter. Those are mild 
terms for a very aggressively seasoned bird. The other was yessiga tibbs, a 
sort of Ethiopian pepper beef. 
</P>
<P>
Recurring themes here are raw meat and the taste of butter. Kitfo, a dish of 
beef top-round cut into tiny cubes, combines both. Those who object to the raw 
kitfo that Ethiopians prefer can have it cooked. My group tried both ways and 
loved the taste of the raw meat inundated with butter and spices. The butter, 
by the way, is made by boiling unsalted domestic butter and adding imported 
Ethiopian butter and spices. 
</P>
<P>
Those alarmed by the liberal use of this ingredient in the meats can try Keste 
Demena's "no-cholesterol plate." This is put together from a list of vegetarian 
dishes, some of which are mustard greens; a combination of green beans, potato, 
cabbage and carrots; red lentils and a fine lentil salad that is crunchy with 
shallots and raw chiles. 
</P>
<P>
The meats served here are chicken, beef and lamb -- no pork. Fish is available 
during Lent, although it is not on the menu. Yebeg wot is the well-seasoned and 
really great tasting lamb. Another lamb dish, yebeg alicha, contains fresh 
ginger, garlic, turmeric and spiced butter, but the sauce is mild. There is 
also a chicken version. 
</P>
<P>
Zigni is a zesty beef stew, and minchetabish is wonderfully seasoned beef that 
is ground as fine as coarse sand. I'd love to put some of it in a taco. I 
didn't do so well with tere sega, a bowlful of thick blocks of raw beef that 
was . . . well, too much rawness for me. But I did like the dipping sauce, a 
thin, red mixture called awaze. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant serves Ethiopian breakfast until noon. And the menu includes a 
few pasta dishes, a reminder of the years when the country was occupied by 
Italy. The beverages are non-alcoholic except for a mild, home-fermented honey 
wine called tej. It's as yellow as fruit juice and has a nice dry tang. 
</P>
<P>
 Keste Demena Ethiopian Restaurant, 5779 W. Venice Blvd., Los Angeles. (213) 
933-6522. Open Thursday through Tuesday, 11 a.m.-11 p.m. Major credit cards 
accepted. Reservations advised on weekends. Dinner for two, food only, $14-$30.

'DANCING FOR MR. B' CELEBRATES BALANCHINE ON PBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rich in anecdote, emotion and insight, "Dancing for Mr. B.: Six Balanchine 
Ballerinas" illuminates the careers and personal lives of major artists to get 
at something larger -- the creation of American masterpieces and a company to 
perform them. 
</P>
<P>
Directed by Anne Belle, the 90-minute PBS "Dance in America" telecast is 
scheduled tonight at 9 on Channels 15 and 24, at 9:30 on Channel 28, Sunday at 
9 p.m. on Channel 50. 
</P>
<P>
Interviews with Mary Ellen Moylan, Maria Tallchief, Melissa Hayden, Allegra 
Kent, Merrill Ashley and Darci Kistler trace a 40-year history of American 
dance from before the founding of New York City Ballet to the present, 
post-Balanchine era. 
</P>
<P>
But there's more: intimate details about working (and living) with Balanchine, 
plus discussions -- often illustrated with vintage films -- that help isolate 
the components of Balanchine's style. 
</P>
<P>
Tallchief calls Moylan "the first great Balanchine dancer" and, indeed, 
Moylan's memories of the 1940s -- "pioneering days for the ballets of 
Balanchine across the United States" -- convey a sense of wondrous discovery. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond recalling her marriage to Balanchine, Tallchief speaks candidly about 
how he reshaped her as a dancer to suit his choreographic needs. Hayden talks 
of the evolution of a New York City Ballet physical type ("elongated, like a 
racehorse") and both women are very eloquent when remembering how Balanchine's 
interest turned away from them to younger dancers. 
</P>
<P>
Kent's unsparing self-appraisals are even more intense ("At times, I was too 
out of this world"), dramatizing the conflict between a private life and a 
dance career that Tallchief also cites. 
</P>
<P>
Ashley celebrates Balanchine the teacher, emphasizing the elements of 
"exaggeration and repetition" in his classes. And she summarizes his creativity 
in the most direct terms: "He just took everything that he saw and used it to 
his advantage to get more from us." 
</P>
<P>
Kistler proves especially valuable when describing Balanchine as coach ("What 
he ended up doing was always giving me myself"). Each of these women highlights 
a facet of Balanchine's genius that helps us see even his most familiar ballets 
more clearly.

KILLDOZER: THICK-ROCK FOR DREAM STATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD

<TEXT>
<P>
When you fall asleep in the back of a rock club at 3 in the morning, the 
Wisconsin power trio Killdozer is the music that you dream: vestigial pounding 
and low guitar drone, bass like what booms from your neighbor's party 
downstairs after you've turned off all the lights and wrapped a pillow around 
your ears. Killdozer -- emphasis on doze -- plays thick-rock; its current 
album, "12-Point Buck," is something of an underground classic. 
</P>
<P>
At Bogart's on Wednesday, Killdozer's narcoleptic drummer Dan Hobson looked 
ready to fall asleep at any moment; his beat was not so much powerful as 
deliberate. Frontman Michael Gerald intoned in a mutant cross between Laibach 
and the Fall's Mark Smith, acerbic lyrics delivered in a guttural hell-voice. 
Though you can't make out a word he says, you get the feeling of great 
intelligence from Gerald, the way you would watching a young man sweat his way 
through his Ph.D orals in a language you don't understand. Performing is 
probably very therapeutic for him. Guitarist Bill Hobson entangled himself in 
his guitar strap as if it were seaweed, and then reconciled himself to playing 
with his teeth for a while. JONATHAN GOLD

AT THE GALLERIES: SHAW'S BLAND ART CAN'T LIVE UP TO OVERBLOWN INTERPRETATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEAH OLLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Somewhere between Reesey Shaw's understated art and Dave Hickey's overstated 
catalogue essay lies a middle ground of eloquence, self-confidence and 
appealing energy. Rarely, however, do Shaw's forms and Hickey's words meet 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"Reesey Shaw: Selected Works 1980-1990," at the Mesa College Art Gallery 
through April 6, traces the evolution of the artist's style from blithe 
decoration to austere formalism. "Trinity," representing the earlier phase, and 
"Nature" the more recent, together mark this shift in clear, before-and-after 
terms. Both are wall-mounted wood constructions, painted in encaustic, a 
combination of pigment and wax fused to the painting surface while warm. In 
"Nature," Shaw also uses oil paint. 
</P>
<P>
In "Trinity" (1982), overlapping planes of cream and pale mauve form a 
modest-size rectangle, a stage for three floating crescents, one each in light 
blue, drab green and white. A band of light blue, speckled with green, crowns 
the ensemble. Quiet to the point of blandness, "Trinity" occupies its space 
with demure politeness. Its title hints at spiritual meaning, but its form 
retreats shyly from any such commitment. 
</P>
<P>
"Nature," begun the same year but completed in 1989, assumes a grander posture 
and achieves a far more powerful presence. Over six feet tall, the work's three 
separate but adjoining vertical bands echo the scale and rigidity of the 
upright human body. Here, the title and green, white and blue bands suggest the 
earthly triumvirate of land, air and water, and the fluid, relatively flat 
surface of "Trinity" has given way to one more heavily textured, scraped and 
melted smooth. 
</P>
<P>
Like many sculptors in the late 1980s -- such as Mark Lere and Jene Highstein 
-- Shaw, a local artist and curator, has struck a winning compromise between 
the geometry of minimalism and the idiosyncrasies of organic form. Her 
"Untitled Plank" (1986) and "Flat Mantis" (1986) deviate just enough from the 
basic and blocky to suggest animate energy. Their surfaces, too, have been 
individualized, personalized, unlike the uniformly slick skins of minimalist 
sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
In about half of Shaw's recent works, this sublimation of organic elements is 
performed with grace and elegance. The others, such as the works related to 
head forms, lack both the purity of their peers and the whimsical, albeit 
shallow, character of their precedents. They protrude clumsily from the wall, 
heavy and mute. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Hickey, a gifted writer and critic, presents quite a different artist in 
his catalogue essay, one whose work offers a profound meditation on the nature 
of loss and decay, or its converse, the process of becoming. Such depth can be 
found in "Nature," or perhaps in "Flower," another of the tripartite works, but 
most of Shaw's wall sculpture cannot sustain such ambitious interpretation. 
Ultimately, the imbalance in tone is flattering to neither subject nor author.

PORT OF L.A. STEAMS PAST NEW YORK AS BUSIEST IN U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Port of Los Angeles has surpassed New York as the nation's busiest 
commercial gateway in a shift that symbolizes the burgeoning importance of 
Pacific Rim trade, the U.S. Customs commissioner said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The ascension of Los Angeles, after historical domination by the Port of New 
York, represents a milestone in an east-to-west realignment that has brought 
Southern California to prominence as a hub of international commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"It's literally growing by leaps and bounds," Customs Commissioner Carol 
Hallett said of the new Pacific traffic. "The merchandise coming in . . . is 
just staggering." 
</P>
<P>
According to agency statistics, about 1.4 million 20-foot cargo containers 
passed through the Port of Los Angeles last year. The increased volume 
established the port as the leading source of government revenue from 
commercial traffic, with annual collection of tariffs and fees in excess of 
$1.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Port of Long Beach appears very likely to become the nation's 
second-busiest port, with traffic volume last year only slightly less than that 
of New York and increasing, according to newly collected data. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Southern California said they were not surprised to learn of the 
rising stature of the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just that the Pacific Rim has a much more direct shot to us," said Chuck 
Ellis, a spokesman for the Port of Los Angeles. "Why go all the way around the 
world?" 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure came at a breakfast session with The Times' Washington Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
The agency's statistics show that in terms of commercial traffic, Los Angeles 
led the nation in 1989 with 1.44 million cargo containers imported or exported. 
New York ranked second, with 1.20 million containers, while Long Beach was 
close behind, with 1.17 million. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar value of goods passing through the Port of New York remains the 
highest in the nation. But Customs Service officials said it was now beyond 
question that Los Angeles was "taking over" from New York. The officials 
predicted that the trend would continue through the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole Pacific Coast is definitely going to keep climbing from everything 
we've seen, and it's going to be a significant shift," Sam Banks, the assistant 
Customs commissioner for commercial operations, said at the breakfast session. 
</P>
<P>
Besides proximity to Asian markets, Southern California port officials said the 
recent gains reflect the region's economy and climate. The economy, they said, 
provides a powerful market for imported goods; the weather ensures that 
year-round shipping. 
</P>
<P>
But the port officials indicated that traffic has not been increasing as 
rapidly as in the early 1980s, when commerce and income jumped by as much as 
20% a year at the Port of Long Beach. More recently, communications officer 
Elmar Baxter said, annual increases have averaged about 5%. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach officials noted that traffic there already exceeds that in Los 
Angeles in total tonnage, including crude oil and other liquid cargoes. But Los 
Angeles handles more of the general cargo that is used as the principal measure 
of international commerce. 
</P>
<P>
In pledging to give new priority to improving the flow of international 
commerce, Hallett made clear that she intends to chart a markedly different 
course than that of her controversial predecessor, William Von Raab. 
</P>
<P>
While insisting that the agency's anti-drug operations would not suffer, 
Hallett indicated that she would seek to ease unnecessary Customs barriers that 
the trade community believes have slowed traffic at ports. 
</P>
<P>
In calling attention to the "phenomenal amount of merchandise" now flowing 
through Los Angeles and Long Beach harbors, Hallett also issued a call to arms 
to their eastern competitors. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been trying to generate a little competition between the brokers and 
importers, between the East Coast and the West Coast, because I think it's just 
good for them all to strive to do a better job," she said. "It's big business." 
</P>
<P>
Customs officials acknowledged that the changing patterns of seagoing trade 
have caused some headaches for the agency. 
</P>
<P>
A report commissioned by West Coast port authorities in 1987 charged that 
failures by Customs to keep pace with the westward shift had resulted in 
serious delays in the processing of passengers and goods. 
</P>
<P>
Banks contended Thursday that there has since been "some balancing" of Customs 
inspectors across the country. But he acknowledged that "limited resources and 
limited manpower" meant that short-staffing on Western ports remains a problem. 
</P>
<P>
Hallett also left no doubt of her determination to depart from the pattern 
established by her predecessor in a number of other arenas crucial to the 
Customs Service. 
</P>
<P>
Von Raab was relentless in his criticism of foreign governments for what he 
characterized as their reluctance to enlist in the war on drugs. When he 
resigned last summer, he delivered an angry speech that blasted the State 
Department and other agencies for giving higher priority to other concerns. 
</P>
<P>
But Hallett, a former minority leader in the California Assembly, described 
herself as a commissioner who would strive for consensus. 
</P>
<P>
"My approach is somewhat different," she said when asked about her predecessor. 
She noted that she had already met with high-level Mexican officials -- Von 
Raab's most frequent target -- in an effort to "forge a partnership." 
</P>
<P>
"You don't get anywhere if you bash them," Hallett said of the Mexican 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Darrell Dawsey in Los Angeles contributed to this story.

U.S. ACCUSES IRAQ IN A-TRIGGER PLOT; 
</P>
<P>
SMUGGLING: OFFICIALS SAY THAT BAGHDAD UNDOUBTEDLY INTENDED 40 DEVICES SEIZED IN 
LONDON FOR NUCLEAR ARMS.

<P>
U.S. authorities accused the Iraqi government Thursday of masterminding an 
elaborate plot to smuggle electronic devices from California to Baghdad for 
eventual use in detonating nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Unsealing an indictment by a federal grand jury in San Diego against five 
alleged agents of the government in Baghdad, officials said they hope to 
extradite for prosecution in the United States the plot's alleged ringleader, 
Ali Ashour Daghir, and possibly other participants. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Daghir and two accomplices were charged Thursday in an Uxbridge 
Magistrates Court in West London with violating British export laws. Both U.S. 
and British officials reiterated their concerns about the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons in the Mideast. 
</P>
<P>
"This is probably the biggest case the Customs Service has ever had," said U.S. 
Customs Commissioner Carol Hallett. "It was a very frightening situation." 
</P>
<P>
As new details of the 18-month sting operation emerged on both sides of the 
Atlantic, Iraqi officials vehemently denounced the U.S. and British actions. 
President Saddam Hussein told a Baghdad rally that the nation's enemies are 
trying to hinder Iraq's "march of progress." 
</P>
<P>
The official Iraqi news agency INA said the acting head of the British Embassy 
in Baghdad was summoned to the Foreign Ministry and told by Undersecretary 
Nizar Hamdoon that "Iraq did not violate the laws of Britain or any other 
country." INA said a Foreign Ministry spokesman "denied categorically, chapter 
and verse, allegations contained in a statement by the British authorities on 
Wednesday." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, senior Customs agent John C. Kelley said there is no doubt that 
the Iraqis had intended to use the U.S.-made devices, called capacitors, to 
help set off nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing with Hallett at a press conference, Kelley said: "Based on their 
specifications . . . it left nothing to the imagination . . . as to what the 
purpose would be." 
</P>
<P>
The indictment, which charged the defendants with five counts of conspiracy to 
export defense articles, said they represented two firms that "acted as agents 
for the Republic of Iraq in the procurement of defense articles, military 
equipment and munitions items." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the indictment said the devices were sought by the defendants "on 
behalf of Al Qaqaa State Establishment, a division of the Ministry of Industry 
and Military Industrialization of the Republic of Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
Portions of the indictment contained extensive excerpts from conversations that 
appeared to have been surreptitiously recorded, a fact that officials 
reluctantly confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
"The tapes will be presented in court in San Diego," Kelley said. 
</P>
<P>
The legal status of the five suspects remained unclear Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities were unable to resolve whether any of them can be extradited from 
Britain to the United States under a bilateral treaty. The issue is still 
"under review," said Dan Eramian, a U.S. Justice Department spokesman in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, the plot's mastermind was Daghir, 49, a dual 
Iraqi-British citizen who ran an Iraqi government purchasing office from a 
London suburb. The firm posed as a food export company called Euromac (London) 
Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
The other suspects named in the indictment are Jeanine Celestine Speckman, 41, 
a Euromac executive; and three engineers: Karim Dhaidas Omran, Wallid Issa 
Ahmad and Dafir Al-Azawi. The three engineers are believed to be in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that in the case of those who are currently in Great Britain there 
will be an effort -- at least discussions with respect to extraditing them," 
Hallett said. "But for those who are in Iraq, obviously there is little 
likelihood that we will see them here in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
In the London court proceeding, a magistrate ordered Daghir held without bail 
pending a court hearing April 5. The magistrate released Speckman on bail and 
ordered a court appearance on May 10. 
</P>
<P>
The magistrate ordered another alleged Daghir accomplice, Toufic Fouad Amyuni, 
held without bail. U.S. officials said that Amyuni was not involved in the U.S. 
case. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the British Home Office ordered the deportation of Omar Latif, 
described as the station manager at Heathrow Airport for Iraqi Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Still another suspect, a Cypriot with a British passport, was released after 
questioning Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The international sting operation was set in motion in September, 1988, when 
Daghir approached a San Marcos, Calif., firm, CSI Technologies Inc., seeking to 
buy custom-made, high-voltage capacitors, according to the indictment and 
information provided by U.S. officials. 
</P>
<P>
The request quickly aroused the suspicion of CSI President Jerold D. Kowalsky, 
who alerted Customs officials and agreed to play an important part in the 
sting. 
</P>
<P>
The capacitors allegedly sought by the Iraqis are electric energy storage 
devices designed to quickly discharge about 5,000 volts of electricity into a 
trigger in order to detonate a nuclear missile warhead. 
</P>
<P>
After further contacts were made with the Iraqis, Hallett said, Customs agents 
learned that "Euromac is an official purchasing office of the Iraqi government 
which had done millions of dollars of business in procuring military materiel 
for the Iraqi government during the Iran-Iraq conflict." 
</P>
<P>
By May, 1989, Euromac officials had disclosed to Kowalsky and a Customs 
undercover agent, Daniel Supnick, that the devices were destined for Al Qaqaa 
State Establishment, a part of the Iraqi Ministry of Industry and Military 
Industrialization, Hallett said. 
</P>
<P>
Additional investigations by Customs agents confirmed that Al Qaqaa is a 
facility involved in the development of missiles and rockets and explosives 
research and development for the Iraqi government, she added. 
</P>
<P>
During the negotiations between Daghir and CSI, the Iraqis also expressed an 
interest in acquiring another type of sophisticated device called krytrons, 
which serve as actual triggers for nuclear bombs. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Customs agents persuaded the sole domestic manufacturer of 
krytrons, EG&amp;G of Wellesley, Mass., to participate in the sting operation. 
</P>
<P>
The firm provided Customs with 40 inoperable devices, but agent Kelley said 
that the plot never progressed to a stage that called for use of the phony 
triggers. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Euromac, which later changed its name to Atlas Equipment (U.K.) Ltd., 
paid $10,000 for 100 capacitors. CSI earlier this month shipped 40 to London's 
Heathrow Airport, by way of the Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The shipment was closely monitored by U.S. and British officials throughout the 
journey, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
When it reached a cargo hangar at Heathrow, British officials substituted dummy 
capacitors as a precaution. Several days elapsed before the Iraqis moved to 
load the crate, labeled as containing air-conditioning units, onto an Iraqi 
Airways jet bound for Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities then moved in. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, each person named in the San Diego indictments faces up to five 
years in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000. The firms face a maximum fine 
of $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
At the State Department in Washington, spokesman Richard Boucher carefully 
avoided any direct criticism of Iraq, while denying that the Bush 
Administration is letting the Iraqis off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
Boucher reiterated the Administration's concern about nuclear proliferation, 
but he did not accuse Iraq of violating the Non-Proliferation Treaty, of which 
it is a signatory, or of trying to develop a nuclear weapon. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not foresee a near-term Iraqi nuclear weapons capability," Boucher said. 
"However, we remain concerned about the danger that Iraq may seek to develop a 
nuclear weapons option in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the incident will have an impact on U.S.-Iraqi relations, Boucher 
said, "I don't have any conclusions as to that. I said we'll examine the 
information from this case very carefully, and we're raising at this point our 
concerns with the Iraqis both here and in Baghdad." 
</P>
<P>
The State Department called in Iraq's ambassador, Mohammed Mashat, to register 
U.S. concerns about the case. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the Iraqi plot sparked a lively debate in the House of Commons, with 
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher calling it a "very, very serious incident." 
</P>
<P>
Sounding a similar note struck by President Bush on Wednesday, Thatcher said 
Britain is now "urgently contacting" the signatories of the Non-Proliferation 
Treaty and related agreements "to see what we can do . . . (so) there is no 
repeat of this. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Also in the House of Commons, the opposition Labor Party's shadow foreign 
secretary, Gerald Kaufman, demanded that Britain expel Baghdad's ambassador and 
break off diplomatic relations in retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
But Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd rejected that course, noting that two 
Britons are being held prisoner in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see considerable risk and damage by breaking off diplomatic relations . 
. . and no actual advantage," he said. "I do not want to get into a position 
where we not only leave our citizens, including our two prisoners, without 
protection, but we also get in a position where we don't actually have an 
embassy in the Middle East between the Khyber Pass and the Mediterranean." 
</P>
<P>
Britain is said to be Iraq's third-largest trading partner, and about 2,000 
British citizens live in Iraq. Despite pleas for clemency from the British 
government, Iraq executed a British journalist of Iranian birth earlier this 
month after convicting him of espionage.

VA TO PAY SOME AGENT ORANGE CANCER CLAIMS 
</P>

In a significant shift in federal policy, Vietnam veterans suffering from a 
rare form of cancer that they claim was caused by exposure to the defoliant 
Agent Orange will receive full disability benefits, Veterans Affairs officials 
announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control found in a study released 
Thursday that Vietnam veterans are 50% more likely than non-veterans to 
contract non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, even though they specifically denied a link 
between Agent Orange exposure and incidence of the cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Acting immediately after receipt of the CDC study, Secretary of Veterans 
Affairs Edward J. Derwinski ordered full benefits paid to some 1,800 veterans 
who currently suffer from the disease and to the expected 450 new cases 
expected each year for the next several decades. 
</P>
<P>
Derwinski's decision marks the first time that the federal government has 
acknowledged a link between service in Vietnam and incidence of any form of 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Veterans groups applauded the decision, but said that tens of thousands of 
Vietnam veterans still await government help in coping with several cancers and 
other health problems they believe were caused by Agent Orange exposure. 
</P>
<P>
The CDC study and the shift in VA policy will not end the long, bitter dispute 
over Agent Orange and cancer, veterans' advocates and government officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
While the CDC study found a clear link between service in Vietnam and 
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, CDC Director Dr. William L. Roper stated: "The study 
did not find any evidence that the increased risk might be due to Agent Orange 
exposure." 
</P>
<P>
In an unexpected and unexplained finding, Roper noted that sailors who served 
on ships far off the Vietnam coast suffered the highest incidence of 
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, also known as NHL. Soldiers and airmen who served in 
III Corps, the area of the heaviest spraying of the chemical herbicide, were at 
lower risk of contracting the disease, the CDC found. 
</P>
<P>
Derwinski said the link between service in Vietnam and the cancer was 
compelling enough to demand action, but the VA chief offered no opinion as to 
whether Agent Orange played a part in generating the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"The debate may well go on forever," Derwinski said in a press conference. 
"There may never be enough scientific and technical evidence to put to rest 
forever all the charges and countercharges relating to Agent Orange." 
</P>
<P>
He called Thursday's action "a practical and humanitarian decision." He 
stressed it was "not a scientific decision, and it should not be seen as one. 
It was a policy determination. . . . Remember, this is a kinder, gentler 
Administration." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 36,000 Vietnam veterans have applied for VA benefits on claims that they 
contracted cancer or other maladies as a result of exposure to Agent Orange, a 
defoliant containing dioxin, a highly toxic agent that was widely sprayed in 
Vietnam from 1961 to 1972. 
</P>
<P>
All of the Agent Orange cancer claims have until now been denied, although 
21,000 of the Agent Orange claimants are receiving medical care from the VA, 
agency officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Mary R. Trout, national president of the Vietnam Veterans of America and one of 
the most vocal critics of federal policy on Agent Orange, called Derwinski's 
decision "very positive." 
</P>
<P>
But she quickly added: "We still have some concerns. If it takes a 50% increase 
(in the incidence of a cancer) to win benefits, then it's going to take a very 
long time for other veterans" to be compensated for Vietnam-related health 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Miles S. Epling, national commander of the American Legion, praised Derwinski 
for "taking one small step toward resolution of this problem we've been 
fighting for over 10 years." He said he hoped Derwinski would now speed 
consideration of claims based on 10 other maladies that veterans say are 
related to Agent Orange. 
</P>
<P>
But Epling blasted the CDC study as "irrelevant." 
</P>
<P>
"It has nothing to do with Agent Orange, and it says so. It's a piece of 
garbage as far as we're concerned," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The CDC study looked at cases of six types of cancer among Vietnam veterans and 
other men between the ages of 35 and 59. The study found that the Vietnam 
veterans were at no greater risk than the non-veterans of contracting five of 
the cancers: soft-tissue and other sarcomas, Hodgkin's disease, nasal cancer, 
nasopharyngeal cancer and cancer originating in the liver. 
</P>
<P>
The VA will continue to deny benefits to Vietnam veterans with these cancers 
who claim they are service-connected, but Derwinski left open the possibility 
that future research could support payment of such claims. 
</P>
<P>
For non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph nodes and lymphatic tissues 
that is similar to leukemia, Vietnam veterans were 50% more likely to come down 
with the disease than those in the same age group who did not serve in 
Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
NHL has a latency period of 15 to 25 years and if left untreated is virtually 
always fatal. Chemotherapy has prolonged the life of a number of NHL patients 
but has not reversed the degenerative disease. 
</P>
<P>
Derwinski said that for VA purposes, any Vietnam veteran with NHL will be 
considered 100% disabled and will be paid full benefits -- today worth about 
$1,527 a month -- for the rest of his life. Widows and children of NHL victims 
will also be entitled to maximum compensation, $500-$1,000 a month depending on 
the veteran's rank at retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Vietnam veterans who claim Agent Orange-related health problems 
are eligible for compensation from a $180-million fund established by seven 
chemical companies that produced the defoliant. The firms agreed to provide the 
money as the result of a class-action lawsuit by veterans. 
</P>
<P>
So far, 17,000 servicemen have been declared eligible for compensation from the 
fund and have received a total of $84 million, according to attorneys handling 
the fund.

LITHUANIAN DESERTERS GET AMNESTY OFFER 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Kremlin proclaimed a conditional amnesty Thursday for Lithuanian deserters, 
a new conciliatory offer in the clash over independence. But Lithuania's leader 
voiced distrust of the gesture and made a personal appeal for U.S. diplomatic 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
"The freedom of Lithuania is in great danger," the breakaway Baltic republic's 
president, Vytautas Landsbergis, told Congress in a letter. "We wait with 
strong hearts and no weapons in our hands for your help in this difficult 
struggle against militarism and aggression, in this struggle for peace and 
justice." 
</P>
<P>
Landsbergis, who presided over the Parliament's unilateral declaration of 
independence March 11, appealed to Congress members to press the Bush 
Administration for official recognition, saying this would prevent Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev from committing a "gross mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Not a single foreign country has recognized Lithuania's independence, which 
Gorbachev and the Soviet leadership reject as illegal, and President Bush has 
come under attack from restive U.S. lawmakers for his reticence. Landsbergis' 
letter, read aloud by its author in Parliament, was clearly intended to turn up 
the heat. 
</P>
<P>
However, the United States has also never recognized the Kremlin's right to 
govern in this land, since Lithuania and its two Baltic neighbors, Estonia and 
Latvia, were forcibly annexed by the Soviets in 1940 and stripped of their 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater was asked Thursday 
why Bush had not indulged his penchant for personal diplomacy and called 
Gorbachev about Lithuania. He replied that the dispute is a "complex and 
sensitive matter." 
</P>
<P>
"The corollary is that we would not want to take moves that disrupted that 
diplomatic effort," Fitzwater said, "and the President simply feels this is not 
time to make a direct contact to Chairman Gorbachev for those reasons." 
</P>
<P>
In Prague, Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel offered in a message to 
Gorbachev and Landsbergis to help mediate the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that the only possible solution in this difficult situation is 
an open and just political dialogue between representatives of the Soviet Union 
and Lithuania. Czechoslovakia . . . is ready to facilitate this dialogue 
through its services and neutral grounds." 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin's conciliatory offer toward deserters comes two days after the most 
brutal incident of the secession conflict, when Soviet paratroopers raided 
hospitals in Lithuania's two largest cities, Vilnius and Kaunas, and seized 23 
conscripts who had deserted from the armed forces, reportedly beating some of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin's use of military muscle outraged Landsbergis and Prime Minister 
Kazimiera Prunskiene, who demanded that Gorbachev act to return their 
"kidnaped" citizens. The Soviets said the conscripts were simply being forced 
to return to military service, which is compulsory for most Soviet young men. 
</P>
<P>
According to Landsbergis, more than 800 Lithuanians have deserted from the 
armed forces in recent weeks because of the independence proclamation or the 
brutal treatment meted out to Baltic draftees. Many Lithuanians believe they 
should not serve in the army of a "foreign" country. 
</P>
<P>
In an obvious attempt to reduce frictions over the deserters, the Soviet 
Defense Ministry announced Thursday that it would not prosecute missing 
Lithuanians who give themselves up and agree to resume their service, which 
runs for two years in the army and three in the navy. 
</P>
<P>
"Unrepenting deserters, however, will be tracked down, apprehended and punished 
in line with the law," the official Soviet news agency Tass quoted a ministry 
spokesman as saying. Penalties for refusing to serve in the armed forces range 
from three to seven years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry did not say when the amnesty would expire, and Landsbergis 
reacted warily. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have much trust in this promise of amnesty," he told a news 
conference. "There have been many times when high military officials lied to 
us, and we have some idea of the terrors that happen to these young men when 
they return to their units." 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Frants Markovsky of the Soviet General Staff told Tass that 51 
deserters have already been sent back to their detachments. Whether or not that 
number includes the 23 rousted Tuesday from the two hospitals, the statement 
means that hundreds of Lithuanian conscripts are still at large. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Landsbergis' suspicions, there were further signs Thursday that the 
Lithuanians' position was softening. Deputy Prime Minister Romualdas Ozolas 
announced that the Council of Ministers, or Cabinet, had appealed to citizens 
to turn their firearms over to police for safekeeping, as Gorbachev had 
demanded March 21. 
</P>
<P>
The deadline for voluntary compliance with Gorbachev's order expired Wednesday, 
with officials then having the task of seizing weapons. Lithuanian leaders 
initially said that Gorbachev had no right to tell people in an independent 
nation what to do, but changed their minds to discourage house-by-house 
searches by soldiers and possible incidents. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't let people face the force of the Soviet army alone," Ozolas said in 
an interview. "They would then feel as though they can't be safe and nobody 
will protect them." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet television said Thursday night that 5,000 rifles, pistols, shotguns and 
other firearms are being kept in a warehouse, along with about 1 million rounds 
of ammunition. Ozolas said the Council of Ministers' resolution, approved late 
Wednesday and read on television, asked Lithuanians to bring their guns to 
local police precincts, where they will be put in temporary storage. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Lithuanian government put off as too confrontational its 
controversial plans to establish its own border controls, customs service and 
frontier guards, steps that would have effectively separated the republic from 
the rest of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Landsbergis also indicated a new flexibility on holding a referendum on the 
question of secession, as demanded by the central government, which contends 
that ethnic Russians and Poles -- roughly 20% of the republic's 3.7-million 
population -- as well as many Lithuanians want to remain in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Landsbergis reiterated Thursday that he was ready to talk about a referendum, 
suggesting that the question to put to Lithuanians was: "Do you wish to become 
part of a 
</P>
<P>
foreign country?" 
</P>
<P>
However, the republic's Communist Party chief, Algirdas Brazauskas, who spoke 
at the same news conference, said the question should be whether voters favor 
secession or not, as though Lithuania were still legally a part of the Soviet 
Union. He said such a vote would give the leadership powerful legitimacy in 
Moscow's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubts about the possible results of a referendum, but I'm saying a 
referendum would be an additional ace in our negotiations," declared the 
Communist leader, who advocated a slower course toward independence than 
Landsbergis but joined the new government as a deputy prime minister to support 
the cause. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its recent backing away from confrontation, Lithuania has had no luck 
in persuading Soviet authorities to open formal talks on independence, 
Landsbergis said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are seeking contacts with Moscow, but it's very hard to establish contacts 
with a brick wall," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As the dispute over Lithuania persisted, a new headache for Gorbachev loomed in 
the neighboring Soviet republic of Estonia, where the legislature, now 
dominated by a pro-independence faction, convened Thursday in a session 
expected to vote on suspending the Soviet constitution. 
</P>
<P>
According to Estonian Communist Party officials, the 105-seat chamber will 
likely declare only Estonia's laws valid on the republic's territory, but not 
issue a proclamation of independence as Lithuanian lawmakers did. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not a matter of proclaiming an independent Estonian republic; it is 
aimed at showing that we are apart from the Soviet Union," Henry Soove, a 
senior party official, told the Reuters news agency in the Estonian capital of 
Tallinn. 
</P>
<P>
The Estonians will also debate a declaration of support for Lithuania. Estonian 
leaders have been aghast at Moscow's military pressure on their neighbor.

BABY ORPHANED BY QUAKE GOES TO COUSINS; 
</P>
<P>
CUSTODY: A JUDGE REJECTS REQUESTS OF 2 FEUDING GRANDPARENTS OF BOY, WHO COULD 
BE AWARDED MILLIONS IN POTENTIAL DAMAGE SUITS.

In a case that has become a cause celebre in the Bay Area, a judge Thursday 
rejected custody claims by two rival grandparents involving a 10-month-old boy 
orphaned by the Oct. 17 earthquake and awarded temporary custody of the baby to 
his cousins. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-age parents of James Henry (Jimmy) Brown IV were killed in the 
collapse of a section of Interstate 880 in the Loma Prieta earthquake. Lawyers 
in the case have noted that the boy's guardian may oversee several million 
dollars that could be awarded the boy in a potential lawsuit against the state, 
which built the two-tier freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The boy's paternal grandfather and maternal grandmother each claimed the other 
is unfit for custody. Each claimed the other was only interested in plundering 
the baby's potential future fortune, as well as $100,000 he already has been 
awarded by the state. 
</P>
<P>
The grandfather is a convicted felon; the grandmother is on welfare and 
currently has four children at home that she cares for. 
</P>
<P>
Alameda County Superior Court Judge Roderic Duncan agreed Thursday with a 
report by county family services officials who recommended that neither 
grandparent, both of whom are county residents, be granted custody. 
</P>
<P>
In line with the officials' recommendation, Duncan named the baby's cousins, 
Arthur and Tonia Lewis, as his temporary guardians until an April 17 hearing to 
determine permanent custody. The cousins live in the small Central Valley town 
of Chowchilla. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy's court-appointed attorney, Simone Campbell, agreed with the decision. 
Noting that the child had been shuttled back and forth between the warring 
grandparents, Campbell said, "It's my concern that the child get out of the 
tension-filled environment where he is now." 
</P>
<P>
As the feud developed between the boy's grandparents -- Anita Williams, 35, and 
James Brown II, 37 -- the Lewises came forward and expressed their interest in 
obtaining custody of the child. 
</P>
<P>
Neither grandparent seemed pleased with the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Williams burst into tears when she heard the decision and had to be helped from 
the courtroom. "They're taking Jimmy away," she sobbed. 
</P>
<P>
Her attorney, Don Foley, indicated afterward that Williams was not close to her 
niece, Tonia Lewis. He said the couple had not met Jimmy until his parents' 
funeral. 
</P>
<P>
"This (decision) effectively denies the Brown family reasonable access," said 
John Burris, an attorney for James Brown II. "It terminates the rights of both 
families. They just can't get to Chowchilla." 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy's parents, who were unmarried, were James Brown III, 19, and Michelle 
Marie Richard, 18. They were killed when the Loma Prieta earthquake brought 
down West Oakland's Cypress structure on top of their car. Jimmy was riding in 
another car with James Brown II that was not damaged. 
</P>
<P>
The custody battle between the grandparents developed shortly after the state 
last year passed legislation entitling children whose parents died in the 
freeway collapse to payments of $50,000 for each parent. California auditors 
found that two separate claims for the money had been filed in Jimmy's behalf, 
one by each of the grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Duncan ruled that Public Guardian, a county agency, would 
oversee the $100,000 state payment until Jimmy's 18th birthday.

SENATE KILLS OBSTACLE TO CLEAN AIR BILL PASSAGE; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS: BYRD'S COSTLY PLAN TO AID COAL MINERS IS DEFEATED ON 50-49 VOTE AFTER 
FIERCE WHITE HOUSE LOBBYING. IT WOULD HAVE BROUGHT A BUSH VETO.

<P>
Heeding threats of a White House veto, the Senate Thursday narrowly rejected a 
proposal to grant special benefits to coal miners who lose their jobs as a 
result of new clean air legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The $500-million assistance package sponsored by Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W. Va.) 
was voted down 50 to 49. Both the White House and the Senate leadership had 
lobbied fiercely to defeat the proposal. They described it as a "deal busting" 
amendment that could have doomed the chances of passing a clean air bill this 
year, the 20th anniversary of Earth Day. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the clean air legislation, which represents a comprehensive but 
fragile compromise negotiated by Senate leaders and the White House last month, 
said that defeat of the Byrd amendment eliminates the last major hurdle to 
Senate passage of the bill. It will be the first major revision of the 1970 
Clean Air Act in 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all going to be down hill from here. Finally, we're going to get a bill, 
and it's a bill with which we can be very pleased," Sen. Alan K. Simpson 
(R-Wyo.), the minority whip, said after the vote. 
</P>
<P>
In separate action late Thursday, the Senate agreed by a voice vote to an 
amendment that would require the use, by 1993, of a cleaner blend of gasoline 
in automobiles in the nine cities with the worst smog problems, including Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In the House, the Energy and Commerce Committee beefed up a provision in its 
clean air legislation with a similar requirement. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate had earlier agreed to end weeks of often bitter and sometimes 
impassioned debate by scheduling a final vote on the new clean air bill for 
next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Although dozens of amendments are still pending, none are likely to challenge 
the battered but so far impregnable White House-Senate compromise. 
</P>
<P>
It withstood repeated assaults last week as Senate Majority Leader George J. 
Mitchell (D-Me.) and Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) turned back attempts by 
both environmentalists and pro-business senators to alter the compromise with 
various amendments. 
</P>
<P>
But it faced what was by far its toughest test on Thursday, when the Byrd 
amendment finally came up for a vote after days of intense negotiations, heavy 
lobbying and passionate speech-making by Byrd on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
"It was political hardball all the way," one Senate staff member said. "Never 
has there been a vote on this bill where senators were lobbied so hard, or 
where their allegiances were so torn." 
</P>
<P>
The Administration strongly opposed the Byrd amendment on cost grounds, and 
Republican sources said that President Bush personally spoke by telephone with 
nine senators shortly before the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), a key swing vote, was summoned from the 
floor during the roll call by a phone call from White House Chief of Staff John 
H. Sununu, who persuaded him to switch sides at the last minute and vote 
against Byrd. 
</P>
<P>
Biden said he did so only because Sununu had told him that there would be no 
clean air bill this year if Byrd's amendment was passed. "I asked him point 
blank if Bush would veto the bill. He guaranteed me the President was going to 
veto it," Biden said. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Steve Symms (R-Ida.), the Senate's staunchest opponent of the clean air 
compromise, initially voted for the amendment but then, emerging with a grim 
face from a lengthy huddle with Simpson and other Republican leaders, switched 
his vote to oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
Symms would not comment on his change of heart, but Simpson said the senator's 
Republican colleagues had "laid it on the line with him."

<P>
Sen. Spark M. Matsunaga (D-Hawaii), bedridden with prostate cancer, came to the 
Senate floor in a wheelchair to cast his vote in favor of Byrd's amendment. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, 38 of the Senate's 55 Democrats and 11 of its 45 Republicans sided 
with Byrd. Dole delivered 34 Republicans to defeat the amendment, but Mitchell, 
in what many senators regarded as the toughest test of his leadership to date, 
was able to hold only 16 Democrats in line. 
</P>
<P>
It was enough, but it might not have been if the flight that was supposed to 
bring Sen. J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.) back to Washington in time for the vote 
had not been delayed by bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
Byrd's amendment would have provided up to three years of unemployment and job 
retraining benefits to the estimated 3,000 to 5,000 coal miners who are 
expected to lose their jobs as a result of the clean air bill's proposed 
controls on acid rain. West Virginia produces high-sulfur coal. 
</P>
<P>
It would also have provided up to one year of more limited benefits to other 
workers who lose their jobs as a result of the legislation's impact on 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, Dole and other opponents of the amendment argued that it would cost 
too much to implement and would discriminate against other workers who might 
also lose their jobs but would not receive compensation similar to the "super 
benefits" that Byrd was proposing for coal miners in his native West Virgina 
and other coal-mining states. 
</P>
<P>
"A lost job is a lost job," Dole said. "What happens if someone is laid off at 
J. C. Penney because the coal miners" have been laid off? 
</P>
<P>
Byrd noted that the Administration was seeking $500 million in urgent 
assistance for Panama and $300 million for Nicaragua. "That money will be spent 
in Panama . . . but what are we willing to spend here, for the workers who 
sweat and bleed to make this country great?" he asked.

LOST PLUTONIUM COULD BUILD 7 BOMBS, U.S. SAYS

Enough plutonium to build seven nuclear bombs has escaped into the air ducts of 
the federal government's Rocky Flats nuclear weapons facility here over the 
last 38 years, federal officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The 62 pounds of plutonium is spread throughout 6,000 feet of air ducts and 
"does not pose a health risk to workers at the plant or to public health," said 
Pat Etchart, a spokesman for the Department of Energy. 
</P>
<P>
Etchart said Thursday that the plutonium in the ducts is less than might be 
expected after 30 years of operations at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
But critics of the troubled plant, which was raided in June by FBI agents 
investigating possible environmental crimes, said the discovery raises even 
more serious questions about the plant's operation. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very serious when you consider that people in the nuclear weapons 
business are concerned when grams of this stuff turn up missing," said Jim 
Werner, a spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council. "It also raises 
serious questions about the accountability of the people in control." 
</P>
<P>
The discovery contrasted sharply with an earlier estimate that from 10 to 33 
pounds of plutonium had escaped into the ducts from "glove boxes" used to 
shield plant workers handling radioactive material. 
</P>
<P>
The lower estimate was made by a special team of investigators formed after the 
FBI raid, which determined that workers had for years unclogged "prefilters" in 
the glove boxes by punching holes in them with screwdrivers, federal officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Plutonium operations at the plant, which makes triggers for hydrogen bombs, 
were halted in November until a contractor in charge of the facility can ensure 
that safety concerns are met. The plutonium operations are expected to be 
resumed this summer, federal officials said.

ISRAELI POLITICS ERUPTS INTO RELIGIOUS-SECULAR CONFLICT;

CULTURE CLASH: THE DEBATE ECLIPSES THE STRUGGLE OVER PEACE TALKS WITH THE 
PALESTINIANS.

<P>
In the midst of hard bargaining over who will lead Israel's next government, a 
passionate and resentful debate has erupted over remarks by a prominent rabbi 
disparaging secular Jewish culture. 
</P>
<P>
The venom has exposed a persistent undercurrent of culture clash in Israeli 
life, a struggle between those Orthodox Jews who strictly follow scriptural 
doctrine and Zionists, who have traditionally made secular concerns primary. 
</P>
<P>
So harsh was the outbreak of ill will that it has eclipsed the issue that 
caused the collapse of the country's coalition government: peace with 
Palestinians. In the past few days, little has been heard of such pressing 
details as plans to attend peace conferences, possible agendas and negotiating 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, arguments rage over such questions as whether Jewish life has been 
strengthened by the Zionist-led founding of the state or whether other-worldly 
religious thinking made possible the slaughter of Jews at the hands of the 
Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an ugly scene," observed Jewish philosopher David Hartman. "It's a 
competition for the soul of Jewry." 
</P>
<P>
At heart in the debate are conflicting interpretations of Jewish history and 
the role of modern Israel in it. The argument pits ultra-Orthodox leaders, who 
find full identity within the bounds of the Bible, against secular Jews who 
hold an expanded view of Jewishness to include modern nationhood. 
</P>
<P>
Such a debate might seem to be academic given the minority status of the 
ultra-Orthodox in Israeli politics; their parties in the Knesset, or 
Parliament, hold about 10% of the seats. 
</P>
<P>
But the open structure of Israeli politics and the inability of Israel's major 
parties, Labor and Likud, to control a parliamentary majority has provided the 
ultra-Orthodox parties the balance of power. In the current deadlock over 
coalition-building, the ultra-Orthodox hold the key to who will be Israel's 
next prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
The rancor between the Zionists and the ultra-Orthodox exploded after a speech 
Monday by Rabbi Eliezer Schach, the elderly spiritual leader of two 
ultra-Orthodox parties in the Knesset, Shas (Sephardi Torah Guardians) and 
Degel Hatorah (Flag of the Torah). 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the rabbi was expected to throw his weight behind either Labor's 
Shimon Peres, or Likud's Yitzhak Shamir, the caretaker prime minister, in their 
battle for power. 
</P>
<P>
His speech was much anticipated and his followers filled a 10,000-seat 
basketball arena in Tel Aviv to cheer him on. They greeted him as "king." 
</P>
<P>
Schach refused to back Peres and appeared to provide a boost for Shamir, 
although he never mentioned either name, but current events seemed not to be 
the main focus of the speech. Instead, the nature of Jewish life and history 
were at issue. 
</P>
<P>
"What is the secret of Jewish survival?" Schach asked. "The secret is belief in 
God and keeping the Commandments." 
</P>
<P>
He continued: "The nation of Israel in diaspora after diaspora, through 
destruction, fire and killing, with other nations standing opposite us trying 
to destroy us -- yet with empty hands, it was possible to stand and we were 
victorious. 
</P>
<P>
"What is the miracle? I am a Jew and I am stronger then they. They will kill me 
but my sons will remain alive." 
</P>
<P>
Schach went on to accuse secular Jews of falling away from the faith and by 
implication, undermining Jewish strength. He singled out for special censure 
the kibbutzim or communal farms, an institution that is much identified with 
the creation of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"The kibbutz members who don't know about Yom Kippur and the Sabbath and ritual 
baths and who eat rabbits and pigs, do they have any connection with their 
fathers? What kind of a Jew is that?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
The rabbi, who identifies with a Jewish tradition known broadly as the 
"Lithuanian" because of its East European origins, spoke with confidence that 
the secular origins of the Israeli state are being swept aside by new religious 
fervor. 
</P>
<P>
Schach's comments shocked secular politicians across the political spectrum, 
prompting them for the moment to forget their rivalries. Being Zionists, the 
politicians were offended by Schach's apparent downgrading of Israeli 
nationalism's contribution to Jewish survival. 
</P>
<P>
The attack on the kibbutz movement was widely viewed as a general attack on 
secular life, and much offense was taken because of the role that kibbutz 
farmers have played in defending Israel in wartime. Strictly Orthodox males 
usually do not serve in the army. 
</P>
<P>
Rivalry between the ultra-Orthodox and Zionists stems in part from Zionist 
belief that the Judaism of strict Orthodoxy, with its emphasis on Talmudic 
scholarship and preference of an enclosed society, must be abandoned to a more 
open, muscular and forward-looking Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
When Israel was founded, it was expected that the black-clad, 
"Fiddler-on-the-Roof" style of Jewish life represented by the ultra-Orthodox 
would disappear. In its place would arise a New Jewish Man: hoe in one hand, 
rifle in the other, no longer with his nose in the Scriptures or confined to a 
crowded ghetto. No more 17th-Century clothing, knee stockings, unkempt 
side-locks and fur hats. 
</P>
<P>
Ultra-Orthodox followers viewed the Zionist approach as nearly heretical. The 
Zionists were abandoning the true power of the Torah, forgetting tradition, and 
blending into non-Jewish culture, they believe. The foundation of the state 
itself was an assimilationist move, in the strict Orthodox view, since it 
copied a non-Jewish model. 
</P>
<P>
Judaism transcends statehood, which in any case is supposed to be the construct 
of the Messiah, not of men, according to these believers; the state will come 
when the rule of the Torah is accepted by all. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the clear division between the ultra-Orthodox and the Zionists, both 
Labor and Likud, each of them Zionist parties, are continuing efforts to woo 
the religious parties. The goal is to break a deadlock in Parliament and give 
one or the other a ruling majority.

Prime Minister Bob Hawke won the March 24 election, becoming Australia's first 
Labor Party leader to win four consecutive terms. His opponent, Liberal Party 
leader Andrew Peacock, conceded defeat in the close election. Final results 
were still pending, but preliminary results gave Labor 77 seats in the 148-seat 
House of Representatives.

Cuba's official Communist Party newspaper Granma said Thursday that Lithuania's

Soviet socialism.

"Enough weeks have gone by to be able to judge without fear of making a mistake 
what is really happening in Lithuania," wrote Granma's Moscow correspondent

Special KGB guards who protect Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other 
top leaders have stopped would-be assassins who tried to enter government 
buildings with sawed-off shotguns and knives, according to a report Thursday in 
the Communist Party daily Pravda. 
</P>
<P>
"Every month our men in the Kremlin, on Red Square and other places expose and 
detain about a dozen people with criminal intentions," a KGB general, Yuri S. 
Plekhanov, told Pravda. 
</P>
<P>
Even with glasnost, Gorbachev's policy of greater openness, officials 
previously had not discussed attempted attacks on top leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Plekhanov said guards for top leaders have not had to use weapons since World 
War II. Recently, he said, a man in the reception room of the Communist Party 
Central Committee pulled a shotgun but was disarmed.

DIOCESE SAYS NUNS SOLD CONVENT AND BOUGHT CARS, RACEHORSES

Twin tales of mercenary nuns, involving racehorses, luxury cars and pink 
bathrooms, were described Thursday by a Roman Catholic Church spokesman as 
"something right out of 'Dallas' or 'Dynasty.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Bruges Diocese was rocked this month by two bizarre episodes: The 
conversion of a convent into a luxury hotel by a defrocked nun and the sale of 
another convent by eight nuns who fled in a limousine to the south of France. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a TV show," said a diocese spokesman, "something right out of 
'Dallas' or 'Dynasty.' " 
</P>
<P>
One episode involves eight members of the Order of the Poor Clares, aged 62 to 
93, who sold their convent in Bruges -- without the Pope's permission -- for 
$1.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
They promptly bought a castle in the French Pyrenees, a farm, 11 racehorses and 
six luxury cars. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities this week charged a former financial adviser to the nuns, Ronny 
Crab, 35, with swindling the sisters through abuse of trust to gain control of 
their financial affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 20 miles from Bruges, a former nun is converting part of the 
Arme Klaren convent in Nieuwpoort into a hotel, complete with pink bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Logghe, 49, was dismissed by the bishop two years ago for a lifestyle 
"not in accordance with the church," including fancy clothes and a penchant for 
smoking cigars and driving fast cars.

Members of the National Business Leadership Conference on AIDS, like President 
Bush, called Thursday for an end to the stigma that surrounds the disease, 
although some castigated the Administration for not spending more to fight it. 
</P>
<P>
"As business leaders, we must make it clear that we expect more of the 
government than mere words," said Robert D. Haas, chairman and chief executive 
of Levi Strauss &amp; Co., in a sharply worded speech that preceded the 
President's. "Even if the private sector helps create 'a thousand points of 
light' across the land, it will be of no avail if there is darkness in the 
White House." 
</P>
<P>
Haas called on the federal government to enact a number of initiatives, 
including a disaster relief plan for the 13 hardest hit metropolitan areas. The 
$600-million bill was introduced earlier this month by Sens. Edward M. Kennedy 
(D-Mass.) and Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah). 
</P>
<P>
The Bush White House has asked Congress for almost $3.5 billion for AIDS -- 
which includes Medicaid spending. Not including Medicaid, the figure is $1.6 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Haas argued that such cities as Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and his own 
city, San Francisco, "need emergency help that parallels the aid we provide to 
communities in the aftermath of earthquakes, hurricanes and floods." 
</P>
<P>
He charged that the President's decision to concentrate the resources of his 
war on drugs on law enforcement -- rather than on prevention and treatment of 
drug abuse -- "represents nothing less than a death sentence" for many 
needle-using addicts and their sex partners and children. AIDS is spread by the 
use of contaminated needles. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 500 business and labor leaders and AIDS workers attended a daylong 
session of the leadership conference. 
</P>
<P>
Time Warner Inc. Co-Chairman J. Richard Munro noted that most corporations are 
relative newcomers in the fight against AIDS. Five years ago, he said, Fortune 
magazine surveyed top corporate executives and responses "ranged from casual to 
callous." 
</P>
<P>
Even three years ago, he said, "nobody would have shown up here." 
</P>
<P>
Leaders from the epicenters of the epidemic shared their expertise with others 
who are still bracing for their first cases. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Dr. James W. Curran of the federal Centers for Disease Control told the 
gathering that epidemiologists are currently witnessing "the ruralization of 
AIDS" as more and more cases are diagnosed in small towns and cities. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had no AIDS cases among employees, but it is just a matter of time," 
said Dr. Stephen Goldman, corporate medical director of Mack Trucks Inc. in 
Allentown, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Munro said: "We began to lose talented, wonderful people at Time 
very early in the epidemic." 
</P>
<P>
He said that policies to keep infected workers on the job and reimburse sick 
employees for alternatives to hospital care are both humane and "in your 
business interest." 
</P>
<P>
AIDS, according to the CDC, has stricken 125,000 U.S. citizens and killed 
75,000. 
</P>
<P>
Although the agency recently lowered its estimate of the number of infected 
Americans, CDC still forecasts that the cumulative total of AIDS cases will at 
least triple, to between 390,000 and 480,000, by the end of 1993.

The rocket that launched a $157-million communications satellite but failed to 
put it in the proper orbit burned up harmlessly in the atmosphere or fell into 
the ocean, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Titan 3 booster came down on Wednesday morning at about the time the U.S. 
Space Command had predicted, Army Maj. Thomas Niemann said. 
</P>
<P>
The uninsured Intelsat 6 satellite, launched by the rocket on March 14, is 
about 300 miles above Earth, a temporary position thousands of miles lower than 
it is supposed to be. 
</P>
<P>
The satellite wound up in a uselessly low orbit after failing to separate 
properly from the second stage of the booster. Engineers managed to separate 
the satellite via computer commands, then sent it into a higher orbit. 
</P>
<P>
The second stage of the booster remained trapped in an orbit that swung within 
about 100 miles of Earth and was pulled down by gravity.

Technicians on Thursday loaded the $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope aboard 
the shuttle Discovery in a major step toward putting the most expensive 
civilian satellite ever built into orbit in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The delicate six-hour procedure began two days late because of work to capture 
or kill dozens of tiny "midges" -- small flies that look like tiny mosquitoes 
-- that infiltrated the telescope's ultra-clean launching pad storage room 
earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers concerned about the remote possibility of contamination did not 
remove two giant plastic bags protecting the telescope until after the bugs 
were eradicated. 
</P>
<P>
Technicians planned to work overnight Thursday hooking up electrical cables 
before conducting a test to make sure that power and computer commands can 
travel to and from the telescope.

<P>
The telescope was taken to launching pad 39B on Sunday, a day ahead of 
schedule, and, despite the delay in installation, NASA officials said Discovery 
and its four-man, one-woman crew remained on track for liftoff around April 12. 
</P>
<P>
Because preparations for the launching have proceeded so smoothly, the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration is leaning toward moving the flight ahead 
two days, to April 10. But sources said the agency may stick to the original 
date because of "political" considerations, including logistics for VIPs and 
appearances by top NASA officials before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
An official launching date will be announced Saturday at the end of a two-day 
flight readiness review. 
</P>
<P>
The Hubble Space Telescope, operating 380 miles above Earth's atmosphere, is 
expected to revolutionize optical astronomy, allowing scientists to see farther 
into the universe than ever before and with 10 times the clarity of 
ground-based instruments.

EMPLOYERS JOIN CHORUS OF IMMIGRATION LAW'S CRITICS; 
</P>
<P>
DOCUMENTS: AN UNCOMMON ALLIANCE OF BUSINESS LEADERS AND CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS 
ARE CALLING FOR AN END TO SANCTIONS FOR HIRING ILLEGAL ALIENS.

Ed Bell thought he followed all the rules. 
</P>
<P>
He told the workers in his packaging factory, most of whom are Latino, to get 
their papers in order to show they were entitled to hold jobs in this country. 
He helped some employees pay for their amnesty applications. And, he filled out 
pages and pages of government-issued forms. 
</P>
<P>
All this to comply, Bell says, with landmark immigration legislation that makes 
it a crime to hire illegal or undocumented immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
But Bell's steps weren't quite enough in the eyes of the law, and now he is 
locked in a tedious legal tangle with the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization 
Service. His American McNair firm, located in the city of Orange, is one of 214 
businesses, companies and individuals in Los Angeles, Orange and surrounding 
counties that have been accused by the INS of violations ranging from knowingly 
employing illegal aliens to incorrectly filling out the paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nobody illegal here," an exasperated Bell said, motioning with a sweep 
of his arms toward the factory workshop. "Why are they hassling me?" 
</P>
<P>
The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act opened the way for hundreds of 
thousands of immigrants to apply for amnesty. But it also established 
sanctions, such as fines and jail time, against employers who give work to 
illegal immigrants. Under the law, a boss must ask for any of a number of 
permits or identification documents from a new employee to establish that 
employee's right to work in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Immigrant rights advocates have long blamed the employer sanctions provision of 
the law for causing discrimination in the workplace. Rather than risk violating 
the law's complicated requirements, employers often avoid hiring anyone who 
looks or sounds foreign, even though the applicant is, in fact, entitled to 
work in the United States, several recent studies have shown. 
</P>
<P>
Now, employers too are joining the chorus of critics, giving birth to an 
uncommon alliance of business leaders and civil rights activists who are 
calling for an end to the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
The INS defends the sanctions, saying they are working well in discouraging the 
illegal flow of immigrants into the United States by making it harder for them 
to obtain jobs. 
</P>
<P>
But many employers complain they are caught between the threat of 
discrimination lawsuits on one side if they dismiss or refuse to hire a worker 
suspected of being an illegal immigrant, and, on the other side, the threat of 
stiff penalties if they hire immigrants who turn out to be illegal. 
</P>
<P>
"Employers get stuck between a rock and hard place," said Jill Scheldrup, an 
employee relations manager with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington. 
"They are damned if they hire and damned if they fire." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Chamber were meeting this week with lawyers from the American 
Civil Liberties Union to devise a common strategy to fight sanctions, Scheldrup 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of sanctions hope to use a report issued Thursday by the General 
Accounting Office to buttress their efforts to have the law repealed. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO found that penalties against employers who hire illegal aliens resulted 
in "widespread discrimination" against legal American residents. The report 
also found that discrimination related to the law "is serious but not 
pervasive." 
</P>
<P>
Bias might be reduced, the GAO said, if employers were given more information 
about the law's requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The INS maintains the rules are much easier to follow than some employers would 
suggest. As evidence, they point to a high compliance rate: In a seven-county 
area that includes Los Angeles, approximately 72% of employers whose firms or 
businesses have been inspected by immigration agents are complying with the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
"Fines are basically a last resort," INS spokeswoman Carol Bara said. "A lot of 
steps are involved" before a fine is levied -- including educational visits by 
INS agents to the workplace and an inspection of an employer's personnel files 
with time given to correct any errors that are detected. 
</P>
<P>
Between the end of 1987, when the sanctions went into effect, and last month, 
the INS made 584,853 educational visits to employers in California, Arizona, 
Nevada, Hawaii and Guam, Bara said. 
</P>
<P>
The INS has also supplied employers with a handbook that outlines their 
responsibilities, as well as workers' rights, and a toll-free telephone number 
was set up for employers who have questions, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Within reason, employers do not have to verify the authenticity of the 
documents that a worker offers as proof, and all sides concede that expertly 
executed counterfeit identification cards have flooded the market since the 
immigration law went into effect. But the task is complicated by a myriad of 
documents that are legitimate and acceptable, including no fewer than 17 
versions of the so-called "green card," or alien work permit. 
</P>
<P>
Fines can range from $100 for a minor paperwork infraction to over $10,000 for 
repeatedly hiring an illegal alien. But in numerous cases, the fines are 
relatively small and, consequently, many employers are more willing to pay the 
money than take on an expensive legal battle. 
</P>
<P>
But on a rare occasion, an employer, like Bell, will fight back. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are dispassionate about it, you pay," said the 50-year-old businessman. 
"But it brands you as a person who hires illegals. It puts you on a 'bad' list. 
And that's a place you don't want to be." 
</P>
<P>
Bell's company designs and makes specialized packaging for delicate electronics 
or other sensitive equipment. It operates out of a red-brick building that sits 
only yards from the main railroad track that runs from San Diego to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Bell's troubles began in the spring of 1988. The grace period that the INS had 
given before agents were to begin enforcing the sanctions was ending. He called 
his estimated 50 employees together to inform them that anyone hired after Nov. 
6, 1986, had to be able to prove he or she was entitled to work in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 of Bell's employees are Latino, and most had already applied for 
amnesty, he said. As a participant in the amnesty program, a non-U.S. citizen 
is entitled to work here. 
</P>
<P>
Two employees were not eligible for amnesty but hired a lawyer in an effort to 
obtain a special labor certification permit, Bell said. This permit is issued 
when an employer can demonstrate that the work performed by the employee 
requires special skills, and the employer can show that no other legal workers 
are available to perform the same task. 
</P>
<P>
The application for the two men was approved by the Labor Department and 
submitted to the INS, Bell said. What Bell says he did not know was that a 
worker awaiting this form of authorization must do the waiting in his or her 
home country. 
</P>
<P>
So on April 24 of last year, INS agents swept into Bell's factory, slapped 
handcuffs on one of the men and carted him away, Bell said. Bell was hit with a 
$1,000 fine for knowingly continuing to employ an illegal alien. 
</P>
<P>
The second man quickly slipped back to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
INS attorneys, while declining to discuss the case in detail, said Bell clearly 
should have known the man awaiting the labor authorization did not have 
permission to work in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bell was hit with three more fines, totaling $600, for what he 
characterizes as paperwork violations. After the INS paid its education visit 
to Bell's factory in March of last year, he gathered up his employees' 
documents and, with his wife, Angeline, filled out registration forms for each 
worker hired after Nov. 6, 1986. But inspectors found problems with three 
forms. 
</P>
<P>
Bell refused to settle, and the federal government is now taking him to court. 
He is scheduled to go on trial before an administrative judge May 1. 
</P>
<P>
It is highly unusual for these cases to reach that level: Only three trials 
were held last year in the seven-county Los Angeles District, an INS spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a matter of principle," Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
Though the INS says the immigration law is not difficult to obey, those who 
counsel employers say many bosses remain confused and intimidated by the legal 
procedures and the paperwork. Even those who are fined sometimes don't 
understand what they did wrong, say these observers. 
</P>
<P>
"The questions I was getting from employers the last five months were not any 
different from the questions I heard at the start" of the sanctions, said Nancy 
Cowen, staff attorney for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational 
Fund, who held more than 40 immigration-law workshops for employers during the 
last 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
Some companies go overboard, supplying too much evidence that employees are 
eligible to work. One medical firm even turned in its nurses' licenses, Cowen 
said. A landscaping firm in Sacramento, after being questioned by INS agents 
repeatedly regarding its Latino employees, decided not to hire any more 
Latinos, Cowen said. 
</P>
<P>
The INS employers' handbook contains samples of many -- but not all -- 
documents that legitimately entitle a person to work. Job-seekers who present 
documents not contained in the handbook, such as work-authorization papers for 
political refugee applicants, are often turned away unjustly, Cowen said. 
</P>
<P>
"Many employers are unsure, so they are erring on the side of conservatism," 
said J. Fong, legal director of the Asian Pacific American Legal Center. "They 
will simply not employ (an applicant) if they have any doubts at all" about the 
applicant's eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
Josie Gonzalez, an attorney who chairs the national employer-sanctions 
committee of the American Immigration Lawyers Assn., said employers find it 
costly and cumbersome to comply with the law. It puts a burden on employers 
that many advocates say best belongs left on immigration agents. 
</P>
<P>
Scheldrup, the Chamber of Commerce executive, said: "Employers should not be 
policemen."

ETHNIC SOMALIS CHAFE UNDER OFFICIAL SCRUTINY IN KENYA; 
</P>
<P>
EAST AFRICA: A FLOOD OF REFUGEES AND ARMED MARAUDERS FROM ACROSS THE BORDER 
PROMPTS NAIROBI TO CHECK FOR CITIZENSHIP.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was not very long ago that members of this country's sizable ethnic Somali 
community believed that years of discrimination and harassment by the black 
African majority had come to an end. 
</P>
<P>
"Things were better than (at) any time in memory," said one prominent Somali 
here. 
</P>
<P>
No more. Angered by a flood of refugees and a surge of armed attacks by 
marauders from across its long border with Somalia, the Kenyan government has 
lately subjected its ethnic Somalis to an unprecedented "screening" exercise in 
which they are required to prove their Kenyan citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
The exercise has created a political uproar here. Kenyan Somalis say they are 
victims of petty harassment that is as bad as it has ever been. 
</P>
<P>
The issue has split the Somali community. The screening has been supervised by 
prominent Kenyan Somali politicians and bureaucrats, leading some to suggest 
that they are intent on deporting members of opposition tribes or clans to 
promote their own. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the exercise comes at a time of unprecedented misery for Somalis in 
general. A heightening civil war in Somalia has sent thousands of people across 
the borders of that stricken country into Kenya and Djibouti. Human rights 
groups have charged both countries with mistreating the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
One group, Africa Watch, charged that in September, the Kenyan authorities 
returned 60 Somali refugees to their own country at gunpoint. The report 
contends that 18 of the refugees were executed by Somali soldiers and 42 
imprisoned. 
</P>
<P>
Originally expected to last three weeks, or until the end of December, the 
screening process was extended until April. Under the rules, all ethnic Somalis 
over 18 are required to bring their national identity cards, passports and 
birth certificates for verification by panels of Somali elders at any of 51 
"screening centers." Those who pass muster are issued a pink identification 
card that must be produced on demand. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyan authorities say 71 people "suspected to be citizens of Somalia" have 
been arrested, and sources in the government and the Somali community here say 
as many as 500 allegedly illegal aliens have been deported to Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
Among those deported were leading Nairobi businessmen, a former official of the 
ruling party, the Kenya African National Union, even a former member of 
Parliament. Some held official citizenship or residence documents that were 
summarily declared to be forgeries. 
</P>
<P>
None of these deportations were preceded by due process, as provided for in the 
Kenyan constitution. 
</P>
<P>
"In our country, a person is innocent until proven guilty," says Mohammed 
Ibrahim, a Kenyan Somali lawyer. "Nobody has been prosecuted or charged in a 
court of law. So on the facts we have, the Kenya government has deported 500 of 
its own citizens." 
</P>
<P>
Others who have registered protests include the Kenya section of the 
International Commission of Jurists and the Law Society of Kenya. Among ethnic 
Somalis who initially refused to submit to the screening was Ahmed Khalif, a 
former member of Parliament and head of the Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims. 
In response, the council stripped him of his post. 
</P>
<P>
Kenya has long seen itself as a multi-ethnic, multiracial community, but the 
authorities seem to have always made an exception for ethnic Somalis. Thousands 
of these people are second- and third-generation Kenyans with Kenyan 
citizenship and passports. 
</P>
<P>
People of Somali background, whose dark olive skin and Caucasian features 
distinguish them physically from African Kenyans, say they are often singled 
out by police on the street. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are Somali-looking, the police will stop you and ask to see your 
documents," says one prominent businessman who resides legally in Kenya as a 
political refugee. "It happens as often as you come across a policeman -- at 
least one or two times a week." 
</P>
<P>
The distaste of Kenyan authorities for ethnic Somalis goes back to the eve of 
independence in 1963. In 1961, the British attached part of the former Italian 
Somaliland to its Kenya colony; it became part of Kenya upon independence in 
1963. 
</P>
<P>
The Somalis began a war of secession, which lasted until 1967, when the 
government of Somalia withdrew its support. But the state of emergency imposed 
during the unrest has never been lifted. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called North-Eastern province has been troublesome ever since. In recent 
years the waxing and waning of civil war in neighboring Somalia has 
periodically sent tens of thousands of refugees into the region, along with 
hundreds of marauders known as shiftas, or bandits. 
</P>
<P>
As the shiftas graduated from bows and arrows in the '60s and '70s to automatic 
weapons and motorized carriers, security in the region deteriorated. 
Eventually, the shiftas moved into elephant poaching, a crime that the Kenyans 
at one point traced directly to agents of Somali President Mohamed Siad Barre. 
</P>
<P>
The poaching and a surge in armed attacks on tourists in Kenyan game parks, 
allegedly by Somali bandits, provoked the government to order the screening. So 
many alien Somalis had crossed the border to escape the civil war, the 
government said, that Kenya's Somali population was overrun. The difficulty of 
telling a Kenyan Somali from an alien, it argued, made the screening necessary.

2 STATE CANDIDATES' BALLOT DESIGNATIONS DENIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a blow to two candidacies for statewide office, a Sacramento judge ruled 
Thursday that Democrat Walter Zelman, running for insurance commissioner, and 
Republican Angela Buchanan, running for treasurer, could not refer specifically 
to their former employers in identifying themselves on the June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge James T. Ford decided that Zelman could not use the ballot 
designation, "director, Common Cause" and that Buchanan could not use "retired 
U.S. Treasurer." 
</P>
<P>
Polls have shown that both candidates' support among those surveyed in their 
respective races was materially increased when they were identified with their 
well-known and often well-thought-of former employers. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said it is what a candidate does or has done for a living that 
counts, rather than whom he or she has worked for. He said it clearly would not 
be proper for someone working for IBM to be allowed to use "IBM technician" on 
the ballot, rather than "technician." 
</P>
<P>
The ruling reversed a decade-old policy of the secretary of state's office that 
allowed candidates to list their former jobs by employer, in some instances, if 
they had just left them to run for an office. Under this policy, the secretary 
of state had ruled that Zelman could use his preferred designation because he 
had only recently resigned. But the policy held that Buchanan could not, 
because she had held her post more than a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
The judge struck down both requests. 
</P>
<P>
No other candidates are immediately affected by the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Later Thursday, Zelman said he had notified election officials that he would 
run under the more general designation, "director, consumer's organization." 
Buchanan, meanwhile, settled for "chief financial officer." 
</P>
<P>
Although Thursday was supposedly the deadline for settling on ballot 
designations, another candidate, Republican Tom Skornia, running for insurance 
commissioner, won a court order delaying a decision in his case until an April 
4 hearing. Skornia wants to describe himself as a "legal reform advocate," but 
election officials have balked on grounds that this is a position on the issues 
rather than an occupation.

CITYHOOD VOTE SET FOR JUNE 5 IN MALIBU; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: SUPERVISORS SET DATE BUT WOULD PUT OFF INCORPORATION UNTIL MARCH 28, 
1991. RESIDENTS VOW TO FIGHT DELAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
After more than two years of efforts, Malibu residents who want their coastal 
community to become a city got their wish Thursday to put the matter before 
voters, but it came with a heavy string attached. 
</P>
<P>
Complying with a judge's order, Los Angeles County supervisors set a June 5 
election date but voted to delay the actual incorporation until March 28, 1991, 
if residents vote in favor of cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for cityhood backers vowed to fight the condition put on their 
election. 
</P>
<P>
The delay imposed by the supervisors is designed to give the county time to get 
a sewer system under way that it has long wanted for Malibu before a new city 
council has the chance to block it. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the supervisors) did everything they had to do and a little bit more, 
and that was to get indirectly what they couldn't get directly by continuing to 
stall the election," said Graham Ritchie, a lawyer for cityhood backers. 
</P>
<P>
Those lawyers immediately asked the judge who had ordered setting the election 
to nullify the delay, contending the supervisors did not have the authority to 
impose it. However, Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs refused, saying the 
delay is a "separate matter" that she did not wish to address on an emergency 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
Cityhood backers said they will return to court as soon as possible to 
challenge the legality of delaying the incorporation date. 
</P>
<P>
County officials acknowledged the maneuver is unprecedented in the history of 
Los Angeles County. Ordinarily, once voters approve, incorporation occurs on 
the date results are certified, usually about a month after an election. 
</P>
<P>
Left unchallenged, the delay means that, should Malibu residents approve 
cityhood and select a five-member city council on June 5, the newly elected 
city officials will be without a city to govern for nine months. 
</P>
<P>
As proposed, the 20-square-mile city would stretch from Topanga Canyon to Leo 
Carrillo State Beach along Pacific Coast Highway and nearly one mile inland. It 
would have a population of about 25,000 with about 8,300 registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
Within an hour after the supervisors' vote, at least seven potential candidates 
took out papers to run for City Council. Candidates have until Monday to file 
the papers with the county registrar. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of supervisors have opposed Malibu's becoming a city for years, 
saying the sewer system needs to be under construction before the city is 
formed. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents, fearing that development will spread through the seaside 
community, have opposed the sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
The vote to impose the delay was 4 to 1, with Supervisor Ed Edelman dissenting. 
"We've been over this so many times, and I understand what your positions are, 
but I just think it's time to let go," he told his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Mike Antonovich expressed concern that unless the incorporation is 
delayed, Pepperdine University's expansion plans might be "held hostage" by a 
new local government determined to block the sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
The state Coastal Commission last year approved a long-range development plan 
that would enable the university to double its enrollment to more than 5,000 
students. But the plan depends on the increased sewer capacity the county's 
system will provide, even though the university is outside the proposed city's 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
Other supervisors, including Deane Dana, whose district includes Malibu, cited 
the need for a sewer system for both environmental reasons and to protect the 
county from future liability as a result of landslides that some experts have 
blamed on leaking septic tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, the state Coastal Commission approved a plan that calls for a 
sewer system 25% to 40% smaller than what the county had insisted upon. 
</P>
<P>
But the construction must still be approved by the Coastal Commission, and the 
county must get the approval of several other agencies before the work can 
begin. On Thursday, a county official predicted that "at best" it will be 
April, 1991, before the approvals are obtained and next June before the first 
pipe is laid. 
</P>
<P>
"The road to installing sewers in Malibu has been long and rough, and we expect 
there to be plenty of potholes ahead," said Harry Stone, the county's deputy 
director of Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
State law allows for incorporation to occur up to a year after votes are 
certified. But there is disagreement over whether the supervisors can impose a 
delay or whether that authority rests solely with the Local Agency Formation 
Commission, charged with overseeing the transition of communities to cities. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for cityhood backers insist the supervisors acted illegally. County 
lawyers are just as adamant the supervisors acted within the law.

L.A. SCHOOLS TUNING IN TO POWER-SHARING PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: THE DISTRICT TAKES TO THE AIRWAVES TO EXPLAIN HOW SCHOOLS CAN 
INITIATE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN CURRICULUM, TEACHER HIRING AND OTHER AREAS. 
</P>

The Los Angeles Unified School District took to the airwaves Thursday with a 
live telecast touting the nation's most ambitious experiment in school 
power-sharing, amid complaints by parents that teachers have grabbed the lion's 
share of the power. 
</P>
<P>
The teleconference to explain the district's move into the second phase of 
school restructuring -- which will broaden the influence of the local 
shared-decision-making councils -- drew education experts from around the 
country who are eagerly watching Los Angeles to see if this plan can help 
revive the nation's ailing public education system. 
</P>
<P>
It also attracted a protest from about 50 parents, who marched outside the 
district-operated television station near downtown while the show aired. The 
protesters carried placards complaining that parents have not been given equal 
status on the leadership councils that will ultimately run each school. 
</P>
<P>
The power-sharing councils were formed as part of the settlement of last May's 
nine-day teachers' strike. Each school has elected a council of six to 16 
members, with half the seats held by teachers and the remaining spots divided 
among parents, community members, the school principal and other school 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
The second phase, called School-Based Management, begins Monday. Under it, 
schools can apply to broaden their influence beyond the five limited areas 
covered by the plan thus far, and can initiate fundamental changes in areas 
such as curriculum and teacher hiring and assignment. 
</P>
<P>
So far, most of the changes made by the councils have been rather mundane: 
Lunch and recess schedules have been changed, first-graders allowed to perform 
in the school talent show, teachers granted access to copying machines. 
</P>
<P>
But for the up to 70 schools that will be chosen to move into the School-Based 
Management phase next fall, the chance is at hand to make meaningful changes 
that will improve student achievement. 
</P>
<P>
Schools could hold classes into the night and on Saturdays. Grades could be 
eliminated in some classes. Businesses could be invited on campus to teach 
entrepreneurial skills. And the councils could reorganize to include more 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
Each school council will have a chance to devise its own plan to restructure to 
better meet the needs of its students. 
</P>
<P>
Already, parents at many schools are agitating for equal representation with 
teachers on the decision-making councils. Some parents have complained that 
teachers have been more concerned with improving their own working conditions 
than student achievement -- the ultimate aim of the restructuring program. 
</P>
<P>
"The (teachers) union is running the program to their own benefit," said Bea 
Stotzer, PTA president at Kester Avenue Elementary in Van Nuys, who is not a 
member of the school's elected council and has been at odds with the group. 
</P>
<P>
But teachers' union Vice President Helen Bernstein, who helped negotiate the 
shared-decision-making pact, said working conditions must be improved before 
the councils can move on to bigger issues. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way, only the teachers, who have been directly involved with those 
problems, have an interest," she acknowledged. "But first you take care of 
who's monitoring the halls and what times the bells will ring, then you get 
beyond that and get down the real hard issues." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, children were sent home early and principals and teachers -- and a 
sprinkling of parents -- gathered in each school to view the telecast on 
Channel 58 during which the second phase of the power-sharing plan was 
explained. Viewers could phone in questions to a panel of district and union 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those questions were from teachers and many concerned such issues as 
how schools would finance the changes and how the process would affect future 
contract negotiations with the district. 
</P>
<P>
Though the district's shared-decision-making process is already 8 months old, 
many teachers' queries Thursday seemed to reflect a lack of understanding about 
just how it is supposed to be working and skepticism about what it can 
accomplish and whether it has district support. 
</P>
<P>
At Belmont High School, west of downtown, about 200 faculty members, joined by 
a few parents and students, crowded into a large third-floor classroom to watch 
the telecast. 
</P>
<P>
Most listened attentively -- though a few dozed through portions of the 
90-minute telecast and others expressed skepticism at the upbeat presentation 
of the upcoming changes. 
</P>
<P>
Teacher Elizabeth Sawyer, who sits on Belmont's council, said parents, teachers 
and the principal are "really working well together" in the shared 
decision-making process, and parent participation is high, despite the fact 
that three-fourths of Belmont's 4,100 students are foreign-born and 80 
languages resound in its hallways. 
</P>
<P>
At other schools, however, Spanish-speaking parents have complained that -- in 
a district where nearly a third of the students speak little or no English -- 
they have been shut out of the process because meetings and materials are often 
not translated. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's broadcast was only in English, though a repeat of the program 
Thursday night was accompanied by a Spanish radio simulcast. The television 
program will be repeated over the district's station at 3 p.m. Sunday, but only 
in English. 
</P>
<P>
After the broadcast, school board President Jackie Goldberg acknowledged that 
the district has to do more to involve parents in the power-sharing plan. 
</P>
<P>
"It is one of our most difficult challenges," she said. "We have a 
multi-ethnic, multi-linguistic population. But we have to keep trying, we have 
to keep reaching out to these parents, with translators and whatever else it 
takes." 
</P>
<P>
Because schools can only apply to move into the school-based management phase 
if two-thirds of the faculty and a majority of the parents at a school agree, 
it is necessary that parents support the leadership council if the program is 
to succeed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"They won't support something they don't understand. If they don't want it and 
if they don't agree with it, they can stop it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Schools have until April 20 to apply to expand their restructuring program, and 
a central council and district officials will decide by the summer which 
schools can put their new plans in place this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The process is a difficult one -- schools must show that their 
shared-decision-making councils are working well and have the support of the 
school and community. They must explain the rationale behind the changes they 
propose and how they will improve student achievement. And they must devise 
ways to measure that achievement. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those changes may run counter to district policy or even violate 
teachers' contracts, but waivers could be granted by the central council or 
school board. 
</P>
<P>
Because the step is such a drastic one, officials estimate that not many of the 
district's schools will be ready to move forward this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we'll have too many applications this year," Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, as a part of its settlement of a teachers strike, the Los Angeles 
Unified School District agreed to give parents, teachers and community leaders 
greater say in how local schools are run. Each school has elected its own 
leadership council and they have been making decisions in areas such as student 
discipline, scheduling and use of school equipment. The ultimate aim of the 
power-sharing plan is to improve student achievement by restructuring schools 
to better meet students' needs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LOS ANGELES' SCHOOL RESTRUCTURING PLAN 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified schools are being restructured to better serve the needs 
of students. This can take many forms and include such steps as redesigning 
curriculum and class schedules, hiring outside consultants to provide special 
courses or establishing ungraded classrooms. In Los Angeles, the restructuring 
plan has two phases: 
</P>
<P>
Phase 1 is shared decision-making, which began last July with the election of 
school councils. Most schools will remain in this phase for several years. It 
allows parents, teachers, staff and community leaders to make decisions in 
specific areas that were formerly the purview of principals and central 
administration. In the Los Angeles district, those decisions are made by 
consensus, with proposals tailored to win everyone's support, rather than by a 
vote of decision-making council members. 
</P>
<P>
Phase 2 is school-based management, under which parents, teachers, principals, 
staff and community representatives can make fundamental changes in virtually 
every area of school operation -- including budget, teacher hiring and 
assignment and curriculum and teaching methods -- with approval of the school 
board. Up to 70 schools can begin the school-based management process this 
fall, once their proposals for change are approved next month.

CABBIES TOLD TO CLEAN UP THEIR ACT ; 
</P>
<P>
TAXI SERVICE: CITY COMMISSION ADOPTS DRESS CODE FOR DRIVERS. PLAID PANTS ARE 
OUT; SOME WILL HAVE TO WEAR TIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Plaid pants, leisure suits, bib overalls and other sartorial horrors were 
banned Thursday in a strict new dress code approved for Los Angeles cabdrivers. 
</P>
<P>
The code, adopted by the city's Transportation Commission, was called for under 
a sweeping taxicab regulation ordinance approved in January by the City 
Council. The ordinance sets up the city's first system of fines for misbehavior 
by cabdrivers, including improper dressing. 
</P>
<P>
The commission on Thursday spelled out a set of basic dress standards for 
cabbies and at the same time approved specific dress codes submitted by each of 
the city's eight taxicab companies and associations. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the companies went beyond the commission's requirement and have 
prescribed outfits for their drivers that fall just short of uniforms. Two of 
the companies told the commission that their drivers will be required to wear 
neckties at all times. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Joel Wachs first proposed dress standards for cabdrivers last 
summer, saying he had received increasing numbers of complaints about their 
appearance and behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs said Thursday he is "very pleased" with the regulations. "I think they 
even went a little beyond what I anticipated," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new minimum standards, which take effect immediately, the wearing of 
jeans, except for designer garments, is "discouraged." 
</P>
<P>
Shirts with tails must be tucked in and no more than two buttons at the neck 
may be unbuttoned. 
</P>
<P>
Shorts, cut-offs and sweat suits are banned and trousers must be of a dark, 
solid color, without bold prints or plaid designs. Skirts must be knee-length 
and also must be solid colors. (Only female cabbies may wear skirts.) 
</P>
<P>
Sandals and open-toed shoes are not allowed. Shoes that can be polished must be 
polished and free of scuff marks. Clothing must be pressed and drivers must be 
"without objectionable odors." 
</P>
<P>
Cabbies caught violating the dress code will be issued warnings for the first 
month, but may be formally cited beginning on May 1, said Ken Cude of the 
city's Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
The drivers also must adhere to guidelines drawn up by their companies and 
approved by the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Drivers for L.A Taxi and United Checker Cab Co. face what appears to be the 
toughest code. Beginning Monday, they must wear black or red neckties bearing 
the company logo at all times while on duty. 
</P>
<P>
"I firmly believe the drivers will be very positive about it," said Gorman 
Gilbert, president of Taxi Systems Inc., which operates both companies. "But 
any time you do something like this, there are going to be some people who 
don't like it." 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert said the mandatory neckties were suggested by the drivers, who approved 
the ties as well as the rest of the company guidelines in a vote recently. 
</P>
<P>
"We understood right from the start that we didn't want to push something on 
the drivers that they didn't want," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Their dress code now includes mandatory white dress shirts with collars, dark 
trousers or skirts, and an optional black or red sweater with a company logo on 
the left side. 
</P>
<P>
City investigators and airport security officers will be given copies of all 
eight company dress codes, Cude said. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators will make periodic checks of the holding areas at airports, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
After the 30-day grace period, violators will be cited and penalty points will 
be charged against their companies, Cude said. Once a company reaches a 
threshold level of penalty points, each dress code violation will cost $1,500, 
he said. "If the companies can't control their drivers, they might suffer," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cude said the companies may pass the fines along to the drivers. 
</P>
<P>
While dress code violations are charged to the companies, the ordinance 
provides for fines against drivers for violations of other provisions of the 
new regulations, such as rudeness, tampering with meters, refusing to take 
passengers or refusing to take them where they want to go. 
</P>
<P>
Drivers face fines of up to $500, and their companies or associations can be 
fined up to $100,000 if they accumulate enough penalty points under a 
disciplinary system that will be administered by the city's Department of 
Transportation.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PATROLS STEPPED UP AROUND DAY LABORERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies have stepped up patrols on San Fernando 
Road in Santa Clarita in response to complaints that day laborers are harassing 
passers-by and their presence is creating traffic problems and disrupting 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
At city officials' request, the deputies late last week began morning foot 
patrols on heavily traveled San Fernando Road near Market Street in Newhall. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 400 day laborers congregate in the area on weekday mornings. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Bob Spierer, who heads the Sheriff's Department station in Santa Clarita, 
said the issue is safety. "We had a number of complaints from merchants and 
residents that cars looking for day laborers were stopping and blocking 
traffic. Some residents said they were being harassed a bit." He said deputies 
are citing the day workers only if they break the law.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FIRED POLICEMAN JAILED IN STALKING, RAPE OF 
GIRL, 11 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fired Beverly Hills police officer allegedly used his training to stalk an 
11-year-old Irvine girl, then posed as a deliveryman to gain entry into her 
home when she was alone and raped her at knife-point, Orange County prosecutors 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Rush McCoy, 36, was jailed in lieu of $250,000 bail on six felony counts 
that include rape, sexual assault and burglary, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
His arraignment is set for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is far more frightening than your average rape," said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Ariadne Symons. "This man obviously stalked the child, chose her for whatever 
reason to be his victim, waited for her to be alone, and planned the crime in 
what he thought would be the most undetectable way." 
</P>
<P>
Police said the girl called 911 after the attack and identified McCoy from a 
photo. Beverly Hills police officials declined to comment on the reasons for 
McCoy's firing in 1978.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BAR FILES NEW CHARGES AGAINST MITCHELSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The State Bar of California filed new disciplinary charges against attorney 
Marvin Mitchelson Thursday -- charges his attorney says are without merit. 
</P>
<P>
James A. Bascue, chief trial counsel of the bar, said in a news release that 
the Century City attorney for five years mishandled his client trust account by 
failing to segregate his personal funds from those of his clients, wrote checks 
based on insufficient funds and failed to keep proper accounting records of 
client funds. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Margolis, Mitchelson's attorney, said the allegations were without merit 
and the release of the complaint violated the State Bar's own rules. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen the allegations, but the press was informed of the specific 
charges," Margolis said. 
</P>
<P>
The latest charges will be added to 13 earlier disciplinary charges handed down 
against Mitchelson by the State Bar.

SUPERVISORS APPROVE MARCH FOR EAST L.A.

The county Board of Supervisors overruled the Sheriff's Department on Thursday 
and granted Chicano activists a permit to march in East Los Angeles this summer 
to commemorate the 20th anniversary of a chaotic anti-war march that ended in 
the death of newsman Ruben Salazar. 
</P>
<P>
Prodded by Supervisor Ed Edelman, the supervisors on a 3-1 vote overturned the 
sheriff's denial of a request for a parade permit by the Los Angeles members of 
the 1990 National Chicano Moratorium Committee for a march Aug. 25 along 
Atlantic and Whittier boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
The request was rejected two months ago by sheriff's officials at the East Los 
Angeles station who said the three-mile march would unduly disrupt traffic and 
business along the proposed route and would cost too much. Overtime pay for 
deputies was estimated at $37,400. 
</P>
<P>
Some merchants on Whittier Boulevard also were fearful of a reoccurrence of 
violence that marred the march on Aug. 29, 1970. More than 200 people were 
arrested, 60 others were injured and three people died in the march's violent 
aftermath. Among the dead was Salazar, then a Times columnist and news director 
at Spanish-language television station KMEX. 
</P>
<P>
Parade organizers were pleased with Thursday's decision, saying that concerns 
about violence were overblown. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a smoke-screen excuse to deny us our rights," said Carlos Montes, 
co-chairman of the committee organizing the parade. 
</P>
<P>
Eastside activist Arnulfo Casillas, the other co-chairman, added: "Our march 
will be a cooperative effort involving businessmen, the community, students and 
others." 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 10,000 people may participate in the march to mark what organizers 
say is a significant chapter in the modern history of U.S. residents of Mexican 
descent. 
</P>
<P>
About 20,000 protesters marched 20 years ago to decry the high casualty rate 
among Chicano soldiers in Vietnam. But the march turned violent and rioting and 
looting ensued along Whittier Boulevard. Businesses there suffered $1 million 
in damages. 
</P>
<P>
In the violence, Salazar died inside a bar when he was struck by a tear-gas 
projectile fired by a sheriff's deputy. A coroner's inquest later found that 
the newsman died accidentally, but many Chicano activists believe that Salazar, 
then 42, was murdered. 
</P>
<P>
Although other observances have been held in the past to mark the 1970 march, 
some Whittier Boulevard merchants said they wanted no part of another march 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
But Edelman, whose district includes the Eastside, held two meetings in recent 
weeks to allay apprehension over the march request.

KIDNAPED BOY FOUND SAFE NEAR L.A.; 2 HELD IN ALLEGED RANSOM PLOT 
</P>

<P>
A 16-year-old boy kidnaped two weeks ago in Redwood City has been found 
unharmed in Bell and two men have been arrested after picking up $100,000 in 
ransom money near the Grand Central Market in downtown Los Angeles, police said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Ruben Chavez, a sophomore at Woodside High School in Redwood City, 
telephoned his family at 6:30 p.m. Wednesday and told his aunt, Martha Chavez, 
that he was fine, she said. She said that when she asked how he had weathered 
his ordeal, he told her, "I prayed a lot, like mother taught me to." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said Octavio Valderosa, 40, and Jose Gonzales, 22, were unaware 
that undercover officers were present when the two Mexican nationals picked up 
the ransom money at 3rd Street and Broadway on Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The officers trailed the suspects to a home in the 1600 block of East 84th 
Street, where Valderosa and Gonzales were arrested about 5 p.m. After 
questioning the suspects, officers went to an apartment in Bell, where they 
found the boy. 
</P>
<P>
"They threatened me a lot," the boy said of his abductors Thursday. "They told 
me that if I did anything stupid, I'd be killed. . . . (They) knew I could 
identify them, so I thought I would be shot." 
</P>
<P>
Police declined to provide many details about the case. But preliminary reports 
indicated either that the boy had been left bound in the apartment or that 
someone left to guard him fled before officers arrived. Why the boy was 
kidnaped remained something of a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
"The boy's family owns a bar," said Howard Baker, a spokesman for the Redwood 
City Police Department. "We're not talking about multimillionaires here. 
Obviously, there's more to it." 
</P>
<P>
Baker declined to speculate further. 
</P>
<P>
Salud Chavez, the boy's mother, said during a telephone interview Thursday that 
she had never heard of the suspects and had no idea why her son was abducted. 
She said her family has some land in Mexico -- "a little bit, a little place" 
-- but she doesn't think it had anything to do with the kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
The boy reportedly went to school on March 14, but left without attending 
class. A few hours later, his parents noticed his schoolbooks and his prized 
Raiders jacket in his room, but he was nowhere to be found. Juan never showed 
up for his after-school job at a local video rental store. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators say that about 9:40 that night, a Spanish-speaking man called the 
boy's home and told his parents, Ruben and Salud Chavez, that unless they 
raised $100,000 in three days, their son would be killed. The family relayed 
the information to Redwood City police. Within hours, the FBI was brought into 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said the three-day deadline passed without the family hearing from 
the kidnapers. 
</P>
<P>
But in the days that followed, Salud Chavez said, the kidnapers permitted her 
son to call his family three or four times. She said the boy spoke with his 
father each time until last Sunday, when he talked with her. 
</P>
<P>
"They let him talk for a minute and he asked how we were," she recalled. "I 
asked him if he was OK, and he just said, 'Ah . . .' in a very sad voice. (I 
told him) that we loved him a lot and prayed for him and commended (the 
situation) to God." 
</P>
<P>
Without providing any specifics, police indicated that at some point, 
apparently during one of the telephone calls to the family, the kidnapers 
spelled out how the ransom money was to be delivered. 
</P>
<P>
Salud Chavez said her husband drove to Los Angeles earlier this week, 
apparently to participate in the rendezvous, along with officers from the Los 
Angeles Police Department and FBI agents. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators indicated that about 4 p.m. Wednesday, as undercover agents and 
police officers watched, the money was handed over to the suspects. The arrests 
occurred about an hour later, and the suspects were booked at the Los Angeles 
Police Department's Parker Center jail on suspicion of kidnaping. Bail for each 
was set at $110,000. 
</P>
<P>
Interrogation of the pair led authorities to a small, second-floor apartment in 
a modest complex on Wilcox Avenue in Bell, where the two men reportedly had 
been living. 
</P>
<P>
"There were two guys, one about 40, the other about 20, who moved in there a 
few months ago," said George Roman, 14, who lives in the first-floor unit 
directly below. "They never talked to nobody. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"They weren't there a lot, but when they were, they made noise all night," 
Roman said. "It seemed like they never went to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Flores, who lives next door to Roman, said the two men drove a car with 
Mexican license plates. "Someone said they came from TJ (Tijuana)," Flores 
said. 
</P>
<P>
No one interviewed in the complex seemed aware that Juan Chavez had been held 
there until Los Angeles police and FBI agents arrived en masse shortly after 5 
p.m. on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"There were guns all over the place," Roman said. "They knocked on the door and 
then they kicked it down. That was about it." 
</P>
<P>
Flores said he saw the Chavez boy standing outside a few minutes later, waiting 
to get into one of the agents' cars. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't look scared at all," Flores said. "He looked real happy that they 
had found him."

JOHNSON IS MAGIC TO UNLV; 
</P>
<P>
REBELS: JUNIOR COLLEGE TRANSFER HAS BEEN EVERYTHING TARKANIAN WANTED -- IF HE 
WOULD ONLY SHOOT MORE. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During a 14-0 run by Nevada Las Vegas at the start of a nationally televised 
game against Louisville last month, forward Larry Johnson of the Runnin' Rebels 
waved toward the bench. 
</P>
<P>
He wanted out. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, no," Coach Jerry Tarkanian thought. "He must be sick." 
</P>
<P>
Once on the bench, though, Johnson assured his worried coach that everything 
was OK. "But it's seniors night," he told a surprised Tarkanian. "Let Mo play." 
</P>
<P>
UNLV's leading scorer and rebounder had given up his place on the floor for 
senior Moses Scurry. 
</P>
<P>
Such magnanimous gestures have come to be expected of Johnson, a transfer from 
Odessa College in Texas who joined a veteran team this season, established 
himself as UNLV's first consensus All-American and still managed to ingratiate 
himself with his new teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just fun to be around," Anderson Hunt said. "When you're around him, you 
get that feeling like, 'Damn, I'm around Larry Johnson.' You don't run into too 
many people like him." 
</P>
<P>
So accommodating is Johnson that his teammates call him Ambassador. His 
generosity is said to have held down his statistics, which may sound surprising 
because the 6-foot-7, 250-pound junior is averaging 20.7 points and 11.6 
rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
Some expected more. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, at Skyline High School in Dallas, Johnson was the Parade 
Magazine high school player of the year. He signed with Southern Methodist, but 
questions about the validity of his score on the Scholastic Aptitude Test 
diverted him to Odessa. 
</P>
<P>
In his first season in West Texas, he was the junior college player of the year 
and was named freshman of the year in all of college basketball by the Sporting 
News and Basketball Times. He was the only junior college player invited to the 
Olympic trials. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Johnson was even better, averaging 28 points and 17 rebounds a 
game and again earning recognition as the JC player of the year. He led the 
U.S. team to the gold medal in the World University Games last summer at 
Duisburg, West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
So, before he had played a game in major college basketball, Johnson was 
projected by some as the player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian called him the best player he'd ever recruited. 
</P>
<P>
Although UNLV had five returning starters, Johnson was on the cover of the 
media guide along with Olympian Stacey Augmon. Above them was the declaration: 
"The Big Year Is Here!" 
</P>
<P>
It would have been difficult for anybody to live up to that kind of advance 
billing, but Tarkanian said Johnson has been everything he expected. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV has reached the Final Four for the second time in four seasons -- the 
Rebels (33-5) will play Georgia Tech (28-6) in a semifinal game Saturday night 
at McNichols Arena in Denver -- and Johnson was the player of the year in the 
Big West Conference. 
</P>
<P>
"All those news clippings don't mean anything, but when I saw him play for the 
first time, I knew we could win the national championship," Hunt said of 
Johnson, who was named this week as a finalist for the Wooden Award as college 
basketball's player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian lost only one letterman from the team that fell one victory short of 
the Final Four last season, but Johnson's arrival has not upset the Rebels' 
chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
"He came into a veteran team and he fit in beautifully because he's so 
unselfish," Tarkanian said. "I think part of the reason for the way our kids 
feel about each other -- the closeness -- is because of Larry. He's always 
giving credit to somebody else, praising somebody else. And I think that kind 
of attitude rubs off." 
</P>
<P>
Said Coach Jerry Pimm of UC Santa Barbara: "His ego is not involved in the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian describes all of his players as "great kids," diminishing his 
credibility in a season that has been filled with academic problems, 
suspensions, fights and arrests, but he can't seem to say enough about Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"He's such a nice person that you almost can't believe it's true," Tarkanian 
said. "I absolutely love him. I don't know anybody who doesn't like him. Even 
opposing players like him." 
</P>
<P>
That's not true of many Rebels, but Pimm said of Johnson: "Our players all 
thought he was a great guy. He'll talk at you once in a while -- he gets his 
little street talk going -- but he is a good person. And, therefore, he'll do 
what he has to do to help his team win." 
</P>
<P>
Such as limit his offensive role to get everybody involved. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think a lot of people have seen all his potential," said Ed Goorjian, 
former Loyola Marymount coach and an administrative assistant to Tarkanian. "I 
think he has definitely held back. I don't know if that's the right word, but 
the important thing for Larry is to be a team player and for the team to do 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"What he's doing is good for the team because of the personalities (involved). 
It definitely would not be the kind of team that would be happy with a 
one-person show. 
</P>
<P>
"He has handled himself just tremendously. He has passed up shots and made the 
extra pass." 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, he has done so to Tarkanian's consternation. 
</P>
<P>
"I always encourage him to shoot more," Tarkanian said, using as an example a 
play where the center flashes across the key to take a pass from the wing. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever (David) Butler flashes high, he shoots it," Tarkanian said of the 
Rebels' 6-10 center. "When Larry flashes high, he never shoots it. And Larry's 
a great shooter! But he never shoots it. I said, 'Larry, shoot the ball.' He 
never misses it in practice." 
</P>
<P>
Next season, Tarkanian said, he probably will force the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"We will utilize him more," he said. "And I think he will feel like exerting 
himself more." 
</P>
<P>
It's possible, though, that Johnson will forgo his senior year to join the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's known about him since high school," said Jerry Reynolds, vice 
president of the Sacramento Kings. "He's not exactly a sleeper." 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds said Johnson would have been a first-round draft choice last year. He 
would be a lottery pick this year, Reynolds said, and would "definitely" be 
among the top five next season. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing he can't do quite well," said Reynolds, who compared Johnson 
to Charles Barkley of the Philadelphia 76ers. "The only negative I can see is 
that for the position he likes to play -- around the basket -- he's not very 
tall. But his strength makes up for it." 
</P>
<P>
Last November, Laker General Manager Jerry West called Johnson "absolutely 
tremendous," adding: "I don't know how he can stay in school, he's so 
tremendous." 
</P>
<P>
Asked this week if Johnson had been everything he expected, West said: "Is he 
everything you expected? He is a great player. He's tough. He knows how to 
play. His court demeanor is wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, though, said the NBA will have to wait. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I've said 20,000 times," he said again this week. "I'll be back. I 
love it here. I'm just having too much fun." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and Augmon, who met during the Olympic trials two years ago, are the 
best of friends, often sneaking out of pregame meals to dine together at 
McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
"But don't tell Coach," Johnson told a television reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Tark probably wouldn't mind. 
</P>
<P>
Just the other day, Johnson asked Tarkanian, 59, if he would be back next fall 
for an 18th season as UNLV coach, and Tarkanian told him: "If you come back." 
</P>
<P>
How would Johnson benefit from another season at UNLV? 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing he doesn't do is put it on the floor and pull up quickly for a 
jump shot, but he's got much better range than people think," said Pimm, who 
watched Johnson during tryouts for the World University Games last summer and 
called him dominant. 
</P>
<P>
Said Johnson: "There are a lot of things I need to work on -- perimeter 
defense, shooting, ballhandling. Hopefully, next year I can work on those 
things and become a better basketball player." 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian said Johnson, 21, has told him that he isn't ready for the NBA 
lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
And Johnson has told friends that he would like to stay to help make Augmon a 
better player. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, that's his way -- always thinking of somebody else. 
</P>

MIKE DOWNEY: IS THERE NO GIANT IN NBA? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Is anybody going to take the NBA championship? 
</P>
<P>
Detroit is in dire straits. Joe Dumars is down and out in Auburn Hills, and 
everybody knows he's the key to that team. I don't know that Isiah Thomas can 
carry the Pistons to another title without him. Besides, any team with Bill 
Laimbeer and Mark Aguirre can't be all good. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers are a tad shaky. Magic Johnson's multimillion-dollar foot hurts -- 
hey, at least it's not a hamstring -- and the Portland Trail Blazers are 
breathing down their necks like vampires. They will be after the Lakers again 
tonight at the Forum, with Clyde Drexler, the best thing to happen to Oregon 
since logs. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago? Could be. Michael Jordan is about to become the first player since 
Wilt Chamberlain to score a single-triple. Cleveland was pretty lucky the other 
night, holding Jordan to double figures. Yo, Michael: Get human, man. Who's 
going to stop this guy? He's so tough, he probably likes broccoli. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks? Forget it. Here's a team that is disappearing faster than rain 
forests. The Rod Strickland trade blew up in their face. Mark Jackson continues 
to prove how totally overrated he is. And Charles Oakley fell like a mighty 
oak. Madison Square Garden has turned into a one-ring circus: Patrick Ewing. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Philadelphia. Charles Barkley deserves to be NBA MVP, PDQ. Rick Mahorn 
hasn't actually killed anybody yet, which is good news. The backcourt of 
Hawkins and Dawkins is ready and steady. The 76ers just finished kicking 
Boston's green rumps, and will be really tough to beat in the playoffs at home. 
I just hate the thought of Mahorn getting the last laugh on the Pistons for 
cutting him. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, the NBA today sure is a lively place. I sure hope Danny Ferry liked 
Italy, because he sure did miss a good year here. 
</P>
<P>
"Any of eight clubs can win it," announcer and former coach Hubie Brown was 
saying the other day. "Maybe 10. Maybe 12. It's that up for grabs." 
</P>
<P>
How up for grabs is it? OK, let's count down the teams that can win it, and no 
counting by hundredths of a second: 
</P>
<P>
Lakers, Pistons, Trail Blazers, 76ers, Bulls, Knicks, Celtics . . . all right, 
we'll buy those. San Antonio? You bet your sweet life San Antonio. There's 
eight. Utah? Phoenix? Mmmmmm, well, OK, we'll count them, too. Any other teams 
look good enough to win the NBA? Seattle? Atlanta? Milwaukee? Nevada Las Vegas? 
</P>
<P>
All right, let's say 10, although frankly, I don't think the Celtics could win 
it this season, even if every single playoff game was played in that 
broken-down shack of theirs that Bob Vila couldn't repair. 
</P>
<P>
Home-court advantage is going to mean even more than usual, which is why the 
Lakers had better take Portland very, very seriously. The Trail Blazers are 
ready to make a run at this thing. Besides, we hear Buck Williams has extra 
motivation. We hear if the Trail Blazers don't win, they have threatened to 
banish him forever to New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit figured to be a good bet to make the NBA finals again, considering how 
well the Pistons were playing and how difficult they are to overthrow at the 
Palace. Everybody was healthy and happy, and Chuck Daly was hinting that he 
might even retire from coaching. Probably retire to a tropical island and turn 
over his entire closet to charity organizations, which would use it to clothe 
several Third World nations. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as Dumars got hurt, Detroit dropped three in a row. He might make it 
back for the playoffs, might not. All we know is that Chicago gave the Pistons 
a lot of trouble in last season's playoffs even when Dumars was in tip-top 
shape, and Philadelphia hasn't backed off an inch this season. 
</P>
<P>
Matter of fact, if you twist my arm -- and please don't -- I'll pick the 76ers 
in the Eastern Conference. I don't put anything past that Barkley character. 
He's not only a complete player, baseline to baseline, but he deserves his own 
HBO comedy special. Barkley presents a serious challenge to Mychal Thompson and 
John Salley for Funniest Man in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
Do people want to see the NBA finals between Philadelphia and Portland? 
</P>
<P>
Hey, trust me. It would be hot. Maybe the TV ratings would dip, but the Trail 
Blazers are a team waiting to be discovered. Any day now, some network will be 
announcing a new cheerleader movie: "The Blazer Girls." Pat Riley won't be half 
the sex-symbol Rick Adelman is. Michael Ovitz will sign up Kevin Duckworth as 
his next Hollywood client. Courtside tickets in Portland could shoot up to as 
much as $20 apiece! 
</P>
<P>
I just hope Drexler and Barkley don't kiss before every game.

Thursday, on the eve of the Davis Cup second-round tennis match between the 
United States and Czechoslovakia, it was a time to ponder what might have been: 
Ivan Lendl and Miloslav Mecir against John McEnroe and Andre Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, is the time for reality: Milan Srejber and Petr Korda against 
Aaron Krickstein and Brad Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
Even U.S. Captain Tom Gorman, while quick to praise the players who will be 
representing their countries during the next three days at the Prague Sports 
Hall, seemed a little let down that the match does not have the marquee value 
that once seemed possible. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, Czech Captain Frank Pala was disappointed Thursday when he had to 
announce that his No. 1 player, former U.S. Open finalist Mecir, will miss the 
event with a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
He hurt himself during a first-round loss three weeks ago in the Newsweek 
Champions Cup at Indian Wells, then had to withdraw from last week's Lipton 
International Players Championship in Key Biscayne, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
"In view of the fact there's no Mecir, and we have Korda and Srejber in 
singles, it could be difficult," Pala said. 
</P>
<P>
Pala never expected to have Lendl, who last played for his native 
Czechoslovakia in 1981 before moving to the United States. But the Czechs were 
encouraged when Lendl returned to Prague for the first time in nine years three 
weeks ago to play an exhibition match. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Tennis Assn. official said, however, that Lendl is reluctant to play for 
Czechoslovakia because he fears it might jeopardize his application for U.S. 
citizenship, which he hopes to receive in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Although Gorman's team would not have benefited from Lendl's presence on the 
opposing side, the U.S. captain said the experience of seeing Lendl play for 
his native country in front of a home crowd for perhaps the last time would 
have been worth the pain it might have caused. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first saw that we might play Czechoslovakia, I was thinking about the 
potential of McEnroe-Lendl," Gorman said. "It would have been phenomenal." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe, who has won more Davis Cup matches than any other U.S. player, 
apparently has decided to concentrate elsewhere this year. Agassi, who already 
has beaten Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg this year, decided not to participate 
when Gorman would not allow the temperamental player to bring along his 
entourage. 
</P>
<P>
Gorman refused to respond to the recent barbs Agassi has been volleying in his 
direction, and he said McEnroe is old enough to make his own decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"He has different priorities than he had eight years ago," Gorman said of 
McEnroe. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Gorman said, he is not unhappy with his singles players. Entering last 
week's Key Biscayne tournament, Gilbert was ranked fourth in the world and 
Krickstein seventh. 
</P>
<P>
In today's matches, Krickstein will open against Srejber, and Gilbert will play 
Korda. They will switch opponents Sunday. On Saturday, the U.S. doubles team of 
Rick Leach and Jim Pugh is scheduled to meet Tomas Smid and Karel Novacek, 
although it is possible the Czechs will use a different pair. 
</P>
<P>
The first team to win three matches will advance later this year to the third 
round against the winner of the Austria-Italy match.

MORNING BRIEFING: THREE LITTLE OLD LADIES GAVE HIM A BIG SLICE OF HUMBLE PIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARLEY TINKHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now it can be told: As the Georgetown basketball team prepared to fly out of 
Washington to the NCAA Mideast Regional in Indianapolis, the Boston Globe 
reports that three elderly ladies approached Coach John Thompson and offered 
their congratulations. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson thanked them and shook their hands. The ladies moved on, but after a 
few steps, one turned back and said, "You did a good job beating Tyson." 
</P>
<P>
Says Thompson: "The Lord has a way of humbling you." 
</P>
<P>
Add Thompson: Arkansas Coach Nolan Richardson, who is going to his first Final 
Four, was asked if he had received any advice from Thompson, who has gone to 
three. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson: "The only advice he had was get a lead and increase it." 
</P>
<P>
Ringing truth: Said the Portland Trail Blazers' Kevin Duckworth, dismissing 
Magic Johnson's injury Tuesday night: "The way we were playing, I don't care if 
the Lakers had Wilt Chamberlain, we still would have beaten them." 
</P>
<P>
The implication is that Chamberlain was better than Johnson, but you couldn't 
prove it by their championship rings. Magic has five, Wilt two. Also, Magic is 
one up in NCAA championship rings. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: If Akeem Olajuwon of the Houston Rockets continues at his present 
pace, he will become only the second man to lead the NBA in rebounds and 
blocked shots in the same season. Who was the first after the NBA started 
keeping blocked-shot statistics in 1973-74? 
</P>
<P>
Saddle sore: Leon Barmore, women's basketball coach at Louisiana Tech, made it 
to the Final Four with a victory over Texas, but said the Lady Techsters were 
at a disadvantage playing at Austin, home of the Lady Longhorns. 
</P>
<P>
Barmore said he can understand why the NCAA keeps picking Austin as a regional 
site, because of the popularity of women's basketball there, but he still 
thinks it's unfair. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the fifth time I've been to Austin," he told USA Today. "I ought to 
buy a condo there." 
</P>
<P>
Wait a minute: "The great National League pitchers were good hitters," said 
ESPN's Joe Morgan, mentioning the names of Don Drysdale, Bob Gibson and Juan 
Marichal. 
</P>
<P>
How about Sandy Koufax? He had a lifetime average of .097. Then there was Bob 
Buhl of the Milwaukee Braves. In 1962, he went 0 for the season, going hitless 
in 70 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Add forgettable quotes: Said Atlanta Falcon defensive back Deion Sanders, 
claiming that he is tired of trying to combine football and baseball: 
</P>
<P>
"I always wanted time off and now I'm enjoying it. I get up in the morning with 
nothing to do. I love it. I've got a game room in my house -- pinball, pool, 
air hockey, basketball, the works. I don't even leave my house. I'm just a 
23-year-old kid having fun." 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, he signed with Columbus, triple-A affiliate of the New York 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Bill Walton of Portland, 1976-77.

Heavy rains Thursday forced the postponement for the second day in a row of the 
$225,000 Virginia Slims of Houston women's tennis tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"We have suspended play," tournament spokesman Brian Muir said. "We did not 
complete a match for the second straight day." 
</P>
<P>
Muir said meet organizers were trying to reschedule the matches for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The clay courts at the Westside Tennis Club proved to be too wet Wednesday 
evening when the tournament's top-seed Martina Navratilova was scheduled to 
meet Bettina Fulco of Argentina.

Top-seeded Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina was ousted in the first round of the 
U.S. Women's Hardcourt Championships, losing to Lori McNeil of Houston, the 
world's 54th-ranked player, 6-3, 6-4 Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini's loss is her first in the first round of a tournament since October 
1988, when she lost to Czechoslovakia's Jana Novatna in three sets at a 
tournament in Fielderstadt, West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini was slapped with a code violation for illegal coaching in the last 
game of the first set. Her coach, Angel Gimenez of Spain, was sitting alone in 
the stands. 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini denied she was receiving coaching signals from Gimenez. 
</P>
<P>
"It was nothing special. Just 'Come on,' that's all," she said.

DON KING KEEPS AFTER DOUGLAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WALLACE MATTHEWS, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is it any surprise that Don King is once again using charges of racism to try 
to pressure Buster Douglas into returning to the fold? 
</P>
<P>
King has tried this gambit before, and always found it effective. It worked 
with Larry Holmes, Greg Page, Mitch Green, Mike Tyson and even Butch Lewis, so 
why shouldn't it work with Douglas? King has virtually moved into Douglas' 
hometown of Columbus, Ohio, -- he is currently living at the Radisson Hotel and 
is talking publicly about buying a home in the city -- and over the past week 
has managed to stir up racial tension in town, using the facilities of an 
all-black radio station, WCKX, as his personal soap box. In another of his 
tried-and-true scams, King also has made a stab at converting Douglas' father, 
Billy, to his cause by throwing a 50th birthday party for him and giving the 
old man -- who is somewhat estranged from his son -- a "gift" of $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, King has found support from some members of the city's black 
community, although not from the president of the Columbus City Council, Jerry 
Hammond, who is black. But King has lured NAACP Director Benjamin Hooks to 
Columbus to take up the cause. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't worked, because what Don King doesn't realize, or won't acknowledge, 
is that James Douglas is a highly intelligent, honest individual who sees right 
through him," manager John Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
"But then, how would Don King know that when he has never even sat down and 
talked to James Douglas? And he never will, because James wants nothing to do 
with Don King." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said that despite pressure from King and the various interests who want 
to force Douglas into a rematch with Mike Tyson, the new heavyweight champ 
intends to stick to his personal timetable -- no first defense until September, 
and preferably against No. 1 contender Evander Holyfield. But if that can't be 
done, Douglas may fight George Foreman, or Francesco Damiani, or the winner of 
next week's Michael Dokes-Razor Ruddock fight, or ... anyone he damn well 
pleases. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't forget, we are the people who went to Tokyo and kicked Mike Tyson's 
(butt)," Johnson said. "If I were Don King, and a lot of other people, I would 
be giving us some respect. But they are still not doing that. They continue to 
underestimate us." 
</P>
<P>
The feud between middleweight champion Michael Nunn and his manager, Dan 
Goossen, is more heated than early reports seemed to indicate. Nunn, who is 
scheduled to fight welterweight champ Marlon Starling April 14 in Las Vegas, 
walked out of his Pine Valley, Calif., training camp over the weekend in a 
continuing contract dispute with Goossen and Co., also known as Ten Goose 
Boxing. 
</P>
<P>
According to Goossen, the latest rift is a mystery, especially since Nunn 
announced March 16 that he had agreed to a two-year contract extension with 
Goossen. To hear Papa Goose tell it, Nunn's walkout came as a total surprise. 
</P>
<P>
But other sources say there was a full-scale blowup Saturday night, pitting 
Nunn and his entourage, mostly family members and friends from his hometown of 
Davenport, Iowa, against Dan and Joe Goossen, who is Nunn's trainer. At one 
point, the dispute turned physical, with Dan Goossen nearly coming to blows 
with Nunn's uncle, Marshall Jackson, and Joe Goossen putting Nunn's friend and 
"adviser," Danny Dothard, into a headlock. Luckily, Nunn -- who has a history 
of street-fight KOs that is more impressive than his ring record -- was in 
another room and not involved. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn is said to be working out in Los Angeles and being trained by Cassius "Bo" 
Green. He is taking much of his career direction from Dothard, Jackson and Ron 
May, a Davenport attorney. Nunn says he will go through with the Starling fight 
-- he is being paid $1.15 million -- and will reopen contract discussions with 
the Goossens afterward. But everyone concerned would be surprised if the 
Nunn-Goossen association continues past Nov. 1, when the current deal runs out. 
</P>
<P>
Now for some news on a fighter who is not looking for scapegoats, who is not 
splitting with his manager or firing his trainer. You know -- the kind they 
don't make anymore. 
</P>
<P>
The fighter, of course, is Buddy McGirt, the former IBF junior welterweight 
champion who was numbered among the world's best boxers 18 months ago but today 
is nearly forgotten when it comes to making title matches. McGirt (47-2-1, 37 
KOs), now a welterweight, fights Tommy Ayers Saturday afternoon on CBS. Name 
another fighter who lost a title -- he was beaten on a 12th-round TKO by 
Meldrick Taylor in September, 1988 -- won all nine of his fights since, and 
still hasn't had a whiff of another title shot? 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, McGirt blames no one but himself for his subpar showing against 
Taylor. He has not blamed his long-time manager, Al Certo, nor his promoter, 
Madison Square Garden, for his inability to get another shot. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't get upset over something you can't control," McGirt said. "It was my 
own fault. I shouldn't have fought (Taylor), I was sick that day. All I could 
blame is myself. I know that I screwed up. Those things happen. You make your 
bed hard, you got to sleep in it." 
</P>
<P>
The only one McGirt holds any animosity for is Taylor, who he says never 
treated him with any respect. As a result, McGirt did not watch Taylor's recent 
fight with Julio Cesar Chavez; he watched a detective show on TV instead. "I 
didn't give a damn about the fight," McGirt said. "Taylor's got a nasty 
attitude and a big mouth. He walks around like the world owes him something. 
The world don't owe him spit. But I owe him something." 
</P>
<P>
McGirt hopes a win over Ayers (38-2, 32 KOs) will earn him a shot at either 
Starling, Mark Breland or Simon Brown.

NHL ROUNDUP;

<P>
BRUINS WIN TO ASSURE BEST RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nobody, not even the Boston Bruins themselves, thought they had a team capable 
of winning more regular-season games than anyone else in the NHL this season. 
</P>
<P>
But Thursday night at Boston, in a well-played preview of a first-round playoff 
series, the Bruins wrapped up their first Adams Division title since 1984 and 
clinched the NHL's best record with a 3-2 victory over the Hartford Whalers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're overachievers," Bruin goalie Reggie Lemelin said. "I don't think anybody 
felt we could do it." 
</P>
<P>
Craig Janney won the game when he lifted the puck into the upper left side of 
the net with 3:09 left after Brian Propp missed a 50-foot shot that Whaler 
goalie Peter Sidorkiewicz saved before poking the puck away. 
</P>
<P>
Boston has 99 points. Calgary, with 95, can match that, but Boston would win a 
tiebreaker because it would have more wins. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 4, Toronto 2 -- Doug Wilson and Jocelyn Lemieux scored early goals as 
the Blackhawks clinched the Norris Division title at Chicago -- their first 
division championship since 1985-86. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 6, New York Rangers 4 -- Soviet defenseman Viacheslav Fetisov scored 
a goal and set up four others, tying a club single-game record for points by a 
defenseman, as the Devils clinched second place in the Patrick Division at East 
Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The victory assured the Devils of their best regular-season finish since moving 
to New Jersey from Colorado in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 2, Philadelphia 2 -- Geoff Courtnall's goal late in the second 
period at Philadelphia allowed the Capitals to clinch a Patrick Division 
playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 5, Quebec 2 -- Russ Courtnall scored a goal and added three assists at 
Quebec as the Canadiens kept alive their chances of finishing second in the 
Adams Division. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadiens trail second-place Buffalo by three points. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 4, Minnesota 2 -- Scott Arniel tipped in a shot from the point to break 
a tie with 5:51 remaining in regulation at Buffalo, N.Y., as the Sabres ended 
the North Stars' four-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 5, Pittsburgh 4 -- Rod Brind'Amour's tiebreaking goal early in the 
third period at St. Louis assured the Blues of finishing second in the Norris 
Division, and prevented the Penguins from clinching the final playoff berth in 
the Patrick Division.

AKEEM QUADRUPLES HIS PLEASURE AGAIN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Less than four weeks after the NBA stripped him of an apparent 
quadruple-double, Akeem Olajuwon of the Houston Rockets left nothing to dispute 
Thursday night against the Milwaukee Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
Olajuwon became the third player in NBA history to record a quadruple-double, 
scoring 18 points, grabbing 16 rebounds, blocking 11 shots and handing out 10 
assists as the Rockets defeated the Bucks, 120-94, at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought if not this year I would get it next year," Olajuwon said. "I knew I 
needed three blocks and three assists in the third quarter. When I got the 
blocks, I concentrated on passing the ball. 
</P>
<P>
On March 3, Olajuwon was credited with a quadruple-double in a game against 
Golden State, only to have it withdrawn by the NBA. Olajuwon had been given a 
10th assist when the Rockets' staff looked at the game film. 
</P>
<P>
After the league ruling, Olajuwon wound up with 29 points, 18 rebounds, 11 
blocked shots and nine assists. 
</P>
<P>
The other two players to record quadruple-doubles were Nate Thurmond of Chicago 
with 22 points, 14 rebounds, 13 assists and 12 blocked shots on Oct. 18, 1974, 
and Alvin Robertson, then of San Antonio, with 20 points, 11 rebounds, 10 
assists and 10 steals on Feb. 18, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The victory pulled the Rockets within half a game of Seattle for the final 
playoff berth in the Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Otis Thorpe scored a team-high 21 points for the Rockets and Buck Johnson added 
19. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson led the Bucks with 18 points, and Jay Humphries added 17. 
</P>
<P>
Portland 112, Atlanta 106 -- Buck Williams scored a team-high 18 points at 
Portland and was one of eight Trail Blazers in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
Dominique Wilkins scored a team-high 27 points for the Hawks and Moses Malone 
added 23. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Porter and Clyde Drexler each scored 17 points for the Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
Portland is two games behind the first-place Lakers in the Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix 105, Charlotte 92 -- Tom Chambers scored 29 points and Kevin Johnson 
added 25 as the Suns took advantage of some cold second-half shooting by the 
Hornets at Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Chambers, who had 60 points against Seattle on Saturday, sat out the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 79-69, the Hornets missed eight of their first nine shots in the 
fourth quarter and the Suns went on a 12-2 run over a four-minute span to 
clinch the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Hornet reserve forward Brian Rowsom was carried off on a stretcher after 
injuring his neck when he fell to the floor with 1:32 left in the game.

STAKES RACE GIVES RON MCANALLY CHANCE TO VISIT OLD KENTUCKY HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
FLORENCE, Ky. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The last time Ron McAnally did any running in these parts, he was trying to 
escape from the orphanage where he had been dropped off when he was 5. 
</P>
<P>
Twice, the young McAnally attempted to run away from the Covington Protestant 
Children's Home. Once, he changed his mind and went back. The other time, he 
was picked up in downtown Covington and returned to the orphanage. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't easy getting out, either," McAnally remembered Thursday. "I had to 
cross a slate roof, and there was a two-story drop to the ground." 
</P>
<P>
McAnally, 57, will do some more "running" in Northern Kentucky Saturday. Tight 
Spot, one of his candidates for this year's Kentucky Derby, is the 5-1 third 
choice, behind favorites Summer Squall and Bright Again, in the $500,000 Jim 
Beam Stakes at Turfway Park. 
</P>
<P>
McAnally was born in Covington, not far from the old Latonia Race Course and 
only a 10-minute drive from Turfway. His mother died of tuberculosis when he 
was 5. His father, who had four other young children, worked as a dispatcher 
for a cab company in Cincinnati and couldn't handle the family. The five 
children were sent to the orphanage. 
</P>
<P>
McAnally spent 12 years there. His memories of the place are generally good, 
but one of his early jobs was enough to send him over the wall twice. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the dishwasher," he said. "It was just me and one other guy. We had to 
wash the dishes for everybody -- 200 kids -- three times a day." 
</P>
<P>
McAnally smiled and said: "You know, I'm still washing them." 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Debbie, is in Europe, visiting one of their daughters who is studying 
on a college exchange program. Debbie is a 50% owner of Silver Ending, another 
Derby hopeful who may run in the Blue Grass Stakes on April 14 at Keeneland in 
Lexington, Ky., 75 miles south of here. 
</P>
<P>
McAnally didn't have to wash dishes Thursday night. He and his two sisters, who 
are married to business executives in this area, went out to dinner. McAnally's 
brothers live in Southern California, one working for the Horsemen's Benevolent 
and Protective Assn. and the other running a restaurant near Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not the perfect way to grow up," McAnally said of the orphanage. "But 
at least we had the advantage of being family and all being in there together. 
You hear about families where the kids are fighting all the time, even when 
they grow up. We're so close that I can't imagine any of us ever having a 
fight." 
</P>
<P>
McAnally's father was in his 40s when he died of a heart attack. Joe, one of 
Ron's brothers, was the only child who lived with the father after leaving the 
orphanage. 
</P>
<P>
McAnally has become a successful California trainer and is eligible for 
election to horse racing's Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., this year, 
but he is mindful of his roots. He wrote a check just the other day for the 
orphanage where he grew up. And today, while visiting Keeneland, he'll look in 
on John Henry, who at 15 is a leading attraction at the Kentucky Horse Park. 
With McAnally as trainer, John Henry won horse-of-the-year titles in 1981 and 
'84, and the grass-loving gelding was instrumental in McAnally being voted 
trainer of the year in 1981. John Henry is also on the Hall of Fame ballot this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
McAnally has a picture at home in Pasadena of him and his grandfather, who 
introduced him to racing at Gulfstream Park in Florida when he was about 6. 
</P>
<P>
After an Air Force hitch, McAnally tried studying engineering at the University 
of Cincinnati, but admits that he wasn't much of a student. He wound up living 
in the San Fernando Valley with an uncle, trainer Reggie Cornell. McAnally 
started as a chauffeur for Cornell, who quit driving after his brother was 
seriously injured in an auto accident in Canada. But McAnally wound up breaking 
Silky Sullivan, the charismatic, Cornell-trained Santa Anita Derby winner who 
bombed out, at 2-1, in the 1958 Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
McAnally has started four horses in the Kentucky Derby, finishing fourth with 
Super Moment in 1980, fourth with Water Bank and 13th with Cassaleria in 1982 
and fifth with Hawkster last year. 
</P>
<P>
The best young horse McAnally has ever trained, however, was Donut King. He 
bought him for $16,000 at a Del Mar yearling sale for Verne Winchell, the 
doughnut man. As a 2-year-old, Donut King won the Champagne Stakes at Aqueduct, 
beating the intrepid Jaipur and Crimson Satan, who was voted the division 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
The following year, Donut King probably should have won the Wood Memorial, his 
final prep for the Derby. McAnally told his jockey, Manny Ycaza, that Sunrise 
County, the Wood favorite, had a terrible habit of lugging out in the stretch. 
Ycaza waited as long as he could before trying to pass Sunrise County, but 
Donut King still got caught in the drift and finished third, beaten by less 
than a length. Sunrise County was disqualified from first to third, and the 
victory went to Admiral's Voyage, who had finished second. 
</P>
<P>
Full of confidence, McAnally sent Donut King to Churchill Downs. The Monday 
before the Derby, after working the race distance of 1 1/4 miles, Donut King 
came back lame and his career was over. 
</P>
<P>
Now McAnally is at Turfway Park for the first time, chasing another Derby with 
another Verne Winchell horse, Tight Spot. When the trainer got here, memories 
of that Northern Kentucky orphanage and Donut King's Derby miss were almost 
bound to cross at that intersection of the mind. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall, the 8-5 favorite in the 1 1/8-mile Jim Beam Stakes, drew the No. 
1 post position, which is no longer considered a disadvantage at Turfway Park. 
. . . Pat Day, who has won with all three of his previous Jim Beam mounts, will 
ride Summer Squall. Outside them, in order, will be Sluki, Bright Again, 
Yonder, Seven Spades, Power Lunch, Top Snob, Fighting Fantasy, Private School 
and Tight Spot. . . . Corey Black will ride Tight Spot, and Alex Solis is in 
from Santa Anita to ride Power Lunch, the Wayne Lukas trainee who broke his 
maiden on March 8 at Oaklawn Park. . . . With rain forecast for today and 
Saturday, there's a chance of an off track. 
</P>
<P>
Three 3-year-olds who ran earlier in California -- Tarascon, Individualist I 
and Hawaiian Pass -- are entered in Saturday's Rebel, a 1 1/16-mile race at 
Oaklawn Park. Tarascon is the 2-1 favorite in an 11-horse field. . . . Smelly, 
a prominent 3-year-old, will face nine opponents Saturday at Garden State Park 
in the Cherry Hill Mile. . . . Brown Bess heads the five-horse field Saturday 
at Santa Anita in the $200,000 Santa Barbara Handicap, a 1 1/4-mile grass race 
for fillies and mares. Also running are Royal Touch, Estrella Fuega, Double 
Wedge and Isabella Ra.

CRESPI BASEBALL PLAYERS GIVE TRACK TEAM HAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gloves, bats and balls were not part of a special practice session last week 
for Crespi High baseball players Mike Peters, Joe Ruggiero and Mark Venturine. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the outfielders sported shorts and track spikes during a lunchtime 
session spent rehearsing starts and handoffs with sprinter Ken Kuras. The 
hastily assembled 440-yard relay team shocked track Coach Jim Benkert, who had 
arranged the practice, with a respectable 45.2-second clocking despite two 
technical errors. 
</P>
<P>
What Benkert cooked up, though, in his "melting pot" relay, has become the 
fastest foursome in the area this year. In last week's meet against Loyola, 
Crespi's sprint team ran a 43.6 in its competitive debut. The Valley-leading 
mark converts to a 43.3 metric performance. 
</P>
<P>
"They got out of the blocks slowly and had one poor exchange," Benkert said of 
the relay team's earlier practice. "The handoffs were good. They knew what they 
were doing." 
</P>
<P>
Against Loyola, the impromptu relay team was flawless. And Ruggiero also helped 
Crespi's cause with second-place finishes in the 100 meters (11.6), 220 yards 
(23.4) and long jump (19 feet 6 3/4 inches). 
</P>
<P>
Although Crespi lost, 73-54, in the meet that traditionally decides the Del Rey 
League championship, Peters, Ruggiero and Venturine may run in future meets if 
the baseball schedule permits. 
</P>
<P>
Although Benkert has left the welcome mat out for the players, baseball Coach 
Scott Muckey worries that two sports might be too much for the athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's not interfering with baseball, then its OK," he said. "If it starts 
taking away from the (baseball) team, then I don't feel particularly good about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'll leave it up to the kids." 
</P>
<P>
Pitching strength: Despite a .260 team batting average, Hart High is 7-1-2 and 
atop the Foothill League standings with a 4-0 record. 
</P>
<P>
How so? 
</P>
<P>
Pitching. Led by the trio of left-hander Andrew Lorraine, and right-handers 
Kevin Foderaro and Keith Halcovich, Hart is keeping opponents off the 
scoreboard. The Indians have a team earned-run average of 2.13 in 72 1/3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Lorraine, a senior, is 3-0 with 48 strikeouts and an 0.50 ERA in 28 innings. 
Foderaro, a senior, is 3-0 with 24 strikeouts and an 3.71 ERA in 28 1/3 innings 
and Halcovich, a junior, is 1-1 with nine strikeouts and an 2.19 ERA in 16 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Foderaro has two complete games, including a no-hitter, and two saves. Lorraine 
has one shutout. 
</P>
<P>
Downed Spirits: Paraclete right fielder Chuck Lang became the latest victim of 
the Spirits' hard luck when he sustained a season-ending injury to his left 
biceps while attempting to stop a truck that was rolling from his garage. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently Lang's arm became pinned between the truck's door and the garage 
when he attempted to jump inside and apply the brakes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been one of those seasons, already," Coach Andy Gavel said. 
</P>
<P>
Lang, a three-year starter, was batting .250. Paraclete (3-5) lost its cleanup 
hitter when David Yaroslaski re-injured a knee attempting to score from third 
base earlier this season. As Yaroslaski crawled back to third, a throw 
attempting to nab him went awry. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was screaming at him to score, and he yelled for a pinch-runner," 
Gavel said. "Like I said, it's been one of those seasons." 
</P>
<P>
Reflection correction: After 15 seasons of juggling a slew of responsibilities 
as Hoover baseball coach, Bob Cooper has decided to slow down and delegate the 
jobs of fund-raising and statistics-balancing to assistants. 
</P>
<P>
Some might think Cooper relied on mirrors over the years to handle his 
multitude of tasks. And the mirror theory isn't all cracked -- just check out 
the wall in the Tornadoes' outfield. 
</P>
<P>
On a sweltering day last spring, Cooper and his wife, Glenda, painted the wall 
with huge logos of local sponsors. Unwittingly, the two painted the Zs in 
Domino's Pizza backward. 
</P>
<P>
True to his sport, Cooper gave a traditional baseball excuse for the miscue: 
The sun was in his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so damn hot out there, it seemed like the sun was bouncing off the wall 
and right in our face," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The error will not be saved for posterity, however. Domino's did not sponsor 
the team this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Their year is up," Cooper said, laughing. "Probably, the next game it will be 
outta there." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Glaze and staff writers Sam Farmer, Vince Kowalick and Jeff Riley 
contributed to this notebook.

ANGRY CREDITORS SAY THEY WANT EASTERN LIQUIDATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT E. DALLOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eastern Airlines' unsecured creditors, angered that the airline is retreating 
from an earlier deal with them, have threatened to seek liquidation of the 
carrier. 
</P>
<P>
Such liquidation would mean shutting down the airline, selling its assets and 
distributing the proceeds to the creditors. 
</P>
<P>
The creditors made their threat in a session before bankruptcy Judge Burton R. 
Lifland in response to an announcement earlier this week that the carrier would 
lose more than twice as much money in 1990 as it had estimated. Eastern said it 
would not be able to honor the agreement it reached with creditors last month, 
when it promised to pay 50 cents on the dollar on its $980 million in debt. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern raised its estimate of losses for this year to $330 million, $185 
million above an earlier prediction. The airline's president, Phil Bakes, had 
said in an interview at the time of the announcement that adverse publicity 
about its bankruptcy had hurt the airline, especially with the lucrative 
business traveler market. When Eastern first declared bankruptcy, Frank 
Lorenzo, its chairman and chairman of Texas Air Corp., its parent, vowed that 
the creditors would be paid at 100 cents on the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the airline confirmed that the threat was made. But they said 
the threat might simply be a bargaining position that the creditors were using 
to prod the airline for a better deal. 
</P>
<P>
The creditors also were said to be seeking appointment of a trustee to take 
over operation of the airline from management and, ultimately, to liquidate it. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said the unsecured creditors -- ranging from airline caterers and fuel 
firms to engine makers -- would also try to block a request by Eastern to get 
$80 million from its funds held in escrow which it needs for day-to-day 
operating expenses. The court must approve all such withdrawals. 
</P>
<P>
"If you were given such an extremely distasteful proposal," said one person 
close to the situation who declined to be identified, "wouldn't you come out 
with both guns blazing, knowing that there will be negotiations?" 
</P>
<P>
The company and creditors were reported to have scheduled a meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
Reached in Los Angeles, David Boies, one of Eastern's top lawyers, declined to 
comment on the threat. 
</P>
<P>
Said Eastern spokesman Robin Matell: "We are not commenting on reports of what 
came out of the talks between Eastern and the creditors. Those talks are 
supposed to be confidential. But there are always a likelihood of leaks. The 
unions will leak whatever damages the company." 
</P>
<P>
Eastern's machinists have been on strike against the airline for more than a 
year. They struck five days before the airline filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
on March 9, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Liquidation is not in the best interest of either party," Matell said. 
"Historically, the creditors have been constructive and we hope that will be 
the outcome here, too. Eastern and Texas Air will discuss with responsible 
parties the manner in which to structure a final agreement." 
</P>
<P>
Matell stressed that despite the creditors' threats it is the bankruptcy court 
that must make any final determination all actions, including liquidation. 
</P>
<P>
The call for liquidation is not the first time it has happened in the Eastern 
case. Earlier, the airline's preferred shareholders had urged such action. 
Bakes said when that happened Eastern's bookings fell off 50% within days. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Pettee, airline analyst with the investment house of Merrill Lynch, 
said that liquidation would badly hurt Texas Air. 
</P>
<P>
He said that Eastern's pension funds were under-funded by somewhere between 
$400 million and $1 billion. If Eastern were liquidated, he said, the Pension 
Benefit Guarantee Corp., a government agency, would go after Texas Air for the 
delinquent payments. "It would seriously threaten the financial wherewithal of 
Texas Air," he said.

DEAL FOR 'COSBY' CALLED COSTLIEST TV RENEWAL EVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
National Broadcasting Co. and Carsey-Werner Co. renewed "The Cosby Show" for an 
additional 26 episodes in what sources said was the largest renewal deal for a 
show in the history of television. 
</P>
<P>
NBC and Carsey-Werner declined to comment on the specific details of the 
renewal, but sources said the overall value is about $50 million, or roughly $2 
million for each episode. The producers at one stage sought a license fee of $3 
million per episode. 
</P>
<P>
The network and the producers had been deadlocked until last week on terms for 
a seventh season of "Cosby," whose current contract expires in May. The show, 
since it went on the air in 1984, has been the backbone of the network's highly 
profitable Thursday night schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said no commitments were given for "A Different World" or "Grand," two 
other shows produced by Carsey-Werner for NBC. "There was no laundry list," 
said a knowledgeable source. The renewal deal will, however, cut into the 
network's profits from its top-rated show. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's happy," said Norman Brokaw, chief executive of the William Morris 
Agency and Cosby's agent. "The deal has been finalized. Bill Cosby was not 
prepared to go somewhere else," Brokaw added, alluding to the star's statements 
that he would not move the show to ABC or CBS if the producers and NBC could 
not reach an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The producers had originally asked NBC for a $100-million "signing bonus" in 
addition to having NBC pay for the direct costs of the series. Customarily, the 
license fee that networks pay to air a show do not cover its production costs. 
Only after a series has been a hit for more than five years is a network forced 
to pay a license fee that matches, and in some cases exceeds, the production 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
According to sources, the producers came under intense pressure from colleagues 
in the Hollywood production community to drop their bonus demands. It was 
thought such a precedent would further inflame the already strained 
relationship between program suppliers and the networks. The producers and 
networks are engaged in an all-out lobbying campaign in Washington over whether 
the networks should be allowed to own a stake in the shows they air.

CONSUMER AFFAIRS: BE WARY WHEN YOU USE DIRECT MAIL FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Reader's Digest first heard about Keen Ear hearing aids from its readers, 
who contacted the magazine because Keen Ear advertised that it was "in Reader's 
Digest." The problem was that Keen Ear had never been mentioned or advertised 
in its pages. 
</P>
<P>
Keen Ear was apparently a problem for those readers as well. Some people were 
suspicious at the outset of a hearing aid for $179 ($149 for the second ear), 
no fitting or examination required, and full refunds guaranteed. One man who 
was trying to decide whether to order even went to the Digest's Pleasantville, 
N.Y., offices to ask if they really stood behind the product. 
</P>
<P>
Some got suspicious only after placing an order with the company, comfortingly 
described as a group of "Senior Citizens on a mission." They'd received no 
hearing aids, or received no refund when, dissatisfied, they tried to return 
the product and get money back. 
</P>
<P>
Reader's Digest wasn't alone in getting calls about Keen Ear. Almost every 
government agency with possible authority over such sales received complaints, 
and almost all are looking into the company. They just won't provide much 
information, to either the complaining consumer or the general public, and the 
benefit of their protection is still to come. 
</P>
<P>
The Keen Ear situation illustrates the hazards of ordering goods unseen from 
companies one can't visit. "There's no way to check on the bona fides of a 
business at the other end of the country," says Reader's Digest attorney 
Charles Prescott. "We had letters on Keen Ear from Louisiana, Florida, Texas. 
Those people can't go back to the store or to small claims court." Indeed, says 
one consumer, "for all the ballyhoo about today's sophisticated, 
consumer-oriented mail order industry, something like this makes you say you'll 
never order from any of them again." 
</P>
<P>
It's certainly not easy to check them out, though Keen Ear ads named some 
places to start, many suggestive of trouble. Reader's Digest told anyone who 
inquired that Keen Ear was never in the magazine, and wrote the company as 
well, says Prescott, but "they ignored us." Keen Ear also advertised membership 
in "The Better Hearing Institute" -- a nonprofit informational group in 
Annandale, Va., which doesn't have members. It, too, has taken consumer calls 
since late 1988 and has written Keen Ear to remove the Institute's name from 
its advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Keen Ear also displays a Seal of Honor from the Direct Mail Board of Review -- 
a little-known, uncredentialed, year-old volunteer group of a dozen people in 
the business. It's directed from the Lebanon, Pa., offices of Alpert, O'Neil, 
Tigre &amp; Co. -- the first two direct marketing consultants, the third a 
"6-pound Yorkie" that Peggy O'Neil describes as "in charge of security." 
</P>
<P>
The Board has awarded about 100 such seals, charging $300 a year for the honor. 
It's awarded for "truth in advertising about what you're offering," says 
O'Neil. Not that anyone checks: "The material (Keen Ear) sent us was all right 
in that it said they would give refunds," says O'Neil, "but we can't tell 
whether they do or they don't. There's no way to check the truthfulness." 
</P>
<P>
Some consumers went directly to outside authorities. If they chose the Better 
Business Bureau and knew enough to pick the one closest to Keen Ear's Tarzana 
headquarters, they actually got some straightforward information. 
</P>
<P>
The BBB's Cypress office has received more than 1,000 inquiries and almost 500 
consumer complaints about Keen Ear, product and company. The bureau tells 
callers the company has an "unsatisfactory business performance record," says 
operations director Lona Luckett, who has put out news releases warning 
consumers and written "letters to every regulatory agency" about the problems 
with Keen Ear. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, the ordinary consumer won't get much from those agencies, 
although they're all clearly on the case, one way or another. U.S. Postal 
Inspectors can seek a "mail stop" (keeping all mail, including new orders, from 
reaching a business) or a full shutdown of any company using the mails to 
defraud, particularly with medical devices. But the Los Angeles office will 
only say it has received complaints and has been "looking into" Keen Ear since 
last fall. 
</P>
<P>
The state Hearing Aid Dispenser's Examining Committee in Sacramento will say it 
gets complaints on the company but passes them on to the state attorney 
general, having no jurisdiction because mail-order companies selling such 
devices don't need licenses. The attorney general will take consumer complaints 
about Keen Ear (if written to the Sacramento office), and even acknowledges 
receiving many. But although deputy attorney general Dennis Dawson in San Diego 
expects "some formal resolution of this problem" at "some point in time," the 
office won't admit to any action on it. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the Federal Trade Commission is "interested in hearing" from 
consumers about Keen Ear, and would discuss hearing aid purchases in general, 
says Dale Sekovich, an FTC investigator in Los Angeles. But the FTC "can't 
comment" beyond that. Even the Direct Mail Assn. in New York, meant to 
safeguard the reputation of its whole industry, won't say what it knows of the 
company, although it will forward complaints to Keen Ear, and if necessary, to 
government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
With all the stir, "the problem is not as large as it would seem," says Keen 
Ear President Bill Brennan. "There isn't anyone that doesn't get a refund," 
although it sometimes takes time. 
</P>
<P>
While they wait, few consumers can make all these calls, often netting so 
little. They may get real information, even help. More likely, they get general 
warnings about the need to have their hearing loss -- cause and degree -- 
evaluated by a professional, about phone numbers that are just order lines, 
about addresses that the post office will identify as commercial mail drops -- 
a company's way of keeping the public at bay. 
</P>
<P>
But this is not enough. Without better protection from our protectors, only one 
rule guarantees perfect safety: Buy no direct mail product more complicated 
than a vegetable slicer from an unknown company, and risk no more than $20.

NORTHROP SUED OVER ALLEGEDLY PHONY TEST DATA; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: THE GOVERNMENT'S CHARGES ARE THE LATEST IN A STRING OF ACCUSATIONS 
INVOLVING A NOW-DEFUNCT UNIT OF THE FIRM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Justice Department sued Northrop for more than $5 million in damages and 
penalties Thursday, alleging that the aerospace firm submitted phony test 
results on a stabilization device for a Marine Corps jet fighter. 
</P>
<P>
The charges are yet another legal complication growing out of Northrop's 
now-defunct Western Services department in Pomona, a small operation that was 
the subject of an earlier civil fraud suit and a federal criminal indictment. 
</P>
<P>
The civil suit filed Thursday marks the third time that the government has sued 
a Northrop operation for fraud or joined suits filed against the company by 
whistle-blowers. Northrop also faces at least three federal criminal 
investigations around the country and several other civil suits by former 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop pleaded guilty to 34 criminal fraud counts last month in Los Angeles 
and paid a $17-million fine in connection with tests on the same stabilization 
device for the Marine fighter involved in Thursday's suit and on guidance 
equipment for a nuclear-armed cruise missile. 
</P>
<P>
The civil suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles under the federal 
False Claims Act, alleges that the firm falsely certified on at least 59 
occasions that the stabilization component for the Marine AV-8B Harrier jet met 
government specifications. The government is seeking $4.8 million in treble 
damages allowed under the False Claims Act and more than $600,000 in civil 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
The device, known as a rate sensor assembly, is designed to maintain the 
stability of the Harrier while it takes off and lands vertically, which it does 
by vectoring the thrust of its jet engines. 
</P>
<P>
Under a series of subcontracts issued to Northrop by Honeywell Inc. between 
January, 1980, and September, 1986, Northrop was supposed to test the rate 
sensor assemblies by vibrating the device and exposing it to extreme 
temperature conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that Northrop employees adjusted a "shaker table" so that it 
would appear that the assemblies were vibrated at a much more intense level 
than they actually were and that they met contract specifications when they did 
not. 
</P>
<P>
When the firm submitted the first two devices in 1983, it certified that they 
had withstood 4,000 hours of vibration and temperature cycling when they had 
not done so, the complaint charges. 
</P>
<P>
"The facts demonstrate that the government was ill-served," Assistant Atty. 
Gen. Stuart M. Gerson said Thursday in a telephone interview. "I am sure there 
are some very fine people at Northrop, but what we are saying is that in this 
case and others there was improper conduct." 
</P>
<P>
The Western Services department, where the allegedly improper work was done, 
was a small autonomous unit with only several dozen employees. It reported to 
headquarters for the Northrop Precision Products division in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
The Pomona operation was shut down by the company after the allegations 
surfaced in 1987, and the plant manager was fired along with three of his 
employees, a Northrop spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The plant manager, Clarence Gonsalves, pleaded guilty to eight criminal counts 
in February. In addition, the plant's engineering supervisor pleaded guilty 
earlier. But the Justice Department dropped charges against two top Northrop 
executives in the case. 
</P>
<P>
The Northrop spokesman defended the quality of the rate sensor device. He said: 
"According to the . . . (the Marine Corps), the equipment has performed 
satisfactorily in flight operations. 
</P>
<P>
Two former employees of the Pomona plant have also filed a suit against 
Northrop, alleging that the firm falsified tests on a guidance device for the 
air-launched cruise missile. The Justice Department last year joined in that 
suit, which is seeking $90 million in treble damages. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Benson, an attorney representing those employees complained Thursday 
that the Justice Department acted improperly by filing the Harrier suit, since 
the original information came from his plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
"What they have done is rip us off," he said. "I am upset." But Gerson, the 
assistant attorney general, said: "In . . . (false claims cases), there are 
disputes of who has the primacy. If there is any such dispute here, I am not 
aware of it." 
</P>

CRAY WILL ACQUIRE MINI-SUPERCOMPUTER PRODUCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marking its first move into lower-priced, lowered-powered models, supercomputer 
pioneer Cray Research said Thursday that it has tentatively agreed to acquire a 
Silicon Valley maker of so-called mini-supercomputers. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the all-cash purchase of Supertek Computer of Santa Clara, Calif., 
were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
The deal could bolster Minneapolis-based Cray's otherwise lackluster 
performance in the past 18 months by giving it a product line that has proven 
to be more popular and affordable than the company's traditional expensive and 
powerful top-of-the-line supercomputers. 
</P>
<P>
According to analysts, mini-supercomputers, which perform many of the same 
tasks once reserved exclusively for supercomputers, have stolen sales once 
guaranteed to supercomputer makers as buyers look to less expensive 
alternatives to Cray's traditional models, which range in cost from $2 million 
to $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts have criticized Cray over the years for allowing mini-supercomputer 
makers, such as Convex Computer Corp. in Richardson, Tex., to grow at Cray's 
expense and create an entirely new market. 
</P>
<P>
However, Gary Smaby, an analyst who follows Cray closely, said he doubts 
whether Cray's purchase of Supertek will be anything more than a defensive move 
for the immediate future. Smaby reasons that Cray will initially hope to 
protect itself with Supertek's product line, which is compatible with Cray's 
older systems, the X-MP models. Later, he said, Cray will fully integrate 
Supertek's technology with Cray's most powerful systems, the Y-MP models. 
</P>
<P>
John Rollwagen, Cray's chairman and chief executive, said Supertek is an 
important element in the company's previously announced supercomputing 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"Supertek was the only firm that met our criteria for acquiring compatible 
technology for this market segment," Rollwagen said. "Their product is 
Cray-compatible, and it is available right now. We believe the 
mini-supercomputer system will stimulate demand for Cray Research 
supercomputers and will allow us to meet our customers' needs for a 
Cray-compatible product of this kind."

HITACHI, MOTOROLA FIGHT ENDS; APPLE'S THE LOSER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A hard-hitting court battle over patent rights between rival semiconductor 
makers Hitachi Ltd. and Motorola ended Thursday with a federal judge ruling 
against both sides. 
</P>
<P>
However, in a strange twist, the biggest loser in the case could be Apple 
Computer, whose Macintosh product line depends heavily on one of the chips 
affected by the legal proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
In his decision, U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton ruled in Austin, Tex., that 
both companies had infringed on the other's patent and ordered both to pay 
damages as well stop selling chips based on the offending patents. 
Representatives of the two companies could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Under Bunton's order, Hitachi will pay $1.9 million to Motorola for 
infringement of Motorola patents in the Japanese firm's H8 chip, and Motorola 
will pay $500,000 to Hitachi for infringing on Hitachi patents in the American 
firm's 68030 microprocessor. 
</P>
<P>
However, despite the imbalance of payments, the decision could be far more 
damaging to Motorola, which, analysts said, takes in about $100 million in 
annual sales from the 68030. It could also hurt Motorola's customers, including 
Apple and Sun Microsystems, which depend on the microprocessor to control some 
of their machines. 
</P>
<P>
The 68030 chip is the microprocessor used in all but two Macintoshes built by 
Apple. An Apple spokeswoman said the company is confident that Motorola and 
Hitachi would resolve their differences before Apple's inventory of the 
microprocessor is depleted. 
</P>
<P>
Although she declined to reveal Apple's inventory of the microprocessor, she 
noted that the company is noted for keeping its stockpile of supplies low so 
that it can receive shipments just as they are needed. 
</P>
<P>
A Sun spokeswoman said two of its products use the Motorola chip. She added 
that the company has not yet evaluated the ruling to determine its potential 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Slater, editor of the Microprocessor Report in Palo Alto, predicted 
that the judge's ruling would prompt both sides to quickly seek a 
cross-licensing agreement covering both chips. Slater said such an agreement 
would be indispensable, especially to Motorola. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way Motorola can allow this ruling to stand as it is. They have to 
convince Hitachi to license them the technology for that chip," Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling capped a yearlong suit and countersuit battle between the companies 
that had at one time been technological, manufacturing and marketing allies. 
</P>
<P>
The legal proceedings started in January, 1989, when Motorola, based in 
Schaumburg, Ill., sued Tokyo-based Hitachi, claiming that the Japanese company 
was using Motorola secrets in development of a series of micro controllers -- 
thumb-sized devices central to information-processing devices used in 
computers. The micro controllers were designed and manufactured in Austin. 
</P>
<P>
Hitachi filed a countersuit, claiming Motorola infringed on some of Hitachi's 
patents. At issue was a 1986 cross-licensing agreement between the two 
companies that allowed each to use some of the other's patents. 
</P>
<P>
In his ruling, Bunton said neither company was licensed to use the other's 
patents under the 1986 agreement.

Regulators Urge Expanded SEC Powers: Three top federal regulators said they 
favor sharply expanding the Securities and Exchange Commission's power over 
securities markets by handing it control of stock futures now handled by 
commodities regulators. In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, 
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden 
and Treasury Undersecretary Robert Glauber said stripping the Commodity Futures 
Trading Commission of jurisdiction over stock index futures could prove 
beneficial to the long-term health of U.S. markets.

MARKET BEAT: SCORING 1ST QUARTER INVESTMENTS: MOST EVERYTHING BUT CASH NOT 
DOING VERY WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bears had their way with just about everything in the first quarter of 
1990: Except for a few pockets of strength in the stock market -- such as 
high-tech firms -- most financial investments have been lousy performers. 
Bonds, U.S. stocks, foreign stocks and precious metals all have fallen in 
value, on average. 
</P>
<P>
After so much disappointment, many investors may be rethinking their strategies 
for the rest of the year. And while one quarter doesn't necessarily make a 
trend, tallying your gains and losses quarterly at least helps keep you alert 
to opportunities -- and potential trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a look at the investment trends in the first quarter ending today, and 
the outlook: 
</P>
<P>
U.S. STOCKS: The surprise for many investors may be how little ground their 
stocks lost in the quarter, given January's plunge. Stocks rebounded strongly 
in March in the face of continued bearishness. Through Thursday, the Standard 
&amp; Poor's 500 index of major stocks was off just 2.7% on the year to date, 
on a total return basis. Total return measures the stocks' change in price, 
plus dividend income. On price alone, the S&amp;P was down 3.6%. That's like a 
$30 stock falling to $28.92. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller stocks -- the over-the-counter market -- have fared worse, off 4.0% for 
the quarter. But investors who zeroed in on high-tech stocks profited: The 
Hambrecht &amp; Quist growth-tech stock index, heavily weighted with technology 
companies, is up 3.9%, leading all investment categories in our tally. 
</P>
<P>
Despite some tech disappointments, such as software firm Oracle Systems' awful 
earnings released Tuesday, many experts say the tech stock rebound symbolizes a 
return to growth-stock investing in the 1990s. The market overall may look 
lousy, but stocks of companies promising strong earnings growth have been 
excellent gainers, notes Fred Applegate, president of Nicholas-Applegate 
Capital Management, a $2-billion San Diego-based money manager. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholas-Applegate's portfolio includes tech stocks such as Sun Microsystems 
and Autodesk, oil field service stocks such as Baker Hughes, and engineering 
stocks such as Irvine-based Fluor Corp. All of those stocks have been winners 
in the quarter, bucking the market decline. 
</P>
<P>
"At the end of last year we had a lot of stocks that we liked quite a bit. We 
continue to feel the same way today," Applegate said. Regardless of what 
happens to the broad market, he said, "We're expecting our portfolio to show 
20% to 25% earnings gains this year." That should continue to draw other 
investors to the stocks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But if your stock-picking isn't so hot, the market may be a dull prospect again 
in the second quarter, some analysts say. Chester Pado, a technical market 
analyst with Jefferies &amp; Co. in Los Angeles, said he has spent a lot of 
time on the phone with money managers lately and that few show much interest in 
buying stocks. If the broad market is going to advance, it needs those big 
players to get excited again, Pado notes. 
</P>
<P>
The big test in April will be first-quarter corporate earnings reports, 
expected to be disappointing in general. In theory, that's already built into 
current stock prices, Pado said. If earnings are worse than expected, however, 
stocks could be in for another rough ride. 
</P>
<P>
FOREIGN STOCKS: The average foreign stock mutual fund has lost about 6.7% in 
the quarter, largely because of the Japanese market's plunge. But investors who 
targeted specific markets did pretty well. A U.S. investor in the West German 
stock market, for example, is up about 8% for the quarter, even with foreign 
currency losses. Hong Kong is up about 5%. 
</P>
<P>
The best strategy for foreign investing remains the same, experts say: You 
should always have some money in foreign stocks, but spread it around. Mutual 
funds may be the smartest vehicle for most investors, despite the first quarter 
slump. 
</P>
<P>
BONDS: A rise in interest rates early in the quarter surprised everyone, and 
the bond market got slammed. Long-term U.S. Treasury bonds have dropped 3.8% in 
value for the quarter. Corporate "junk" bonds suffered less -- down 2.3%, 
according to Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s junk total return index. Junk bonds' 
high yields helped offset the sharp declines in bond prices. 
</P>
<P>
This week, a new fear surfaced: that Japanese investors have begun dumping 
T-bonds. The Japanese government is rumored to have called on investors to 
avoid U.S. investments. The goal would be to halt the dollar's rise versus the 
yen. If Japanese selling continues, bonds may be hit hard. 
</P>
<P>
The other risk is that interest rates rise further. John Connolly, Dean Witter 
Reynolds' chief market strategist, believes that "we have weathered the worst 
in both the bond and stock markets" and that rate fears are overblown. Even so, 
Robert Di Clemente, a Salomon Bros. economist, finds it hard to make a case for 
bonds in the second quarter. While rates may not rise, the chance of a sharp 
decline also is low, he said. That means little potential for big capital gains 
on existing bonds. "I don't think we'd be looking for any big windfall in the 
bond market," he said. 
</P>
<P>
CASH: When all else fails, money market funds and bank CDs at least guarantee 
some kind of return. If you bought a 1-year bank CD yielding 8.3% annually 
earlier this year, you earned one-fourth of that yield in the first quarter -- 
about 2.1%. It beats losing money. Just remember: Cash is a parking place. To 
earn healthy returns long term, you almost certainly have to be in stocks, 
bonds and other core investments. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly: Did someone know that Oracle Systems would announce disastrous 
earnings Tuesday? The software stock plunged $7.875 to $17.50 Wednesday, but 
the more interesting story is that some smart investors sold last week. Oracle 
fell from $28.125 on March 19 to $24.625 early this week, then leveled out -- 
until Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
FIRST-QUARTER INVESTMENT ROUNDUP 
</P>
<P>
How did your portfolio perform in the first quarter, which ends today? Probably 
not well, if you are near the average returns on most financial investments. It 
was a good quarter to be in small growth stocks and in cash investments but not 
much else. Here are estimated average total returns for key investments. Total 
return measures price change plus any dividend or interest income.

NHI Nelson Holdings International: The entertainment and vending company posted 
$4.5 million in net income for 1989, compared to a year-earlier loss of $9.4 
million, as the firm's film division scored gains from its various distribution 
rights to "When Harry Met Sally," "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" and 
"Prancer." 
</P>
<P>
Revenue for the year rose 8% to $108.6 million. Fourth-quarter net was $2.9 
million, compared to a year-earlier loss of $5.8 million. Toronto, Canada-based 
Nelson's videocassette operation was hurt in 1988 by a virtual collapse of the 
market for low-budget films, to which the company was heavily committed at the 
time.

L.A. Gear Inc.: The Los Angeles marketer of athletic shoes and apparel said 
first-quarter net income soared 159% to $13.9 million. Revenue jumped 183% to 
$187.3 million. The firm attributed the gains to the strong increase in 
incoming orders and the reception to new product lines introduced during the 
quarter.

JAPANESE STOCKS DIVE AGAIN; NIKKEI INDEX PLUMMETS 850.15 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Japanese stock market resumed its plunge early today: At midday, the Nikkei 
225-stock index was down 850.15 points -- or 2.8% -- to 30,176.01. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said initial profit taking prompted more investors to begin selling. 
However, trading overall was light, brokers said. 
</P>
<P>
Some traders said investors were reacting defensively to talk from overseas 
that a major foreign brokerage had predicted that the Nikkei would tumble 
another 3,000 points. "People are very skittish now," said a foreign broker. 
</P>
<P>
The decline early today accompanied a firming of the dollar in Tokyo trading to 
the 157-yen level. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Nikkei lost 237.41 points, or 0.75%, ending the day at 
31,026.16.

<P>
Stock prices posted their first loss of the week Thursday in light selling 
attributed to worries about rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, which had risen 39.41 points over the 
previous three sessions, dropped back 15.99 to 2,727.70. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 584 up, 861 down and 518 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 132.19 million shares, down from 
142.30 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in 
NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and 
in the over-the-counter market, totaled 159.53 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
Interest rates rose Thursday in the market for U.S. Treasury securities. Prices 
of the longest-term government bonds dropped more than $10 for each $1,000 in 
face value, putting their yields in the 8.59%-8.63% range. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the activity in bonds continued to reflect worries that an 
apparently budding revival in economic growth might tend to push rates higher 
in the months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers also noted a downturn for the dollar against the Japanese yen in 
foreign exchange. A recent rise in the dollar had been cited as a plus for U.S. 
interest rates, in part by serving to attract foreign investors into American 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's losers among the blue chips included Procter &amp; Gamble, down 5/8 
at 68 1/4; Coca-Cola, down 3/8 at 75 1/2; General Electric, down 3/8 at 64 1/2; 
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down 1/4 at 42 5/8, and International 
Paper, down 3/4 at 51 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
Prices fell in a stagnant session on London's Stock Exchange. The Financial 
Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 12 points, or 0.5%, at 2,263.0 at 
the close.

Bond Prices Drop as Dollar Declines 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices tumbled Thursday in tandem with a big drop by the dollar against 
the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond fell 1 5/16 points, or $13.13 for 
every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which rises when the price falls, soared 
to 8.58% from 8.46% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A wave of dollar-selling by speculators and central bank intervention sent the 
U.S. currency tumbling by more than 1.2%, or nearly 2 yen in Tokyo. Analysts 
said the dollar had gained 8% against the yen in the last month. 
</P>
<P>
"We started losing ground as dollar declined," said Kevin Flanagan, a money 
market economist with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. 
</P>
<P>
James Capra, senior vice president Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc., 
said a falling dollar pushes bond prices lower because it makes U.S. imports 
more expensive, raising inflationary fears. It also can indicate that Japanese 
investors are selling bonds and following up by selling dollars. Japanese 
institutions are large buyers of U.S. government securities. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said bond prices were depressed first by a declining dollar in 
overnight trading in Tokyo. The major cause was a report that Japan's Finance 
Ministry had advised insurance funds not to buy any more U.S. Treasury 
securities, which the ministry later denied. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the government reported that personal income rose 0.9% in 
February. The figure was higher than traders expected and interpreted as a 
negative for the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
Another negative was an announcement by Resolution Funding Corp., the 
government agency overseeing the thrift bailout, that it would sell 40-year 
bonds on April 10. That raised concerns about increasing the supply of 
securities on the market, although the agency did not say how large an auction 
it was planning. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of short-term 
government issues fell 1/8 point to 1/4 point, intermediate maturities declined 
1/2 point to 3/4 point, and long-term issues were down 29/32 point to 1 5/16 
point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a bond with a 
$1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8 7/16%, up from 81/4% late Tuesday.

Cocoa Prices Soar on Supply Concerns 
</P>
<P>
Cocoa futures prices surged to new seven-month highs Thursday on New York's 
Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange on persistent speculation that economic 
turmoil in Brazil and the Ivory Coast could cause significant supply 
disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, livestock and meat futures mostly were lower; grains and 
soybeans advanced; precious metals rose; and energy futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Cocoa futures settled $21 to $27 higher, with the contract for delivery in May 
at $1,190 per ton, the highest settlement of a near-month cocoa contract since 
Aug. 16. 
</P>
<P>
The rally followed a rise of $47 in the May contract on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Harry Schwartz of Cargill Investor Services Inc. said most of the 
buying was again by speculators and for the same reasons as on Wednesday: fears 
of supply disruptions from the world's two largest cocoa producers.

'A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM' BOASTS COMEDIC FLAIR, DEADLY CHARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The British black comedy lives -- in suburban New York. "A Shock to the System" 
(throughout San Diego County) has the same charm as the classic Alec Guinness 
comedies from the '50s. And, like those films, it stars a consummate 
professional at the peak of his comedic flair. 
</P>
<P>
As Graham Marshall, the marketing executive who turns murderous when he's 
passed up for promotion, Michael Caine has such a chuckling rapport with the 
audience that we smile in collusion the first time he speaks, in a voice-over 
narration. He turns the ghastliness of the film's premise into dry wit. We 
become his accomplices. 
</P>
<P>
When Graham is turned down to be the head of marketing development in favor of 
a sleek upstart (Peter Riegert), the first casualty is his suburban harridan 
wife Leslie (Swoosie Kurtz), who blames him for failing to honor her upward 
mobility. She's a nouveau riche screecher who is forever putting her overworked 
hubbie in hock. 
</P>
<P>
Beneath Graham's beleagueredness, we can sense the risible revenger; his many 
years in stir at the agency have given him the virtue of patience -- he savors 
his vengeance. As he lops off the impediments to his success, we eagerly await 
his next quarry. 
</P>
<P>
We're eager despite the fact that, aside from the performers, who also include 
Elizabeth McGovern and John McMartin, the film is too pokily paced. This was 
occasionally true of the Guinness comedies too, but their pokiness at least 
seemed deliberate. The inch-by-inch pace was part of their humor, as if, no 
matter how nutsoid the situations, British decorum reigned. The combination of 
Caine's Britishness and his WASPy suburban home base keeps "A Shock to the 
System" allied to its antecedents, but when the film shifts to Manhattan's 
high-rise corporate fast track, things get sluggish. 
</P>
<P>
The director, Jan Egleson, has directed a number of sensitive television 
features, most notably "The Dark End of the Street," and he has a rare gift for 
employing documentary naturalism in fictional settings. It's not a gift that 
always holds him in good stead here. Andrew Klavan's script, based on Simon 
Brett's novel, requires a more tart and askew treatment. Naturalism, in this 
context, is a comedy dampener. 
</P>
<P>
The joke in the material, of course, is that the film's cut-throat boardroom 
politics turn out to be literally cut-throat. Despite the naturalism, the 
boardroom scenes still represent some of the best modern high-stakes business 
satire in the movies. Peter Riegert has down pat the ruthless smoothness of his 
sharky upstart; his every line of dialogue is in corporate code -- a camouflage 
for his not-so-hidden agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Graham's capitulation to this mock-affable brat is also camouflaged in its own 
code. When, accompanied by his wide-eyed wife, he weekends at the new boss' 
suburban sprawl, his pained smiles, his dutiful lighting of the proffered 
cigar, carry a subversive charge. We know Graham is accumulating his hurts for 
the inevitable pay-back. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Caine's affability in this role isn't benign. In his most murderous 
moments there's a chilling cruelty at work. Caine has the technique and the 
charm to coast on his skills, but, even though his movies are not infrequently 
routine, he rarely is. "A Shock to the System" (rated R) may be lightweight, 
but it's connected to Caine's scary cameo as the ultra-sleazy crime lord in 
"Mona Lisa." Audiences who were accustomed to an accommodating, companionable 
Caine in that film were brought up short. The performance was a demonstration 
of his willingness to sour his geniality for the greater good. 
</P>
<P>
In "A Shock to the System," Caine must have welcomed the opportunity to rework 
the same killing terrain but from a loopier angle. What's remarkable is that 
you come away from the movie laughing at Graham's murderous indiscretions and 
yet you're frightened by them too. Caine makes you taste the ashes in this 
black comedy.

LAUTREC OFFERS A FEAST OF CONTRADICTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STERN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lautrec, for some unknown reason named for the French painter, is a ski 
lodge-style restaurant situated in a handsomely treed setting on Ventura 
Boulevard just west of Topanga Canyon Boulevard in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
As at a winter resort, many tables are positioned as if to take maximum 
advantage of a striking mountainside view, which it of course doesn't have. 
These are just two of the contradictions that seem to characterize this 
elaborately done-up effort at fancy -- but not formal -- dining. 
</P>
<P>
The principal discord is between the menu's claim of "Gourmet California 
Dining" and what it actually offers: a mixture of traditional butter-sauce 
dishes and some grilled items. California cooking, of course, assertively 
avoids heavy butter and cream sauces, but then the outdated word gourmet is a 
signal that the aspirations here aren't exactly trend-setting. 
</P>
<P>
Veal Oscar, for example, is so over-elaborate, it seems a parody of haute 
cuisine: Veal filets are sauteed in butter and covered with asparagus and bits 
of crab leg in a palate-numbing bearnaise sauce. Among the appetizers, clams 
Setoise, topped with bacon, crab and Parmesan cheese and oven-browned in their 
shells, is also too complicated. Individual flavors are lost, and the combined 
taste is strong but murky. However, the flavor of the excellent beef used in 
the carpaccio comes through . . . as long as you push aside most of the 
overpowering mustard sauce and capers it comes with. 
</P>
<P>
Two radically different appetizers were the most successful. The tuna sashimi 
plate (which might qualify as "California dining" but is really more Japanese) 
was an agreeable surprise: A thick patty of chopped maguro on a bed of greens 
was topped with what seemed to be flying-fish roe. Its simplicity was 
refreshing. More elaborate, but not excessively so, were the champignons en 
papillote. A melange of wild mushrooms, cooked in parchment with garlic, white 
wine and butter, had the satisfying richness of French country cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Between courses I had a few moments to ponder the restaurant's name. Although 
the walls bear a couple of reproductions of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec's works, 
those of Renoir and other painters are actually more prominently displayed. 
Before I could resolve this conundrum I was tasting an entree that confirmed 
that tradition -- at least well-handled tradition -- still has a valid place in 
the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
It was calf's liver sauteed in a garlic and shallot sauce, and it proved to be 
the dish that pleased me the most at this restaurant. This is great praise 
since liver is so easily mistreated. When cut thin, as it was at Lautrec, liver 
requires special care to keep it pink and moist and tasty. The kitchen came 
through here. 
</P>
<P>
Another success was the traditional roast rack of lamb (for two) with tarragon 
sauce. As my dinner companion said, "For $46, it had better be good." It was. 
But in truth, for that price I expected the rack to be served intact, the chops 
carved apart table-side. Instead, the two of us received three medium-sized 
chops on a plate with vegetables and potatoes. Even though we enjoyed the lamb, 
we were disappointed by its presentation. And by the vegetables: bland steamed 
mini-squashes and butter and cream-heavy scalloped potatoes (how 
anti-California cooking can you get?). What's more, this banal vegetable-potato 
arrangement never varied from plate to plate or from day to day. 
</P>
<P>
All this self-possessed and hardly light cooking kept me hoping that the whole 
place would magically be transported to some wooded mountainside so that the 
view beyond the trees would be of skiers on snowy slopes instead of cars on the 
boulevard. Still, Lautrec is handsome in its way -- reinterpreted early-century 
saloon with shiny brass fittings and thick etched glass partitions. And the 
service is attentive, the wine list interesting and the chairs comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended dishes: champignons en papillote, $9.95; calf's liver with garlic 
and shallots, $15.95; rack of lamb (for two), $46. 
</P>
<P>

lunch 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., dinner 5 to 10 p.m. Full bar. Valet parking. Major

TOO HIP FOR HER OWN GOOD?; 
</P>
<P>
SUDDENLY, MOTHER EARTH HAS BECOME THE CHIC CAUSE. WITH EARTH DAY'S 20TH 
ANNIVERSARY APPROACHING ON APRIL 22, SOME ACTIVISTS FEAR THE BARRAGE OF MEDIA 
AND MARKETING HYPE MAY HARM RATHER THAN HELP THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT. CAN 
THE EARTH SURVIVE EARTH DAY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Outside, searchlights sweep the sky. Inside, the glitterati listen in giddy 
anticipation. "Ladies and Gentlemen, in the category of Hippest Heavenly Body 
in the Galaxy, the winner is . . . the Planet Earth!!!!!" 
</P>
<P>
OK. It hasn't come to that. 
</P>
<P>
But almost. Suddenly, the Earth and eco-awareness have become a super-chic 
steamroller, flattening rap, Quayle-bashing and co-dependency as the national 
phenomenon most worthy of media fixation and celebrity cause-hopping. 
</P>
<P>
For folks who grew concerned about the fate of the planet back before Rachel 
Carson published the pivotal 1964 alarum "Silent Spring," the surprising spate 
of attention is encouraging, exhilarating, vindicating. 
</P>
<P>
But some also worry that as save-the-planet pandemonium builds toward a 
frenzied crescendo on April 22 with the gala 20th anniversary of Earth Day, a 
grumble will be heard across the land: "Enough, already! What's next?" 
</P>
<P>
Having had her 15 minutes of glory, will Mother Earth go the way of all fads? 
</P>
<P>
People who have been slaving to make Earth Day happen are appalled by such 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
But some also intimate a nagging fear that the public may indeed overdose on 
the E-Day publicity blitz, making it harder than ever for serious 
environmentalists to get their urgent message across. Earth Day may just prove 
counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question" that some people will use the hoopla surrounding Earth 
Day as a reason to dismiss the environmental crisis as an issue and personal 
responsibility as a solution, former Sen. Gaylord Nelson (D.-Wis.) concedes. 
</P>
<P>
But Nelson, a creator of the original Earth Day in 1970, recalls that the same 
thing happened then: "Anyone who didn't want to do anything (about 
environmental problems) called it a fad. Those people don't give a damn 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Because of that first Earth Day, though, "there are a hell of a lot more people 
who give a damn now," Nelson says. 
</P>
<P>
Comparing Earth Day, 1970, to Earth Day, 1990, however, is like comparing a 
back-yard football game to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Most observers trace Mother Earth's meteoric rise to fame to summer, 1988, when 
the ozone hole seared a startling image of environmental destruction in 
American minds and Atlantic waves washed bloody syringes up around the ankles 
of influential East Coasters. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, in January, 1989, Time magazine put the Earth on its cover as 
"Planet of the Year." Three months later, on March 24, the Exxon Valdez spilled 
its cargo on the waters of Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
And as 1990 rolled in, everyone starting wanting a piece of the eco-action. 
</P>
<P>
In January, the cover of Harper's Bazaar declared an "Earth Alert" and featured 
models who "support efforts to preserve our planet and rely on natural 
ingredients to maintain their own good looks," as well as mini-profiles of 
eco-activists such as Olivia Newton-John, the United Nation's first honorary 
environment ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
In March, Vogue magazine breathlessly followed suit, addressing the 
environmental crisis, in part, with a spread on hats made of moss and birch 
branches. 
</P>
<P>
Working Assets Money Fund recently introduced a special Earth Day IRA, and 
alert entrepreneurs nationwide are translating the new love for Mother Earth 
into a spate of products sporting conspicuous (and often suspicious) "Earth 
Friendly" or "Biodegradable" labels. 
</P>
<P>
"We're knee-deep in environmental hype," declared Minnesota Atty. Gen. Hubert 
Humphrey III, rolling a grocery cart filled with newly sprung "environmental" 
products before a recent public forum. 
</P>
<P>
His exhibit included a deodorant that claims to have "environmentally lighter 
propellant." 
</P>
<P>
The publishing industry has embraced Earth Day by printing enough books to 
topple a forest. The list of more than 50 titles tied to Earth Day begins with 
"50 Simple Things You Can Do to Save the Planet," escalates to "The 365 Ways to 
Save Our Planet Calendar," continues with "Save Our Planet: 750 Everyday Ways 
You Can Help Clean Up the Earth" and "The Green Lifestyle Handbook: 1001 Ways 
to Heal the Earth." 
</P>
<P>
Housework adviser Heloise also penned "Hints for a Healthy Planet." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hollywood has latched onto environmentalism with all the enthusiasm 
it had for "thirtysomething" clones a few seasons back. Several series, 
including "The Golden Girls," have woven environmentalist threads into their 
plots. Two networks are planning ecological "A-Team" type series. CNN is 
launching a cartoon ecology crusader named Capt. Planet, and a new troop of 
Muppets will soon jump into the Earth-saving fray. 
</P>
<P>
People who call the Earth Day office in Palo Alto to take "the Personal Green 
Pledge" are greeted by the voice of TV star Howie Mandel. At least 3,000 Earth 
Day events are scheduled nationwide, the capper being a two-hour television 
special featuring Bugs Bunny, Chevy Chase, Kevin Costner, Meryl Streep, Barbra 
Streisand, Robin Williams and E.T. the extraterrestrial. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental activists learned long ago that to compete with the stories of 
the day they needed to give their intricate issues sex appeal. 
</P>
<P>
As Doug Moss, editor of the environmental magazine E, puts it, "They had to 
dress up in chicken suits and jump off bridges to get someone out to write 
about ocean dumping." 
</P>
<P>
Now editors and producers who believed that the public couldn't stomach more 
than a few yearly sound bites on the environment are ready to shovel stories at 
what they see as an insatiable appetite. 
</P>
<P>
But some activists quietly worry about what is known as the MEGO -- "My Eyes 
Glaze Over" -- phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks after Earth Day, will editors yawn at stories about clear-cutting of 
rain forests? Will people find pollution passe? 
</P>
<P>
"That's a real fear many of us have -- that the public will get all hyped up 
and then sort of collapse," said Samuel P. Hays, a University of Pittsburgh 
history professor and author of "Beauty, Health and Permanence -- Environmental 
Politics in the United States, 1955-1985." 
</P>
<P>
"I think the real problem with (the media) is that environmental issues very 
quickly move from dramatic emotional episodes to complex hard-nosed problems. . 
. . I think it's hard for the media to make that shift," Hays said. 
</P>
<P>
Some environmentalists also are worried that the current climate of happy-faced 
hype, which affords anyone an opportunity to jump aboard the Earth Day 
bandwagon, will undermine the movement's credibility. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson is not among them. In the past few days, he has received calls from 
people in Washington, Oregon and Delaware warning him that "business is 
co-opting Earth Day," he said. Corporations with rotten environmental policies 
are using the day to give themselves a patina of legitimacy, the callers 
complained. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them, 'Well, most businesses have bad records, and obviously some are 
just after a public relations gimmick,' " Nelson says. 
</P>
<P>
But he also told them that "there are a lot of business people now who are 
concerned, and we ought to let those sinners repent. If every church in this 
country refused to admit sinners, they'd all be bankrupt." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson thinks Earth Day will raise people's awareness so high that they can no 
longer be snookered by companies that try to hide sordid deeds with slick 
public relations. 
</P>
<P>
Pollsters and trend watchers do report a dramatic surge in ecological 
awareness. A much quoted Gallup Poll, for example, indicates that 76% of 
American consumers think of themselves as environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
Anxiety is rising across the board, says Tom Miller of the Roper Organization. 
"The needle is definitely in the red danger zone." 
</P>
<P>
What the pollsters don't know is whether this concern will make people change 
their ways. 
</P>
<P>
Earth Day 1990 chairman Denis Hayes is unequivocal in his belief that they 
will. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to change the world," he says. "We want to replace the conspicuous 
consumption of the '80s with conspicuous frugality." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, not everyone will eagerly abandon the growth economy that has made 
them so comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of people's oxes are going to get gored," says analyst Hazel Henderson, 
an economics consultant to 30 countries. Her "Politics of the Solar Age" 
preaches an ecological restructuring of the global economy. 
</P>
<P>
But if Earth Day persuades people to vote in environmentally responsible ways, 
a major change in the way the U.S. economy works may not be far behind, she 
believes. 
</P>
<P>
She knows, however, that the forces that focused the spotlight on the 
environment can also snap it off. 
</P>
<P>
"The media are notoriously sheep-like," she says. As publishers and producers 
start getting pressure from advertisers they may abruptly "declare that the 
crisis is now over." 
</P>
<P>
They'll do so at their own risk, warns Sen. Tim Wirth (D.-Colo). 
</P>
<P>
"Politics is driven in part by a sense of outrage," says Wirth. He thinks 
America's sense of outrage about the environment has almost reached "critical 
mass" -- a point at which major changes start to occur. 
</P>
<P>
The public, Wirth says, is beginning to demand more sophisticated coverage of 
issues such as the recent weakening of the Clean Air Act. Even with its 
star-studded aura, Earth Day will increase the public's outrage about such 
environmental setbacks, he says. 
</P>
<P>
But not all activists are happy with the glitzy way eco-awareness is being 
packaged. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental journalist Sara Pacher does not begrudge the celebrities who 
attract attention to the Earth's woes. But she does think that the growing 
trivialization of those problems may have a backlash. 
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, Pacher and others say that for some time the staff of 
Mother Earth News, herself included, resisted pressure to replace its 
traditional nuts-and-bolts environmentalism with celebrity-oriented features 
and "fluff." ("They refused to let us use the word manure" in the magazine.) 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, after completing the magazine's April 20th anniversary issue, 15 
staffers were laid off and the owners moved the magazine from North Carolina to 
New York City. According to the new editor, the old staff had "lost touch." 
</P>
<P>
But the final effort to which they contributed will receive a send-off 
befitting the eco-trend era. 
</P>
<P>
In his introduction to the issue, the new editor announces that on Earth Day, 
the entire contents of the magazine -- including messages from Jimmy Buffet, 
Pope John Paul II and Ann Landers -- will be broadcast into space from a 
transmitter on Mt. Everest, to "travel through the universe forever."

DAVID BROWER; 
</P>
<P>
FROM DAMS TO THE GREEN CROSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a while, David Brower, the man who defeated the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers' plan to turn the Grand Canyon into a lake, was himself a dam builder 
of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
Brower was 6 when he first sloshed into the clear waters of Strawberry Creek, 
in the Berkeley hills, and temporarily arrested its flow with twigs and leaves. 
</P>
<P>
The stream carved a deep impression through his young consciousness. Already, 
though, development was eating away at the open spaces of the UC Berkeley 
campus and surrounding hills. 
</P>
<P>
One day, mud from the construction of a new stadium clotted Strawberry Creek. 
</P>
<P>
Watching his childhood landscape destroyed "made a bloody conservationist out 
of me," says Brower, 77. 
</P>
<P>
When Brower was 8, his mother, a devout outdoorswoman, lost her sight. Brower 
developed his powers of observation by describing the natural world for his 
mother on their trips to the high Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
Later, as a young man climbing in those mountains, he observed that the natural 
world was increasingly threatened. He decided to fight the forces that were 
destroying the landscape. 
</P>
<P>
By the first Earth Day, in 1970, he had been in the trenches of 
environmentalism for the better part of four decades. 
</P>
<P>
This Earth Day, Brower -- who has fought many battles to preserve the Grand 
Canyon, including the notable "Sistine Chapel" campaign in the mid-'60s -- will 
speak on the Capitol Mall in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
He striving to make the traditionally white, middle-class environmental 
movement more multicultural and international. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, he will take his campaign to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he has begun crusading for an idea introduced by Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev at a recent global conference: an "international Green Cross," to 
heal the Earth's environmental wounds. 
</P>
<P>
"When I speak now, I ask audiences how many of them would be willing to commit 
a year to an International Green Cross?" Brower says. "Half the hands go up." 
</P>
<P>
For these Green troops to win the war to save the world will take radical new 
battle strategies, Brower believes. 
</P>
<P>
But then, "conventional wisdom hasn't created anything. Dreams do. Let's follow 
our dreams." The environmental movement, he says, needs "fewer economists and 
more poets." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NOTABLE 
</P>
<P>
Helped to create national parks in Kings Canyon, North Cascades, the Redwoods, 
Cape Cod, Fire Island and Point Reyes and to preserve wilderness on San 
Gorgonio and other mountains. He has just written his autobiography, and 
received the Carey-Thomas Award for creative publishing.

NEW CHALLENGE TO FASHION'S 'OLD GUARD'; 
</P>
<P>
CREATING EXCITING STYLES WITH REALISTIC PRICES IS THE GOAL OF NEW YORK'S YOUNG 
DESIGNERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY HAWKINS, Hawkins, a free-lance writer based in New York, frequently 
contributes to The Times fashion pages. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They're young, in their late 20s and early 30s. They've learned fashion is a 
business as well as a creative endeavor, and their clothes are seldom priced 
more than $500. While they're not out to dethrone New York's best-known 
designers, their more realistic prices and modern sense of style are making 
strong impressions on retailers and fashion-conscious shoppers across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
They're New York's new guard, snapping at the hallowed heels of Seventh 
Avenue's old guard, a group so established we know them by their first names: 
Geoffrey, Bill, Oscar, Calvin and Ralph. And members of this new guard -- who 
will be showing their women's fall collections here next week -- have definite 
ideas about where New York fashion is going in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
The complete list of significant newcomers is about a dozen names long, but 
some of the strongest are Rebecca Moses, Gordon Henderson (see related story), 
Jennifer George, Michael Leva and Carmelo Pomodoro. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the established designers who've built an image over a 10- to 20-year 
period may be afraid to lose the identity they've achieved," says Rebecca 
Moses, 31. She has been designing under her own name since 1981, and three 
years ago she added a second label, the Rebecca Moses Collection. 
</P>
<P>
"My contemporaries aren't pigeonholed yet," she continues. "And I don't have a 
look that's so identifiable yet. I think customers want something they don't 
expect. It's really important that clothes are wearable, not weird. But they 
have to be exciting." 
</P>
<P>
For fall, Moses has given her collection, which retails for about $185 to $730, 
a Sherlock Holmes theme. There are caped coats over shorts; lots of beaded, 
pearled or quilted vests, and checks and plaids -- "with intellectual 
sexiness." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Henderson emphasizes affordability, too. "It's not only that we're a new 
guard of American fashion," says the 33-year-old Henderson, who opened for 
business a year ago. "This is a really talented group of designers going after 
what they believe in -- whimsical, thoughtful clothes people can wear and 
afford. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, the older, established designers still seem to be in the same category 
as the Europeans. They seem to emulate them. Their look is established. It's 
expected. It's the young people who are taking chances. The problem has been 
that American designers haven't believed in American fashions. This new group 
does believe." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson has built his style on basic American sportswear and active 
sportswear shapes. For fall, he's showing '50s campus, stadium, lodge and 
homecoming looks, priced from about $95 to $400. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer George, 30, has had her own business for three years. She got started 
just after Stephen Sprouse, the hottest name among younger New York designers 
in the '80s, went bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a group of us who are less flash-in-the-pan than the crowd from five 
years ago. They came on so strong. We're mindful that fashion is a business, 
not just a glamorous, fun thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the older generation of New York designers she and her colleagues 
are muscling in on, George says: "There's nothing to negate about the 
established designers. They have a market -- a customer who is aging with them. 
But I think there's room for a little bit more." 
</P>
<P>
The "more" from George for fall is what she describes as "a very modern 
collection, but underline the Mod part." She offers lots of short shorts worn 
with ribbed tights and short, heeled boots, and a wide range of colors, from 
brick to olive to persimmon. 
</P>
<P>
And she also has a formal look. "You have to understand my interpretation of 
evening wear. It's not Bill Blass. I do a taffeta apron over short shorts and 
short boots. To me, that's not classic." Her separates retail for about $300 
each. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a million different names for us -- the new generation," says 
Carmelo Pomodoro, 34, whose Seventh Avenue business is three years old. "We're 
at the point where we have enough experience behind us from both the fashion 
and business side, and we're ready to take a leap. It's inevitable that a group 
like us would get attention." 
</P>
<P>
As a member of the new guard, he has just one complaint about the other: "Some 
established designers may have lost their spontaneity." 
</P>
<P>
Pomodoro has two themes for fall: chic survival, which includes distressed and 
sporty looks made luxurious with fabric and detailing, and '60s inspired granny 
chic, including crocheted shawls, chenille, lace and brocade. His prices range 
from $200 to $600. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Leva, 29, has been in business since the spring of 1986. He talks about 
clothes as product. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just about fantasy but clothes being useful, exciting and beautiful 
-- they do a lot and say a lot. My theme for fall is simplicity of construction 
because I want clothes to be beautiful, but also affordable." 
</P>
<P>
For fall, Leva says he has a "slightly" Renaissance theme for his collection, 
which retails for about $150 to tunics, dark colors, bloomers and swingy shapes 
inspired by men's wear from that era. But he describes the look as modern. 
</P>
<P>
"I've also used a lot of zippered looks because they're racy and fun -- very 
'jet' and easy." 
</P>
<P>
Leva says his generation has one thing in common that sets it apart from its 
predecessors: "We're all very different in what we do but similar in the sense 
of affordability." He adds: "Our clothes are a little more real." 
</P>
<P>
He agrees with others who predict the two guards will peacefully co-exist. "I 
don't think we'll takeover the market. There's plenty of room." 
</P>
<P>
Store buyers are well aware of the potential of this new generation. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a new strong group in New York, and we carry a lot of them," says 
Ginny Sidorick, fashion director of Saks Fifth Avenue in Beverly Hills. "For 
the most part, I see them as a new price line. You get a lot for your money. 
And it's fashion forward -- more clean, sleek lines. They are a challenge to 
the old guard because everybody is price conscious today." 
</P>
<P>
She adds: "I don't think there's a conflict with L.A. designers. I think 
there's room for all of them." 
</P>
<P>
I. Magnin's Wilmer Weiss agrees. "We're very excited about the new group of New 
York designers and have been using them for a couple of seasons now. They're 
filling in a gap in the market that occurred when prices soared for designer 
clothes. But I don't see it as the new versus the old group. They complement 
each other." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's the same customer," says Fred Hayman Beverly Hills' Karen 
Schneider. "I think you need both -- the old guard as well as the young, 
spirited designers. We need them to attract a younger clientele. They're 
salable, innovative, young and, at the same time, commercial without being 
boring." 
</P>
<P>
And how does the old guard feel about this new challenge to their supremacy on 
Seventh Avenue? 
</P>
<P>
"It's a whole other spirit," says Geoffrey Beene. "They become more of a 
challenge to stimulate. The energy is needed as a catalyst for doing one's best 
work. The more the merrier." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Blass concurs. "I think they all have substance. They'll be around. 
Believe me, it's welcome. They have more validity. Others we've seen in recent 
years have made huge impressions and then haven't lasted long. This is 
definitely a new, solid generation."

A TWO-SIDED TIFF SINKS 'TRIANGLE'; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: 'CREATIVE DIFFERENCES' BETWEEN CBS OFFICIAL AND PRODUCER RESULT IN 
SHELVING OF SHOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Just eight days ago, CBS issued a press release announcing the April 18 debut 
of a new drama series, "Triangle," starring Bruce Boxleitner and Jameson 
Parker. 
</P>
<P>
But suddenly this week -- following a disagreement over creative control and an 
angry meeting involving a top CBS official and the producer of the show -- 
"Triangle" was dropped by the network as production was winding up on the third 
of six planned episodes. 
</P>
<P>
"The series has been discontinued due to creative differences," said CBS, 
adding that it "will not be presented on the network." 
</P>
<P>
The shutdown came Tuesday for "Triangle," in which Boxleitner was a detective, 
Parker a police chief and Daphne Ashbrook the editor of a local newspaper -- 
and the woman of both their dreams since school days. 
</P>
<P>
"Triangle" originated under the previous CBS regime of Kim LeMasters, the 
network's entertainment president who was replaced at the end of last year by 
Jeff Sagansky. 
</P>
<P>
Co-executive producer Philip DeGuere, whose credits include "Simon &amp; Simon" 
and "Max Headroom," said in a phone interview that he is upset with both CBS 
and Columbia Pictures Television, which he felt did not protect him from 
network interference. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday of last week, said DeGuere, he showed CBS officials "the first 
episode in rough-cut form." 
</P>
<P>
DeGuere said Peter Tortorici, senior vice president of program planning for CBS 
-- and Sagansky's No. 2 man -- "then proceeded to blather at me about things." 
</P>
<P>
"I got angry (at Tortorici) and told him that if I had my way, I would never 
see his face again. And I don't think I will." 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, said DeGuere, he was removed from the show. 
</P>
<P>
"When I informed them I had creative control, they fired me and stopped 
production on the show," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tortorici acknowledges the volatile meeting, but has a different version. 
</P>
<P>
Like other CBS officials, he said he was disappointed with the results of the 
show, particularly because the third-place network was looking forward to it 
for a possible ratings boost. It was to have run in the "Wiseguy" 10-11 p.m. 
Wednesday time slot. 
</P>
<P>
"But unfortunately," Tortorici said Thursday, "both we and the studio concluded 
after looking at the material that it was not what we were looking for. 
Basically, what we were looking for was romance, some real romantic tension 
between the three people." 
</P>
<P>
As for the angry words, Tortorici said he was displeased with what he described 
as DeGuere's criticism of "people who work for me" who were in the room. 
</P>
<P>
He said the criticism was also "abusive to me . . . and at that point I walked 
out of the room. I didn't engage in any name-calling. There was nothing to be 
accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
Added Tortorici: "In a creative business, you expect that people are going to 
be passionate about their work, and have a right to be. That has to be 
respected. This was an unfortunate incident. But the reason for not going ahead 
with the series was not because of one particular incident." 
</P>
<P>
Tortorici said the three episodes probably cost about $1 million each, and 
other preparation undoubtedly will add to the financial loss if the show is 
scrapped entirely. While CBS said it would not present "Triangle," Tortorici 
added that it was being pulled "at this time." 
</P>
<P>
Columbia TV declined comment on the entire matter, said spokesman Don 
DeMesquita. 
</P>
<P>
DeGuere, who also produced a new 1980s version of "The Twilight Zone" and was 
co-creator of "Triangle" with James Crocker, wrote the April 18 episode that 
was to launch the new series. 
</P>
<P>
He said he felt Columbia was supposed to tell CBS that he was in charge of the 
series. "The network doesn't have creative control over things like 
performance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he added that when the new CBS regime took over, "Sagansky ordered them to 
completely retool the show" and "change the concept." 
</P>
<P>
When he tried to put up a fight on the show, "They threw me off it," he said. 
"I have to go away for a while and recuperate from this terrible experience." 
</P>
<P>
CBS said that it will fill the April 18 slot with a remaining episode of 
"Wiseguy" which it had intended to use as a cliffhanger, and that special 
programming probably would be used in following weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Parker previously worked for DeGuere as A.J. Simon in "Simon &amp; Simon." 
Boxleitner starred with Kate Jackson in "Scarecrow and Mrs. King." Ashbrook was 
featured in such series as "Hooperman," "Fortune Dane" and "Our Family Honor."

<P>
John Flansburgh, half of the duo They Might Be Giants, stood on the stage of 
the Ventura Theatre this week, resembling a young Dan Aykroyd as he did a 
parody of a rocker exhorting the crowd: 
</P>
<P>
"Mumble-mumble-something HAVE A GOOD TIME TONIGHT?!" 
</P>
<P>
The youthful fans who were crammed against the stage responded appropriately, 
screaming and stomping. 
</P>
<P>
But then John Linnell, the other Giant, dryly asked the fans, "Did you hear 
what John said? He said, 'Are you ambivalent about having a good time tonight?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
It didn't matter. Many of the fans screamed and stomped at that. And they 
screamed and stomped when the duo sang its witty ditties with lines like "My 
story's infinite / like the Longines Symphonette" set in sophisticated, funny 
melodies that tend to turn pop traditions inside-out. And they shelled out 20 
bucks a pop for T-shirts that declared the two less-than-Greek-god guys as 
"Brooklyn's Ambassadors of Love." 
</P>
<P>
So you gotta wonder: Is this stuff going over the fans' heads? Might They Might 
Be Giants be just a couple of overeducated, whiny-voiced smart alecks who -- as 
some detractors maintain -- are too clever by half? 
</P>
<P>
Well? 
</P>
<P>
"That's it! The interview's over," declared Linnell when that assessment was 
posed before the show at a nearby Thai restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
He was joking. But both Giants made it clear that -- while not exactly denying 
their image -- they take offense at the implications. 
</P>
<P>
"As you become (more popular), you don't want to be sneering people, so you 
keep yourselves in check," said Flansburgh, 29, noting that TMBG is riding a 
wave of increasing popularity. Its new album "Flood," its first for a major 
label, has boosted it from club status to the theater-concert level. The act 
plays the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano tonight and the Wiltern Theatre on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"But being considered smart alecks is a negativity and we don't want that." 
</P>
<P>
Continued Linnell, 30, "That's not part of what we're doing, and if we're 
sarcastic or ironic, that's a way of dealing with our nervousness." 
</P>
<P>
But on the other hand, the pair certainly does not downplay the smart side of 
the image. "We have a lot of ideas going through our songs in an era when 
having no ideas is the ideal," said Flansburgh. "You have to be awake, and that 
may be too much for some people." 
</P>
<P>
Said Linnell, "We're not trying to be smarter than other people, but there's 
this major American trend that is anti-intellectual, especially in popular 
music. It's popular not to have an idea between your ears." 
</P>
<P>
Ideas they do have -- by the busload. The 80 or so songs they've released in 
their four years as a recording act show no dearth of ideas. In the 70-minute 
set Tuesday, the pair -- Flansburgh on guitar, Linnell mostly on accordion, 
with tapes to fill it out -- showed off the widened range of their newer 
material, from the absurd philosophy of "Whistling in the Dark" to the profound 
commentary of "Your Racist Friend." 
</P>
<P>
And they apparently have enough confidence in their material that they've now 
pretty much left behind the props and antics of their past in favor of a 
relatively straight-ahead presentation -- though the three metronomes on stands 
behind them (which actually served as percussion on several songs) provided a 
loose connection to their arty background. And by the end of the concert it 
seemed that this was not going over the fans' heads, but that -- almost despite 
themselves -- the Giants have legitimately connected with an audience that sees 
them as more than just clever. And they're not necessarily your standard rock 
fans: During one encore, a young man climbed onto the stage, not to do the 
usual geeky dancing or stage diving. All he wanted was to stand there and blow 
soap bubbles. 
</P>
<P>
He might be a giant, too.

A FILMMAKER'S STRUGGLE TO CAPTURE THE 'REAL' VIETNAM;

<P>
If you think Hollywood seems obsessed with films about the Vietnam War, 
consider Dang Nhat Minh. 
</P>
<P>
Minh, who is secretary general of the filmmakers' union of Vietnam, has devoted 
six of his last seven features to the war. His latest, "Only One Person Remains 
Alive," is a two-part, made-for-television melodrama about a dissident American 
doctor who is tracked down by a palpably evil U.S. military command in Saigon 
and loses his heart to a gorgeous Viet Cong cadre. So far, no calls from the 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
In the film, the hero (played by a Eurasian actor because of the lack of 
Vietnamese-speaking Europeans) is also a victim of the war. 
</P>
<P>
"He is not our enemy," Minh said over coffee in his cramped office. 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese people, he said, have seen the real face of war up close. As a 
film audience, they will not accept "a false face," although Vietnamese cinema, 
like much of Asian drama, is fairly histrionic. 
</P>
<P>
Minh has become a dedicated student of American films about the war, although 
in general he doesn't much care for them. 
</P>
<P>
"My sense," he said, "is that they describe a false aspect of the war. 
Vietnamese are seen as animals." 
</P>
<P>
He likes "Apocalypse Now" and "Platoon," the latter so much so that war scenes 
from it have been included in his latest film. At the bottom of his list are 
"Rambo" and "Full Metal Jacket." 
</P>
<P>
" 'Platoon' was close to a documentary," he said, "even though we don't look 
like that (director Oliver Stone used Filipino actors to portray Vietnamese)." 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Minh won a Special Jury Award at the Hawaii International Film 
Festival for "When the Tenth Month Comes," a war film that shows no fighting. 
</P>
<P>
His other films have touched on some sensitive issues in a country still 
governed by an orthodox Communist system. 
</P>
<P>
"The Young Girl in the River," for example, focuses on the troubles of a 
prostitute after the war, a time when such women were being sent to 
re-education camps. She is betrayed by a Communist apparatchik whose life she 
had saved, and a former officer of the South Vietnamese regime turns out to be 
her savior. 
</P>
<P>
While hardly earthshaking in the West, the film raised eyebrows in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to make films through the eyes of an individual," Minh said, reproaching 
American filmmakers for taking what he regards as the prototype approach of 
American good guy and Vietnamese villain. 
</P>
<P>
Born and raised in South Vietnam, Minh, who is now 51, moved with his parents 
to Hanoi in 1950. His father, a physician, founded a resistance medical school 
and was killed by American bombs. 
</P>
<P>
While describing himself as self-taught in the movie business, Minh received 
formal cinema training in Bulgaria in 1976. In 1985, he won a scholarship to 
France, where he became enthralled but was obliged to work on a shoestring 
budget, which is evident in even his most ambitious projects. Yet even on a 
tiny budget he manages to capture his country at its most poignant. 
</P>
<P>
Minh said his greatest ambition is to collaborate with Americans on a war film, 
using Vietnamese actors in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"Both sides will invest materially and spiritually in such a film," he said. 
"To be the finest film about Vietnam, it will have to be made by Vietnamese and 
Americans together." 
</P>
<P>
Even Minh occasionally tires of the war. He said the Vietnamese people have 
moved on to other interests. 
</P>
<P>
"Peasants don't want to see films about peasants with water buffalo," he said. 
"Nothing is as familiar to the Vietnamese as the war."

ART FARMER'S FLUEGELHORN OF PLENTY

<P>
Elario's, the restaurant and jazz club that tops off the Summer House Inn in La 
Jolla, again demonstrated its resourceful booking policy by bringing in Art 
Farmer for a two week stand. The Vienna-based master of the fluegelhorn will be 
skipping Los Angeles this time around. 
</P>
<P>
Farmer has virtually defined a position for fluegelhorn in jazz. The spiritual 
beauty he brings to it is a reflection of his personality: mellow, relaxed and 
sometimes gentle, especially when the vehicle is a ballad like Mal Waldron's 
"Soul Eyes" or the neglected Ellington tune "What Am I Here For." 
</P>
<P>
When he aims at a higher level of intensity, Farmer occasionally switches to 
the trumpet, which he plays both open ("Embraceable You") and muted ("Bags 
Groove"). 
</P>
<P>
His rhythm section consisted of Bob Magnusson, that most supple of bassists; 
Jim Plank, a steady and reliable drummer; and a promising pianist, Randy 
Porter. Only 26, Porter fits well into this context and is familiar with such 
standards as John Coltrane's "Moment's Notice" and Fats Navarro's "Nostalgia." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's opening was unique, since Farmer's first set was preceded by two 
film presentations. One was a sampler of 15 segments from "Club Date," a 
public-TV series shot at San Diego's KPBS-TV studio. Featuring Bud Shank, James 
Moody, Joe Pass and others, the sampler was a fascinating cornucopia. It was 
followed by a full half hour Art Farmer show taped during his visit here last 
year with a quintet, featuring saxophonist Clifford Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Farmer continues at Elario's five days a week through April 8. That he is not 
to be seen in person in Los Angeles is regrettable. LEONARD FEATHER

NBC GIVES FOUR COMEDIES, ONE DRAMA A SPRING TRYOUT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
NBC will add four new comedies and one new drama to its prime-time schedule in 
April, expanding the list of new series receiving spring tryouts for possible 
inclusion on the network's fall schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The new comedies are "Carol and Company," "Down Home," "13 East" and "Working 
Girl." 
</P>
<P>
The drama is "Shannon's Deal," which made its debut as a two-hour movie pilot 
and returns as a one-hour series. Spring series which already have been added 
to the schedule include "A Family for Joe," "FM" and "Wings." 
</P>
<P>
The network also will announce "an innovative plan" to launch "The Seinfeld 
Chronicles" within the next 10 days. The half-hour show stars comedian Jerry 
Seinfeld in a format that blends traditional sitcom with Seinfeld's stand-up 
comedy routines. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the comedies will premiere Saturday, April 14. "Carol and Company," 
which stars Carol Burnett in a different character role each week, will air at 
10 p.m. following previews on the two previous Saturdays at 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Down Home," which stars Judith Ivey, will debut at 10:30 p.m., following a 
preview April 12 at 10:30 p.m. "Hunter," currently seen in the 10-11 p.m. 
Saturday slot, will move to Mondays at 9 p.m. on April 16. "13 East," which 
stars Diana Bellamy and was telecast last summer, returns with new episodes at 
8:30 p.m. "Amen," currently telecast in that slot, will go on hiatus until May. 
</P>

HOWARD ROSENBERG: ARE THOSE TV MOVIES REALLY INFERIOR TO THEATRICAL RELEASES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Are cinema and TV movies not only separate but unequal? 
</P>
<P>
Some people think so. Take Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, a couple of snappy guys 
who put out a crackerjack movie-review show that remains the standard for the 
genre. If only they'd ease up on gratuitously slapping television, the medium 
that put them on easy street and keeps them there. 
</P>
<P>
Their putdown of the small screen usually goes something like this: A movie is 
flat, uninteresting, without redeeming value and the product of minor minds? 
Then it's exactly like a TV movie. An actor is a block of wood? Then he must be 
some TV actor in over his head with the big boys while trying to step up in 
class. 
</P>
<P>
From their comments, it's obvious that Siskel and Ebert watch no TV beyond the 
show that bears their names. So their denigration seems to be misplaced when 
you consider what they encounter "at the movies." You know, the cinema, where 
probably 75% of the new releases are creative stinkers that expand pollution, 
not entertainment? 
</P>
<P>
This anti-TV bias also extends to the print world, where Leonard Maltin's 
annual "TV Movie and Video Guide" employs separate ratings systems for 
theatrical and TV movies. They remind you of segregated drinking fountains for 
whites and blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Maltin's book rates theatrical movies by stars (four stars being the highest 
rating) while designating TV movies generally as either "below average," 
"average" or "above average." Thus, for example, "Promise," an incredibly good 
TV movie that ran on CBS in 1986, is rated here as merely "above average" at 
the end of a review that also labels it an "outstanding special." 
</P>
<P>
"Outstanding" for TV, apparently, but only "above average" compared with 
theatrical movies. Oh, please! 
</P>
<P>
TV automatically inferior to cinema? Hardly. They're separate, all right, but 
also equal -- equally bad and equally good. It's true that "Lawrence of Arabia" 
would have lost more than just a little as a movie of the week. But it's also 
true that the best of TV is as much an art form as the best of the big screen. 
</P>
<P>
If NBC's "Casablanca" with David Soul fell, uh, somewhat short of the original, 
for example, so did the theatrical movie version of "Pennies From Heaven" with 
Steve Martin yield infinitely fewer pleasures than the earlier BBC version with 
Bob Hoskins that aired on PBS. 
</P>
<P>
As timid as TV surely is, moreover, it is still generally bolder than 
theatrical movies when it comes to dramatizing controversial topics. And what 
about accuracy? Yes, the fibbing that occurs in some TV docudramas is 
offensive, but no more so than the fictionalizing of some theatrical movies 
that are sold as factual. 
</P>
<P>
Although "Born on the Fourth of July" is a swell film whose scope demands a big 
screen and a big sound unavailable on TV, for example, it's unlikely that the 
largest of its fictional embellishments on the life of Ron Kovic would have 
been tolerated had it been a TV movie. Nor would the obvious revisionist 
history of "Mississippi Burning" have made the final cut as a TV movie despite 
the film's other fine attributes. 
</P>
<P>
Theatrical movies are not necessarily even the first on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Nineteen years before the release of the now-running "Mountains of Moon," an 
excellently rendered NBC/BBC/Time-Life miniseries titled "The Search for the 
Nile" offered a far more vivid, layered and compelling picture of explorer Sir 
Richard Burton -- despite the small screen's limits in portraying Africa -- 
than the one now available in movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
Featuring Oscar-winning performances by Daniel Day-Lewis and Brenda Fricker, 
"My Left Foot" did not reach theaters until almost 20 years after PBS first 
aired Craig Gilbert's brilliant documentary "The Triumph of Christy Brown." The 
movie is stunning work. But the documentary film celebrated the accomplishments 
and captured the spirit and humanity of this remarkable Irishman in a different 
and equally stirring and valid way. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the presence of Meryl Streep, meanwhile, the recent theatrical movie 
"She Devil" was banal not only in its own right, but especially so in 
comparison to the scintillating earlier BBC production, "The Life and Loves of 
a She Devil," that was based on the same novel and aired on the Arts &amp; 
Entertainment network. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that, percentage-wise, TV soars as often as theatrical movies, 
stage, music and books. TV just seems to be trailing the pack because of its 
pervasiveness. Most of us don't see every movie or play, hear every song or 
read every book. For better or for worse, however, we do spend a much greater 
portion of our lives in front of the small screen. 
</P>
<P>
Should TV improve? Of course, just as the other arts should. So, enough with 
the TV abuse, already. The balcony is closed.

MCKINZIE GUILTY OF LOOTING S&amp;L; 
</P>
<P>
FRAUD: FAIRY TALE ENDS AS JURY CONVICTS EX-NORTH AMERICA OFFICIAL ON 
RACKETEERING AND CONSPIRACY CHARGES. COLLAPSE OF HER INSTITUTION COST TAXPAYERS 
$120 MILLION.

Janet Faye McKinzie was convicted Thursday of looting the now-defunct North 
America Savings &amp; Loan, ending what had once been a fairy tale existence of 
Rolls-Royces, $1,000 cocktail dresses and lavish parties with entertainment 
provided by the likes of Sammy Davis Jr. 
</P>
<P>
A jury of six men and six women deliberated eight days in U.S. District Court 
before finding McKinzie guilty of 22 of 26 counts including racketeering, 
conspiracy, bank fraud, wire fraud and interstate transportation of stolen 
property. She faces up to 175 years in jail. 
</P>
<P>
McKinzie, 40, wept as the verdict was read. 
</P>
<P>
During the eight-week trial, defense attorney Richard (Racehorse) Haynes 
portrayed McKinzie as a helpless victim duped into carrying out the fraud 
because she was being pumped full of prescription drugs by the thrift's 
chairman, Duayne Christensen. 
</P>
<P>
Christensen mysteriously died in a car accident only nine hours before federal 
regulators took over the thrift in 1987. The former dentist was named an 
unindicted co-conspirator in McKinzie's case. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors had portrayed the couple as a modern-day Bonnie and Clyde, 
stealing millions of dollars from North America to enrich themselves. 
</P>
<P>
They each had a Rolls-Royce -- hers with the license plate XTACI. And McKinzie 
spent hundreds of thousands of dollars at Neiman-Marcus, much of it after 
regular store hours as a preferred customer. FBI agents found that the pair had 
spent $125,000 on a gold eagle statue, $18,500 on a letter opener and $500 on a 
gold paper clip. 
</P>
<P>
McKinzie's 37th birthday in 1986 was celebrated with a dinner for hundreds of 
guests at the Newport Beach Marriott. Sammy Davis Jr. was on hand to sing a mix 
of tunes including "Happy Birthday." 
</P>
<P>
McKinzie officially was a consultant to North America. She was also 
Christensen's business manager and confidante. Prosecutors, however, say she 
was the thrift's de facto chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of North America, one of several Orange County thrifts to fail in 
recent years, eventually cost taxpayers more than $120 million. Thursday's 
verdict was hailed by regulators. 
</P>
<P>
"The North America case was probably one of the top three investigations in the 
last five years in terms of how egregious the fraud was," said William Davis, 
chief deputy of the California Department of Savings and Loan. "Justice finally 
prevailed. I'm delighted." 
</P>
<P>
McKinzie is the first person to be convicted under the RICO statute -- the 
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act -- in connection with a 
savings and loan failure on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors employed the RICO statute so the government could try to 
claim the proceeds from Christensen's $10-million life insurance policy, which 
named McKinzie as sole beneficiary. 
</P>
<P>
The jury in the McKinzie case is scheduled to reconvene next month to decide if 
she must forfeit that money to the U.S. Treasury Department. The money is 
currently being held in a government-controlled escrow account. 
</P>
<P>
Because the jury still has some unfinished business, both prosecutors and 
defense attorneys were reluctant to say much Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Attys. David J. Schindler and Paul L. Seave would only say they 
were pleased with the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Michael M. Essmyer -- Haynes' co-counsel -- expressed disappointment. "Ms. 
McKinzie's judgment was impaired by the prescription drugs to the extent that 
under the law she should have been found not guilty," Essmyer said. 
</P>
<P>
McKinzie had pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, a highly unusual plea in 
a white-collar-crime case. 
</P>
<P>
Haynes, one of the nation's leading defense attorneys, repeatedly told jurors 
that McKinzie was "a washed-out zombie" simply following Christensen's orders. 
Hundreds of prescriptions were introduced as evidence, indicating that McKinzie 
was taking massive doses of drugs that included anti-anxiety medications such 
as Xanax. 
</P>
<P>
During closing arguments two weeks ago, Haynes said Christensen was the Jim 
Jones of the savings and loan industry, a reference to the cult religious 
figure who led 900 of his followers in a mass suicide in Guyana. 
</P>
<P>
The defense even showed jurors pictures of McKinzie before and after her 
relationship with Christensen. The first photo shows her svelte and healthy. In 
the second, McKinzie appears emaciated and pale. 
</P>
<P>
"The smiling, charming blonde had become an 89- to 93-pound, 
prescription-drug-addicted, mentally diminished person who almost died in 
February, 1987," Essmyer told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
McKinzie didn't even drink coffee before she met Christensen, Essmyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Essmyer paraphrased Christensen as saying: "Just help me a little bit. It's my 
money, it's my savings and loan. And here, have a few pills." 
</P>
<P>
Christensen died in 1987 when his Jaguar crashed into an overpass piling on the 
Corona del Mar Freeway. He was 57. The Orange County coroner classified the 
cause of his death as undetermined, failing to rule on whether it was an 
accident or suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors sided with the government, which said McKinzie was fully aware of what 
she was doing. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors focused exclusively during the trial on two schemes that 
they claimed McKinzie directed personally. 
</P>
<P>
According to the prosecution, an escrow-accounts fraud succeeded in bilking 
North America of $11 million between August, 1985, and March, 1986. The 
thrift's board of directors approved the deposit of millions of dollars in what 
they thought were escrow accounts to be used by McKinzie to purchase properties 
with the help of a real estate speculator named David L. Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
The escrow accounts were phony. 
</P>
<P>
McKinzie went so far as to order an underling to get blank stationery from the 
two banks where the deposits were supposedly held. Shortly thereafter, North 
America executives received letters that appeared to be from the banks 
reassuring them that the deposits were safe and sound. 
</P>
<P>
"To give all parties concerned a good comfort zone, prior to any of these funds 
being released, North America Savings will be immediately notified," one letter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The letters were forgeries -- done at McKinzie's instruction -- and the $11 
million was long gone by the time they arrived in North America's mailbox. 
</P>
<P>
"The money was dispersed to the four corners of the Earth," Seave said during 
closing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
One letter -- purportedly written by the manager of one of the two banks -- 
even praised McKinzie. 
</P>
<P>
"I can assure you Jan McKinzie, her Plaza Group reputation and the business she 
provides to our bank is well respected," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
"That was very nice of Jan McKinzie to write that about herself," Seave said 
during closing arguments. "A nice self-serving touch." 
</P>
<P>
The second scam McKinzie engineered, jurors were told, involved two residential 
projects that North America was financing. 
</P>
<P>
Using old invoices from those projects, McKinzie instructed secretaries to 
white-out key information, such as dates and amount paid, and put in new 
information including much larger amounts due. 
</P>
<P>
North America wrote $5.6 million worth of checks based on those phony invoices, 
some of which went directly to McKinzie and Christensen. The two even formed a 
shell company called Central State Construction which was used as a funnel for 
some of the ill-gotten gains, the prosecution said. 
</P>
<P>
"These schemes are not complicated," Seave told jurors. "They just required a 
lot of hard work, and Janet McKinzie was a very hard worker." 
</P>
<P>
McKinzie -- along with several other officers and directors at North America -- 
still faces a civil lawsuit brought by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance 
Corp. FSLIC attorney Eric Isken said the agency has no plans to drop its 
action. 
</P>
<P>
"We have always intended to pursue all remedies against Janet McKinzie," Isken 
said. "We intend to continue to purse that vigorously." 
</P>
<P>
The failure of North America was one of the more unusual of a series of savings 
and loan collapses in Orange County in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Just last month, two Orange County businessmen were sentenced after convictions 
of fraud and conspiracy that led to the 1986 collapse of Ramona Savings &amp; 
Loan in Santa Ana. They received prison terms of 27 years between them and were 
ordered to pay $6.8 million in restitution to the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
And numerous criminal and civil investigations are under way involving 
Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan. The thrift, which undertook risky real 
estate investments, was seized in April by federal regulators and is expected 
to cost taxpayers more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
THE SAGA OF NORTH AMERICA SAVINGS &amp; LOAN 
</P>
<P>
September, 1983: Duayne D. Christensen, a Westminster dentist, invests $6.4 
million to open North America Savings &amp; Loan in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
November, 1986: North America, now based in Santa Ana, loses $8.9 million for 
the first 11 months of 1986 and has a negative net worth of $1.5 million by the 
end of November. 
</P>
<P>
January, 1987: Christensen is killed when his car crashes into a bridge support 
on the Corona del Mar Freeway. Nine and a half hours later, North America is 
declared insolvent by state regulators. When evidence of widespread fraud is 
detected, the state turns the institution over to the Federal Savings and Loan 
Insurance Corp., and the FBI and the state attorney general's office begin 
criminal investigations. Charles Bottomley is hired by the FSLIC to manage the 
thrift. 
</P>
<P>
February, 1987: Federal regulators sue Janet Faye McKinzie, Christensen's 
business manager and executive consultant, charging that she and Christensen 
defrauded the institution of more than $20 million and caused its collapse. 
</P>
<P>
March, 1987: Lawyers for federal regulators operating the thrift revise the 
amount missing to $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
December, 1987: After moving to new offices in Costa Mesa, North America puts 
its art and collectibles up for auction. Regulators estimate the thrift paid 
more than $250,000 for the office decorations. 
</P>
<P>
June, 1988: Federal regulators announce that they will close and liquidate 
North America. The failure is estimated to cost taxpayers $120 million. 
</P>
<P>
April, 1989: A federal grand jury in Los Angeles returns a 40-count 
racketeering indictment against McKinzie and five other former principals of 
the savings and loan, alleging that they looted the institution of more than 
$16 million. 
</P>
<P>
November, 1989-January, 1990: Three of McKinzie's associates plead guilty to 
criminal charges in connection with alleged fraud at North America. 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 9, 1990: Federal racketeering and bank fraud trial of McKinzie begins in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
March 29, 1990: McKinzie is found guilty of 22 counts of racketeering, 
conspiracy, wire and bank fraud and interstate transportation of stolen 
property. She could be sentenced to up to 175 years in prison.

PRISON OFFICIALS TIE MISSING GUARD TO INMATE'S ESCAPE

<P>
Authorities at the state women's prison in Frontera said Thursday that a guard 
who has disappeared may be linked to the Sunday night escape of convicted 
murderer Jeanette Lynn Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
Ross Dykes, associate warden at the California Institution for Women, said 
authorities have not ruled out either of two possibilities: that the officer 
might have aided Hughes in the escape, or that he somehow became a victim. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities refused to release any information about the guard, citing privacy 
laws. But a reliable source said the guard is a woman. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very concerned that we have been unable to reach this officer," Dykes 
said. "We have not ruled out that this officer might be at risk. We are 
certainly not ready to say at this point that the officer is a suspect." 
</P>
<P>
Dykes said he was not free to comment whether the authorities had information 
linking the guard to the escape other than the fact she disappeared about the 
same time. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes, 36, was serving a 25-year prison sentence for the 1984 murder of her 
husband in their Huntington Beach home. She was last seen about 6 p.m. Sunday 
visiting with her father, James Tugwell, in the large visitors lounge. 
</P>
<P>
The visiting period ended at 9 p.m., and Hughes was discovered missing about 
9:20 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Tugwell was observed leaving the visitors area alone. Dykes has discounted 
speculation that Hughes, who like other inmates was dressed in her own clothes, 
might have hidden herself among the departing visitors. Security is too tight 
for that to happen, he said. 
</P>
<P>
There is no evidence that Hughes' father was involved, Dykes said. 
</P>
<P>
The guard who disappeared got off duty at 6:30 p.m. Sunday, a short time after 
Hughes was last seen. The guard did not report for work as expected at 2:30 
p.m. Thursday. Dykes acknowledged that officials had reason to believe before 
Thursday that the guard might know something. He would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
The guard was assigned to inmate housing and "may have been one of the last 
persons to have been in contact with the inmate prior to her escape," Dykes 
said, reading from a statement released Thursday about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Since Hughes' disappearance, Dykes said, "we have had no information of any 
kind to help us locate her." 
</P>
<P>
Dykes said earlier in the week that officials found no evidence that Hughes had 
scaled the 12-foot fence, topped by ribboned wire, which surrounds the prison 
grounds. Also, he said, they are convinced after a thorough search that the 
inmate is not hiding anywhere on the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes made the first escape from the 67-acre maximum security prison in four 
years. In 1987, she and several other women tried to escape by cutting the bars 
in their cells. But their plan was discovered before anyone made it out of a 
cell. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Hughes has been on "close custody," which includes being escorted 
to and from the visitors area. It also means she is housed in an area that does 
not have the same access to the yard as most other inmates, which makes her 
escape even more baffling to prison officials. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes was convicted in 1986 for the death of her husband, James Hughes, who 
was shot while he slept in their tract home. Hughes later confessed that he was 
killed by her lover, Adam Ramirez, because the two of them wanted the $442,000 
from his life insurance. She admitted that she had left a light to signal 
Ramirez when it was safe to come in, and then later made up a story about a 
burglar shooting her husband and then hitting her.

CENSUS CAN BE A PUZZLE; 
</P>
<P>
LANGUAGE BARRIER: THE COUNTY'S SOUTHEAST ASIANS ARE HAVING PROBLEMS 
UNDERSTANDING JUST WHAT THE HEAD COUNT IS, EVEN WITH SOME HELP.

<P>
Even for one who commands English with the aplomb of a Laurence Olivier, 
filling out a census form can be tough. 
</P>
<P>
But imagine trying to complete the questionnaire armed only with knowledge of 
the Vietnamese, Thai or Tagalog languages. 
</P>
<P>
That's where people like Chi Duy Do come in. A volunteer for the U.S. Census 
Bureau, Do is one of scores of people in Orange County and across the country 
working to ensure that those who speak foreign tongues will be tallied in the 
nationwide head count. 
</P>
<P>
They are stationed at toll-free telephone lines or ensconced at temporary 
assistance centers in community agencies, churches and other locations. Do has 
the Vietnamese of Orange County as his customers, and his task has not been 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
"They call me and ask me, 'What is census?' " Do said Thursday as he sat in the 
offices of the Santa Ana-based Vietnamese Community of Orange County Inc., a 
social service agency where he usually works as a counselor. "They don't know 
the meaning. After explaining it to them, I ask them to spread the word . . . 
but I fear that many, many Vietnamese people will not be counted." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, problems have already started to crop up. 
</P>
<P>
There have been reports that some newcomers from Southeast Asia have thrown 
their census forms away, figuring that the government documents were junk mail. 
</P>
<P>
"In my neighborhood, I have seen in the trash maybe two or three 
questionnaires," said Do, who has also received phone calls from half a dozen 
other Vietnamese immigrants who mistakenly threw out the census form. "They 
don't understand. They think it is advertising." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the centers have yet to start doing a breakneck business. At the 
Vietnamese community center, for instance, only about a dozen people have 
called or visited since the forms were mailed March 23. Do was able, however, 
to explain the census to about 40 elderly Vietnamese during a meeting of senior 
citizens on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Many non-English-speaking residents may have resorted to ringing up the Census 
Bureau's toll-free telephone network. Nationwide, about 9,000 people have 
called the phone lines serving Asian languages, according to Ken Riccini, the 
bureau's assistant chief of processing centers. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish-language lines have been another matter entirely. Calls have jammed 
the system for days. The bureau has added more lines, but reports persisted 
Thursday of callers getting only a busy signal despite repeated dialings. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Census Bureau are well aware of all the problems. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with large printing costs and various computer-programming difficulties, 
the Census Bureau mails out questionnaires only in English. Each form also has 
a phone number for ordering a copy in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
But those who speak other languages must fend for themselves, seek help from 
census employees on the bureau's toll-free telephone lines, or head to one of 
the more than 75 volunteer assistance centers in Orange County and thousands 
more throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
Chi Duy Do and other volunteers use their bilingual skills to translate the 
census for often-befuddled newcomers, many of them from lands that never held 
such a nationwide canvass. 
</P>
<P>
If someone shows up speaking an unfamiliar language, the volunteers employ 
booklets that translate the census into 32 languages. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such efforts, leaders of minority groups throughout the United States 
worry that the language barrier and inherent fears of government intrusion will 
combine to cause an undercount among many of the people who could benefit most 
from the census. 
</P>
<P>
The once-a-decade head count is used to figure political apportionment and 
distribution of more than $70 billion in federal assistance for programs 
ranging from highway construction to social service agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"The census is something that is very unfamiliar to the Southeast Asian 
community in general and the Vietnamese in particular," said Tuong Duy Nguyen, 
executive director of the Vietnamese community center, which serves the 130,000 
to 150,000 immigrants in Orange County. "They don't know how good the census is 
for them." 
</P>
<P>
Some newcomers fear that information gleaned by the census might be used 
against them, he said. In particular, they worry that revelations such as 
several families crammed into one tiny apartment might bring them to the 
attention of housing authorities, Nguyen said. 
</P>
<P>
And many Vietnamese don't trust the Census Bureau's promises of 
confidentiality, he continued, because of their experience with the government 
in their homeland -- a "distrust in the system" that has been carried to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes time to change the philosophy, the way of thinking," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen said the effort to count the Southeast Asian community has been 
undermined in part by a lack of census employees to spread the word in the 
months before the count and to promote the effort among the Vietnamese and 
other immigrants. The bureau has only a single employee, Vong Ngo, serving as 
liaison to the Southeast Asian community all across Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Ngo expects that only about half the Vietnamese in Orange County 
will end up returning their census forms. Many of the rest will be counted 
during a post-census effort involving phone calls to non-respondents and visits 
to homes, Ngo said. Even then, he expects only 70% to 80% of the community to 
be counted. 
</P>
<P>
But the short, bespectacled father of two has not given up. Ngo said he plans 
to hold a press conference on Monday with reporters from immigrant newspapers 
in Orange County to spark more articles about the census and its importance.

EX-POLICEMAN HELD IN RAPE OF IRVINE GIRL, 11; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: PROSECUTORS SAY A FORMER BEVERLY HILLS OFFICER STALKED THE VICTIM THEN 
POSED AS A DELIVERYMAN TO ENTER HER HOME, WHERE THE ATTACK OCCURRED.

<P>
Prosecutors said Thursday that they believe an ex-Beverly Hills police officer 
used his training to stalk an 11-year-old Irvine girl, then posed as a 
deliveryman to gain entry into her home when she was alone and raped her at 
knifepoint. 
</P>
<P>
"This is far more frightening than your average rape," said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Ariadne Symons, who prosecutes sex crimes. "This man obviously stalked the 
child, chose her for whatever reason to be his victim, waited for her to be 
alone and planned the crime in what he thought would be the most undetectable 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Steven Rush McCoy, 36, was being held on $250,000 bail in Orange County Jail on 
six felony counts that include rape, sexual assault and burglary, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred Monday. McCoy is to be arraigned April 6. 
</P>
<P>
Jail records show that just six days before the incident, McCoy was released on 
his own recognizance from Orange County Jail after five days in custody on 
charges of burglary, grand theft, forgery and possession of forged notes. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, the victim in the rape was home sick from school Monday 
afternoon when the attacker, posing as a deliveryman, persuaded her to open the 
door to receive a package, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the girl called 911 after her attacker left and picked McCoy 
out of a photo lineup. 
</P>
<P>
The victim and her family live in the same quiet, UC Irvine housing complex as 
does McCoy, who worked as a broker at Drexel Burnham Lambert until last year 
and recently moved to Irvine from Dana Point. The girl's parents told 
investigators that they had never seen McCoy before, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators, however, said they believe that McCoy "targeted" the girl. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't going from door to door," said Sgt. Phil Povey, who heads 
investigations at the Irvine Police Department. "He went to that one apartment. 
But we can't explain why. I can't get inside this guy's head, and he's not 
doing a lot of talking. So he's not making our job real easy." 
</P>
<P>
Symons said the assailant raped the girl at knifepoint on a bedsheet, then took 
the sheet with him so as not to leave evidence behind. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious that his police training had a lot to do with it," Symons said, 
"because most people don't know enough about forensic evidence . . . to do what 
he did." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators found a black-handled knife in a rubbish can at the victim's 
home. The knife matched a knife described by McCoy's recent roommate, John 
Estrela, as belonging to McCoy, according to police. Investigators also found a 
package that they believe the attacker used as a ruse to persuade the victim 
that he was a deliveryman. 
</P>
<P>
Also, during a search of McCoy's apartment, police said they found evidence 
that connects him with the rape, including clothes belonging to the victim and 
a stained sheet believed to be from the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Stirring particular interest among prosecutors is a book allegedly found at the 
apartment: "How to Assert an Insanity Defense." 
</P>
<P>
Barry Simons, the attorney representing McCoy, could not be reached for comment 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Estrela -- McCoy's former roommate -- and others who know him said McCoy talked 
about having psychiatric problems. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Nader, manager of Irvine Yellow Cab, which had done business with 
McCoy, said one of his cabbies and McCoy got into a scuffle a few weeks ago 
over an unpaid bill. 
</P>
<P>
"McCoy was just off the wall -- a crazy man," Nader said. "He'd be very nice 
one minute and then just uncontrollable the next." 
</P>
<P>
A former business associate, who asked not to be named, said he had recently 
seen McCoy on a national TV show talking about a sleeping pill that he said had 
caused him psychological damage. And a relative of Estrela showed a reporter at 
the apartment a bottle of anti-depression pills that had McCoy's name on it. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy worked for two years in the Beverly Hills Police Department, first as a 
reserve officer. He was hired as a full-time patrol officer in January, 1978, 
but was let go that August while still in his probation period. Department 
officials refused to say why he was dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
After his police service, acquaintances and business associates said, McCoy 
worked for several investment firms as a broker. Records on file with the 
National Assn. of Security Dealers in Washington show that McCoy has not been 
registered as a dealer since he left Drexel in June, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
He was married in 1982 and reportedly lived in Dana Point with his wife and two 
children until a divorce several years ago, according to friends and police. 
</P>
<P>
Police said McCoy told them he was a self-employed private consultant in 
foreign investment. His current financial situation, however, remains unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Several business associates said they understood from McCoy that he continued 
to get substantial income from a trust fund established by a former employer. 
Associates added, however, that while McCoy liked to talk about his wealth, 
they suspected such money may have been an illusion. 
</P>
<P>
Estrela said McCoy tried to "stick" him with bills several times and never 
seemed to have any money. 
</P>
<P>
Estrela moved into McCoy's apartment less than a month ago after the two met on 
a taxi ride. Estrela had been working as a cabbie at Irvine Yellow Cab for just 
a week when he was called to McCoy's apartment for what he thought would be a 
trip to Arcadia. But the ride didn't stop there. Estrela said McCoy had him 
drive to Disneyland, Chinatown in Los Angeles and ultimately through Las Vegas 
and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
The two became friendly on the trip, Estrela said, and he later moved in with 
McCoy. 
</P>
<P>
They lived for part of the time with a teen-age runaway whom Estrela had 
befriended, the former roommate said. 
</P>
<P>
Estrela said he did not see much of McCoy on the day of the rape. However, he 
said, he does not believe his ex-roommate is guilty. 
</P>
<P>
"He's stupid, but he's not that stupid," Estrela said.

SCHOOL ACTS AFTER RACIAL INCIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHANNON SANDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to a racial incident at Tustin High School last week, the principal 
has decided to form an ethnic advisory council as a forum for resolving racial 
tension. 
</P>
<P>
Principal Duffy Clark said he hopes that the council will eventually have 
several hundred members who will work to develop awareness of racial issues on 
campus and also become involved in community service. 
</P>
<P>
Although students usually coexist peacefully, the situation turned ugly last 
Thursday night during an "air guitar" competition in the gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
According to students and administrators, blacks and whites yelled racial slurs 
from the bleachers, calling each other "niggers" and "honkies." 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe what was happening," said junior Rose Silguero, 16. "I was 
in the middle. I was so panicky my hands were shaking. I just had so much anger 
in me, I wanted to cry. . . . I thought, 'Oh my God, why does this have to 
happen here?' " 
</P>
<P>
Some black students felt that a black group dancing and lip-synching to the pop 
song "Rhythm Nation" by Janet Jackson should have taken first place in the 
contest instead of a white group performing to "Start Me Up" by the Rolling 
Stones. 
</P>
<P>
After the show, two students confronted each other in the parking lot. Although 
the battle was confined to words and a few shoves, the tension was high, 
students and school officials agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Although some students and officials deny that there is racial tension at 
Tustin High's ethnically diverse campus, sophomore Mark Benjamin disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are ready to explode," said Benjamin, 15. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin added that when he opened a book in English literature class on 
Thursday, he saw "Niggers can't read" and "Skinheads rule" scrawled inside. 
Duffy said he was unaware of that incident. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's unrest prompted leaders of the school's predominantly black Society 
Club to renew their push to change the group's name to the Black Student Union. 
The group's 25 to 30 members work to promote black history, organize seminars, 
offer tutoring for college entrance exams and sponsor other events. 
</P>
<P>
The students have begun the formal process of changing the club's name, which 
requires the approval of the Associated Student Body, the school principal and 
the Tustin Unified School District board. 
</P>
<P>
"The Koreans have a Korean Club, and other groups have their own clubs," said 
Charleton Long, 17, Society Club president. "We feel we have pride in our 
culture and we should call (the club) the Black Student Union." 
</P>
<P>
Josh Belden, 16, a white football player and member of the track team, recently 
decided to join the Society Club. 
</P>
<P>
"The racial problems are out of hand, and I want to get involved," said Belden, 
who is also interested in being a part of the ethnic advisory council. SHANNON

CHAMBER MAY DROP TRADITIONAL PARADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 36 years, the once-popular Fiesta La Cristianita Parade may be canceled 
by the San Clemente Chamber of Commerce due to lack of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Although the chamber's board of directors has yet to vote on the issue, the 
parade regularly scheduled in May is not on the group's calendar this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Attendance has dwindled in the last few years," said Mimi Collier, chamber 
director. "(The parade) has been a drain on our volunteers." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the chamber scaled down the annual event. 
</P>
<P>
Formerly a professionally run operation featuring marching bands and floats, 
the 1989 parade was a parody event run similarly to the annual Doo-Dah Parade 
in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The chamber also shifted the date of the parade to May from its traditional 
slot during the monthlong Fiesta La Cristianita in July. 
</P>
<P>
Collier hopes some other community group will resurrect the parade.

THIRD-GRADERS GET ARBOR DAY TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Rotary Club of Newport-Balboa has distributed 1,800 seedling trees to 
third-graders in 28 public and private schools and special educational programs 
in Newport Beach and Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
This is the 22nd year in which the club has delivered trees to celebrate Arbor 
Day, according to Donal C. Noonan, Arbor Day committee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
National Arbor Day falls on April 27, while California Arbor Day was earlier 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
"We chose third-graders because they have reached the age of reason, if you 
will," said Noonan. "They are old enough to adopt a tree and nurture it. As 
they would grow, so would the tree." 
</P>
<P>
Each year, the Rotary Club chooses a different species and purchases the trees 
from an Irvine nursery. This year's selection was the star pine, a native of 
Norfolk Island in the South Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
"We explain to the children that we are living on a coastal desert plain," said 
Noonan. "There are no trees here that weren't planted by man or a 
third-grader." LESLIE HERZOG

ADDITION SUBTRACTED FOR LACK OF PERMITS

<P>
Resident Harold Caswell has been ordered by the City Council to demolish the 
nearly completed second-story addition to his home because he didn't get the 
necessary permits and approvals before he began construction. 
</P>
<P>
After a complaint was filed by a disgruntled neighbor, who said the addition 
intruded on his privacy, building officials inspected the property. They found 
that the patio, on top of which the addition was built, is only five feet from 
the rear property line, not 10 as required by the city's zoning ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a monstrosity that sits there almost in my kitchen window," said Richard 
Verdugo, who lives in back of Caswell. 
</P>
<P>
Building official Tony Elmo said that a preliminary, external inspection of the 
premises revealed several other code violations, including faulty electrical 
wiring locations and potential structural concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Officials also discovered that Caswell had failed to get permits on at least 
two other construction projects, including the patio on which the addition was 
built. 
</P>
<P>
Caswell admitted that the work had been completed without permits. However, he 
consented to have the building officials tear down walls and ceiling materials 
in order for complete inspections to take place. Building officials held off on 
those inspections, pending the council decision. 
</P>
<P>
"They are all up to code," insisted Caswell, who has lived at his home on 
Cardiff Drive for 22 years. He said he spent about $10,000 on the addition. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of granting a variance, which would have permitted the inspections, the 
City Council decided that Caswell could not complete the project. 
</P>
<P>
"With the applicant standing before us saying that he knowingly operated 
without permits, I can't see how we could possibly allow him to continue," said 
Councilwoman Margaret Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
Elmo said that Caswell will have at least 60 days to tear down the second-story 
room. He may come before the council and ask for permission to keep the patio 
at a latter date, he added. LYNDA NATALI

REPORT DUE SOON ON FOUNDATION FLAWS

<P>
Engineering scientists at Cal State Long Beach are expected to issue a report 
soon detailing what has caused the concrete foundations in at least a dozen 
homes to deteriorate and crack, city officials announced. 
</P>
<P>
Since May, 1986, 12 homeowners have had to repair their foundations as a result 
of the mysterious cracks, said Tony Elmo of the city's Building Department. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent repair was needed in January. 
</P>
<P>
Initial investigations revealed a high level of sulfates in the soil. Officials 
speculate that the sulfates could cause an adverse reaction when they come in 
contact with the concrete. This would explain why the affected areas have 
mostly been garages, which are usually not protected by plastic moisture 
barriers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The most problems we've seen are in garage areas because the concrete is 
poured on unprotected soil," Elmo said. Because Cypress was once populated by 
dairy farmers, a concern about peat from pastures also was raised. However, 
Elmo said, they believe that peat is only a small part of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The affected homes are concentrated in a few neighborhoods north of Orange 
Avenue, south of Lincoln Avenue and between Denni and Bloomfield streets. Most 
of the homes were built between 1966 and 1971. Depending on the extent of the 
damage, costs for replacing the concrete slabs has run anywhere from $5,000 to 
$20,000, Elmo said. 
</P>
<P>
The report is scheduled to be made public in late April or May. LYNDA NATALI

Orange County area officials who recently had to deal with the Huntington Beach 
oil spill met with Reps. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad) and Dana Rohrabacher 
(R-Lomita) on Thursday to press for greater local input in proposed legislation 
regarding oil spill cleanups. 
</P>
<P>
A conference committee has been working out differences between House and 
Senate versions of a bill that would greatly increase the financial liability 
limits for oil spillers, require double hulls and bottoms for oil tankers and 
restructure the assessment of damages for spills. 
</P>
<P>
The local officials urged Packard and Rohrabacher to expand the legislation to 
allow consultations with local officials affected by oil spills and quicker 
reimbursement of those who participate in cleanup efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"That's really our role here," said Raymond Picard, fire chief for the city of 
Huntington Beach. "The city councils and counties want to express our concerns. 
We are and were the ones most impacted" by the American Trader spill. 
</P>
<P>
Participants in the 10-minute session included Picard; John W. Sibley, 
associate administrative officer for Orange County; Ruthelyn Plummer, mayor of 
Newport Beach; and James McConnell, a Washington lobbyist for Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Senate and House bills call for creation of a $1-billion national fund 
to cover the cost of damages caused by oil spills, and would place the U.S. 
Coast Guard in charge of coordinating cleanup efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we caught their attention," remarked Plummer. "Our position is that 
we're very supportive of this legislation, and we just wanted to feed in (our) 
input on it because it's the local level that gives support. . . . We came here 
to be part of the decision-making process." 
</P>
<P>
The group stressed the need for provisions in the legislation to provide for 
local involvement in deciding the length of cleanup operations, the 
reimbursement to cities and counties responding to spills, and improved safety 
regulations for the oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody has got to pay for all the police and fire support . . . (especially) 
in cases for cities and counties where these departments are not heavily 
funded," Plummer said. "They would be in financial hardships before relief 
hits." 
</P>
<P>
McConnell said his group also had met with members of the House Merchant Marine 
Committee. While committee members are "not going to give the locals the 
authority to say how clean is clean . . . they are willing to have our 
consultation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 7, the American Trader tanker ruptured its hull when it ran over its 
anchor. The spill released 394,000 gallons of oil and fouled more than 14 miles 
of coastline. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for improved safety methods and controls to minimize risks," 
said Sibley. "Double-hulling or some kind of recovery system would have 
prevented (the spill at) Huntington Beach. Whatever constitutes that safety, we 
want for the future." 
</P>
<P>
Packard said he understood the concerns of the local officials and told them he 
would take steps to respond to their requests. 
</P>
<P>
"They had some very important and very justifiable concerns," Packard said. 
"Newport Beach spent $300,000-plus in (its) cleanup. Close to a million dollars 
in local spending was used. The local agencies are really capable of doing a 
lot of things." 
</P>
<P>
Packard said that he and Rohrabacher will draft a letter to the other 
conferees, proposing that monies spent by local entities be reimbursed from a 
trust fund established by the oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Next week will be critical because that's when we expect the conference 
committee to wrap up its work," Packard said.

D.A. INVESTIGATES DEATH OF MAN SHOT OUTSIDE STORE BY DEPUTY

<P>
The district attorney's office is investigating the death of a 28-year-old man 
who was fatally shot by an Orange County sheriff's deputy during a 
confrontation outside a convenience store, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Wade Collins of Garden Grove was pronounced dead Wednesday night 
outside a Circle K store on the 2200 block of Chapman Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's spokesman Lt. Richard J. Olson said the shooting occurred about 10:45 
p.m. after the deputy tried to question Collins as he came out of the store. 
Olson would not say why police wanted to question him, but Collins' relatives 
said they were told he was a robbery suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Collins struggled with the officer and broke free, running south along Dale 
Street, Olson said. The deputy caught Collins in the middle of the street, and 
a second fight ensued, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
As Collins ran away a second time, he dropped a knife into the street, Olson 
said. The deputy, who was not identified, shot Collins when he ignored orders 
to stop running, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Collins "was shot as he turned towards the deputy with his hands concealed," 
Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office, which investigates all officer-involved 
shootings, declined to discuss details of the case. 
</P>
<P>
The incident was the third officer-involved shooting this year, and the first 
fatal one. The last shooting occurred March 4, when a man suspected of 
commandeering a woman's car outside a restaurant was shot after he lunged 
toward a Santa Ana police officer. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Collins' family has contacted an attorney for a possible 
wrongful-death suit, said his sister-in-law, Theresa (Lanette) Collins. 
</P>
<P>
The sister-in-law and several other family members visited the scene shortly 
after the shooting. Collins said witnesses told her the deputy beat Collins. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he shouldn't have run, but I don't think they should have killed him 
for it," she said.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To Fund Committees 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 349 to 71, the House approved a partial committee budget for 1990 
of $56.8 million, up 4.8% over the comparable 1989 authorization and 10.5% over 
actual spending last year. The measure (HR 346) will fund about half the cost 
of the House's approximately 180 committees and subcommittees, with the 
remainder supplied by separate legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.) called the budget "conservative and responsible." 
</P>
<P>
William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) objected to "an increase (of 10.5%) that is 
twice the level of . . . inflation." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the committee funding.

Rural Development 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 360 to 45, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 3581) 
delivering federal aid to depressed rural areas. At an estimated cost of more 
than $2 billion over five years, the bill starts new programs, realigns current 
ones and gives states more voice in funding decisions. It shifts certain 
programs from the Farmers Home Administration to a new Rural Development 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The bill also expands the Rural Electrification Administration, eases repayment 
terms of REA and other rural loans and channels aid to communities hurt by 
curbs on timbering in national forests. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the bill.

Flag Issue 
</P>
<P>
The House voted 309 to 101 to withdraw from the U. S. Supreme Court its brief 
for the 1989 law making it a crime to desecrate the American flag. This vote on 
HR 362 was a victory for Republicans who would rather protect the flag by 
constitutional amendment. They objected that the Democratic-approved brief 
asked the court to rule on the flag law in the term beginning in October. They 
saw this as a delaying tactic by Democrats who want to preserve the statute. 
</P>
<P>
"The longer this House . . . tries to bottle up the statute in the Supreme 
Court, the longer the flag goes unprotected," said James F. Sensenbrenner Jr. 
(R-Wis). 
</P>
<P>
Craig Washington (D-Tex.) said "the cheapest trick of all" is to embroil the 
flag in partisan politics. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted the flag brief withdrawn from the Supreme Court.

9 HOSPITALS SUED FOR FAILED TRANSFER OF PATIENT; 
</P>

LITIGATION: THE SUIT CLAIMS THAT THE HOSPITALS WOULDN'T ACCEPT THE HIT-RUN 
VICTIM WHO LATER DIED OF HIS INJURIES BECAUSE HE HAD NO PRIVATE HEALTH

In a case that highlights the crisis in medical care for the indigent, a 
4-year-old boy sued nine hospitals -- including four in Orange County -- 
Thursday, contending that his father was illegally denied medical treatment 
when he was dying because he lacked private health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed on behalf of Patrick Jimenez in Imperial County Superior 
Court, alleges that the nine hospitals violated Juan Jimenez's civil rights 
when they refused to permit his transfer from Pioneers Memorial Hospital in 
Brawley several days after he was critically injured by a hit-and-run driver on 
May 30, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Jimenez, 43, a former boxer from Westminster, died of gangrene and widespread 
infection at Pioneers on June 18. Believing Jimenez needed more specialized 
care, administrators at Pioneers contacted nine better-equipped hospitals in 
Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties, but none reportedly would take him, 
even after his admission had been authorized by Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
Some hospitals said they could not accept him because they were full or lacked 
an attending physician to accept the transfer. Others said they were not in the 
Medi-Cal program or that they could not take patients from other counties. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators from the University of California and the state Department of 
Health Services determined that the nine hospitals did nothing wrong. The state 
health officials' report said that Jimenez was too ill to be moved. But Daniel 
H. Amos, the attorney who filed the suit, criticized those findings. 
</P>
<P>
"The results of those investigations were wrong," he said. "This civil suit 
will prove that what they (the hospitals) did was not only reprehensible but 
against the law." 
</P>
<P>
Amos said the medical facilities violated a section of the state Health and 
Safety Code that requires hospitals to provide life-saving services to patients 
regardless of their insurance status or ability to pay. 
</P>
<P>
Justin Clouser, general counsel for Santa Ana's Poverty Law Center, said the 
case exemplifies the growing problem of hospitals "dumping" indigent patients 
onto other facilities or refusing to accept them. Hospitals say they are being 
pinched by rising medical costs and Medi-Cal, which reimburses them for only a 
small percentage of indigent patients' care. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick's mother, Maria Chinkin, lived with Jimenez for about two years but 
continued to help support their son until the father died, Amos said. 
</P>
<P>
Jimenez's widow, Leticia Jimenez, is also planning to sue the hospitals over 
her husband's death. Her lawyer, Leo J. Moriarty Jr., said he intends to file a 
similar suit in Orange County Superior Court next week, and another in U.S. 
District Court within a month. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals usually agree that they are obliged to accept emergency patients off 
the street, but say that they are under no such duty to accept transfer of 
patients from other facilities, Moriarty said. In his federal lawsuit, Moriarty 
hopes to establish that hospitals must treat any patient in a life-threatening 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
The nine hospitals named in the lawsuit are the medical centers at UC Irvine, 
UC San Diego and UCLA; Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center, 
Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, St. Joseph Hospital in Orange and three 
facilities in San Diego County: Mercy Hospital and Medical Center, Grossmont 
District Hospital and Donald N. Sharp Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Pioneers is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit, but Amos said he will not 
take action against the facility unless he discovers that it did not do enough 
to facilitate Jimenez's transfer. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the hospitals or their lawyers refused to comment on the lawsuit. 
Officials at UCLA Medical Center and UC San Diego Medical Center said those 
facilities acted properly in refusing the transfer. 
</P>
<P>
Laura Avallone, a spokeswoman for Mercy Hospital, said that Mercy did not 
refuse to accept Jimenez. Mercy's trauma surgeon simply failed to finalize the 
plans for the transfer, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a very unfortunate situation," Avallone said. "It was a systems 
failure in which the ball was dropped."

Notes: Esperanza, the defending 3-A champion, breezed through the Orange County 
Championships to win with 90 points. The Aztecs are led by all-around sprinter 
Roshawn Sims, who already has won two athlete of the meet honors (Irvine 
Invitational and OC Championships). One of the more interesting showdowns this 
year should be between Los Alamitos' Mitchell and San Clemente's Martin -- 
Martin beat Mitchell in an indoor 50-yard race in January, but Mitchell beat 
Martin last week in the 100 meters at the Orange County Championships. 
Huntington Beach sophomore Brown has proved to be in a class by himself in the 
110-meter hurdles, and watch for Magnolia's Singbandith to close in on the 
county triple jumping record of 50 feet 3 1/2 inches set in 1982 by Troy's Ken 
Williams.

Kawabuchi. Diehl won the 200 individual medley (1:51.07) and the 500 freestyle 
(4:31.39). Kawabuchi won the 100 freestyle (47.08) and the 200 freestyle 
(1:44.11). 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' competition, Mission Viejo won seven of 10 events to defeat 
Capistrano Valley, 94-60. 
</P>
<P>
Despite missing four swimmers who were at the junior national meet, Mission 
Viejo (4-0, 2-0) raced away from the three-time defending Southern Section 
Division 4-A champions. Sophomore Leslie Rhee won the 200 freestyle (2:02.08) 
and the 100 butterfly (1:02.33) for Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo sophomore Katarina Triska had little competition in the 500 
freestyle, winning by nearly 20 seconds in 5:11.84. 
</P>
<P>
Defending Southern Section champion Christy Carolin won the 50 freestyle 
(24.57) and the 100 freestyle (54.14), which she won by five seconds, for 
Capistrano Valley (2-2, 0-2).

KING, PFETZING LEND SPEEDWAY SAVVY TO OPENER

<P>
Lance King and Robert Pfetzing bring an impressive list of credentials in 
international speedway racing when they return for the 22nd season opener at 
the Orange County Fairgrounds at 8 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
They have a combined 11 years of international racing experience in the British 
Speedway League. King finished third in the world championship in 1984 in 
Sweden and Pfetzing tied Bobby Schwartz for the U.S. Championship in 1986, 
losing the title in a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Both grossed more than $50,000 in purses and sponsorship racing last year, but 
they have decided to remain home in Southern California for the 1990 season. 
</P>
<P>
King, a 26-year-old who lives in Fountain Valley during the off-season, said 
the decision to stay home was strictly for financial reasons. He is in a 
dispute with a former promoter for $10,000 King says he is owed for racing the 
past two seasons for King's Lynn team. 
</P>
<P>
Pfetzing, a 30-year-old who lives in Santa Ana during the off-season, has 
returned for personal reasons after riding for Wolverhampton last year. 
</P>
<P>
Pfetzing's grandmother has breast cancer and will begin receiving daily 
radiation treatments when she returns from visiting relatives in Florida next 
week. Pfetzing will live with his grandmother and take her to the daily 
treatments. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother died 10 years ago and my grandmother has been like a mother to me 
since then," Pfetzing said. "I've lived with her in the off-season, and she's 
always been my biggest supporter in racing. Now, I'm going to take care of 
her." 
</P>
<P>
This marks the second time both riders have grown tired of racing, living and 
traveling in foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
King took a one-year leave of absence in 1985 to race locally but still managed 
to qualify for the world championship. Pfetzing was disenchanted after his 
first season overseas in 1984 and stayed home for three seasons before 
returning to Bradford in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Now, after competing four nights a week in the British Speedway League and 
spending weekends competing in open meetings in West Germany or Italy, King and 
Pfetzing are glad to be home. 
</P>
<P>
King grew up at the race track. He was riding a minibike before he learned how 
to ride a bicycle. He turned professional at 11 and had a full-time sponsorship 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
He became a Division I rider and began racing four nights a week in Southern 
California as a sophomore at Birmingham High in Van Nuys. He was handpicked by 
former world champion Bruce Penhall for his team at Cradley Heath and left for 
England when he was 18. 
</P>
<P>
At 22, he had qualified for three consecutive world championship races. He 
owned a house in Tamworth, England, and another in Fountain Valley. He had a 
classic car collection that included a 1981 Mercedes Convertible 350 SL Zender, 
a 1981 Renault R5 Turbo and a Volkswagen Baja Bug with a BMW 320i engine. 
</P>
<P>
For the past two years, he was the team captain at King's Lynn. He averaged 
8.90 points (out of a possible 12) in the British Speedway League. 
</P>
<P>
King estimates he grossed $50,000 racing in 1989 and doesn't expect to match 
that figure in Southern California, although he has retained his main sponsor, 
Gold's Gym, for this season. 
</P>
<P>
King plans to race four nights a week at Costa Mesa, Ascot Park's South Bay 
Stadium, Glen Helen Regional Park in San Bernardino and Victorville. 
</P>
<P>
Pfetzing was 21 when he won 12 main events in third and second division racing 
through the opening 13 weeks of the 1981 season before moving up to the 
Division I field. 
</P>
<P>
Pfetzing, a Kennedy High graduate, was easily recognized in his brightly 
colored leathers, trimmed in oranges, yellows and red that made him look like a 
snow cone. After three seasons in Southern California, Pfetzing joined 
Wolverhampton in the British Speedway League in 1984, but he found the 
competition more than he bargained for. 
</P>
<P>
"The first two months I raced over there, I never got to the first turn ahead 
once," Pfetzing said. "I decided that I had better improve my gating (starts), 
or I won't survive. I watched everyone and spent lot of time with (three-time 
world champion) Erik Gunderson and his mechanic learning the tricks." 
</P>
<P>
Pfetzing became one of the best gaters in the world, rivaling former seven-time 
U.S. champion Mike Bast as the best U.S. starter in the sport. He averaged 6.5 
points at Wolverhampton last year, riding with Americans Sam Ermolenko and 
Ronnie Correy. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike King, Pfetzing said he enjoyed the slower lifestyle, fresh air and 
wide-open spaces near his home in Telford. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoyed it, knowing that I wouldn't have to live there the rest of my life," 
he said. "I was making good money. I grossed about $70,000 last year. But when 
my grandmother became ill, it straightened out my priorities real fast. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to come home, but I'm happy to be here. I'm excited about racing and 
look forward to riding in Southern California. Speedway is such a happening 
here. It's a great atmosphere."

ROCKWELL PUTS NEW DEFENSE ELECTRONICS UNIT IN ANAHEIM

<P>
In anticipation of reduced Pentagon spending, Rockwell International Corp. on 
Thursday announced the formation of a Defense Electronics division, which will 
be based in Anaheim and have 14,000 employees in seven states. 
</P>
<P>
"This new organization merges the bulk of Rockwell's defense electronics 
activities into one business segment," Kent M. Black, Rockwell's executive vice 
president and chief operating officer, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
"Modifying our business structure is only one of many tools being used to make 
us more competitive." 
</P>
<P>
The new division will be headed by John A. McLuckey, a 31-year Rockwell veteran 
who has headed the company's Autonetics division in Anaheim since 1987. 
McLuckey was named president of the Defense Electronics unit, which will have 
projected sales of about $1.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Electronics organization will merge the following divisions: 
Autonetics ICBM Systems, Autonetics Marine Systems and Autonetics Sensors and 
Aircraft Systems, all headquartered in Anaheim; Collins Defense Communications, 
Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and Missile Systems, Duluth, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
"This internally provides a better management, under one organization reporting 
to one person," said Tony Longo, a Rockwell spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate move, Rockwell's Digital Communications Systems unit said it is 
reorganizing its Microelectronics Technology Center in Newport Beach to focus 
more on commercial programs rather than defense programs. 
</P>
<P>
The move will affect about 70 employees in the sales, marketing, finance, 
operations and quality-control departments. Rockwell anticipates placing more 
than half of those 70 workers in other jobs with the firm, said Patricia Dixon, 
a company spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell employs about 1,200 people in Newport Beach.

NATIONAL LUMBER TO CLOSE FULLERTON AND 5 OTHER STORES, LAY OFF 165 
</P>

<P>
In another cost-reduction move, National Lumber &amp; Supply Inc. said Thursday 
that it will close six of its 21 home-building centers and lay off about 165 
employees working at those outlets. 
</P>
<P>
"The move is designed to stem financial losses, reduce operating costs and 
bolster inventory levels of remaining stores," the company said in a prepared 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement comes three days after the company said it was considering 
closing some of its stores. The company, which is seeking new investment 
capital, earlier said it was considering filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and 
the sale of some or all of its assets. 
</P>
<P>
The six stores, including one in Fullerton, are slated to be shuttered Monday 
after close-out sales to try to sell off as much merchandise as possible. The 
remaining goods will be transferred to other stores in the chain, the company 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The manager at the Fullerton store said everything is being sold for 25% off. 
He declined further comment. The other stores being closed are in La Mirada, 
Riverside, Moreno Valley, Oceanside and Covina. 
</P>
<P>
About two-thirds of the approximately 250 employees working at the stores will 
be laid off. The remainder will be reassigned to more profitable stores in the 
Fountain Valley-based chain, company officials said. The firm employs about 
1,200 workers. 
</P>
<P>
National Lumber, which was founded in 1942 by Sol Jaffee, has been struggling 
with losses for several years as it faced greater competition from 
home-building super-store chains, such as HomeClub and Home Depot. 
</P>
<P>
The company said earlier this week that it expects to report a reduction in net 
worth and a "significant loss" for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended 
Jan. 31. National Lumber lost $4.4 million in the nine months that ended Oct. 
31 on revenues of $108 million. 
</P>
<P>
Its financial problems have made some of its suppliers skittish, and the 
company has been unable to stock its stores sufficiently as a result. The store 
consolidation should help by moving some merchandise to other stores. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the company met with about 200 suppliers who informally agreed to 
keep shipping goods on a collect-on-delivery basis. The suppliers, who also 
formed a creditors committee, also agreed not to press claims for repayment of 
past debts until April 6. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials told the suppliers then that a few marginal stores would be 
closed. The closings are designed to give the entire chain a quick infusion of 
cash and help restock the remaining stores with much-needed merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
In its statement Thursday, National Lumber reiterated that it was continuing to 
study steps to restructure, including seeking new capital and greater credit. 
The company has been negotiating for several weeks with its major secured 
creditor, Fidelcor Business Credit Corp., National Lumber has been seeking to 
restructure its $13-million revolving credit account with Fidelcor under a 
two-year agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The company reiterated that it is considering a Chapter 11 filing under the 
Federal Bankruptcy Code. Such a petition would allow the company to reorganize 
while protecting it from its creditors. 
</P>
<P>
The company also said it is continuing to refocus its marketing strategy. It is 
considering subleasing space in stores to other enterprises and trying to 
implement new marketing strategies in its stores, such as creating centers for 
sales of French-style doors and windows. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

LIZ CLAIBORNE OUTLET MAY HELP LABEL'S SALES AT DEPARTMENT STORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Compiled by Chris Woodyard, Times staff writer

<TEXT>
<P>
When designer Liz Claiborne opens her own store at South Coast Plaza in August, 
don't expect to see panic in the large department stores that already carry the 
label. 
</P>
<P>
The popular theory is that a designer label's own store creates a new awareness 
that boosts, rather that reduces, sales of the same merchandise in nearby 
department stores. Or at least that's what Liz Claiborne officials are hoping 
will happen at South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
The popular mall in Costa Mesa is already one of the top sales locations for 
Liz Claiborne's line of upscale women's wear. The line is sold at such 
department stores as Nordstrom, May Co., Robinson's, Bullock's and the 
Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
Come this summer, Liz Claiborne will open a large store on the second level 
that will hawk the designer's entire line, from shoes to perfumes. So far, 
however, experience has shown that overall sales of the line thrive, according 
to a Liz Claiborne official. 
</P>
<P>
"In all the malls we've gone into, business for Liz Claiborne in the 
(department) stores has gone up," because the line gets stronger recognition 
from consumers, said Deirdre Deutsch, director of training and market 
development for Liz Claiborne in New York. 
</P>
<P>
At least one department store spokeswoman said that her store will continue 
selling Liz Claiborne apparel and will see what happens. "We are going to 
continue to serve our customers the best way we can," said Nordstrom 
spokeswoman Lucy Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
Other designers have already paved the way. 
</P>
<P>
The Polo/Ralph Lauren store has prospered at South Coast Plaza for five years, 
along with the companion Polo Country store across the street in Crystal Court. 
All the while, department stores carry large sections of Polo menswear and 
Ralph Lauren women's apparel. 
</P>
<P>
Jacques Vert, a London-based manufacturer of women's wear, opened a store in 
Newport Center Fashion Island and will open another Saturday at the Brea Mall, 
even as its merchandise is still sold in specialty stores. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just giving the brand name exposure," said Svend Ingerslev, executive 
director of the retail division of the new chain. "We've been hoping that we 
will enhance our wholesale business (by selling the label through) the retail 
stores." 
</P>
<P>
What's in a Name?: At least Liz Claiborne is a real person, as is Ralph Lauren. 
But in the world of designer clothing, it's getting harder to tell a designer 
from a designer name. 
</P>
<P>
AnnTaylorCQ Inc., for instance, is opening a new store in the Brea Mall next 
week, one of five new stores opening in the state this spring. Although the 
chain claims to be the nation's fastest-growing specialty store, it cannot 
claim a flesh-and-blood namesake. AnnTaylor, with the name squashed together, 
doesn't exist. 
</P>
<P>
Jacques Vert is a different case. He doesn't exist, either, but the name is an 
amalgam of two very real designers who founded the company in 1973. The 
"Jacques" is Jack Cynamon and the "Vert" is Alan Green. In French, Jack is 
Jacques and the color green is vert.

SAYING CIAO TO A RED FERRARI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER, Patrick Mott is a regular contributor to 
Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Do you like your brother? Let's see how much: 
</P>
<P>
Would you let him drive your Ferrari? 
</P>
<P>
Sure, you'll loan your brother your raw silk sport coat if he promises not to 
spill Chianti on it, and you'll let him use your golf clubs and maybe give him 
the keys to the Jeep if he's got a hot date. 
</P>
<P>
But are you going to hold the door for him while he eases behind the wheel of 
your red 308 GTS, gets a big possessive grin on his face and goes rocketing off 
to Palm Springs? Well? 
</P>
<P>
Sure, said Salvatore Crivello. You bet, said Sebastiano Crivello. No sweat, 
said Vincenzo Crivello. 
</P>
<P>
After all, the Crivello brothers have shared almost everything for most of 
their lives: a birthplace in Porticello, Sicily; a delicatessen business in 
Lynwood; a small chain of pizza takeout places and now three Orange County 
Italian restaurants. Trading the Ferrari around was duck soup. 
</P>
<P>
It helps to know that the three Crivellos (and their two other brothers, 
Massimo and Baldassare) are incurably jovial, voluble and outgoing -- they can 
talk as much with their hands as with their mouths -- and appear to have 
learned that lesson about not sweating the small stuff. 
</P>
<P>
At Ciao in Santa Ana, one of their three restaurants, Vincenzo, 33, and 
Sebastiano, 28, flip pizzas and dish up pasta and other dishes in the kitchen 
while Salvatore, 30, handles the counter and often works the room with, among 
other things, card tricks. 
</P>
<P>
Baldassare, 27, and Massimo, 18, usually work at the second Ciao in Dana Point. 
Their mother shows up frequently "to give us problems," Salvatore says, smiling 
broadly. "She tells us what's right and what's not right." The Crivellos' 
father works in San Pedro as a commercial fisherman and helps out in the Ciao 
kitchen on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
The family moved from their native Sicily to South Gate in 1972 "because mom 
felt that the five brothers would have a better chance in America than in 
Sicily," Vincenzo said. "She wanted a better future for us. We all got a job 
within six months. And she decided that the best thing for us was to get into a 
business together, and that's when we bought the delicatessen in Lynwood." 
</P>
<P>
Next came the five pizza takeout stores, which the brothers eventually sold, 
Salvatore said, "because we wanted to get a little more serious and get into 
the restaurant business. We wanted something more fun than a pizza place, where 
we could enjoy it, tell a few jokes." 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana Ciao was opened four years ago, followed by the Dana Point 
restaurant six months ago. And the brothers are preparing to open a third 
restaurant, called Rumari, in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
It has all been a lot of hard work, the brothers say. But since 1984, the few 
leisure hours were made all the sweeter by the fact that in the family garage 
was a red Ferrari 308 GTS. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a dream car," Salvatore said wistfully. "Since we were kids, it was our 
dream to buy a Ferrari. We used to follow Ferraris on the freeway. A Ferrari 
was the ultimate thing. But we couldn't each afford one. So we figured with 
what money we had, we'd buy a Ferrari and share it." To Italians, Vincenzo 
explained, a Ferrari is a kind of Holy Grail. 
</P>
<P>
"In Italy," he said, "it's so prestigious. When we came here, that's all we 
talked about:, Ferrari, Ferrari, Ferrari. When we came here, though, the dream 
was possible." 
</P>
<P>
"We worked so hard," Sebastiano said, "we felt like we had to get that 
Ferrari." 
</P>
<P>
The 308 GTS was actually less of a shared possession than an addition to the 
Crivello family motor pool. The family already owned a handful of cars 
(Massimo, Salvatore and Vincenzo live with their parents in Santa Ana and 
Baldassare and Sebastiano, who are both married, live next door to each other 
in Costa Mesa) and drove them almost interchangeably, according to Salvatore. 
</P>
<P>
There were no disagreements about who drove the Ferrari or when, Vincenzo said, 
but priority generally was given to Sebastiano, who did the cosmetic and 
maintenance work on it. Baldassare was too young for a driver's license at the 
time and Massimo seldom drove it, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers talk about the car in the same voices that they might use to talk 
about former, and beloved, girlfriends. 
</P>
<P>
"The best feeling about owning a Ferrari," Vincenzo said, "is when you have it 
inside a garage and on a Saturday or a Sunday morning you open the garage and 
there's this beautiful car sitting inside. It's a joy. It just makes your day. 
It's beautiful, like a painting." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he added, "it's a beast. It's more than machinery, it's emotional. It's 
not easy to control. It's a shock. And the engine is right behind your head and 
that makes it so damn hot in there, it's like a Formula race. You have to take 
the top off." And, Salvatore said, there's that sound . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We have a friend who has a (Ferrari) 328," he said, "and he says that just the 
engine noise when you're driving the car is worth 50% of the cost. It's like a 
jet engine." 
</P>
<P>
"And that's when you get all the looks," said Sebastiano, grinning. Today, 
however, the Crivellos' dream car is in someone else's garage. "We made a major 
investment in it," said Vincenzo, "and since we bought the new restaurant, we 
needed some fast cash. After five years (of owning the car), we decided that it 
had to go. It was the best thing to do, but it was a major loss." 
</P>
<P>
Even though the lovely high whine of the engine is gone, the brothers aren't 
spending too much time grieving for their sleek, red beauty. They remember an 
earlier day, in 1976, when they had pooled their money and ordered an American 
muscle car, a Pontiac Trans-Am, to be shared among them. 
</P>
<P>
"A friend of ours said, 'Why buy a car with that money? You can take it and put 
it into a business and that business will buy you a car and a house and so 
forth,' " Salvatore recalled. "I thought that made a lot of sense. I went home 
and told everybody about it and they said yeah, yeah, yeah." 
</P>
<P>
They took the Trans-Am money and bought the delicatessen with it. 
</P>
<P>
Now they're taking the Ferrari money and opening the Laguna Beach restaurant 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, if everything works out," Salvatore said, "maybe this time we'll buy 
three Ferraris instead of one."

ANN CONWAY: CATERERS DUEL FOR NIXON'S SHINDIG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The heat is on. Hot parties have caterers cooking up bids. At the top of the 
list: the weeklong July opening of the President Richard M. Nixon Library. 
</P>
<P>
Who will whip up the continental breakfast for Nixon and 30 VIP guests, the 
Yorba Linda Leadership reception, the bash for docents, the luncheon for 3,000 
Nixon fans? 
</P>
<P>
Pennington of Santa Ana is a strong contender. The catering company -- which 
made sure lobster was on the barbie for Sly Stallone last year when Elton John 
tossed him a birthday bash -- dished up a sampling for members of the library's 
grand-opening committee this week. 
</P>
<P>
Five gala planners with discerning palates came to Pennington to savor its 
fennel sausages in puff pastry, duck tacos, grilled swordfish, veal tortellini 
and Chinese chicken salads. And, of course, there were desserts to ponder: 
wafer-thin pralines and fist-size strawberries dunked in white and dark 
chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
"We showed them some of our best," says Pennington's party coordinator, Jeff 
Parker, who has pulled off such catering feats as a clambake on the fourth 
floor of a local corporate tower. "It's going to be a big week with lots of 
parties. And each event requires a different menu concept. Some guests may come 
to every affair, so we can't have them dining on repeats." 
</P>
<P>
In other catering coups, Thymes of Costa Mesa landed the year's most elegant 
party when it won the bid for Saturday night's gala opening of the Marbella 
Golf and Country Club in San Juan Capistrano. The chocolate coated dessert 
table include one of Thymes' specialties: Belgian chocolate brownies. 
</P>
<P>
Thymes owner Janet Rosener decided to pave a table with chocolate when she saw 
that the multimillion-dollar club's floors were covered with stone. "We try to 
represent the client's environment rather than shine as a company," says 
Rosener, who also landed the luncheon Gavin and Ninetta Herbert will stage to 
honor Arnold Beckman's 90th birthday next month. "The nicest compliment we can 
receive is, 'The food is fabulous!' not, 'Who's catering?' " 
</P>
<P>
Since she founded her company three years ago, Rosener has fed the hundreds who 
attended billionaire Donald L. Bren's opening of the renovated Newport Center 
Fashion Island; the corporate crowd that runs South Coast Plaza (at last year's 
Christmas breakfast for C.J. Segerstrom &amp; Sons), and, the day the Academy 
Award nominations were announced, bigwigs from Columbia-Tri Star Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Another hot date on Thymes' culinary calendar: the two pre-concert dinners Us 
Magazine will stage to honor singer Billy Joel when he performs in Los Angeles 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
What does it take to become a catering superstar? "Attention to detail and 
style of presentation," says Rosener, who has commanded up to $250,000 for one 
of her ultra-feeds. 
</P>
<P>
For example, when Rosener's chefs whip up her taste bud-blowing brownies, 
they'll use 40 pounds of chocolate, plus chocolate chips, for every batch of 
80. "And they're handmade," Rosener emphasizes. 
</P>
<P>
When the candy table top arrives at Marbella, Thymes chefs will have used 300 
pounds of pricey Belgian chocolate to create it. "We go for the interesting, 
not the weird," Rosener says. 
</P>
<P>
Rosener's dream is to cater the post-Academy Awards bash in 1992. Next year's 
Academy Awards party will be catered by Along Came Mary, the Los Angeles 
caterer who will feed the stylish crowd (Lakers' coach Pat Riley and actress 
Connie Sellecca, among them) who will attend the opening of Sports Club/Irvine 
on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
While Rosener has her eye on L.A., Mary Miccuci, owner of Along Came Mary, has 
her eye on Orange County. "There's a lot happening there," says Miccuci, who 
says she catered every major movie premiere last summer. "And it's only 40 
minutes away." 
</P>
<P>
Another hot name on the tongues of party planners is Alan Greeley, owner of the 
Golden Truffle in Costa Mesa. Greeley landed the catering contract for the new 
Robert Mondavi Wine and Food Center in Costa Mesa. And just last week, he fed 
guests at soirees staged at the homes of Forbes 400 developers William Lyon and 
George Argyros. 
</P>
<P>
Creating hot party fare recently won Greeley the California Seafood Challenge. 
His recipe for baked Santa Barbara prawns and northern pike with pomegranate 
and orange butter sauce beat out the creations of 700 rival chefs. 
</P>
<P>
"I love to cook," says Greeley, who last year flew to the French Riviera to 
cater a party for visitors to the Cannes Film Festival. "And I cook from the 
heart. To cook for a crowd and succeed, it has to be your passion."

WHAT HAPPENED TO BAL WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

For rent, Easter Week: 3-bedroom party house with view, patio and fireplace. 
Only two house rules: no opium smoking in elevators and guests must bury their 
own dead. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1960 classified ad for a Balboa rental 
</P>
<P>
Sleep? Who could sleep? There was too much cruising to do, too many parties to 
go to, too much dancing, too many knockout girls, too many cute guys, too much 
sun, too much beach, too much surf, too much music and noise and laughter and 
pure screaming fun. 
</P>
<P>
And just one week to do it all! 
</P>
<P>
But it was Bal Week, and you could do it all if you could keep going for seven 
days. If you didn't die of pure sensory overload, you could have the time of 
your life. It was just you and your pals and your cars and thousands and 
thousands of kids and one week of glorious springtime without mom and dad. 
</P>
<P>
Bal Week. 
</P>
<P>
Those were holy words to any Southern California kid. For more than 40 years, 
Easter Week in Balboa was a sacred quest for the most fun you could possibly 
have in one school vacation. 
</P>
<P>
From the late 1920s to the late 1960s, until police and landlord crackdowns 
cooled the fervor, legions of students swarmed the peninsula. They filled the 
local cash registers with a sudden infusion of money, filling the ramshackle 
little rental cottages with dozens of their friends, filling the air with music 
from thousands of radios and the throaty rumble from thousands of souped-up 
engines and, sometimes, filling the Newport Beach Jail. 
</P>
<P>
"In the early days, it was the only place," said Robert Gardner, 78, a retired 
appellate court judge who spent his first Easter Week in Balboa in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody went anywhere else. It was roaring great in Balboa through the 20s and 
30s. I grew up in it. I was a part of it then, and in those days it was loud 
and rowdy. At that time it was just a little honky-tonk resort town, and 
(during Easter Week) the population doubled and tripled. The town only existed 
for Easter and summer vacation. There was a very small year-around population, 
in the hundreds, and all the rest were rental cottages. They were these little 
ramshackle places that the kids couldn't hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Not that they didn't try. Landlords' horror stories were legion. 
</P>
<P>
It was common practice for a small handful of students to rent, say, a 
three-bedroom apartment for the week and, once the deal was signed, throw the 
doors open to 20 or 30 of their friends. 
</P>
<P>
One well-circulated story involved a group of restless Bal Week boarders who 
decided to improve the decor of their cottage by frying up a couple dozen eggs 
and nailing them to the walls. 
</P>
<P>
Another group of students, supposedly trying to cook a small meal over a fire 
in an ashtray, found themselves staring through a hole in the floor when the 
heated ashtray burned through and fell into the living room on the floor below. 
</P>
<P>
The tradition of silliness was firmly solidified by the time Bob Snyder showed 
up at his first Bal Week in 1943. 
</P>
<P>
"Boy, this was the place," said Snyder, now the manager of the Balboa Island 
Ferry Co. "It was the natural thing to come here. Every night was a different 
adventure. I was in the service and I came out here from Ohio, and I'd never 
seen so many people in one crowd before. It was pretty wild. There were some 
big fights, and there was trouble with drinking, but I think the kids did a lot 
of things that were fun. They had a great time. And there were lots of parties. 
Lots of parties." 
</P>
<P>
They went on all night, said Snyder, 67, who returned to Balboa after the war 
and began working on the Balboa Island Ferry in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed that everyone, at one time of the day or night, had to hit the ferry 
once or twice," he said. "There were times at night when we couldn't even haul 
cars, there was such a big mob of people (on board). We'd quit about 2 in the 
morning, but the cars would cruise the streets all night long. And then at 
about 10 in the morning, you'd see the kids start to hit the streets again. I 
imagine they lost a lot of sleep that week." 
</P>
<P>
But they always managed to get themselves, nearly every day, to the one spot 
that was the undisputed focal point of Bal Week revelry: the Rendezvous 
Ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rendezvous was the center of everything," said Gardner, who worked as a 
ticket-taker at the ballroom as a student. 
</P>
<P>
"All day long, everybody went to the beach and got their white skin all 
sunburned and drank and then they went to the Rendezvous at night. It was the 
place to go. Any kid worth his salt was going to be at the Rendezvous." 
</P>
<P>
The Rendezvous Ballroom, which stood on the ocean side of the peninsula between 
Washington and Palm streets, was such a constant in Bal Week lore that veteran 
Bal Week aficionados referred to it simply as The Place. 
</P>
<P>
In the '30s and '40s, a house band played there most nights, but there were 
frequent short runs or one-night stands by bands led by Tommy Dorsey, Glenn 
Miller, Benny Goodman, Les Brown, Harry James, Guy Lombardo and others. Stan 
Kenton's band became a semi-regular at the Rendezvous. 
</P>
<P>
The Rendezvous was a meeting place, a social touchstone and a magnet. But when 
the big-band era faded, so did much of the music at the Rendezvous. Until Dick 
Dale showed up there in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
Dale and his Del Tones inaugurated what came to be known as the surfing sound 
at the Rendezvous, characterized by a twangy electric guitar lead. Dale 
eventually became known as the King of the Surf Guitar. And during Bal Week, 
the kids ate it up. 
</P>
<P>
"Cars were lined up bumper to bumper all the way to the Pacific Coast Highway, 
and all the kids were playing 'Let's Go Trippin' ' on their car radios," said 
Dale, who now lives in Twentynine Palms. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the thing to do during Bal Week to come to the Rendezvous and see Dick 
Dale," he said. "Bal Week was the explosion week when everyone let their hair 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Dale added to the explosion, he said, by testing the new amplifiers being made 
at the time by the Fender Corp. He said he blew 40 of them at the Rendezvous. 
</P>
<P>
"Fender figured if they could withstand Dick Dale they could withstand the 
public," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dale, who had a record store on the peninsula in the late '50s and early '60s, 
said Bal Week in that era had everything but privacy. 
</P>
<P>
"You could not go out of your house and expect to drive to the store," said 
Dale, who still ends his telephone conversations with "surf's up." "Once you 
were on the peninsula, you couldn't get off. Everybody had a party on every 
single front porch. There were about a hundred kids on everybody's porch." 
</P>
<P>
And if they weren't on the porch, they were in a car. And the cars were 
probably hot-rods. But, Dale said, there was one car that everybody wanted to 
drive to Balboa in the early '60s: A Ford wood-paneled station wagon. A woody. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a 1940 Ford woody, and ahhh, it was so bitchin'," Dale said. "We used 
to bleach the wood and take the tailgates down and chrome them, and the girls 
would jump in, and we'd pack a lunch and go surfing. Everybody had to have a 
surfboard sticking out of the back of their woody." 
</P>
<P>
But those days were numbered. Newport Beach in the early '60s was quickly 
turning from a resort town into a city of mostly permanent residents. The 
number of rental properties available to Bal Week vacationers decreased -- as 
did landlords' tolerance for misbehavior. 
</P>
<P>
Police tolerance waned too. A new police chief, B. James Glavas, promised 
tighter control of Bal Week activities, and arrests increased. In 1966, 
officers made 347 arrests during the first three days of Bal Week alone. 
</P>
<P>
"We worked 12-hour shifts and a one-hour briefing before we went out and a 
one-hour post-briefing, so we were working a good 14 hours a day" during Bal 
Week, said Newport Beach Police Sgt. Dave Elliott, who was a patrol officer 
during Bal Weeks of the '60s. "Our biggest problems were traffic and the party 
houses, and there were a lot of fights and alcohol and that type of thing. But 
we didn't have the near-riotous scenes you sometimes see today in other 
situations. We didn't have rock and bottle throwing." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Bal Week was doomed. As the '60s wore on, students began to go to Palm 
Springs or the Colorado River for Easter Week. Today, Elliott said, Easter Week 
in Balboa is considered more of a family holiday than a high school and 
collegiate blowout. 
</P>
<P>
Some Bal Week veterans say the last true Bal Week was in 1969, when one Times 
story reported that "the wild shenanigans that once marked Bal Week appear to 
have ended." Others point to the previous year, when a sort of Requiem for Bal 
Week appeared in a Times editorial. 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, say Bal Week came to a sadder and more poetic end on Saturday, 
Aug. 7, 1966. At about 4 that morning, the big building at 608 E. Ocean Front 
was consumed by flames. When the sun came up, the Rendezvous Ballroom was a 
pile of ashes and scorched brick. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, someone scrawled on a piece of standing brick with a piece of

"Back then they were good, clean kids. Today I'm afraid you'd have more 
trouble."

"Those days were wonderful," Dale said, "because of the cleanliness of the 
people. I never saw the kids get out of control. Balboa always stood for 
romance in those days. And it's another beautiful memory in my life. But it can 
never be the same again."

HIGH LIFE A WEEKLY FORUM FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS; 
</P>
<P>
CYPRESS MOCK-COUNSEL COURTS SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BLYTHE LATIMER, Blythe Latimer is a junior at Cypress High School, where she 
is editor of the student newspaper, Centurion Scroll. Her hobbies include 
reading, dancing and swimming. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They made the motions when they had the notions, and as a result, the 
mock-trial team from Cypress High School is headed to the state capital. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-member team will represent Orange County at the state mock-trial 
competition April 5 to 7 in Sacramento, having won the right by defeating Santa 
Margarita High School in the county final in December. 
</P>
<P>
Mock-trial teams from Cypress are no strangers to success. Two years ago the 
team won both the county and state competitions and last year finished second 
in the county. 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, Cypress will go up against teams from more than 30 other 
schools, each representing its county. The winner of the state competition will 
qualify for the national competition in May in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
"I know we've got the talent to win, and if we're all doing our best, we'll 
knock 'em dead," said Amy Vaughn, a junior member who serves as a witness for 
Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing, whether we win or lose," Vaughn said, "I'm positive that our team 
will have a great time in Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
The mock-trial program, in its ninth year and with 48 high schools competing on 
the local level, is sponsored by the Constitutional Rights Foundation, a 
nonprofit organization founded by lawyers and others 28 years ago to educate 
students about the legal system. 
</P>
<P>
The students in mock trial portray defense and prosecution attorneys as well as 
witnesses on both sides of each case that is tried. 
</P>
<P>
In December's county final -- a culmination of a season's worth of eight rounds 
of competition -- the Cypress team represented the prosecutorial side of a mock 
case involving issues of gun ownership and homicide. The case was tried before 
Orange County Superior Court Judge Gary L. Taylor and two other judges. 
</P>
<P>
The Cypress team, including mock lawyers Lori Uyeno, a senior, and Jyoti Nanda 
and April Balangue, both juniors, received information about the case in 
October, giving it four weeks to prepare for its first competition. 
</P>
<P>
The students put in more than 180 hours in practice sessions, which often 
required sacrificing social and study time. 
</P>
<P>
The other team members are seniors Alice Ho (pretrial attorney), Karen Ahlstedt 
(witness), Angela Banchi (witness), Keri Bogdanovich (witness), April Lott 
(witness) and juniors Stacey Brooks (witness), Lydia Kim (witness), Elise 
Tiregol (witness), David Brown (clerk) and Chris Walters (bailiff). 
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional Rights Foundation recently honored two members of the 
Cypress team. Uyeno was named the county's outstanding attorney and Ho the 
county's top pretrial attorney -- an honor won by Cypress students for three 
consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Rozenberg, who works out of the district attorney's office in Santa Ana, 
has volunteered his time during the past four years to work with the Cypress 
mock-trial team. He has been joined recently by attorneys Dan McNerney and 
Jerry Johnston. 
</P>
<P>
John Gruendyke, coach of the Cypress team since its beginning five years ago 
and teacher of history at the high school, is grateful for the help. 
</P>
<P>
"I have three things to credit for the success of our program," he said. "The 
kids, the attorneys and the judges who hear the cases. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's terrific that these people, with their hectic schedules, 
volunteer their time to work with the kids." 
</P>

WHEN RADIO STATIONS CHANGE THEIR TUNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Let me start by saying that I regularly read and enjoy (Joseph Bell's) columns. 
(Not everyone in Orange County is a conservative.) 
</P>
<P>
Your March 22 column on the demise of KFAC and the changes at KKGO hit a 
particularly sensitive nerve, hence this rare letter. Radio station programmers 
around here are beginning to act like auto designers in Detroit. They don't 
listen to their consumers; rather, they put out what they think we'll like and 
what they think will make oodles of money from them. 
</P>
<P>
I used to have three well-used buttons on my car radio, each set at a favorite 
station. Until recently. One was on KEDG because they played the best of the 
new rock music, as opposed to dance or rap music. One was on KFAC, for the 
classical music. And one was on KKGO, for jazz of the older variety. 
</P>
<P>
Life was wonderful for a while. I could listen to some good new rock music, and 
when traffic was bad and I didn't want to get into an overly aggressive mood, I 
could listen to classical or some smooth jazz and drift along our freeways. 
</P>
<P>
But then KEDG dropped an amazingly fine rock music format and became one of 
those Muzak style light rock stations. KFAC, of course, became the zillionth 
rock station on the dial (as you so aptly put it). And KKGO, in attempting to 
fill the classical vacuum, dropped jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Now I have only the classical music, which I can't always get here in south 
Orange County. KUSC isn't often receivable here in swallow country, either. The 
management at KKGO has tried to convert people to an AM jazz outlet, but you 
can't get that down here, and it's not a nice clean stereo signal when you 
can't receive it successfully. KLON in Long Beach is no alternative, since its 
signal is so weak. And KSBR at Saddleback College tends to play more fusion and 
New Wave music than what I consider to be real jazz. 
</P>
<P>
I think you're right. Perhaps we should all volunteer to pay $100 a year for a 
new jazz outlet as well as a classical one. I'd gladly pay $300 a year to have 
my three old stations back. Is this progress? How'd you like to start a new 
station here in Orange County?

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
TEACHERS' PACT FIGHT DRAGS IN CHAMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chamber of Commerce's annual meeting scheduled tonight has emerged as the 
latest battleground in the contract dispute between the Huntington Beach City 
School District and its teachers association. 
</P>
<P>
Union leaders say a chamber committee has chosen the district's superintendent, 
Diana Peters, to be among its candidates for its Citizen of the Year award, to 
be announced at the banquet. 
</P>
<P>
That move prompted the association this week to address a letter to the chamber 
assailing her nomination. 
</P>
<P>
"Although Dr. Peters may appear to the committee to be a good citizen, we'd 
like them to also be aware how demoralized we now are and that she is the main 
cause of that," union president Sharon Boudreau said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Riddell, the chamber's executive vice president, declined to say whether 
Peters is in contention for the award. Nominees' names traditionally are kept 
confidential to avoid influential business leaders lobbying in their behalf, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how (union officials) got their information, but we haven't told 
anyone who the winner is . . . or who is being considered," Riddell said. "I'm 
amused at how involved they've become with this. It's rather interesting." 
</P>
<P>
Peters did not return repeated phone calls to her office Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The chamber gives the award each year to a person living or working in 
Huntington Beach whose volunteer work the past year is considered to be heroic, 
humanist or charitable, Riddell said. 
</P>
<P>
When asked what effect the district's letter might have on the selection 
process, Riddell said, "Absolutely none." The committee made its choice two 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
The district's contract dispute centers on teachers' demands for pay raises and 
a guarantee they will not be forced to shoulder the burden of future 
health-care cost hikes. The dispute has grown increasingly antagonistic since 
it formally reached an impasse in October. The union's charges against the 
district have been directed largely at Peters, culminating last week when it 
formally issued a no-confidence vote against the superintendent to the school 
board. 
</P>
<P>
The union had originally hoped to picket outside tonight's banquet at the 
exclusive Seacliff Country Club but backed away from those plans because 
protesters legally could be dispersed for demonstrating on private property, 
Boudreau said. JOHN PENNER

The state Supreme Court on Thursday denied a hearing to a La Palma couple 
seeking insurance coverage for damage to the foundation of their home. 
</P>
<P>
Steven and Francine Brodkin sought the high court hearing after the state's 4th 
District Court of Appeal ruled in January that their State Farm Fire &amp; 
Casualty Co. policy did not cover the damage. 
</P>
<P>
The Brodkins contended that cracks in the floor and in the foundation of their 
house were due to corrosive material in the soil. In their suit against State 
Farm, they also contended that the damage was due to negligent construction. 
</P>
<P>
In the lower court, the Brodkins' attorneys argued that their policy did not 
specifically exclude coverage for corrosion. 
</P>
<P>
But State Farm attorneys argued that the damage was due to earth movement, an 
element of normal wear and tear, and therefore not covered by the policy. The 
Court of Appeal agreed, ruling that the policy would not cover any of the 
potential causes for the damage, including soil corrosion, builder negligence 
and earth movement. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of other La Palma residents began noticing the damage in the late 1970s 
and early 1980s, and suits also have been filed by homeowners in Cypress and in 
parts of southeast Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Bidart, the Brodkins' attorney, said the decision puts 116 similar 
cases that he is handling in "tremendous jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
He added that attorneys might seek to argue some of the remaining cases through 
other means, including a state law that requires insurance companies to inform 
their customers if parts of their coverage are being dropped. Some of clients, 
he said, originally had coverage for builder negligence, and were not told when 
their carrier dropped such coverage from their contracts. TED JOHNSON

SENATE HOPEFULS FOCUS ON ABORTION;

CAMPAIGN: THREE CANDIDATES SEEKING THE 31ST DISTRICT SEAT COMPARE THEIR 
DIFFERENCES AND SIMILARITIES ON THE ISSUE OF REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS.

In their only meeting of a hard-fought campaign, three candidates seeking to 
replace state Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) discussed their 
stances Thursday on the politically hot topic of abortion. 
</P>
<P>
During a call-in show on cable television, all three candidates said they 
support abortion in the event of rape or incest or to save the life of the 
mother. They differed on whether minors should be required to receive parental 
consent for abortions and whether laws should prohibit abortions for other 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Democrat Janice Graham, whose support for abortion rights has been a major 
issue in her campaign, said she favors a woman's right to choose abortion in 
almost any circumstance. She hesitated, however, about supporting abortion as a 
means of choosing the sex of a baby. 
</P>
<P>
Graham also said she supports the distribution of RU-486, a pill developed in 
France that can induce abortion without surgery. And she described her 
experience with abortion to save a life. 
</P>
<P>
"When my mother was giving birth to me, the doctors came out and said to my 
father, 'Which one do you want?' because they couldn't save us both," Graham 
said. "My father said he wanted his wife. He made the right choice, but 
fortunately for me the doctors were able to save us both." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier), the front-runner in the April 10 election, 
said he supported abortion in the cases of incest and rape and also to save the 
life of the mother. He is opposed to abortion in other cases and supports a 
requirement that juveniles be required to receive parental consent before 
getting an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"I support abortion for very limited circumstances," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Lewis, a candidate from the American Independent Party, said he supports 
abortion rights and believes that existing laws are adequate. He said, however, 
that he is opposed to abortion in the case of sex selection or after the first 
trimester. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like the government getting anywhere near my family's matters," Lewis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The three candidates are the winners of a Feb. 6 primary to represent the 31st 
state Senate District. The predominantly Republican district straddles the 
border between Orange and Los Angeles counties stretching from West Covina and 
Whittier in the north to Laguna Beach in the south. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday was also the deadline for the candidates to file their last financial 
disclosure statements before the election. 
</P>
<P>
Graham reported that she has raised a total of $28,456 during the campaign and 
now has a small debt. Hill reported that his campaign has raised $525,981 since 
the race began late last December.

GONZALES MIGHT OUTRUN HIS IDENTITY CRISIS 
</P>

<P>
Even when standing beside the slimmest of his distance-running peers, Mark 
Gonzales still stands out -- if not for his 6-foot, 115-pound frame, then for 
his wild mane of dark brown hair that hangs several inches below his shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
But aside from these physical characteristics, and the fact that he finished 
last cross-country season as the fastest runner in Orange County, the La Habra 
High School junior has managed to keep a profile so low, most of the county's 
top runners or their coaches have no idea who Gonzales is. 
</P>
<P>
That's just fine with Gonzales. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to keep off to the side," he said. "I like to sit in the back, waiting 
until my time comes." 
</P>
<P>
Based on his performance last fall, that time would seem to be now. 
</P>
<P>
In the Orange County Cross-Country Championships last October, Gonzales ran the 
third-fastest time of the day overall, just a few seconds behind the county's 
two most celebrated runners, San Clemente's Mike Farrell and Dana Hills' Daniel 
Niednagel. But because Gonzales ran in an unseeded race, few of his competitors 
noticed his performance. 
</P>
<P>
One month later, at the state meet in Fresno, Gonzales ran faster than any 
county runner, including Farrell. A week later at the Kinney Western Regional 
championships at Fresno, he finished 11th overall in a field of about 200 of 
the best high school runners in the Western United States. 
</P>
<P>
His time, 15 minutes 19 seconds, was 41 seconds faster than Niednagel, The 
Times' cross-country runner of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw how he did, I just go, 'Whoa!' " Niednagel said. "I mean, that's 
fast. He really showed he can run with the big boys." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales might be able to run with them, but he certainly wouldn't be able to 
identify most top runners in a crowd. Gonzales said he avoids thinking about 
other runners' times, strengths and weaknesses altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad brings out the papers and starts reading off people's times and stuff, 
but I don't listen," Gonzales said. "I mean, I know, uh, I think his name is, 
what, Nightingale? (Niednagel). And Mike someone (Farrell) from San Clemente . 
. . But I don't really pay attention." 
</P>
<P>
Now, with track season under way, Gonzales will have the opportunity to better 
prove his talent. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has yet to run an all-out effort, Gonzales has clocked a 
four-minute 20-second mile split in a relay earlier this month. As a runner 
with more strength than speed, though, the two-mile would seem to be his better 
distance. Gonzales says his goal is to run 9:10, but others think he might even 
break the nine-minute barrier, something that hasn't been done by a county 
runner in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I see it is that if you have too high expectations, it's only going to 
let you down," said Gonzales, who will run the 800 and 3,200 meters Saturday at 
the Valencia Invitational. "I'd rather surprise myself." 
</P>
<P>
As he often surprises others, not only with his running, but with his 
personality. He is bright -- he carries a 3.8 grade-point average -- but also 
very quiet and often withdrawn. Aside from running, he spends most of his spare 
time alone reading medieval fantasy literature, collecting swords of samurai 
and ninja distinction, and caring for his dog, Tass, and his rabbit, Woodstock. 
</P>
<P>
"Our neighbor says if Mark waves goodby, he's given you a whole conversation," 
Nancy Gonzales, Mark's mother, said. "He's very quiet and real laid back." 
</P>
<P>
How laid back? Consider this: When his parents presented him a nearly new van 
for his 16th birthday last spring, Gonzales politely said thanks, but no 
thanks. 
</P>
<P>
"He just said, 'No thanks, I don't need it,' " his father, Mike Gonzales, said. 
"I'm thinking, he's 16 and this is the perfect car. But he just said no, that 
he could get everywhere he wants on his bike."

Soviet troops occupied Lithuania's Prosecutor's Office today after its staff 
members refused to take orders from a new chief prosecutor appointed by Moscow, 
Lithuanian officials said. 
</P>
<P>
It marked the first time Soviet soldiers have taken control of a Lithuanian 
government building since the Baltic republic defied Moscow and declared its 
independence March 11. 
</P>
<P>
The report came several hours after the White House announced that President 
Bush had sent a letter to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev calling for a peaceful 
resolution in Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, sent via diplomatic channels on Thursday, stated Bush's "support 
and the American support for the aspirations of the Lithuanian people for 
self-determination," presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble began at the Prosecutor's Office earlier today when Moscow 
officials fired Lithuania's chief prosecutor in a bid to make the republic 
adhere to Soviet law, then tried to install a new prosecutor of their choosing. 
</P>
<P>
The move failed when the office's employees said they would remain loyal to 
their former boss. The dispute became a standoff, with both chief prosecutors 
trying to run the office at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Several hours later, soldiers of the Soviet Interior Ministry, with the help of 
one employee, took over the building, Egidius Bickauskas, a Lithuanian 
legislator, said on the republic's television. He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
He accused the Soviet Union of violating the republic's sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
A Lithuanian Interior Ministry spokesman confirmed that Soviet soldiers were 
inside the Prosecutor's Office. He also said the soldiers had moved into the 
Institute of Party History. 
</P>
<P>
A foreign journalist who rushed to the scene said he saw a truckload of Soviet 
Interior Ministry soldiers enter the building. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers previously had occupied a handful of Communist Party buildings in 
Lithuania, but today was the first time they occupied a Lithuanian government 
building. 
</P>
<P>
The standoff began at the office when Moscow officials tried to replace Arturis 
Paulauskas, the prosecutor appointed by the Lithuanian government on March 22. 
Soviet Deputy Prosecutor Alexei Vasiliev told more than 100 members of the 
Lithuanian prosecutor's staff to execute Soviet law. He brought with him an 
ethnic Lithuanian, Antanas Petrauskas, to replace Paulauskas. 
</P>
<P>
Tass later carried a statement from Soviet Prosecutor General Alexander 
Sukharev firing Paulauskas and officially naming Petrauskas as his successor. 
</P>
<P>
Staff members reacted during the meeting with angry questions. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know our government was elected legally?" one employee shouted. 
</P>
<P>
Bickauskas, the Lithuanian legislator, told the staff: 
</P>
<P>
"I hope you will consider your place is in your offices under the leadership of 
Mr. Paulauskas." Nearly everyone applauded as they rose to leave the room and 
returned to their desks. 
</P>
<P>
"You must obey the orders of the general prosecutor of the U.S.S.R.," Vasiliev 
said in a raised voice as people left. But his appeal had little effect until 
the building was taken over later.

ARMED FAN BREAKS INTO GLESS' HOME; 
</P>

ACTRESS: DISTRAUGHT INVADER BARRICADES SELF IN BATHROOM, SURRENDERS IN 
SEVEN-HOUR STANDOFF.

A distraught fan armed with a rifle broke into the unoccupied Studio City home 
of actress Sharon Gless this morning and barricaded herself in a bathroom, 
police said. The woman, who reportedly threatened suicide, surrendered unharmed 
almost seven hours later after talking with police negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said Joni Leigh Penn, 30, had been under a court order to stop 
bothering the co-star of the television show "Cagney and Lacey." 
</P>
<P>
Penn forced her way into the house in the 4700 block of Teesdale Avenue about 
3:15 a.m., triggering a silent burglar alarm, according to Officer C. K. Wikamp 
of the Los Angeles Police Department's North Hollywood station. 
</P>
<P>
"When officers arrived, they spotted her inside," Witkamp said. "She spotted 
them and she pointed (the rifle) at her head, threatening to shoot herself." 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Dan Watson, the station commander, said police brought in a Special 
Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team and evacuated the homes surrounding the 
secluded, single-story house at the end of a short cul-de-sac backing the 
Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
A specially trained police negotiator was brought in to talk to Penn, who had 
retreated into a back bathroom and locked the door. According to Watson, Penn 
objected that the negotiator was a man and a woman negotiator was summoned. 
</P>
<P>
As the morning wore on, scores of reporters and camera operators descended on 
the quiet, middle-class neighborhood. In addition to local news crews, there 
were camera teams from the entertainment beat and reporters representing 
foreign media. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors told reporters that Gless had owned the house for years but now only 
visited the home occasionally, preferring to live instead in another home in 
the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
The morning's long wait ended at 10 a.m. with an announcement by Watson that 
Penn had surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
"She finally wore down, got tired, came out and turned over the weapon," the 
captain said. 
</P>
<P>
Police hustled the short, plump, handcuffed woman into a patrol car and drove 
her to the North Hollywood station for questioning. The rifle, a semiautomatic 
.22-caliber AT-22, was confiscated as evidence. Police did not say whether it 
was loaded. 
</P>
<P>
The court order was issued Nov. 16, 1988, on the grounds that Penn had harassed 
and threatened Gless and her family, in part by writing the actress a number of 
letters. It ordered Penn to remain at least 1,000 yards from the home. 
</P>
<P>
Court files show Penn's psychiatrist had told Gless in January, 1988, that his 
patient had threatened to shoot herself in front of the actress. On Oct. 25, 
1988, Penn allegedly went to the home and told the actress' secretary that she 
had a gun, fleeing before police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Watson said someone shattered a window in an apparent attempt to break into the 
home Monday night but left without making entry. He said Penn apparently 
entered the home this morning by forcing a door. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said that in years past, Gless made no secret of her residence, even 
posting an old street sign by the driveway that proclaimed it "Gless St." In 
recent years, they said, the sign was taken down, and Gless stopped driving a 
car with personalized plates.

Lawyers for condemned killer Robert Alton Harris filed an emergency request 
today asking a federal appeals court to halt his April 3 execution at San 
Quentin -- the first in California in 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals scheduled an afternoon session to hear 
oral arguments on the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The 9th Circuit is one step away from a final appeal by Harris to Supreme Court 
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
Harris' lawyers, Charles Sevilla and Michael McCabe, renewed their argument 
that jurors in Harris' 1978 trial were "fundamentally misled" about his mental 
state and would not have sentenced him to die if they had the information. 
</P>
<P>
Sevilla said evidence of his brain damage, organic personality disorder, fetal 
alcohol effects and post-traumatic stress disorder was not given to the jury 
because psychiatrists failed to investigate properly. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, 37, received the death sentence for the July 5, 1978, murder of Michael 
Baker and John Mayeski, both 16, in the parking lot of a San Diego fast-food 
restaurant.

A Santa Ana woman who allegedly installed hooks in mall restrooms and then 
stole purses from them has been arrested on 40 felony counts of burglary, 
police said today. 
</P>
<P>
Claudia Denise Clark, 33, was arrested at the Orange Mall on Thursday after a 
monthlong investigation by Buena Park police, Officer Rich McMillen said. 
</P>
<P>
She is being held in lieu of $10,000 bail at the Orange County Women's Jail in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
McMillen said investigators believe Clark is responsible for the thefts of 40 
purses from malls in Buena Park, Brea, Orange and Anaheim in the last month. 
</P>
<P>
Clark was arrested about 2:30 p.m. shortly after detectives watched her steal a 
purse from a restroom at the Orange Mall, McMillen said. 
</P>
<P>
"She would steal her victim's purse while it was hanging on the restroom stall 
door as the victim was using the facility," McMillen said. "If there were no 
hooks present on the doors, she would install them." 
</P>
<P>
McMillen said police seized a screwdriver and "various other evidence" from 
Clark's purse that linked her to the operation. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had purses taken from restrooms stalls, but nothing to this extent," 
McMillen said.

U.S. SUPREME COURT AGREES TO DECIDE ON FLAG-BURNING LAW

<P>
The Supreme Court agreed today to decide the constitutionality of an anti-flag 
burning law enacted by Congress last year and to issue a ruling before its 
summer recess. 
</P>
<P>
The court will hear the case on an emergency basis, a move that guarantees it 
will be decided in plenty of time to become an issue in the fall congressional 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
The court's action, in two cases from Washington state and the District of 
Columbia, was announced after the court's usual Friday conference. In a 
three-paragraph order, the justices set arguments in the case for May 14, a 
month after the court's regular session for oral arguments ends. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration had sought immediate review of the constitutionality of 
the Flag Protection Act of 1989, which was passed in anger over a June, 1989, 
Supreme Court ruling that burning the flag as a political protest is a 
constitutionally protected form of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
According to court officials, the last time the Supreme Court set such a rare 
special session was in June, 1981, when the justices heard arguments testing 
the legality of the Iran hostage deal. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-4 ruling in a case from Texas sparked a controversy that saw President 
Bush push for an amendment to the Constitution. Instead, Congress passed the 
Flag Protection Act, although backers of the amendment warned a law would not 
protect the flag.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development's inspector general is 
investigating three no-bid contracts awarded to close friends by the embattled 
director of a new agency that controls millions of dollars in housing money. 
</P>
<P>
Inspector General Paul A. Adams, in a preliminary report to Housing Secretary 
Jack Kemp, said the contracts may have been issued in violation of government 
regulations, a HUD source, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Adams today declined to discuss any preliminary findings but said he hoped to 
make a final report to Kemp next week. Adams said he began the investigation of 
the Federal Housing Finance Board's contracting procedures on Monday at Kemp's 
request and has received full cooperation from the agency. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp raised questions about the contracts during a lengthy meeting Thursday 
with Mary K. Bush, the housing secretary's choice to head the new agency. The 
meeting was arranged after behind-the-scenes efforts by Kemp aides to exert 
influence over the independent agency became public. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Bush has asked Peter Wallison, a former Reagan Administration attorney now 
in private practice, to represent her during the investigation, according to 
her spokesman. She is not related to the President. Attempts to reach Mary Bush 
and Wallison today were unsuccessful; both were reported to be out of town. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Slye, the spokesman for the housing board, confirmed that Adams had 
visited the agency earlier this week and taken several contract files. He said 
Mary Bush had asked the board's own inspector general to look into the 
contracts after HUD officials raised questions about them last week. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Bush awarded the three consulting contracts in question to three close 
friends with whom she had worked in the Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The recipients included Wendell Gunn, Kemp's former chief of staff at HUD, and 
Margery Waxman, who in 1988 represented Charles Keating in his then-successful 
effort to persuade regulators not to seize a troubled California savings and 
loan he owned, Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn. of Irvine, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Both Slye and HUD sources refused to provide details of Kemp's meeting with 
Mary Bush. Also unclear was whether Adams got involved in the investigation at 
Kemp's request, as suggested by the HUD source, or at the request of the 
finance board's own inspector general. 
</P>
<P>
The board oversees the 12 regional Federal Home Loan banks, which must give up 
$400 million of their profits each year to help pay for the bailout of the 
savings and loan industry. 
</P>
<P>
Congress also directed the regional banks to put a percentage of their profits 
each year into affordable housing programs, starting with $78 million this year 
and rising to $100 million.

The Baltic republic of Estonia today declared 50 years of Soviet rule invalid 
and pledged to achieve full independence, the Tass news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies of the Supreme Soviet parliament did not set a date for full 
independence from Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
They opted to debate that on a later date, Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
The move put Estonia on the path toward a possible confrontation with Moscow, 
like that of its Baltic neighbor, Lithuania. Lithuania declared independence 
March 11. 
</P>
<P>
"The Estonian parliament denied the legitimacy of the state power of the Soviet 
Union in Estonia from the moment the Soviet system of government was 
established here," Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
"It also proclaimed the beginning of restoration of the Estonian republic, 
announcing a transition period which will be completed with the formation of 
the Estonian Republic's constitutional agencies of state power," Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
Estonia, like Lithuania and Latvia, gained independence from the ruins of the 
Russian Empire at the end of World War I. But the three republics were annexed 
by Josef Stalin in 1940.

Thousands of Palestinians and Israeli Arabs held rallies and protest marches 
today to mark the 14th anniversary of "Land Day," when bloody riots broke out 
over Israeli confiscation of Arab land. 
</P>
<P>
A general strike closed shops and schools throughout the occupied West Bank and 
Gaza Strip, in Arab East Jerusalem, and in Arab villages in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
In a rare clash inside Israel, police used tear gas to disperse Arab 
demonstrators after an hour of stone throwing by youths in the town of Taibeh, 
reporters said. Israel radio said two firebombs also were thrown. 
</P>
<P>
One policeman was stabbed while arresting stone throwers. He was hospitalized 
in stable condition. Six other officers were injured by stones, the radio said. 
At least five Arabs were taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 Israeli Arabs attended the main Land Day rally in Arraba, where 
two people were killed during the 1976 riots. 
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, Sheik Hamed Bitawi complained that Israeli soldiers and police 
prevented thousands of Muslims from attending Friday prayer services at Al Aqsa 
Mosque, one of Islam's holiest sites. 
</P>
<P>
"We pray to God to avenge this wrong," Bitawi told the prayer service. "The 
Zionists have committed an injustice against us. Soldiers are here as if it is 
a battlefield." 
</P>
<P>
Extra police and soldiers were deployed to prevent unrest surrounding the 
anniversary. During the 1976 riots, police shot to death six Arabs who were 
protesting the seizing of Arab land in the Galilee. 
</P>
<P>
This year's anniversary also fell on the first Friday -- the Muslim prayer day 
-- of the holy month of Ramadan, so officials were particularly concerned about 
unrest. 
</P>
<P>
Young Palestinians were turned back at Israeli police and army checkpoints on 
roads leading to Jerusalem. Troops also turned people away as they tried to 
enter Jerusalem's old walled city to go to Al Aqsa.

<P>
Factory orders rebounded by 1.8% in February, boosted by increased demand for 
automobiles, defense items and communications gear, the Commerce Department 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
Overall transportation orders were up by 10.4% last month after toppling by 
29.4% in January. 
</P>
<P>
The February increase in factory orders, to $231.6 billion, follows a 5.5% 
decline in January and a modest 0.4% increase in December, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding defense items, factory orders rose 1.2% last month after a 4.3% fall 
in January, according to the department's Census Bureau. Excluding 
transportation, February orders climbed 0.6% after a 0.9% decline. 
</P>
<P>
Factory shipments climbed by 3.3% in February -- the largest gain since 5.4% 
last August -- and unfilled orders declined by 0.5% last month.

EASTERN CREDITORS MAY ASK COURT TO LIQUIDATE AIRLINE

<P>
Unsecured creditors of Eastern Airlines may try to have the airline liquidated, 
sources say. 
</P>
<P>
A source close to the creditors' committee said Thursday that there is a "50-50 
chance" the group will ask the bankruptcy court to appoint a special trustee to 
oversee a liquidation of Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
The creditors are said to be exasperated at the carrier's mounting losses and 
its new plan to reduce debt payments. 
</P>
<P>
A liquidation request would be a radical shift by the creditors. They have 
supported Eastern since it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization on 
March 9, 1989, five days after it was struck by machinists, pilots and flight 
attendants. 
</P>
<P>
The naming of a trustee who would take control of the airline from Frank 
Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp., has long been advocated 
by the airline's unions but rejected by both the company and its creditors. 
</P>
<P>
A move for liquidation also could imperil Eastern's agreement to sell its 
prized Latin American routes to American Airlines for $349 million. Proceeds 
from that sale are central to Eastern's plan to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Miami-based Eastern sharply scaled back its business prospects, 
forecasting a bigger loss for this year and a delay in this summer's planned 
emergence from bankruptcy reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern said difficulties in rebuilding its strike-battered business also meant 
it would be unable to fulfill a tentative agreement to pay unsecured creditors 
50 cents on the dollar. They are owed $980 million. 
</P>
<P>
The creditors' committee privately passed a resolution late Tuesday authorizing 
its attorneys to seek the appointment of a trustee and to propose a plan of 
liquidation, said sources.

A federal appeals court today upheld the perjury conviction of former Drexel 
Burnham Lambert Inc. trading assistant Lisa Jones but vacated her 18-month 
sentence as too harsh. 
</P>
<P>
Three judges of the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals sent the case back to the 
trial judge for resentencing. 
</P>
<P>
A federal jury in March, 1989, found Jones guilty on five counts of perjury and 
two counts of obstruction of justice for lying to a federal grand jury in 
January, 1988, in an investigation of Drexel trading. She was sentenced last 
August to 18 months in prison and fined about $50,000 by U.S. District Judge 
Leonard B. Sand. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court ruled that Sand incorrectly enhanced her offense level under 
federal sentencing guidelines, which resulted in a stiffer sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"These instances of perjury, standing alone, do not constitute the type of 
egregious conduct envisioned by the guidelines as substantial interference with 
the administration of justice," the judges said in a 24-page opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Under the offense level suggested by the appeals court, Jones faces 10 months 
to 16 months in prison.

CARVEY FOLLOWS COHORTS' MOVIE PATH BUT ISN'T SPLITTING SNL YET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dana Carvey, who makes his film debut in "Opportunity Knocks," is being 
interviewed as a movie star, not as a member of the comic ensemble of "Saturday 
Night Live." But old habits are hard to break. You ask him if he plans to leave 
the venerable late-night show in pursuit of Hollywood, and suddenly George Bush 
is answering. 
</P>
<P>
"Not gonna do it. Wouldn't be prudent." 
</P>
<P>
And how does he feel audiences will react to his character in "Opportunity 
Knocks"? The voice that answers belongs to Garth, Carvey's "nerdy surfer dude 
and loyal sidekick" in the new SNL segment, "Wayne's World." 
</P>
<P>
"Excellent! He shoots! He scores!" says Carvey/Garth. 
</P>
<P>
Between unprompted mini-skits, the impish-looking Carvey will tell you that he 
is, in fact, marveling at his success. 
</P>
<P>
The telephone at his Encino home never seems to stop ringing, with requests for 
his zany presence on such shows as "Today," where he made an appearance 
Tuesday, and "The Tonight Show," where he showed up Thursday. But, it wasn't 
always this way for the "Saturday Night Live" star. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just dismissed a lot,' Carvey said. "I looked so innocent and boyish 
that no one thought of casting me as a comedian." 
</P>
<P>
In the years since then, no wrinkles or gray hairs appear to have set in, but 
Carvey is no longer being offered the innocent, boy-next-door roles. After 
playing a colorless character in the short-lived TV series, "One of the Boys," 
with Mickey Rooney, a mime waiter in the rock movie spoof, "This is Spinal 
Tap," and being edited out of the Sean Penn movie "Racing Against the Moon," 
Carvey is ready for some recognition. 
</P>
<P>
Known best for his quirky SNL characters -- the priggish Church Lady and the 
arrogant Teutonic bodybuilder Hans, Carvey has embarked on the same crossover 
journey undertaken by a host of SNL comedians before him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's entry-level movie stardom," Carvey says. 
</P>
<P>
His starring vehicle is a fairly ambitious role. In "Opportunity Knocks," which 
opens today, Carvey plays likable con man Eddie Farrell, a two-bit hood from 
the south side of Chicago. Farrell pulls off the ultimate "con" by convincing a 
wealthy Chicago family that he really is a Harvard-educated whiz kid and wooing 
the family's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike SNL predecessors Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd, who have ventured into 
dramatic roles, Carvey wants to concentrate on what he does best: comedy. 
</P>
<P>
Carvey said he plans to stay on SNL for as long as it'll have him, or at least 
for another season, when his five-year contract runs out. 
</P>
<P>
"You look back on people that have done three, four, five seasons there, and 
they have a legacy that they can be proud of," Carvey says. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I would just love to be connected to that whole legacy. And 
hopefully next year will be my best year."

Opponents of a planned exhibition of photographs by the late Robert 
Mapplethorpe denounced a group of the pictures Thursday as encouraging child 
pornography and damaging to community standards. 
</P>
<P>
"I am firmly convinced that this exhibit has no place in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
The offensive parts of the exhibition are not art and show bad judgment by 
those who seek to exhibit them," Donald Klekamp, a Cincinnati lawyer, said 
angrily at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Klekamp and others at the news conference called on the Contemporary Arts 
Center to remove sexually graphic pictures from the exhibit, planned for April 
6 through May 25. 
</P>
<P>
Nine of the 175 photographs planned in the Arts Center's exhibition depict 
homoerotic or sadomasochistic sex acts or include nude children. The museum 
plans to post a warning sign and won't admit unaccompanied minors. 
</P>
<P>
Police and the Hamilton County sheriff have said they are considering filing 
obscenity charges if the museum displays the photographs. The museum filed a 
lawsuit this week asking for a jury to decide before the show opens whether the 
pictures are obscene.

JAPANESE PITCHER KUWATA SUSPENDED FOR MONTH FOR LEAKING INFORMATION

Pitcher Masumi Kuwata was fined $65,000 and suspended for one month today by 
the Yomiuri Giants after he lied about leaking information that could help 
gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwata, 17-9 last year for the Japan league champion Giants, lied to the team 
in its initial investigation of charges that he informed an acquaintance linked 
to gambling circles of his pitching schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The suspension covers the first month of the regular season, opening April 7, 
the Giants said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
On March 16, the Giants said they had cleared Kuwata of charges that he leaked 
confidential information. But the team said today that Kuwata later admitted 
that he had received $6,500 and a watch from his acquaintance. 
</P>
<P>
The Central League team said that these actions showed a lack of 
self-discipline and that it had decided to take strict measures. 
</P>
<P>
Yomiuri won the 1989 Japan World Series. 
</P>
<P>
A book published in February alleged that Kuwata leaked his pitching schedule 
to a person with a criminal record and received money from him. 
</P>
<P>
In Japan, pitching schedules are kept secret until the last moment. Such 
information is considered potentially valuable to gamblers.

VALVANO PAID HIM AT IONA, EX-NBA CENTER ALLEGES

Former NBA center Jeff Ruland said he took unspecified amounts of money from 
Jim Valvano while the North Carolina State coach was at Iona, the Philadelphia 
Daily News reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Valvano, who left Iona for N.C. State in 1980, denied Ruland's allegation 
through attorney Art Kaminsky, who also said an NCAA investigation found no 
wrongdoing at Iona. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim doesn't want to get into a public debate over this," Kaminsky told the 
paper. "He doesn't want this to Ping-Pong back and forth." 
</P>
<P>
Ruland, a two-time All-Star with Washington, said, "Greenbacks changed hands." 
</P>
<P>
"I took money from Valvano," the newspaper quoted Ruland as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he accepted money from Valvano while being recruited or while playing 
at Iona, Ruland said, "Both of those. That's enough. That's all I want to say." 
</P>
<P>
Ruland said the matter wasn't "about a lot of money," but he would not specify 
the amount or say how frequently it changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know anything about it," Kaminsky said. "If that's what he wants to 
say, fine." 
</P>
<P>
Ruland's NBA career ended after a knee injury limited his play to five games 
with the Philadelphia 76ers in 1986-87.

Atlanta Falcons coach Jerry Glanville confirms that the NFL club might be 
willing to exchange its No. 1 pick in the April 22-23 draft for extra 
selections. But he says it won't go to the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson said Thursday that Falcons officials had talked to 
him about trading for the No. 1 pick in the college draft. "They've asked us if 
we would be interested in moving up," Johnson said. "Nothing happened. We 
haven't responded." 
</P>
<P>
Glanville said later Thursday that he might be willing to swap draft picks, but 
not with Dallas. "I think he's wrong," Glanville said of Johnson's remarks. 
"Somewhere along the line, he got confused. . . . We may move, but not that far 
down. It's a long drop down to Dallas." The Cowboys have the 21st pick in the 
first round of the draft.

U.S., CZECHS SPLIT DAVIS CUP MATCH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Last-minute replacement Petr Korda ambushed Brad Gilbert in three quick sets 
today to give Czechoslovakia a 1-1 tie in its quarterfinal Davis Cup clash with 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In the opening match in Prague, Aaron Krickstein took advantage of wildness by 
tiring Milan Srejber of Czechoslovakia to win a five-set battle that lasted 
nearly four hours, 4-6, 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-5), 6-7 (4-7), 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Korda, a wiry left-hander who was named to play singles for Czechoslovakia when 
Davis Cup veteran Miloslav Mecir withdrew with a back pain, needed just one 
hour, 44 minutes to defeat Gilbert 6-2, 6-3, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Korda, ranked 26th in the world, kept Gilbert off balance with his hard serve 
and kept the fifth-ranked American running from side to side until he had a 
chance to hit a winning shot. 
</P>
<P>
The doubles team of Rick Leach and Jim Pugh, ranked No. 1 in the world, faces 
Czechoslovakia's Tomas Smid and Karel Novacek on Saturday. The reverse singles 
matches, with Krickstein taking on Korda and Gilbert playing Srejber, will be 
held on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The survivor of the series will advance to the semifinals in September against 
the winner of this weekend's contest between Austria and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Wally Masur beat Kelly Evernden today in straight sets at Brisbane, 
Australia, to lift Australia into tie with New Zealand in the World Group 
quarterfinal at Milton Tennis Center. Masur triumphed 6-3, 7-6 (7-0), 6-1, 
dominating Evernden with a powerful serve-and-volley game. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Kratzmann and Darren Cahill of Australia will play Evernden and David 
Lewis in the doubles on Saturday, with the reverse singles slated for Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
India won both of today's singles matches against Japan at Chandigarh, India, 
to take a 2-0 lead in the opening round of the Asia-Oceania zone contest. 
</P>
<P>
In the first match, Indian national champion Zeeshan Ali defeated Hidehiko 
Tanizawa in straight sets 6-4, 6-2, 6-3. Srinivasan Vasudevan won the second 
match for India, beating Shuzo Matsuoka 6-4, 6-1, 7-6 (8-6). 
</P>
<P>
And in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Hong Kong took a 2-0 lead over Malaysia in 
today's second round Asia-Oceania match. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Bailey defeated V. Selvam 0-6, 6-2, 6-4, 2-6, 8-6 and Colin Grant defeated 
U. Muralidharan 6-3, 6-2, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
The two countries play the doubles match on Saturday and the reverse singles on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Playing in Shanghai, China defeated the Philippines in both opening singles 
matches in today's first-round of the Asia-Oceania group. 
</P>
<P>
Xia Jiaping outlasted Roland So in a four-hour, 40-minute match 4-6, 5-7, 6-4, 
6-3, 6-2, and Pan Bing defeated last-minute replacement Danilo Pila 6-0, 6-0, 
6-0. Pila replaced Felix Barrientos, who withdrew because of illness.

FASHION: GORDON HENDERSON IS THE HOT NEW FACE IN NEW YORK. HE DESIGNS REAL 
CLOTHES -- BUT WITH SOMETHING EXTRA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE BOGART, Bogart, a native Californian based in Paris, is a frequent 
contributor to The Times fashion pages. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PARIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gordon Henderson may be staying in a $550-a-night room at the palatial Hotel 
Crillon in the heart of Paris, sipping champagne at night and taking breakfast 
in bed from a silver coffee service. But this native of Merced, Calif., sitting 
cross-legged in the middle of a mountain of papers, sketches, and fabric 
samples, can still grin broadly in the kooky wonderment of it all. 
</P>
<P>
"You should have seen me in my macrame vests, my platform shoes, and my 
poor-boy turtlenecks," the fashion designer says gleefully. "I remember when I 
made my own patchwork jeans and patchwork vest and wore them to school. I was 
too cool. You couldn't touch me." 
</P>
<P>
Who would have imagined that when his high school class voted Henderson 
"Best-Dressed," he was in fact most likely to succeed? At that point, certainly 
not Henderson himself. The New York fashion scene was "in another 
stratosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Now 33, Henderson is in Paris shopping for fabrics for an upcoming collection. 
But he spends most of the year in New York, where he is the current 
toast-of-the-town designer, riding high on a wave of acclaim after winning the 
Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) Award for best new talent, and 
being featured not just in the fashion press but as a phenomenon worthy of Time 
and People magazines. 
</P>
<P>
After only a year in business, his women's separates are available in stores 
throughout the United States, including Modasport and I. Magnin in Los Angeles. 
He expects sales to reach about $6 million in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson's sense of style is closer to Los Angeles than New York. He shows 
long, full skirts, camp shirts in unusual colors, short shorts and minis, in 
the soft shapes and casual combinations inspired by life at the beach, on 
patios and in cars. His fall line debuts for buyers and the press Tuesday in 
New York, and stays true to the simple, all-American clothes -- in surprising 
colors -- that have become his signature. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the simplicity of his lines, Henderson, with a touch of embroidery 
here, an oversized pullover there -- and a splash of soft, fresh color -- seems 
to have that magical extra ingredient that makes even the most blase fashion 
followers perk up. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson's introduction to fashion was unique. He is probably the only name 
designer today who can claim he discovered the exciting, international world of 
style while sipping a Slurpee at a 7-Eleven. 
</P>
<P>
"I discovered GQ magazine when I was 16," he says, reminiscing fondly. "I 
thought I found something nobody else knew about and I kept it a secret. Before 
then, in the small-town atmosphere I grew up in, I didn't think it was right 
that a man could be interested in fashionable clothes, but GQ validated my 
interests and showed me another world existed out there." 
</P>
<P>
As a high school dandy, he says he wouldn't have been caught dead in a pair of 
blue jeans, but these days, Henderson's uniform is basic blue denim -- jeans, 
shirt and jacket punctuated discreetly by a pair of expensive leather Oxford 
shoes and a vintage camel overcoat. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the idea of the uniform, the idea of something monochromatic, and in 
the same fabric," Henderson says. "Uniforms allow you to relax and not worry 
about what to wear in the morning. But it has to be a uniform you create on 
your own -- not somebody else's." 
</P>
<P>
Although he traveled to Paris to check out the Premiere Vision European textile 
fair for new fabrics, he has also been sent away from Seventh Avenue's concrete 
jungle by his financier, World Hong Kong, an international manufacturing 
company, to soak up some ambience and inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
"When I come to Paris, I look for the freedom people have in dressing," he 
says. "American women have been trained to find 'a look' to attach themselves 
to. I want to break down these kinds of walls. 
</P>
<P>
"I figure, you've got your favorite things that you wear every day, like your 
favorite watch and your favorite pair of earrings," Henderson continues. "You 
should be able to fuse a piece from my collection into the wardrobe you already 
own. That whole designer head-to-toe thing is over. Women aren't going to go 
for that anymore." 
</P>
<P>
This season, he launches a new spin-off line called "But Gordon," (the preface 
he hears most often in his showroom, as in "But Gordon we needed that 
yesterday") which is priced at around 50% less than his regular collection. 
Shirts start at $40, trousers at $50. 
</P>
<P>
"My success comes from the bottom up. I feel like I'm communicating with the 
woman on the street, the working woman. I want to get them excited about 'real' 
clothes again -- the kind they can afford," he says. "My challenge is to create 
a staple in the wardrobe." 
</P>
<P>
Several overnight sensations of the '80s, among them designers Stephen Sprouse 
and David Cameron, famous for their trend-of-the-moment flair, soon fizzled out 
like bad firecrackers and have since filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, the first New York star of the '90s, hopes to avoid this fate. 
</P>
<P>
"Success is a scary thing," he says. "You can't let yourself be overwhelmed. I 
depend on my ability to keep in touch with myself." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the occasional shoe splurge, he is, he insists, a practical soul. And 
one who has always known what he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
It started when Henderson was a mere 8 years old, with a blue-green V-neck 
pullover he discovered while shopping for school. His mother said it was too 
expensive, so he staged a two-month boycott of all the other new school clothes 
she bought. She finally gave in, returned all the unworn clothes, and bought 
the one perfect sweater. 
</P>
<P>
"My most recent love affair was a three-quarter length, zip-front leather 
jacket from the '40s. The minute I saw it, I knew it was my jacket. It was, 
like, excitement. It's a feeling of finding a gem -- walking along and finding 
a diamond in the earth. Somehow, a glint of light catches your eye, and there 
it is." To Henderson's horror, the jacket was lost when it was sent to be 
copied by one of his production factories. 
</P>
<P>
But this drove him to create a new series of leather coats to debut this season 
on the runway. 
</P>
<P>
It's the same old love story: Boy meets jacket. Boy loses jacket. Boy designs 
an even better one. Then he sells it. In the fashion world, that's a happy 
ending.

SAN QUENTIN WARDEN VIEWS GRIM DUTY WITH EQUANIMITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN QUENTIN, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like many lifers who pass through one of California's most notorious prisons, 
Dan Vasquez grew up tough in a poor Southern California neighborhood, joined a 
gang and dropped out of high school. 
</P>
<P>
But the stocky, rough-talking Vasquez is not behind the bars of San Quentin. He 
is in charge. And as the prison's warden, he is preparing to direct the 
scheduled execution Tuesday of Robert Alton Harris, which would be the first in 
California since 1967. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a ghoulish person. I'm not relishing that upcoming, potentially 
upcoming, execution," Vasquez said. "But I know what my job is. I know I have 
to carry out the responsibilities of my job." 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez's views on crime and justice were honed in the Redlands barrio where he 
grew up, as well as in the state correctional system, where he started his 
career a quarter-century ago as a guard at the prison in Chino. 
</P>
<P>
A likeness of San Quentin is forged on his belt buckle. On the back of his hand 
are his initials, tattooed in the ragged style of the streets. He keeps it as 
"a reminder of the old days." 
</P>
<P>
"Some people make decisions in life that they can never, never change again," 
said Vasquez, 46. "Fortunately, I hadn't made that type." 
</P>
<P>
When he discusses the death penalty, his words are not the slick slogans of a 
politician, or the fine and silvery arguments of an attorney. He is at the 
"business end" of the ultimate sanction a state can impose. 
</P>
<P>
Under the procedure he revised when he arrived as warden in 1984, Vasquez must 
order that his officers place the prisoner in the gas chamber. Then he will 
signal one of them to lower the lever immersing cyanide pellets in acid, thus 
forming deadly gas. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any personal or moral conflict over it. I don't. I'm fortunate," 
he said. Then, as if anticipating that some death penalty abolitionist might 
call his attitude shallow or callous, he said, "I think I'm just as much a deep 
thinker as the next person." 
</P>
<P>
Each day, Vasquez drives past protesters who have been keeping a vigil outside 
San Quentin since Harris' execution date was set two months ago. The warden 
wonders about their priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the murders for which Harris was sentenced to death, Vasquez said, 
"How quickly they forgot the crime that was committed against two young people, 
two 16-year-old kids." 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez knows that if he didn't have a bit of luck, concerned parents and 
occasional help from a teacher or probation officer, he might have ended up a 
San Quentin inmate. As a teen-age gang member, he "was getting into a lot of 
trouble," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Army was his way out. In the service, he received a high school diploma. 
The Army trained him to become a police officer. Upon his discharge in the 
mid-1960s, he tried to join police departments in Southern California. But at 
just under 5-foot-8, he failed to meet the restrictive minimum height 
requirements then in place for the departments. He was, however, accepted as a 
correctional officer at Chino. 
</P>
<P>
As he worked his way up, he went to college, became a parole officer, and 
returned to the prisons as an agent investigating prison gangs. In the late 
1970s, he became an administrator, rising to deputy superintendent at Soledad 
state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Then the call came to run San Quentin. In corrections, the job of warden at San 
Quentin "is prestigious," said James Park, San Quentin associate warden from 
1964 to 1972 and now a consultant to the joint legislative committee on prison 
construction. "It is still the prison in California." 
</P>
<P>
The prison Vasquez took over was in sad shape. Stabbings were common. With 
1,750 prisoners in maximum custody, San Quentin had more high-security inmates 
than any prison in the country. State and federal judges had deemed conditions 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, under court oversight that continues, the state spent $35 million 
to renovate the prison and moved high-security prisoners to newer institutions. 
Still, violence flares. Even as Vasquez spoke to The Times recently, officers 
were investigating a homicide. 
</P>

Vasquez has not gotten to know the man most likely to die next in the gas 
chamber. He has no desire to do so. He did, however, take it upon himself to 
tell Harris when the inmate's execution date was set in February. He tried to 
get Harris to think about final details, such as how his belongings should be 
disposed of, and what should be done with his body.

"He was understandably shaken," Vasquez said. "The warden was there with a 
death warrant."

Vasquez has thought hard about the mechanics of a state killing. He has tested 
the gas chamber and has visited Southern states to see how they carry out 
executions. 
</P>
<P>
But he does not see himself as an executioner. "If you want to talk about an 
executioner," he said, "you better make arrangements to talk to Robert Alton 
Harris because he is a self-appointed executioner. I am not and none of my 
staff is."
