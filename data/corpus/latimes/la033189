Iraq, whose first attempt at acquiring nuclear capability was destroyed by 
Israeli warplanes in 1981, is secretly engaged in a crash program to build 
nuclear warheads for use with a strategic missile also under development, 
according to Israeli sources quoted by the Washington Post. The goal of the 
secret program is to produce and test such a warhead with the next two years, 
the sources told the Post. The Iraqi program, which was launched after the 
Israeli air force bombed the Osirak nuclear reactor eight years ago, is using 
the 25 pounds of enriched uranium left over from the reactor, they said.

Rockets fired by Syrian troops in their battle with Lebanese Christian army 
units hit Beirut's main fuel depot, causing fires and explosions that forced 
50,000 residents to flee. Hospital officials said 53 people were injured. A 
police spokesman said Syrian gunners fired at least six Katyusha rockets into 
Christian East Beirut, killing two people. The casualties brought the toll to 
125 killed and more than 400 wounded in the artillery duel that began March 8 
between the 20,000 Christian troops commanded by Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun and an 
alliance of Syrian forces and Walid Jumblatt's Druze militia. Most of the 
casualties have been civilians.

A San Francisco Superior Court jury recommended that Robert Massie be put to 
death for the 1979 murder of a liquor store clerk. The case attracted attention 
because Massie was sentenced to death once before for a 1965 murder in the Los 
Angeles area. His first death sentence was commuted in 1972 when the state 
Supreme Court deemed capital punishment unconstitutional. He was on parole when 
he murdered again in 1979. The high court reversed his conviction for that 
crime and ordered the retrial that resulted in his latest death sentence. His 
lawyer said he will ask that Judge Edward Stern sentence Massie to life without 
parole.

A Minneapolis judge refused to move the wife of spy Jonathan Pollard from a 
federal prison hospital where she says she is isolated and mistreated. U.S. 
District Judge Harry MacLaughlin ordered that Anne Henderson Pollard, 28, 
remain at the Federal Medical Center in Rochester, Minn., and he denied an 
independent medical review. Anne Pollard had sued to be moved back to a federal 
prison in Danbury, Conn. She said the hospital, where she was sent for a 
gastrointestinal disorder and other conditions, was making her worse because 
she is the only woman there, the staff hates her and she was put under 24-hour 
surveillance. Jonathan Pollard, 34, was sentenced in 1987 to a life term for 
supplying classified documents to Israeli agents. Anne Pollard was given a 
five-year term on charges including being an accessory after the fact.

Canada held its first meeting with a PLO representative but said it is stopping 
short of recognizing the new state of Palestine declared in Algiers last 
November. Yves Portier, the Canadian delegate to the United Nations, met Nasser 
Kidwa, the alternate representative of the Palestine Liberation Organization's 
observer group to the world body, at Canada's U.N. Mission in New York. 
Previous meetings were confined to officials below the rank of ambassador. 
External Affairs Minister Joe Clark said Canada is removing restrictions on 
contracts with the PLO because of its new "moderate" course.

The Navy believes a Trident 2 missile that failed during a launch attempt last 
week suffered a mechanical failure in the first-stage nozzle mechanism, the 
Pentagon said. Dan Howard, the Defense Department's chief spokesman, said the 
Navy had managed to recover some parts of the missile from the ocean floor off 
Cape Canaveral, Fla., and to analyze more of the radio telemetry data from the 
launch. "They have determined from the telemetry at this point that the 
difficulty was not with the guidance system or any of the electrical systems," 
Howard said. "The most likely suspect is a mechanical failure in the nozzle 
mechanism."

Bus drivers in two Polish cities went on strike for higher wages despite 
repeated calls by Solidarity founder Lech Walesa to refrain from labor protests 
during talks on reform with the Polish government. Adam Michnik, a Solidarity 
adviser, said the talks ran into an impasse after a meeting of the working 
group set up to discuss political reforms. Michnik said the group could not 
reach a consensus dealing with the office of president. The official news 
agency PAP said an unspecified number of bus drivers began sit-in protests in 
Siedlce and Minsk Mazowiecki, east of Warsaw, paralyzing transportation in the 
area.

NEWSMAKERS: FIPPLE FLAUTISTS PRACTICE PUCKERS FOR A 'NIGHT WATCH' 
</P>

Listen very carefully Saturday, and you just might hear the strains of an old 
English dance tune, "The Night Watch," floating through the air. Recorder 
players from Australia to Alhambra are being asked to synchronize their 
watches, and at precisely 2 p.m. PST thousands of them are expected to play the 
centuries-old song on their ancient flute-like instruments to celebrate the 
50th anniversary of the American Recorder Society. "The old saying that there's 
strength in numbers will be felt," said Tim King, director of the seven-member 
Albany Recorder Ensemble in Albany, Ga. "This will give us an opportunity to 
share with people all over the world in a common event." Andy Green, the 
society's administrative director, said recorders are popular because they 
don't take a lot of skill to produce pleasing music. To ensure the greatest 
participation, the society, which has about 4,200 members worldwide, mailed 
copies of the song as well as starting times in various time zones -- late 
evening in Europe, Sunday morning in the Far East -- and urged the fipple 
flautists to "be sure to synchronize your watch to the second with the radio or 
the time telephone number." It also gave a suggested metronome tempo.

 -- When Parsippany, N.J., Mayor Frank Priore learned that one of the town's 
employees was a traffic scofflaw, he suspended him for one day without pay and 
ordered the police chief to issue a $20 ticket. The fact that the errant 
employee was himself didn't faze him one bit. "I think that was the fairest 
thing I could do with myself," he said. Priore didn't realize he had been 
driving with an expired license since 1987 until he was contacted by a 
reporter. But as head of the city's police department, he said he had to set an 
example. He based his punishment on what a police officer would face in the 
same situation. He said the notice to renew probably was sent to his former 
address.

 -- A former Indian beauty queen at the center of a British sex and politics 
scandal has been in hiding on the island of Bali, Indonesian immigration 
officials said. Pamella Bordes, 27, went into seclusion after the British 
tabloid press linked her to an unnamed Cabinet minister, two British newspaper 
editors and a Libyan security official. The suggestion of a connection with 
Libya, with which Britain has no diplomatic ties, sparked an outcry about 
possible security breaches at the House of Commons, where Bordes worked for a 
Conservative member of Parliament. DEBORAH CHRISTENSEN

3 TODDLERS ALMOST DROWN

Three toddlers were in critical condition after nearly drowning when they fell 
into a pool at a North Tustin home where they were under the care of a baby 
sitter. The children were identified as Jonathon Derek Weston, 22 months; 
Melissa Dianne Polsfoot, 19 months, and Arthur Matthew Griese, 14 months. 
Doctors said they would know within 72 hours whether any had suffered permanent 
brain damage. Authorities immediately launched an investigation into the 
baby-sitting arrangement at the home of Orvel Brooks. County social worker 
Karen Rater joined sheriff's deputies in the investigation but said it had not 
been determined if Brooks or a member of his family had, or needed, a license 
to care for the children. One unidentified mother left the house distraught, 
asking herself: "How did he get in the pool? There was a six-foot fence!" 
Deputies released no information on how the toddlers fell into the pool, or how 
long they were in the water before Brooks found them.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: HIGH COURT CLOSES BOOK ON COLORFUL LEGAL CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Supreme Court has quietly ended one of San Diego County's more 
clamorous legal careers. 
</P>
<P>
The court this month upheld the disbarment of Frank George Prantil, a 
well-known attorney and aspiring politician before being convicted of perjury 
and forgery charges and spending 14 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
"At one time, he was considered one of the county's top defense attorneys," 
said attorney Eugene Iredale, who once represented Prantil. "Somehow his life 
just fell apart on him." 
</P>
<P>
Now living outside Sacramento, the 51-year-old Prantil said he was "devastated" 
by the court's rejection of his plea that he was unfairly convicted. And he 
repeated his oft-made accusation that he was victimized because of his maverick 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a victim of the war on drugs," Prantil said. "The prosecutors and the 
courts can't stand it when someone insists that all defendants have rights." 
</P>
<P>
In nearly two decades as a practicing attorney, the San Diego native was never 
far from the headlines. He won several high-publicity felony cases and 
big-money damage suits. He defended a San Diego councilman indicted in the 
Yellow Cab scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters loved his flamboyant rhetoric (he favored Shakespeare and the 
classics) and brash attire (he wore an American flag tie to court). His 
practice boomed. He moved from East County to a comfortable spread in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
But there were also political defeats, angry public disputes, money problems 
and his final slide into Vacaville state prison. He concedes now that alcohol 
and marijuana played a role in his difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
He lost races for Congress (1968), district attorney (1970) and El Cajon 
Municipal Court (1978). The County Bar Assn. branded him as unqualified. The 
State Bar in 1979 suspended him for six months for misusing a client's money. 
</P>
<P>
He was convicted in 1983 of forgery and perjury in a case involving a bogus 
$53,000 check and, in 1986, of being an accessory to a cocaine conspiracy. 
Released from prison in 1987, Prantil says he will never return to San Diego 
County: "They rode me out on a rail." 
</P>
<P>
He says that Deputy Dist. Atty. Bob Sullivan had a vendetta against him. 
Sullivan says that's bunk and notes that two juries convicted Prantil on a 
number of counts. 
</P>
<P>
From his self-imposed exile, Prantil tries not to dwell on how far he has 
fallen. "I used to believe in ultimate justice," he said. "I don't anymore." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Winning T-Shirt 
</P>
<P>
The decision by a New York judge to hijack the America's Cup to New Zealand 
because Dennis Conner sailed a catamaran could deprive San Diego businesses of 
an expected $1.2 billion bonanza from a 1991 defense in local waters. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't mean there isn't a way to make a buck off the cup. 
</P>
<P>
T-shirts protesting the judge's decision will go on sale today in 14 San Diego 
County outlets of Pacific Eyes and T's, the Sorrento Valley-based T-shirt and 
sunglasses chain. 
</P>
<P>
The new shirts show a Conner-like catamaran with a large screw through it, and 
a kiwi bird laughing at the sight. Price: $10. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Eyes and T's has long backed Conner against pirate-banker Michael Fay. 
During the September races it sold shirts saying "No Way Fay", and "Throw 
Another Kiwi on the Barbie." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Well-Done Roast 
</P>
<P>
In Pete Wilson's latter years as mayor of San Diego, it was said he had two 
goals: to learn to sing and to become governor. 
</P>
<P>
He took lessons and can manfully handle a tune. The second goal eluded him, and 
he settled for the U. S. Senate. Now, he's trying to rectify that with his 
third try at the governorship, with his likely Democratic foe being Atty. Gen. 
John Van de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night the Republican Wilson was among those roasting Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) at a benefit dinner in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
He joked that he wasn't surprised to find picketers carrying signs urging him 
to stay in the Senate. What did surprise him, he said, was that one of the 
signs was carried by Van de Kamp.

CHILD ABUSE BATTERS INVESTIGATORS AS WELL AS VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The faces of child abuse victims, often bruised and bloodied, leave a lasting 
impression. These are children, after all, virtually helpless against adults -- 
most often their own parents or guardians -- who for whatever reason commit 
violence against them. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, two local cases have brought new attention to the problem of child 
abuse. In January, San Diego police arrested Henri Mathis Dyson and her son, 
Harold Alexander Dyson, after reports that children were being abused at their 
foster home in Mira Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Police learned of the case when an infant under the care of the Dysons -- who 
have pleaded innocent -- was taken, near death, to a local hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Just this week, photographs of twin boys, age 2 -- the county's latest known 
victims -- were shown on television in an effort to apprehend whoever abandoned 
them in a Del Mar hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Stables, a San Diego County sheriff's deputy, said the boys suffered "deep 
bruises from hand imprints on their faces like they were shoved, cuts on their 
necks and cigarette burns on their stomachs and sides." She said both boys had 
been sexually abused. 
</P>
<P>
If such stories and pictures are horrifying to the average person, to parents 
who can't fathom such crimes happening to any child, much less their own, what 
about the people who investigate and treat abuse cases? How do they deal with 
the rage and grief that such cases breed? 
</P>
<P>
"I go home each night and say, 'Wow, this case tops all the others,' " said 
Versie Auzenne, 34, a registered nurse who has worked five years in the Center 
for Child Protection at Children's Hospital. "But there's always another one to 
top that one. They seem to get worse instead of better. . . . And they just 
keep coming." 
</P>
<P>
"The most difficult cases you deal with are the deaths," said Dan Dennis, who 
investigates child abuse cases as a detective for the San Diego Police 
Department. "There's a lot of stress, a lot of hidden stress that creeps up on 
you later, in dreams and so forth. Your mind's set on the investigation, going 
50 directions at once, making sure everything's right. 
</P>
<P>
"You get away from it for a while, all of a sudden you think you're relaxing, 
and then you just feel . . . real tired. Brain drain has set in. It's hard to 
get up and do it again." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Carlson, who works with Dennis in the same unit, said most police officers 
working the child abuse beat can do it for two years -- no more. 
</P>
<P>
"It's two to three years max," he said. "Me, I've been in it for a little over 
a year, and I'll work in it another year or so, but no more. After a while, 
you're like a sponge. You're saturated. With each new case, 
</P>
<P>
you say to yourself, 'OK, I've had enough. I don't care to see another hurt 
kid.' But somehow you summon the motivation to do one more." 
</P>
<P>
Carlson said most of the children he sees are 3 to 8 years old and that burn 
victims upset him the most. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst are the ones where a child has been submerged in hot water as 
punishment," he said. "It's hard to believe anyone would do that to a child. 
Most of the people who work in this (14-detective) unit are parents. These 
cases always stimulate your emotions." 
</P>
<P>
Carlson said the job is so tough that at times investigators walk out of 
interviews between social workers and victims when the talk gets too rough. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Giving 'Yourself a Breather' 
</P>
<P>
"A detective sitting in on the interview will just lay down his pen and walk 
out," Carlson said. "He'll say, 'I'm sorry, I can't take it anymore.' And 
that's good. You just have to give yourself a breather sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
Carlson and Dennis recently spent 2 1/2 months investigating allegations of 
abuse at the Dysons' Mira Mesa care home for foster children. Police believe 
that as many as 5 dozen children may have been tortured at the home since the 
granting of its license six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Victims, from 17 months to 12 years old, told police they feared for their 
lives when they were tied to a kitchen post and beaten. They claimed to have 
been made to sleep on a cold garage floor and inside a bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis said he's improved as a listener, especially when a kid is the talker. 
Nowadays, he said, it's important not only to gauge the needs of a child but 
also to ferret out the truth about abuse. He said some of the accused are 
innocent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'You Really Have to Listen' 
</P>
<P>
"You really have to listen to what these kids are saying," he said. "We had a 
case the other day where a boy came to school with a black eye. He told the 
nurse his father got mad at him and slugged him. Well, we found out that wasn't 
the truth at all. His older brother threw a toy at him. The dad was a good dad, 
no wrongdoing." 
</P>
<P>
Often, though, abuse is present and the consequences are grim. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. David Chadwick has seen plenty of wrongdoing. "I saw a kid last night," he 
said, "who will almost certainly die -- from deliberate asphyxiation." 
</P>
<P>
Chadwick is chief medical administrator at the Center for Child Protection at 
Children's Hospital, a pediatric specialist who has dealt with abuse cases for 
25 years. He said the difficulty of his job comes not just in the "pain" and 
"outrage" inherent with the territory but with frustrations over the justice 
system, the very machinery aimed at stopping the abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the social workers out on the front lines investigating these cases 
are music majors, rookies -- a lot of 'em say, 'Well, it was my first case.' 
There shouldn't be a 'first case' for work of this nature," Chadwick said. "We 
see abused kids coming back here a second and third time. That shouldn't be. 
The amazing thing is, the Department of Social Services in San Diego County is 
better than 90% of the agencies in the country, and it's not very good. This is 
the stuff that drives me crazy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aware of Burnout Rate 
</P>
<P>
Chadwick is aware of the burnout rate among law-enforcement officers and said 
that isn't the case at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"Law enforcement doesn't place a high priority on child abuse work as a career 
objective," he said. "Burglary and homicide are the high-prestige beats, and 
that frustrates me too. The San Diego police was one of the first departments 
in the country to create a special unit. The sheriff (John Duffy) had a good 
unit, but he dissolved it last January. We're pretty mad at him about that, 
needless to say. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody suffers in this system," Chadwick said. "If the head of the 
Department of Social Services went to the County Board of Supervisors and said, 
'I need 50% more funding; I need to stabilize the office,' do you know what 
would happen? Next year, he wouldn't be the head of the department." 
</P>
<P>
Nurse Versie and Chadwick said the emotional frustrations of child abuse cases 
are, at times, monumental. So, they let themselves cry if they have to. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not cool for a cop to cry," Chadwick said, "and that's too bad." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deciding What to Do 
</P>
<P>
Irene Becker is a social worker who supervises the child abuse hot line 
(560-2191) for Child Protective Services, a division of the county Department 
of Social Services. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, one of the toughest things is deciding at the moment of the call what 
I should do," she said. "Do I send a social worker out right away? Do I wait a 
while, a few days? Do I send them out at all? Depending on what I do, a little 
life may hang in the balance. The iffy cases, the gray cases are the toughest 
for me. The clear-cut cases are by far the easiest." 
</P>
<P>
Becker said media coverage has intensified public awareness of the issue. It 
has also magnified her caseload and made life harder. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest part of our job is dealing with the numbers -- the overwhelming 
number of people calling in," she said. "The most discouraging aspect is the 
incredible rise in referrals over the nine years I've been here. There doesn't 
seem to be any end in sight." 
</P>
<P>
Becker's 25-person staff fielded 57,665 "referrals" -- calls into the hot line 
-- in 1987. The number soared to 67,223 last year and will undoubtedly rise 
this year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We average about 5,500 calls a month," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The calls come from schools, hospitals, doctors, nurses, dentists, 
optometrists, day-care providers, relatives, neighbors -- anyone concerned 
about a specific case to the point of reporting it, even if they can't be sure 
of criminal wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concerned About Numbers 
</P>
<P>
Chadwick is also concerned about numbers. His center averages an outpatient 
load of about 1,500 children a year. In 1986, he saw 100 kids on an inpatient 
basis. Last year, the number tripled. He said about 20 kids a year die at the 
hospital from injuries linked to child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Chadwick is also frustrated by lawyers, by the nation's adversarial system of 
justice. At 62, he said he's tired of being an expert witness twice a month for 
prosecutors hoping to convict someone of child abuse. He's frustrated that they 
don't succeed more often. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is also frustrated -- and saddened -- by changes in society. He said 
the "loss of the extended family in American life" has probably contributed to 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe your mother-in-law drives you crazy," he said. "But, if a mother-in-law 
is there, in the house, chances are you're not going to beat the kid. The more 
we have people in private, isolated situations, the more likely we'll have 
abuse. I don't see it going away anytime soon."

You may recall how paramedics expressed wonderment over the devotion of John 
Baxter's pet duck. 
</P>
<P>
Baxter, a 49-year-old transient, was run down by a hit-and-run driver in Sylmar 
as he crossed the street three weeks ago. And Angel, the duck, wouldn't let 
anyone else near without a fight. 
</P>
<P>
"The paramedics told us that the duck kept jumping on Baxter's chest as they 
tried to treat him, and they had to keep shooing it away," recalled Los Angeles 
Police Officer Pat Ramsey. 
</P>
<P>
Baxter suffered two broken arms and two broken legs, but when he reached the 
hospital, he seemed more worried about the welfare of Angel, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Jeri Bowser, a Sylmar nurse who saw the accident, agreed to take 
Angel into her household. She said Thursday that the quacker is getting along 
very well with the rest of her menagerie, which includes two geese, a duck, a 
parrot, two cats and two dogs. 
</P>
<P>
"Lately, she (Angel) has been laying an egg every day," Bowser added. 
</P>
<P>
Baxter, now in a convalescent home, won't be back on his feet for several 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
But the tedium and pain of recovery will be broken a bit today when he and 
Angel meet for the first time since the accident. The rest home has given 
Bowser permission to drop by with the quacker. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a very nice lady," Baxter said. "I'm very thankful." 
</P>
<P>
A helicopter, with a roaming spotlight, hovered over a San Fernando Valley 
tennis club the other night. A linesman in the sky? 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it was a Los Angeles Police chopper, responding to a report that one 
of the members had become embroiled in a brouhaha with some teen-agers 
loitering in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Squad cars arrived, a report was made and one piece of evidence -- a tennis 
racket -- was taken. 
</P>
<P>
Ailing Dodger slugger Kirk Gibson may or may not be in the lineup when baseball 
season opens next week. But his manager's South Pasadena restaurant, Tommy 
Lasorda's Ribs and Pasta, will definitely be out of action. 
</P>
<P>
The eatery has been shut down for several weeks, with a "Closed for Remodeling" 
sign outside. One worker said the restaurant could come off the disabled list 
in six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lasorda is suing a pest control company for $500,000 for alleged 
shoddy work that he says was responsible for the closure of the restaurant in 
October for sanitation violations. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of "junk bond" salesmen . . . 
</P>
<P>
Believe it or not, the Greed Club of America has no branch in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Founders Bob Bates and Frank Corwin say that a charter is available -- for a 
fee, of course ($20). For a one-year membership, which they claim includes a 
newsletter "once or twice a year," they'll gouge you for $10. 
</P>
<P>
The Akron, Ohio, entrepreneurs describe the Greed Club as "a prestigious 
organization that symbolizes the American dream." It was inspired by the movie, 
"Wall Street," in which avaricious arbitrageur Gordon Gekko utters the immortal 
line, "Greed is good." 
</P>
<P>
A real-life sequel of a Mel Gibson movie here? Los Angeles City Councilman Joel 
Wachs fears it might be plausible. 
</P>
<P>
In making a motion for the city to purchase 300 more hand-held radar units for 
traffic enforcement officers, Wachs said, "Many of our neighborhoods are 
beginning to look like scenes from a 'Road Warrior' movie." 
</P>
<P>
Privy to the Oscars . . . 
</P>
<P>
In one respect, the press agreed that the Academy Awards show was a great 
improvement over last year's edition, when the sanitation facilities were of 
the portable, construction-site variety, situated in the parking lot of the 
Shrine Auditorium . 
</P>
<P>
Inasmuch as reporters are required to don formal wear for the ceremonies, the 
arrangement yielded such strange spectacles as newswomen in formal gowns 
daintily climbing into outhouses. (Needless to say, members of the press aren't 
allowed anywhere near the stars' facilities.) 
</P>
<P>
This year, the scribes were supplied with trailers, giving their encampment 
more of the look (and feel) of a Hollywood movie location.

 ALL OF BEETHOVEN'S SONATAS IN 10 HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ludwig van Beethoven wrote his 32 piano sonatas over a span of 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Haag plans to play them all in 10 hours from memory Saturday at El 
Camino College in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
"The world won't collapse over my doing this, but it will be fun," said Haag, a 
concert pianist and dean at the college who has been playing the sonatas for 25 
years -- but never before at one sitting. 
</P>
<P>
While piano marathons are not new -- the world's record of 1,218 hours was set 
in Australia in 1982 -- Haag believes his keyboard marathon will be a first for 
the Beethoven piano works. 
</P>
<P>
"They were done three or four years ago in New York, but in two segments," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The musical stunt has a practical purpose. Not only will Haag season the 
college's new, nine-foot Steinway concert grand, but he hopes to recoup the 
$40,000 price from people who pledge money to hear the music.

 ROSE BOWL MAY GET COSMETIC TOUCH-UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Working on the premise that the Rose Bowl is an aging beauty that needs 
cosmetic work, Pasadena city officials are considering more than $11 million in 
improvements for the 66-year-old stadium, including a new electronic scoreboard 
and luxury sky boxes. 
</P>
<P>
"If we want to see the stadium continue on the path of being a classical yet 
serviceable modern facility to attract quality events, we think we're going to 
have to spend some money on it," said Deputy City Manager Ed Aghayan. 
</P>
<P>
Among the proposals suggested by city staff are a $1 million parking lot 
resurfacing job, a $350,000 press box elevator, $2 million in seismic 
improvements to the Rose Bowl's north end, a $1-million matrix scoreboard and 
more than $5 million in luxury suites. Private funding would be expected to pay 
for some of the improvements, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
There was some opposition to the plan by Bowl Director Rick Cole, who said he 
feared that continued city capital outlays could increase pressure for more 
commercial uses of the Rose Bowl, because profits have been so small.

TWO SAILORS DISCIPLINED FOR BOMB 'JOKE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Navy petty officers have been disciplined for a "practical joke" last week 
that had police searching a car belonging to one of them. 
</P>
<P>
The incident came in the wake of the destruction of the van belonging to the 
wife of Navy Capt. Will Rogers III by a pipe bomb. Navy officials Thursday were 
quick to say that there was no connection between the two incidents. 
</P>
<P>
"This had nothing to do -- and I repeat nothing to do -- with the the USS 
Vincennes," said Navy spokesman Lt. Ken Luchka. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers was the skipper of the guided missile cruiser Vincennes when it shot 
down an Iranian airliner over the Persian Gulf last summer. On March 10, his 
wife's van exploded in what federal officials theorize was an act of 
retribution by terrorists. Sharon Rogers escaped unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
The practical joke occurred March 24 when a call was placed to the office of 
Petty Officer 1st Class Joseph Meyers of the Fleet Combat Training Center on 
Point Loma. 
</P>
<P>
Meyers was not in the office at the time. But, Luchka said the "unidentified 
source stated, 'Tell him there's a bomb in his car.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Call to Police 
</P>
<P>
When Meyers returned to his office, he immediately tried to call Petty Officer 
1st Class Donald Harris to ask if he had left that message, since the two 
played practical jokes on each other all the time, Luchka said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Harris was conducting a course and could not be reached by phone, so 
Meyers telephoned his wife, who had driven the car to her job at an auto 
dealership in La Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"Meyers, still being concerned, contacted La Mesa police to check the car out 
for a bomb," Luchka said. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Conrad Grayson of the San Diego County sheriff's bomb squad said he 
inspected the vehicle at the dealership in the 8900 block of La Mesa Boulevard 
but found no explosives or bomb parts attached to or inside the car. 
</P>
<P>
He also said there was no connection between the incident at the dealership and 
an explosion the next night at the crowded Aquarius Roll-A-Rena roller-skating 
rink in La Mesa. No one was hurt in that blast and no suspects have been 
arrested. The blast hurled pieces of wood up to 100 feet, and some landed 
across La Mesa Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Luchka said Naval Investigative Service officials later contacted Harris, who 
admitted placing the call about the bomb. He said both Harris and Meyers were 
disciplined by their commanding officer and counseled against playing practical 
jokes on each other. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a very unfortunate incident, particularly in light of the bombing of 
Sharon Rogers' van," Luchka said. "This was just a practical joke that 
backfired on them."

2 REPUTEDLY HUNTED TARGETS FOR SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two San Diego men charged with the slayings of a pair of Mexican laborers 
scouted the murder site before and after the killings in search of other 
targets, a prosecutor said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But A. David Stutz, the deputy district attorney prosecuting the case, said 
after a Thursday hearing that the two had not found other prospective victims. 
</P>
<P>
"If not for fate, there may have been other victims," said Stutz, who has 
characterized the two suspects as "aspiring Rambos." 
</P>
<P>
The two men were killed Nov. 9 along an isolated stretch of Black Mountain 
Road, in a largely rural area frequented by migrant laborers seeking work in 
nearby fields and nurseries. They were shot a total of 11 times with a South 
Korean-made semiautomatic assault rifle, say authorities, who have recovered 
the weapon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Denied Bail Reduction 
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's hearing, Municipal Court Judge Charles L. Patrick refused to 
lower the $250,000 bail of one of the suspects, Dennis Bencivenga. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Mark McBride, the lawyer representing Bencivenga, asked that bail be reduced to 
$50,000. The lawyer cited the suspect's ties to the community and the fact that 
Bencivenga himself had come forward Jan. 13 and told of his alleged involvement 
in the killings, providing authorities a crucial break in what had been a 
stalled investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Bencivenga's father testified that he would ensure that his son appeared for 
all court hearings and comply with other legal restrictions if he were freed on 
bail. The suspect's grandmother and two friends were also in the courtroom. The 
tall, stocky suspect, wearing jail-issue blues, did not speak during the 
session. But Stutz, the prosecutor, noting that the two victims were killed 
"without any reason," argued that bail should not be lowered. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Preliminary Hearing Set 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary hearing was scheduled for May 1. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have charged that the other suspect, Kenneth Kovzelove, 17, who is 
in the custody of juvenile authorities, was the triggerman. A hearing is 
scheduled April 14 in Juvenile Court to determine if Kovzelove, who turns 18 in 
July, should be tried as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
In the adult system, Kovzelove, like Bencivenga, could face up to life in 
prison on a first-degree murder charge. He can only be held until age 25 in the 
juvenile system. 
</P>
<P>
Both suspects were arrested last week -- Bencivenga at his home in San Diego, 
Kovzelove at Ft. Benning, Ga., where he was in training as an Army paratrooper. 
</P>
<P>
Stutz, the prosecutor, said it is "very unlikely" that the death penalty will 
be sought for Bencivenga. Because Kovzelove is a minor, he cannot be sentenced 
to death. 
</P>
<P>
The two victims have been identified by the coroner's office as Hilario 
Casteneda Salgado, 22, and Matilde Macedo de la Sancha, 19, both citizens of 
Mexico. Both were said to have lived in the bush near the slaying site.

POPE AND U.S. CATHOLICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Were it not so tragic, the irony of it would be hilarious. Now, when even the 
Kremlin has learned that closed authoritarian systems are inherently 
self-destructive, we have the spectacle of the Vatican telling the American 
bishops to silence dissent and impose authority. The Pope is badly served by 
Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger and his Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. 
Silencing Father Charles Curran and others will not stifle the spirit of an 
honest search for truth. 
</P>
<P>
The Dutch, American, and other Catholics, who no longer believe that an 
authoritarian church is either good theology or good institutional policy, are 
moving toward a critical moment in history. The choice is becoming clear; 
either the Vatican makes the same courageous and essential leap as did Mikhail 
Gorbachev and his supporters into glasnost and an open and democratic 
structure, or those committed to freedom and equal human dignity will move on 
into the 21st Century and leave behind a pathetic remnant church stuck in the 
pathology of the dictatorship of a bygone era. 
</P>
<P>
A great evil was begun when Augustine used the civil power of the state to 
silence those who saw a different truth than he saw. Coerced conformity is an 
insult to the spirit of Christ and to God's children today. 
</P>
<P>
Pope John and Vatican II were a breath of fresh and holy air. May they be 
revived before it is too late.

POPE AND U.S. CATHOLICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have been avidly following your coverage of the recent talks of American 
Catholic bishops with the Pope and the Roman Curia. In it I seemed to gather 
that the focus of it all was supposed to be the evangelization of the average 
man or woman in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
However, it seems to be that Rome's attack on American Catholics as being 
pickers and choosers, if pursued with any intensity or vigor, could well bring 
instead the de-evangelization of our church here. 
</P>
<P>
For the people they are addressing are the already declining congregations that 
are still alive. I wouldn't be surprised that the vast number of baptized 
Catholics in this country haven't the foggiest interest in all of this. 
</P>
<P>
So it seems to me what the official church is doing is closing the vise even 
tighter on the only ones who have made any kind of a real commitment to the 
faith. 
</P>
<P>
I sometimes wonder why the thoughts and actions of spirit-filled Catholics are 
so easily considered suspect. Sometimes it looks to me like everything is 
coming from the top down and not vice versa.

BEVERLY HILLS HIGH

<TEXT>
<P>
Your article on the Beverly Hills Board of Education's real estate proposal 
(Metro, March 10) was a sad illustration of carefully worked hype and media 
subordination of the real issue, the quality of academic education at our high 
school. I'm a student at Beverly and I've begun reading, in detail, into the 
proposal. I must say, your lack of attention to significant facts and disregard 
for background has served to make this whole thing a "political football" in 
our district. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was drawn up by a committee to provide several options to lease 
(not to sell, as your article implied) portions of school property to increase 
school funds. Proposition 13 did much to hurt our school district's monetary 
base, and the process of achieving consensus on necessary funding reform has 
been a difficult one. 
</P>
<P>
I have watched the quality of high school education in this state deteriorate. 
I don't want to see that happen here. People need to get their values straight. 
The proposal provides ideas, genuine innovations drawn up by a concerned and 
voluntary committee, to counter financial wavering and to improve the quality 
of education in this district. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Robert Tannenbaum and others would do well to open their eyes and to 
examine the reality of Proposition 13 and the reality of the cuts facing our 
district. I am a senior here and I'll be leaving soon. However, I've gained 
valuable insights attending high school here and in the final analysis, I write 
this letter because education is an issue of "this nation's future" and it's 
worth writing a letter to The Times about it.

PALMDALE AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years Los Angeles city officials have talked about using the huge Palmdale 
Airport as an extension of Los Angeles International Airport. Since the city is 
predicting soaring LAX traffic (March 12), now is the time to put that facility 
to use. There could be an overhead monorail train running from LAX to Palmdale 
Airport to transport passengers, thus alleviating the traffic congestion and 
the presumed huge number of passengers expected by the year 2000. Such action 
would also increase employment and business in both areas.

SOVIET VOTE SHOWS RESILIENCY, NOT FRAGILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY F. HOUGH, Jerry F. Hough is a professor of political and policy 
sciences at Duke University and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The real sub-rosa issue in American debates about the Soviet Union over the 
last few years has been whether the Soviet system is so fragile that it will 
not survive. 
</P>
<P>
The old John Foster Dulles rhetoric about "liberation" gained very serious 
support among top American policy-makers for the first time in the 1980s. The 
Solidarity revolt in Poland over an increase in meat prices (a necessary step 
for economic reform) has led to hopes that Gorbachev's reform program will have 
similar political consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Boris Yeltsin has put together a Solidarity-like coalition by 
promising democracy to the intellectuals and economic populism to the workers, 
those who have hoped to crack the Soviet empire may become even more 
optimistic. However, as the Bush Administration conducts its review of its 
policy toward the Soviet Union, it is time for sober realism, not wishful 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
Without any question, Yeltsin's overwhelming electoral victory is going to 
force Americans to think through their analysis of the Soviet Union in a 
consistent way. The same people who think that fear of worker riots may prevent 
an increase in meat prices also see Gorbachev as a heroic, lonely figure 
fighting overwhelming conservative opposition. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the most significant opposition to Gorbachev will always come from the 
liberal, not the conservative side. If the workers demonstrate, it will not be 
for a return to Brezhnevism, but for freely elected trade unions to protect 
their economic position and job security. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-March the Soviet Union published the report of the Central Committee 
plenum, in which Yeltsin was dismissed as a Central Committee member. The 
report makes clear that Yeltsin deliberately provoked a fight with Gorbachev in 
order to position himself clearly to the left of the Soviet leader on the issue 
of democratization. Yeltsin seems to be following a strategy like that of 
former Philippine Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile, who broke with President 
Corazon Aquino very early in her administration in order to be a credible 
alternative in case she failed. At the plenum, Gorbachev and others accused 
Yeltsin of personal ambition. They seem to have been right. If Gorbachev fails, 
Yeltsin hopes to be general secretary or perhaps the first elected president. 
</P>
<P>
The question is: How do things look for him now? On the one level, very good. 
He was removed from the party leadership of Moscow in disgrace, but now 89% of 
Moscow voters have selected him in a free election. He has a vindication and 
legitimization that must be heady indeed. 
</P>
<P>
On another level, however, Yeltsin will not find it easy to build on his 
victory. There will not be another national election for five years. If he 
assumes an active role in the new Congress of People's Deputies, he will find 
it difficult to espouse both radical economic reform and the price stability 
that the workers want. He easily could lose the special position he has now. 
His best strategy is probably to try to put himself in charge of a free 
trade-union movement as Lech Walesa did in Poland, but that is seldom the path 
to national leadership in any country. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, we should not exaggerate Gorbachev's difficulties. Those Americans 
who have hoped to see the Soviet regime crumble have depicted Gorbachev as a 
man doing a perilous high-wire act. They will now want to see him teetering. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Yeltsin's election has compensations for Gorbachev. Gorbachev has used 
Yegor Ligachev as a bogeyman to restrain the liberals, and now he can use 
Yeltsin in any battles with conservatives in the Central Committee and the 
military. Gorbachev can argue that change must be introduced to maintain 
stability in a population voting for the most radical candidate, and the 
implicit threat of a Gorbachev-Yeltsin appeal for mass action should be truly 
frightening. Any politician likes to be in the center, and Gorbachev has now 
achieved that. 
</P>
<P>
The question is whether the pressure for more democracy will continue to build. 
Well over half the Soviet population have a high school diploma or better, and 
dictatorships generally have real difficulties maintaining control as education 
levels rise that high. 
</P>
<P>
If the Soviet Union were a country composed of one nationality group, like 
Poland, the dictatorship would be very difficult to preserve. The multinational 
nature of the Soviet Union is, however, a real plus for Gorbachev. The 
non-Russian nationality groups are individually too small to pose a seious 
threat (there are only 1.5 million Estonians, for example), and the Russian 
enthusiasm for democracy is tempered by the knowledge that it would mean the 
breakup of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has a juggling act to do, but not on a high-wire. He can occasionally 
slip up without destroying himself. He and the Soviet Union are going to be 
around for some time. If he is willing to help us reduce our military budgets 
and our deficits, we should be taking advantage of the opportunity rather than 
chasing illusions about seeing the Soviet Union crumble.

OTHER COMMENTARY

By CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER

<TEXT>
<P>
The way to cut down on oil consumption, and thus oil transport and thus oil 
disasters, is by substitution. And that means nuclear power. But just as 
Americans do not want to pay a few extra pennies for gas, they refuse to run 
the one in a zillion chance of getting killed in a nuclear-power accident like 
Three Mile Island. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition to nuclear power is fueled by risk aversion. But the idea that 
we are reducing risk by burning coal and oil is an example of willful myopia. 
The ecological risks of coal and oil are immense. They are, however, not always 
immediately visible. They are shunted far away, to the atmosphere, to Alaska, 
to future "greenhoused" generations -- anywhere but my back yard. 
</P>
<P>
A country that, for no better reason than the fear of fear itself, kills a 
$5-billion modern and safe nuclear plant in Shoreham, Long Island, before it 
has produced a watt of usable energy has no right to complain when its Alaskan 
shoreline is devastated by a tanker bringing portable fuel from elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The lamentations rise for the fish and fowl and future of Prince William Sound. 
The blame-laying and the breast-beating has begun. They miss the point. The 
Valdez disaster represents America's attempt to export risk. The only reason we 
are now so upset is that this time we did not export it quite far enough.

CRISES FIND OUR HEADS IN THE SAND; 
</P>
<P>
IN A MODERN WORLD, OUR RESPONSES ARE WAY OUT OF DATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IAN I. MITROFF, Ian I. Mitroff is a professor of business policy and 
director of the Center for Crisis Management at USC's Graduate School of 
Business. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again, we have been hit by a series of "seemingly unrelated" crises. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A death threat is directed against British author Salman Rushdie by Iran's 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, in turn endangering freedom of speech in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Following a telephoned threat, the federal Food and Drug Administration 
imposes a ban on Chilean produce after trace amounts of a poison are found in 
two grapes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- There is widespread fear that U.S. apples in particular and fruit in 
general may be widely contaminated by a broad range of cancer-causing 
pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A tanker runs aground outside the port of Valdez, Alaska, causing the 
largest oil spill in American history and endangering one of the most fragile 
and beautiful ecological areas in the world. 
</P>
<P>
All are more related than they appear. And all contain some strong lessons 
about all crises. 
</P>
<P>
Lesson No. 1: All crises are now either global or have the potential to 
escalate very quickly up to the global level. Before the advent of modern 
telecommunications and jet travel, an incident of the magnitude of a Tylenol 
product-tampering, a computer-generated stock market crash, the Rushdie 
incident or the banning of Chilean grapes either would not have happened or 
would have been much less significant. Today, a psychopath can hop on a jet and 
contaminate foodstuffs and pharmaceutical products in multiple cities in one 
day. That's why the threat of nationwide product-tampering has to be taken so 
seriously. In this regard, improved telecommunications and travel are mixed 
blessings, to put it mildly. 
</P>
<P>
Lesson No. 2: Denial is still disturbingly high. Terrorism, environmental 
accidents, product-tampering, etc., are still thought to be specific to certain 
industries or, worse, someone else's problem. Six months or a year ago, someone 
talking to the major New York book publishers about the possibility of their 
industry being hit by a major incident of international terrorism would 
probably have been met with laughter or shrugged shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
Lesson No. 3: We have to bump from crisis to crisis until finally it dawns that 
no industries are exempt. All are subject virtually to every known kind of 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Lesson No. 4: We invent and put into place complex technologies before we know 
how to control them or think about controlling them. Only after they fail do we 
then think of better methods of control. In the case of the oil spill in 
Valdez, our preparations for reacting to a spill have proven to be as fragile 
as the environment they were supposed to protect. Or consider the highly 
sophisticated, computerized trading programs that speeded up the volume of 
stock market transactions. Only after these systems played a significant role 
in the October, 1987, stock market crash did we ask the important question: 
"What organizational controls should we have put in place in case the 
technology doesn't work?" 
</P>
<P>
Lesson No. 5: Our current institutions are a major part of the problem. We have 
mass media and computer systems that can spread information so quickly that 
they can shut down a nationwide food system at the drop of a hat. At the same 
time, we don't have sophisticated information systems (although the technology 
is available) whereby as many of the affected parties as possible (i.e., the 
representatives of the Chilean and U.S. governments, the FDA, the FBI, 
retailers and distributors) can communicate freely to one another before, 
during and after a crisis in order to weigh collectively the best courses of 
action before one party, acting on its own, shuts down the whole system. It 
seems to take from 30 to 70 years after a new technology has been invented to 
create the appropriate institutions capable of managing it. This gap is no 
longer tolerable because crises not only happen with increasing frequency, but 
also because they are larger in their effects. We have to find better ways to 
learn and to redesign our institutions faster. 
</P>
<P>
Lesson No. 6: Lacking better institutions and control mechanisms leads to "all 
or nothing actions," such as taking all grapes off the market. It is akin to 
termite eradication before modern treatment methods: Either burn your house 
down or leave it alone, thereby potentially contaminating the whole 
neighborhood. When you have little or no controls, there is almost no room for 
graduated responses. 
</P>
<P>
Lesson No. 7: The worst time to invent social-control mechanisms is in the heat 
of a crisis. Armies have learned long ago that soldiers need basic training 
before they go into battle. While basic training may not be perfect, it lowers 
substantially both the physical and the mental casualties of war. 
</P>
<P>
Lesson No. 8: We're running 21st-Century systems of vast technological 
complexity with outmoded 19th-Century thinking. In the 19th Century, it was 
appropriate to think and manage by "containment and isolation" because, for the 
most part, crises were confined in space and time. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, like we always have, our thinking (we hope) will catch up. But how 
many more crises will it take before we finally realize that, in every sense, 
it is no longer business as usual? Nothing less that a total redesign of our 
institutions is needed so that we and they can not only react, but prevent 
these crises from occurring in the first place. If we do not, then the 
mega-crisis may be the only area of production in which the United States will 
continue to lead the world.

CHENEY'S JOB: VISUALIZE THE WARS AND ROLES WE'RE EQUIPPING FOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY G. SUMMERS JR., Author of On Strategy and the forthcoming Sound 
Military Decisions, Col. Harry Summers formerly held the Gen. Douglas MacArthur 
Chair at the Army War College. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The main job of the new secretary of defense, Dick Cheney, one that's far more 
difficult and complex than it may sound, is purely intellectual. It is to come 
up with what in 1914 Navy Cmdr. (later Commodore) Dudley Knox called a 
"conception of war." 
</P>
<P>
Only when one begins with a visualization of how the armed forces would be used 
in extremis to protect the homeland and defend its interests can one begin to 
figure out its size and composition and determine how it should be equipped. 
Otherwise, Knox warned, you are in effect "building a house from the roof 
down." 
</P>
<P>
That's precisely what we've been doing for some time now -- build both a B-1 
and a stealth bomber, then try to justify their war-fighting roles; create 
light Army divisions and then argue about how they would be used in combat; 
maintain forward-deployed U.S. units in Europe to implement a nuclear-based 
short-war strategy, while at the same time building a "600-ship Navy" 
specifically designed for a non-nuclear long-war conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Such confusion is the direct result of a lack of a clear and up-to-date 
conception of the war-fighting role of our armed forces. And that confusion, as 
Knox predicted, leads to the roof constantly falling in at the Pentagon. Taken 
out of a war-fighting context, nothing makes sense. How can one calculate 
whether the cost of a B-1 bomber or an M-1 tank is appropriate if its national 
defense value has neither been determined nor explained? 
</P>
<P>
Cheney has come on board at a time when all the old verities of more than a 
generation -- nuclear-based defenses, forward-basing, coalition strategies -- 
have begun to crumple. Even the focus of our foreign policy and its supporting 
military policies -- the containment of the Soviet Union and its surrogates -- 
have been blurred by glasnost and perestroika. A new conception of war is 
desperately needed. 
</P>
<P>
In facing this tough challenge, Cheney may have one thing going for him that 
his critics have overlooked. He has the opportunity to face his challenges with 
a clean slate. Uncommitted to past policies, his thoughts unclouded by old 
truths, he may be able to more easily discern the future role our armed forces 
must play in the defense of our nation and in the protection of its interests. 
With that conception at hand, he will find that the other problems facing the 
Department of Defense are easily addressed.

INGLEWOOD RACE SEES INCUMBENT DEFENDING HONOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two-term Inglewood Councilman Anthony Scardenzan faces three challengers in a 
race where the issues include crime, growth, the city's power structure, and 
honesty. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Ganier, Scardenzan's main challenger in Tuesday's election, has accused 
the incumbent of traveling at city expense to his hometown in Italy as part of 
Inglewood's Sister Cities program. Ganier has offered no proof of this, and 
city travel records show Scardenzan paid his own way. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his incumbency, Scardenzan, 60, who owns a Gardena tool and die shop, 
trails Ganier in fund raising, having raised $13,835 as of last week. Ganier, 
53, a maintenance supervisor for the Inglewood schools, reported raising 
$14,585. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Also Running 
</P>
<P>
Also running in the District 2 race, but far behind in fund raising, are Andrew 
Chapralis, 63, the owner of an Inglewood burglar alarm company who ran 
unsuccessfully in 1985, and Daniel Checo Langston, 46, a management consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Scardenzan spearheaded a drive to fight gangs and drugs by hiring 20 
new police officers through a tax assessment, saying the extra police were 
worth the political risk of promoting higher taxes. Voters overwhelmingly 
approved the measure in November. 
</P>
<P>
"I fought the longest for it," Scardenzan said. "I'm doing everything I can to 
fight crime, not just talking about it." 
</P>
<P>
Ganier, however, has labeled Scardenzan an "instigator of crime," accusing the 
councilman of allowing widespread development of apartment complexes that cause 
congestion, crime and overcrowded schools. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Housing Blamed 
</P>
<P>
"The housing pattern in the district has created crime," Ganier said in an 
interview. "People are being treated like cattle. They're packed in on top of 
each other. It's unhealthy. There's dissatisfaction with Scardenzan. He's 
provided absolutely no service." 
</P>
<P>
In response, Scardenzan said he sponsored an emergency moratorium on 
construction in the city last year, then pushed for passage of last year's law 
that reduced density throughout Inglewood. At Scardenzan's request, the law 
imposed a particularly tough rezoning in his north Inglewood district, reducing 
allowable building heights by half and increasing setbacks, parking 
requirements and minimum property size for construction of new units. 
</P>
<P>
Scardenzan emphasizes his record of independence. In 1984, he was the only 
council member voting against an $11-million refuse contract awarded to Western 
Waste Industries, a contract that Scardenzan and many residents opposed because 
it was awarded without competitive bidding. 
</P>
<P>
Scardenzan also was the only council member to actively oppose Proposition 1, a 
ballot initiative defeated in 1987 that would have given Inglewood a full-time 
mayor with four times the mayor's present $10,800 annual salary. 
</P>
<P>
Ganier has criticized Scardenzan for his recent vote to grant City Manager Paul 
Eckles a three-year contract extension -- approved three to one by the council 
-- which raised Eckles' salary to about $122,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Ganier said he favors making council members full-time officials, saying they 
have more of a stake in the city than administrators, many of whom live 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Scardenzan called the idea of a full-time council for a city of 104,000 
residents a waste of taxpayers' funds and questioned Ganier's motives. 
</P>
<P>
"People that run for office should have their own job," Scardenzan said. "They 
should feel like they are giving something to the city, not taking something 
from the city. He's looking for job security for himself, not good government 
and administration for the city." 
</P>
<P>
The union representing the city's police officers has endorsed Scardenzan, as 
have Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn and State Sen. Diane Watson 
(D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
Ganier has the backing of Assemblyman Curtis Tucker Jr. (D-Inglewood). Although 
Ganier has been a political contributor to Mayor Edward Vincent in the past, 
Vincent has recently spoken well of Scardenzan -- who has been an occasional 
rival. Vincent has not made an endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
Ganier is making his first bid for public office, but he is no political 
neophyte, as evidenced by his well-financed campaign. Ganier's past political 
involvement includes working on the 1987 campaign of Councilman Ervin (Tony) 
Thomas, whose election was later annulled because of widespread Election Code 
violations by Mayor Vincent and other campaign workers. 
</P>
<P>
Ganier said that he did not participate in any of those violations, and that he 
opposes a recent decision by the council to appeal that election annulment to 
the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Ganier's allegation that Scardenzan traveled to Italy at taxpayer expense is 
made in a campaign brochure. It says the trips were taken as part of the Sister 
Cities program that Scardenzan initiated with his birthplace, Pedavena. 
</P>
<P>
But city records show that Scardenzan used his own money for the two trips he 
has taken to Italy since the program of student exchanges began in 1985. The 
program is financed jointly by the city of Inglewood and private contributors. 
</P>
<P>
Scardenzan said: "He keeps on lying. He's doing it with a malicious intention 
because he wants to discredit me, not because I've done something wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Ganier would not provide proof of his allegation, saying: "Let him sue me. I 
stand by what I've printed." 
</P>
<P>
Doris Haisler, chairwoman of the Sister Cities Committee, said Scardenzan has 
housed and entertained students and other participants in the program at his 
own expense. 
</P>
<P>
"For him to be accused of this is absolutely outrageous," she said. "It is an 
absolute lie. He has done just the opposite. He has been incredibly generous." 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the aggressive tone of his campaign, Ganier said: "He's got to 
do what he's got to do, and I've got to do what I've got to do." 
</P>
<P>
Another disputed element of the campaign is an October, 1988, letter on 
Inglewood Unified School District stationery, signed by Ganier. The letter, 
addressed "Dear Neighbor," complains about problems caused by construction in 
the council district and criticizes Scardenzan, but does not say that Ganier 
planned to challenge him in Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
Scardenzan says Ganier's use of school district stationery for political 
literature is a misuse of public funds. 
</P>
<P>
Ganier acknowledges writing the text of the letter but said someone copied his 
original letter onto district stationery in an effort to discredit him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Candidates 
</P>
<P>
Langston appeared at a candidate forum recently, and his signs are visible in 
the district. But he has failed to file any campaign spending reports and has 
been notified by City Clerk Hermanita Harris that he risks fines for missing 
two reporting deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
Langston said his treasurer had not been aware of the deadlines and said he 
would file his statement this week. He estimated that he had raised about 
$1,500. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is better qualified than Scardenzan because he has a background in 
management and runs a management consulting firm. He joined in the call for a 
full-time council that would decrease the city manager's power. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the city has grown, and there is a different need," he said. 
"Everything right now is concentrated in the city manager. You could better 
utilize resources and fund four full-time councilmen and a mayor with the city 
manager's salary." 
</P>
<P>
Chapralis, a security consultant, said he is a 45-year resident of Inglewood 
and is running for the council for the third time because he perceives 
dissatisfaction with Scardenzan. 
</P>
<P>
"I can remember when this was a growing city," he said. "I want to make it that 
way again." 
</P>
<P>
Chapralis, who filed a short form indicating he will not spend more than 
$1,000, said he thinks the police should put more officers on the street to 
curb gang activity.

BAR IMPLICATED IN FATAL CRASH IS INVESTIGATED

The Ramada Inn in Agoura Hills served a margarita to a teen-age girl just a 
week after allegedly serving alcohol to two minors who were later killed in a 
car crash, an investigator for the state Department of Alcoholic Beverage 
Control said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The department will levy a fine of up to $1,500 for serving the teen-ager last 
Friday, said Lonnie Corley, an ABC supervising special investigator. 
</P>
<P>
The ABC began investigating the Menagerie bar at the Ramada Inn in the 30100 
block of West Agoura Road last week after receiving reports that the youths 
involved in the March 18 car crash had been drinking at the bar shortly before 
the accident, Corley said. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Sinclair, 18, of Thousand Oaks and Michael Holcomb, 20, of Moorpark 
were killed when their car smashed into a utility pole, said Sgt. Kevin Mauch 
of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Matthew Tupin, 20, of Westlake 
Village survived, Mauch said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bought Alcohol at Bar 
</P>
<P>
Tupin told police that he purchased alcohol at the Ramada Inn bar, Mauch said. 
State law prohibits bars serving drinks to anyone under 21. Tupin would not 
tell police about his friends' actions, Mauch said. Tupin, who authorities said 
was recuperating at his parents' home, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, an ABC investigator observed a young woman buying a margarita at the 
hotel's bar without being asked for identification, Corley said. When 
approached by an ABC investigator, the girl produced identification showing 
that she was under 21. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel has the right to appeal the fine by asking for a hearing before a 
state administrative law judge, Corley said. Hotel officials did not return 
phone calls from The Times on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators will ask the Agoura Hills city attorney to file misdemeanor 
charges against the bartender, Corley said. However, he noted, patrons were 
being asked for proof of age at the entrance of the bar. The girl may have 
sneaked into the bar, Corley said.

POLICE SEEK 'MR. MAGOO BANDIT' IN 7 BANK HEISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police are looking for a man in thick prescription glasses -- nicknamed the 
"Mr. Magoo Bandit" -- who is suspected of robbing seven banks in five South Bay 
communities during a feverish 24-hour crime spree Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, whose apparent poor eyesight reminds FBI agents of the 
grandfatherly cartoon character, made off with at least $10,000 from banks in 
Torrance, Hermosa Beach, Redondo Beach, Rolling Hills Estates and San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got so many darned bank robberies that I've lost track," said Torrance 
Police Sgt. Jack McDonald. "This guy is very unusual. Most guys just rob once a 
day or once every other day, when they need the money." 
</P>
<P>
The thief's frenetic pace has FBI officials drawing comparisons with some of 
Los Angeles' most prolific bank robbers, including Edward Chambers Dodson, the 
"Yankee Bandit." Dodson sported a New York Yankees baseball cap while robbing 
64 banks over six months in 1983 and 1984, FBI agents said. Dodson pleaded 
guilty to eight robberies and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dresses Neatly 
</P>
<P>
The South Bay bank robber's resemblance to Mr. Magoo ends with his glasses: He 
is in his early 30s, just under 6 feet tall and weighs between 150 and 170 
pounds, police said. He is white, with light brown or blond hair, and his face 
is marked with small scars, perhaps from acne. He dresses neatly, sometimes 
wears a tie and carries a brown satchel or briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
In each of the seven thefts, the robber passed a note demanding money and 
indicated that he had a weapon, said Fred Reagan, a spokesman for the FBI, 
which is coordinating the investigation. McDonald said that in at least one 
case, the thief showed a bank teller a revolver. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured during the robberies. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities declined to discuss further details of the crimes, including how 
much was stolen from each institution or how they would combat the thief. "That 
would give away our plan," McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan described the spree this way: 
</P>
<P>
The bandit hit the First Nationwide Savings branch on Pacific Coast Highway in 
Torrance at 10:22 a.m. Wednesday. Twenty-five minutes later, he was two miles 
to the northwest at the Sanwa Bank on Hawthorne Boulevard in Torrance. In 
another 19 minutes, at 11:06 a.m., he hit the Bank of America on Catalina 
Avenue in Redondo Beach. He ended the day by robbing the Far West Savings &amp; 
Loan on Pacific Coast Highway in Hermosa Beach at 11:22 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
One hour, four robberies. 
</P>
<P>
The thief got away with at least $10,000 on Wednesday, a local law enforcement 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
When banks reopened Thursday morning, Reagan said, the bandit went back to 
work. At 9:10 a.m. he hit the World Savings branch on Rolling Hills Road at the 
south end of Torrance. At 9:30 a.m., he was further south on the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula, where he robbed Great Western Savings in the Rolling Hills Estates 
Peninsula Center. And at 10 a.m., he knocked off the Bank of America branch on 
25th Street in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty minutes, three more robberies. 
</P>
<P>
The "Mr. Magoo Bandit" is the latest scourge in a tough year for South Bay 
banks and savings and loans, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald said 11 banks and savings and loans in Torrance have been robbed this 
month, compared to the average month that has two or three robberies. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities are blaming 10 other bank robberies this year on the "Soft-Spoken 
Bandit." Reagan said that since Jan. 1 that thief -- a quiet man who calls 
tellers "ma'am" -- robbed seven banks in Torrance, one in San Pedro, one in 
Manhattan Beach and one in Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan said the most recent robbery by the "Soft-Spoken Bandit" occurred March 
22 at the Imperial Savings at Torrance and Hawthorne boulevards.

CENTINELA HOSPITAL DECISION LEAVES A VOID; 
</P>
<P>
SHUTDOWN SHUTS OUT EMERGENCY OBSTETRIC PATIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Inglewood hospital's decision to close its emergency room to patients 
brought by paramedics has sent county health officials searching for another 
nearby facility with the expertise to treat newborns and their mothers. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Williams, director of hospitals for the county's Department of Health 
Services, said talks are under way with Marina Hills Hospital in Ladera Heights 
to take obstetric patients when they are turned away from Centinela Hospital 
Medical Center, beginning April 26. 
</P>
<P>
While paramedics will no longer be bringing any patients to the facility, 
concern is greatest about obstetric and newborn care because Centinela is the 
only hospital in the immediate area with an obstetrics unit. 
</P>
<P>
As such, paramedics routinely transport such cases to the 50-year-old, 
nonprofit facility, health care officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Centinela, which cited ballooning debts in winning state approval March 17 to 
stop accepting patients brought to it by paramedics, will continue to provide 
emergency services to people who come to the hospital on their own and to those 
transported by private ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
"I am concerned about the care of not only high-risk mothers, but also low-risk 
mothers," said Williams, adding that the county had attempted to convince 
Centinela to continue treating obstetric patients brought in by paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital's decision to stop accepting some patients brought by paramedics 
drew an immediate response last week from two neighboring hospitals. Officials 
of those hospitals say they fear they could be stuck filling the obstetrics 
void created by Centinela. In the low-income area served by the hospitals, some 
women have no regular physician and receive birthing services at emergency 
rooms, said hospital and other health care officials. 
</P>
<P>
Robert F. Kennedy Medical Center in Hawthorne asked the state Department of 
Health Services on March 20 to allow it to stop taking patients brought in by 
paramedics beginning April 26. The 274-bed hospital is concerned primarily that 
it will face a large increase in obstetric patients that it cannot adequately 
care for in its emergency room, according to Robert Shaw, the hospital's 
president. 
</P>
<P>
"The time spent with an obstetrical patient in labor can be up to five or six 
times that (spent) with a normal emergency patient," Shaw said in an interview 
this week. " . . .You can step away for a minute and there is a serious 
complication." 
</P>
<P>
That concern is echoed by officials at Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in 
Inglewood. Vice President Jim Barber said Wednesday that the 203-bed hospital, 
which shut down its obstetrics unit five years ago, is pressing county 
officials to quickly sign an agreement with another hospital such as Marina 
Hills to handle such cases. 
</P>
<P>
"Paramedic runs to our hospital will increase beyond the level where we can 
safely manage high-risk patients," warned Barber, who estimated that 150 
obstetric cases were brought to Freeman by paramedics last year. 
</P>
<P>
"This is 1989. We should not be delivering high-risk mothers in the emergency 
department, and we are going to be," Barber said. "And we think that is an 
outrageous and unnecessary situation to be in." 
</P>
<P>
Marina Hills' executive director, Robert Shell, confirmed that officials at the 
103-bed hospital have met with the county about accepting obstetric patients 
brought by paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital, formerly called Ladera Heights Community Hospital, has an 
obstetrics ward, but no emergency room, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said he is optimistic that the county can reach some sort of agreement 
with Marina Hills. 
</P>
<P>
If the county is unable to strike a deal with Marina Hills or some other 
hospital, some non-emergency obstetric patients -- for example, a mother who 
appears to giving a normal birth -- may wind up being taken to county-operated 
Martin Luther King-Drew Medical Center in Willowbrook. That hospital has 
already been confronted with crowded conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"They are delivering as many babies as they can handle," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Critical obstetric patients would be taken to the nearest hospital with an 
emergency room, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Local hospital officials contend that Centinela's decision to stop taking 
paramedic patients is yet another example of the county's escalating health 
care crisis brought about by the state's refusal to ante up enough money. 
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, 16 hospitals in the Los Angeles metropolitan area have 
closed their trauma centers or emergency rooms, according to the Hospital 
Council of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Centinela President Russell Stromberg said that his hospital in fiscal 1988 
carried $8.4 million in unpaid bills and donated services. He estimated that 
more than $1 million of that is directly attributable to obstetrics patients 
brought to the hospital by paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
Stromberg agreed that Centinela, as a nonprofit hospital that receives 
substantial tax benefits, has an obligation to provide services to people who 
may not have the money or insurance to pay. However, he said the hospital has 
reached a breaking point. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a responsibility to give as much charity care as we can afford to 
give, and we have absolutely reached our limit," he said. ". . . . We can't be 
forced to go out of business." 
</P>
<P>
Stromberg said that he recommended a year ago to Centinela's board of directors 
that the facility stop accepting paramedic patients, but the board was 
reluctant to follow his advice. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its location, Centinela treats a sizable number of poor mothers, 
some of whom do not even qualify for Medi-Cal, Stromberg said. For some, their 
first visit to a doctor comes when they deliver their baby in the emergency 
room, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As such, the chances that the mother or infant may develop complications that 
result in longer, more costly, hospital stays are heightened, he said. Although 
some such patients qualify for state assistance and the hospital eventually 
receives some money to defray the cost of their care, many patients either do 
not qualify for assistance or refuse to apply for it, he said.

ATTORNEY QUESTIONS POLICE CREDIBILITY; 
</P>
<P>
BOMB TRIAL EVIDENCE CALLED WEAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<P>
A defense attorney told jurors Thursday that physical evidence linking a North 
Hollywood makeup artist to a bomb that killed two police explosives experts is 
"extremely, extremely weak" and that police witnesses lost credibility when 
their testimony differed on details. 
</P>
<P>
Also, two prosecution witnesses whose testimony linked defendant Donald Lee 
Morse to the pipe bomb might have had ulterior motives for their statements, 
defense attorney Bernard J. Rosen said. 
</P>
<P>
Morse, a 39-year-old television and film makeup artist, is charged with two 
counts of murder and two counts of possessing explosives in the officers' 
deaths. Detective Arleigh McCree, 46, commander of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's bomb squad, and Officer Ronald Ball, 43, were killed Feb. 8, 1986, 
when they tried to dismantle the bomb, one of two found in Morse's garage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deliberations Monday 
</P>
<P>
Jurors will begin deliberations Monday in the San Fernando Superior Court case. 
Judge John H. Major presided over the trial. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Morse could be sentenced to life in prison without possibility of 
parole. He has been in Los Angeles County Jail without bail since the officers 
were killed. 
</P>
<P>
Morse, who did not testify at his trial, told police at the time that he had 
never seen the bomb before and had allowed others to use his garage for 
storage. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Sterling E. Norris scoffed at Rosen's contention that the 
bombs belonged to someone else, although he did not suggest why the defendant 
might have built the devices. 
</P>
<P>
"It's his house . . . his blasting powder, his fingerprints, his bomb manual," 
the prosecutor told jurors. "He's the bomber. He's the man who made the bombs." 
</P>
<P>
Police experts testified in the trial that Morse's fingerprints were on a 
bomb-making manual found in the house. They also said his fingerprints were on 
a coffee can discovered in the kitchen that contained blasting powder like that 
used in the bomb that McCree and Ball dismantled before attempting the second 
one, which exploded. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shotgun Shells Found 
</P>
<P>
Police also testified that in Morse's bedroom they found shotgun shells similar 
to those in the dismantled bomb, although no shotgun was found at the house. 
</P>
<P>
Carpet fibers found on the bomb also closely matched those taken from Morse's 
house, experts said. Morse's van, locked and parked near the garage, had two 
batteries similar to those used in the dismantled bomb, the prosecution said. 
</P>
<P>
But Rosen contended that nine-volt batteries are commonplace. And all that 
could be concluded from prosecution testimony on carpet fibers is that those on 
the bomb "could have a common origin with those in the Morse house, or they 
might not," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rosen also dismissed testimony by a former neighbor of Morse who quoted the 
defendant as saying in 1982 or 1983, "I know how to make a bomb," and showing 
him a bomb-making manual. 
</P>
<P>
The witness, Al Ward, "waited an incredible 10 months after the officers' 
deaths before telling that story to police," Rosen said. He suggested that Ward 
knew from news accounts the charges against Morse and "could merely have been 
basing his statement on that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Motives Questioned 
</P>
<P>
Rosen also questioned the motives of William M. Enoch, Morse's estranged 
brother-in-law, who testified that 10 days before the bomb blast Morse had 
threatened to blow him up with a bomb. Enoch might have been trying to curry 
favor with the police in the hope of enlisting their aid in his custody battle 
with his then-wife Ernestine, who had moved into the Morse house with the 
couple's three children, Rosen said. 
</P>
<P>
Norris characterized Enoch as "nothing more than a concerned father" who had 
nothing to gain from police in a civil dispute. 
</P>
<P>
And he noted that the defense had suggested no reason Ward, a former friend of 
Morse, would invent such a story. 
</P>
<P>
Rosen also concentrated on contradictory testimony by police officers about 
which shelf the bomb was found on, suggesting that the conflicts shook the 
officers' credibility. 
</P>
<P>
"What possible significance could that have?" Norris demanded in rebuttal, 
adding that witnesses frequently differ on details.

SAN PEDRO 'LOSING IDENTITY' IN FRENZY OF CONSTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Saturday afternoon, March 18, approximately 300 San Pedro residents came 
together at Peck Park auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
For 300 San Pedro residents to gather on such a lovely springlike day, the 
reason had to be important. It was, for today San Pedro has a crisis brewing. 
The crisis is a building industry that has gone crazy. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who has to travel on Pacific Avenue or Gaffey Street in the mornings and 
early evenings or wants to park his car in front of his residence knows what I 
am writing about. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the problem is greater than just morning traffic or parking. The 
problem is that San Pedro is losing the small-town community atmosphere we are 
famous for. We are losing our identity. We are losing our homes. These 
architectural treasures and single-family homes are being replaced with 
brand-new stucco multi-unit residences designed by people who should be looking 
for another line of work. 
</P>
<P>
What is going on in San Pedro? It is the rape of this town by a small but very 
powerful building industry, with the help of Los Angeles city officials who 
choose to ignore the views of the vast majority. These Los Angeles bureaucrats, 
with the help of developers, have created plans that, if allowed to be put into 
operation, would have flattened Barton Hill, turning it into Marina del Rey 
South. 
</P>
<P>
These are the same officials who, in their infinite wisdom, decided that a 
large section of Pacific Avenue should become Apartment Row. 
</P>
<P>
The result of this ongoing rape of our lovely little town is 300 caring, 
disgusted and angry citizens giving up their Saturday afternoon to sign 
petitions, form groups and join committees in an attempt to right a wrong that 
has been allowed to go on way too long. 
</P>
<P>
If the local Los Angeles city officials continue to ignore the needs of the 
citizens of this small town, then maybe the actions of two decades ago, which 
succeeded in stopping an illegal war, should be thought about. Or maybe the 
time is fast approaching to tell the bureaucrats in Los Angeles, "It has been 
real great, but we San Pedrans are sick of being treated like a necessary but 
unwanted stepchild." It's time to cut the cord.

WOMAN ARRESTED AFTER COLLISION WITH POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Burbank woman was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving after her car hit a 
police car in Sunland, injuring herself, two police officers and two women who 
were riding with her, Los Angeles police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Christina Schirmeister, 20, was given a blood-alcohol test at the time of the 
accident about 9:30 p.m. Wednesday, according to Officer Douglas Burns of the 
Valley Traffic Division. 
</P>
<P>
Officers Joseph Napolitano, who was driving the police car, and Ron Calhoun 
were treated for minor injuries at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills 
after their car was rear-ended by a 1986 Subaru driven by Schirmeister, police 
said. Schirmeister and her two passengers were also treated for minor injuries, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The patrol car was making a U-turn on Foothill Boulevard at Wentworth Street 
when it was hit, said Officer Brad Peters. Both cars suffered major damage, he 
said.

COLORADO QUARTERBACK AUNESE IS SAID TO HAVE STOMACH CANCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CURT HOLBREICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sal Aunese, the University of Colorado's starting quarterback, has inoperable 
stomach cancer, according to a doctor's diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
The diagnosis was confirmed after a biopsy this week revealed that the cancer 
has spread to his lungs and the lymph nodes near the lungs, team physician Dr. 
Wayne Gersoff said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a bad tumor to have," Gersoff said by telephone from his Denver office. 
"To be honest, compared to other types, we are not as successful at treating 
this cancer as we are with others." 
</P>
<P>
Aunese, a junior from Vista High School in San Diego County, was admitted to 
University Hospital in Denver Sunday after complaining for several weeks of a 
respiratory problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Initially, we felt he had a bad cold," Gersoff said. 
</P>
<P>
A chest X-ray was taken Sunday, and further tests revealed a stomach tumor, 
Gersoff said. He said he could not say exactly how large the tumor is, only 
that it is inoperable. 
</P>
<P>
Gersoff said the cancer spread quickly. A chest X-ray taken after Aunese 
injured his ribs in an Oct. 15 game against Kansas showed no sign of the 
disease, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Aunese, 20, is to begin chemotherapy Monday and will remain at University 
Hospital during the treatment, Gersoff said. Stomach cancer is an uncommon form 
of the disease, affecting eight out of every 100,000 Americans, and is 
especially rare for someone as young as Aunese. 
</P>
<P>
"This type of cancer is not genetically related or environmental or dietary," 
Gersoff said. "It is just one of those things that randomly develops." 
</P>
<P>
Gersoff, an orthopedic surgeon and director of sports medicine at the 
University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver, said he does not know 
what kind of success to expect from the chemotherapy, but indicated that Aunese 
is facing a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"If he responds to the chemotherapy, he could have a very good survival rate," 
Gersoff said. "But if he doesn't respond to the chemotherapy, he could have a 
matter of months (to live)." 
</P>
<P>
He said Aunese was told Thursday of the seriousness of the cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"Sal does have in his favor that he is young, he previously has been strong and 
healthy, and he has a strong will," Gersoff said. 
</P>
<P>
A school spokesman said that Aunese, his family and Colorado Coach Bill 
McCartney do not want to comment at this time. 
</P>
<P>
"Sal and family stressed that they appreciate the concern of everyone, and 
their interest in wanting to help," Gersoff said. 
</P>
<P>
Aunese, 5-foot-11 and 195 pounds, sat out his freshman season at Colorado 
because he was ineligible under requirements of National Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. Proposition 48. He took over as Colorado's starting quarterback in the 
fourth game of the 1987 season and went on to lead the team in rushing (612 
yards), passing (522) and total offense (1,134). 
</P>
<P>
Last season, he passed for 1,004 yards and had 1,401 yards in total offense in 
leading Colorado to an 8-4 record and the Freedom Bowl.

COLLECTORS BLAME FOR PRICES OF AUTOGRAPHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Henneman, The Baltimore Evening Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that the obnoxious pay-per-autograph season is behind us for another year, 
let's divide the blame and put it where it belongs. If you're among the 
thousands of collectors, you might not like the idea that the players are not 
at the top of the pecking order here. 
</P>
<P>
Who is responsible for those outlandish prices charged for signatures at card 
shows around the country? 
</P>
<P>
It will come as a disappointment to the purists in ga-ga land that "greedy," 
"self-centered," or "inconsiderate" athletes are often little more than 
innocent victims of the craze that has turned into a multimillion dollar 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Sorry folks, but, contrary to popular opinion, the players are not the ones who 
establish going rates at these autograph extravaganzas. And if you run into one 
of your heroes in public, he's not going to ask for $5 or $10 to sign a ball, 
card or picture. He might not sign (especially in the middle of the main 
course), but it won't be because you don't have the cash in your hand. 
</P>
<P>
It's still possible your idol is of the clay variety and might try to protect 
his market value. But even if he's that sinister, you have to go step by step 
to the bottom line to find all the culprits. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, you get to the consumer, and that's where you stop. In this case, 
for the most part, that translates to collectors, the most serious of which 
become investors in a market that sometimes pays off better than blue-chip 
utilities. 
</P>
<P>
Consider this one: About two months ago an individual spent $30,000 for 40,000 
1989 cards bearing the picture and vital information of Milwaukee's Gary 
Sheffield. Quick math reveals that works out to 75 cents apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Because a player's rookie card is considered the most desirable throughout his 
career (because it becomes increasingly more difficult to find), this 
speculator was gambling that the Brewers' infielder would enhance the value by 
winning the American League Rookie of the Year award. He is considered the 
preseason favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Since that time, half of the Sheffield cards reportedly have been sold at 
prices ranging from $1.35 to $2.50. That translates to a return of at least 
$27,000 on the investment -- with half of the inventory still outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
The purchaser? A high school junior in Scarsdale, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
With staggering amounts of dollars to be made in the collector market, it was 
only a matter of time before others went after a piece of the action. Enter 
promoters, agents and, ultimately, the players themselves. 
</P>
<P>
When the memorabilia-autograph shows -- like the ones held in Atlantic City and 
New Carrollton, Md., during the winter -- are put together, somebody takes a 
risk, everybody pays and the players walk away with hefty appearance fees. 
</P>
<P>
But the accepted notion that players set a price for their autograph, sit at a 
table next to a cash register and put the autograph fee in their pocket is the 
biggest misconception of this fad-turned-scam, which may be on the brink of 
pricing itself out of business. Minnesota outfielder Kirby Puckett, for one, 
has said he will no longer do shows because of the negative reaction and the 
carnival-like "hustle" that is involved. 
</P>
<P>
Autograph fees are determined by two things -- how "hot" the player is, and how 
much it costs (fee, plus travel expenses) to get him there. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks Robinson, who has probably signed more autographs than any man alive, 
has profited from many appearances. But he says the market is close to being 
glutted. 
</P>
<P>
"I do about 30 (shows) a year, but if I had the time I could probably do 200," 
Robinson said. "It's gotten to the point where there's just too many of them 
now. I've been to shows where promoters have lost their shirt. A lot of time it 
(success of a show) depends on who is there, how hot he is, how much it costs 
to get him -- and how recently he may have done a show in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a no-win situation for the players, but they have no alternative 
other than to look at it as a business. That's what it is -- and it's a big 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"I do my charity work here at home (Baltimore)," said Robinson, "but there's no 
way I'm going to Cleveland, or Wheeling or even New Carrollton without getting 
paid. 
</P>
<P>
"The people that go to those shows know what they're getting into; nobody goes 
there expecting to get anything for free. They go to buy, sell and get 
autographs and 99 out of 100 go away feeling good. 
</P>
<P>
"Every once in a while somebody will say this (paying for an autograph) is 
ridiculous, but when they go they know who's going to be there. They have to 
buy a ticket to get in, usually $3 or $5, and that entitles them to one 
autograph. They pay for everything else." 
</P>
<P>
Believe it or not, one of the considerations before booking an athlete is how 
many times he can sign his name in an hour. "When they ask me that, I tell 
them, 'More than anybody else -- and I can have a good time doing it,' " 
Robinson said. "That's what some of these guys (players) don't understand. The 
key is to enjoy yourself." 
</P>
<P>
That's not always easy, according to Jay Finglass, owner of Jay's Sports 
Connection in Towson, Md. Finglass has promoted a few small-scale shows locally 
and attended countless others. 
</P>
<P>
"The promoters are not interested in you talking -- only how many autographs 
you sign in an hour," Finglass said. "Time spent talking is money out of their 
pocket." 
</P>
<P>
Finglass agrees that the players get too much of the blame for the 
pay-per-autograph sessions, but he also points out that exorbitant appearance 
fees can drive up the price considerably. That's where the agents come in 
because, in virtually every instance, bookings are made directly with the 
representative, who has a clue as to what his client is worth in the 
off-season. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these guys, before they reach the really big dollar state, can make 
more money in the off-season than they do by their salary," Finglass said. "But 
it's not fair to put all of the blame on the player. It's the system. 
</P>
<P>
"People willing to pay for autographs, promoters who can take a huge financial 
risk while looking for a profit, and excessive appearance fees all combine to 
drive the prices up." 
</P>
<P>
How much is a player's appearance worth? As much as a promoter is willing to 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
How much is an autograph worth? As much as a collector is willing to pay. 
</P>
<P>
"A player like Brooks, for instance, his signature, especially around here, 
isn't worth as much because he's signed so many autographs over the years," 
Finglass said. "The promoter of the show in New Carrollton lost a bundle. He 
paid Jose Canseco about $15,000, Pete Rose $12,000 and Fred Lynn $10,000. The 
price for Canseco's autograph (one of the hottest on the market) was $14 and he 
signed about 500, which was a lot more than either Rose or Lynn. 
</P>
<P>
"You can price yourself out of business, and it's getting to the point where 
the risk is much greater than the reward." 
</P>
<P>
So much so, Finglass believes, that the number of shows is going to start to 
dwindle. When that happens, the prices also will drop because it is a case of 
supply and demand. 
</P>
<P>
But players aren't stupid. If somebody is going to make money from an 
autograph, the signee is going to get his share. They know there is a market to 
be nourished and, for that reason, some players aren't as willing to sign a 
baseball card in a happenstance situation. There have always been those who 
don't sign autographs on their time. 
</P>
<P>
And there are other considerations besides the money. In Anaheim, Calif., for 
instance, there is one autograph hound who has been around the hotel lobby so 
long he could be showing up with his offspring any season. In New York, it is 
not uncommon for autograph seekers, young and old, to catch players as they 
board the team bus, then make it to Yankee Stadium in time to greet them when 
they arrive -- and then duplicate the procedure after the game. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where the player gets bad-rapped, when they try to get away from it in 
public -- but there are ways to handle that," said Robinson. "Now, though, it 
really is a no-win situation for the players." 
</P>
<P>
It might improve, but it's unrealistic to believe that collecting autographs 
will ever again be a means of fulfilling a youthful fantasy. Those days are 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
You can blame the players if you want, but don't forget the rest of the system 
that includes agents, promoters and -- most important of all -- the collectors.

LAKERS COME TOGETHER FOR 138-98 WIN OVER SPURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Conveniently for the Lakers, the San Antonio Spurs were on the docket Thursday 
night in the Forum, which all but assured a reversal of play two days after 
Coach Pat Riley's well-calculated tantrum at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Riley had not harshly criticized his players after Tuesday's 23-point 
loss to the Suns and not held a two-hour team meeting Wednesday, the Lakers 
probably still would have crushed the Spurs. But there seemed to be an urgency 
to the Lakers' 138-98 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Quality of competition has to be considered in evaluating this one. The Spurs, 
3-34 on the road, can tie a franchise record for most road losses tonight in a 
game at the Sports Arena against the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt, there would be more suspense against the Clippers than there was 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers had no mercy on the Spurs, taking a big lead lead and expanding it 
to 47 points at one point in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to start playing well tonight," said Byron Scott, who tied his 
season-high in scoring with 35 points. "San Antonio just happened to be the 
team. It didn't matter who we played. It was one of those games where we felt 
we had to be the initiator. Hopefully, this can continue." 
</P>
<P>
Seriously challenged in a race for the Pacific Division title for only the 
second time this decade, the Lakers (48-21) needed the victory. Combined with 
Phoenix's loss to Sacramento, the Lakers took a four-game lead over the 
second-place Suns. 
</P>
<P>
The Spurs probably could have seen this coming, had they known how upset Riley 
had been after the loss to the Suns. 
</P>
<P>
Riley could not be anything other than pleased after a 40-point victory, and he 
tried to tone down the severity of the comments he made after the Phoenix loss. 
</P>
<P>
"As much as I may accuse them at times of not playing hard, of not being 
commited and wondering about their pride, I know they have all of that," Riley 
said. "It is something of a collective desire. Sometimes, we lose that." 
</P>
<P>
That desire had been misplaced in the previous seven games but, after the 
two-hour team meeting, it was found -- at least for a night. 
</P>
<P>
"We meet all the time," Riley said, laughing. "This one just happened to last 
two hours. Actually, we went to practice (Wednesday) and Seton Hall was there 
and kicked us out. But sometimes you need (a meeting). 
</P>
<P>
"That's the thing with group dynamics. You have to control your collective 
(attitude). We did that, and tonight might be the start of something. We'll 
just have to walk, not talk, from now on." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the Lakers didn't walk over the Spurs (19-51). They stamped on them. 
Hard. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had some bad ones," Spur Coach Larry Brown said. "This one is way up on 
the list. This one had to be one of our quickest (blowout losses)." 
</P>
<P>
Consistency is what Riley had been looking for, and he received it. Scott made 
14 of 23 shots, including two three-point baskets, and scored 35 points. A.C. 
Green had 22 points, Orlando Woolridge 15, James Worthy 14 and Tony Campbell 
10. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson, seemingly making little more than a cameo appearance, had eight 
points, nine rebounds and 10 assists. He and the Lakers survived an early 
scare, twisting his left ankle in the first half. Johnson continued, and 
trainer Gary Vitti later said it could not even be called a sprain. 
</P>
<P>
The Spurs, however, are limping badly these days. Even with David Robinson 
scheduled to join the team next season after he completes obligations with the 
Navy, the Spurs may not be much better. 
</P>
<P>
Things are so bad that Brown reminisced about this time last season, when he 
coached the Kansas to the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. title. 
</P>
<P>
"At a time like this, with the Final Four going on and me being in Los Angeles, 
yeah," Brown said. "I wouldn't wish this (another Spur blowout loss) on anyone 
tonight. I look out on the court and know we have a lot of deficiencies. But 
tonight . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, the Spurs were particularly bad. 
</P>
<P>
After Spur center Mike Smrek gave the Spurs a 1-0 lead 14 seconds into the 
game, the Lakers dominated and did not let up until they had 79-45 halftime 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very tough to play the Lakers after they just came off a loss," said the 
Spurs' Willie Anderson, who scored 17 points. "We learned that tonight." 
</P>
<P>
The 79-point first half was the Lakers' most productive half this season, 
eclipsing the 77 points they scored against the Philadelphia 76ers on Dec. 28 
at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
At least in December, the Lakers had some real competition. It took the Lakers 
less than three minutes to build a 10-point lead Thursday night, and the 
advantage increased to 18 entering the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Laker inspiration did not fade even though they had the game in hand after 
making 66.7% of their shots in the first quarter. In fact, the Lakers seemed 
even more determined to bury the Spurs in the second quarter, which they did 
with an early 16-2 run that gave them a 61-32 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' biggest first-half lead was 34 points, as the final six minutes of 
the half was transformed into the sloppy style that usually is only seen in the 
final minutes of lopsided games. 
</P>
<P>
That style continued in the second half, when the Lakers' lead rarely dipped 
below 40. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great meeting; it helped," Johnson said. "A lot of things had to come 
out, and they did. People had to express opinions, and they did. We also played 
better together. We felt we had to move the ball on offense more, instead of 
just moving bodies." 
</P>
<P>
It is one thing to dominate the lowly Spurs, quite another to do so against a 
team with playoff aspirations. A more accurate test will come Saturday, when 
the Lakers play at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers are quite aware of that, but they didn't mind Thursday's result. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels good tonight, but we have to move on," Johnson said. "One game 
doesn't tell you anything." 
</P>
<P>
As for the Spurs, well, it was more than just another big loss. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a long game," Brown said. "I'm glad it's over. I feel sorry for the 
people who had to sit through it." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mychal Thompson will miss the next two games, Saturday in Denver and Sunday at 
home against Milwaukee, because of an illness in his family. The Lakers said 
Thompson will fly to Miami to be with his family tonight. . . . In addition to 
Magic Johnson's twisted ankle, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar also had a twisted ankle 
Thursday night. Trainer Gary Vitti said he is not hurt.

ANGEL PITCHERS MASTERFUL AS DODGERS FALL IN 11, 3-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON EDES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taking her cue from "Les Miserables," Dodger Stadium organist Nancy Hefley 
serenaded Orel Hershiser on Thursday night with a rendition of "Master of the 
House," which was his signature tune during a show-stopping October. 
</P>
<P>
Upstaging Hershiser, however, in the opener of the Freeway Series was Angel 
pitcher Mike Witt -- who warmed up for his Opening Day assignment with seven 
innings of no-hit ball -- and three relievers, Bob McClure, Bryan Harvey, and 
Greg Minton, who extended the no-hitter through 10 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Mariano Duncan finally broke up the no-hitter with a one-out single in the 11th 
off Willie Fraser, the fifth Angel pitcher, and Jose Gonzalez followed with an 
RBI single. 
</P>
<P>
But Duncan's throwing error led to two unearned runs in the top of the 11th to 
give the Angels a 3-2 victory before a crowd of 34,434. Wally Joyner's 
ground-rule double off Tim Crews scored one run and Jim Eppard's sacrifice fly 
brought home the other. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda announced that Tim Belcher -- not 
Hershiser -- will pitch the Dodgers' regular-season opener in Cincinnati 
Monday. Hershiser, who had not pitched in eight days because of the flu, will 
pitch the second game against the Reds Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt fine," Hershiser said, "but they don't want to rush me. I haven't had a 
chance to work out. I haven't even lifted a weight. They want me to get back 
into my program. 
</P>
<P>
"I threw the ball adequately, but I didn't throw unbelievable. I threw most of 
my pitches where I wanted to. Opening Day is exciting because it's the first 
game, but after that it's just a win or a loss." 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda was ejected in the 11th for airing out umpires Mark Johnson and Derryl 
Cousins. Lasorda, considerably more animated than the Dodger offense, found 
fault with Cousins, the first base umpire, making the call on whether Devon 
White's line drive was caught or trapped by left fielder Chris Gwynn, 
overruling Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn played the ball on the short hop, Dick Schofield -- who reached base on 
Duncan's throwing error -- took second, and scored on Joyner's double that 
bounced over the wall in left-center. Eppard followed with a sacrifice fly off 
Crews, who took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
Witt, scheduled to start against the Chicago White Sox Tuesday in Anaheim, 
retired 16 Dodgers in a row after walking Eddie Murray with two out in the 
first. The right-hander ran into control problems at the start of the seventh, 
walking Kirk Gibson on four pitches, then passing Murray again. 
</P>
<P>
After a force out, John Shelby's sacrifice fly scored Gibson to tie the score, 
and Witt departed for a pinch-hitter in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
"I could've been a little sharper in the seventh," Witt said, "but I'm pleased 
with how it went. I don't think fatigue was a problem, I was just anxious to 
get it over with. I just got ahead of myself." 
</P>
<P>
Duncan, who started the game as a fill-in for Willie Randolph at second base, 
came closest to getting a hit with a sinking line drive to right to open the 
bottom of the first. Claudell Washington appeared to lose the ball in the 
lights but was charged with a two-base error after failing in an attempt to 
backhand the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Randolph, whose wife, Gretchen, underwent an emergency appendectomy Tuesday in 
Vero Beach, remained in Florida and will join the team in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Murray, making his Dodger Stadium debut, hit a rocket into the gap in 
left-center in the fourth, but Devon White caught it at the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Witt, who walked three and struck out three, breezed against the 
team averaging 5.9 runs a game with a batting average of .303. 
</P>
<P>
McClure, a left-hander, extended the no-hitter through eight innings by setting 
down Mike Scioscia, Chris Gwynn and Duncan, then gave way to short man Harvey, 
who blew away Alfredo Griffin, Jose Gonzalez and Franklin Stubbs on strikes in 
the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Minton pitched the 10th and retired Mickey Hatcher on a soft one-hopper to 
short, struck out Mike Davis and put away Tracy Woodson on a fly ball to left. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser dispatched the first six Angels to face him, but struggled through 
his last two innings. 
</P>
<P>
In the third, the Angels got singles from Lance Parrish and Dick Schofield, but 
Gibson ran down Jack Howell's drive to the track in left and Marshall caught up 
with Johnny Ray's shot in right. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth, White singled, stole second, took third on an infield out and 
scored on a sacrifice fly by Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Belcher gave up one hit -- Schofield's fifth-inning triple -- in three innings. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson, playing only his fourth spring game, received a standing ovation but 
raised his bat overhead in frustration after striking out in the first. He also 
flied out and walked before leaving after seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda said he still doesn't know if Gibson will play Monday, but his knee 
certainly appeared fine on Howell's fly ball. 
</P>
<P>
"He can't get into a game where he doesn't play full out," Hershiser said. "He 
gets involved in some sort of tough play that tests him."

INKSTER OVERCOMES HEAT TO LEAD BY TWO

<P>
Juli Inkster said she had been struggling on the LPGA tour this year coming 
into the Nabisco Dinah Shore tournament. 
</P>
<P>
She revived, though, on Thursday, despite the 96-degree temperature, to take 
the first-round lead with a six-under-par 66 at Mission Hills Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really tired out there," Inkster said of the heat, "but it's amazing how 
much energy you have when you are under par." 
</P>
<P>
Inkster, 28, who won the Dinah Shore tournament in 1984, said she likes the 
layout of the course. 
</P>
<P>
That was obvious. Starting with a 40-footer on No. 1, she birdied seven of the 
first 12 holes. Her only bogey came on the par-five, 526-yard 18th hole. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Eggeling finished with a flurry -- with birdies on the last two holes -- 
to shoot a 68 for second place. 
</P>
<P>
Four players -- Beth Daniel, Lori Garbacz, Jody Rosenthal and Sweden's 
Liselotte Neumann -- were tied for third with three-under-par 69s. 
</P>
<P>
Any Alcott, the defending champion, had a 71, having missed two putts of fewer 
than two feet. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Bradley, who is making a comeback after suffering from hyperthyroidism, 
shot a 70 and Nancy Lopez is six strokes behind the leader after a 72. 
</P>
<P>
Inkster, who won three tournaments last year and finished in the top 10 in 
every statistical category, said her putter had betrayed her in previous 
tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Her best finish in five events was a tie for 19th in the Women's Kemper Open at 
Hawaii in February. 
</P>
<P>
Inkster missed only two greens, the ninth and 18th, in her splendid round. Of 
her seven birdie putts, three were from 20 to 25 feet. 
</P>
<P>
She said that she gets motivated for the Dinah Shore tournament because it has 
a certain aura. 
</P>
<P>
"It definitely has a major atmosphere," said Inkster, who lives in Los Altos, 
Calif. "This tournament and the U.S. Open are the biggest, prestige-wise." 
</P>
<P>
Daniel and Garbacz weren't particularly enthused about their rounds of 69. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a funny type of round," Daniel said. "It wasn't one I'd look back on 
and (know) I shot a 69. I won't remember it for very long as being spectacular. 
I didn't hit any shots that were great. I just sort of was there and made some 
birdies." 
</P>
<P>
Garbacz, a 10-year veteran who got her first tour victory two weeks ago at 
Tucson, was even more disdainful of her round. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of the ugliest 69s I have ever seen," she said. "I can't wait for 
this week to be over because my ball-striking really smells. I can't explain 
the 69. It could have been a 76." 
</P>
<P>
Neumann, who was the rookie of the year in 1988 and the U.S. Open women's 
champion, did not downgrade her 69. 
</P>
<P>
"I just tried to stay patient," she said. "Just hit the fairways and make some 
pars." 
</P>
<P>
Daniel is suffering from a viral infection, but she's relieved that her 
condition isn't as bad as she feared. She missed 13 weeks of the tour last year 
while suffering from mononucleosis. 
</P>
<P>
"Last Thursday night, I woke up freezing," she said. "It was exactly one year 
from the date that I had been diagnosed as having mono." 
</P>
<P>
Daniel, who has finished second twice this year in six events, said she is 
running a fever but it has subsided from a temperature of 102 last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
My glands and gums are swollen and I'm having a hard time eating," she said. 
"Don't write how thin I am. It's not my fault." 
</P>
<P>
Daniel said she was feeling weak the last two holes, adding that the sun was 
draining her. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not at full strength, but I'm hitting the ball well despite it, although 
I'm a little weak with the driver. 
</P>
<P>
"I watched this tournament on TV last year when I was in bed, and it was 
murder." 
</P>
<P>
Garbacz said that she and the Mission Hills course are like oil and water. 
</P>
<P>
"We just don't mix," she said. "However, I'm stubborn and I'm going to find a 
way to play the course." 
</P>
<P>
The heat was something that the women had to contend with, along with the 
pressure of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"We stayed quite a bit in the shade," Eggeling said, "and we made sure we had 
plenty of water. The last time I shot a 68 in the first round was in 1980 in a 
tournament in Boston." 
</P>
<P>
Said Alcott: "It was very hot out there. You had to be conscious of what you 
were doing. I used towels and handkerchiefs, wet ones, over my head." 
</P>
<P>
As for Bradley, a 15-year tour veteran, she is just happy to be playing -- and 
in reasonably good health. 
</P>
<P>
"My health is on its way back to normal," said Bradley, who played in a 
prestigious threesome with Alcott and Lopez. "Mrs. Bush (the President's wife) 
was just diagnosed with the same disease, Graves' disease. It's a unique 
illness that is hard to detect. 
</P>
<P>
"It's incredible the number of people who have the same problem, and they give 
me a lot of encouragement." 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
Muffin Spencer-Devlin made a hole-in-one on the par-five, 160-yard fifth hole. 
She used a six-iron. . . . A record Thursday crowd of 10,564 watched the 
opening of the $500,000 tournament.

CASEY'S CASE; 
</P>
<P>
CLIPPER COACH SAYS HE'D LIKE TO BE AROUND WHEN TEAM'S YOUNG PLAYERS MATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don Casey took the microphone. Some of the Clipper season-ticket holders 
sitting in the upper level of the Sports Arena applauded politely. 
</P>
<P>
Casey grinned, and there haven't been too many of those this season. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time I did this, two dinner rolls were thrown at me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So it was a hard-baked Casey who addressed some of the Clipper faithful in a 
question and answer session before a recent game against the Dallas Mavericks. 
He thought about what it would take for the Clippers to get a victory, and 
there haven't been too many of those, either, this season. 
</P>
<P>
As Casey said: "The reality is, this is a tough, tough league." 
</P>
<P>
Once again this season, another strong dose of Clipper reality has set in. What 
could have better prepared Casey to be the Clippers' sixth coach in 10 years 
than to be an assistant to three other coaches since 1985? 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Casey once coached a team in Italy, so he has seen ruins before. 
</P>
<P>
Casey inherited the Clipper coaching job when Gene Shue was deemed a fallen 
arch. Since then, with Casey at the bat, the Clippers have continued to limp 
along. And although it's probably no fault of his, Casey may be blamed. 
</P>
<P>
But first, a warning to some of those who might wish to succeed him: 
</P>
<P>
"All the college coaches who are begging to get in here, they don't have a 
clue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That said, Casey still does not have a contract after this season, but he has 
asked that his coaching status be decided before every Jim (Valvano), Slick 
(Watts) and Larry (Brown), or whomever is rumored coming this way, gets the 
word first. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers have a lot of decisions to make, not the least of which being 
whether to keep the man chosen the worst-dressed coach in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Casey finished in a last-place tie for worst-dressed coach with 
someone who thinks a lapel is what's on a beer bottle. That would be Denver's 
Doug Moe, whose selection of neckwear is always a last-place tie. 
</P>
<P>
When he was chosen, Casey joked about the person who selected him. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw that guy once," Casey said. "With that white shirt, I thought he was 
going to see 'Hee-Haw.' " 
</P>
<P>
Humor probably helps. In any event, Casey deserves to come back if for no other 
reason than his slightly rumpled look closely matches the team he is coaching. 
</P>
<P>
Yet with or without Casey, the Clippers have got some thinking to do, which is 
always dangerous. A few of the questions from the season-ticket holders 
reflected the critical Clipper choices. Casey had his answers ready. 
</P>
<P>
What should the Clippers do with their draft lottery choice? 
</P>
<P>
"We should trade it, or shop it," Casey replied. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
"How many grandchildren do you want to have?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Norm Nixon's retirement lowered the average Clipper age to 23.7 years. By 
remarkable coincidence, that's also the number of victories that the Clippers 
have surpassed only four times in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
This is the problem in committing to youth, Casey said. If that is the policy, 
then stick with it and let the coach stay around for a while. 
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, every season you're going to have another coach talking to you 
guys," Casey told his audience. 
</P>
<P>
What about Benoit Benjamin? 
</P>
<P>
"He'll be back, he has to be, or we should already have traded him," Casey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers can keep Benjamin by matching whatever contract offer he might 
receive from another team. Even so, Casey says the clock is ticking for Big Ben 
as he struggles to become a consistent player. 
</P>
<P>
"The jury is still out," Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
Do the Clippers need someone to go to in the last two minutes? 
</P>
<P>
"A go-to guy, sure," said Casey, who telephoned John Nash, general manager of 
the Philadelphia 76ers, and floated a piece of trade speculation past him: The 
Clippers lottery pick and something else for Charles Barkley and something 
else. 
</P>
<P>
The reaction? "Well, it wasn't a turnoff," Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, someone with a fear of turnoffs or hangups shouldn't be coaching this 
team anyway. It's part of a job in which there are built-in problems. 
</P>
<P>
"This team is like having teen-aged children," Casey said. "One moment they're 
great, the next moment they come home with a wrecked car and the next moment 
they're fine again." 
</P>
<P>
With that, he was off. He had a team to coach. Disgusted with their practice, 
Casey had not spoken to the players all day. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any idea how they will react," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers went out and beat the Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
Win or lose, Casey will work hard, as always, for the next game and the one 
after that. In the land of the Clippers, the day is still young. It's just the 
coach who gets old in a hurry.

AFTER A YEAR AWAY, GARZA SCORES QUICK KO OF ALONSO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jaime Garza took off a year and four days between fights. 
</P>
<P>
And when he finally decided to return to the ring, the former World Boxing 
Council super-bantamweight champion couldn't get down to the required 130 
pounds for his 10-round bout against Rocky Alonso Thursday night at the 
Hollywood Palladium. 
</P>
<P>
For that, Garza was fined $500 of his $2,500 purse by the State Athletic 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, it was all worth the weight. 
</P>
<P>
Garza, displaying the sharpness he exhibited as a WBC champion five years ago, 
knocked out Alonso 2:57 into the first round Thursday night to the cheers of a 
crowd of about 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Garza, 29, scored early and often in the round with a stinging jab. Alonso's 
only effective punch was a right hand midway through the round. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the closing seconds, Garza caught Alonso with a left, then a straight 
right that caused the Bakersfield fighter's legs to wobble. 
</P>
<P>
"I had planned to pace myself," Garza (48-4 with 44 knockouts) said, "because I 
didn't want to look sloppy. 
</P>
<P>
"But when I got him hurt, I didn't want to waste any time." 
</P>
<P>
Nor did he. Garza moved in and floored Alonso with an overhand left. 
</P>
<P>
Alonso, who weighed in at 129, tried to struggle to his feet as referee Lou 
Filippo counted over him. But by the time Filippo had reached 10, Alonso 
(33-24-1) was still on his knees. 
</P>
<P>
That's where most of Garza's early opponents wound up. He won his first 40 
fights, 38 by knockout, along with the WBC title by the age of 25. 
</P>
<P>
But Juan Meza then knocked him out in the first round of a 1984 fight in New 
York, and Garza has been trying to get back up ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Including the Meza fight, he was just 7-4 before Thursday night's bout. 
</P>
<P>
He had been knocked out in the fifth round of his last fight, a year ago at the 
Forum, by Marcos Villasana. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the former Pacoima resident went home to his family ranch in Texas with 
thoughts of perhaps opening a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Garza broke with long-time manager Benny Georgino. The contract between the two 
is currently in arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Harry Kazandjian and trainer Pat Goossen talked Garza into a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt strong," Garza said. "but if I have to fight at 135 pounds, that's what 
I'll do."

KNICKS HAND MAVERICKS 12TH CONSECUTIVE LOSS, 99-98 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Patrick Ewing scored 26 points, including two free throws with 2:11 left, to 
lead the New York Knicks past the Dallas Mavericks, 99-98, Thursday night at 
New York, the Mavericks' 12th consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks tied the score four times in the fourth quarter before taking their 
first lead, 94-93, on a three-point basket by Mark Jackson with 3:28 left. 
</P>
<P>
After a free throw by Dallas' Adrian Dantley made it 94-94, Ewing's two free 
throws put the Knicks ahead to stay. Sam Perkins, who led the Mavericks with 21 
points, then missed a pair of free throws with 1:49 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
A basket by Charles Oakley and another free throw by Ewing gave New York a 
99-94 lead, but a three-pointer by Perkins narrowed the margin to two with 1:04 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Perkins converted one of two free throws with 32 seconds left to make it 99-98. 
Jackson missed two free throws with five seconds left, but the clock ran out 
after Dallas failed to get the rebound. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Walker hit nine of his first 10 shots and scored a season-high 19 points 
for New York. Rolando Blackman had 18 and Dantley 17 for the Mavericks, who are 
stuck in their longest losing streak since 1981. Dallas has lost every game 
since starting center James Donaldson injured his knee. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 109, New Jersey 101 -- The Rockets snapped a nine-game road losing 
streak as Akeem Olajuwon scored 29 points and grabbed 10 rebounds at East 
Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Houston, which has won three straight, used a 13-3 run late in the third 
quarter to turn a 65-64 deficit into a 77-68 lead it never surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State 113, Charlotte 104 -- Chris Mullin led a 15-2 run in the last 3:43 
of the third quarter as Golden State won at Charlotte, N.C., to snap a 
season-high four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Mullin hit a jumper and two free throws to ignite the run and added a 
three-point basket with one second left in the quarter to finish it. 
</P>
<P>
In between, rookie Mitch Richmond added a pair of free throws, Winston Garland 
two field goals and Rod Higgins a layup. 
</P>
<P>
Mullin had a game-high 36 points, and Richmond added 28 points and 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Kurt Rambis had a career-high 23 points for Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
Denver 123, Seattle 116 -- Michael Adams and Walter Davis, stymied during the 
first three quarters of the game at Denver, scored 14 of the Nuggets' first 18 
points in the fourth quarter to spark the victory. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Nuggets' 14th straight win at McNichols Arena, where they are 30-5 
overall. The SuperSonics suffered their ninth straight road loss. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle was within 92-91 early in the fourth quarter before a 10-0 run put the 
Nuggets in control. 
</P>
<P>
Adams, who missed all seven of his shots through the first three quarters, had 
three free throws and a three-point basket to begin the surge. He scored 13 of 
his 20 points in the last quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who had only two points heading into the fourth quarter, had four 
baskets in an 18-9 surge that opened the final period. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento 135, Phoenix 123 -- Brad Lohaus came off the bench to score 23 of 
his career-high 29 points in the second half as the Kings snapped a six-game 
losing streak to the Suns. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Chambers produced a game-high 35 points, including 14 in the fourth 
quarter, for Phoenix, which lost its sixth consecutive road game. Kevin Johnson 
tallied 22 points for the Suns.

NEWSWIRE: SANDERS TO TURN PRO NEXT SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Heisman Trophy winner Barry Sanders notified the National Football League 
Thursday that he is turning pro, setting up a possible test of the league's 
restrictions against drafting underclassmen. 
</P>
<P>
Although Sanders is not expected to comment before a news conference Saturday 
at Denver, Oklahoma State's probation for recruiting violations probably 
figured in his decision. The National Collegiate Athletic Assn. banned the 
university from bowl games for three years and from television appearances for 
two. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders' status with the NFL, however, is not clear. 
</P>
<P>
Myron Roderick, Oklahoma State athletic director, said it was his understanding 
that even if Sanders chose not to play in the NFL, that he could not return to 
play in college. 
</P>
<P>
A junior, Sanders is ineligible for either the regular or supplemental drafts 
without a special exemption from Commissioner Pete Rozelle. Rozelle has granted 
about six of those exemptions a year for the past 20 years, mostly to players 
who were never drafted. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, Rozelle has cited the possibility that if he turned down the 
request, the league's policy might be challenged in court. 
</P>
<P>
NFL sources, however, have indicated the league is more inclined to go to court 
now to test its rules against drafting underclassmen.

A Frenchman's effort to beat a month-old New York-to-San Francisco sailing 
record fell just a few hours short as a Phillippe Monnet steered his battered 
trimaran under the Golden Gate after 81 days and 14,000 miles at sea. 
</P>
<P>
Monnet, the 29-year-old seaman, lost his bid for the record after a series of 
setbacks, including a brush with a submerged iceberg off Cape Horn that cost 
him a week for repairs and a tussle with 18-foot seas and a capricious winds 
off the California coast. 
</P>
<P>
He needed to arrive by 7:34 a.m. PST Thursday to break the record set Feb. 12 
by the American sloop Thursday's Child, which took 80 days and 20 hours.

GIANT TUNA NOT BITING, SHARKS ARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Pete Thomas

<TEXT>
<P>
Long-range fishing trips in search of giant yellowfin tuna are in full swing, 
and thus far most of the trips have been memorable to say the least. 
</P>
<P>
That of the Polaris Supreme, which returned to San Diego last week from a 
16-day venture south, was no different. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw lots of cows (giant tuna), but they just weren't biting," said Mike 
Lettau, a crew member aboard the sportfisher. 
</P>
<P>
But apparently the sharks were. 
</P>
<P>
Houston resident David Billingsley, after hooking up with a giant tuna near the 
boat's stern, found out why his fight lasted only an hour: his 332-pound fish 
came up with about 40 pounds missing, courtesy of hungry sharks. "It was a 
bunch of small bites," Lettau said. 
</P>
<P>
Earl King fought his fish for 2 1/2 hours before crew members, looking down 75 
feet into the clear blue water, saw a large shark take one big chunk out of the 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
The fight ended immediately and King brought up a 336.8-pound tuna that Lettau 
said lost about 10 pounds to the shark. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the 18 anglers fishing Clarion Island, part of the Revillagigedo chain, 
caught just 80 yellowfin, but were kept busy with a tremendous wahoo bite, 
catching 270 of the slender but powerful game fish. "We were catching 40 or 50 
a day, every day," Lettau said. 
</P>
<P>
Entries are still being accepted for this weekend's Santa Monica Bay Halibut 
Derby, proceeds of which go to the Boys' Club of Santa Monica and the DFG-Los 
Angeles County Museum of Natural History Halibut Hatchery Project, which is 
working toward the release of thousands of hatchery-raised halibut into local 
waters. Information: (213) 450-5131. 
</P>
<P>
Saltwater fishermen tagged and released 124 of the estimated 642 striped marlin 
caught off the Southern California coast in 1988, according to recently 
released figures. An average of 800 striped marlin are caught in local waters 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
Parts of two rivers in Eastern California would be taken into the state's wild 
and scenic river system under a bill introduced earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, authored by Assemblyman Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto), chairman of the 
Assembly Natural Resources Committee, also would ban dams and hydroelectric 
power stations on a third river in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Sher's bill seeks wild and scenic status under state law for 10-mile segment of 
the east fork of the Carson River in Alpine County, and 38 miles of the West 
Walker River in Mono County. 
</P>
<P>
The bill also would forbid development along 53 miles of the McCloud River and 
one of its tributaries -- Squaw Valley Creek -- in Shasta and Lassen counties. 
The McCloud is a tributary of the Sacramento River. 
</P>
<P>
Five rivers were granted wild and scenic status by the state in 1972 under 
legislation signed by Ronald Reagan, the governor at the time. They are parts 
of the Eel, Klamath, Smith and Trinity rivers in Northwest California, and a 
22-mile segment of the lower American River near Sacramento. The five later 
were incorporated into the federal system during the Carter administration. 
</P>
<P>
Segments of four other rivers since have won wild and scenic status under 
federal law, but are not state-protected. 
</P>
<P>
They are the Tuolumne, Kern, Kings and Merced rivers. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly 
</P>
<P>
DFG director Pete Bontadelli has been named winner of the 1988 Golden Trout 
Award by California Trout Inc. for being "the public official who has made the 
most distinguished and significant contribution toward the protection and 
improvement of wild trout, native steelhead and the waters that nurture them." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's 9th annual Day at the Docks, the West Coast's largest sportfishing 
industry get-together, attended by 35,000 last year, will run April 22-23 at 
H&amp;M, Point Loma and Fisherman's landings. 
</P>
<P>
Medical emergencies at sea will be the topic of discussion by Dr. Robert M. 
Kahn and the Assn. of Santa Monica Bay Yacht Clubs, with support from the Santa 
Monica Hospital Medical Center and Nethercutt Emergency Center and Sea Tek, a 
San Pedro powerboat rigging company. Program begins at 7 p.m. April 4 at King 
Harbor Yacht Club and April 11 at Del Rey Yacht Club in Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
The DFG is offering a 73-page Guide to Artificial Reefs of Southern California, 
illustrating location, topography and marine resources living among the 22 
artificial reefs from Central California to San Diego County. Cost is $3 if 
bought at DFG's Long Beach office and $4 if purchased through mail: DFG Marine 
Division-K.M., 330 Golden Shore, Suite 50, Long Beach, Calif., 90802. 
</P>
<P>
A DFG census of bighorn sheep in the San Gabriel Mountains show the population 
to be healthy and stable, with 295 animals counted over a two-day period. An 
estimated 500-700 animals reside in the area, according to biologist Tom 
Paulek. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Marine Assn. is holding its first-ever boat show, featuring 
more than 200 boats in the water and on shore, April 20-23 at Channel Islands 
Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Fishing information: 976-TUNA, the fishing information phone line, has expanded 
to include fresh water and Salton Sea reports, which will be updated every 
Monday, Wednesday and Friday. . . . A seven-week ocean fishing class, taught by

AS GRIFFEY JR. STARTS OUT IN SEATTLE, GRIFFEY SR. HANGS ON IN CINCINNATI

<P>
For the first time in major league baseball history, a father and son will be 
playing at the same time this season. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Griffey Jr., 19-year-old son of veteran major leaguer Ken Griffey Sr., will 
be the Seattle Mariners' starting center fielder this season, Manager Jim 
Lefebvre said. 
</P>
<P>
"He won the job," Lefebvre said. "He deserves it." 
</P>
<P>
Griffey's father, 39, is back with the Cincinnati Reds, with whom he played in 
the 1970s and the last two months of the 1988 season. The Reds signed Griffey 
to a one-year contract Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Lefebvre called Griffey into his office in Tempe on Wednesday and told him he'd 
made the big leagues. "I told him that this was the most difficult decision a 
manager has to make," Lefebvre said. "I told him that I had talked to the 
coaches, and we had taken a lot of things into consideration. Then I told him 
he had made the team . . . that he was my starting center fielder." 
</P>
<P>
Griffey made the jump from double-A to the major leagues with a sensational 
spring. He was elated at the news from Lefebvre. "Those probably are the best 
words I've ever heard . . . at least in the top three," Griffey said.

CHATSWORTH WARMS TO THE TASK IN ROUT OF RIVAL TAFT, 10-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE GLAZE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In every athletic contest, there is the warm-up, the heat of the competition 
and the cool-down. But in the case of the Chatsworth High baseball team, the 
warm-up period lasted four innings during Thursday's game against West Valley 
League rival Taft. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth, mired in a 1-1 tie until the fifth, racked up eight hits and scored 
nine runs in the last three innings to cool off the host Toreadors, 10-1, in a 
game that gave the Chancellors (9-2 overall, 6-0 in league play) sole 
possession of first place. 
</P>
<P>
"They are explosive," Taft Coach Rich McKeon said. "They have at least, I'm 
sure, four Division I players. There's a couple of guys that may even be 
drafted." 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth exploded in the fifth, sending nine batters to the plate and scoring 
four runs on three hits to take a 5-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Chong walked to lead off the inning and with one out Rich Aude also 
walked. A single by Eric Johnson loaded the bases and Derek Wallace followed 
with a ground-rule double off the scoreboard in right field to score Chong and 
Aude. Johnson scored and Wallace went to third on Vince Simili's sacrifice fly 
to right and Chatsworth led, 4-1. Reed McMackin drove in Wallace with a 
ground-ball single up the middle for the final run of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Chong and Aude again walked in the sixth and scored on Johnson's double down 
the third-base line. Simili drove in Johnson with a double to increase the lead 
to 8-1. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth, ranked third in The Times Valley Poll, added two more runs in the 
seventh to account for the final score. 
</P>
<P>
The Toreadors (7-4, 4-2) scored their only run with two out in the first when 
Glenn Nahmias tagged McMackin's three-and-two pitch over the right-field fence 
for a home run and a 1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"After that first inning, I thought we were going to light them up all game, 
but we didn't," McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
McMackin (4-0), a junior right-hander, gave up two hits in the first but 
allowed only one the rest of the game and struck out five. 
</P>
<P>
"Reed's come a long way," Chatsworth Coach Bob Lofrano said. "He's really a 
bulldog type on the mound and he'll really challenge the hitters by keeping the 
ball in the strike zone." 
</P>
<P>
The Chancellors tied the score, 1-1, in the third when Jason Evans hit a 
two-out triple to center and scored on a single by Aude.

CARSON BASEBALL TEAM FLASHES PLATE POWER AND SURPRISES SAN PEDRO, 9-7 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Greeting home-run hitters as they trot by his third-base coaching box is a new 
experience for Carson High Coach Marty Blankenship. 
</P>
<P>
He enjoyed the pleasure twice in the Colts' 9-7 victory over visiting San Pedro 
High on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised when we hit a home run," said Blankenship. "We turned the tables 
around today. Usually it is San Pedro who is hitting them out." 
</P>
<P>
The victory was Carson's second straight over its Pacific League rival. 
</P>
<P>
They have 3-3 league marks, trailing only Banning. Clearing the fence twice to 
cap Carson's sweep was third baseman Steve Rubio. 
</P>
<P>
The first time was a two-run blast to left-center in the third that gave Carson 
a 3-2 lead. Rubio's second four-bagger came during a Colt uprising in the 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon James opened the inning off San Pedro pitcher Gerardo Castaneda with a 
triple. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Alfredo Rodriguez followed with a ground single to left through the 
drawn-in infield. 
</P>
<P>
Next came Rubio's towering drive near the same 416-foot sign he had cleared 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Carson tallied three more runs in the fifth off an obviously shaken Castaneda 
to take a 9-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates came back in the sixth to score five runs, all unearned, following 
a Rubio error. Two-out singles by Joe Boncich and Matt Rasband cut the Colt led 
to two before Rodriguez got Dale Johnson to ground out. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a .432 hitter, was hitless in four tries. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro put the tying runs on in the seventh with one out, but Rodriguez 
closed out the game with a flair by striking out Brian Schiazzano.

<P>
SHORE ANGLERS GETTING MORE DISTANCE AND BIGGER CATCHES WITH FLOAT TUBES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dan Stanton 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shore fishermen have always been limited by the distance a line can be cast 
into the surf. 
</P>
<P>
Anglers who head out beyond shore use float tubes with success, and two South 
Bay tubers have set some records. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Wight, 29, of Torrance attaches his float tube and arms himself with a 
light rod, small reel and bag of bait. 
</P>
<P>
For six years Wight has ventured 100 yards or more beyond the waves to fish for 
halibut during the fall and winter. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, fishing off Torrance Beach using a jack smelt for bait, he hooked 
a halibut that pulled him a quarter-mile out to sea. Using his swim fins as a 
rudder, he paddled backward over the waves and slowly brought his catch onto 
the beach. 
</P>
<P>
The flattie weighed in on the Marina del Rey scales at 32 1/2 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Wight holds two International Game Fish Assn. records. In 1986 he caught an 
eight-pound, 14-ounce halibut using two-pound test line. 
</P>
<P>
His strategy continued at Torrance Beach last year. Using four-pound test line 
he set another IGFA record with a 13-pound, 10-ounce halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Does the chance of hooking a great white shark while tube fishing concern him? 
He replied, "If I identified it as a white shark, the line would be cut and I 
would scurry back to shore." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Larson, 25, of San Pedro fishes from his float tube at Cabrillo Beach. He 
uses six-pound test line but prefers to use feathers and jigs instead of bait. 
</P>
<P>
Larson heads out from the Cabrillo rocks area as much as a mile when the ocean 
is calm. 
</P>
<P>
Using a red and white feather jig, he recently caught a 20-pound, 4-ounce 
halibut. 
</P>
<P>
He said he prefers the Cabrillo area because he hooks big bat rays there that 
he can challenge and move to shore. 
</P>
<P>
Wight and Larson agree it takes practice to become a good float tube angler, 
since it requires a certain amount of caution. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica Halibut Derby is scheduled for Saturday and Sunday, with 2,200 
anglers competing for about $25,000 in cash and prizes. 
</P>
<P>
Any angler catching the tagged fish "Big Bertha" will win $5,000.

ST. BARNARD HIGH STAR STOKES PLAYER OF YEAR; 
</P>
<P>
VIKINGS' CENTER TOPS IN DIVISION I 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
St. Bernard High basketball star Ed Stokes, a 6-11 senior headed for the 
University of Arizona, has been named the Southern Section Division I Player of 
the Year by the First Interstate Bank/Amateur Athletic Foundation board of 
sportswriters. 
</P>
<P>
Stokes was the only South Bay prep selected to the Division I team, which 
consists of players from the Southern Section 5-AA and 5-A divisions. He was a 
near-unanimous pick as player of the year, outpolling Lakewood forward Brian 
Camper. 
</P>
<P>
In leading St. Bernard to a 23-6 record and the Camino Real League title, 
Stokes averaged 25 points, 15 rebounds and four blocked shots a game. His 
rebound and block totals were the best in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The agile center bounced back from an injury-plagued junior season to blossom 
into one of the Southland's most dominant big men. He improved his inside play, 
shooting 76% from the floor, and continued to display a nice shooting touch. He 
was the Vikings' second-best three-point shooter and made 73% of his free 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
"He probably has as much big-time potential as anybody we've had," said St. 
Bernard Coach Jim McClune. 
</P>
<P>
Although he was double- and triple-teamed in most games, Stokes carried the 
Vikings throughout the season. And he did it without the help of the team's 
second-best player, senior forward Juno Armstrong, a three-year varsity starter 
who was sidelined early in the season with a viral infection. 
</P>
<P>
Stokes led St. Bernard to the second round of the 5-AA playoffs, where the 
Vikings lost to Redlands. He was a unanimous choice as the Camino Real Most 
Valuable Player. 
</P>
<P>
Stokes enjoyed some of his best performances against tough competition. 
</P>
<P>
He had 34 points, 23 rebounds and 10 blocked shots Dec. 17 in a 65-61 win over 
Bay League titlist Rolling Hills in the championship game of the Beverly Hills 
Tournament. A week later, he scored a game-high 29 points in a match-up against 
Artesia's highly regarded center, 6-8 junior Ed O'Bannon, to lead the Vikings 
to an 87-67 victory in the Las Vegas Valley Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Stokes, who signed with Arizona last November, becomes the 22nd St. Bernard 
player to earn a spot with a four-year college team since 1979. He chose the 
Wildcats over Louisville, Syracuse and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt (Arizona's) Lute Olson would be a great coach for me," he said. "He'll 
help bring out the best in my game." 
</P>
<P>
Arizona, ranked No. 1 in the nation at the end of the regular season, lost in 
the NCAA West Regional semifinals to Nevada-Las Vegas. ROB FERNAS

WILLIAMSON, THOUSAND OAKS OUTRUN CAMARILLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Williamson turned in an impressive distance double as he and his Thousand 
Oaks teammates recorded a 102-39 victory over Camarillo in a Marmonte League 
dual meet on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Williamson, runner-up in last year's state Division I cross-country 
championships, won the 1,600 meters in a personal best of 4 minutes, 18.6 
seconds and the 3,200 in 9:26.1 to help the Lancers rebound from last week's 
upset loss to Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
While he was a comfortable winner in the 1,600 -- Shawn Goetzinger of Camarillo 
placed second in 4:24.2 -- Williamson had to gun down the Scorpions' Abe Valdez 
in the last 50 meters of the 3,200. Valdez, who placed third in the 1,600 
(4:28.1), ran 9:26.3. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Lindsay won three events for Thousand Oaks (2-1, 2-1 in league meets). He 
took the 110-meter high hurdles in 15.8, the 300 intermediate hurdles in 40.4 
and the long jump at 21 feet, 2 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo (1-4, 0-3) was led by Chad Malesich, who won the 800 in 2:03.8, and 
John Crumrine, who won the pole vault at 12-6. 
</P>
<P>
In other boys' meets: 
</P>
<P>
Royal 76, Simi Valley 60 -- Robert Blumquist won three events and teammate 
Clint Guy won two as the Highlanders defeated the Pioneers in a Marmonte League 
meet at Royal. 
</P>
<P>
Blumquist won the 880 in 2:04.8, the mile in 4:45.3 and the two mile in 
10:37.4. Guy was victorious in the long jump (20-4) and triple jump (41-9 1/2). 
</P>
<P>
Rio Mesa 76, Ventura 59 -- Lester Smith won two events with personal-best 
performances for Rio Mesa in a Channel League meet at Ventura. 
</P>
<P>

Spartans (3-0), the three-time defending league champions. 
</P>
<P>
Hart 77, Burbank 50 -- Todd Lewis of Burbank turned in a superb triple in the 
Foothill League meet at Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, runner-up in the 1,600 at last year's Southern Section 3-A Division 
championships, won the 800 meters in 2:01.0; the 1,600 in 4:27.7 and the 3,200 
in 9:42.2.

TRADITION AT THIRD BASE HAS BEEN TO HAVE NO TRADITION AT ALL 
</P>

In 17 seasons as a Padre broadcaster and one as manager, Jerry Coleman has seen 
a lot of third basemen come and go. Mainly go. Maybe that is why he was so 
blunt in his assessment of the team's ragged history at the position. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been only two third basemen since I've been here, and both of them 
were over the hill when they got here," Coleman said. "One was Doug Rader and 
the other was Graig Nettles. The rest of them were 17 guys named Joe." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, a check of opening day Padre third basemen over the past 20 seasons 
reveals nary a Joe. But outside of Nettles, there is not a potential Hall of 
Famer in the group. The list reads more like a who's who of who's he. 
</P>
<P>
The Padre opening day third basemen since the franchise was founded: Ed Spiezio 
(1969, 1971), Van Kelly (1970), Dave Campbell (1972), Dave Hilton (1973-74), 
Glenn Beckert (1975), Rader (1976-77), Bill Almon (1978), Barry Evans (1979), 
Aurelio Rodriguez (1980), Luis Salazar (1981-83), Nettles (1984), Jerry Royster 
(1985-86), Kevin Mitchell (1987) and Chris Brown (1988). 
</P>
<P>
Monday night against San Francisco at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, Randy 
Ready figures to add his name to that rather unimpressive list. He will be the 
15th player in the team's 21 seasons to open the season at third base, 
confirming once again that turmoil, not tradition, has governed the position. 
</P>
<P>
Finding a steady third baseman has been a franchise-long search. The problem is 
one Padre management readily acknowledges; the solution is not so easily found. 
</P>
<P>
"No question, third basemen have been a scarce commodity," said Jack McKeon, 
the former general manager and now manager. "When I've gone looking, they have 
been hard to find." 
</P>
<P>
The trade winds were filled during the off-season and spring with talk of the 
Padres obtaining a third baseman. There were reports of interest in Howard 
Johnson of the New York Mets, Mike Pagliarulo of the New York Yankees and Jim 
Presley of Seattle, among others. 
</P>
<P>
But all the talk produced only a relatively minor trade with Detroit. In 
exchange for shortstop Mike Brumley, the Padres reacquired Luis Salazar, a 
32-year-old journeyman utility man. Salazar's experience demonstrates as well 
as anyone the franchise's unsettled situation at third. He is back on the Padre 
roster for the third time in his career and leads the team with three opening 
day starts at third. 
</P>
<P>
"Luis is not a bad third baseman," Coleman said. "But when he joined my club 
(in 1980), he was an outfielder. We used to spend time every practice working 
him (at) third." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' conversion of Salazar is typical. 
</P>
<P>
They have tried turning shortstops into third basemen (Almon), second basemen 
into third basemen (Beckert) and even outfielders into third basemen (Hilton). 
Ready is no exception. He was signed by Milwaukee as a second baseman and 
started there in the Padre opener last year. 
</P>
<P>
His left-handed platoon partner, Tim Flannery, who played third almost 
exclusively last season, has played more than twice as many games in his career 
at second (542) than he has at third (210). And Flannery, who turns 32 at the 
end of the season, and Salazar are second in age only to first baseman Jack 
Clark among the team's non-pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
That means the long-term future of the Padres at third must be elsewhere. But 
turning to other teams does not appear to be the answer. 
</P>
<P>
"Look around the major leagues and see how many clubs have problems at third 
base," said Tom Romenesko, the Padre director of player development. "You look 
around for quality people, not just in this organization but in other 
organizations, and you find that third base is just a difficult position to 
fill." 
</P>
<P>
Romenesko pointed to the Padres' deal with San Francisco in June 1987 as a 
demonstration of the ongoing search. It involved an exchange of third basemen 
-- Kevin Mitchell and Chris Brown. 
</P>
<P>
"The Giants took one of our third basemen (Mitchell), and now he's in the 
outfield," Romenesko said. "We took one of their third basemen (Brown), and now 
he is in Detroit (traded in October with Keith Moreland for Walt Terrell)." 
</P>
<P>
"The answer," McKeon said, "is we are going to have to make guys third 
basemen." 
</P>
<P>
That, too, has been more easily said than done. But the Padres are trying. 
Romenesko said there are two players in the minor league system he believes 
could in the future provide the answer to the Padres' third-base blues. 
</P>
<P>
One is Carlos Baerga, 20, who last season batted .273 with 12 home runs and 65 
RBIs at double-A Wichita. The other is David Hollins, 22, who hit .304 with 
nine home runs and 92 RBIs at Class A Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Baerga was in the major league camp this spring and has been moved up to 
triple-A Las Vegas. This is only his second season at third; he was switched 
from second. Hollins was drafted two years as a third baseman and is being 
moved up to take Baerga's place at Wichita. 
</P>
<P>
"Those two are outstanding prospects," Romenesko said. "But we have to have 
some patience. Carlos Baerga can hit. But he is only 20 years old." 
</P>
<P>
But Romenesko's optimism might be tempered by the experience of other teams, 
who have also failed in their search for third basemen. Even the can't-miss 
prospects have failed. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the experience of the Pittsburgh Pirates. They made Jeff King of the 
University of Arkansas the first player selected in the 1986 June free agent 
draft, believing he was their third baseman of the future. But after three 
seasons in the minors, none above double-A, King has a .258 career average. 
</P>
<P>
"He is struggling, and he was the No. 1 pick in the country," Romenesko said. 
"It's difficult because the draft is such a crap shoot. And third base is a 
very difficult position to draft, not only for us but for a lot of other clubs. 
That premium third baseman who is able to step in and do the job is never truly 
available." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres aren't searching for the next Brooks Robinson or Mike Schmidt. 
Finding a third baseman who can hit like Schmidt or field like Robinson is a 
rarity. All they are asking for is someone who can hit with some regularity and 
field adequately. 
</P>
<P>
"Your third baseman has to have a little of both, but what you really want with 
those guys on the corner is someone with a little bigger sock," Romenesko said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Coleman: "Third base is a position where you are willing to give up a 
little defense to get the bat. It's a power position, like first base." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman said he likes what he has seen of Baerga. But he remains cautious, if 
only because he has seen so many third base possibilities pass through San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I really thought Kevin Mitchell had a chance to be the best if he had stayed 
and worked at it," Coleman said. "The only other guy who might have been a 
pretty good player was Dave Roberts." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts was the great tease. In 1973, his second season in the majors, he hit 
21 home runs and batted .286 in 127 games for the Padres, 111 of them at third 
base. But he hit only nine total home runs in his next four seasons before 
being traded to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"He looked like he was on his way to being a 25-a-year home run guy," Coleman 
said. "But he had that one good year, and it was over. Nobody except for 
Nettles and Rader were really great at that position." 
</P>
<P>
But Rader, who played parts of two seasons with the Padres, was in the 
next-to-last season of an 11-year career when he arrived in 1976. And Nettles 
was one season away from the end of his 21-season career when he left the 
Padres after the 1986 season, his third with the team. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Nettles, who turned 40 during the 1984 season, helped lead the Padres to 
their only National League pennant. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Ready or Flannery or Salazar, in any combination, can provide that kind 
of boost will be determined. For now, all McKeon knows is that is what he has 
available is not much different than followers of Padre history should expect.

Tim Flannery usually didn't leave his house for Jack Murphy Stadium on game 
days last summer until 1:30 p.m. That way, he could watch "The Addams Family." 
</P>
<P>
Tony Gwynn used to go to the park at 1:30 or 2, but now that his kids are 
getting older -- Anthony II is 6 and Anisha is 3 -- he shows up about 2:30 or 
2:45. 
</P>
<P>
John Kruk has always been among the first to show up, at 1:30 or 2. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll go talk to the trainers," Kruk said. "Why not? There's nobody at home. 
There's nothing to do at home except sit and watch television. And if I do that 
I'll start eating. And if I start eating, I'll gain 150 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Leiper gets to the park about 3 -- and heads for the clubhouse pool table. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't tell my wife -- she'd kill me," Leiper said, smiling. "I get to the park 
early. I don't know. It's my job. I don't like getting there two minutes before 
I'm supposed to. Some guys do that, and that's all they need. I don't like to 
be rushed. I'll listen to music, do weights." 
</P>
<P>
And then there's Flannery. And "The Addams Family." 
</P>
<P>
"It gets me in a good mood to deal with this," Flannery said. 
</P>
<P>
"This" is the game and all that goes before it. It is facing the fans waiting 
outside the stadium gates for the players' arrival, or facing the media inside. 
It is passing time while watching the Atlanta Braves on WTBS, or the Chicago 
Cubs on WGN, or whatever else the satellite dish at the ballpark is piping into 
the televisions in the clubhouse or onto the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
It is watching Mark Grant drink an average of eight cups of coffee, or Leiper 
take his aspirin. It is watching Kruk munch on a couple of hot dogs, or 
stepping into a shoe filled with shaving cream. Or it is watching Gwynn do a 
five-minute radio show for a local station. 
</P>
<P>
It's crazy and it's kooky, mysterious and spooky, it's altogether ooky: the 
pregame routine. 
</P>
<P>
The batting practice that you see beginning two hours before game time -- 
that's when they roll open the gates at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium -- is 
part of the story. The players actually get to the park much earlier. They take 
extra batting practice or lift weights. Some go in for medical treatment or 
run. Others just sit in the clubhouse, playing cards, pool and video games, or 
answering fan mail. 
</P>
<P>
"Mental preparation is more important than physical preparation," Leiper said. 
"You wouldn't be here if you didn't have the physical talent. You prepare your 
whole life to get this far. After a while, you stay at a certain level where 
you can't improve physically. But you can still improve mentally." 
</P>
<P>
The pregame schedule for a 7:05 p.m. game: 
</P>
<P>
Pitchers hit, 4:30-4:45 
</P>
<P>
Extras hit, 4:45-5:10 
</P>
<P>
Starting lineup hits, 5:10-5:40 
</P>
<P>
Visitors hit, 5:40-6:20 
</P>
<P>
Padres infield, 6:20-6:30 
</P>
<P>
Visitors infield, 6:30-6:40 
</P>
<P>
"After infield, it's concentration time," Gwynn said. "Who's pitching? How is 
he going to pitch me? Have I had success against him? By 6:40, I get to the 
bench, meditate, do some sprints, and then I'm ready to play. I don't sign 
autographs after 6:30. I feel I deserve 30 minutes to get myself mentally 
ready." 
</P>
<P>
What you think you see during batting practice: A bunch of guys hitting in the 
batting cage and running in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
What you really see: Some very organized guys with very specific things in 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
Start with the hitters. The Padre starters hit in groups of three. The first 
three batters in that night's batting order hit for 10 minutes, followed by the 
second three and the final three. And they're not just hacking away aimlessly, 
trying to get wood on the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Take Gwynn. He starts by banging some hits to left. Going the opposite way is 
what the left-handed Gwynn does best, so to stay sharp, that's what he starts 
with. Normally, he hits for between five and 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're hitting for five minutes, I'll hit 10 balls to left field right off 
the bat," Gwynn said. "If we hit for 15 minutes, I may hit to left field for 10 
minutes." 
</P>
<P>
As the pitches continue, Gwynn works his way around to right. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of guys may stand in the stands in right field during batting practice 
waiting for home runs and say, 'This guy never hits it over here' " Gwynn said. 
"Well I don't try to. I spray the ball around. People in the stands may see me 
hit 20 balls to shortstop. I'm trying to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Clark has a similar philosophy. Clark, a right-hander, also begins by 
hitting to the opposite field. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easier to be quicker (and get out in front of the ball)," Clark said. 
"It's harder to stay back. I start with what's hardest and work my way to 
what's easiest. I increase my intensity and make things happen toward the end 
of batting practice instead of at the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
Kruk works on hitting the ball solidly. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to stay on everything," Kruk said. "I work on not getting out in front 
of everything. I hit the ball up the middle and the other way." 
</P>
<P>
The pitchers approach their batting practice a bit differently. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just trying to hit the ball over the fence, basically," Leiper said, 
deadpan. "We'll bunt a couple and then swing away for five or 10 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
The pitchers who are not starting that day are the guys running in the outfield 
during this time. They run either "liners," from foul line to foul line around 
the outfield warning track, or shorter "relays," sprints from the foul line 
into the alleys in left-center or right-center field. They time their running 
so they finish about the time batting practice does. The starters do more 
liners than the relievers. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the way it's been done forever," said Pat Dobson, the pitching coach. 
</P>
<P>
But more is going on. Take a closer look; if you know what to look for, you'll 
see plenty. 
</P>
<P>
Who you see in the bullpen: Backup catcher Mark Parent warming up the starting 
pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Who is really in the bullpen: Mark Parent, assistant pitching coach. 
</P>
<P>
OK, he's not really the assistant pitching coach, but he certainly helps. 
Parent prefers to warm up the starter when Benito Santiago is playing rather 
than letting bullpen coach Denny Sommers do it. 
</P>
<P>
"That way I have a better feel for what (the pitcher) and Benny are going to 
throw," Parent said. "The first time we're playing a club, I'll sit close to 
Pat Dobson, and we'll talk." 
</P>
<P>
Dobson and Parent talk about that night's starting pitcher. Dobson will ask 
Parent how the pitcher's stuff is, and Parent will help Dobson by watching the 
pitcher's mechanics. Maybe a pitcher needs to keep his shoulder in. Parent will 
watch during warm-ups. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to help out," Parent said. "It makes you feel good when something you 
suggest helps win a game. I usually don't get four at-bats a game, but I can 
still help." 
</P>
<P>
Concentration is key for Parent before the game because, like other reserves, 
that's when he gets most of his work in. 
</P>
<P>
"I make sure to take infield seriously," Parent said. "Flannery helped me a 
lot. He let me know that playing off the bench is tougher than playing every 
day." 
</P>
<P>
Said Flannery: "Being a utility guy is a difficult situation. You've got to get 
in a lot of work before the game starts, because you don't get much work during 
the game. I take extra hitting every day and close to 100 ground balls a day at 
different positions. Then I'll take more ground balls during batting practice 
-- off live bats. Then I'll go shower and put on a fresh uniform." 
</P>
<P>
Then, Flannery will drink some coffee and listen to rock and roll -- preferably 
the Allman Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, not all is serious before the game. Not when Mark Grant is doing his 
Jack Clark imitations. Those started when the two were together in 1984 in San 
Francisco. They resumed this spring when Clark and Grant were reunited and 
peaked one day in Ho Ho Kam Park, home of the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
What the Padres saw: "The Cubs were taking batting practice, and we were 
finishing stretching," Gwynn said. "And Grant goes into his Jack Clark 
imitation . . . the bat, the stance, the swing. Well, he starts to swing the 
bat . . ." 
</P>
<P>
What the Cubs saw: He caught the Cubs' attention. The bat went flying out of 
his hands, straight toward the Cub batting practice pitcher. Luckily, it 
missed. "When (the batting practice pitcher) laughed, we laughed," Gwynn said. 
"It was a moment that went from hilarious to serious to hilarious." 
</P>
<P>
What Mark Grant said: "I felt so bad." 
</P>
<P>
What Jack Clark said: "He does me better than I do me." 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't the first pregame fun in which Grant has been involved. Coach Greg 
Riddoch is accomplished at setting a cup of water on top of someone's locker, 
and then tying fishing line from the cup to the player's chair. When the player 
moves his chair, he gets a cup of water upside the head. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago in San Diego, Riddoch doused Grant. But Riddoch rigged his own 
locker, too, to deflect the attention. So when Grant went looking for Riddoch, 
he found fishing line tied to Riddoch's locker as well and assumed Riddoch was 
innocent. 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, with Grant still searching for the culprit, Riddoch finally 
fessed up.

HOME RUN, HURST'S PITCHING HIGHLIGHTS OF PADRE VICTORY

<P>
Thanks to Carmelo Martinez, the people-watchers in San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium Thursday evening were able to forget about the score and concentrate on 
the faces by the end of the first inning of the Padres' sixth annual exhibition 
game with San Diego State University. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez hit a three-run home run in the bottom of the first, and the Padres 
went on to defeat the Aztecs, 5-0, before a crowd estimated at 30,000, giving 
the fans the chance to watch: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bruce Hurst and Jack Clark working in their new office for the first time 
in brown and orange. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hurst breeze through five innings, killing off any doubts about his stiff 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kasey McKeon, who had presented the lineup card at home plate along with 
his father, Padre Manager Jack McKeon, bat against brother-in-law Greg Booker 
-- and get a hit. 
</P>
<P>
There were other names in the news on a warm spring evening. After the game, 
the Padres announced they had optioned first baseman Rob Nelson and pitcher Pat 
Clements to Las Vegas (triple-A), which just about guarantees infielders Bip 
Roberts and Gary Green locker space in the Padre clubhouse for Monday's opening 
night. 
</P>
<P>
It is expected that pitcher Eric Nolte and outfielder Shane Mack will be put on 
the disabled list, which would pare the roster to the limit of 24. 
</P>
<P>
About those home debuts. Hurst allowed two hits and struck out three in five 
innings, setting down 10 in a row before he called it a night. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt pretty good," said Hurst one day after having his left shoulder checked 
by a doctor at Scripps Clinic. "I got some medicine, which will hopefully clear 
out the inflammation. It's a part of pitching. It happens when you pitch a lot 
of innings over your career." 
</P>
<P>
Said Jack McKeon: "He pitched great for a guy who was almost put on the 
disabled list by a couple of television stations last night. I told him to only 
go five innings -- I didn't want the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to 
Humans after me." 
</P>
<P>
Clark's first at-bat in his new home produced a first-inning single to left on 
a two-and-two count off SDSU pitcher Rick Navarro. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to be the first guy to strike out against the college guys," 
Clark said. "I was getting real close." 
</P>
<P>
Clark only played one inning, leaving after taking a wild throw to first off 
his right knee. He said he was going to leave early anyway because of a 
strained groin. Neither injury is said to be serious. 
</P>
<P>
The most interesting confrontation of the evening, though, came in the sixth, 
when Kasey McKeon stepped in to face Booker. On a one-and-one count, Booker 
threw a change-up, which McKeon struck hit weakly into center field. 
</P>
<P>
"He thought it was a fastball," Booker said. "I said, 'If I don't throw any 
harder than that, I am having a bad spring."' 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Padre infielder Gary Green was sitting alone in the dugout an hour before the 
game. It was Green's first time in San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium since the end 
of the 1986 season, when he played in 13 games for the Padres during the last 
month. "It's a little bit weird," Green said. "But sometimes that's the way 
things go." The Padres leave for Las Vegas this morning for their final two 
exhibition games. "It will be good to be going back to Las Vegas with these 
guys," Green said. "Hopefully I'll leave with them Saturday after the game." A 
few hours later, Green found out that he had survived the cut.

MOST STOCKS ADVANCE, BUT DOW SLIPS 0.18

<P>
The stock market turned in an indecisive showing Thursday, pausing after its 
rally of the past three sessions. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 38.48 in the week's first three 
trading days, slipped 0.18 to 2,281.34. 
</P>
<P>
But advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide trading of New 
York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 726 up, 716 down and 498 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume came to 159.95 million shares, up from 144.24 million 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
NYSE trading has been listless this week. Only about 560 million shares have 
changed hands. But some analysts said Thursday's performance was encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
"There were more gains in some stocks than I've seen in a long time," said 
Louis Ehrenkrantz, money manager at Reich &amp; Co. "That's a healthy sign. I 
think we're looking at money seeking individual stock selections." 
</P>
<P>
But others said investors will wait until they have more confidence in the 
economy's direction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Analysts Still Concerned 
</P>
<P>
"It (the market) is puzzling over what the trend of events might be," said 
Monte Gordon, research director at Dreyfus Corp. "It's a very emotional market. 
Three weeks ago we worried about inflation; now we're worried about recession." 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported Thursday morning that new factory orders 
declined 2.3% in February. 
</P>
<P>
That provided fresh support for the view that the pace of the economy began to 
slow last month. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts have been reluctant to conclude from a single month's data that 
the Federal Reserve has succeeded in its efforts to subdue inflationary 
pressures by tightening credit. 
</P>
<P>
The first indication of whether the slowing continued in March isn't expected 
to come until the Labor Department's monthly employment report late next week. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, stocks got little support from the bond market, where interest 
rates rose slightly. 
</P>
<P>
Money center bank stocks were strong for the second straight session, 
apparently benefiting from increased confidence among institutional money 
managers about their prospects for weathering Third World debt problems. 
</P>
<P>
Bank shares dominated the list of active stocks, rising before Sunday's 
International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings, which may clarify the 
Third World debt situation. A bank symposium Wednesday embraced Treasury 
Secretary Nicholas Brady's plan to reduce Third World debt, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Citicorp rose 1 to 29 1/2, Chase Manhattan rose 1 3/8 to 37, BankAmerica added 
5/8 to 24 1/2 and Continental Bank climbed 7/8 to 21. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Genentech Stock Falters 
</P>
<P>
Illinois Power led the active list, down 1 3/4 at 14 on turnover of more than 
4.3 million shares. The Illinois Commerce Commission granted a much smaller 
rate increase than the company had sought. 
</P>
<P>
Genentech dropped 1 5/8 to 17 3/4. An article in the New England Journal of 
Medicine reported on a study suggesting that the company's clot-dissolving drug 
for treatment of heart attacks is no more effective than a much less expensive 
alternative drug. 
</P>
<P>
Smithkline Beckman, which markets the alternative drug, rose 7/8 to 55 5/8. 
Smithkline has also been the subject lately of takeover rumors and speculation. 
</P>
<P>
Sears, Roebuck rose 1/2 to 43 1/2. The company announced plans for a major 
revamping of its organizational structure. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilshire index of 5,000 equities closed at 2,892.618, up 3.488. 
</P>
<P>
Blocks of 10,000 or more shares traded on the NYSE totaled 3,337 compared to 
Wednesday's 3,026. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks edged up 0.13 to 
164.38. 
</P>
<P>
Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index lost 0.06 to 336.86; its 500-stock 
composite index was up 0.17 at 292.52. 
</P>
<P>
The NASDAQ composite index gained 0.86 to 404.56; the American Stock Exchange 
market-value index closed at 325.47, down 0.11. 
</P>
<P>
Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange soared to another record on the strength of 
a late rally Thursday, spurred by a weakening U.S. dollar and renewed interest 
in Japanese government bonds. The Nikkei 225-share index jumped 88.85 to close 
at 32,826.13, its second straight record high. 
</P>
<P>
On the London Stock Exchange, share prices closed sharply lower after a steep 
drop in the afternoon. The Financial Times 100-share index fell 22.3, or 1.1%, 
to 2,049.4.

ROGER SIMON: ATMS ARE HERE TO STAY -- BANK ON IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Roger Simon 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When banks began charging their customers to use the automatic teller machines, 
I was one of the first to scream and shout. 
</P>
<P>
Not fair, I said. Another example of big business gouging the small consumer. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I would like to apologize. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I realize I would pay any price to use the machines. Because I would pay 
any price to avoid going into a bank and dealing with the human beings there. 
</P>
<P>
And judging by the long lines at the bank machines, I would say avoiding other 
human beings has become an important part of most of our lives. 
</P>
<P>
It is two weeks ago and I am standing in line on a sidewalk in front of a bank 
machine. By some unstated code the person using the machine gets about five 
feet of "private" space, while the rest of us stand behind him and mutter about 
how long he is taking. 
</P>
<P>
"What's he doing, taking out a second mortgage?" is one of my favorite mutters. 
</P>
<P>
There are about eight of us in line and we are blocking the sidewalk, which we 
consider our right. As we wait, a woman comes out of the bank, stuffing a 
receipt into her purse. She almost walks headfirst into our line. She stops 
just short of us, looks up a little startled and says: "There's hardly anybody 
inside the bank." 
</P>
<P>
None of us moves. 
</P>
<P>
"There's almost no line inside," she says. 
</P>
<P>
We stare at her. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, all right," she says, a little miffed. "Wait in line then." 
</P>
<P>
We wait in line then. We don't care how short the line is inside the bank. 
Inside the bank, they have bank humans instead of bank machines. Ask anybody, 
the machines are worth waiting for. 
</P>
<P>
It is a week later and I am trying a little variety. Instead of waiting in line 
at a bank machine on foot, I drive up to the drive-up machine and wait in line 
in my car. 
</P>
<P>
When it is my turn, I do what I always do: I forget my secret number. Many 
banks let you pick your own secret number. My bank does not. 
</P>
<P>
My bank does not because it knows that 93.8% of all Americans pick 1-2-3-4 when 
asked to pick a secret number. (Six percent pick 4-3-2-1 and .2% pick Elvis' 
birthday.) 
</P>
<P>
My bank picks a secret number for you and I have a terrible time remembering 
mine. I have tried various mnemonic devices: I know, for instance, my secret 
number starts with Red Grange's jersey number plus two, but then I get in 
trouble because the next two digits are either the number of keys on a piano or 
the real age of Dick Clark. 
</P>
<P>
So I drive up and I punch in the wrong number. 
</P>
<P>
"Sorry, that is incorrect," the machine flashes on the screen. "Try again." 
</P>
<P>
I am used to this. I don't resent it. The machine is being polite (it said it 
was sorry) and it is giving me another chance, which is two things no human 
would do. 
</P>
<P>
I try again. 
</P>
<P>
"Sorry, that is still incorrect," the machine tells me. "Try again." 
</P>
<P>
This is the first time I have gotten it wrong twice, but I am looking forward 
to the adventure. At worst, I figure, the machine will spit my card back at me 
and then I can drive home and rummage around in my sock drawer for my secret 
number, which is written on a card that cleverly says "Secret Number." 
</P>
<P>
I get it wrong a third time. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very sorry," the machine says and I can tell that it really is. "Your 
card must be withheld for your own protection. Please see a teller inside." 
</P>
<P>
Icy fingers of dread clutch at my heart. I don't mind so much that my card is 
gone. But I am terrified at having to go inside and talk to a bank human. I 
have avoided this for years. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the bank, there is no line. (Everybody is outside at the machines.) I go 
to a teller. Her gaze is fixed on a spot two feet above my head. 
</P>
<P>
The machine kept my card, I say. 
</P>
<P>
"You musta done it wrong," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, I did, but how can I. . . . 
</P>
<P>
She turns to the teller next to her. "Hey, is it warm outside or what?" she 
asks. 
</P>
<P>
I was wondering how I can get my card back, I say. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Cause if it's warm," she says, "I'm not gonna wear my, you know, sweater." 
</P>
<P>
My card, I say. I need my card. 
</P>
<P>
She turns back to me. "You musta done it wrong," she says. 
</P>
<P>
I know, I say, I know. 
</P>
<P>
"Lemme ask you something," she says in a low, serious tone. 
</P>
<P>
I lean forward. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it warm out?" she asks. "Or what?" 
</P>
<P>
I know when I am beaten. There's no way you can get my card for me, right? I 
ask. 
</P>
<P>
"It's in the machine," she says, shocked. "We're not allowed to touch the 
machines." 
</P>
<P>
And I don't want her to. The machines are polite and do their best and I don't 
want people messing around inside them and making them as bad as we are. 
</P>
<P>
I know I am being hard on an entire species. But I also know we can all buckle 
down and do better. 
</P>
<P>
Because, gosh darn it, I want human beings that our machines can be proud of.

ON YOUR OWN: MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT A RELATIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Question: After 18 years of marriage, my lover is in the process of separating 
from his wife and children. He assures me that I am not the cause of the 
breakup but the "final push" that he needs to end an unhappy marriage. I want 
to continue our relationship, but I am afraid that it will end when the 
separation process is completed. I feel that I may no longer be needed. Would 
it be better for him to adjust to single life on his own, or should I help him 
through it and take my chances? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: You seem to think there is a single right answer to your question, but 
there isn't. So you have to carefully examine your specific circumstances, 
listen to your heart and rely on your best judgment in reaching a decision 
about this situation. Explore these questions about yourself, him and the 
relationship: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Do I want a continued relationship with him after he is free? Does my 
writing this letter reflect some of my own mixed feelings about continuing? Do 
I need him to be unavailable in order to feel involved with him? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Am I picking up signs that he doesn't care enough about me to stay with me? 
Is he consciously or unconsciously using me as a transitional relationship? Do 
his feelings for me seem genuine, loving and deep? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Do I love him enough to go through some emotionally difficult times as he 
adjusts to such a drastic change in his life? Does he want me there to share 
those difficulties with him? 
</P>
<P>
Only you can decide what is best for you, but if the relationship is worth 
anything, you should not be making decisions about it unilaterally. You need to 
get together and discuss your concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am a widower, and four years ago I had the good fortune to marry a decent, 
intelligent, pretty woman. At that time, we signed a prenuptial agreement and I 
included her in my will for $175,000. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I am 70 (she is 68) and I have sensibly reviewed the situation. I have an 
income of $3,000 per month that ends with my death, and an income of $65,000 
per year, from investments, that can go on and on. If I die first, my wife will 
not have the luxuries I've provided for the past four years -- therefore, I've 
decided to leave her the $65,000 income per year for her entire life instead of 
the lump sum of $175,000. My three children, whose ages range from their 
mid-30s to mid-40s, and who are married and in good circumstances, are 
absolutely infuriated about not receiving benefits throughout my wife's 
lifetime. I think I will ignore them, but their indignation overwhelms me. Help 
me make a good decision. 
</P>
<P>
A: The first point to keep firmly in mind is that your money is your money. You 
worked for it, made decisions about investing it, and you have the right to 
dispose of it any way you like. Looked at that way, your children's 
"indignation" is inappropriate and should not coerce you to go against your own 
wishes. 
</P>
<P>
However, their feelings are, to a degree, understandable. As your children, 
they have shared one of the closest of relationships with you all their lives. 
Then, along comes this "stranger," and in four years you are willing to delay 
their inheritance in her favor. Perhaps they believe that she has pressured you 
unfairly or twisted your judgment, and you certainly owe it to yourself as well 
as to them to see if that has indeed been going on. 
</P>
<P>
You should feel secure that you made your parental contribution to them by 
raising them as best you could and providing them with the education and 
wherewithal to achieve their present "good circumstances." Further, no one but 
you can assess how dear your new wife is to you and how concerned you are about 
her continued well-being. 
</P>
<P>
If you review the situation and feel that there is some merit to your 
children's reasoning, there may be ways to make changes in your will that are 
not on an "all or none" basis -- perhaps apportioning the income between them 
and your wife according to some formula that makes sense to you. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, bear in mind that most people keep the terms of their wills secret, 
and, as you may have discovered, that often makes sense.

The reason for the small number of cats among White House pets ("White House 
Cats: Why So Doggone Few?" by Kathleen Hendrix, March 27) should really be 
quite obvious. The White House is a residence for a politician, and a 
politician likes to control a situation, to be in charge, to give orders, and 
to be obeyed. A dog is an ideal subject for such a benign dictator, being 
cheerful, loyal and not at all questioning. A cat, on the other hand, chooses 
to walk by itself, obedient to no man -- unless it suits the cat. 
</P>
<P>
Never forget that essential oxymoron: My cat.

The mountain bike organizations need to do more than seek to "change (their) 
image from outlaws to guardians of the hills" ("Mountain Bikes" by Bob Howells, 
March 25). Members must learn the rules of courtesy, what roads are for bikes, 
and leave the hiker trails open. 
</P>
<P>
On the basis of complaints to me as the chairman of the Pacific Palisades 
Homeowners' Assn. from residents in the Palisades Highlands who hike in the 
surrounding Topanga State Park hills, I've learned that bikers fail to heed the 
rules of the road, travel as groups, in most instances, as members of a biking 
club, and endanger the safety of the hikers by riding the narrow trails instead 
of the wider fire roads. 
</P>
<P>
The chief ranger for the state park in question has verified the facts, but 
admits they lack the manpower to enforce the rules, and banning the bikes is 
being considered. 
</P>
<P>
We seem to have millions to purchase more recreational areas -- that we do need 
-- but no dollars for staff to monitor the parks and serve its users. That's a 
calamitous error.

OSCAR: AN OVERNIGHT SENSATION; 
</P>
<P>
EL RESCATE PARTY AT VERTIGO WAS NO PIECE OF CAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Like some Oscar ceremonies of years past, some Oscar parties have more glitches 
than glitz. 
</P>
<P>
Take Wednesday night's second annual Oscar-watching party and fund-raiser held 
by El Rescate, a support group for Central American refugees in the Los Angeles 
area. The 1988 El Rescate party at the Mondrian Hotel attracted a large crop of 
young actors, but this year's version, held at the newly reopened discotheque 
Vertigo in downtown Los Angeles, attracted fewer celebrities and more 
logistical problems. 
</P>
<P>
Many guests who paid $100 apiece to attend were left out on the sidewalk during 
the telecast -- when the doormen, who insisted that the club wasn't ready to 
receive partygoers, acted as if they were shepherding a standard Friday-night 
club crowd instead of prepaid ticket holders. And many of those who managed to 
get in soon regretted it. Every one of about 20 people questioned expressed 
displeasure with the night's events. 
</P>
<P>
Costume designer Scilla Andreen-Hernandez did finally get in. She and her 
escort had arrived at 5:30 and were not allowed inside for more than an hour. 
Once in, she made the mistake of trying to enter a restricted area -- which was 
not marked -- and was grabbed roughly by a Vertigo guard. 
</P>
<P>
"This is ridiculous. I almost wonder why I came," she said. 
</P>
<P>
As the Oscar ceremony began at 6 p.m., only about 100 people were inside the 
club; ticket-holders were lined up outside. Those who circumvented the guards 
outside watched the ceremony on monitors donated by KMEX-TV. 
</P>
<P>
Guests got the first peek at Vertigo's interior, which combines high-tech 
industrial furnishings with a '70s-style disco floor, complete with fog 
machines. Vertigo's employees appeared touchier than Secret Service agents, 
treating guests like interlopers and in at least one case, cursing at a woman 
who was merely trying to find a bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't take pictures inside the club," one employee told a television 
newswoman, "and you can't take pictures of anyone -- unless they're smiling." 
</P>
<P>
More gracious was event chairman Esai Morales as he ran around, fixing a number 
of last-minute details. 
</P>
<P>
"We're dealing with a club that's holding its first opening," he said. "On the 
last day (before the party), it seems that everybody decides they want to come 
and they call." 
</P>
<P>
Morales was less enthusiastic about a competing Oscar party at the Mondrian, 
which was billed as "The Second Annual Academy Award Celebration at the 
Mondrian." Sources within El Rescate had indicated that the group was 
considering legal action against the other fund-raiser's organizers, for 
possible misrepresentation of their party. 
</P>
<P>
"Put it this way," Morales said. "We as an entity don't want to take legal 
action, but who knows? I'm going to let the powers that be straighten it out." 
</P>
<P>
Things took another bad turn at about the time that the best picture was 
announced. Lots of people were inside by then, but actress Rain Pryor, who was 
scheduled to speak on stage at the concert afterward, was refused entry at the 
door when she couldn't produce identification. (She later got in when she was 
OKd by someone inside the club.) 
</P>
<P>
Other ticket-holders on the sidewalk -- including actors Harrison Ford and 
Kiefer Sutherland -- gave up and left without ever getting inside. 
</P>
<P>
Fire marshals arrived at 9:15, sealed off one balcony, forbade further 
admissions and promptly threatened to shut the club down for overcrowding. 
(Fire Marshal Addison Burdine declined to comment or to estimate the number of 
people on hand.) 
</P>
<P>
"The Fire Department was sort of unreasonable about it," said Vertigo's general 
manager, Goyn Samuels. "They made us take the tables off the dance floor, and I 
can understand why some people who had to get up would be upset." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about guests' other complaints, especially the guards' manhandling of 
some partygoers, Samuels pointed out that the night's staff also included 
security people hired by El Rescate. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not all Vertigo staff," he said. 
</P>
<P>
El Rescate officials, however, said Vertigo was responsible for the evening's 
problems. The organizers expected the club to have been open for several weeks 
before Wednesday night's party. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Oscar night turned into a dry run for the new club: There was not one 
public telephone in the building, and guests who left to use one were not 
readmitted. Many guests never had a bite to eat. Those who ate, however, were 
enthusiastic about the peeled shrimp, cheese puffs, seafood pizza and fresh 
oysters. 
</P>
<P>
Dessert arrived without silverware. Waiters simply told guests to take pieces 
of cake off of trays. Hungry guests who complied discovered, to their dismay, 
that they were holding cold, wet hunks of ice cream cake. 
</P>
<P>
A musical jam session began after 11 p.m. and soothed some feelings. Jane Fonda 
introduced singers Holly Near and Bonnie Raitt, who performed songs in support 
of Central American causes, and Dennis Quaid was scheduled to join them later. 
</P>
<P>
And there was always celebrity watching. Those spotted included Gregory Hines, 
Billy Idol, Robert Downey Jr., Sarah Jessica Parker, Howard Hesseman, Sen. Alan 
Cranston, songwriter Stephen Bishop, Chad Lowe, Rob Lowe, Daphne Zuniga and 
comedian Taylor Negron, who was a late arrival, coming straight to the party 
from emceeing another Oscar party at City Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Marlee Matlin, best actress winner of 1987, was another late arrival. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so nice not to have to be a nominee or a presenter this year," she 
signed. "I watched the show over at Henry and Stacy Winkler's, with good 
friends. And my shoes off." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the other guests might have envied her.

WINNERS AND LOSERS PUT ON THE GLITZ AT OSCAR BALL AND SPAGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This was, if nothing else, the year the stars came and stayed at the Academy 
Awards Board of Governors Ball. 
</P>
<P>
It was as simple as holding the party at the Shrine, the site of the Oscars; as 
simple as draping a few thousand yards of red and white chiffon around a room, 
of catering a three-course gourmet meal, of having an orchestra on a slowly 
revolving pedestal, over which towered three very large Oscar statues. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Oscar show producer Allan Carr bribed the celebs who attended. Maybe he 
threatened to take their statuettes away. No matter. They looked like they were 
having a good time. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to get to our table," said best supporting actress winner Geena 
Davis when asked how she and husband Jeff Goldblum were going to celebrate her 
win. 
</P>
<P>
"Doesn't she look great?" Goldblum said admiringly of his wife, who was dressed 
in a sea-foam green satin dress with an honest-to-God bustle. Her Oscar was 
nestled in the crook of her arm. "With her hair and everything," he added, "it 
really offsets it." 
</P>
<P>
Jodie Foster arrived with actor Julian Sands, plopped down at her table, weary 
but happy, and started to eat. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea what I said or what I did," she said, thinking back to her 
acceptance speech. "My dress broke. I don't know what happened. It just broke. 
But somebody fixed it. What am I going to do to celebrate? I don't know," she 
said, starting to pick at her salmon. "Probably eat this." 
</P>
<P>
Such simple pleasures these people thrive on. 
</P>
<P>
Like Kevin Kline, winner for best supporting actor. 
</P>
<P>
He had no big plans to whoop it up, he explained. "I have a rehearsal in the 
morning. It's a new film I'm doing called 'I Love You to Death.' Larry Kasdan 
is directing and it has a wonderful cast. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm saying that," he added, "but I'm probably going to stay up all night and 
dance. So don't believe a word I say." 
</P>
<P>
A dance floor surrounded the band. But rather than using it for dancing 
(although some tried), the space was mostly used for photographing the stars in 
various configurations as they congratulated each other. As soon as another 
star would emerge, a gaggle of photographers and reporters would swoop in for a 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
"Hooray for Hollywood" boomed from the bandstand as Oscar nominees and 
"Dangerous Liaisons" co-stars Michelle Pfeiffer and Glenn Close put their blond 
heads together for a photograph. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Guber of Guber-Peters, the production team that put together "Rain Main," 
was both congratulatee and congratulator, hugging "Rain Man" co-star Tom Cruise 
and generally beaming with excitement. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the fourth time that we've been nominated, and the first time we've 
won," he said. "This is like a dream come true. We started this picture four 
years ago, and then to sit here tonight and hear them read it off as best 
picture. Look, I even have the envelope in my pocket!" 
</P>
<P>
And so he did. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Pfeiffer looked none the worse for losing the supporting actress award 
to Geena Davis. She was still in shock over presenting the best adapted 
screenplay Oscar to Christopher Hampton for "Dangerous Liaisons." 
</P>
<P>
"I had a deal with Dennis (Quaid, her co-presenter) that if anyone else but 
Christopher won he would read the winner. I opened the envelope and I couldn't 
believe my eyes. To be able to give that to someone you worked with was so 
wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
Pfeiffer gave Hampton due credit for being on the set every day and "losing 
just as much sleep as we did. He was amazing. He was really committed." 
</P>
<P>
Hampton seemed still dazed by the whole thing as he made his way to his table. 
"As I got off stage I was struck by the most terrible. . . ." he paused, 
clutching his stomach, "ague. I just collapsed. But I feel better now." 
</P>
<P>
His immediate future plans included celebrating "extensively." 
</P>
<P>
It took a while for the crush at the "A" tables to diminish; some actually did 
get to their dinners. Pregnant Melanie Griffith, chowing down for two, sat with 
fiance Don Johnson, her frothy white dress in accord with his frothy blond-ish 
hair. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Cruise (his hair just growing in after being buzzed off for his role in 
"Born on the Fourth of July") smooched at his table with auburn-haired wife 
Mimi Rogers. She was wearing a pink-and-black polka-dot dress with little 
winglets at the hips that looked perfect for hiding small snacks. 
</P>
<P>
The guests also included Rob Lowe, Max von Sydow, Gene Hackman, Sigourney 
Weaver, Martin Landau, Patrick Swayze, Alan Parker, Robin Williams, Martin 
Short, Billy Crystal, Ricki Lake, Rita Wilson and Tom Hanks (and his look-alike 
brother, Jim), Corey Feldman, documentary film nominee Bruce Weber, Bruce 
Willis and Demi Moore, Jon Peters, Michael Ovitz, Frances McDormand, Amy 
Irving, Richard Dreyfuss and Meryl Streep. 
</P>
<P>
"Very good" was Fred Hayman's assessment of the evening's glamour meter, and as 
Oscar wardrobe consultant he should know. "I'd like to see it (the clothes) 
more elaborate for the stage, though. But it was very elegant. It gets better 
and better every year." 
</P>
<P>
And what were this year's Oscar fashion disasters? 
</P>
<P>
Hayman smiled, laughed a little, but wouldn't name names. Nor would he name 
names of the fashion stand-outs. He eventually dished one name. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't like what Cher wore," he said, referring to the star's minidress. "It 
was out of place -- even for Cher." 
</P>
<P>
And by the time Allan Carr arrived, resplendent in a black sequined tux, his 
admirers couldn't wait to bestow their congratulations upon him. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey," he said with a shrug. "It's all work." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Irving (Swifty) Lazar's Oscar bash was being worked over but good. It was late 
evening, 11-ish, by the time the stars scooted from downtown to Spago in West 
Hollywood, de-limoed, grazed by the paparazzi and the crowds of fans waiting 
behind police barricades and entered the party. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there were plenty of stars already there, those who had been 
celebrating since early evening when the telecast began. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the downtown crowd had arrived, the plates had been cleared, the 
television monitors stashed away and the confetti strewn about the floor as 
guests elbowed their way through the restaurant's front rooms, sitting down 
when there was a chance. 
</P>
<P>
Chefs were still turning out pizzas from the bank of ovens while a very 
pregnant (and seemingly tireless) Barbara Lazaroff served them. Husband 
Wolfgang Puck was bouncing about in his kitchen whites. 
</P>
<P>
Among the crowd at The Party That Would Not Die were Jack Nicholson and 
Anjelica Huston, Roger Moore, Sean Connery, Jackie Collins, Bob Newhart, 
Suzanne de Passe, Don Rickles, Shirley MacLaine, Michael Caine, Cybill 
Shepherd, Kathleen Turner, Jillie and Tom Selleck, Anne Archer, Kim Novak, 
Vanity Fair editor Tina Brown, Gregory Hines, Placido Domingo, Sherry Lansing, 
Brenda and Lionel Richie, Jane Fonda and Peter Fonda, Gene Siskel and Governors 
Ball spillovers Tom Cruise and Mimi Rogers, Bruce Willis and Demi Moore, 
Patrick Swayze and Robin Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Lazar disappeared mid-way through the party, but his guests managed to 
celebrate on their own just fine. 
</P>
<P>
Best director winner Barry Levinson said he planned to "go back to writing. I'm 
in the middle of writing a screenplay. I'm doing another Baltimore movie," 
reprising his home town in another film, after his successful 1982 film 
"Diner." 
</P>
<P>
It looked like the realization of winning hadn't quite dawned on comedian 
Steven Wright, who picked up an Oscar for best live-action short for "The 
Appointments of Dennis Jennings." 
</P>
<P>
"For days I've been mentally preparing myself to lose," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And what was his assessment of his first Oscar experience? 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a live Fellini movie."

'HEATHERS' GETS LOST IN A MORAL THICKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, Times Film Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Heathers" (citywide) is about the darker impulses that almost everyone feels 
at least once during the extended hell week that high school can be: that 
fleeting urge of "I could just kill him (or her)." In "Heathers" they do. 
</P>
<P>
It's set in a rich middle-American high school where the ruling clique of 
Juniors is called the Heathers, after the names of all three members. In 
training to become a Heather is Veronica (Wynona Ryder), who instead falls 
under the influence of a dark, disturbing newcomer, J. D. (Christian Slater). 
Like Veronica, he seems to sneer at the cruelty and consumerism of their 
classmates, although his methods are hardly usual. First the reigning Heather, 
Veronica's oppressor/chum (Kim Walker), is slipped a mug filled with paint 
stripper; next Veronica lures out, then shoots two obnoxious jock classmates 
dead in their tracks. It may be disingenuous murder at first, but faced with 
dead bodies she doesn't stop; she helps Slater forge notes so that all three 
are believed to be suicides, touching off suicide mania at Westerburgh High. 
</P>
<P>
"Heathers" is a film that thinks of itself as black comedy; certainly some of 
the targets in Daniel Waters' script are overdue for a zinger or two: school 
cliques, unctuous teachers, parents who won't be parents and want to be hip 
post-adolescents, and a society with the values of a television sitcom. 
</P>
<P>
But to mount black comedy successfully, you must have a clearly defined point 
of view. You must also be willing to follow your dangerous outlook to its most 
outrageous conclusion, as "A Fish Called Wanda" does when it flattens Kevin 
Kline with a steamroller. Unfortunately, director Michael Lehmann's point of 
view is swivel-mounted: He doesn't have the courage of his cynicism. 
</P>
<P>
If he did, he'd have to go all the way. Having made treacherous comedy out of 
the death of innocents -- the fact that the innocents are dumb, vicious or 
loathsome is absolutely beside the point -- director Lehmann would have to go 
out on his self-created limb and saw it off behind him. Having threatened to 
blow up the high school, "Heathers" would have to end with the biggest 
explosion of consumers and consumer goods since "Zabriskie Point." 
</P>
<P>
Then we might take his brackish malice seriously. We might not like it, but it 
would be easier to respect full-tilt nihilism instead of a director who wimps 
out with a cloying "After School Special" ending, completely different in tone 
and style from the film's other three-quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Having hung out with J. D. until he turns into a real monster, Lehmann has his 
appealing Veronica turn over a new leaf; she declares herself "the sheriff in 
the white hat," new leader of the pack. And to the obese girl who's been the 
victim of a particularly humiliating Heathers trick, Veronica suggests chirpily 
that they sit out the prom together, at home over a video or two. Three deaths 
are waved away without weight or guilt. They simply don't count. That is the 
most profound cynicism of "Heathers." 
</P>
<P>
The few who remember the interesting, uneven "Static" from two years ago may 
recall that part of its story turned on a busload of elderly, endearing 
characters who became hostages in an escalating stand-off with police and 
finally a SWAT team. In a surprise turn, their bus was blown up. And sitting 
there stunned, as the dust of the explosion cleared on the horizon, you were 
forced to confront death as something real. 
</P>
<P>
You might make a case that Veronica is an unwilling accomplice in all this, a 
pawn to Slater's drawling J. D., whom she only later sees as a genuine 
psychopath. But she's supposed to be the film's smart kid, lured by J. D.'s 
philosophy as much as his off-beatness. 
</P>
<P>
Then, too, by having Slater play him in his best Jack Nicholson voice, as a 
grinning, Nicholson psycho-thug, Lehmann undercuts J. D.'s value as a voice of 
opposition. Setting sick dangerous anarchy against sick dangerous conformism 
isn't much of a choice. When Veronica rejects him at the end, she's just 
rejecting craziness, not the flaws in his argument. 
</P>
<P>
Lehmann may not yet demonstrate much heart or even taste; he does have 
considerable technical skill, and he's also not above borrowing from the best 
of the past. (That arresting croquet game shot with Ryder's head buried in the 
grass comes from "Repentance" and from Peckinpah and Jodorowsky before that.) 
And, in addition to his behind-the-camera artists, especially costume designer 
Rudy Dillon and production designer Jon Hutman, he has been beautifully served 
by Wynona Ryder, an actress of grace and subtlety since her first moments in 
"Lucas." As for Slater, now that we have seen his nifty Nicholson turn twice, 
can he please go back to his own voice, and mannerisms? 
</P>
<P>
Screenwriter Waters is hardly uninteresting: He knows the turf he's tearing up, 
and some of his more scalding moments, the funeral of the two jocks, the 
college mixer, are dead-on. (In addition to the grisly deaths, "Heathers' " 
R-rating is for the film's language, which could scrape hulls. Teen-agers may 
recognize it; it will give timorous adults fits.) 
</P>
<P>
Of course, some may not want to indulge the "Heathers" film makers beyond their 
first 15 minutes. As Heather No. 1 drains the hull cleaner in one gulp and 
crashes through her glass-topped table, the idea of using violent death -- 
today -- as a jokey grace note may seem so soulless that audiences decamp right 
there. There's even another possible alternative. . . .

OSCAR: AN OVERNIGHT SENSATION; 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA FORECASTS BOX-OFFICE THUNDER FOR 'RAIN MAN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
MGM/UA executives saw green the morning after the Academy Awards. Dollars, that 
is. 
</P>
<P>
While the Oscar winners basked in the honor from their peers on Thursday, 
distributors of their films scrambled to capitalize on the earning potential of 
those 13-inch-high statuettes. And MGM/UA, whose "Rain Man" earned the best 
picture nod, has the most to gain. Executives said they are expecting a big 
boost to the film's already impressive performance at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
Eager to find out exactly how much a best picture Oscar is worth, Entertainment 
Data Inc. recently crunched some numbers and calculated that this year's winner 
could probably count on a $20-million windfall. While researchers had no way of 
knowing how a film would do sans Oscar, they did find that "The Last Emperor" 
earned $18.9 million after its win last year; "Platoon" drew an additional 
$35.2 million in ticket sales, and "Out of Africa," $17.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
"If you figure that historically an Academy Award (for best picture) can be 
worth $20 million, then 'Rain Man' could do at least $155 million in the U.S.," 
said Barry Lorie, MGM/UA's senior vice president of marketing. Since its 
release Dec. 16, the film has grossed $135.6 million here. 
</P>
<P>
For the losers, of course, post-Oscar season is a different story. Orion's 
"Mississippi Burning," which has grossed only $30.5 million in the United 
States, could have used the boost a major award would have brought. Charles O. 
Glenn, Orion's executive vice president of marketing, wouldn't comment on 
whether that film's showing had dashed the studio's hopes of a wider release. 
But he noted that one or more major Oscar awards "would certainly enhance the 
film's position in the marketplace." Although it received seven nominations, 
"Mississippi Burning" walked away with just one Oscar, for best cinematography. 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA isn't likely to release "Rain Man" beyond the 1,562 theaters in which it 
is already playing -- the widest release of any film now in the market. But, 
said Lorie, "if theaters ask for a print" of the film, the studio will provide 
it. In the meantime, the studio is launching an advertising blitz on TV and in 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Confident of success, MGM/UA and Paramount -- whose film, "The Accused," earned 
Jodie Foster the best actress award -- timed their foreign releases to coincide 
with Oscar season. Last night's worldwide broadcast, which eventually will 
reach an estimated 1 billion viewers, amounted to "massive paid advertising 
around the world," noted veteran film marketer Greg Morrison. 
</P>
<P>
"When we first learned of the picture over a year ago, realizing we've got a 
picture with star power and a good chance for Academy Awards, we planned our 
foreign distribution so that we'd be on screens around the world when the 
awards were announced," said Jack Gordon, MGM/UA's president of international 
distribution. Gordon also expects a $20-million gain in ticket receipts 
overseas, where "Rain Man" has already grossed $65 million since the end of 
February. 
</P>
<P>
As for "The Accused," Martin Kutner, executive vice president of international 
marketing and distribution, predicts that, overseas, Foster's Oscar could push 
the film beyond its weak U.S. results. Foster was already popular overseas for 
her Oscar-nominated performance in "Taxi Driver" and has beguiled French 
audiences by doing media interviews in their language. So far, the film has 
grossed $26.4 million at foreign theaters. 
</P>
<P>
Here in the United States, where the film grossed more than $30 million after 
its release last fall, Paramount plans to re-release "The Accused" in 11 Los 
Angeles area theaters.

"Rain Man" has won screenwriter Barry Morrow an Oscar, and now the film may 
also earn him a belated college degree. Some 20 years ago, Morrow left St. Olaf 
College in Minnesota one credit short of graduation. He attended St. Olaf in 
the late 1960s, transferred to the University of Hawaii for his junior year, 
then returned to St. Olaf, but some credits were not transferred. Now, St. 
Olaf's speech-theater department has said if he'll submit his script, it will 
be graded and give him enough credit to graduate. "There's always something 
perversely funny about coming one short of graduating," Morrow, 40, told the 
Associated Press. "I didn't really matriculate until now as a professional 
screenwriter, so it seems a good and fitting ceremony to celebrate the success 
of 'Rain Man.' " AILEEN MacMINN

The National Stuttering Project, the group that launched protests after "A Fish 
Called Wanda" was released, demanded an apology Thursday from actor Kevin Kline 
over remarks he made the previous evening upon winning the best supporting 
actor Oscar for his role in the film. "Wanda" features British comedian Michael 
Palin as a stutterer. When asked by reporters about the protests, Kline 
responded, "John Cleese (the film's co-author and star) mentioned to me today 
he was getting a lot of calls from a group of stupid people who didn't like the 
way stupid people were represented. . . ." Kline defended Palin's portrayal and 
noted that Palin's father stuttered in real life. "Michael Palin had no qualms 
that I know of about representing that and I think he did it brilliantly," 
Kline said. "A lot of times it's funny, what comes out of them. . . . We have 
to laugh at tragic things if they're seen in a certain perspective. Let's not 
lose our sense of irony." John Ahlbach, executive director of the National 
Stuttering Project, said, "We were not saying that stuttering could not be 
laughed at. Humor must play a part in coping with any chronic disorder like 
stuttering. However, we feel the movie reinforces a stereotype of people who 
stutter, and therefore invites the audience to laugh at people who stutter and 
not with us." Ahlbach acknowledged that Kline "made his remarks in haste and 
perhaps did not mean all that was implied in his joke." AILEEN MacMINN

Ex-Martha Graham principal Ellen Segal will return to the Westminster Theater 
on May 18-20 with "Mostly New Garage Dances," a concert that picks up where the 
dance maker left off last year. As the title suggests, most of the works on 
this program will be premieres, including a work by guest artist Betzi Roe of 
Three's Company. Also scheduled for this concert is a revival of an early Segal 
signature work, "Teaming," which comes to grips in pure dance terms with the 
crippling illness that sidelined Segal for more than a decade.

A chain of eight laundromats in the south San Francisco Bay Area has been told 
that its laundry ad showing dirty undies isn't clean enough for the silver 
screen. The proposed ad pictures an overflowing clothes hamper and soiled 
undies on the floor, accompanied by the words: "Are you buying underwear to 
avoid your laundromat?" Promoters of Oasis Laundries Inc. wanted to advertise 
on 16 area movie screens operated by AMC theaters, a subsidiary of National 
Cinema Network of Kansas City, Mo. The movie ad was to complement a billboard 
campaign that has used the same picture for three months. Oasis was told that 
the men's undershorts on the floor was the problem, and the ad could run if the 
shorts were deleted. Oasis management found that "absolutely ridiculous" since 
millions had already seen the picture on billboards. A spokesman for National 
Cinema in Kansas City said the ad did not adhere to its G-rating, family fare 
policy. AILEEN MacMINN

'SLOW MOVING TRAIN' CHUGS ON THE RIGHT TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People probably use "Pinteresque" too much to describe a certain kind of stage 
or film dialogue. But the term fits the cryptic Australian thriller, "Warm 
Nights on a Slow Moving Train" (Beverly Center Cineplex). Most of the talk is 
spare, allusive; everyday chatter sliced into stylized chunks, deceptively 
casual but pointed badinage that seems to conceal sinister portents, inner 
madness. 
</P>
<P>
The movie suggests what might have happened if Pinter, Ionesco and Albee had 
tried a joint invasion of "The Lady Vanishes." In "Warm Nights," every 
conversation is, to some extent, a combat, a game or a riddle. The characters 
are abstract, defined by their roles. Only one of them, a professional 
politician, even has a name. 
</P>
<P>
The central figure, the Girl (Wendy Hughes), is a chameleon-like hooker who 
seduces men on a weekend night train, changing her personality to suit every 
fresh conquest. At first, the film seems to be getting its mileage out of a sly 
sexual reversal. The Girl treats men the way obsessive Don Juans often treat 
female conquests: kicking them all out on the dot of 3 a.m., ignoring them 
afterward. The train, hurtling through its endless night, with the same lounge 
car piano revelry, the same metronomic clack-clack pace, is the site of 
continuous erotic variations always building to the climactic zinger, "Of 
course, you'll have to pay." 
</P>
<P>
But gradually, the story becomes a fable about good, evil, the puzzles of 
identity, the dangers of compartmentalizing love. The Girl has a "moral" 
motive. And she meets a Man (Colin Friels) who seems to offer escape, love or a 
darker, more dangerous temptation. 
</P>
<P>
It would be wrong to synopsize more. "Warm Nights on a Slow Moving Train" gets 
its effects almost entirely from the felicities of its acting and the 
continuous twists and turns of the plot. It's best to go into it as cold as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
Director-co-writer Bob Ellis was the scenarist for several of Paul Cox's films, 
including "Man of Flowers," "Cactus" and "My First Wife." He has a gift for the 
macabre humors of alienation and the pith of solitary pain. He knows how to 
startle us with a quick twist of phrase, a sudden move in an unexpected 
direction. It's a clever if abstract show in a dry, cold "House of Games" mood. 
</P>
<P>
But, as a director, Ellis has almost no visual style. "Warm Nights" looks flat 
and empty, and though this stylelessness has the merit of fixing attention on 
the dialogues, it becomes monotonous, like the clack of the rails. There's also 
something over the top and hasty about Ellis' last act. It comes too suddenly, 
it's too drastic -- and it seems more metaphoric than dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
It's the actors who make this train run on time, especially Friels as the rough 
lover, Norman Kaye as a born-again widower, Peter Whitford as a gay steward and 
Steve J. Spears as a funky singer. And, most of all, Hughes as the many-masked 
prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes has a thin face and pale, yearning eyes that make her great for 
obsessive roles. Along with Kaye, she once beautifully limned the agonies of 
sexual repression in Cox's "Lonelyhearts," and it's fun to see them eyeing each 
other lecherously here, playing seduction games, nailing down together the 
harsher solitude of joyless hedonism. 
</P>
<P>
But there's no fun at the core. Hughes has the delicately balanced, distant 
look of someone you'll never reach. She suggests both cold, calculated 
sensuality on top and bitter resignation below; her face, in her near-anonymous 
grapplings, takes on the ashen pallor of someone caught in a mechanical 
embrace. For this woman, flesh is never warm, sweat is never wet, joy lies 
bleeding and sex is always over, on the dot, at 3 a.m. MICHAEL WILMINGTON

RETURN OF 'TOXIC AVENGER' DOESN'T PACK MUCH PUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The only amazing thing about "The Toxic Avenger: Part II" (citywide ) is that 
Part I generated enough interest to warrant a sequel. In any event, Part II is 
too silly to be funny, and although good-natured in the low-budget Troma 
Pictures tradition, it is too violent to recommend for children who would 
otherwise be the most likely to appreciate it. It's not for nothing that it's 
been rated R. (Certainly most kids see much stuff as violent as this -- or more 
so -- but why numb them further?) 
</P>
<P>
You may recall that the Toxic Avenger started out as nerdy New Jerseyite Melvin 
Junko, whose tumble into a toxic chemical waste turned him into a tall, 
smudgy-looking muscleman with a hideously deformed, rubber Halloween mask-like 
face and head. The Toxic Avenger is a sweet-tempered do-gooder whose chemical 
bath has left him with a built-in evil detector. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Troma partners and co-directors Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz 
contrive mightily to get the Toxic Avenger (played by Ron Fazio and John 
Altamura) to Tokyo, possibly to make use of Japanese co-production yen. The 
pretext is that a conglomerate baddie (Rick Collins) who wants to turn Toxie's 
hometown Tromaville into the "toxic waste capital of the world" must lure Toxie 
to Japan, where a formula has been devised to render him powerless. We're told 
the potion is "too volatile" to be shipped to New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, Toxie's adventures in Japan are no more worth outlining than 
those that await him upon his return to Tromaville. Alas, Troma promises us 
that we haven't seen the last of the Toxic Avenger. KEVIN THOMAS

SENTIMENTAL 'SING' HITS FEW HIGH NOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Sing" (citywide) is a slack and sentimental tale in which a community in a 
dying section of Brooklyn marshals its forces to stage its traditional 
end-of-semester high school musical competition one last time. In his 
directorial debut, composer Richard Baskin reveals none of the style that has 
marked his film scores and other musical ventures. However, what 
screenwriter-lyricist Dean Pitchford has provided him is little more than a 
half-baked, heavily ethnic update of Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland's old 
"Let's Put on a Show" routines. 
</P>
<P>
Black leather-jacketed street punk Dominic Zametti (Peter Dobson) has been 
maneuvered into serving as choreographer for Brooklyn Central's final Sing by 
his canny teacher Miss Lombardo (Lorraine Bracco). She is guiding the project 
with the help of ace student Hannah Gottschalk (Jessica Steen) and fellow 
teacher Mrs. DeVere (Patti La Belle, who gets to sing only one song, 
contributing the film's liveliest moment). It's of little use that Dominic and 
Hannah acknowledge their feelings for each other in the film's final moments. 
"Sing" could have used that romance earlier, instead of such protracted 
skirmishing between them that when Dominic does his hot "Dirty Dancing" number 
his partner is, oddly enough, Miss Lombardo. 
</P>
<P>
Tall and sexy, Dobson is luckier than the rest of the cast. His Dominic is 
thrust believably into conflict about following his older brother into a life 
of crime; he can only be surprised by the decency and commitment represented by 
Hannah and his teacher. On the other hand, Hannah's conflict with her woebegone 
widowed mother (Louise Lasser, intense in a thankless role), whom she can never 
please, is too sketchy; we never learn why the mother oppresses a daughter who 
is pretty, poised, mature, a good student and a hard worker at the family's 
seedy diner. Bracco is never able to make anything close to the kind of vivid 
impression she made as Tom Berenger's down-to-earth wife in "Someone to Watch 
Over Me." 
</P>
<P>
The Sing is actually a Brooklyn tradition, started in 1947 by music teacher 
Belle Tillis; although now it's on the wane. Wouldn't you know that in "Sing" 
(rated PG-13 for language) the musical update on "Romeo and Juliet" staged by 
the sophomores, and the Atlantis fantasy of the competing seniors are 
elaborate, hard-edged show biz offerings that exude the glitz and razzmatazz of 
Broadway? With what these elaborate productions would realistically cost, 
Brooklyn Central could have stayed open at least another semester. KEVIN THOMAS

Home Box Office, which didn't win its first Emmy Award until last fall, now has 
three Academy Awards to its credit. Two short films that originally were 
commissioned by the cable-TV network won Oscars on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"You Don't Have to Die" and "The Appointment of Dennis Jennings" were "both 
very, very good films, real quality. And we're very proud of them," Bridget 
Potter, HBO's senior vice president for original programming, said Thursday. 
"But it's extraordinary to have two films in two different categories and to 
win in both categories." 
</P>
<P>
"You Don't Have to Die," which won in the short documentary category, was based 
on a book by Jason Gaes, 11, of Worthington, Minn., about his successful bout 
with cancer. "The Appointment of Dennis Jennings," a comedy about a mildly 
neurotic man (comedian Steven Wright, who co-wrote and co-produced the film) 
and his even more neurotic psychiatrist, won as best live-action short film. 
</P>
<P>
Each qualified for Oscar nominations by appearing either initially in 
theatrical release or at a film festival, Potter said. 
</P>
<P>
Other TV-commissioned films have won Oscars in the documentary categories 
before, including another HBO project, Lee Grant's "Down and Out in America."

CHEZ FRANCOIS: COOKING ON ANOTHER LEVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are restaurants atop skyscrapers that command colossal views. Chez 
Francois is a restaurant at the bottom of a skyscraper, the C-floor basement of 
Arco Plaza, and it has only mock windows, recessed portions of wall with coyly 
swagged drapes but no glass. Just as well; if you could see through these 
"windows," the view would be strictly subsoil. 
</P>
<P>
It's a very pleasant place, though, from the cavelike corridor, to the clubby 
bar, to the dining room with its pretty floral display. Ryo Sato must like it. 
He was the chef here years ago, before opening his own Chez Sateau in Arcadia. 
Now he has bought the place where he used to work, though he apparently 
recognizes the handicaps of the basement location, since he only opens it for 
lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Sato has one of the most distinctive cooking styles around, but one of the 
hardest to characterize. His menus are full of dishes you've never had, but 
somehow the more inventive he gets, the closer the result is to the old 
French-Continental tradition. It's solid, skilled cooking, but it combines an 
apparently random alteration of tradition with a near avoidance of flashy 
effects, as if it were unmannerly to be memorable. 
</P>
<P>
Typical of both his strong and his weak points is gazpacho de crevettes. 
Charcoal grilled shrimp rest on a cold tomato puree enriched with cream; it 
would be wonderful by itself, but little spoonfuls of zucchini puree have been 
added for one more texture, color and flavor. Unfortunately, it's a mushy 
texture, a drab color and a regrettable flavor. 
</P>
<P>
One of the memorable dishes is a roast saddle of lamb with a simple dressing of 
lamb juices and rosemary. The lamb is covered with watercress and rests on a 
fried cake of sliced potato -- it's wonderfully smoky. In its way, the breast 
of duck with orange and cherry sauce (the flavors blend surprisingly well) is 
memorable too. It comes with a wild rice pilaf mixed with bits of bacon, which 
is very good, and some delicious brandied cherries (though I am still unable to 
fathom the thrill of eating hot food with raw alcohol in it). 
</P>
<P>
More typical is Rex sole with butter, lime and caper sauce with tiny, 
peppercorn-sized croutons of egg bread and a lot of butter. Or large green 
ravioli with a tiny bit of duck and shiitake mushroom filling, arranged on top 
of a mound of spinach pasta with some sweet red pepper sauce around it -- sweet 
red pepper sauce being the mildest of '80s novelties. 
</P>
<P>
Among the usual pastry selection of black forest cake, Grand Marnier cake 
(actually, lighter and finer than most) and so forth, there is an unexpected 
winner at dessert time. It's a marzipan cake that looks oddly like a slice 
through a hamburger: the "patty " actually being chocolate; the "catsup" layer, 
strawberry; and the puffy "bun," cream. The marzipan layer is what looks like 
the brownish crust of the bun, and it's surprisingly moist and luscious. 
</P>
<P>
Now, that's worth going down in the basement for. 
</P>
<P>
 Chez Francois, C-floor, Arco Plaza, 505 S. Flower St., L.A. (213) 680- 2727. 
Open for lunch Monday through Friday. Full bar. Validated parking at 400 S. 
Flower lot. All major credit cards accepted. Lunch for two, food only, $43 to

I ordered the chicken in a pot. The waiter stood rigid, shaking his head. "I'm 
not telling you not to order it . . . " he said, although clearly he was. 
"That's left over from the old menu -- we just put it there for people who 
remember the old restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
For people who don't, he seemed to be saying, there were better things. And 
there were: the food at the new Dining Room in the Regent Beverly Wilshire 
Hotel, 9500 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills, (213) 275-5200 is surprisingly 
modern for such a stuffy setting. The room has been redone so that it is all 
dark woods and painted walls, but the menu is pure California-French. You can 
eat ravioli of ricotta and artichokes, lobster salad made with apples and sweet 
corn, grilled Norwegian salmon with Chinese mustard. Order roasted chicken and 
it comes with a wonderful puree of parsnips, a little spinach cake and a sprig 
of rosemary. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, if you don't want to eat that sort of stuff, there's always 
chicken in a pot.RUTH REICHL

In the mood for a cozy snack? Not in the mood to start making reservations? One 
of the most romantic restaurants in town has just opened the perfect place. 
</P>
<P>
It's called the Four Oaks Fireside, and it's the woodsy room downstairs at the 
elegant Four Oaks restaurant. The menu is small, simple and very sophisticated. 
There are terrines of foie gras, tartares of tuna or rillettes of smoked salmon 
and duck. There are wickedly rich soups. There's a full bar -- and there are 
extravagant desserts such as rum-glazed pineapple with coconut ice cream or 
profiteroles with honey ice cream and hot chocolate sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The point is to provide a place where you can drop in on the spur of the 
moment. Unfortunately the idea will probably prove so popular that before long 
you won't be able to get in without reservations. 
</P>
<P>
The Four Oaks Fireside, 2181 N. Beverly Glen, Los Angeles. (213) 470-2265. Open 
daily from 6-10 p.m. Appetizers $6.50-$14; desserts $6-$6.50RUTH REICHL

The industrial purity of Jill Giegerich's constructions is giving way to a 
startlingly baroque sensibility. At first, you may long for the clean-cut 
simplicity of the old pieces, so tactile and elegant in such unlikely materials 
as rubber, asphalt emulsion and cork. But with one overwrought exception, the 
recent work of this major young Los Angeles artist has acquired an intelligent 
complexity that has as much to do with an obsession with unlikely symbols as 
with the masterful -- and now often aggressively three-dimensional -- use of 
homely materials. 
</P>
<P>
The brain of Russian revolutionary V.I. Lenin -- of all things -- has been on 
Giegerich's mind lately. In a series of 24 drawings, collectively called 
"Lenin's Brain," she plays with a broad vocabulary of images that reappear in 
her untitled full-scale pieces. The sculptural head wedged into a shelf-like 
construction, the cerebellum-like clotted mass, the stylized clouds of smoke, 
the floating numerals, the rope-bound column and the grand apotheosis of 
airborne forms all add an inscrutable mythic element to Giegerich's basic 
vocabulary of Constructivist shapes. 
</P>
<P>
In the three-dimensional pieces, she continues to orchestrate flat and 
three-dimensional materials into rich formal arrangements, dwelling on the 
glassy, Turkish-slipper outlines of a squat bottle or the stabbing lines of 
double pick-ax shapes or the tactile rightness of wafer-thin flying cork discs. 
Xerox blowups that reduce images to atomized black marks resembling wood-grain 
or snakeskin are other persistent features of these works. 
</P>
<P>
But the plywood surfaces also hold real vases with peeling paint, burnt 
industrial-sized spools of thread and -- in one immense and overly turgid 
end-of-civilization extravaganza -- dripping lighted candelabra, burned wreaths 
and tumbling architectural elements. Absurdly grandiose even as an ironic 
gesture, this piece is just about the only dubious element in a dazzlingly 
fecund body of work. (Margo Leavin Gallery, 812 N. Robertson Blvd., to April 
22.) CATHY CURTIS

Swirling patches of color move with gestural force to make Diana Wong's 
paintings resemble electric, underwater landscape. These abstracted depths are 
garishly bright. Vibrant color moves in large swathes that occasionally seem 
almost hallucinogenic as they reverberate with the intense colors of tropical 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
Amid all this flash Wong's play with pictorial space forms something of a 
calming undercurrent as her suggestions of deep water are countermanded by 
paint handling that stops the viewer right at the surface. Wong makes the 
paintings by spreading gobs of enamel then overpainting with thin washes of 
opaque acrylic that lift and separate. Washes form a much-needed cosmetic net 
uniting the disjointed shapes underneath. 
</P>
<P>
But the power of the submerged shapes are frequently hard for Wong to contain. 
The thick paint distractingly ripples the illusionary surface. Color can't hold 
all the happenstance in check. Only in the more sedate black and yellow diptych 
of the "Beyond" series with its solid arch and black side panel is there a 
sense of harmony between image and surface. In this painting the thick 
squiggles and random cracking at last find a cohesive structure to hang onto.

"Life in a Day of Black L.A." brings together the work of a dozen or so black 
photographers who roamed the city on Martin Luther King's birthday in 1988 and 
for 24 hours made on-the-spot black-and-white photo portraits of the black 
community in action. A wonderful foil to the utterly one-sided (if 
inspirational) view of black life that the Cosby Show offers where the greatest 
struggle folks face is to be fashionably hip, these photos offer a view of 
L.A.'s blacks as responsible parents, aspiring professionals, superficial 
yuppies, teens caught in the throes of growing pains. Some images are brutal, 
others are tame; all are honest. 
</P>
<P>
The project was conceived and executed in just a few days, and that may account 
for too quick curatorial decisions and the fact that many works don't rise 
above family photo-album quality. Certain names are repeatedly linked with 
technically exact, penetrating works. In one photo after another, Don Cropper 
proves himself a portraitist of first rank, showing us a bright-eyed, dignified 
man with gray peppered hair, spectacles and winter neck scarf. Cropper's photo 
of a streetwise teen couple locked in evening shadows, standing a small 
distance apart but leaning toward each other as if to close the space, is alone 
worth the visit. Karen Kennedy's athlete stretches horizontally, echoing the 
rows of empty bleachers that all but obscure him. Calvin Hicks' gentlemanly 
curio dealer and Michael Jones' shots of romping elementary school children are 
among other works that stand out. (Black Gallery, 107 Santa Barbara Plaza, to 
May 21.) MARLENA DONOHUE

It's hard to call Larry Gray's paintings landscapes. They are really skies. 
Luminous, misty, sfumato atmospheres all translucent color, with just the hint 
of a horizon line running along the bottom of the canvas to help us relate the 
swirling Turneresque effects to something in the natural world. 
</P>
<P>
Gray is a superb colorist celebrating nature in the tradition of the Hudson 
River School. Paintings here focus on the conflict between industry and 
wilderness as seen metaphorically in burning towns and war-scarred landscapes. 
In these pictures, more than in the past, the smoke from ruined cities huddled 
in the mud rises to color and thicken the sky's clear vastness into an almost 
tangible membrane. There is an overwhelming sense of awe to these images, both 
in the enormity of the sky and in the potency of the man-made impact. Like 
sunsets made vibrant by polluted air, there is a delicate dichotomy in 
appreciating their beauty -- a sense of their fatal magnificence. (Karl 
Bornstein Gallery, 1658 1/2 10th St., to April 15.) SUVAN GEER

Imi Knoebel is a German painter who follows in the conceptual footsteps of his 
teacher Joseph Beuys with intentionally bland-to-the-point-of-stark 
abstractions or installations that can look like boxes crammed in a room for 
storage. Knoebel drains works of any allusive content, any reference to 
experience, feelings or knowledge, locking us into strict perceptions of 
materials, size, dimensions and relationships of work to environment, or work 
to work. This sounds like a redo of U.S. Minimalism, but it has a neo-German 
twist. Judd and company produced glistening industrial-looking ivory towers of 
inbred formal theory. Like Beuys' imposing stacks of felt, Knoebel's works lure 
us into highly conceptual ground with an everyday simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
His paintings are composed of white paint faultlessly covering plywood panels 
joined into large geometric groupings. In one work, two mirror-image, inverted 
L shapes hug two slightly unequal rectangles that are set above two identically 
proportioned ones. The whole thing reads like one self-referential structure, 
with Knoebel intentionally sifting out distractions to force us to see how line 
relates to line, the weight of this shape to that, the pressure of one angle to 
another and how the row of balanced works acts as figure while the gallery 
space is ground. 
</P>
<P>
This can be an enlightening but ultimately dry adventure; the pieces get good 
when you cast off Knoebel's will to control and just let the paintings wash 
over you in all their hypnotic Malevich stillness. (Fred Hoffman Gallery, 912 
Colorado St., to April 22.) MARLENA DONOHUE

It's a good weekend to go continental. The winner of the 1987 Academy Award for 
best foreign film, "Babette's Feast" (Orion, $79.98, G), is a Danish drama 
about a vicar's daughter who prepares a special meal for a one-time beau. 
Gabriel Axel wrote and directed. "A delectable fable told with passion, 
intelligence and sumptuousness," Sheila Benson wrote in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Also nominated for last year's foreign film Oscar, "Au Revoir les Enfants" 
(Orion, $79.98, PG) is an autobiographical film recounting director Louis 
Malle's childhood amid the anti-Semitism of Nazi-occupied France. "One of the 
best films of this or any other year," Kevin Thomas wrote in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
The domestic product isn't in the same league. There's that 102-minute 
commercial for McDonald's, "Mac and Me" (Orion, $89.98, G), which is, Michael 
Wilmington wrote in The Times, "an amazingly bald-faced copy of 'E.T.' . . . 
but it's 'E.T.' in a sticky wrapper." At least it might be suitable for little 
kids -- which is more than can be said for "White Hot" (Academy, $79.95, R, 
Robby Benson directed, Tawny Kitaen stars, subject: drug dealer), "The Bronx 
Executioner" (Cannon/Warner, $59.95, unrated, subject: apocalyptic androids), 
"Love at Stake" (Nelson, $89.98, R, SCTV's Dave Thomas stars in this satire on 
witchcraft) or "Twisted Nightmare" (TWE, $79.95, R, another "Friday the 13th" 
ripoff).

Speaking of little kids -- very little ones -- if you have them but don't get 
cable, then note that two half-hour tapes drawn from the Canadian series 
"Sharon, Lois &amp; Bram's Elephant Show" (shown on Nickelodeon cable) are now 
available (A&amp;M, $14.98 each). "Sleep Over" is a complete episode, a 12-song 
slumber party. "Live in Your Living Room" is a compilation of 11 songs 
(including the ever-popular "Eensy Weensy Spider") in a concert setting. TERRY

HOME TECH: CLIFFHANGER THRILL IS RELIVED IN VIDEO SERIALS 
</P>

<P>
In the 1981 film "Raiders of the Lost Ark," Indiana Jones, the daring 
archeologist, got himself into some of the darndest, life-threatening fixes, 
escaping just in the nick of time. 
</P>
<P>
Director Steven Spielberg, now at work on the third Indiana Jones epic, has 
said that the inspiration for the movie was those Saturday-afternoon 
cliffhanger serials he watched as a youngster. The spirit of those serials -- a 
staple in movie theaters from the '30s through the mid '50s -- lives on in the 
phenomenally successful Indiana Jones series. 
</P>
<P>
The real thing lives on too, thanks to home video. 
</P>
<P>
Republic Home Video has cornered the market on serials. Since the mid-'80s, the 
company has put out 16 of them -- six in the last year -- and has more than 40 
more in its vaults, according to Vallery Kountze, senior vice president for 
marketing. It plans to release six to 12 of those in the next year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Drawn from the catalogue of Republic Pictures, a B-movie outfit that was a 
major serial maker (along with Universal, Columbia and RKO), Republic markets 
them at $29.95, offering a complete serial -- 12 to 15 chapters -- on two 
cassettes. 
</P>
<P>
"They appeal to older people, who remember them as kids, and to film buffs," 
Kountze said. "But there's also a new audience of younger people who consider 
the serials camp and hip." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the sets are tacky and the acting is generally wooden. The big 
attraction, however, is the action, which they supply non-stop. The favorite 
form of action -- bloodless in those days -- is the fist fight. One breaks out 
about every five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Each chapter ended with the hero or heroine in some terrifying situation, on 
the brink of death. Do they survive? If so, how? Fans would come back each week 
to find out. The beauty of having all the chapters -- which run 11-17 minutes 
each -- available in one package is not having to wait to find out how the hero 
survives. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a sample of the Republic serials available on home video: 
</P>
<P>
"King of the Texas Rangers" (1941). Serial buffs and sports fans love this one 
because it features former star quarterback Sammy Baugh as a Texas Ranger. In 
defiance of logic, it mixes an old-fashioned Western with a wartime saboteur 
hunt. But in terms of action -- especially the big oil-field fire -- it's still 
one of the better Western serials. 
</P>
<P>
"King of the Rocketmen" (1949). Features Tris Coffin, who usually played 
villains, as the Rocket Man, a crime-fighter who flies because of a jacket 
equipped with rocket jets. His nemesis is the shadowy Dr. Vulcan, a 
major-league saboteur. This serial is notable for its well-staged fistfights. 
</P>
<P>
"Adventures of Captain Marvel" (1941). Starring Tom Tyler as the comic-book 
character who was Superman's chief rival for fan affection. Captain Marvel's 
alter-ego, Billy Batson, shouted, "Shazam!," turning him into the invincible, 
caped crime-fighter. With some remarkably authentic flying scenes, this is 
considered one of the best serials ever. 
</P>
<P>
"Nyoka and the Tigermen" (1942). Kay Aldredge plays Nyoka, who's battling the 
pretty but evil Vultura in North Africa. The film includes a hair-raising 
collapsing rope-bridge sequence, with acrobatic Nyoka barely escaping alive. 
</P>
<P>
"The Masked Marvel" (1943). Tom Steele, as the hero, battles Sakima, an evil 
Japanese agent. It is awash with flag-waving patriotism and the kind of odious 
Japanese stereotypes that were prevalent in wartime movies. 
</P>
<P>
"Spy Smasher" (1942). Kane Richmond plays another comic-book hero who's 
combating saboteurs, this time The Mask and his gang. The production values are 
far above the norm. Features some of the greatest escape sequences in the 
serials genre. 
</P>
<P>
"Son of Zorro" (1947) George Turner, as the masked avenger, fights an outlaw 
gang in the post-Civil War West. Most of the Western serials were sub-par, but 
this one, full of bang-up fight scenes, is well above average.

CD CORNER: BASEBALL HITS ON RHINO INCLUDE FOUR BONUSES

 -- "The Ball Game," Sister Wynona Carr 
</P>
<P>
Rock 'n' roll is becoming as much a part of baseball as peanuts and Cracker 
Jack. 
</P>
<P>
Countless ballparks and telecasts use baseball-related songs such as John 
Fogerty's "Centerfield" and Bruce Springsteen's "Glory Days" to add to the 
atmosphere between innings. 
</P>
<P>
So why hasn't someone come up with an album of baseball songs? 
</P>
<P>
Noticing the oversight, Richard Foos, president of Rhino Records, and James 
Austin, the record label's associate artists and repertoire director, have put 
together a collection of baseball songs and other nostalgic touches. 
</P>
<P>
Working with Warner Fusselle, author of "Baseball: A Laughing Matter," the 
Rhino pair discovered there probably have been more than 1,000 baseball 
recordings -- from rock and soul to pop and rap. 
</P>
<P>
In putting together "Baseball's Greatest Hits," Austin and Foos weren't able to 
obtain the rights to everything they wanted (especially "Centerfield"), but 
they did come up with such musical gems as Terry Cashman's "Willie, Mickey 
&amp; the Duke," singer-songwriter Steve Goodman's sweet and sentimental "A 
Dying Cub Fan's Last Request" and salutes to baseball greats Joe DiMaggio, 
Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays. The latter two recordings (Teresa Brewer's "I 
Love Mickey" from 1956 and the Treniers' "Say Hey" from 1954) even feature 
cameo spots by the sluggers. 
</P>
<P>
Among the non-musical classics: Abbott &amp; Costello's "Who's on First" comedy 
routine, Lou Gehrig's 1939 farewell speech and manager Tommy Lasorda's X-rated 
reaction when a reporter asks his opinion of Dave Kingman's three home-run 
performance against the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are two versions of "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" (an 
instrumental excerpt of a 1983 recording by Doc and Merle Watson, and a 1982 
parody by Tom Chalkley in the style of Bruce Springsteen) and a 1909 recitation 
by DeWolf Hopper of "Casey at the Bat." 
</P>
<P>
While all these selections are among the 18 entries on the vinyl and cassette 
copies of "Baseball's Greatest Hits," the CD copies contain four bonus tracks, 
including what may be the album's real find: Sister Wynona Carr's "The Ball 
Game." 
</P>
<P>
A gospel singer once associated with Mahalia Jackson and the Wings Over Jordan 
choir, Carr wrote and recorded "The Ball Game" in 1953 for Specialty, the Los 
Angeles record company that was also home of Little Richard. The song was a 
gospel hit in 1955, but most fans will be hearing it for the first time on the 
album. 
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the media reaction to the album (talk show host Larry King 
devoted an hour to it on his radio show this week and MTV plans to air four 
videos of songs from the album on Monday, opening day of the major league 
season), Austin is already thinking about a second volume. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, we were talking about potential sales of 30,000 or maybe 50,000, but 
I think it could go up to 100,000 by the end of the baseball season," Austin 
said. "I'm dumbfounded. I knew there would be interest, but I never knew there 
were so many baseball fanatics. We're now working on getting them into ballpark 
concession stands." 
</P>
<P>
Among the tracks Rhino hopes to feature in volume two of "Baseball's Greatest 
Hits": Fogerty's "Centerfield" and "You've Got to Have Heart" from the musical 
"Damn Yankees." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BUDGET REISSUES 
</P>
<P>
*** "The Very Best of Jackie DeShannon" (EMI) -- Like Bobby Darin, DeShannon 
has made sharp musical sidesteps over the years that left some of her fans 
confused. Yet she is a gifted writer (her credits range from "Put a Little Love 
in Your Heart" and "When You Walk in the Room," both included here, to "Bette 
Davis Eyes") and an appealing singer (her rendition of "Needles and Pins" 
conveyed the tension of a Phil Spector production). This compilation surveys 
her '60s recordings for Liberty and Imperial. 
</P>
<P>
** 1/2 "Patti LaBelle" (Epic) -- Producer David Rubinson worked hard in 
LaBelle's 1977 solo debut to keep the singer's melodramatic impulses in check. 
Even the taut arrangements, however, couldn't always make up for the uneven 
material. 
</P>
<P>
*** 1/2 Little Milton's "If Walls Could Talk" (Chess) -- Another of the 
celebrated artists to pass through Sam Phillips' Sun Records studio in Memphis, 
Milton Campbell moves convincingly in this 1970 collection from blues (the 
rowdy "I Play Dirty") to soul (the delicate "Baby, I Love You").

TV BROUGHT HIM FAME, BUT THE PLAY IS THE THING; 
</P>
<P>
GREG MULLAVEY STAGES DRAMA ON PREJUDICE 
</P>

Television may be where Greg Mullavey earns his money, but theater is what gets 
his juices going. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, his production of L. Nathaniel Wolfe's "Sweet Victory" opens at 
the Burbank Theatre Guild. "It's a true story," said the actor, who may be best 
remembered as Louise Lasser's husband on the 1970s series "Mary Hartman, Mary 
Hartman." Set in 1925, the action centers on Dr. Ossia Sweet, a black 
obstetrician who moves his family into a middle-class white neighborhood in 
suburban Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
"During the day, a couple of curiosity seekers" gather outside," said the 
producer. "By evening there's a couple hundred of them. They start throwing 
rocks. The police are called, but nothing's done. Inside, the family's 
struggling to lead a normal life, but finally they have to confront what is 
going on outside." Shots are fired from the house; a white man in the crowd is 
killed. The entire Sweet family is arrested for murder. 
</P>
<P>
"Clarence Darrow defends them," the actor continued. "This was his last trial 
of any significance -- right after the Scopes monkey trial. In some ways, it 
was just as significant. Never in the history of the American judicial system 
had a black person gotten off after killing a white. But Darrow gets them off; 
they are acquitted by a white jury." 
</P>
<P>
The actor sighed. "The specter of prejudice lingers on. Not too long ago, there 
was a cross-burning on a black person's lawn. They chose to leave. But Sweet 
would not be driven out." 
</P>
<P>
When the project originally came up, Mullavey (co-artistic director at the 
Burbank Theatre Guild with Gary Blumsack) had thought to direct it, but later 
chose Allan Rich. "I thought he was the perfect director for it," the actor 
said. "He'd been under fire from McCarthy's committee, blacklisted in 1952. So 
he brings a special sensitivity to this kind of play. Actually, I felt he had 
more passion for it than I did." 
</P>
<P>
Mullavey also has his hands full with another stage role, playing opposite 
Allen Garfield in Dennis Manuel's "Pops" (opening April 27), a co-production of 
the Burbank Theatre Guild and Armina Shepherd at the Richmond Shepherd Theatre 
in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like 'A View From the Bridge,' only more intense," he said. "The story's 
about a father and son -- and the son's becoming like the father, even though 
he doesn't want to be. The father -- he's like the local mob -- runs a 
whorehouse. The mother has left. . . . Actually we find out that he's sold her 
to a friend. I play his sidekick, a real seamy guy. It's a part I'd never 
played before. I'm not right looks-wise, but I really wanted to do it. I even 
auditioned for them to prove that I could." 
</P>
<P>
The stage work, Mullavey said, has served as a welcome retreat from the 
emotional slings and arrows of the commercial arena. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be if I didn't get a studio job, it was the end of the world. I'd 
be a basket case, devastated for two weeks. My sanity's a lot better now -- and 
that's because of theater. Doing it takes the edge off everything else. It 
gives me a place to put my creative energy. Even though I don't get paid, it's 
worth it. It's also turning out great for other things: inspiring me to write 
stuff, to say something." 
</P>
<P>
Mullavey just completed one such project, a proposed sitcom he wrote with 
daughter Allison, 14, the product of his 18-year marriage to actress Meredith 
MacRae (the daughter of Gordon and Sheila MacRae). 
</P>
<P>
"Did she have a normal growing up?" the actor asked rhetorically. "I don't 
think so. People have come and gone in her life too much. And unfortunately, 
her mother and I are going through a divorce, which is not terribly terrific. I 
wish it hadn't happened. But people want what they want. They want to change 
and you say OK. I was miserable about it for a year; I'm better now. But it 
takes awhile, longer than you'd think." 
</P>
<P>
Born in upstate New York, Mullavey moved to Los Angeles when the Dodgers did -- 
his father was the team's first base coach. Although he majored in philosophy 
at UCLA, it was acting that consumed him. "I got rich for a while," he said of 
his early successes. "I was making a lot of money -- and I still can, if I get 
the right break. I had four series: 'Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman,' 'Forever 
Fernwood,' 'Number 96' and 'Rituals.' " He shrugged. "And that was that." 
</P>
<P>
Not necessarily. A decade after "Mary Hartman," Mullavey admits that people 
still recognize him from the show. "All the time," he said bemusedly. "It's 
amazing. Do I mind? Nah, it's fine. I'm very philosophical about things like 
that. One has one's day in the sun, I guess. And that was mine -- so far."

POSSIBILITY FOR 50% OF SOUTHLAND WOMEN; 
</P>
<P>
UNWED MOTHERHOOD GAINS APPROVAL IN UCLA POLL

Half of Southern California women would consider having children without a 
husband or a live-in partner if they were childless and approaching the end of 
child-bearing age, a UCLA social survey has found. 
</P>
<P>
Only 10% of childless respondents said they do not want children, with the 
majority citing lack of money and time as the main reasons they have postponed 
pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Social psychologist Belinda Tucker, who oversaw the marital questions on the 
survey, said the results reflect "some estrangement of men from family and a 
notion that it is acceptable to do without men. That's the downside. The upside 
is that people are more accepting of a range of family alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
Questions about love and marriage were added this year to the university's 
annual Southern California Social Survey, which measures changing attitudes in 
Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
The questions were added, Tucker said, "because marriage behavior has changed 
so dramatically in the last 20 years. More Americans stay single or marry 
later, divorce is still high, and some groups are far less likely to remarry 
than others. We wanted to explore what was driving this change -- a fundamental 
shift in values or structural changes, such as a man shortage or unemployment 
(which makes men seem less viable as partners). We found that both 
contributed." 
</P>
<P>
Tucker said she had no data to compare the survey results with attitudes in 
other parts of the country, "but I suspect the findings would not be that 
different from what we would find in the Northeast. My impression is that the 
South might look different." 
</P>
<P>
The researchers -- who polled nearly 1,000 randomly selected people, ranging in 
age from 18 to 92, by telephone last month -- also found a high acceptance of 
interracial marriages and an emphasis on sexual fidelity as a key to successful 
marriages, both surprising to Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
More than two-thirds of the respondents said they would consider marrying a 
person of another race or ethnic group, while only 40% even "approved" of 
interracial marriages in another study six years ago, Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
In the current study, the factors most often mentioned as extremely important 
to marital success were fidelity, followed by lifelong commitment, love and a 
good sexual relationship. Two-thirds thought enough money important, but having 
children and coming from the same social, religious or racial background were 
mentioned by less than half. 
</P>
<P>
The survey polled attitudes, not actual behavior, which can differ markedly. 
While approval of unmarried mothers and interracial marriages has dramatically 
increased in recent years, less than 10% of U.S. births are to unwed mothers 
over 30 years old. Likewise, only 1.7% of U.S. marriages are interracial, 
according to the most recent statistics available. 
</P>
<P>
Marriage counselor Marcia Lasswell, a clinical professor of sociology at USC, 
said the "thought process is all the survey is really measuring. It's certainly 
not measuring what people have done or what they're likely to do." 
</P>
<P>
She said the attitudes toward having children is "sensational, but probably 
doesn't mean a thing." 
</P>
<P>
Tucker said that of the 446 men and 546 women questioned, 46% were married, 14% 
divorced or separated, and 7% widowed; 32% were single and 12% of those were 
living with someone. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy percent said they consider having children very or extremely important, 
while 63% said being married was very or extremely important; 79% (including 
men and women) said it is important to be married before having children. 
</P>
<P>
Singles, when asked why they were not married, cited most often career or 
school demands and not enough partners who meet their standards, followed by a 
feeling that they did not have enough money to support a family and were having 
fun "playing around." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
6% Not Dating at All 
</P>
<P>
Seventy percent said they wanted to get married or remarried, and about half 
said the threat of AIDS or other sexually transmitted diseases had caused them 
to change their dating behavior. Six percent said they were not dating at all. 
</P>
<P>
The survey, now in its fifth year, generates information for community leaders 
and policy-makers in the Los Angeles area by questioning residents on more than 
50 topics of social, political and economic concern. It is conducted by UCLA's 
Institute for Social Science Research under the direction of Marilynn Brewer. 
The margin of error in the survey is plus or minus 3%. 
</P>
<P>
Other findings from the survey include: 
</P>
<P>
Only 19% expressed "a lot of confidence" in the public schools, but 31% gave 
them a grade of "A" or "B" in a separate question. 
</P>
<P>
More than half said the environment in Southern California has gotten worse 
over the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
One-third believe all adults over 18 should be tested for AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
More than one-third said gang violence is a very or somewhat serious problem in 
their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
More than two-thirds said the quality of life in Los Angeles has deteriorated, 
but the majority was satisfied with their housing and felt it was affordable. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen percent of the respondents have been victims of crime in the last year, 
and another 42% think it likely or somewhat likely that they will be during the 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
Ninety-two percent of Southern Californians believe providing adequate services 
for the elderly is "a serious problem," and three-fourths said the government 
should spend more on programs for them. 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen percent are worried about losing their jobs in the next six months, 
while 38% say their family is better off financially than a year ago and more 
than half say they are optimistic that their financial situations will improve. 
They were equally divided, however, on whether the country as a whole will have 
good times or widespread unemployment or a depression.

COURT LIMITS INSURERS' RISK ON HOME DAMAGE; 
</P>
<P>
STATE JUSTICES RULE THAT COMPANIES MUST PAY ONLY WHEN POLICY COVERS PRIMARY 
CAUSE OF LOSS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a major victory for insurers, the state Supreme Court on Thursday limited 
the ability of California homeowners to collect for property damage partially 
caused by landslides, earthquakes or other natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
The justices held 5 to 2 that insurance companies must pay only when a policy 
covers the "predominant" or primary cause of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
Under most general, or so-called "all-risk" policies, coverage for disasters is 
excluded. But some lower courts had held that homeowners could collect when 
damage results from a combination of covered risks, such as negligent 
construction, and uncovered risks, such as earthslides. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Impact on Homeowners 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys in the case said the ruling will have broad impact among the state's 
7 million homeowners -- most of whom hold the kind of general policy at issue. 
Currently, there are thousands of claims, involving hundreds of millions of 
dollars, that have been pending awaiting the decision. 
</P>
<P>
But it will not affect those policyholders who have obtained coverage for 
earthquakes and other disasters at an extra cost. And its impact is uncertain 
on policies written in recent years that seek to specifically bar any claims 
where a covered risk is not the prime cause, lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, writing the majority opinion, said the rule the 
court set forth will provide "a fair result within the reasonable expectations" 
of both insurers and homeowners when damage results from multiple causes. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Stanley Mosk, who dissented along with Justice Allen E. Broussard, said 
the court should have held that coverage exists when both an included risk and 
an excluded risk produce a loss and are independent of each other -- neither 
setting the other in motion. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority, I must acknowledge, have succeeded in reaching a clear result: 
In this court, the insurer wins and the insureds lose. But they have failed to 
offer a sound rationale in support (of the decision)," Mosk wrote. 
</P>
<P>
David W. Rudy, an Oakland attorney representing the homeowners who brought the 
case before the court, said, "The sad part about this decision, in terms of 
general consumer impact, is that it imposes a tougher standard on the 
policyholder. It will reduce the number of claims that would be paid." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Norton of Los Angeles, a lawyer who has represented numerous property 
holders in such cases, acknowledged that the new standard imposed by the court 
will be "more difficult" for homeowners to meet. 
</P>
<P>
"These policies were sold as 'all-risk' policies," he said. "Most people would 
have thought they were insured in the event of a major catastrophe." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Less Oriented to Consumers' 
</P>
<P>
The outcome was not too much of a surprise in view of the realignment of the 
more conservative court, Norton said. "The California Supreme Court is less 
oriented to consumers than it used to be," he said. "This is one of the 
products of its change in philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
But Susan M. Popik of San Francisco, lawyer for State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty 
Co., the defendant in the case, hailed the decision, saying a contrary ruling 
would have resulted in vastly higher premiums for homeowners, denying many of 
them affordable coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"There were tons of claims being filed in precisely these circumstances," she 
said. "Where someone had a landslide, they argued that the cause was the 
failure to properly construct, even though the landslide was clearly the 
cause." 
</P>
<P>
Ellis J. Horvitz of Encino, attorney for a number of insurance groups in the 
case, said that had the court approved broader homeowner coverage in such 
cases, insurers would have found it very difficult to meet claims in a 
disaster. "The terrifying part was that if a major quake occurred, it would 
have brought a lot of insurance carriers to their knees," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The case was brought by Jack and Rita Garvey of Fairfax, Calif., who in 1977 
bought an "all risk" homeowners policy from State Farm that specifically 
excluded coverage for property loss resulting from earthquakes, landslides, mud 
flow and volcanic eruption. 
</P>
<P>
A year later they noticed that an addition to the home had begun to pull away 
from the main structure and that there was damage to a deck and garden wall. 
The couple sought payment from the insurer, but the company refused to pay, 
saying the damage was caused by earth movement that was not covered in the 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
The Garveys then brought suit in San Francisco Superior Court, saying that 
negligent construction, which was covered by the policy, was either the main 
cause or contributing cause to the damage. A trial judge held that if negligent 
construction contributed to the damage, the suit could proceed, regardless of 
the effect of earth movement. Later, a jury awarded the couple $47,000 for 
property damage and $1 million in punitive damages against the company. 
</P>
<P>
The insurer took the case to a state Court of Appeal, which overturned the 
damage award the couple had won. The appellate court in a 2-1 ruling said the 
homeowners must prove that faulty construction was an independent cause of the 
damage or that faulty construction set the damage in motion. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas' opinion was joined by Justices Edward A. Panelli and David N. Eagleson 
and retired Justice John A. Arguelles, participating by special assignment. 
Justice Marcus M. Kaufman concurred in a separate opinion. The justices sent 
the case back for retrial to see whether the covered risk -- negligent 
construction -- was the predominant cause. 
</P>
<P>
"If the earth movement was the (major) cause of the loss, then coverage would 
be denied," Lucas wrote. "On the other hand, if negligence was the 
(predominant) cause, then coverage exists."

BAKER CHALLENGES SOVIET LATIN POLICY; 
</P>
<P>
WARNS MOSCOW NOT TO EXPORT ARMS, IDEOLOGY TO CENTRAL, SOUTH AMERICA

Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in a challenge to Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev who visits Havana next week, said Thursday that the 
democracies of the Western Hemisphere are determined to prevent Moscow and its 
allies from using Latin America as "a dumping ground for their arms or their 
failed ideologies." 
</P>
<P>
Seizing on Gorbachev's "new thinking" campaign, Baker called on Moscow to apply 
new ideas to Central America by reducing its $500-million-a-year program of 
military aid to the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush has 
made clear that Soviet restraint in Central America would "have a (favorable) 
impact in terms of our overall relationship." Fitzwater said that the U.S. view 
has been communicated to Gorbachev, who arrives in Havana on Sunday at the 
start of a three-day visit, but he declined to say how the message was sent. 
</P>
<P>
Baker's remarks came in a speech to a seminar on Western Hemisphere affairs at 
former President Jimmy Carter's Presidential Center in Atlanta. The text was 
made public by the State Department in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tough Rhetoric 
</P>
<P>
His words represented some of the toughest rhetoric that the Bush 
Administration has directed at the Soviet Union after weeks of conciliatory 
statements. They underlined the tacit veto that the Soviet Union holds over the 
Administration's new bipartisan Central America policy. 
</P>
<P>
The White House and the Democratic-controlled Congress agreed last week on an 
approach to provide non-military support to maintain the Contras long enough to 
find out if the Nicaraguan government will conduct free elections, as it has 
promised to do. A continued flow of Soviet economic and military aid would 
likely stiffen Managua's response to the U.S. plan. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing an audience that included many Latin American leaders, Baker said: 
"Together we must send a clear message to others outside this hemisphere: This 
is not a dumping ground for their arms or their failed ideologies. We are 
looking for signs of new thinking. The Soviet Union now has an opportunity to 
demonstrate it in Central America. This is what the (regional peace) agreement 
requires and what the democratic community demands." 
</P>
<P>
Baker also urged the other democracies in the hemisphere to support U.S. 
efforts to pressure Nicaragua to keep its pledge to move toward genuine 
democracy. He said that such support is necessary if Central American nations 
want the United States to end its support for the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
"If you ask the United States to forgo unilateral initiatives and work instead 
in good faith with the democratic nations of Latin America in a new cooperative 
diplomacy to support democracy, then we ask you to join with us in good faith 
to turn the promise of that diplomacy into reality throughout this hemisphere," 
Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
"All those who advocate diplomacy and political solutions to the region's 
conflicts have a responsibility to prove that this is the best and surest route 
to achieve our common goals," he added. "We invite Latin America's democratic 
leaders to join us in this challenge." 
</P>
<P>
The presidents of El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua 
agreed earlier this year on a regional peace plan calling for free elections in 
Nicaragua by next February. The agreement also calls for the five nations to 
develop a specific plan for demobilizing the Contras who are now camped at 
bases in Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Baker also pledged a continuing U.S. effort to help ease "the 
weight of Latin America's foreign debt." But he emphasized that the Latin 
nations must also "move forward to take the necessary, but difficult steps to 
restructure and reform your economies." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady recently unveiled a U.S. 
proposal for debt relief, but he said that plan will not work without economic 
reforms in the debtor nations. 
</P>
<P>
"We must negotiate, case by case, the details of that policy to ensure 
continued economic reform, a real reduction in existing debt burdens and new 
capital flows in the future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said that Baker discussed the 
debt problem with Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez on the return flight 
from Atlanta to Washington. Perez, who attended the Atlanta symposium, is 
scheduled to confer with Bush on Saturday at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
The President plans to discuss the Central American peace process next week 
with Alfredo Cristiani, El Salvador's incoming president and Costa Rican 
President Oscar Arias Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the State Department sought to refute speculation that Washington 
plans to modify its tough policy toward Cuba in the wake of the withdrawal of 
Cuban troops from Angola. 
</P>
<P>
In a memo to all U.S. embassies last week, Baker said that the 28-year-old U.S. 
trade embargo against Cuba will remain in place. 
</P>
<P>
"Cuba is involved in a public diplomacy effort to reinforce the impression that 
improved bilateral relations are in the cards," Baker said. "Better ties -- 
especially with the absence of a comprehensive trade embargo -- would benefit 
greatly the failed Cuban economy and enhance Cuba's image and prestige. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. government is prepared to resolve problems with Cuba whenever U.S. 
interests can be served," he said. "But, Cuban statements to the contrary, Cuba 
has not demonstrated a serious interest in improving relations with the United 
States."

NEIL SHEEHAN WINS PULITZER FOR HISTORY OF VIETNAM WAR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Neil Sheehan, the journalist who uncovered the Pentagon Papers in 1971, was 
awarded a Pulitzer Prize Thursday for his powerful history of the Vietnam War 
-- a book that took him 16 difficult years to complete. 
</P>
<P>
For Sheehan, the nonfiction prize for his book, "A Bright Shining Lie: John 
Paul Vann and America in Vietnam," was particularly sweet. It came on his 24th 
wedding anniversary. And his wife, Susan, had won a Pulitzer in the same 
category in 1983 for her book on the crippling effects of mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
In the journalism category, the Pulitzer Prize for distinguished public service 
was given to the Anchorage Daily News for its coverage of the high incidence of 
alcoholism and suicide among native Alaskans -- a series that focused attention 
on their despair and brought about reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The prize for specialized reporting was given to Edward Humes of the Orange 
County Register for his in-depth reporting on the military establishment in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The Philadelphia Inquirer and the Chicago Tribune each won two Pulitzers. 
</P>
<P>
Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele of the Inquirer received the national 
reporting award for their 15-month investigation of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. 
The judges said the Inquirer's series aroused such widespread indignation that 
Congress rejected proposals giving special tax breaks to many politically 
connected individuals and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Barlett and Steele won in the same category in 1975 for reporting on the 
Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
David Zucchino of the Inquirer won the feature writing prize for a "richly 
compelling series" about being a black in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Clarence Page of the Tribune won in the commentary category for his columns on 
local and national affairs, while Lois Wille of the same newspaper won for 
editorial writing. Jack Higgins of the Chicago Sun-Times was given the prize 
for his editorial cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prize for Drama 
</P>
<P>
Among other arts awards, the prize for drama was given to playwright Wendy 
Wasserstein for her play about baby boomers, "The Heidi Chronicles," which 
appeared off-Broadway and will open on Broadway later this month. Novelist Anne 
Tyler won the fiction award for "Breathing Lessons," the sad, funny story of a 
couple married 28 years who are traveling to the funeral of an old friend. 
</P>
<P>
The prize for music went to UC San Diego composer Roger Reynolds for his work, 
"Whispers Out of Time" for string orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds was putting the final touches on a new composition for solo cello when 
he learned of the award. 
</P>
<P>
"The work's title was taken from a line of poetry by John Ashbery, a New York 
poet who also won a Pulitzer Prize (1976)," said Reynolds, reached at his Del 
Mar residence. "Like the poem, the composition contemplates the artist and his 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds' Pulitzer Prize for music marks the second such award given a UCSD 
music faculty member. In 1984, Bernard Rands won the prize for "Canti del 
Soli." 
</P>
<P>
"These two awards place UCSD in the forefront of contemporary music -- a real 
feather in our cap," said John Lauer, administrative director for UCSD's Center 
for Music Experiment. Reynolds founded the unique center for theoretical music 
research in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the Sheehans were opening their anniversary cards when a 
reporter phoned to announce that Neil Sheehan had won the Pulitzer. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels absolutely marvelous," he said. " . . . If you have been a reporter, 
it has a special meaning to you because it is a kind of judgment of your peers. 
I still consider myself a journalist." 
</P>
<P>
Sheehan, who as a reporter for the New York Times had incurred the wrath of the 
Richard M. Nixon Administration for uncovering the Pentagon Papers -- a secret 
Defense Department history of Vietnam -- chose as the central figure of his 
prize-winning book Lt. Col. John Paul Vann, who died in Vietnam in 1972 and was 
a critic of the manner in which the Pentagon conducted the early stages of the 
war. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees Symbol of War 
</P>
<P>
When Sheehan attended Vann's funeral and looked at the other mourners -- people 
from government, the military and civilian life -- he realized that Vann had 
been the symbol of America's involvement in the war. In the years that 
followed, Sheehan suffered a crippling auto accident and, according to friends, 
agonized over his topic. 
</P>
<P>
Sheehan said Thursday that the opinion of other critics -- Vietnam veterans -- 
also was enormously rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
"I get letters. I get phone calls. I get telegrams," he said. " 'You told it 
like it was. You put me back there. But now for the first time I know what it 
was all about.' The veterans are your real reviewers. They are your reviewers 
of last resort." 
</P>
<P>
The 73rd annual Pulitzer Prizes in journalism, letters, drama and music were 
announced by Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
The Courier-Journal of Louisville, Ky., won the general news reporting prize 
for its coverage of a bus crash that claimed 27 lives and its subsequent 
thorough examination of the causes and implications of the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Dedman of the Atlanta Journal and Constitution won the investigative 
reporting prize for his scrutiny of racial discrimination practices by lending 
institutions in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Reporter David Hanners, photographer William Snyder and artist Karen Blessen of 
the Dallas Morning News won the explanatory journalism prize for their special 
report on a 1986 plane crash. The team's follow-up investigation showed wide 
ramifications for air safety. The Washington Post and the New York Times shared 
the prize for international reporting. Glenn Frankel of the Post was cited for 
his "sensitive and balanced reports" from Israel and the Middle East. Bill 
Keller of the New York Times was honored for what the judges labeled 
"resourceful and detailed coverage of events in the U.S.S.R." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Raleigh Critic Wins 
</P>
<P>
The criticism prize was given to Michael Skube, book editor of the Raleigh 
(N.C.) News and Observer for his articles about books and other literary 
topics. 
</P>
<P>
In the photography categories, Ron Olshwanger, a free-lance photographer whose 
work appeared in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, won the spot news prize. 
Olshwanger is the co-owner of a wholesale furniture showroom in St. Louis. His 
picture showed a firefighter giving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to a child 
pulled from a burning building. 
</P>
<P>
Manny Crisostomo of the Detroit Free Press won the feature photography prize 
for his series of photographs depicting student life at a Detroit high school. 
</P>
<P>
Other prizes included an award to the late Richard Ellmann for his biography of 
Oscar Wilde and the poetry award to Richard Wilbur for his "New and Collected 
Poems." 
</P>
<P>
The history prize was shared by Taylor Branch for "Parting the Waters: America 
in the King Years, 1954-63," Branch's probing historical look at Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr. The co-winner was James M. McPherson for his book, "Battle Cry 
of Freedom: The Civil War Era." 
</P>
<P>
All the prizes carry an award of $3,000 except in the public service category, 
where a gold medal is given.

FEDERAL TEAM TO LOOK AT FUSION EXPERIMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DYE, Times Science Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal scientists from the Los Alamos National Laboratory will take sensitive 
scientific instruments to Utah next week to help analyze an experiment there 
that has been touted as a breakthrough in the effort to produce energy through 
nuclear fusion. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamos is one of nine laboratories across the country trying to duplicate 
the experiment. Although no one has reported significant progress, the effort 
has continued unabated, because if the experiment is confirmed, it could lead 
to an inexhaustible supply of cheap energy, with seawater supplying the fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists remain skeptical about the claim, but scores are eagerly trying to 
duplicate the experiment. There is a growing conviction that something must be 
there, even if it is not what the Utah team believes. 
</P>
<P>
B. Stanley Pons, chairman of the University of Utah's department of chemistry, 
and Martin Fleischmann, professor of electrochemistry at the University of 
Southampton, England, announced at a Salt Lake City press conference last week 
that they had succeeded in producing nuclear fusion with a simple apparatus 
that generated far more energy than it took to run it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Holy Grail of Research 
</P>
<P>
It is the latter part of the claim that has tantalized other scientists. A 
nuclear fusion device that produces more energy than it consumes is the Holy 
Grail of energy research. It is the long-sought goal of scores of researchers 
spending billions of dollars over the past three decades. 
</P>
<P>
There is some evidence now that the Utah scientists were correct in insisting 
that they had achieved nuclear fusion, but some scientists are convinced that 
something else -- possibly a chemical reaction -- must also have been at work 
if the experiment produced more energy than it consumed. 
</P>
<P>
The strongest boost Pons and Fleischmann have received since their initial 
announcement has come from a physicist at Brigham Young University in nearby 
Provo. 
</P>
<P>
Physicist Steven Jones has carried on parallel research at Brigham Young, but 
he has refused to discuss it publicly until his research is published in a 
professional journal in May. He has, however, just made copies of his report 
available to other scientists. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA physicist Robert Conn reviewed Jones' work and concluded that the Brigham 
Young professor had caused fusion to occur in a simple device similar to the 
one used by Pons and Fleischmann. 
</P>
<P>
"The fusion rate is higher than you would expect," Conn said of Jones' work, 
but not nearly high enough to generate more energy than it takes to run the 
experiment. Jones has never claimed that his experiment led to a net increase 
in energy, and he described his work earlier as merely of "scientific 
interest." 
</P>
<P>
Conn described Jones research as "carefully done, good, accurate, solid stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Jones' research would appear to be a partial confirmation of the work done by 
Pons and Fleischmann, in that it does indicate that some fusion is possible 
with the simple, table-top experiment, but it falls far short of suggesting 
that the world's energy woes may soon be at an end. 
</P>
<P>
What puzzles many scientists is the claim by Pons and Fleischmann that they got 
more energy out than they put in. Some of the scientists at Los Alamos have 
worked with both men, and both are held in high esteem. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who are involved (Pons and Fleischmann) are very good chemists," 
one Los Alamos scientist said in a telephone interview. "One thing they know 
how to do is to measure the power in and the power released (from the 
experiment). They are uniquely good at that." 
</P>
<P>
The relative simplicity of that measurement, plus the reputations of Pons and 
Fleischmann, have made it difficult to dismiss the claim. If the chemists have 
erred, they have erred repeatedly over the past five years, and their 
announcement would represent a blunder of staggering proportions. That, 
according to scientists who know them well, does not seem likely. 
</P>
<P>
It is one of the reasons scientists across the country set out immediately to 
duplicate the experiment. Some smaller labs have given up, but several of the 
nation's most prestigious laboratories are working intensely on the experiment. 
</P>
<P>
Some scientists were so intrigued that they spent last weekend setting up their 
own versions of the experiment at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, sources at the 
lab said. However, no one knew exactly how Pons and Fleischmann had carried out 
their experiment, so none of the hurried attempts led to success. 
</P>
<P>
The Utah team is withholding details until their work is published in a 
professional journal, a decision that has left other experimenters with little 
guidance. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, it takes some time for fusion to begin to occur after the 
experiment is started, partly explaining the delay in results. But the biggest 
problem has been the lack of specific details concerning how the experiment was 
carried out. 
</P>
<P>
That situation has changed at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, because Edward 
Teller, a legendary figure in nuclear research, stepped in and tried to fill 
some of the gaps. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Pons said he talked personally with Teller, who is 
the lab's director emeritus, in an attempt to help scientists at Livermore 
duplicate the experiment. 
</P>
<P>
Livermore scientists are now trying to verify the experiment, but there have 
been no reports of success. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Harwell Laboratory in England, a research facility operated by 
the British atomic energy authority, is also trying to duplicate the 
experiment, and Fleischmann is personally helping in that effort. Fleischmann 
is a consultant to the lab, and he reportedly even provided the apparatus for 
scientists there to use in their efforts at verification. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if an announcement there was imminent, one official said: "There's no 
scoop here yet." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the debate continues, both over the potential significance of the 
experiment, and over the way it was revealed to the world. 
</P>
<P>
The Utah team chose to hold a press conference rather than wait for publication 
in a professional journal, because news of their work was leaking out, 
according to James J. Brophy, vice president for research at the University of 
Utah. Brophy also said during a telephone interview that a research paper by 
Pons and Fleischmann had already been accepted by the journal Nature before the 
press conference was held. 
</P>
<P>
But Nature, published in England, denied that.

COURT LIMITS LIABILITY OF SCHOOLS IN SEX ASSAULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP HAGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Supreme Court, limiting the liability of schools for misconduct by 
employees, held Thursday that a school district may not be sued for the alleged 
sexual assault by a teacher on a 14-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
In a 5-2 decision, the justices ruled that while the district could be held 
liable for direct negligence in hiring or supervising a teacher, it was not 
responsible for acts that were a clear departure from his official duties. 
</P>
<P>
The employee's personal actions were not related closely enough to his 
authority as a teacher to warrant holding the district legally responsible, the 
court concluded. 
</P>
<P>
"To impose, in effect, strict liability in this context would be far too likely 
to deter districts from encouraging, or even authorizing, extracurricular 
and/or one-on-one contacts between teachers and students," retired Justice John 
A. Arguelles, participating by special assignment, said in the court's lead 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
The threat of such liability would also inspire rigorous controls on activities 
that would "negatively affect" the educational process, and it would make 
already scarce insurance even more difficult for financially pressed schools to 
obtain, Arguelles said. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling was a victory for school administrators and districts throughout the 
state that had supported the Oakland Unified School District in seeking 
reversal of an appellate court decision upholding a suit by the parents of a 
boy identified only as John R. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the parents had argued that the district should be liable for 
damages when an employee improperly uses his job-created authority against his 
victim. 
</P>
<P>
The district countered that such liability would be financially "devastating" 
on schools. The Assn. of California School Administrators, backing the 
district, added that it was illogical and unfair to punish the district while 
allowing the allegedly guilty party to escape economic loss. 
</P>
<P>
A separate civil suit by the parents against the teacher is pending, but 
criminal charges brought earlier against the instructor have been dismissed, 
according to lawyers in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret E. O'Donnell of San Francisco, attorney for the school administrators' 
association, said the ruling brought "good tidings" for California schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We have always agreed that if there is negligence, such as failing to properly 
screen employees, there should be liability," O'Donnell said. "But a broad 
ruling on indirect liability as well would not be good public policy." 
</P>
<P>
The case arose in 1981 when John R., then a ninth-grader at a junior high 
school in Oakland, was asked by his mathematics teacher to take part in the 
school's "work-experience" program, in which students help instructors grade 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
According to the parents, the teacher intimidated the boy into committing 
sexual acts with him, threatening to give the youth failing grades if he did 
not comply. The boy later told his parents about the incidents. The parents 
notified district officials, who informed police. 
</P>
<P>
The parents subsequently brought suit against the district, charging that it 
was directly liable for its negligence in failing to supervise the teacher and 
"vicariously" or indirectly liable for the teacher's actions against their son. 
</P>
<P>
The high court's ruling on the issue of indirect liability came in a lead 
opinion by Arguelles, joined by Justice Allen E. Broussard, and a separate 
concurring opinion by Justice David N. Eagleson, joined by Chief Justice 
Malcolm M. Lucas and Justice Edward A. Panelli. Justices Stanley Mosk and 
Marcus M. Kaufman issued separate dissents. 
</P>
<P>
Arguelles noted that employers were not liable when an employee "substantially 
departs" from his duties "for purely personal reasons" but acknowledged that 
there were instances where liability had been upheld. In one ruling by a state 
Court of Appeal, Orange County was found indirectly liable for a deputy 
sheriff's threats to rape a woman motorist. 
</P>
<P>
But the justices rejected the contention that the authority given a teacher 
over a student was tantamount to the power of police over the community. "The 
authority of a police officer over a motorist -- bolstered most immediately by 
his uniform, badge and firearm, and only slightly less so by the prospect of 
criminal sanctions for disobedience -- plainly surpasses that of a teacher over 
a student," Arguelles wrote. 
</P>
<P>
In dissent, Kaufman, while agreeing it was a "rare case" in which indirect 
liability would be warranted, said "this is such a case." Under the 
circumstances, he said, "it is unjust not to require that the district share in 
the liability for the injuries which resulted." 
</P>
<P>
The district sanctioned the work-experience program in the teacher's home and 
did not require that other students or adults be present, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
"In effect, the district-sanctioned program virtually guaranteed that the 
teacher could act with impunity, free from fear of interruption or discovery, 
fully assured of complete privacy and secrecy," Kaufman wrote. "Under these 
circumstances, it is not so unusual or startling that a teacher might seize the 
opportunity created by the program to make improper sexual advances toward one 
of his students."

U.S. AGENTS SEARCH CAPITAL LOBBY FIRM IN MONTOYA INQUIRY

<P>
Widening their investigation of state Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier), 
federal agents armed with a warrant searched the offices of a politically 
well-connected lobbying firm, the owner of the firm confirmed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators -- five from the FBI and one from the Internal Revenue 
Service -- searched the files of Governmental Advocates Inc. for more than four 
hours on Wednesday. The agents were seeking evidence of possible violations of 
federal extortion, racketeering and conspiracy laws, according to the search 
warrant, which listed a series of special-interest bills that either had been 
authored by Montoya or had moved through the Senate committee he chairs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Firm's Clients Affected 
</P>
<P>
Several of the measures affected clients of Governmental Advocates lobbyist 
Jerry Zanelli and the firm's owner, Hedy Govenar. Zanelli, a longtime friend of 
Montoya, is the former chief executive officer of the Senate. He has strong 
ties to top Democratic legislative leaders, including Senate President Pro Tem 
David A. Roberti of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
There was no indication that either Zanelli or Govenar is a target of the FBI's 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
However, several sources familiar with the federal investigation said Montoya 
is one of the principal subjects of the three-year inquiry into political 
corruption in the Capitol called Brispec (for Bribery -- Special Interest). The 
investigation came to light last August when FBI agents raided the offices of 
Montoya, three other legislators and two legislative aides. 
</P>
<P>
No state official has been charged with a crime, but in recent weeks federal 
authorities have stepped up their investigation of Montoya and some others, 
subpoenaing financial records and other documents and interviewing lobbyists 
and legislative staff, according to sources. The same sources said they expect 
the first indictment of a legislator to come in the next several weeks, but 
they cautioned that public corruption cases are often slowed by unanticipated 
delays. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya's attorney, Michael S. Sands, said he was unaware of the search "and at 
this time I have no comment." 
</P>
<P>
This week, U.S. Atty. David F. Levi, who heads the investigation, went to 
federal district court to obtain a warrant to search the files of Zanelli and 
Govenar, whose office is located across the street from the Capitol. Levi would 
not comment on the search warrant, which was ordered sealed by the court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Describes Document 
</P>
<P>
But Govenar, angry at any suggestion that she might be involved in any improper 
activity, described the document in detail to a Times reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Both she and Zanelli were interviewed by the federal investigators during the 
search. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the conversation seemed to be centered on honorariums and campaign 
contributions," said Zanelli, who cut off the FBI interview for a previously 
scheduled flight to Los Angeles. He said that he expects to be interviewed 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Govenar said she was initially happy to cooperate with the FBI, but became 
especially angry with federal authorities when she discovered that two FBI 
agents, posing as students wanting to know how to become lobbyists, had scouted 
her office a week before the search. 
</P>
<P>
"They told us they were students and they were very, very pushy," Govenar said. 
The agents were able to come up with a detailed description of the office 
needed for the search warrant. 
</P>
<P>
Govenar said that during the search she voluntarily opened the firm's files, 
allowing investigators to take whatever they wanted to, even before she was 
served with the court order requiring her to do so. She said that she did not 
want to accept the warrant: "It makes it look like I was uncooperative, like I 
have something to hide, but they said they had no choice (but to serve the 
warrant)." 
</P>
<P>
The investigators carted off financial records dating back to 1979, as well as 
documents on specific bills backed or opposed by the firm's clients, Govenar 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Focus on 8 Bills 
</P>
<P>
The warrant zeroed in on eight bills that Montoya authored or that were 
approved by the Senate Business and Professions Committee, which he chairs. 
</P>
<P>
For example, investigators sought records on a 1985 bill that Montoya carried 
for the California Assn. for Financial Planning. The measure, which would 
license financial planners, was hotly opposed by a number of other interest 
groups, including the Investment Company Institute of Washington. The 
institute, representing mutual funds and investment advisers, hired 
Governmental Advocates to lobby their position. The measure passed but was 
vetoed. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya has also carried legislation that would allow the state Board of Dental 
Examiners to regulate the use of so-called "conscious sedation" -- drugs used 
to put dental patients into "twilight sleep." The 1987 measure was backed by 
the California Assn. of Nurse Anesthetists, another client of Governmental 
Advocates. 
</P>
<P>
Federal investigators also seized the firm's files on Marina Lessees Assn., a 
group backing a 1985 Montoya bill that helped block efforts to incorporate 
Marina del Rey as a city. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the warrant sought records on bills that affected other 
Governmental Advocates clients, including three measures involving payments 
paid to employment agencies by job applicants and a bill that would exempt some 
agencies from licensing fees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Malibu Property 
</P>
<P>
The investigators also sought information about a 1981 Montoya bill to exempt a 
Malibu property owned by a Honolulu bank from restrictions under the California 
Coastal Act. The measure, which was proposed before Zanelli was hired by 
Govenar's firm, was introduced to get the attention of the California Coastal 
Commission, which was reluctant to negotiate a proposed development plan, 
Govenar said. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya last year apparently was caught up in an elaborate FBI sting operation 
when he took a $3,000 honorarium from Peachstate Capitol West, a bogus company 
set up by agents. The day after receiving the payment, Montoya voted for a 
Peachstate bill that supposedly would have helped the "company" build a shrimp 
processing plant in West Sacramento. However, the investigation of Montoya has 
gone far beyond his involvement in this one sting bill. 
</P>
<P>
Govenar, who became a full-time lobbyist in 1979, said her firm was not one of 
the biggest in the capital. The firm reported receiving a total of $360,000 in 
revenues last year.

BRITISH ADMIT THEY FORGOT EXPLOSIVE ON JET

A new furor over airport security broke out Thursday after the discovery that a 
British Airways jet flew with an explosive aboard for at least two weeks 
because police on a bomb-detection exercise for dogs forgot to remove it. 
</P>
<P>
The gelignite was tucked in a seat pocket in economy class of the Boeing 747, 
news reports said. Authorities would not say when the gelignite was put on the 
plane. 
</P>
<P>
The incident was particularly embarrassing to British officials trying to 
tighten security after the Dec. 21 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, 
Scotland. The Air Transport Users Committee, a consumer group, called it "the 
sort of carelessness we can't afford." 
</P>
<P>
Lawmaker David Wilshire of the governing Conservative Party said the public is 
always being told that British Airways is among the most security-minded 
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
"My mind boggles at the thought of what airlines in Timbuktu are like if this 
is the best," he said. "The worst must be mind-blowingly incompetent." 
</P>
<P>
The chairman of British Airways, Lord King, said the explosives worked their 
way through the upholstery and that a cleaner found them Monday after the jet 
returned to Heathrow Airport from Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Police Inspector Andrew Nielson said the gelignite weighed less than a pound 
and was four inches long and less than an inch wide. He said the substance had 
no detonator, could not explode by itself and "at the very worst it could flare 
up if ignited by fire." 
</P>
<P>
King said that even if the substance posed no danger, "that's not the point. It 
might have been something that was dangerous." He promised an investigation, 
adding, "If heads fall, they fall." 
</P>
<P>
The explosives were brought aboard the plane to test security but were 
overlooked by police dogs trained to search for bombs, authorities said.

SHAMIR LIKELY TO RECYCLE OLD IDEAS ON U.S. VISIT; 
</P>
<P>
AIDES SAY ISRAELI WILL PLAY DOWN HOPES OF DRAMATIC INITIATIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
During his visit to Washington next week, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir will 
offer an array of tentative, mostly old ideas to open Mideast peace talks with 
an eye to reversing American moves perceived as boxing Israel into talks with 
the Palestine Liberation Organization, top associates of the Israeli leader 
say. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir and his aides are playing down the prospect that he will propose 
dramatic initiatives when he speaks to President Bush. Israeli officials who 
once promised that Shamir would deliver a bold new peace plan are now rejecting 
the view that the meeting is pivotal. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they describe the visit as a "consultation" and shy away from giving 
the impression that the Bush Administration, by holding separate talks with the 
PLO, is in fact mediating between Israel and its longtime enemy. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir's inner circle is upset by the persistence shown by U.S. Secretary of 
State James A. Baker III not only in keeping up contacts with the PLO but in 
suggesting that, some day, Israel itself may have to negotiate with the group. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Shamir's Likud Party call Baker's approach the "velvet hammer" 
because at the same time that he pledges devotion to Israel, he tries to drive 
home policies that Shamir opposes. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States is weaving iron chains around us. This is not good," Yosef 
Ben-Aharon, Shamir's Cabinet secretary, said of Baker's moves. "If we say that 
Israel cannot talk to the PLO and the United States keeps talking to them, this 
applies pressure on us. If this is the course that is going to be followed, we 
are headed for a full-dress, head-on collision with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big blunder to open talks with the PLO." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arafat Renounced Terrorism 
</P>
<P>
Washington began talks with the PLO during the final weeks of the Reagan 
Administration, after the PLO chairman, Yasser Arafat, publicly renounced the 
use of terrorism and acknowledged Israel's right to exist. Baker maintained the 
contact, despite Israel's objection that talks with the PLO are tantamount to 
acceptance of the group's demand for an independent Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
But the American-PLO contact is not the only move that has upset the Shamir 
government. Baker also has called for Shamir to show "new dynamism" and 
suggested that Israel take one or more steps to ease tensions in the occupied 
West Bank and Gaza Strip. Suggestions published so far include the release of 
Palestinians who are in jail without trial, the reopening of Arab schools and 
the withdrawal of troops from cities and towns in the occupied land. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a senior Israeli official sharply turned down such calls: "The 
Americans don't need our gestures. They know we want peace." 
</P>
<P>
Shamir also rejects two other basics of American policy: that Israel should 
prepare to give up occupied land for peace and should stop building settlements 
in the West Bank and Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, the settlements have nothing to do with the peace process," the 
senior official said. Israel has built 137 settlements since occupying the West 
Bank and Gaza after the 1967 Six-Day War. About 70,000 Israelis live in the 
enclaves among 1.7 million Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
As for land-for-peace, Shamir recently told Israel Television: "I do not 
believe that a formula of this type must be sought." 
</P>
<P>
Although Shamir is keeping his exact plans for Washington quiet -- he has 
refused to have an open discussion in his Cabinet about his present policy -- 
he is expected to bring "ideas" that turn on ways to get talks off the ground 
without the PLO, his associates say. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Variation of Camp David 
</P>
<P>
The ideas all turn on some variation of the 1978 Camp David accords which call 
for a period of autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza before a permanent peace 
solution is worked out. 
</P>
<P>
As a start, Shamir hopes to organize a meeting among Israel, Egypt and the 
United States, in an echo of Camp David. The three countries would organize 
some way of finding Palestinian "interlocutors" to carry on further talks. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir would prefer such an appointed Palestinian delegation so that Israel 
would have a veto, senior officials say. If that idea falls flat -- and it has 
already been rejected by Egypt as well as any recognized Palestinian leader 
inside or outside of the West Bank and Gaza -- Shamir is also willing to 
consider some kind of election. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an acceptable principle to us," a senior official said. 
</P>
<P>
One idea being floated is a vote for mayors of cities and towns as a means of 
getting a Palestinian representation, senior officials say; Shamir is said to 
be "open" to letting known PLO sympathizers join in, although he has stopped 
short of declaring himself openly on this point. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal elections exclude large rural areas, raising the question of whether 
the vote is meant to find negotiators, or merely administrators to take office 
when autonomy is in place. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, talks with Palestinians, elected or otherwise, would lead to the 
establishment of autonomous areas, with the final status left for talks to take 
place within five years, Shamir says. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir insists that Israel must maintain control over the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip when a permanent solution is worked out. 
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's unwavering demand to keep all the land puts him not only 
at loggerheads with American policy, but with members of his own government, 
which is an uneasy coalition led by Shamir's Likud Party, with the more dovish 
Labor Party as a junior partner. 
</P>
<P>
Labor favors the formula of giving up land for peace, and Defense Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin, the party's No. 2 official, has outlined his own plan that would 
permit area-wide elections on the West Bank and Gaza to form a Palestinian 
peace delegation. 
</P>
<P>
Victory by PLO sympathizers would be tolerated, Rabin has said. Land turned 
loose at the close of talks would be ceded to neighboring Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Rabin opposes an independent Palestinian state or direct talks with the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli observers view Shamir's trip as a holding action designed to buy time 
until either the U.S. dialogue with the PLO runs out of steam or the Arab 
uprising on the West Bank and Gaza fades. Both would reduce pressure on Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"Shamir will try to avoid confrontation with Washington. As long as he feels 
that relations with the United States are not hurt badly, he will stand fast. 
Shamir believes time is on his side," said Arye Naor, now Cabinet secretary and 
a former aide to Likud Prime Minister Menachem Begin. 
</P>
<P>
Added Shlomo Avineri, a political scientist and former Foreign Ministry 
official: "Shamir has two contradictory items on his Washington agenda -- to 
stick to his old ideas and avoid a clash with Washington. To square all this, 
he has to use new rhetoric. He must talk the language of elections and say 
something like 'Everything is up for grabs.' 
</P>
<P>
"That way, at least, he can win time. If Bush doesn't like what he says, Shamir 
can promise to come back with something else." 
</P>
<P>
These observers view Baker's step-by-step approach as having a wearing, if not 
immediate effect on the status quo in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States has a strong impact on the debate within Israel," Avineri 
commented, noting that the U.S. decision to talk with the PLO encouraged 
Israeli doves and even some members of the Likud Party to consider such an 
eventuality. 
</P>
<P>
Added Naor: "In a sense, Baker and Bush must go over Shamir's head and try to 
convince Israeli public opinion that in the long term, giving up something is 
in Israel's interest." 
</P>
<P>
Direct U.S. pressure is unwise, the experts concur. Shamir, they point out, is 
a product of tragedies inflicted on Jews before and during World War II; he is 
already prone to distrust the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
"For Shamir, standing up to pressure is not a catastrophe. It's what he 
expects. It's his fate and the fate of the Jewish people," said Yaron Ezrahi, a 
political theorist at Hebrew University. "Baker would do well to present 
himself as a victim of public opinion that is beginning to look unfavorably on 
Israel. Let Shamir draw his own conclusions." 
</P>
<P>
Open threats to cut aid may not be realistic, the experts note. Much of the 
economic aid goes to paying off Israel's foreign debt, much of it to American 
banks. Military aid is seen in Washington as benefiting both sides and is 
probably immune from significant cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"If America had a credible arsenal of threats, it would have used them long 
ago," said Avineri. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE MIDDLE EAST AGENDA 
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, due in Washington on Monday, has called the 
Camp David autonomy formula outdated, considers U.S. opening dialogue with PLO 
a triumph of Egypt's own diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, due in Washington on Thursday, is 
expected to offer an array of tentative, mostly old ideas to open Middle East 
talks, with an eye to reversing recent U.S. moves. 
</P>
<P>
King Hussein of Jordan, due in Washington on April 19, could still be a pivotal 
figure in any Middle East talks, especially if the "Jordanian option" of a 
joint Jordan-Palestinian delegation should be revived.

MODERATION MAY HAVE PROVED FATAL TO MUSLIM CLERIC

The shy, bespectacled leader of Sunni Muslims in three countries, Abdullah 
Ahdal was no fanatic. Indeed, he demonstrated his moderate beliefs in his 
private life. He often wore Western suits and met regularly with Western 
diplomats. He even sent his children to Roman Catholic schools rather than to 
one of the several Islamic academies here. 
</P>
<P>
That moderation may have been the death of him, Belgian authorities said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Ahdal, 36, and an assistant, Salim Behir, 40, were shot and killed Wednesday 
night in the office of the city's largest mosque, and Belgian officials said 
the professional killings were almost certainly linked to his position on the 
controversy surrounding author Salman Rushdie and his book, "The Satanic 
Verses." 
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman revealed Thursday that Ahdal, spiritual head of the mosque 
and of Muslims throughout Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, began 
receiving death threats March 24 after he made a series of moderate public 
statements regarding the Iranian death sentence against Rushdie. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent television appearance, for example, Ahdal had criticized Rushdie's 
novel, which many Muslims regard as blasphemous and insulting to their 
religion. But he said he was opposed to the call on Muslims by Iran's Shiite 
Muslim leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, to kill the author and everyone 
connected with publishing and selling the novel. 
</P>
<P>
"We live here in a democratic country," said Ahdal, a native of Saudi Arabia, 
"where each person has the right to say and think and express themselves as 
they want." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Represented Mainstream 
</P>
<P>
In this, Ahdal represented the attitudes of the moderate mainstream here, a 
mostly Sunni Muslim community. 
</P>
<P>
Except for a brief flurry of activity during anti-U.S. demonstrations in 1986, 
after the American bombing raids on Libya, there has been little evidence of a 
significant fundamentalist Muslim presence here. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe these killings were done by Belgian Muslims," said Yohan 
Leman, an anthropologist and expert on the North African Arab communities in 
Brussels. "I think the killers had to come from outside." 
</P>
<P>
Brussels has one of the largest concentrations of Muslim immigrants in Europe, 
more than 150,000 out of a population of 1 million. North African women in 
scarfs and ballooning pants stroll the cobblestone streets of several sprawling 
neighborhoods. Mustachioed Turkish men drink mud-like coffee in all-male cafes. 
More than 30 mosques call the faithful to prayer. 
</P>
<P>
In some neighborhoods, such as Sant-Josse near the headquarters of the European 
Commission and Molenbeek on the western side of the city center, Arabs and 
Turks exceed more than 50% of the population. Forty percent of the births in 
Brussels now occur in these immigrant families. In some areas, 65% of the 
school children are immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
The Muslim community reacted with shock, rage and tears to the slayings 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"Nearly everyone was weeping during the evening prayers," said Abdullah Amid, 
one of the worshipers at the tiny El Azhar mosque in the mostly Moroccan 
Sant-Josse. "Those not showing tears outside were weeping inside with wounded 
hearts." 
</P>
<P>
"The killings were a shameful stupidity," said Arab taxi driver Achour 
Derkaoui. "What they did was against the teachings of the Koran." 
</P>
<P>
Ahdal was a respected, if not widely known figure in the community. He spoke 
classical Arabic and no French, which limited his access to the Arab immigrants 
from North Africa. However, he was the only Muslim leader officially recognized 
by the Belgian government, and he was directly involved in Muslim education in 
the state-supported schools, which have included instruction about Islam in 
their curriculum since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
On this level, Ahdal will be sorely missed as an arbitrator between the Muslim 
community and the government. 
</P>
<P>
However, his relatively liberal ideas were not universally acclaimed in the 
community. A petition against his stance on Rushdie had drawn nearly 300 
signatures. On the eve of his assassination, he met with other Muslim leaders, 
including a former religion education director at the mosque, to hear their 
criticism of his position. 
</P>
<P>
After the telephone threats against Ahdal's life, a police official said, a 
"discreet surveillance" was placed around the large World Islamic League mosque 
in the city's Cinquantenaire Park. Ahdal, his wife and six children lived in an 
apartment attached to the mosque. 
</P>
<P>
Officials could not explain how a lone assassin using a 7.65-millimeter pistol 
managed to slip into the mosque and kill Ahdal and librarian Behir, first 
firing into the nape of the neck and then into each man's temple. The killer 
escaped undetected shortly after evening prayers Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"In the wake of the assassination," Deputy Prime Minister Willy Claes said in a 
press conference Thursday, "protection measures have been immediately 
increased. Police have been asked to make preventive patrols to assure the 
necessary protection to the Islamic community and contribute to the peace of 
mind in that community." 
</P>
<P>
But crude graffiti painted on the walls of a monument adjacent to the mosque 
illustrated the underlying tension that exists here between the Muslim 
community and many native Belgians. 
</P>
<P>
"Arabs Have Four Paws," said one of the painted slogans. "Arabs Go to Mecca!" 
said another. 
</P>
<P>
For many Muslims, the killings raise fears that the rest of Brussels' 
population, including native Bruxellois and other immigrants, will become even 
more resentful and fearful of their Muslim neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"The killings have augmented the tension that already existed here," said 
Haslaoui Rabah, 37, director of a Brussels Arabic-language radio station. "They 
had the effect of pouring gasoline on the fire."

HOPES RISING ON EFFECTS OF OIL SPILL AS EFFORTS BEGIN TO RESCUE WILDLIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

VALDEZ 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three fishing boats loaded with a week's provisions steamed from Valdez harbor 
Thursday morning in the first organized attempt to rescue oil-smeared birds, 
sea otters and other damaged wildlife from Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
As the skippers of the Dotty G., Ms. Jeanne and Silver Bullet headed toward 
Naked Island, scientists expressed cautious optimism about the unfolding 
situation despite Good Friday's massive oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
Bird death has appeared low so far, an encouraging sign both for immediate 
survival of the animal population and for the long-term effects of the spill. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say there's a probability that the really catastrophic (effects) that we 
were afraid of, may not occur," said Bruce Wing, a biologist with the National 
Marine Fisheries Service. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To Start Cleaning Animals 
</P>
<P>
Injured animals were to be ferried by helicopter to a recovery facility in a 
small community college dormitory in Valdez. Volunteers expected to be cleaning 
oil-covered injured animals by this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually no one was certain that the rescue effort would succeed, or that 
earlier dire predictions might prove overly grim. Optimistic comments are 
invariably accompanied by warnings that every spill is different, that little 
data on this one is yet available, and that the Valdez spill is still in 
critical flux. 
</P>
<P>
"This thing ought to settle down in a week," said Dr. John Whitney, scientific 
support coordinator for Alaska's Hazardous Materials Response Branch of the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. "There's a lot of floating oil 
out there right now. It could come ashore very easily with minor wind shifts, 
or minor wind velocity changes . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The weather was a significant factor. Throughout the day Thursday, the sun 
dropped in and out of clouds, and it was windy and in the low 20s on the water. 
But light rain and snow were forecast. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we're pretty lucky with the north wind. It's going with the natural 
flow of the water out Montague straits. Big slugs of oil are headed out that 
direction, and if (the wind) stays up, it reduces the impact on the islands," 
Whitney said. 
</P>
<P>
Compared with other oil spills, the Valdez disaster has produced few early 
animal victims, and these evaded capture. The big flights of migratory birds 
through flyways here are weeks away, and an assessment released Thursday by 
John Piatt of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service showed that while as many as 
200,000 marine birds are in the sound this time of year, they are widely 
scattered in flocks of 100 to 200. 
</P>
<P>
All this has kept bird death low so far, and it has become another encouraging 
sign for the long haul. 
</P>
<P>
However, Wing, a Juneau-based biologist, is concerned about fish. Again, no one 
yet knows how the herring-roe or salmon catches will fare this year, at least 
until the spill stops moving. But as Wing pointed out: "Some of the long-term 
effects could be very localized. By that I'm saying that they could occur only 
in a small bay -- and two bays down the line, it might not have any impact." 
</P>
<P>
Wing said it might take some areas 10 to 15 years for chum salmon to recover; 5 
or 6, for pink salmon. 
</P>
<P>
Al Maki, senior environmental scientist with Exxon, owner of the tanker that 
went aground and unleashed the biggest oil spill in U.S. history, repeatedly 
notes that oil is "a natural material." 
</P>
<P>
While he conceded that, "certainly, it's not a natural material in the ocean 
where we've got it now," he said, "you have to remember that oil itself is 
originally the result of marine deposition. That's where it was formed . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"That makes it at least amenable to biodegradation. I mean, the environment can 
assimilate the material." 
</P>
<P>
Maki said that Exxon intends to see that long-term studies are performed on 
Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
Wing, observing the recuperative powers of nature, said that when a Mexican bay 
was swamped with oil from a beached tanker some years ago, the sea urchin 
population was destroyed. He said that quite quickly a bed of kelp, no longer 
fed on by urchins, took its place. Fifteen years later, colleagues who visited 
the site told him, the kelp was still in control. 
</P>
<P>
This is the sort of tale that makes Cindy Lowry, Alaska regional director of 
Greenpeace, particularly uneasy. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem I have," she said, "is that 10 years from now things may look the 
same, and things will still be alive, but I think we're going to see some 
resident populations like our killer whale population that aren't going to stay 
here. If there aren't any sea lions, there isn't food, they'll be gone." 
</P>
<P>
Researchers have identified just about every whale in Prince William Sound, 
according to Tom Loughlin of the National Marine Mammal Laboratory in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knows who's out there," he says, "who swims with whom, the resident 
pods and transient pods. Of all the animals (in Prince William Sound) they will 
be the easiest to assess" to see if the population has declined. 
</P>
<P>
Loughlin also speculates that the whales will mostly survive, though he agreed 
that they may move to other waters. 
</P>
<P>
Loughlin also speculates that the whales will mostly survive, though he agreed 
that they may move to other waters. He is more concerned with the pregnant sea 
lions and harbor seals of the sound, worried that premature births and 
spontaneous abortions could cripple their colonies for some time. 
</P>
<P>
But in the short term, the otters are most at risk. 
</P>
<P>
"To my knowledge, this is the first spill that actually threatens otters," said 
Randall Davis, an otter specialist at Hubbs Marine Research Center in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Uses Results of Study 
</P>
<P>
Davis has set up shop at the college dormitory and plans to use the results of 
his three-year study of otter cleaning techniques, using Dawn, the dish-washing 
detergent. 
</P>
<P>
Alice Berkner, who describes herself as "just a duck scrubber," also uses Dawn 
to clean fouled waterfowl. Berkner is founder of the Berkeley-based 
International Bird Rescue Research Center and is in Alaska to assist with the 
cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
The danger to oil-soaked otters is hypothermia. Oil destroys the loft, the dead 
air formed in an otter's fur, and brings the animal's skin in contact with the 
icy seawater. An otter has a high metabolic rate, requiring a quarter of its 
body weight in food daily. Under the stress of such great cold, an otter might 
have to eat half of its body weight (a near impossibility) to survive. With 
cleaning, rinsing and proper food, many otters can be expected to recover in a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
But Thursday night, the first photos of dead animals began appearing on the 
evening news.

A Cuban family stranded in Canada by immigration problems since December will 
not be allowed to return to its home in Miami while the family's application 
for asylum is pending, federal officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Benedict Ferro, district director of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization 
Service, said that he has denied a request for humanitarian parole for Carlos 
Fajardo, his wife, Bermaida Zamora-Powers, and her two children, Yoradlys Diaz 
and Yoandys Diaz. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was the result of new information that immigration officials 
uncovered about the family, Ferro said. "In this case, the negative aspects (of 
granting a parole) far outweighed the evidence on their behalf," he said. Ferro 
would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
The family has been stranded in Ontario since Dec. 23, when it crossed the 
border to view Niagara Falls from the Canadian side and was denied permission 
to return to the United States because of what officials said is a history of 
immigration fraud.

NUCLEAR ARMS PLANT OPERATOR OFFERED BONUSES

For the first time since its Savannah River nuclear weapons plant was built in 
1950, the Energy Department is offering performance bonuses and a guaranteed 
base fee to the plant's operator, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
William Kaspar, manager of the department's field office at Savannah River, 
near Aiken, S.C., outlined the payment plan to a group of experts advising 
Energy Secretary James D. Watkins on safety issues involving the department's 
nuclear weapons facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The payment plan, which takes effect Saturday with the debut of a new 
contractor at Savannah River, marks a significant departure from past practice 
in which E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. operated the plant for 38 years 
without any incentives. 
</P>
<P>
Kaspar said the new plan is intended to give Du Pont's successor at Savannah 
River, Westinghouse Electric Corp., a financial incentive to improve operation 
of the plant's three nuclear reactors, which make materials for nuclear 
warheads. The site also includes other facilities that support the nuclear 
weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
The three reactors have been shut down since last spring because of safety 
concerns. Last week, Westinghouse submitted recommendations on how to get them 
running again. 
</P>
<P>
Although Westinghouse's contract is for five years, the payment plan can be 
changed each six months, Kaspar said. For the first 6-month period, it can earn 
a maximum of about $7 million in performance awards, Kaspar said.

A judge on Thursday ordered a 17-year-old prisoner sent back to Alabama to face 
a murder charge and possible death sentence, rejecting claims that the move 
could violate this city's ban on capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Stephen F. Eilperin said that turning down Alabama's 
extradition request would make the District of Columbia ban "into national 
policy and turn the district into a haven for persons wanted by other states on 
capital charges." 
</P>
<P>
Eilperin gave Alabama authorities until May 1 to pick up the defendant.

Many of the Asian and Latino newcomers to Monterey Park, he said, have no 
feeling for America's traditions or its hard-earned freedoms. The statue will 
serve as a reminder, Hatch said, to immigrants and longtime citizens alike. 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone in this San Gabriel Valley community has welcomed this latest 
proposal by Hatch, whose earlier stances in favor of a temporary ban on 
immigration and the establishment of English as the official U.S. language have 
gained him notoriety. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Hatch wants the Washington statue to displace an existing City 
Hall sculpture that commemorates the 1984 Olympic Games, an event that promotes 
international brotherhood as well as athletic achievement. 
</P>
<P>
Said Councilman Christopher F. Houseman, "It would be unfortunate" if erecting 
the Washington statue was a reaction to "something washing up on our shore . . 
. so we have to put up this monument and make some statement." 
</P>
<P>
Hatch, a teacher at Bell Gardens Intermediate School, said he simply wants to 
boost pride in America. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like a coach in a locker room at half-time. We have to do something to 
win. This country is in more trouble than any time, other than the Civil War." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Real Motive' 
</P>
<P>
But E. George Ricci, a former Chamber of Commerce president, asked: "Why George 
Washington? And $50,000! How about Christopher Columbus, for heaven's sake? I 
wonder what's the real motive." 
</P>
<P>
If the statue's purpose is to educate new immigrants, asked Councilwoman Judy 
Chu, "then why don't we use the $50,000 to set up citizenship classes?" 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the immigration issue, Councilwoman Betty Couch said, is the more 
pressing question of whether a city struggling to balance its books can afford 
the luxury of spending $50,000 on a statue. And, she added, "I don't have any 
lack of respect for my country." 
</P>
<P>
Under Hatch's plan, a statue of Washington will replace a 15-foot-high 
sculpture of the Olympic torch and the five interlocking rings. Dedicated in 
ceremonies attended by about 4,000 spectators, the Olympic sculpture marks the 
path where a torch-bearing runner passed City Hall in 1984 en route to the Los 
Angeles Coliseum. Monterey Park hosted the Olympic field hockey competition and 
since then has billed itself as "An Olympic City With a Heart." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Standards and Values' 
</P>
<P>
"We're fighting to keep the city an American city," Hatch said, "not by face or 
by race, but by standards and values." When Hatch speaks of America, he also 
speaks of his town, a microcosm, he said, of the nation's immigration problems. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, when Hatch was first active in campaigns to declare English as the 
nation's official language, he has been a key participant in the city's 
continuing debate over immigration. Elected in 1986 as part of a slow-growth 
ticket, Hatch nearly lost his council post two years ago during a bitterly 
contested recall attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, when he took his seat as mayor -- a position that rotates among 
council members -- Hatch proposed a temporary ban on U.S. immigration to ease 
the burden that population growth puts on schools, freeways, hospitals, prisons 
and the welfare system. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the ethnic diversity of Monterey Park, with Asians accounting for more 
than half its 63,500 residents and Latinos another third, Hatch said: "These 
people need to understand why we are a unique nation. They need to gain the 
same pride in this nation that we have." 
</P>
<P>
The City Council on a 3-2 vote earlier this month did approve the statue, but 
no decision has been made on whether to follow through with plans to have the 
Washington statue created by Culver City's nationally known sculptor 
Brett-Livingston Strong, who once carved a Malibu boulder into John Wayne's 
image. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Olympic Sculpture 
</P>
<P>
And the council has yet to decide on whether to relocate the Olympic sculpture; 
the mayor is the only member who supports moving it. He believes that the 
Olympic sculpture is unattractive and should be moved across town to Garvey 
Ranch Park. 
</P>
<P>
Said Couch, "We're only going to make enemies if we take that (Olympic 
sculpture) out and act like it is unimportant." 
</P>
<P>
And Lily Lee Chen, a former council member who as mayor in 1984 spoke at the 
dedication ceremonies, said the Olympic sculpture symbolizes "one of the most 
positive reminders" of an international event in the city. "The thought of 
having the sculpture removed is something I cannot even comprehend." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of where the Washington monument goes, Hatch said this is one of his 
most important causes since he was elected three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I can think of no logical argument against it," he said.

DISNEY SUES OVER USE OF SNOW WHITE AT OSCARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NINA J. EASTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who would have thought that Snow White, of all people, would become the source 
of Oscar night's only major glitch? 
</P>
<P>
The Walt Disney Co. filed suit in Los Angeles federal court Thursday against 
the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, charging copyright 
infringement of its Snow White character and unfair competition. 
</P>
<P>
The famous fairy tale character, portrayed by singer-dancer Eileen Bowman, 
opened Wednesday night's Academy Awards ceremonies with an elaborate, 10-minute 
song-and-dance routine. But Disney contends that the character was used on the 
show without the company's permission. 
</P>
<P>
"We have great respect for the academy and for all that it does," Frank Wells, 
Disney's president and chief operating officer, said Thursday in a prepared 
statement. "We were therefore greatly surprised and dismayed when we viewed 
last evening's Academy Awards ceremonies to see that our Snow White character 
had been used extensively without our permission." 
</P>
<P>
Wells said the suit was filed only after the company asked the academy to 
publicly apologize for its unauthorized use of the character, which debuted in 
a 1937 full-length cartoon film. 
</P>
<P>
"If such a statement had been agreed to by the academy," Wells said, "we would 
have considered the matter ended. For its own reasons, however, the academy 
unfortunately did not accede to our request." 
</P>
<P>
Disney spokesman Erwin Okun did not provide any details of Thursday's 
negotiations with academy officials over an apology, except to say that the 
academy's offer "was not to our satisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Davis, the academy's executive administrator, declined comment, saying 
top officials needed time to assess the suit. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't gotten any official notification of this," Davis said, adding that 
he learned of the legal action from a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the academy is extremely protective of the Oscar name and statuette 
copyrights and is quick to object to the image's unauthorized use. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Number Kept Secret 
</P>
<P>
Alan Carr, who produced the Oscar show, had ordered that the details of the 
opening number be kept secret until Wednesday night's ABC telecast. 
</P>
<P>
But in its suit, Disney says a company representative learned of the plans 
early in the week. The company claims that the academy refused to respond to 
its inquiries until Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, the Disney statement said, the academy, "through a legal 
representative, denied to Disney that the Academy Award program contained any 
material deleterious to the interests of Disney, without revealing the 
academy's intention to feature Disney's Snow White." 
</P>
<P>
Carr could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Snow White character -- as portrayed Wednesday night by Bowman -- was 
created by Steve Silver, who for 15 years has used the character in the San 
Francisco musical revue "Beach Blanket Babylon." 
</P>
<P>
Disney files dozens of suits a year against individuals and companies that copy 
its characters, particularly in consumer products. 
</P>
<P>
"We sue all the time," Okun said. 
</P>
<P>
But Okun said the company, which won four Oscars Wednesday night, has never 
sued Silver over his use of the Snow White character in that production. The 
spokesman, however, did not preclude the possibility of a future lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"We look at these characters as the heart and soul of the company," Okun 
explained.

NO INTENT TO DECEIVE, SAY APPLE GROWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, Times Environmental Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Growers who supplied Alar-treated apples to a Southern California grocery chain 
said Thursday they did not knowingly deceive the supermarket into believing the 
fruit was free of the chemical. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Hughes Market decided to test its apples for Alar after a 
laboratory examination for The Times found traces of the potentially hazardous 
chemical in some Hughes apples. The store could not determine the growers who 
supplied the apples tested by The Times, so Hughes tested apples from its 
warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
Alar, the trade name for daminozide, was detected in three of seven samples 
tested by Hughes, and the store announced it would return those apples to the 
growers and continue testing on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Relied on Certification 
</P>
<P>
Previously, supermarket executives said, they had relied on letters from 
growers certifying that no Alar was used on their apples. 
</P>
<P>
But Tom Hanses, a partner in a company Hughes identified as supplying some of 
the suspect apples, said Thursday he was "not aware" that his company had sent 
Hughes a letter certifying that Alar had not been used. The Hughes test found 
Alar residues of 1.2 parts per million on Hanses' apples. The allowable level 
set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is 20 p.p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not issued a letter to them, to my knowledge, that all of our apples 
are Alar-free," said Hanses, a partner in Washington Fruit &amp; Produce Co. of 
Washington state. "We wouldn't be able to do that because not all of our apples 
are Alar-free, although they are under the EPA tolerance standard. There is 
absolutely nothing wrong with those apples." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Roger Schroeder, director of produce for Hughes Market, said that 
"to the best of my recollection" the store had received a letter from the 
Washington company certifying that Alar had not been used. However, he said, he 
could not immediately find it. 
</P>
<P>
Hanses, whose company ships under the "Independent" label, said some of his 
apples were treated with Alar this year, but that others were not. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not be using Alar in the future unless the attitude changes of the 
press -- although we should use it," Hanses said. "It is the best thing for 
apples. It will give the consumer a much better apple at no risk to his 
health." 
</P>
<P>
Alar is used to improve the appearance and extend the shelf life of apples. 
Without it, some growers contend, many apples will lose their crispness before 
reaching consumers. The EPA believes there will be 4.5 additional cancer cases 
for every 100,000 people who consume apples with average Alar residue over 
their lifetime. The agency is expected to ban the chemical next year. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes said its tests also showed that some apples sold under the "Marley" 
label had residues of 3.6 p.p.m. Bill Gammie, president of Jack Frost and 
Marley Orchards in Washington state, said his company wrote a letter to Hughes 
saying: "It is our sincerest intent to comply with your request to make every 
effort to ship you food that has not been treated with the chemical daminozide 
during the past growing season." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Experiment 
</P>
<P>
Gammie said he used Alar on five of his 3,500 acres in 1988 as an experiment to 
determine the chemical's benefit. The apples that were treated with the 
chemical were sent to market in September, Gammie said, and none of his apples 
have since been treated or will be in the future. 
</P>
<P>
He could offer no explanation for Hughes' finding, except that it was possibly 
an error. Schroeder of Hughes said the store did not run second tests to 
confirm the positive findings. "It might behoove us to run second tests on this 
thing," he said. Schroeder also said that it is "feasible" but not probable 
that the treated apples shipped in September could have been in storage until 
now. 
</P>
<P>
The third batch of apples found by Hughes to have traces of Alar came from 
Evans Fruit Co. in Washington and are sold under the label "Top Red." The 
company owns orchards and also packs and ships for other growers. Some of the 
"Top Red" apples had a reading of 2.5 p.p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"We have about 35 or 40 growers," said Jeannette Evans, who owns the business 
with her husband. "They tell us they do not have Alar on them. . . . We don't 
know what we are going to do at this point." 
</P>
<P>
Lucky Stores Inc., meanwhile, announced Thursday it will soon begin testing its 
apples for Alar on a random basis to verify claims by growers that no Alar is 
used. Two samples of Lucky apples tested by The Times also were found to 
contain Alar residues.

MAN KILLED; HE WOULDN'T GIVE UP CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Suspected gang members shot and killed a man for failing to give them his car 
while stopped at a red light in South-Central Los Angeles. In another attack 
prompted by an attempted theft early Thursday, a 19-year-old was chased and 
stabbed near Huntington Park by three men demanding his football jacket. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a third incident of violence left a 4-year-old girl hospitalized 
Thursday with a gunshot wound suffered during a relative's argument with 
another woman over a mutual boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent Rogers, 23, of Los Angeles died early Thursday after being shot around 
midnight, police said. They said two men approached Rogers' Cadillac and 
demanded the car as it idled at a traffic signal at Broadway Street and 
Florence Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers was shot after he refused to turn over the car, said Detective Don 
Watson. The assailants are reported to be local gang members, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A woman riding with Rogers took the wheel of the car and drove several blocks 
to a police station. Rogers was taken to Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical 
Center, where he died after surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before 1 a.m. Thursday, three young men believed to be gang members 
approached 19-year-old Felix Pena as he was walking home to Huntington Park on 
Clara Street. 
</P>
<P>
They asked Pena where he was from, a gang greeting, police said. Pena replied 
"Nowhere," and the youths demanded his Dallas Cowboys football jacket. 
</P>
<P>
Police said such jackets are among the type of athletic wear that is popular 
with gang members. 
</P>
<P>
Pena fled and was chased by the men, who caught him and stabbed him in the 
face, wrist and abdomen. Pena stumbled about half a block to a telephone and 
dialed 911. 
</P>
<P>
Pena underwent surgery at County-USC Medical Center Thursday morning and was 
listed as serious but improving, a hospital official said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had numerous thefts of jackets" in the last two months, Bell Cudahy 
Police Detective George Richards said, but this was the first violent incident 
in the Bell area. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually they give them up," Richards said. "That stuff can all be replaced. . 
. . I'd give them my jacket, pants, shirt -- whatever they wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, a 4-year-old girl at the Jordan Downs housing project was 
shot in the neck about noon. 
</P>
<P>
The shot was fired after the girl's 16-year-old relative and friends threw 
rocks and bottles at a car containing a woman who was vying for the attention 
of a man and considered the girl's relative her rival, said Detective Jim 
Dieli. 
</P>
<P>
The girl was listed in stable condition at Martin Luther King. The driver of 
the car, a 22-year-old woman, was arrested. The shooter is still being sought 
and police say they have contacted her family.

 ACTOR GENE KELLY ILL WITH PNEUMONIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Venerable actor and dancer Gene Kelly has been hospitalized with pneumonia, 
forcing him to cancel a planned show in La Mirada, theater officials said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"An Evening With Gene Kelly," the show set to open tonight at the La Mirada 
Civic Theater, was canceled after Kelly's agent reported the star of Broadway 
and Hollywood musicals had been hospitalized with pneumonia, theater 
spokeswoman Donna Heckenlaible said. 
</P>
<P>
"All we know is that Mr. Kelly is in a hospital with pneumonia and that the 
show, which was sold out, is canceled," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The show was scheduled to include film clips of Kelly's long career and 
reminiscences by the entertainer. 
</P>
<P>
The name and location of the hospital were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly, 76, is best known for his singing and dancing in films including "An 
American in Paris," which was the only musical ever to win an Academy Award for 
best movie of the year.

 SUSPECT IN MARSHAL'S SLAYING ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A suspect in the shooting death of an off-duty Los Angeles County marshal who 
was working as a security guard was arrested Thursday evening in Boston, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Kien Vinh Ly, 23, of Oakland, was arrested without incident at a grocery store 
in Boston's Chinatown, authorities said. Ly is wanted in connection with the 
murder of Henry Wong, 40, who was gunned down Sept. 2 while working at a 
restaurant in Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
Wong had ordered an unidentified Asian man out of the Savoy Restaurant at 301 
E. Valley Blvd. after the man created a disturbance and threatened patrons, 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
As the restaurant was closing just before 2 a.m., the same man allegedly 
returned, pulled open the front door and began firing, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Wong, the first deputy county marshal to be shot to death either on or off duty 
in the department's 30-year history, was struck in the head.

 GROUPS SUE TO STOP NEW-HOMES PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Environmentalist and homeowner groups sued Los Angeles County on Thursday in an 
attempt to overturn its approval of 150 homes on the former site of the 
Renaissance Pleasure Faire in Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit by the Sierra Club and the Las Virgenes Homeowners Federation 
alleges that the county ignored state environmental laws March 2 when it gave 
builder Brian Heller the go-ahead for an increased number of homes on the hilly 
320-acre site coveted by the National Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors voted 3 to 1 to allow Heller to build 150 homes on the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, charges that the county's 
approval was based on an environmental impact report that "did not evaluate the 
alternative of public acquisition of the subject parcel."

"The United Farm Workers started talking about pesticides back in 1958, and 
people just stared at us," Cesar Chavez, the union's president, said here 
Thursday night before attending a dinner in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
"We became accustomed to all the ridicule we used to take. Now, when you say 
pesticides, people know what you're talking about." 
</P>
<P>
Mariachis played in the background as a celebrity-studded crowd of more than 
450 paid tribute to Chavez and UFW First Vice President Dolores Huerta at a 
fete marking the UFW's 27th anniversary and Chavez's 62nd birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez, still thin and recovering from a 36-day fast last year, was animated 
and in good spirits as he received well-wishers at the Los Angeles Hilton. 
Aides said he is still under a doctor's care. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No. 1 Issue' 
</P>
<P>
Chavez said pesticides now are "the No. 1 issue with consumers and workers." 
</P>
<P>
State Department of Health statistics, he said, show that 52% of pesticide 
poisoning cases involving agricultural workers occur in grape vineyards. The 
UFW is boycotting California table grapes. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez said growers have tried to discount the boycott's effectiveness, until 
recently. He maintained Thursday that the growers are now saying in newspaper 
articles that the action is hurting them. 
</P>
<P>
The union, itself, is suffering from declining membership, and Chavez blamed "a 
lot of bad press" from newspapers sympathetic to growers. "If there are 5,000 
workers in an area, we can get 500 to join the union," Chavez said. "This 
doesn't mean we have no support from the others. We still represent them. The 
UFW sets the standard for all of the workers in the area." 
</P>
<P>
He said the union's plight is also exacerbated by lack of cooperation from the 
state Agriculture Labor Relations Board, which he contends is biased toward 
growers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Growers' Tactics 
</P>
<P>
When the union wins a representation election, Chavez said, the grower will 
simply dissolve the company and reorganize under a new name to invalidate the 
election. He accused the ALRB of not enforcing laws aimed at preventing the 
"illegal shuffling of companies." 
</P>
<P>
In some cases where the union represents workers, Chavez said, "we have been 
bargaining from four to five years" without getting a contract. 
</P>
<P>
David Arizmendi, a Chavez friend and former ALRB district director, said 
"growers have no incentive to bargain in good faith. It doesn't cost them." 
</P>
<P>
When Chavez ended his fast last year, supporters took up a sympathetic "relay 
fast." Huerta ended a three-day fast Thursday night and passed a symbolic 
wooden cross to her successor in the relay, actress Jane Fonda. 
</P>
<P>
Money from the $125-a-plate fund-raiser will be used for television commercials 
to air farm workers' issues, officials said.

S. J. DIAMOND: PROVING IRS CAUSED 'ERRORS' WON'T BE EASY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. J. DIAMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a well-played news story: Early this month, the Internal Revenue Service 
admitted that its telephone assistance people were giving taxpayers wrong 
answers to tax questions 30.8% of the time. But the agency held out the 
assurance that if taxpayers were penalized for any resultant errors on their 
returns, the penalties would be waived. 
</P>
<P>
Seems a very decent, human approach. It even reiterates last year's admission 
of errors and last year's promise to waive penalties. 
</P>
<P>
But don't count on it. There are qualifications and amplifications: The errors 
may not be errors, the penalties are unlikely, the number of waivers sought or 
granted is unknown and the chance of actually getting a waiver is unsure. It's 
like the old joke about the broken cup: I never saw your cup, I didn't take it, 
I put it back, and anyway, it was already cracked. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Test Calls Made 
</P>
<P>
The first haggle is the number of errors, a matter of some importance when an 
advisory service handles 38.8 million telephone calls and 7.4 million walk-in 
inquiries a year. In recent years, as the IRS's 5,000 "assistors," many 
part-time and seasonal workers, struggled with all the changes in the tax code 
since the 1986 Tax Reform Act, error rates as polled in popular periodicals 
went above 30%; a Money magazine survey last year drew 45 wrong answers to 100 
inquiries, 41 this year. 
</P>
<P>
The government's General Accounting Office has also, as requested by Congress, 
been making test calls to tax assistors since 1978, asking them questions that 
involve tax law -- typical taxpayer questions about IRA contributions, business 
expenses, kiddie taxes. In the 1987 filing season, the GAO found a 21% error 
rate; in 1988 a 36% error rate, and this year, a 35% error rate. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, the testing was done in concert with the IRS (which will 
eventually take it over), and the IRS, using the same 62 questions, found only 
a 30.8% error rate. The reason: The IRS judged an answer correct if the final 
advice was right. The GAO scored the whole process, including the "probing 
questions" posed by assistors. "If they quickly gave the right answer, but 
didn't ask the right questions," says Jennie Stathis, the GAO's director of tax 
policy and administration, "it would be (counted) wrong. We try to put 
ourselves in the position of the taxpayer." 
</P>
<P>
A question about qualified dependents, for example, should elicit probing 
questions about all five dependency requirements. One might assume the college 
nephew supported by Nebraska residents is a U.S. citizen, but the assistor 
should ask: If he's here from France on a student visa he's not a qualified 
dependent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Managers Monitor Questions 
</P>
<P>
The IRS response is that most such assumptions will fit the inquiry and 
furthermore, the testing situation is skewed: "Testers don't give any 
information unless it's probed for," says IRS spokesman Frank Keith in 
Washington. "The taxpayer will keep asking, 'What about this, and what about 
that?' " 
</P>
<P>
The GAO's questions, moreover, all involve tax law, and such questions 
generally constitute less than half the actual inquiries received. The majority 
are either procedural (what forms to use, where to send a return) or 
account-related (where is a refund, what does a notice really mean). Such 
questions are monitored regularly by IRS regional managers, who listen in on 
random assistance calls, taking notes and making judgments that might result in 
discussions with the individual assistor, a general tip to all local assistors, 
or required training sessions. They even judge question handling, i.e., the 
probing questions as well as the final answers. 
</P>
<P>
Given the emphasis and grading system, the GAO surveys, says Keith, are "not an 
indictment of the taxpayer service." As for the penalty consideration, he adds, 
one must ask "how much damage does a taxpayer suffer who gets the wrong 
answer?" 
</P>
<P>
The IRS doesn't know and can't figure out how many such errors lead to 
penalties for the taxpayer, but it must be very few. "Under what fact scenario 
could someone call, get a wrong answer and get a penalty?" asks Keith. Someone 
might be encouraged to take an unpermissible deduction, but they'd get a 
notice, says Keith, that "you can't deduct funeral expenses for your pet Shih 
Tzu: pay up, plus interest." Penalties, says Rob Giannangeli, IRS spokesman for 
the Los Angeles district, "are only assessed for failure to pay after you get a 
specific bill." 
</P>
<P>
There are penalties for making a "substantial understatement" of one's tax 
liability, but it's not a common situation, or a common telephone inquiry, 
since "substantial" means more than 10% of the correct liability, or $5,000, 
whichever is greater. There are also penalties for failing to file any return 
at all, but if the taxpayer is penalized for failing to file, says Keith, he 
can explain that an assistor told him he wasn't required to file and request a 
penalty "abatement." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Proof' Not Defined 
</P>
<P>
Alas, no one knows how many requests for penalty waivers grow out of this 
situation, or any other, for that matter. Such requests are made locally and at 
any point in the process -- correspondence, audit, collection -- and may be 
quietly granted at any point. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, and IRS reassurances aside, it's no sure thing that such waivers would 
be granted, given the number of people who would probably claim that "an 
assistor made me do it." Indeed, the IRS has never defined how a taxpayer 
proves that IRS assistance, verbal and undocumented, caused his error. One can 
only, says Keith, note "the day called, the person's name, the question you 
asked and any citation given. That information will be used by the person 
who'll decide whether it's appropriate to abate the penalty." 
</P>
<P>
One thing's for sure: The IRS's promise last year that it might also waive 
interest on payments in such situations has not been repeated. "We don't regard 
interest as punitive," says Keith. "It's a fee for the use of money." 
</P>
<P>
No wonder the story gets such play, with its apologies for human failing and 
assurances of good will balanced by hints that "Trust me" will turn to "Take 
that." Trouble is, nobody knows what actually happens. At least the IRS 
doesn't.

S&amp;L PLAN WOULD PUT COST OF $50 BILLION IN BONDS INTO BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Senate Banking Committee is preparing a savings and loan rescue plan that 
would put the full cost of $50 billion in bonds directly on the federal budget, 
the committee's staff director said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
That would dramatically increase the federal deficit for the current year, 
staff director Kevin Gottlieb conceded. But it would also save the taxpayers 
money in the long run, he said in a speech to the organization Women in Finance 
and Housing. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, devised by committee Chairman Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), 
sets the stage for a sharp conflict between Congress and the Bush 
Administration, which insists that the S&amp;L bailout have minimal immediate 
impact on the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, in several speeches this week, denounced 
as irresponsible and "stupid" any suggestions to place the full cost of the 
rescue on the budget. He argued that a surge in the deficit would frighten 
financial markets and drive down the value of the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Gottlieb, delivering a strong rebuttal on behalf of Riegle, fired back 
Thursday: "If it's irresponsible to save the public $4.5 billion, we're all in 
big trouble. The Administration should want to be a part of saving $4.5 
billion." 
</P>
<P>
The savings would result from the different means of raising the $50 billion 
that the Administration believes is necessary to close or sell insolvent 
S&amp;Ls and pay off depositors, whose funds are guaranteed by the federal 
government up to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conflicting Plans 
</P>
<P>
Under the Administration proposal, a new Resolution Funding Corp. would issue 
$50 billion in bonds, which would not be backed by the full faith and credit of 
the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Riegle plan, by contrast, the Treasury Department would borrow $50 
billion and turn the funds over to the S&amp;L rescue effort. The Treasury 
borrowing, backed by the full faith and credit of the government, would carry 
somewhat lower interest rates than the Resolution Funding Corp. bonds, and 
Riegle estimates the savings over the 30-year term of the bonds at $4.5 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
However, the $50 billion in outlays would all be crammed into the current 
fiscal year. Under the Treasury plan, only the annual interest costs would 
count as government outlays, although total interest costs over 30 years would 
total substantially more than $50 billion. 
</P>
<P>
From the Treasury Department's standpoint, the Riegle plan could have dire 
economic consequences. A bigger deficit could drive down the value of the 
dollar in relation to other currencies, forcing the Federal Reserve to raise 
interest rates to prop up the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. economic policies are already under fire from allies and trading partners, 
which want a smaller U.S. budget deficit. Such complaints will be renewed this 
weekend, when finance ministers from seven major industrial nations will meet 
here in preparation for the semiannual gathering of the International Monetary 
Fund. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Adamant' About Lowest Cost 
</P>
<P>
Gottlieb, in his speech to Women in Finance and Housing, called the Treasury 
Department's criticism of Riegle's approach unjustified. "I was incredibly 
surprised, amazed and disappointed" by Brady's insistence that the rescue must 
be kept off the federal budget, Gottlieb said. 
</P>
<P>
The Riegle plan will be discussed by Senate Banking Committee members when 
Congress returns next week from its Easter recess. Gottlieb said committee 
members in previous meetings had been "adamant" about the desire to prepare the 
S&amp;L rescue at the lowest cost. 
</P>
<P>
In the House, Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), a House Banking Committee 
member, is preparing a plan similar to Riegle's to finance the rescue as part 
of the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
In other activity Thursday, federal regulators seized nine more savings and 
loan associations in six states, bringing the total under government control to 
175 in 28 states. 
</P>
<P>
The institutions -- in Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia and 
Wisconsin -- had total assets of $3.5 billion at the end of 1988. Broadview 
Savings Bank of Cleveland, the largest, had $1.8 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. began the takeover program last month to 
control losses until Congress provides funds to shut the S&amp;Ls permanently 
or to find investors to buy them. All the S&amp;Ls remain open for normal 
business.

DEFENSE SECTOR STRONG BUT FEBRUARY ORDERS DIP 2.3%

<P>
Orders to U.S. factories for manufactured goods dropped 2.3% in February, the 
second straight monthly decline, the government said Thursday in a report 
offering more evidence that the economy may be slowing. 
</P>
<P>
Orders fell to a seasonally adjusted $230.7 billion last month after dropping 
1.2% in January, the first back-to-back declines since orders fell for four 
consecutive months starting in February, 1986, the Commerce Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Last month's decline was in line with other government reports that showed 
slower growth in February and with widespread expectations that the economy 
will cool off in this seventh year of its record peacetime expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"This confirms that February was a very weak month," said economist David Wyss 
of Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass. "It leaves unanswered the question 
of whether this is the start of the slowdown we're expecting." 
</P>
<P>
The decline would have been even bigger were it not for a 22.4% surge last 
month in defense orders, which are subject to wide swings depending on when 
government contracts are signed. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding the military, orders were down 3% last month. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest negative factor in last month's orders picture was a 7.2% decline 
in the transportation category, reflecting fewer orders for planes and cars. 
</P>
<P>
But even excluding the volatile transportation area, all other orders were down 
1.4% last month. 
</P>
<P>
The economy grew a robust 3.9% last year, the best showing in four years, but 
analysts believe that the pace will be closer to 2.7% this year, with the 
slowdown most evident in the second and third quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Factory orders had increased a healthy 9.7% in 1988 in part because of an 
export-led boom that showed signs of stalling late in the year. 
</P>
<P>
The back-to-back declines in orders during the first two months of 1989 may 
suggest that the Fed's slowdown campaign is taking effect, Wyss said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fed's been raising rates for a year now," he said. "It's about time we 
started to see it in the real growth (statistics)." 
</P>
<P>
In the key category of non-defense capital goods, considered a good indicator 
of industry investment plans, orders dropped 8.2% in February to $37.1 billion 
after rising 2.3% in January. 
</P>
<P>
Orders for "big ticket" durable goods, items expected to last three years or 
more, were down 3.3% to a seasonally adjusted $124.2 billion after dropping 
2.8% during the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
Declines were recorded in nearly all major industries, including a 3.2% drop in 
orders for primary metals, with the steel industry accounting for much of that 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
Demand for non-durable goods was down 1% to $106.5 billion last month, with the 
largest decreases coming in orders for chemicals and rubber and plastics 
products. 
</P>
<P>
Shipments of manufactured goods were down 1.7% to a seasonally adjusted $227.6 
billion in February. It was the biggest decline since March, 1986, when 
shipments were down 2.4%. 
</P>

PENNEY WILL FOLD CABLE SHOPPING EXPERIMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
J. C. Penney said Thursday that it has decided to pull the plug on Telaction, 
its much ballyhooed interactive home shopping service that was being tested in 
the Chicago area. 
</P>
<P>
The decision deals another blow to the home shopping industry, which has fallen 
far short of early expectations that it would account for as much as $8 billion 
in retail sales by 1990. Recently, observers' projections have been sharply 
reduced, with Paul Kagan Associates, a media research firm in Carmel, 
forecasting that the shop-at-home industry will account for only about $2 
billion in sales in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Penney Vice Chairman Robert B. Gill said in a statement that the planned 
closing of Telaction on April 7 does not "reflect a disenchantment" with home 
shopping by cable. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Penney took over a money-losing, shop-at-home channel 
operated by Shop Television Network of Los Angeles. Next month, the channel 
will be renamed the J. C. Penney Television Shopping Channel, a Penney 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Penney said it will take a $20-million charge for the first quarter ending 
April 29 as a result of Telaction's shutdown. That is on top of a $106-million 
investment that the big Dallas-based retailer has made over the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
Since a delayed start-up in 1988, Telaction has provided cable television 
viewers with an electronic shopping mall. Using a touch-tone telephone, viewers 
can choose a category of merchandise, browse the offerings from a particular 
store and make selections. 
</P>
<P>
An array of prestigious merchants have participated in the service, including 
Neiman Marcus Group, Marshall Field's, Sears, catalogue house Spiegel Inc., 
Dayton Hudson, several shoe retailers and two foreign merchants, Galeries 
Lafayette of France and La Rinascente of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Telaction also offered groceries and programs such as Holiday Condominiums, 
showing viewers time-share condos around the world, and Express Music, 
featuring excerpts from compact discs, tapes and records. 
</P>
<P>
The service, carried free over cable, differs from those offered over cable 
television by industry pioneer Home Shopping Network of St. Petersburg, Fla., 
and its two much smaller rivals, QVC and Cable Value Network. Those programs 
display items one after the other that at-home shoppers are invited to 
purchase. With Telaction, viewers can choose what they want to see. 
</P>
<P>
Although Penney said 13% of the 30,000 subscribers to Telaction have made 
purchases -- what it called a "remarkably high percentage for a direct response 
business" -- industry analysts speculated that not enough of those customers 
came back for more. 
</P>
<P>
"The key statistic is the number of repeat buyers," said Randy Gebhardt, vice 
president of Retail Planning Associates, a consulting firm in Columbus, Ohio. 
Penney would not disclose Telaction's sales or the percentage of repeat 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Gerbrandt, an analyst with Paul Kagan Associates, described the Telaction 
technology as innovative but cumbersome. The system required installation of 
expensive "black boxes" on telephone poles that stored the images to be relayed 
to viewers' television monitors. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Gerbrandt noted, the system was set up so that 25 subscribers 
shared a "party line." As a result, only one subscriber could use the system at 
a time. Meanwhile, if one neighbor were shopping, the others would see his 
selections -- from lingerie to lockets -- on their screens. 
</P>
<P>
The subscriber level for Telaction has remained well short of Penney's early 
projections. At one time, Penney projected 125,000 cable subscribers in the 
Chicago area by mid-1987, before delays put Telaction's introduction more than 
a year behind schedule. Penney also had predicted that by 1990 the "TV mall" 
would be available in 20 big cities. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Whitley, a resident of Deerfield, Ill., who has had the service on cable 
for several months, said she has never made a purchase through Telaction and, 
in fact, "went browsing" only one time. 
</P>
<P>
"It just seems to me that it would be more useful for someone who doesn't get 
out," said Whitley, who works as a bookkeeper for an elementary school 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Penney said the decision to fold Telaction was made after investment banker 
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. spent weeks attempting unsuccessfully to find an 
investor willing to shoulder part of the expense of running the service. Penney 
said Kidder conducted a worldwide search, contacting companies in retailing, 
technology, media and communications. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the closing, Penney said it will lay off 164 writers, producers, 
salespeople and technicians in Schaumburg, Ill., where Telaction is based. 
</P>

Two interactive systems will remain after Telaction closes. Prodigy, a joint 
venture of Sears and IBM that subscribers activate on personal computers, 
started up last October and now has "tens of thousands of members" in 
California, Connecticut, Georgia and elsewhere, according to Geoffrey E. Moore, 
director of marketing programs. Penney is a participating merchant. 
</P>
<P>
GTE is also doing limited testing in Boston of an interactive service called 
Main Street. Users access the service through a television cable using a remote 
control. Unlike Telaction, Main Street does not require a touch-tone phone and 
does not make subscribers share a party line.

THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES TO BE TOLD JOBS DEPEND ON FUNDING; 
</P>
<P>
STEALTH BOMBER WORKERS COULD FACE LAYOFFS

Northrop and several other major defense contractors must notify, beginning 
Monday, thousands of employees working on the Air Force's secret stealth bomber 
program that they may lose their jobs soon if almost $300 million in additional 
research funds is not provided for the program, according to congressional and 
Pentagon sources. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based Northrop, the stealth's prime contractor, has 14,000 
employees working on the bomber program, most of them at the firm's Pico Rivera 
unit. Several thousand Northrop workers and subcontractors' employees could 
receive the 60-day notice, sources said. The stealth bomber program employs 
more than 34,000 workers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
The layoff warnings will be issued in accordance with the 1988 plant closings 
law that requires 60 days notice of terminations by large employers. If 
lawmakers reject a proposal to shift the money into a special research and 
development account for the bomber, the thousands of workers could be laid off 
in the first week of June. 
</P>
<P>
Although congressional approval would avert the layoffs, Capitol Hill sources 
said the proposed fund shift has met opposition from some members of the four 
congressional committees that must approve it. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force on March 14 requested Congress' permission to shift $290 million 
earmarked for production of the B-2, or stealth, bomber into research and 
development of the aircraft. The proposed shift, called a reprogramming, must 
be approved by the House and Senate Armed Services committees and by the 
defense subcommittees of the House and Senate Appropriations committees, which 
have scheduled special sessions in April to consider the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed budget change signals further technical trouble in the $68-billion 
aircraft program, which has grown substantially in cost and complexity since it 
was launched during the Administration of President Jimmy Carter. Major design 
changes in the controversial bomber, which was unveiled last November, have 
delayed the program by 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
The first of 132 B-2 bombers to be built was scheduled to make test flights 
early this year, but that has now been put off until late spring or early 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force has said it needs the added funds by early June if the 
development of the bomber is to continue uninterrupted. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional sources called the proposed injection of funds a "substantial" 
increase over the amount already appropriated. 
</P>
<P>
"This indicates the program continues to be in serious trouble," said John 
Pike, a defense technology expert for the Washington-based Federation of 
American Scientists. "There are going to be more increases. It sounds like 
they've got to have $300 million just to get this one aircraft off the ground 
-- and may need to make similar changes in the handful of other B-2 bombers 
they've already built." 
</P>
<P>
Said one House aide: "It's not a simple, routine, rubber-stamp reprogramming 
like most of them. The fact that they've asked for such a major reprogramming 
in the middle of the budget year raises some serious questions about their 
management of the program."

Cerrell Buys Baer: Cerrell Associates Inc., a Los Angeles public relations firm 
that has long specialized in political and governmental campaign consulting, 
said it has purchased the Sherman Oaks public relations firm Daniel H. Baer 
Inc. The purchase price was not disclosed. Joseph R. Cerrell, chairman of 
Cerrell, said he hopes to expand his agency -- which is the 13th largest in Los 
Angeles -- into one that handles more general public relations. "We started out 
as a campaign management firm, but now that's just 16% of our total business," 
said Cerrell, whose agency has helped plan campaigns for such politicians as 
John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. Among the clients Baer brings to Cerrell 
are General Telephone of California, Lockheed, Mattel and General Electric.

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: FINANCIAL ADVISER MIGHT BE NEEDED FOR GROWING 
FIRM TO MANAGE MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Pension funds, cash flow management and high-yielding investments may be of 
little importance to a small business scrambling to keep its doors open. 
</P>
<P>
But if the business takes off, the owner may find himself unable to cope with 
managing large sums of money and confused about where to turn for help. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of fretting, it may be time to look for a professional financial 
adviser. Several types are available, ranging from financial planners who take 
a big-picture approach to financial strategies to private bankers who usually 
handle accounts of $1 million or more. In between are asset managers and 
corporate treasury advisers who deal with specific problems relating to money 
management. 
</P>
<P>
"A business owner should ask himself if he has the time, willingness and 
ability to manage his money," said Alison Winter, president and chief executive 
of Northern Trust of California. The company is a subsidiary of Northern Trust, 
a Chicago-based bank holding company that manages or administers $177 billion 
in assets. 
</P>
<P>
Winter said her typical small business client has about $500,000 in the bank, a 
positive cash flow, manageable debts and a vision of where his company is 
going. 
</P>
<P>
"He's still wearing multiple hats in the business and has several accounts at 
the bank, but he is not sure what he wants to do with the money," said Winter. 
</P>
<P>
She said a company's pension fund is usually the first large sum of money to be 
invested. "By the time the pension plan gets to $2 million we are able to give 
the company a few choices," said Winter. 
</P>
<P>
Although standard savings accounts or certificates of deposit are safe, they 
often don't yield as much as more innovative investments in certain foreign 
currencies or "Yankee CDs," which are certificates of deposit issued in dollars 
by branches and agencies of foreign banks, Winter said. 
</P>
<P>
"The higher the risk in the business, the more conservatively the pension plan 
should be managed," Winter advised. For example, she said a high-technology 
company with one or two best-selling products should have the most conservative 
plan, because its success may be short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, a stable manufacturing business may want to dabble in riskier, but 
higher-yielding, investments, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials should also keep track of employees' retirement ages and make 
sure the firm has enough money in the pension fund to take care of those who 
retire, Winter said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to keeping the money safe and sound, business owners must heed 
federal regulations governing pension funds. The rules not only require the 
money to be prudently invested but also prohibit investments that favor or 
benefit the company owner over his employees. For instance, a person cannot use 
pension fund money to buy part of his home, even if it is a great investment, 
Winter explained. 
</P>
<P>
On a more personal note, an asset manager will also provide estate and trust 
planning. Winter and other advisers said they prefer to work as a team with a 
business owner's accountant, tax adviser and attorney to prepare a total 
financial strategy. 
</P>
<P>
One challenge in working with small business owners is that they are frequently 
reluctant to allow anyone else to make important decisions. Winter said her job 
is to offer various scenarios, not to take control of a person's money. 
</P>
<P>
"It's his money and he's got the final decision," she said. Another type of 
financial adviser specializes in helping companies increase their cash flow by 
identifying and solving the problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We wring the towel of a company's operations to get more cash out of them," 
said Charles Rack, president of Treasury Resources Inc. in Century City. "We 
try to make sure cash isn't tied up in receivables and operations." 
</P>
<P>
Treasury Resources does not provide specific investment advice but works with 
the company's owners and financial staff to establish a corporate treasury 
strategy, Rack said. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem we run into with small business owners is that they 
usually hire an accountant and he eventually becomes the chief financial 
officer," Rack said. This happens even if the person is not truly qualified for 
the job. And if the person is not qualified to solve the cash flow problems, he 
frequently feels jealous and threatened by the services and advice Treasury 
Resources offers. 
</P>
<P>
Once the company decides to hire Rack and his partner Tom Harvey, they meet 
several times with the owner and his financial staff to become acquainted with 
the problems. Rack and Harvey usually charge a flat fee for a cash flow 
analysis and then bill by the hour with fees ranging from $150 to $300, Rack 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Even if you are not familiar with financial advisers and what they offer, most 
business owners know someone with a personal or private banker. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of our clients come to us after they have sold their business," said 
Shannon Clyne, senior vice president and chief investment officer for Bank of 
America. "Among our domestic clients, fully two-thirds came to us after they 
sold a business." 
</P>
<P>
Clyne's group helps clients invest in marketable securities, and clients pay a 
fee based on the market value of their investment portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
Clyne said his staff meets several times with a new client to define his or her 
financial objectives. After that, they keep in touch by telephone and meet 
quarterly. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people hire us so they don't have to pay much attention or be very 
involved in managing their money," Clyne said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Survey Cites Hot Areas 
</P>
<P>
A new survey in Success magazine predicts that food, child care, housing, 
leisure, education, health care, recycling, information and marketing will be 
the hottest growth areas for entrepreneurs in the 1990s. The study, prepared by 
Forecasting International Ltd. in Arlington, Va., also predicts that by the 
year 2000, nearly 90% of the work force will work in the service sector.

Sun Microsystems Inc., the No. 1 maker of sophisticated computer workstations, 
will launch four new models in April in an effort to counter increasingly stiff 
competition from its rivals, industry analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
The competition, from the likes of Digital Equipment, Hewlett-Packard and 
upstart Next, challenges Sun's position as the premier vendor of the powerful 
desktop machines, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The new workstations are expected to carry pricetags ranging from $7,000 to as 
much as $50,000, depending on configuration. 
</P>
<P>
Workstations crunch numbers faster and offer more complex graphics than 
personal computers. Originally designed for use by engineers and scientists, 
they are making their way into offices as their prices drop closer to those of 
PCs.

Dancing in black spike heels and a sheer chiffon dress, Kim Basinger wants the 
music changed. 
</P>
<P>
She's purring. 
</P>
<P>
She's writhing. 
</P>
<P>
She's rubbing her back against a chalk-white backdrop like a silky cat on this 
breezy, Hollywood rooftop. 
</P>
<P>
And she's heard enough of chart-topper Bobby Brown. 
</P>
<P>
"Put on 'Bad,' the Michael Jackson tape," urges the sultry star of "9 1/2 
Weeks," "Blind Date" and the forthcoming "Batman" with Jack Nicholson and 
Michael Keaton. 
</P>
<P>
"Beautiful! Go! Wow! That's great!" photographer Herb Ritts encourages 
Basinger, firing staccato shots so fast his finger is glued to the camera's 
shutter release. 
</P>
<P>
"That's nice with the tension on your legs like that. . . . Look at me right 
here. . . . Turn to this side. It's better . . . so I see your leg." 
</P>
<P>
Here, on the rooftop of Ritts' studio, seven people are working this shoot, 
including a magazine art director, style editor, hairdresser, makeup artist and 
various assistants. But only Ritts seems to notice that Basinger is displeased 
with the music -- she's requested the Jackson tape twice -- and he calmly 
directs an assistant to make the change. 
</P>
<P>
Few details escape the eyes (or ears) of Ritts, the internationally acclaimed 
photographer who's become as big a star as many of the personalities he 
captures on film. 
</P>
<P>
Though best known for his cover portraits for such magazines as Vanity Fair, 
Rolling Stone, Interview, GQ and Vogue, Ritts is also celebrated for his work 
in slick fashion magazines from Italy to Japan, for his art prints and nudes 
exhibited in galleries worldwide and for his well-received coffee table book of 
last year, "Herb Ritts Pictures." 
</P>
<P>
He even had a billboard on Santa Monica Boulevard celebrating the book last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
In the opinion of many observers, including some of his competitors, Ritts, 37, 
is simply the hottest photographer around, one of a very slim group of 
image-makers who've achieved star status in their own right. 
</P>
<P>
Says his friend Matthew Rolston, a newer but fast-rising member of this select 
group: "This is Herb's moment." 
</P>
<P>
How do photographers make the leap from being solid magazine photographers to 
being relentlessly sought after by stars and editors alike? What makes a 
particular photographic vision desirable for setting the tone on everything 
from record album covers to movie billboards to magazine covers? 
</P>
<P>
And why are Los Angeles-based photographers Ritts and Rolston -- along with 
such well-known photographers as Annie Leibovitz, Helmut Newton and Bruce Weber 
-- suddenly finding themselves at the front of the pack, while other extremely 
gifted individuals have yet to make the cut? 
</P>
<P>
"It's a change in perception," suggests Derek Ungless, art director at Vogue 
and formerly art director of Rolling Stone. 
</P>
<P>
"Being hot, which is a particularly '80s phenomenon, seems to account for more 
than being good sometimes, but in the case of Annie and Herb and some others 
it's not the case. They work for certain types of people, certain magazines. 
They produce talked-about images. There's a point where it dawns on the stars 
themselves that if these photographers' pictures are talked about, by 
inference, they get talked about." 
</P>
<P>
Ungless also cites an obvious but sometimes overlooked factor: Star 
photographers "make people look good. They make them look extraordinary. And 
once they start to be hot, they get hotter." 
</P>
<P>
So how do you get hot? 
</P>
<P>
"I've never really figured it out. It's not the pictures. It has to be 
personality," says Temple Smith, picture editor of Esquire, referring to the 
fact that a number of celebrity portrait specialists produce exceptional 
photographs but they're not considered to be heating up the inside track. 
</P>
<P>
"Matthew (Rolston) and Herb (Ritts) are in a class of their own. Matthew's a 
fabulous photographer and so's Herb and so are other photographers but they 
don't get the access (to celebrities). When I call Mr. or Ms. Celebrity and ask 
them to shoot with somebody, they often have an opinion. Oftentimes, the 
celebrity will tell me who they want to shoot with, though we much prefer to 
shape a book according to our own interests," she adds. 
</P>
<P>
But what accounts for celebrities requesting or even demanding to work with 
Ritts, Rolston or another "name?" 
</P>
<P>
Actor Richard Gere, a friend who unwittingly helped launch Ritts' career in the 
late '70s by posing for just-for-fun shots that later appeared worldwide, says 
he can't speak for others. But Gere likes the way Ritts "gets it done quick and 
I always recognize the person in the photograph. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Ritts' style is simple though mysterious and dramatic, often using 
natural-light shadows, stark backgrounds and the strength of a subject's 
character to carry the photo. Says Gere: "Herb doesn't impose some sort of 
exterior personality on the photograph. . . . I think in the end, the subjects 
really recognize themselves in the shots. . . . Once you've worked with Herb, 
you know you won't get burned." 
</P>
<P>
Gere, who has been staying at Ritts' Hollywood Hills home (featured last year 
in HG) until his own house is completed, acknowledges that it's commonplace for 
celebrities to request to work with certain photographers: "Of course, you 
request. You request the best. He's a lousy cook, though, and he doesn't do 
laundry." 
</P>
<P>
Esquire's Smith affirms that Ritts, Rolston and other top photographers are not 
about to produce unflattering work of their subjects, though they may strive to 
avoid traditional images of star glamour and to expose deeper, perhaps 
overlooked sides of their personas. In her experience, this is accomplished by 
establishing a strong rapport with personalities that allows them to be 
comfortable in a photo session -- a challenging task. 
</P>
<P>
"Both Herb and Matthew have developed relationships with people. They 
understand about celebrity, that a celebrity needs to be treated differently. 
They won't admit they demand to be treated differently, but they do. 
(Photographer) Greg Gorman also gets a lot of pictures because (celebrities) 
are his friends," Smith says. 
</P>
<P>
Free-lance fashion stylist Elisabetta Rogiani thinks that the reason Ritts and 
Rolston are relentlessly sought after all over the world is that, unlike many 
other photographers who work almost exclusively in celebrity portraiture, they 
also shoot fashion extensively and internationally. 
</P>
<P>
"I think celebrities finally understand they need a fashion photographer to 
make them look beautiful. Everybody wants to look like the girls on the cover 
of Vogue. They want the same kind of lighting and clothes and makeup the 
fashion people use. . . . When I work with celebrities, they don't want to look 
exactly like a model, but they want to have their look updated." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, work with one very well-known client can catapult an accomplished 
photographer into the picture world's upper echelons. 
</P>
<P>
Rolston, who will only reveal his age as "thirtysomething," recalls he struck 
relative success shortly after becoming a photographer at 18. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, his first clients were such publications as Interview and Harper's 
Bazaar and Rolston eventually became well known for producing surrealistic 
fashion pictures and high-styled celebrity portraits using detail-rich sets, 
often constructed in his Melrose Avenue studio. 
</P>
<P>
But he considers meeting and repeatedly photographing Michael Jackson a few 
years ago, just after the singer concluded the "Victory Tour," to be the 
turning point that propelled him to a prominent postion on the map to the 
stars' photographers. 
</P>
<P>
As for affording celebrities special treatment, Rolston acknowledges this is 
common practice. Like most others in the business, he says, he observes such 
practices as having a member of his staff find out what type of food the 
celebrity likes and then providing it during a shoot. 
</P>
<P>
But to Rolston -- a delicate, quiet, almost cherubic man who radiates 
extraordinary sensitivity and serenity -- it is basic, sincere respect that is 
the key to establishing rapport with his clients. 
</P>
<P>
"I think liking people is No. 1 -- and accepting everybody's humanity, putting 
aside their fame while still maintaining respect for their position," he says 
at his studio, wearing wheat-colored jeans and a matching sweater over a white 
T-shirt with a few inches of pearls peeking out from around his neck. 
</P>
<P>
While Rolston's images -- at the moment they're on the covers of the February 
and March issues of Esquire, as well as on the March and April covers of 
Harper's Bazaar -- are increasingly celebrated, he has long been appreciated 
for his gentle, loving nature. 
</P>
<P>
Says Omar Albertto of Omar's Men, the chic Los Angeles-based modeling agency: 
"His personality is really amazing. Who cannot fall in love with Matthew? You 
have to love him. You can't hate him." 
</P>
<P>
Like Ritts, Rolston has reached the point where he can turn down work that 
doesn't interest him, is booked months in advance and travels constantly 
throughout the world to shoot on location. He's also studying cinematography 
two days a week because he expects magazines to move into a broadcast format in 
the next decade or so -- and he finds the current video expressions of fashion 
to be crude and visually unsophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, Rolston says, his portrait style is becoming more simplified and he's 
using fewer props and elaborate sets. Fashion stylist Raymond Lee, with the Los 
Angeles firm Cloutier, notes that Rolston has even persuaded some stars to be 
photographed without makeup. 
</P>
<P>
"He did that with Jodie Foster and Angelica Huston," Lee says. "They let him do 
it because they have such confidence in him." 
</P>
<P>
Esquire's Smith describes the look of Rolston's current pictures as "very warm 
and friendly and accessible and at the same time it's sensual and glamorous. 
It's a warmer style than Annie Leibovitz's. Her pictures say 'Hi, you don't 
know me; come here a little closer and I'll tell you.' Matthew's pictures are, 
'Come on in and sit down.' " 
</P>
<P>
It's a style, she says, that's made him most difficult to book: "I had a shoot 
recently where Matthew was more busy than the celebrity. It's a problem because 
he's in great demand." 
</P>
<P>
To hear Smith and other art directors tell it, trying to get on their schedules 
is about the only real problem in working with hot photographers; it's a given 
the pictures will turn out satisfactorily. 
</P>
<P>
"You're always sure you're going to get something usable, at least 99% of the 
time," says Charles Churchward Jr., art and design director of Vanity Fair, 
who's worked repeatedly with Ritts, Leibovitz, Rolston and other international 
photography stars. 
</P>
<P>
Only rarely is there a major flop. Like last year, Churchward recalls, when he 
and Ritts spent a week in London negotiating with Prince's representatives, 
only to have the pop star agree to a shoot and then pull out minutes before it 
was scheduled to begin. 
</P>
<P>
Though Ritts is known as something of a "control freak" among magazine editors 
for arguing forcefully about how his work is edited and displayed, Churchward 
notes that Prince proved to be "the ultimate 'control freak' -- he practically 
wanted to click the shutter." 
</P>
<P>
As for his own tendency to direct art directors, Ritts contends that it's just 
an indication of how strongly he feels about his work. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm definitely particular. There's so much effort put into these things from 
day one. . . . I know magazines too well," he explains in his characteristic 
nasal tones. "People are ready for me to get on the phone. The faxes (of photo 
layouts) fly. I care. I really care about it and they know it's coming from a 
good place." 
</P>
<P>
They also know, Ritts adds, that if he's seriously displeased about the way his 
work is presented, that he will no longer work with the magazine beyond any 
contractual agreements. 
</P>
<P>
By their own admission, both Ritts and Rolston are workaholics, working and 
traveling relentlessly. According to her assistant, Leibovitz was too 
overscheduled even to be interviewed for this article. 
</P>
<P>
As Ritts describes his situation, "I'm booked months in advance. I shoot every 
day. I'm trying to take weekends off this year. I just turned down a job for 
$40,000 three weeks ago -- a movie ad that involved travel. But I'll do some 
things for no money." 
</P>
<P>
Among those noncommissioned shots are Ritts' nudes and other erotic pictures, 
some unabashedly homosexual, such as those contained in "Herb Ritts Pictures." 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the photographer is completing work on another book for his 
publisher, "Twin Palms," actually two volumes in a single slipcover. But he's 
not ready to reveal its theme, describing it only as "a different subject 
matter" and set for release later this year. 
</P>
<P>
An easy bet is that it will consist of Ritts' favorite sort of work, the stuff 
he shoots just for himself, which he claims to do more and more, even when he's 
working for a specific client. 
</P>
<P>
As Basinger says of their recent collaboration, within earshot of the magazine 
editors producing and ultimately paying for the rooftop shoot, "We don't do 
this for magazines. Herb and I do this for ourselves. He's real secure in what 
he does. That allows you to be free. I'll shoot anything for Herb." 
</P>
<P>
Basinger reveals, however, that Ritts will not photograph just anything for 
her. She's asked. He's said no, though she declines to elaborate on the 
specifics. 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't seemed to matter in the slightest. 
</P>
<P>
Says Basinger, who has worked with Ritts repeatedly in the last six years: "I 
shoot with other people as well and there are some fabulous photographers. But 
I've always been with Herb in some vein. We were probably brother and sister in 
our last lifetime. Shooting with Herb is like going to another part of my 
house."

N.Y. DESIGNERS FORECAST MANY OPTIONS FOR FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTIJANE LEVINE, Times Fashion Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is it a cape, a serape, a shawl? 
</P>
<P>
It's super-flag -- a cashmere cover-up for pianos or people, created by Marc 
Jacobs, the year's most talked-about designer. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs, only 25 and already a veteran of the fashion wars, had his own label 
until a few months back when he was tapped by Perry Ellis Inc. to fill the late 
designer's preppy shoes. 
</P>
<P>
The ponytailed prodigy -- whose last collection featured screaming sequined 
beach towels and a 1950's Miami Beach theme -- will now have to create the kind 
of low-key, high-profile clothes that made Perry Ellis a household name. 
</P>
<P>
How he does it, if he does it, will be revealed April 10 when the first Marc 
Jacobs for Perry Ellis collection is shown to buyers and press during fall 
market week. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm scared," Jacobs admitted Wednesday from his New York office. To help relax 
himself, he said, his shoes were off and he was about to eat a pizza. 
</P>
<P>
About the shades-of-gray shawl from his upcoming collection: "It's not a shawl 
but a real blanket, the size of a whole double bed" he explained. "It's made by 
Claridge of Scotland, who do all the blankets for Hermes and Louis Vuitton." 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs hopes people will use the fringed blanket decoratively, on furniture, 
and will love it so much that they'll also want to "wrap themselves in it on 
really cold days." 
</P>
<P>
Please see NEW YORK, Page 14 
</P>
<P>
Those looking for something more conventional to wear next fall will find that 
too, he says. "I've designed a bit of everything: long and short skirts, wide 
and narrow pants." 
</P>
<P>
The look he likes most, however, is the "slim, neat look of very narrow pants" 
-- in cavalry twill, suede, even matte sequins, all teamed with voluminous 
tops. 
</P>
<P>
New York's other Wunderkind, Isaac Mizrahi, reportedly wouldn't even consider 
taking the job at Perry Ellis 
</P>
<P>
because he wanted to retain his own company name and label. 
</P>
<P>
At 27, this will be Mizrahi's seventh season in business and his fourth major 
</P>
<P>
fashion show. "There are no designer clothes in my new collection -- by that I 
mean it's just real American sportswear of thepurest kind. It's all about 
options and priorities," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The wool jersey "nose-warmer" tunic, shown here with pants, 
</P>
<P>
represents one of the many options to Mizrahi. The tunic can be worn separately 
as a dress."The nose-warmer looks wonderful when it's worn down -- a sort of 
cowl neckline. I have lots of pants for fall, in both slim and sack styles. And 
loads of jumpsuits," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Pants may be very popular at the New York showings that start next week, 
judging from these exclusive, advance photos. Calvin Klein will offer slim 
versions topped by classic, double-breasted jackets and uncharacteristically 
prim, tie-neck blouses. 
</P>
<P>
Louis dell'Olio, for Anne Klein, likes a bit more width at the bottom. His 
swaggery trousers are teamed with a matching, one-button jacket. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Karan's pants-shape looks almost bell-bottom, with a drapey jacket that 
closes at the waist. 
</P>
<P>
Geoffrey Beene, Manhattan's resident fashion poet, has an explanation for the 
rear-window emphasis on his "Metamorphosis" dresses with elided backs, such as 
the one shown here. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . the cutout back, shaped like a pincer, terminates in two sharp prongs 
shooting over the left and right hip joints. These paired slivers act like 
arrows pointing to new divisions of the female anatomy." 
</P>
<P>
We never told you fashion was simple. 
</P>

WHEN STRANGERS NEAR; 
</P>
<P>
PARENTS AND EDUCATORS STRUGGLE TO TEACH CHILDREN IMPORTANT SAFETY LESSONS 
WITHOUT LEAVING THE YOUNGSTERS TOO TERRIFIED TO TRUST ANYONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By PAUL CIOTTI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Los Angeles Police Officer Digby Sharpe runs the Sylmar El Dorado Elementary 
School students through a safety drill, he asks: "Does everyone know what we 
say to strangers?" 
</P>
<P>
The children are primed. "YES!" they shout in unison. 
</P>
<P>
"What do we say to strangers?" 
</P>
<P>
"NO!" 
</P>
<P>
"What do you do then?" 
</P>
<P>
"RUN!" 
</P>
<P>
"Then what do you do?" 
</P>
<P>
"TELL!" 
</P>
<P>
"That's right. Tell somebody." Sharpe pauses. "Did everyone hear about the 
little girl who got taken the other day?" 
</P>
<P>
Three-quarters of the kids stick up their hands. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened," Sharpe says, "was that a little girl got taken away from 
school. A man came up and asked if she would help him go pick up some books. 
And she went with him because he told her he was a teacher. He wasn't really a 
teacher but she didn't know it. And she isn't going to be going back home. And 
I'll tell you what. I don't want that to happen to any one of you guys. So 
that's why we say, 'Always say no to strangers.' " 
</P>
<P>
It's a dilemma for parents and school administrators. 
</P>
<P>
If adults don't warn children about the possibility of abductions, there's a 
small but definite possibility in an area as dicey as greater Los Angeles that 
a child could end up as Nadia Puente, 9, did -- found dead in a trash can in 
Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
But if grown-ups warn children about strangers, they run another risk -- that 
of traumatizing youngsters, making them unreasonably afraid of normal, healthy 
social contact and otherwise trampling the flowers in what ought to be the most 
sunny and carefree times of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really ambivalent" about blanket warnings against strangers, says Carolyn 
Harris, director of the Westminster Child Center in Eagle Rock. It's crucial 
for children's healthy development to spend their first year learning to trust 
the world around them. 
</P>
<P>
"What are we doing," Harris asks, "if we then turn around at age 3 or 4 and say 
there is a whole group of people called strangers whom they can't trust?" 
</P>
<P>
Diane Swanbrow, a Toluca Lake writer, says that when her daughter started 
nursery school, the teachers advised her that her daughter had a suspicious 
streak. Now, three years later, she says, the school is telling her daughter, 
"never speak to a stranger." 
</P>
<P>
And that, Swanbrow says, is an impossible situation. You can't not talk to 
strangers in a city like Los Angeles, where many people have no extended family 
or longtime friends. "Everyone is a stranger," Swanbrow says. "If you aren't 
friendly to strangers, you don't have any friends." 
</P>
<P>
If you are standing out front watering the lawn when a stranger walks by and 
you smile and say hello, the first thing a child wants to know, Swanbrow says, 
is "Why is it OK for Mommy to talk to strangers but it's not OK for me?" 
</P>
<P>
"What are you going to say?" asks Swanbrow. "Mommy is an adult and knows a good 
stranger from a bad stranger? Mommy has ESP?" 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Swanbrow asks, why make kids paranoid about strangers when most of the 
time "it's not strangers doing it anyway -- it's friends and family members." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Blanket Prohibitions 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't make sense to give children a blanket prohibition against talking to 
strangers, agrees USC child psychiatrist Jerome Karasic. "What if (the child) 
is lost? You can't say, 'Don't ask anyone the way home.' " 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police officers who make safety presentations to schoolchildren try 
not to frighten them. "If we tell them a bunch of horror stories, they will 
leave here crying," says Sharpe's partner, Officer Alicia Hajewski. 
</P>
<P>
But even so, some children still are frightened, by lectures at school and at 
home and by the graphic depictions of abductions, assaults and shootings they 
see on television. 
</P>
<P>
Ivy Morritt, a program coordinator at the El Dorado school, says that after one 
lecture her son was so "petrified he wouldn't go out for two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Swanbrow says her daughter told her a classmate heard a lecture and got so 
scared he wet his pants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Not Talk to Friends 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Harris says the mother of one of the students at her child care center 
inadvertently frightened her son so much about strangers that he wouldn't even 
talk to his mother's friends in church. 
</P>
<P>
Marcy Tiffany, regional office director of the Federal Trade Commission, says 
she and her 7-year-old son were listening to the radio on the morning when an 
assailant using an AK-47 semiautomatic weapon attacked students at a Stockton 
school. "His face went into shock," she says of her son. " 'Who shot those 
children,' " he asked. " 'Why did someone shoot those children?' " 
</P>
<P>
To children, reminders of the problem are everywhere. Even the faces of missing 
children on milk cartons can be scary to a child, says Don Rector, supervisor 
of safety education for the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Because the news media focus on all the things that are wrong, rather than 
those that are right, parents often pick up unreasonable fears of potential 
dangers confronting their children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Abductions Are Rare 
</P>
<P>
Statistically, according to the Safe Kids campaign, a Washington, D.C.-based 
coalition sponsored in part by the National Safety Council, abductions are rare 
in the United States. Only 67 children were abducted by strangers in 1986. In 
contrast, more than 5,100 children were killed that year in automobile, 
swimming, falling and gun accidents. 
</P>
<P>
But some parents so fear abductions, Rector says, that they will create a 
traffic hazard by double-parking "rather than let the kid go up to the school 
gate alone." 
</P>
<P>
Still, educators are quick to emphasize, just because some people are paranoid 
doesn't mean a problem doesn't exist. Nine-year-old Nadia Puente, after all, 
was left strangled in Griffith Park. Seven-year-old Sara Hodges was strangled 
last week in Santa Clarita. There have been three abductions of young girls in 
three East Bay communities in the San Francisco Bay Area over the last nine 
months. 
</P>
<P>
"We live in a high-risk society," says Ruth Rich, health educational specialist 
for the Los Angeles school district. "We have a lot more dangerous people on 
the streets than we used to -- more transients, more people who should be 
institutionalized; there are a lot of people on probation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Are Naive' 
</P>
<P>
Children who came from countries and cultures where there isn't such 
omnipresent, random viciousness and perversion are especially easy targets. 
"They are naive," Rector says. "They trust everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Latchkey kids are another easy target, Rector says -- the youngsters are so 
often needy they find it hard to resist a seemingly affectionate adult. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, there is that perennial problem for a fast-moving, highly mobile 
society like Los Angeles -- the lack of community. 
</P>
<P>
"In small towns, you knew everyone's name," Rector notes. "You knew the dog's 
name. Now, no one knows anyone. You may not even know the person next door." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Rector notes, bustling Los Angeles is a big city where some bars open 
at 6 a.m. and some young girls have to endure drunks' catcalls on the way to 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"We are now at the point where we send a memo to the schools recommending that 
kids not go out trick or treating" on Halloween, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with this reality, parents can't simply ignore the problem. But this 
doesn't mean terrorizing children with graphic accounts of horrific disasters. 
Far better, Rector says, is give them firm new rules: 
</P>
<P>
Never walk along isolated streets. Avoid freeway off-ramps. Take the same safe 
route home from school every day. Beware of tricks: "Your mother is in the 
hospital. She asked me to take you to her." 
</P>
<P>
Let your parents know where you are at all times. Don't pet dogs. Don't accept 
candy. Walk with a friend. Go straight home. Never get into a car with anyone 
not approved by your parents, and this includes, Rector says, teen-age uncles 
or aunts and friendly neighbors.

BEAVERS OUT OF PLACE: AN ECOLOGICAL BLUNDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BIG BEAR, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An experiment to save beavers, which were deliberately introduced into many 
parts of the San Bernardino National Forest and elsewhere in California, 
appears in some ways to have been entirely too successful, and that has 
wildlife biologists in a quandary. At least a decade ago a golden beaver 
stumbled into a pleasant grove of trees at the edge of the San Gorgonio 
Wilderness about 25 miles south of here and found a stand of aspens -- its 
favorite food. 
</P>
<P>
Today, after at least 10 years of what wildlife management experts discreetly 
refer to as "resource conflict," one of the four aspen clusters in the grove 
has been devastated by beavers. And botanists say that the three remaining 
aspen clusters will probably meet the same fate if the beavers' reproductive 
cycle is uninterrupted by natural forces such as flooding or predation by 
mountain lions and coyotes, or left undisturbed by the wilderness's human 
stewards. 
</P>
<P>
If the aspens are to be saved, according to Scott White, the U.S. Forest 
Service botanist for the wilderness, the beaver will have to be removed -- 
possibly by trapping and killing. 
</P>
<P>
The aspen grove is not a unique example of human-induced resource conflict 
involving beavers, experts agree. But, according to Gordon Gould, of the 
California Department of Fish and Game, the San Gorgonio incident is a telling 
example of how humans can fail miserably in their zeal to do the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the 19th Century, the trapping of beavers to satisfy the demands of a 
booming fur trade resulted in near-extinction of the animal in North America by 
the turn of the century. As a result, beaver harvesting was outlawed and, by 
the 1920s, the animal had staged a miraculous comeback. 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1920s, said Gould, beavers were so plentiful that hunting was again 
allowed. But within a decade or so, he said, the species had been all but wiped 
out again, so permanent protections were put in place. 
</P>
<P>
In California, fish and game officials decided in the mid-1940s to take out 
some insurance for the beaver by introducing it not just back into the range 
the animal had historically inhabited but also into areas where there is no 
record of the animal. 
</P>
<P>
Elimination of some natural predators and other aspects of the encroachment of 
civilization have limited natural means to control beaver populations. Today, 
said White and other experts, heavy rains, flooding and natural disease 
epidemics are the only remaining natural means of control. Beaver protection 
programs in places as diverse as Massachusetts and Nevada have had similar 
results. 
</P>
<P>
As animals with no logical evolutionary business in the area, the beavers 
introduced here, in the Sierra above the Owens Valley and in the Central Valley 
qualified as what biologists call "exotic species," according to Robert Naiman, 
of the Center for Streamside Studies at the University of Washington in 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, said Naiman and Susan Sferra, a U.S. Forest Service wildlife 
biologist, is that exotics introduced into a wild area are thrust as brash 
strangers into a complex of ecosystems that exist in delicate harmony. 
</P>
<P>
"When you put animals like this in new habitat -- certainly in areas where they 
truly never existed before -- it is not a good idea," Naiman said. "What 
happens is you get reverberations throughout all aspects of the ecosystem." 
</P>
<P>
In its appropriate ecologic place, said Naiman, the beaver is "absolutely 
essential" to its habitat. So significant in its natural environmental niche is 
the beaver, said Naiman, that it qualifies as a "keystone species" in native 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
But when the beaver is essentially dumped into a place it doesn't belong, 
Naiman, Gould and Sferra agreed, its environmental value sometimes becomes a 
hazard. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is not just confined to the San Gorgonio Wilderness. For instance, 
said Phil Pister, a Department of Fish and Game biologist in Bishop, in the 
Owens Valley, beavers are in constant conflict with aqueducts and streams that 
move water to Southern California. Elsewhere, beavers have been known to jam 
intake pipes of hydroelectric stations. 
</P>
<P>
California currently permits landowners whose holdings are seriously damaged by 
beavers to trap and kill the animals. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to learn how to live much better with nature around us," Naiman said. 
"If you want to manage something as a true natural system, you want to manage 
the system as it always was."

A Feb. 25 story erroneously reported that Los Angeles attorney Albert M. 
Bernstein was charged with extortion for "financial gain" in the disappearance 
of millionaire Jean Fay Drexler. In fact, Bernstein was charged with one felony 
count of having posed "as one who had the ability to gain" the woman's release 
and "offered to do so for consideration."

O.C. CENTER MOVES AHEAD WITH PLANS FOR 2 THEATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the Orange County Performing Arts Center operating near capacity 2 years 
ahead of projections, the Center board Thursday moved ahead with plans to add 
at least two new theaters at an estimated cost of up to $92 million. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal includes a concert hall of 2,300 to 2,500 seats -- designed in 
part to head off any competition for popular Broadway road shows -- and a drama 
theater of 650 to 800 seats, possibly to be shared with neighboring South Coast 
Repertory Company. 
</P>
<P>
Together with SCR's two existing stages, the resulting complex of five stages 
and nearly 8,000 seats would rank in size between the Lincoln Center-Juilliard 
complex in New York City -- the nation's largest -- and the Kennedy Center in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Like the $70-million Center, the additional theaters would be privately funded 
if possible, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Both a concert hall and a small hall are justifiable in the next decade, 
subject, of course, to the one caveat that we can afford to proceed and the 
determination of a prudent timetable," said Center Chairman Henry T. Segerstrom 
in a statement relayed by Center President Thomas R. Kendrick. 
</P>
<P>
The board's decision to proceed with plans to expand the Center was partially 
based on a $50,000, 8-month marketing study. After voting to accept and approve 
the study, members authorized management to do feasibility studies on site 
selection, design, parking and funding for the two theaters plus a possible 
third, mid-size facility of 1,200 to 1,500 seats. 
</P>
<P>
The most pressing need is to proceed with the concert hall to preempt 
construction of another major theater in the area for such popular attractions 
as national companies of Broadway shows, Kendrick said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is only so much touring product," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The concert hall, used by the Pacific Symphony and for single-performance 
musical events, would free Segerstrom Hall for popular shows. The hall, he 
said, would be "essentially a shoe box," designed solely for music and dance 
events without elaborate sets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Site Search Gets Priority 
</P>
<P>
In a news conference after the board meeting, Kendrick said the board's first 
priority would be to find a site for the concert hall. It has ruled out any 
remote site for new facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The board earlier had announced its intention to build a second theater for 
such programs as chamber music recitals and dramatic performances. One location 
considered for this smaller theater is land adjoining the Center now used for 
staff parking. That site, the study found, is too small to accommodate either 
the concert hall or a mid-size theater. 
</P>
<P>
Kendrick said the small theater, estimated to cost $10 million to $12 million, 
would not necessarily be built on the current parking area. It is possible that 
both the small theater and the concert hall could be built on a new site, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Undeveloped land within walking distance of the Center is scarce and at a 
premium. Some of this land is owned by the firm of C.J. Segerstrom &amp; Sons. 
The Segerstrom family donated the land for the Center. 
</P>
<P>
The new theater study, prepared by Harrison Price Co. of Torrance and released 
Thursday, found that the Center's 3,000-seat Segerstrom Hall was in use -- not 
necessarily for performances -- on 364 days from September, 1987, to August, 
1988. During that season 686,500 tickets, or 77% of capacity, were sold, a 
figure well over the national average, according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
"There can be no expansion of program without the addition of a new 
professional facility," the study concluded. "The best way to relieve pressure 
on Segerstrom (Hall) is to construct a concert hall" at a cost estimated 
between $60 million and $80 million, the study says, adding that "a lesser 
quality concert hall . . . could be built for as low as $40 million to $45 
million." 
</P>
<P>
The study coupled these figures with county population projections of 2.7 
million by the year 2000 as another factor in recommending long-term expansion 
of the Center. 
</P>
<P>
"To maintain the same ratio of population attending performing arts events as 
is currently being achieved, the county must increase both the level of 
programming and the number of theater seats," the study said. 
</P>
<P>
The maximum estimated cost for constructing all three new theaters was $119 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The third theater would rely on the new, San Diego-based Pacific Lyric Theater, 
according to the study, along with Opera Pacific and the Fullerton Civic Light 
Opera. Because the Pacific Lyric Theater is, in the words of the study, "a new 
and untested group," it recommends that "further consideration of this theater 
be deferred." 
</P>
<P>
According to Los Angeles arts consultant David Lutz, the Center should have no 
difficulty raising money for the new theaters, "if this were a phased project 
over a 10-year period." Center officials "certainly seem to have figured out 
what appeals to potential donors," said Lutz, who has worked for Orange County 
arts organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Lutz also does not see any problems of competition from other new and expanding 
theaters elsewhere in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"Audiences in Orange County do not seem to travel from one part of the county 
to another, with the exception of (going to) the Center," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For the study, Harrison Price commissioned Hebert Research Inc., to conduct two 
random telephone surveys on programming preferences in the area: one of 600 
Orange County residents and another of 200 Center subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
The two surveys found that "overall satisfaction with the Center is quite 
high," with respondents in the random survey giving the Center an 8.6 rating on 
a scale of 10, and subscribers rating it at 9. 
</P>
<P>
Those in the general category prefer, in order, Broadway musicals, plays and 
opera at the Center. Center subscribers said they preferred opera to plays. 
</P>
<P>
In two subsequent "focus groups," composed of volunteers from the Center's 
subscribers, "members expressed a desire for a more intimate venue to house 
smaller-scale presentations than those now staged at the Center" and for more 
children's programming. 
</P>
<P>
The study also took note of at least one recent development on the theater 
scene elsewhere in the county. 
</P>
<P>
While observing that "there are no large new theaters planned in Orange County 
for major productions," the study acknowledged the 750-seat, $17.9-million 
Irvine Theatre now under construction on the UC Irvine campus. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Orange County Performing Arts Center 
</P>
<P>
Three Proposed Facilities 
</P>
<P>
1. A concert hall of 2,300 to 2,500 seats, costing $60 million to $80 million. 
"A lesser quality concert hall. . .could be built for as low as $40 million to 
$45 million." Designed solely for music and dance events without elaborate 
sets. Such a facility most likely would be used by the Pacific Symphony and dor 
single-performance musical events. 
</P>
<P>
2. A drama theater of 650 to 800 might share with neighboring South Coast 
Repertory Co. One of the locations considered for this smaller theater is land 
adjoining the Center that is now used for staff parking. 
</P>
<P>
3. A third, mid-size theater facility with 1,200 to 1,500 seats, which would 
rely on the new, San Diego-based Pacific Lyric Theater, along with Opera 
Pacific and the Fullerton Civic Light Opera.

TODDLERS NEARLY DROWN AT O.C. BABY-SITTER'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BEENE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three toddlers were in critical condition Thursday night after nearly drowning 
when they fell into a pool at a North Tustin home where they were under the 
care of a baby-sitter. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the children, Jonathon Derek Weston, 22 months, of North Tustin and 
Melissa Dianne Polsfoot, 19 months, of Tustin, were rushed late Thursday to 
United Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The third child, Arthur Matthew Griese, 14 months, of Orange, was taken to 
Chapman General Hospital in Orange, where his condition was stabilized, and 
later transferred to nearby Childrens Hospital of Orange County, where he too 
was in critical condition in the intensive care ward. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors said they would know within 72 hours whether Melissa and Jonathon 
suffered brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities immediately launched an investigation into the baby-sitting 
arrangement operating at the home of Orvel Brooks in the 13000 block of Old 
Foothill Boulevard, in the unincorporated area adjacent to Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Rater, a social worker for the Orange County Department of Social 
Services, joined sheriff's deputies in the investigation but said it had not 
been determined if Brooks or a member of his family had, or needed, a license 
to care for the children. 
</P>
<P>
One unidentified mother arrived at the house and left distraught, asking 
herself: "How did he get in the pool? There was a 6-foot fence!" 
</P>
<P>
There was little information as to what happened at the large, country home 
surrounded by a neat white fence and nestled in the Cowan Heights foothills. 
Police were trying to determine if the gate leading to the pool was left open, 
how the three children fell into the pool and how long they were there before 
Brooks arrived to pull them out. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Richard Olson, a Sheriff's Department spokesman, said paramedics responded 
to a "near drowning" report at the house at 3:30 p.m. Neighbors said that when 
paramedics arrived, Brooks was giving one of the children mouth-to-mouth 
resuscitation. 
</P>
<P>
"When he (Brooks) found the kids in the pool, he went in and pulled them out 
and called 911," Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately known if the children were conscious when they were 
taken to the hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
"We understand the father and an 18-year-old daughter were here at the time," 
Olson said. "That's all I am comfortable in releasing right now. We're trying 
to be very careful with the investigation. Even though the kids are alive at 
this time, should something happen it could change the complexion of the case." 
</P>
<P>
While police questioned Orvel Brooks, his wife Diane and a daughter, a man who 
had apparently left his infant son in the Brooks' care drove up, entered the 
house and then left with his boy sleeping in his arms. He declined to talk with 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
At Childrens Hospital, the parents and friends of Arthur Griese gathered in a 
small conference room adjacent to the main waiting room. The boy's father, 
wearing khaki shorts and a navy T-shirt, paced the floor, moving between the 
conference room and the closed door of the pediatric intensive care unit. 
There, he stood silently and stared into the ward where his son was being 
treated. 
</P>
<P>
The families of Melissa Polsfoot and Jonathon Weston held similar vigils at 
United Western Medical Center. Melissa's father, Timothy Polsfoot, a systems 
engineer, said his daughter had been going to the Brooks home for day care for 
the past year, but he declined to discuss the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too painful to talk about," he said.

Wride contributed to this story.

MARINE ONCE SUSPECT IN DEATH ANGRY AT POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE FRANK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A disillusioned and angry Murray D. Payne, who spent 57 days in a military jail 
at Camp Pendleton on suspicion of murdering his wife, said Thursday that his 
legal problems began when Corona police officers decided over "a cup of coffee" 
that he had killed his wife and hanged her body from the garage rafters to make 
her death look like suicide. 
</P>
<P>
"They decided that the knot in the rope was too complicated for my wife to have 
tied," the 40-year-old Marine gunnery sergeant said at El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station. "This is something they made up over a cup of coffee. It wasn't that 
complicated. It was the kind of knot you find in a shoestring." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Corona Police Department who declined to give his name 
denied that any decisions in the Payne murder case, which the Marine Corps 
officially dropped Monday, were made casually, over cups of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
The police spokesman said the officer who conducted the case is an excellent 
investigator who makes decisions based on evidence. Efforts to reach the 
investigators on the case were unsuccessful Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Payne's January pretrial hearing on the charge that he killed his wife on May 
10, 1988, ended when the prosecutor asked that the accusation be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
He was set free in late January, after spending 2 months in a small jail cell 
at Camp Pendleton, but the soft-spoken Payne, who was reared in the small Texas 
town of Marlin, said he is still reeling. 
</P>
<P>
In May, he lost his wife, Ella Mae Payne, 39. Even though the Riverside County 
coroner's office ruled the death a suicide, there were months of investigations 
by the Corona Police Department and the military. In early December, Payne was 
arrested and locked up in the brig at Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
The worst part of the ordeal, Payne said, was when his 22-year-old son 
testified for the prosecution and against him in the military equivalent of a 
preliminary hearing in January. 
</P>
<P>
But the military prosecutor asked that the murder charge be dropped because of 
a lack of evidence showing that his wife's death was caused by anything other 
than hanging. 
</P>
<P>
Payne recalled Thursday that he and his wife had been together for 26 years. 
They had been high school sweethearts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Of his incarceration, he said: "It was not a healthy experience. It was a very 
traumatic experience to be locked up in a 4-foot-by-7-foot cell for 57 days. 
Every time I left that cell, I had chains on me." 
</P>
<P>
One night that stood out in Payne's mind was Christmas Eve: "I was really 
lonely. It all kind of hit me that night. My minister from my Santa Ana church 
came to the brig, and we prayed. That really helped." 
</P>
<P>
Military officials said a final decision on the charge was not made until the 
entire record was studied by the investigating officer and Payne's commanding 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
But for Payne, being implicated in the first place, then the wait for his name 
to be cleared, has been "an embarrassment." 
</P>
<P>
"It's embarrassing to have your name in the newspaper connected to a thing like 
this," he said. "Even after I was freed in January, other Marines would say, 
'There goes that gunny (gunnery sergeant).' " 
</P>
<P>
Payne -- of the Marine Wing Support Squadron 373, Marine Wing Support Group 37, 
3rd Marine Aircraft Wing -- said the only family he has left now is the Marine 
Corps. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess what hurt the most was what my son did," Payne said. "He never came to 
the brig to see me or bring me the things I needed. It hurt when he testified 
for the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were fairly close for a 22-year-old son and a 40-year-old father. 
I just did not know he had those deep inner feelings of hatred toward me." 
</P>
<P>
Payne has requested a transfer to another Marine base so he can start anew. The 
move will mean that he will leave many friends behind. Most of his 17 years in 
the Marine Corps have been spent at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, Payne said, he even felt betrayed by the Marines. But in the long 
run, he said, "they stood by me," and both he and the Marines overcame the 
charges, "the embarrassment, the slander" and the "black mark." 
</P>
<P>
"I've received an informal 'I'm sorry,' " he said. "But an 'I'm sorry' doesn't 
heal the wounds." 
</P>
<P>
Some friends stood by him during the ordeal, visiting or sending letters. 
</P>
<P>
"The people in our unit are close," he said. "They took care of me when I was 
in the brig. They made sure I had cigarettes and underclothes. I'll never 
forget that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Timing of Hanging Stories 
</P>
<P>
Asked why he thought this happened to him, Payne, pausing for a moment to 
consider his answer, said the timing of "the entire matter" was unfortunate. 
His wife's suicide took place about the same time the first newspaper stories 
began to appear about the murder of Melinda Thomas, wife of another El Toro 
Marine, Sgt. Joseph L. Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas was convicted of murder by a military jury and sentenced to death in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
That case had many unusual twists. A friend of Thomas testified that he watched 
Thomas beat his wife to death with a tire iron and that the two of them then 
took the body to a remote highway, placed it in the couple's vehicle and pushed 
it over a steep embankment, to make the death look like a suicide. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an unfortunate time, just after the Thomas case," Payne said of his 
arrest. "It was a Marine thing. The people thought the worst because of the 
Thomas case." 
</P>
<P>
The first autopsy, performed by the Riverside County coroner's office about a 
week after the body was found, showed no proof that his wife had been dead 
before the hanging. 
</P>
<P>
Her body was exhumed in November for a second autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
Payne was arrested 3 days later by agents of the Naval Investigative Service at 
the El Toro base. The Riverside County district attorney's office turned the 
case over to the corps because Payne is a Marine. 
</P>
<P>
This week Payne was finishing his income taxes. The task made him think about 
the past and the future. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on his past, he said: "I have no bad feelings toward the Marines. 
People can be mistreated and misjudged. I was misjudged." 
</P>
<P>
As for the future, he said: "It doesn't look very good."

<P>
The Orange County Commission on the Status of Women has named five high school 
students as winners of its "Women in History" essay contest. The winners -- 
Veronica Gianesini of Foothill High in North Tustin, Laura Paik of Ocean View 
High in Huntington Beach, Helen L. Chen of Valencia High in Placentia, Kristina 
Larsen of Gilbert West High in Buena Park, and Christa Cerciello of Laguna 
Hills High in Laguna Hills -- each received $130. 
</P>
<P>
The contest was promoted as a "Women's History Month" event to call attention 
of young people to the unsung deeds of women in American history. One winner 
was chosen from each of the five county supervisors' districts. 
</P>
<P>
Alfonso Marquez, a junior at Fullerton Union High School and an active 
volunteer, was named Boy of the Year at the Boys Club of Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Fabian E. Moni of Trabuco Canyon was named a winner of the Harold G. Hull 
graduate assistant in agriculture award at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, where he 
is a student. He will receive $2,000 for support of research projects involving 
the guidance or collaboration of a faculty mentor. 
</P>
<P>
Moni is working on a market assessment for a milk-based, caramel-like spread 
from Argentina. The spread is a popular food item there, especially in Latino 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach resident Leland J. Hendrie, a Garden Grove insurance company 
president who holds several honors and awards from the Boy Scouts of America, 
has been appointed to the board of directors of the Orange County Council of 
the Boy Scouts of America. 
</P>
<P>
The honor caps his 36 years of Boy Scout volunteer work. 
</P>
<P>
Hendrie joins 70 other Orange County business leaders in formulating and 
implementing policies for the Costa Mesa-based council, which serves an 
estimated 80,000 youths. 
</P>
<P>
"The Boys Scouts of America is an extraordinary organization, and I am honored 
to be able to help ensure its future in Orange County," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hendrie is the recipient of the Award of Merit and the Silver Beaver Award from 
the Scouts, as well as the God and Service Award, given for exemplary volunteer 
service to the church and Boy Scouts.

THREE LEFT HOMELESS BY APARTMENT FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like good neighbors to the rescue, Anaheim firefighters raced across the street 
Thursday morning to put out an apartment fire. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze at the Tara Hills Apartments in the 2100 block of West Crescent Drive 
was quickly brought under control, and two residents of one apartment were 
evacuated without injury. The resident of the other affected apartment was not 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the quick fire dousing, the fire caused an estimated $80,000 in damage 
and made the two apartments unlivable. Three people left homeless were given 
temporary assistance by the Orange County chapter of the American Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
The fire started about 7:45 a.m. in a lower apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"It was caused by a malfunctioning electrical appliance in the living room," 
Anaheim city spokeswoman Barbara Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
No one was in the apartment, she said, but two residents of the upstairs 
apartment were evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
"The fire came at a bad time because two trucks at Fire Station 2 (at 2141 W. 
Crescent Drive) were out on medical aid calls at the time," Burke said. But she 
said a reserve truck at the firehouse was put into service and rushed to the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
Burke said there was a spirit of neighborliness from the very beginning. "The 
fire station learned about the blaze because a neighbor came to the station and 
knocked on the door. Capt. Steve Pillar heard the knock and learned about the 
fire even before it came over our dispatch system." 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters "had the fire under control in 23 minutes, and two other 
apartments in the building only suffered slight smoke damage," Burke said. "All 
in all, it was a good save."

DISABLED CHILDREN'S ADVOCATES PICKED FOR AGENT ORANGE GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A Fountain Valley organization that helps children with disabilities was among 
eight groups nationwide that received grants from the settlement of a suit by 
Vietnam veterans who charged that Agent Orange had injured them or their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County group -- Team of Advocates for Special Kids, or TASK -- will 
use the $60,000, 1-year grant to teach local families of Vietnam veterans "how 
to meet their (disabled) child's special educational needs." 
</P>
<P>
TASK executive director Joan Tellefsen said she is pleased to represent one of 
the eight groups that received funding from among 147 proposals submitted by 
organizations around the country. "We are all so excited about this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Fountain Valley program provides counseling, legal information, educational 
workshops, telephone advocacy, awareness programs and a newsletter for parents 
who have disabled children. Tellefsen said TASK plans to expand its services to 
include a program tailored to disabled children of Vietnam veterans. TASK, 
which began in 1977, helped more than 3,000 families in Southern California 
last year, Tellefsen said. 
</P>
<P>
The $53-million Agent Orange Class Assistance Program, which funded Thursday's 
grants, was established as part of the settlement of a class-action suit 
brought 10 years ago by veterans claiming that exposure to the chemical Agent 
Orange caused cancer, birth defects and other illnesses. After a long court 
battle, seven chemical companies that manufactured Agent Orange settled out of 
court in 1984 for $180 million, which has grown to $240 million with 
accumulated interest. The $53-million assistance program is part of that $240 
million. The largest portion, $170 million, provides cash payments to disabled 
Vietnam veterans, or the widows and children of veterans. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government sprayed Agent Orange over much of Vietnam during the 1960s 
to destroy fields and deprive communist troops of valuable forest cover. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Rhoades, who is in charge of distributing the Agent Orange Class 
Assistance Program funds over the next 10 years, said that the proposal by the 
Orange County group caught his eye because "it was economical, it was well 
written and it was by people who were obviously very committed." 
</P>
<P>
Rhoades said that the grant program is not intended to replace government 
funding for veterans but instead will try to fund innovative ideas and help 
develop a network for existing services. The grants awarded Thursday, which 
totaled $580,000, were the first to be announced. 
</P>
<P>
Rhoades said the original $53 million in grant money could grow to $75 million 
in the next several years.

NEW GOP WHIP VISITS COUNTY; 
</P>
<P>
GINGRICH CREDITS COX, ROHRABACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA LUTHER, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Newt Gingrich, the Georgia Republican who last week took Washington by 
surprise when he won the House's second-ranking leadership post, minority whip, 
said Thursday that Orange County's two freshman congressmen were the key to his 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't have won the whip race without them," Gingrich said of Reps. C. 
Christopher Cox of Newport Beach and Dana Rohrabacher of Lomita. 
</P>
<P>
Cox, the president of the House's GOP freshman class, and Rohrabacher helped 
round up Republican votes for Gingrich, who won the post by a margin of 87 to 
85. The county's other three congressmen -- Republicans William E. Dannemeyer 
of Fullerton, Robert K. Dornan of Fullerton and Ron Packard of Carlsbad -- also 
voted for Gingrich. 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich talked with reporters at the Pacific Club in Newport Beach while in 
Orange County to raise money for a political committee aimed at developing a 
field of GOP candidates able to run for higher offices. The committee also will 
try to head off Democratic efforts to redraw congressional district lines that 
favor Democrats following the 1990 census. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Post Formerly Cheney's 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich, 45, won the post formerly held by Rep. Dick Cheney of Wyoming, who 
was chosen by President Bush as defense secretary. Gingrich's victory came over 
the opposition of House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel of Illinois, who 
wanted the more traditional Rep. Edward Madigan, also of Illinois, to replace 
Cheney. 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich's election as whip signaled a more aggressive era among House 
Republicans, who are chafing at being in the minority for the last 35 years 
despite impressive victories in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
"Forty-one out of the 45 years I've been alive, the Democrats have been in 
control of the House," Gingrich said Thursday. He said the legislators who 
voted for him as whip "want energy and activism." 
</P>
<P>
As for the Democrats, Gingrich said he expects to appeal to them on the merits 
of Republican legislation. One of his jobs as whip will be to gather votes for 
Bush's legislative proposals. 
</P>
<P>
"Democrats are not going to vote against me because I don't play golf with 
them," Gingrich said. But he added, "I think I really anger the Democrats, 
especially Southern Democrats, because (they) know I intend to have their seats 
held by Republicans and that I'm not a get-along, go-along. I'm for a 
Republican majority." 
</P>
<P>
The congressman said he would be "the guy who will come in their district and 
explain how often they help the liberals." 
</P>
<P>
Elected to the House 10 years ago, Gingrich persuaded the House Ethics 
Committee to investigate House Speaker Jim Wright, an inquiry that has eroded 
the top House Democrat's support among his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County developer Kathryn Thompson said she had planned a dinner for 
Gingrich long before his election as whip as part of an 11-city tour to promote 
the political committee. She said that growing interest in the wake of his 
victory increased attendance to about 50 people at the dinner she hosted.

UCI, COUNTY SETTLE DISPUTE OVER ACCESS ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN R. CHURM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors and UCI Medical Center apparently have settled 
a dispute over a road that both sides consider essential to their plans for 
more than $200 million in expanded facilities in the city of Orange, county 
officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the proposed settlement, the University of California Board of 
Regents has agreed not to sue Orange County in an attempt to block a proposed 
expansion of the Theo Lacy Branch Jail in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors last December voted to sue UCI over a parking structure it was 
building at the medical center in Orange, saying the structure would add 
unnecessary traffic and congestion to the access road that the county believed 
it owned. In a move county officials construed as retaliatory, the regents in 
January authorized a lawsuit against the county to halt the Theo Lacy 
expansion, a key element in the county's master plan to ease severe 
overcrowding in county jails. That suit was never filed. 
</P>
<P>
"It was two behemoths on a collision course over traffic and congestion," said 
Dan Woolridge, an aide to Supervisor Don R. Roth, who initiated the county 
action against UCI. "The squabble over the access road mushroomed into 
something much bigger." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the county agreed that UCI had some legal claim to the road and 
therefore has rights to use the private, four-lane road that divides university 
and county facilities east of the City Shopping Center in an area known as the 
Manchester Complex. Initially, county officials argued that UCI had begun 
construction of a new 700-vehicle parking structure next to the access road 
without consulting the county. They filed a lawsuit requiring UCI to assess the 
level of traffic the structure would generate. 
</P>
<P>
But the suit will be dropped if the Board of Supervisors approves the 
settlement at its next meeting Tuesday. The agreement also renames the road 
Dawn Way and calls for the two sides to share the cost of maintaining the road. 
Furthermore, it sets parking limits for the county and UCI and allows for 
widening of the road if needed in the future. 
</P>
<P>
County officials intend to build a pair of multistory parking structures for 
more than 2,350 cars, while UCI has indicated it may build an additional 
high-rise parking garage for 2,200 cars. 
</P>
<P>
"It does look like we've reached a settlement," said Leon Schwartz, vice 
chancellor of administration and business services at UCI. "Both sides have 
come out of this with honor. The process enabled both of us to better 
understand each other's plans for that area." 
</P>
<P>
Roth said he was relieved that the flap did not go further in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime you can settle a dispute without spending taxpayers' money in court, 
it's a good day," Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
County's Plans 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the jail expansion at Theo Lacy, the county is planning a new 
juvenile court facility for the Manchester Complex, which is bordered by the 
Garden Grove Freeway on the south, the Santa Ana River on the west and Chapman 
Avenue on the north. County facilities already at the complex include the 
Juvenile Justice Center and the Orangewood Children's Home. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his relief over the settlement, Roth expressed concern about the 
continuing challenge from the city of Orange over the Theo Lacy expansion. City 
officials say the expansion will cause traffic problems and jeopardize public 
safety. The project is intended to increase the capacity of Theo Lacy Branch 
Jail from 622 beds to 1,326. 
</P>
<P>
Roth said that he and Sheriff Brad Gates have met several times recently with 
Orange officials but that no agreement has been reached. 
</P>
<P>
"The longer we draw this out, the greater risk to the general public," Roth 
warned. "We have inmates who are spending only enough time in jail to get their 
pictures and fingerprints taken. We need to expand that facility."

RADIO PIONEER GEORGE CECIL BIGGAR DEAD AT 90 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pioneer radio broadcaster and former Laguna Hills resident George Cecil Biggar 
has died at a North Dakota nursing home at age 90. 
</P>
<P>
Biggar, who died March 19, was a resident of Leisure World from 1966 to 1981. 
</P>
<P>
His broadcasting career began in 1924 at radio station WLS in Chicago. Biggar, 
who had a master's degree in dairy farming and economics from South Dakota 
State University, used that background to develop weather and farm market 
reports for his rural audiences. 
</P>
<P>
At WLW in Cincinnati, he started several on-site farm broadcasts, including a 
program from the station's own 137-acre farm. 
</P>
<P>
Biggar later was considered an authority on folk, country and Western music 
because of his years as a program director and general manager at various 
stations in Indiana and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
He moved from Orange County to West Covina and then to North Dakota in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Biggar, a widower, is survived by daughter Elizabeth Hare, sons George C. 
Biggar Jr. and Gordon V. Biggar, 11 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.

WORKERS CAN PICK TRADITIONAL INSURANCE OR HMO; 
</P>
<P>
2 COUNTY COMPANIES OFFER DUAL HEALTH PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHARLES TIGHE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PM Group Life Insurance Co. and Health Plan of America -- two county companies 
competing for group health insurance premiums -- said Thursday that they have 
joined forces to market a dual health plan to Southern California businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The companies said they started jointly selling PM Group Life's traditional 
health insurance and Health Plan's health maintenance organization (HMO) this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Employers who sign up for the dual policy will offer workers a choice of PM 
Group Life or Health Plan of America. The dual policies will be managed as one 
by PM Group Life, which will cut overhead. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, HMOs and insurance plans offered by an employer are administered by 
separate companies. 
</P>
<P>
For PM Group Life, a Fountain Valley-based subsidiary of Pacific Mutual Life 
Insurance Co., the agreement will broaden its services and make it more 
competitive with the largest insurance companies, which have started their own 
HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
Health Plan of America, an Orange-based subsidiary of the nonprofit St. Joseph 
Health System, will benefit by being able to more easily sell its plan to 
companies already established with PM Group Life. In addition to basic health 
coverage, long-term disability and dental and vision plans will be available. 
</P>
<P>
PM Group Life insures about 230,000 employees in its group health plans. Health 
Plan of America has about 96,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
The plan will be marketed by sales representatives of each company; the two 
companies will equally share expenses and revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Turpin, an assistant vice president at Johnson &amp; Higgins, an 
employee benefits consulting firm in Costa Mesa, said the agreement is a 
necessary response to competitive changes in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional health insurance companies have lost clients to HMOs, which are 
particularly popular among younger workers. Consequently, insurance companies 
have a disproportionate number of older workers who tend to have bigger medical 
bills, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that medium-size operations such as Pacific Mutual Group Life have 
moved slowly in offering HMO plans and that some still have no HMO options. 
</P>
<P>
PM Group Life spokesman Jim Burke said his company has not started its own HMO 
because the costs of establishing a network are staggering. He said PM Group 
Life considered buying an HMO about 18 months ago but decided to study 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Burke said there is no plan to buy Health Plan of America's operations. 
</P>
<P>
Health Plan of America President Lawrence Kugelman said Health Plan of America 
could gain up to 10,000 customers a year through the joint marketing agreement. 
The plan is to be sold statewide later this year.

ANAHEIM COIN FIRM AGREES TO RESTITUTION FOR IRATE PURCHASERS AFTER STATE FILES 
SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH T. YAMADA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
To settle allegations of false advertising and unfair business practices, an 
Anaheim commemorative coin manufacturer has agreed to pay $150,000 restitution 
to dissatisfied investors. 
</P>
<P>
The state attorney general's office filed a civil complaint Wednesday against 
Rarities Mint Inc. and its president, Ian Simpson, in Orange County Superior 
Court in Santa Ana. At the same time, Simpson, agreed to pay restitution and 
$60,000 in civil penalties without admitting any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Named in the complaint were 15 plaintiffs who each had purchased between $200 
and $61,500 worth of gold and silver commemorative coins. 
</P>
<P>
Rarities contracts with government agencies and private organizations, such as 
the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, to make commemorative coins that are sold to 
collectors and investors, Jerry Smilowitz, deputy attorney general, said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the complaint, telephone salespeople falsely offered customers an 
unconditional buyback plan, quick deliveries and bank financing. The sales 
representatives allegedly claimed that the company was an authorized 
representative of the U.S. Mint, threatened to make damaging consumer credit 
reports against people who changed their minds about a purchase and failed to 
provide written contracts or cancellation policies as required by state law. 
</P>
<P>
The state began its investigation in 1986 after receiving complaints from 
dissatisfied investors. Smilowitz said Rarities changed its business practices 
in 1987 after being contacted by investigators and stopped direct sales to the 
public. It continues to operate as a wholesale business making coins and 
selling them to dealers and retailers. 
</P>
<P>
Customers, many of whom bought coins with the intention of selling them later 
at a profit, complained that they were told by sales people that coins could be 
sold back to Raritiesanytime at the purchase or market price, Smilowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
But later, buyers were informed that they had to wait 6 months for the buyback, 
Smilowitz said. "Then they would charge a processing fee. Or they would say 'I 
can't confirm the buyback, I'll get back to you.' Of course they wouldn't call 
back." 
</P>
<P>
Smilowitz said the company sometimes bought back coins, but often at a lower 
market price. 
</P>
<P>
Buyers also complained that delivery of coins was promised within 2 or 3 weeks, 
but were sometimes 6 months late. 
</P>
<P>
Rarities attorney Douglas Smith said the firm admitted no wrongdoing in 
settling the case. 
</P>
<P>
"We basically made a business decision, that rather than litigate those claims, 
we decided to work out an agreement with the attorney general's office," Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The complaints stemmed from sales that occurred before 1987, "when Rarities was 
a much younger organization," Smith said. The company incorporated in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that at least three sales employees were dismissed because of the 
allegations.

WEEKEND APPEARANCE IN O.C.;

<P>
NEWMAN'S LAND OF BROKEN DREAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It seems that Randy Newman, the unmannerly cuss who insulted all those short 
people back in 1977, has written a new hymn so pure, so honest, so 
right-thinking and unobjectionably full of fervent faith in his fellow man 
that, given the right break, it could become a standard at high school 
graduations. 
</P>
<P>
But with Newman, who plays Saturday and Sunday at the Coach House, seems is an 
awfully big word. Newman is pop music's preeminent satirist, and that means his 
songs are seldom, if ever, as they seem. 
</P>
<P>
So it's not easy to tell what Newman is up to in "Follow the Flag," the 
seemingly earnest hymn from his most recent album, "Land of Dreams." The song 
-- like half the Bruce Springsteen songbook -- is an ode to dreamers, and what 
could be satiric about that? Its speaker cherishes a sense of community and 
belonging as he envisions people going forth to "follow the flag" -- to pursue 
a patriotic ideal, or any other lofty goal that a "flag" might symbolize. "If 
you can believe in something bigger than yourself/You can follow the flag 
forever," Newman sings in a plain, humble voice that betrays no sarcastic 
intent. 
</P>
<P>
It's only in the songs that surround "Follow the Flag" on "Land of Dreams" that 
Newman's intention becomes clear. The album is made up of a series of cycles in 
which dreams are hatched, only to be dashed in harsh awakenings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a blue blue morning, a blue blue day/All your bad dreams drift away," 
Newman sings in "New Orleans Wins the War," a sweetly idyllic, 
semi-autobiographical song about his toddler days in New Orleans. A moment 
later, in "Four Eyes," harrowing, percussive blasts of sound explode the dream 
as the song recounts young Randy's rude expulsion from the cocoon of babyhood 
into an all-too-real, school-days world of parental demands and classmates' 
cruelty. 
</P>
<P>
In the album's context, the ideals of "Follow the Flag" are just one more 
pathetic pipe dream. No sooner does the innocent hymn end, than Newman cranks 
up his half-mocking, half-lamenting account of society's real ideals: "It's 
Money That Matters." Not a song that you would care to have high school kids 
sing as they get their diplomas, even if it's what they might indeed be 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
For Newman, the hidden and delayed ironic punch of "Follow The Flag" is a way 
of keeping his songwriting fresh after so many years of writing satires that 
strike with a quick, sharp bite. 
</P>
<P>
"A song like 'Follow the Flag' is very close (to being straightforward)," 
Newman said in a recent phone interview from a tour stop in Portland. "There's 
almost no hint that I think the guy (in the song) is dumb. Yet I don't believe 
much of what he's saying. I thought of putting a coda on the song (to make its 
irony more evident), but I didn't. It's close to the line, which I may do more 
of in the future." 
</P>
<P>
The autobiographical element that crops up in the opening, childhood-days 
sequence of "Land of Dreams" marks another new approach for Newman, whose 
previous work usually found the singer donning one assumed persona after 
another. And one further change could be in the offing: "I've never written 
songs where the singer in the song is intelligent," meaning, presumably, that 
the persona would be too smart to fall into the ironic traps that Newman 
perpetually digs for his characters. "I don't know what intelligent people 
would say in songs, but I'd like to try it." 
</P>
<P>
At 44, Newman said, he is conscious of the need to keep experimenting to avoid 
staleness. 
</P>
<P>
"There is some evidence that this is a young person's business. A lot of 
(songwriters) aren't getting better -- they're getting worse. I want to be at 
least as good as I was in the past, and I certainly don't want to get any 
worse. If I didn't think I was doing at least as well, I'd do something else." 
</P>
<P>
Through nine albums, plus the film score he wrote for "Ragtime," Newman has 
become one of the most acclaimed songwriters in pop. Other songwriters often 
cite him as a favorite for nuanced songs that can be funny, bitter, and warmly 
humane -- sometimes all within the same number. 
</P>
<P>
While such excellence has had its rewards, Newman is quick to note that mass 
appeal isn't one of them. He remains a cult figure whose husky, drawling 
delivery and frequently acerbic stance make him an artist too demanding for 
audiences not willing to invest their intelligence and imagination in listening 
to music. 
</P>
<P>
"If the world were made up of songwriters, I'd be Phil Collins," Newman said, 
with more humor than bitterness in his voice. "In England, Mark Knopfler (the 
Dire Straits leader who produced and performed on most of the songs on 'Land of 
Dreams') wanted me to be successful so badly that he did this British Music 
Awards thing with me on TV. It was like charity. It was his Amnesty tour." 
</P>
<P>
This star endorsement and television exposure didn't help much, Newman said. "I 
sell more albums in Belgium than in England." 
</P>
<P>
While his persistent use of irony and satire may limit Newman's sales, he 
doesn't think his indirect method has kept his ideas and values from being 
properly understood. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I don't take this medium seriously enough to express a direct emotion," 
said Newman, whose craftsmanship attests to a serious-enough regard for his 
art. "But I think you can tell what I think about things as clearly or more 
clearly than any songwriter you could name." 
</P>
<P>
In some of his darker, dagger-pointed songs, one gets the impression that 
Newman -- like such great literary satirists as Jonathan Swift and Mark Twain 
-- doesn't have a particularly high opinion of the human enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
Newman said he tries to be careful not to fall into cynicism. Ultimately, like 
Swift and Twain, Newman rises above cynicism by endorsing, however indirectly, 
feelings and values that cherish the good in man, even as his songs mock or 
lacerate the bad. 
</P>
<P>
"The only song that really bothers me in retrospect is 'The Blues' (from his 
1983 album, 'Trouble in Paradise'), where I sort of made fun of a kid who finds 
solace in music. I think about it all the time: 'Are you being just a crusty, 
misanthropic type?' -- which I've always hated. I always think that the people 
in the audience are better than the people I'm singing about. I know they are." 
</P>
<P>
If Newman has stayed clear of cynicism, he has been less successful in 
overcoming a tendency to procrastinate. "Land of Dreams" arrived 5 years after 
Newman's previous album, "Born Again." A 2 1/2-year struggle with Epstein-Barr 
syndrome, an illness that causes severe, lingering fatigue, prolonged the 
delay. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I could have five more albums out," Newman said. "Ten albums in 20 
years doesn't make me happy. I admire someone like Elton John, who can turn out 
a good deal of work. Or Johnny Williams, who can turn out a (movie score) in 6 
weeks and then do another one. I have bad work habits and not enough of the old 
American work ethic. I spend my life wondering where the time goes -- reading, 
playing basketball, playing with the kids, watching television." 
</P>
<P>
Randy Newman plays Saturday and Sunday at the Coach House, 33157 Camino 
Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Tickets are $32.50 and are available only for 
the 10:30 p.m. show on Sunday. Information: (714) 496-8930.

JOHN DOE'S NEW WORK THROBS WITH ADVENTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Where X typically packed the Coach House on its many forays there, X 
guiding-light John Doe drew a far-from-capacity crowd Wednesday, when he 
presented the debuts of new songs and a new band. It's a shame, for Doe's 
25-song set, while moving in a still-rootsier direction than his old band was 
headed, was brimming with the sense of musical adventure and honesty that 
marked X's finest moments. 
</P>
<P>
Chief among the show's surprises was that Doe has become a full-fledged 
troubadour, more than able to carry a show on his own. Where once his attempts 
at Phil Ochs-styled balladry or grainy country standards required a certain 
amount of bemused indulgence from his listeners, Doe has grown remarkably since 
X's indefinite split commenced last year. 
</P>
<P>
In place of the earnest-yet-amateurish vocals that marked his roots efforts 
with X and the offshoot acoustic Knitters, Doe's singing Wednesday was a 
near-revelation. Sacrificing none of its directness, his voice displayed an 
impressive passion, range and power -- even effectively belting out an Elvis 
tribute on Dave Bartholomew's "One Night of Sin," the seamy archetype for the 
King's "One Night With You." 
</P>
<P>
With that voice and several of the new songs he introduced, Doe could well 
become the equal of his hero Ochs, though a rousing solo version of the late 
folk singer's "The Chords of Fame" -- a cautionary tale of a musician who 
abandoned his honesty -- set a high standard to live up to. Doe was equally 
effective performing solo and backed by a nimble roots-hopping trio of 
Blasters' drummer Bill Bateman, K.D. Lang guitarist Greg Leisz and bassist Tony 
Marsico, rescued from the Cruzados' new heavy-metal incarnation. Even X 
standards such as "See How We Are" and "Hot House" were performed with an 
incendiary zeal that made the prospect of an X-less future seem less ruinous. 
</P>
<P>
Doe freely blended folk, country and rock on his new hard-driving "Prisoner," 
the 12-string propelled "Twisted Rendezvous," "Tape Number 52," an update on 
the jukebox-weeper sub-genre, and a rendingly forlorn ballad, "It's Only Love, 
It'll Go Away." 
</P>
<P>
Though Doe claimed in a recent interview to be disaffected with Los Angeles and 
is soon moving to the high desert, Doe's best new songs were those that dealt 
with the town and its ways. In one he pined, "Step out on your balcony, and see 
your city in bloom. Listen to the sound of guns going off, and try to sleep by 
the light of the moon." 
</P>
<P>
His most caustic lines were reserved for those who use BMWs as the measure of 
achievement success in "Liar's Market": "It's a liar's market and I'm trying to 
sell the truth. If I could be a liar, I could get as far as you."

INTRODUCING YOUNGSTERS TO 'PEOPLE OF THE SNOW' RIGHT IN AN IRVINE PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
If the kids have been clamoring for a little kilaujatut, load 'em up in the 
family komatik and head for "Igloos of Fun," the Irvine Fine Arts Center ninth 
annual Youth Art Day. But you had better leave the aiverk at home. 
</P>
<P>
If by chance you don't speak Inutitut, the language of the Inuit Eskimo, those 
exotic-sounding words mean, respectively, drum dancing, sled and walrus -- not 
exactly part of the average county schoolchild's vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
But on Saturday, the Inuit come to Irvine. Well, sort of. From 10 a.m. to 3 
p.m., children ages 3 to 10 can sample the lighter side of life among these 
hardy "people of the snow" in a day of art workshops, entertainment and games 
on the center's grounds in Heritage Park. 
</P>
<P>
The children's festival coincides with four Eskimo-themed exhibits on display 
at the center through April 28. They are "Inuit Games: Traditional Sport and 
Play of the Eskimo," a collection of stone-cut prints and soapstone sculpture 
by Eskimo artists that depict games of skill and endurance; artifacts of the 
Bering Sea Eskimos from Bowers Museum's permanent collection, and "The 
Grandparents of My Gloves," a retrospective by Berkeley dancer Patricia Bulitt, 
which features costumes, recordings and mixed-media remembrances of Bulitt's 
10-year cultural exchange with Eskimos. 
</P>
<P>
Bulitt recently shared her experiences with teachers from the Irvine Unified 
School District. District teachers passed on the lesson to their students, who 
interpreted their studies in a series of drawings, poetry and clay sculptures 
displayed at the center's gallery. (A drawing by Culverdale School student Mike 
Jazayeri sums up the children's cross-cultural experience with a decidedly 
California flair: The Alaskan god of summer, a six-armed figure, wears 
sunglasses and clutches a hot dog, an ice cream cone and a Beach Boys album.) 
</P>
<P>
Docent tours of the exhibits will be offered through the day. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's festivities center on seven, hourlong art workshops and several 
Eskimo games that will introduce children to the culture, said Jill Stute, the 
center's special events coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"The Inuit used games as a means of developing strength and manual dexterity," 
Stute said. "Theirs was a harsh way of life, and some of their games were very 
physically taxing. The kids can see those tougher games in the exhibit, and on 
the day of the festival they'll get hands-on experience with games like Eskimo 
yo-yos and bean-bag juggling." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Stute said, Dori Kirk Fitzgerald, the center's curator of 
exhibitions, will lead children in an authentic Eskimo hunting dance taught to 
her by Bullitt, and storytellers will share traditional tales of the Eskimo. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's balmy weather is a far cry from the Eskimo's chilly climate, so a snow 
machine will provide a frosting of real snow on the center's lawn. The snow 
will fall at 11 a.m. Depending on the weather, it should last about an hour, 
Stute said. 
</P>
<P>
Art workshops will begin at 10 a.m. In "Magical Masks," children 6 and older 
will create masks based on Arctic animals. "Snow Prints" introduces youngsters 
to a variation on Eskimo-style block printing. In "Charms and Spells," children 
will learn how good-luck charms and magic spells helped the Eskimo succeed in 
the hunt, then create their own charms in clay. 
</P>
<P>
"Arctic Antics" is a collaborative project in which small groups will create 
clay scenes of Eskimo life, which will be fired and later displayed in the 
center's gallery. 
</P>
<P>
"Go Fish" will be geared for children ages 3 to 5. In it, children will learn 
about fish as a staple in the Eskimo diet, then design and decorate their own 
fish from a grab bag of art materials. In the "Drawing and Painting 
Expedition," children will hear tales of the Eskimo hunt, then depict their 
impressions in mixed media. "It's Snowing" will let young artists create snow 
by drawing Arctic scenes, then applying a solution of epsom salts that form 
snowlike crystals on the paper. 
</P>
<P>
Two drop-in workshops -- "Arctic Mural," in which youngsters will contrast 
their life style with the Eskimo's on two large murals, and "Build Your Own 
Igloo," a construction project of fair-weather igloos of cardboard and paint -- 
will be offered throughout the day. Face-painting will also be available for a 
small fee. 
</P>
<P>
In the center's courtyard, such local entertainers as the Lori Hansen Dancers, 
the Rainbow Singers and Sky Badger, an American Indian who tells folk stories, 
will be presented. Food will be sold from 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Youth Art day will be Saturday at the Irvine Fine Arts Center, 14321 Yale Ave. 
in Irvine's Heritage Park. Attendance is open to the entire family. Children 
under 6 must be accompanied by an adult. Walk-in registration will begin at 9 
a.m. Registration fee is $9 per child and includes two 1-hour workshops, both 
drop-in workshops and all entertainment and games. Adults are free.

L.P. REPERTORY HAS A HUSKY ANGEL

<TEXT>

Former Rams defensive back Johnny Johnson, now a member of the Seattle Seahawks 
organization, is rooting for the financially strapped L.P. Repertory in Tustin. 
And he is bringing former teammates with him tonight to see the current 
production, "The Night of January 16th," says theater manager William Durkin. 
Why the interest? Johnson's wife, Julie Gray, is playing one of the major roles 
in Ayn Rand's courtroom drama. It is part of an effort to improve attendance at 
the dinner theater, which is about a month behind in its $8,100 monthly rent, 
Durkin said.

FAR-FROM-RETIRING ACTIVISTS MAKE LEISURE WORLD A POLITICAL FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAT GERBER, Times Staff Writer: Pat Gerber is a regular contributor to 
Orange County Life.

<TEXT>
<P>
When Vice President Dan Quayle was stumping for votes last fall in a race 
marred by allegations that he had used family connections to avoid active duty 
in Vietnam, his campaign managers made sure his itinerary included a stop at 
Leisure World in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
They figured he would be guaranteed a warm reception, and they were right. With 
less than two days' notice, Leisure World's Republican Club had no trouble 
filling a meeting hall with a sympathetic crowd of about 1,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert Schwartz, president of the Republican Club, grinned as he remembered 
Quayle's visit -- and the time last year when he asked state Sen. William 
Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) to speak at a Republican Club meeting at Leisure 
World. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't have to ask twice. 
</P>
<P>
Although Campbell, whose district extends to the retirement community, was 
immersed in legislative business, he flew down from Sacramento, gave the speech 
and flew back, all in one evening. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle and Campbell are among a long list of politicians, primarily 
Republicans, who have received warm welcomes behind Leisure World's 6-foot-high 
walls. Other Republicans have included Ronald Reagan (during his bid for the 
presidency in 1976), Gov. George Deukmejian, U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, state Sen. 
Marian Bergeson of Newport Beach and a host of local politicians. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Khachigian, a San Clemente lawyer who was a chief strategist for the Quayle 
campaign and a senior adviser to Deukmejian during his last run for governor, 
said, "I would never think of going through a Republican statewide campaign -- 
or a countywide campaign -- without sending the candidate to Leisure World." 
</P>
<P>
National, state and local Republican politicians' eagerness to speak to this 
group of voters is a telling measure of the well-organized political clout the 
retirement community has amassed to protect its interests and its life style. 
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the community's 25th anniversary celebration, residents are more 
outspoken than ever, with their attention focused on the proposal for Laguna 
Hills cityhood that will be put to a public vote June 6. If Laguna Hills 
becomes the county's 29th city, Leisure World is expected to be its largest, 
best-organized and most vocal constituency. 
</P>
<P>
For Republican politicians, the logic of choosing Leisure World as a prime 
stumping ground is obvious, Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
Leisure World's Republican Club -- whose membership of 1,200 swells to 2,000 in 
election years -- claims to be the largest in the country. (The community's 
Democratic Club has 250 members, but President Helen Mills said membership has 
been slowly growing in recent years.) 
</P>
<P>
Voter registration within Leisure World is 62% Republican, 32% Democrat -- 
compared to 55% Republican, 35% Democrat countywide, according to the county 
registrar of voters. (The American Assn. of Retired Persons estimates that 
about 40% of its members -- age 50 and over -- are Republican, 40% Democrat.) 
</P>
<P>
And Leisure World residents are more politically active than the rest of the 
county, with 78% of them registered to vote, compared to 53% of the county 
population. 
</P>
<P>
"Our generation was brought up to vote," said Marion Miller D'Onofrio, a past 
president of Leisure World's Republican Club and one of five Leisure World 
residents chosen by lawmakers to serve as delegates to the state Republican 
convention in February. 
</P>
<P>
Leisure World represents the most formidably organized constituency in the 
state, said a spokeswoman for Campbell, who recently introduced legislation to 
increase benefits for retired teachers. The legislation, which is backed by the 
governor and is now in committee, was the direct result of pressure from some 
of Campbell's Leisure World constituency, the spokeswoman noted. 
</P>
<P>
Although residents may contribute privately to candidates or campaigns, the 
Republican Club does no fund raising. Political fund-raiser Jackie Campbell of 
Huntington Beach, whose clients include Wilson, said she doesn't look to 
Leisure World residents for big political donations. However, she said, Leisure 
World residents contribute many "invaluable" volunteer hours, stuffing and 
stamping direct-mail campaign literature and mounting voter registration 
drives. 
</P>
<P>
Leisure World was never intended to be a politically active community. Indeed, 
community rules discourage public displays of political fervor -- posting 
placards, posters or handbills is forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
When it opened in September, 1964, developer Ross W. Cortese envisioned Leisure 
World as a secure community for people 55 and over who, after raising families 
or pursuing careers, were ready to settle into leisurely life styles, the 
developer said in a recent interview at his office in Laguna Hills. Activities 
in the 2,100-acre compound would center on such pursuits as golf, gardening, 
horseback riding and social clubs. It would be a planned, self-sufficient 
community with its own bus and security systems and maintenance facilities. 
Within the secure walls, life would be quiet, neat and litter free. If 
residents wanted to turn their backs on the outside world, well, they had 
earned -- and were paying for -- that right. 
</P>
<P>
Early on, the chore of governing this unincorporated community of about 21,000 
residents was distributed among 80 small mutual associations run by residents 
and set up to represent different segments of the community. But the multitude 
of independent governing bodies proved to be unwieldy for a community of this 
size. They were eventually consolidated into three: 
</P>
<P>
United Laguna Hills Mutual, with 11 directors, representing 6,323 co-op units. 
</P>
<P>
Third Laguna Hills Mutual, with 15 directors, representing 6,102 condominium 
units. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills Mutual 50, with five directors and 311 units, represents a segment 
called The Towers, two 14-story, full-service, high-rise buildings where such 
amenities as three meals a day and maid and laundry service are provided. 
</P>
<P>
From the governing ranks of these mutuals are chosen the 15 elected directors 
of the Golden Rain Foundation of Laguna Hills, the main governing body that 
sets policy for all the mutuals and whose role is comparable to that played by 
a city council. The foundation is charged with maintaining the six clubhouses 
-- including an 834-seat amphitheater -- five swimming pools, two professional 
golf courses, eight tennis courts, equestrian center, bus system and 
closed-circuit television station. The foundation also oversees a security 
system that includes 14 guarded entrances staffed by 250 Leisure World 
residents who work part time and 22 residents who work full time as security 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
Russell L. Disbro, general manager of Professional Community Management Inc., 
which is responsible for administering Leisure World's approximately 
$63-million annual budget, said Leisure World is best described as a giant 
homeowners association, where residents pay average monthly fees ranging from 
$225 to $300. When fee hikes are periodically proposed, residents -- whose 
condos sell for an estimated $60,000 to $600,000 today -- tend to protest loud 
and hard. 
</P>
<P>
But over the years, as the surrounding pasturelands have been replaced by a 
bulging, congested suburban community, the residents' activism has been 
directed increasingly at changes occurring outside their gates. 
</P>
<P>
Leisure World's citizens have responded to outside threats to their status quo 
with a fervor, organization and commitment usually associated with a 
grass-roots environmental or consumer movement. At some Orange County Planning 
Commission meetings, for example, they have been reprimanded for booing and 
being generally unruly, noted Myra Neben, editor of the Leisure World News. She 
has tracked the residents' political activities for the past 12 years and 
considers the community one of the largest concentrations of actively "astute, 
politically conscious" people anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"They have the time to be active, the time to write letters, to go to 
meetings," Neben said. 
</P>
<P>
Many also are used to exercising their influence, having retired from top-level 
positions at major corporations. 
</P>
<P>
And not all of the community's political activists are Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Minna Liebman, a Democrat, chuckles at the notion that she is an endangered 
species there. She describes herself as "left of liberal" but also a 
"pragmatist." 
</P>
<P>
Liebman recently stepped down as president of the Gray Panthers' Leisure World 
chapter, which she co-founded and headed for nearly a decade. She continues to 
work with the organization, an activist group that lobbies for rights for the 
elderly and is now pushing for a national health care program that would 
benefit both young and old. 
</P>
<P>
During the last election, Liebman organized an appearance at Leisure World by 
consumer activist Ralph Nader, who was campaigning for Proposition 103 to 
reform the insurance industry. About 700 people turned out for his speech. 
</P>
<P>
Liebman, 76, stands just short of 5 feet, but the energy concentrated into her 
small frame would be the envy of a college student. She finds the local chapter 
of the American Assn. of Retired Persons too reticent. "All they want to do is 
play bingo," she sniffed. 
</P>
<P>
The activism of people like Liebman has caused developers as well as 
politicians to take notice. Commercial and residential developers are careful 
to touch base with Leisure World's planning review committee on projects they 
want to build adjacent to the retirement community. And it is not unusual for 
developers to change building plans to accommodate the committee's requests or 
objections. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Hoffman, a senior director with the Irvine Co. who has dealt extensively 
with Leisure World on the 3,200-acre Laguna Laurel residential and commercial 
shopping center project, said her company wouldn't think of not showing the 
Leisure World review committee its plans for developments that will be adjacent 
to the community. It would be foolish to get to the Planning Commission stage 
and have a contingent of angry Leisure World residents show up to object, she 
said. The Irvine Co., in fact, scaled back the density of its Laguna Laurel 
project because Leisure World was concerned about increased traffic, Hoffman 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman described Leisure World representatives as "aggressive in forwarding 
their objectives" but also a pleasure to deal with because they are astute 
about the review process and do their homework. 
</P>
<P>
Developers have been generous in donating to Leisure World's 25-year 
anniversary celebration, which involves a series of special events beginning 
Saturday and continuing through Sept. 10. The Kathryn G. Thompson Development 
Co. of Irvine, which is building the Audubon project near Leisure World, tops 
the list of donors with a $50,000 gift, according to Debby Lamb, director of 
Leisure World's recreation division. The Irvine Co.'s $10,000 contribution was 
the second largest, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its clout, Leisure World doesn't always get what it wants. Residents 
have lost a number of battles against proposed utility rate hikes in the 
all-electric community. And a campaign to stop construction of a mortuary just 
outside Leisure World's walls failed. But it takes more than a few defeats to 
keep the community's more active members down. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most visible and politically influential people in Leisure World is 
71-year-old Herbert Schwartz. As president of the Republican Club and past 
president of the Golden Rain Foundation, his clout within the walls of this 
retirement compound is secure. But Schwartz also commands a presence outside as 
well. He is a member of the invitation-only Lincoln Club, whose members include 
some of the best-known politicians and businessmen in the county. He is on the 
national board of governors of the American Jewish Committee and is chairman of 
the county's Friends of the Library Foundation. Schwartz recently stepped down 
as chairman of the board of the Orange County Community Development Council. 
</P>
<P>
But the role that consumes much of Schwartz's time these days is that of 
chairman of the Committee on Incorporation, the group that favors giving Laguna 
Hills city status. 
</P>
<P>
The issue has galvanized residents like no other in recent memory -- some say 
it is the most important decision Leisure World as a community will ever have 
to make. 
</P>
<P>
Past cityhood efforts involving Leisure World have gone down in defeat. 
Residents managed to have the community excluded from a proposed city of 
Saddleback Valley, which voters rejected last November. An earlier Saddleback 
Valley cityhood effort failed in 1981, as did moves in 1980 and 1982 to make 
Leisure World itself a city. This most recent cityhood proposal, approved in 
January by the Local Agency Formation Commission, will be on the June 6 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed city of Laguna Hills would contain an estimated 45,000 residents 
on 6,000 acres between Interstate 5 on the east and the Aliso Viejo planned 
community on the west. The city would border unincorporated Laguna Niguel on 
the south and the city of Irvine on the north. Leisure World would form the 
geographic core. 
</P>
<P>
The issue has set up a major political confrontation between pro-and-con 
factions within Leisure World and has been the source of heated debate. 
</P>
<P>
Al Hanson, 77, a board member of the Golden Rain Foundation, is pro-cityhood 
and heads a Golden Rain subcommittee that is advancing the cityhood proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't stay inside of our cocoon and ignore what goes on around us," Hanson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He believes that had Leisure World been a city it could have prevented such 
problems as the heavy traffic on El Toro Road. He also believes that as a city, 
Leisure World will ensure its effectiveness in the long-running battle against 
commercial use of El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. (The Leisure World Airport 
Awareness Committee collected about $50,000 within a few weeks last year from 
residents to fight commercial use of El Toro.) 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz, a retired accounting executive who religiously avoided politics 
during his working life, becomes animated when discussing cityhood. He is 
convinced it is inevitable for the private community in which he has lived 
since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"Take a look outside these walls," he said. "Our places of worship are outside 
these walls. Shops, doctors, entertainment are all outside these walls. To have 
a voice in what happens there, you can't depend on the county." 
</P>
<P>
Leisure World is now nothing more than a homeowners association divided 
geographically into separate segments, he said. "A city would speak as one 
voice." Schwartz feels so strongly about the cityhood issue that, along with 
Leisure World resident Jerard B. Werner, he was among the first to enter the 
race for the five-member City Council to be elected June 6 if cityhood is 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
Wally Bjornson, 71, strongly disagrees with Schwartz. Bjornson, retired from 
the Air Force and aerospace industry, came to Leisure World in 1981 to get away 
from the headaches of the outside world. He doesn't relish dealing with them 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to see us involved with the outside city or area," he said. 
Cities only generate problems, Bjornson contends. "There's nothing that 
(cityhood) could do for us that's not being done already." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the outcome, when the cityhood issue is resolved, some other issue 
will inevitably surface, with residents making sure their voices are heard. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz spoke for many of his neighbors when he said, "As long as I have 
something to say, I want to be involved. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Said Minna Liebman: "We're not ready to retire yet."

ANN CONWAY: FOR THESE WORLD TRAVELERS, HOME IS WHERE THE HEART IS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Violinist Murray Korda really should have struck up "The Theme From Doctor 
Zhivago" when he serenaded members of Travel Club One at their recent party in 
Leisure World, Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
After all, "it's their favorite," said Korda, who has played for kings, queens, 
celebs and society's upper crust. (Korda knows. He was the first paid 
professional to entertain at Leisure World 24 years ago.) 
</P>
<P>
But at a dinner themed to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the 
Shangri-La-like retirement community, Korda chose to give club members an 
international program -- waltzes from France and Vienna, even Japanese 
classics. 
</P>
<P>
"Because these travelers have been there," Korda said. "Everywhere -- Europe, 
Japan, South America. . . ." ("Besides," he added. "I'm sick of 'Doctor 
Zhivago.' I've played it a thousand times!") 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. Eighty-three-year-old George Rowley, once an animator for Walt Disney 
movies -- including "Snow White," "Bambi" and "Pinocchio" -- said he has been 
to Europe, including Scandinavia, four times. His date, Jean Brokaw -- mother 
of NBC news anchor Tom Brokaw -- said she has been to Europe twice. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from the camaraderie of the 400 party-goers, however, it was more than 
wanderlust that brought them together. 
</P>
<P>
"It's Leisure World," said Brokaw, whose husband died 2 years after the couple 
moved to the community in 1980. "I love everything about the place. And it's 
George Rowley. I joined the club because George was my friend and he belonged." 
</P>
<P>
(Neither Brokaw nor Rowley, a Leisure World resident since 1970, deny that the 
couple are "an item." "He has a terrific sense of humor, and he's a real 
gentleman," Brokaw said, gazing up at the lanky, dinner-jacket-clad Rowley. 
"He's very nice and very handsome." 
</P>
<P>
("Jean is wonderful company -- a very special person," said Rowley, gazing down 
at silver-haired Brokaw, resplendent in cornflower-blue chiffon. "She's 
good-looking and very popular. So there you are!") 
</P>
<P>
After moving through a reception line, Brokaw and Rowley settled down with 
fellow travelers to enjoy fruit salad, chicken and the dreamy concert by Korda. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd was a biographer's dream. For example, consider Olive Leonard. The 
91-year-old musician once played background piano for the silent movie version 
of "Ben Hur." "I put the chariot race to music," said Leonard, who, according 
to Rowley, "plays piano for just about every club in Leisure World." 
</P>
<P>
"You had to sit in this pit and play as the action unfolded right under your 
nose," Leonard said. 
</P>
<P>
And consider Dr. Tracy E. Strevey. The tall, gray and handsome 87-year-old (who 
looks 20 years younger) is editing the 25-year history of Leisure World, 
scheduled for publication in June. "I'm editing the book and writing one of its 
11 chapters," said Strevey, once dean of letters, arts and sciences at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to make a wish on behalf of Leisure World's next 25 years, Strevey said: 
"I wish it to continue, as much as possible, like it is -- with the wonderful 
kind of people here who have made it a wonderful and unique retirement center." 
</P>
<P>
The secret to his vigorous longevity ("I shoot my age in golf," he noted): 
"Keep active, busy. Use your mind. Become involved." 
</P>
<P>
A sterling party for the golden years: A dinner-dance and keynote address by 
Art Linkletter will formally launch Leisure World's 25th anniversary 
celebration Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the agenda of the 6 p.m. event in Clubhouse 5: a salute to Leisure 
World founder Ross Cortese and five of the community's original residents -- 
Lucille Beller, Hazel Watson, Margaret Archer, Kathleen Harper and Nancy Young. 
</P>
<P>
When Linkletter speaks to the 350 seniors who are expected to attend the party, 
he will zero in on the life style that Leisure World affords them. 
</P>
<P>
One of the bonuses for the more than 20,000 residents of Leisure World is the 
opportunity to continue to make friends, Linkletter says. 
</P>
<P>
"Constant companionship is available to the inhabitants of Leisure World. If 
seniors don't make new friends, they put themselves in a constricting circle. 
They need to be able to meet people, look to the future and know they won't 
have to spend it alone." 
</P>
<P>
Linkletter says he gives hundreds of lectures annually. And he likes to tell 
his listeners: "The important thing is to make the best of the way things have 
turned out for you and not sit around wishing they'd been different. You have 
to live life to the fullest every day in order to be happy."

LEISURE WORLD KIWANIANS SHEPHERD WAYWARD YOUTHS FROM JOPLIN CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAWN STONE, Dawn Stone, 15, is a junior at El Toro High School, where she is 
the editor of the student newspaper, the BullETin, a member of the academic 
competition team and treasurer of Keywanettes. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The contrast is striking. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Saddleback Kiwanis Club, a group of well-off, educated retirees 
from Leisure World in Laguna Hills, laughing, joking and sharing experiences 
with teen-age boys serving court-ordered time at a probationary center. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 20 years, the Leisure World-based group has sponsored Service 
Gents, a club designed to teach the teen-agers housed at the Joplin Youth 
Center such skills as gaining self-confidence, giving a speech, running a 
meeting and handling a job interview. 
</P>
<P>
"We do everything to encourage them to have self-confidence. That's what they 
lack," said Kiwanis Club member John Stransky, head of the program for the past 
9 years. 
</P>
<P>
Every Wednesday evening, Stransky and three or four other Kiwanis Club members 
join eight to 12 youths, ages 14 to 17, in a Service Gents meeting at the 
center, which is tucked away in Trabuco Canyon and operated by the Orange 
County Probation Office. Every Saddleback Kiwanian is required to attend at 
least one such meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Freestone, a Kiwanian who attends Service Gents meetings about once 
every 3 months, said: "I come because I want to be helpful. Kiwanis is 
organized to serve its community, and this group is one of our major projects. 
They're good boys in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Roland Stewart, a regular at Service Gents meetings, added: "I like dealing 
with the boys, and this gives me a good opportunity to see the younger people. 
They're neat kids, and it's fun to talk to them." 
</P>
<P>
At each gathering, Kiwanians watch as the elected teen-age president of Service 
Gents leads the meeting by introducing that week's speakers and program. 
</P>
<P>
Each week, four or five teen-agers get an opportunity to practice public 
speaking by giving short talks on topics of their choice. The Kiwanis members 
in attendance critique each speech, offering helpful comments on eye contact, 
poise and preparation. 
</P>
<P>
Said one of the Joplin teen-agers, whose names cannot be used because of their 
age: "You can learn public speaking so you can overcome nervousness. Doing 
speeches also helps you learn how to do research." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart emphasized the value of these public-speaking exercises: "You watch 
them progress. One of the boys will get up and he'll do a lousy job with his 
speech. Then you come up 6 weeks later and he does a good job, and then 6 weeks 
later, he's a pro. It's just real heartwarming to see how John (Stransky) 
brings these kids along." 
</P>
<P>
"Most of these kids have lived by their wits," Joplin director Al Lindeman said 
of the boys, who are serving an average of 100 days each at the center, 
primarily for gang-related crimes or crimes against property. 
</P>
<P>
"They have not had the resources we think of the typical American kid having, 
with his strong family support system," Lindeman said. "Most of them have not 
had good experiences in schools. When they come here, they usually have 
developed some very thick callouses, and they're used to being tough. We create 
an environment here where they can relax and just be teen-age kids." 
</P>
<P>
A key part of the weekly program is the talk presented by a Kiwanian. 
Sometimes, the talk will be practical, such as giving tips on how to speak in 
public or how to build self-confidence. Club members have also spoken about 
such hobbies as calligraphy, clarinets and telescopes. 
</P>
<P>
The boys appear to sincerely appreciate the Kiwanians' efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to go to Service Gents and listen to the men talk about their hobbies," 
one Joplin boy said. "We appreciate that and enjoy listening to them talk." 
</P>
<P>
Added another: "I really enjoy Service Gents because I enjoy learning things 
like what things are expected from you on a job interview. They (the Kiwanians) 
teach the importance of helping out other people." 
</P>
<P>
The Kiwanis members have not only taught the boys how to help themselves but 
also how to help others. Service Gents raises $600 to $800 for local charities 
at its annual car wash held in May at Geneva Presbyterian Church on El Toro 
Road in Laguna Hills. Proceeds are divided among such charities as the 
Orangewood Children's Foundation for abused and abandoned youngsters, New 
York's Covenant House for runaways and the South Coast Youth Shelter in Laguna 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Extra money earned last year helped to purchase radios for the Joplin Youth 
Center, and in previous years, extra car-wash monies have gone to buy a 
refrigerator, curtains for the dorm windows and a gas-operated barbecue for the 
youth center. 
</P>
<P>
Another Service Gents project is the preparation of food baskets for needy 
south Orange County families at Thanksgiving and Christmas. And the Kiwanis 
Foundation has bought the Service Gents a router plane so that the youths can 
make Christmas toys for Childrens Hospital of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Close interaction between the Joplin teen-agers and the Kiwanis Club members is 
the backbone of the Service Gents organization. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to their weekly Wednesday night meetings, the boys attend a Kiwanis 
Club lunch meeting at Leisure World one Monday a month. Service Gents 
teen-agers also help out at the Kiwanis Club's annual pancake breakfast, which 
is held in May at Leisure World. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the 60 boys at Joplin are eligible to participate in Service 
Gents, based on citizenship levels and a daily grading system. The club can 
accommodate up to 14 teen-agers, and membership usually ranges between eight 
and 12 boys. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a commitment," Lindeman said. "It's like a job. You don't just quit. You 
give notice. You say why, because we're trying to teach that concept. It's 
popular enough so that they (the boys) will give up an evening of free time to 
go to it. Instead of playing Ping-Pong or pool or football, they come to this 
meeting and give a speech." 
</P>
<P>
Explaining why he and other teen-agers would sacrifice their free time to 
become involved in Service Gents, the club's president said: "They (the Kiwanis 
members) give us ideas so we can see the talents we have. They are very helpful 
because they try to encourage us to follow any goals we might have." 
</P>
<P>
Added Freestone: "They (the boys) talk about setting goals, and if you can keep 
them motivated to arrive at something close to that, you feel like you've done 
an excellent job."

Good health means good timing -- from when you rise and shine to when you eat, 
work and exercise. You can stay in step with your body clock by knowing a 
little about its natural peaks and troughs. 
</P>
<P>
The following describes the best time of day to engage in various mental and 
physical activities. 
</P>
<P>
The Best Time. . . . 
</P>
<P>
* To rise and shine: The moment you wake up. Don't linger in bed, as you may 
use this time to dwell on unpleasant thoughts and start the day tense and 
anxious. 
</P>
<P>
* To made decisions: Early morning, 8 to 8:30 a.m., when anxiety and depression 
are at their lowest. The worst time is 2 to 7 p.m., when anxiety and depression 
are highest. Neutral hours are 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
* To study for a final: In the evening, before going to bed. The shorter the 
delay between study and bedtime, the more likely you are to retain the 
knowledge. Falling asleep to taped information improves retention even more, 
because the subconscious mind is open to suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
* To count to 10: The three half-hours before breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
Hunger pangs and low blood sugar can make you more irritable and likely to lose 
your cool during these three "hot spots," so start counting when tempers flare. 
</P>

A man tried to hijack a Soviet jetliner to Pakistan and held the 75 passengers 
hostage for a while, but KGB police subdued him and no one was injured, the 
Foreign Ministry said today. 
</P>
<P>
Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfilyev said a man identified as Stanislav Skok, 22, 
boarded the jet at Voronezh on Thursday and threatened to blow it up unless he 
was given $855,000 and flown to Pakistan. The TU-134 jet was en route to the 
Caspian Sea port of Baku, 800 miles away, and when it landed there, Perfilyev 
said, negotiations led to Skok's capture.

CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE STUDENT'S CAR BOMBED; TWO MEN SEIZED

<P>
Two young men were arrested today after a small homemade bomb exploded and 
heavily damaged a student's car that was unoccupied and parked near the Cal 
State Northridge campus. 
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries. Police refused to release the identities of the 
20-year-old owner of the car or the suspects, who are 21 and 20 years old and 
were arrested on suspicion of possession of an explosive device. 
</P>
<P>
The explosive device, which had been placed on the rear window of a Mustang in 
a student housing parking lot in the 9500 block of Zelzah Avenue, exploded 
about 12:30 a.m. today, police said. The blast blew out the windows, tore a 
hole in the trunk and roof and partially burned the back of the car. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Patrick Metoyer of LAPD's criminal conspiracy unit said the 
motivation for the car bombing was a dispute between the girlfriend of one of 
the suspects and the owner of the car. He declined to elaborate further.

5 KILLED AS PLANE CRASHES AT NEWPORT BEACH TENNIS CLUB; 
</P>
<P>
3 ON COURT NARROWLY MISS DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A private plane crashed onto a tennis court at the posh Newport Beach Tennis 
Club this morning and exploded in a huge fireball, killing as many as five 
people aboard and narrowly missing a tennis pro and two students. 
</P>
<P>
The plane, a twin-engine Piper Aerostar from Canada, had just taken off from 
John Wayne Airport at 8:33 a.m. and was trying to return. The pilot was in 
contact with air traffic controllers at the time. Airport Manager George 
Rebella said it appeared the plane had lost power. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the plane was in a steep dive toward the tennis club, then nosed 
straight down apparently in an attempt to miss the clubhouse, which at that 
time contained an estimated 125 people. No one on the ground was injured. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities did not immediately identify the dead. They said the plane was 
company-owned and was based in Camrose, Alberta. The flight plan showed it was 
headed for Pocatello, Ida., carrying two adults and three children, all members 
of one family. Airport officials said the plane had been serviced at the 
airport before taking off. 
</P>
<P>
The tennis club is located in the Eastbluff residential district of the city 
and near a shopping center and a school. 
</P>
<P>
The plane crashed onto a tennis court about 20 yards from the corner of the 
clubhouse where instructor Bernie Mitton was volleying with his students. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Treated for Shock 
</P>
<P>
Mitton, 34, of Irvine, who was treated for shock but was otherwise unhurt, said 
one of his students shouted, "There's a plane coming!" He looked up and saw the 
plane falling straight down. 
</P>
<P>
"I started to run into a corner but it seemed like the plane just kept 
following me," Mitton said. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran out of the corner and within seconds it crashed and immediately exploded 
and burst into flames. If I had stayed in that corner I would have been dead. 
</P>
<P>
"As I ran away, it exploded behind me. You could feel the intensity of the 
heat." 
</P>
<P>
The plane hit with such force that only a propeller cast to the side was easily 
recognizable as part of an airplane. 
</P>
<P>
The remains of the plane lay in a mound at the corner of the tennis court, 
where the court's chain-link boundary fence had been twisted and bent but had 
contained the wreckage like a safety net. 
</P>
<P>
Miraculously, virtually none of the wreckage was thrown to the other end of 
court where Mitton and his students had retreated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pilot's Action Told 
</P>
<P>
The students, Bob and June Vermes of Irvine, said it appeared the pilot was 
trying to steer the falling plane away from the players. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he saw us and knew that he was coming toward this building," Bob 
Vermes said. "He veered into where he did and missed everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Parker, owner of the tennis club, said the possibility of such a crash had 
been apparent to him for a long time. "Every day I see these planes take off. I 
can't tell you how many times I've thought of what might happen." 
</P>
<P>
He said if the crash had occurred later, all the tennis courts would have been 
full.

JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER ADMITS $151,000 CAMPAIGN GIFT

In a revelation that could topple his government, Prime Minister Noboru 
Takeshita acknowledged today that the company at the center of a stock-trading 
scandal bought $151,000 worth of tickets for a fund-raising party for him two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Takeshita's statement that he received what amounts to sizable political 
donations from the Recruit Co. is certain to increase pressure on him and his 
Cabinet to step down. 
</P>
<P>
"I have confirmed there was a purchase of tickets for the fund-raising party," 
Takeshita said in response to questions in an Upper House budget committee 
session. 
</P>
<P>
Takeshita acknowledged the amount of money Recruit Co. paid for tickets to the 
May, 1987, party was "slightly excessive," but he refused to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Such fund-raising parties are common among politicians and are a way of 
sidestepping legal restrictions on political donations. 
</P>
<P>
Corporations often buy a large number of tickets to show their support for 
politicians. But it is "quite unusual for one company to buy 20 million yen 
($151,000) worth of tickets at once," Health and Welfare Minister Junichiro 
Koizumi told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear if Recruit's ticket purchases would be considered 
outright political donations and thus subject to restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
An official of the Ministry of Home Affairs, which regulates political 
donations, said the purchases would be legal "as long as the price of each 
ticket is within the range of common sense and the number of tickets purchased 
is within a reasonable limit that a company can possibly use." 
</P>
<P>
Recruit, an information conglomerate, sold unlisted shares in a subsidiary at 
bargain prices in late 1986 to about 150 influential politicians, bureaucrats 
and businessmen, allowing them to profit handsomely when public trading began 
and the shares soared in price.

Champagne flowed, confetti fluttered and 21 guns fired to salute a troupe of 
perspiring actors who climbed 1,710 steps to the top of the Eiffel Tower today 
for the centennial of the Parisian landmark. 
</P>
<P>
Balloons and a brass band added to the festivities, in which the 30 huffing and 
puffing performers followed in the footsteps of Alexandre Gustave Eiffel. On 
March 31, 1889, he marked the completion of what was then the world's tallest 
tower by climbing 1,000 feet to the top and unfurling a blue, white and red 
flag. 
</P>
<P>
For the centennial celebration, the three levels of the pig-iron tower were 
transformed into outdoor cafes soaring above Paris in bloom: Fuchsia dogwoods 
marked the path to the Palais Chaillot across the Seine, rectangular beds of 
yellow, red and purple lined the Champs de Mars. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stick-on Sideburns 
</P>
<P>
Tables overflowed with hundreds of invited guests who sipped champagne served 
by gracious waiters in black vests, white aprons and stick-on mutton-chop 
sideburns. 
</P>
<P>
Television monitors scattered around the periphery of the tables tracked the 
progress of the actors up the stairs. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone who started at the foot of the tower a century ago with the 
energetic 55-year-old engineer made it to the top. Some were too pooped to go 
beyond the first level. One man, suffering from vertigo, had himself 
blindfolded at the second level and finished the climb. 
</P>
<P>
"This is where I get off, thank goodness," said 67-year-old actor Pierre 
Pauron, sitting down with a glass of cool champagne in the breeze at the second 
level 410 feet over Paris. "Monsieur Viguier, the man I am portraying, did not 
make it beyond here."

FBI ENTERS ALASKA SPILL INVESTIGATION;

SEEKS TO DETERMINE IF EXXON OR EMPLOYEES VIOLATED WATER ACT

<P>
The FBI said today it has opened an investigation into the nation's worst oil 
spill, the crash of the tanker Exxon Valdez off the Alaskan coast, to determine 
whether Exxon USA or its employees committed criminal violations of the Clean 
Water Act. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation is focusing on whether the spill of 10 million gallons of 
crude oil constituted "a negligent discharge of a pollutant into navigable 
waters of the United States," bureau spokesman Bill Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
Disclosure of the FBI's involvement came a day after Exxon fired the tanker 
captain, Joseph Hazelwood, upon receiving a report from federal investigators 
that he had failed a blood-alcohol test taken 10 hours after the accident, 
meaning he was drunk by legal definition. 
</P>
<P>
Only Tuesday, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said the Justice Department is 
monitoring the developments in Alaska, but would not "send the sleuths in" to 
investigate until the cleanup was under control. 
</P>
<P>
Carter said in a statement that "the FBI's Anchorage field office is conducting 
an investigation into the oil spill" in Alaska's Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Possible Criminal Violations' 
</P>
<P>
"The FBI's investigation is focusing on possible criminal violations of the 
Clean Water Act, Title 33, USC (United States Code) Section 1251 and 
specifically, negligent discharge of a pollutant into navigable waters of the 
United States." 
</P>
<P>
That section carries penalties ranging from fines of $50,000 per day to five 
years' imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
"This investigation is being fully coordinated with the Environmental 
Protection Agency, the Department of Justice's Land and Natural Resources 
Division, the U.S. Coast Guard, the National Transportation Safety Board, the 
U.S. attorney's office and the Alaska attorney general's office," the statement 
said.

The Supreme Court today set aside a $470-million settlement to victims of the 
Bhopal gas disaster until it rules on the validity of a law making the 
government the sole representative of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Sabyasachi Mukherjee said the settlement "stands stayed for all 
practical purposes," although no formal order was issued. 
</P>
<P>
In February the Supreme Court ordered Union Carbide Corp. to pay $470 million 
to compensate victims of the disaster, considered the world's worst industrial 
accident. The order set off a firestorm of criticism from victims and their 
lawyers, who said the amount was far too low.

Japan reported today that its trade surplus in goods and services climbed 17% 
in February to $7.71 billion, but economists and government officials said the 
surge was out of line with the basic trend. 
</P>
<P>
The merchandise trade surplus also leaped 26% to $9.02 billion in February from 
$7.15 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"It's true that the trade surplus is growing a bit, but February's figure is 
not representative of the general trend," said Ayako Yamaguchi, economist at 
the Bank of Tokyo. "The figure was unusually large." 
</P>
<P>
The surpluses shot upward because of a near halt in the growth of imports, 
which were up only a meager 1.8% in February to $12.97 billion, economists 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strength in Exports 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, exports grew at a strong 10.5% rate to $22 billion, helping 
swell the trade imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
A Finance Ministry official said the sudden jump in the trade surplus should 
not be taken as an indication that the process of improvement in Japan's trade 
imbalance is coming to a stop. 
</P>
<P>
He said the ministry expects a reduction in the surplus to begin soon, and 
preliminary March trade figures showed that imports are picking up 
substantially. 
</P>
<P>
"Although the current account surplus widened, it should reverse reasonably 
soon," said David Gerstenhaber, economist at Morgan Stanley International Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
Toshiaki Kakimoto, chief economist at Sumitomo Bank Ltd., said the small rise 
in imports reflected slow domestic economic activity before Emperor Hirohito's 
funeral at the end of February and aircraft purchases the previous year that 
helped make import growth look stunted this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Imports have not suddenly come to a halt. They will continue to grow," 
Kakimoto said. But it is still necessary for Japan to deregulate and free its 
markets, he added.

<P>
A federal appeals court today overturned a judge's order last September that 
blocked the consolidation of the Lucky and Alpha Beta supermarket chains, 
ruling that California had no right to undo the merger. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said there is evidence that the 
$2.5-billion buyout would lessen competition in the state, creating a chain 
that controlled 24% of the supermarket business statewide. Lucky is already the 
state's largest market chain, with 340 stores. 
</P>
<P>
But the court said the merger had already won Federal Trade Commission approval 
and been completed by the time California Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp 
challenged it. 
</P>
<P>
"California could have sued several months earlier and attempted to enjoin the 
merger before the stock sale was completed," said Judge J. Clifford Wallace in 
the 3-0 ruling. "The attorney general chose not to do so. California must 
accept the consequences of his choice." 
</P>
<P>
In his suit last September on behalf of the state, Van de Kamp said the merger 
could cost California shoppers $400 million by lessening competition and 
driving up prices. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Strumwasser, special counsel to Van de Kamp, declined comment, saying 
he had not yet read the ruling.

Top-seeded Ivan Lendl continued his straight-set streak today, sweeping Kevin 
Curren in the semifinals of the International Players Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl won 6-2, 6-2, 6-3, in one hour, 50 minutes. He has yet to lose a set in 
six rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl will play in Sunday's final, against the winner of tonight's match 
between 12th-seeded Yannick Noah and No. 7 Thomas Muster. 
</P>
<P>
Curren, seeded 13th, was good with only 51% of his first serves and had trouble 
putting away shots at the net. 
</P>
<P>
Curren lost the last four games of the first set and the last six games of the 
second set. In the final set, he scored six points in Lendl's five service 
games. 
</P>
<P>
The first service break came in the sixth game, when Lendl chased down a lob 
over his head and hit a brilliant backhand winner for a 4-2 lead.

New York Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor will be charged with driving while 
intoxicated, a prosecutor said today, one week after police found Taylor asleep 
at the wheel of his Jeep alongside a highway. 
</P>
<P>
A breath analysis after the episode on March 24 showed the perennial All-Pro 
linebacker had a blood-alcohol level of .09%, said Saddle Brook prosecutor 
Joseph Mecca Jr. Under New Jersey law, .10% is considered the legal definition 
for drunkenness. When deciding whether to prosecute, however, other factors can 
be considered if the level falls between .05% and .09%. "I decided the case has 
to proceed," Mecca said. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted at the April 19 hearing, Taylor could be fined and could lose 
driving privileges, Mecca said. Trooper Robert Pohida found Taylor about 3:30 
a.m. parked on the shoulder of the Garden State Parkway near Saddle Brook.

A strained muscle that shortstop Ozzie Smith suffered on his left side while 
stealing a base may keep him out of St. Louis' season opener, the Cardinals 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Whitey Herzog said a medical determination on Smith, 34, who was hurt 
Thursday during a game at Dunedin, Fla., against the Toronto Blue Jays, is 
expected within 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Smith is not the only St. Louis player hurt. Pitchers Danny Cox and Greg 
Mathews are disabled, and first baseman Pedro Guerrero has been idled a week by 
the strained tendons below his right knee he sustained March 24. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals open in New York against the Mets, defending National League East 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
"Spring training is just too long," Herzog said of the Cardinals' problems. "I 
don't see what it accomplishes, except guys keep (getting hurt)."

HARVEY'S CALM APPROACH WORKS IN RELIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first time Bryan Harvey, resident of Catawba, N.C., saw the Santa Ana 
Freeway at rush hour, he said, "I didn't know there was that many people in the 
world!" 
</P>
<P>
The first time Bryan Harvey, pitcher of baseballs, looked down from the mound 
at Jose Canseco, the Oakland Athletics slugger might just as well have been a 
35-year-old, good ol' boy truck driver with the name of the local feed store on 
his jersey. 
</P>
<P>
There's awe and then there's awe. 
</P>
<P>
You see, Harvey feels a lot more at home on a baseball diamond -- whether it's 
a sandlot in the North Carolina backwoods or a multimillion dollar showpiece in 
one of America's largest urban centers -- than he does on a crowded freeway . . 
. even though a gridlock pace is more his style. 
</P>
<P>
"Where I was raised, there's nothing like the fast pace of California," Harvey 
said. "There ain't no hurry back in the country 'cause there's nothin' goin' 
on." 
</P>
<P>
Except maybe a friendly little game of baseball. A friendly little game that 
can launch a guy into the big leagues, big money and big pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Harvey had no illusions about the big time when he agreed to pitch a 
game for Mooresville in a North Carolina semipro tournament five years ago. And 
he had no idea that word of his Bob Gibson imitation during that game was going 
to reach Angel scout Alex Cosmidas and result in a tryout. 
</P>
<P>
The way Cosmidas tells it, Harvey threw about 20 pitches at the radar gun 
during that tryout. All were at least 90 m.p.h., each faster than the one 
before, and all strikes. 
</P>
<P>
"That story gets bigger every time someone tells it or writes about it," Harvey 
said, smiling. "I threw about 20 pitches all right and most were probably over 
90. But no way were they all strikes." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey has a nasty little forkball to complement the heater now. And he does 
throw mostly strikes these days. 
</P>
<P>
But it's what hasn't changed about Bryan Harvey in the last five years that has 
made him what Angel Manager Doug Rader calls "probably the most important 
player on this club." 
</P>
<P>
"Bryan's a real hick and I don't mean that in a derogatory sense," Rader said. 
"He's the most down-to-earth guy I've ever met. Anybody who can stand to eat 
okra can't be too bad. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got the perfect makeup for a short-relief guy. Rollie Fingers was the 
same way. He didn't know where he was. And Bryan's got the stuff to back it 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Imperturbable? 
</P>
<P>
How about unconscious? 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody's going to have to notify Bryan to get excited when he makes the 
All-Star team," reliever Greg Minton said. "Laid back? If Bryan was the only 
guy you'd ever met from North Carolina, you'd wonder how anything ever got done 
in that state. But it's the perfect disposition for a reliever. 
</P>
<P>
"If the starters can go five or six good innings this season and then we do our 
job as set-up guys, we can wake up Bryan in the seventh to let him get ready to 
do his job, and he'll slam the door shut." 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in his life, Minton has resigned himself to a role as a 
set-up man because, for the first time in his life, he's on a team with a 
closer he admits is better-suited to shut that door. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was with the Giants, I didn't think anyone was better," he said. "And I 
didn't think (Angels DeWayne) Buice or (Donnie) Moore were better the last 
couple of years here. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time I'm going to be working set-up for a quality closer. 
And my goal this season is to make Bryan Harvey a rich man." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey, 25, says he isn't setting any specific goals -- monetary or otherwise 
-- but if you press him, he will admit that "30 (saves) is a nice round 
number." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he insists he's going to take it one batter at a time and not worry 
about the numbers game. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey sits in front of his locker stall and listens intently while his 
manager's latest testimony to his importance is read back to him: 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at how thin we are in short relief, then you know just how 
vitally important Bryan is to this team. When you look at the other people on 
this team who can fill that role, therein lies Bryan's value." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey shrugs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not goin' to go out puttin' any pressure on myself," he said. "I'll just 
give 'em 100% and hope the best comes out of it. Whatever happens, I'm going to 
live with it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm human. Inside, I may feel (pressure) more than I show it on the outside. 
But when you're up there on the hill, you better not be frettin' 'bout who's at 
the plate or how important the game is or you're already in trouble. You just 
gotta get the batter out." 
</P>
<P>
That, of course, is an area in which Harvey excelled last season. His 
earned-run average was 2.13 and opposing hitters managed just a .214 batting 
average. Opponents scored more than one earned run against him in just five of 
his 50 appearances. He came away with 17 saves and finished second in the 
rookie of the year voting to Oakland shortstop Walt Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
Is there anyway to go but down? 
</P>
<P>
Surely, Harvey has considered the possibility of a less-productive season in 
1989, but you can bet the tobacco farm he hasn't lost any sleep over it. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a good year last year, but I can't live on last year," he said. "I can 
use it as a confidence-builder and try to carry over that confidence, but I 
still have to go out and get 'em this time around." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey began the 1988 season in the minors and he ended it on the disabled 
list. He underwent arthroscopic surgery to remove two bone chips on Sept. 21. 
Now, he says his arm feels as good as it ever did . . . and one heck of a lot 
better than it did after the last day he pitched late last summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew something was going on in there," he said, pointing to his elbow. "A 
couple of mornings after I pitched, it completely locked up on me. I could 
still pitch, but after that Sunday, when I gave up that grand slam and we still 
won, I knew somethin' had to be done." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey's rehabilitation went right on schedule. He rested until Thanksgiving, 
threw a little and rested some more before coming to Anaheim to work out in 
January. This spring, the radar gun is again showing the kinds of numbers that 
would earn you a trip to the courthouse and a fat fine if a highway patrolman 
was aiming it at your sports car. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctors told me (the procedure) wasn't too complicated, but you always 
wonder in the back of your mind if you'll have the same pop after surgery. 
They've been tellin' me to take it a little easy this spring, but when I get on 
the mound, I give it all that day, spring training or not. And it feels pretty 
good so far." 
</P>
<P>
Rader hasn't been overjoyed with a lot of his pitching staff's performances 
this spring, but he certainly seems pleased with what he has seen from Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been trying to stay away from preconceived notions, but Bryan's lived up 
to all his press clippings so far," Rader said. "He could get 30 saves, or 
more, depending on how the pitching staff sets up. We'd like to be able to use 
him only in save situations. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got the fastball, the forkball and he throws strikes. Those are three 
great steps to being a great reliever." 
</P>
<P>
And don't forget the perfect disposition. 
</P>
<P>
Minton strikes a casual pose and lapses into his Harvey impersonation with as 
thick a drawl as he can muster: 
</P>
<P>
"Ah got two pitches, son, here comes one or the other and you ain't agonna hit 
neither one." 
</P>
<P>
Nice try, Greg, but could you add a little more deep South to that accent. 
</P>
<P>
"There ain't nobody here who talks like I do," Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
And there ain't nobody here who throws like he does, so everyone with a halo on 
his hat is hoping he stays healthy. Harvey, of course, insists his role isn't 
nearly all that vital. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no pressure on me," Harvey said. "I've got a job to do and if I don't 
do it, they'll get someone who will." 
</P>
<P>
Look around, Harv, big-time closers don't grow on trees -- the semipro sandlots 
seldom bear fruit of Harvey's quality -- and the Angel bullpen isn't 
overflowing with potential Hall of Famers. 
</P>
<P>
Rader and Co. are more than satisfied with their star right-hander's 
matter-of-fact approach, though. They're still afraid he might wake up and 
realize where he is.

<P>
I've seen lots of wondrous things. I've seen a dog lap milk from his master's 
mouth. I've seen the Grand Canyon. I've seen Donnie Moore pitch and Dave 
Henderson swing. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't until this spring that I saw the most unexpected sight of all: 
the revised and long overdue edition of Douglas Lee Rader, the Angels' third 
manager in three years. 
</P>
<P>
Dare we call it a metamorphosis, a miracle? Because if appearances are to be 
believed, Rader has gone from jerk to jewel, unwielding to understanding. 
</P>
<P>
In short, Dour Doug has become Dale Carnegie. 
</P>
<P>
We hope. 
</P>
<P>
Mind you, it's early. The Angels have yet to encounter one of their seasonal 
swoons, or been stricken by injuries to their starting rotation, or played host 
to the Oakland Athletics. But that will come and when it does, it will be 
interesting to watch the reaction of the former Mt. Vesuvius. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, Rader deserves the benefit of the doubt. He's earned it, don't you 
think? After all, the old Doug Rader used to be a candidate for distemper 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
The new Doug Rader whistles while he works. 
</P>
<P>
The old Doug Rader used to berate players on the pitcher's mound. 
</P>
<P>
The new Doug Rader hands out compliments as if they were roses from a bouquet. 
</P>
<P>
The old Doug Rader never turned the other cheek. 
</P>
<P>
The new Doug Rader is the picture of compromise. 
</P>
<P>
The old Doug Rader inflicted his managerial will on the 1983 Texas Rangers, 
wringing 77 victories and a third-place finish out of a mediocre team. 
</P>
<P>
The new Doug Rader says the price of each win was too high. "You end up 
exhausting everyone emotionally and physically. And you end up with too many 
adversarial relationships," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The old Doug Rader, by his own admission, was not fun to play for. 
</P>
<P>
The new Doug Rader vows he will be. 
</P>
<P>
The old Doug Rader never met a confrontation he didn't like. 
</P>
<P>
The new Doug Rader has met plenty of them. 
</P>
<P>
The old Doug Rader was upset and bitter about being fired as Ranger manager in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
The new Doug Rader says "I'd had died" if he would have been retained by Ranger 
management. "I was just digging myself so deep into a hole. I had to be fired. 
It was just becoming unbearable for everyone: me, the players. It was something 
that absolutely had to be done," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The old Doug Rader listened to too many people during his time with Texas. 
</P>
<P>
The new Doug Rader says he'll listen to his best instincts. 
</P>
<P>
The old Doug Rader thought he could transform a fledgling franchise into 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
The new Doug Rader is less Pollyannic. 
</P>
<P>
The old Doug Rader thought "every pitch, every out, every inning was supposed 
to be played absolutely full-out intense." 
</P>
<P>
The new Doug Rader says there are some ballgames "that you're just not going to 
win." 
</P>
<P>
The old Doug Rader was renown for his postgame temper tantrums. 
</P>
<P>
The new Doug Rader preaches patience, perseverance and optimism. "Keep an even 
keel," he says. "If you lose one, then you try to win the next two. But there 
are some situations where you have no chance of succeeding." 
</P>
<P>
The old Doug Rader used to march around the dugout trying to figure out ways to 
turn outs into Ranger hits, balls into strikes, losses into wins. 
</P>
<P>
The new Doug Rader says, "Gimme a break." 
</P>
<P>
The old Doug Rader was haunted by his past. 
</P>
<P>
The new Doug Rader says he has learned from it. 
</P>
<P>
The old Doug Rader would have snapped back had a question about his failings at 
Texas been asked. 
</P>
<P>
The new Doug Rader contends that his Ranger experience isn't ruled by the 
statute of limitations. "I'm a realist," he says. "I think that some form of 
penance lasts a little longer than others." 
</P>
<P>
The old Doug Rader led the league in scowls. 
</P>
<P>
The new Doug Rader led the Cactus League in jocularity. 
</P>
<P>
The old Doug Rader considered managing a chore, like cleaning out the rain 
gutters. 
</P>
<P>
The new Doug Rader considers managing "a joy. I appreciate it a lot more," he 
says.

<P>
The old Doug Rader could explode at any time. 
</P>
<P>
The new Doug Rader says he won't, though he doesn't blame people for being 
suspicious, even doubtful of his attitude. "I think it's reasonable for people 
to think that way," he says. "It's like everything else: you've got to 
demonstrate it, you just can't say it. I don't think those people are wrong for 
feeling that way." 
</P>
<P>
The old Doug Rader would have flipped if his star first baseman hurt himself 
playing basketball. 
</P>
<P>
The new Doug Rader rolled like Wally Joyner's ankle. 
</P>
<P>
The old Doug Rader used to like players who were feisty, hard-nosed, Rader 
clones. 
</P>
<P>
The new Doug Rader realizes that talent can come in all packages. 
</P>
<P>
The old Doug Rader distrusted anyone carrying a pen and a note pad. 
</P>
<P>
The new Doug Rader goes so far as to play peacemaker between an angry player 
and a newspaper reporter. 
</P>
<P>
The old Doug Rader could be a bully. 
</P>
<P>
The new Doug Rader tosses out souvenirs for little kids. 
</P>
<P>
The old Doug Rader didn't care if everyone thought his initials were S.O.B. 
</P>
<P>
The new Doug Rader says he has nothing against being liked. 
</P>
<P>
The old Doug Rader once wore a Rangers cap. 
</P>
<P>
The new Doug Rader wears an Angels cap, the one with the tiny halo above the 
letter A. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine that: Rader with a halo on his head. Wouldn't it be nice if it stayed

YOUTH MOVEMENT DETOURED IN FAVOR OF BEAT THE CLOCK

<P>
Over nachos and iced tea, at the Mexican restaurant where he announced his 
retirement last fall, ex-Angel Doug DeCinces also served some food for thought 
concerning the wobbly course being run by his former team. 
</P>
<P>
"They need to change their approach over there," DeCinces said. "They're not 
going to do it with the farm system alone. They're going to have to bring in 
some veterans." 
</P>
<P>
Hardly surprising stuff, coming from a recent casualty of the Angel youth 
movement. DeCinces was a 1987 victim, pushed out in favor of Jack Howell, just 
as Rod Carew had been forced out by Wally Joyner in 1986. DeCinces' peer group 
was Reggie Jackson, Bobby Grich, Don Sutton -- not Devon White, Mark McLemore 
and Bryan Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
A veteran veteran, DeCinces and his advice seemed best taken with a grain of 
margarita salt. The 1988 Angels might not have been very good, but at least 
they were young. 
</P>
<P>
And all young players need is time, right? 
</P>
<P>
Time's up. 
</P>
<P>
Between the final out of their 12th consecutive defeat and the opening workout 
of their spring camp in Mesa, Ariz., the Angels did their share of retooling. 
And most of the tools they acquired were of the vintage variety: 
</P>
<P>
Lance Parrish, 32-year-old catcher, came from Philadelphia in a trade for 
19-year-old pitcher David Holdridge. 
</P>
<P>
Bert Blyleven, 37-year-old pitcher, was imported from Minnesota for the price 
of three minor leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
Claudell Washington, 34-year-old outfielder, was signed to a free-agent 
contract worth $2.6 million over the next three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Bob McClure, 35-year-old pitcher, was brought in to replace 26-year-old Sherman 
Corbett as the left-handed bullpen specialist. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Schroeder, 30-year-old reserve catcher, was acquired from Milwaukee in 
exchange for 27-year-old utility infielder Gus Polidor. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Concepcion, 40, and Glenn Hoffman, 30, were signed as possible 
replacements for Polidor. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine DeCinces and Angel vice president Mike Port, after all this time, 
finally finding common ground. 
</P>
<P>
Stop the youth movement, the Angels want to get off. 
</P>
<P>
Port, of course, characterizes the club's change of course in less dramatic 
terms. The Anaheim youth revolution presses on, he insists. 
</P>
<P>
All that has been added, he says, is a touch of gray -- for that more 
distinguished look. 
</P>
<P>
"We still have Wally Joyner, Mark McLemore, Dick Schofield, Jack Howell and 
Devon White," Port points out, ticking off the names of the Angels' under-28 
brigade. 
</P>
<P>
"Chili Davis is just reaching the 30 mark. Our pitchers -- Mike Witt, Kirk 
McCaskill, Dan Petry, Bryan Harvey -- are still reasonably young fellows. 
</P>
<P>
"I would venture to say there's still a strong youth element to this club." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, after back-to-back 75-87 finishes in 1987 and 1988, the need for 
experienced leadership, for additional seasoning, was glaringly obvious. All 
those new faces didn't look so fresh after that club-record, season-ending 
losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels had gone from too old to too young too quickly, it was argued. This 
was a ship that needed a rudder. 
</P>
<P>
So Blyleven and his 254 career victories were brought in to impart some winning 
wisdom on the Angel pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, who served as Rickey Henderson's personal guidance counselor with 
the New York Yankees, would be the good influence in the Angel clubhouse George 
Hendrick failed to be. 
</P>
<P>
Concepcion, a relic from the Big Red Machine dynasty days, was invited to camp 
in hope of (a) losing some weight, (b) making the team, and (c) lending a 
knowing hand to the young Angel infield. 
</P>
<P>
Parrish? Well, he knew how to win. In 1984, he led Detroit to a World Series 
championship. And at 32, he wasn't too old. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Parrish is nine years younger than the man he succeeds, Bob Boone. 
</P>
<P>
See, the youth movement lives. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Downing, the Angels' 38-year-old designated hitter, was gladdened no end 
by these new old arrivals -- and not just for the company. 
</P>
<P>
"We brought in a lot of experience, major league veterans who can fill some 
roles," Downing said. "That's going to help. These people have played for 
winners -- and we need all the winning experience we can get." 
</P>
<P>
In reserve roles, as well as starting roles, Downing said. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at Oakland last year," he said. "The one thing Oakland did was go out and 
get some veteran backup players. David Henderson, who came in and really 
helped. Ron Hassey. Glenn Hubbard at second base. Don Baylor, Dave Parker. Some 
guys in their pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
"Most teams give those jobs to some player making the minimum salary, a 
23-year-old kid. At least we went out and paid some money for some people who 
have been through it before. That's an encouraging sign." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, whenever experienced hands are brought in, baggage comes attached. 
Some of it, in the case of the Angels' old newcomers, would be better off lost 
in transit. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven, for instance, turns 38 next week. The Angels can only hope that 
wasn't preceded by a turn for the worse. Blyleven became available this winter, 
mainly because of his summer: 10-17 record, 5.43 earned-run average, thumb 
injury, contract dispute and repeated shellings under the Metrodome. 
</P>
<P>
With Parrish, the hope is that he brings the Angels a big bat. The fear is that 
he brings them a bad back. Plagued by back ailments the last two seasons in 
Philadelphia, Parrish plagued the Phillies with back-to-back batting averages 
of .245 and .215. 
</P>
<P>
This from the same catcher who hit 28 home runs with 98 runs batted in for 
Detroit as recently as 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, once nicknamed Pajamas in Chicago, as in Washington Slept Here, 
only recently revived a career that appeared doomed to the Unfulfilled 
Potential file. The ex-Athletic, ex-Ranger, ex-White Sox, ex-Met, ex-Brave, 
ex-Yankee is well-traveled for good reason, but last year in New York, he 
staged a resuscitation: .308 average, 11 home runs, 64 RBIs, 22 doubles, 15 
steals. 
</P>
<P>
An omen for the Angels . . . or a stray blip on the radar screen? 
</P>
<P>
You can flip a coin with Schroeder (14 homers in 1987, .156 in 1988) and 
McClure (3.44 ERA in 1987, 5.40 in 1988). But with Concepcion, you might want 
to flip him a muffler and point him to the easy chair. The once-great shortstop 
batted a humbling .198 last year, was cut by Cincinnati and invited as a 
non-roster candidate to the Angels' spring camp. There, Concepcion entered the 
final weekend at Palm Springs batting .125. 
</P>
<P>
There, Concepcion figured to lose the utility infielder assignment to Hoffman, 
who was batting .360. 
</P>
<P>
If new Angel Manager Doug Rader might be allowed a little wishful, but 
realistic, thinking, he would gladly settle for 200 innings and 12 wins from 
Blyleven; 120 games and 20 home runs from Parrish; .280 and decent outfield 
play from Washington; a few pinch-hits from Schroeder and a few left-handed 
outs from McClure. 
</P>
<P>
That would provide a worthwhile complement to the Angels' young 
Joyner-White-Schofield-Howell-Harvey nucleus. It would also help buy the Angels 
some time while prospects Dante Bichette and Jim Abbott commence final 
big-league preparations. 
</P>
<P>
In a division dominated by the green of the Oakland A's, the Angels have turned 
a shade gray. But is it a sane gray? Is older necessarily wiser . . . or just 
one more roll of the dice by the unluckiest baseball team in existence? 
</P>
<P>
Rader, 44, isn't expecting miracles. Oakland and Minnesota appear clearly 
beyond the Angels' class -- and Kansas City and Texas could also be out of 
reach. Rader is only asking the veterans to provide some improvement, to bid 
for .500, to take a step in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
He only wants to trust in someone over 30.

lot more hitting than sitting this season and can regain his 1985 form, when he 
had 28 homers and 98 RBIs for Detroit. ; Photo, COLOR, Bert Blyleven brings 19 
seasons and 254 career victories worth of experience to the pitching staff. ;

BRINGING THEM UP FROM THE FARMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In such obscure baseball ports of call as Midland, Tex.; Edmonton, Canada; 
Davenport, Iowa; Bend, Ore.; and even Palm Springs, toil Angels of the future. 
The hard part is figuring out who will make it and who won't. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Bavasi doesn't even try. Bavasi, the Angels' director of minor league 
operations, likes to think every player in the organization, from rookie league 
to triple-A, has a chance to join the Angel 24-man roster one day. That's why 
The Times submitted to Bavasi a list of minor league players who are likely to 
contribute -- some as soon as this season -- to Angel fortunes. Comment away, 
we asked. 
</P>
<P>
So he did. His thoughts on . . . 
</P>
<P>
JOHN ORTON -- C 
</P>
<P>
Orton hit .200 at Palm Springs in '88. 
</P>
<P>
"He is as good a catch-and-throw guy as we have had or have right now (in the 
organization), from the major leagues down. But he has a lot of work to do at 
the plate. 
</P>
<P>
"He had (bone) chips removed from his elbow, so we brought him along slowly 
last year. That's been eight months removed, though; he's feeling fine now. I 
think he's probably throwing 100% now. This kid can really catch and throw. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen Bryan Harvey when he pitched in the Instructional League. With men 
on base, there probably couldn't have been anybody who could have caught (his 
pitches) except Orton. 
</P>
<P>
"The only question when he was drafted was the bat. If he hit .230 anywhere, he 
would hit 25, 30 homers -- he's got that kind of bat speed. But I think he's 
going to hit better than (.230). In the Instructional League, he was making 
contact, using all the fields . . . he was driving the ball. I think he's going 
to be a complete player." 
</P>
<P>
MIKE FETTERS -- P 
</P>
<P>
Fetters was 8-8 with Midland, 2-0 with Edmonton in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"He's right there, too. He's just a physical guy. He's a physical pitcher. He's 
learning how to pitch, how to go from a thrower to a pitcher. He has a chance 
to be a physical, dominating guy. 
</P>
<P>
"He was sick last year with a staph infection, so he missed a month and a half. 
Before he got sick, he would have gone to Edmonton (the Angel triple-A team). 
He would have punched out some lights there and been called up to the big 
leagues in September, I think. 
</P>
<P>
"Each time he went out, he got stronger. By the end of (winter ball), he was 
one of the top two pitchers in the league. 
</P>
<P>
"He's (projected as) a starter, definitely." 
</P>
<P>
COLIN CHARLAND -- P 
</P>
<P>
Charland was 17-5 with Palm Springs in '88. 
</P>
<P>
"He learned a lot in winter ball. He went down there with Fetters. 
</P>
<P>
"He pitched so well in Palm Springs (in 1988). (Our people) said that this guy 
was the mule that Palm Springs rode to the playoffs. He was the stopper. 
</P>
<P>
"We took him to the Dominican, but we were real careful about the innings he 
pitched. We were concerned about fatigue. (Charland pitched 204 innings at Palm 
Springs). 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping we can bypass double-A and go to triple-A with him." 
</P>
<P>
JEFF MANTO -- 3B 
</P>
<P>
Manto hit .301, had 24 homers and 101 RBIs at Midland in '88. 
</P>
<P>
"Manto is going to be a tough call for a lot of people because he had Midland 
numbers. (Midland, the Angel double-A affiliate, is known for high batting 
averages and earned run averages because of stiff winds that blow constantly 
toward left field.) He took advantage of that. But not all of his home runs and 
RBIs were gotten in Midland. I think he had a pretty good spread. I also think 
he's going to hit in triple-A and the big leagues, if he gets there." 
</P>
<P>
JIM McCOLLOM -- 1B 
</P>
<P>
McCollom hit .343, 20 homers and drove in 75 runs at Midland in '88. 
</P>
<P>
"His hitting style doesn't take advantage of wind anywhere. It doesn't take 
advantage of short grass anywhere. If he hits a home run, it's gone. He's a 
line-drive type of hitter. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got to work on his defense. He has to learn how to play first base and 
left field. But I've seen him do a fine job at first base." 
</P>
<P>
LEE STEVENS -- 1B/OF 
</P>
<P>
Stevens hit .297, had 23 homers and 76 RBIs at Midland in '88. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a chance to be an impact player. He's a real strong hitter from the 
left side. Quite simply, he's a home run and RBI guy, one of the better ones. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got some defensive work to do. He'd probably show a better arm from right 
field, because of the angle -- he's left-handed. He'll do an excellent job for 
you at first base, but we already have a pretty good left-handed first baseman 
(Wally Joyner). He likes playing the outfield. I truly believe he's got a 
chance."

LEISURE WORLD BEGINS YOUTH MOVEMENT AS AVERAGE AGE INCREASES

Herbert and Florence Friedman weren't sure of the response they would receive 
when they started a group called the Nifty Fifties at Leisure World, in Laguna 
Hills, early last year. 
</P>
<P>
In a community where the average age is 76 and an estimated 17 residents are 
over 100, the Friedmans and some of their peers believed that the younger set 
needed a group of its own to arrange social activities, such as dances and 
dinners. 
</P>
<P>
Today the group, officially called the Nifty Fifties and Sixties, has more than 
200 members. 
</P>
<P>
Its emergence is just one sign that the retirement community is feeling its age 
as it approaches its 25th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
With the average age of the 21,000 residents climbing steadily, Professional 
Community Management Inc., the property management firm that oversees 
day-to-day operations, has formed a committee to help attract younger 
residents. The New Resident Recruitment Committee, made up of residents, was 
organized early in 1988, not long after about 300 residents moved into nearby, 
full-care facilities that offer medical care not available at Leisure World. 
Vacancies are now back to normal (about 150 of the 12,736 units at any given 
time), but the committee is still recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to see the average age come down a bit if possible," said Recreation 
Director Debby Lamb, who has been part of Leisure World's management team for 
15 years. "Or at least not go up any more. That would be fine, and we think 
it's realistic. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been contacting large companies in Los Angeles and Orange counties -- 
those with pre-retirement programs -- and asking them to let those who might be 
thinking of retiring to consider us." 
</P>
<P>
Lamb said residents have been asked to tell friends about Leisure World, and 
the committee prepared an information sheet for them to enclose with letters or 
greeting cards. 
</P>
<P>
"Our residents are our best salespeople," Lamb said. "The non-residents see how 
pleased our residents are, and they ask us for more information." 
</P>
<P>
Although the committee is looking for younger residents, the minimum age 
restriction is strict and unyielding. One spouse must be at least 55. (Lamb 
said the number of spouses under 45 "could be counted on one hand.") 
</P>
<P>
It would be easy to assume, given the range of ages, that there are vast 
differences in interests and needs among Leisure World's residents. But 
apparently the generation gap is hardly noticeable. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 90-year-olds who do everything the 60-year-olds do," Lamb said. "You 
go to the exercise rooms, and I challenge you to tell me how old the person 
using the facilities might be -- 70, 80 or 90. Of course, whatever the activity 
is, they (the 90-year-olds) might not do it as fast." 
</P>
<P>
The stereotype, that younger residents want to play tennis or golf while those 
in their 80s or older are preoccupied with health services or more sedentary 
sports, is simply not true. 
</P>
<P>
For example, one of the largest recreation groups at Leisure World is the 
650-member Saddle Club, which has members of all ages. Retired dentist Earl 
Donaldson noticed two years ago when he headed the Saddle Club that many 
members were in their 80s. 
</P>
<P>
"Some might be pretty close to 90," said Donaldson, who is 71. "Just last year, 
we put up a plaque honoring those who are over 80. We call them the Over-80s 
Riders, and there are 28 listed on the plaque. I doubt if there's any other 
place in the country with that many riders in that age group." 
</P>
<P>
Donaldson said his background is similar to that of many riders in the group. 
He rode as a young man in Colorado, then "did very little riding for about 40 
years," and finally got back into it at Leisure World. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are more than 200 clubs and organizations at Leisure World, the 
transition from the "outside world" to life behind its protective walls isn't 
always easy. 
</P>
<P>
"The first year here, I thought I would lose my mind," said Ilene Snyder, 54, 
co-president of the Nifty Fifties who has lived in Leisure World for two years 
with her husband, Irwin, 60. "It seemed foreign because of so many older 
people. Now I wouldn't live anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Ilene Snyder changed her view of Leisure World as she became more involved in 
social activities. They also were a big attraction for Myra Stockman, 69, 
co-president of the Nifty Fifties. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can't find any friends among more than 21,000 people, there's something 
wrong with you," said Stockman, who moved to Leisure World 19 months ago with 
her husband, Sam, 65. "We might be in our 50s and 60s, but we still have 
teen-age minds." 
</P>
<P>
Generally, older residents accept younger arrivals and like to help them get 
involved in the community. Sometimes, however, minor tensions arise. 
</P>
<P>
Although Nifty Fifties members say they have encountered no serious resentment 
from older residents, a few tell of some awkward moments. For example, Roberta 
Elliott, 55, recalled that when she attended a program with her husband, 
Marvin, 57, not long after moving in, "a woman turned around, stared at me and 
said, 'What are you two doing here? You don't belong here.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ilene Snyder says she regards such comments favorably. "I've heard that kind of 
thing," she said. "Someone says, 'You're too young. Why are you here?' I don't 
mind. In a way, they're telling me I still look young." 
</P>
<P>
From time to time, older residents have gone before the Golden Rain Foundation, 
a governing board that sets policies for the community, asking for more 
facilities for those who are not able to take care of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation, whose members are all residents, has always voted against such 
proposals -- including one that would have set aside part of the Towers complex 
as a full-care center. 
</P>
<P>
"It underscores the fact that the majority wants Leisure World to remain an 
active senior community," Lamb said. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, those who require assistance are allowed to have nurses, 
housekeepers, therapists or other aides come in, or even live with them, as 
their needs dictate. The practice is not discouraged, nor even monitored, Lamb 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It wouldn't be a significant number," she explained. "Sometimes someone might 
need assistance for a time while recuperating from an illness or injury. They 
don't have to clear anything with us." 
</P>
<P>
Those who do need more assistance -- and can afford it -- live in the Towers 
complex, which includes two high-rise condominiums. There the average age is 
86. Residents of the 311 Towers units are provided meals three times a day, 
regular housekeeping service and a nurse on call 24 hours a day. Monthly fees 
range from $1,000 to $1,300, depending on the size of the unit. Nonetheless, 
Leisure World is anything but a convalescent home, as prospective buyers are 
warned in a written "advisory health statement." 
</P>
<P>
"You should be active and be able to care for yourself," the one-page flyer 
states. "We do not provide facilities or services to care for the physical, 
medical, mental or emotional health-care needs of residents." 
</P>
<P>
New residents quickly find they may have little time for the "leisure" in 
Leisure World because they are faced, upon moving in, with so many activities. 
</P>
<P>
"We want people to know right away that they might find themselves more active 
than they had planned," Lamb said. "We point out that our concept here is, and 
always has been, active senior living."
