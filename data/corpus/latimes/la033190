MEASLES CASES RISE SHARPLY IN S.D. COUNTY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The measles epidemic in San Diego County has worsened dramatically recently, 
leading public health officials to believe that more cases will be reported 
during the first three months of 1990 than in all of 1982, when the previous 
record for reported cases was set. 
</P>
<P>
Since early January, 49 confirmed cases of measles and 418 probable cases -- 
most of which will eventually be confirmed -- were reported in the county, 
officials said. San Diego reported 191 measles cases during 1989 and 451 during 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
The epidemic that began sweeping through Southern California in late 1987 has 
hit hardest in Los Angeles County and the Inland Empire, where health officials 
have already reported many more cases during the first three months of 1990 
than in all of 1989. Dramatic increases in measles cases have also been 
registered throughout the Central Valley, and an outbreak has developed in 
Alameda County in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
"Children are getting ill, going to the hospital and dying," said Dr. Loring 
Dales, chief of the immunization unit for the state Department of Health 
Services in Berkeley. "We are really stunned by not only the amount of illness 
but also the severity. . . . (It is) the kind of thing you would see in 
Calcutta." 
</P>
<P>
The majority of the current cases are occurring in preschool-age children who 
have never been immunized against measles. Health officials speculate that 
these toddlers may be especially vulnerable to the disease. Previous epidemics 
have largely affected school-age children or young adults. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of San Diego County's confirmed and probable cases during the 
past three months have involved preschoolers. 
</P>
<P>
"That's an age group of kids who should be immunized at 15 months," said Sandy 
Ross, immunization project coordinator for the county Department of Health 
Services. "But many of the kids in this outbreak were eligible for vaccinations 
they have not gotten." 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, between a quarter and a third of measles victims have required 
hospitalization, primarily for pneumonia or dehydration. About one in 200 of 
the afflicted have died, contrasted with the historical pattern in the United 
States of one death for every 1,000 to 3,000 cases. 
</P>
<P>
While local hospitalization figures are not yet available, "one out of every 
four people with measles was hospitalized during 1989," Ross said. "That's a 
lot of people who were ill enough to require hospitalization." 
</P>
<P>
"We feel like we're under siege," said Dr. Gary Euler, chief of immunization 
programs in San Bernardino County, where health officials have documented 910 
cases and five deaths so far this year, contrasted with 650 cases and five 
deaths during 1989. Officials there believe the county's rate of new cases is 
the highest in the state and possibly the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Measles cases this month "have been coming in so fast you can't keep the log 
up," said Orange County epidemiologist Thomas J. Prendergast. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego has yet to record its first measles-related death during the current 
outbreak. However, local hospitals have reported several serious cases, 
including one death that might eventually be linked to measles. 
</P>
<P>
Hector Lopez, a 10-year-old fourth-grader at Sunset View Elementary School in 
Point Loma, died Feb. 23, several days after being hospitalized. The county 
coroner's office has yet to determine if he died of measles, but the disease 
has been diagnosed in other members of the boy's family. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors at Children's Hospital are now caring for a 1-year-old who was admitted 
to the hospital 68 days ago after being found to have measles. The prognosis is 
"not good" for the infant, who is on life-support systems, hospital spokesman 
Mark Morelli said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
As of Thursday, 1,407 measles cases and six measles deaths had been reported to 
Los Angeles County health officials, contrasted with 1,202 cases and 17 deaths 
in 1989. The incomplete March case total of 661 is already the highest monthly 
report of cases in 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Shirley L. Fannin of the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services 
said the epidemic there "clearly exceeds" the last major epidemic, in 1976 and 
1977. "We are really into a major surge. . . . It is hop, skipping and jumping 
from population to population and infecting the susceptibles," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, reported cases are "running way ahead" of 1989, when 3,048 measles 
cases were reported, said Dales of the state's immunization unit in Berkeley. 
If trends continue, he said, it is possible that the 1990 case total will 
surpass the 9,000 cases reported in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Previous epidemics have largely affected school-age children or young adults. 
But the majority of the current cases are occurring in preschool-age children 
who have never been immunized against measles, according to Fannin. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly hard-hit are Latino, Asian and Pacific Islands ethnic minorities, 
and children of all racial and ethnic groups in low-income communities. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors are also treating an unknown number of measles victims at hospital 
emergency rooms, said Ross of the San Diego County health department. "A lot of 
people go to emergency rooms just to be diagnosed. Others are sick enough to 
need (intravenous) fluids to rehydrate them so they don't have to be 
hospitalized." 
</P>
<P>
Some measles victims who go to hospitals are unwittingly helping spread the 
disease, especially in emergency rooms, where sick people often face long waits 
before receiving care. "The longer the infectious person is there, the greater 
the opportunity to spread it to other people," Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
Some San Diego County hospitals evidently have posted signs at emergency room 
entrances, warning infected people not to mingle with others who are seeking 
treatment, Ross said. UC San Diego Medical Center has posted warning signs at 
doors leading to wards that house highly susceptible patients such as pregnant 
women and infants. 
</P>
<P>
And emergency room nurses are now advising parents to leave their other 
children at home when they bring an injured or ill child in for treatment. 
"That's difficult to do, but when they bring the 10-year-old in for treatment 
of a soccer injury, they might expose their small baby who's not yet eligible 
for a vaccination," Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Dr. Kenneth W. Kizer, the state health director, told the Assembly 
Health Committee that $8.8 million more is needed this year to combat the 
epidemic, including funds for more immunization clinics, programs and vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County is planning evening hours for some public health clinics and 
is seeking assistance from the U. S. Centers for Disease Control. 
</P>
<P>
Other counties are planning to extend hours of existing clinics or are 
organizing special outreach clinics in shopping centers, churches, large 
apartment complexes and community centers. Educational messages about the 
epidemic and the importance of immunization are being sent out in various 
languages with welfare checks and Medi-Cal mailings. 
</P>
<P>
Measles, or rubeola, is a highly contagious viral disease that causes high 
fevers and a severe rash. It is spread by direct contact with the respiratory 
secretions of infected individuals. Measles most commonly occurs in the winter 
and spring, but, during epidemics, a substantial number of cases occur 
throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
To prevent the disease, a first dose of vaccine is recommended for all children 
between 12 and 15 months old, and a second dose at 4 to 6 years. But the 
vaccine is not foolproof; between 5% and 10% of recipients fail to achieve 
immunity after one dose of the vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
More than 90% of school-age children have been immunized against measles, 
primarily because of intensive public health efforts over the past 15 years. 
Such immunization is required as a condition of attending both public and 
private schools as well as state-licensed day-care centers. 
</P>
<P>
But surveys around the state show that only about 70% of all children -- and 
only 50% of many ethnic minorities -- have been immunized against measles by 
their second birthday, according to Dales. He estimated that a minimum of 
375,000 California children between ages 1 and 4 have not been immunized 
against measles. Until these children are immunized, they remain at high risk 
of contracting the disease if they are exposed to infected individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Measles immunization is given as part of a vaccine against measles, mumps and 
rubella, or "German measles." A dose of the vaccine costs about $27, but is 
generally available without charge to parents at public health clinics. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego County health department has historically provided vaccines for 
needy children at 15 months of age. But, because of federal budget cuts, "we 
don't even know if we'll have vaccines available in September, when the 
anticipated supply will run out," Ross said. "We're really in limbo right now." 
</P>
<P>
Also, the county does not have vaccine available for the second shot that is 
being recommended by the Centers for Disease Control.

DE LUZ FIGHTS ANNEXATION BID BY FIRE DISTRICT; 
</P>
<P>
FEES: THE TINY COMMUNITY NORTH OF FALLBROOK DOESN'T SEE A NEED FOR THE SERVICE, 
OR A $180 ANNUAL PAYMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of De Luz, a community north of Fallbrook, are fighting an annexation 
bid by the North County Fire Protection District, which claims the area has 
received free protection for 15 years and should now help pay for the service. 
</P>
<P>
Annexation would force De Luz's 300 or so residents to pay $180 a year each. 
Residents say they fear they would not have control over the use of the fees. 
</P>
<P>
The issue will be decided in a June 19 special election; if the annexation 
proposal fails to gain the necessary two-thirds vote, De Luz may be cut off by 
the fire district completely. 
</P>
<P>
Residents say they don't need the district's help, since it is too far removed 
to do any good and because the California Department of Forestry provides all 
the fire protection the area needs. 
</P>
<P>
"The district is going to annex us and not be able to do anything for us," 
resident Ron Wyman said. "All that we're being annexed for is a source of 
money, to get a larger tax base and enlarge their district." 
</P>
<P>
"They have no plans to put any equipment out here, and they can't service us," 
Wyman said. "They claim that they've been providing free service for us, but 
they haven't been out here. There have only been two fires out here in the last 
10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Fire Chief Andrew Vanderlaan said annexation would provide 24-hour, year-round 
fire and emergency protection, including paramedic and ambulance service. The 
CDF operates eight months out of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Wright, whose house and wholesale nursery business burned to the ground in 
1985, also opposes the annexation. She believes the community would lose 
control over its fire protection. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a Boston tea party," she said. "We are going to be taxed on 
something that we will have no improvements on, and we will have no say-so on 
what happens to the money." 
</P>
<P>
But Vanderlaan said that, once De Luz became part of the district, residents 
would be eligible to be elected to the district's controlling board when 
at-large elections are held in November. 
</P>
<P>
Wright and Wyman would like to eliminate the fire district and have De Luz deal 
with the CDF directly, partly because they feel the CDF would charge a smaller 
fee. 
</P>
<P>
For that to occur, De Luz would have to form a fire district itself, something 
the Local Agency Formation Commission, a state agency, has prohibited because 
De Luz falls under the North County Fire Protection District's sphere of 
influence. 
</P>
<P>
"We really discourage the formation of districts within districts that will be 
providing the same types of services," said Mike Ott of the agency. "LAFCO's 
whole mandate is to discourage the proliferation of districts in counties, and 
here it would be potentially duplicative." 
</P>
<P>
Ott said the North County Fire Protection District is the most logical agency 
to provide fire services to De Luz. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Fallbrook, Rainbow and Bonsall, which already fall under the North 
County Fire Protection District, do not pay the $180 annual fee because they 
were part of the district before Proposition 13 was enacted in 1978. The fire 
district relies mainly on property taxes to operate. 
</P>
<P>
Had Proposition 13 not been enacted, De Luz could be annexed and money from 
property taxes apportioned to cover fire protection. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderlaan said that, if the annexation attempt fails, he will recommend to the 
controlling board that service to De Luz be discontinued.

HUNTER WHISKED TO NORTHERN CALIFORNIA PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Convicted tax evader Nancy Hoover Hunter was moved suddenly Friday from a 
downtown San Diego jail to a federal prison in Northern California, a transfer 
that caught even her defense attorneys by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Brewer, Hunter's San Diego defense lawyer, said he was "furious" when he 
learned that Hunter had been transferred Friday morning from the Metropolitan 
Correctional Center in downtown San Diego to a federal prison in Pleasanton, 
Calif., about 35 miles east of San Franciso. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, convicted last December of four counts of tax evasion linked to the 
collapse of the J. David &amp; Co. investment house, is scheduled to go to 
trial again May 1 on 192 other counts on which her first jury deadlocked. Those 
remaining counts deal primarily with fraud and conspiracy charges stemming from 
her role at the failed La Jolla firm. 
</P>
<P>
The transfer out of San Diego was unexpected, Brewer said, because "we were in 
the process of preparing for her next case. We will take all steps necessary to 
get her back as soon as possible so we can prepare." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a jail facility for people who have active cases in the federal court 
in (San Diego)," said Joseph O. Barda, executive assistant to the MCC warden. 
"She no longer has an active case. Her trial is over." 
</P>
<P>
Although Hunter's second trial is to begin in four weeks, Barda said she was 
moved because MCC is crowded. "When you're a jail facility, every bed counts, 
and we're well over capacity here," he said. "So if there isn't an active case, 
bed space is precious to us." 
</P>
<P>
MCC, which has an official capacity of 546 prisoners, held 828 people Friday, 
Barda said. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,500 investors lost about $80 million in the J. David fraud, a Ponzi 
scheme in which money from new investors was used to pay off old investors and 
little actual trading of stocks or money market funds was done. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that Hunter played a key role in the scheme, creating false 
documents to lure investors to J. David and to lull them into maintaining their 
accounts while the firm slid toward bankruptcy in February, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
After an eight-month trial, a jury convicted Hunter Dec. 11 of the four tax 
counts, finding that she evaded about $1 million in taxes from 1980 through 
1983. The jury deadlocked, 11-1, for conviction on the 192 fraud and conspiracy 
counts and acquitted her of one other tax charge. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam sentenced Hunter to 10 
years in prison on the four tax counts. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter's ex-lover, firm founder J. David (Jerry) Dominelli, pleaded guilty in 
1985 to fraud and tax evasion in connection with the Ponzi scheme. He is 
serving a 20-year sentence at the same federal prison in Pleasanton to which 
Hunter was transferred Friday.

UCSD NAMES FIRST DEAN OF ARCHITECTURE SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Adele Naude Santos, a practicing Philadelphia architect and a professor at the 
University of Pennsylvania, has been selected as the first dean of the new UC 
San Diego School of Architecture, it was confirmed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Acting UCSD Chancellor Harold Ticho said university officials have reached 
agreement with Santos and will submit her name to the UC Board of Regents for 
approval at its May meeting. No problems are expected, Ticho said. 
</P>
<P>
Santos will work for the next two years toward the planned opening of the 
school in the fall of 1992. The school, approved by regents in September, 1988, 
will be the third in the UC system, along with existing schools at UC Berkeley 
and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Tentative plans call for eventual enrollment of 100 students in the master's 
program, about 10 in the doctoral program, and about 200 in the undergraduate 
program leading to a bachelor of arts degree, with a specialization in 
architecture. 
</P>
<P>
Santos, who is now in Japan, will receive a professorial appointment and begin 
recruiting a faculty later this year, Ticho said. He hopes at least three 
architecture professors will be on board by this time next year, with the full 
staff of 20 expected by the mid-1990s. Faculty members will work with Santos in 
establishing the curriculum, which will then be submitted to the UCSD Academic 
Senate for approval, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I would expect that the school will be doing outreach with the community ahead 
of the opening," Ticho said Friday. "It's important that there be good contact 
with the architectural community, to have some interaction." 
</P>
<P>
Ticho expects the school to place a strong emphasis on design, given Santos' 
background. In addition to training architects for the San Diego region, the 
school seeks to influence design and environmental planning through seminars 
and other activities. 
</P>
<P>
Santos is known for her academic work -- at Harvard University, Rice 
University, the University of Cincinnati, as well as Pennsylvania -- for 
innovative designs, especially of affordable, inner-city housing.

FRAUD INQUIRY TARGET WINS A ROUND IN COURT; 
</P>
<P>
INSURANCE: THE GOVERNMENT AGREES NOT TO FORCE THE SEIZURE OF $2.8 MILLION FROM 
AN ATTORNEY SUSPECTED OF PARTICIPATING IN THE ALLIANCE CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Attorney Lynn B. Stites, the focus of a criminal investigation in the 
"Alliance" insurance fraud case, has won a skirmish in his battle with the 
federal government, which bungled an attempt to seize $2.8 million it says 
Stites owes in unpaid taxes, according to papers filed in federal court in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In a notice filed Friday, government lawyers conceded defeat, saying they would 
not defend an extraordinary move by the Internal Revenue Service to seize bank 
accounts, real estate and other assets belonging to Stites and his former wife, 
Erma Stites. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS action -- known as a jeopardy assessment, and most often used to tax 
cash seized in drug raids -- was taken last November. Attorneys for the 
Stiteses moved to void it on legal grounds. A hearing scheduled for Friday on 
the dispute was called off when the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles said 
the government "agrees that the . . . jeopardy assessment should be abated." 
</P>
<P>
Stites could not be reached for comment and his attorneys would not discuss his 
whereabouts. But one of them, Thomas A. Mesereau Jr., called the decision an 
"emotional lift" for the embattled Stites, who has been described in nationwide 
media coverage as the alleged mastermind of an insurance scam involving a ring 
of Los Angeles-area lawyers that prosecutors have called the "Alliance." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers in the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles could not be reached, and 
an IRS spokeswoman declined comment on the case. An IRS official admitted that 
the agency has obtained little of value from the Stiteses. "Let's just say it 
was insignificant," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Court papers and other records show the government botched the effort to tie up 
Stites' assets, allowing him to withdraw at least $2 million of a legal 
settlement from a bank, and to sell his former home in Bell Canyon in eastern 
Ventura County for more than $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
In October, Stites settled bitter litigation with former client Leonard M. Ross 
for a total of $3.8 million. Stites got $2.3 million of the insurance-funded 
settlement, and Ross $1.5 million. In late October, Stites withdrew at least $2 
million of the money from a bank in Beverly Hills, including more than $1 
million in $100 bills that was stuffed in a flight bag, according to a 
knowledgeable source who would not speak if identified. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS then tried to seize Stites' share of the settlement, but showed up 
nearly a month too late. 
</P>
<P>
In a sworn declaration filed in court this week, Stites attorney Mesereau said 
IRS official Sharon Lavenberg served a notice of the levy at his Century City 
law office on Nov. 15. Mesereau said Lavenberg told him an informant monitoring 
the Ross-Stites case was to tip off authorities when the settlement was 
imminent, but that the plan got "screwed up." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities "were very distressed that they had not received immediate word of 
the settlement," Mesereau said Lavenberg told him. 
</P>
<P>
Lavenberg could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Stiteses sold their Bell Canyon home for about $544,000 on Nov. 22, seven 
days after the jeopardy assessment, according to records at the Ventura County 
clerk and recorder's office. 
</P>
<P>
Records show that the IRS prepared a notice of lien on the home on Nov. 16, but 
did not record the lien until Nov. 28. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS can make a jeopardy assessment if it decides it is in jeopardy of 
losing taxes owed because assets may be hidden or dissipated. 
</P>
<P>
The Stiteses' lawyers attacked the assessment as illegal and as an attempt to 
deprive Stites of funds for an effective defense against criminal charges that 
may be filed against him and as many as 15 to 20 others in the Alliance case. 
</P>
<P>
George D. Hardy, the assistant U.S. attorney in San Diego heading up the 
Alliance investigation, said depriving Stites of money to defend himself was 
"absolutely not a strategy" in the jeopardy assessment. 
</P>
<P>
Despite voiding the jeopardy assessment, the IRS still can take Stites to court 
over the $2.8 million it claims he owes in unpaid taxes for 1987. 
</P>
<P>
According to court papers, the claim is based on allegations that another 
lawyer in the insurance fraud ring paid Stites $5 million in 1987 that he did 
not declare as income. This was dismissed as a "foolish . . . theory" by 
lawyers for Stites. 
</P>
<P>
Stites and other alleged Alliance lawyers took part in cases in Los Angeles, 
Orange and San Diego counties in which insurance companies paid legal fees for 
numerous defendants. The ring is accused by insurance companies and federal 
authorities of conspiring to prolong and expand the cases to increase each 
attorney's workload and subsequent billings to insurers. 
</P>
<P>
Four lawyers, two law firm employees and one client have pleaded guilty to mail 
fraud in the case, and two other attorneys have been indicted on charges of 
lying to the federal grand jury investigating the case. 
</P>
<P>
About 15 to 20 other lawyers, law firm employees and associates recently 
received letters from the U.S. attorney in San Diego, informing them that they 
may be indicted on racketeering charges.

STUDENT LIVES 3 MONTHS IN HIDEAWAY AT HIGH SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
An 18-year-old high school student lived for the past three months in a secret 
apartment above his school's auditorium in Sun Valley, building a carpeted home 
with a bed, TV, VCR, microwave oven and telephone, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Davis used his talents as a stage-set designer for the drama class at 
John H. Francis Polytechnic High School to create a refuge from his parents in 
an attic area above the stage, Principal Virginia Holt said. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe me, it was very, very surprising to all of us that a student could do 
this. But if a student is creative and enterprising enough, he can do anything 
he wants," Holt said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis was arrested at the school Tuesday morning on suspicion of trespassing 
after campus police discovered his hide-out when they apprehended three 
companions the night before, Holt and police said. He is free on $2,500 bail, 
Los Angeles Police Detective Oscar Caraballo said. 
</P>
<P>
Holt, who gave reporters a tour of the garret Friday, said Davis took up 
residence there during Christmas vacation, apparently because of trouble with 
his parents. 
</P>
<P>
"He had problems at home with his parents and needed a place to stay," the 
principal said. She said Davis' parents did not contact school authorities 
during their son's absence, but she declined to provide further details. 
</P>
<P>
Davis and his parents could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"He really had no place else to go," said Antonio Brown, 18, who said he was 
one of six students who knew where Davis was living. "I knew about it for some 
time but didn't say anything about it. I didn't want him to get into further 
trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Davis attended classes as usual while he lived above the stage, the principal 
said, and managed to avoid detection because of "a very large, very active 
school." 
</P>
<P>
Holt said the three-year high school on Roscoe Boulevard has more than 2,300 
students enrolled in day classes and about 1,200 in night school. "People are 
here as of 6 a.m. and they're here until 11 p.m.," she said. "He may have been 
seen as just anyone here." 
</P>
<P>
The principal declined to discuss Davis' academic record in detail but said "he 
was a rather creative kid" who was involved in the school drama club and 
enrolled in a stage-crew class, in which he excelled at designing lighting, 
sound, props and other technical systems. 
</P>
<P>
Because of his involvement with the stage, Davis was entrusted with a key to 
the auditorium, and he made at least two duplicates, Holt said. 
</P>
<P>
The small, triangular room he occupied was among several crannies in an attic 
space above the school stage. It is used to gain access to the auditorium's 
loudspeakers, according to Holt and the school's plant manager, Eric Hillman. 
</P>
<P>
Davis painted the speaker room's bare, concrete walls white and installed 
wall-to-wall, khaki-colored carpeting. He built a loft space in which to sleep 
and installed a mattress, couch and chair. He hooked up a telephone to the 
school's system, Holt said. 
</P>
<P>
The microwave, and some but not all of the other items Davis used, were taken 
from the school, according to Holt, who said administrators and teachers 
noticed the appliances were missing but were unable to determine where they had 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
A narrow, metal ladder offers the only entry to the room, so Davis must have 
installed his furniture and appliances by hoisting them up on stage 
scaffolding, Holt said. 
</P>
<P>
Holt said Davis changed the lock on the speaker room's door, confusing school 
custodians who tried to enter and then assumed that the school administration 
was responsible for the change. According to the principal and police, a campus 
supervisor noticed a youth trying to enter the building about 11 p.m. Monday, 
became suspicious and alerted school police. Officers entered the auditorium 
and found four students, including Davis. They arrested three, but Davis fled. 
</P>
<P>
He turned himself in at the school the next morning and told authorities his 
story, Holt said. 
</P>
<P>
Holt said she had not decided whether to take administrative action against 
Davis. A spokesman for the Los Angeles County district attorney's office, which 
will decide whether to file any criminal charges, said it had not yet received 
Davis' case for review.

ADOPTION LINES FORM FOR BURROS, WILD HORSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY LIBMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nine-year-old Laura Riedman knew exactly what she wanted at the Bureau of Land 
Management's wild horse and burro adoption Friday at Pierce College in Woodland 
Hills. And she found it. 
</P>
<P>
The blonde fourth-grader chose a 6-month-old black and brown filly because "she 
was pretty, she looked calm, she had nice eyes, she had a strong back, she had 
straight legs and she had a good strong chest. 
</P>
<P>
"I love horses," said the gum-chewing youngster from La Mesa, east of San 
Diego. "They're big and beautiful and fast and exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Riedman's mustang had been rounded up in the high desert near China Lake, near 
Ridgecrest in the Mojave Desert, which the federal BLM says is overpopulated 
with horses and burros. The animals were trucked to holding pens in Ridgecrest 
and then to adoption sites. At Pierce, the BLM offered 75 horses for $125 each 
and 20 burros for $75 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Nunn, wild horse and burro technician for the BLM's Riverside District, 
said that because of a cut in federal funding, only one adoption will be held 
in Southern California this year and that many animals will be shipped for 
adoption to the East or Midwest. There were four adoptions in Southern 
California in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"There are more people who want them than can get them," said Becky Borquez, 
state coordinator for the American Mustang and Burro Assn. "The problem is, why 
subject them to a three-day ride? They get cuts and bruises and banged up. They 
kick each other. I'd like to see them kept here." 
</P>
<P>
The donkeys, which is another name for burros, proved more popular than the 
mustangs. By midday, animal enthusiasts had claimed 11 burros, which are about 
the size of Shetland ponies, but only 16 horses. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining animals will be available to the public from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
today and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
A beaming Caren Woodruff of Fullerton was the first Friday to take home a 
donkey, a 2-year-old gray female. 
</P>
<P>
"She started to walk toward me in the pen," Woodruff said as her new animal 
kicked lightly against the side of the trailer. "She seemed a little friendlier 
than the others and I thought I'd have a better time teaching her." 
</P>
<P>
Gemini Herzog, a Pierce College student seeking a burro for adoption, said that 
since 1982, she has owned a pet donkey that she keeps at her home in 
Garberville in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
"She's the greatest pet," Herzog said. "She hangs out in the yard. You can put 
a pack on her. She thinks she's a person. She'll come into the house if you let 
her. She drinks soda from a can if you hold it. If you have a cup and walk by 
with it, she'll drink out of that." 
</P>
<P>
"There is no such thing as an unadoptable burro," Nunn said. "We have people 
who drive to our holding pen in Ridgecrest from Montana to get them. 
</P>
<P>
"They are getting real popular as predator control. You put them with sheep and 
they run coyotes off. In the East, they will run off packs of dogs. And they 
are good for pets and pack animals. . . . They eat less than horses and they 
are real good weed eaters." 
</P>
<P>
Although the burros are popular, horse lovers such as Laura Riedman and her 
father, Dick, a Cal State San Diego professor, were equally pleased by the 
opportunity to take home a healthy mustang. 
</P>
<P>
Riedman selected a 4-year-old steel-gray gelding that shook the metal rails of 
his holding pen and repeatedly kicked the wooden gate behind him before being 
allowed to run through a chute into the Riedmans' trailer. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked the way he moved and positioned himself with the other horses," said 
Riedman, explaining why he selected the gelding. "Mustangs have qualities of 
durability that appeal to me." 
</P>
<P>
Observers said that with caring owners, even the wild mustangs would become 
good pets. 
</P>
<P>
"Their experience with humans hasn't been real terrific," Borquez said. "In 
their first contact, they get rounded up by helicopters and placed in big 
corrals and freeze-branded on the neck. 
</P>
<P>
"But once they build up trust, they are wonderful. I have a mustang mare who's 
4 years old and I swear if she could crawl into my lap, she would."

2 SUPERVISORS BACK BOLAND FOR ASSEMBLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County supervisors Mike Antonovich and Deane Dana on Friday 
endorsed Republican Paula Boland in the 38th Assembly District primary race, 
lauding her for her devotion to neighborhood, business and political activities 
in the northern San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Boland is running for the Republican nomination for the Assembly seat vacated 
by Marian W. La Follette, who surprised political observers a month ago by 
announcing that she would not seek re-election after representing the area for 
10 years. 
</P>
<P>
La Follette endorsed her aide, Robert Wilcox, in the June 5 primary. 
</P>
<P>
Dana described Boland as "hard-working and energetic," while Antonovich called 
her a "dynamic candidate."

AROUND THE VALLEY: PEACE TALKS AT EL CAMINO HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sebastian Rotella 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's not hard to develop the perception that American teen-agers are vacuous, 
indolent degenerates so consumed by television, drugs, gangs and other 
distractions that they couldn't find New Jersey on a map, let alone Israel. 
</P>
<P>
So Amir Gal and Shany Bentulila Aron, two youth ambassadors from Israel who are 
on a speaking tour of the West Coast, had their doubts about the maturity and 
sophistication of their counterparts here. 
</P>
<P>
Amir and Shany will be trading their textbooks for Israeli army automatic 
weapons in a couple of years, about the time their local peers might be trading 
the keys of the station wagon for the keys of the Camaro. 
</P>
<P>
But at El Camino Real High School in West Hills this week, Amir and Shany spent 
an afternoon with two groups of students who left the visitors tired and 
impressed. The conversations were exuberant and surprisingly sophisticated. The 
political debate was intense, bringing flashes of emotion and pain from a 
far-off conflict to a tranquil corner of the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"Very, very small country," was the refrain of the ambassadors' presentation in 
accented but fluid English as they displayed a map of Israel superimposed onto 
Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
"We are surrounded by 21 Arab nations," said Amir, 16, who is slender and 
poised and wears his hair in a fashionable tail down his back. "We have a peace 
treaty only with Egypt. . . . With the rest, we have a status of war." 
</P>
<P>
Amir and Shany, 17, belong to an elite group of 66 young people selected from 
1,000 applicants. They are trained by the Israeli government to tour the world 
talking about what their lives are like in their country. They and officials 
involved in the project said their purpose is not strictly political. But their 
defense of Israel's role in the Mideast conflict, particularly the Palestinian 
uprising, was polished and fervent. 
</P>
<P>
"The media is interested in little Palestinian kids throwing stones," Amir 
said. "What you see in the media is the Palestinian side. We are here to give 
you our point of view." 
</P>
<P>
The El Camino Real students were a classic American cross-section: Jewish, 
black, Asian, Latino, Iranian and your basic Southern California Anglo. 
Regardless of ethnicity, they favored the uniform of T-shirts and jeans. They 
engaged in a good deal of slouching, cheering and wisecracks. Their questions 
were pointed. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have no gangs?" asked Kuan Nguyen. The visitors explained that 
nonpolitical turf war is not a problem where they come from, although it's 
dangerous to walk in some areas depending on your religion. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen drew laughter, but it was apparent that to some kids, the question was 
no joke. You could see in the eyes of other kids that some issues were hitting 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"As a Jew, I understand the Jewish side," said senior Nathan Kahane. "I don't 
understand why the Israelis don't want the Palestinians to have a homeland. I 
want to hear your point of view." 
</P>
<P>
Amir responded that he believes Jordan should be considered a Palestinian 
state. He said he sees no reason to give Palestinians a second homeland. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't say we don't want peace," said Shany, who is tall and wore a pink 
sweat shirt. She said she has a friend in the army whose face was disfigured by 
a Molotov cocktail attack in the West Bank. "For 40 years, we tried to achieve 
peace." 
</P>
<P>
A big earnest student nicknamed Rob -- he is an Afghan Muslim named Rohullaha 
-- began firing questions with the zeal of a prosecutor during 
cross-examination. 
</P>
<P>
"Why did you occupy Palestine?" he asked. "Why did you invade Lebanon, where 
you caused lots of damage, lots of death, for what?" 
</P>
<P>
Amir drew a parallel to the U. S. invasion of Panama and talked about women and 
children slaughtered in Arab terrorist attacks. The exchange grew heated. Some 
students were fascinated. Others looked uncomfortable or sad. One boy buried 
his head in his arms. 
</P>
<P>
"How much is a pair of Levi's in Israel?" someone interrupted, returning the 
conversation abruptly to the universal teen-age realm. The hilarity continued 
when the visitors played part of a Hebrew rap song that had something to do 
with a man describing his wife's mustache. 
</P>
<P>
But these kids were incurably philosophical. 
</P>
<P>
They talked about whether compulsory military service helps or hinders a 
career, whether it is appropriate to put monetary and political concerns above 
moral ones, what Israelis think of Jews in this country. 
</P>
<P>
"I find you guys real intellectual compared to the juniors at our school," 
senior Nathan told Amir and Shany, drawing loud boos from the juniors. 
</P>
<P>
Humaira Malik, a petite, sweet-voiced junior whose family are Muslims from 
Pakistan, said afterward that she enjoyed the presentation. But she did not 
appear convinced by the answers to her questions about the Palestinian issue. 
And she said: "It was too prepared. I didn't think all of it was their words." 
</P>
<P>
Shany and Rohullaha talked and smiled after class. 
</P>
<P>
Shany has made a point of getting to know Arab students she meets in this 
country. "It's not like, if you're Arab, we hate you," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, the Israelis end their six-week visit to the United States. Sunday, 
they go back to a place where the divisions are stark, where the army will 
fast-forward them into adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be a lawyer," Amir said. "If I make it." 
</P>
<P>
With the American kids, they leave behind memories, laughter and questions that 
adults have been trying to answer for centuries.

REFORM THAT PARTLY BACKFIRED; 
</P>
<P>
THE IMMIGRATION LAW NEEDS FIXING -- BUT NOT REPEALING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's now clear that the immigration reform law Congress passed in 1986 is 
causing discrimination against U.S. citizens who look or sound "foreign." 
That's not reason enough to repeal it, but it's certainly cause for Congress to 
head back to the drawing board on immigration. 
</P>
<P>
Congress' General Accounting Office has issued a much-anticipated report on how 
the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act is working, and concluded that the 
new law is achieving its main purpose by discouraging business from hiring 
illegal immigrants. But government investigators also found "widespread 
discrimination" resulting from the law. The GAO report underscored the 
conclusion of other agencies that many employers are not hiring anyone they 
suspect of being foreign-born. 
</P>
<P>
GAO did not try to determine why this pattern of discrimination exists -- 
whether because employers want to avoid hassle or because some employers 
deliberately exclude foreign-born workers. But any discrimination is 
unacceptable, especially if it's being encouraged by an official act of 
Congress. That's why several members of Congress who voted for the 1986 law now 
say they want to reconsider it. 
</P>
<P>
Reconsidering the IRCA won't be easy. But there are enough knowledgeable people 
in Congress and among the various interest groups involved in the immigration 
issue to hammer out some revisions of the 1986 law without Capitol Hill 
grinding to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
For a start, how about spending more to better educate employers about the new 
law? Some discrimination may result from simple ignorance. And Congress should 
simply order the Justice Department to crack down on any deliberate 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
One thing Congress must not do is buy the idea promoted by some immigration 
restrictionists: that all legal U.S. workers should be issued work permits. In 
a time when the right to privacy is already invaded in so many subtle ways, 
most Americans simply won't standfor a national identity card -- and shouldn't 
have to. 
</P>
<P>
Some groups that never wanted the 1986 law enacted in the first place will now 
demand that it be repealed, but that's overreacting, too. IRCA was not all bad. 
It allowed millions of illegal immigrants to begin legalizing their status and 
kept some would-be illegals from being exploited. Illegal immigration is such a 
complex historic phenomenon that no one law can control it, only regulate it 
slightly. That's why IRCA shouldn't be tossed out, just fine-tuned.

HE BLEW THE WHISTLE ON IRAQ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's easy to wonder nowadays if there's anything Americans won't do for a buck. 
This week, however, San Marcos businessman Jerold Kowalsky showed pretty 
clearly that there is. 
</P>
<P>
We're grateful for that -- almost as grateful as we are for the fact that he 
probably kept Iraq from getting the bomb, at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
Kowalsky, a 57-year-old Naval Academy graduate and former submarine officer, is 
president of CSI Technologies, which makes specialized voltage capacitors, 
devices that store and concentrate large amounts of electrical power. They're 
handy for all sorts of things, and can be configured to trigger nuclear bombs. 
</P>
<P>
For some years, Iraq has purchased the firm's capacitors for use in radar and 
radio transmitters. In 1988, however, Iraqi agents placed an order for devices 
whose configuration was appropriate only for a nuclear trigger. Kowalsky 
immediately notified U.S. authorities. Over the next two years, he also 
participated in an elaborate sting operation that foiled Baghdad's plot and, 
this week, resulted in the breakup of a London-based Iraqi-sponsored nuclear 
smuggling ring. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqis had long been good customers and there was money to be made in the 
deal, but Kowalsky's reasons for blowing the whistle were straightforward and 
compelling: "With the Cold War winding down," he said, "I regard nuclear 
proliferation as a major threat to world peace and (believe) that foreign 
countries building nuclear bombs is a major hazard." 
</P>
<P>
Kowalsky's willingness to put principle ahead of this quarter's profit is a 
welcome affirmation of the notion that there's a place for conscience on the 
bottom line.

PRESIDENT BUSH BANS BROCCOLI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I don't understand all the concern that America's children aren't going to eat 
their broccoli simply because President Bush doesn't eat his. As vice 
president, Bush couldn't keep the broccoli off his plate; he had to become 
President to do that. So the message is clear: The only way to avoid eating 
broccoli is to become President.

<P>
All the publicity about President Bush's distaste for broccoli is just so much 
"corn" and will only encourage tomato throwing. 
</P>
<P>
If the President will read my lips, he will discover that broccoli is good for 
a kinder, gentler nation. It certainly is a better diet than chili or lima 
beans. Don't give up, Barbara. The White House may yet become the Green House.

Headlines read: "Gorbachev Demands Lithuanians Surrender Personal Guns." Why 
would he do such a thing? Maybe he doesn't trust honest, law-abiding citizens 
to be free. 
</P>
<P>
And in the United States, certain politicians demand Americans surrender 
private guns (a little at a time: handguns, "assault" guns, semi-automatics, 
etc). Don't they trust honest, law-abiding citizens either? Wake up, America. 
If you don't protect each of your freedoms, you could lose them all.

PRESIDENT BUSH BANS BROCCOLI

<TEXT>
<P>
News that President Bush has taken a tough stand on broccoli has me confused. I 
can't understand why growers sent him 10 tons of the stuff when he clearly 
expressed his personal aversion to it. 
</P>
<P>
This tasteless episode is a chilling reminder that agricultural interests in 
America are so pampered and deluded by subsidies for plowing, subsidies for not 
plowing, parities, cheap water, caves full of cheese, price supports and tax 
breaks that could make any working stiff with a good CPA wealthy, that they 
judge a man's personal preference for broccoli as an attack and retaliate by 
sending him 10 tons of it! 
</P>
<P>
The drug cartel has better manners than these rowdies. No one sent the 
President a truckload of crack as he denounced the use and production of this 
vile drug with similar, though less newsworthy, vehemence.

SON OF CULT LEADER LOSES FIGHT AGAINST EXTRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 19-year-old son of a cult leader wanted in Ohio in connection with the 
killings of a family of five was ordered Friday to be extradited next week. 
</P>
<P>
Damon Lundgren, whose fight against extradition has progressed further than his 
father's and two other cult members', is to be given to Ohio authorities at 8 
a.m. Wednesday, San Diego Municipal Judge Bill Woodward ordered. 
</P>
<P>
Lundgren's attorney, Tom Senters, protested the order because a writ has been 
filed with the California Supreme Court seeking to stay the proceedings until 
it can review the case. 
</P>
<P>
Senters argued before Woodward that a continuance of the hearing should be 
granted because of the possibility that the high court might intervene. 
</P>
<P>
Woodward disagreed, but ruled that Lundgren is not to leave the state until 
Wednesday, giving the Supreme Court time to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm simply ordering an extradition. We will communicate this to the demanding 
state," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
Lundgren's father, Jeffrey Lundgren, 39, and two followers, Daniel Kraft, 25, 
and Kathryn Johnson, 36, are also fighting extradition to Lake County, Ohio, 
where the bodies of the five victims were found buried in a barn. Investigators 
believe they were killed execution style in a religious sacrifice for the cult, 
which numbered about 18. 
</P>
<P>
Senters told the court that the Supreme Court clerk told him Thursday that the 
court had not decided whether to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no knowledge as to how long it takes for the Supreme Court to act. I do 
not know when the Supreme Court received the writ," Senters said. 
</P>
<P>
"The court is actively reviewing the matter, as of yesterday," Senters told the 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
Senters said Damon Lundgren's case has progressed faster than the others 
because he filed the legal papers before the other attorneys did.

ROWE QUITS 78TH ASSEMBLY RACE IN BID FOR REPUBLICAN UNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY HORSTMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republican lawyer Helen Rowe withdrew from the special 78th Assembly District 
race Friday, continuing the party's bid to unify its efforts to ensure that 
Democrat Mike Gotch does not win election outright in next month's primary in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Rowe, one of the three Republicans in the eight-candidate race, said that her 
decision to drop out of the April 10 race and back fellow GOP contender Jeff 
Marston stemmed from the county Republican Assembly delegation's earlier 
endorsement of Marston. Insurance broker Jane Ramshaw is the third Republican 
in the contest. 
</P>
<P>
"In January, I told party leaders that I thought it was in the best interests 
of the party to choose one of us," Rowe said. "They did that by choosing Jeff 
Marston. That was a clear signal to me that they agreed with my strategy but 
didn't think I was the one who could could carry the day." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Marston, a one-time aide to former San Diego City Council member 
Gloria McColl and former Sen. S. I. Hayakawa (R-Calif.), was endorsed by the 
county's four-member GOP Assembly delegation -- Robert Frazee of Carlsbad, 
Sunny Mojonnier of Encinitas, Tricia Hunter of Bonita and Carol Bentley of El 
Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
Though Rowe's name will remain on the ballot, she intends to "try to unring the 
bell as best I can" to ensure that her supporters do not waste their votes on 
her but rather redirect their ballots to Marston. 
</P>
<P>
Under the unorthodox procedures governing special elections, all candidates of 
all parties will appear on a single ballot in next month's primary. If no 
candidate receives more than 50% of the vote -- a percentage that only former 
San Diego City Councilman Gotch is thought to have even a slim chance of 
surpassing -- the top vote-getters of each party will compete in a June runoff 
for the Assembly seat vacated by Democrat Lucy Killea's election to the state 
Senate in December. BARRY HORSTMAN

LAWYER MAKES PLEA FOR KILLER'S LIFE; 
</P>
<P>
PENALTY: THE NURSE WHO PAID TO HAVE HER ROOMMATE KILLED IS CALLED A MODEL 
INMATE. THE PROSECUTION SAYS SHE IS STILL A THREAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA KLEIN LERNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 42-year-old registered nurse convicted of hiring a co-worker to murder her 
roommate should be spared the death penalty because she has been a model jail 
inmate since her arrest and will be punished enough by a life in prison, her 
attorney told a Van Nuys Superior Court jury Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Ingber asked jurors to recommend a sentence of life in prison without the 
possibility of parole for Maureen McDermott, saying she "is already dead as far 
as freedom. The only question is when she will physically die." 
</P>
<P>
"She is never going to have privacy the rest of her life. She's not going to go 
for a drive. . . . She'll never see the ocean again nor will she ever have a 
chance to see the stars. . . . Every day, someone will be telling her when to 
get up, where to go, when to go to sleep," Ingber said. 
</P>
<P>
Since her arrest nearly five years ago, McDermott has been a model inmate at 
Sybil Brand Institute, where she once saved the life of a prisoner choking on 
an apple and another time alerted deputies to an inmate's suicide attempt, 
Ingber said. 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Dist. Atty. Katherine Mader on Thursday called McDermott a "mutation 
of a human being." Mader asked jurors to recommend a sentence of death in the 
gas chamber, saying McDermott might someday plot to kill a fellow prison inmate 
or official. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody with a heart or a soul could possibly have done what Maureen McDermott 
did in this case," Mader told the jury, which on March 2 convicted McDermott of 
first-degree murder with special circumstances in the April 28, 1985, death of 
Stephen Eldridge. The jury also convicted McDermott of attempted murder in a 
failed March 21, 1985, attempt on Eldridge's life. 
</P>
<P>
McDermott faces the death penalty or life in prison without the possibility of 
parole because the jury found that she lay in wait to kill Eldridge and did so 
for financial gain. The ultimate decision will be up to Superior Court Judge 
Alan B. Haber. 
</P>
<P>
Eldridge, 27, was stabbed 44 times and his penis was cut off in the Van Nuys 
house that he shared with McDermott, a former nurse at County-USC Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said McDermott hired James Flores Luna, a former orderly, to kill 
Eldridge so that she could collect on a $100,000 mortgage insurance policy on 
the house they co-owned, prosecutors contended. 
</P>
<P>
McDermott instructed Luna to mutilate Eldridge's body in hopes of making it 
look like a homosexual crime of passion, which she thought less likely to be 
thoroughly investigated by police, Mader told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend that McDermott also hired Luna in 1983 to break the arm or 
leg of a private-duty nurse whose job she wanted so that the nurse would be 
unable to work. 
</P>
<P>
Luna, 36, the key witness against McDermott, pleaded guilty to murder with 
special circumstances after being promised that prosecutors would not seek the 
death penalty. His sentence is pending. 
</P>
<P>
Mader alleged that after the March 21 attempt on Eldridge's life -- which 
McDermott herself arranged -- McDermott comforted Eldridge while secretly 
plotting to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
Ingber and Carl Burkow, McDermott's two court-appointed defense attorneys, 
argued that police did a shoddy investigation and attacked the credibility of 
Luna.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN ARRESTED IN HIT-AND-RUN CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles police said Friday that a month of hard work and a stroke of good 
luck allowed them to arrest an accused hit-and-run driver whose car allegedly 
struck and killed a woman and her uncle on Burbank Boulevard in Reseda last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Police had only sketchy information when they began investigating the Feb. 25 
accident that killed Claudia Jean Schwartz, 37, of Reseda and her uncle, Arnold 
Feldman, 61, of Santa Maria. 
</P>
<P>
"With the initial information, it was almost an impossible case. The car was 
described as possibly a tired old Chevy Camaro, and that was it," said 
Detective Dennis Ulick. 
</P>
<P>
Ulick and his partner, Wayne Dufort, stopped and interviewed more than a dozen 
Camaro drivers and followed numerous tips from residents with little result. 
</P>
<P>
They followed another such tip this week regarding a Camaro parked near Tampa 
Avenue and Oxnard Street in Tarzana and diligently canvassed the area. After 
several hours, they spotted the car and linked it to Michael Richard Morse, 28, 
Ulick said. 
</P>
<P>
Morse, who Ulick said had repainted his car and taken out the engine, was 
arrested Thursday at the Tarzana house where he lived with his girlfriend, 
Pamela Lewis, 26. She was also taken into custody on suspicion of being an 
accessory to the crime, Ulick said. 
</P>
<P>
"We got very, very lucky," Ulick said. "It was very frustrating work." 
</P>
<P>
Ulick said Morse admitted that he was the driver of the car that struck 
Schwartz and her uncle. In February, 1989, Morse fled from a halfway house 
where he had been serving a prison sentence for drug possession, Ulick said.

FEW BUILDING PLANS SUBMITTED AS MORATORIUM EXPIRES IN BURBANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A yearlong construction moratorium in Burbank, imposed to give the city time to 
develop new building restrictions, came to an end this week, but few developers 
have submitted plans for new projects because the City Council is still 
haggling over new rules. 
</P>
<P>
City Planner Rick Pruetz said that although a moratorium on issuance of new 
permits for construction of apartment buildings expired Wednesday, the city has 
received fewer than half a dozen proposals for new projects. 
</P>
<P>
Before the moratorium, the city received about 150 building plans per year. 
</P>
<P>
Pruetz said some developers are reluctant to propose new projects because the 
city building guidelines are still being revised. 
</P>
<P>
After voters approved a ballot initiative calling for growth controls last 
year, the City Council imposed the construction moratorium so it could write 
new building guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Council members are considering imposing a developers fee to help pay for the 
city services required by the additional residents brought to the city by new 
housing. Many developers would rather wait until the fee proposal is complete 
before submitting building plans, Pruetz said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION ORDERED FOR DOG KILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A letter carrier who shot and killed a dog while delivering mail on his Arleta 
route last December was ordered Friday to undergo a psychiatric evaluation 
before being sentenced for the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando Superior Court Judge Meredith C. Taylor delayed sentencing for 
Floyd Bertran Sterling to April 26. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling, 35, of Pacoima, pleaded no contest Feb. 21 to one count of felony 
cruelty to animals. In exchange, prosecutors agreed to drop charges of carrying 
a concealed weapon and using a firearm in a grossly negligent manner. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling shot and killed Skippy, a mixed-breed German shepherd, just as the 
dog's owner emerged from her house to give the postman a bottle of vodka for 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said the psychiatric report would help her decide whether to follow a 
probation officer's "exceptionally favorable" sentencing recommendation. The 
report recommended that Sterling receive jail time followed by probation. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said she was concerned by an earlier violent incident involving 
Sterling, an apparent reference to Sterling's 1982 conviction for misdemeanor 
spousal abuse. Deputy Dist. Atty. David R. Lopez said he wants Sterling 
sentenced to the maximum of one year in jail and three years' felony probation. 
Sterling could be fined a maximum of $20,000.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DMV IN N. HOLLYWOOD HALTS DRIVING TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials of the state Department of Motor Vehicles announced Friday that they 
will no longer offer the behind-the-wheel portion of the driver's license test 
at their North Hollywood office because neighbors complained that the tests 
generated too much traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had a considerable number of complaints since the office opened in 
November, 1988, that the traffic in the area was disturbing them because there 
was too much of it," DMV spokesman Bill Gengler said. 
</P>
<P>
Between 25 and 35 people a day took the practical driving test at the office in 
the 10900 block of Victory Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Gengler said DMV officials hope that canceling the tests will alleviate some 
congestion. "We want to be good neighbors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gengler said he did not know whether such tests had been canceled at any other 
DMV office, but said that in the past, the routes that examiners used had been 
changed in response to neighbors' complaints. 
</P>
<P>
The office will continue to provide all other driver's license and registration 
services. Applicants needing a behind-the-wheel test will be directed to DMV 
offices in Arleta, Van Nuys, Glendale or Hollywood, he said.

What credibility is there in major league baseball? First, we had the 
nonsensical delay of games. 
</P>
<P>
Then they can't figure out how to play 162 games. They could play old-fashioned 
doubleheaders, but of course, that would be giving the fans two games for the 
price of one. Don't want to do that too often, do we?

YOU CAN'T PUT A PRICE ON HIGH SCHOOL SPIRIT

I was disconcerted to read Lonnie White's article (March 20) expressing the 
opinion that Loyola High was accepted into the Southern California regional 
basketball tournament instead of Crenshaw because we spent more money 
publicizing our team. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior at Loyola, I serve as the varsity basketball statistician. The 
statistic booklet, which "hyped the Cubs' season," was personally compiled 
during my free time away from schoolwork. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola's record justified the team's inclusion in the tournament. Don't 
downgrade the hard work of Loyola's student-athletes. We earned our way in, we 
did not buy it in.

Way to go, Orel Hershiser! Start the season off with a positive professional 
attitude. Perhaps you should be able to sit and watch the balloons and bands, 
because, as you stated, without incentive clauses in your contract, your record 
is incidental. What with your high salary and numerous endorsements, why worry 
about opening day and your team?

I had a dream. Los Angeles and Oakland both turned down Al Davis' request for a 
billion-dollar franchise fee, so he decided that his would be the first team in 
outer space, namely the moon.

However, upon applying for a license to take his team there, NASA rejected his 
request. Their reason? "There is enough debris in space already."

CLIPPERS RALLY, BUT THEY CAN'T BEAT HAWKS; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: ATLANTA ESCAPES, 122-118, DESPITE GARRICK'S 18 ASSISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The tough stretch of the schedule yielded another tough loss for the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta's Moses Malone made a fall-away shot from the left post under tight 
pressure by Benoit Benjamin with 1:15 left. The Hawks' Dominique Wilkins 
connected from near the left baseline despite pressure from Ken Norman. Nothing 
came easy for Atlanta, but it paid off. 
</P>
<P>
But when it came time for the Clippers to make a pressure shot, the only thing 
that fell was their won-lost record. Tom Garrick's straight-away three-pointer 
to tie with one second to play rattled off the rim, and the Hawks added a free 
throw for a 122-118 victory before 13,830 Friday night at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Moses Malone was fouled after grabbing Garrick's missed shot and made one free 
throw after time had expired. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers, losers of seven of their last eight during a run that has 
included the Lakers and Utah Jazz twice, also lost their chance to sweep 
Atlanta for the first time in the 20-year franchise history. A career-high 18 
assists by Garrick, against only four turnovers, went along with it. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we played well enough to win," Coach Don Casey said after the 
Clippers fell to 27-45. "We just gave up too many points." 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta improved to 34-37. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers fought back from a 108-97 deficit with 7:13 left to make the score 
114-114 on Danny Manning's two free throws with 2:24 remaining. That was part 
of a stretch during which the Clippers scored on seven consecutive possessions. 
</P>
<P>
But the Hawks took the lead as Alexander Volkov made a twisting shot in the 
lane. When Malone made one of two attempts from the free-throw line with 1:44 
to play, the Hawks were ahead by three. 
</P>
<P>
In between, Clipper momentum was hit with a major setback. Charles Smith got 
his sixth foul with 1:54 to play, leaving after scoring 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing an impressive offensive showing that began with the second half of 
Wednesday's game with the Lakers, the Clippers scored 60 points in the first 
two quarters against the Hawks to lead by five at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers shot 61.9% in the first 12 minutes, getting 10 points from Smith 
and nine from Garrick during that stretch. When they cooled off in the second 
quarter, Benjamin stepped forward with eight points. He also finished with 23. 
</P>
<P>
Garrick had 15 points on five-of-six shooting, and his 10 assists were one 
short of his career high by halftime. Benjamin had 14 points and five blocked 
shots, and Smith 12 points as the Clippers shot a combined 55.8% in the half. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers led until the final moments of the third quarter, when Atlanta, 
winners of five in a row at the Sports Arena coming in, made the score 86-86 as 
Spud Webb converted the free throw after Ken Norman was assessed a technical 
foul. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers made the score again, 88-88, on Smith's short jumper with 10 
seconds left. But the Hawks answered, Volkov hitting a three-point basket in 
front of the Clipper bench at the buzzer. That gave Atlanta a 91-88 lead 
heading into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
After not dressing for Wednesday's game against the Lakers, Winston Garland, 
although still sore from a fall Monday, returned to action. Garland wasn't sure 
whether he would play, but Coach Don Casey brought him off the bench in the 
first quarter, starting Tom Garrick at the point instead. "Still a little 
groggy, a little dizzy," is how Garland described his status after falling on 
his left hip, neck and head while going for a rebound against Minnesota. "The 
neck and back are still sore," said Garland, who passed a series of exams 
before being cleared to play. 
</P>
<P>
Hot-shooting Danny Manning had moved up to ninth in the league in field-goal 
percentage heading into Friday's game, at 53.6%. Manning, who has written "44" 
on his sneakers in memory of Hank Gathers, had a 59.3% success rate in the 13 
games before the Hawk game. . . . Benoit Benjamin, the Clippers' all-time 
leader in blocked shots, recorded his 1,000th when he swatted away Kevin 
Willis' shot from the lane in the first quarter. Thirty other players have also 
reached 1,000 in NBA history. . . . The Clippers finished 13-13 against the 
Eastern Conference, including 6-7 at the Sports Arena.

EVEN A JORDAN MISS CAN BRING VICTORY FOR BULLS

<P>
The way things are going for Michael Jordan these days, even a missed shot can 
turn into a game-winner for the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan followed a career-high 69-point performance with 49 more Friday night 
against the New York Knicks, but his airball led to Stacey King's basket with 
12 seconds left in overtime and gave the Bulls a 107-106 victory at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan had driven the baseline on the left side before tossing up a shot that 
went over the rim and into the hands of King, who laid it in for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in the right place at the right time," King said. "We knew Michael was 
going up for the shot, and I knew I better be there for the rebound in case he 
missed. It was a blessing." 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Ewing scored a team-high 25 points for the Knicks, who have lost eight 
of their last nine games and 11 consecutive games at Chicago Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Scottie Pippen scored 14 points for the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 123, Detroit 111 -- Larry Bird scored 33 points and sparked a 10-0 
fourth-quarter run at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The 123 points were the most allowed this season by the Pistons, who lead the 
league in defense, yielding 97.4 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Lewis scored 25 points and Robert Parish added 23 for the Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
Isiah Thomas scored a team-high 32 points for the Pistons, who lost their 
fourth consecutive road game -- the team's longest such skid in three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 149, Denver 131 -- Charles Barkley scored a season-high 38 points 
at Philadelphia as the 76ers clinched a playoff spot with their best offensive 
performance of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Hersey Hawkins added 25 points for the 76ers, who extended their winning streak 
to six games. 
</P>
<P>
Alex English had a team-high 21 points for the Nuggets, who lost their fifth 
consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 139, Golden State 108 -- Xavier McDaniel scored 34 points at Seattle as 
the SuperSonics took a three-game lead over the Warriors in the battle for the 
eighth and final Western Conference playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Ellis added 21 points for the SuperSonics, who made 15 of 21 shots during 
the game-breaking third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Sarunas Marciulionis led the Warriors with 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix 126, New Jersey 119 -- Kevin Johnson scored 32 points and Tom Chambers 
added 31 at East Rutherford, N.J., in a game that had 10 technical fouls. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Morris scored a career-high 33 points for the Nets. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 84, Dallas 82 -- Sam Mitchell's follow shot at the buzzer gave the 
Timberwolves the victory at Dallas, ending the Mavericks' six-game winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Campbell led the Timberwolves with 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
Derek Harper scored a team-high 22 points for the Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 105, Miami 104 -- John Williams made a game-winning free throw with 
2.9 seconds left at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Price and Larry Nance scored 26 and 24 points, respectively, for the 
Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>

CHANNEL ISLANDS SHUT DOWN ON 1 HIT BY WESTLAKE'S EBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF RILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Channel Islands High threw some of the Marmonte League's top hitters at 
Westlake's Mike Eby on Friday, but the left-hander countered with near-perfect 
control in the Warriors' 1-0 win at Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
Eby (4-0) limited Channel Islands, which entered the game with a .350 batting 
average, to one hit as Westlake improved its league-leading record to 5-0. 
Westlake's 11-0 start is the best in school history. 
</P>
<P>
Eby, a 6-foot-2, 190-pound senior, needed just 60 pitches and allowed only Rich 
Tepezano (double) and Ventura Juarez (walk) to reach base. Eby's fastball peaks 
at 80 m.p.h., but two-thirds of his 60 pitches were strikes and he threw more 
than two balls to only Juarez. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't have overpowering stuff, but he spots the ball really well," 
Channel Islands Coach Don Cardinal said. "He sets the tempo and stays within 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands' aggressive, first-pitch batting strategy didn't hurt Eby, 
either. Eight times, Eby needed only one pitch to retire a batter. He also had 
a streak in which seven were retired on eight pitches. 
</P>
<P>
"That makes things real easy and real fun," said Eby, who lowered his 
earned-run average to 0.77. 
</P>
<P>
Yet he seldom had time to relax. 
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands' Manuel Padilla (2-2), a senior right-hander, limited Westlake 
to singles by Mike Lieberthal and James Jones and an unearned run. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to take any credit away from Manny, but we just can't buy a hit 
right now," Coach Rich Herrera said. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake scored in the second inning. Todd Preston walked, stole second, and 
reached third on a passed ball. Preston scored one out later, when Keenan 
McAluney hit a high hopper that third baseman Angel Aragon fielded but followed 
with a wild throw to first. 
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands (7-5, 1-3) threatened to score in the sixth when Juarez walked 
and pinch-runner Lamont Pearson was sacrificed to second. But Eby retired the 
next two hitters on four pitches.

DAVIS GOES DEEP, HELPS HART SINK SAN GABRIEL, 5-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fly ball, groundout or even a check-swing roller probably would have 
sufficed. 
</P>
<P>
But Rob Davis belted a game-ending grand slam in the bottom of the seventh 
inning Friday as Hart High took over sole possession of first in the Foothill 
League with a 5-1 come-from-behind baseball victory over visiting San Gabriel. 
Davis' homer made a winner of Andrew Lorraine, who threw a one-hitter and 
struck out nine to improve his record to 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just thinking I had to get the fly ball," said Davis, who was two for 
three, including his first home run. "I hit it solid." 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied and none out, 1-1, Hart (8-1-2, 5-0 in league play) loaded 
the bases on an error, a single and an intentional walk. That set the stage for 
Davis, a senior shortstop and the Indians' leading batter (.483). 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't coached a kid who is any tougher than he is with the game on the 
line," Hart Coach Bud Murray said. "Ever since I've known him, that's how he's 
been. He's got a knack." 
</P>
<P>
Davis knocked the first pitch from right-hander Danny Ricabal over the 
left-field fence to trigger a jubilant dugout eruption and end what had been an 
entertaining duel of off-speed offerings between Ricabal and Lorraine. 
</P>
<P>
Lorraine, a senior left-hander with a puzzling assortment of pitches, allowed 
only five baserunners and retired the final 11 batters he faced while logging 
his second complete game. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Lorraine's only mistake -- a hanging curve in the second inning that junior 
Dan Terrazas hit over the left-field fence for a solo home run -- gave San 
Gabriel (5-5-1, 4-1) a 1-0 lead that almost stood up. 
</P>
<P>
"That would have been a tough one to lose," Lorraine said. "I'll tell you, Rob 
Davis is probably the best clutch hitter in the world. I gotta buy him 
something." 
</P>
<P>
Hart tied the score in the sixth on a bases-loaded sacrifice fly by 
pinch-hitter R. J. Simone that scored Davis. Ricabal (4-1), who struck out 
three while yielding eight hits, struck out Tom Wolff swinging to end the 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
"As good a game as Danny threw, Andy threw a better game," San Gabriel Coach 
Dick Guzman said. "We didn't produce any offense. Against a team like Hart, how 
long is (a one-run lead) going to last?" 
</P>
<P>
Hart, however, has struggled offensively. The Indians entered the game with a 
.260 batting average and only 13 extra-base hits in 258 at-bats. But the team 
slump, Davis said, won't last long. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to be OK," he said. "We hit well today. We knew it would be a 
tough game."

Cary Wichmann limited Chaminade High to four hits as Notre Dame cruised to an 
easy 9-1 victory over the Eagles on Friday in a San Fernando League opener at 
Chaminade. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Blair reached Wichmann for a second-inning home run, but the junior 
right-hander sailed to his third victory in four decisions, improving his 
two-year record to 15-3. 
</P>
<P>
"My arm was a bit sore yesterday, but I felt fine today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame (6-5-1, 1-0 in league play) tagged Chaminade left-hander Greg 
Galloway (2-1) for 12 hits before he was relieved in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
With Notre Dame leading, 2-1, after two innings, Chris Prince hit a two-run 
single in the third to give the Knights a 4-1 lead. Shortstop Ed Maldonado 
added a two-run double in the fifth, and pinch-hitter Steve Quaile cracked a 
two-run homer to left. 
</P>
<P>
Chaminade dropped to 7-5-1, 0-1 in league play. ERIC SHEPARD

Loyola 5, Alemany 3 -- Three Loyola home runs off Alemany left-hander Joey

for the Celts' only extra-base hit.

FOLKS WHO PRESERVE FOLK

<P>
When lease problems prompted Bill Goldsmith and his wife, Pearl Wolfe, to close 
the Old Time Cafe in January, 1988, the San Diego folk music community suffered 
a big loss. 
</P>
<P>
For more than eight years, the Leucadia coffeehouse had been the only county 
venue to regularly showcase touring folk acts from all over the world. It was 
Goldsmith's and Wolfe's desire to lessen the blow that led them, in the final 
days of the cafe, to establish San Diego Folk Heritage. The nonprofit, 
all-volunteer organization has since kept alive the Old Time Cafe's legacy by 
presenting a series of local folk concerts, including Saturday night's 
appearance by Odetta at the Del Mar Shores Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill and Pearl knew that, after the Old Time Cafe shut down, there wouldn't 
really be any other place in San Diego for touring folk musicians to play," 
said Bruce Reid, chairman of San Diego Folk Heritage's 10-member board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
"So, before they closed the cafe, they invited a number of us Old Time Cafe 
regulars to a meeting to see if there was some way for the music to continue. 
Actually, most of us who went to that meeting didn't realize what we were 
getting into. The prevalent feeling of the original board members was that Bill 
and Pearl wanted to continue presenting concerts under a nonprofit structure, 
and they needed a rubber-stamp board of directors to make it fly. 
</P>
<P>
"But what we found out was that their idea was to start a very active volunteer 
organization, and we were all going to do a lot of work. They served in an 
advisory capacity for six months; then they left town, and it was up to us to 
basically carry on." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Folk Heritage has, in fact, carried on -- with increasing success, 
Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
"Initially, we did concerts all over town, and that was pretty difficult," he 
said. "It's gotten a lot easier since we moved to one stable venue." 
</P>
<P>
That venue is the Del Mar Shores Auditorium on the Winston School campus, where 
San Diego Folk Heritage is now presenting two concerts a month by touring folk 
acts. 
</P>
<P>
Past shows have featured topical singer-songwriters Tom Paxton and Peter Alsop, 
Irish harpist Patrick Ball, English concertina-player Alistair Anderson, and 
mandolinist-guitarist Peter Ostroushko, a former regular on public radio's 
"Prairie Home Companion." 
</P>
<P>
Coming up are Celtic music group Black Thorn, with Paraguayan harpist Ed Lang, 
on May 12; Ronnie Gilbert, an original member of pioneering American folk 
revivalists the Weavers, on May 19, and the Iron Mountain String Band, which 
plays old-time hillbilly music, on June 2. 
</P>
<P>
"We're booking only traditional folk musicians, even those who aren't that well 
known," Reid said. "Tracy Schwarz, who recently played for us, is a good 
example. He's one of the foremost traditional interpreters in America -- he 
used to be with the New Lost City Ramblers, one of the bands that started the 
whole traditional music revival back in the 1950s -- and there's just nobody 
else in town who would have presented somebody like him." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Folk Heritage also publishes a bimonthly newsletter filled with 
concert updates, artist profiles and record reviews that is sent out to the 
more than 4,000 local folk fans on the groups mailing list, which it inherited 
from the Old Time Cafe, Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the organization sponsors New England "contra" dances the first 
and third Friday of every month at the Trinity United Methodist Church in North 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
"And just recently," Reid said, "we began doing monthly concerts by local 
musicians at the Del Mar Shores Auditorium, on top of our two other shows per 
month." 
</P>
<P>
The next home-grown talent night is April 21, with folk singers Pam and Maggie 
sharing the bill with North County bluegrass band the Unstrung Heroes. THOMAS

<P>
Odetta is a human jukebox of traditional American folk music. Her repertoire, 
both on record and in concert, ranges from 19th-Century slave songs and 
spirituals to the topical ballads of such 20th-Century folk icons as Woody 
Guthrie and Pete Seeger. 
</P>
<P>
And, although she periodically strays into other styles of music -- she's sung 
jazz, Broadway show tunes, even opera -- Odetta likes nothing better than to 
apply her rich, powerful voice and intense, evocative singing style to 
traditional American folk music -- the music that made us think, then made us 
act, in times past. 
</P>
<P>
"People are always asking me, 'Why don't you do more modern songs?' And I guess 
it's because I'm an ancestor worshiper and a historian," said Odetta, who will 
appear Saturday night at the Del Mar Shores Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the music that turned my life around, and I feel a need to continue 
that music so that more and more people can hear it -- and hear messages from 
those who have gone before us, hear how our ancestors got us through to better 
positions than they were in." 
</P>
<P>
History, after all, has a way of repeating itself, she said, and the message 
contained in these vintage tunes is as relevant today as when they were 
written. 
</P>
<P>
"We in this country are terribly confused," Odetta said. "I'm not sure we know 
exactly how we're confused, but there is something amiss with millions of 
dollars being shipped into other countries to kill civilians, and then there's 
not enough money to continue providing medicine for the elderly, who have 
worked all their lives and contributed to this country's welfare and should be 
receiving dividends, or for working people and their children. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of stuff that just doesn't compute, and I think people need to 
be assuaged, to be soothed, by knowing they're not the only ones feeling like 
there's something wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"The words to traditional folk songs were written out of concern, and there's 
as much to be concerned about now as there ever was." 
</P>
<P>
Odetta, who turned 59 Dec. 31, was born in Birmingham, Ala. She lost her father 
when she was 6, and later moved to Los Angeles with her mother, sister and 
stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
There she sang in her junior high school glee club and began taking private 
voice lessons. She later worked as an amateur at the Turnabout Theater in 
Hollywood and studied music at Los Angeles City College. In 1949, she won a 
part in the chorus of the touring musical production of "Finian's Rainbow." 
</P>
<P>
Later that year, the musical hit San Francisco for an extended stay, Odetta 
recalled, and it was there -- in the coffeehouses she frequented after the 
shows -- that she discovered folk music. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in my life, I heard the music of the people I came from," 
she said. "One of the things we read in our history books, when I was in 
grammar school, was that the slaves were singing all the time because they were 
happy, but the songs I heard debunked that theory. 
</P>
<P>
"And hearing this music made me feel proud. I straightened my back and kinked 
my hair, and from that point on I was determined to learn all there was to 
learn, not just about my black heritage, but about my American heritage." 
</P>
<P>
Odetta promptly left the "Finian's" chorus line and ventured out on her own. 
She made her debut as a solo folk singer in San Francisco's Hungry i, earning 
$25 a night; she subsequently hit the road, singing in folk clubs and 
coffeehouses up and down the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1950s, Odetta was touring nationwide and in Canada; she cut her 
first record, for San Francisco's Tradition label, in 1956. With the advent of 
the folk revival, she began getting plenty of national attention. 
</P>
<P>
Odetta performed at the Newport Folk Festival in 1959, 1960, 1964 and 1965 and 
released several albums on Vanguard Records, the home of fellow folkies such as 
Joan Baez, Doc Watson and the Jim Kweskin Jug Band. 
</P>
<P>
Odetta has since toured Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the West Indies 
and Northwest Africa and has recorded for independent folk labels. She's also 
made countless television appearances and popped up in several films -- 
including "Sanctuary" and the TV movie "The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman" 
-- in both singing and dramatic roles. 
</P>
<P>
She said she plans to continue doing plenty of benefit work for social and 
environmental organizations and causes. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to do that. I need to put something back into the pot; I need to be 
helpful and useful to those who are on the firing line with their energies 
focusing on areas that will improve the lives of more people in this country."

FACES . . . : MATLOCK'S RIGHT HAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's taken her a couple of seasons, but actress Nancy Stafford feels that her 
character, Michelle Thomas of NBC's "Matlock," has finally blossomed out from 
under the shadow of the formidable, but friendly, presence of actor Andy 
Griffith. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the character of Michelle Thomas has really grown. I've had a couple 
of cases thrown right into my lap this season. I hope I get to do more." 
</P>
<P>
"I think the most interesting thing about Michelle is you've gotten a chance to 
watch her progress as an attorney, from being Andy Griffith's assistant to 
being a full-blown peer and partner to him. The Ben Matlock character is 
beginning to rely on her a lot and I like that because that gives me more 
opportunities to do courtroom." The courtroom is no terra incognita to the 
former Miss Florida of 1976. Her brother was trained as an attorney and is now 
mayor of the Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., suburb of Wilton Manors, where Stafford grew 
up. 
</P>
<P>
"I spend a lot of time talking to my brother and also watching Andy. As I 
launched out to do my own courtroom stuff, I purposefully brought to it every 
now and then a little shade of Andy, as he's been my mentor. It's fun to bring 
him into the courtroom, to be sly like a fox as he is and establish my own 
style at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Stafford didn't actively pursue acting as a career, until it practically fell 
into her lap when there was an actor's strike in 1980. Up to that point she had 
pursued modeling and even had her own PR firm in Florida. But her beauty 
pageant work proved useful in getting her face known, and she landed five 
national commercials in one week. 
</P>
<P>
"Matlock" is the actress' third series (she was also in "Sidekicks" and "St. 
Elsewhere"). But surprisingly, it was Stafford's 1985 Disney Sunday Night movie 
"The Last Electric Knight" that really put her career in high gear. "I was 
among the first five actors the Disney team put together under studio contract, 
when Jeffrey Katzenberg and Michael Eisner first came on board. So they freeze 
the contract while I'm shooting 'Matlock,' then on hiatuses and such, I go 
under their umbrella. So, far, I've done nothing for them. 
</P>
<P>
"Matlock is a show of great integrity and shows people of high moral values. 
These people are committed to doing what is morally right. My long-term desire 
is to stay in this medium and become one of those people who can influence it 
for good." SUE MARTIN

As I watched the Academy Awards presentations last Monday, I learned something 
new about world geography. 
</P>
<P>
Presenter Arnold Schwarzenegger mentioned that Billy Crystal's ancestors came 
from Odessa, "Russia." Because I was born in Odessa in 1945, I quickly 
rechecked my birth certificate to see if some elves had changed the name of the 
country. What a relief it was to find out that Odessa is still a city in the 
Ukrainian Republic. Whew!

A couple of suggestions to Kim Basinger regarding her remarks about "Do the 
Right Thing" on the Oscar telecast: Consider the possibility that Spike Lee's 
movie was not one of the five best of 1989. Don't presume that the academy has 
a problem because it doesn't share your opinion.

Sound effects editors do more than just "gather" effects. Today's 
sound-conscious directors demand the "sound that no one has heard before." 
</P>
<P>
To service that demand, many sound editors have become sound designers, 
generating and pre-mixing special sound effects as well as supervising and 
organizing the thousands of "normal" effects. 
</P>
<P>
Some of our craftspeople, the Foley artists, perform sound effects, "live" to 
filmed picture on a specialized recording stage, and their contributions go 
unrecognized.

The results of the 62nd Academy Awards have convinced me that the academy 
places more value on harmless, sticky-sweet "fluff" movies ("Driving Miss

CAROL BURNETT'S COMEDY ANTHOLOGY BOWS ON NBC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Carol &amp; Company" is more mystery than comedy, the mystery being why she 
decided to do this series in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Before giving it a regular time slot at 10 p.m. on April 14, NBC is first 
testing the waters with special previews of "Carol &amp; Company" tonight and 
April 7 at 9:30 p.m. on Channels 4, 36 and 39. 
</P>
<P>
This is a comedy anthology performed in front of a studio audience, with 
Burnett starring in a different sketch (it's really more that than a teleplay) 
each week, supported by a regular company. 
</P>
<P>
"Carol &amp; Company" affirms that even someone as skilled at comedy as Burnett 
is only as good as her writers, and they let her down in the first two 
programs, which are dreadful. Tonight she plays a woman who hires a company 
from the Yellow Pages named Hit Parade Parties to murder her womanizing husband 
(Richard Kind). The hit man (Terry Kiser) turns out to be especially 
relentless. 
</P>
<P>
Next week Burnett plays a transsexual, a former high school 
quarterback-turned-female who jolts her old classmates at their 25th reunion. 
The most shocked is the former man's former girlfriend, a drunk played by 
Swoosie Kurtz. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's program is bad enough in being merely unfunny. Next week's is even 
worse, for in addition to being unfunny, it clumsily attempts to be poignant. 
</P>
<P>
Although it's hard measuring the abilities of a repertory company that's given 
such little script support, everyone knows what Burnett can do. But she's not 
given the chance to do it here. These are different times, and Burnett is an 
actress who apparently wants to pursue a different brand of comedy than "The 
Carol Burnett Show" that gave America such memorably funny sketches from 1967 
to 1979 on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
Just the same, when she's out there now, you somehow wish Harvey Korman, Tim 
Conway and Vicki Lawrence were with her. HOWARD ROSENBERG

'NEW VISIONS JAZZ' FEATURES BILL COSBY'S GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The latest edition of the "New Visions Jazz" series on VH-1, airing at 8 
tonight, is the first of two 55-minute segments devoted mainly to Bill Cosby's 
new venture as a jazz producer. 
</P>
<P>
With Ben Sidran as host, the program switches back and forth between 
performances by Cosby's group, a couple of Sidran-Cosby dialogues, and clips by 
other bands. 
</P>
<P>
Among the latter are a super-busy performance by Branford Marsalis, on soprano 
saxophone; Miles Davis, in a medley from his own "Tutu" album, and a very 
grainy black-and-white item by Duke Ellington playing "Perdido." 
</P>
<P>
Cosby's own musicians -- David Murray on tenor sax, Don Pullen on piano, Sonny 
Sharrock on guitar, Mark Egan on bass and Al Foster on drums -- play the Miles 
Davis standard "All Blues" and a long, single-chord vamp in G entitled 
"Ursalina." It's all strongly funk-oriented, the kind of music more likely to 
appeal to young listeners who are into R&amp;B than to older folks who 
regularly watch the Huxtables. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to acting as a sort of cheerleader, looking entranced, saying 
"Yeah!" and cuing the band to stop, Cosby talks about the intensity and emotion 
involved. Jazz, he says, is like comedy: Robin Williams and Eddie Murphy are 
"talking musicians." The analogy may be a little hard to follow, but Cosby is 
obviously sincere, and Sidran is duly deferential, comparing him to Miles 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
The best spoken moment is Cosby's opening greeting to the diminutive Sidran, to 
whom he says: "Hey, you're taller than I thought." Jazz may not be like comedy, 
but some jazz aficionados sure have a way with a quip. LEONARD FEATHER

TRIALS OF BRINGING UP A LOVE CHILD FROM VIETNAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the great curmudgeon lines, found in one of Joe Orton's plays, is that 
"no good deed goes unpunished." You're reminded of that while watching a 
determined ex-GI bring into his marriage an illegitimate Vietnamese daughter in 
"The Girl Who Came Between Them," Sunday night at 9 on Channels 4, 36 and 39. 
</P>
<P>
This fact-based drama, co-starring Cheryl Ladd and Anthony John Denison as the 
beleaguered married couple, dramatizes the struggle of a love child, an 
Amerasian girl (convincingly played by Melissa Chang) to adjust to life in 
America with her combat vet father and his increasingly threatened wife. 
</P>
<P>
The material is the kind of ripe drama that television movies gobble up. The 
trouble is that lovers from the world's front lines might have a twang of guilt 
recounting their own liaisons but not too many would want to change places with 
the father here, whose herculean efforts to do the right thing almost wrecks 
his life. 
</P>
<P>
Denison's character is representative of the young GI bedazzled by an Asian 
beauty and who ever after can't keep the woman out of his imagination. In this 
case, although she's supposedly dead, the poor fellow wills her back to life. 
That's just great for Ladd's staunch American wife, who's at first supportive 
and then begins to wonder who she's married to. Other twists render Audrey 
Davis Levin's script an arabesque of irony and poetic justice. 
</P>
<P>
Direction by Mel Damski is pedestrian and the story is slow to accelerate. But 
as a commentary on the residue of war and the melting culture pot that results, 
"The Girl Who Came Between Them" has the slap of credulity. RAY LOYND

DRUG REDUCES CRIPPLING FROM SPINAL INJURIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

WASHINGTON

<P>
Identifying the first treatment for acute spinal cord injury, federal health 
officials said Friday that patients who receive the drug methylprednisolone 
within eight hours of injury recover motor and sensory functions to a 
dramatically greater extent than other patients do. 
</P>
<P>
The drug, a steroid often used to treat symptoms of shock and to prevent 
swelling after strokes or surgery, appears to halt deterioration of spinal cord 
cells and tissue, according to study results announced by the National 
Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. 
</P>
<P>
Before the study, "the whole field (had) been absolutely dismal, with no hope 
of improving the fate of the patient," said Dr. Phanor L. Perot Jr., chairman 
of the department of surgery of the Yale University School of Medicine and one 
of the study researchers. "This study gives concrete proof . . . that we can 
stop the lethal process." 
</P>
<P>
The study results are to be published in the New England Journal of Medicine 
next month, but the researchers said they took the unusual step of announcing 
the findings in advance because of their "immediate effect on a major national 
public health problem that has been extraordinarily resistant to treatment." 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the degree of the initial injury, methylprednisolone could 
determine whether some patients will be wheelchair-bound, said Dr. Michael B. 
Bracken, professor of epidemiology and public health at the Yale medical school 
and the study coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
For most patients, however, administration of the drug will allow greater use 
of muscles or increased sensation that otherwise would be lost, Bracken said, 
speaking at a press conference sponsored by the national institute, which 
funded the study. 
</P>
<P>
In a quadriplegic, for example, the drug could mean "the return of function of 
a hand" or, in a paraplegic, "being able to stand, or move from a wheelchair to 
a chair or to a vehicle without help," where assistance would otherwise be 
needed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The improvement varies with the severity of the injury, "but all patients 
benefit," Bracken said. 
</P>
<P>
Because methylprednisolone was found to be effective only during the first 
eight hours after an injury, early treatment with the drug is critical, the 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
"Since 95% of patients with acute spinal cord injury are admitted to a hospital 
within eight hours, almost all of them could benefit from this therapy," 
Bracken said, adding that researchers hope the drug eventually will be 
administered by paramedics in ambulances or "at roadside, if possible." 
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 spinal cord injuries occur every year. Two-thirds involve people 
under the age of 30, and most result from automobile accidents, according to 
the institute. Survivors often are permanently disabled and face a lifetime of 
specialized care and rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
The cost to the federal government of such care and services now exceeds $4 
billion a year, the institute said. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, the spinal cord is not severed in an accident but is crushed or 
bruised, the institute said. In the hours following the injury, the body 
responds with a series of physiological changes that worsen the damage. 
</P>
<P>
First, the spinal cord swells, and the blood supply is reduced sharply in the 
damaged area, depriving cells of needed nutrients. As a result, nerve cells 
die, producing a gap in the cord, with scar tissue forming on either side of 
the gap. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, the higher the injury, the greater the disability, the institute 
said. For example, an injury to the cord at the neck level could affect both 
arms and legs, while a trauma at the chest level could affect the legs and 
lower part of the body. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1977, researchers at 10 medical centers, including UC San Diego and UC 
Davis, have been studying different drug regimens in an attempt to determine if 
any would improve long-term neurological recovery in patients with acute spinal 
cord injury. 
</P>
<P>
The study to be published next month compared 162 patients treated with 
methylprednisolone with 154 patients who received naloxone, another drug, and 
171 patients who received a placebo, or a medically worthless drug. Motor and 
sensory functions were evaluated on admission, again after six weeks and after 
six months. 
</P>
<P>
Patients who received methylprednisolone within eight hours showed "significant 
improvement" in both muscle function and pin prick and touch sensation, 
compared to the other groups at each assessment, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the recovery was sustained throughout the six-month period, they said. 
The drug was not effective when given more than eight hours after the injury. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers said they were still evaluating patients' progress after one year 
and could not comment on those results. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers said the drug dosage was important. The study used an initial 
intravenous infusion of 30 milligrams of the drug for every kilogram (about 2.2 
pounds) of patient weight, followed by an additional 5.4 milligrams of drug per 
kilogram of body weight every hour for the next 23 hours. 
</P>
<P>
The treatment costs about $300, which researchers described as "a very low 
price." 
</P>
<P>
The institute has established a toll-free number that physicians can call this 
weekend for additional information: 1-800-633-3425. Next week, calls will be 
taken at 301-496-5751 during regular business hours, the institute said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TREATING SPINAL CORD INJURIES 
</P>
<P>
Treating patients with the drug methylprednisolone within eight hours of damage 
to the spinal cord can significantly reduce subsequent disability, the New 
England Journal of Medicine will report. Highlights: 
</P>
<P>
Rate of occurrence: About 10,000 Americans each year suffer an acute spinal 
cord injury that causes paralysis. Most injuries occur in men under age 30 and 
most are caused by automobile accidents. 
</P>
<P>
How it works: The drug probably works by procecting spinal cord cells from 
disintegration known to occur in the hours following injury, and perhaps by 
improving blood flow to the area of injury. 
</P>
<P>
The cost: The drug costs about $300 to treat one patient 
</P>
<P>
The manufacturer: It is marketed by Elkins-Sinn Inc., a subsidary of American 
Home Products Co.'s A. H. Robins Co. unit.

THE KREMLIN WANTS COOPERATIVES TO JUMP-START THE ECONOMY. BUT THEIR OPERATORS

When Russian racketeers set fire to the cooperative restaurant Come and Taste 
one winter night because they had not received protection money, manager 
Anatoly A. Rutkovsky watched helplessly as flames gutted the building on Peace 
Avenue and melted nearby snowdrifts. But he vowed not to give up. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, when the government raised his restaurant taxes by 300%, 
Rutkovsky defiantly told friends that he still saw himself as riding the wave 
of a revolutionary future: among the first Soviet entrepreneurs to bravely push 
aside the tired ideas of communism and usher in a new era. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until he realized that many of his fellow countrymen think 
cooperative managers are evil opportunists -- and some even launched an effort 
to drive him out of business -- that Rutkovsky finally admitted defeat and laid 
plans to emigrate to the West. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union's cooperatives, once viewed as a key to jump-starting this 
superpower's astonishingly stagnant economy, have become the country's retail 
pariahs, targeted by criminal gangs and tax collectors and hated by the average 
citizen. 
</P>
<P>
Owned and managed by groups of businessmen rather than the state, cooperatives 
number about 195,000 nationwide, employing nearly 5 million people. But as many 
as half are seriously threatened with closure this year, according to 
businessmen's associations. More than 5,000 have closed in the last couple of 
months alone. 
</P>
<P>
The enterprises offer consumers the chance to purchase quality goods and 
services unavailable elsewhere, to eat tastier meals at restaurants offering 
quicker, friendlier service and even to use clean public pay-toilets that, 
unlike their state-run counterparts, have toilet paper and soap. 
</P>
<P>
So why aren't consumers thrilled? Why, in fact, is there such public loathing 
of cooperatives? 
</P>
<P>
Price shock is part of the reason -- cooperatives are not state-subsidized, so 
their goods are generally more expensive. But perhaps more important, there is 
a traditional distrust in the Soviet Union of anyone who makes a profit. 
Cooperative owners often take home four times or more the average monthly 
salary of about 250 rubles ($400 at the official exchange rate). 
</P>
<P>
Tanya Dodoleva, a 32-year-old Muscovite who works at a health retreat for 
government scientists, may be typical in her reaction to cooperatives. 
</P>
<P>
Window shopping with her daughter outside a cooperative clothing store in 
southeast Moscow, Dodoleva said that although the stylish blue-jean skirts and 
colorful spring dresses on display were unavailable in state stores, she still 
refused on principle to buy from the cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
"All these people are working for is their own pocketbook," she complained 
heatedly. "They don't care about the customer or quality of goods. And they 
have dealings with criminals." 
</P>
<P>
Even the Kremlin, which officially has backed cooperatives, suffers from 
diametrically opposed goals on the issue: President Mikhail S. Gorbachev wants 
them to help move the country toward a market economy, but at the same time, 
government practices appear aimed at preventing cooperatives from becoming too 
wealthy or powerful. 
</P>
<P>
Cooperative managers find they often must pay bribes to officials to get 
permits needed just to open their businesses -- and then they usually discover 
supplies are difficult to obtain through state-run channels. Further, since 
January cooperatives' pre-salary profits have been taxed as much as 75%. 
</P>
<P>
Rutkovsky of Come and Taste said both stifling government restrictions and open 
public enmity result from a philosophy of enforced economic equality that has 
been drilled into Soviets for decades. 
</P>
<P>
"Most revolutions may be intended to make the masses happy and wealthy, but 
ours 70 years ago was aimed primarily at idealizing poverty and making sure the 
masses never could get rich," he said, wearing a silver bracelet and 
chain-smoking imported Marlboros. 
</P>
<P>
"We Soviets have been taught that we should be happy with a red flag instead of 
meat. Even today, people who don't accept that, who want more for themselves, 
are viewed as greedy speculators," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Yakovlev, founder of the three-month-old independent Kommersant 
business newspaper, said public dislike of cooperatives also is caused partly 
by the fact that there has been no sustained history of economic competition in 
this country, so it is a concept few understand. 
</P>
<P>
"For nearly 70 years in the Soviet Union, all our goods were priced by the 
state. There was a chief upstairs who decided this cigarette lighter should 
cost 10 rubles and this pen should cost two rubles," Yakovlev said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, if someone sees this lighter on sale for 20 rubles, they don't understand 
production costs. They just think of this as the private decision of some guy 
sitting in a room somewhere, and they respond angrily." 
</P>
<P>
At Come and Taste, angry Muscovites have begun to respond in an organized 
fashion. In the evenings they gather outside the restaurant or sometimes even 
come inside to curse at customers and try to disrupt business. Rutkovsky said 
the harassment is taking a big bite out of his income as well as his morale, 
cutting the restaurant's gross earnings by more than two- thirds. 
</P>
<P>
Undeniably, there is some basis for public distrust. 
</P>
<P>
Cooperative managers face serious difficulties in obtaining raw materials to 
run their shops and restaurants -- and many admit privately that they have been 
forced to turn to the black market to obtain needed goods. Sometimes the 
black-market goods have been illegally taken from state stores, resulting in 
worsened consumer shortages there. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we cannot buy food from the state stores, but that's not all we 
cannot buy," explained Boris Uryanov, manager of the successful Moscow 
cooperative restaurant Lasagne, which accepts only foreign currency and where, 
therefore, virtually all the customers are foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
"The state won't even contract with us to sell napkins, plates, silverware," he 
said. "We are forced to find alternative sources for these basics." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, many cooperatives -- perhaps as many as 80% of those in Moscow, 
according to one official estimate -- have some dealings with organized crime, 
usually involving the payment of protection money. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the realities of the life in which these people are trying to create 
a business, so there is no choice but to be pragmatic," newspaper manager 
Yakovlev said. "We can argue ethics all day, but the truth is, it is impossible 
to create a business based on a fantasy world." 
</P>
<P>
Yuri A. Tumensev, a manager of the ABC cooperative shop, which sells crafts and 
clothing, smiled when asked about whether his shop dealt with the Russian 
Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
"With the racketeers, all is in order," he replied. He then denied he was 
paying protection money to the mob. But when asked about ABC's security system, 
he smiled again and said: "That's our little secret." 
</P>
<P>
Under a new law, taxes at Tumensev's shop were supposed to increase from 5% of 
the pre-salary profit to 75% last Jan. 1. But because the store had donated 
money to city charities, it received permission to delay implementation of the 
full tax hike. 
</P>
<P>
Is that bribery? No, Tumensev declares, simply pragmatism. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the store is required to pay 37% of its pre-salary profit in taxes and has 
been warned the rate will increase to the full 75% within six months. So, as of 
Sunday, ABC is laying off half of its 30 permanent employees, and Tumensev and 
the three other managers are cutting their salaries from 3,000 rubles ($4,800) 
per month to 1,000 ($1,600). 
</P>
<P>
The planned tax hike was particularly dramatic in the case of ABC because it is 
a retail store, buying goods from producers and then selling them to consumers 
for a profit -- typical for Western stores but branded "speculation" in the 
Soviet Union and illegal until the Gorbachev era. 
</P>
<P>
"In other countries, this is normal business, but not for us," Tumensev said. 
"When we first opened our doors, we heard passers-by saying, 'You speculators 
should be shot. It's a pity Stalin is not ruling the country, because then you 
would get the punishment you deserve.' " 
</P>
<P>
Aversion to cooperative owners -- because they make a profit, because their 
goods are often more expensive than state stores and because they are perceived 
as being involved in illegal dealings -- clearly extends all the way up to the 
top reaches of the government, he charged. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is aimed at restraining the successful cooperatives," he said. "If 
that doesn't change, starting a cooperative won't be worth the risk and our 
store will close its doors. And that, whether or not people realize it now, 
would be a loss for the Soviet consumer."

RATIONING OF WATER LIKELY, BRADLEY WARNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Facing a fourth year of drought, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley on Friday vowed 
to seek mandatory water rationing within 60 days if consumption is not 
voluntarily reduced by 10% during the next month. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to start today, right now," Bradley told reporters at a City Hall 
news conference. "If we do not achieve the level of conservation that we need . 
. . we're going to have to move immediately for the mandatory program." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's ultimatum came as the Department of Water and Power released the 
results of its latest monthly survey of winter snowfall that DWP Assistant 
General Manager James Wickser said was "regrettably, even worse than we 
thought." 
</P>
<P>
The DWP study showed that snowpack in the Eastern Sierra Nevada, the primary 
source of the city's main water supply, is just about half of normal. Runoff in 
the critical April-to-September dry season is projected at just 48% of normal. 
For the fiscal year running from April, 1990, through March, 1991, water runoff 
is expected to be no better than 55% of normal. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly are running out of water . . . very definitely," said Wickser. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's action is the strongest response yet from a large Southern 
California city to projections that the region's water supply will fall 12% 
short of demand this year. 
</P>
<P>
The giant Metropolitan Water District, which provides about 60% of all water 
consumed in the six-county region, has called on cities to adopt mandatory 
conservation laws, but has stopped short of asking for immediate rationing. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Boronkay, general manager of the MWD, said Friday he was pleased with the 
mayor's call for conservation and the approach of asking for cooperation before 
mandating behavior. "We're going to get it done, step by step," said Boronkay 
about cutting water demand. "If one step does not work, we'll keep pushing." 
</P>
<P>
In a separate development Friday, Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn 
said that he will propose at Tuesday's board meeting a mandatory water 
conservation ordinance that would apply to the 1 million residents of 
unincorporated parts of the county. The ordinance would include a $500 penalty 
for water waste such as hosing down of driveways and sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn said he wants the county counsel to look into the possibility of imposing 
a mandatory 10% water cutback. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to urging the public to cut its usage, Bradley asked the president 
of the Department of Water and Power to report to him within 30 days on the 
level of conservation. If rationing is deemed necessary to reduce consumption, 
the mayor said he would then ask the City Council to impose the restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Two key City Council members -- President John Ferraro and Commerce, Energy and 
Natural Resources Committee Chairwoman Joan Milke Flores -- appeared with the 
mayor on Friday, joining in his call for increased conservation and backing his 
threat to seek rationing. 
</P>
<P>
"I urge those who live and work in the city of Los Angeles to pay close 
attention to our message today: don't waste water, conserve," Ferraro said. 
</P>
<P>
"If everyone begins conserving water, we can forestall mandatory water 
curtailment," Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the call for voluntary measures, Bradley said it is likely that 
rationing will be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year I initiated a voluntary plan for reduction of use of water by 10%. 
That's not going to do it," he said. "Its very likely that within the next 60 
days we will have . . . mandatory curtailment of water use." 
</P>
<P>
What was unclear was just how the mayor plans to measure the public's response. 
DWP officials said they were unsure whether consumption would be measured 
against usage in the comparable month a year ago, or in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Wickser said that city residents have already cut overall usage by about 4% in 
the last year. DWP officials said they were unsure if Bradley wanted an 
additional 10% cut in current usage or a total cut of 10% from historic levels. 
</P>
<P>
Valle Bunting, a spokeswoman in Bradley's office, said late Friday that the 
mayor could not be reached immediately for a clarification. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley did say in his letter to DWP President Rick Caruso that "We should make 
sure that customers who have voluntarily conserved at least 10% consistently 
during the past two years will not receive unfair treatment" and be asked to 
conserve still more. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley also directed Caruso to "take more aggressive steps to ensure that 
everyone gets the message.' 
</P>
<P>
One problem in gauging water usage is some of the biggest water users are city 
agencies, which do not get individualized bills. And DWP spokesman Ed 
Friedenberg said Friday that officials do not yet know how much water is 
consumed by city departments. "We're working on it," he said.

IDAHO'S ANDRUS VETOES STRICT ABORTION BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOUIS SAHAGUN; TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BOISE, Ida. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. Cecil D. Andrus vetoed the nation's most restrictive state abortion bill 
Friday, ending the possibility that the legislation would lead to a U.S. 
Supreme Court review of the 1973 decision giving women the right to the 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic governor, who has long opposed abortion, said he killed the bill 
because of concerns that its restrictions were too severe and that it would not 
withstand constitutional scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
"The bill is drawn so narrowly that it would punitively and without compassion 
further harm an Idaho woman who may find herself in the horrible, unthinkable 
position of confronting a pregnancy that resulted from rape or incest," Andrus 
said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would have made abortion illegal except in cases of non-statutory rape 
reported within seven days, incest if the victim is under 18, severe fetal 
deformity or a threat to the mother's life. 
</P>
<P>
"What do we do in a circumstance in which a 12-year-old girl becomes pregnant 
as a result of incest?" Andrus asked. "If, for whatever reason, she does not or 
cannot report the identity of the perpetrator to the authorities, she will 
violate the law if she or her family cause the pregnancy to be terminated. 
</P>
<P>
"This law would demand that this 12-year-old girl, who has already been the 
victim of an unspeakable act, compound her tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, Andrus said, "I am advised by legal scholars of both political 
parties that, in their opinion, there is not the remotest chance of this 
legislation being found constitutional by the Supreme Court." 
</P>
<P>
The bill would have outlawed more than 90% of the 1,650 abortions currently 
performed each year in Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy the bill unleashed thrust this farming and cattle ranching 
community of 130,000 into an uncomfortable national spotlight. It also made the 
58-year-old governor and former secretary of Interior the center of the 
national abortion debate. 
</P>
<P>
Since the bill was passed eight days ago by the state Legislature, Andrus' 
office has received more than 20,000 telephone calls, letters and messages, 
including threats by abortion rights advocates to boycott Idaho's leading cash 
crop, potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
His decision triggered cheers and celebration in the streets among abortion 
rights groups who have held nightly candlelight vigils on the Idaho Capitol 
steps for the past week. 
</P>
<P>
"We are tremendously relieved and very grateful to the governor for subjecting 
this bill to very close scrutiny," said Sally Trott, a founder of Freedom Means 
Choice. 
</P>
<P>
"The Idaho veto is a stunning blow to the anti-abortion movement," said Molly 
Yard, president of the National Organization for Women in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The veto angered anti-abortion forces. 
</P>
<P>
"The pro-life people of Idaho did not lose today nearly as much as the unborn 
children of Idaho," Debbie Roper, a spokeswoman for Right to Life of Idaho, 
said, trying not to cry. "We regret deeply that the governor did not take 
advantage of an honest chance to review the bill on its merits." 
</P>
<P>
The Boise Republican who wrote the legislation, Sen. Roger B. Madsen, said: "It 
is a tremendous disappointment, but I'm not discouraged. If the governor is 
reelected and the majority of the senate is pro-life, of course I will try 
again." 
</P>
<P>
This year, however, the issue is dead. State legislators conceded that even if 
Andrus called the Legislature back into session, there would not be enough 
votes to override the veto. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation was specifically aimed at Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who is 
considered the court's swing vote on abortion. The other eight justices are 
thought to be evenly divided on the issue of overturning the 1973 decision, Roe 
vs. Wade. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, when the Supreme Court gave states more leeway to impose abortion 
restrictions in the case of Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services, O'Connor 
suggested the court's protection of legal abortion could be swept aside under 
the right circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
By shifting the legal burden to doctors who perform abortions, Madsen and his 
supporters hoped O'Connor would tip the balance in the court. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors performing abortions deemed illegal would have faced civil fines up to 
$10,000. They could also have been sued by someone having a legitimate interest 
in the pregnancy, including the father of a fetus or the parents of a minor 
child undergoing abortion. 
</P>
<P>
A woman who had an abortion would not have been punished unless she attempted 
to perform the procedure on herself. 
</P>
<P>
The veto reflects the new reality that surrounds the politics of the abortion 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
For the first 16 years after the landmark Roe vs. Wade decision made abortion 
legal throughout the nation, the issue was a relatively simple one for 
legislators in states such as Idaho, where abortion opponents are 
well-organized and powerful. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers could vote for sharp restrictions, even an outright ban on abortion, 
fully aware that the courts would strike these laws down. Thus, they could 
appease anti-abortion forces, without stirring up those who support legal 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
But with its Webster decision last summer, the conservative majority of the 
U.S. Supreme Court altered the political landscape. Suddenly, for the first 
time in almost two decades, state legislatures voting on the issue were playing 
for keeps. 
</P>
<P>
Until the Missouri decision, anti-abortion groups easily dominated the debate 
in many state legislatures. Now, with Roe vs. Wade in jeopardy, long-complacent 
abortion rights supporters have mobilized as well. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion rights advocates here wasted no time Friday in vowing to press their 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"They should never have shaken this cage," said Cynthia Brownsmith, a 
psychiatrist and spokeswoman for Freedom Means Choice. Referring to legislators 
who voted for the bill, she said: "We are going to get these jerks out of 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Sally Snodgrass, 53, a family counselor here, announced her candidacy for a 
state Senate seat at a boisterous Thursday night rally on the Idaho Capitol 
steps attended by more than 2,000 people clutching candles and placards. One of 
the placards read: "Welcome to Idaho -- Set Your Watches Back 100 Years." 
</P>
<P>
Snodgrass will campaign to defeat state Republican Sen. Rod Beck, whom she 
described as, "a man who has no sympathy or concern for families." 
</P>
<P>
Since the bill was passed in the Legislature eight days ago, Andrus has been a 
man under extraordinary pressure to act one way or the other. 
</P>
<P>
A great deal of the pressure came from out of state, which Andrus pointedly 
referred to Friday. 
</P>
<P>
His own reservations about the legislation "were shunted aside in the frenzy to 
pass a bill that, by the sponsors' own admission, was conceived outside of our 
state for the sole purpose of getting this issue back before the Supreme 
Court," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe, and I am confident the people of Idaho believe, that we can make 
our own judgments on this terribly important issue without outside pressure and 
outside influence or threats," Andrus said. 
</P>
<P>
One Andrus aide, who asked not to be identified, said that "last Sunday, Cecil 
was in his garden repairing a sprinkler head when a car screeched to a halt and 
a woman got out and said: 'Governor, while I have you here . . .. ' " 
</P>
<P>
Andrus, splattered with mud, laid down his shovel and listened patiently as the 
woman "gave him the benefit of her wisdom." 
</P>
<P>
In his office, Andrus has also listened carefully to a continuous stream of 
legal scholars and religious leaders. One of the scholars was Brigham Young 
University law professor Richard Wilkins, who opposes the Idaho bill and was 
instrumental in persuading the Utah Legislature to turn down a similar measure 
promoted by the National Right to Life Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to him for 30 minutes on Tuesday," Wilkins said. "I told him my 
bottom line on this statute is that it has problems. "The definitions of the 
exceptions are so rigid that they don't reflect medical or social realities."

LIBYAN PLANT MAY BE OPERATING, U.S. SAYS 
</P>

The U.S. government strongly suspects that Libya has resumed production of 
poison gas at its Rabta chemical plant, which was thought to have been 
destroyed by fire earlier this month, an Administration official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Two weeks ago, it was off our priority list," the official said. "Today it is 
back on our priority list -- up high." 
</P>
<P>
The official, who declined to be identified, said Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi 
may have staged the fire March 14 to divert international attention from the 
plant, which U.S. intelligence agencies believe was designed to produce nerve 
gas and mustard gas. Libya insists the facility produces pharmaceuticals. 
</P>
<P>
"We strongly suspect it is in production," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
The day after the fire, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler, reading 
a statement prepared by Administration analysts, said intelligence indicated 
that the plant had been destroyed and could not be reopened without extensive 
repairs. At the time, the U.S. government urged all industrialized nations to 
refuse to help Libya get the plant back on line. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, however, Tutwiler's deputy, Richard Boucher, said the Administration 
has reassessed the evidence and has determined that its earlier conclusion was 
far too optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. government is reviewing all available evidence related to the March 
14 events at Rabta," Boucher said. "Important uncertainties remain regarding 
both the cause and the extent of damage at Rabta. Therefore, no definitive 
conclusions have been reached. The possibility remains that Libya can still 
produce chemical warfare agents. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm aware of previous statements that I have made and others have made," he 
added. "I think all I can do at this point is offer you our best analysis and 
our best estimate, and that is the possibility remains that Libya can still 
produce chemical warfare agents." 
</P>
<P>
Boucher said the Administration was aware of commercial satellite photographs 
showing the plant to be essentially undamaged. But he declined to say how large 
a role the photos played in Washington's reassessment. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial satellite photos are not nearly as detailed as the pictures taken by 
government spy satellites. Although Boucher refused to discuss U.S. satellite 
operations, there can be no doubt that the Administration either has ordered 
new satellite photos of the Rabta plant or will soon do so. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, asked about the Rabta plant after a speech to 
the Assn. of American Publishers, said it is too early to determine that the 
plant is no longer a threat. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly would not say that we do not consider it a threat," Cheney said. 
"The plant's still there. It still has, presumably, some residual capability."

MANDELA-BUTHELEZI MEETING ON S. AFRICA'S 'ZULU WARS' CALLED OFF

<P>
Prospects for a speedy end to South Africa's "Zulu wars" dimmed Friday after 
nationalist leader Nelson R. Mandela called off a peace parley with his Zulu 
rival, Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi. 
</P>
<P>
The two black leaders had been scheduled to share a platform next week to try 
to stop the battles raging in Natal province between allies of Mandela's 
African National Congress (ANC) and Buthelezi's Zulu-based Inkatha movement. 
</P>

The weeklong conflict in Natal's townships forced thousands of people to flee 
and seek sanctuary in schools, hospitals and halls. 
</P>
<P>
After a six-hour meeting at Mandela's home in Soweto township outside 
Johannesburg, ANC officials said the meeting with Buthelezi had been postponed 
on the advice of Natal-based activists. 
</P>
<P>
"The atmosphere is not yet ideal for a joint rally in Natal," an ANC statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Police put the death toll from fighting in six black townships and surrounding 
countryside in the Edendale valley outside Natal's provincial capital of 
Pietermaritzburg at 37 since Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Natal's strife seriously threatens the initiative launched last month by 
President Frederik W. de Klerk who wants talks with black leaders on writing a 
new constitution. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk, alarmed that his proposed program of political reforms may be 
engulfed by the increasing violence, said the Natal conflict had reached 
unacceptable levels and his government might be forced to crack down. 
</P>
<P>
Zulu supporters of the leftist United Democratic Front, which is allied to the 
ANC, South Africa's biggest black opposition group, have been battling Inkatha 
for three years. 
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 people are estimated to have been killed in the feud between 
the two anti-apartheid factions, who disagree over ways to end Pretoria's white 
minority rule. 
</P>
<P>
The simmering unrest has now exploded into a virtual civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said large numbers of Zulus, armed with automatic weapons, spears and 
slashing knives called pangas, attacked each other Friday in the township of 
Imbali between Edendale and the white city of Pietermaritzburg.

A tentative cease-fire between rival Christian forces erupted into open 
warfare, leaving at least 30 people dead and 40 others wounded. 
</P>
<P>
A hail of shells pounded the Christian enclave in East Beirut and ignited a 
ring of fire in the fiercely contested mountains surrounding the Lebanese 
capital. A cease-fire had been in effect since early this month between Samir 
Geagea's Lebanese Forces and troops loyal to renegade Christian army leader 
Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun. He and Geagea have been locked in a bitter power 
struggle since Jan. 30 for control of Beirut's 310-square-mile Christian 
enclave. During that time, more than 800 people have died, most of them 
civilians.

A helicopter loaned to Peru by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration crashed 
near the city of Tingo Maria, injuring all five crew members, including three 
Americans, a U.S. Embassy spokesman said.

The chopper, a UHU-HC on loan to the Peruvian police, was reportedly flying in 
a formation of three when an engine lost power northeast of Lima. The spokesman 
did not identify the Americans -- the pilot, a medic and mechanic. The Peruvian 
co-pilot and gunner also were injured. The DEA is supporting Peru's fight 
against coca, used to produce cocaine.

Representatives of Guatemala's guerrilla alliance met with a 
government-approved commission Friday and signed an agreement to open 
negotiations toward ending the nation's 28-year-old civil war. 
</P>
<P>
The accord said the guerrillas and the commission agreed to ask the United 
Nations to monitor the peace process and act as a "guarantor of the fulfillment 
of the agreements and commitments." 
</P>
<P>
The head of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity rebel alliance, Luis 
Becker Guzman, also said the Guatemalan government had rejected an offer for an 
Easter truce.

The agreement calls for a second round of talks, tentatively scheduled for late 
May, between the rebels and Guatemala's political parties.

<P>
The delegations also agreed to direct talks among the rebels, the Guatemalan 
army and the government, but gave no date.

NICARAGUA: AN EARTHQUAKE AND AN INSURRECTION FORCED CHANGES ON THE CAPITAL.

Ask anyone in Managua for directions to "the little tree" and they will point 
confidently to a downtown intersection with a service station, Roco's Bar and 
the ruins of a two-story house, but no tree. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that the tree has been gone for 17 years, that when city workers dug 
it up to pave the streets after the earthquake it was no longer a little tree 
but a great big tree, an Indian laurel. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a point of reference," said Rene Cano, 66, who has run the service 
station for 30 years. "For everyone, this corner is the little tree." 
</P>
<P>
The invisible tree is the key to many Managua addresses, including Cano's -- 
"five blocks down from the little tree and one block to the lake." But Cano 
cannot fathom a stranger's interest in the tree and, furthermore, he considers 
it one more example of how little foreigners understand his country. 
</P>
<P>
Another example, he says, is the fact that multitudes of observers on hand for 
last month's presidential election failed to foresee the sweeping opposition 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to know the idiosyncrasies of the Nicaraguan people," Cano said. 
</P>
<P>
Right. Except that this is like trying to understand Managua, which is hurtling 
through change at lightning speed while holding onto its past by means of 
landmarks that ceased to exist long ago. 
</P>
<P>
The earthquake of Dec. 22, 1972, leveled Managua. Seven years later, the 
Sandinista guerrillas led a popular insurrection that brought down the 
dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza, and this was followed by the Contra civil 
war. 
</P>
<P>
After a decade of revolution and civil war, Nicaraguans booted the Sandinistas 
out of office in an election that was one of the Sandinistas' greatest 
achievements -- the first free and competitive election in the country's 
history. 
</P>
<P>
All those changes notwithstanding, younger generations still refer to Cano's 
corner as "where the tree used to be." They say it's down the street from Las 
Delicias del Volga, a cantina that is also gone. 
</P>
<P>
For 10 years, the Sandinistas' battle cry was "Free Fatherland or Death," and 
that is what they taught in Managua schools. Sandinista Youth spent their 
summers in the countryside picking coffee and teaching adults to read. 
</P>
<P>
Now, under the new government of the National Opposition Union (UNO), children 
are to learn that free enterprise is the law of the land. 
</P>
<P>
"The law of supply and demand is like the law of gravity," UNO leader Carlos 
Hurtado said in the flush of victory. "It is inexorable." 
</P>
<P>
But even gravity is sometimes different in Managua, where the four points of 
the compass are "up, down, to the lake and to the mountains." On any given 
block, up may be downhill, and the lake may be nowhere in sight. 
</P>
<P>
How is an outsider to understand this? 
</P>
<P>
Easy, says Maria Elena Castro, a resident of the neighborhood known as July 
19th: "Down is where the sun sets, and up is where it rises." 
</P>
<P>
After their triumph, the Sandinistas renamed many of Managua's streets and 
neighborhoods to honor the heroes, martyrs and battles of their uprising. July 
19th, for example, is the day they celebrate their rise to power. Under the 
Somozas, the July 19th neighborhood was called "The Redeemer." 
</P>
<P>
Those who oppose the Sandinistas have steadfastly refused to accept the new 
names, so that many places have two names. Castro calls the square in front of 
the crumbling Metropolitan Cathedral the Plaza of the Revolution, but her 
anti-Sandinista husband calls it the Plaza of the Republic. 
</P>
<P>
They both know what they are talking about. And by means of these labels, any 
Nicaraguan can identify which side of the political landscape they occupy. 
</P>
<P>
Castro wonders whether the new government will try to erase the Sandinista 
names. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they should stay the same," she said, "because this was a historic 
process. These people spilled their blood, and that cannot be in vain." 
</P>
<P>
Her husband said, "I think they should go back to the way it was before the 
revolution." 
</P>
<P>
Before the revolution, Managua had the Anastasio Somoza Garcia National 
Baseball Stadium, named for Somoza's father. The Sandinistas renamed the 
stadium after Rigoberto Lopez Perez, a tailor and poet who assassinated Somoza 
Garcia and was killed in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Names, according to the opposition's premier poet, Pablo Antonio Cuadra, are 
not all that important, but monuments are. The government of President-elect 
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro plans to build two monuments, Cuadra said, one to 
Gen. Augusto Cesar Sandino, who fought off a U.S. Marine occupation of 
Nicaragua in the 1920s and 1930s, and another to poet Ruben Dario. They are 
Nicaragua's political and cultural heroes. 
</P>
<P>
Although they take their name from Sandino, the Sandinistas never put up a 
statue of him, Cuadra noted. Instead, they erected a towering statue of a 
muscular worker raising an AK-47 rifle overhead. The opposition refers to it 
disparagingly as "the hulk." Even Sandinistas privately malign the oeuvre that 
they feel obliged to defend in public. 
</P>
<P>
"That statue should remain as a monument to July 19th," Cuadra said. "The less 
a civilization tears down its statues, the more it advances. If people always 
took down their monuments, you'd never have a Paris or a Salamanca." 
</P>
<P>
Cuadra does not pretend to compare Managua to Paris, calling Managua "the 
ugliest city in the world . . . a volcano with a black hole in the middle." 
</P>
<P>
Definitely, the city is diffuse, divided by blocks of overgrown lots and the 
rubble of buildings that crumbled in the earthquake. Every lamppost and wall is 
a chaos of political graffiti and campaign banners. Thin palm trees bend and 
whip in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
The new government, Cuadra says, must call an urgent meeting of builders, urban 
planners and seismologists to construct a post-earthquake, post-revolutionary 
Managua. 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot govern from a disperse city that is without syntax," he said, with 
distaste. "You end up with disperse, dehumanizing politics. It leads to mental 
disorganization." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there is a maddening quality to Managua. Streets that are paved are 
potholed; the rest are dirt. Water is scarce and electric power is erratic, as 
is the telephone system. But the inconveniences are tempered by the character 
of the Nicaraguans. 
</P>
<P>
Most Managuans are poor. Men push carts, and horses pull them. As in any Latin 
American city, a gaggle of little boys surrounds any car stopped at a traffic 
light. They reach in with long and grubby arms, not to steal a purse but for 
the thrill of sounding the horn. 
</P>
<P>
In neighborhood after neighborhood, Managuans gather at the end of the day in 
the living rooms and on the front porches of their one-story houses. In 
high-back rockers called "little grandmothers" they debate television soap 
operas and national politics with equal fervor. 
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguans do not always tell outsiders exactly what they think -- as in whom 
they think they will vote for. But the language they use can serve as a guide 
to their politics. 
</P>
<P>
Sandinistas frequently use the word companero -- companion -- an affectionate 
term for anyone from a lover to an army buddy to a waiter in a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition, on the other hand, is enamored of the word fanatic, by which 
they mean Sandinista, and for which they have created a verb, to fanaticize, 
which is what they insist the Sandinistas have done to Nicaragua's youth. 
</P>
<P>
Sandinistas call the opposition burgueses -- bourgeoisie. They prefer army 
fatigues and tropical guayabera shirts, but Chamorro's American-educated 
preppie crowd is expected to bring back the suit and tie. Already, upper-class 
women are chattering about the floor-length dresses they will wear to the 
inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
Few Nicaraguans are willing to predict what other changes the new government 
will bring. Businessman Pablo Vijil hopes to lure a pizza chain to Managua. The 
elimination of a U.S. trade embargo lifts an economic cloud from Managua, but 
Vijil is not expecting a flood of new investment. 
</P>
<P>
"Expectations will not necessarily coincide with reality," he said. "There are 
many unknowns."

STATE DEPT. SEEKS TO BLUNT ATTACKS ON IRAQ

Despite the seizure of nuclear weapons triggers from a plane bound for Baghdad, 
the State Department is trying to minimize damage to the U.S.-Iraq relationship 
by toning down official government criticism of President Saddam Hussein's 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon official said Friday that the State Department -- alone among U.S. 
agencies -- opposed the elaborate sting that resulted in the arrest of four 
Iraqis and the export manager of a London company on charges of trying to 
smuggle 40 of the devices to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The official said State Department representatives wanted to work quietly to 
discourage Iraq from trying to produce nuclear weapons without creating a 
public furor by allowing the Iraqi representatives to buy the devices and then 
arresting them. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the State Department recently pressured the Voice of America to tone 
down a broadcast editorial accusing Hussein of using police-state methods to 
defend his regime. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the U.S. Information Agency, the VOA's parent organization, 
said that John Kelly, assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern and South 
Asian affairs, complained about the editorial during a State Department staff 
meeting. The spokesman said the USIA representative at the meeting promised to 
look into the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided we were not happy with the editorial," the spokesman said. He said 
that the order to avoid similar editorials in the future was made by the USIA, 
a branch of the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
A State Department official confirmed that Hussein was "upset with something 
said in a VOA editorial." He said the matter was handled by the U.S. ambassador 
in Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
The official said the first rule of diplomacy is to avoid needless friction and 
that Iraq is being treated no differently than any other country. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not the State Department way to do our finger-pointing in public, except 
for countries like Libya and Iran that have track records of targeting American 
interests abroad," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, other U.S. agencies seem less reticent about criticizing Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney cited Iraq's nuclear program Friday 
as a reason to continue the "Star Wars" missile defense plan despite warming 
U.S.-Soviet relations. 
</P>
<P>
"Just this week, we witnessed Iraq . . . trying to smuggle 40 detonation 
devices that would be used in a nuclear weapon," Cheney said in a speech to the 
Assn. of American Publishers. 
</P>
<P>
"While certainly today Iraq does not represent a threat directly to the United 
States, down the road there's every reason to expect any number of nations to 
have that (nuclear) capability," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he reasoned, the United States needs a missile defense system for 
protection against renegade nuclear powers, even if the danger of an attack by 
the Soviet Union is greatly reduced. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. relations with Iraq improved sharply during Baghdad's war with Iran. The 
U.S. government tilted toward Iraq in that conflict, primarily because American 
policy-makers believed that an Iranian victory would destabilize the entire 
Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government kept a tight lid on criticism of Iraq during the war to 
avoid damaging Baghdad's military effort.

<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, hungering for an image as a model Arab 
statesman, has reverted to characteristic belligerence as his autocratic regime 
has been caught in a maelstrom of international controversies. 
</P>
<P>
"Aggressions . . . conspiracies," he labeled this week's accusations that Iraqi 
agents were foiled in an attempt to smuggle U.S.-made nuclear-detonator devices 
to Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
"Lowly interference in our internal affairs," his government declared two weeks 
ago of Britain's sharp denunciation of the Iraqi execution of a British 
reporter accused of spying. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein successfully rallied Arab support in rejecting Western outrage over the 
execution of Farzad Bazoft, a correspondent for the newspaper, The Observer, 
who was accused of trying to gather military intelligence for Britain and 
Israel. But the evidence was lost in a post-execution propaganda offensive 
designed to paint Britain as an oppressor of the Arab people. 
</P>
<P>
"The conviction is growing daily in the Arab world and internationally that 
Britain's rabid anti-Iraqi campaign is merely a new link in the chain of media 
and psychological pressure being exerted by Zionist circles and their followers 
to slander Iraq, its historic victory and its scientific advancement," said 
Al-Thawra, the newspaper of Hussein's ruling Baath Party. 
</P>
<P>
The "historic victory," Iraq's forced truce with non-Arab Iran in 1988 after 
eight years of warfare, is the cloak that Hussein has worn for the past two 
years as he reaches for respectability. Under the mantle of victor, he received 
a state visit from Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, an uneasy ally in the war. He then 
presided over the formation of the Arab Cooperation Council, an economic union 
joining Iraq with Egypt, Jordan and Yemen, taking his place with moderate Arab 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
At home, he poured borrowed billions into postwar reconstruction and put out 
bids to European governments and investors to help develop a modern economy. 
The Persian Gulf states and their Western supporters acknowledged, with some 
trepidation, that Iraq was the new kingpin of the oil-rich region. 
</P>
<P>
Portraits of Hussein wearing Arab dress replaced the military images displayed 
during the Persian Gulf War. Genealogies surfaced in Iraq tracing the 
president's lineage back to the kings of Babylon, and even to Mohammed himself. 
On this historical footing, Hussein would be the man to make Iraq the epitome 
of a progressive Arab state. 
</P>
<P>
But even before the nuclear devices and Bazoft cases, the image began to go 
awry. The investments did not roll in. Iraq insisted on favorable terms and 
easy credits, while the Europeans -- including France, its major wartime 
supplier -- wanted some structure for paying off Iraq's massive foreign debts. 
</P>
<P>
Politically, the Arab Cooperation Council, which Hussein wanted as a vehicle 
for prominence, has become an organization of little action, and what profile 
it provides has been assumed by Hosni Mubarak, president of a resurgent Egypt, 
who did nothing for Hussein's esteem when Cairo resumed ties with Syria, 
Baghdad's longtime rival. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's deep military relationship with the Soviet Union has been shaken by the 
collapse of the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe, and Hussein backed the losing 
horse in Lebanon, supporting Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, the renegade Christian 
leader, who has now lost control over his own enclave. 
</P>
<P>
Hazem Saghiyeh, an Arab analyst writing in the London-based Lebanese daily 
Al-Hayat, wrote recently that the Iraqi leader had abandoned his ostensibly 
progressive view on women's rights and other social issues and turned back 
toward a repressive approach that had marked his police-state rule. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, Saghiyeh noted a recent dictate of Iraq's ruling Revolutionary 
Command Council saying Iraqi men would no longer face jail for killing close 
women relatives, or their lovers, for committing adultery. The ruling was 
portrayed, he noted, as a way of maintaining "moral standards," but one that 
might have been expected from Iran, the fundamentalist society over which 
Hussein claimed his "historic victory."

The man accused of torching an illegal Bronx social club was indicted on 178 
counts of murder, arson and other charges Friday in connection with the blaze 
that killed 87 people. 
</P>
<P>
A state grand jury indicted Julio Gonzalez on one count of second-degree murder 
and one count of murder in the commission of a felony for each person killed 
early last Sunday inside the Happy Land social club. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez was also indicted on two counts of arson and single counts of 
attempted murder and assault. He was not present when the indictment was 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez, 36, who is due back in court on April 12, could be sentenced to 2,000 
years in prison if convicted of all charges, Assistant Dist. Atty. Eric Warner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"No case is open and shut," Warner said. "We have a very good case. The 
evidence is strong." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez chose not to testify at the grand jury hearing, his attorney, Richard 
W. Berne, said. 
</P>
<P>
While the grand jury considered the charges, authorities released records 
indicating that one of the club's landlords had been contacted by a fire 
department lieutenant eight months before the blaze and told that a vacate 
order was in effect against the building. 
</P>
<P>
Morris Jaffe, a partner in Little Peach Realty, responded that the problem 
"would be taken care of," according to a July 28, 1989, fire department 
document. 
</P>
<P>
After announcement of the indictment, Gonzalez, a Cuban immigrant, was returned 
to Bellevue Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Berne said he hoped to arrange a psychiatric examination for Gonzalez soon. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez, apparently enraged by an ex-girlfriend's rejection, allegedly spilled 
gasoline in the entrance to the Happy Land social club and set it ablaze, 
authorities said. Eighty-seven persons died inside the cramped club, which 
catered largely to immigrants from Honduras.

A mother bear and her cub were returned to their mountain home seven months 
after she suffered a 7,200-volt shock and burns as she fell, drugged by 
tranquilizer darts, from a utility pole in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Brown, a spokesman for the state Department of Game and Fish, said the 
release of the two bears went off without a hitch Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said the mother bear was fitted with a radio collar so biologists can 
monitor her for the next couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The mother bear had wandered into Albuquerque last August and climbed a 25-foot 
utility pole. When a wildlife official shot her with a tranquilizer gun, she 
fell, brushing a transformer, which caused the shock and burns.

DOCUMENTS: THE U.S. COMPTROLLER GENERAL SEEKS TO DISCOURAGE THE SCRAPPING OF 
SANCTIONS AGAINST EMPLOYERS WHO HIRE ILLEGAL ALIENS.

<P>
The director of the General Accounting Office on Friday discouraged Congress 
from lifting legal sanctions against employers who hire illegal aliens, calling 
instead for improved documents to help companies tell legal workers from 
illegal ones. 
</P>
<P>
Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher's testimony before the Senate Judiciary 
Committee came in response to a study by the GAO, the investigative arm of 
Congress, which charged that the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act has 
led to "widespread discrimination" against legal Latino, Asian and black job 
applicants. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), chairman of the panel's immigration 
subcommittee, has introduced legislation calling for repeal or reform of the 
law within 30 days. An identical measure has been filed in the House. 
</P>
<P>
However, Bowsher told the committee he blames most of the discrimination on 
"good-faith confusion on the part of the employer" about the law's 
requirements. The easy availability of counterfeit worker identification papers 
also is prompting employers to shy away from all foreign-born workers for fear 
of being penalized for hiring an illegal one. 
</P>
<P>
"Most (employers) are just very dubious of the multiple sets of documents that 
people can present to them," Bowsher said. 
</P>
<P>
He endorsed Immigration and Naturalization Service efforts to pare the variety 
of worker-authorization documents accepted to as few as two. He also spoke in 
favor of developing a uniform, "counterfeit-resistant" worker identification 
card that employers could trust. Either approach "could reduce the amount of 
discrimination," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A coalition of immigrant rights groups are seeking repeal of the employer 
sanctions. Those groups also are fighting any move toward what they call a 
"national identity card." 
</P>
<P>
Lucas Guttentag, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's immigration 
project, said even a voluntary form of such identification "could become a de 
facto minority identification card. The people who don't fit the stereotype of 
American would be forced to get that card." 
</P>
<P>
But Bowsher said identification documents are already a commonly accepted part 
of American life. 
</P>
<P>
"Ask people in L.A. when the last time was that they could cash a check without 
having to show their driver's license," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The congressional study, released Thursday and based on surveys of more than 
9,400 employers nationwide, found Los Angeles employers at or near the top in 
use of discriminatory practices compared to other large cities around the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
About 29% of Los Angeles employers were rejecting applicants on the basis of 
appearance or citizenship, 10% more than the national average, the study found. 
An estimated 16% were subjecting Latino and Asian applicants to special 
scrutiny, and 17% were only willing to hire U.S.-born workers. 
</P>
<P>
Bowsher and other GAO officials said employer education efforts should be 
intensified to combat such discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
In a survey last year, about 40% of employers "still said they didn't 
understand the specific document requirements. They didn't quite understand the 
specific hiring restrictions," said Richard Fogel, the GAO assistant 
comptroller general.

JUSTICES TO RULE BY SUMMER ON FLAG BURNING; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: REPUBLICANS HOPE THE TIMING WILL ENABLE THEM TO PUT THE ISSUE IN A 
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT BEFORE THE STATES THIS FALL. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court, in a victory for Republican political strategists, agreed 
Friday to rule by summer on a constitutional challenge to last year's anti-flag 
burning law. 
</P>
<P>
The law, engineered by congressional Democrats, was designed to remove the flag 
issue from the political arena and to head off steam for a constitutional 
amendment against burning the flag. Republican strategists, supported by 
President Bush, hoped to have a constitutional amendment before the voters this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on a motion by Bush Administration lawyers, the Supreme Court announced 
Friday that it will schedule a special session May 14 to hear arguments in the 
two pending flag-burning cases. This will allow the justices to decide the 
cases before their summer recess begins about July 1. 
</P>
<P>
If the high court -- as expected -- strikes down the Flag Protection Act of 
1989 by summer, Republicans in Congress say they will push through a 
constitutional amendment against flag burning and send the matter to the states 
by the fall. 
</P>
<P>
If the issue appears on the ballot, it could have an effect on other election 
contests, including state legislative races. Control of state legislatures will 
be crucial in redrawing political boundaries after this year's census. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, lawyers for the Democratic-controlled House and Senate filed a 
competing motion with the court asking the justices to follow their normal 
schedule on the flag case. Normally, the court allows 90 days for both sides to 
file briefs. This schedule would have put off arguments until the fall, with a 
decision coming after the November elections. 
</P>
<P>
Two federal judges have already struck down as unconstitutional the 1989 law, 
relying on principles established by last year's 5-4 ruling by the high court. 
</P>
<P>
But congressional defenders of the new federal law say it is significantly 
different from the Texas law struck down last year. That measure made it a 
crime for anyone to burn a flag in a way that gave "serious offense" to an 
onlooker. Since the act involved the receiving of a political message by a 
bystander, this amounted to an unconstitutional attack on a political 
expression, they say. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the new federal law is a ban on flag burning "in all 
circumstances." Therefore, they say it is a "neutral" measure intended to 
protect the "physical integrity of the flag," rather than to stifle political 
dissent. 
</P>
<P>
But the two judges who have considered the issue refused to buy this rationale. 
In Seattle and here in Washington, political dissidents publicly burned a flag 
as a challenge to the new law. They were quickly arrested, but were freed when 
the new law was struck down as a violation of their free-speech rights. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department appealed both cases to the Supreme Court. (U.S. vs. 
Eichman, 89-1433, and U.S. vs. Haggerty, 89-1434.)

Erie County officials, who earlier rejected a utility tax to fund mass transit,

County leaders said they saw no way to avoid a shutdown tonight of the bus and

A group of Vietnamese officials seeking private donations for orphanages 
visited the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on Friday, accompanied by a U.S. veteran 
of the Southeast Asian conflict. 
</P>
<P>
The visiting delegation was headed by Vu Khac Nhu, a representative of Hanoi's 
foreign ministry, and included Nguyen Van Chi, director of social welfare for 
Ho Chi Minh City. 
</P>
<P>
They were accompanied by Jan Scruggs, founder of the memorial; Ed Miles, who 
lost both legs in the war, and Cherie Clark, secretary of the International 
Mission of Hope, which sponsored the Vietnamese visitors' trip to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, a resident of Denver, was scheduled to meet today with a State 
Department official to discuss efforts to raise private funds in the United 
States for Vietnam's services for children. 
</P>
<P>
"We are promoting private humanitarian aid for Vietnam," one U.S. official 
said. "The Vietnamese government is cooperating with us on issues such as 
emigration and the repatriation of the remains of U.S. servicemen." 
</P>
<P>
The United States still does not recognize the Hanoi regime, however, and the 
official said there has been no proposal to provide U.S. government aid to 
Vietnam.

NEW YORK OFFICIALS BATTLE OLD FOE -- THE BUDGET; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: STATE LEADERS ARE STRUGGLING WITH AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AND A DROP IN 
BOND RATINGS. ELECTION-YEAR STRATEGIES ADD FUEL TO THE FIRE. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again, New York is facing troubled financial times. The lights are burning 
past midnight in the state capital of Albany as legislators struggle to forge a 
new budget. The bond rating services are critical, and residents are unhappy at 
the thought of even more taxes. Political reputations in an election year are 
on the griddle. 
</P>
<P>
After almost a decade of growth, New York state and its largest city have 
joined the rest of the Northeast in an economic downturn. The gap in the 
state's budget is estimated to be $1.5 billion, and the potential shortfall in 
New York City's budget is $1.7 billion. Both budgets are intertwined not only 
monetarily, but politically. 
</P>
<P>
"The state is beginning to exhibit the same kinds of problems the city had in 
the '70s -- political gridlock, a continuing inability to bring deficits into 
line and an accumulated past deficit of short-term borrowing that has to be 
rolled over each year," said financier Felix G. Rohatyn, a principal architect 
of reform when New York City teetered on the brink of bankruptcy more than a 
decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
Making it worse is "a consistently weak economic climate," Rohatyn said, 
whereas a decade ago the city and state where not in the fiscal soup at the 
same time. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, problems pale in comparison to New York City's dark days of the 
mid-1970s. Then it was uncertain whether workers would be paid. Municipal 
accounting was so bad it took months to merely grasp the dimensions of the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government hesitated on whether to guarantee loans to the city, 
promoting the classic tabloid headline: "Ford to City: Drop Dead." President 
Gerald R. Ford eventually relented and guaranteed the loans. 
</P>
<P>
The current situation "is a very serious problem," said Raymond D. Horton, a 
professor at Columbia University's Graduate School of Business, but "it does 
not meet the criteria of crisis" as defined in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"The question then was whether the city was going to go belly up. . . . It was 
so bad the budget couldn't be balanced for six years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Horton and others worry about a significant difference between 
then and now. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a much larger number of New Yorkers who are in the middle of one or 
another kind of social welfare crisis," Horton said. "That is where you can use 
the word crisis. The numbers of impoverished New Yorkers are much higher than 
in the mid-'70s. There are many more New Yorkers living without housing, there 
are many more New Yorkers dying of AIDS, addicted to crack. That is where the 
crisis is." 
</P>
<P>
Underscoring the present situation, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. dropped New 
York state's credit rating by two notches on Monday to the lowest point in its 
history. Only Massachusetts and Louisiana now have lower credit ratings than 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
Standard &amp; Poor's action caught Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and legislative leaders 
by surprise. Aides to the governor, who is expected to announce that he will 
seek a third term in office, said the rating service had promised to suspend 
its judgment until the state's new budget was completed, hopefully within the 
next several days. 
</P>
<P>
In reducing the state's long-term credit rating to A (the fifth highest 
available), Standard &amp; Poor's criticized the state for running operating 
deficits for three years in a row and chastised those involved in the 
budget-making process for being unable to forge a credible plan to close the 
$1.5-billion budget gap this year. 
</P>
<P>
The rating service's action has both spurred political blame and accelerated 
budget negotiations in Albany. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Cuomo and Republican leaders (who insist the gap be bridged by spending 
cuts alone) have agreed on reductions totaling $500 million out of the 
$51.4-billion budget. The cuts are across the board, with the sharpest slashes 
in welfare programs, health programs and mental health services. More than 600 
state employees would be dismissed, and 2,500 workers would be offered early 
retirement (out of a work force of 200,000). 
</P>
<P>
The budget cuts agreed upon so far will mean a decrease of at least $104 
million in state aid to New York City. 
</P>
<P>
The deadline for the state's budget to be adopted is Sunday, although 
negotiations often have stretched a few days past the April 1 goal. New York 
City must adopt its 1990-91 budget by July 1. 
</P>
<P>
In an election year, the issue of taxes is the most politically sensitive. New 
York state is in the fourth year of a five-year tax cut program, and 
politicians of both parties are loathe to cancel the savings. 
</P>
<P>
Partisan agendas abound in the budget struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans, perhaps with White House encouragement, hope to diminish Cuomo's 
popularity by pinning the reduction in the state's credit rating on the 
Democratic governor. In turn, Cuomo has sought to picture the GOP-controlled 
New York state Senate as stubbornly refusing to heed his predictions of 
shortfalls and ignoring his proposals for new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the governor's advisers believe Republicans in Albany relish New York 
state's problems as a means of embarrassing Cuomo, who could be a presidential 
candidate in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic problem is pure and simple -- politics," charged a key Cuomo 
strategist. "The GOP is trying to do, 'Read my lips,' " referring to President 
Bush's pledge of no federal tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a significant new voice has been added to the budgetary battle. 
New York state Comptroller Edward V. Regan has threatened to deny certification 
of the state's budget for the new fiscal year unless it is conservatively 
balanced with realistic estimates of revenues and expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
Regan, who issued early warnings about the state's fiscal plight, is demanding 
that tax increases be tied to major spending reductions. In the past, the 
comptroller's warnings often were ignored. But they are being taken more 
seriously this year. 
</P>
<P>
Regan has his own political agenda. Former New York City Council President 
Carol Bellamy is expected to mount a serious challenge to him as the Democratic 
Party's candidate for comptroller. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cuomo appears to be a heavy favorite to be reelected as no credible 
Republican gubernatorial candidate so far has emerged. 
</P>
<P>
The state is required to have its budget balanced in cash terms. But using 
generally accepted accounting principles, New York state has operated with an 
accumulated deficit that it rolls over from year to year. That deficit is 
expected to grow to $5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Cuomo has proposed selling 25-year state bonds to consolidate the entire 
accumulated deficit. That would provide savings through lower interest rates, 
but would require dedicated streams of revenue to reduce the debt.

Einwechter was not expected to live, Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple lived in Moreno Valley in neighboring Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
Family members told the Riverside Press Enterprise that the shootings occurred 
a day after Mrs. Einwechter told her husband she wanted a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Einwechter reportedly carried with her a restraining order barring her 
husband from coming within 100 yards of her. 
</P>
<P>
Einwechter allegedly was arguing with his wife in the cab of his pickup truck 
at 8:15 a.m. Thursday when he suddenly drove away from the parking lot at Riley 
Elementary School, Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple was later seen at several nearby locations, including a convenience 
market where Einwechter apparently took a handgun belonging to the market's 
owner, Bryant said.

ANTI-NUCLEAR PROTESTERS BLOCK HIGHWAY NEAR NEVADA TEST SITE; 69 ARE ARRESTED 
</P>

<P>
Sixty-nine anti-nuclear demonstrators, including many from Southern California, 
were taken into custody Friday when they blocked Interstate 95 near the Nevada 
underground nuclear test site. 
</P>
<P>
A Department of Energy spokesman said it was the first time protesters had 
blocked the interstate that skirts the edge of the 1,350-square-mile test site 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unusual and it's dangerous too," said department spokesman Derek 
Scammell, noting that drivers faced with the open stretch of highway often hit 
speeds of 70 m.p.h. "Out there in the desert, people put their foot on the 
pedal and go." 
</P>
<P>
Those taken into custody were booked on charges of being a public nuisance and 
released on their own recognizance. Authorities said they expect larger 
anti-nuclear protests today and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The springtime protests at the test site have become something of an annual 
event in Mercury, a small town 68 miles north of Las Vegas. This year the 
demonstrations are timed to coincide with spring break of college students and 
the Christian observance of Lent. 
</P>
<P>
This year's weekend of protests is expected to be smaller than those in earlier 
years, and authorities are keeping a lower profile in guarding the area. The 
1988 protest drew about 8,000 people, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
But some demonstrators say the blockade signals an increase in their level of 
intensity. "The ante goes up every year," said Chuck Rundgren, 41, an 
accountant from Laguna Niguel who was among those taken into custody.

NEW DIRECTOR OF COMMON CAUSE TARGETS VOTER APATHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California Common Cause, a key player in the drive for political ethics reform 
in the state for the past two decades, has a new executive director who said he 
intends to revitalize the 55,000-member organization at its grass roots. 
</P>
<P>
"We must do much more to rebuild the local chapters," said James R. Wheaton. 
"They are pretty moribund." He added that he hopes to expand the organization's 
appeal in minority communities. 
</P>
<P>
Wheaton, 32, who for the past four years has been supervising attorney of the 
Northern California office of the Center for Public Interest Law, has won a 
reputation as an articulate legal representative of Harvey Rosenfield's Voter 
Revolt organization in the struggle to implement Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he said, he will spend all of his time directing the state Common Cause 
organization, which is supporting one ethics initiative on the June primary 
election ballot and hopes that another it is backing will qualify for the 
November general election. 
</P>
<P>
Wheaton, in a Los Angeles interview, said that beyond these immediate 
priorities, his "huge goal" ultimately is to place Common Cause in the 
forefront of an attempt to reverse the tide of popular apathy that has seen 
voting in many of the nation's elections drop to new lows. 
</P>
<P>
"Given what's happening today in Eastern Europe, in South America, even what 
the students have been trying to do in China, the state of democracy in America 
is shameful," Wheaton said. 
</P>
<P>
"The congressional representatives and legislators have districts that have 
been turned into personal fiefdoms," he added. "Incumbents have guaranteed 
seats, and in many cases have forgotten -- in Washington or Sacramento -- about 
their home districts. Instead, they've become part of the club. 
</P>
<P>
"Special interests can block anything in the capital cities. Change has become 
impossible. And the result is that voter turnout is dismal. I wouldn't be 
surprised if only one in three or four voters shows up at the polls this year. 
If I had a huge goal, it is to try to turn that around." 
</P>
<P>
In attempting to do so, Wheaton said he will have a budget of $300,000 a year, 
with which he must maintain offices in Los Angeles, San Francisco and 
Sacramento employing a total staff of six. Wheaton said he is moving the state 
headquarters from Los Angeles to San Francisco, in part to save on soaring 
travel costs to Sacramento, where Common Cause does much lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
Wheaton's predecessor at Common Cause was Walter Zelman, who resigned to run 
for the Democratic nomination for state insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Wheaton is a native of Minnesota and a graduate of Brown University and the 
University of California's Boalt Hall law school. He is a past chairman and 
president of the National Public Interest Research Group in Washington and has 
been a volunteer writer, coordinator and treasurer for Friends of the Earth, 
the Sierra Club and Friends of the River. 
</P>
<P>
Although in the past he worked in a number of congressional campaigns, some 
Democratic and some Republican, as Common Cause director he said he will avoid 
such commitments. As a tax-exempt organization, Common Cause does not endorse 
candidates.

OAKLAND'S MAYOR OUTRAGED THAT ROTHENBERG IS IN TOWN

An outraged Mayor Lionel Wilson said Friday he was shocked to learn that 
Charles Rothenberg, who set his 6-year-old son on fire, has been paroled to his 
city and called for Gov. George Deukmejian to move Rothenberg elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Alameda County Supervisor Mary King also decried what she said is Rothenberg's 
"irrational lust for the spotlight" and said she would get others to put 
pressure on Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
"I was disappointingly surprised to find that this man is in our community," 
said Wilson, who said he first learned Rothenberg is living in Oakland from a 
story Friday in the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
"I am outraged and plan to contact the governor, both verbally and in writing, 
to get this man moved," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg splashed his son with kerosene and set him ablaze in 1983 in a 
twisted effort to hurt his ex-wife, who had threatened to withhold visitation 
rights. The boy suffered third-degree burns over 90% of his body and was left 
permanently disfigured. 
</P>
<P>
When Rothenberg was paroled from prison Jan. 24, his son said he feared that 
his father would hurt him again. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with The Times on Thursday, Rothenberg said he lives 
quietly in a "crummy" Oakland neighborhood infested by crack dealers and drug 
addicts day and night. 
</P>
<P>
He said he moves about the city freely and is not recognized on the streets. He 
wears an electronic surveillance anklet and is under round-the-clock guard by 
parole agents. 
</P>
<P>
"I can do pretty much what I want," he told The Times. "I'm just the 
most-watched man in America." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said Rothenberg's comments about Oakland reflect a lack of concern about 
his community. The mayor said he wants to make sure Oakland does not become a 
"dumping ground" for paroled convicts. 
</P>
<P>
King said she will meet with other supervisors and argue that they should ask 
Deukmejian to review Rothenberg's parole. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone who is capable of this sort of irrational lust for the spotlight might 
be likely to take steps to return to protective custody," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She described Rothenberg's interview with The Times as "a plea to be sent back 
to prison."

COALITION SAYS BORDER PATROL SWEEPS JEOPARDIZE COUNT; 
</P>
<P>
CENSUS: LATINO RIGHTS ACTIVISTS CALL FOR MORATORIUM ON SOUTHLAND RAIDS. BUT INS 
SAYS AGENTS HAVE JOB TO DO. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A national coalition of Latino rights activists on Friday called for a 
moratorium on sweeps by the U.S. Border Patrol, arguing that such actions 
jeopardize the accuracy of the U.S. Census Bureau's count. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to be sent this weekend to President Bush, the San Bernardino-based 
group Impacto-2000 contends that Border Patrol raids around the Southland 
hinder efforts to persuade legal and illegal immigrants to take part in the 
ongoing national tally. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of promoting confidence in the census process, these disruptive 
actions by the Border Patrol are fostering fear (and) skepticism and could very 
well produce another substantial undercount among immigrants," Armando Navarro, 
Impacto-2000's president, wrote in the letter asking Bush to halt the sweeps 
until April 15. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Navarro said "Gestapo-like tactics" used by the Border Patrol 
have "created a sense of fear and hysteria among Latinos," making many 
reluctant to obtain and fill out census forms. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service said federal 
agents will continue "to conduct enforcement activities, as we are required to 
by federal statute. 
</P>
<P>
"But we are going to be extremely sensitive and (limit) what type of publicity 
accompanies our actions," said Ron Rogers, a spokesman in the INS western 
regional office. "We don't want the public to sense that we're out there 
disrupting the census process." 
</P>
<P>
In San Bernardino, Navarro warned that an undercount of undocumented immigrants 
would shortchange areas with large Latino populations, both in terms of federal 
funding and political representation. High-profile Border Patrol raids, he 
said, "increase the distrust Latinos already feel for the government." 
</P>
<P>
John Reeder, the Census Bureau's regional director in Los Angeles, said the INS 
had previously agreed to "kind of low-key it" during the count. Indeed, new INS 
policy guidelines issued in mid-March require top-level agency clearance for 
non-criminal, high-visibility operations that might affect census 
participation. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the Hispanic community is concerned that enforcement activity will make 
undocumented people fearful," Reeder said. "If I were here illegally, I'm sure 
I'd probably feel that way too. But the INS has their job to do." 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, Impacto-2000 and another immigrant rights group said Friday that 
toll-free telephone lines set up for Latinos to order Spanish-language copies 
of the census questionnaire remain jammed. 
</P>
<P>
Census officials have increased the number of lines but concede that demand has 
exceeded capacity. Plans are under way to nearly double the 88 lines now 
operating nationwide, said Ken Riccini, a spokesman at census headquarters in 
Suitland, Md.

TURTLE FEVER; 
</P>
<P>
PREMIERE: PARENTS TAKE THEIR CHILDREN OUT OF SCHOOL EARLY TO ATTEND VENTURA 
COUNTY'S FIRST SCREENINGS OF "TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES."

Matt Geddes, 5, clutched a stuffed green turtle and bounced with anticipation 
Friday at the prospect of seeing his two favorite heroes, Raphael and 
Donatello. 
</P>
<P>
Hardly a precocious student of Italian Renaissance art, Matt is a Ninja Turtle 
fan who -- along with about two dozen other mostly preschool-age children -- 
showed up for the Ventura County premiere of the movie "Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtles." 
</P>
<P>
Matt's heroes, along with their half-shelled companions Leonardo and 
Michelangelo, are crime-fighting turtles, the subject of an enormously popular 
children's TV cartoon series, video games and a line of clothing. 
</P>
<P>
The Ninja Turtle movie had its first county showing at the Oaks Mall in 
Thousand Oaks Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"I just like them," Matt said as he waited to enter the theater. "I like them 
because they're good." 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura County, the Ninja Turtles are expected to be so popular that some 
parents said they took their children out of school early on Friday to beat the 
long lines anticipated at the three theaters where the film is playing. 
</P>
<P>
To the uninitiated, the appeal of the turtles may be elusive. Victims of a 
mysterious nuclear accident, the turtles take on human characteristics and 
learn martial arts from their spiritual leader, a human-sized rat named 
Splinter. 
</P>
<P>
In the movie, the fun-loving, pizza-eating green creatures live in the sewers 
beneath New York City, wield martial-arts weapons, perform acrobatic stunts and 
wage war against their sworn enemies, the evil underground organization The 
Foot, led by The Shredder. 
</P>
<P>
An implausible plot? 
</P>
<P>
Not to Ninja Turtle enthusiasts such as Chad Lundahl, 5, of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
"I love them whether they're a cartoon or a movie," Chad said. "I like 
Michelangelo because he talks like a surfer." 
</P>
<P>
Parent Connie Angove said she took her son, Wesley, 7, out of Little Oaks 
Elementary School early and brought him to the mall for an 11:45 showing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a family thing, and that's always worthwhile," Angove said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Mann Buenaventura Theater in Ventura, where the movie is showing more 
than 10 times a day on two screens, manager John Powers said the theater's 
first showing at 11:45 a.m. Friday sold out. 
</P>
<P>
At after-school showings Friday afternoon, children and parents were lined up 
outside the theater, and more than 100 advance tickets were sold for a 7:15 
p.m. showing. 
</P>
<P>
Some parents professed ignorance of the subterranean crime fighters. 
</P>
<P>
"My kids were discussing the names and I said, 'Who are these people?' " Fred 
Lewkowitz, a tourist from New York, said as he waited for his son, Sal, 8, to 
come out of the theater. 
</P>
<P>
Ninja Turtle fans wondered whether the movie would live up to the popular 
animated video features, such as "Turtles on the Half Shell." 
</P>
<P>
Christopher McLean, 5, gave the film a good review. 
</P>
<P>
"It was great," he said. "It was a wisecracking green team. My favorite is 
Leonardo. He was awesome." 
</P>
<P>
Parent Barbara Bojorquez predicted that her sons, Aaron, 7, and Danny, 5, would 
see the movie more than once. 
</P>
<P>
"If I didn't take them, they'd bug the life out of me. . . . I don't think this 
is going to be my last time here."

GROUP'S POLL SHOWS OPPOSITION TO TAYLOR RANCH CAMPUS; 
</P>
<P>
OPINION: A NON-SCIENTIFIC SURVEY BY FOES OF THE PROPOSED CAL STATE UNIVERSITY 
SITE FINDS 48% OF VENTURA RESIDENTS FAVOR ANOTHER LOCATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
As part of a campaign to block plans by Cal State University to build a new 
campus just outside Ventura, a group opposed to the controversial Taylor Ranch 
site announced Friday that a telephone poll of 4,100 residents shows strong 
support for building the campus somewhere else in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Bennett, a spokesman for a group called Voters for Alternate Sites, 
conceded that the telephone poll of Ventura residents conducted by his group 
was not a scientific sampling of community sentiment. But he said he believes 
it reflects the feelings of Ventura residents on the Taylor Ranch issue. 
</P>
<P>
According to Bennett, who was one of the leaders of the Alliance for Ventura's 
Future that helped elect three new slow-growth members to the Ventura City 
Council last year, the telephone poll showed that 48% of Ventura city residents 
oppose a university at Taylor Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 4,100 people contacted, 30% favored the site and 22% expressed no 
opinion, Bennett said. He said he plans to use the poll results to encourage 
Ventura City Council members to play a strong role in an environmental review 
reporting process now under way for a new Cal State site. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bennett called his telephone survey significant, the survey was 
dismissed by Cal State Vice Chancellor Jack Smart, who said there was 
insufficient information on how the survey was conducted and who did the 
telephone interviews. Smart noted that the survey conflicted with a poll 
conducted by The Times earlier this year on the same subject. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no comment on this poll, nor do I know how it was conducted nor much 
about the people who conducted it," Smart said. "We think the poll that was in 
the Los Angeles Times, a scientific poll as I understand it, is a good 
reflection of public opinion." 
</P>
<P>
The Times poll, which surveyed 818 county residents in January, found that 54% 
of those polled throughout the county supported the Taylor Ranch site. The poll 
was statistically significant with a margin of error of five percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 818 people surveyed in the Times poll, 197 were residents of the city of 
Ventura. In that group, 51% favored a university at Taylor Ranch, 41% voiced 
opposition and 8% had no opinion. The margin of error among Ventura city 
residents was seven percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
In the telephone survey conducted by the Voters for Alternate Sites, according 
to Bennett, members of his group identified themselves by name and then made 
the following statement: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm calling as part of a survey to find out if you prefer putting the new CSU 
campus at Taylor Ranch or if you prefer finding another site in the county." 
</P>
<P>
The telephone survey was conducted between March 3 and March 25 by 75 
volunteers from Voters For Alternate Sites, which Bennett described as a group 
of 100 people with no connection to the Alliance for Ventura's Future or 
Patagonia Inc., the Ventura company that has played a leading role in opposing 
the Taylor Ranch site. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett said the volunteers worked from a list of about 15,000 Ventura city 
residents who voted in the 1987 municipal or 1988 general elections. The 
Alliance for Ventura's Future used a similar list during last year's election, 
but Bennett said his new group paid $175 for its own list to avoid being linked 
to the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
The Taylor Ranch opponents will continue to poll Ventura residents, Bennett 
said. But he added that he does not know whether the group will survey all 
15,000 voters on its voter list. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bennett conceded that his telephone survey is not considered 
scientific or statistically accurate because it was not conducted according to 
prescribed procedures of professional pollsters, he stressed his belief in the 
results. 
</P>
<P>
"We think this clearly contradicts the proponents of Taylor Ranch who claim 
that the majority of this city is in favor of that site," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The director of the Los Angeles Times Poll, I.A. Lewis, said there is no way to 
determine the margin of error or degree of accuracy in a non-scientific poll. 
In addition, he said, there can be biases in the lists from which volunteers 
make their calls or in the manner in which questions are asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Just by the way you talk and ask a question, you can force an answer if you 
have an opinion as the questioner," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, who helped organize the Alliance for Ventura's Future, said there is 
no connection between the two groups. He said the Alternate Site group receives 
no funding from Patagonia and includes only three or four members who also 
participate in the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
Patagonia, which spent about $15,000 during last year's election for political 
mailings and advertising that opposed the Taylor Ranch site, would likely 
contribute to Bennett's group if it were asked for a donation, company 
spokesman Kevin Sweeney said. 
</P>
<P>
Sweeney said that no such request has been received and that Patagonia is 
deliberately keeping its distance from the Alternate Site group to avoid the 
appearance that it controls the group. He said, however, that the group does 
meet at Patagonia's corporate headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Tuttle, a Ventura councilman who has been among the most outspoken 
opponents of the Taylor Ranch site, said Friday that the results of the 
telephone survey were predictable. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew for a fact the residents of this city did not support a university at 
Taylor Ranch because I knocked on that many doors when I was running for 
council," he said of the 4,100 voters called. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett's group has called for the Ventura City Council to adopt a resolution 
seeking an official role in the environmental-impact review writing process, 
which would include evaluating other potential sites for a new campus. Tuttle 
said he expects that resolution to come before the City Council on April 9. 
</P>
<P>
But both Tuttle's opposition to Taylor Ranch and the telephone survey by the 
Alternate Site group drew an angry reaction Friday from Councilman Jim Monahan, 
who supports a new campus at Taylor Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"Where were these Alternate Site people five years ago when we looked at 27 
sites?" Monahan asked. "The Cal State people have already spent too much money. 
It's the people of Ventura who are going to lose." 
</P>
<P>
Monahan said he would not support a resolution to ask for an official city role 
in overseeing the environmental-impact report process. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that's appropriate," he said. "We don't do that for anyone else. 
I think Mr. Tuttle is just inexperienced and he just doesn't understand the 
system, the process of city government." 
</P>
<P>
Cal State officials said the telephone survey's results do not affect plans by 
the university system to move ahead with the environmental-impact report on the 
Taylor Ranch campus, which would ultimately serve from 12,000 to 15,000 
students when it reaches capacity in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Smart said, a new countywide advisory committee that is now being 
formed to oversee the environmental review process will negate the need for a 
direct role by the City Council. Letters of invitation to join the committee 
are to be sent out next week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives from all 10 cities in the county, the county itself, opposition 
leaders and proponents will be invited to sit on the committee, Smart said. 
</P>
<P>
"If it isn't just another booster club, I think that will be a step in the 
right direction," Tuttle said of the proposed advisory committee.

PEST ATTACKS DRY EUCALYPTUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A persistent pest that saps the life out of eucalyptus trees is becoming a 
major problem in Ventura County as the drought continues, tree experts say. 
</P>
<P>
The culprit's name is the longhorn borer beetle, and Jim Downer, a landscape 
adviser at the University of California Cooperative Extension, said this week 
it has chewed its way north from other parts of Southern California to kill the 
tall, sprawling trees in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all over the county," Downer said. "It started in Orange County, it's 
been wiping out trees in Los Angeles County, San Bernardino, San Diego, and 
it's now in Ventura and Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a natural pest of eucalyptus that has no natural enemy in California," 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
Though tree specialists say the beetle has been present in some parts of 
Ventura County, such as Simi Valley, for at least three years, it did not 
appear to be spreading rapidly. But the combination of ongoing drought and the 
beetle has been more deadly to eucalyptus over the last year, they say. The 
parasite was first reported in Southern California in 1984 in wood that had 
been shipped from Australia to an El Toro lumberyard. 
</P>
<P>
Downer, who has been monitoring the pest but says no count has been made of the 
number of eucalyptus trees killed, said he had come across more beetle-caused 
deaths of eucalyptus "in the last six months. 
</P>
<P>
"If it weren't for the drought, it probably would not be getting as many trees 
as it is," he said. "Trees that are experiencing drought intensifies the 
attraction of this beetle." 
</P>
<P>
When the weather gets hot, the beetle could kill more eucalyptus, said Jim 
Hughes, retail manager at Baron Brothers of Camarillo. "You don't see so much 
of it in cold weather, but as it warms up, you'll see it more." 
</P>
<P>
One recent morning, Don Schwabauer could see the effect of the pest in several 
places on the citrus ranch he operates in Moorpark. Almost every grove and 
pasture on the 700-acre ranch was bordered with towering rows of tall, 
gray-trunked eucalyptus. 
</P>
<P>
The trees are important both for erosion control and as a "windbreak," 
Schwabauer said, and the fact that several had been dying was troubling him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real concern," he said. "We get so much wind. We receive tremendous 
Santa Anas. They protect the citrus trees." 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "We've lost quite a few." 
</P>
<P>
Looking at his trees, Schwabauer said, he was convinced that the beetles 
focused on trees that lacked water. He pointed to one nearby stretch of several 
dozen trees standing like tall sentinels beside a grove of short, bushy orange 
trees laden with fruit. "Those trees look fine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But they stood next to a well-irrigated grove, he noted, and then pointed to 
another row of eucalyptus. This one stood between the road passing the property 
and an empty field of pale, dry earth. Nearly half of those trees were dead. 
</P>
<P>
"We pulled all this grove out because we'll be replanting lemons this month," 
Schwabauer said. "We aren't irrigating here, and those trees have the beetle." 
</P>
<P>
Downer drove to some places in Ojai on a recent afternoon where trees had been 
infected by the beetle. These trees were dead and had lost their color, but 
their leaves had remained on the branches. 
</P>
<P>
That is the signature of the longhorn borer, Downer said. "Usually when a tree 
declines, leaves fall. The main thing about the eucalyptus borer is that the 
leaves stay on the tree. They don't fall off." 
</P>
<P>
After a beetle lays eggs in a eucalyptus tree, Downer said, larvae hatch and 
then tunnel through the tree's cambium layer, between the bark and the wood, 
that carries essential nutrients and fluids up and down the tree. The larvae 
block that flow of nourishment, he added, killing parts or all of the tree. The 
larvae then bore into the trunk and after several days, emerge through what 
Downer called an "exit hole," as a beetle ready for a new attack. 
</P>
<P>
So far there is no known cure for the beetle. "Some pesticides have been tried, 
but they are not effective," Downer said. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Paine, an assistant professor of entomology at UC Riverside, said an effort 
in Riverside about two years ago to introduce wasps from Australia, which are 
natural predators against the longhorn borer, "did not appear to be 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
The best offense, Paine said, is adequate watering, even though that could be a 
problem in Ventura with increasing limitations on water usage. 
</P>
<P>
"Until we had the eucalyptus beetle in Southern California, people considered 
them naturally maintenance-free, and felt they didn't need to water them," 
Paine said. "Then people started to take care of them, and we don't see as much 
mortality in Orange County, San Diego and Los Angeles. This will probably be 
repeated in Ventura, now that it's moving its way north." 
</P>
<P>
Affected branches or dead trees need to be removed to keep the borer beetle 
from spreading, Jerry Revard, city of Ventura arborist, said. He removed a 
large branch that showed signs of the pest from a tree bordering the Santa 
Paula Freeway about eight months ago, he said, adding, "so far, I haven't seen 
any more." Revard said he encased the diseased branch in tarpaulin. 
</P>
<P>
"If people find evidence of the beetle, bury it, burn it or cover it up with 
tarpaulin for a year," he said, "to make sure they are trapped, to keep the 
population from spreading."

MINORITIES, WOMEN HIT CRA EXCLUSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the black owner of a small accounting firm, Deborah Morrisette could not 
compete for a financial services contract at the city-funded Crenshaw Shopping 
Plaza in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Although she ran her own company for the last decade, the 1988 bid required at 
least five years of experience in the specialized field of mall financing, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever (city officials) send me a bid, they disqualify me before I get in 
the door," Morrisette said, referring to requirements in city contracts that 
often favor large, established companies. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Morrisette was one of 250 minorities and women who attended a 
four-hour workshop at the Hyatt Wilshire Hotel to learn how to take advantage 
of business opportunities through the city's Community Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Like Morrisette, many of the participants shared stories of how they have been 
shut out of the city's contracting process. They described the frustration of 
repeatedly getting lost in bureaucratic red tape of well-meaning programs while 
politically influential minorities, such as Bishop H.H. Brookins, receive 
hundreds of thousands of dollars in city contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Morrisette called the city's minority and women business enterprise program 
"reprehensible," but said that she found the workshop helpful. 
</P>
<P>
Victor A. Muniz, president of an asbestos removal firm, said in an interview 
that he lost a convention center contract because his company could not afford 
the bond insurance. "We basically have been frozen out," he said. "If they 
don't change the policy, all these breakfasts and luncheons are window 
dressing." 
</P>
<P>
The workshop was initiated by Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), who 
said Friday that she "targeted" the CRA after fielding numerous complaints from 
minorities and women who felt they were being excluded from the agency's 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Waters bluntly listed those complaints for CRA administrators Friday: The 
agency only cares about developing downtown while ignoring depressed areas such 
as Watts. It financed construction of the nation's first enclosed shopping 
center in an inner-city community for builder Alexander Hagen, a white 
developer who was not required to share any of the construction project with 
minority firms. And the agency's business seems to go to major companies with 
political connections. 
</P>
<P>
But Waters also scolded the business leaders for not being persistent enough. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the greatest problem is you don't know how (the program) works," she 
said. "You are not smart. You've got to follow the money. No more complaining 
about how they gave the money away to Alexander Hagen. Let's pay attention. 
Let's understand the mayor's role and the City Council's role. If you don't 
know how it works, don't come to me." 
</P>
<P>
Friday's workshop was conducted to inform disadvantaged businesses how to 
obtain city contracts in construction, engineering, finance, law and other 
professional areas. 
</P>
<P>
The city's minority business program has come under fire recently after reports 
in The Times that lucrative contracts have been awarded to influential leaders 
instead of disadvantaged businesses as defined by the plan. In one case, a city 
audit found that a group of minority partners, including Brookins, the wife of 
House Ethics Committee Chairman Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles)and Los Angeles 
Urban League President John Mack, were paid $7.3 million in airport concessions 
contracts since 1985, though they did not invest their own money and did little 
or no work. 
</P>
<P>
Airport concessionaires told a City Council committee hearing Thursday that 
Brookins' interest in the partnership recently was bought out for an additional 
$130,000, and that the other minority partners now are actively participating 
in the business. 
</P>
<P>
The minority and women entrepreneurs who attended Friday's workshop were told 
by CRA official Freddi Condos that the agency awards "multimillion-dollar 
contracts and you should get a piece of the action. (But) we find that you 
don't know how to do business with us." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the business leaders said they already had submitted their names to 
city agencies and had been certified as disadvantaged businesses. They said the 
problem rests with a city bureaucracy that fails to address their needs. 
</P>
<P>
Grace Huth, who runs an import-export merchandise business, said she has tried 
for the last 12 years to land a concessions shop at the airport, but the city 
does not send her notices of bids. "There is nothing available," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Aleasta Newborn said her Computer Software Analysts Inc. has won aerospace 
contracts with major companies such as TRW and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
but can't break through the logjam at City Hall. "We have tried several 
departments," she said. "It's just as well you don't even bother." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Francis, owner of a small architectural and engineering firm, said he has 
been frustrated in his numerous attempts to get beyond a secretary or assistant 
at the CRA. "We're here to find out who these people are, just as Mr. Brookins 
and Mr. Hagen knew who the people to contact were," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Of 10 minorities and women interviewed at the seminar about their attempts to 
get city business, only one had been successful. 
</P>
<P>
Demille Jackson, 24, said his firm, Demille's Car Cleaners, won a $200,000 
contract to clean vehicles for the city's Department of Water and Power. Asked 
how he obtained the contract, Jackson said: "Prayer." 
</P>
<P>
Several entrepreneurs claimed that they have sought advice from the Mayor's 
Office of Small Business Assistance but were given no help. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried working with the mayor's office," said Bradford Boston, a college 
instructor who owns Renaissance Design Group, an advertising graphic design 
shop. "Nothing has ever been done." 
</P>
<P>
Morrisette, whose Panorama City accounting firm has five subcontracting 
employees and did $300,000 a year in gross billings, said that two members on 
the mayor's staff were unable to assist her on several matters. 
</P>
<P>
"They were useless," Morrisette said. "They had no expertise. They had no 
authority. They have nothing to say that we haven't already heard." 
</P>
<P>
Wilfred Marshall, the mayor's director of small business, told the workshop 
that his office has nine staffers who are available to help steer minorities 
and women to hundreds of contracts offered by 36 city agencies. But Marshall 
warned that some businesses have to push harder for the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are not willing to come in and spend the time to exploit the system, 
you will not get (city business)," he said.

CRA policies -- A headline in a Times story March 31 may have created the 
erroneous impression that accounting firm owner Deborah Morrisette had 
criticized the Community Redevelopment Agency during a workshop for minority- 
and women-owned businesses. Additionally, a sentence in the story implied that 
Morrisette was critical of practices that permitted Bishop H.H. Brookins and 
other influential members of minorities to get city contracts. Morrissette made 
no such statement regarding Brookins.

FAMILY WINS $2.4 MILLION IN SLAYING BY OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL McGRAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court jury Friday awarded $2.4 million to the family of 
a Muslim college student and father of four who was slain by a California 
Highway patrolman after a routine traffic stop. 
</P>
<P>
The jury, which deliberated for six days, awarded no punitive damages because 
it did not find malice on the part of Officer Bruce Moats, who shot motorist 
Yusuf Bilal three times in the back. 
</P>
<P>
"We can go on with our lives now," said Bilal's father, Jimmie Johnson, wiping 
tears from his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
As the verdicts were read, Bilal's brother, Robert Johnson, sat in Judge 
Stephen Lachs' courtroom and wrote down the financial information on a yellow 
legal pad. His dead brother's 4-year-old daughter sat on his lap. 
</P>
<P>
Johnnie Cochran Jr. and Eric Ferrer, the family's attorneys, said Friday they 
will ask the Los Angeles County district attorney's office to reopen a criminal 
investigation into the slaying and will ask the U.S. Justice Department to 
conduct an inquiry into whether Bilal's civil rights were violated. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, the district attorney's office declined to file criminal 
charges, saying there was insufficient evidence to prosecute Moats. The 
investigation concluded that the officer believed he was in serious personal 
danger when he fired at the motorist. 
</P>
<P>
California Assistant Atty. Gen. Thomas Blake, who defended Moats, said that he 
had not yet decided if the verdict will be appealed. 
</P>
<P>
"We are thankful that the jury found no malice on the part of Officer Moats," 
Blake said. 
</P>
<P>
Before going to trial, the family had turned down a $1.2-million cash 
settlement from the state. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his death in 1986, the 38-year-old Bilal was an RTD bus driver 
and Cal State Los Angeles graduate student who planned to open an Islamic 
textbook printing business. He was on his way home after noon prayers at a 
mosque when he ran a red light in South-Central Los Angeles and was pulled over 
by Moats. 
</P>
<P>
Moats, a 13-year CHP veteran who had never fired his handgun in the line of 
duty before, testified that Bilal refused to give his address and would not get 
out of the car. 
</P>
<P>
The officer also said Bilal swung at him, took away his baton and threatened to 
kill him as he got out of the car. Moats said he aimed at his chest, but the 
motorist spun around, taking bullets in the back. 
</P>
<P>
As Bilal lay dying, Moats stood nearby and was heard to say: "The stupid son of 
a bitch. All for a traffic ticket." 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, witnesses gave conflicting testimony. Some said Bilal's back 
was to the officer, others said he was sideways. Only Moats testified that he 
heard Bilal threaten to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
Two police consultants asked by the plaintiffs to review the case testified 
that the shooting was not justified. Another said that shooting was called for 
because, once Moats lost the baton, his only recourse to protect himself was 
his revolver. 
</P>
<P>
Jury members later said that it took them more than four days just to decide 
what a human life is worth. 
</P>
<P>
Cochran had asked them to award Bilal's family $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
During closing arguments, Cochran compared that figure to the recent 
acquisition by the Getty Museum of Van Gogh's painting "Irises," for $54 
million. "Would you quarrel with that amount (of money) for a human life . . . 
when you consider the price of the painting?"

ASIAN CAUSES ON SHORT END OF CHARITY GIFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN H. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While charitable interests such as United Way have begun more active courting 
of Los Angeles' ethnic communities, a new report has found that less than half 
of 1% of all donations from foundations and corporations in the region went to 
Asian causes. 
</P>
<P>
Given that Asian-Americans make up about 10% of the population in Los Angeles 
County and have become the county's fastest growing ethnic group, Asian 
community leaders met Friday to talk about becoming better charity recipients. 
</P>
<P>
"An initial reaction to the study might be: 'Japanese (Americans) don't need 
help,' " said Bill Watanabe, president of the Asian Pacific Planning Council, 
which issued the report. He said that the council represents about 50 agencies 
that serve the 10 major Asian Pacific communities in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The report stated that some Asian organizations are hampered by "the general 
fallacy" of Asians being a "model minority" with fewer problems than other 
ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem, Watanabe said, is that Asian organizations historically have 
had limited success in applying for grants. Many Asian groups, because they 
have few or no ties to foundations, he said, assume that they will not get 
grants. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not criticizing or pointing fingers at the major funders," Watanabe 
said at the meeting in Marina del Rey. "This study was done more in the spirit 
of asking ourselves, 'Are we doing things right?' and 'Where do we go from 
here?' We hope the donors are doing the same." 
</P>
<P>
The study, which examined the four-year period from 1984 through 1987, profiled 
corporations and foundations across the nation, as well as in Los Angeles. It 
included a look at the philanthropic powerhouse, United Way. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 360 charities funded by United Way in the Los Angeles-area, only eight 
were Asian American groups. And, even though United Way funding increased from 
about $200,000 in 1984 to $350,000 in 1988, the latest figure still represented 
only .6% of its total donations. This year, United Way raised nearly $95 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The percentages for all corporate and foundation donations to Asian agencies 
nationwide were similarly low, the report stated. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not, in any way, going to fool ourselves into thinking that the United 
Way network reaches all ethnic groups," said Leo Cornelius, president of the 
United Way of Greater Los Angeles. "All I can say is we are taking a look at 
what funding ought to be." 
</P>
<P>
He added, however, "In some fashion, ethnic communities benefit from United 
Way's agencies which address the issues that transcend any one community," such 
as the lack of AIDS treatment centers and child care. 
</P>
<P>
Cornelius, who was credited by Watanabe for initiating a "perestroika-type 
effort" within the United Way, said that a 2-year-long reassessment of the 
organization's priorities will end soon. 
</P>
<P>
The Asian-funding study concluded that agencies need to persist in applying for 
grants, thus giving donors the opportunity to learn more about the needs in the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"People giving out the grants would like to know who they are giving their 
money to," said Jack Shakely, president of the California Community Foundation, 
one of the state's largest philanthropic donors. "They are human beings, after 
all."

ARMED FAN BREAKS INTO SHARON GLESS VALLEY HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY and ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman described by police as an obsessed fan armed herself with a rifle and 
broke into an unoccupied Studio City house owned by actress Sharon Gless early 
Friday, barricading herself in a bathroom and threatening to kill herself for 
nearly seven hours before surrendering. 
</P>
<P>
Joni Leigh Penn, 30, of Garden Grove, who had been under a court order to stop 
harassing the former star of the "Cagney &amp; Lacey" television program, 
talked for hours with police negotiators about Gless and suicide before finally 
surrendering at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
She suffered a cut hand while breaking into the house but there were no other 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Police took a loaded semiautomatic rifle away from Penn and arrested her on 
suspicion of two counts of burglary, including an attempted break-in at the 
house three days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Penn was being held in lieu of $500,000 bail at the Sybil Brand Institute, 
where she will undergo a psychiatric evaluation, police said.

Penn had sent more than 100 "obsessive" letters to Gless during the last four 
years, Los Angeles Police Lt. Ron LaRue said. "She wanted to be near her." 
</P>
<P>
The letters and an earlier visit by Penn to the house caused Gless to seek a 
court order in 1988 to keep Penn away from her. 
</P>
<P>
Gless was not in the house Friday morning because she lives elsewhere in Los 
Angeles, police said. Her press agent, Heidi Schaeffer, said the Studio City 
house had only been used recently as an office by the actress. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Friday, the actress said: "These are horrendous times 
that we live in, especially when disturbed people have such easy access to 
weapons that can be used indiscriminately." 
</P>
<P>
Gless appealed to a state Senate subcommittee last year to approve a bill 
restricting the release of home addresses by the Department of Motor Vehicles. 
The legislation was prompted by the death of actress Rebecca Schaeffer, killed 
by a fan who had tracked her down at her West Hollywood apartment through DMV 
records. 
</P>
<P>
Saying that she had been harassed, Gless testified: "I would just like to go 
home and not be afraid." 
</P>
<P>
Penn broke into the house through a window about 3:15 a.m., triggering a silent 
burglar alarm that brought two LAPD patrol officers, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"They went into the home and they were confronted by the woman," Sgt. Richard 
Thomas said. "She pointed the gun at herself and threatened to kill herself. 
She then moved back into the bathroom and locked the door." 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Dan Watson said a Special Weapons and Tactics team was called to the 
scene and evacuated homes surrounding the secluded house at the end of a short 
cul-de-sac backing the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"We just heard this pounding on the door in the middle of the night and were 
told there was a crazy lady with a gun," neighbor Susan Cascio said. "It was 
scary." 
</P>
<P>
A specially trained police negotiator was brought in to talk to Penn. According 
to Watson, Penn objected that the negotiator was a man, and a woman negotiator, 
Officer Patricia Stark, was then brought to the house. 
</P>
<P>
"Throughout the night and the morning, she was talking about suicide," Watson 
said of Penn. 
</P>
<P>
While the standoff continued, scores of reporters and camera crews descended on 
the quiet, middle-class neighborhood. Vans and cars belonging to the media 
lined both sides of nearby Kling Street. Television transmitters were cranked 
into the sky so live reports could be sent to local stations. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the media stood along the street and set up camera tripods across a 
lawn near the house where Penn was barricaded. Television programs such as 
"Entertainment Tonight" and tabloid newspapers from as far as London dispatched 
camera crews to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The police and media vigil ended at 10 a.m. with Penn's surrender. A 
.22-caliber AT-22, with a clip containing 13 bullets, was confiscated. The 
rifle had been purchased at a store by Penn a year ago, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The restraining order was issued Nov. 16, 1988, three weeks after Penn 
allegedly visited the Studio City home and told a secretary she had a gun. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Kurt J. Lewin ordered Penn not to harass or 
annoy Gless and to stay at least 1,000 yards from Gless' residences. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Penn apparently continued to send letters to Gless but adhered to 
the order to stay away from her until this week. Detectives said Penn 
unsuccessfully attempted to break into the Studio City house early Tuesday 
morning but declined to say what evidence links her to the crime. 
</P>
<P>
Gless is a two-time Emmy winner for "Cagney &amp; Lacey." She also appeared in 
the "House Calls" television series and in several television movies. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Greg Braxton, Philipp Gollner and Steve Padilla contributed 
to this report.

OBSESSED FANS 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrities who have been victims of obsessed fans: 
</P>
<P>
Rebecca Schaeffer: A man who had sent several fan letters to Schaeffer was 
arrested last July after the actress was shot to death at her West Hollywood 
apartment. Robert John Bardo reportedly obtained Schaeffer's address from a 
Tucson private investigating firm, which obtained it from California Department 
of Motor Vehicle records. 
</P>
<P>
Theresa Saldana: A Scottish-born drifter who tried to kill Saldana outside her 
West Hollywood apartment in 1987 was charged last March with sending 
threatening letters to her from Vacaville state prison. Arthur Jackson would 
have been eligible for parole next month, but he will remain in custody until 
the new charges are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
David Letterman: A Crawford, Colo., woman, Margaret Ray, was arrested last 
March after twice breaking into Letterman's Connecticut home. She had been 
released from prison only days earlier for one of five earlier break-ins at the 
TV talk show host's home, police said. She claimed she was married to 
Letterman. 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie Zimbalist: Michael Lawrence Shields of Plymouth, Mich., was arrested 
last March in Sherman Oaks after sending more than 200 threatening letters to 
Zimbalist, former star of "Remington Steele" and daughter of actor Efrem 
Zimbalist Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Justine Bateman: A Houston man, John Thomas Smetek, was arrested in September, 
1989, outside a Berkeley theater where Bateman, former star of "Family Ties," 
was scheduled to perform. Smetek, who had been following Bateman, had 
threatened to commit suicide outside the theater. 
</P>
<P>
Michael J. Fox: A Westlake Village shipping clerk who in a year's time sent 
nearly 6,000 threatening letters to Fox was sentenced to three years probation 
last December after pleading guilty to three counts of making terrorist 
threats. The clerk, Tina Marie Ledbetter, told investigators she was furious 
when the star of "Back to the Future" and "Family Ties" married actress Tracy 
Pollan. She had threatened to kill the couple. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Carson: A Wisconsin man who for more than a year sent threatening 
letters to TV talk show host Carson and other celebrities was arrested last 
December after showing up at NBC Studios in Burbank with a homemade bludgeon -- 
a sock filled with gravel -- in his jacket. The man, Ken Orville Gause, had 
threatened to kill Carson unless he was paid $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Lange: An unemployed Los Angeles man, Warren S. Hudson, who for five 
years purportedly sent letters and gifts to KNBC-TV news anchor Lange, was 
charged last August with making a terrorist threat against her.

STRICTER RESIDENTIAL CONTROLS PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Planners in Ventura took the first major step Friday toward revising the city's 
comprehensive zoning ordinance by proposing tighter controls on residential 
development and a ban on front-yard parking. 
</P>
<P>
These are some of the changes being proposed: 
</P>
<P>
Density reviews would be established for all residences before building permits 
are issued. 
</P>
<P>
The reviews would make it more difficult for developers to build illegal units. 
Basements that could be easily converted into independent units, for example, 
would have to be redesigned. 
</P>
<P>
Transitional zones would be abolished. Developers in low-density zones now can 
build more units than otherwise allowed if the properties are located next to 
higher-density or commercial zones. This practice is called transitional zoning 
and is not allowed in the proposed ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
To maintain open space and privacy in small beach lots, these properties would 
no longer be allowed to have an accessory structure added to the main building. 
</P>
<P>
The number of units allowed for residences built in commercial areas would be 
reduced from two units for a 1,600-square-foot lot to one unit. 
</P>
<P>
Parking would not be allowed between a residence and a street, unless it was in 
a parkway leading to a garage. This provision is designed to prevent placing 
parking places in the front yard, which planners say has become a common 
practice in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The draft ordinance will be reviewed by the council in a series of upcoming 
public study sessions, the first of which will take place April 5 at the 
Community Meeting room in City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
After the council's recommendations are added to the ordinance, a series of 
public hearings will follow before the final draft is presented to the council 
for final approval. SANTIAGO O'DONNELL

<P>
HISTORIC 'SCOUT HUT' MAY BE DEMOLISHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SEARLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fireplace and chimney are crumbling at the old Scout Hut on the grounds of 
Saticoy Elementary School. The foundation of the creaking, one-room building 
isn't what it used to be either. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, school officials say, a bulldozer will arrive -- and the hall in Saticoy 
where Boy Scout troops have gathered for more than half a century will become 
just a memory to hundreds of Ventura County Scouts and one-time Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
The building -- it has no formal name but was designated the "Scout Hut" on a 
map as long ago as 1938 -- has been deemed an earthquake hazard by state 
inspectors. And, since the Ventura Unified School District considers it too far 
gone to be restored, it is to be torn down and replaced by a child-care center. 
</P>
<P>
Amid regrets about the impending demise, some Scout leaders have expressed 
resentment over the way the Scout Hut's fate has been handled by school 
district officials. 
</P>
<P>
"After using the Hut as our headquarters for 20 years, our boys have come to 
look upon it as their private place," said Steve Garrett, scoutmaster of 
18-member Troop 143 of east Ventura, the last remaining Scout troop holding 
weekly meetings there. 
</P>
<P>
"The walls are filled with our plaques and photos. Most of our equipment is 
stored there. If it's unsafe, we certainly don't want to continue meeting 
there. But I'd have thought the school board would have asked for our input 
before deciding to tear it down." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Mortimer, the school district's director of facilities, said the school 
board has merely asked for bids to demolish the hut. "There will be a public 
hearing, very likely at the school site, before a final decision is made," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Mortimer said there is little if any chance that the Scout Hut will be saved. 
"The place is definitely hazardous," he said. "That old brick chimney could 
fall down anytime and hurt somebody." 
</P>
<P>
Garrett said Troop 143 will move its meetings to a community center in the 
basement of nearby Sacred Heart Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Bradford, Saticoy's principal, agreed that the Scout Hut must come down. 
</P>
<P>
"The Boy Scouts and an Alcoholics Anonymous group are the only ones who use it 
now," she said. "We're not supposed to let our students go near the place. It's 
that unsafe." JACK SEARLES

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: 8 HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS TO VISIT SOVIET UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight county high school students will travel to the Soviet Union for 26 days 
this summer to study alongside teen-agers from throughout the Soviet Union and 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The trip was arranged in conjunction with the American and Soviet academies of 
science. 
</P>
<P>
People to People, which has arranged university-level student exchanges since 
the 1950s, is sponsoring the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Louise Komp, a Ventura High School chemistry teacher who helped make the 
arrangements, selected 13 students from 69 applicants. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura High students chosen for the trip are Bert Dannenberg, Aarron Jue, 
Denise Martinez, Christopher Pincetich, David Grainger, Matt Eckman and Todd 
Murray. Geof Reglos is from Oxnard High. Five other students from Southern 
California and nearby states will join the group.

HEARING POSTPONED IN IMPOSTOR CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prosecutors won a delay in Ventura Superior Court Friday in the case of David 
Michael Murray, the alleged impostor who enrolled for four weeks at an Ojai 
high school as 17-year-old Shi Stone. Murray is accused of violating parole 
from a 1980 car theft conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Despite an objection from Murray's defense attorney, Superior Court Judge 
Lawrence Storch postponed for two weeks a preliminary hearing on the parole 
violation charges. Deputy Dist. Atty. Stacey A. Ratner said she needed a 
continuance until she received documents from Texas proving Murray's identity. 
</P>
<P>
"Two weeks is all you get. No further continuations," Storch told Ratner. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, a Ventura Municipal judge dismissed three fraud charges against 
Murray for crimes he was accused of committing while enrolled at Nordhoff High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
Murray contends that he is in fact Shi Stone, a victim of mistaken identity. He 
refuses to cooperate with the court-appointed public defender, but two judges 
have denied four motions made by Murray since his March 1 arrest to represent 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Court documents show that Murray stopped reporting to his parole officer in 
December, 1981, and subsequently was arrested in Texas in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Ratner said she expected more fraud charges to be filed against Murray as a 
result of a string of scams that police alleged he committed in the city of 
Ventura last January. SANTIAGO O'DONNELL

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAW REQUIRING INCREASED PARKING GETS 
INITIAL OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council tentatively approved an ordinance Friday requiring 
an increase in parking spaces at new theaters, health clubs, restaurants, 
retail stores and trade schools. 
</P>
<P>
But under the threat of a veto by Mayor Tom Bradley, the council backed away 
from an attempt to increase required parking at new offices, business and 
manufacturing sites. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, most non-residential construction must include two parking spaces 
per 1,000 square feet of building, but homeowners near such areas as Westwood 
and Ventura boulevards, where on-street parking is at a premium, have been 
pressing for a change. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, which goes to the council again next week, calls for four or 
more parking spaces for the retail establishments but keeps the old requirement 
for offices and other businesses.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CATHOLIC BISHOPS URGE IMMIGRATION LAW 
REVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California's Roman Catholic bishops, meeting Friday in Los Angeles, unanimously 
adopted a resolution urging Congress to review the employer sanctions section 
of an immigration law that a General Accounting Office report says has caused 
"widespread discrimination" against foreign-looking but legal American 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, submitted by Los Angeles Archbishop Roger M. Mahony to two 
dozen bishops, welcomed the federal report on the 1986 Immigration Reform and 
Control Act released Thursday in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"Employer sanctions have not only threatened (employment rights), but have 
created an atmosphere of fear, mistrust and blatant employment discrimination," 
the bishops' statement said.

14 ARRESTED IN CRACKDOWN ON BAD CHECKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fourteen people suspected of writing bad checks were arrested Friday during the 
first day of a two-day roundup by the Ventura County District Attorney's Bureau 
of Investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Another nine suspects agreed to appear in court Monday on misdemeanor charges 
of writing checks without sufficient funds, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Vinse 
Gilliam. 
</P>
<P>
Of those arrested, only James Reyes, 28, of Oxnard was charged with a felony. 
He allegedly wrote bad checks totaling $7,588, then refused to provide 
restitution to numerous victims, Gilliam said. 
</P>
<P>
Other suspects had allegedly written bad checks in amounts of $178 to $1,430. 
The writing of any such check for more than $400 can be prosecuted as a felony. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen teams of investigators began serving more than 300 arrest warrants 
early Friday in cases in which $200,000 in restitution had been ordered but was 
never collected. 
</P>
<P>
Those to be arrested all had been contacted by the district attorney's office, 
by mail and by telephone, Gilliam said. 
</P>
<P>
"We only use the arrest warrants as a last resort," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's effort brings to 53 the number of people arrested for writing bad 
checks in a 2 1/2-month push capped by this weekend's crackdown, prosecutors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Those arrested can no longer be cleared of the criminal charges simply by 
paying the money they owe for the bad checks, Gilliam said. "Once a case goes 
to warrant, we will not accept restitution" in lieu of prosecution, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The two-day effort is aimed at reducing a backlog of 671 bad-check arrest 
warrants that had never been served, according to the district attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
The bad-check unit was created in 1986 by Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury. 
Since then, it has collected and returned about $1.65 million to local 
merchants and others. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury said the program operates at no cost to taxpayers or the victims. The 
unit collects about $14,000 a month in fees from suspects, while program 
expenses have averaged about $11,730. 
</P>
<P>
More than 500 cases in which the loss was substantial or restitution was 
withheld have been prosecuted, Bradbury said. DARYL KELLEY

2 KILLED AS PLANE CRASHES, BURNS AT FIELD IN LA VERNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
A man and woman were killed Friday when their single-engine plane, engulfed in 
black smoke, crashed after aborting a landing at Brackett Field in La Verne, 
near the Los Angeles County Fairgrounds, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials late Friday afternoon said they had not yet determined the identities 
of the dead pilot and his passenger, who were burned beyond recognition. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County coroner's office planned to use dental records to 
identify them, La Verne police said. 
</P>
<P>
No one on the ground was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Aviation Administration officials said the accident at the county-owned 
airfield occurred about 1:15 p.m., just after the pilot cut short a landing 
attempt and radioed the air traffic control tower of unspecified difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot then notified the tower that he would make a second landing attempt, 
said Fred O'Donnell, spokesman for the FAA in Los Angeles. Controllers in the 
tower received no response from the pilot when they tried to call his attention 
to black smoke surrounding the plane. 
</P>
<P>
The Cessna 210, normally a four- or six-passenger plane, crashed in a grassy 
area just off the western end of the runway. 
</P>
<P>
The airfield is west of the Los Angeles County Fairgrounds in Pomona and east 
of the Puddingstone Reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
Officials late Friday had not determined where the flight originated. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses, including a tow truck driver, said the plane seemed to come down 
gently, La Verne Police Capt. Dee Griggs said. "But shortly thereafter, the 
plane caught fire and burned," Griggs said. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA said National Transportation Safety Board investigators were called to 
the scene.

The LAFCO commissioners also decided that the five district board members will 
now be elected by district, instead of at large. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, which decides matters of expansion and contraction for special 
districts and cities, voted 5 to 0 to remove parts of Thousand Oaks and 
Camarillo as well as unincorporated areas of the county from the district. 
</P>
<P>
The commission made the decision over the objections of Harbor District 
officials, who sought an expansion to include the entire county instead. 
</P>
<P>
Shrinking district boundaries will hurt the district's chances to expand the 
Port of Hueneme and secure the preferred U.S. Port of Entry status, district 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But Robert Braitman, executive director of the commission, said that status is 
based on volume and business at the port, and not the size of district 
boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, shrinking the boundaries will give those voters who are most 
affected by activities at the Port of Hueneme more control over district 
management, Braitman said. If voters countywide were to elect district board 
members, the voters in Oxnard and Port Hueneme would have far less control over 
the district, he said. 
</P>
<P>
District officials have said they will consider suing to prevent the district 
boundary changes. 
</P>
<P>
A protest hearing, which is automatically scheduled as part of the boundary 
change procedure, will be called within the next three months, Braitman said. 
At that time, if more than 25% of the voters now in the district, or more than 
25% of the property owners in the new district, oppose the changes, an election 
must be held to decide the issue. JOANNA MILLER

HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT LIVED IN HIDE-OUT ABOVE STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 18-year-old high school student lived for the past three months in a secret 
makeshift apartment above his school's auditorium in Sun Valley, improvising a 
carpeted home with a bed, a VCR, a microwave oven and a telephone, authorities 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Davis used his talents as a stage-set designer for the drama class at 
John H. Francis Polytechnic High School to create a refuge from his parents in 
an attic-like area above the stage, said the school's principal, Virginia Holt. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe me, it was very, very surprising to all of us that a student could do 
this. But if a student is creative and enterprising enough, he can do anything 
he wants," Holt said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis was arrested at the school Tuesday morning on suspicion of trespassing 
after campus police discovered his hide-out when they apprehended three 
companions the night before, Holt and police said. Davis is free on $2,500 
bail, said Detective Oscar Caraballo. 
</P>
<P>
Holt, who gave reporters a tour of the garret Friday, said Davis took up 
residence there during Christmas vacation, apparently because of trouble with 
his parents. 
</P>
<P>
"He had problems at home with his parents and needed a place to stay," the 
principal said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis and his parents could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Davis attended classes as usual while he lived above the stage, the principal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Holt said the high school on Roscoe Boulevard has more than 2,300 students 
enrolled in day classes and about 1,200 in night school. 
</P>
<P>
The principal declined to discuss Davis' academic record in detail but said 
that "he was a rather creative kid" who was involved in the school drama club 
and enrolled in a stage-crew class, where he excelled at designing lighting, 
sound, props and other technical systems. 
</P>
<P>
Because of his school involvement, Davis was entrusted with a key to the 
auditorium, and he made at least two duplicates, Holt said. 
</P>
<P>
The small, triangular room he occupied was among several crannies in an attic 
space above the school stage. 
</P>
<P>
Davis painted the room's bare, concrete walls white and installed wall-to-wall, 
khaki-colored carpeting. He built a loft space to sleep in and installed a 
mattress, couch and chair. He hooked up a telephone to the school's system, 
Holt said. 
</P>
<P>
The microwave, and some of the other items Davis used, were taken from the 
school, according to Holt. A narrow metal ladder offers the only entry to the 
room, so Davis must have installed his furniture and appliances by hoisting 
them up, Holt said. 
</P>
<P>
Holt said Davis changed the lock on the room's door, confusing school 
custodians who tried to enter and who apparently assumed that the 
administration was responsible for the change. 
</P>
<P>
Holt said she had not decided whether to take administrative action against 
Davis. A spokesman for the Los Angeles district attorney's office, which will 
decide whether to file any criminal charges, said Davis' case had not been 
reviewed.

COUNTY ECONOMY GREW STEADILY IN '89 BUT REAL ESTATE SLOWED DOWN; 
</P>
<P>
BUSINESS: A SURVEY SHOWS THAT A PREDICTED BOOM DID NOT MATERIALIZE. HIGH 
INTEREST RATES SLOWED CONSTRUCTION. 
</P>

<P>
Ventura County's economy did not boom last year as many local businesses had 
predicted, but the county did experience a year of steady economic growth, 
according to a countywide survey released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly two-thirds of 519 businesses responding to a Ventura National Bank 
survey said their sales increased in 1989. In January, however, an earlier 
survey by the same firm had predicted a banner year, with more than 80% of the 
respondents anticipating that their businesses would grow. 
</P>
<P>
"When the January survey went out, the economy was in an upswing. Things were 
really booming, and there was no reason to believe that would change," said 
Richard Ball, Ventura County National Bank's senior vice president in charge of 
the survey. 
</P>
<P>
But since then, Bell said, high interest rates and slow-growth restrictions 
have slowed the real estate and construction markets considerably. 
</P>
<P>
After a good year in 1988, the real estate industry was stagnant in 1989, the 
survey suggests. Forty-one percent of the respondents said their profits 
increased, and an equal percentage said profits decreased. 
</P>
<P>
The retail market -- while remaining healthy -- slowed too, Bell said. With the 
nationwide savings and loan industry crisis and some economists predicting a 
recession, "people held onto their dollars," he said. "And we did not have a 
robust Christmas season." 
</P>
<P>
However, major retail companies -- auto dealers and furniture and large 
appliance stores -- escaped the downturn, the survey suggests. Together with 
agribusiness and service companies such as banks, they were the fastest-growing 
businesses in the county, with more than 70% reporting increased sales. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, energy-related ventures such as oil companies continued 
their prolonged slump, with more than half reporting sales decreases. 
</P>
<P>
"The price of oil is up, and the ecological impact of drilling is affecting 
that industry too," Bell said. When oil prices increase, production slows, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the county's business community is more cautious than it was last 
year, but it remains optimistic, the survey concludes. Only 3% of the 
respondents said they would consider relocating outside Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Three-quarters of those surveyed said they expect increased profits this year.

REBELS: BUT NEVADA LAS VEGAS AS ANYTHING OTHER THAN A FAVORITE OVER GEORGIA 
TECH IS A TOUGH SELL. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nevada Las Vegas attempted Friday to alter the perception among fans and media 
that the Runnin' Rebels are prohibitive favorites to beat Georgia Tech today in 
the semifinals of the NCAA basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech, of course, tried to perpetuate that perception. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone, it seems, prefers the role of the underdog. 
</P>
<P>
In the Yellow Jackets' case, it seems to fit. 
</P>
<P>
If Georgia Tech is "Lethal Weapon 3," the nickname given its high-scoring 
triumvirate of forward Dennis Scott and guards Kenny Anderson and Brian Oliver, 
perhaps UNLV should be called the Slaughterhouse Five. 
</P>
<P>
"UNLV is scary," Georgia Tech Coach Bobby Cremins said. "They have great 
talent. They've been here before, and they want this one badly. That's not to 
say we don't, but we've really got to put together a great game. 
</P>
<P>
"We are capable of playing very exciting basketball at times. But throughout 
the tournament, we've been up and down, and, of course, we've been very 
fortunate in a couple of the games." 
</P>
<P>
If not for a disputed last-second shot by Anderson, which television replays 
seemed to indicate was released after the buzzer had sounded, Georgia Tech 
would have lost to Michigan State in the Southeast Regional semifinals instead 
of beating the top-seeded Spartans in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
It's no wonder that Anderson said Friday at a news conference: "We just play 
hard until the sound of the buzzer ends." 
</P>
<P>
The Yellow Jackets (28-6) tied for third place in the Atlantic Coast 
Conference, but they won the ACC tournament at Charlotte, N.C., and they have 
yet to lose a game by more than five points. Four defeats were by two points, 
and they lost another game by one. 
</P>
<P>
For scoring, they rely almost exclusively on Scott, Anderson and Oliver, who 
among them average almost 70 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, a freshman point guard from New York who is averaging 20.7 points, 
8.1 assists and 5.4 rebounds, kidded Cremins this week, telling his coach: "I 
told you I was going to get you to the Final Four." 
</P>
<P>
Said Cremins: "I laughed and said, 'You know as well as I do that we had no 
idea that we would be here.' " 
</P>
<P>
But the coach added: "This team really came together. Something special 
happened. What's great about it is, it's so unexpected. I don't have the 
answers. We just came together at the right time. 
</P>
<P>
"Kenny blossomed. He's been more of an impact player than I thought he was 
going to be. Dennis Scott -- I had no idea he was going to play like this (and 
average 27 points a game). And everybody just got happy. Everybody liked each 
other. And we liked winning. I just sat back and enjoyed it." 
</P>
<P>
At Las Vegas, Coach Jerry Tarkanian had no such luxury. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV's season was fraught with academic problems, suspensions, fights, arrests 
and yet another NCAA investigation, still ongoing. Despite all that, the 
Rebels, No. 1 in most of the preseason polls, played well enough to wind up No. 
2 at the regular season's end. 
</P>
<P>
Two of their tournament victories have been 30-point blowouts. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the kids all year, 'If we keep our heads together and we keep working 
hard, we have a chance to do something big,' " Tarkanian said. 
</P>
<P>
All five UNLV starters boast double-figure scoring averages. The Rebels are 
33-5, and reached the Final Four for the second time in four years by beating 
Loyola Marymount, 131-101, in the West Regional final. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV uses a pressure man-to-man defense to disrupt its opponents, but, alluding 
to Anderson, who is not easily rattled, Tarkanian said: "We have a lot more fun 
playing against guards who don't handle the ball well." 
</P>
<P>
UNLV is more talented in the front court than Georgia Tech. All-American 
forward Larry Johnson is averaging 20.7 points and 11.6 rebounds, and the other 
forward, Olympian Stacey Augmon, is averaging 14.1 points and seven rebounds 
and made his reputation as one of the nation's most tenacious defenders. Center 
David Butler is averaging 16.2 points and 7.5 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech's strength is its perimeter game, but UNLV guards Anderson Hunt 
and Greg Anthony are averaging almost 30 points a game between them. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV is probably better, but that's no guarantee of a victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I disagree with (being labeled) overwhelming favorites," Tarkanian said. "If 
it was a seven-game series, the best team would probably win, but in a one-game 
situation, whoever has the best game, gets the right bounce of the ball or gets 
the key call from an official can win it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to come down to that." 
</P>
<P>
If it does, that would be all right with Georgia Tech.

RAMS ADD WARNER TO STOCKPILE; 
</P>
<P>
PLAN B: AGENT SAYS SEAHAWKS' CAREER RUSHING LEADER IS ASSURED THAT A STARTING 
POSITION IS POSSIBLE.

<P>
Those Plan B wallflowers, the Rams, dived into the free-agent market Friday and 
came up with Curt Warner, a former marquee player whose recent statistics 
suggest that a few bulbs need replacing. 
</P>
<P>
Warner is the third Plan B player signed by the Rams this off-season, but only 
the first anyone would recognize. He brings to the Rams a lengthy and 
impressive resume, but he also bloats the roster at a position that seemingly 
didn't need help. 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Robinson now finds himself with a backfield that includes Greg Bell, 
Robert Delpino, Buford McGee, Cleveland Gary, Warner and the long lost Gaston 
Green, who is looking more like trade bait every day. The possibilities are 
interesting: Is Warner a backup? A replacement for Bell? A slotback to be? 
</P>
<P>
Robinson didn't know for sure, but he did say that the Rams will soon reassess 
their backfield. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's a great back, and I think he can be again," Robinson said. "In 
terms of production, he's a championship type of player both as a runner and a 
receiver. I think he can make a big difference for us. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great opportunity for us. When you begin to evaluate teams that get 
world championships, they make those kinds of moves, be it the Lakers, San 
Francisco 49ers -- it's a dynamic type of move. This may be the single biggest 
move in Plan B." 
</P>
<P>
Warner wasn't available for comment Friday, but his agent, Marvin Demoff, said 
his client has been assured that a starting position was possible. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Curt has total confidence," Demoff said. 
</P>
<P>
Warner, 29, who holds every Seattle Seahawk rushing record, became expendable 
after a 1989 season during which he gained only 631 yards, averaged 3.3 yards a 
carry and scored only three touchdowns rushing -- all career lows. In fact, it 
marked the fourth consecutive year that Warner's rushing average had declined. 
</P>
<P>
"We had talked to some other teams, but Curt had a distinct priority where he 
wanted to play," Demoff said. "He had a very short list. The Rams were always 
his first choice." 
</P>
<P>
Said Robinson of Warner: "I looked at him on film a lot. I feel very confident 
that this skills are intact." 
</P>
<P>
Ram kicker Mike Lansford, who was left unprotected under Plan B, has ended 
talks with Phoenix and San Diego and has decided to remain with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Lansford, the Rams' all-time leading scorer, recently built a home in Anaheim 
Hills.

WETTELAND DOESN'T DELIVER REASON TO SMILE; 
</P>
<P>
DODGERS: HE GIVES UP FOUR HOME RUNS TO METS, HURTING HIS CHANCES FOR FIFTH 
STARTING SPOT.

<P>
A card taped to John Wetteland's locker reads, "I Love Your Smile." 
</P>
<P>
Wetteland sat below the sign Friday and frowned. He grabbed his head. He 
tightened his jaw. 
</P>
<P>
He pulled off one pant leg and then stopped. After an eight-run undressing by 
the New York Mets, he was too upset for another one. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not spent the past week preparing to face the New York Mets today, I 
have spent it preparing for the regular season," he said. "At least, I hope so. 
Because today was pathetic." 
</P>
<P>
After a windy afternoon at Holman Stadium, there was no Wetteland smile to 
love. He was pounded for eight runs on eight hits in a 12-9 loss. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't love his fastball, since it had been hit for four home runs, one by 
triple-A infielder Tim Bogar. He didn't love his curveball, which had been 
tagged for four sharp singles and two line drives that were saved by Lenny 
Harris' diving and leaping catches in left field. 
</P>
<P>
The only player in the Dodger clubhouse while Wetteland fumed was Mike Morgan, 
who dressed quietly and left. It was coincidental but appropriate. If Wetteland 
is not the fifth starter, Morgan will be. 
</P>
<P>
Said Wetteland: "I know I can start. I will go to the bullpen, but I don't see 
myself in the bullpen full time." 
</P>
<P>
Said Morgan: "I do better as a starter. I can do more things for the team 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan, 30, was acquired by the Dodgers from the Baltimore Orioles last spring 
as an all-purpose pitcher. After joining the starting rotation April 14, he 
nearly became an All-Star. At the midseason break, he led the league with a 
1.79 earned-run average, although he had a 6-8 record. 
</P>
<P>
Then, according to Morgan, the Dodgers looked at his contract. When he lost his 
first three games after the All-Star break, he was sent to the bullpen for 
reasons, he said, that might not have been completely baseball oriented. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to be a free agent," he said. "They didn't know if I was coming 
back. I'm guessing they wanted to give a younger guy a look," Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
That younger guy was Wetteland. He was 23, a free spirit who threw the ball 
harder than nearly everyone in the National League. He also threw it more 
wildly than almost everyone, eventually accumulating 16 wild pitches, one short 
of the Los Angeles Dodger record set by Sandy Koufax. 
</P>
<P>
For the rest of the season, however, the situation remained the same. Morgan 
sat in the bullpen and Wetteland started. The eight-year veteran watched while 
the kid was put in a position to star. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan fretted but finally settled into a 1.72 ERA as a reliever. Wetteland 
never settled down. At one point he gave up 19 runs in 24 2/3 innings. He 
finished the season 2-6 with a 4.97 ERA as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's performance by Wetteland further muddled things. Morgan, who gave up 
one run in three innings of a minor league game in his only outing this spring, 
will get his first test Monday against Montreal. Wetteland will work again 
Wednesday against Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Then, both are scheduled to pitch April 7 in Dodger Stadium against the Angels 
in the Freeway Series. 
</P>
<P>
"One good thing," pitching coach Ron Perranoski said. "They both can start or 
relieve. They both have the kind of arms where they can pitch every day." 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Wetteland averaged 8.416 strikeouts per nine innings, the 
second-highest such figure by a rookie pitcher in Los Angeles franchise 
history. The highest was Fernando Valenzuela's 8.423 in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been pumping a lot of iron, I feel stronger than ever," Wetteland said. 
"And I know my work isn't finished today, tomorrow or the next day. I am 
learning every day." 
</P>
<P>
Although Morgan was 6-11 as a starter last year, there was a mitigating 
circumstance. Morgan was given the worst run support for a starter in the major 
leagues, 2.53 runs every nine innings. 
</P>
<P>
And although Morgan has the lowest winning percentage among all active pitchers 
with at least 100 decisions -- at 42-79, a .347 percentage -- he has played on 
some bad teams. He pitched for Toronto in the early '80s, when the Blue Jays 
were terrible. He pitched for Seattle in the mid-80's, and the Mariners are 
always terrible. And shortly before joining the Dodgers, he pitched for 
Baltimore during the Orioles' awful 1988 season. 
</P>
<P>
He grew so depressed while playing for Toronto that he caught a plane for his 
Las Vegas home during the middle of the season's final game. More than once, he 
has considered quitting and working at a casino or sports book. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey man, I know about some hard times," Morgan said. "Going through this thing 
about the fifth starter, that's nothing compared to what I've gone through. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned, you can't dictate what a team will do to you. All you can do is 
work hard and listen. And that's all I'm doing." 
</P>
<P>
Not that he hasn't already looked up a certain date. 
</P>
<P>
"Our first game in Houston, a Friday night, the first spot for a fifth starter 
. . . I'll be ready," Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
And Wetteland? 
</P>
<P>
"First thing I'm going to do is call my fiancee and tell her what a beautiful 
day I had," he said Friday with a sarcastic laugh. "Then I'm going back to 
working my buns off. And I'll be ready." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Murray hit his third home run of the spring and Jeff Hamilton hit his 
first. Don Aase gave up two runs in two innings, his second poor performance 
since getting the victory in the Dodgers' spring opener. Outfielder Kal Daniels 
ran the bases hard for the first time Friday and will make his first appearance 
in the lineup either today or Sunday. "Don't worry," Daniels said. "I'm right 
on schedule" 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers sent six players to the minor leagues, leaving the roster at 32, 
with eight cuts remaining. Infielders Dave Hansen and Jose Offerman were sent 
to triple-A Albuquerque, where they will start at third base and shortstop, 
respectively. Outfielder Braulio Castillo and pitchers Isidrio Marquez, Dan 
Opperman and Zak Shinall were sent to double-A San Antonio.

IT'S A TOUGH CHOICE, BUT SOMEONE MUST MAKE IT; 
</P>
<P>
ANGELS: RADER HAS TO DECIDE WHO WILL BE SCHOFIELD'S REPLACEMENT AT SHORTSTOP. 
IT LOOKS AS IF ANDERSON HAS THE EDGE.

Choosing between Kent Anderson and Mark McLemore to replace the injured Dick 
Schofield at shortstop is a tough call, one that Angel Manager Doug Rader is 
considering carefully. And he's not about to narrow the field just yet. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are our two options," Rader said. "The third is Mother Teresa." 
</P>
<P>
Her good deeds may make her eligible for sainthood, but what kind of range does 
she have? 
</P>
<P>
"Not too good laterally ," Rader said, "but vertically, she's outstanding." 
</P>
<P>
In that field of three, Anderson may have an edge because, as Rader has pointed 
out, Anderson was the Angels' shortstop during much of the time they spent atop 
the American League West last season. Anderson helped himself Friday when he 
went three for four with a run batted in in a 15-7 rout of the Chicago Cubs at 
HoHoKam Park. 
</P>
<P>
To Rader, it's more than sheer coincidence that Anderson started at shortstop 
when the Angels were in first. 
</P>
<P>
"There were so many variables, it's impossible to determine why. The only thing 
we need to concern ourselves with is fact," Rader said. "You think of a lot of 
things -- whether we were getting enough hitting, was the pitching staff doing 
well. But the bottom line is that we were in first place when he played there." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson downplayed his part in the Angels' early success. 
</P>
<P>
"I had an opportunity to do well, and as a fill-in type of player, winning is 
the key," said Anderson, who also played three games at second base, three at 
third base, one in right field and one as the designated hitter. "It's just too 
bad we couldn't stay in first. We had a pretty good year all year long, but we 
had some unfortunate injuries." 
</P>
<P>
He would gladly play second if asked, but Anderson acknowledged that shortstop 
is his preference. He might get time at both positions, one of the many 
interchangeable pieces Rader has in the infield puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always played mainly short and I'm more comfortable there," said the 
26-year-old native of Florence, S.C. "I like playing anywhere. Wherever they 
tell me to play, I'll go. . . . Any time you have players who can fill 
different spots, the better it is for the team. The more variety, the better 
off you'll be in the long run. A 162-game season is long." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson has always been solid defensively, a trait that Rader, a five-time 
Gold Glove winner at third base, weighs heavily. "He's an average, steady major 
league shortstop, which should be appreciated," Rader said. "It takes talent to 
do that." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson knows his chances would be better if he can refine his offensive 
talent. He hit .229 in 86 games last season, and his professional best was .279 
at Class-A Palm Springs in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I need to pick it up at the plate, and if I'm playing until Schoey 
gets (sound), I think the year's experience I had will help me," he said. "As 
far as team offense (goes), I think we've got some good pitching, and good 
pitching will stop good hitting. We've got to go out and try to win a lot of 
1-0 games." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Langston was effective Friday in his second start, pitching four solid 
innings and earning his first victory. He gave up five hits and two runs, both 
on Rick Wrona's third-inning home run to left field. 
</P>
<P>
"I was able to concentrate a little more on throwing strikes today," said 
Langston, who gave up one run in two innings in his previous start last Monday. 
"I threw 44 pitches today, which was the same I threw in two innings the other 
day. I wanted to throw strikes and get ahead of guys. Then I just let the 
unbelievable defense (do it)." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels pounded Cub starter Rick Sutcliffe for eight hits and eight runs in 
1 1/3 innings and had 19 hits overall. Their only home run was Ron Tingley's 
three-run shot in the seventh, which sailed 350 feet down the line in left. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
In Friday's other split-squad game, Mike Witt pitched 3 2/3 innings -- and 
singled in the third inning -- and Lee Stevens had a three-run home run as the 
Angels defeated the San Francisco Giants, 10-4, at Scottsdale. The two 
victories gave the Angels a 4-2 record. 
</P>
<P>
Having seen all his starters in at least one outing, Manager Doug Rader said 
the lockout may have affected Jim Abbott more adversely than any other starter. 
He said Bert Blyleven had the most arm strength and noticed that Mark Langston 
made a dramatic improvement in that area from his last start to Friday's. . . . 
"(Today) down in Tucson is a very important game for Jim," Rader said. "The 
gains Langston made in four days, hopefully Jim will, too. Of all our pitchers, 
(Abbott) is the one who's suffering the most. His arm strength isn't good right 
now. He needs to locate the ball much better against left-handed hitters and 
develop an off-speed pitch, whether that's a slower curveball or a changeup." 
</P>
<P>
Langston said he never thinks about his $16-million contract when he's on the 
field, but fans haven't forgotten it. He took some ribbing about his new wealth 
in Yuma, during the Angels' four-game series against the San Diego Padres. 
"There weren't many people there," he said, "and I heard one person, when I 
went to pick the ball up and it fell out of my glove, say, 'That's a $3-million 
error.' I heard it when I wasn't making this kind of money, but I was just a 
bum then, and now I'm a $3-million bum." 
</P>
<P>
Abbott, Rich Monteleone, Cliff Young and Jeff Richardson are scheduled to pitch 
today against the Cleveland Indians in Tucson. In the other split-squad game, 
Kirk McCaskill, Greg Minton, Bob McClure and Bryan Harvey will pitch against 
the Oakland Athletics in Phoenix. . . . The Angels set a team record for season 
tickets, 18,517. They sold 18,513 in 1987.

TENNANT'S FORMER EMPLOYEE FOUND NOT GUILTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

The trial of Gordon Griffith, a former employee of Dr. Forest Tennant, ended 
Friday in West Covina Municipal Court. A jury found Griffith not guilty on one 
count of making anonymous phone calls and was unable to come to a verdict on 
another count of making annoying or threatening calls. Both charges are 
misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith had worked for Tennant as a liaison between Tennant's wide-ranging 
drug-testing/drug-education businesses and clients such as the NFL, NASCAR and 
the Dodgers. Griffith was fired by Tennant and his wife Miriam, who works with 
Tennant, on June 21, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The case revolved around a series of phone calls Griffith made to the Tennants' 
West Covina home on the night he was fired. Griffith admitted to making five 
calls, which were taped on the Tennants' phone-answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
In the taped phone messages, which were played in court, Griffith demanded 
money he said the Tennants owed him and said he was going to hire an attorney. 
Griffith also said he had contacted the media regarding Tennant's handling of 
some drug tests, which Griffith termed "fraud." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy District Attorney Leonard Torrealba argued that Griffith made four 
additional calls that night. Tennant testified that after he and his wife had 
returned home from dinner, Griffith called again, and this time Tennant 
answered. Tennant said Griffith was "not coherent" and threatened to kill him 
the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Tennant testified that he had received three more calls and that on each, the 
caller hung up without identifying himself. Tennant said he then called police. 
</P>
<P>
The jury, which deliberated for nearly three hours Friday, was unable to reach 
a verdict on the first count, of making phone calls with the intent to annoy or 
threaten. Torrealba said the jury was hung with eight in favor of a guilty 
verdict and four in favor of not guilty. On this charge Judge Fred A. Felix 
declared a mistrial, which means the case cannot be retried. 
</P>
<P>
The often-lively trial required more than three days of testimony. Tennant 
portrayed Griffith as a disgruntled former employee with a shady background. 
Griffith made several attempts to discredit the drug-testing practices of 
Tennant. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith has been a source for several news organizations regarding drug use 
among professional athletes. He revealed during his testimony that he was paid 
$25,000 by Sports Illustrated magazine for information in its recent article 
about drug testing in the NFL.

Antonio McKay, world indoor 400-meter champion last year and a gold medalist in 
the 1988 Olympic Games, and Jamaican long jumper Trevor Black have been 
suspended by The Athletics Congress for three months because they tested 
positive for substances commonly found in over-the-counter medications. 
</P>
<P>
McKay tested positive at a meet in Johnson City., Tenn., on Jan. 26 for 
phenylpropanolamine, a stimulant that is banned under International Amateur 
Athletic Federation rules. 
</P>
<P>
At the same meet, Black tested positive for pseudoephedrine. McKay's request 
for an appeal will be heard at an unspecified date. If Black appeals, it would 
go through the Jamaica Amateur Athletic Assn.

The NFL, sued by the players' union after the 1987 strike, has countered with 
its own suit in an attempt to get players back to the bargaining table. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis, where the players 
filed their antitrust action after an unsuccessful 24-day strike. It asks the 
court to declare that the NFL Players Assn. remain the bargaining 
representative of the players despite its attempts to decertify after an 
appeals court ruling that threw out most of its claims. 
</P>
<P>
"We are hopeful that this suit will clarify the union's status and lead to a 
resumption of collective bargaining," the NFL Management Council said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
The union had no immediate comment.

SEN. ANTHONY A PUGNACIOUS UNLV LEADER; 
</P>
<P>
REBELS: A REPUBLICAN, HIS FORTE IS -- AS EXPECTED -- DEFENSE.

<P>
Greg Anthony's Nevada Las Vegas teammates already call him the Senator. He 
would like for the usage to become more widespread, as in Gregory C. Anthony, 
Republican senator from Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
He already has caught the attention of Barbara Vucanovich, a member of the U.S. 
House of Representatives for whom Anthony worked as an intern in Washington 
last summer, performing tasks ranging from answering mail to writing press 
releases to making GOP missions onto the basketball courts of public housing 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
"I kidded him (that) he'd better not run against me," Vucanovich said. 
</P>
<P>
If political pollsters ran a name-recognition survey in Las Vegas, who would 
win, Vucanovich or Anthony? 
</P>
<P>
"I would say Anthony," said Larry McKay, assistant principal at Rancho High, 
which Anthony led to a state title in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony, a junior, is the UNLV point guard, the most prominent Las Vegas prep 
player to make a name for himself with the local university since Freddie 
Banks, who was on the last Rebel team to make the Final Four, in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony is also the Rebels' resident conservative on most issues, with the 
exception of abortion rights, which he supports. 
</P>
<P>
He is worlds apart from the stereotypical Young Republican. He is neither white 
nor well to do. Jim Allen, his coach at Rancho, said that while Anthony was not 
"dirt-poor," he "has had a tough life." 
</P>
<P>
Anthony admits that he has "caught flak" from his family and other blacks for 
his politics. 
</P>
<P>
"There aren't a lot of minorities in the Republican Party, and there's always 
going to be a two-party system," he said. "I think it would be foolish not to 
have blacks and minorites on both sides." 
</P>
<P>
Off the court, he is a well-spoken man who measures his words. 
</P>
<P>
On the court, he is a Barry Goldwater Republican. To Anthony, extremism in 
defense is no vice. 
</P>
<P>
Around the Big West Conference, he has a reputation as a talker. Playing with 
his jaw shut since it was broken in a game Feb. 12, Anthony has drawn three 
technical fouls. One, he says, was for his actions, but not all of them. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I used some four-letter words," Anthony said. 
</P>
<P>
With a jaw wired so tight that for a time he had to subsist on a liquid diet? 
</P>
<P>
"You can try it," Anthony said. "Just grit your teeth and talk. That's how it 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
More than once this season, he has been accused of kicking other players on the 
court, most blatantly in a televised UNLV loss to UC Santa Barbara, during 
which ESPN replayed footage that seemed to show him booting Eric McArthur as he 
pulled away from a scramble for the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Pimm, the Santa Barbara coach, said he criticized McArthur for getting 
upset at being knocked down, but after seeing the replay, he changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw it, and it was definitely intentional," Pimm said. "In my contacts with 
Greg Anthony, I've had a lot of respect for him. I think he got frustrated. . . 
. I think he's a solid player, a good competitor. I didn't think he was capable 
of that." 
</P>
<P>
Allen, the Rancho coach, said Anthony's on-court conflicts are only an 
illustration of his competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
"When he gets on a basketball floor, he's the most competitive person I've ever 
seen," Allen said. "He wants to prove to everybody how good he is. I think some 
of that's his upbringing. He (grew up) in North Las Vegas. He got his way out 
with the competitiveness within him." 
</P>
<P>
UNLV Coach Jerry Tarkanian said competitiveness is what drove Anthony to play 
with a broken jaw, even though the pain has been severe. 
</P>
<P>
When Anthony suffered the injury against Fresno State, he thought his season 
was over, and he broke down and cried. Doctors later told him that he could 
play if he could stand the pain. Anthony said the pain of not playing would be 
worse than the pain of a broken jaw, and he didn't miss a game. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a courageous player," Tarkanian said. "I don't know how many other 
players would break their jaw and be at practice the next day." 
</P>
<P>
Allen remembers that Anthony was difficult to coach for a time "because he is 
very strong-willed," but he developed a closer relationship with Anthony than 
he has had with any other player. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a fantastic human being," Allen said. "He's done an awful lot for Rancho 
High School. When we won the state championship, he got a T-shirt, and he still 
wears that T-shirt. I sure hope Monday he gets a better T-shirt for himself." 
</P>
<P>
Anthony and Anderson Hunt are the guards who steer the Rebel fast break, a 
running game that can knock an opponent out of a game with frightening 
quickness. 
</P>
<P>
But in a half-court game, the guards' perimeter shooting becomes critical. On 
days when they have trouble hitting from outside, UNLV is vulnerable because 
opponents can pack in the defense on Larry Johnson, David Butler and Stacey 
Augmon. And those days happen. Hunt is shooting 47.2%, Anthony only 45.8% -- 
the lowest percentage among the Rebels' top seven players. And, although the 
percentages are not abysmal, they are bolstered by the large number of layups 
that UNLV generates. 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, Anthony leads the team in steals with 100 in 37 games, a 2.7 
average. Stacey Augmon, whose reputation has been built as one of the nation's 
best defensive players, is second with 65. Most of Augmon's steals come from 
anticipation. He steps into the passing lane just as the ball is released, 
cutting in front of the receiver. Anthony's generally come off the dribble -- 
quick pickpocket moves from behind, jabs from the front or side that knock the 
ball loose. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony's reputation for talking and being tough on the court sometimes has 
contributed to UNLV's renegade image. 
</P>
<P>
Both an opposing coach, Ball State's Dick Hunsaker, and a broadcaster, Barry 
Tompkins, have been quoted calling the Rebels "thugs." 
</P>
<P>
Anthony is one of the team's most articulate defenders. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, a crowd of media sought to shape the Rebels' game against Loyola 
Marymount in the West Regional final into a confrontation between good and 
evil, with UNLV cast as the latter. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the perception that UNLV would be the bad guy in that game, Anthony 
disarmed his questioner, saying: "We don't perceive it that way. It's unjust 
and unwarranted. If we were to allow the media and others to mold our own 
characters and personalities and change what we do, we would have problems." 
</P>
<P>
When the issue of academics came up, Anthony rose to the team's defense again. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so tired of these labels and stereotypes," he said. "If you take time out 
to talk to me on a one-on-one basis, and then you form a perception of me, 
that's fair enough. But don't pass judgment on me before you talk to me. . . . 
Look, I could have graduated by now. I'm deciding whether to get a second 
degree in economics or work on my MBA." 
</P>
<P>
As for politics, Vucanovich urged him to wait a few years before trying a 
senatorial race. 
</P>
<P>
"I encouraged him to run for the (state) assembly when he finishes school," she 
said. "I think that's where you have to start, to learn the grass roots." 
</P>
<P>
While Anthony was interning in Washington, Vucanovich introduced him to Jack 
Kemp, Bill Bradley and Tom McMillen, men who launched political careers after 
playing professional sports. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a good kid, a very good kid, and a lot of help in the office," 
Vucanovich said. "He knew how to run a computer. He's very interested in 
politics and very interested in business." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever he does, Anthony will leave behind people divided in their opinions -- 
those who think him dirty, and those who call him dedicated. 
</P>
<P>
"If Greg never played another day of basketball, I think the future would prove 
him one of the better graduates of Rancho High," said McKay, the school's 
assistant principal. "Even if he never had played basketball, I'm sure he'd 
make a name for himself."

DISNEY TO OPEN RESTAURANT IN SOUTHLAND MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McNARY, UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Walt Disney Co. is branching out into the restaurant business with the planned 
opening of the Disney Restaurant next month. 
</P>
<P>
The company will open its first fast-food restaurant April 21 at the Montclair 
Plaza, a regional shopping mall about 30 miles east of Los Angeles. Alongside 
the restaurant, the company will open one of its Disney Stores, a highly 
successful chain the company began three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the idea of opening a restaurant along with the store is novel and 
very creative," Sarah Stack, a retail analyst with the securities firm Bateman 
Eichler, Hill Richards, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Since Disney has the experience of both selling merchandise at the stores and 
parks and feeding people at the parks, this seems a logical off-site 
extension," Stack said. 
</P>
<P>
"My sense is that it will be difficult to come out of there without eating 
something at the restaurant and buying something at the store." 
</P>
<P>
The move comes on the heels of Disney's decision late last year to go into the 
record business by starting its own label. The company has relied heavily in 
recent years on using one area of business to promote another, what Disney 
calls taking advantage of the "synergies" between its businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The approach appears to be working, as Disney has posted record earnings 
through major expansions of its filmmaking business, parks and consumer 
products area. In the company's latest quarter ended Dec. 31, Disney earned 
$174.4 million on sales of $1.3 billion, both records. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Burbank-based Disney had no comment on the plans for the Disney 
Restaurant. However, at the Montclair Plaza, there are signs at the store site, 
now under construction, seeking employees for the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeking energetic, dependable people to work in the Disney Restaurant," 
one sign read. "The Disney Restaurant will be an exciting new concept in a fun 
setting and will be opening in Montclair Plaza in April."

The store and restaurant will occupy about 11,000 square feet. The stores, 
which sell a wide range of Disney items ranging from videos to talking Mickey 
Mouse T-shirts, generally occupy 3,000 to 4,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
A Disney source said the restaurant concept will be rolled out slowly, much 
like the Disney Store concept was in 1987. Disney executives said at the annual 
meeting earlier this year that they expected to open about 150 more stores 
during the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Disney officers said the store chain was posting yearly sales of 
$800 per square foot, better than double the national average for retailers. 
The stores feature movie sets with Disney characters and employees costumed in 
cardigan sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
The stores also include strong promotion of other Disney products. A rear-wall 
screen plays a continuous loop of excerpts from Disney movies, and there are 
telephones for customers to subscribe to the Disney Channel or purchase tickets 
for the Disney parks. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an emotional attachment to Disney that goes much deeper than most 
other retailers," Stack said. "Everyone has a history with Disney, so it's not 
as if the company has to develop brand awareness." 
</P>
<P>
One of Disney's theme-park competitors, Knott's Berry Farm in Brea, is also 
moving into the business of operating restaurants. Knott's will begin 
construction this summer of a Mrs. Knott's Restaurant &amp; Bakery in Irvine, 
with a December opening scheduled, spokesman Stuart Zanville said. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant, however, will be a family-style operation seating about 225 and 
patterned after the Mrs. Knott's Chicken Dinner Restaurant at the theme park, 
which draws about 5 million visitors a year. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been talking internally about opening an off-site restaurant for about 
10 years," Zanville said. "We're not doing this to compete with the Disney 
Restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
Zanville said Knott's is exploring the possibility of opening other restaurants 
in the Southern California area, but he said it would be doubtful that the 
company will go beyond that region.

TRADE: THE PENTAGON WILL NO LONGER TAKE PART IN SCREENING SALES OF LOW-END 
MAINFRAMES. THE MOVE CALMS A TURF BATTLE BETWEEN THE DEFENSE AND COMMERCE 
DEPARTMENTS.

The Defense Department said Friday it no longer wants a role in reviewing sales 
of U.S. medical equipment and less advanced mainframe computers to the Soviet 
Union and Eastern Europe, leaving it to the Commerce Department to grant export 
licenses on its own. 
</P>
<P>
The move is a further de-escalation of a decade-long battle between the two 
agencies over which should control strategically sensitive exports. For years, 
Commerce has argued for allowing more sales, while the Pentagon has warned that 
they could endanger U.S. security. 
</P>
<P>
The action also reflects a continued relaxation of export restrictions by the 
Bush Administration in recognition of the past year's political and economic 
developments in the Soviet Union and Central Europe. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. allies have been pressing the Administration to ease restrictions on the 
export of strategically sensitive technology so that Western firms can take 
advantage of new sales opportunities in emerging democracies such as Poland and 
Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
The White House initially was reluctant to loosen its rules, but it has been 
forced to reconsider amid fears that the Europeans might bolt and go their own 
way. A high-level committee has been reviewing U.S. policies and is slated to 
make recommendations soon. 
</P>
<P>
Although Friday's decision was expected to speed the processing of export 
licenses for both categories of equipment, it was not considered likely to have 
much impact on overall sales. Officials said the Pentagon had been approving 
most such requests in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, long a holdout among top Administration 
policy-makers in advocating any easing, conceded that continued reforms by 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev most likely would bring even more 
liberalization. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech before the Assn. of American Publishers, Cheney said that "as long 
as Mr. Gorbachev pursues the current policies he is pursuing . . . we will see 
it's easier for the Soviets to acquire military technology . . . than it's 
been." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, Cheney warned against moving too rapidly to lower 
technology-control barriers. 
</P>
<P>
"There's already an erosion of the international agreements that limit the flow 
of sophisticated technologies to the Soviet Union," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Frank J. Gaffney, director of the Center for Security Policy, a conservative 
group that follows such issues, warned that while "in this case the move may be 
genuinely inconsequential," the Administration should take care that it is not 
moving too fast. 
</P>
<P>
"We are seeing this happening in such a wholesale fashion that the Defense 
Department is now obliged to be much more selective on how it uses its 
capital," Gaffney said. He warned that the Administration ought to be cautious 
on how quickly it eases its stance. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's decision was the product of an interagency review of export-control 
policy. Defense Department officials said the move was cleared with a number of 
departments and agencies, including the State Department, that have an interest 
in the issue. 
</P>
<P>
However, Pentagon spokesmen insisted that the change was proposed by Defense as 
a streamlining move, on grounds that it was taking too much time to review 
proposed sales of equipment that did not present any serious security problems. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the looser regulations for computers would apply only to low-end 
mainframes such as the IBM 3031, 4331 and 4341 computers. 
</P>
<P>
High-end products, such as IBM 4381 and 9370 computers and their equivalents, 
still will be subject to both Pentagon and Commerce Department review. 
</P>
<P>
The change, approved personally by William Rudman, deputy under secretary of 
defense for trade security policy, also applies to licenses for trade shows 
involving such equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The regulation of exports of strategically sensitive goods is performed under 
the aegis of the Paris-based Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export 
Controls, a 17-member compact that includes the United States and most of its 
major economic allies. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the United States essentially has set the standards that Cocom has 
followed. In recent years, however, with other countries developing 
high-technology equipment of their own, Washington has been somewhat less 
dominant in the organization.

BANKING PANEL OKS RYAN; HE ADMITS DRUG USE IN '70S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Senate Banking Committee approved by one vote Friday the nomination of T. 
Timothy Ryan Jr. to be the nation's top savings and loan regulator, and Ryan 
disclosed hours later he had told government officials that he used marijuana 
and cocaine in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Banking Committee members were aware of Ryan's statements to the FBI about his 
past drug use, the Bush Administration said. 
</P>
<P>
After the disclosures were made public, the Administration immediately 
reaffirmed its strong support for Ryan to head the Office of Thrift 
Supervision, which regulates the nation's beleaguered trillion-dollar S&amp;L 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Prior to my nomination, I disclosed both on my FBI forms and verbally to the 
White House, Treasury and the FBI that early in the 1970s, I smoked marijuana 
on a few occasions and tried cocaine once, perhaps twice," Ryan said in a 
statement issued late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I regret this mistake," Ryan said. "I do not regret having voluntarily 
disclosed this information." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan's statement was issued after NBC broadcast a story concerning his 
admission of drug usage, citing unnamed senators as the source of the 
information. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who drafted Ryan for the thrift 
regulator's job, issued a strong defense of his nominee. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sad day when information from confidential FBI reports is leaked," 
Brady said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
"Before Timothy Ryan's nomination, the White House and the Treasury Department 
were made fully aware of the facts in the FBI report. Now a majority of the 
Senate Banking Committee has recommended his confirmation in full knowledge of 
these same facts." 
</P>
<P>
The admission of drug use should not "deter the full Senate from acting 
promptly and favorably on Mr. Ryan's recommendation," Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
The public disclosure of Ryan's admissions will add a new burden to an already 
tough struggle for confirmation by the full Senate. He faces serious questions 
about his lack of financial experience. 
</P>
<P>
After intense personal lobbying on his behalf by Brady, two Democrats joined 
the committee's Republicans to prevail in an 11-to-10 vote for Ryan, a pension 
lawyer with no experience in the finance business. 
</P>
<P>
The full Senate will vote Wednesday on whether to confirm Ryan as director of 
the Treasury's Office of Thrift Supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan's victory was an unexpected rebuff to Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), 
the Banking Committee chairman. "In a nation of 240 million people" it is 
"beyond comprehension" that the Administration cannot find someone more 
qualified, Riegle said before the vote. Ryan, 44, a former Labor Department 
official, was counsel to the 1988 Bush presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The White House wants Ryan installed before April 11, when a federal appeals 
court will consider whether the Office of Thrift Supervision is operating 
illegally because its first director, M. Danny Wall, was never confirmed by the 
Senate. A lower court had blocked the agency from seizing an S&amp;L, citing 
the lack of Senate confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
The OTS has authorized the government seizure of more than 150 S&amp;Ls and has 
set tough capital standards for thrift institutions in accordance with overhaul 
legislation passed last year. The official confirmation of an OTS director 
would remove legal uncertainties about the agency's authority. 
</P>
<P>
Brady, who recruited Ryan for the agency job, hailed the committee vote. Ryan 
"has the qualities to be a strong and effective leader of the Office of Thrift 
Supervision and we urge the Senate to confirm him promptly," Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials acknowledge that Ryan is a novice in the complex field 
of banking and finance, but say no better candidate is available. White House 
Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Friday, "We want somebody who can handle 
the law and is pretty tough and can go in there and straighten out the problems 
of this industry. 
</P>
<P>
"If this were an easy job, we would have people lining up at the door to get 
it," Fitzwater said. "And believe me, there are not people lining up at the 
door to get it." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Jake Garn (R-Utah) said those experienced in finance would be deterred by 
a rule that forbids a person holding such a federal post from taking a job in a 
related industry for two years after leaving government. 
</P>
<P>
"We may reach the point where Mother Teresa is the only one confirmed for a 
government post or some Ralph Nader neuter who has never experienced anything," 
Garn said. 
</P>
<P>
But Democrats were not persuaded and repeatedly complained during the debate 
about Ryan's credentials. 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of hundreds of S&amp;Ls into insolvency has produced "the most 
costly financial debacle in American history," raising important questions 
about the role of an independent thrift industry and federal deposit insurance, 
but Ryan "does not seem to have given these issues any real thought," said Sen. 
Alan Cranston (D-Calif.). 
</P>
<P>
Ryan has "no experience and no knowledge of what he's getting into," said Sen. 
Timothy Wirth (D-Colo.). 
</P>
<P>
In his lobbying effort, Brady was persuasive with other Democrats. Sen. Terry 
Sanford (D-N.C.) cast his vote for Ryan by proxy. Sen. Richard Shelby (D-Ala.) 
spoke briefly during the committee session, praising Ryan as an "intelligent 
generalist" with a "good educational background." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be thinking about it . . . it's probably a matter the whole 
Senate should take up," Shelby said, remaining silent through the rest of the 
discussion until the final vote, when he supported Ryan.

MOTOROLA GRANTED STAY ON BAN AGAINST CHIP SALES

A federal judge on Friday granted Motorola Inc.'s request for a stay following 
his ruling that the company violated a key computer chip patent and order to 
stop selling one of its microprocessors. 
</P>
<P>
The stay was granted pending an appeal to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 
in New Orleans, according to the U.S. District Court clerk's office in Austin. 
</P>
<P>
Motorola spokesman Dan Rogers said the company sought the stay of the court's 
injunction against domestic marketing and sale of its 68030 microprocessor and 
"is studying other legal remedies." 
</P>
<P>
The 68030 microprocessor is the centerpiece of a family of Motorola products 
that are the electronic heart of millions of personal computers and other 
electronic devices. 
</P>
<P>
A lawsuit between Motorola and Tokyo-based Hitachi Ltd. resulted in each giant 
computer company receiving an award and a lecture on Thursday from U.S. 
District Judge Lucius Bunton not to waste the court's time. 
</P>
<P>
In a 45-page opinion, Bunton said the parties "would have saved time, money, 
feelings and relations had they curbed their emotions and sat down to settle 
their difference out of court." 
</P>
<P>
Under Bunton's order, Hitachi will pay $1.9 million to Motorola for patent 
infringements, and Motorola will pay $500,000 to Hitachi for a patent 
infringement. 
</P>
<P>
The order prohibits the companies, allies since 1975 in sharing technological 
and manufacturing advances, from marketing or selling various lines of 
microprocessors. 
</P>
<P>
Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., sued Hitachi, claiming the company was 
using Motorola secrets to develop a series of micro controllers -- thumb-sized 
devices central to information-processing devices used in computers. 
</P>
<P>
Hitachi filed a countersuit, claiming that Motorola infringed on some of its 
patents.

Mutual Fund Purchases Decline: Total purchases of stock and bond mutual fund 
shares in February totaled $11.8 billion, down from $13.7 billion in January 
but up from $8.1 billion in the same period last year, the Investment Company 
Institute said. Total purchases of stock fund shares alone were $5.9 billion in 
February, compared to $7 billion in January. But net stock fund purchases -- 
subtracting sales -- were up in February, to $2.5 billion from $2.4 billion in 
January.

IDEA OF PRIVATIZING U.S. AIRPORTS IS TAKING OFF; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: A GROUP OF PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND INDUSTRY LEADERS MEET NEAR LAX TO 
DISCUSS THIS METHOD OF RAISING REVENUE. 
</P>

<P>
Former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young suggested a few years ago that the city 
consider selling its busy international airport to Japanese companies eager to 
invest in the Southern metropolis. Many of his constituents thought that he was 
joking, and nothing has come of the idea. 
</P>
<P>
But airport privatization was no joking matter Friday among a group of airport 
and other public officials, airline executives, lawyers and investment bankers 
who met to discuss the growing interest around the country in turning airport 
operations over to private businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of some form of privatization is gaining credence in part because of 
the gridlock at the nation's airports and the slow pace of publicly financed 
efforts to increase capacity, according to participants in the seminar 
sponsored by the Santa Monica-based Reason Foundation. Proponents, who argue 
that private business would make airports more efficient, are also increasingly 
getting a hearing from local governments frustrated by their inability to 
recover the huge investments they have put into airports. 
</P>
<P>
Privatization would provide funds to build new and different kinds of airports 
and might make it easier for new airlines to get landing slots, thus increasing 
competition for passengers, proponents said. 
</P>
<P>
The seminar was held within clear sight and sound of Los Angeles International 
Airport, where officials quietly started studying privatization about eight 
years ago. In considering privatization, officials are trying to "correct what 
we see as an inequity in the way the national air transportation system is 
operated and managed," said LAX director Clifton Moore. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles has a tremendous investment in the airport, he said. "Nevertheless, 
the city has never received 5 cents' return on the work and investments it has 
made," he said, explaining that the city is prohibited from taking any airport 
revenue into its general treasury. 
</P>
<P>
The city could sell or lease all or part of the airport, he said. One advantage 
would be that at least part of the airport premises would become part of the 
city's tax base. 
</P>
<P>
The United Kingdom cashed in on investments in its airports in 1987 when it 
raised $2.5 billion from the sale of shares in British Airport Authorities. The 
company, which operates London's Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports as 
well as four in Scotland, now has a $4-billion market capitalization, Roger 
Kitley, international director of BAA, said at the seminar. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no doubt that BAA's experience has been a positive one," Kitley said. 
The company has been consistently profitable, making $350 million in 1989, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
The company's income per employee has increased 10% since privatization, he 
said, and it is expanding its operations, including entering into a joint 
venture with British Rail to build a high-speed rail link from central London 
to Heathrow. 
</P>
<P>
Although increases in the fees the company charges airlines are limited by 
regulation, Kitley said, its income from commercial activities at the airports, 
such as duty-free shops, has increased rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of privatization in the United States, including Reason Foundation 
President Robert W. Poole Jr., said privately owned airports could be operated 
and regulated as investor-owned utilities are today. 
</P>
<P>
He said privatization is a broad term not limited to the sale of facilities. 
The most common form of privatization is the granting of a long-term operating 
lease to a private company. Burbank airport is owned by Burbank, Glendale and 
Pasadena but has been operated under contract since 1978 by Lockheed Air 
Terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Lockheed Air Terminal, a division of Lockheed Corp., was formed 60 
years ago to build the airport in Burbank, said President ViggoButler. The 
company pioneered privatization of airports, he said, and, "I'm here to bring 
it back."

A federal judge Friday fined GAF Corp. $2 million and sentenced the company's 
vice chairman to six months in prison for their role in a stock manipulation 
scheme. 
</P>

GAF Corp. and Vice Chairman James Sherwin were found guilty of trying to boost 
the price of Union Carbide Corp. stock in 1986 just before GAF was about to 
sell off a large block of Carbide shares.

<P>
The stake was accumulated by GAF after a failed takeover attempt for the large 
chemical company.

TOKYO STOCKS RESUME THEIR STEEP DECLINE

Tokyo stock and exchange markets, already torn by turmoil, resumed their 
downward spiral Friday after a one-day reprieve caused by a report that Japan's 
Finance Ministry was urging institutional investors to cut back purchases of 
dollar-denominated securities. 
</P>
<P>
A report Thursday that Finance Ministry officials were trying to persuade 
insurance companies and trust banks to reduce investments in the United States, 
with Treasury bonds a particular target, gave the yen close to a 2-point shot 
in the arm. But the Japanese currency declined in value Friday for the 10th 
time in the past 11 trading days to close at 157.65. 
</P>
<P>
No intervention by the Bank of Japan was reported. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo stocks, which dipped only slightly Thursday, on Friday suffered their 
seventh-largest loss ever for a single day as the Nikkei 225-stock average 
closed at 29,980.45, down 1,045.71 points. Six of the 10 worst days in the 
market's history have now occurred since Feb. 21. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, three more corporations dropped plans on Friday to increase issuance 
of stocks, bringing to 19 the number of firms that have pulled back from 
raising additional capital in the Tokyo market since it started plunging in 
earnest in late February. 
</P>
<P>
One executive of a large trust bank, speaking on the condition that he not be 
identified, said Finance Ministry jawboning regularly occurs "when markets are 
in turmoil." 
</P>
<P>
Another banker, also requesting anonymity, confirmed that Finance Ministry 
officials have consulted large institutional investors but refused to comment 
further. Fiscal 1989 ends today in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Any withdrawal of Japanese funds from the United States or a reduction in 
Japanese investments in Treasury notes would threaten to drive up interest 
rates in the United States. Indeed, in the wake of Thursday's report in the 
Mainichi newspaper, prices quoted for the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond 
plunged sharply, driving up its yield to 8.58%. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, however, Shoji Yamada of the asset management department of Yasuda 
Trust &amp; Banking Co. said his bank had increased its holdings of foreign 
stocks and bonds since the beginning of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Finance Ministry officials were reported unhappy with the refusal of U.S. 
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady to offer help in propping up the sagging 
yen when he met Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in Los Angeles on March 23. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States is following a self-enrichment policy," complained Hirohiko 
Okumura, senior economist of the Nomura Research Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Okumura warned that the United States' refusal to raise interest rates in the 
hope of sustaining economic growth and its willingness to let the dollar gain 
value -- thus dampening U.S. inflation by lowering the cost of imports -- 
eventually would precipitate an increase in Japanese exports and exacerbate the 
bilateral trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo Stock Market headed down again as the Finance Ministry announced that 
Japan's trade and current account surpluses both plummeted in February. 
</P>
<P>
The global trade surplus declined to $5.5 billion, compared to $8.5 billion for 
the same month last year, while current accounts dipped to a surplus of $4.9 
billion, compared to $7.3 billion a year earlier. Although current accounts in 
January fell into the red, February marked the 12th straight month of 
year-to-year declines. 
</P>
<P>
A nation's current accounts measure the total of both trade and such non-trade 
transactions as insurance, freight and tourism.

QUARTER ENDS ON SOUR NOTE; DOW FALLS 20.49

<TEXT>
<P>
Stocks closed out a sluggish first quarter with a mixed showing Friday in a 
session marked by late weakness in blue chips. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials dropped 20.49 points to 2,707.21, 
reducing its gain for the week to 2.93 points. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues and declines were evenly balanced in nationwide trading of New 
York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 730 up, 724 down and 499 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 139.34 million shares, against 
132.19 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in 
NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and 
in the over-the-counter market, totaled 165.95 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said enthusiasm for stocks was restrained by continuing doubts about 
the outlook for interest rates. Traders also reacted warily to renewed selling 
in the Tokyo stock market, where prices fell 3.37% in the last activity of 
Japan's fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, U.S. stock prices have been holding steady while the Japanese 
market has suffered a sharp setback. But some observers still worry that ripple 
effects from the drop in Tokyo could soon start to spread more generally to 
other financial centers around the world. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow finished the first quarter with a net decline of 45.99 points, or 
1.67%. 
</P>
<P>
Among Friday's gainers, Teledyne rose 1 1/8 to 70 and First Interstate added 1 
1/4 to 34. Unocal rose 5/8 to 31 7/8 in heavy trading, following Thursday's 
gain of 1 1/4. Rumors resurfaced that British Petroleum might eventually bid 
for Unocal. Hilton Hotels rose 1 3/8 to 54 3/8 on what some traders said was 
renewed takeover speculation. 
</P>
<P>
Among actively traded blue chips, American Express dropped 3/8 to 25 3/4 and 
Philip Morris fell 3/8 to 39 5/8. IBM was up 1/8 at 106 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
In London, stocks ended lower because of a weak start on Wall Street and a 
general lack of direction. The Financial Times 100-share index closed down 15.1 
points at 2,247.9.

Bond Prices Slip in Quiet Trading 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices lost ground Friday in light to moderate activity, reflecting 
concerns that next week's economic reports may indicate some lingering strength 
that could keep the pressure on interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond fell 3/8 point, or $3.75 for every $1,000 
in face value. 
</P>
<P>
Its yield, which rises when the price falls, climbed to 8.62% from 8.58% late 
Thursday. Its yield had been 8.47% only a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
Prices were weighed down by a report from a Midwestern purchasing managers 
group that suggested the economy is fairly strong, according to Kevin Flanagan, 
economist for Dean Witter Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8%, down from 8 7/16% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Rebounds Against the Yen 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose sharply against the Japanese yen to recoup its losses from the 
previous session but finished mixed against other currencies in hectic trading 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices were mostly lower. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold 
bullion for current delivery settled at $370.20 an ounce, off 60 cents from 
Thursday. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at 
$370.25, down $1.15. 
</P>
<P>
Although Japanese dealers and investors were largely absent due to the close of 
the Japanese fiscal year, trading in the yen was extremely active, dealers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar lost nearly two yen on Thursday in what some observers called a 
"mini-correction." But the U.S. currency began advancing in Tokyo and ended the 
day a full two yen higher in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Bolstering the dollar were "expectations that Japan may not get such a warm 
reception" at the Group of Seven meeting, set to begin April 7 in Paris, said 
Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 157.65 Japanese yen, from 156.65 yen on Thursday. 
Later in London, it slipped to 157.30 yen. But in New York, the dollar closed 
at 158.35 yen, up sharply from 156.35 yen on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the British pound rose to $1.6465 from $1.6350 late Thursday. In New 
York, one pound cost $1.6455, more expensive than Thursday's $1.6395. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to late Thursday's rates 
included: 1.6940 West German marks, unchanged; 1.4982 Swiss francs, up from 
1.4935; 5.7020 French francs, down from 5.7025; 1,248.75 Italian lire, up from 
1,248.50, and 1.1695 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1720.

COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Strike Fears Send Copper Prices Up 
</P>
<P>
Copper futures prices jumped to new life-of-contract highs Friday on New York's 
Commodity Exchange amid fears of a miners strike in Papua New Guinea and 
perceptions of a sharp drop in deliverable supplies of copper in London. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, precious metals retreated, grains and soybeans were 
mixed, livestock and meat futures were mixed and petroleum futures advanced. 
</P>
<P>
Copper futures settled 1.7 to 4.5 cents higher, with the contract for delivery 
in April up 3.4 cents at $1.269 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Prices were supported in part by sketchy rumors of labor tension at the O.K. 
Tedi copper mining complex in Papua New Guinea, a small nation in the South 
Pacific whose Bougainville copper complex was shut down nearly 11 months ago 
after attacks by irate landowners.

CHURCHES BECOME MORE AWARE OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT BY CLERGY; 
</P>
<P>
ETHICS: A MAIL SURVEY OF PASTORS INDICATES THAT ABOUT 10% HAVE HAD AN 
INAPPROPRIATE RELATIONSHIP WITH A MEMBER OF THE FLOCK.

Sexual ethics are coming out of the closet and into the hearing rooms and 
seminaries of mainline Protestant churches. 
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of complaints by laymen and research indicating that up to 
a quarter of the clergy may have committed some form of sexual misconduct have 
led churches to address the issue, according to some church leaders and 
ethicists. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's coming to the forefront because there are increasing complaints 
against the clergy," said the Rev. Ronald Barton of the Community Church of the 
Monterey Peninsula in Carmel. "The cultural environment at this time is one in 
which victims of all kinds of abuse are ready to name the abuse and the 
abuser." 
</P>
<P>
And the church is more willing to listen, according to Episcopal Bishop Harold 
H. Hopkins Jr. 
</P>
<P>
"The church has often looked the other way when inappropriate behavior occurs 
on the part of clergy," Hopkins said at a recent conference in Minneapolis on 
sexual misconduct. "Our commitment now is to not only recognize that the 
problem exists, but to begin immediately to take preventive and educational 
steps." 
</P>
<P>
In a mail survey of 80 pastors conducted by Barton and the Rev. Karen Lebacqz 
for the Center for Ethics and Social Policy of the Graduate Theological Union 
in Berkeley, approximately 10% of the respondents said they had a sexual 
relationship with a church member, Lebacqz said. 
</P>
<P>
She and Barton said the survey results were consistent with other research, 
which showed up to a quarter of clergy engaged in misconduct that included such 
acts as kissing and hugs that were more than friendly embraces. 
</P>
<P>
The results did not surprise some others studying the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"Those figures are not out of line," said the Rev. Emilie M. Townes of the St. 
Paul School of Theology in Kansas City, Mo., which this week held a conference 
on ministerial ethics co-sponsored by the South Central College of Bishops and 
the Division of Ordained Ministry of the United Methodist Church. 
</P>
<P>
The victims are particularly vulnerable because the abuse takes place in a 
church setting, Townes said. 
</P>
<P>
"By authority of their position, ministers have a lot of power and a lot of 
sway over people coming to them seeking help," she said. "If the minister's 
always right, anything he or she asks of them must not be out of line." 
</P>
<P>
But while psychiatrists have been trained to recognize problems of patients 
being vulnerable to and even initiating sexual advances because of their 
psychological needs, many clergy have not had such training, Barton said. 
</P>
<P>
When pastors were asked in the survey how they recognized danger signs of 
sexual misconduct, the top answer was by feeling, intuition and instinct, 
Lebacqz said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the survey results raise the question: "Are pastors being trained 
adequately to learn how to deal with sexual-ethical issues?" 
</P>
<P>
In the Northern California Conference of the United Church of Christ, where 
Barton once served as associate conference minister, church officials worked 
for five years to develop guidelines for handling complaints, Barton said. In 
the last four years, he said there have been three or four complaints, compared 
to one in the four-year period before the guidelines were developed. 
</P>
<P>
Following the Minnesota conference, the Episcopal Church is considering 
organizing a national task force on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"Sexual involvement by clergy is tantamount to family incest," said the Rev. 
Susan Moss, a member of the Interfaith Task Force on Sexual Exploitation by 
Clergy in Minnesota. "The dynamics are the same: Parishioners come to church 
expecting that clergy will help provide a nurturing, caring environment, a safe 
place to grow in the faith. When that trust is betrayed, the whole congregation 
becomes the victim."

U.S. CATHOLIC CHURCH FAILS TO ATTRACT BLACKS TO CLERGY; 
</P>
<P>
RACE: WHILE LATINOS, BLACKS AND OTHER NONWHITE GROUPS MAKE UP MORE THAN HALF 
THE CHURCH'S MEMBERSHIP, WHITES WILL CONTINUE TO DOMINATE ITS LEADERSHIP 
NATIONALLY IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

The Catholic Church in the United States, which has struggled for several years 
with public allegations of racism, got more bad news recently: Blacks 
interested in becoming priests or nuns drop out of their religious training at 
a higher rate than other races. While Latinos, blacks and other nonwhite groups 
make up more than half the Catholic population, whites will continue to 
dominate church leadership nationally in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
These findings and others on church vocations were presented last week by the 
Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate of Georgetown University. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 people listened to the results of surveys of religious 
communities throughout the United States and of Jesuit schools and colleges in 
New York state. Later they heard black, Latino, Asian and native American 
speakers talk about their frustrating, often lonely experiences in the 
53-million-member U.S. church. 
</P>
<P>
A few positive surprises showed up in the data, according to research fellow 
Sister Eleace King, such as a relatively large proportion of Asian women 
training to be church leaders. But the news from minorities, particularly black 
Catholics who make up about 4% of the Catholic population, was not good. Among 
the findings: 
</P>
<P>
* Black males constituted 7% of 2,279 students enrolled in high schools that 
prepare students for the seminary, 2% of those enrolled in seminary colleges 
and 1% of those getting higher degrees in theology. Latino males made up 31% of 
high school students, 13% of college students and 4% of the future theologians. 
Whites made up 58% of the seminary high schools, 80% of the colleges and 93% of 
the seminaries. "Virtually all our new theologians in this church will be 
white," King said. 
</P>
<P>
* Among women training to be nuns or sisters, the changes were not as dramatic. 
The proportion of black women who had taken temporary vows was the same as 
those in the first stage of training -- 3%. Latino women made up 11% of those 
in the first stage, 5% in the final, and white women made up 78% of the first 
stage, 83% of the final. 
</P>
<P>
A survey of the attitudes of young men in Jesuit schools in New York state 
toward the priesthood and toward their church revealed some interesting 
differences among ethnic groups: 
</P>
<P>
* When asked whether mandatory celibacy was a serious obstacle to going into 
the priesthood, 83% of the whites, Latinos and Asians said yes, compared to 48% 
of blacks. Blacks rated the white church culture, high admission standards and 
inadequate knowledge about priestly life as other key obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
* More than half the respondents said they had never been asked by a Catholic 
adult to consider the vocation of priesthood -- a finding noted by King as 
untapped potential. "Significantly," the report said, "black respondents are 
much less likely to have been asked than is the case for Latinos, Asians or 
whites." 
</P>
<P>
Auxiliary Bishop Joseph A. Francis of Newark, asked at a symposium to give the 
church's response to the needs of ethnic communities, read from a report 
written six years ago by the 10 black bishops titled "What We Have Seen and 
Heard." Page by page, the report delineated the problems and challenges facing 
blacks and other minorities in the church. 
</P>
<P>
"These words have not had the impact we had hoped," Francis, a former Los 
Angeles-based priest, said in summation. "I get so angry. People ask why are 
there so few African Americans in the Catholic church? I used to answer them. 
Now I just smile."

MICHIGAN-BASED FELLOWSHIP WANTS TO MAKE APRIL A 'HOLY HUMOR MONTH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Fellowship of Merry Christians suggests that believers be "fools for 
Christ's sake," an expression used facetiously by the apostle Paul, on April 
Fools' Day on Sunday and throughout April as "Holy Humor Month." 
</P>
<P>
The interdenominational fellowship, which has enrolled 13,000 members since 
forming three years ago, seeks to restore April Fools' Day -- once called All 
Fools' Day -- as an observance on the Christian calendar. 
</P>
<P>
The group based in Kalamazoo, Mich., is also urging that the Monday after 
Easter be observed as a day for frivolity, a custom in some Eastern European 
churches. 
</P>
<P>
New Testament scholars say Paul, in his First Letter to the Corinthians, 
ridiculed opponents who thought they were wiser than Paul's followers. 
</P>
<P>
"We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak but 
you are strong," Paul wrote. The apostle also advised: "If any one among you 
thinks that he is wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become 
wise."

IRIS EYES ARE SMILING AT THE ARBORETUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SIDNAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you want to experience the timeless beauty of irises, you might consider 
making a reservation at the J. Paul Getty Museum for a look at Vincent van 
Gogh's painting of "Irises." 
</P>
<P>
But a simpler way to enjoy the splendor of these flowers would be to attend the 
annual Iris Show today and Sunday at Los Angeles State and County Arboretum. 
</P>
<P>
The show, sponsored by the Southern California Iris Society, will feature the 
cream of the crop from Southland iris aficionados. The Artistic Division of the 
show will display about 50 flower arrangements with irises. 
</P>
<P>
The show also will be an excellent place to get acquainted with irises and 
Southern California Iris Society members, who will be on hand to offer advice. 
In addition, iris plants -- some in bloom -- will be for sale. 
</P>
<P>
The iris has been savored and cultivated for centuries. In France, where it is 
the national flower, the iris is known as fleur-de-lis and is the basis for the 
coat of arms of the former French royal family. 
</P>
<P>
The word iris comes from a Greek word meaning rainbow. Irises do come in a 
rainbow of colors and combinations -- white, pink, lavender, blue, tan and 
reddish-brown. But it is the shape of the blooms that sets irises apart from 
other flowers. 
</P>
<P>
The iris has three upright petals called standards and three lower drooping 
petals called falls. The falls are frequently a different color from the rest 
of the flower. 
</P>
<P>
"Bearded" irises are so named because of a fuzzy patch on the upper part of the 
falls, which is the beard; the patch is usually a different color from the rest 
of the flower. 
</P>
<P>
Irises are indigenous to the Northern Hemisphere; they do not occur naturally 
south of the Equator. They thrive in a wide range of climatic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Irises fall into three basic classes: bearded, beardless and bulbous. 
</P>
<P>
The bearded irises, the most popular type, produce the most spectacular blooms. 
The beardless contain many species, the most important to Southlanders being 
Pacific Coast irises, which are native west of the Sierra from Santa Barbara to 
Washington. Bulbous irises include Dutch and Spanish irises and are generally 
more important to florists than to home gardeners. 
</P>
<P>
The bearded and beardless irises are grown from rhizomes that will produce for 
several years without being disturbed, while bulbous irises grow from bulbs 
that go dormant in the summer and should be lifted and then planted again in 
the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Irises have a large following in the United States, with the American Iris 
Society ranking among the top horticultural societies. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend's show will feature prime samples of early varieties of bearded 
irises, some Pacific Coast irises and some of the little-known but beautiful 
Aril and Arilbred irises. The latter, fairly difficult to grow, are mostly 
grown by experts. 
</P>
<P>
The Iris Society also will sponsor a show April 28 and 29 at Santa Anita 
Fashion Park mall in Arcadia. This show will feature later-maturing varieties, 
and rhizomes will be for sale. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Iris Society Iris Show. Today, 11 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and 
Sunday from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Los Angeles State and County Arboretum, 301 N. 
Baldwin Ave., Arcadia, (818) 446-8251.

CAN COUNTY DELIVER ENOUGH MATERNITY BEDS?; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH CARE: SEVERE OVERCROWDING AT MEDI-CAL HOSPITALS COULD CAUSE RISE IN 
INFANT MORTALITY RATE FOR ALL, A RESEARCHER WARNS.

<P>
Predicting a shortage of maternity beds in the near future, a March of Dimes 
researcher warned Friday that pregnant women in Orange County -- rich and poor 
alike -- could face crowded delivery rooms and a rise in infant mortality. 
</P>
<P>
"If you plan to get pregnant in 1990 and deliver in 1991, I'd be concerned," 
said UCLA public health researcher Dr. Gary Richwald. 
</P>
<P>
"I would suggest women seek obstetrical care early and be certain a physician 
is delivering at a hospital with adequate (obstetrical) capacity." 
</P>
<P>
The worst crowding is occurring at Orange County's nine Medi-Cal contract 
hospitals, facilities with state contracts to care for low-income patients, 
Richwald concluded after a six-month study of Orange County's obstetrical 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, those hospitals ran 123% over their capacity for deliveries, he said, 
handling 6,038 births when they were designed for only 4,625. 
</P>
<P>
But Richwald warned that crowding may spill into non-Medi-Cal hospitals around 
the county, causing "severe disruption" at the other hospitals. Already, two 
hospitals that do not participate in Medi-Cal are experiencing crowding. 
</P>
<P>
"Although the current crisis principally impacts lower-income women who have 
Medi-Cal as their health insurance, without immediate intervention, this 
problem will spread to most if not all of the perinatal facilities in the 
county and impact women from all economic backgrounds," the 34-page report by 
Richwald and UCLA researcher Dianna M. DeVane concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Also, a new baby boom may bring deliveries this year beyond the county's 
capacity for maternity services, Richwald said. The county's birth rate has 
been rising unusually sharply, he noted, from 43,948 births in 1988 to 49,239 
last year, a 12% increase. 
</P>
<P>
If that rate continues -- and Richwald said it might -- there could be 55,000 
births here this year, nearly 4,000 deliveries above an estimated capacity for 
51,575 births a year. 
</P>
<P>
Crowding on maternity wards could lead to increased infant mortality rates 
because doctors "may not be as sharp" as they should be or have enough space to 
operate advanced equipment, Richwald said. He noted that Los Angeles County 
last year had a 7% increase in infant mortality, possibly due to severe 
crowding on maternity wards. 
</P>
<P>
To avert a "public health crisis," Richwald said, Orange County needs more 
obstetrical beds. Beyond that, he and the March of Dimes executive board also 
offered a list of recommendations to ease crowding on maternity wards. Among 
the suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
State officials should permit hospitals to have partial Medi-Cal contracts for 
obstetrical and neonatal services. They should also improve Medi-Cal 
reimbursement rates for pediatricians, anesthesiologists, and hospitals 
providing birthing services. 
</P>
<P>
County officials should ensure that clinics offering prenatal care have links 
with a hospital so women have a planned birth site. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors should accept a minimum number of Medi-Cal patients. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteer organizations should start pilot projects in perinatal care. 
</P>
<P>
The March of Dimes commissioned Richwald's study last September after its 
directors were shocked by a new policy at UCI Medical Center in Orange. Saying 
it was handling 500 deliveries a month on a ward designed for 250, the medical 
center in June instituted a procedure called "obstetrical diversion." 
</P>
<P>
Under that policy, when both the maternity and emergency rooms are full, 
hospital security guards have met women in labor at curbside, asking them to 
try another hospital. That policy has reportedly reduced deliveries, but the 
maternity ward is still too crowded, hospital officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
Early reaction to the March of Dimes report was positive. Russ Inglish, 
director for the Hospital Council of Southern California's Orange County 
region, called the recommendations "sound" and said he knew of five local 
hospitals interested Medi-Cal obstetrics contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Lawrence Wellikson, chairman of an Orange County Medical Assn. committee on 
health care access, vowed that doctors would take Medi-Cal patients if 
reimbursement improved. "Docs in the county are willing to do their part," he 
said. "They just don't want to be taken advantage of." 
</P>
<P>
And Marianne Maxwell, director of Orange County's Perinatal Task Force, called 
Richwald's statistics on overcrowding "compelling." 
</P>
<P>
"The state's going to have to answer whether there's a solution. They have to 
present alternatives on contracting," Maxwell said. 
</P>
<P>
That could happen in Irvine Thursday when March of Dimes officials will present 
this report again, before a special hearing on obstetrical care by the 
California Medical Assistance Commission, the state panel that handles Medi-Cal 
contracts. Up to now, however, commission staff have claimed there was no 
problem in Orange County and their figures show sufficient maternity capacity.

ARMED SANTA ANA WOMAN ARRESTED IN SHARON GLESS HOUSE;

STUDIO CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Santa Ana woman described by police as an obsessed fan armed herself with a 
rifle and broke into an unoccupied Studio City house owned by actress Sharon 
Gless early Friday, barricading herself in a bathroom and threatening to kill 
herself for nearly seven hours before surrendering. 
</P>
<P>
Joni Leigh Penn, 30, who had been under a court order to stop harassing the 
former star of the "Cagney &amp; Lacey" television program, talked for hours 
with police negotiators about Gless and suicide before finally surrendering at 
10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
She suffered a cut hand while breaking into the house but there were no other 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Police took a loaded semiautomatic rifle away from Penn and arrested her on 
suspicion of two counts of burglary, including an attempted break-in at the 
house three days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Penn, who lived in the 1000 block of West Santa Ana Boulevard, was being held 
in lieu of $500,000 bail at the Sybil Brand Institute, where she will undergo a 
psychiatric evaluation, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Penn, according to investigators, had sent more than 100 letters to Gless 
during the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
The letters were "obsessive," Los Angeles Police Lt. Ron LaRue said. "She 
wanted to be near her." 
</P>
<P>
The letters and an earlier visit by Penn to the house caused Gless to seek a 
court order in 1988 to keep Penn away from her. Court records on the action 
include a letter from Penn's psychiatrist in which he reported that Penn had 
said she wanted to commit suicide in front of Gless. 
</P>
<P>
Gless was not in the house Friday morning because she lives elsewhere in Los 
Angeles, police said. Her press agent, Heidi Schaeffer, said the Studio City 
house had only been used recently as an office by the actress. 
</P>
<P>
Gless is the latest in a long line of entertainers to be plagued by obsessive 
fans in recent years. In a statement released Friday, the actress said: "These 
are horrendous times that we live in, especially when disturbed people have 
such easy access to weapons that can be used indiscriminately. This has been 
going on for several years now, and I think she has to be dealt with by the 
authorities." 
</P>
<P>
Gless appealed to a state Senate subcommittee last year to approve a bill 
restricting the release of home addresses by the Department of Motor Vehicles. 
The legislation was prompted by the death of actress Rebecca Schaffer, killed 
by a fan who had tracked her down at her West Hollywood apartment through DMV 
records. 
</P>
<P>
Saying that she had been harassed, Gless testified: "I would just like to go 
home and not be afraid. I would like to open my door and not be afraid." 
</P>
<P>
Penn broke into the house through a window about 3:15 a.m., triggering a silent 
burglar alarm that brought two LAPD patrol officers, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"They went into the home and they were confronted by the woman," Sgt. Richard 
Thomas said. "She pointed the gun at herself and threatened to kill herself. 
She then moved back into the bathroom and locked the door." 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Dan Watson said a Special Weapons and Tactics team was called to the 
scene and evacuated homes surrounding the secluded house at the end of a short 
cul-de-sac backing the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"We just heard this pounding on the door in the middle of the night and were 
told there was a crazy lady with a gun," neighbor Susan Cascio said. "It was 
scary." 
</P>
<P>
A specially trained police negotiator was brought in to talk to Penn. According 
to Watson, Penn objected that the negotiator was a man, and a woman negotiator, 
Officer Patricia Stark, was then brought to the house. 
</P>
<P>
"Throughout the night and the morning, she was talking about suicide," Watson 
said of Penn. "She discussed Sharon Gless and suicide." 
</P>
<P>
Police said Penn never threatened Gless while talking with the negotiator but 
declined to elaborate on what was said. 
</P>
<P>
While the standoff continued, scores of reporters and camera crews descended on 
the quiet, middle-class neighborhood. Vans and cars belonging to the media 
lined both sides of nearby Kling Street. Television transmitters were cranked 
into the sky so live reports could be sent to local stations. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the media stood along the street and set up camera tripods across a 
lawn near the house where Penn was barricaded. Television programs such as 
"Entertainment Tonight" and tabloid newspapers from as far as London dispatched 
camera crews to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The police and media vigil ended at 10 a.m. with Penn's surrender to SWAT 
officers. The rifle, a .22-caliber AT-22, was confiscated as evidence. Police 
said it was loaded with a clip containing 13 bullets. The weapon had been 
purchased at a store by Penn a year ago, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The restraining order issued Nov. 16, 1988, against Penn was based on grounds 
that she had harassed and threatened Gless and her family. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks before Gless sought the order, Penn allegedly visited the Studio 
City home and told a secretary she had a gun. According to Gless' petition for 
the restraining order, police were called but Penn "evaded arrest." The woman 
was later arrested at her parents' home in Santa Ana and placed under 72-hour 
psychiatric detention. 
</P>
<P>
In late 1988, Gless also received a letter from Dr. Hubert Nestor, Penn's Santa 
Ana psychiatrist, that said, "Although this patient has no destructive intent 
toward you, she did plan to shoot herself in front of you." 
</P>
<P>
Court records also say Nestor indicated that Penn intended to "stake out" the 
homes of members of Gless' family. 
</P>
<P>
During a court hearing on the restraining order, the actress's attorney and 
brother, Michael Gless, said Penn was a frequent fixture near the "Cagney &amp; 
Lacey" set, hovering outside studio doors at dawn to await the actress's 
arrival. 
</P>
<P>
Gless "has serious concerns regarding her safety and has suffered emotional 
distress as a direct result of this threat," the petition states. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Kurt J. Lewin ordered Penn not to harass or 
annoy Gless and to stay at least 1,000 yards from Gless' residences. She was 
also ordered to stay away from members of the actress's family. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Penn apparently continued to send letters to Gless but adhered to 
the order to stay away from her until this week. Detectives said Penn 
unsuccessfully attempted to break into the Studio City house early Tuesday 
morning but declined to say what evidence links her to the crime. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said that in years past, Gless made no secret of her residence, even 
posting an old street sign by the driveway that proclaimed it "Gless Street." 
In recent years, they said, the sign was taken down and moved back behind a 
wooden gate on the property.

FRAT HOUSES ORDERED TO MAKE REPAIRS

City inspectors toured two closed fraternity houses this week and issued a list 
of items that must be corrected before residents can return. 
</P>
<P>
The lists show what work must be performed to convert the houses to their 
original uses as four-unit apartments, City Planner Ted J. Commerdinger said. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of the units can request a reinspection once the units are brought up to 
code, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the Sigma Pi and Sigma Alpha Epsilon houses moved out March 23, a 
month after the City Council ordered all fraternity activities at the houses to 
stop and for the units to be converted to apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Fraternity members had applied for permits to continue holding fraternity 
events at the two units, but the council denied their requests in February amid 
complaints by neighbors and police of noise and raucous behavior. 
</P>
<P>
The fraternity houses are across the street from each other in a residential 
area north of the Cal State Fullerton campus. Five other fraternity and 
sorority houses operate in the area of the closed houses. 
</P>
<P>
Once work on the units is complete, fraternity members will be allowed to 
return as long as no fraternity activities take place on the property, city 
officials have said. The fraternities will be allowed to reapply for operating 
permits in August. TOM McQUEENEY

COWABUNGA! LITTLE NINJAS TURN TURTLE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Warning! Little Ninja People have descended on Orange County! Head for the 
hills! 
</P>
<P>
Or, if you want to catch a glimpse of them, head for your local theater. 
</P>
<P>
You can't miss the Little Ninja People -- they look surprisingly like children. 
But they're odd little creatures. They congregate in dark auditoriums. They 
communicate in a strange language, using words like "cowabunga." And they 
worship mutant turtles. 
</P>
<P>
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, to be specific. 
</P>
<P>
After months of anticipation, the totally tubular turtles from the sewers made 
their big-screen debut Friday, and the Little Ninja People came out in droves 
to pay homage to the awesome amphibians. 
</P>
<P>
At the AMC Orange Mall 6 Theaters, where "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" was 
showing every hour on two screens, each theater was packed to its 300-seat 
capacity from the first showing at 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Michael L. Tieger, the theater's general manager, said the movie will be shown 
almost nonstop from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
"I am expecting a tidal wave of little ninja people," Tieger said. "I've had a 
good turnout already. I think it's going to be bigger than 'Batman.' " 
</P>
<P>
If the reviews from the kids are any indication, Tieger's prediction could come 
true. Giggles, laughter and applause rang through the theater during Friday's 
1:30 p.m. showing, and the Little Ninja People were happy to recall their 
favorite scenes. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
"When they're getting their butts kicked by Shredder," said Ryan Lundstrom, 10. 
</P>
<P>
"When they fight the ninjas," said Jeff Montalbine, 7. 
</P>
<P>
"When Shredder gets killed," said Mary Bruack, 6. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sitting there thinking, 'Whatever happened to those nice little 
fantasies I used to watch when I was a kid?' " said Mary's mom, Rosemary Bruack 
of Anaheim Hills, who braved the crowds and brought Ryan, Jeff and Mary to see 
the movie. 
</P>
<P>
For whatever reason, the nice little fantasies have given way to Leonardo, 
Michaelangelo, Donatello and Raphael, the four lean, green, armed-to-the-teeth 
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. For those not up on Ninja Turtle lore, they 
became human-size mutants after they were soaked with radioactive goo. They 
became ninjas after taking a few lessons from an enormous mutant ninja rat 
named Splinter. 
</P>
<P>
Confused? Doesn't matter. The Little Ninja People understand. 
</P>
<P>
Among them at the theater Friday was Ryan Cobb of Yorba Linda, who was 
celebrating his sixth birthday accompanied by seven other Little Ninja People. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave him two options," said his mother, Paula Cobb. "Go to Knott's Berry 
Farm, or take his friends to see the movie." 
</P>
<P>
Before the movie, Cobb said, Ryan was treated to a Ninja birthday party, which 
included a Ninja pinata and replicas of Ninja swords for the Little Ninja 
People to use to tear the mutant flesh from the pinata's body. 
</P>
<P>
At the theater, Ryan and all of his friends posed for pictures, at $2 each, 
with their little Ninja heads atop cardboard cutouts of big Ninja Turtle 
bodies. Tieger said proceeds will be contributed to the Center for Marine 
Conservation and used in the fight to save -- what else? -- Ridley sea turtles.

A 4-year-old Santa Ana boy was in critical condition Friday after being struck 
by a car when he ran into the street, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Manolo Guerrero was struck by a black Ford Mustang in the 1100 block of South 
Standard Street about 5 p.m. Thursday, Santa Ana Police Sgt. Larry Wagstaff 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police that the driver "had no chance of avoiding the accident," 
Wagstaff said. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero was taken to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, where he is listed in 
critical condition. The driver, Jose Cruz R. Cota, 36, of Santa Ana, was not 
injured. The accident is still under investigation, Wagstaff said. MATT LAIT

3 TOP CITY OFFICIALS OPTING OUT OF OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a series of resignations described as coincidental, three top city officials 
announced in the past few weeks that they will be leaving their posts. 
</P>
<P>
Director of Public Works Bill Murphy and City Clerk Mary Ann Hanover have 
retired, effective today. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Baker, the director of community services, will leave in the next three to 
four months, said Assistant City Manager George Scarborough. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, 57, a San Juan Capistrano resident and city employee for 17 years, said 
he will work as a contract employee for the next three months. After that, he 
will remain active with the city as needed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy added that he plans to help the city finish two long-term projects: the 
extension of Stonehill Drive across the Capistrano Valley from Dana Point to 
the Interstate 5 Freeway that is expected to begin in the fall, and the 
construction of the new bridge where Rancho Viejo Road crosses Trabuco Creek. 
Bids are now being submitted on that project. 
</P>
<P>
Hanover, a San Juan Capistrano resident and the city clerk for the past 16 
years, will not stay on in any advisory capacity. Scarborough will serve as 
acting city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to Europe," Hanover said. "When I come back, maybe I'll think about 
what I'm going to do." 
</P>
<P>
Hanover has served nine different mayors in her time as clerk and is credited 
with creating the city's organizational system and installing its employee 
training program. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came here the filing system was a rubber band around a council packet," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, who could not be reached for comment, has been making the transition to 
private business "for the past few months," Scarborough said. Baker has 
established a photographic firm that he will make a full-time business, 
Scarborough said.

TENSION MOUNTS AS TEACHERS SEEK PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tensions are mounting in the Tustin Unified School District as teachers are 
entering their 10th month without a contract. 
</P>
<P>
A group of teachers picketed outside Guinn Foss Elementary School this week as 
district and union negotiating teams met unsuccessfully with a state mediator 
for the fourth time. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Rohrbaugh, president of the 320-member Tustin Educators Assn., said the 
group is declaring Monday "Black Monday" because of the grim mood among 
teachers. Many of the teachers will wear black and will picket at Monday's 
school board meeting, she said. They have been working without a contract since 
July 1. 
</P>
<P>
The district has offered the teachers a two-year contract with a 9.4% salary 
increase for the first year, said Paul Fisher, chief business administrator. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers say they are asking for an 11% raise, but the district says the 
teachers have requested an 11.4% increase. The teachers propose making the 
increase retroactive to early October instead of July 1, when the previous 
contract expired. 
</P>
<P>
For the first year, Rohrbaugh said, this proposal would cost the district the 
same as the 9.4% proposal. Fisher said the union's plan would be more expensive 
in the long run because the additional percentage would be carried over into 
subsequent years. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrbaugh said the teachers also revised the salary schedule presented in the 
district's proposal to even out step increases awarded for years of experience 
and post-graduate education. 
</P>
<P>
Although the district negotiating team rejected the union's proposal on 
Thursday, Rohrbaugh said the teachers are requesting that it be presented to 
the school board on Monday. SHANNON SANDS

SETTLEMENT VOTED IN COSGROVE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE NICOLOSI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the city's victory in a two-year court battle over the legality of City 
Councilman Cameron Cosgrove's election, the City Council on Friday decided not 
to seek reimbursement for $10,000 in legal fees incurred by the city in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the council voted unanimously to accept a maximum of $1,000 from 
plaintiffs Howard Klein and Christina Bustos-Thomas in exchange for their 
agreement not to appeal the case or make further public comment on it. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Paula Werner said that though the city probably could recover the 
entire $10,000, taking a $9,000 loss was worthwhile just to conclude the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
An Orange County judge decided earlier this year that Cosgrove was legally 
elected to his post in 1988. Klein and Bustos-Thomas had argued that Cosgrove 
was seated illegally after that election to fill two vacant seats. Cosgrove 
placed third in the election but was appointed to fill the unfinished term of 
Councilman Larry Agran, who was elected mayor. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs say that Measure D, a city charter amendment that passed in the 
same election, gave residents the right to petition for a new election to fill 
the seat vacated by Agran. 
</P>
<P>
Klein and Bustos-Thomas contended that Cosgrove's appointment could be 
challenged because Measure D went into effect before Cosgrove was sworn in.

FULLERTON MAN PLEADS INNOCENT IN GIRL'S KILLING

<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Pacewitz, the self-described Satan worshiper who admitted in two 
jailhouse interviews that he had killed a 3-year-old girl, pleaded not guilty 
to murder charges on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge Linda Lancet Miller set a May 11 preliminary hearing date for 
Pacewitz, 21, of Fullerton, who is represented by the public defender's office. 
</P>
<P>
Pacewitz is accused of murder in the March 3 death of Marcelline Onick, who was 
found stabbed to death at her father's apartment. Pacewitz is also charged with 
the attempted murder of his mother and her boyfriend in an incident the night 
before. 
</P>
<P>
The child's mother, Joanne Boydston, had left the girl and her 9-month-old son 
with Wes Robinson, identified as the baby's father, in Fullerton. The father 
then left the children in the care of Pacewitz's roommate, who then left them 
with Pacewitz. 
</P>
<P>
Pacewitz, who turned himself in to police, claims he killed the little girl "to 
please Satan."

POLICE ARREST MAN WANTED ON N.Y. WARRANT

<TEXT>
<P>
Police have arrested a 32-year-old New York man wanted for 10 years by 
authorities in Suffolk County, N.Y., on charges of armed robbery. 
</P>
<P>
George Edward Lagerence of Brooklyn, who was arrested at a Costa Mesa apartment 
last Tuesday, is being held at Orange County Jail in Santa Ana pending 
extradition proceedings, Newport Beach Police Sgt. Andy Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
Patrol officers arrested Lagerence on March 24 on suspicion of drunk driving 
after receiving a tip from a "concerned motorist." 
</P>
<P>
Lagerence, who was using an assumed identity of James Conrad West, was later 
released from jail on $1,600 bail, Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
Police Detective Sgt. Rich Long later received another anonymous tip that 
Lagerence had given officers a false name. Gonis said Long rushed Lagerence's 
fingerprints to the FBI and discovered that he had been wanted in Suffolk 
County since 1980 on armed robbery charges. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives later arrested Lagerence at his Costa Mesa apartment, Gonis said.

FRUSTRATION BUILDS OVER RATE HIKES AT MOBILE HOME PARK;

HOUSING: FIXED-INCOME RENTERS IN WESTMINSTER SAY THE LATEST ROUND OF COST 
INCREASES MEANS THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE THERE AND CAN'T AFFORD TO MOVE OUT.

<P>
Annette Smock survives on $439 a month in Social Security disability benefits, 
but like many on fixed incomes at the West Grove Mobile Home Park near the 
Garden Grove Freeway, it may no longer be enough. 
</P>
<P>
Last September the Mel Mack Co., owner of the mobile home park on Hoover 
Street, began charging residents fees for water and trash collection, then 
raised the monthly rent by $30 per mobile home in January. The company owns 
seven mobile home parks across the county and implemented the charges at every 
park. 
</P>
<P>
Like about a third of the other senior citizens who live at the park, which 
houses 97 coaches, Smock, 53, is on a fixed income. Smock said that since her 
husband died last August she has had to borrow money from friends for living 
expenses and to help pay her late husband's medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't borrow any more money because I can't pay them back," she said, her 
eyes welling with tears. "It's terrible. It's just terrible." 
</P>
<P>
Smock's current rent is $347.50 a month, but with the additional charges the 
cost of her rent and utilities fluctuates between $384 to $392 a month. And 
with other living expenses, she will be spending more than $550 a month. 
</P>
<P>
"My bills don't even include my food," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Smock, who worked at Los Alamitos Race Track for 11 years, has not been able to 
work since 1984 because of back and neck problems. She has spasms in her right 
arm from nerve damage and suffers from arthritis. She also has a chronic, mild 
spinal disease. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been a worker all my life and I love to work," she said. "I would if I 
could. Now, I've been saving soda cans and bottles to help (support myself)." 
</P>
<P>
In previous years, Mel Mack has raised the rent at its mobile home parks by $20 
a month and never charged for water and trash collection, according to the 
manager of one Mel Mack-owned mobile park manager who did not wish to give her 
name. The company owns mobile home parks in Santa Ana, Westminster, Buena Park, 
Anaheim, Garden Grove and Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County is the most expensive place to live," said the manager, who 
operates the company's Santa Ana Gables Mobile Home Park. "Even though these 
people are complaining, they are getting the best deal around. We never have 
raised rent more than once a year. We will probably never have one this high 
again." 
</P>
<P>
The Mel Mack Co. referred The Times' inquiries on the issue to its attorney, 
who failed to respond to repeated telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
But in a five-page statement sent out to mobile-home owners last week, the Mel 
Mack Co. told residents to "look at what has happened in Orange County these 
last few years. . . . We are one of the most popular places to live in the 
entire United States. Housing costs are going up at a phenomenal rate. . . . 
Compared to what the typical person has to pay to live in Orange County, you 
have a great housing value." 
</P>
<P>
It also said, it is "very common in other parks to separately charge for such 
things as water, sewer and trash. One reason is so that you can see how 
outrageous these governmental-approved utility charges have become and realize 
that we are as helpless as you to do anything about them. If you want to get 
mad or blame someone, talk to the utility companies and your local governmental 
representatives." 
</P>
<P>
Brent Swanson, an attorney who represents Mel Mack Co., said the company has a 
renters' assistance program and said "we told the residents last week that 
there is financial assistance available." 
</P>
<P>
"No residents have come to us saying that they can no longer afford the rent," 
he said. "Our rent increase is the same or comparable with other mobile home 
parks." 
</P>
<P>
Smock said she called Mel Mack recently to ask about financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, the person on the phone didn't know anything about housing 
assistance. So, they took my number and called me back with the name and number 
of someone with the Orange County Housing Authority. I'm still trying to get 
through," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Smock said she has been trying to get financial assistance from the Department 
of Housing and Urban Development but was told that there was a three-year wait. 
She said she will make an appointment to see if she qualifies under Social 
Security for a widow's pension. 
</P>
<P>
The Housing Authority helps people obtain rental assistance. It is funded 
through HUD and there is a two- to five-year waiting period before assistance 
can start, according to a housing authority staff member. 
</P>
<P>
Lois M. Goley, 91, another West Grove resident on a fixed income, said that 
after 17 years at the park she wants to sell her mobile home and move because 
she cannot afford the rent. 
</P>
<P>
Goley said her rent was $315, but it increased to $347.50, plus the additional 
charges. In total, she said, her bills and rent come out to more than $400 a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't afford that kind of rent," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents, like Goley and Smock, said they would like to move out but are 
having trouble selling their home because Mel Mack Co. requires that the homes 
be repaired before they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
In the same statement sent to each home, management said it is "only very 
rarely that someone who is shopping for a mobile home wants to buy a 
'fixer-upper.' This is one of the reasons why we ask people who have their 
homes up for sale to clean and fix them up. Obviously, if they'll do this, 
their home will sell much faster and for a higher price." 
</P>
<P>
But Goley and Smock say they don't have enough money to make the repairs, and 
say they could sell their homes quicker without spending the money doing so. 
</P>
<P>
Smock said her mobile home's roof leaks, there are termites, its furnace is 
cracked and the paint is peeling. 
</P>
<P>
"In the contract (with Mel Mack Co.), you have to keep the place up," she said. 
"I can't afford to fix things around here." 
</P>
<P>
Smock called Westminster city officials and asked about the Deferred Loan 
Program. She said that under that program, city crews will make the necessary 
repairs on her home. 
</P>
<P>
For low-income people who own their mobile homes, the city will make basic 
repairs, said Don Dastal, Westminster public works director. The first $2,000 
in repairs is funded through a grant and any costs after that are repaid 
through a no-interest loan when the mobile home is sold, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, many residents who say they could barely afford to live in 
their homes before say they now feel trapped: They can neither afford the rent 
nor come up with the money to move. 
</P>
<P>
"I just live day to day. There's not much I can do," Smock said. "I feel 
helpless." 
</P>
<P>
Goley said, "Up until now, the last six months, we've never had any problems. I 
never asked (Mel Mack) for anything. I always pay my rent promptly."

RAPE SUSPECT SAYS HE'S INNOCENT, A 'GREAT' DAD; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE FATHER OF THREE CHILDREN BEING HELD IN CONNECTION WITH THE SEXUAL 
ASSAULT OF AN IRVINE GIRL, 11, SAYS IN A JAIL INTERVIEW THAT HE IS A DANGER TO 
NO ONE.

<P>
A former Beverly Hills police officer, charged in the rape of an 11-year-old 
Irvine girl, repeatedly denied Friday that he committed the crime, saying he is 
a "great daddy" and that there is "no evidence to support allegations that I am 
a danger to anyone." 
</P>
<P>
"I am not guilty," said Steven Rush McCoy, 36, in an interview at the Orange 
County Jail. "They should be looking for the suspect over at the San Diego Zoo 
in the orangutan section. Whoever did this was an animal." 
</P>
<P>
McCoy, a former Sunday school teacher and father of three children, appeared 
relaxed, spoke calmly and occasionally chuckled during an hourlong interview 
behind a glass partition. He is being held on $250,000 bail on six counts 
stemming from the rape of the girl Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Police allege that a man, masquerading as a deliveryman carrying a package, 
persuaded the girl to open the door, raped her at knifepoint, then removed 
evidence as he fled. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy said that on Monday he was lounging around the living room of his 
apartment at 7 p.m., forming dinner plans with his roommate after a day of 
watching video movies, when he was arrested by Irvine police. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy contended that he could not have committed the crime. He said he had been 
home all day with friends and left the apartment only to take out the trash and 
deliver a cake to Irvine police officers as a gesture of gratitude for their 
help in removing a 15-year-old runaway girl staying at his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
However, Irvine Police Lt. Mike White said that investigators have been 
analyzing a host of evidence that he alleges links McCoy to the crime -- much 
of which was seized when officers searched his apartment. Among clothing and 
other items confiscated was a book entitled, "How to Assert an Insanity 
Defense." 
</P>
<P>
McCoy's attorney, Barry Simons, would not rule out the possibility of using an 
insanity defense but would not comment further on the direction of the case. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy said a knife that police found in rubbish behind the victim's home may 
have been his, but he contended that it could have been placed there by a 
number of people who were spending time at his apartment with his new roommate. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy, a Los Angeles native, became a reserve police officer in the Beverly 
Hills Police Department in October, 1976. He became a full-time officer in 
January, 1978, but was dismissed that August. Beverly Hills police officials 
have refused to disclose the reason for the dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy said that he was in a off-duty motorcycle accident. Because he was 
disabled by the crash, he said, the department let him go during his 
probationary period. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy then worked at various investment companies as a broker until he landed a 
job at Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1986. He said he has been on medical leave 
since May, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy said that he once owned a Mercedes-Benz 500 SEL, traveled the world and 
made $250,000 a year. Now he faces a bitter divorce, a child custody battle and 
bankruptcy, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, McCoy faces misdemeanor grand theft and burglary charges, White 
said. McCoy was arrested March 15 after he allegedly tried to cash a forged 
check for $4,900. McCoy said the check was from his new business, a foreign 
consulting company, which he started out of his home at the Stanford Court 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy acknowledged having psychological problems in recent years, but he blamed 
them on a drug prescribed by psychiatrists for stress after leaving Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
"My behavior became bizarre, and I wasn't myself," McCoy read from a prepared 
statement, which he had brought to the interview. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was hospitalized in August or September, 1988, and stopped taking 
the medicine. 
</P>
<P>
But that did not end the psychological problems, according to divorce documents 
filed in January, 1989, in Orange County Superior Court by his estranged wife. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra McCoy alleged in court documents that her husband had descended into 
such a mental state in November and December of 1988 that he yelled at the 
family and slapped her and their three young children, forcing her to move out 
of their Dana Point home. 
</P>
<P>
"He also told me he believed God is telling him to do all the things that he 
has been doing and also believes that I am possessed by a demon," Sandra McCoy 
said in the court documents. 
</P>
<P>
She accused her husband of being "psychotic" and dangerous, subject to a mixed 
personality disorder with borderline narcissistic features. None of the 
psychiatrists she cited in court documents could be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy denied ever hitting his children, except to spank them when they 
misbehaved. He rebutted his wife's claims that he was mentally unstable. 
</P>
<P>
"I am fully recovered," McCoy said. "There's no evidence to support allegations 
that I am a danger to anyone, that I might go crazy at any time. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a great daddy," he said. "My children absolutely love me, and I love them. 
They're my best therapy from the stress of work."

ESPERANZA USES EVERY INNING TO DEFEAT LOS ALAMITOS

<P>
After watching Esperanza High School score in every inning of a 12-5 victory 
Friday, Los Alamitos Coach Mike Gibson didn't hesitate to offer an opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen every team in the league, and they're definitely No. 1," Gibson 
said. "That's a good-hitting team that's going to score runs against anybody at 
any time." 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza (9-2, 5-0 in league) gained sole possession of first place in the 
Empire League and made it look easy. Third baseman Keith McDonald got things 
going with a three-run home run to center in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
Every Esperanza starter reached base safely. McDonald drove in four runs with 
two hits and Dan Redington had three hits and two RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza also proved resourceful, twice scoring without benefit of a hit as 
the Aztecs stole six bases and executed three sacrifice bunts perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
"You look up and see 12 runs and think we're mashing the ball," Coach Mike 
Curran said. "But we did the little things today, like sacrificing a runner 
into scoring position and then scoring him with a fly ball. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't muscle-up with Los Alamitos. Their first four batters are strong 
power hitters who are capable of extra-base hits every time they come up to the 
plate." 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza, which averages 9.5 runs per game, has two muscle men of its own in 
Redington and McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos (5-6-1, 4-1) had a four-game winning streak ended and managed only 
five hits off Shade Summers (5-0) through five innings. Redington earned the 
save by retiring the side in the sixth and seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Summers got off to a shaky start, allowing a lead-off homer to Todd Gragnano 
and then walking four consecutive batters in the first inning. But he didn't 
allow another run until an error by Redington helped Los Alamitos score three 
times in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pleased the way Shade battled back in the first inning and then got us 
out of a jam in the fifth," Curran said. "He's only a junior, but he gets more 
seasoning with every start." 
</P>
<P>
Gibson said Los Alamitos' inability to take advantage of Summers' wildness in 
the first inning was the turning point. 
</P>
<P>
"We did things in reverse today," Gibson said. "We got a homer and then four 
walks. Now, Esperanza is in the driver's seat for the league title." 
</P>
<P>
In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado 4, Katella 2 -- Gar Vallone had two hits and one RBI to lead visiting 
El Dorado (8-3, 2-3). Katella took the lead on Jeff Evans' two-run triple, but 
El Dorado scored once in the second, twice in the third and once in the fifth. 
Katella is 2-3 in league. 
</P>
<P>
Loara 7, Cypress 4 -- The Saxons (3-9, 2-3) rallied from a 4-1 deficit for the 
victory at Loara. Cypress (1-11, 0-5) led, 4-2, after three innings, but Loara 
scored four times in the fourth. Charlie Gibson had a two-run double in the 
inning. Gibson also pitching the final three innings in relief of Joey Gaudio 
for the save. Kyle Poffenberger and Erich Munzner each had two hits for Loara.

SANTIAGO'S 'SMURFS' SCORE ANOTHER BIG VICTORY OVER KENNEDY

<P>
Santiago High School's baseball players are unlikely to strike terror in a 
pitcher's heart by digging in at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Even their coach admits as much. 
</P>
<P>
"Our guys are all about 5-feet-10, 155 pounds," Myron Pines said. "I call them 
the Smurfs." 
</P>
<P>
Undersized or not, Santiago has been toppling giants this season. The Cavaliers 
earned another Garden Grove League victory Friday, beating visiting Kennedy, 
6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago (10-4, 4-0 in league) took over first place in the Garden Grove 
League, a game ahead of Kennedy (5-6, 3-1), La Quinta and Los Amigos. 
</P>
<P>
A Garden Grove championship would be Santiago's first since 1968, when the 
Angels' Bert Blyleven was the school's top pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know how we're doing it, to tell the truth," Pines said. "We've 
got no real strengths, but then again, we've got no real weaknesses either." 
</P>
<P>
Friday, the Cavaliers won with timely hitting, smart baserunning and clutch 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago scored three times in the first inning with the help of an error by 
Kennedy first baseman Min Son. But the Fighting Irish tied the score on a pair 
of mammoth home runs -- a second-inning solo shot by Scott Jones and a two-run 
blast by Scott Wood in the third. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago catcher Adrian Borbon broke the tie with an opposite-field RBI single 
in the fourth. The Cavaliers added two runs in the fifth on a triple by second 
baseman Marco Perez, a sacrifice fly by Enele Scanlan and Erick Paniagua's RBI 
single. 
</P>
<P>
Right-hander Robert Leon (3-1) got the victory in relief, and Mike Kissell shut 
down Kennedy in the seventh for his second save. Kennedy's Brian Faddoul (3-2), 
who pitched a perfect game a week ago against Bolsa Grande, was the loser. 
</P>
<P>
A big test for Santiago will come Wednesday, when the Cavaliers travel to La 
Quinta. Theyhaven't defeated La Quinta in baseball in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove 2, Pacifica 1 -- Joe Aguirre, a junior left-hander, pitched a 
two-hitter, striking out five and walking one, to lead host Garden Grove (4-5, 
2-2). Donnie Johnson had two hits and an RBI and Raul Gonzales had two hits and 
scored twice for Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Los Amigos 7, Rancho Alamitos 4 -- Bill Speer allowed seven hits, struck out 
six and walked three to lead host Los Amigos (4-7, 3-1). Speer had two hits, 
scored one run and had one RBI and John Morgan had three hits, scored twice and 
had two RBIs for Los Amigos. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta 9, Bolsa Grande 3 -- Jason Cherms had three hits and scored twice to 
lead host La Quinta (9-4, 3-1). Kenny Granger had two hits and three RBIs for 
La Quinta.

Canyon High School upset Garden Grove, 1-0, to win the 4-A Division 
championship of the Canyon Tournament of Champions Friday night at Peralta 
Canyon Park. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon, ranked fourth in the Orange County Softball Coaches' Poll, had been to 
the quarterfinals of its tournament three times but never beyond. But Friday, 
the Comanches got solid pitching from Sara Roberts and savvy baserunning from 
Dalynne Large to defeat third-ranked Garden Grove (13-3). 
</P>
<P>
Large scored the winning run in the bottom of the seventh with two outs. She 
singled to left, the first hit allowed by Stephanie Smith. Large advanced to 
second on a passed ball. 
</P>
<P>
With Traci Hymes at the plate and the count 3-1, Large decided to steal third. 
Garden Grove third baseman Brandie Novack bobbled the throw from catcher Becky 
Eggers. Large scored on the error. "She's my best baserunner," Canyon Coach 
Lance Eddy said of Large. "She is not my fastest, but she knew she could pull 
it. She just makes it happen. She decided to go on her own. Besides, if she's 
out, she leads off on second base for the tiebreaker.' 
</P>
<P>
Large, who plays second base, got Canyon's only hit off Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought (Smith) was pitching a lot of balls, so I thought she was going to 
walk (Hymes), so I just went," Large said. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I noticed no one was covering third and they threw the ball anyway and 
the third baseman wasn't even ready for it. Then Lance sent me home." 
</P>
<P>
and walked two. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts (8-1) had nine strikeouts, one walk and gave up two hits. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon (12-1) has lost only to Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
In other Canyon tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
El Toro 1, San Clemente 0 (eight innings, tiebreaker) -- Karie Yoshioka singled 
to right to score Jenny Melville from second base in the tiebreaker in the 
ninth-place 4-A game. Paige Lauby then struck out the side in the bottom of the 
eighth. 
</P>
<P>
In the Academy League: 
</P>
<P>
Liberty Christian 10, St. Margaret's 3 -- Lisa Gray pitched a one-hitter, 
striking out nine and walking seven to lead Liberty Christian (5-3, 1-0) at 
Davis Field in Costa Mesa. In nonleague games: 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo 2, Trabuco Hills 1 (8 innings) -- Mission Viejo (8-3) scored in 
the top of the eighth. Kerin Dull (8-2) pitched a three-hitter, striking out 
five and walking three for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley 2, Santa Ana Valley 0 -- The first Santa Ana Valley batter 
reached on an error by pitcher Jennifer Smith, but Smith then retired 21 
consecutive batters for her second no-hitter of the season. Smith (6-2) struck 
out 12. Visiting Capistrano Valley is 8-2. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove Claremont 18, Calvary Baptist 4 -- Amy Miller had four hits, 
including a two-run home run in the second inning, and had four RBIs to lead 
Claremont (4-5) at Garden Grove Park. In the Olympic League:

1990 GIRLS' SWIMMING PREVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Top teams: Capistrano Valley, El Toro, Foothill, Los Alamitos, Mission Viejo, 
Trabuco Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Top swimmers: Christy Carolin (Capistrano Valley); Laura Ellison, Sionnaion 
Marcoux (Foothill), Cindy Focht (El Toro), Michelle Ham, Julie Vogt (Fountain 
Valley), Natasha Khone (Rancho Alamitos), Stacy St. Martin, Nicole Williamson 
(Los Alamitos), Shannon Quinn (Tustin), Katarina Triska (Mission Viejo), Amy 
Ward (Trabuco Hills). 
</P>
<P>
Important dates: April 7, Southern Section Relays; April 21, Foothill swim 
games; April 21, Mission Viejo invitational; May 1-5, league finals; May 11-12, 
Southern Section finals. 
</P>
<P>
Notes: Los Alamitos has won two consecutive 3-A championships and should be a 
cinch for a third. The Griffins return their top six swimmers from last year's 
team, which finished 91 points ahead of second-place El Dorado. The Golden 
Hawks lost most of their top swimmers, including Olympian Janet Evans, and will 
have trouble finishing second this season. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley has won three consecutive 4-A championships and is strong 
again this season. However, the Cougars will be challenged by Foothill, which 
has its best team in 11 years, according to Coach Tom DeLong. However, 
Capistrano Valley has the edge because the Cougars have a strong diving team; 
Foothill has no divers. 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills ran away with the 2-A title last season, finishing nearly 100 
points ahead of runner-up Mater Dei. The Mustangs return almost everyone and 
will be tough to beat.

FINALLY, IT'S WILLIAMSON'S TURN TO SURFACE;

<P>
GIRLS' SWIMMING: THE LOS ALAMITOS' SENIOR, WHO SWAM IN JANET EVANS' WAKE FOR 
PAST TWO YEARS, MIGHT NOW BE COUNTY'S BEST.

<P>
After two years in the wake of one of the best swimmers in the world, Nicole 
Williamson might finally get some attention. 
</P>
<P>
Williamson, a senior at Los Alamitos High School, has been one of the top high 
school swimmers in Orange County since she was a sophomore. Unfortunately for 
her, Janet Evans, lived in the same county. 
</P>
<P>
The two also competed in the same section meets, the same league and the same 
events. So, while Evans was setting national high school records in the 
500-yard freestyle and 200 individual medley, Williamson was collecting some 
nifty second-place medals. 
</P>
<P>
"People kept asking me why I insisted on swimming those events when I knew was 
only going to get second place," Williamson said. "Those were my best events 
and I was going to swim in them. It just happened that they were Janet's best 
events, too." 
</P>
<P>
Well, perseverance, with a touch of stubbornness, has paid off. 
</P>
<P>
Evans graduated from El Dorado last June and is now competing for Stanford. So 
the honor of being the best female high school swimmer in the county is up for 
grabs, as well as open for debate. 
</P>
<P>
Williamson and Sionnaion Marcoux of Foothill are the two names mentioned most 
by coaches in the county, with the edge going to Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
She has the top times of any returning swimmer in the 500 free and 200 IM. 
Williamson has also shown versatility by swimming strong times in nearly every 
event. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt in my mind that Nicole is the best in the county this year," 
Los Alamitos Coach Debbie Fleming said. "She could have won any other event in 
last year's meet. But she chose to swim against Janet because those events were 
her favorites." 
</P>
<P>
Fleming said Williamson has been an asset to the team as a teacher as well as a 
swimmer. Last season, Williamson learned a new technique in the breaststroke 
and Fleming asked her to teach it to teammate Stephanie Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy's time in the breast stroke improved so much that other swimmers on the 
team wanted Williamson to teach them the technique. She was soon tutoring them 
in other events as well. 
</P>
<P>
"She would work with one of our swimmers during lunch and or after school," 
Fleming said. "It gives the other swimmers someone to work with one-on-one. 
Nicole is really good at analyzing flaws and correcting them. We call her our 
stroke specialist." 
</P>
<P>
Williamson has improved her own times this season on the high school and 
national levels. Last week at the U.S. Swimming senior nationals, Williamson 
had a personal best in the 1,000-meter free. 
</P>
<P>
At the Southern Section 3-A meet in 1989, she had a time of 4:53.60 seconds in 
the 500 free and 2:05.30 in the 200 IM. This season, Williamson already has 
swam a 4:54.90 in the 500 free and 2:08.25 in the 200 IM. 
</P>
<P>
"I need to work on my IM a little bit more," Williamson said. "I'm not real 
happy with it right now. I just have to keep working at it. Nothing is handed 
to you on a silver plate." 
</P>
<P>
Williamson said that she will miss competing against Evans this season. 
</P>
<P>
Williamson and Evans were teammates on the Fullerton Aquatic Swim Team and 
sometimes worked out together. 
</P>
<P>
"It helped me a lot," said Williamson, who has signed a letter of intent to 
swim at Michigan next year. "Swimming with Janet always seemed to push me to do 
better. I could always tell how well I was doing by how far ahead Janet was." 
</P>
<P>
Williamson did come close to beating Evans once in the 100-yard backstroke. 
During the 1988 Empire League finals, they came to the finish line almost dead 
even, but Evans touched first. 
</P>
<P>
After that, they never faced each other in the league finals again. 
</P>
<P>
"We really didn't like racing against each other in league, so we avoided it," 
Williamson said. "We both asked our coaches to put us in separate events." 
</P>
<P>
But they did race four times in Southern Section 3-A championship meets. Evans 
set national high school records in three of those races. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Evans won the 200 IM in 1:59.96 to became the first female swimmer 
to go under two minutes in a high school meet. She then waited in the pool for 
Williamson, who finished second with a personal-best 2:05.30. 
</P>
<P>
"I was catching my breath and Janet jumped over the lane line and hugged me," 
Williamson said. "Here she had just set a national record and she wanted to 
congratulate me. That was neat." 
</P>
<P>
But would winning have been better? 
</P>
<P>
"Winning was never the important thing for me. It was more important to swim my 
best time," Williamson said. "Still, I'm a little happy that she's gone. Maybe 
I can get a championship for myself now."

UC IRVINE RISES UP TO SHUT DOWN FULLERTON 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The balance of baseball power in Orange County has been tilted to the North for 
some time now. Cal State Fullerton, just up the 57 Freeway from Anaheim 
Stadium, has been the county seat of college baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Until Friday night, Fullerton had beaten UC Irvine in eight of the past nine 
games between the teams, and in all but 19 of the 63 games the teams have 
played since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
But behind the finely controlled pitching performance of Ken Whitworth, who 
pitched a six-hit shutout, Irvine struck the first blow in this weekend's 
three-game series with a 4-0 victory in front of 300 at Titan Field, marking 
the first time Fullerton has been shut out in the history of the series. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to love beating these guys," said Whitworth, who improved his 
record to 8-2 and lowered his earned-run average to 2.22. "They've always been 
tough. They've got a couple of championship trophies here. We've taken it on 
the chin from these guys. It's our turn now." 
</P>
<P>
The game was the Big West Conference opener for both teams, signaling the end 
of what has been an unusual nonconference season for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine, picked to finish seventh in the conference, is 22-11 and has beaten 
some nationally ranked teams. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton, which won the NCAA championship in 1979 and 1984, has lost four of 
its past six and is 15-13. 
</P>
<P>
"(Whitworth) pitched a good ballgame," said Larry Cochell, Fullerton's coach. 
"We didn't get the base hit when we needed it. They played good defense and 
made all the plays." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's Sam Colarusso (3-2) also pitched well, but not well enough to beat 
Whitworth. He allowed four runs, three of them earned, over eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine got the only run it would need in the fourth inning, when Osmar DeChavez 
scored from third after Jon Berger hit a 3-0 pitch into shallow center. 
DeChavez had singled and gone to third on Mike Goodcase's double to left. 
Goodcase, who tried to score on Berger's hit, was thrown out at the plate by 
center fielder Paul Bunch. 
</P>
<P>
Whitworth pitched 4 2/3 perfect innings before giving up a single to Steve 
Sisco, who went to third on Frank Charles' single. Whitworth went to a full 
count on David Ayala, but struck him out swinging with a fastball down the 
middle. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton had another scoring opportunity in the eighth. Phil Nevin doubled to 
left with two out, and went to third on a wild pitch to Rich Gonzales. But on 
the next pitch, Whitworth got Gonzales to hit a hard shot back to the mound, 
which he knocked down and threw to first to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
The shutout was Irvine's first since April 11 of last year, when Whitworth 
earned a 1-0 victory in a seven-inning game against Loyola Marymount, the only 
other shutout of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine took a 2-0 lead in the fifth. Ray Walker scored an unearned run on a 
groundout after reaching third on a single and a two-base fielding error by 
Bunch, who had to chase the ball to the fence in center field. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine added another run in the seventh after loading the bases on a single by 
Billy Bardens, a double by Walker and an intentional walk. With one out, Chris 
Gallego hit a grounder to second, but Fullerton could turn only the first half 
of the double play, allowing the run to score. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine scored its final run in the eighth, when Goodcase, who had walked and 
stolen second, beat a throw to the plate from right field after Shelby Niss 
singled. 
</P>
<P>
In Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. play: 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine 3, Cal State Northridge 2 -- Steve Florentine had 22 kills and James 
Felton added 19 as the Anteaters (7-11, 2-11) won, 13-15, 15-8, 15-5, 9-15, 
15-11, at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
In nonconference women's softball: 
</P>
<P>
Chapman 4-5, Cal State Hayward 0-0 -- Sandy Olivas hit two home runs and a 
double and drove in three runs in the second game of a doubleheader sweep for 
host Chapman (30-7). Shelly Mahon (8-2) allowed three hits and struck our five. 
In the first game, Jacki Blake (14-2) struck out eight and allowed four hits. 
</P>
<P>
In Big West Conference women's tennis: 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State 7, Cal State Fullerton 2 -- Maria Mendez defeated Caroline Sporer, 
6-1, 6-3, to lead host Fresno State (10-5, 7-2). Kelli Moore and Rosanne Alva 
defeated Mendez and Cecile Bowdais, 6-1, 3-6, 7-6, in doubles for Fullerton 
(12-11, 3-4). 
</P>
<P>
In nonconference women's tennis: 
</P>
<P>
Brown 7, UC Irvine 2 -- Anna Sloan defeated Stacey Cadigan in No. 1 singles, 
6-1, 6-1, to lead visiting Brown. Kelly Goldsborough defeated Jill Dunkel, 7-6 
(4), 6-4, for the only singles victory for Irvine (6-15).

ORANGE COAST WOMEN WIN 68TH IN ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange Coast College won its 68th consecutive women's swimming meet Friday and 
tied what is believed to be the state's longest community college winning 
streak in any sport. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates won all 16 events and defeated San Diego Mesa, 114-26, in an Orange 
Empire Conference meet in San Diego. Orange Coast (5-0) last loss was to San 
Diego Mesa in 1982. Community college records aren't kept on the state level, 
but OCC officials believe the 68 consecutive victories match the record held by 
the Golden West water polo team and the Long Beach men's track team. 
</P>
<P>
In the 50 butterfly, Karen Paulitschek (26.75 seconds) won and Christine 
Williams (26.82) finished second with the two fastest times in the state this 
season. Veronica Vasquez won the 50 free in 25.93 and the 100 free in 57.41. 
Mesa is 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
In another Orange Empire Conference women's swimming meet: 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback 70, Palomar 69 -- Kathleen Wallace won the 200 free (2:01.53), the 
500 free (5:17.24) and the 50 breaststroke (32.73) for Saddleback. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange Empire Conference men's swimming: 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast 84, San Diego Mesa 27 -- Visiting OCC won 12 of 13 events. Tony 
Harris won the 1,000-yard free in 9:50.49, he fastest time in the state this 
season. Phil Reget won the 50 free (21.95) and the 100 free (49.77) for the 
Pirates (5-0). San Diego Mesa dropped to 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Palomar 68, Saddleback 44 -- Jason Armison won the 500-yard free (4:59.17) and 
the 1,000-yard free (10:31.68) for host Saddleback (3-2). Palomar is 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange Empire Conference softball: 
</P>
<P>
Cypress 10, Fullerton 3 -- Rose Ferrante went four for five with a double, 
triple, two RBIs and one run scored for visiting Cypress (24-3, 8-0). Cypress 
scored six runs in the first innings and Laura Corson (15-1) allowed four hits, 
four walks and struck out three. Fullerton is 4-21 and 3-6. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West 1, Saddleback 0 (10 innings) -- Gretchen Boch singled in 
pinch-runner Shawna Savage with two outs in the bottom of the 10th for the 
Rustlers (24-11, 6-4). 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast 4, Riverside 3 (10 innings) -- Wendy Robinson doubled home Kim 
Clark, who had reached on an error, for host Orange Coast (22-5, 8-1). 
</P>
<P>
In the John Ward Invitational track meet: 
</P>
<P>
Nate Hosea won the 100 meters in 10.5 seconds to lead Rancho Santiago to third 
place with 106 points at Rancho Santiago. Grossmont finished first (136 
points), Moorpark second (126), Golden West and Antelope Valley tied for fourth 
(50) and San Diego was sixth (24). Rancho Santiago's Mark Shores won the 200 
meters in 21.2. Rancho Santiago ran a 42.1 in the 400 relay. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's division, Eva Orozco won the 1,500 in 4:53.1 to lead Rancho 
Santiago to a third-place finish with 56 points. Moorpark was first (108), 
Grossmont second (106), Antelope Valley fourth (46), Golden West fifth (14) and 
San Diego was sixth (6).

DON'T WASTE TIME TRYING TO CATEGORIZE HIM; 
</P>
<P>
COMPOSER: "I'M KIND OF A MAVERICK," SAYS MULTI-REEDMAN VINNY GOLIA, WHO BLENDS 
JAZZ, CLASSICAL AND NEW MUSIC INTO A SOUND THAT TRANSCENDS CLASSIFICATION. HE 
PERFORMS TONIGHT IN NEWPORT BEACH. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A man stands in a forest of horns. Flutes, saxophones and clarinets of all 
sizes as well as some unfamiliar instruments are clustered center stage as an 
orchestra weaves quiet, stately lines before moving into an involved but 
rhythmic riff. The man in the middle, Vinny Golia, picks out the baritone 
saxophone from the lot, straps it on and starts to blow. 
</P>
<P>
That was the scene at Patriotic Hall in Los Angeles in December, when Golia led 
his 18-piece ensemble in a program of his original music. The list of 
instruments Golia played took up three lines in the program, but equally 
impressive were the leader's ambitious, sometimes-quirky compositions that 
seemed to transcend category with a blend of jazz, classical and new music. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm kind of a maverick," the 44-year-old multi-reedman said recently in his 
Culver City apartment. "I'm not closely aligned with the jazz tradition, yet 
I'm very aligned with improvisational music, though I'm not aligned with the 
European improvisers." 
</P>
<P>
To make matters more confusing, Golia, who performs tonight with a quintet at 
the Newport Harbor Art Museum, plays in a number of formats, ranging from the 
18-piece ensemble with some of the Southland's most respected jazz and 
classical musicians to bass-horn duos. 
</P>
<P>
"With the large ensemble, we play contemporary classical chamber music that 
sometimes has a 4/4 beat. In smaller groups, like the quintet, you'll hear a 
lot of jazz elements, but I wouldn't really call it jazz," Golia said. "What 
you get is 50% composition and 50% player. But it is, in a manner, part of 
extending the tradition. We know about Johnny Dodds, but we also know about 
Albert Ayler." 
</P>
<P>
Those familiar with Golia's surprisingly accessible 1989 quintet recording "Out 
for Blood" (on Golia's own Nine Winds label) will find significant difference 
in tonight's performance. The recording had Golia sharing the front line with 
assertive trombonist Mike Vlatkovich. In Newport, Golia instead will be joined 
by internationally respected trumpeter Bobby Bradford, and the program includes 
music written specifically to match Bradford's punchy, to-the-point style with 
Golia's array of instruments and tonal colors. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob and I have been playing together on and off for years, in groups with 
(clarinetist) John Carter and such. We've wanted to play together in a small 
group but couldn't find the opportunity until now. Because the trumpet's a less 
mutable instrument than the trombone, we should get a real jazz sound." The 
other members of the quintet will include pianist Tad Weed, bassist Ken Filiano 
and drummer Billy Minitz. 
</P>
<P>
Golia's eclectic tastes in music give some insight into his compositional 
style. 
</P>
<P>
"What I own is mostly classical, jazz and ethnic -- I hate that term -- let's 
call it music from other cultures. I'm a fan of chamber music and smaller," 
Golia said. "Symphonies are a little bit overwhelming for me at the moment. I 
like a lot of Bach and especially Brahms because of the way he takes melody 
phrases and just keeps working them all through the piece. I'm trying to deal 
with that in my own writing. And, of course, there's Bartok, Debussy and 
Ravel." 
</P>
<P>
Modern classical and new music composers are another source of inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
Said Golia: "I'm a big fan of (Edgar) Varese, (Gyorgy) Ligeti (whose choral 
pieces were used in the soundtrack to "2001: A Space Odyssey) and (Krzysztof) 
Penderecki," known for unusual instrumentation, such as matching harpsichord 
with electric guitar. "And I like Elliot Carter and Lou Harrison ," some of 
whose string quartets have been recorded by the Kronos Quartet. "But right now 
I seem to crave Varese and Stravinsky." 
</P>
<P>
Golia grew up in the Bronx, where his mother listened to classical and 
country-Western music while his father was into Louie Armstrong and Sidney 
Bechet. With no thought of becoming a musician, he studied art at the New York 
Institute of Technology, spending his evenings in jazz clubs sketching the 
players. 
</P>
<P>
But his career plans took a turn one evening in a club in Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy who was playing saxophone got drunk or loaded or something and 
couldn't play," Golia recalled. "So I asked if I could take over." 
</P>
<P>
There was just one catch. Golia had never even handled a saxophone. 
</P>
<P>
"I ended up doing all this stuff I'd imagined trying to do," he said. "I'm sure 
it sounded terrible. But they didn't seem to mind." 
</P>
<P>
Largely self-taught on all the instruments he plays, Golia says that the four 
lessons he took from outside saxophonist and composer Anthony Braxton supplied 
a lot of motivation. 
</P>
<P>
"My lessons with him were spent learning scales and fundamentals and talking a 
lot about the music," Golia said. "I was totally unprepared for the second 
lesson. He told me, 'There's nothing I can do with you because you didn't do 
last week's lesson. You've gone to school for painting and drawing, and you 
know how to do that. But you have to learn the technique of the horn too.' " 
</P>
<P>
It's easier to list which wind instruments Golia doesn't play than those he 
does. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't play any oboe, and I don't play any alto saxophone," he said. "To 
really play the alto, you have to do a lot of sliding with the tone, that 
Johnny Hodges kind of thing. But with a lot of instruments I play, like the 
soprano, you have to be precise and hit the note square. I don't want to deal 
with the difference. I tried the oboe about four times and couldn't get the 
right sound out of it." 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the instruments I play are natural enemies of each other, like the 
clarinet is the natural enemy of the flute because the embouchure is so 
different. Switching from the bass clarinet to piccolo is a very large 
adjustment. So you have to practice in such a way that you can keep the flow 
going." 
</P>
<P>
What instruments will he playing in Newport? 
</P>
<P>
"With Bob, I think it'll be mainly soprano, flute, bass clarinet and baritone 
and some ethnic stuff like the shakuhachi (a traditional Japanese wind 
instrument) and the khene, a Thai instrument a friend bought for me at the 
Bodhi Tree on Melrose. Bob had this dream that we were playing in a small group 
and that I was playing a lot of baritone, so I'm definitely going to have the 
baritone out there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vinny Golia Quintet plays tonight at 8 at the Newport Harbor Art Museum, 
850 San Clemente Drive, Newport Beach. Admission: $5.50 to $7.50. Information:

<P>
A couple of Orange County-based rock acts are scheduled to have videos debut on 
MTV. 
</P>
<P>
"Gettin' Close To God" by National People's Gang debuts this weekend on the 
"120 Minutes" alternative-rock video program, which runs from 11:30 p.m. Sunday 
to 1:30 a.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The video includes live concert footage shot at the Coach House in San Juan 
Capistrano, plus an appearance by the band's manager, former Safari Sam's 
impresario Sam Lanni. 
</P>
<P>
On April 7, "Bombers (Can Open Bomb Bays)," from the debut solo album by former 
Black Sabbath member Bill Ward, will air on MTV's "Headbangers Ball" show, 
which runs from midnight to early Sunday morning, April 8. 
</P>
<P>
"Bombers" uses a good deal of wartime footage in making a socially conscious 
comment that's a rarity for heavy-metal clips. Split-screen effects showcase 
performances by Ward on drums and his old band mate, Ozzy Osbourne, on vocals.

PACIFIC SYMPHONY TO BACK UP MANNHEIM STEAMROLLER IN IRVINE

The Pacific Symphony will back Mannheim Steamroller, a five-member group that 
combines rock, pop, classical and Muzak influences, at the Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheatre June 23. Chip Davis, Mannheim's founder, drummer and leader, will 
conduct. 
</P>
<P>
It's a departure for the 11-year-old orchestra, which normally plays straight 
classical and light pops fare, but its director of marketing, John MacElwee, 
said he does not think the booking is a sign of things to come. 
</P>
<P>
"It's basically an orchestra-for-hire situation," MacElwee said Friday. The 
Pacific was booked through Avalon Attractions, which manages the amphitheater, 
and "as in any kind of a booking situation, when they called the Pacific 
Symphony and hired the entire orchestra, they need to use our name," MacElwee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a fairly high amount of contract services through the (Orange County 
Performing Arts) Center," he continued. "So we're used to utilizing the 
orchestra for contracted services. But we have a good mix (at the Center) right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
The members of Mannheim Steamroller play everything from lutes, harpsichords 
and recorders to synthesizers, electronic percussion and digital samplers. The 
group often performs with pit bands or orchestras. The Irvine Meadows show will 
be its only Southern California performance. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Pacific Symphony will give two free concerts for selected Orange 
County high school students Monday at Plummer Auditorium in Fullerton. 
Attendance is being determined by individual school districts. Lucas Richman 
will conduct music by Vivaldi, Handel, Mozart, Mendelssohn and other composers. 
The concerts are being sponsored by Pacific Telesis Foundation and the 
California Community Foundation.

CAPISTRANO VALLEY SYMPHONY NAMES SCHARF AS MUSIC DIRECTOR; 
</P>
<P>
APPOINTMENT: THE ISRAELI-BORN CONDUCTOR SUCCEEDS THE LATE DONN LAURENCE MILLS, 
WHO WAS FOUNDING MUSIC DIRECTOR OF THE ORCHESTRA.

<P>
Israeli-born conductor Dov Alexander Scharf, 37, was named music director of 
the Capistrano Valley Symphony on Friday, succeeding founding music director 
Donn Laurence Mills, who died of meningitis Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Scharf conducted the orchestra earlier this month in pops concerts in Dana 
Point, and said Friday that "after (those) concerts, I have determined that the 
Capistrano Valley Symphony can be developed into a fine orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
He hopes to restore the classical programming that largely was abandoned for 
pops in 1987 after the orchestra ran into financial trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Born and raised in Holon, Israel, Scharf studied conducting with Daniel Lewis 
at USC. For three years, he has been music director of the Dietersheimer 
Chamber Orchestra in Munich, West Germany. He said he will relocate to Los 
Angeles, where his parents live, or to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The Capistrano Valley Symphony was formed by Mills in January, 1985, but 
quickly ran into problems raising money and finding adequate concert 
facilities. Several concerts were canceled before the group switched to its 
pops format. Scharf said he hopes to initiate a winter-spring classical season, 
but will preserve a summer pops series. 
</P>
<P>
Scharf said the orchestra's budget is not finalized but is likely to fall 
between $150,000 and $280,000. He said his salary is still being negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he is looking for suitable concert sites. "We do have three or four 
good possibilities," he said. The orchestra has been playing at the Dana Point 
Resort and at the Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
Next up for the orchestra is a five-concert summer pops series at the Dana 
Point Resort, May 20, June 17, July 15, Aug. 19 and Sept. 16. Information: 
(714) 240-8584.

STUDENT SLEUTHS GUMSHOE THROUGH ATLANTIC CITY TO RATE ITS HOSPITALITY; 
</P>
<P>

1/2-PINEAPPLE SCORE AFTER RUN-INS WITH A JITNEY DRIVER AND A WAITRESS.

<P>
The jitney driver in Atlantic City, N.J., who snarled at Geraldine Reynoso when 
she took up an extra seat on his local bus would have been wise to hold his 
tongue. His words would come back to haunt him. 
</P>
<P>
Reynoso, as it turned out, was a detective. Hospitality detective, that is. 
</P>
<P>
She and a dozen fellow honors students at Johnson &amp; Wales University were 
in the resort recently to sample restaurants, hotels, transportation, casinos 
-- all the city had to offer its visitors. 
</P>
<P>
When the sleuthing was done, a press conference was called and the hospitality 
verdict delivered: 3 1/2 pineapples. 
</P>
<P>
On a scale of one to five pineapples (the students' symbols of hospitality), 
that was not bad. But the marketing director for the Atlantic City Convention 
and Visitors Bureau said it clearly showed room for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"We are talking to the jitney association to see if they can spruce up their 
temperaments a bit," John Fox said. "We're in a strong state of transition 
here. There is no excuse for not being polite, but I think we have some of the 
same problems as big cities do around the country." 
</P>
<P>
Atlantic City was the first to be officially put to the test by the students at 
Johnson &amp; Wales, a school based in Providence that specializes in travel, 
tourism and culinary arts. 
</P>
<P>
It will not be the last, though. The students plan to visit about 20 cities 
with well-established tourism industries or plans to develop them. Ultimately, 
their efforts will yield a book informing readers whether a town offers 
top-drawer service (five pineapples) or is a traveler's nightmare (one 
pineapple). 
</P>
<P>
"The 1980s was a marketing era," said Paul Lacroix, chairman of the Travel 
&amp; Tourism Department at Johnson &amp; Wales and the guiding force behind 
"America's Most Hospitable Cities Survey." 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone went marketing," he said. "Now we have the customers, and my question 
to students is, 'What do we do with them?' I think the '90s is going to be an 
era of service. I think it's a very natural follow-up to what has happened in 
the '80s." 
</P>
<P>
Lacroix began toying with the idea of a national hospitality survey in the 
fall; students developed the mechanism in class work. 
</P>
<P>
They tried it out in Providence, a city trying to build tourism, then modified 
it considerably before setting off for Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson &amp; Wales sent four faculty advisers and 13 students to the resort 
city, where the students were set loose. 
</P>
<P>
"I call them my SWAT team," Lacroix said. "They're my pineapple SWAT team." 
</P>
<P>
Students stopped at nearly 700 restaurants, casinos, hotels and other tourist 
attractions and racked up 1,748 "service encounters." 
</P>
<P>
Reynoso, from River Vale, N.J., said the casinos, hotels and tourist 
attractions such as historic Smithville made Atlantic City worth the trip. But 
she and other students discovered several service problems. 
</P>
<P>
Reynoso had a brusque encounter with the driver of a jitney, a small bus 
resembling a milk truck that is common in Atlantic City. The driver became 
angry when Reynoso's easels and packages took up an extra seat. 
</P>
<P>
Another group of students recalled that a waitress mocked them because she 
thought the tip they left was inadequate. The students were actually not 
finished and planned to leave more, Reynoso said. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked it attraction-wise, but for service it was around average," Reynoso 
said. "They could use a lot more training." 
</P>
<P>
Student sleuths each spent $300 to $400 of university money checking out the 
city, making them the envy of a number of fellow students back in Providence. 
</P>
<P>
But, Reynoso said, the survey was more work than they could have imagined. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very tired," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Students involved in the hospitality survey kept a daily log and reported on 
each service encounter. At the end of the weekend, they called a press 
conference, gave their pineapple rating and discussed their findings. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the review was quite fair," Fox said. "Atlantic City is a city in 
strong transition." 
</P>
<P>
Lacroix declined to say where the next hospitality survey will take place but 
revealed that it will probably be in New England. 
</P>
<P>
The program will concentrate on smaller cities such as Worcester, Mass.; 
Hartford, Conn.; Portland, Maine; Manchester, N.H., and Newport, R.I., before 
taking on Atlanta, Los Angeles, New York and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Lacroix expects that the guidebook based on the visits will be as helpful to 
the service industry and the cities as it is to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, one like it does not exist," he said. "There are a lot of 
articles in terms of service quality slipping in America, but nothing as far as 
an organized program like this."

COUNTY RENOVATION OF HISTORIC MODJESKA CANYON HOME LEADS TO A SERIES OF 
SURPRISING DISCOVERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN LOGAN, Dan Logan is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shakespeare didn't have palm trees and California live oaks in mind when he 
imagined the forest in "As You Like It." Yet when Polish actress Helena 
Modjeska settled in a wooded canyon bordering Santiago Creek in 1888, she 
declared its quiet groves her own Forest of Arden. 
</P>
<P>
Today, more than a hundred years later, Modjeska Canyon remains rural and 
isolated, dead silent between the sporadic rasp of power saws from building 
crews on the hill and the whistle of occasional jets passing overhead. A black 
pygmy goat named Shadow and his dog pal, Bear, gambol about the grounds of 
Modjeska's one-time home. 
</P>
<P>
The Modjeska property has proved to be a historical laboratory that has yielded 
surprises and continuing puzzles. Although Modjeska and her husband, Count 
Karol Bozenta Chlapowski (who preferred to be called Mr. Bozenta), were the 
home's most famous owners, the site played a significant role in Orange County 
history both before and after their time. 
</P>
<P>
Two recent events have focused attention on Modjeska and her Orange County 
years. First, Richard Hellesen's play "Once in Arden," which will be performed 
at South Coast Repertory April 20 through May 24, looks at Modjeska near the 
end of her acting career. 
</P>
<P>
Second, the county is revitalizing the Modjeska house and its 14.4-acre 
grounds, which the county purchased in 1986 for $1 million from the Walker 
family of Long Beach. Late next year, it will open a new Modjeska Historic 
Park, the focal point of which will be the white bungalow where Modjeska and 
Bozenta lived when they weren't traveling around the country on one of 
Modjeska's demanding acting tours. 
</P>
<P>
Modjeska was considered one of the great actresses of her time, on a par with 
Sarah Bernhardt. She came to the United States as an unknown and built a 
reputation on the American stage as a fine Shakespearean actress. 
</P>
<P>
She was also something of a free spirit. 
</P>
<P>
She and her manager, Gustave Sinnmayer Modrzejewski -- whose anglicized name 
she used in her career -- had two children before she left him in 1865, when 
she was 25. 
</P>
<P>
She and Bozenta, who also became her manager, came to the United States in 
1876, during the country's centennial. They and a small group of friends 
attempted to set up a farming commune in Anaheim, says Ellen K. Lee, a South 
Laguna resident and Orange County historian who has researched Modjeska for 
more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The effort failed miserably. 
</P>
<P>
To raise money, Modjeska went to San Francisco, studied English and began a 
career on the American stage that lasted 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
From all accounts, Modjeska and Bozenta were energetic, gregarious people. 
Modjeska loved the theater, art and music. Bozenta was a high-strung, talkative 
intellectual from an aristocratic Polish family. They enjoyed entertaining and 
were generous with their attentions and their money. "Both Modjeska and Bozenta 
had a great gift for friendship," says Lee. 
</P>
<P>
One of Bozenta's friendships was with Joseph Pleasants, a highly regarded ranch 
manager. His wife, Maria Refugio, was a member of a wealthy Mexican family. In 
the early 1870s, the Pleasantses homesteaded a 160-acre parcel in Santiago 
Canyon -- in what is now Modjeska Canyon -- and raised cattle and bees. 
</P>
<P>
Modjeska and Bozenta were frequent visitors to the Pleasantses' small cabin in 
the canyon. Bozenta loved the backcountry, and he and Pleasants often went 
riding and hunting. In 1883, Bozenta bought a half interest in the parcel, 
although he and Modjeska were also building two houses in Poland at the time, 
according to Lee. However, in 1886 they decided that California would be their 
home. In 1887 they purchased the remaining share, possibly because Maria 
Refugio had tuberculosis and the Pleasantses wanted to move to the city. 
</P>
<P>
The connection with the Pleasantses produced some surprises when the county 
began restoring the home. For most of the last 100 years, however, interest 
centered on the design of the house. In her memoirs, Modjeska stated that the 
house had been designed by Stanford White, an illustrious New York architect. 
For years, historians sought to confirm White's involvement with the Modjeska 
home. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the county hired Dr. Leland Roth to pursue the connection between 
White and Modjeska. Roth, a professor of art history at the University of 
Oregon, is an expert on the McKim, Mead &amp; White architectural firm, and his 
catalogue of the firm's work includes a reproduction of the Modjeska house. 
</P>
<P>
Roth says he discovered a short letter White wrote to Bozenta, discussing the 
glass for the house. There were also visual clues that Roth says persuaded him 
of White's involvement even before the discovery of the letter. There's the 
strong horizontal nature of the design, whereas Orange County architecture at 
the time favored the vertical Victorian style. The repetitive gables were also 
an unusual stylistic feature for the greater Los Angeles area of the period. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a very definite connection between Modjeska and White, and he was 
consulted in some capacity on the design of the house. Exactly what that 
capacity was, we don't know," Roth says. 
</P>
<P>
White, from the available evidence, never visited the site. Roth confirms that 
White designed only three residences that stood west of the Missouri River, and 
the Modjeska house is the only one remaining. 
</P>
<P>
More important than the conclusions about White's role was the discovery that 
an older structure was buried within the house. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1989, Thirtieth Street Architects of Newport Beach began an 
emergency stabilization of the foundation of the house. The structure had a 
rock-rubble foundation that had gradually deteriorated over the years, says 
Kathie Matsuyama, senior landscape architect for the county's Environmental 
Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Architectural historian Roger Hatheway, an expert in cultural resource 
management, was called in to monitor the foundation work for any historically 
important artifacts that might be unearthed. At first, nothing very exciting 
turned up in terms of historical value, Hatheway recalls. But when several 
sections of baseboard were removed from the outside of the house, Hatheway's 
assistant contacted him, telling him that they had uncovered what seemed to be 
a wall behind a wall. 
</P>
<P>
Work shut down. 
</P>
<P>
Hatheway spent a week on the site. He wormed his way around the shallow crawl 
space created by the contractors. Under the kitchen, he discovered wide redwood 
planks that didn't follow the pattern of tongue-and-groove construction used in 
the rest of the house. 
</P>
<P>
It was known from old photographs that the Pleasantses' cabin had been on the 
property. Hatheway suspected that the cabin had actually become part of the 
Modjeska house. Before long, he found that one wall of the Modjeska living 
room/library contained what was once a doorway to the Pleasantses' cabin. 
</P>
<P>
"The uncovered doorway matched to the inch the door in one of the early 
photographs of the cabin," Hatheway says. 
</P>
<P>
He established that the cabin was 70% to 80% intact in the walls of the house. 
He continued to strip away the wall. Beneath the outer layers, Hatheway found 
newspapers used as insulation. After photographing them in detail, he covered 
most of them up again, leaving a few exposed for visitors to examine. With a 
flashlight, a visitor can easily read odd bits from papers from 1879 and 1881. 
Lobster then was selling for 8 cents a pound, shrimp 25 cents. 
</P>
<P>
After 1893, when a dining room was added to the house and the interior walls 
were sheathed, no one could have known the cabin was there, Hatheway says. He 
talked with members of the Walker family, and they told him that they had never 
suspected it. 
</P>
<P>
The inclusion of the Pleasantses' cabin within the Modjeska home was a further 
clue that White had a hand in the house's, Roth says, because beach cottages on 
the East Coast designed by McKim, Mead &amp; White had also been built around 
earlier dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
The center of the Modjeska home is the living room/library, Lee explains. Tall 
windows are mounted high on the north wall near the 16-foot cove ceiling. A 
large rock fireplace dominates the room. To the left of the fireplace, the 
initials HM are carved into the lid of a firewood box. In Modjeska's day, a 
buffalo head hung over the fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
The room is finished in redwood, although photos show that during Modjeska's 
time the redwood was covered over with wallpaper. The couple had more than 
2,000 books in several languages, and six-foot bookcases once lined walls that 
have since been opened up or have had windows installed. Paintings by famous 
Polish painters were hung high on the walls to show them to advantage in the 
natural light from the tall windows. The windows still have the original leaded 
glass. 
</P>
<P>
Off a narrow hall, Modjeska's and Bozenta's bedrooms stand side by side, joined 
by a door. Both open onto a wide porch. Off the hall, there's a third bedroom 
and a room for Modjeska's costumes. 
</P>
<P>
The Modjeska house had indoor plumbing but no gas or electricity, says Dan 
Thomas, the Orange County park ranger who oversees the site. The kitchen 
underwent many changes, particularly in the two decades after Modjeska left to 
live the rest of her life in Newport Beach. Off the kitchen is Bozenta's 
office, with a door to the outside that allowed men who worked the property's 
livestock, beehives and olive grove to come in without having to go through the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
The grounds around the home have elicited as much excitement as the house 
itself. The property is thick with California live oaks, redwoods, Jeffrey 
pines and California sycamores. Palm trees line what was once the main 
driveway. Old photographs show the palms were shoulder-high in 1890. Now 
they're 70 feet tall. There's a 120-foot cypress tree that is believed to be 
the tallest cypress in Orange County, according to park ranger Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Modjeska was proud of her garden, says Lee, particularly its roses, and the 
county's restoration plan calls for reviving the garden. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas he brought in Orange County jail trusties to clean up the overgrown 
vegetation in the garden and along the hillside last spring. Under the weeds, 
the inmate crews discovered a stone wall and a wooden staircase leading up to 
Bozenta's 30-acre olive grove. Original walkways were still outlined with 
rocks. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Bozenta expanded his property until he owned more than 1,300 
acres in the canyon, including the 40 acres of what is now the Harding Canyon 
Dam, Lee says. To supply Arden with water, Bozenta built a dam there in 
1900-01. He piped the water down to the estate. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately in front of the house is a well. Don Dobmeier, head of the Orange 
County Historical Commission, has a personal collection of post cards from the 
turn of the century that show Modjeska posing near the well, which was 
overgrown with rose bushes. 
</P>
<P>
At each end of the house is a small concrete pond. A large, shallow swimming 
pool, distinctly kidney-shaped, lies near the creek to the west of the house. 
This was probably Orange County's first swimming pool, says Matsuyama. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the main house, a half-dozen buildings still stand on the 
property. There's a two-bedroom guest house to accommodate visitors who endured 
the 26-mile trip by horse-and-buggy from Anaheim. The original caretaker's 
cabin sits atop a "cold house" where game and food may have been stored. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most curious of the structures on the property is the "Polish milk 
house," a tiny turret of a building with a sweeping conical roof. Polish 
visitors have told Lee that it resembles a Polish shrine with its cross 
missing. Lee adds, however, that in one picture of Bozenta in his vegetable 
garden, the milk house is nearby, and she speculates that it was used to store 
tools and seeds. 
</P>
<P>
By 1906, Modjeska was ill and in straitened financial circumstances. She and 
Bozenta left Arden for Bay Island in Newport Beach, where she spent the last 
three years of her life. Arden was purchased by a syndicate of investors from 
Long Beach, who formed the Modjeska Country Club, Lee recounts. 
</P>
<P>
In 1913, the club was expanded into a resort. In 1916, Don H. Porter bought it 
and formed the Modjeska Ranch Co. to sell off building lots in the canyon. The 
company created a tent city near the bungalow, and a general store was built 
between the main house and the guest house. Prospective buyers would drive up 
to the canyon and stay in the tent city while they looked over the lots. 
</P>
<P>
The house and the grounds next to it were sold to an Austrian couple, the 
Schweigers, in 1918. The Schweigers turned the house into the popular Modjeska 
Inn and Restaurant, but they gave up ownership in 1922. 
</P>
<P>
In 1923, banker Charles J. Walker, who had been one of the original country 
club investors, bought the home for his family's use. The once-extensive estate 
that reached to Santiago Canyon Road and back into what is now Tucker Wildlife 
Sanctuary had dwindled to a few acres. Walker gradually purchased nearby 
parcels, ultimately building the estate back to its current 14.4 acres. Five 
generations of Walkers lived in or used the house over their 63-year ownership 
of it, Lee says. They built a large game room at the east end of the house, 
significantly increasing its size. 
</P>
<P>
The Walkers maintained a zoo with monkeys, deer, peacocks, ostriches, a bear, 
an alligator (which was found downstream after a flood) and other wild animals 
on the property. The bear's den, a flat-topped hole made out of rock, remains. 
</P>
<P>
Matsuyama says she hopes that the home will be open to the public in late 1991. 
An environmental impact report is being completed and should go to the Board of 
Supervisors in the fall. Work on the house exterior is expected to be completed 
in the spring of 1991. Interior work and furnishing the house will take the 
rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
To date, the county has spent more than $400,000 refurbishing the home and its 
gardens, and the bill will reach more than $1 million before the park opens. 
The house has a new foundation, a fresh coat of paint, new electricity and 
plumbing, and well-braced chimneys. When it was re-roofed, workers found five 
layers of roofing, Hatheway says. New roofing has been applied over the older 
layers. 
</P>
<P>
The county's plans for the park angered many nearby residents who argued that 
the narrow canyon road still lined with Bozenta's olive trees was a playground 
for their children and animals. They said there was inadequate room for 
visitors to park their cars. 
</P>
<P>
After a number of meetings last fall, a citizens' advisory committee was 
formed, which helped resolve the conflicts, Matsuyama says. Each year, the 
committee will help the county evaluate how the park is operating. 
</P>
<P>
To minimize the impact of the park on canyon residents, Matsuyama says, there 
will be no visitor parking near the Modjeska home. The county will run a 
shuttle, available by reservation only, into the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The starting point for public tours will be the white cottage, a small house 
across the creek from the Modjeska house. The white cottage will serve as an 
interpretive center, and there will be a small amphitheater for schoolchildren. 
A footbridge will cross Santiago Creek, leading to the Modjeska home. 
</P>
<P>
The restoration of the park buildings will continue for a number of years, 
Matsuyama says. Even then, the end may not be written to the story of the 
Modjeska home. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the world, there are bits and pieces of the Modjeska estate that 
could one day be returned to Modjeska Canyon for display. There may still be 
letters containing further clues as to why the Pleasantses' home was enclosed 
within the Modjeska home. 
</P>
<P>
It's even possible that Stanford White's plans for the house are still tucked 
away in an as-yet-undiscovered tube of architectural drawings. 
</P>
<P>
SWIMMING POOL: Kidney-shaped, about four feet deep and 60 feet long, was the 
first known pool in Orange County 
</P>
<P>
GARDEN REVIVAL: Modjeska loved her rose garden, which was crossed by a gravel 
path marked with stones. 
</P>
<P>
OLIVE GROVE: Count Bozenta would climb a flight of wooden steps to his olive 
grove, which covered 30 acres. 
</P>
<P>
WELL: In front of house, drawing water from Santiago Creek. Post cards from 
turn of century show Modjeska posing against rose-covered wall. 
</P>
<P>
WHITE COTTAGE: Will serve as interpretive center and parking area. Will be set 
near pond and walkways leading through grounds. 
</P>
<P>
MODJESKA HOUSE: Where Helena Modjeska asnd Count Bozenta lived, backs up to a 
hillside and stands in a thick grove of trees. 
</P>
<P>
BEAR'S DEN: A flat-topped concrete hole in the ground is all that remains of 
the Walker family's private zoo. 
</P>
<P>
POLISH MILK HOUSE: This tiny building with its graceful conical roof has been 
moved around the property several times since the Modjeska era. 
</P>
<P>
FOOT-BRIDGE: Will cross Santiago Creek, leading visitors from the white cottage 
to the Modjeskahome. 
</P>
<P>
MEADOW: A path will circle the large, open meadow so that visotors can stroll 
the quiet grounds. The meadow supports a surprising number of plant species, 
which will be identified for visitors. 
</P>
<P>
STONE STAIRS: Will lead to an outlook over the meadow, where visitors will have 
a view of the surrounding hills.

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: PADDLEBOARDER CHURNS OUT AQUATIC SAGA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Newport Beach paddleboarder extraordinaire Larry Capune has been making 
newspaper headlines for more than 25 years with his long-distance adventures 
along the nation's coastline. 
</P>
<P>
"It's One Man Against the Sea," proclaims one headline from the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
"Killer Whale, Shark, Nudist and Ron Ziegler Mark Trip," says one from the 
'70s. 
</P>
<P>
"Paddler Ducks Sharks, Freighter," says another from the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the frequent paddler has logged some 19,000 miles on his 10 major 
paddling trips, the most recent in 1987: a 165-day, 4,090-mile odyssey from 
Chicago to Washington (across the Great Lakes, up the St. Lawrence River and 
down the Atlantic Coast). 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, Capune has been bitten by a sea turtle, a bluefish and a dog. He 
has been mistaken for a target by the Army off Ft. Ord, and he has delayed a 
missile launching at Vandenberg Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
He also has been hit by a tanker once and by freighters twice. And he has been 
hit in the head by a Coke bottle tossed by a fishing pier owner who claimed he 
was scaring the fish. (The gash in Capune's head required 25 stitches.) 
Traveling on a shoestring budget and carrying only a waterproof knapsack, 
Capune usually depends on the kindness of strangers whenever he puts in for the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
There have been times he has been greeted with keys to cities and put up in 
fancy hotel suites. Other times he has slept on the beach, burying himself in 
the sand to keep the bugs and mosquitoes away. 
</P>
<P>
But mostly he stays with families who offer to take him in. The most memorable 
stopover was in Hyannis Port, Mass., where Rose Kennedy wrapped the discouraged 
and freezing paddleboarder in a blanket and encouraged him not to give up on 
his goal. Capune spent three days with the Kennedys, and Ethel Kennedy invited 
him to stop in the next time he came by. (He did.) 
</P>
<P>
There are enough experiences to fill a book. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, someone told Capune in the early '70s that he ought to start writing 
it all down, lest he forget the details of his many adventures. 
</P>
<P>
He began writing in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen years later, he's still at it. 
</P>
<P>
"This is it," he said, pulling a typewritten page out of his electric 
typewriter. "Right now I'm on Page 5,388 -- Chapter 256." 
</P>
<P>
Stacked in a corner of his small desk are the completed pages of his two 
decades of writing -- all done with two fingers, hunt-and-peck-style. 
</P>
<P>
The manuscript -- a rainbow of different-colored pages -- measures 25 1/2 
inches high. 
</P>
<P>
It's enough to make even the prolific James Michener blanch. 
</P>
<P>
A natural-born storyteller, Capune has been lecturing about his trips at 
elementary, junior high and high schools for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
He's talkative and opinionated -- a self-confident kind of guy who has braved 
sharks and killer whales, survived being lost at sea 13 times and twice been 
found unconscious and nearly frozen. 
</P>
<P>
But Capune knows his own limits: "I'm not a writer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
What he is looking for, he said, is an experienced ghostwriter who can take his 
unwieldly manuscript -- misspellings and all -- and turn it into a book. Or 
several books. 
</P>
<P>
As he says: "My life is more than one book." 
</P>
<P>
Because the narrative of his trips is so episodic, Capune thinks his story also 
would lend itself to a TV series. Or a movie. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he said, he has a film excerpt from his appearance on the old "I've 
Got a Secret" TV show in which the first thing out of panelist Steve Allen's 
mouth is: "This sounds like a movie!" 
</P>
<P>
As Capune sees it, he has something unique to offer: "No one else in the world 
does what I do." 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "Larry Lifeguard" by Sports Illustrated, Capune was a lifeguard for the 
state of California in 1963 when he made his first trip on a paddleboard: He 
paddled home to Newport Beach from Carpinteria, south of Santa Barbara (147 
miles in four days). 
</P>
<P>
Except for a touch of gray, the muscular Capune still looks the part of the 
quintessential California lifeguard with sun-bleached blond hair and a toothy 
grin. And at 47, he still goes barefoot and is seldom seen in anything other 
than shorts and T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
He lives in a rented, '30s-vintage house on lower Balboa Peninsula with his 
twin brother, Marty, a film location manager. 
</P>
<P>
Capune makes his living as a lifeguard in Dover Shores and by lecturing at 
school assemblies, sometimes as many as eight a month. 
</P>
<P>
In detailing his exploits to students, he delivers a motivational, anti-drug 
message: "My message is to take an adventure instead of drugs: You can do 
anything if you think you can." And he tells them to "put purpose before purse: 
It's not how much you get for doing something; it's what you do" that counts. 
</P>
<P>
Because his lecture bookings have fallen off a bit lately, Capune has been able 
to devote more time to his manuscript. 
</P>
<P>
He writes almost every morning, putting in at least three hours a day. He's on 
his second typewriter since he started; he wore out the first. 
</P>
<P>
With a navigational chart propped up in front of him and his logbook next to 
his typewriter, Capune is able, he said, to conjure up the feelings and details 
of his trips. And he's making headway in completing his aquatic saga. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm only 70 days away from being at the end of the last trip," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Capune still maintains a rigorous training regimen, paddling for at least an 
hour in the open ocean "not once in awhile, not five days out of seven," he 
said. "In rain, shine, fog -- no matter what, because how can I tell the kids I 
do something if I don't do it? Even if I'm sick, I go." 
</P>
<P>
He's not sure when his next trip will be, but he's got an idea: paddling up the 
Mississippi River. "I figure a dead cockroach can go down the Mississippi; why 
not go up? That's more of a challenge," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That, of course, would be another chapter.

The Orange County Hazardous Materials Team, administered by the county Health 
Care Agency division of environmental health, responds to calls on chemical 
spills and other incidents involving hazardous materials. Sometimes it goes to 
the site, other times it advises citizens or local fire departments over the 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
Of 17 local fire departments in Orange County (16 city departments plus the 
county), three have hazardous materials units that cover the county through 
mutual aid agreements -- Anaheim, Huntington Beach and the county station in 
Irvine. HAZMAT is called in most, but not all, incidents. Following is HAZMAT's 
spill response log for JANUARY.

$5-MILLION CAMPAIGN OPENS FOR HOMELESS;

AT HOME

About 50 community and business leaders attended a dinner party Wednesday to 
start a $5-million fund-raising drive for the South Orange County YWCA Hotel 
for Women, a shelter for homeless women in Santa Ana. The low-key get-together 
filled a few plush, white-carpeted central rooms in Sandy and Betsy Sanders' 
Anaheim Hills home -- the first of a series of consciousness- and money-raising 
events dubbed "Great Homes for the Homeless." 
</P>
<P>
"That name is a little embarrassing, isn't it?" Betsy Sanders said. "I don't 
take it to mean 'look at my great home,' but in the sense of reminding us all 
of how much we have. If we have a home, a job, the self-confidence it takes to 
maintain a job -- if we have all of that, we're very lucky. 
</P>
<P>
"Every home is a great home," the hostess said. 
</P>
<P>
(And her great home -- an "estate," according to a realtor's full-color flyer 
untucked from Sandy's roll-top desk -- is for sale.) 
</P>
<P>
Guests parked on the street and rode a limo up the short, albeit steep, 
driveway.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
At Issue 
</P>
<P>
The Hotel for Women is a 38-bed facility that houses and feeds homeless women 
for up to 60 days and provides assistance programs, including psychological 
counseling, medical and legal referrals and employment guidance and training. 
With the "Great Homes" campaign, management and supporters of the 3-year-old 
shelter hope to create an endowment fund to meet long-term financial needs. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Douglas, the South Orange County YWCA executive director, said the hotel 
runs on a $250,000 annual budget, less than $50,000 of which comes from local, 
state and federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to provide a model program, and to do that we need a lot of money 
(from the private sector)," Douglas said. "I get the impression that people 
think the problem of homelessness is going away. In fact, the reverse is true." 
</P>
<P>
"This community has been extremely generous," said Arlene Sontag, president of 
the YWCA board. "We burned our ($1.1-million) mortgage after just two years -- 
one of the bank vice presidents came down and lit the match -- so I think that 
says something about the generosity here. But I'm not sure operations and 
maintenance is quite as glamorous as building a building. This may be a little 
tougher to raise money for." 
</P>
<P>
Sandi Weber, a member of the campaign leadership, said organizers hope to raise 
half of the projected $5 million by the end of the year. "This year," Weber 
said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Homemade 
</P>
<P>
Betsy Sanders did her own cooking -- with a little help from Jeanne Dorsey, who 
cooks for hotel residents. "We're going Southwest tonight," said Sanders, who 
was busy at the burners when she wasn't hostessing. "Let's see, we're having 
Mexican chicken Kiev, corn pudding, zucchini a la question mark and salad a la 
double question mark -- that's salad with oranges and onions and pecans and a 
raspberry vinaigrette." Peeking into the oven, Dorsey said, "I'm doing the 
Mexican Jewish chicken and the pudding. I'm calling it 
corn-with-a-sense-of-humor pudding." 
</P>
<P>
In shorts and a sweat shirt, Chris Sanders, 19, tended bar for his parents. As 
he explained to one guest: "If I'd been hired, I probably couldn't have dressed 
like this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Who Was There 
</P>
<P>
Cocktailing and dining on Southwest with a sense of humor were Orange County 
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley and his wife, Emma Jane, chairwoman of the 
fund-raising campaign; Bob Chesney and Gay Kroll, who produced a 10-minute 
videotape about the shelter -- which played continuously in the Sanders den -- 
for use in soliciting contributions; hotel director Dianne Russell; retired 
Superior Court judge Judy Ryan; Bill and Betty Palmer; Ted and Marilyn Parker; 
Jon and Camie McClintock; Roger and Barbara Allensworth, and George and Joan 
Dashiell.

DANA CARVEY MAKES THE COMIC-ACTOR CROSSOVER; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: THE BOYISH COMEDIAN OF 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' FAME TRIES HIS FUNNY-MAN 
TALENTS ON THE BIG SCREEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dana Carvey, who makes his film debut in "Opportunity Knocks," is being 
interviewed as a movie star, not as a member of the comic ensemble of "Saturday 
Night Live." But old habits are hard to break. You ask him if he plans to leave 
the venerable late-night show in pursuit of a Hollywood career, and suddenly 
George Bush is answering. 
</P>
<P>
"Not gonna do it. Wouldn't be prudent." 
</P>
<P>
And how does he feel audiences will react to his character in "Opportunity 
Knocks"? The voice that answers belongs to Garth, Carvey's "nerdy surfer dude 
and loyal sidekick" in the new SNL segment, "Wayne's World." 
</P>
<P>
"Excellent! He shoots! He scores!" says Carvey/Garth. 
</P>
<P>
Between unprompted mini-skits, the impish-looking Carvey will tell you that he 
is, in fact, marveling at his success. "When I first started out, I just copied 
Dan Aykroyd's imitation of (Jimmy) Carter in my stand-up, and now -- 13 years 
later -- to be the guy doing Bush is cool," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Carvey jumps up suddenly to show off an official-looking piece of stationery 
that is engraved simply: "The President." The message reads: "John, Have now 
seen both 'Saturday Night Live' tapes. The guy is improving on his 
entertainment 'thing.' GB" 
</P>
<P>
It's a note, he explains, from the president to his nephew that somehow made 
its way into Carvey's hands. 
</P>
<P>
The boy next door re-surfaces: "That's kinda neat, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
It seems a lot of people think Carvey is pretty neat, too. 
</P>
<P>
The telephone at his Encino home never seems to stop ringing, with requests for 
his zany presence on such shows as "Today," where he made an appearance 
Tuesday, and "The Tonight Show," where he showed up Thursday. But it wasn't 
always this way for the "Saturday Night Live" star. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just dismissed a lot,' Carvey said. "I looked so innocent and boyish 
that no one thought of casting me as a comedian." He slips into a Hollywood 
agent-type patter: "A big belly is funny. Bald is funny. An overbite is funny. 
Big ears are funny. Short is funny. Too tall is funny. You are not funny!" 
</P>
<P>
He attributes being miscast as a naive, straight man in several television 
pilots and series to "looking like Huck Finn." 
</P>
<P>
"When I came to Hollywood I was 25, but I looked like a fetus with tennis 
shoes," Carvey explains. 
</P>
<P>
In the years since then no wrinkles or gray hairs appear to have set in, but 
Carvey is no longer being offered the innocent, boy-next-door roles. After 
playing a colorless character in the short-lived TV series, "One of the Boys," 
with Mickey Rooney, a mime waiter in the rock movie spoof, "This is Spinal 
Tap," and being edited out of the Sean Penn movie "Racing With the Moon," 
Carvey is ready for some recognition. 
</P>
<P>
Known best for his quirky "Saturday Night Live" characters -- the priggish 
Church Lady and the arrogant Teutonic bodybuilder Hans, Carvey has just 
embarked on the same crossover journey undertaken by a host of SNL comedians 
before him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's entry-level movie stardom," Carvey says. 
</P>
<P>
His starring vehicle is a fairly ambitious role. In "Opportunity Knocks," which 
opened Friday, Carvey plays likeable con man Eddie Farrell, a two-bit hood from 
the south side of Chicago. Farrell pulls off the ultimate "con" by convincing a 
wealthy Chicago family that he really is a Harvard-educated whiz kid/wine 
connoisseur/ladies' man and wooing the family's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
The role is that of a leading man, but Carvey does dot the dramatic landscape 
with some familiar SNL signs, doing an impersonation of George Bush, a stint as 
a wildman rocker, and a host of ethnic accents. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he pulled it off with great panache, actually," said the film's 
director Donald Petrie. "He's also a good actor as well as a funny man." 
</P>
<P>
Said Carvey's co-star actor Robert Loggia: "I think he's going to have a 
helluva career. He's likeable and I think that's something that can't be 
manufactured. You look in those baby blue eyes and see that pixie smile and you 
say 'This guy is all right.' " 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the "Saturday Night Live" star exudes likability from the moment he 
invites a reporter into his home, extending a steaming mug of tea. While 
thoughtfully mulling over his career choices, he slips into accents and 
impersonations as easily as someone might slip on a sweater. Take "Bat 
Rainman," for instance: "Yeah, gotta get the Joker. 'Course I'm an excellent 
Caped Crusader. Yeah." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike SNL predecessors Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd, who have ventured into 
dramatic roles, Carvey wants to concentrate on what he does best: comedy. 
</P>
<P>
"My main thing is I just wanna be funny," Carvey said. "I'll leave it to De 
Niro and Meryl Streep to hug blocks of ice, play dead, or wake up on the 
kitchen floor drenched in sweat in the fetal position, screaming 'I am not an 
animal!' " 
</P>
<P>
"I thought at 34 and after three years on 'Saturday Night Live' I really wanted 
to try to do a first movie," he said. "It was a better script than most scripts 
I've read and I wanted to do something more as myself for the first movie." 
</P>
<P>
He has no illusions that this is his "Citizen Kane." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a film that's going to hold up well under intense scrutiny," he said. 
"I mean, film students probably shouldn't write papers about it. It's a light 
romantic comedy." 
</P>
<P>
Carvey says his next role -- in the film "Beverly Hills Ninja" set to start 
filming in June -- will be light years away from this movie. 
</P>
<P>
"It's avant-garde, new-wave comedy" in the style of Peter Sellers, Carvey said. 
</P>
<P>
Carvey has also gotten offers for a film starring his Church Lady character, 
but dismisses those as "a short career. That's 15 minutes of fame for sure." 
</P>
<P>
But, don't get him wrong. That self-righteous Satan basher will still be around 
on "Saturday Night Live" episodes to excoriate celebrities and prattle on about 
the insidious "Prince of Darkness." 
</P>
<P>
"I like the character, I'm very proud of it," Carvey said. "It was kind of 
satisfying because a lot of comedians had done either a priest or an evangelist 
. . . but no one had done those women behind the punch bowl: those women in 
orthopedic shoes, very androgynous, short hair, asexual, very judgmental." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Carvey says he plans to stay on "Saturday Night Live" for as long as 
they'll have him, or at least for another season, when his five-year contract 
runs out. 
</P>
<P>
"After struggling 10 years as a stand-up, to get on "Saturday Night Live" . . . 
I never just wanted to do 10 shows, get a hit character and bounce out of 
there," Carvey says. "You look back on people that have done three, four, five 
seasons there and they have a legacy that they can be proud of. . . . I feel 
like I would just love to be connected to that whole legacy. And hopefully next 
year will be my best year." 
</P>
<P>
So, where does he see himself in another 10 years? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, probably on Hollywood Boulevard in a tattered dress holding my hand out 
saying (in a quavering voice) 'Isn't that special?' Hoping for a quarter, a 
dime or a nickel. People would say: 'Who's that?' 'Oh, he used to be the Church 
Lady.' "
