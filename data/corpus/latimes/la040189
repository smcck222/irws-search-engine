STUNNING CLAIM UNDOES HIS CALM LIFE; 
</P>
<P>
SHOCK WAVE OF NOTORIETY SWAMPS FUSION SCIENTIST 
</P>

<P>
The scientist whose name is mentioned these days with Edison and Einstein came 
to his front door in a rugby shirt, stocking feet and bad mood. "I can't find 
my slides," B. Stanley Pons snapped. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the slides were missing, the ones Pons had used to illustrate nuclear 
fusion. Somebody apparently stole them in the chaos that followed a press 
conference here last week in which Pons and a British colleague announced that 
they had sustained fusion energy at room temperature using a simple table-top 
device. 
</P>
<P>
Their extraordinary claim -- a potential breakthrough in science's dream to 
someday use non-polluting seawater instead of fossil fuels for the world's 
energy needs -- landed like an A-bomb and caught Pons squarely in its shock 
waves. 
</P>
<P>
Not only have his slides disappeared. So too has any semblance of a normal 
life. The 46-year-old electrochemistry professor from the University of Utah is 
hounded day and night by reporters. Students want his autograph. Other 
scientists from across the globe are clamoring for his research data. 
</P>
<P>
And, if all that were not enough, many in oil-depressed Utah already are 
banking on Pons and his findings to save the state economically. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Norm Bangerter intends to haul Utah's legislators into special session 
next week to give Pons $5 million for research so that Utah can begin to 
capitalize on nuclear fusion. James C. Fletcher, a former University of Utah 
president, who announced earlier that he is quitting his post as NASA 
administrator, will come back here to the "U.," as it is known locally, to lead 
the college's fight for fusion. 
</P>
<P>
"Before this, most people . . . thought of Utah as that funny state between 
Colorado and the West Coast," observed U. chemistry professor Rick Steiner. 
"Now, I think, we're going to see things happen. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
No doubt the talk is premature until the work is confirmed. At least nine other 
research groups are trying to replicate the results. "This had better work," 
said one University of Utah professor, who asked to remain anonymous. "Because 
if it doesn't work, this department, this university and that man are going to 
be laughingstocks." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stuff of Nobel Prizes 
</P>
<P>
But in the corridors of the Henry Eyring Chemistry Building, there is 
speculation that Pons' work -- assuming it withstands the scrutiny of his peers 
-- is the stuff of Nobel Prizes. 
</P>
<P>
For the normally low-key professor, who wears glasses, a Julius Caesar haircut 
and has spent the bulk of his life cradled in laboratory solitude, the whole 
affair has been rather unnerving. 
</P>
<P>
"I love science," Pons said, a twinge of his native North Carolina still 
evident in his words. "I love science so much that I'll work seven days a week. 
But it's been so crazy around here lately that I have to go to the lab at 
midnight just to get anything done." 
</P>
<P>
His first grandchild, Emily Ann, was born two days before The Announcement; he 
barely got a chance to kiss her before all hell broke loose. His time has 
become such a precious commodity in the last week that he has had to step down 
as chairman of the chemistry department to better devote himself to the 
speeches, technical papers and the other trappings that come with scientific 
notoriety. 
</P>
<P>
By his own account, Pons has come far from that Christmas Day 40 years ago when 
he got his first chemistry set and "got into trouble with it right away." 
</P>
<P>
Asked to offer up some recollections that would accurately portray his youth, 
he mentions blowing out his grandmother's window with a BB gun and running the 
mile, with some success, for his high school track team. 
</P>
<P>
In 1965, he got his bachelor's degree at Wake Forest University and went to the 
University of Michigan to study for a doctorate in chemistry. Two months shy of 
earning his Ph.D., and realizing that there were few jobs in chemistry at the 
time, Pons quit school to work in his father's textile firm. 
</P>
<P>
But he had been bitten by the bug of science. When that happens, as they say in 
the Carolinas, you live with the sting. 
</P>
<P>
After toiling in textiles for two years, he went back to school and, in 1979, 
finished his studies with a doctorate from the University of Southampton in 
England. It was there that he became a friend of Martin Fleischmann, an 
electrochemistry professor with whom he would eventually work on the nuclear 
fusion experiment. 
</P>
<P>
Following college teaching stints in Michigan and Alberta, Canada, Pons landed 
here at the 25,000-student, land grant university. It is a handsome, open 
campus, a mix of old gray granite and modernistic red brick, snugged up against 
the Wasatch National Forest on the eastern fringes of Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
The chemistry department to which Pons came in 1983 is among the school's 
strong points, administrators say. It is not the kind of staid and musty hall 
of academia one might remember from college days gone by. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, there are still one or two white-haired professors in white coats 
wandering around, sucking contemplatively on meerschaum pipes, and there are 
still the ubiquitous beakers and flasks, filled with boiling, eerily colored 
liquids. But by and large, the 2-year-old building where Pons and Fleischmann 
made what may be among the greatest scientific discoveries since electricity is 
alive with youth and humor, such as it is. 
</P>
<P>
This week, for example, somebody in the department distributed a parody press 
release which describes how another chemistry professor at the U. achieved 
fusion by cooking a salt compound until it was rock hard. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not," said graduate student Andrea Russell, "your average bunch of 
geeks. Neither is Stan Pons." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Draws Criticism 
</P>
<P>
But it is the university's "science by press release" approach with the fusion 
work that has drawn perhaps the most criticism from other scientists who feel 
that Pons and Fleischmann should have followed protocol and waited until their 
work was published in a scientific journal. Some suggest that the U. hastily 
called the press conference out of fear that scientists at Brigham Young 
University, 45 miles down the road in Provo, were about to release results of 
their own, similar fusion studies. 
</P>
<P>
"Not true," Pons said. "There was a lot of misinformation about what we were 
doing floating around, which could be dangerous if somebody else tried it, and 
we just felt it was the right thing to do. What's the difference if we had a 
press conference before the results were published? The same (response) would 
have happened after they were published, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Many scientists might consider such a statement scientific heresy, but Pons is 
anything but conventional. 
</P>
<P>
The father of six children and married to his third wife, Pons drives a 
four-wheel-drive truck and owns one necktie. He likes country-Western music or 
the rock group Dire Straits pounding in his ears as he works on equations in 
the basement of his ranch-style tract home, which is close to campus and next 
door to a Nazarene church. 
</P>
<P>
Colleagues describe him as a good skier, an avid fisherman, a frustrated 
gardener (the birds keep eating his flowers), a giving teacher who has 
sometimes loaned money to his students, and a gourmet cook who can whip up a 
bouillabaisse with ease. 
</P>
<P>
"Violent cooking," is how Pons describes his efforts in the kitchen, "usually 
done over Jack Daniels." 
</P>
<P>
Whiskey, he notes, was also the favored drink when he and Fleischmann, a 
frequent visitor to Pons' home, sat around the kitchen table one day five years 
ago and mapped out an experiment on nuclear fusion "just for the fun of it." 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have spent more than three decades and billions of dollars on 
research trying to figure out how to create and sustain nuclear fusion 
reactions as a potential energy source. In nature, the energy of the sun and 
other stars is supplied by fusion, a process that is thought to give off far 
less radiation than the nuclear fission processes used today in nuclear power 
plants, in which atoms are split apart rather than fused together. 
</P>
<P>
However, there has been a frustrating hitch in previous studies: to create a 
fusion reaction, scientists have had to heat materials to millions of degrees, 
hotter than the core of the sun. The amount of energy expended during these 
experiments has been more than the amount produced. 
</P>
<P>
What Pons and Fleischmann did was take a flask about the size of a drinking 
glass and insert a cylinder of the metal palladium wrapped in a platinum coil, 
creating an electrode. They filled the flask with a compound made up of one 
part oxygen and two parts deuterium -- a form of "heavy water" easily obtained 
from seawater. 
</P>
<P>
A gentle electrical current was applied to the electrode, causing the deuterium 
to concentrate in the palladium. That, in turn, caused the deuterium atoms to 
fuse together at room temperatures, creating -- voila! -- net energy, according 
to Pons. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very simple experiment, a one-in-a-billion shot," Pons said. "We were 
very lucky." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Endless Supply 
</P>
<P>
If the idea can be developed on a grander scale, say car engines or power 
plants, the oceans could supply all of the Earth's energy needs. One cubic foot 
of seawater contains enough deuterium to produce as much energy through fusion 
as through burning 10 tons of coal. 
</P>
<P>
No more air pollution. No more oil spills. No more acid rain. 
</P>
<P>
Or so the theory goes. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone, of course, is ready to buy in just yet. A man-on-the-street 
interview conducted this week by the Salt Lake Tribune found more than a little 
skepticism among the masses. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably just another Utah mistake," is how janitor Ed Townsend summed 
things up. 
</P>
<P>
The ominous possibility of his results being disproved are not lost on Pons, 
whose reputation for solid research is well established in chemistry circles. 
He said he is confident that his and Fleischmann's findings are valid. 
</P>
<P>
"I may be crazy," he said, "but I'm not stupid."

TRUMP-EASTERN DEAL FOR SHUTTLE ON AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Billionaire Donald Trump's on-again, off-again purchase of Eastern Airlines' 
profitable Northeast shuttle operation is on again. 
</P>
<P>
Trump said he has agreed to pay $365 million for the shuttle, which flies New 
York-Washington and New York-Boston routes, in a restructured deal that 
increases the number of airliners he will get to 21 from 17. The transaction 
must be approved by Eastern's bankruptcy court. Business, Page 1.

NORTH TRIAL JUDGE REFUSES TO COMPEL REAGAN TO TESTIFY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Rejecting efforts to compel Ronald Reagan to appear as a witness in the 
Iran-Contra trial, a federal judge ruled Friday that defendant Oliver L. North 
"has wholly failed" to show why he needs the former President's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
In a later action, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell also denied North's 
motions to dismiss charges in the case, leaving North to begin his defense 
Monday against 12 felony counts in the case. 
</P>
<P>
North's lawyers, who had wanted to make Reagan their first witness, have 
estimated that they will complete their arguments in three to nine days, but it 
is not clear what effect the judge's ruling will have on that timetable. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell's ruling on a Reagan trial appearance represents a severe setback for 
the defense. It had centered its case on the assertion that North, a former 
National Security Council aide, had the blessings of his superiors when he 
helped engineer the scheme that sold arms to Iran and diverted part of the 
profits to the rebels in Nicaragua, while misleading Congress about the 
Administration's Contra support activities. 
</P>
<P>
In quashing the defense subpoena of Reagan, the judge said: "While there is 
understandable public interest in what a President may have known or may have 
done, the focus of North's trial does not involve any necessity for such a 
generalized inquiry." 
</P>
<P>
Both the Justice Department and Reagan's personal attorney had argued 
strenuously against requiring the former President's testimony, citing 
executive privilege and the danger of having national security secrets exposed 
on the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan, in a television interview in Rancho Mirage, Calif., said that he 
adamantly opposed testifying at the trial. "I made up my mind I wasn't going," 
Reagan said. "I think it would have set a precedent that the next President 
doesn't have a right to impose on other Presidents. No President has ever been 
subpoenaed." 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 27, Gesell declared that he had "the naked power" to force both Reagan 
and President Bush to testify. And some legal sources close to both sides of 
the case believed that North's attorneys, in recent cross-examination of key 
prosecution witnesses, had established stronger grounds for compelling Reagan's 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
In his five-page ruling Friday, however, Gesell said he had concluded that the 
core contention by the defense that North was following implicit presidential 
orders was not sufficient to require Reagan to address the issue personally in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether or not authorization is a defense, authorization is not established by 
atmosphere, surmise or inference," he said. ". . .The trial record presently 
contains no proof that defendant North ever received any authorization from 
President Reagan to engage in the illegal conduct alleged, either directly or 
indirectly, orally or in writing." 
</P>
<P>
Gesell's ruling did not mention whether he would allow any other form of 
testimony from Reagan. He had been considering whether to have Reagan submit 
written answers to questions or whether to videotape his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also had considered allowing parts of Reagan's diary to be admitted 
as evidence. But he said in his order that he has read "references . . . to 
portions" of the diary and concluded that "nothing there remotely supports an 
authorization claim." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Evidence' 
</P>
<P>
During about an hour of arguments over whether to dismiss the charges against 
North, his attorney, Barry Simon, asserted that there is "no evidence" that 
North had obstructed investigations of the Iran-Contra affair and there was "no 
basis" for the jury to conclude that the former Marine had lied. 
</P>
<P>
The motions were dismissed by Gesell, who said: "The court is satisfied that 
all 12 counts must go to the jury at this stage." 
</P>
<P>
The charges against North allege that he lied to Congress and obstructed 
inquiries into the scandal, which came to light in November, 1986. He is 
charged with destroying official documents, defrauding the government and 
illegally accepting a $13,800 security system at his suburban Virginia home. If 
convicted, North faces a maximum of 60 years in prison and $3 million in fines.

ABOLISHING BORDERS;

FOR EUROPE, OPENING UP IS HARD TO DO

"Our objective is . . . to do away with internal frontier controls in their 
entirety." 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 1985 European Community commitment 
</P>
<P>
Perched in his second-floor office on the Belgian-West German border, chief 
customs officer Peter Noben admits that his future is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
The highway control point that he commands here is among the busiest in Europe, 
but by 1993 it could vanish. 
</P>
<P>
A far-reaching program to dismantle barriers between the 12 European Community 
nations calls for eliminating all of the 400 or so major police and customs 
checkpoints on borders linking EC countries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
As Easily as in U.S. 
</P>
<P>
If the plan succeeds, boundary gates will come down, uniformed officials will 
disappear -- along with the lines of waiting vehicles they create -- and 
Europeans and visitors alike will cross community frontiers as easily as people 
now move between U.S. states. 
</P>
<P>
While tourists may be delighted at the prospect of avoiding bureaucratic 
delays, and while visionaries acclaim the goal as a dramatic step toward a 
united Europe, those on the ground see it differently. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm all for (a more unified) Europe," Noben said. "But I'm not entirely 
convinced this is a good idea." 
</P>
<P>
As the December, 1992, deadline looms, others, too, have begun to doubt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some See It as Folly 
</P>
<P>
Some see ending border checks as misguided folly for a continent beleaguered 
with mounting problems of terrorism, drug trafficking and illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
How the community eventually resolves the issue constitutes a pivotal test of 
its commitment to the vision of greater unity. 
</P>
<P>
Few proposals in the EC's ambitious program to fashion "a single European 
space" symbolize this vision more powerfully. And few are plagued with greater 
difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
To remove all internal controls, community countries must agree to common 
positions on such volatile issues as immigration, political asylum, visa rights 
and a range of delicate taxation issues. 
</P>
<P>
Such complexities have already overwhelmed current timetables, and last 
December, a summit meeting of leaders from the 12 European Community nations -- 
Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, The Netherlands, Spain, Ireland, 
Portugal, Greece, Denmark and Luxembourg -- established a high-level working 
group to break the log jam. 
</P>
<P>
Among the problems: 
</P>
<P>
 -- How to reconcile West Germany's liberal policy toward asylum-seekers, 
enshrined in the country's constitution, with stiff restrictions imposed by 
other EC nations. Are the mainly East Bloc refugees now entering West Germany 
at a rate of 300,000 per year to be eligible to live anywhere in the community? 
</P>
<P>
 -- How to apply controls on those entering community territory to the 17 
million citizens of Sweden, Norway, Finland and Iceland, who are not EC members 
but enjoy unrestricted access to Denmark as part of a Nordic-area agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 -- How to resolve the position of countries such as France, which require 
visas for all non-EC citizens, with the more relaxed policies of other member 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at EC headquarters in Brussels believe progress on such points as 
visa rights, extradition and asylum is possible at a Madrid summit scheduled 
for late June. 
</P>
<P>
Other problems are more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Some nations fear that a primary result of lifting internal border controls 
would be to provide criminals and illegal immigrants a vast, unrestricted 
playground. 
</P>
<P>
The British Home Office recently provided statistics showing that 44% of the 
drugs seized in Britain last year came from or through another community 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Britain is especially concerned. Unlike many of its EC partners that have 
national identity cards and require residents to register with police, Britain, 
as an island country, has traditionally relied far more heavily on its entry 
points to catch undesirables. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course we must make it easier for our people to travel throughout the 
community," British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told a Belgian audience 
last fall. "But it is a matter of plain common sense that we cannot totally 
abolish frontier controls if we are also to protect our citizens." 
</P>
<P>
Other community countries, including Greece, Denmark and the Irish Republic, 
express similar reservations, although without Thatcher's stridence 
</P>
<P>
EC officials reject claims that border controls are a key crime fighter. 
</P>
<P>
"The big catches are based on tip-offs, not because someone happened onto 
something at a border," one community source asserted. "We oppose the 
simplistic view that abolishing internal frontiers is going to be a bonanza for 
terrorists and drug runners." 
</P>
<P>
Britain's Guardian newspaper, in a recent editorial urging member states to 
hold to their 1985 commitment to open borders, commented: "Freedom of movement 
is like freedom of speech. You don't ban it just because a minority abuses it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Goal of Single Marketplace 
</P>
<P>
Senior EC officials believe that it is critical to abolish frontier checks if 
the community is to generate greater public support for the goal of building 
the world's single largest marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
In an integration process so far dominated by struggles over arcane detail, the 
proposal is seen as a rare, daring initiative, easily understood and genuinely 
popular among the community's 320 million citizens. 
</P>
<P>
To the motorist trapped in a traffic jam at a border checkpoint, lofty rhetoric 
of a united Europe rings hollow. 
</P>
<P>
"It is vitally important to steer this through," community spokesman Willy 
Helin stressed. "The internal market won't be visible to ordinary citizens 
until they can go unimpeded from Athens to London with as much as they want to 
take with them." 
</P>
<P>
There are also compelling economic reasons to do away with border posts. 
</P>
<P>
An EC-funded study, published last year, calculated that the cost of 
administering internal customs checks, coupled with the estimated productivity 
lost in delays at the frontiers, totals more than $8 billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
Any genuinely unfettered freedom of movement on a mass scale would be 
unprecedented for Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly there have been periods in its history when unimpeded travel was 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, European nation-states with fixed external borders as they now exist 
are not much older than the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Wandering scholars traversed medieval Europe using Latin as a lingua franca and 
the church as a hostel. A luminary such as the 15th-Century Dutch humanist 
Desiderius Erasmus studied in Paris and traveled freely throughout Northern 
Europe before finally settling in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this century, British economist John Maynard Keynes 
recalled with nostalgia a pre-World War I Europe where travel was easy, 
passports unnecessary, border formalities a rarity and gold coins a common 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
But historically, such mobility in Europe was the preserve of a privileged, 
moneyed few. 
</P>
<P>
Even if skilled craftsmen had the means to travel, they were trapped by 
parochial institutions like the inbred city guilds that effectively froze out a 
newcomer looking for work. 
</P>
<P>
There were also some Draconian restrictions, such as those imposed by the city 
of Venice aimed at protecting its glass-blowing secrets during its golden age, 
between the 13th and 16th centuries. City authorities made it virtually 
impossible for a non-Venetian to obtain permission to live in the city -- and 
treasonous for Venetians to reside outside. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 1992 sense, the opportunity (for all) to travel from, say, Dublin to 
Lisbon with no checks and no questions asked is revolutionary," said Peter 
Pulzer, Oxford professor of government and public administration. 
</P>
<P>
To achieve this goal, the search for compromise has already begun. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Bangemann, a former West German economics minister and the EC 
commissioner overseeing the program to abolish internal frontiers, talks of 
using spot checks as a possible transitional measure. 
</P>
<P>
"The (EC) Commission is not averse to spot checks if they are not another form 
of border control," he said. 
</P>
<P>
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez 
recently floated the idea of a multilingual, internal EC law enforcement agency 
similar to the American FBI to combat cross-border crime. 
</P>
<P>
At present, however, the idea of a frontier-free community remains largely a 
noble vision -- as one group of schoolchildren from the French city of Orleans 
learned on a recent tour of neighboring countries to learn more about Europe's 
unifying process. 
</P>
<P>
At the Belgian border, their lofty mission hit present-day reality. 
</P>
<P>
Six of the group, all of Moroccan parentage, were hauled off the bus and sent 
home, while a seventh child argued his way back on board only after convincing 
a Belgian official that it was possible to be both black and French. 
</P>
<P>
And here on the border at Aachen, customs inspector Noben still chuckles about 
how enraged truck drivers recently ran into a delay that had little to do with 
bureaucracy. 
</P>

Held up through much of a day at the frontier because of West Germany's Sunday 
ban on heavy truck traffic, a long line of goods vehicles was finally permitted 
to cross, only to discover that the driver of the lead truck had locked his cab 
and disappeared, blocking the way for all behind.

5 DIE AS PLANE CRASHES ONTO TENNIS COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A private plane carrying a Canadian family of five crashed onto a tennis court 
at the Newport Beach Tennis Club Friday morning and exploded, killing all 
aboard and narrowly missing a tennis instructor and two students. 
</P>
<P>
No one on the ground was injured. 
</P>
<P>
The plane, based in Alberta, had just taken off from John Wayne Airport at 8:33 
a.m. One witness at the airport said that just after takeoff, the plane was 
flying abnormally low, with at least one engine backfiring. Soon afterward, 
smoke was seen spewing from the plane. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Have to Come Back' 
</P>
<P>
Air traffic controllers observing the plane's apparent distress radioed the 
pilot, who responded in a clear and calm voice, "We have to come back," 
according to a federal investigator at the crash scene. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot gave no indication there was any problem, and controllers received no 
other transmissions from him, the investigator said. 
</P>
<P>
According to witnesses at the tennis club, the plane turned but dove steeply 
toward the expensive Eastbluff residential community less than two miles from 
the end of the runway. It then nosed nearly straight down in an apparent 
attempt to miss the tennis clubhouse, which contained an estimated 125 people. 
Also nearby are a shopping center and several schools. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities identified the victims as pilot Anthony Ronald Deis, 35; his wife, 
Marilyn Aletha Deis, 34, and their three daughters, Amanda Lynn, 10; Jaclyn 
Dawn, 7, and Kimberly Lisa, 5. The family lived in Camrose, about 50 miles 
southeast of Edmonton, the capital of Alberta. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Deis was owner of three Richardson's Jewelry stores in Alberta, and his 
firm was listed as owner of the plane, a twin-engine, six-seat Piper Aerostar 
PA-60. 
</P>
<P>
The Piper Aerostar has had a history of engine-failure accidents during 
takeoffs and can be an unforgiving aircraft in the hands of an inexperienced 
pilot, according to aviation experts. 
</P>
<P>
The Aviation Consumer magazine published in in Greenwich, Conn., said the Piper 
Aerostar has the highest accident rate among similar twin-engine aircraft. From 
1977 to 1982, Aerostars were involved in 28 fatal accidents, and since 1983, 
the National Transportation Safety Board has recorded 20 fatal accidents 
involving the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Piper Aircraft of Vero Beach, Fla., ended production of the Aerostar in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Friends said Anthony Deis had taken up flying in 1976, had well over 1,000 
hours of flying experience and had an advanced instrument rating. They said, 
however, that Deis had owned his Aerostar for less than a year. 
</P>
<P>
Deis' brother, Tom, a police officer in Medicine Hat, Alberta, said he queried 
police authorities in Orange County and was told that a repaired oil line was 
being investigated as a possible cause of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
He said the repair was done at John Wayne Airport on Wednesday. Airport 
officials confirmed that the plane had been serviced during its stay in Orange 
County, but neither federal nor Newport Beach police investigators would 
comment on the possible cause of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
According to Tom Deis, his brother's family had taken off from Camrose on March 
22 for an Easter vacation to meet friends in Orange County and tour Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
The family's flight plan filed Friday indicated that they were returning to 
Alberta by way of Pocatello, Ida. 
</P>
<P>
The plane crashed about 20 yards from the corner of the clubhouse onto a tennis 
court, where instructor Bernie Mitton was volleying with his students. 
</P>
<P>
Mitton, 34, of Irvine, who was treated for shock in a hospital emergency room 
but otherwise was reportedly unhurt, said one of his students shouted, "There's 
a plane coming!" He said he looked up and saw the plane falling nearly straight 
down. 
</P>
<P>
"I started to run into a corner, but it seemed like the plane just kept 
following me," Mitton said. "I ran out of the corner, and within seconds it 
crashed and immediately exploded and burst into flames. If I had stayed in that 
corner, I would have been dead. 
</P>
<P>
"As I ran away, it exploded behind me. You could feel the intensity of the 
heat." 
</P>
<P>
The plane hit with such force that only a propeller thrown to the side was 
easily recognizable as part of an airplane. 
</P>
<P>
The remains of the aircraft lay in a heap at the corner of the tennis court, 
where the court's chain-link boundary fence had been twisted and bent but 
contained the wreckage like a safety net. 
</P>
<P>
Mitton's students, Bob and June Vermes of Irvine, said it appeared the pilot 
was trying to steer the falling plane away from the players. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Veered Away 
</P>
<P>
"I think he saw us and knew that he was coming toward this building," Bob 
Vermes said. "He veered into where he did and missed everybody." 
</P>
<P>
June Vermes said it appeared that "my husband actually was going in one 
direction and the plane was just veering as though the (pilot) was trying to 
avoid us, to miss us." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Rich, the National Transportation Safety Board's chief investigator at the 
crash scene, reviewed a recording of the conversation between the pilot and the 
control tower at John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
He said controllers noticed that the plane was not climbing properly and 
radioed the pilot, asking if there were any problems. Several seconds later, 
Deis responded: "We have to come back." 
</P>
<P>
Controllers then lost contact with the plane, Rich said. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics said they treated about 20 people at the club for shock but 
considered only four of the cases serious.

PARTNERS' LAWSUIT PADLOCKS FAMED TEXAS HONKY-TONK; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S FINALLY CLOSIN' TIME AT GILLEY'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gilley's is a goner. 
</P>
<P>
Once it was the most famous of honky-tonks, a vast 70,000-square-foot beer 
joint on a gone-to-seed street lined with used car lots and pawnshops. John 
Travolta made the mechanical bulls here all the rage after he rode them in the 
movie "Urban Cowboy." 
</P>
<P>
But the nightclub -- self-described as the "biggest, brawlingest, dancingest, 
craziest honky-tonk in Texas" -- was locked shut Friday morning, the day after 
a court-appointed receiver ordered it closed. 
</P>
<P>
The closure has apparently put a definite end to the joint that had its own 
shooting gallery and shower for truckers and rodeo arena and pool tables and 
punching bags and a dance floor big enough to accommodate the thousands who 
once poured in from everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
And how does Mickey Gilley feel about it all? He's just glad it's over. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Bittersweet Thing' 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bittersweet thing, but it happened," said the country-and-Western 
singer. What happened actually was that there was a legal tussle with his 
one-time partner, in which Gilley fought to have his name removed from the 
club, and to receive the payment of millions of dollars owed him. Gilley won 
the suit, and the closing of the club is a direct result. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the courts did Pasadena and country music a favor," said Gilley, who 
may end up owning the property outright in a settlement with his former 
partner, Sherwood Cryer. "The first thing I'll do is put it up for sale." 
</P>
<P>
Gilley's version of the story, which the courts believed, was that the 
honky-tonk was deteriorating because Cryer refused to make major renovations 
over the years. Gilley started hearing complaints from angry fans when he was 
on the road -- that they had been ripped off, that things cost too much, that 
the restrooms were filthy and the parking lot needed paving. But when he 
confronted Cryer, his partner refused to make any changes. 
</P>
<P>
"I said: 'You're not hurting yourself, you're hurting Mickey Gilley,' " 
recalled the singer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bad to Worse 
</P>
<P>
As time went on, things went from bad to worse in the relationship between the 
two men, who had been partners since 1971. Then came the lawsuit last April and 
the awarding of $17 million to Gilley last summer. Still, the club continued to 
operate as Gilley's until the court-appointed receiver, Mike Wood, ordered it 
closed. He said Gilley's continued to lose money and that it was time to cut 
the club's losses. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday morning, Gilley's had an almost eerie feeling to it -- vast and dark 
and empty, with blinking video games in one corner of the dance hall. The sign 
on the door summed up what had happened: "These premises have been secured by 
the 269th District Court in Harris County." 
</P>
<P>
Close-by was another sign: "We may doze but we never close." 
</P>
<P>
Inside, six-packs of Gilley's Beer were stacked on the bar, while display cases 
sported Gilley's T-shirts and Gilley's panties and Gilley's this and Gilley's 
that. At the bandstand, drummer Terry Westbrook was packing up his equipment. 
His band, the Bayou City Beat, had been performing here for 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty strange," he said. "We felt it was coming but we didn't know for 
sure." 
</P>
<P>
Gene Burns, the club manager, sat on cases of beer drinking a soda. He had 
started nine years ago as a bartender's assistant -- carting in ice, picking 
things up, washing glasses. In his mind, it was Cryer who was being maligned 
and Gilley who was wrong. To him, Gilley had gotten too uppity for his own 
good. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the club that made him, the town that made him," he said. "Other 
places catered to him because he was a star, but here he was just a homeboy. He 
bit the hand that fed him. The entertainer didn't make the club, the manager 
made the entertainer." 
</P>
<P>
Burns made his way over to the mechanical bulls. There were three now. There 
had been five when riding them was the ultimate urban cowboy experience. A sign 
over one of the bars, "Welcome Rodeo Fans," has been there as long as Burns can 
remember. 
</P>
<P>
He talked of how business had been better of late, now that Pasadena and 
adjacent Houston were emerging from the dark days of the oil bust. He said as 
many as 3,500 people were coming on the weekends. But that had not been enough.

BILLY BOB'S IS BACK WITH A WHOOP AND A HOLLER

The rowdy reopening of Billy Bob's Texas, billed as the world's largest 
honky-tonk, sends a strong signal that Texas has bounced back from the shock of 
collapsing oil prices three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The big question tonight is -- 'What's a honky-tonk?' " said Steve Murrin, one 
of 200 employees who poured beer, roped bulls, swept floors or barbecued beef 
ribs for Thursday night's 2,500 customers. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't describe a honky-tonk, but I can show you one," he said. "It's a place 
where you expect a little beer, a little music and maybe a stabbing or shooting 
once in a while." 
</P>
<P>
During the day Murrin operates a 2,000-acre working horse and cattle ranch near 
Ft. Worth, which is 30 miles west of Dallas, but at night he works at this 
converted cow barn with 42 bars, a live indoor rodeo and seating room for 6,500 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
The official reopening of Billy Bob's, closed for 10 months after its owner, 
Billy Bob Barnett, declared bankruptcy, ranks high among unofficial economic 
indicators measuring the financial health of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"Billy Bob's is just one beer joint, but when it shut down, the world thought 
the city of Ft. Worth was done for," Murrin said. 
</P>
<P>
The record crowd for Billy Bob's stands at 8,000 customers inside at one time.

GORBACHEV LINKS PARTY'S VOTE LOSSES TO FOOD SHORTAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, analyzing the Communist Party's widespread and 
unexpected losses in this week's parliamentary elections, has linked the 
setback to deepening anger over severe food shortages. 
</P>
<P>
"The food problem is the fundamental problem at present," Gorbachev said in 
comments published Friday. "If we solve it, there will be a colossal victory, 
not only in the economy but also in the political and social spheres. 
</P>
<P>
"But if we fail to solve this problem, frankly speaking, we can ruin the whole 
of perestroika and bring about serious destabilization of society." 
</P>
<P>
He said that "if party and government bodies or individual leaders were 
severely criticized (during the election campaign), then it was because people 
perceived perestroika as going too slowly." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not a Tragedy' 
</P>
<P>
Although perhaps a quarter of the party's official candidates were defeated -- 
in some cases, where they were running unopposed, a majority simply scratched 
their names off the ballot -- this was "quite normal, part of the democratic 
process, and should not be blown into a tragedy," Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
Perestroika itself, he said, had received "a powerful boost" with the election 
of so many reformers to the newly strengthened Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
"People understand that for life to get better, time and work are needed with 
an improvement in performance," Gorbachev said. "But they also do not like to 
put up with inattentiveness, mismanagement and attempts to preserve 
unapproachable bureaucratic offices like fortresses. Those who engaged only 
slowly in perestroika and were not expanding ties with the workers were the 
ones who lost." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's comments, which appeared Friday in the Communist Party newspaper 
Pravda, were made Wednesday to senior Soviet editors summoned to the party's 
Central Committee headquarters for a review of last Sunday's elections. 
Gorbachev also discussed the party's new agricultural policy, adopted in 
mid-March with the aim of boosting harvests by decentralizing farm management. 
</P>
<P>
The elections, he said, constituted an overall popular endorsement of 
perestroika, the program of political, economic and social reforms undertaken 
four years ago, and a mandate for its expansion and acceleration. 
</P>
<P>
"The election campaign and the elections themselves have propelled us forward," 
he said. "The people have had a taste of their own power. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
But even before the election campaign, he said, the whole political situation 
had become "very difficult and contradictory," and this was reflected in the 
results. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ranking Officials Defeated 
</P>
<P>
Many of the party candidates who were defeated were ranking regional officials, 
local mayors, top military and naval commanders -- even an alternate member of 
the ruling Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
"The elections showed that people within a developing democratic process will 
judge their leaders at all levels by concrete deeds, by how they act and by 
their political positions," Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he sought to calm the anxiety within the party. There will be no 
across-the-board purge of losers, he said. But those who failed to win election 
should consider how they stood with the people, how they had lost contact with 
the people and the impact of this on their work in the party. 
</P>
<P>
Yuri F. Solovev, the regional party first secretary in Leningrad and the 
highest ranking party candidate -- as an alternate member of the party 
Politburo -- to have been defeated, said Friday that both he and the party 
would survive the election and its aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
"One should not overdramatize the situation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although he was the regional first secretary, he was not the entire party 
organization, Solovev told the official news agency Tass, and the prestige of 
the party had grown because of its willingness to face criticism for past 
mistakes and to accept the responsibility for them. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said that although Solovev was unopposed, more people crossed his name off 
their ballots than accepted his candidacy -- 133,000 votes against him and 
109,000 for him. 
</P>
<P>
"One should be realistic and try to draw correct conclusions from the present 
situation," he said. "The results of the voting show that many people are not 
satisfied with the course of perestroika in Leningrad. This means this process 
must be accelerated, corrections made and shortcomings rectified. A great deal 
of hard work is ahead." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
275 Seats Undecided 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the numerous defeats of party candidates, 275 of the 1,500 seats 
remain undecided. In about a third of those districts, where no one in a field 
of three or more candidates won half of the votes cast, runoff elections 
between the top two vote getters will be held this month. In the other 
two-thirds -- districts where voters rejected an unopposed candidate or a pair 
of rivals -- fresh elections, with new candidates, will be held next month. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said the new elections will delay until late May the first session of 
the Congress of People's Deputies, which has 2,250 seats and will elect the new 
Supreme Soviet, the country's principal legislative body. 
</P>
<P>
He also affirmed his intention to adhere to his present course, reinforced by 
the election results. 
</P>
<P>
"We must go further on this path and not search for other roads or paths and 
not engage ourselves in political speculation," he said, implicitly rejecting 
calls by Boris N. Yeltsin, the maverick Communist Party politician who won an 
overwhelming victory -- 89% of the vote -- as an anti-Establishment candidate 
in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev repeatedly denounced suggestions for consideration of a multi-party 
system. Democracy, he said, "is not defined by the number of parties but by the 
role played by people in society."

FUNDAMENTALIST GROUP SAYS IT KILLED MUSLIM CLERIC IN BELGIUM

<P>
An obscure Muslim fundamentalist group, the Soldiers of Justice, claimed 
responsibility in Beirut on Friday for the slayings of a Muslim religious 
leader and his assistant earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese-based group said Muslim leader Abdullah Ahdal, 36, and assistant 
Salim Behir, 40, were killed because they worked for Israeli intelligence. 
However, Belgian police continued to focus their investigations on the theory 
that the two men were shot dead because of Ahdal's moderate stance on the 
controversy surrounding author Salman Rushdie and his book, "The Satanic 
Verses." 
</P>
<P>
Marina Coppieters T'Wallant, magistrate in charge of the investigation, 
appealed for information, calling in particular on anyone who had spoken to the 
victims Wednesday to contact police. 
</P>
<P>
The Brussels newspaper De Morgen on Friday published a copy of an open letter, 
widely distributed in the large Arab community only days before the killings, 
criticizing Ahdal for his statements on the Rushdie book and his refusal to 
authorize publication of another book attacking the British-based author and 
his works. 
</P>
<P>
The open letter, addressed in French to "brothers and sisters in Islam," takes 
the side of another Brussels Muslim leader and religious instructor, the Imam 
Mohammed Saghir, in his challenge against Ahdal. As director of the World 
Islamic League Mosque and Cultural Center, Ahdal was Saghir's supervisor in the 
center's program of religious education. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'He Rides Alone' 
</P>
<P>
"The director (Ahdal) doesn't represent anyone. He rides alone," the unsigned 
letter stated. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the letter accused Ahdal of doing nothing to prevent publication 
of "The Satanic Verses" in Belgium and refusing to urge the banning of the book 
in newspaper and television interviews on the subject. "At the same time," the 
letter continued, "he blocked our Muslim brother Imam Mohammed Saghir from 
publishing a book he just wrote clarifying the Rushdie affair for Muslims and 
non-Muslims alike." 
</P>
<P>
The letter claimed Ahdal told Saghir that if he published the book, he would be 
forced to leave the religious center. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Saghir and Ahdal met to discuss their disagreements in the same 
offices of the large mosque where the religious leader was killed only hours 
later. But a police spokesman said Saghir is not a suspect in the killings. 
</P>
<P>
However, the tone of the letter and the obvious hostility illustrates an 
emotional division in the Muslim community over the Rushdie matter and Ahdal's 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Since it receives substantial financial aid from Saudi Arabia, the World 
Islamic Center has often been the object of jealousies in the greater Muslim 
community. In fact, Ahdal, a Saudi, came to the mosque and religious center, 
which represents the Sunni Muslim community in Belgium, the Netherlands and 
Luxembourg, seven years ago after a similarly bitter conflict forced the 
resignation of his predecessor, a Tunisian, Mohammed Aluini. 
</P>
<P>
Whether these disputes were deep enough to result in professional-style 
assassination is another matter. However, investigators said Friday that they 
have no evidence linking the Soldiers of Justice group with the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
In a typewritten statement issued in Beirut, the group claimed "responsibility 
for carrying out God's verdict on traitors Abdullah Ahdal and Salim Behir." The 
statement claimed Ahdal and Behir had used the Brussels Islamic Center as a 
front for anti-Islamic activities and were working on behalf of Israeli 
intelligence.

Kidnaping of Belgian 
</P>
<P>
The Soldiers of Justice organization first surfaced in December when it claimed 
responsibility for the kidnaping of a Belgian doctor, Jan Cools, 32, in 
southern Lebanon on May 21 last year. Since then it has issued press releases 
in Beirut taking credit for a December attack on a Jewish social club in 
Copenhagen and the shooting death of a Saudi Arabian diplomat in Bangkok, 
Thailand, also in December.

SAUDI KING ENDS CAIRO VISIT, PLEDGES TO SUPPORT EGYPT'S RETURN TO ARAB LEAGUE 
</P>

<P>
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, winding up the first visit to Cairo by a Saudi 
monarch in 15 years, Friday pledged his influential support for Egypt's 
reinstatement in the Arab League and endorsed the recent political concessions 
made by the PLO as a "rare opportunity" to negotiate peace in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
The Saudi monarch, in an interview with Egyptian newspaper editors, also 
confirmed that Riyadh will help finance the reconstruction of an Iraqi nuclear 
reactor destroyed by Israel in a 1981 air raid. 
</P>
<P>
Both Israeli and U.S. officials have warned that Iraq, like its antagonistic 
neighbor Iran, is trying to develop a nuclear weapons capability. While that 
effort was set back by the Israeli air strike against a French-made nuclear 
reactor near Baghdad nearly eight years ago, Rear Adm. Thomas A. Brooks, 
director of naval intelligence, testified recently before the House Armed 
Services Committee in Washington that Iraq was again "actively pursuing" a 
nuclear capability. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crash Nuclear Program 
</P>
<P>
Asked Friday about a Washington Post article quoting Israeli sources as saying 
that Iraq is engaged in a crash program to develop a nuclear warhead, President 
Bush said in Washington: "I don't want to give credence to the fact that Iraq 
is in the process of building nuclear weapons. I cannot confirm that. Anytime 
you see representations that there will be nuclear proliferation, it has got to 
concern us." 
</P>
<P>
King Fahd, in his remarks to the newspaper editors, which were published 
Friday, denied that the reactor in question was meant to manufacture nuclear 
weapons, which, he noted, Israel is widely assumed to already possess. 
</P>
<P>
Affirming Saudi Arabia's "readiness to help rebuild" the Iraqi nuclear plant, 
Fahd proposed that Israel and Iraq both agree to inspections by the 
Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency to "determine which (reactor) 
is for military uses: the one in Israel or the (Iraqi) one. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The Saudi monarch was referring to Israel's top-secret nuclear facility at 
Dimona, which successive Israeli governments have refused to allow the IAEA to 
inspect. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flurry of Interest 
</P>
<P>
While Fahd's remarks about Iraq's postwar nuclear development plans provoked a 
flurry of interest among diplomats and other observers here, it was his strong 
and seemingly unequivocal endorsement of Egypt's readmission into the 22-member 
Arab League that was, from the Egyptian point of view, the most important 
outcome of his long-anticipated visit. 
</P>
<P>
"Egypt's presence within the Arab group is indispensable . . . to effective 
joint Arab action," Fahd said in a joint communique issued with Egyptian 
President Hosni Mubarak at the end of his five-day visit. 
</P>
<P>
The Arab League suspended Egypt's membership 10 years ago after Mubarak's 
predecessor, the late President Anwar Sadat, signed a separate peace treaty 
with Israel. Although most Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, resumed 
diplomatic relations with Cairo more than a year ago, Egypt's formal return to 
the Arab fold has been stymied by opposition from Syria, which the normally 
skittish Saudis have been reluctant to antagonize. 
</P>
<P>
In the complex currents of inter-Arab politics, however, several recent shifts 
have emerged to prod the Saudis into taking a bolder stand on this issue. 
</P>
<P>
The most significant of these, Egyptian and other Arab analysts said, was an 
agreement last February among Iraq, Egypt, Jordan and Yemen to form the Arab 
Cooperation Council, a loose economic confederation. 
</P>
<P>
While the economic significance of this grouping is doubtful, given the 
near-bankrupt state of its members' economies, its political point was not lost 
on the Saudis, whose regional influence could be eclipsed by the emergence of 
any post-Persian Gulf War alliance between Iraq and Egypt, the two largest Arab 
military powers in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Iraq have been pressing the Saudis for more economic assistance, and 
the fact that Fahd's decision to visit both countries -- he stopped off in Iraq 
before coming to Egypt -- followed the Arab Cooperation Council's formation was 
not mere coincidence, a senior Egyptian official admitted privately. 
</P>
<P>
"The Saudis decided to come when they saw that Egypt's weight was being 
siphoned off toward Iraq and Jordan," this official said somewhat gleefully. 
</P>
<P>
The joint Egyptian-Saudi communique said the two sides had agreed to establish 
a committee to increase economic "cooperation," but there was no confirmation 
of local press reports suggesting that Fahd had ordered Saudi banks to lend 
Egypt $2 billion to meet a serious shortage of wheat and other essential 
commodities this year. There was also no indication that Fahd had brought Egypt 
a quick-fix check of several hundred million dollars, as had been rumored. 
</P>
<P>
However, if Fahd's visit failed to meet Egyptian expectations on the financial 
side, it clearly boosted Mubarak's prestige in several other ways, diplomats 
and Egyptian officials agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Fahd in Cairo, more than any other single visit or event, symbolizes Egypt's 
return to the Arab fold," a Western diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
By throwing his substantial weight behind Egypt's quest for readmittance into 
the Arab League, Fahd has virtually assured that Egypt's suspension will be 
lifted at the next Arab League summit, diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
Because it speaks directly to Egyptians' sense of pride, the gesture of the 
visit is considered extremely important to Mubarak, who is facing growing 
discontent at home over inflation, food shortages and other increasingly 
visible signs of Egypt's worsening economic crisis. Indeed, the effusive, 
almost fulsome, fuss that Egypt made over Fahd seemed to be aimed at least as 
much at boosting Mubarak's image as Fahd's, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
The support the Saudi monarch gave to Egypt's diplomatic efforts to convene a 
Middle East peace conference was also seen here as strengthening Mubarak's hand 
on the eve of his first visit to Washington since President Bush took office, 
the analysts added. 
</P>
<P>
Praising Bush as a "far-sighted thinker" who will "spare no effort to solve the 
Middle East problem," Fahd told the newspaper editors that Saudi Arabia "fully 
supports . . . the constructive position" on the peace process that Mubarak 
will try to persuade Bush to embrace when they meet in Washington on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
This position, the joint communique added, calls for the convening of an 
international peace conference, under the auspices of the U.N. Security 
Council, as "the only formula" that can lead to peace in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
The communique also endorsed the recent decisions by the Palestine Liberation 
Organization to renounce terrorism and recognize Israel's right to exist as a 
"positive development in the Palestinian position (that) offers a rare 
opportunity all the parties should seize to reach a just and comprehensive 
settlement" to the Middle East conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Mubarak held talks last week with King Hussein of Jordan and PLO Chairman 
Yasser Arafat to agree on the tack he will take in Washington. Now, with the 
added weight of Saudi Arabia's support, he will go to the White House with the 
enhanced stature of spokesman for an influential Arab consensus on the peace 
process, Egyptian officials said.

DAY ONE OF U.N.-SUPERVISED TRANSITION; 
</P>
<P>
NAMIBIA STARTS MARCH TO INDEPENDENCE

WINDHOEK, Namibia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Namibia, South Africa's vast colony for 74 years, began its long-delayed march 
to independence today under the supervision of the largest and most expensive 
U.N. peacekeeping mission in history. 
</P>
<P>
"The people of Namibia have waited long years for this day, and it is the eve 
of an era: an era of all of the people of Namibia," Martti Ahtisaari, the 
U.N.'s special representative to Namibia, said Friday as he arrived to monitor 
the transition from African colony to nationhood. 
</P>
<P>
"Namibia has truly been a wound in the side of Africa," Ahtisaari told a news 
conference at Windhoek's airport. "But it also has a special place in the 
hearts and minds of the whole world." 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of cheering Namibians came by train, bus and even on horseback across 
the scrubby desert to line the airport road and welcome the U.N. official, who 
arrived on a South African Airways flight from Frankfurt, West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The throng, bedecked in traditional African dress and the bright colors of some 
of the territory's 40 political parties, carried signs reading: "No Government 
Based on Ethnicity," "No to a One-Party System" and "Welcome Martti." Women in 
braided hair ululated and danced while political organizers with bullhorns 
called out slogans to their faithful. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Want an Election' 
</P>
<P>
"We're here to show these U.N. people how much we want an election," said 
Katjimuini Veii, who was wearing a T-shirt expressing his support for the 
Namibian Patriotic Front, a coalition of political parties. 
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari's arrival was eagerly awaited here because it signaled the start of 
an 11-year-old U.N. plan to free Namibia, a rugged land of only 1.5 million 
people on the southwestern coast of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa, itself then a self-governing British possession, captured the 
colony from Germany in World War I. After the war, the League of Nations gave 
South Africa the mandate to govern the territory. South Africa became fully 
independent of Britain in 1934 and after World War II, the league's successor 
organization, the United Nations, refused to allow it to annex the territory. 
In 1966, the U.N. General Assembly terminated South Africa's mandate in 
Namibia. 
</P>
<P>
Pretoria has defiantly occupied Namibia for more than 20 years. Since the 
mid-1970s, it had cited the presence of Cuban troops in Angola, Namibia's 
northern neighbor. But in December, it agreed to bring its troops out, in 
return for a promise that Cuba would pull its troops out of Angola. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Test of Commitment 
</P>
<P>
The independence process is considered an important test of South Africa's 
commitment to peace in southern Africa. South Africa also hopes a smooth 
transition for Namibia will improve Pretoria's image abroad and help reduce its 
international economic and political isolation. 
</P>
<P>
"We are leaving Namibia with a feeling that we have fulfilled our commitments 
here with dignity," Roelof F. (Pik) Botha, South Africa's foreign minister, 
said Friday at a news conference in Windhoek. Describing South Africa's 
contributions to Namibia's infrastructure over the years, Botha added, "I 
cannot imagine a country that has a better hope of making a success of 
independence than this one." 
</P>
<P>
The U.N.'s Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG), which will cost $416 million, 
includes a multinational force of 4,650 troops and, at its height, 2,500 
additional monitors, administrators and local staff. About 1,000 troops already 
have arrived and are stationed throughout the territory to monitor the election 
campaign and voting. 
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. transition, Namibia will be governed until independence by South 
Africa's administrator general "to the satisfaction of" the U.N.'s Ahtisaari, 
according to the U.N. resolution. 
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari, U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar's personal envoy in 
Namibia, said the joint U.N.-South Africa effort marked "a unique and 
pioneering vision." If successful, he added, "the prospect for a peaceful 
settlement of even the (world's) most intractable problems will have taken a 
giant stride forward." 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to see these elections be really free and fair, free of the scourge 
of violence and intimidation," the South African administrator, Louis Pienaar, 
said in pledging his country's impartiality. "We would like to prove that 
democratic elections can be held in this part of the world." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cease-Fire in Effect 
</P>
<P>
A formal U.N.-negotiated cease-fire between South Africa and the South-West 
Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), which has waged a 23-year guerrilla war 
for independence, went into effect at dawn today although the two sides had 
informally observed a cease-fire since December. 
</P>
<P>
Also beginning today, South Africa's troops are confined to two bases in the 
country, and SWAPO's soldiers must remain in their bases in Angola and Zambia. 
</P>
<P>
About 24,000 black Namibians who have fought with the South African army 
against SWAPO are being disbanded and ordered to surrender their weapons and 
uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
Namibia's independence is guided by a strict timetable. By mid-May, all 
discriminatory laws must be repealed, and by early June all political prisoners 
and detainees held by both sides must be released. South Africa has until July 
to reduce its troop strength in Namibia to 1,500, from a high last year of 
about 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
Namibians who fled the country to escape the war and SWAPO members who went 
into exile are expected to begin returning in the coming weeks. The United 
Nations estimates that about 58,000 Namibians are living in exile, most of them 
in southern Angola. 
</P>
<P>
Namibia's election campaign begins in July and, in early November, the 
territory will elect an assembly to draw up a new constitution. The whole 
process is expected to be concluded by this time next year. 
</P>
<P>
SWAPO, with its strong base of support in the north, Namibia's most populous 
region, is regarded by many political analysts as the likely winner in an 
election. But few believe it will gain the two-thirds majority needed to design 
the constitution by itself. 
</P>
<P>
Namibia, a mostly desert land with mines producing diamonds and uranium, is one 
of the world's least-populous regions. In fact, the territory will have one 
U.N. soldier for every 200 Namibians. But because of the large distances to be 
covered, the world body considers its mission in Namibia "the most complicated 
mission we have ever put on," according to Cedric Thornberry, the 
second-ranking U.N. official here. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Namibia's inhabitants are black and 60% of them live in the north, 
where SWAPO draws most of its support. Only 80,000 Namibians, about 6% of the 
total population, are white. But they control many of the businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Namibia's whites, including those who strongly oppose the U.N. presence 
here, have decided to remain at least until the November elections. Many more 
moderate whites have decided to actively contest the election in the hope of 
preventing a sweeping SWAPO victory. 
</P>
<P>
Before today, Namibia had been governed by a multiracial transitional 
government, but South Africa's administrator retained veto power over 
legislation. Although apartheid was formally abolished several years ago, 
segregated second-tier governmental bodies kept such institutions as schools 
and hospitals racially separate. 
</P>
<P>
But the government has been abolished and, until independence, Pienaar, South 
Africa's administrator, will be in control of the country. On matters relating 
to the upcoming elections, however, his actions must meet with the approval of 
the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

YOUNG FETUS 'VIABILITY' UNCHANGED, COURT TOLD; 
</P>
<P>
SCIENTISTS CONTEND THAT MEDICAL GAINS HAVE NOT INCREASED CHANCES OF SURVIVAL 
OUTSIDE WOMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A group of distinguished scientists and physicians, including 11 Nobel Prize 
winners, told the Supreme Court Friday that -- despite medical advances -- a 
fetus cannot survive outside its mother's womb before it is 24 weeks old. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called "point of viability" of a fetus has not changed significantly 
since the high court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling making abortion legal, the 
scientists said in a friend-of-the-court brief. Critics of the abortion 
decision have maintained that it has been rendered obsolete by advances in 
medical technology that have moved back the point of viability. 
</P>
<P>
The brief was submitted in conjunction with a pending case from Missouri 
(Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services, 88-605). Many legal experts believe 
that the high court will use this abortion appeal to revise the legal abortion 
standards it set in the landmark Roe ruling. The justices will hear arguments 
on the case April 26. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State's Interests Cited 
</P>
<P>
In the 1973 opinion, Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote that abortion was entirely 
a matter for a woman and her doctor during the first trimester of a 36-week 
pregnancy. But the state's "important and legitimate interests" in protecting 
the fetus become significant "at viability," which he said occurred sometime 
during the second trimester. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of "viability" has not proved to be crucial in the court's later 
abortion rulings because the court's majority has struck down virtually all 
state attempts to limit abortion. Nevertheless, critics of the Roe decision, 
including Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, repeatedly have asserted that Blackmun's 
three-trimester framework must be reconsidered because of medical advances 
allowing ever smaller and younger fetuses to survive outside the womb. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department, in a brief filed a month ago, also said that the 
"viability standard (in the Roe decision) is particularly unworkable as a 
constitutional reference point because . . . the point when a fetus may survive 
outside the womb with artificial aid changes with advancements in medical 
skill." 
</P>
<P>
But the Nobel laureates' brief, which was signed by 156 other scientists and 
medical experts, said that there have not been great advances substantially 
improving the survival chances of very young fetuses. 
</P>
<P>
"Although advances in technology have improved the chances of survival for 
premature births within the range of 24 to 28 weeks, the outer limit of 
viability at 24 weeks has not significantly changed," the brief says. 
"Moreover, there is no reason to believe that a change in this outer limit is 
either imminent or inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
"This court's decision in Roe vs. Wade is as well-grounded in biological 
justifications today as in 1973, and the basic chronology of human development 
recognized in the court's opinion remains accurate," the brief continued. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors have not been able to save fetuses younger than 24 weeks because 
critical organs, particularly the lungs and kidneys, are not developed enough. 
"Air sac development sufficient for gas exchange (in the lungs) does not occur 
until at least 23 weeks after gestation and often later," the brief said. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists admitted that they cannot answer the fundamental question of 
when a human life begins. "There is no scientific consensus" on that point and 
the answer "will depend on each individual's social, religious, philosophical, 
ethical and moral beliefs," they said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Funding at Core of Case 
</P>
<P>
The scientists' brief was only one of many filed by interested parties in the 
Missouri case, which centers on that state's attempt to prevent public funding 
of abortions. 
</P>
<P>
By Friday, the case had drawn more than 60 briefs. The previous high mark was 
58, filed in conjunction with the landmark Bakke case in 1978 on affirmative 
action. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Justice Department said Friday that it has recruited Charles 
Fried, solicitor general in the Ronald Reagan Administration, to present its 
arguments in the April 26 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Fried left office Jan. 20 to return to teaching law at Harvard University and 
the Bush Administration announced its intention to appoint appeals court Judge 
Kenneth Starr as his replacement. But Starr had not been confirmed by the 
Senate, leaving the Administration without an advocate before the court.

A somber Fred H. Lackner of Woodland Hills, Calif., pleaded guilty Friday to 
federal conspiracy, wire fraud and bribery charges in the continuing Ill Wind 
investigation into corruption in Pentagon weapons-buying. 
</P>
<P>
Lackner, a 52-year-old free-lance defense consultant, admitted paying about 
$6,000 in bribes to a Navy official for inside information on military 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton read the three charges to Lackner and 
asked him how he pleaded. "Guilty," the consultant replied each time in a quiet 
but firm voice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To Cooperate in Probe 
</P>
<P>
Lackner faces 25 years in prison and $750,000 in fines. Under terms of the 
plea-bargain agreement, he will testify against other suspects in the 
procurement investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Lackner and his attorney, James A. Twitty, refused to comment on the plea. 
</P>
<P>
His admission closed a circle that included Alexandria, Va., defense consultant 
William L. Parkin and Navy electronics specialist Stuart E. Berlin, both of 
whom earlier had confessed to their roles in the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Teledyne Industries Inc. of Newbury Park, Calif., and Hazeltine Corp. of Long 
Island, N. Y., also have pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges in the case. 
Teledyne will pay penalties of as much as $8.4 million; Hazeltine was fined 
$1.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Executives Face Trial 
</P>
<P>
The trial of three Teledyne executives on related charges is scheduled to begin 
Monday. They are expected to argue that they authorized payments to the 
consultants but did not know that the money would be used to bribe a public 
official. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors now have obtained 14 guilty pleas on charges arising from the 
three-year Ill Wind investigation. Officials have described the inquiry as the 
broadest investigation ever into corruption in the military's 
$150-billion-a-year procurement system. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors, under the direction of Henry E. Hudson, U.S. attorney for 
the Eastern District of Virginia, are continuing to build cases against a 
number of defense consultants and Pentagon officials who have not been 
indicted. 
</P>
<P>
Documents in the case show that Lackner served as the conduit for money and 
information passing between consultant Parkin and Navy official Berlin. Parkin 
found corporate clients willing to pay large fees for inside information on 
military contracts; Berlin sold the information to his longtime friend, 
Lackner, who passed it to Parkin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Described as Go-Between 
</P>
<P>
"Berlin's role was to provide information and whatever influence he could on 
the procurement," according to the statement of facts accompanying Lackner's 
plea agreement. "Lackner's role was to act as a go-between for Parkin and 
Berlin so that they would not deal directly with each other." 
</P>
<P>
Teledyne and Hazeltine agreed to pay Parkin about $200,000 for the inside 
information. He split his fees with Lackner and a former Teledyne executive, 
Michael Savaides. The three men chipped in a total of about $6,000 to give 
Berlin, telling him that the fees were much smaller than they actually were. 
</P>
<P>
Lackner's sentencing is scheduled for June 30.

BAY AREA SPILL NEGOTIATION MAY SET PATTERN FOR VALDEZ

<P>
As experts try to assess damage wrought by the Exxon oil spill in Alaska, 
government lawyers here are demanding that Shell Oil Co. pay several million 
dollars in compensation for a major spill near San Francisco Bay last year. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the settlement offer, Shell is being asked to create new parks and 
wetlands near the site of the 441,000-gallon spill, sources familiar with the 
case say. 
</P>
<P>
Officials directly involved in the negotiations would not place a value on the 
proposal, though separate sources familiar with the case say the value may top 
$10 million. Shell spokesman Bill Gibson declined to comment on the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Requests Put in Letter 
</P>
<P>
Shell and 16 federal, state and local agencies with jurisdiction over the spill 
hope to settle without a court fight. To this end, government lawyers on Feb. 
28 sent the company a letter setting forth their requests. The sides now are in 
secret negotiations. If the talks fail, a suit likely would be filed. 
</P>
<P>
If Shell meets the demand, the deal would be one of the biggest settlements 
ever over an oil spill affecting U.S. waters. The package would be in addition 
to Shell's estimate that cleanup and restoration cost $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done an internal assessment for settlement purposes, and we have 
commenced negotiations," said Deputy Atty. Gen. Sara Russell, who is heading 
the government's negotiation effort. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope it would settle. It's in everybody's best interest," said Contra 
Costa County Deputy Dist. Atty. James L. Sepulveda, who is part of the 
negotiating team. "It's no big secret that we're talking substantial sums." 
</P>
<P>
Shell's 441,000-gallon spill pales in comparison to the multimillion-gallon 
Valdez disaster. But although no two spills are the same, the process leading 
up to the Shell spill negotiations sheds light on what goes on long after an 
oil slick dissipates. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope that some of the material we gathered will assist them up there with 
the legal problems in figuring out how to restore Prince William Sound," said 
Mark Pollack, who heads the Solano County district attorney's environmental 
crime section and is part of the negotiating team. 
</P>
<P>
In the April 22 Shell spill, tar-like crude leaked from a broken pipe into a 
moat-like berm that encircled a huge storage tank. The berm might have 
contained the oil, but an open valve in the berm allowed it to flow into the 
Carquinez Strait, which separates San Francisco Bay from the Sacramento-San 
Joaquin River Delta, and eventually into sensitive wetlands, as well as the 
bay. 
</P>
<P>
The demands on Shell followed a detailed damage assessment by economists and 
wildlife experts. The process was so specific that economists calculated the 
worth of individual birds, and emotional stress of mariners whose boat hulls 
were coated with oil, and homeowners whose waterfront property was despoiled. 
</P>
<P>
In the negotiations, corporate and government lawyers will try to determine the 
worth of hundreds of birds and animals that died. One factor in the complex 
computations is what people will spend to view birds, including such costs as 
park entrance fees and mileage. 
</P>
<P>
To understand the long-lasting effects, Shell is being asked to fund a study of 
the impact of a spill. At first glance, the wetlands that were fouled reveal 
virtually no sign of the spill. New foliage is growing and birds are nesting in 
the marshes. But wildlife populations may be down because of the spill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Effects Not Isolated 
</P>
<P>
And in an already polluted bay, biologists have had a hard time isolating the 
effects of the spill. Striped bass, which were spawning, may have been damaged, 
but the bass population has been troubled for years. Salmon may be depleted, 
but whether the spill is the cause cannot be known. 
</P>
<P>
"It is reasonable to expect depressed salmon yields three or four years down 
the road, because of the drought and perhaps because of the spill," said Larry 
Kolb of the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
There is continuing damage too. As was the case in both the Valdez and Shell 
spills, some of the oil sank. Each time the shipping channel is dredged, that 
crude is stirred up -- to the detriment of bottom-dwelling fish such as 
sturgeon.

STATE CONTINUES TESTS ON RECALLED BOTTLED WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK LANDSBAUM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As many as 2,000 bottles of drinking water from an Irvine-based bottled water 
company were removed from store shelves as company and state health officials 
continued Friday to test the product for potentially lethal levels of sodium 
fluoride, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Niagara Drinking Waters Inc. recalled all of its 2 1/2-gallon bottles from 
about half a dozen stores in San Bernardino and Riverside counties and Las 
Vegas after the state Department of Health Services issued a warning Thursday 
that they might be dangerously contaminated with sodium fluoride, state and 
company spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
State Health Director Kenneth W. Kizer had issued a warning to consumers not to 
drink Niagara brand water in 2 1/2-gallon plastic containers after tests found 
the odorless and colorless chemical present in potentially lethal amounts in 
two bottles sold on March 2 and 3 at the Food 4 Less market in Moreno Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Members of one family that had purchased the water suffered upset stomachs, 
said Frank Nava, chief of field operations in the Department of Health 
Service's food and drug unit. 
</P>
<P>
"The other (family) actually threw up the water right away within minutes of 
having ingested it," he said. "The last word that we got is that they are 
fine." 
</P>
<P>
The source of the contamination was unknown, and testing was expected to 
continue until early next week. 
</P>
<P>
Only the 2 1/2-gallon bottles of Niagara water sold through retail outlets were 
recalled. The bulk of Niagara's water is sold in larger containers and 
delivered directly to homes, according to Diane Peykoff, Niagara's 
secretary-treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, we think it's an isolated case, but we are continuing to take 
additional samples and (are) waiting for the phone to ring and see if we get 
any additional illnesses," Nava said. 
</P>
<P>
"Any testing we provide for the remaining water will be done at a very fast 
pace," he said. "We're working to do that so they can get their product back on 
the shelf right away." 
</P>
<P>
Health officials are also sampling other brands stocked at the Moreno Valley 
store "as a precautionary measure," Nava said. The possibility of sabotage has 
not been ruled out, although Nava stressed that there is no evidence to 
indicate the contamination was deliberate. 
</P>
<P>
Sodium fluoride is sometimes added to drinking water to help prevent tooth 
decay. But Nava said in those cases, the chemical amounts to only 1 or 2 parts 
per million. The two confiscated bottles contained fluoride up to 450 p.p.m., 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"A baby would have to drink 16 ounces of it to be lethal," Nava said. "An adult 
would have to drink eight to 10 eight-ounce glasses." 
</P>
<P>
But before that is likely to happen, the water would cause vomiting, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kizer advised anyone who has consumed the water and believes he or she may have 
become ill to consult their physician and notify their county health 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Peykoff said she is confident that the water was not contaminated at the 
company's production plant. 
</P>
<P>
"I do feel comfortable in saying it (the contamination) did not come from our 
facility," she said. "We have tested every bottle that we have recalled and 
will continue to." 
</P>
<P>
Niagara's 2 1/2-gallon bottles do not normally contain the company's 
fluoridated water, Peykoff said. Fluoridated water sold by Niagara is processed 
in a separate room at the company's Irvine plant and is packaged only in 
five-gallon bottles, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bottled drinking water is as likely to come from the tap of a municipal water 
system as from wells and springs but is so highly treated that it is virtually 
unrecognizable, spokesmen for bottled water companies said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Except for mountain spring water, which is simply filtered and sterilized, 
bottled water producers use reverse osmosis and deionization to remove all 
minerals and other materials from the water. They then add small quantities of 
food-grade minerals to give it taste, treat it with ozone to kill 
microorganisms and bottle it. 
</P>
<P>
Some bottlers also add fluoride to help prevent tooth decay. That addition must 
be noted on the label.

BOTTLE MANUFACTURERS INTENSIFY THEIR RECYCLING DRIVE

Amid widespread reports that California's recycling law is falling far short of 
its goals, glass manufacturers Friday announced a new effort to get consumers 
to turn in their empty bottles. 
</P>
<P>
The industry's hope is that it can stave off a doubling of the 
1-cent-per-container fee charged to manufacturers unless there are dramatic 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, glass, plastic and aluminum container manufacturers must reach 
a 65% redemption rate by June 30 or face the penny increase in fees next Jan. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
It appears that aluminum manufacturers will achieve the 65% target, but the 
glass industry is well below that goal, and plastic firms have virtually no 
chance of reaching it. 
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of the glass manufacturers' new efforts is a $1-million 
television advertising campaign that began this week urging viewers to recycle 
glass containers. On top of that, efforts are being stepped up to collect glass 
products at bars and restaurants and encourage more recycling programs among 
business and charitable groups. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Costs to Industry Cited 
</P>
<P>
Lee Wiegandt, president of the California Glass Recycling Corp., a coalition of 
glass companies and unions, said during a Capitol news conference that the 
increase in redemption fees could cost the glass manufacturers $36 million 
annually and threaten the jobs of thousands of industry workers. 
</P>
<P>
The effort underscores the poor record of the glass, plastic and aluminum 
industries in meeting the goals set out in California's recycling law, which 
took effect in 1987. Actually, the overall goal of the state law is a 
redemption rate of 80%, although there are penalties only if the 65% level is 
not reached. 
</P>
<P>
During the six months ended Dec. 31, 1988, the last period for which statistics 
are available, consumers were redeeming 60% of their aluminum cans, 40% of 
their glass bottles and jars and only 5% of their plastic containers. 
</P>
<P>
According to various experts, aluminum cans are returned most often because 
they are lightweight and can be easily crushed and transported. Because they 
have a relatively high value as a metal, manufacturers were encouraging 
recycling efforts even before the state passed its law. Glass containers, on 
the other hand, are bulkier to store and potentially dangerous if they break. 
Plastic containers, primarily two-liter soda bottles, are so bulky that 
consumers generally have not been going to the trouble of saving them for the 
penny refund. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) has introduced legislation sponsored by a 
group called Californians Against Waste that would allow an increase of up to a 
nickel in the refund value of empty containers unless the 65% goal is met. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Murray, policy director for Californians Against Waste, said Friday that 
although some Californians recycle containers for environmental reasons, the 
vast majority need financial incentives. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that is going to motivate Californians to recycle at the levels 
required is a higher financial incentive. We think that is a nickel a 
container. A penny is a joke," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Sarasohn, deputy director of the Department of Conservation, which 
administers the state's recycling program, acknowledged that the state will not 
reach the 80% redemption goal established in the law. But he said he believes 
that the aluminum industry likely will reach the 65% target and declared that 
the glass industry has an outside chance if its public relations campaign 
succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Conservation, in a press release Friday, said that beverage 
container litter in California is down 42% to 45%, largely the result of the 
recycling law. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the department estimated that litterbugs drop so many cans and bottles 
that Californians could earn $6 million at current redemption rates if they 
turned them all in. The scrap and redemption value of cans and bottles left 
along California's highways and rural roads averages about $10 a mile, the 
department said.

The wife of Assembly Republican leader Ross Johnson of La Habra was slightly 
injured when a bullet shattered the windows of her van while she was driving 
along Interstate 80 near the state Capitol, his office said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Anne Richards, the assemblyman's press secretary, said doctors reported the 
"bullet grazed the chin" of Diane Johnson, 47, as she was driving to Davis from 
Sacramento early Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"She had some stitches, but she's fine now and back at work today," Richards 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After the incident, Diane Johnson drove on to Davis and called police. 
</P>
<P>
Richards said the Yolo County Sheriff's Department has no leads in the case, no 
suspects and the bullet has not been found. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if there were any political implications to the incident, she said, "No. 
We think it was just a plinker. They've had a lot of problems in that area with 
people shooting guns, according to the sheriff's office."

JULIAN M. SIEROTY; RETAIL STORE CHAIN FORMER EXECUTIVE

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Julian M. Sieroty, son of the founder of the Eastern Columbia department store 
chain and the executive responsible for the old "Eastern Columbia, Broadway at 
9th" musical jingle that dominated local airwaves in the 1940s and '50s, is 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
His son, former Assemblyman Alan Sieroty, said his father was 85 when he died 
March 22 at his Beverly Hills home of heart failure. 
</P>

The elder Sieroty was the son of Adolph Sieroty, who came to Los Angeles in the 
1890s and started what would become the forerunners of Eastern Columbia. He 
died in 1937 and Julian Sieroty, in an effort to lure business further south in 
the downtown area, launched an advertising campaign to call attention to the 
store's location. The result was the jingle that at its peak aired dozens of 
times daily over local stations. 
</P>
<P>
The lilting ditty proved so popular that it was parodied regularly on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign evidently worked, for at one time the store was the fifth-largest 
department store in the city, Alan Sieroty said. 
</P>
<P>
The Eastern Columbia building, which closed its doors in 1957, is considered 
one of the finest examples of Art Deco architecture in Los Angeles. It has 
since become an historical monument. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Sieroty said his father also was one of the first downtown merchants to 
turn to television advertising in the infancy of that medium. 
</P>
<P>
At one time, the Eastern Columbia chain had 39 stores on the West Coast, but 
all have since been sold or gone out of business.

BERNARD BLIER; 50 YEARS IN FRENCH FILMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bernard Blier, the plump and balding French actor who incarnated hapless 
husbands, conniving cops and heartless hit men over a movie career that spanned 
50 years, has died, his son announced Thursday in Paris. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
Blier, winner of this year's prestigious Cesar award (France's equivalent of 
the Oscar) for a career that included roles in about 150 films, died in 
suburban Saint-Cloud after what was described only as a long illness. 
</P>
<P>
His best-known movies ranged from Yves Allegret's "Maneges" (1949) to "Buffet 
Froid" (1979), directed by his son Bertrand and starring Gerard Depardieu. He 
also played opposite such greats as Jean Gabin and Simone Signoret, generally 
as a corpulent, moon-faced sidekick with a caustic sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
Blier was born in Buenos Aires where his father, a biologist, was on assignment 
for the Pasteur Institute. 
</P>
<P>
From his first film in 1937, Raymond Rouleau's "Trois, Six, Neuf," ("Three, 
Six, Nine"), followed by six other movies that same year, Blier was a 
workaholic. His last role was in Moshe Misrahi's "Mangeclous" in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"My work is my joie de vivre," Blier once said. "Never do I go to the studio 
like one goes to the office. I hate vacation."

Retired Gen. Richard H. Ellis, a former head of the Strategic Air Command who 
also served as the Air Force's vice chief of staff, has died of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis, 69, died Tuesday at Andrews Air Force Base, Md. 
</P>
<P>
After retiring from the Air Force in 1981, Ellis was named chief U.S. delegate 
to the U.S.-Soviet commission monitoring compliance with arms control 
agreements. 
</P>
<P>
He had joined the military in September, 1941, as an aviation cadet at Maxwell 
Field, Ala., and received his commission and pilot wings in April, 1942. In 
World War II, he was assigned to the 3rd Bombardment Group in Australia, New 
Guinea and the Philippines, flying more than 200 combat missions. 
</P>
<P>
After the war, he earned a law degree from the Dickinson School of Law in 1949, 
practicing in Wilmington, Del. 
</P>
<P>
He was recalled to active duty in October, 1950, after the outbreak of the 
Korean War, and spent the next 31 years with the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his retirement, Ellis had served four years (1977-81) as the 
commander-in-chief of the Strategic Air Command, the organization responsible 
for America's land-based nuclear missile and bomber forces. 
</P>
<P>
Before assuming that command, he worked as the commander-in-chief of U.S. Air 
Forces in Europe and before that, from November, 1973, to August, 1974, as the 
Air Force's vice chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
He earned his fourth star and the rank of full general on Sept. 30, 1973. 
</P>
<P>
A 1980 recipient of the Air Force Assn.'s highest honor, the H.H. Arnold Award, 
Ellis also had earned the Distinguished Service Cross; the Distinguished 
Service Medal with three oak leaf clusters; the Silver Star; the Legion of 
Merit with two oak leaf clusters; the Distinguished Flying Cross; the Air Medal 
with four oak leaf clusters, and the Purple Heart.

TAMING THE OFTEN UGLY ALMS PITCH; 
</P>
<P>
PUSHY PANHANDLERS GETTING MORE THAN THEY ASKED FOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To avoid some of the increasingly strident requests for handouts along 4th 
Avenue downtown, Kim Ramsay decided to jaywalk between F and G streets on her 
way to work recently as an undercover security agent for Mervyn's department 
store at Horton Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Awaiting her on the other side of the street was a police officer. But instead 
of getting a ticket, Ramsay got sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'd gone down to the corner to cross, I would've been hit up," Ramsay 
explained to the officer. 
</P>
<P>
Ramsay and other downtown pedestrians have been complaining about the 
increasingly bold tactics of panhandlers, some of whom city officials say have 
even resorted to grabbing people when requests for spare change are turned 
down. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Spinning You Around' 
</P>
<P>
"They're not only asking people for money, they're putting their hand on your 
shoulder and spinning you around," said Linda Kinsey of the San Diego city 
attorney's criminal division. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is so common that panhandling has become one of downtown's most 
rampant crimes, added Jim Filley, the San Diego Police Department's downtown 
community-relations officer. A steady flow of complaints, ranging from jeering 
panhandlers to those who follow pedestrians along the street, are being 
received from merchants and others. 
</P>
<P>
In response, the Police Department is targeting panhandlers, pushy or not, 
using a special two-man undercover team. The team started Wednesday and made 
about 15 arrests that day during a four-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
After being solicited, the plainclothes officers radio the nearest uniformed 
officer, who issues a citation. 
</P>
<P>
Kinsey said the city attorney's office is researching how police can better 
enforce the misdemeanor panhandling law, known as "soliciting for alms." The 
principal question is whether police must actually hear a panhandler's request 
or require the victim -- most of whom have left the scene -- to press charges, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the law, a panhandler is anyone who 
</P>
<P>
"accosts other persons in any public place or in any place open to the public 
for the purpose of begging or soliciting alms." 
</P>
<P>
Police believe that some of the more aggressive beggars earn up to $100 a day. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of them insult you, curse you and make themselves a real nuisance," said 
Aubrey Jones, owner of Jones Barber Shop on Broadway who has been a downtown 
merchant for 49 years. "It is getting steadily worse. . . . The grade of 
panhandlers is much lower than a year ago." 
</P>
<P>
Added Mike Duff, an assistant manager at San Diego Hardware on 5th Avenue: 
"Some of the ones I've encountered have told me they know nothing will happen 
if I call the police. They know that a police officer will just come out and 
tell them to move down the street." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Causing Friction 
</P>
<P>
Even the mild-mannered beggars are bad-mouthing their more forward colleagues. 
The problem: Respectful panhandlers are being driven out of town by the new 
breed -- many from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"People give these panhandlers money just to get them the hell out of their 
face," said James B., a soft-spoken 31-year-old who says he has lived on the 
streets downtown off and on for the past 10 years. On Friday, he was sitting 
beside a parking meter on North Harbor Drive, near Anthony's Seafood 
Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
For half an hour he sat mute, except to say "thank you" to a passer-by who gave 
him $2 after she noticed his small sign -- "Homeless An Hungry . . . God Love 
You All." 
</P>
<P>
Filley said that, because of jail overcrowding, chances are good that only 
those panhandlers who are cited repeatedly or who physically touch someone will 
be booked into jail. The problem, one downtown businessman said, is that some 
of the panhandlers are keenly aware of this. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Filley, who frequently lectures to employees of downtown businesses on how 
to avoid crime in the area, said police will continue their undercover efforts 
until "the problem is brought back down to a controllable norm." 
</P>
<P>
"Lately, 99% of the hands go up during my speeches when I ask how many people 
have been approached by a panhandler," Filley said. 
</P>
<P>
Filley said he has been told that some downtown workers are so timid that their 
first stop Monday mornings is at the bank for a roll of quarters -- a week's 
supply to fend off downtown panhandlers.

EFFORT ON TO EASE TRAFFIC AS FREEWAY IS WIDENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most any day, traffic along California 78, the four-lane freeway that spans 
North County from Oceanside through Escondido, is jampacked. 
</P>
<P>
Now, that irksome congestion stands to get worse, as work begins in the next 
few weeks on an ambitious, three-year project to expand the highway to six 
lanes. 
</P>
<P>
But help is in sight. 
</P>
<P>
The federal Urban Mass Transportation Administration has awarded a $1.2-million 
grant to spotlight ways to ease traffic woes during construction and into the 
years beyond. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traffic Plan Options 
</P>
<P>
Under the project, employers along the busy freeway will be asked to implement 
workday options to help reduce the number of trips by workers during peak 
commuting hours, alternative routes around construction congestion will be 
advocated and the increased use of van pools and shuttle busses will be 
explored. 
</P>
<P>
The effort is being spearheaded by the nonprofit North County Transportation 
Coalition, a private-sector group of local leaders eager to find solutions to 
the region's mounting traffic woes. 
</P>
<P>
A board composed of coalition members and representatives of the chambers of 
commerce from cities along the highway will run the program, with 
administrative help provided by the Oceanside Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the effort, the group wants to establish a radio network to provide 
continuing broadcasts about alternative routes during construction, to 
recommend the best hours to drive and to promote ride-sharing programs. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of capacity in the traffic system, it's just that we all want to 
use it at once," said John Duve, a Sandag transportation 
</P>
<P>
expert involved in the project. "If we want to avoid spending billions of 
dollars, then we'll have to find ways to ensure we don't all show up on the 
same roadway at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Among the ideas is to have employees occasionally work out of their homes to 
save a trip on the freeway. Firms would also be asked to voluntarily stagger 
work hours so that employees are on the freeway at different times. 
</P>
<P>
The feasibility of subscription buses and van pools will be explored, as will 
shuttle-bus service in commercial areas along the freeway. The proposals will 
presented to companies in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"This program will bring the private sector right to the table in terms of 
providing input into the solutions to our transportation problems," Duve said. 
"These are the people who sit in traffic, who are bumper to bumper, so they're 
in an excellent position to provide input." 
</P>
<P>
Similar efforts are under way in downtown San Diego and in the Golden Triangle 
of north San Diego. If successful, authorities hope the programs can serve as 
models. 
</P>
<P>
With work to begin soon along California 78, officials hope that motorists and 
employers will be ready to take part in the effort, Duve said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Duve said he hopes the effort will not die after the highway widening 
is finished. 
</P>
<P>
"The intention is that it will be an ongoing program," Duve said. "After the 
grant money runs out, we'll need to look at picking up other funds to keep the 
program running."

VIOLENCE AT BORDER DRAWS MEXICO'S FIRE; 
</P>
<P>
INQUIRY SOUGHT INTO SHOOTING BY U.S. AGENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second time this year, the Mexican government has lodged a protest over 
"violent acts" involving the shooting of illegal immigrants by Border Patrol 
agents in the Tijuana-San Diego border area. 
</P>
<P>
The latest criticism by the Mexican government stems from Tuesday's shooting of 
Francisco Ruiz Chavez, 23, after he allegedly hit a Border Patrol agent in the 
head with a rock. Also apprehended in the incident was a woman, Castenada 
Serna, 21, who was not injured but is still in custody. 
</P>
<P>
Ruiz was shot once in the abdomen and once in the groin. Witnesses said the 
border agent, who has not been identified, fired as he was falling down after 
reportedly being hit by the rock. Ruiz was hospitalized at UC San Diego Medical 
Center, where he is reported in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mexican government is deeply worried about the frequency of violent acts 
committed in U. S. territory against undocumented Mexicans, especially in the 
border zone of Tijuana-San Diego," the Mexican foreign ministry said in a 
statement Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Mexico's ambassador to Washington, Gustavo Petricioli, 
plans to ask the State and Justice departments for an investigation of the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mexican government has decided to make a gesture to the highest level of 
the U. S. government to ask for an exhaustive investigation, not only of this 
lamentable act but of the frequency of these violent acts occuring with the 
participation of U. S. police officials," according to the statement. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Smithburg, assistant chief patrol agent for the Border Patrol in San 
Diego, said his office has been told of the Mexican government's criticism. He 
said an official response to the protest would have to come from the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service's headquarters in Washington. Officials 
there were not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's episode took place in one of the most violent areas along the 
U.S.-Mexico border in San Diego, where there often are confrontations between 
U. S. authorities and Mexican bandits who prey upon those illegally crossing 
the border. 
</P>
<P>
The Border Patrol said one of its officers opened fire at about 11 a.m. when he 
was 
</P>
<P>
hit by at least one rock allegedly thrown, or carried in the hand, by Ruiz, who 
tried to stop the agent from arresting Serna. An American witness, Mary Ellis, 
saw the incident and told officials that Serna was putting up a fight as the 
agent tried to handcuff her. 
</P>
<P>
The confrontation occurred on U. S. land near a flood-control levee that runs 
just north of the border and west of the port of entry at San Ysidro, according 
to the Border Patrol. The agent was taken to a hospital, treated for his head 
wound and released. 
</P>
<P>
In January, the Mexican government protested the shooting deaths of two Mexican 
citizens by Border Patrol agents. 
</P>
<P>
In that incident, a special border crimes task force, which was formed to 
capture Mexican bandits who rob undocumented workers as they cross the border, 
fired on a group of men that U. S. law enforcement officials said threatened 
the elite police unit. 
</P>
<P>
The police unit opened fire and killed two men and wounded two others. Police 
investigators later found three screwdrivers and a machete at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government, however, painted a vastly different picture of the 
shooting. Mexican officials said the two dead men were gunned down from behind 
as they were fleeing the officers and attempting to run back into Mexico. The 
Mexican Embassy in Washington delivered a diplomatic note of protest over the 
shooting. And an attorney representing the families of the two dead men said he 
is planning to file a $15-million wrongful-death claim with U. S. authorities.

SMOG ALERT ISSUED FOR WEST HALF OF COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Air Pollution Control District issued a Stage 1 smog alert Friday for the 
western half of San Diego County for "unhealthful" air with ozone levels of 
more than 20 parts per 100 million -- a rating of 200 on the Pollutant Standard 
Index, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"From 0 to 50 on the Pollutant Standard Index is good. From 50 to 100 is 
moderate air. But when you go above 100 to 200 you're at unhealthful air," said 
Lynn Eldred, a spokeswoman for the district. 
</P>
<P>
The alert was declared for the coast to 30 miles inland from 3 to 5 p.m. and 
open burning was prohibited. Those with allergies or asthma were warned to stay 
indoors. People were encouraged not to exercise outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
During a smog alert, Eldred said, people should rest, curtail their activity, 
remain indoors, avoid heavily trafficked areas, avoid perfumes and dust, drink 
clear liquids such as juice and water and avoid smoking. 
</P>
<P>
There were four Stage 1 alerts in 1985, none in 1986, one in 1987 and two in 
1988, Eldred said. Friday's was the first this year.

 FILM PRODUCER HURT IN FALL FROM HORSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Movie producer Jerry Weintraub fell from his horse while riding on the beach 
near his Malibu home, suffering a mild concussion but emerging without any 
broken bones, his publicist said. 
</P>
<P>
Weintraub was wearing a neck brace at his Westwood office Thursday, spokesman 
Paul Bloch said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was galloping his horse Tuesday on the beach and the strap on the saddle 
became loose and he fell on his head," Bloch said, adding that Weintraub was 
treated for a mild concussion but was otherwise unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
Weintraub's latest film is the critically panned "Troop Beverly Hills." He is 
working on "Karate Kid III," Bloch said.

INMATE SETS HER BLOUSE AFIRE IN JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 28-year-old inmate from the County Jail at Las Colinas was in protective 
custody Friday after setting her clothes ablaze Thursday night, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenza J. Tenguelly was found by sheriff's deputies at 9:15 p.m. Thursday in 
her cell with burns on her face, hands and stomach after a fire alarm went off, 
a sheriff's spokesman said. She was alone at the time and no other inmates were 
assigned to her cell, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Tenguelly, who was housed in separate quarters for potentially violent or 
mentally disturbed inmates, apparently used matches to set her blouse on fire, 
the spokesman said. Tenguelly was taken to UC San Diego Medical Center, where 
she was treated for second-degree burns. She was transferred to County Mental 
Health Center, where she remains under guard, the spokesman said.

 HEROIN, 3 IRANIAN NATIONALS SEIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two owners of a downtown Los Angeles clothing shop and an Oriental rug salesman 
were arrested by federal agents who seized more than 6 pounds of heroin worth 
more than $6 million, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects, all Iranian nationals, were arrested Thursday night during a raid 
by agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Customs Service and the 
Postal Service, DEA spokesman Ralph Lochridge said. 
</P>
<P>
Abass Khajavi Rad, 55, the rug salesman, and the two co-owners of Nino Ferretti 
clothing, Farad Nickfardjan, 19, of Los Angeles, and Ayatollah Puret, 62, were 
all charged with the possession and distribution of heroin in violation of 
federal law, Lochridge said. 
</P>
<P>
The three were arrested while search warrants were served at the store, located 
in the garment district at 761 S. Los Angeles St., Lochridge said. 
</P>
<P>
The heroin had allegedly been smuggled via U.S. mail to Los Angeles and was 
contained inside two black-lacquered wall plaques with inlaid mother-of-pearl 
bird.

CAR OWNER SAYS FAKE BOMB WAS TO DETER RIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 24-year-old Kearny Mesa man, who told fire investigators that he rigged a 
fake pipe bomb to the tailpipe of his car to deter friends from asking for 
rides, was released Friday on $5,000 bail from County Jail, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Ferris of the 4200 block of Kirkcaldy Drive was arrested Thursday night on 
suspicion of possessing materials to make an explosive device, said John Buono, 
detective with the Metro Arson Strike Team. 
</P>
<P>
Ferris' car was the subject of a lengthy investigation at Morley Field, Buono 
said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Fire Department Capt. Larry Cooke said the explosive-device team 
answered a call just after 5:30 p.m. Thursday and found the pipe attached to 
the 1984 Volvo. 
</P>
<P>
Cooke said the device was a hollow pipe with a valve and wire attached to it. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators were on the scene for more than five hours, Buono said. They 
evacuated the area and X-rayed the pipe before determining that it was a phony, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Also summoned to the scene were agents from the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Ferris could face more charges, depending on what the district attorney's 
office decides after the case is forwarded to it next week, Buono said.

HILLCREST RESTAURANT'S PATRONS WARNED OF HEPATITIS THREAT FROM INFECTED WORKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN MAREE SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Patrons who ate certain foods at Alberto's Mexican Food restaurant at 409 
Washington St. in Hillcrest from March 18 through Wednesday may develop Type A 
hepatitis unless they receive proper treatment, San Diego County health 
officials warned Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Customers of the restaurant who ate raw lettuce, tomatoes, onions or salsa 
during that period, or who ate guacamole between 6 p.m. and 2 a.m., may have 
contracted the hepatitis from a restaurant worker who prepared those foods, 
said Nancy Bowen, acting county health officer for the Department of Health 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
Restaurant patrons are advised to receive a gamma globulin shot, which boosts 
the body's natural immune system, within two weeks of infection. "The shot 
arrests the symptoms," said Elaine Schmidt, health educator for the health 
department. 
</P>
<P>
The symptoms of the disease, which can take from 15 to 50 days to develop, 
include sudden fever, tiredness, nausea, abdominal discomfort and loss of 
appetite, followed in a couple of days by jaundice. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people who may have been exposed but may not yet have symptoms. If 
you already have symptoms, there's not much point in getting the gamma 
globulin. . . . If it's past the two-week period, just get plenty of rest, eat 
well and don't strain yourself. People can recover in as quickly as a week," 
Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
The virus can be transmitted through contaminated water, shellfish from 
contaminated water and by workers who do not have good hygiene habits, Schmidt 
said. "It's transmitted fecal-to-food, so if someone doesn't wash their hands 
after going to the bathroom, that's how you can get it." 
</P>
<P>
The unidentified worker has not returned to work since Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
Muslims in Southern California and around the world will begin the monthlong 
fasting period of Ramadan on Friday, ceremoniously beginning with the sighting 
of the slim crescent of the moon. 
</P>
<P>
Ramadan commemorates the tradition that the Prophet Mohammed received the 
revelations of the Koran in 611. The custom of daytime fasting on the ninth 
month of the Muslim calendar was initiated by Mohammed and his followers in 
624. 
</P>
<P>
From dawn to dusk each day during Ramadan, faithful and physically able Muslims 
are expected to abstain from food, drink, smoking and sex. 
</P>
<P>
Each evening meal is a celebration, and mosque attendance grows during this 
month, said Muzammil H. Siddiqi, the spiritual director of the Islamic Society 
of Orange County in Garden Grove. "Ramadan seems to bind together both 
immigrant Muslims and native Americans who accepted Islam during the last 25 to 
30 years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Siddiqi, who has a Harvard Ph.D. in comparative religion, will talk about the 
virtually unanimous Muslim objections to "The Satanic Verses," the 
controversial novel by Salman Rushdie, in a public lecture at 7 p.m. Tuesday at 
UC Riverside. The talk, in the Watkins building on the campus, is co-sponsored 
by the Muslim Students Assn. of Riverside and the university's Program in 
Religious Studies. 
</P>
<P>
RESOLUTION 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Board of Rabbis recently recommended that "unfermented 
grape juice is made available" in any sacred or social event, public or 
private, at all synagogues and that the juice be placed in an easily accessible 
location. The resolution was proposed by Rabbi Allen Freehling of University 
Synagogue, who said the step would "acknowledge that we have a number of 
recovering alcoholics and that children should not be encouraged to abuse 
intoxicating drinks." After a year with a similar policy at his Brentwood 
synagogue, Freehling said "at least half of the people" prefer the grape juice. 
</P>
<P>
PEOPLE 
</P>
<P>
The prolific work of John Hick, 67, professor of the philosophy of religion at 
Claremont Graduate School, will be discussed by British and American scholars 
in a two-day conference starting Friday morning at Claremont McKenna College. 
Hick's 20th book, "An Interpretation of Religion," was just published by Yale 
University Press. His liberal theological views were the center of contention a 
few years ago when he asked to transfer his ministerial credentials to the 
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) from the United Reformed Church in England. Hick 
eventually withdrew his request. 
</P>
<P>
ACTION 
</P>
<P>
In a joint letter, regional leaders of 13 Christian and Jewish denominations 
"strongly urge" Gov. Deukmejian to sign a bill to curtail sales of automatic 
weapons if one of several proposals is passed by the State Legislature. The 
governor has that indicated he will sign a measure to control sales of 
automatic rifles that have no sporting value. "We believe that prohibiting the 
sale and use of particularly deadly weapons such as automatic rifles would 
lessen public danger," said the letter, dated Tuesday and written on the 
stationery of United Methodist Bishop Jack M. Tuell. Other signers included 
Catholic Archbishop Roger M. Mahony, Episcopal Bishop Frederick Borsch, 
Lutheran Bishop J. Roger Anderson and Armenian Archbishop Vatche Hovsepian.

L.A. COUNCIL ENDORSEMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles is a big city with big problems. Dirty air, clogged traffic, rapid 
development, murderous gangs, not enough cops, overflowing landfills, 
inadequate sewers and a housing squeeze are among the city's most pressing 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council must choose among competing needs. The best 
members consider not only their own districts but the needs of the whole city. 
Because of their experience -- and in one race the lack of strong challengers 
-- we endorse the eight incumbents on the April 11 primary ballot. 
</P>
<P>
In the 3rd District -- which covers the West San Fernando Valley -- Joy Picus, 
58, a three-term veteran, deserves high marks for pushing through an ordinance 
banning discrimination against women, minorities and Jews at private clubs. 
Picus is knowledgeable about toxic wastes, the environment and personnel 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
In the 5th District -- which covers much of West Los Angeles and Sherman Oaks 
-- Zev Yaroslavsky, 40, a four-term veteran, has worked to expand the Police 
Department and has been active in planning issues. His vigorous leadership is 
needed on the council. 
</P>
<P>
In the 7th District -- which covers the Northeast San Fernando Valley -- Ernani 
Bernardi, 77, spends public money as if it were his own. He challenges any hint 
of exorbitance or waste and makes do with a smaller staff, a smaller car and a 
more modest office than his colleagues. He faces two attractive challengers -- 
Lyle Hall, a veteran firefighter, union leader and lobbyist from Reseda who 
outlines a strong vision for the district, and Jules Bagneris III, a bright 
young minister from Lake View Terrace who offers forthright strategies for 
crime prevention, jobs creation and housing stimulation. But, Bernardi, the 
conscience of the council when it comes to spending, deserves another term. 
</P>
<P>
In the 9th District -- which covers downtown, Little Tokyo and South Central 
Los Angeles -- Gil Lindsay, 88, and a councilman since 1963, is justifiably 
proud of the towering downtown skyline, but the gleam has not touched much of 
the city's poorest district. Home to stable working-class black communities, 
growing Latino neighborhoods and thousands of homeless people, the district 
needs jobs, housing, more police and just about everything else. He has no 
credible challenger. 
</P>
<P>
In the 13th District -- which covers Hollywood, Silver Lake and Studio City -- 
Mike Woo, 37, a hard-working, first-term councilman, tempers his vision of a 
vibrant Central Hollywood with support for reductions in the massive 
redevelopment plan and concerns about runaway traffic. He depends on his 
planning background when reconciling the district's growing anti-growth 
sentiment with the growing need for more affordable housing and more jobs. 
</P>
<P>
In the 15th District -- which covers San Pedro, the Harbor, Wilmington and 
Watts -- Joan Milke Flores, 52, a two-term veteran, pushes for redevelopment in 
diverse communities that would be otherwise ignored. She champions a more 
even-handed delivery of city services and takes a keen interest in the Housing 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
Two incumbents are unopposed. In the 1st District -- which covers part of the 
Eastside, Mount Washington and Pico-Union -- Gloria Molina deserves reelection. 
In the 11th District -- which covers the Far Westside, Tarzana and Encino -- 
Marvin Braude merits another term. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council governs on behalf of at least 3.3 million people 
who live within boundaries that encompass 463.7 square miles. We believe 
Molina, Picus, Yaroslavsky, Bernardi, Lindsay, Braude, Woo and Flores should be 
returned to the council on April 11th.

'CULTURAL DIFFERENCES' AND FOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I agree the two Cambodian refugees should be persuaded to share our scruples. 
After all, to paraphrase Mark Twain, we would only be adhering to that great 
American principle that nothing needs reforming so much as other people's 
habits. 
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian methods are inefficient. They kill only one dog and have to do 
the deed themselves. We Americans, on the other hand, have them killed by the 
thousands in institutions where we can comfortably ignore their whimpers. 
</P>
<P>
And killing for food? Really! Nothing so pedestrian as that here in America. We 
kill our animals because they're a nuisance to us. 
</P>
<P>
Those poor refugees have a lot to learn about our way of life. I hope that 
after they've been here a few years they will understand. Maybe they can 
explain it to me.

"700 Abortion Foes Arrested at L.A. Clinic" scream the headline. All that 
misguided energy and passion -- and for what? -- to deny women the right of 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
How many of these protesters have adopted an "unadoptable" child who was 
unwanted or abused after birth; helped teach learning-disabled children in an 
inner-city school who were born drug-dependent or have other problems that none 
of us can begin to know; or even more to the heart of the problem, written or 
lobbied Sacramento to protest the imminent closing of family planning and 
health care clinics here in California due to budget cuts, cuts which, among 
other consequences, will serve to increase the number of unwanted pregnancies? 
</P>
<P>
Here in the United States we have the highest infant mortality rate of any 
industrialized country. Are these protesters also working for better prenatal 
health care and are they willing to pay for this care through higher taxes? 
</P>
<P>
After the demonstrations are over, the protesters will leave Los Angeles and 
return home, self-righteous and energized by their actions. Meanwhile, the 
aftermath of their symbolic efforts, the unwanted children, children who should 
be our nation's brightest hope, are left behind.

<P>
I was present at the mid-Wilshire protest by Operation Rescue on Saturday. 
Although I have since heard several testimonies to the contrary, the police 
officers that I observed carried out their distasteful duties in a 
professional, exemplary manner. The blame for the charges of brutality does not 
lie with them, but with the policy decision that authorized the use of pain 
compliance techniques on nonviolent, almost pacifistic protesters. 
</P>
<P>
I was appalled and not a little bit sickened to see elderly ladies, whose only 
"resistance" to arrest consisted of going limp, having their arms, wrists and 
fingers twisted into painful positions. Although Gates and Deputy Chief Robert 
Vernon were certainly in a difficult position on Saturday, they and my city 
councilman will receive a letter asking for an explanation of this particular 
policy.

'TITTERING AT NIXON' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Roger Morris' diatribe against former President Richard Nixon ("While Tittering 
at Nixon, Don't Underestimate the Web He Wove," Op-Ed Page, March 5) can best 
be understood in terms of a subject neither Morris nor The Times, in its 
biographical blurb, saw fit to mention. It is impossible to discuss President 
Franklin Roosevelt without reference to the Depression, or President Lincoln 
without mentioning the Civil War. That Morris managed to get through four 
columns on Nixon without mentioning the central event of the Nixon years, the 
war in Vietnam, is particularly fascinating in view of Morris' own actions as a 
member of the Nixon Administration at a fateful moment during that war. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, American and South Vietnamese forces were suffering terrible and 
unnecessary losses at the hands of communist troops who for years had been 
attacking from privileged sanctuaries in Cambodia. President Nixon ordered the 
sanctuaries cleared out, a move which objective historians of the war concede 
saved untold American and South Vietnamese lives and shattered the communists' 
offensive capacity in the region for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Your blurb about Morris neglects to mention that he was serving on the National 
Security Council staff at the time of the Cambodian incursion. What did he do 
when President Nixon ordered an attack on the sanctuaries? He quit. He, and 
many others, made the absurd claim that by depriving communist troops of the 
wherewithal to kill Americans and South Vietnamese, Nixon was "widening" the 
war. 
</P>
<P>
During 1973-75, congressional support for Saigon evaporated, and Soviet support 
for North Vietnam escalated. It is no surprise, therefore, that the South 
ultimately could not prevail. 
</P>
<P>
In Vietnam the new communist regime has driven half a million souls to their 
deaths in the South China Sea, and in Cambodia 1 million to 2 million have 
perished in an awful holocaust. Someday, we as a nation will have to come to 
terms with what happened in Indochina when American authority was withdrawn. I 
don't expect Morris to help us solve that problem. But I would suggest that The 
Times should have seen fit to inform its readers that its correspondent was not 
a dispassionate historian but a man who has a personal interest in debunking 
Nixon. For if history proves him right about one of the most controversial and 
fateful decisions of his presidency, where will that leave Morris? 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of history, I wonder whether Morris' column contains an example of his 
historical method. He writes of a virtual chorus of "ridicule and . . . dismay" 
among conservatives about Nixon's just-published White House memos and then, to 
prove his point, quotes from a single column by James Kilpatrick. That's the 
only negative statement I've seen or heard from a conservative about the 
collection, and I suspect I read and talk to more conservatives than Morris 
does. On the other hand, after reading the same book, the New Republic's 
Hendrik Hertzberg wrote, "The last eight years have made Nixon look good in 
unexpected ways. Reading his memos, one has to admire his formidable 
intelligence, his analytical sharpness . . . his vast knowledge of politics and 
government." Using Morris' technique, I would define this as "a vast outpouring 
of praise from the former President's erstwhile critics."

WINDMILLS AND WILDFLOWERS: DEBATE OVER GORMAN HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For at least 40 years I have passed the Gorman muffin-shaped hills that 
Barnbaum wrote about. Each spring I, too, have marveled at the color which 
seemingly couldn't have been trapped for a year beneath the surface of the 
earth. 
</P>
<P>
I feel Barnbaum's column was too soft -- environmentalists, for the most part, 
are that way. We must not question our anger about the wind turbines. If you 
don't believe me, just take a drive over the Tehachepi pass to the east and 
then tell me you love the view. 
</P>
<P>
We don't have much time. Somehow, even with the cattle munching on those 
rounded hills, the flowers still spring forth each year. The short-term view is 
easy, but wind turbines are permanent with their pads and access roads. We must 
make an effort to protect these hills or the land will be gone with the wind.

DEMONSTRATIONS BY OPERATION RESCUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the ripe age of 50, I joined my first demonstration. I was one of the 
counter-demonstrators, supporting Planned Parenthood, "defending" a clinic on 
March 25 against the illegal blockade by the Operation Rescue zealots. 
</P>
<P>
For me, the catalyst was quite simple. A small, driven minority, no matter how 
sincere, is using illegal tactics to impose its religious views on a majority. 
Further, their movement is controlled by men on an issue which primarily 
affects women. One ayatollah is enough, and there is no place for another in 
our midst. 
</P>
<P>
As to "Paul" of Torrance (mentioned in the March 26 article), if he is so 
intent in saving babies what does he do to help the abandoned ones, the abused 
children, the homeless ones, the runaways and child prostitutes? 
</P>
<P>
I will continue to support Planned Parenthood by available legal means to help 
stop this insidious attack on the democratic process.

'CULTURAL DIFFERENCES' AND FOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The editorial gave me an entirely new viewpoint that I had not considered 
before. Instead of being incensed that these two men would club and hack a 
puppy to death for their dinner, I should have taken a more understanding 
attitude. Maybe I should have paid a neighborly visit to their home (and they 
are my neighbors, the incident happened a short two blocks from where I have 
owned my home for the last 20 years). I could have taken them a pot roast of 
beef and explained that perhaps in future they should stick to a more 
acceptable fare, that in this country we frown on eating our dogs. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps this would have had a more positive effect in the Cambodian community. 
It just probably had never occurred to them that killing dogs for food was not 
acceptable in our culture. Maybe we could arrange to show them some old Lassie 
movies, somehow get through to them that we hold our dogs in high esteem, we do

<P>
All of the above is baloney, and you know it as well as I do. There is only one 
way to stop these people from killing our dogs and cats to eat, and that is to 
put some laws on the books, with teeth in them, and take them to court every 
time they are caught, so to avoid the hassle they will start buying their meat 
down at the market like the rest of us and leave our pets alone.

I'm sure you'll get barraged with complaints about Chief Gates' aggressive

A woman considering an abortion is in fact considering denying the 
responsibility associated with rearing that child. Few women undertake such a 
decision lightly, and those who would force the woman to follow through and 
bear the child under such circumstances cannot claim to have the child's 
welfare at heart, gut-level sloganeering notwithstanding.

POLICE ISSUE SKETCH OF SUSPECT IN AMBUSH SLAYING OF TEACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A drawing of a suspect in the shooting death of Grant High School teacher Hal 
Arthur was released Friday after a witness who saw the man speeding away from 
the ambush scene contacted authorities this week. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police said the suspect is white, in his 30s with dark brown, wavy 
hair and a slight mustache. According to the witness' description, the suspect 
is about 6 feet tall and 175 pounds. He was seen driving away from the scene of 
the shooting in front of Arthur's Sherman Oaks home in a new gray or black 
sedan with a squarish back end and no license plates. 
</P>
<P>
The description came from a person who police described as a key witness in the 
murder investigation, which so far has not turned up a motive or an identified 
suspect. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gunned Down March 24 
</P>
<P>
Arthur, 60, a longtime and well- respected teacher, was shot three times from 
behind at 6 a.m. March 24 as he prepared to get into his car parked in front of 
his home in the 13900 block of Milbank Street. He was going to work when he was 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
Citing safety reasons, police refused to identify the witness or say from where 
the person saw the suspect. Police also declined to say how the witness was 
able to provide a complete description of the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"We have confirmed that the witness was at a place and time where the witness 
would have seen the suspect," said Lt. Warren Knowles, commander of the Van 
Nuys Division detective bureau. 
</P>
<P>
One of Arthur's neighbors earlier reported seeing a dark sedan drive from the 
scene of the shooting but police had found no other witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Knowles said the witness did not call police until Sunday because of safety 
concerns. The drawing was not made until Thursday, when detectives went to a 
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department artist after learning that a Los 
Angeles police artist would be unavailable until next week because of a large 
caseload. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, detectives attended the classes formerly taught by Arthur at Grant 
to show the drawing to students. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Leads in Case 
</P>
<P>
Knowles said that detectives have few leads in the case and that after a week 
of exhaustive investigation have been unable to determine the motive behind the 
slaying. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not zeroing in on any direction," Knowles said. "It has been terribly 
frustrating. Usually, when a homicide occurs we are led in a particular 
direction. We don't have that here." 
</P>
<P>
Knowles said detectives have interviewed several of Arthur's friends and 
business associates and have found no record of financial problems or disputes 
that offer clues to his murderer. He said repeated interviews with Arthur's 
family have also yielded nothing. 
</P>
<P>
The drawing of the suspect appears to have eliminated any current students from 
involvement in the killing, Knowles said, but police will continue to look for 
possible suspects among the teacher's former students. 
</P>
<P>
"That has a strong potential," Knowles said. "We do have to go back to include 
any former students." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Los Angeles Unified School District announced a $10,000 reward 
for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Arthur's killer. 
Officials said the district's teachers union, United Teachers-Los Angeles, is 
also offering a $5,000 reward.

FIRE DESTROYS LEMON WAREHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An investigation into the cause of a blaze that gutted a Camarillo packinghouse 
full of lemons may be delayed several days while workers pump more than 200,000 
gallons of water from the warehouse's basement, fire officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like a big old vat of stale lemonade," said John Wade, a spokesman 
for the Ventura County Fire Department. "It's a mess." 
</P>
<P>
The water was sprayed by firefighters battling the three-alarm fire that 
erupted near midnight Thursday at the Paramount Citrus Assn., a 
45,000-square-foot structure at 215 Dawson Drive in an industrial area east of 
the city's downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, to which 60 firefighters responded, caused an estimated $7 million in 
damage and destroyed 24 tons of lemons, 14 tons of which were stored in the 
basement. 
</P>
<P>
The loss is a fraction of the county's lemon crop, which last year totaled 
341,630 tons from seven packinghouses, said Ken Weiss, Ventura County's deputy 
agricultural commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
John O'Brien, chief financial officer for Paramount Citrus, said the company, 
which handled the output of 25 Ventura County growers, will ask other 
packinghouses to handle the remainder of this year's crop. 
</P>
<P>
He said the firm hopes to rebuild the one-story packinghouse, although not 
necessarily on the same site. "This is not the end of our business in 
Camarillo," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The packinghouse was one of three operated by the firm, with the others in Kern 
and Fresno counties. The company is selling a fourth packinghouse in San Diego 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials originally feared that the water may have been so contaminated 
by paints and solvents in the basement that workers would have to take special 
steps to dispose of it. 
</P>
<P>
However, an investigation Friday by the county's Department of Environmental 
Health concluded that the water posed no risk. 
</P>
<P>
"The amount of chemicals is small compared to the amount of water," said Greg 
Smith, an environmental health specialist. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said they had not determined the cause of the fire in the 
68-year-old building, which was undergoing renovation.

MAN ESCAPING FROM CAPTORS ABDUCTS 2 GIRLS IN VAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A presumed kidnap victim became a kidnaper himself Friday night when he escaped 
his captors at a service station in Castaic by stealing a car with two young 
girls in it and fleeing through gunfire, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
The two little girls -- Amanda, 4, and Jana Engholm, 2 -- were found about an 
hour later, apparently unharmed, in the abandoned van in Pasadena, deputies 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Their hometown was unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
A young black man, who had apparently been abducted from Los Angeles by at 
least three other black men, stole a silver 1987 Dodge Caravan containing the 
two sisters, said Sheriff's Lt. Ed Chenal of the Santa Clarita Valley station. 
</P>
<P>
Chenal said that the original kidnaping may have been drug- and gang-related. 
The children were waiting in the van for their father to pay for gasoline when 
the other group arrived in two cars to buy fuel. The man escaped from his 
captors, leaped into the van and sped off, Chenal said. 
</P>
<P>
Chenal said the original kidnapers pursued the van and shot at it. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies caught one of the pursuing cars and arrested one suspect, he said.

FOCUS ON OWNERSHIP;

<P>
OPPONENTS TO ASK JUDGE TO RESCIND TEMPLE LEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The fate of a controversial plan to build a Jewish temple on a former Pierce 
College cornfield in Woodland Hills may hinge on a judge ruling whether the 
land is part of the campus. Leaders of a Woodland Hills homeowners group 
announced Friday that they will go to court next week to demand that the Los 
Angeles Community College District rescind a Jewish group's lease on a 17 
1/2-acre Victory Boulevard site. They claim that the rental is an illegal use 
of Pierce College land. 
</P>
<P>
District administrators vowed to fight the challenge by arguing that the 
acreage is surplus district property and is not part of the Pierce College 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
The pending showdown came as members of the Woodland Hills Homeowners 
Organization voted not to drop the lawsuit that the group filed four months ago 
in hopes of blocking the district's lease with Temple Shir Chadash. 
</P>
<P>
College trustees voted in 1986 to rent the vacant land for 75 years to the 
temple for $3 million. The land, long used for Pierce College agricultural 
school crops, is a block east of the main campus. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Angry Homeowners 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners were angered when temple officials disclosed that they needed only 
about five acres for their synagogue and announced plans to build a residential 
retirement project on the other 12 acres as a profit-making venture. 
</P>
<P>
Temple leaders later agreed to substitute single-family homes for the 
residential retirement development. But the homeowners group decided to sue to 
block that plan too. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, homeowners voted to reject a district request to drop the suit. 
In making the request, the district said it has a new chancellor who "has a 
different approach to handling real property disposition issues" and might 
resolve the issue without a court battle. 
</P>
<P>
Rosemary Woodlock, president of the homeowners organization, said her group 
will seek a summary judgment against the district next week "on the basis of 
separation of church and state." 
</P>
<P>
Antonio Cosby-Rossmann, the group's lawyer, said Friday that the lease violates 
a state Education Code provision requiring that rental of college grounds to 
religious organizations be for a temporary period and only when the 
organization cannot find an alternative site. He said the law also mandates 
that the rent be set at fair market value. 
</P>
<P>
Cosby-Rossmann said that 75 years does not qualify as a temporary use and that 
the $3-million rent is far below the going rate for valuable Woodland Hills 
land. 
</P>
<P>
He accused college officials of sidestepping the question of the lease's 
legality when the rental agreement was approved in 1986. "They were basically 
playing hide-the-ball with their own trustees," Cosby-Rossmann said. 
</P>
<P>
A college district lawyer refused Friday to discuss the issue. 
</P>
<P>
But David Czamanske, district contracts coordinator, disputed the homeowners' 
interpretation of the law. 
</P>
<P>
He said the college district views the 17 1/2-acre site as surplus district 
land to which the state Education Code provision does not apply. He said it is 
not part of the Pierce College campus. He said the district stands by the 
contract and will defend it in court. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see it as college grounds, not at all," Czamanske said. "I would hope 
the judge would read it the same way we do." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Constitutional Issue 
</P>
<P>
Czamanske also denied that officials skirted the legality issue when college 
trustees voted on the lease. Separation of church and state is a constitutional 
issue and is not governed by the state Education Code, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Caught in the dispute Friday were officials of Temple Shir Chadash, a 
400-member Reform synagogue based in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope and pray this ends soon," said Anita Green, congregation president. "We 
want to build on that property. It's three years already. We can touch it and 
feel it. This is the community we want to be in." 
</P>
<P>
The fight between homeowners and college officials is costing the congregation, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're paying $15,000 a month in interest to sit and watch the college and the 
homeowners fight with one another. We're sorry we're in the middle."

2 ARRESTED IN CAR BOMBING TIED TO REMARK ABOUT WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A homemade bomb blasted a student's unoccupied car at Cal State Northridge on 
Friday, apparently as revenge because the car's owner made a comment about 
another man's girlfriend, Los Angeles police said. Two suspects were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Quinn, 20, and Kurtis Jensen, 21, both of Los Angeles, were arrested on 
suspicion of possession of a destructive device after the 12:30 a.m. explosion 
damaged the car, which was parked in a student housing parking lot in the 9500 
block of Zelzah Avenue, police said. 
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries. Police declined to identify the car's 20-year-old 
owner, a student at CSUN. The suspects, who were being held at the Van Nuys 
Jail in lieu of $16,000 bail each, are not students at the school, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Detective Patrick Metoyer of the Criminal Conspiracy Unit 
said the car bombing was motivated by a dispute between Quinn and the car's 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
"You're talking about your basic stupid thing," Metoyer said. The car owner 
"made a comment about one suspect's girlfriend and it went from there." 
</P>
<P>
The small explosive device, which police declined to describe, was placed on 
the rear window of the 1970 Mustang, police said. The blast blew out two of the 
car's windows, tore holes in the trunk and roof, and partially burned the back 
end of the car. Nearby vehicles were not damaged. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been of sufficient force to cause serious injuries," said 
Metoyer, who added that investigators believe that the intent was to damage the 
car, not to harm anyone.

NO DANGEROUS GAS LEAKS FOUND AT DUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tests conducted by the California Waste Management Board have found no evidence 
of dangerous gas leaking from the edges of the Lopez Canyon Landfill, a board 
spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a gas migration problem, at least where we were able to test," 
said board spokesman Chris Peck. "And we went all around the site, especially 
into the areas nearest to residences." 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results of neighborhood air testing by the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District also turned up no alarming levels of chemicals, said 
spokesman Tom Eichhorn. Although no state health standards have been set for 
most gases present at landfills, Eichhorn said the gases detected were "within 
the normal range that you would find at a landfill." 
</P>
<P>
Edward J. Avila, president of the Los Angeles Board of Public Works, called the 
results reassuring. However, Rob Zapple, a member of the Kagel Canyon Civic 
Assn., which wants the landfill closed, viewed the testing more skeptically 
because it did not consider the potential for health problems from breathing 
even the lower level of gases. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Intermittent Problem 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thankful for the testing, I'm thankful that it came out all right, but I'm 
certainly not satisfied," Zapple said. "They were in place for just a few days, 
while the odor comes and goes. At times the odor is very strong, and I know it 
is indicative of gases flowing off the landfill." 
</P>
<P>
The Waste Management Board testing, which was conducted at 25 locations around 
the city-owned dump earlier this week, and the air district testing in three 
locations were prompted by a March 8 gas release that sent two workers to the 
hospital and made four others ill. 
</P>
<P>
Cause of the workers' illness was never determined because the city waited two 
days before reporting the incident, rendering tests inconclusive. State and 
local officials, however, believe that it was caused by a pocket of toxic 
hydrogen sulfide gas trapped in decaying 1982 trash that the workers unearthed. 
</P>
<P>
The air district tested for methane, a common landfill gas, and hydrogen 
sulfide, but the Waste Management Board tested only for methane because it is 
easier to detect with available state equipment, Peck said. 
</P>
<P>
"Methane is an indicator that other things might be present," he said. "If 
there's not methane, there's likely not anything else." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Remained Open 
</P>
<P>
After the March 8 incident, the state threatened to close the dump until 
testing proved that no health dangers persisted. However, the state agreed to 
withdraw that order when initial air tests found no significant levels of toxic 
gases. 
</P>
<P>
The air district issued a citation against the city the following week because 
the workers who unearthed the gaseous trash were digging a road without a 
required district permit. On Wednesday, the district issued a second citation 
to the city based on odor reports from landfill neighbors over Easter weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The two violations, each of which carries a $25,000 maximum fine, have been 
turned over to the air district's legal staff, which will determine what 
actions the city must take. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez Canyon, the city's only remaining public landfill, which accepts more 
than half of the 7,000 tons of household rubbish produced daily, must install a 
gas recovery system by early July under district regulations. Eichhorn said the 
system should reduce the likelihood of future gas release and odor incidents. 
</P>
<P>
"Those burps are natural byproducts of landfills and that's why the gas 
collection systems are necessary," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the second district violation, Avila said the city assigned two 
industrial waste inspectors to the dump full time to keep track of landfill 
operations. "We call them toxic cops," he said. The city also installed a 
24-hour hot line that the district can call whenever it receives citizens' 
complaints about odor. 
</P>
<P>
"What I think we're saying to the community there is we're committed to being 
good neighbors," Avila said. "We understand that no one wants a landfill in 
their neighborhood, but we also know we're committed to picking up the trash 
and taking it somewhere."

HELICOPTER GROUNDED AFTER BACK-YARD LANDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are places where helicopter landings are allowed, but Northridge yards 
are not among them. 
</P>
<P>
Ezra Raiten, 37, a developer, was cited by the Los Angeles Fire Department on 
Friday for landing a helicopter in his back yard without a city permit. 
Neighbors complained to police about four takeoffs and landings Friday 
afternoon and at least one incident Thursday and another Sunday, Fire Capt. 
James Gaffney said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials grounded the jet-powered, single-engine Aerospatiale AS-350 
helicopter and ordered Raiten to remove it by trailer, Gaffney said. The 
French-made aircraft is registered to Raiten Development Corp., he said. 
</P>
<P>
Raiten's purpose in flying the chopper into the quiet residential neighborhood 
was not known, Gaffney said. 
</P>
<P>
Raiten had an attorney with him when fire officials questioned him, "and there 
wasn't much conversation," Gaffney said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials on Monday will notify the Federal Aviation Administration, which 
licenses and polices pilots, of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
The likelihood of the city issuing Raiten a permit to use his back yard as a 
helicopter pad is nil, Gaffney said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way we would allow that," he said. "There's just no way. You just 
can't do it." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the safety and noise concerns associated with landing near homes, 
the Raiten property is about 200 yards from Balboa Boulevard Elementary School, 
he said. Several people who called to complain about the helicopter were 
worried about the safety of children in the area, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Johnson, 14, who lives just north of Raiten's property in the 17000 
block of Lassen Street, said the helicopter's passing overhead was "loud enough 
to jitter things around" in his back yard. But he said it didn't bother him. 
</P>
<P>
Raiten declined to comment.

RUNAWAY VAN KILLS CANOGA PARK YOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 16-year-old Canoga Park boy was killed when a van he was attempting to 
jump-start from underneath suddenly took off, dragging him several feet before 
crashing into a brick wall, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred shortly after 6 p.m. Thursday in an alley near the 
intersection of Friar Street and Vanalden Avenue in Reseda, said Los Angeles 
Police Officer Frank Zdroy. The victim, whose identity was withheld pending 
notification of relatives, was taken to Tarzana Medical Center. He died there a 
short time later, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
No other injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
Zdroy said the boy was beneath a 1977 Dodge van trying to jump-start the 
vehicle when it took off. 
</P>
<P>
"The parking brake was not set and there was a wooden block on the accelerator 
pedal," Zdroy said.

HURST IS HURTING, NOT HURT; 
</P>
<P>
HIS SHOULDER IS SORE, BUT THAT'S ALL; PADRES UNCONCERNED 
</P>

<P>
It has been called everything from sore to stiff to torn to dislocated to 
broken. The problem has been publicly diagnosed as being in his bones. Or was 
that his muscles? Maybe his ligaments? 
</P>
<P>
The talk reached a pitch Wednesday when Bruce Hurst slipped into the Scripps 
Clinic for a shoulder examination and somebody found out about it and . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I'm driving with my car radio, and I hear this big news report about Hurst's 
shoulder and the words 'rotator cuff' mentioned," Padre Manager Jack McKeon 
said. "Rotator cuff, seriously. I started laughing. I really started laughing." 
</P>
<P>
But $5.25-million pitcher Bruce Hurst, who has had two examinations on his left 
shoulder this spring and often complained of stiffness, is not laughing. 
</P>
<P>
So what is it? Is Hurst hurting? Or will he be able to duplicate his spring 
stats, which have shown no signs of pain as he has gone 4-1 with a 2.70 ERA 
this spring with 27 strikeouts in 30 innings? 
</P>
<P>
The answer, apparently, is both. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst explained his problem in depth for the first time Friday before the 
Padres' 8-5 loss in 10 innings to the Seattle Mariners at Cashman Field here, 
which finished the Padres' exhibition season record at 18-8-1, a club record. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst wasn't the only news here. McKeon announced he is uncertain who will 
start opening night at third base. Although Randy Ready, Tim Flannery and Luis 
Salazar will spend the season sharing the job there, most thought Ready would 
get the ceremonial first start. 
</P>
<P>
The bigger question surrounded Hurst, a question he was glad to answer. The 
Wednesday examination -- a magnetic resonance imagery test that takes a picture 
of the inside of the shoulder -- revealed an "impingement" of the shoulder 
muscles around the rotator cuff. But the rotator cuff itself looked fine. 
</P>
<P>
Translated? Sore shoulder. Nothing more, nothing less. And guys have won Cy 
Young awards with sore shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to understand, impingement is a word that just came around a few 
years ago," Padre trainer Dick Dent said. "Before, when a guy had this problem, 
it was just a sore shoulder. And a lot of guys pitch with sore shoulders. It is 
just one of the hazards of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Said Hurst, "There's a difference between being injured and being hurt. Hurt, 
you can play through." 
</P>
<P>
Hurst said it feels good when he is warm and sweating and tightens up when he 
is cold. He said that although he has been able to control the stiffness with 
medication and exercises, last week he struggled in the chilly late innings of 
a 4-2 victory over the Chicago Cubs. It was close enough to the start of the 
season to convince him to undergo Wednesday's examination. 
</P>
<P>
The exam was not ordered by doctors. It was requested by Hurst. 
</P>
<P>
"I would rather be safe than sorry," Hurst said. "It was just for reassurance. 
They made a big investment in me here, and I want to be healthy, I want to do 
well, I want to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be really disappointed if something happened, and I couldn't pitch. So I 
just wanted to be careful. So why not?" 
</P>
<P>
Said Dent: "He wanted it looked at, and we gladly obliged. If it makes a guy 
feel better, fine. And it certainly can make us feel better." 
</P>
<P>
This doesn't mean Hurst will be able to finish early season games in cold 
weather cities. But this certainly doesn't mean he can't make every start. 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of thing happens to most of the pitchers at some time, and I guess 
it finally had to happen to me," said Hurst, 31, an eight-year veteran. "I keep 
doing my medication and exercises, and I can deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
That said, the Padres must now deal with uncertainty at third base for Monday 
night's opener against San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
When asked rather routinely Friday about the identity of his starting third 
baseman that night, McKeon said, "I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
When asked if he was just being coy, and would say that about all positions, he 
said, "No." 
</P>
<P>
When asked how he would make his decision between the three third basemen, he 
said, "I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
In other words Randy Ready, who was listed as McKeon's starting third baseman 
when spring training began but has since hit .224 with five errors there, may 
have officially fallen out of favor. And Tim Flannery, the left-handed hitter 
who does well against San Francisco opening day right-handed starter Rick 
Reuschel, is back in the picture. Salazar, who just joined the team as a 
utility player from Detroit last week, remains a long shot. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing certain is, McKeon isn't sure. 
</P>
<P>
"One night I think it will be this guy, another night I think it will be 
another guy," McKeon said with a smile. "When I'm eating salad, I think it will 
be Salazar. When I'm eating fish, I think of Flannery. When I'm eating red 
meat, I think of Ready." 
</P>
<P>
Seriously, McKeon said, "They are all going to play there this season, so 
what's the difference? Nobody is going to get cheated. They are all going to 
get a chance. Who will be the first starter will have nothing to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
While Ready lately has not wished to discuss the third base situation, Flannery 
said while a start would be nice, he realizes it doesn't mean much over the 
long haul. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just one of 162 games, one day in a long season," said Flannery, hitting 
.366 this spring while Salazar is hitting .272 with the Padres (.250 overall). 
"We'll all get in there and make our contributions, have our months." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Padres blew a 4-1 lead, allowing the Mariners seven runs in the game's 
final three innings. Reliever Mark Davis was the culprit, giving up six hits 
and five runs in 2 1/3 innings after entering in the eighth with a 4-2 lead. 
Tim Flannery's 10th inning error allowed the eventual winning run to score. . . 
. Darnell Coles' seventh-inning homer off of Walt Terrell Friday was the first 
against Padre pitching in 98 innings this spring. The last homer was March 19 
in Tempe, Ariz. by the Mariners' Dave Valle off Eric Show. Coles' homer was 
followed in the bottom of the inning by an even more amazing feat, a homer by 
Terrell, who last hit one in the regular season May 23, 1983 against -- guess 
who -- the Padres. . . . Padre announcer Rick Monday has been a victim of the 
season's first steal -- somebody made off with his Toyota Forerunner Thursday 
night, taking it from his parking spot at a San Diego hotel.

CHARGERS SIGN RAIDERS' PARKER, RAMS' COLLINS 
</P>

<P>
The Chargers announced Friday the acquisition of two more unrestricted free 
agents, both from Southern California neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
The signings of former Raider tight end Andy Parker, a San Dieguito High 
graduate, and former Ram linebacker Jim Collins gave the Chargers seven under 
the National Football League's new free agent policy. The deadline for such 
signings is 9 o'clock tonight. 
</P>
<P>
While losing Parker, the Raiders signed 31-year-old Bob Golic, a three-time Pro 
Bowl nose tackle for the Cleveland Browns. The Rams also lost former Charger 
tight end Eric Sievers, to New England. 
</P>
<P>
Parker, 6-feet-5, 245 pounds, signed a two-year Charger contract that, with 
attainable incentives, reportedly will pay him $400,000 a year, a big increase 
over the $175,000 he made last season. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, under new Coach Dan Henning, are expected to go to a double 
tight-end alignment, and Parker is expected to start. 
</P>
<P>
A No. 5 pick from Utah in 1984, Parker played on special teams until Todd 
Christensen was hurt last season. Parker, 15 pounds heavier and a better 
blocker than Christensen, was expected to retain his starting job despite 
Christensen's years of pass-receiving prowess. 
</P>
<P>
Parker, 27, has just six catches in his NFL career, including four for 33 yards 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
He attended San Dieguito after two years at Dana Hills High in Dana Point. At 
San Dieguito, he was first-team All-Palomar League and the team's most valuable 
player in football and also participated in basketball, baseball and track. He 
was Utah's leading receiver as a senior with 33 catches for 395 yards in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Collins, 30, appeared in just four games for the Rams last season after 
spending the first 12 weeks on injured reserve with a knee injury. Once perhaps 
the team's top defensive player, Collins has been slowed in recent years by 
serious injuries. He missed all of 1986 with a neck injury and underwent 
arthroscopic surgery last summer to repair a chronically damaged right knee. 
</P>
<P>
Collins, 6-2, 233 pounds, has no cartilage in the knee, but played well after 
returning to the lineup late last season. His best season was 1985, when he led 
the Rams in tackles with 140 and was named to the Pro Bowl. He has started 67 
of 80 career games. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams claimed Sievers on waivers from the Chargers last December and had 
plans for him as a blocking tight end this season. Sievers appeared on special 
teams in the Rams' season-ending win over San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The Golic story is a big one in Cleveland, where he was born and became a local 
star and community leader. An All-America linebacker at Notre Dame, he was a 
No. 2 pick of the New England Patriots in 1979 but was waived in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
He was then picked up by the Browns, who converted him to nose tackle. 
Free-spirited and fun-loving, he gave new style to the position he picked up so 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Said Golic: "A nose tackle is like a fire hydrant." 
</P>
<P>
And: "I'm 6-3 on Saturday nights, but 6-0 on Sunday nights." 
</P>
<P>
Golic is best known as a run defender, which will come in handy for the 
Raiders, whose rushing defense fell apart last season. Since waiving Reggie 
Kinlaw, a hero of the '84 Super Bowl, they had tried the 6-5 Bill Pickel, a 
natural defensive tackle, at the nose, with progressively worse results. Last 
season, the Raiders largely abandoned their old base defense for a four-man 
line -- at the order of Al Davis who wanted more pressure. Meanwhile, other 
players petitioned the coaches to bring back the 3-4, since it was the only run 
defense they knew how to play. 
</P>
<P>
Said Golic: "With two great pass rushers, they need someone with a big butt in 
the middle to tie up the guard and the center and stop the run." 
</P>
<P>
The signing was precipitated by changes on the Raiders and the Browns. The new 
Raider defensive coordinator, Dave Adolph, comes from Cleveland. The new 
Browns' head coach, Bud Carson, the old Jets' defensive coordinator, plans to 
put in a four-man line. 
</P>
<P>
Golic signed a two-year contract, which will pay him $600,000 and $650,000. 
</P>
<P>
His welcome to the Raiders seems well on its way. While visiting the Raider 
facility, he stayed at the home of Howie Long.

Yes, everyone, baseball is the All-American sport. Retired players, active 
players and managers in baseball abide by ethical standards and are corruption 
free. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't that what we're told as Little Leaguers? I remember coaches saying, 
"Brad, Pete Rose hustles -- now go shag that ball -- on the double!" and "Brad, 
Steve Garvey doesn't use profanity, and neither will you," and "Brad, Wade 
Boggs keeps his eye on the ball. That's why he gets so many hits." 
</P>
<P>
Times have changed. What do coaches tell their players today? "Brad, if you 
ever want to make it to the big leagues, you'll need a mistress, a few 
girlfriends with whom you can have children out of wedlock, a bookie and maybe 
even a few good drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Is that what it takes to be one of the innocent boys of summer these days?

TENACIOUS DELAHOYA LEADS GRANT; 
</P>
<P>
SENIOR THROWS 152 PITCHES, HITS GRAND SLAM IN WIN OVER POLY 
</P>

<P>
If the East Valley League baseball game between Grant High and Poly on Friday 
was to be judged for beauty, it would probably receive straight zeroes. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the dismal hitting and pitching of both teams and Poly's shoddy 
fielding, Grant survived a seventh-inning rally and won, 10-9, at home to gain 
revenge for a 17-run loss to the Parrots earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an ugly win," Grant Coach Tom Lucero said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the missed ground balls and hit batters could not overshadow the drama 
of Javier Delahoya's game-winning grand-slam in the fifth. With two out, 
Delahoya ripped relief pitcher Mario Gomez's two-and-one pitch over the 
right-center-field fence to give the Lancers a 10-6 lead and cap a six-run 
inning after trailing, 6-4. The home run was Delahoya's fourth of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The game was far from over, though. The Parrots took advantage of two walks, an 
error and a hit batter to score three runs in the final inning. 
</P>
<P>
Delahoya (3-0), who had allowed only one earned run in 14 innings this season, 
walked nine and hit two batters while throwing 152 pitches in a complete-game 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
The senior right-hander was clearly tired by the seventh inning. With one out, 
Delahoya walked Robert Flores and Gomez was safe at first on an infield error. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Lozano was hit by a pitch to load the bases and Robert Azala walked, 
allowing Flores to score and pull the Parrots to within 10-7. With two out, 
Shad Martinez drove in Gomez and Lozano with a single. The two-hour, 45-minute 
game ended when Adulfo Hernandez struck out with the tying and go-ahead runs on 
base. 
</P>
<P>
Delahoya, who last pitched 10 days ago, couldn't remember the last time he had 
been so ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But his perseverance, plus a timely swing, swung the outcome in Grant's favor. 
</P>
<P>
"I got all of it," Delahoya said of the grand slam. "It felt good."

CAMARILLO ROLLS SEVEN IN SEVENTH TO ROCK THOUSAND OAKS, 7-6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yogi Berra's much-quoted aphorism, "It's not over till it's over," was proven 
correct again Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo High, shut out for six innings by Thousand Oaks ace left-hander John 
Bushart, scored seven times in the seventh inning for an improbable 7-6 win in 
a Marmonte League game at Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best comeback in my eight years here," Camarillo Coach Ken Wagner 
said after his team won its fifth consecutive game, improving to 9-5, 2-1 in 
league play. 
</P>
<P>
Even Wagner was surprised by the turn of events. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to just say something to get them up for next week," he said. "It 
shows we have a lot of heart and that's encouraging." 
</P>
<P>
Winning pitcher Matt Tackett drew a bases-loaded walk from reliever Todd Lang 
to force home Mike Muncy with the winning run. One batter earlier, Thousand 
Oaks pitcher Brian Higgins walked Wesley Nathaniel to send Bill Lynch home with 
the tying run. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers led, 6-1, with one out and the bases loaded when Bushart was 
replaced by Steve Wolfe. Chris Johnson greeted Wolfe with a grand slam. 
</P>
<P>
"Bushart was real tough on us," Wagner said. "He handled us. We didn't hit any 
more than two or three hard balls off him. I didn't think we'd get to him, but 
in the seventh, he looked like he was tired and had trouble finding the plate." 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks (4-4, 2-1) seemed headed for an easy win after Scott Barkman 
slugged a two-run home run in the first and Chris Grodell hit a three-run 
double in the third. The Lancers increased their lead to 6-0 in the sixth on 
Lance Martin's solo home run. 
</P>
<P>
In other Marmonte League games: 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley 9, Royal 1 -- Greg Santos' two-run home run and Terry Hill's 
run-scoring triple highlighted a nine-run first inning as the host Pioneers 
(14-1, 3-0) coasted to their 10th consecutive win. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Jenkins (3-0) pitched a six-hitter, striking out five. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake 9, Channel Islands 7 -- The Warriors nearly blew a 9-0 seventh-inning 
lead but hung on to post a win at home. 
</P>
<P>
John Brookman (2-3) pitched four innings in a starting role, then re-entered in 
the seventh to snuff the Raiders' rally. With none out and six runs across, 
Channel Islands' Manuel Padilla was thrown out while jogging into second base 
after hitting what he apparently thought was a ground-rule double. After 
surrendering a run-scoring single, Brookman struck out David Lucio and 
pinch-hitter Chris Schindler. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Foster hit his fourth and fifth home runs for Westlake (6-7, 1-2), a 
two-run shot to highlight the Warriors' three-run first inning and a solo shot 
to highlight a six-run fourth. 
</P>
<P>
GOLDEN LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
Saugus 5, Palmdale 4 -- J. B. Johnson's two-out, two-run home run in the 
seventh capped a dramatic three-run rally for host Saugus. Johnson's blow kept 
the Centurions (9-2-2, 3-0) in a first-place tie with cross-town rival Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Darrell Davis began the rally with a one-out walk. He stole second and advanced 
to third on an infield single by Matt Tull. George Lopata scored Davis with a 
sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who was two for three, then hammered a 0-1 pitch from Lonnie Potter 
over the left-field fence for his first home run. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, a senior center fielder, stole two bases to raise his season total to 14 
and set a school record with 44 career steals. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon 7, Burroughs (R) 5 -- Senior right-hander Sean Nichols struggled early 
but rebounded to post a six-hitter with three strikeouts as host Canyon (6-6, 
3-0) rallied twice to remain tied for first with Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols (3-1) was tagged for two runs on three hits in the first but a four-run 
Canyon fourth fueled the win. 
</P>
<P>
TRI-VALLEY LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark 6, Oak Park 0 -- Robert Hernandez (4-0) pitched a four-hit shutout 
with six strikeouts and also tripled and scored twice for the host Musketeers 
(7-1, 3-0). Teammate Scott Semer drove in two runs, and Tom Uphoff and Mike 
Zamrock each had two hits. 
</P>
<P>
The win was the Musketeers' sixth straight and gave them a one-game lead over 
Oak Park (5-4, 2-1.) 
</P>
<P>
FOOTHILL LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
Hart 16, Burbank 0 -- Hart catcher Casey Burrill hit his third home run of the 
season, a three-run shot in the second inning, to key a 16-hit attack for Hart 
(11-1, 2-0). 
</P>
<P>
Burrill was two for four with four RBIs, senior David Toledo was three for five 
with one RBI and one run scored. 
</P>
<P>
Hart's Ray Gardocki was three for five with three RBIs and Lance Migita drove 
in two runs on two hits. 
</P>
<P>
Burroughs 9, Alhambra 3 -- Tom Phillips blew open a one-run game with a 
three-run double in the third inning as the Indians (7-7, 1-2) evened their 
season record. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips was three for three with six RBIs and also had a two-run home run in 
the fifth inning. Chris Westbury (3-2) pitched a complete game for his third 
consecutive win. He had seven strikeouts and was two for four with two doubles. 
</P>
<P>
NONLEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park 14, Nordhoff 2 -- Geoff Black hit two home runs and Eric Greene 
added another as the Panthers (11-1-3) rolled to a nonleague win at Nordhoff. 
Black was four for four with six RBIs, and Greene was three for four with four 
RBIs.

FOOTBALL FLING IN FINLAND; 
</P>
<P>
LONGTIME SEMIPRO PLAYER RECRUITING TEAM TO PLAY IN ARCTIC BOWL 
</P>

Attention semi-retired football players who haven't lost their lust for the 
game: Dig out the shoulder pads, shine up the cleats and kick the cat out of 
the helmet. Bob Faeber wants you. 
</P>
<P>
Faeber, 35, owner of Action Buick in North Hollywood and a longtime semipro 
football player, needs a team to play in the Arctic Bowl on May 21. And in 
answer to your immediate question, no, it isn't called the Arctic Bowl because 
it's sponsored by an antifreeze company. The game will take place in Oulu, 
Finland, just a few hundred miles below the North Pole. 
</P>
<P>
Faeber needs 30 Valley-area men who can afford to take a week off from work and 
pay $1,235 each for round-trip air fare. In addition to playing in the Arctic 
Bowl, a player will live with a Finnish family, eat free tuna pizzas and 
reindeer steaks, see the sights and get to play in a second game, this one near 
Helsinki in a city called Turku. Faeber promises to interrupt the good times 
with only 10 hours of practice. 
</P>
<P>
"This trip is obviously for a guy who loves playing football and likes the idea 
of actually taking part in a bowl game," says Faeber, who has named himself 
coach and general manager. The team will be called the California All-Stars. 
</P>
<P>
But just because he is using the word all-star and playing in a bowl game it 
does not mean that Faeber is looking for players who were college starters in 
another life. The opponent in the Arctic Bowl, Northern Lights, plays in the 
Finnish-American Football Assn., which compares to "low Division III," college 
football in the United States, Faeber says. 
</P>
<P>
Faeber's evaluation of Finnish football is supported by Vic Wallace, head 
football at St. Paul College in Minnesota. In 1984, when he coached at William 
Jewell College in Liberty, Mo., Wallace took the varsity to Finland for a game 
against an association team. 
</P>
<P>
"We beat them pretty easily," says Wallace, whose quarterback at William 
Jewell, Kelly Groom, is now coach of the Northern Lights. 
</P>
<P>
Faeber says that a passport and equipment are the only player requirements. And 
maybe the ability to remember to get on the bus. The team doesn't have to be 
better than the one Faeber played on a year ago, one that was shut out by its 
Mexican hosts in the Friendship Bowl in Mexicali. 
</P>
<P>
"The sponsors are asking that I don't bring ringers," says Faeber, who has 
played semipro football for 19 years in the High Desert Football League.

DRESSAGE RIDER YIELDS CENTER STAGE TO MEN LIKE DIMITRIUS, A SMUG, SELF-ABSORBED 
PERFORMER -- AND EVERY BIT A STEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
You've heard of a male chauvinist pig? Dimitrius is a male chauvinist horse. He 
stands in his stall with a smug look of superiority as four women dote over 
him. They braid his mane. They rub baby oil around his nostrils. They smear 
black polish on his hoofs and white talc on his legs. They wipe the gook from 
his big brown eyes and brush his coat with a velvet cloth. He is king of the 
stable and they are his handmaidens. 
</P>
<P>
"You want some sugar, sweetie?" says one of them, Betsy Allen, nuzzling him and 
talking baby talk. "I want you to look soooooo good." 
</P>
<P>
Dimitrius not only enjoys this royal treatment, he expects it. "He's arrogant," 
says his groom, Kathryn Zahlis, "and he gets even more arrogant right before a 
performance." 
</P>
<P>
Talk about karma. Some horses slog through a career behind a plow or on the 
kiddie birthday-party circuit. Tweezed, painted, polished, buffed and adored, 
Dimitrius spends his life in the fast lane -- the best hay, the cleanest stalls 
-- surrounded by fawning women who love him. 
</P>
<P>
What Dimitrius gives them in return is a star performance in dressage, an 
Olympic event in which the horse does intricate maneuvers for a rider who can 
only provide nonverbal commands. Most horses are born with brains that can't 
comprehend anything more complex than "giddyup" and "whoa." Dimitrius 
understands thousands of commands and performs them well enough to compete in 
Grand Prix dressage, the sport's major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
There is a good chance that Dimitrius will be taking a round-trip plane ride to 
Europe this spring to represent the U. S. Equestrian Team. He won't even have 
to eat airline food -- his owner-rider, Marie Meyers of Newbury Park, will 
bring his own special supply. 
</P>
<P>
It is Meyers who has been responsible for pampering Dimitrius -- and turning 
them both into a world-class dressage team: They were the first alternate on 
the U.S. Olympic Equestrian Team last year. 
</P>
<P>
But when Meyers bought the Dutch-born horse 12 years ago, Dimitrius was an 
excitable 3 year old, too unpredictable and undisciplined to make it big in 
dressage, and she was a 20-year-old rookie. 
</P>
<P>
"He was crazy then," Meyers says. "Women will shoot me, but he was too strong 
for me. He would have been better off with a man." 
</P>
<P>
This isn't a pleasant chapter in Dimitrius' otherwise storybook life. Meyers 
had him gelded. But the operation changed his attitude. Obedience is at the 
core of dressage -- a horse's compliance with his rider's orders determines the 
score. Over years of patient training, Dimitrius and other blue-chip horses 
develop a rapport with their riders, who claim the relationship borders on the 
supernatural. 
</P>
<P>
"There's almost telepathy between Marie and Dimitrius," Zahlis says. "He can 
sense what she wants and she knows what he needs." 
</P>
<P>
The bond is so close, Zahlis says, that "Dimitrius thinks Marie is his mother. 
He just tolerates the rest of us." 
</P>
<P>
The rest includes the 16 or so female students who help Meyers train horses. 
Meyers runs a sort of "Dressage U." The students work for free at her barn in 
the Bell Canyon Equestrian Center, mucking stalls for the chance to pick up 
something more important -- knowledge. "Marie is really generous with that," 
Zahlis says. 
</P>
<P>
When Meyers competes, Zahlis and another assistant are part of her team and get 
paid. Like Grand Prix auto racing, dressage has always been an expensive sport, 
dominated by wealthy Europeans, and getting more expensive all the time. Meyers 
bought Dimitrius for $4,000. Today, breeders get as much as $300,000 for a 
horse that already has been schooled. Travel, also costly, is a necessity to 
get exposure for the horse among judges and breeders. 
</P>
<P>
At the Western World Cup Dressage Competition recently, Meyers rented 11 stalls 
at the L. A. Equestrian Center, four of them for her horses and the rest for 
equipment: saddles, blankets, tack, storage trunks, and a cooler-size vacuum 
called Electro-Groom. When it came time for Dimitrius to compete (called 
"performing a test"), he was groomed like a French poodle and put on his game 
face. 
</P>
<P>
"You seem to be in a very good humor today," Meyers whispered in his ear after 
getting in the saddle. 
</P>
<P>
But you never know with horses. "Horses have lots of bad days, just like 
humans," Meyers says, "but the problem is, they can't let you know if they're 
feeling crappy from the horse in the stable behind them kicking the barn door 
all night." And Dimitrius can go into a funk. "He knows when he makes a mistake 
and he gets upset," Zahlis says. "It's like he let us down." 
</P>
<P>
With Meyers dressed in traditional black tails and derby, Dimitrius pranced 
into the Large Oval -- a dirt ring 20 meters by 60 meters -- and performed for 
the five judges. He looked relaxed and athletic -- as if he, and not Meyers, 
had memorized the 24 precise maneuvers. Misty-eyed, Allen leaned on the fence 
and watched him actually skip across the ring, turning in the best showing of 
the competition. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter what he does, I cry," Allen says. 
</P>
<P>
After riding, Meyers jumped off Dimitrius and got a hug from a fellow rider. 
"Fabulous trot," the other rider said. "You had it going." 
</P>
<P>
Dimitrius was standing right there, with his usual smug look.

BURT MOVES BIRMINGHAM CLOSER TO TITLE RERUN 
</P>

<P>
The Birmingham boys' track and field team failed to win a varsity league title 
for 20 years, but after knocking off previously unbeaten Monroe, 72-54, in a 
Mid-Valley League meet Friday, the Braves are on the verge of their second 
consecutive league crown. 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham defeated Kennedy, 64-63, in a Mid-Valley League finale last year to 
win its first title since 1968, and it could be on its way to another crown 
after defeating the host Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham (5-0) -- which will face Van Nuys next week and Reseda the week 
after -- may have cleared its toughest dual-meet hurdle with the win over 
Monroe (4-1). 
</P>
<P>
Reseda (4-1), the 1987 and '88 West Valley League dual-meet champion, was 
expected to challenge Birmingham for the league title, but sprinter-hurdler 
Aaron Whitehurst transferred to Dorsey two weeks ago in the wake of 
disciplinary actions and the Regents' title chances may have gone with him. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured it would be a close meet," Birmingham Coach Scott King said of 
Friday's meet. "I had it doped out, 66-61, with us winning the mile relay." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the Braves didn't have to win the mile relay -- the meet's 
final event. They had clinched the victory minutes before when junior Brian 
Gastelum won the two mile in 10 minutes, 15 seconds, to give Birmingham a 67-54 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Gastelum also won the 880-yard run (2:04.3) as Birmingham won six of 10 track 
events and nine of 15 overall. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Rodney Burt led the Birmingham charge, winning the 100 meters in a 
wind-aided 11.0 seconds, the 220 yards in a wind-aided 22.5 and the 440 in 
51.1. He also anchored the mile relay team to victory in 3:35.1. 
</P>
<P>
"We were hoping it would come down to the mile relay," said Burt, who placed 
fifth in the 400 in last year's City Section championships. "But when we went 
one-two in the 220, we basically put the meet away." 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 40-36, after nine events, the Braves took the lead for good when Burt 
won the 220 and teammate Mark Vigil unexpectedly gunned down Monroe's Chris 
Harvey in the final 50 yards for second. That gave Birmingham eight points in 
the event -- to Monroe's one -- and a 44-41 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe was led by Mario Armijo and Derril White. Armijo won the 120-yard high 
hurdles in a wind-aided 15.3 and the 330-yard intermediate hurdles in 41.1, 
while White took the long jump at 20 feet, 8 inches. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' meet, Birmingham (5-0) defeated Monroe, 66-43, as freshman 
Heather Ballard won four events. 
</P>
<P>
Ballard took the 880 in 2:33.0, the 330 low hurdles in 55.2, the high jump at 
4-10 and the shotput at 30-11 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe (3-2) was led by Kynna Wright, who won the 100 in a wind-aided 12.9, the 
440 in 1:03.5 and anchored the victorious 440 relay (51.7). JOHN ORTEGA

SPORTS ET CETERA: BYU-SDSU FOOTBALL GAME IS MOVED TO NOV. 25 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The move of the season-ending Brigham Young game from Dec. 2 to Nov. 25 is the 
most significant change in the tentative 1989 San Diego State football schedule 
released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs are scheduled to play their first game under new Coach Al Luginbill 
at Air Force Sept. 2. Two weeks later, on Sept. 16, they are to play UCLA in a 
7 p.m. game at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Other home games would be Cal State Fullerton (Sept. 23), Long Beach State 
(Oct. 14), Pacific (Oct. 21), New Mexico (Nov. 4), Wyoming (Nov. 11) and BYU. 
</P>
<P>
Road games would include Utah (Sept. 30), Hawaii (Oct. 7), Texas El Paso (Oct. 
28) and Miami, Fla. (Nov. 18). 
</P>
<P>
The schedule is subject to change for television. 
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Surf defeated the Burbank Jets, 11-4, in the first game of the 
Pacific Southwest Hockey League playoffs before 700 at the San Diego Ice Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Playing on the same line, Jerry Azato (two goals, three assists), Jack Grone 
(two goals, three assists) and Jim Malwitz (one goal, four assists) combined 
for five goals and 15 points to lead the Surf (21-0-1). 
</P>
<P>
San Diego led, 2-0, after the first period and increased that to 8-0 after 40 
minutes. Surf goaltender Rob Watson had 21 saves. Burbank's two goalies had 34. 
</P>
<P>
Game 2 of the best-of-three series is tonight at 8. Game 3 (if necessary) is 
Sunday at 4:30 p.m. Both games are at the San Diego Ice Arena. 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE SIGNINGS 
</P>
<P>
Kim Lester, from Madison High and the San Diego Volleyball Club, has signed a 
national letter of intent to play volleyball at San Diego State. The 5-foot-11 
outside hitter was offered a full scholarship to SDSU despite having only 
played club volleyball for one season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tribute to her athletic ability," said Dick Templeman, SDVC's director. 
"It's highly unlikely for someone to get a scholarship with only one year of 
club." 
</P>
<P>
Lester also plays basketball and softball for Madison. She is an All-American 
and three-time co-player of the year in the City Eastern League in softball. 
</P>
<P>
Lester is the 11th member of SDVC to receive a scholarship this year. 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine defeated University of San Diego, 8-5, in a West Coast Athletic 
Conference game at Cunningham Stadium. Rick Hirtensteiner and Matt Howard hit 
home runs for Pepperdine, which broke a 5-5 tie in the eighth when Scott Craven 
grounded into a force at second to drive home Scott Shockey. 
</P>
<P>
Hirtensteiner (2-0) picked up the victory. Dave Monastero (2-1) was the loser. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the pitching of Darryll Rupnow, Wisconsin Whitewater's two-run second 
inning was enough to defeat UC San Diego, 2-1, in a nonconference game at 
LaVerne. 
</P>
<P>
Rupnow (2-1) allowed nine hits, struck out nine and walked one. The Tritons' 
Mike Morgan (eight strikeouts, one walk) took the loss and is 3-5. 
</P>
<P>
In the NCAA Division III college baseball poll UCSD (14-10) is ranked ninth, 
Wisconsin Whitewater (7-5) 10th. UCSD's Dave Ligerman and Chris Murphy were 
both two for four. 
</P>
<P>
MEN'S TENNIS 
</P>
<P>
The University of San Diego defeated No. 25 Southern Methodist, 5-2, in the 
Blue/Gray National Collegiate Tennis tournament in Montgomery, Ala. In key 
matches for No. 21 USD (19-4), Dave Stewart defeated Brian Devening, 7-6, 6-3, 
and J.R. Edwards and Curtis Dadian defeated Alex Nizet and Steve Beauchamp, 
4-6, 6-3, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
UC San Diego, ranked fifth in the NCAA Division III, was defeated by No. 2 UC 
Santa Cruz, 6-3, in a nonconference match in Phoenix. The Tritons' Sig Huber 
defeated Steve Gottlieb, 7-6, 6-4, in No. 2 singles, and Chris Belloli downed 
Kirk Edwards, 0-6, 6-4, 6-2, in No. 4 singles. Francois Monnar and Jeff French 
defeated Edwards and Gottlieb, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, in doubles. UCSD is 7-9. 
</P>
<P>
SOFTBALL 
</P>
<P>
Cal Poly Pomona's Lori Thompson (11-2) pitched a no-hitter to defeat San Diego 
State, 1-0, in the first game of a Big West Conference doubleheader at SDSU. 
The Broncos' Nicky Luce (11-5) had a two-hitter in the nightcap as No. 7 Pomona 
(23-8, 11-1) won, 3-0. SDSU fell to 13-21-1, 7-11. 
</P>
<P>
BOWLING 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's Jess Stayrook, seeking his first PBA Tour victory, was third after 
seven rounds of the Professional Bowlers Assn. Seagram's Coolers Open Friday in 
Edmond, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
Stayrook, who led for four of the first six rounds, will bowl the winner of the 
opening match in today's stepladder finals. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Pencak led all qualifiers and is guaranteed a berth in the championship 
game and a shot at the $100,000 first prize. Mike Aulby earned the No. 2 berth. 
</P>
<P>
MEN'S VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
<P>
Top-ranked Stanford (15-3) defeated San Diego State, 15-9, 10-15, 15-13, 15-8, 
in a Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. match at Peterson Gym. Eric 
Etebari had 22 kills and Mike Schlegel 15 for SDSU (12-13, 4-11).

AFTER BIG RACES AT SEOUL, SOVIETS SAY THEY WON'T BE SHARP FOR CARLSBAD 5,000

<P>
Seems that Steve Scott, whose name has been synonymous with the Carlsbad 5,000 
road race over the past three years, is having to share the attention this time 
around. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, the three-time champion, could find himself nudged out of the glow of 
the spotlight by any one of a number of stars in the men's field -- or by three 
Soviet women. 
</P>
<P>
One, Olga Bondarenko, won a gold medal at the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games, setting 
a world track 10,000-meter record of 31:05.21. Another, Yelena Zhupiyeva, took 
the bronze medal in 31:19.82. The third, Natalya Artyomova, holds the Soviet 
track record in the 5,000 meters at 14:54.08. 
</P>
<P>
Impressive accomplishments. But those Olympic feats are actually reasons why 
the Soviets might not be in top form right now. They're still recuperating from 
the physical and mental exertion they put into training for the Games, which 
were held less than six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Now they're just coasting, or at least that's what they indicated Thursday at 
the Carlsbad City Council Chambers, where they were bestowed with BAD 5000 
T-shirts, sweat shirts and "coffee" mugs. 
</P>
<P>
Cultural differences being what they are, the Soviets quickly corrected 
Carlsbad Mayor Pro-Tem Ann Kulchin after she presented the visitors with the 
mugs, telling her that they would probably be used for vodka. 
</P>
<P>
Kulchin protested, offering a compromise that the mugs be used for tea. But the 
Soviets just said nyet. 
</P>
<P>
Which, as it turned out, was the answer of the day, especially when the runners 
were asked if they were in top shape. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want to upset anyone," Bondarenko said through interpreter 
Aleksander Mineyko, "but please do not expect the most out of me because after 
Seoul, with the physical and mental effort put into it, I've been recuperating. 
. . . But I'm delighted to be invited here. I'd just like to do my best." 
</P>
<P>
Added Zhupiyeva, "I'm not in solid form. I'm in good shape, but not solid." 
</P>
<P>
Let's face it. Compared to the Olympics, the Carlsbad 5,000 is just another 
road race. 
</P>
<P>
"You must understand that this is not the Olympic finals," said Pavel 
Litovczenko, the Soviet coach. "But still you're more likely to see their 
(Soviet runners') backsides than their front sides. They will do their best, 
and if winning comes, then God bless." 
</P>
<P>
Artyomova was more optimistic. "I'm going to go for a good time," she said 
after Zhupiyeva indicated that she would not push her time. "And if the times 
are good, then perhaps the gods will allow for a good place as well." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps. Then again, maybe former San Diego State runner Lynn Williams, the 
bronze medalist in the 1,500 meters at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and the 
fifth-place finisher in Seoul at 3,000, will be inspired by the Russians' 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
Williams is expected to be the biggest challenge to the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
And for these runners, anyone would seem to present a "big" challenge. 
Bondarenko stands only 5-feet-1 and weighs 90 pounds. Zhupiyeva is 5-2, 101, 
and Artyomova 5-6, 108. 
</P>
<P>
The Invitational for men and women will begin at 9:15. A crowd of 25,000 is 
expected to line the streets of Carlsbad to view the race. The starting line 
will be the corner of Grand and Jefferson Avenue, the finish at State Street 
and Elm Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Scott is once again favored to win the men's division -- he ran a world road 
best of 13:31 here in 1986 and broke that with a 13:30.2 last year -- but he 
will be pushed hard on the home course he designed. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Nenow, a late entry, brings with him a world road 10,000 best of 27:22, 
set in 1985. Kenya's Julius Kariuki, the gold-medalist at Seoul in the 
steeplechase, has guaranteed race promoter Tim Murphy that he need not "worry 
about Steve Scott winning for the fourth time in a row." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's Terry Cotton, who finished ninth last year, is entered, as are 
Americans Doug Padilla and Ed Eyestone. Padilla is the U.S. record-holder 
indoors in the 5,000 meters, and Eyestone was Track and Field News' 1988 Road 
Racer of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
Two British runners -- David Moorcroft and Geoff Wightman -- also could 
contend. In 1985, Moorcroft became the first man to finish 5,000 meters on a 
track in less than 13:00. Wightman is a miler moving up to the 5K.

CREW IS BIG TRADITION AT BERKELEY, AND WE'RE NOT TALKING THE COLLEGE

<P>
Make no mistake about the reason Andrew Mains decided to try crew. 
</P>
<P>
"Berkeley has a really unsuccessful football team and a pretty bad basketball 
team," Mains said Friday at the San Diego Crew Classic. "The crew is sponsored 
mainly by the parents and rowers, and it's a winning team. That's how I got 
interested in it. I came out and loved it immediately, and I got in great 
shape." 
</P>
<P>
Mains is not rowing for the University of California at Berkeley in the Crew 
Classic, which began Friday and continues today at Mission Bay and features 
more than 80 clubs, colleges and universities. He's rowing for Berkeley High 
School. As in the Berkeley High School varsity crew, one of the only high 
school crews in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"The San Diego Crew Classic is definitely the highlight of the season for us," 
said Mains, a senior and second-year rower. "It's something we always look 
forward to. There are only two regattas for us (sanctioned) by the U.S. Rowing 
Assn." 
</P>
<P>
There are about 10 junior (high school-age) entries in the Crew Classic, but 
Berkeley, is the only varsity high school crew; it has fielded one for 10 
years. The rest are clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, Berkeley finished second (6:38.82 for 2,000 meters) in a preliminary 
heat of the men's junior eight and will row in today's final at 10:35 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
About 4,000 students are enrolled at Berkeley, and the boys' and girls' crews 
each have about 30 rowers on their rosters. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the poor records of other sports teams, the top athletes go out for 
crew," Mains said. "It's pretty prestigious. Also, it's such a rare opportunity 
to have crew in a public high school that people are interested in it. We 
easily get as much attention as the varsity football team." 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Crew Classic is the first regatta of the year for Berkeley, which 
schedules about six dual meets and three or four regattas a year. 
</P>
<P>
Twins John and Bill Cooper are one reason the Berkeley crew is a winner. The 
Coopers have been good enough to row on the U.S. Junior National team for the 
past two years. Both Coopers started rowing their freshmen year in high school. 
</P>
<P>
To see development such as that of the Coopers is why Steve Markey, 28, enjoys 
coaching. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really rewarding for me," Markey said. "It's great to take someone who 
doesn't know anything about a sport and take them to the level to where they 
can compete against others." 
</P>
<P>
But Markey said his favorite aspect of high school crew is that it helps 
students get into college. 
</P>
<P>
"We had three guys last year who didn't get into Cal at first, but the Cal crew 
coaches helped, and now they're rowing for Cal. This year, we've already had 
four rowers accepted to Harvard." 
</P>
<P>
Berkeley starts practice Oct. 1. The crew is on the water every day before 
school from 6:30 until about 8:10, and on Saturdays from 8:30 until 10:30. 
During racing season, Berkeley practices on some Sundays. The crew also runs 
and lifts weights every day after school. 
</P>
<P>
"We work out about five hours a day, roughly," Mains said. "I wake up about 
5:30 a.m. and don't get home until about 6 or 6:30." 
</P>
<P>
Which is another reason the San Diego Crew Classic is a highlight for the 
Berkeley High School team. It gives them a break from the daily routine, and... 
</P>
<P>
"The girls walking around in bikinis," Mains said. "It's exciting coming down 
to San Diego. Plus, Saturday night there's always a big party after the races." 
</P>
<P>
Normally, with early morning practices, the Berkeley crew is unable to attend 
many parties. 
</P>
<P>
"This will probably be the first time ever we will stay up until 2 a.m. to turn 
our clocks back," senior Ben Glass said. 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
The oldest walking monument at the Crew Classic, once again, was 90-year-old 
Del Beekley. He has attended every Crew Classic and is a San Diego area rowing 
legend. He still works as a rigger a couple of days a week at the San Diego 
Rowing Club, and his name is getting around. The SDRC has a boat named for him, 
the H. Del Beekley, and the Mission Bay Aquatic Center named its rowing center 
after him. "The Crew Classic is getting better and better each year," Beekley 
said. "More crews are coming from back east, and more people are attending it." 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
T-shirt of the day: A white shirt with black lettering reading "Row Naked -- 
Any Time, Any Place, Any Seat." It was selling at concession stands. . . . 
Author George Plimpton is the grand marshal of this year's Crew Classic, and he 
teamed with San Diego State alumni rower George Oliver to defeat Channel 8's 
Jim Laslavic and Oxford University rower Terry Dillon in a celebrity race to 
kick off the Classic Friday morning. Plimpton's boat won by about 10 lengths. . 
. . Notre Dame is in the Classic for the first time. . . . The men's Cal Cup 
final was moved to 9 a.m. Saturday because of the late addition of the 
Cal-Visitor Challenge, which will be raced at 2:30 p.m. The Cal-Visitor 
Challenge will pit the top crews from California against those from other 
areas. . . . The women's Cal Cup is at 2:15 p.m., the Whittier Cup (women's 
varsity eight championship) is at 3 p.m. and the Copley Cup (men's varsity 
eight championship) is at 3:15. Racing begins this morning at 6:30, and 
admission is $2. A crowd of about 30,000 is expected.

WESTWOOD RENAISSANCE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hooray for Armand Hammer's museum to be built in Westwood! ("A Museum Grows in 
Westwood," by Suzanne Muchnic, March 13). As one who lives, works, walks and 
patronizes the few services remaining in this once charming village, I am 
appalled by the trashing of Westwood by every fast-food operation, sleazy 
teeny-bopper clothing store and cut-rate electronic shop to come down the pike. 
</P>
<P>
A museum may not restore the charm of Westwood, but it beats another yogurt 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
Now that we're finally on the right track, perhaps some foresighted 
entrepreneurs will see the wisdom of opening restaurants, galleries and shops 
that will attract the people who used to come to Westwood and have been shut 
out by the proliferation of teen-oriented establishments.

THE RAP ON RAP MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's both curious and unfortunate that Robert Hilburn ("Ice Cube Keeps Cool . . 
. Chills Clash," March 25) continues his almost childlike adoration of rap 
bands that write nursery rhymes (which frequently don't rhyme at all) 
glorifying behavior that results in the drive-by shootings of inner-city 
children. And yet he scorns metal bands (yes, even Guns N' Roses when they were 
new) for their focus on partying and sex. 
</P>
<P>
As Ice Cube said in the review, he'd be writing about different things if he 
had grown up in Beverly Hills. So why does Mr. Hilburn go out of his way to 
condemn and disdain the reality of teen-age suburban America while he naively 
celebrates the forbidden (to him) world of gang warfare and dope dealing?

FACES . . .: EAST MEETS EAST

<TEXT>
<P>
Sitarist Ravi Shankar, 68, has spent a lifetime collaborating with musicians 
from around the world, combining various traditions of music. Perhaps it is no 
surprise then, that he resists the claim that he has broken new ground in 
glasnost with his latest recording, "Inside the Kremlin." 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing gimmicky about it," Shankar claims. "They have my records in 
the Soviet Union and I have been going there since 1953. They know my music 
very well." 
</P>
<P>
Shankar was invited by the Soviet government to participate in a yearlong 
festival in Moscow to celebrate Indian culture. A live recording of Shankar's 
contribution which was performed in Red Square last July, "Inside the Kremlin" 
melds various Russian traditions with Shankar's Indian traditions combining the 
Moscow Chamber Orchestra, the Russian Folk Ensemble, the Government Chorus of 
the Ministry of Culture and an ensemble of Indian musicians and vocalists -- 
about 140 musicians altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned about Russian music listening to records of Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky 
and Rachmaninoff, and I also know the folk music through my studies on the 
balalaika," Shankar said. "The musicians had no trouble assimilating the seven 
original compositions of this project. We rehearsed about five or six days 
before the performance." 
</P>
<P>
Described as "Swar-Milan" or "meeting of musical notes," Shankar's efforts to 
combine musical traditions are not without precedence. In the past he has 
collaborated with violinist Yehudi Menuhin, koto master Susumu Miyashita and 
ex-Beatle George Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
In October, he will collaborate with the Birmingham Touring Opera of England 
with an opera, "Vision Through the Haze." Shankar plans the opera as a 
statement against drug abuse. GREGG WAGER

'CRASH TV,' NEW GAME-SHOW GENRE, SET TO GO 'BANG' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE HAITHMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like the creators of today's "trash TV" programs, the producers of a new crop 
of high-action game shows prefer to call their product "reality television." 
</P>
<P>
But, like it or not, the press has already dubbed them "crash TV" -- and the 
new "crash" genre debuts with a bang Sunday at 5 p.m. on KTLA Channel 5 with 
"The Interceptor," the first of three unconventional, high-impact entries into 
the game-show arena that are expected to appear next season. 
</P>
<P>
"The Interceptor," produced by Four Point Productions and distributed by Fries 
Entertainment, will premiere as a one-hour special on about 100 TV stations 
nationwide. The producers hope that if the pilot proves popular, stations will 
want to order "Interceptor" as a weekly series. 
</P>
<P>
Two other crash games, "RollerGames" from Qintex Entertainment and "The 
Gladiators" from Samuel Goldwyn Entertainment, are expected to premiere by next 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of buying a vowel, picking a category, choosing Bachelor No. 2 or 
dressing up like a tomato to select Door No. 3, "crash TV" takes its players 
outside the safety of a studio set. In "RollerGames," skilled contestants on 
roller skates will do battle on a huge figure-eight track featuring a 14-foot 
"wall of death" and a live alligator pit. "The Gladiators" will throw ordinary 
weaklings into the fray with metal-clad warriors in costume. 
</P>
<P>
"The Interceptor," hosted by Erik Estrada, is probably the tamest of the trio. 
This game pairs contestants with celebrity guests, each carrying a large 
backpack containing information about possible prize winnings. Their quest: to 
find the keys to the backpacks while following a harrowing five-mile course, 
pursued by the Interceptor. 
</P>
<P>
In the pilot, the Interceptor is a stunt man dressed in black, with a Darth 
Vader-esque mask and voice, who amuses himself by hunting down the players via 
motorcycle, helicopter and on foot. 
</P>
<P>
His personality, voice and costume may change in subsequent games, said 
producer Ron Ziskin: "One week, he could be RoboCop -- the next, GI Joe, or the 
Lone Ranger." 
</P>
<P>
Contestants must make it to the end of the course without being "killed" by the 
Interceptor's gun. Once a contestant gets hit, the key will no longer unlock 
the backpack; the player goes home with a consolation prize. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ziskin calls "Interceptor" reality television, the half-hour game is 
edited down from about two hours of film, shot by eight different camera crews, 
plus a camera placed in the Interceptor's helmet. The producers also added a 
throbbing music sound track to enhance the suspense, just as in a television 
drama. Ziskin argues that the editing does not affect the reality or fairness 
of the competition: "It's still the same game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ziskin believes "Interceptor" and the other crash TV games represent a response 
to the audience's restlessness with traditional TV formats. 
</P>
<P>
"What's more, the programmers themselves are kind of bored with today's 
programming. They're looking for new ways to create interesting television," he 
said. "It's an important program in that it is a new form, the first of this 
reality group to hit the air, fully executed. It'll be very interesting to see 
how it performs."

'BABAR' DEBUT ON HBO HOLDS A TRUNKFUL OF CHARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Babar," a new animated series that debuts on HBO Sunday at 8 a.m., captures 
the look and much of the charm of Jean and Laurent de Brunhoff's popular 
children's books. 
</P>
<P>
Babar, the king of the elephants, never allows his duties to interfere with the 
needs of his children. Most of each program is devoted to a story about his 
childhood that shows his offspring how to deal with a problem. 
</P>
<P>
In the second episode (airing April 9), Babar finds his son, Cornelius, trying 
to impress a new friend. In the ensuing account of a party he almost ruined by 
affecting a false charm, Babar (along with writer J.D. Smith) makes his point 
without becoming smarmy or pompous. 
</P>
<P>
The designs for the characters and the simple animation capture the essence of 
Jean de Brunhoff's understated watercolor illustrations. The artists 
occasionally seem to loose their sense of the characters' size and weight: The 
young Babar jumps and climbs in ways that seem very unelephantlike (but very 
few elephants wear uniforms and crowns, as the adult Babar does). 
</P>
<P>
As the voice of Babar, Gordon Pinsent ("The Thomas Crown Affair") gives the 
elephant king a reassuring presence and keeps the mildly didactic stories from 
bogging down in moralizing. Child actors provide the voices for the young Babar 
and his friends, which makes the show sound a lot like a "Peanuts" special at 
times. 
</P>
<P>
Created by the Canadian Nelvana studio -- the producers of the entertaining "My 
Pet Monster" -- "Babar" manages to be endearing without sliding into the 
saccharine cutesiness of "Hello Kitty." Parents with children in the 
4-to-10-year-old range should plan on setting their VCRs: The kids will 
probably want to watch "Babar" more than once. CHARLES SOLOMON

FOR YAROSLAVSKY, CITY COUNCIL IS ENOUGH, FOR NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zev Yaroslavsky sat inside a Studio City coffee shop not long ago, sipping a 
diet soft drink and reflecting on a decision he had made two months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"I would love to be mayor someday," the Los Angeles city councilman confessed 
to a reporter. "I'm just not sure I'm willing to do what I have to do to get 
there." 
</P>
<P>
It was a startling admission from a hard-driving politician who has spent much 
of his career preparing himself to be mayor. After deciding that 1985 was not 
the year to challenge Tom Bradley, Yaroslavsky worked methodically toward this 
year's race, amassing more than $1.5 million for his campaign and cultivating a 
broader constituency before pulling out January, only a week before the filing 
period ended. 
</P>
<P>
A poll by his advisers had indicated that it would be very tough to beat 
Bradley. And, faced with a choice between taking on the mayor and running for 
reelection, Yaroslavsky retreated to the safety of own council seat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nothing Seems Certain 
</P>
<P>
These days nothing seems quite as certain as it once did for Yaroslavsky, the 
one-time boy wonder of city politics. 
</P>
<P>
Friends say the man who could have been a contender is greatly relieved to be 
out of what would have been a grueling race. One adviser even called him a 
"happy cowboy" now, saying Yaroslavsky had secretly dreaded the fight. 
</P>
<P>
But others are saying Yaroslavsky sealed his political fate in backing away. 
They say he'll never be mayor now. 
</P>
<P>
After openly lusting after the mayor's post for so long, Yaroslavsky now seems 
incapable of extricating himself from its web. 
</P>
<P>
At 40, he has already been written off as a has-been by some political insiders 
who say his decision was cowardly. And rarely does he make it through an hour 
of campaigning for reelection to his sprawling 5th District council seat 
without someone saying, "Hey, Zev, you shoulda run for mayor." 
</P>
<P>
Some of his advisers even insist that he could have won the race. But 
Yaroslavsky is unwavering in his view that his mayoral candidacy was doomed. He 
speaks reverently of Bradley, as if the 71-year-old mayor possessed some 
mystical power over the electorate that the councilman has yet to attain. 
</P>
<P>
"Bradley's personal popularity transcends his positions on the issues," 
Yaroslavsky said. "I could have made a good race out of it. But that's not what 
I wanted out of this exercise. Being mayor is what I wanted out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Now Yaroslavsky says he just wants to return to the council. He denies that he 
is bored there, as he once implied, and ticks off a list of goals: increasing 
the size of the police force, reforming the city's planning process to ensure 
that communities are better protected from commercial development, and 
improving public transportation . 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky is also determinedly campaigning for reelection against three 
lesser-known challengers, even though he is expected to easily retain control 
over the district that includes Westwood, Century City, West Los Angeles, 
Bel-Air, the Beverly-Fairfax area and parts of the southern San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Comments About Weight 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, he endures comments about his recent weight gain, which started 
after he injured himself while running, meekly asks people if they mind posting 
his lawn signs and listens to his opponents complain that he allowed the 
district to go to pot while he was out prepping for the mayor's race. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky seems to accept his fate as if it is something beyond his control. 
After a period of searching reevaluation, he claims to be happy. He is spending 
more time with his family, and is trying to get back into shape by taking long 
early morning walks through his Beverly-Fairfax neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
People close to Yaroslavsky say he also is freer to be himself now -- a product 
of the ethnic Jewish side of West Los Angeles who often trades greetings in 
Hebrew and who still seems most comfortable within the confines of that 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the time leading up to his withdrawal from the race, when friends 
likened him to a walking powder keg, Yaroslavsky now seems at ease with himself 
and with the decision he made. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing about Zev is that he's never enjoyed the fight of a campaign," said 
one consultant, who asked not to be named. "So he's mostly relieved. He's also 
back among the people he knows, and that makes him happy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Usual Pattern 
</P>
<P>
Rick Taylor, another political consultant who is close to Yaroslavsky, said the 
council reelection campaign has been good for his spirits. "When you leave a 
race, you usually go into a very deep depression," Taylor said. "You 
second-guess yourself and you kind of get into a funk. But because of his 
reelection campaign, Zev has never been able to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Those who have followed Yaroslavsky's 14-year sojourn from frumpy Jewish 
activist to buttoned-down City Hall insider, however, say his political status 
will never be quite the same. 
</P>
<P>
A Times poll taken after Yaroslavsky's withdrawal showed that he lags behind 
other young politicians such as City Atty. James K. Hahn and City Councilman 
Michael Woo in favorable ratings from voters. 
</P>
<P>
However prudent it may have been, Yaroslavsky's last-minute decision not to run 
is likely to cost him in any future bid for the job, advisers and political 
strategists agree. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to have a hard time lining up (support) in advance next time," said 
one adviser, who asked not to be named. "It essentially has to be a sure 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky, who spent the first two months of this year returning his mayoral 
contributions, as required by law, said he hasn't given any thought to how 
future campaign efforts might be affected. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wife Thinks of Future 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Yaroslavsky claims that he rarely thinks about his political future 
these days. But his wife, Barbara, who is one of his closest political 
advisers, apparently does. She says her husband is usually happiest when he is 
challenged. But she has no idea where he will find the challenges, whether in 
his council duties or in another political office. 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows whether Zev will run for mayor in four years? " she said. "It 
wouldn't surprise me if Bradley ran again." 
</P>
<P>
She simply shrugged when asked about speculation that her husband might 
consider a run for Congress or county supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Afriat, a former Yaroslavsky aide who now works as a political 
consultant, said the councilman rarely reveals himself, even to close friends. 
Yet Afriat contends that Yaroslavsky may really have no idea what his future 
holds. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure if Zev's master plan is to run for mayor again," Afriat said. "He 
needs time to take a look at his options. . . . Zev has dealt with these 
questions in his usual way, very privately. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Willingness to Risk 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky's political future may well hinge on his willingness to take risks, 
several political consultants said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike some career politicians, he is not financially independent. He and his 
wife live in a modest, two-bedroom house in which his young son and daughter 
share a bedroom. Si Frumkin, a close friend, said Yaroslavsky had a real fear 
of losing his $58,000-a-year salary if he did not become mayor. 
</P>
<P>
People who are close to the councilman also say that he dreads the idea of 
returning to the private sector. After devoting most of his life to politics, 
they say, he is ill-equipped to handle many other jobs if he lost a race. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky rejects those views, saying that he would gladly accept the 
challenge of another campaign if the odds were more favorable. But he will not 
second-guess himself. 
</P>
<P>
Just recently, he stood almost unnoticed at the back of a crowded room and 
watched silently as a man who did take up the challenge, Councilman Nate 
Holden, lambasted the mayor and stumped for votes before Sherman Oaks community 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
There was no talk of what might have been.

INYO COUNTY, L.A. UNVEIL NEW PACT TO END WATER WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN RODERICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BISHOP, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Inyo County and Los Angeles took a big step toward peace in their long-running 
water war Friday, unveiling a new agreement to protect Owens Valley plant life 
and also allow Los Angeles to pump more ground water in some years. 
</P>
<P>
If finally approved, the plan could also soothe feelings about the decades-old 
presence of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power in the high desert 
valley, east of the Sierra Nevada range about 230 miles north of the city line. 
</P>
<P>
But elected officials and two courts must first endorse the agreement, which 
was reached by DWP and Inyo negotiators in closed sessions. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement would settle -- out of court -- two lawsuits between Inyo County 
and Los Angeles. The first, filed by Inyo in 1972, blamed Los Angeles wells for 
lowering the water table -- resulting in the death of many trees and the spread 
of pesky salt cedar. In 1980, Los Angeles sued to challenge Inyo County's 
authority to limit pumping and levy a special, higher property tax rate on the 
DWP, which owns most Owens Valley acreage. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles would continue to obtain a significant share of its water supply 
from wells tapped into aquifers below Owens Valley. The ground water 
supplements the major source of Los Angeles water -- snowmelt runoff into the 
Owens River and the Mono Lake basin farther north. 
</P>
<P>
But the agreement would establish an entirely new method for deciding how much 
ground water Los Angeles could take for its aqueducts, which stretch across the 
Mojave Desert and through the San Gabriel Mountains to Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
This year Los Angeles is allowed to pump 170,000 acre-feet of ground water, 
about 55.4 billion gallons, enough to satisfy 15% to 20% of the city's water 
demand. A state Court of Appeal had set the limit at 108,000 acre-feet, but in 
1985 Inyo County allowed the limit to rise as part of a temporary legal 
settlement with Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement proposed Friday would regulate the amount pumped from each well 
based on the threat of damage to nearby vegetation. Pumping limits would be 
revised during the year after testing of soil and water table conditions, which 
change with the snow runoff from the nearby Sierra and with the seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Well pumps found to be threatening plant life with damage would be slowed or 
shut down until conditions improve, the two sides agreed. This year -- the 
third straight year of reduced runoff from the Sierra -- eight of 17 huge DWP 
wells would be turned off under the agreement, said Greg James, head of the 
Inyo County Water Department. 
</P>
<P>
But the DWP would also be allowed to drill new wells around the valley. Those 
wells could be used to make up any lost flow from wells that are shut down. 
</P>
<P>
"I think in the long run there will be more pumping in the valley," said James, 
who is also the Inyo County counsel and headed the Inyo negotiating team. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the settlement, Los Angeles would pay $1 million a year to the Inyo 
County treasury for use as decided by the Board of Supervisors. County 
Administrator C. Brent Wallace said the payment is partial compensation for the 
taxes Inyo loses because Los Angeles, the biggest land holder in Owens Valley, 
is allowed by the state Constitution to pay property taxes at a lower rate than 
other owners. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP pays about $4 million a year in taxes (more than half of the county's 
$7-million General Fund) but Wallace said the county's share would double if 
47,000 acres of Los Angeles land were not exempt from all taxes and if the DWP 
paid the same tax rate as local residents. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles would also pay $2 million over 10 years for new recreation areas 
and $100,000 a year to maintain Inyo County parks. Los Angeles would also pay 
$750,000 a year to fund the Inyo County Water Department and another $750,000 
for a project to control salt cedar growth. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP also agreed to release more water into the lower Owens River to enhance 
fishing and wildlife along a 50-mile stretch of river that became dry years ago 
when Los Angeles diverted the water. The DWP would spend $7.5 million on the 
project, which includes a pump to take water back into the aqueduct at the end 
of the river stretch so it would not flow onto the dry Owens Lake. 
</P>
<P>
Owens Valley residents who resent paying their water bills to the DWP would no 
longer have that annoyance. The DWP would turn over the water systems in Lone 
Pine, Independence and Laws to local authorities within five years. The Lone 
Pine Reservoir would also be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP would also place up for public sale 26 acres it owns in Bishop and 75 
acres elsewhere in the valley. The sale is part of a desire by local officials 
to put more land back in private hands to allow at least some growth. 
</P>
<P>
Inyo County Supervisor H. B. (Lefty) Irwin said the agreement has strong 
backing on the Board of Supervisors, who will vote on the agreement May 9, but 
he said there were many times in recent weeks when talks almost collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
"I for one wanted to walk out many times," Irwin said. "Many times we thought 
it was all over." 
</P>
<P>
Several public hearings will be held in April to hear comments from Inyo County 
residents, who have been told little of the talks. Irwin said the secrecy was 
justified, given the tense relationship between Owens Valley and the DWP. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to negotiate with the public watching us," Irwin said. 
</P>
<P>
Approval will be more complicated in Los Angeles. The Board of Water and Power 
Commissioners must ratify the pact, then send it to the Los Angeles City 
Council for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased there is flexibility in the agreement," said Duane 
Buchholz, assistant DWP engineer for the Los Angeles Aqueduct.

BEACH BOY BRIAN WILSON'S PSYCHOLOGIST LOSES LICENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eugene Landy, the flamboyant psychotherapist who guided singer Brian Wilson's 
comeback but was criticized for allegedly exerting too much control over his 
patient, has lost his license to practice psychology in California for at least 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
Landy, who faced accusations ranging from sexual misconduct with a female 
patient to gross negligence, admitted to a single charge of unlawful 
prescribing of drugs, according to a 15-page legal agreement obtained by The 
Times on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, a member of the Beach Boys, and Landy are vacationing in Hawaii and not 
available for comment, a publicist for Wilson said. Landy's attorney was in 
court Friday and could not be reached, his office said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Landy has denied the charges, which were brought against him last 
year by the watchdog California Board of Medical Quality Assurance. 
</P>
<P>
Landy, complying with an agreement made with the state, surrendered his license 
on Monday, Suzanne Taylor, the BMQA's management services technician, said in a 
telephone interview from Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
In a highly unusual move, the BMQA asked Landy to agree not to apply for 
reinstatement of his license for two years. Normally, any psychologist who 
loses his or her license is allowed to reapply in one year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Added Insurance' 
</P>
<P>
Thomas O'Connor, executive officer of the BMQA's Psychology Examining 
Committee, indicated that the two-year penalty is "added insurance." 
</P>
<P>
"The patient abuses (outlined in the complaint against Landy) were heinous," 
O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
Landy, 54, who holds a Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Oklahoma, 
pioneered a technique called "24-hour therapy," where the goal is for the 
therapist and his assistants to exert control over every aspect of the 
patient's life. 
</P>
<P>
Landy has been credited by some people, including the former Beach Boy, with 
helping Wilson, the creative force behind the band, recover from years of drug 
abuse and self-neglect to record a highly acclaimed solo album, "Brian Wilson," 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exploitation Alleged 
</P>
<P>
But critics, including some of Wilson's relatives and former associates, claim 
that Landy isolated and exploited Wilson, dominating his professional life in a 
manner befitting Svengali. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint against Landy filed by the BMQA contained seven charges. Landy 
admitted to only one, which accused him of prescribing drugs in violation of 
business and professional codes. Psychologists are not allowed to prescribe 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
According to the complaint, Landy's longtime colleague, psychiatrist Solon D. 
Samuels, who faces no charges, wrote prescriptions for the medicines. Landy 
controlled their administration to Wilson, a practice that amounted to 
prescribing, O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint identifies the patient only as "B.W.," but it is known to be 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
History of Drug Abuse 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses for Landy who were cited in the agreement said his administering of 
the drugs was necessary because of the patient's history of drug abuse and to 
prevent him from engaging in destructive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Another of the charges against Landy accuses him of allowing a "dual 
relationship" to form with Wilson, also in violation of permitted psychological 
practices. The dual relationship occurred when Landy became Wilson's business 
manager, executive producer and co-songwriter, the complaint alleges. 
</P>
<P>
Landy was also accused of sexual misconduct and unlawful prescribing to an 
unidentified female patient, as well as use of cocaine with her. Landy did not 
admit to these charges nor to the dual relationship charge. Negligence was 
alleged with both patients. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Public Is Being Protected' 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor said he was not disappointed that Landy admitted to only one charge. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal in any case is to ultimately obtain the license," he said. "The 
public is being protected from him." 
</P>
<P>
Landy became known for treating celebrity clients and the drug-abusing children 
of wealthy Westsiders in the '70s, about the time he founded a Beverly Hills 
clinic, the Foundation for the Rechanneling of Emotions and Education (FREE). 
</P>
<P>
He first became associated with Wilson in 1975. Wilson's wife, Marilyn, sought 
Landy's help in rehabilitating the singer-composer, whose life had become 
bogged down in drugs and emotional problems. The Beach Boys' manager fired 
Landy late in 1976, but he re-emerged at Wilson's side in 1983.

 OSCARS' SNOW WHITE DISPUTE CONTINUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Attorneys for the producers of the Academy Awards and the Walt Disney Co. met 
Friday but failed to settle a copyright infringement suit over Snow White's 
appearance in the opening number of the Los Angeles Oscar presentation. 
</P>
<P>
Erwin Okun, a Disney spokesman, said that, although future meetings between the 
lawyers would be held, the company was proceeding with its legal options as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
Disney has sued the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in federal 
court, contending that the academy did not have permission to use the Snow 
White character in a performance that constituted an "unauthorized and 
unflattering reference" to Disney's original.

 BILL AIMS AT ASSAULTS AGAINST TEACHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Attacks against two San Fernando Valley teachers this month prompted a bill 
introduced Friday in Sacramento that would increase penalties for assaults on 
classroom teachers and would require districts such as Los Angeles to spend 
more money on school security. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, named the Teacher Protection Act of 1989 by its author Sen. Alan 
Robbins (D-Van Nuys), would also require that teachers be warned about students 
in their classes who have criminal records. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was introduced because of "a wave of teacher-related violence" in the 
Los Angeles Unified School District, Robbins said at a press conference Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, a Sylmar Junior High School English teacher was stabbed 
during class by one of her students and a popular Grant High School teacher was 
shot and killed in front of his Sherman Oaks home by an unknown assassin.

MOTIVATED AUBURN WOMEN BEAT LOUISIANA TECH, 76-71 
</P>

<P>
Auburn Coach Joe Ciampi, for whom the word stern seems an apt description, 
smiled briefly after his team had erased a year of bitter memories and beat 
defending national champion Louisiana Tech Friday night in the semifinals of 
the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. women's basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Ciampi was smiling not just because his second-ranked Tigers had outlasted the 
No. 3 Lady Techsters, 76-71, before 9,030 in the Tacoma Dome. There was another 
reason. The teams met in last year's championship game, but with a different 
result. Auburn blew a 14-point halftime lead and Louisiana Tech won, 56-54. 
</P>
<P>
So devastated was the Auburn team that the players told Ciampi that they wanted 
to prepare for this season without delay. They took two weeks off after last 
April's loss and began training. The team started the season by winning 28 in a 
row before losing to Tennessee. The Tigers are 32-1. 
</P>
<P>
So, imagine their glee when Louisiana Tech arrived as their semifinal opponent. 
Ciampi asked reporters all week not to write the revenge angle. "Call it 
motivation, not revenge," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Leon Barmore of Louisiana Tech would have none of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe can tell you no revenge all he wants," Barmore said Wednesday. "But I 
haven't see Joe Ciampi smile in 10 years. He would like nothing more than to 
kick my butt and I would like nothing more than to kick his." 
</P>
<P>
Having set the ground rules, the teams, similar in style, launched into a 
physical game. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn led by as many as seven points in the first half, but was not able to 
shake Louisiana Tech. The Lady Techsters had a handful of mini-runs in the 
half, the most successful of which came at 9:31. Tech scored eight unanswered 
points, mostly from the inside. The last basket in the run came on Shelia 
Ethridge's first three-point attempt and gave Tech its first lead, 28-27, with 
6:47 left. 
</P>
<P>
The game see-sawed from that point until Ethridge made her second three-pointer 
and gave Tech the lead for the second time, 37-36, with 2:06 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn led at the half, 40-39. 
</P>
<P>
Ciampi said his team made defensive adjustments to attempt to neutralize Tech's 
Venus Lacy. The 6-foot-4 center had 16 points at the half and was very nearly 
unstoppable. 
</P>
<P>
"Louisiana Tech did such a good job early of running the ball, of taking the 
ball to the basket, that we had to go back and regroup and start taking away 
their inside," Ciampi said. 
</P>
<P>
While Lacy was having her way inside, Tech forward Nora Lewis was having 
trouble. Lewis averaged 18.5 points during the season, but had only four points 
by halftime. She also committed two fouls. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first half, it was my fault," Lewis said. "I didn't go to the high post 
as much as I should have. As far as foul trouble, that was probably my fault. I 
made some stupid fouls." 
</P>
<P>
Auburn reversed roles in the second half, coming out aggressively on defense 
and pounding the ball inside to Vickie Orr and Linda Godby. In addition, the 
Tigers were able to take advantage of the loss of Tech's starting guard, Pam 
Wells, who reinjured her left knee after only eight minutes in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
It took about 10 minutes for the new Tiger game plan to settle in. In the 
meantime, the Lady Techsters surged to an eight-point lead. Ethridge began the 
run by making two free throws with the game tied at 49-49. Tech built a 57-49 
lead before Ciampi called a timeout. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn took control from that point on. The Tigers' extended defense and 
improved defensive rebounding frustrated Tech. Ciampi also switched to what he 
called a "very, very patient offense." 
</P>
<P>
"The key in those last 10 minutes was the defense we played," he said. "The way 
we sagged back into the middle and took them out of their offensive boards. 
That was the key, to make adjustments." 
</P>
<P>
Tech reacted by forcing shots on offense and committing fouls on defense. Lewis 
got her fourth foul with 9:37 left and fouled out with 2:07 left. 
</P>
<P>
"I would never use fouls as an excuse," Barmore said. "(But) it's obvious that 
if Nora Lewis didn't pick up her fourth foul with eight or nine minutes to go, 
we could have stayed ahead and won the game." 
</P>
<P>
Lacy led all scorers with 30 points and had 13 rebounds. Orr, who played only 
25 minutes, led the Tigers with 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
In speaking with reporters after the game, Barmore was philosophical and gently 
praised his players, in sharp contrast to Ciampi who has a Bob Knight-like 
approach to personal relations. 
</P>
<P>
"We said that going into this year it would be very hard for us to defend out 
national title," Barmore said. 'We had a sign in the dressing room that said, 
'Champions die hard, if they die at all.' I think we can all agree that 
Louisiana Tech died hard." 
</P>
<P>
Tech (32-4) did die, done in partly by its mastery of Auburn a year ago. But 
Barmore refused to be downcast. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not hurting," he said. "I'd be hurting if these kids had left something 
out there on the court. They did not. I have no feelings of sadness, I am 
disappointed and I am tired. But I am proud, too."

MUSTER SUFFERS LEG INJURY IN ACCIDENT AFTER WINNING 
</P>

<P>
Austrian tennis player Thomas Muster suffered a leg injury in a car accident 
less than two hours after winning a semifinal match Friday night in the 
International Players Championships, Miami city police said early Saturday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Muster was getting something out of the trunk of a car when it was struck 
head-on by another car, tournament security official Bob Brandes told the 
Associated Press. The second car, which was driving on the wrong side of the 
street, pushed the parked car into Muster's leg, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Muster was taken to Mercy Hospital to be treated for scratches and bruises 
below the knee but was not in a lot of pain, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A nurse at the hospital told The Times early Saturday morning that Muster was 
in stable condition and was released. Further details on his condition and 
chances of playing in Sunday's final were not available. Tournament officials 
have called a news conference today. 
</P>
<P>
Two people with Muster also were hurt and taken to the hospital, Brandes said. 
They were Wolfgang Ritschke, an Austrian photographer, and Michelle Boyd, a 
tournament volunteer who was driving the car. The extent of their injuries was 
unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Their car was parked near the Bayside shopping area downtown when the accident 
happened. The driver of the other car tried to flee the scene but was arrested 
by Miami police, authorities said. The driver was not identified. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier on a muggy Friday night, Muster pulled off a five-set semifinal 
shocker, 5-7, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-2. He is scheduled to play Ivan Lendl in the 
tournament final. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, who breezed past Kevin Curren, 6-2, 6-2, 6-3, in the first semifinal, 
beat Muster in the semifinals of the Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
Muster took advantage of an obviously tiring Noah and won in deceptively easy 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not very tired," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he looked very beaten after Noah swept the first two sets. But Muster 
is the type of player who can be given no second opportunities and, in the 
third set, the momentum switched. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to myself 'Come on, there's nothing to lose anymore, he's tired, play 
tennis and forget about everything,' " Muster said. 
</P>
<P>
Noah had two break points to go up, 2-0, and didn't, then lost his serve after 
twice having advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the beginning of the end," Noah said. 
</P>
<P>
Muster said he thought before the match that if he beat Noah, it would be 
because he was more fit. Muster practiced until 9 p.m. Thursday night. Noah did 
not practice for any of his matches. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem was he was making me run," said Noah, who tried to rely on his 
service to avoid strength-sapping rallies, but enjoyed only mixed results. 
</P>
<P>
Noah served 13 aces, but he also had 11 double faults and his first serve 
percentage grew progressively worse. He began the fifth set with a double 
fault, fell to 0-40 and saved one break point before Muster hit a winning 
volley on the second. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd was still cheering for Noah despite the score. 
</P>
<P>
"That made me feel good inside, but it didn't help me run," Noah said. 
</P>
<P>
After scoring a straight-set victory over baseline player Aaron Krickstein in 
the quarterfinals, Lendl was believed to be heading for some problems playing 
the big serve of Curren. He didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to play when you're healthy, relaxed and confident," Lendl said. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, who has still not lost a set in the tournament, played almost flawlessly 
and even hit some harder serves than Curren. Rader guns measured Lendl's 
average serve at 100 miles per hour and Curren's at 107. 
</P>
<P>
"I never really got in the match," Curren said. "He got on top of me and stayed 
on top of me. The idea was to get it close and then you see the tentative Ivan 
Lendl. I never saw him today." 
</P>
<P>
Set point in the first set was typical of the match. Curren sent a lob into the 
corner of the court, but Lendl ran it down and scorched a backhand crosscourt 
winner past a bewildered Curren standing at the net. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl said he thought Curren was totally demoralized early in the second set. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he had the spirit and the belief that he could come back," Lendl 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Curren held a brief, 2-0 lead in the second. He broke Lendl after being down, 
40-15, then proceeded to lose the next six games and the set. It got no better 
for Curren in the third set, losing his serve at 15 to go down, 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
Ten minutes short of two hours, it was over, and Lendl surveyed the rout, but 
not until Curren challenged a fan in the stands to play. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the third set, the male fan shouted to Curren: "You play like I do." 
</P>
<P>
Curren walked over to the stands, reached into his pocket and suggested they 
play for $25. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, who will be playing for $110,100 in the final, allowed Curren only 16 
points in 13 service games. Lendl also had four aces to Curren's one and sent 
Curren's first serves back hard and low. 
</P>
<P>
Curren made only 51% of his first serves. So Lendl sat on Curren's second 
serves and returned them with wicked slice backhands. 
</P>
<P>
"He was all over them," Curren said. 
</P>
<P>
The world's No. 1 player even went to the net 17 times and won 14 points. He 
cooly hit winners down the line from either side and, once again, was never 
pressured. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever he wanted to hit, he hit," Curren said. "The guy's a better 
all-around player today than he has ever been. He's beatable, but he's really 
on his game. 
</P>
<P>
"When you play the world's best guy, you've got to hope you're at your peak and 
he's a little bit off. I didn't get either one." 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Lendl said that at his level, he expects to see every ball go in. "It's 
not being cocky or anything, but it's almost like you are surprised when your 
shots don't go in. That's when your confidence level goes up." And is Lendl 
confident? "We've seen him loose and happy and confident," Kevin Curren said. . 
. . If Chris Evert defeats Gabriela Sabatini in the women's final today, not 
only would it be her 158th singles title but it would also allow Evert to 
reclaim her No. 3 ranking. Sabatini has been No. 3 for a month. Evert leads the 
series, 6-2, but lost twice in their three matches last year. Evert's lone 
victory over Sabatini was in the final of the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles, 
the infamous "match paint" final when someone in the stands threw light bulbs 
filled with paint onto the court just before Evert was to serve match point.

STAKES HIGH IN COLLEGES, AND COACHES FEEL PRESSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL GLAUBER, Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once, before 45-second clocks, three-point baskets and Dick Vitale, college 
basketball coaches were full-time faculty members who were paid to teach and 
asked to win games. 
</P>
<P>
But in today's dollar-crazed, television-driven world of college athletics, 
coaches are the ringmasters of a jump-shot, slam-dunk circus -- and the 
ringmasters are under siege and talking about organizing a union. 
</P>
<P>
"The monster is eating the masters," Xavier Coach Pete Gillen said. "Everyone 
wants to get to the Final Four, and everyone wants to get rich quick." 
</P>
<P>
The pressure to win never has been greater, and the stakes never have been 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
A first-round bid to this year's National Collegiate Athletic Association 
Tournament was worth $250,000 to each school, and the teams in the Final Four 
in Seattle each are guaranteed $1.23 million. 
</P>
<P>
It's no wonder then that coaches are being sacrificed in the rush for wins and 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no loyalty," Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim said. "You win, or you get 
fired." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the elite coaches can cry all the way to the bank. For them, the perks 
are financially rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
"The rich get richer," said Paul Westhead, the Loyola-Marymount coach. "They 
get the house, the $150,000 TV contract, the $150,000 shoe contract and the 
$150,000 coaching contract. But the vast majority of coaches are getting 
$40,000 to coach and maybe a $4,000 shoe deal. And that's comparing apples to 
apples. The poor middle guys are just voices out there who get forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
This spring, the terrain is littered with coaching casualties. Some coaches 
claim this is the worst turnover they have seen. 
</P>
<P>
"You expect some attrition," Westhead said. "If you lose a bunch of games, 
something will happen. But when you see the fate of a Don Donoher, that is 
categorically unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
Donoher, who won more than 400 games in 25 years at Dayton, was fired after 
three straight losing years. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee's Don DeVoe coaxed the Volunteers into the NCAA Tournament, but he 
resigned one step ahead of being fired. 
</P>
<P>
After his first losing season in 11 years, Bob Donewald was fired at Illinois 
State. 
</P>
<P>
In all, more than two dozen of the 294 Division I coaches are expected to be 
out of work. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a sick thing," Indiana Coach Bob Knight said. "I think these people 
are sick with this whole basketball thing. The way that coaches have been 
handled has been absolutely ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the wounds have been self-inflicted. Bill Frieder, Michigan's coach for 
seven years, was forced to resign before the NCAA Tournament after accepting a 
contract to coach next season at Arizona State. Frieder's loss was Steve 
Fisher's gain. The interim coach has guided Michigan to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
Many coaches sympathize with Frieder's predicament. They say winning, not 
loyalty, is the sport's most valued commodity. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen a tremendous change and increase of pressure," said Tom Penders, who 
has coached at Fordham, Rhode Island and Texas in the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
"At Fordham, we won in the NIT five straight years. I thought it was a heck of 
an accomplishment with a school with a $22,000 budget, roach-infested dorms and 
holes in the roof at the gym. Our president could not understand why we 
couldn't get in the NCAAs. I told him, 'If we could get the same kind of 
commitment as Georgetown, I'll get you in the NCAAs.' " 
</P>
<P>
The pressure to win has taken its toll in other ways. Maryland's Bob Wade, 
suffering from dehydration, collapsed and was hospitalized after his team 
defeated North Carolina State in the first round of the Atlantic Coast 
Conference tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"You get caught up in the areas of coaching and recruiting and you forget about 
yourself," Wade said. "I had to take two steps back and evaluate things. The 
program is important, but so is your health. This is a seven-day-a-week, 
24-hour-a-day job. Basically, you're suffering from stress and worry. You're 
trying to please so many people -- the team, the alumni, the administration." 
</P>
<P>
Coaching also has been altered radically in the last decade by television, 
which transformed college basketball from a cult sport to a growth industry. 
</P>
<P>
The 1968 UCLA-Houston showdown at the Astrodome signaled the beginning of a new 
era, a three-way marriage of big money, huge arenas and television. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until 11 years later, though, that the Final Four became a national 
phenomenon. The 1979 championship game between Indiana State and Michigan State 
marked the first on-court meeting of Larry Bird and Magic Johnson and drew the 
highest TV ratings in tournament history. 
</P>
<P>
"What is evolving is the game is getting stronger," Westhead said. "Division I 
college basketball has become a big business; it is a money-making venture for 
all parties. The alumni reap benefits. The schools reap benefits. The coaches 
are players in this business. For better or worse, we don't take the Ivy League 
approach." 
</P>
<P>
Coaches are now the sideline showmen of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"They're becoming actors," said John Wooden, who guided UCLA to 10 NCAA titles 
in 12 seasons before retiring in 1975. "Coaches and players are becoming more 
individualistic." 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is the color guys on TV are ex-coaches, and they focus on the coach," 
Boeheim said. "And there are so many more games on TV. Before, no one focused 
on you. We were on national TV 22 times, and you become bigger than the game 
because you're there forever while the players come and go every four years. 
I'm doing the same job I did 10 years ago, for a lot more money." 
</P>
<P>
Television provides the colleges with millions of dollars -- CBS paid $166 
million over three years to televise the NCAA Tournament and four other college 
championship events -- but creates a revenue monster that requires constant 
feeding with victories. Defeat means a financial setback. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of those broadcasters who stand on hills and mountain tops, who 
perpetuate myths of how great a coach a guy is, they don't really know," said 
Temple Coach John Chaney. "Is he a great coach because he has great talent? In 
my situation, I know we're just not that good without talent. Your life rests 
in the hands of a youngster who is 18 years old, looking at your program and 
deciding that five or six telecasters said how great your school is. He makes 
his choice based on the wrong information. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone wants to be seen on TV. Everyone wants to go to a school that is 
highly visible. Everyone wants to go to a school that will have a chance to 
reach the Final Four. Those are the things that tempt youngsters." 
</P>
<P>
And what tempts college administrators? Meeting budgets, maintaining a refined 
image and winning. The NCAA literally has hundreds of rules regarding 
recruiting and scheduling but few covering the issue of hiring and firing 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe that money is the primary consideration at all institutions," 
said Dr. Martin A. Massengale, the Nebraska chancellor who heads the NCAA's 
Presidents' Commission. "If the coach is doing the things we ask him to do -- 
build a good program on a solid foundation, abide by all the rules and train 
young people -- that's important." 
</P>
<P>
What the coaches want is security. 
</P>
<P>
But security comes with a price. Coaches can be hired and fired, but they are 
free to make a fortune -- $200,000 and up for the elite, which is more than 
five times the salary of tenured professors. 
</P>
<P>
Some coaches have talked openly of forming a union. More than 2,000 college and 
high school coaches will gather at the National Association of Basketball 
Coaches convention in Seattle, but don't expect them to leave wearing union 
labels. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in a union, and my father was in a union," Princeton's Pete Carril said. 
"We're coaches. We're not steelworkers."

MORNING BRIEFING: COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE A SUPER RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A National Football League owner searching for the coach to take his team to a 
Super Bowl victory might do well to check the California community college 
ranks. 
</P>
<P>
Five coaches with California community college backgrounds have coached in the 
Super Bowl, and the only Super Bowls any of them lost were to other coaches who 
also came out of what is widely considered the best community college system in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bill Walsh, who played at College of San Mateo and coached at Monterey 
Peninsula College, coached the San Francisco 49ers to three Super Bowl 
victories before retiring after the 49ers beat the Cincinnati Bengals for their 
latest title in January. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tom Flores, who played quarterback at Fresno City College, coached the 
Raiders to Super Bowl victories in 1981 and 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Joe Gibbs, who coached at Cerritos College, has coached the Washington 
Redskins to two victories in three Super Bowl appearances, losing only to 
Flores and the Raiders in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 -- John Madden, an offensive lineman for College of San Mateo and later coach 
at Hancock College, coached the Raiders to their first Super Bowl victory 
against the Minnesota Vikings in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dick Vermeil, who played at Napa College and later coached at Napa and San 
Mateo, coached the Philadelphia Eagles in their only Super Bowl appearance, 
losing to the Raiders and Flores in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Community affairs: College of San Mateo leads the nation in producing Super 
Bowl coaches with three -- Walsh, Madden and Vermeil. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia: When California won the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. basketball 
title in 1959, who did the Golden Bears beat in the Final Four? 
</P>
<P>
Home away from home: Michigan will have the home-court advantage for today's 
NCAA semifinal game against Illinois at the Kingdome in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
The floor, 6,720 square feet of hardwood maple, was made in Dollar Bay, Mich., 
by Horner Floor Co. 
</P>
<P>
Joked Bill Gappy, the company's director of portable sales: "We painted the 
lane blue, because Michigan's going to win." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Coach Pete Newell's Bears beat Oscar Robertson and Cincinnati in 
the semifinals, 64-58, and held off Jerry West and West Virginia in the 
championship game, 71-70.

RAIDERS GAIN ON DEFENSE, LOSE ON OFFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Raiders found one of the missing pieces in the puzzle of their defense . . 
. but lost one from their offense Friday, as the signing period for 
unrestricted free agents moved into its final hours. 
</P>
<P>
From the Cleveland Browns, they signed Bob Golic, the 31-year-old, three-time 
Pro Bowl nose tackle they've been looking for since the departure of Reggie 
Kinlaw in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
To the San Diego Chargers, they lost tight end Andy Parker, the starter last 
season after Todd Christensen was hurt. The little-known Parker is a better 
blocker and was expected to retain the starting job this season even with 
Christensen back. 
</P>
<P>
Golic's agent, Ralph Cindrich, confirmed that his client had been "signed, 
sealed and delivered," and after a day of inquiries, the Raiders announced it, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
The team made no mention of Parker, but he signed a Charger contract Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Golic story is a big one in Cleveland, where he was born and became a local 
star and community leader. An All-American linebacker at Notre Dame, he was a 
No. 2 pick of the New England Patriots in 1979 but was waived in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
He was then picked up by the Browns, who converted him to nose tackle. 
Free-spirited and fun-loving, he gave new style to the position he picked up so 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Said Golic: "A nose tackle is like a fire hydrant." 
</P>
<P>
And: "I'm 6-3 on Saturday nights, but 6-0 on Sunday nights." 
</P>
<P>
Golic is best known as a run defender, which will come in handy for the 
Raiders, whose rushing defense fell apart last season. 
</P>
<P>
Since waiving Kinlaw, a star of the '84 Super Bowl, they had tried the 6-5 Bill 
Pickel, a natural defensive tackle, at the nose, with progressively worse 
results. Last season, the Raiders largely abandoned their old base defense for 
a four-man line -- at the order of Al Davis, who wanted more pressure. 
Meanwhile, other players petitioned the coaches to bring back the 3-4, since it 
was the only run defense they knew how to play. 
</P>
<P>
Said Golic: "With two great pass rushers, they need someone with a big butt in 
the middle to tie up the guard and the center and stop the run." 
</P>
<P>
The signing was precipitated by changes on the Raiders and the Browns. The new 
Raider defensive coordinator, Dave Adolph, comes from Cleveland. The new Brown 
head coach, Bud Carson, the former New York Jets' defensive coordinator, plans 
to put in a four-man line. 
</P>
<P>
Golic signed a two-year contract, which will pay him $600,000 and $650,000, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
His welcome to the Raiders seems well on its way. While visiting the Raider 
facility, he stayed at the home of Howie Long. 
</P>
<P>
Parker signed a two-year contract which, with makeable incentives, reportedly 
will pay him $400,000 a year, a big increase over the $175,000 he made last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, under new Coach Dan Henning, the former Washington Redskins 
assistant, are expected to go to a double tight-end alignment, and Parker is 
expected to start. 
</P>
<P>
A No. 5 pick from Utah in 1984, the 6-foot-5, 245-pounder played on special 
teams until Christensen was hurt last season. Coach Mike Shanahan's preference 
for the better blocker led him to Parker, rather than the smaller, faster Trey 
Junkin, a better pass receiver. Christensen's listed weight is only 230, and, 
despite his years of pass receiving prowess, Shanahan was thought to be leaning 
toward keeping Parker No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The signing period ends today. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders have added Golic; linebackers Otis Wilson from the Chicago Bears, 
Jackie Shipp from the Miami Dolphins and Emanuel King from the Cincinnati 
Bengals; offensive lineman Dale Hellestrae of the Buffalo Bills, and 
placekicker Jeff Jaeger of the Browns. They were talking with Chicago 
cornerback Mike Richardson, who is in the Bears' doghouse, but haven't made a 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders have lost Parker; linebacker Reggie McKenzie to the Phoenix 
Cardinals; kick returner Chris Woods to the Browns; running backs Chris 
McLemore to the Seattle Seahawks and Reggie Ware to the Denver Broncos. Only 
Parker and McKenzie were on the active roster throughout last season, and only 
Parker figured prominently in Raider plans.

PADRES' ROB NELSON SHOWS PERSEVERANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How unfortunate that the gross misconceptions about dyslexia held by San Diego 
Padres farm director Tom Romanesko have contributed to Rob Nelson's inability 
to be given a fair shot at the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Dyslexia is a disorder characterized by the brain's difficulty in processing 
the written information it receives. It does not affect an individual's ability 
to hit a baseball, nor a particular pitch. 
</P>
<P>
I believe Rob Nelson's dedication and perseverance would make him a valued 
member of any major league team, many of whose members, past and present, lack 
the strength of character that this gifted man possesses.

RIDER WRONGLY BLAMES BICYCLE FEDERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As I read Shav Glick's (March 25) article on Barbara Buchan and was cheered by 
the story of one woman's triumph over adversity, I found myself suddenly jolted 
by a few paragraphs at the end of the article. 
</P>
<P>
It's not pleasant to write hard words about someone who has had their fill of 
hardship. But having read Buchan's comments on her suit against the U.S. 
Cycling Federation, I have to say something. 
</P>
<P>
I also suffered a head injury in a sanctioned race. I also was wearing a 
leather helmet. I was lucky, my skull (and other bones) healed. I knew, going 
in, that cycling could be a dangerous sport. I knew that I should have been 
wearing a hard-shell helmet (in 1975), and today I wear one every time I get on 
my bike. 
</P>
<P>
I am appalled that Buchan blames the organizers for not forcing her to wear a 
hard-shell helmet. The helmets were widely available in 1982. She had a choice 
to make. She made the wrong one, and she is paying for that choice. 
</P>
<P>
Her story is one of perseverance and hope triumphing over that tragedy. 
Unfortunately, it's also a commentary on our times. The Sierra Club can no 
longer sponsor climbs. Perhaps soon the USCF will be unable to sponsor amateur 
races. 
</P>
<P>
Buchan's story is a tragedy, brought on by bad bike handling and chance; I'm 
saddened that she chose to attack the rest of us who love the sport to satisfy 
her sense of justice.

DINAH SHORE GOLF TOURNAMENT; 
</P>
<P>
INKSTER ISN'T ENJOYING ROLE AS FRONT-RUNNER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Juli Inkster says it's extremely hard to win a tournament as a front-runner, 
adding, "That's why I can't watch the leader board." 
</P>
<P>
Others in the field of the $500,000 LPGA Nabisco Dinah Shore tournament at 
Mission Hills Country Club might disagree. 
</P>
<P>
Inkster is threatening to run away with the tournament. She shot a 69 Friday 
after a first-round 66 Thursday and is nine under par after 36 holes. 
</P>
<P>
More significant, she has a four-shot lead over Beth Daniel, her closest 
pursuer. 
</P>
<P>
The desert heat hasn't taken its toll on Inkster, 28, who won the Dinah Shore 
tournament in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"On the back side I was tired, but it wasn't the sun," Inkster said. "I just 
have a cold, but I had a lot of fluids and stayed relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
Starting on the 10th tee, Inkster quickly extended her two-shot lead with 
birdies on the 11th, 12th, 13th and 14th holes. She had a bogey at the 15th 
hole, but birdied the 17th for a score of 32 at the turn, and then had two 
bogeys and a birdie at No. 4 on her back side. 
</P>
<P>
"I played really well today," Inkster said. "I made some putts and hit a lot of 
greens. I was aggressive and confident. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good when you can shoot 66 and then come back and shoot in the 60s 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Inkster said that her caddy, Worth Blackwelder, husband of Myra Blackwelder, 
who is in the field, told her to stay relaxed with his soothing Southern 
accent. 
</P>
<P>
"He's from Kentucky, but he is a real Duke fan," Inkster said. "He kept telling 
me, 'Coach K (Duke basketball Coach Mike Krzyzewski) would say to remain calm, 
plug away and not put on the full-court press yet." 
</P>
<P>
Inkster is, of course, aware that she has a substantial lead, but she doesn't 
want to dwell on it. 
</P>
<P>
"No tournament is ever a runaway," she said. "I'm going to play like I'm trying 
to catch up, instead of being ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Inkster's husband, Brian, the pro at the Los Altos Country Club, is in the 
gallery. But he's trying to stay away from his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"Brian stays as far away from me as he can," Inkster said. "He's a hole ahead 
of me. He's my No. 1 fan and supporter whether I do good or bad. He's also my 
teacher." 
</P>
<P>
Inkster has 11 career victories, three last year, since she joined the tour in 
1983. When she won here in 1984, she beat Pat Bradley in a sudden death 
playoff. 
</P>
<P>
That tournament is distinguished for NBC-TV halting play for about 10 minutes 
because the women were playing too fast. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, a leader at the time, was fuming, eventually losing to Inkster in the 
playoff. 
</P>
<P>
Inkster was 10 under par Friday when she reached the par-four seventh hole. Her 
drive strayed to the right, landing in the rough in front of a fairway bunker, 
about 170 yards from the green. Then, she hit a six-iron that found the green, 
where she two-putted for her par on the 383-yard hole. 
</P>
<P>
She lost a stroke on the par-three, 166-yard eighth hole by three-putting. 
However, she recovered to get her par on the 508-yard ninth hole. 
</P>
<P>
"When I've won I've usually done it by coming from behind," Inkster said. "I'm 
very much of a momentum player and it takes me a while to get going." 
</P>
<P>
Daniel, who shot a two-under 70 for a 36-hole total of 139, said she was shaky 
at the outset of her round and uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
She had reason to be after getting a double bogey on the third hole, a par-four 
of 406 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"From that hole on I played four under par," Daniel said. "It (the round) could 
have been disastrous." 
</P>
<P>
Daniel, who is battling a viral infection, said she still has a fever, adding, 
"The heat isn't helping matters." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why no one is apparently charging at the leader, Daniel said: "I thought 
the course played extremely difficult today. The pin placements were much 
tougher. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, Juli has a history of playing well in majors. They turn her on." 
</P>
<P>
However, Daniel doesn't believe that Inkster's four-stroke lead is 
insurmountable. 
</P>
<P>
"Not the way this course is playing," she said. "On one day if you're not 
hitting your driver well and hit it into the rough, you'd have a tough time 
putting it on the green." 
</P>
<P>
Daniel also said that it's an advantage to follow an afternoon round with a 
morning round as Inkster has done because momentum can be sustained. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel will be playing with Inkster today and she says she'll ignore the 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to sit and watch her and be in awe," Daniel said. "I don't 
normally watch other people in my group." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Mike Donald, ignoring gusty winds that sent scores soaring, shot his second 
consecutive 67 Friday to take a four-shot lead after two rounds of the $800,000 
Independent Insurance Agent Open at The Woodlands, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Donald bogeyed his second hole of the day but made five birdies in a seven-hole 
span to finish 36 holes at 10-under-par 134. 
</P>
<P>
Seve Ballesteros, who was erratic with three birdies and three bogeys on the 
front nine, finished with his second straight 69 and was second. 
</P>
<P>
Winds continued to rake the par-72, 7,045-yard course, keeping scores high. The 
36-hole cut was 147, three over par. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Faxon, who challenged Donald until he double-bogeyed the par-5, 530-yard 
15th hole, finished with a 71 for 139. Curtis Strange, the defending champion, 
tied Faxon with a second-round 70. 
</P>
<P>
Don Bies, the top rookie on the 1988 PGA Senior Tour, shot a 4-under par 68 in 
cold, windy conditions to take a three-shot lead after one round of the Seniors 
Reunion Pro-Am at Frisco, Tex.. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Player and Bruce Crampton each shot one-under par 71 in north winds that 
gusted to 18 m.p.h.

Top seed Ivan Lendl continued his straight-set streak Friday by sweeping Kevin 
Curren in the semifinals of the International Players Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl won 6-2, 6-2, 6-3 in one hour, 50 minutes. He has yet to lose a set in 
six rounds. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to play when you're healthy, relaxed and confident," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Seventh-seeded Thomas Muster was scheduled to meet No. 12 Yannick Noah in the 
other semifinals match Friday night. Lendl will play the winner in Sunday's 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
"I like my chances, but it doesn't really matter that much," Lendl said. "If I 
lose, I'm not going to lose any sleep over it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I've done well in Australia (he won), and that's good enough for me until the 
French." 
</P>
<P>
Curren, seeded 13th, was unable to capitalize on his first semifinals berth in 
a two-week tournament since 1985. Only 51% of Curren's first serves were good, 
which neutralized his best weapon. He also had trouble putting away shots at 
the net, and said Lendl messed up his rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally it works the other way -- I don't give the opponent any rhythm," 
Curren said. "Today it felt like that for me. . . . He left me a little 
confused." 
</P>
<P>
Curren lost the last four games of the first set and the last six games of the 
second set. In the final set, he scored six points in Lendl's five service 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody has really tested him," Curren said. "That's what I had hoped to do. 
Then you get the tentative Ivan Lendl. . . . He's loose and he's having a good 
time." 
</P>
<P>
The first service break came in the sixth game, when Lendl chased down a lob 
over his head and hit a brilliant backhand winner for a 4-2 lead. He was in 
control of the match thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl improved his record this year to 19-1, his best start since 1986. He won 
this tournament that year.

TESTAVERDE AND WIFE OF NINE MONTHS AGREE TO DIVORCE BECAUSE OF HIS TEMPER

Vinny Testaverde, quarterback of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, said the breakup of 
his nine-month marriage has nothing to do with fame, money, jealousy or 
bitterness, but rather a longtime problem -- his temper. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been seeing a counselor because I have a temper, which I never wanted to 
believe was a problem," said Testaverde, who married Laura Gambucci last June 
11. 
</P>
<P>
"I hoped it would be different. I kept thinking it would get better," his wife 
said. "During the season, I just chose to ignore it . . . and not distract 
Vinny. But then after the season, it was just a little overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
Vinny Testaverde filed for divorce Wednesday in Tampa, saying the marriage was 
"irretrievably broken." 
</P>
<P>
Testaverde insisted the tribulations he suffered on the field through two 
losing seasons were not to blame for the flareups, saying: "The season had 
nothing to do with it. The problems were there way before . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The couple said the divorce was amicable and all claims against each other have 
been settled. They would not reveal the amount of a lump-sum alimony payment 
that was a condition of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Testaverde, 25, met his wife in Tempe, Ariz., in January of 1987, when he was 
preparing for the Fiesta Bowl with the Miami Hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, an aerobics instructor, said she feared her husband at times and 
decided to end things before the situation got out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
"It's best to do this and not go on hurting each other," Testaverde said.

SOVIET MAKES DEBUT IN CALGARY WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sergei Priakin made history Friday night at Calgary when he became the first 
Soviet to play in a National Hockey League game. 
</P>
<P>
Priakin, a 25-year-old right wing, failed to get a point in the Flames' 4-1 
victory over Winnipeg, but was on the ice for one of the Flames' goals. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 20,002 watched when Priakin jumped onto the ice 2:29 of the first 
period. In the first 20 minutes he had five shifts and stirred up action on 
each one of them. Once, he was knocked flat on a clean body check by Dale 
Hawerchuk of the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Priakin set up Tim Hunter in the slot. But Hunter mishandled the puck 
and didn't shoot. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Smith of the Montreal Canadiens, the vice president of the National 
Hockey League Players Assn., questioned the signing of Priakin. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to wonder if Priakin wasn't allowed to sign just for the money. The 
Soviets may just want to rake in our money," Smith said. "Putting him in 
uniform this late in the season, cuts some player out of a job." 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave the Flames a one-point lead over Montreal in the fight for the 
best overall record. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Mullen of the Flames scored his 50th goal, the first time he reached that 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 5, Detroit 1 -- Finishing third in the league's weakest division 
might not be cause for a celebration, but the North Stars aren't about to 
apologize. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Casey stopped 33 shots, including a penalty shot, and Mike Gartner had a 
goal and three assists at Detroit and the North Stars clinched third place in 
the Norris Division at the expense of the division's best team. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives us a little more confidence going into the playoffs," said Casey, 
who is 7-3-1 in his last 11 games. "We've been playing well defensively, but 
tonight we had some offense." 
</P>
<P>
Petr Klima, pulled down on a breakaway at 7:21 of the final period, lost 
control of the puck trying to fake out Casey. DAN HAFNER

Illinois Coach Lou Henson has been criticized for his mediocre record in the 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. tournament, but at least one of his players 
think it is unjust. 
</P>
<P>
At Friday's practice, Nick Anderson wore a T-shirt inscribed "Lou Can Do!" in 
support of Henson. 
</P>
<P>
"People have been down on him for so long, but Lou can do it," Anderson said. 
"I think he's a good coach. I don't care what anybody else says." 
</P>
<P>
Duke guard Quin Snyder signed autographs for 10 minutes as he was leaving the 
Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
A hometown hero who grew up on Mercer Island, Snyder would have gotten writer's 
cramp if a Duke official hadn't hurried him off. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Devils practiced at Mercer Island High, Snyder's old school, on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"Quin showed us his old locker and his prom pictures," quipped Duke Coach Mike 
Krzyzewski. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan forward Sean Higgins, a sophomore from Los Angeles, is an aspiring 
sportscaster. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be another Dick Vitale," Higgins said. "Most games are boring unless 
you have an exciting commentator. And maybe I could add some excitement to the 
games." 
</P>
<P>
Higgins was a no-show at a Dick Vitale sound-a-like contest held at a local 
bar. 
</P>

USC Coach George Raveling reportedly was contacted for the vacant head coaching 
job at Washington, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported. Raveling, who has 
two years remaining on his USC contract, was not interested. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Westhead, Loyola Marymount coach, also was contacted by Washington, the 
newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
Injured Clipper rookie Danny Manning, who led Kansas to the 1988 NCAA title, is 
here as a fan. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year I didn't have much fun because we had a job to do." Manning said. 
"I'm going to enjoy this." 
</P>
<P>
Who dies Manning pick? 
</P>
<P>
"I like Duke," said Manning, who scored 25 points as Kansas eliminated Duke, 
66-59, in a semifinal game last season. "I think Duke has the experience 
because they've been (in the Final Four) three of the last four years." 
</P>
<P>
Danny Ferry, the Duke center, has grown tired of being compared to Manning. 
</P>
<P>
"People have asked me if I'm this year's Danny Manning," Ferry said. "No, I'm 
not Danny Manning. I'm Danny Ferry."

TENNESSEE TOO MUCH FOR MARYLAND

When facing No. 1-ranked Tennessee, she who hesitates is lost. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland found that out Friday night as Tennessee's experience and defense 
carred it to a 77-65 victory in the semifinals of the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. women's basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish we could have given them a little better game," Maryland Coach Chris 
Weller said. "They are just flat-out a much better team than we are at this 
point. Their defense was unrelenting throughout the game." 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee (34-2) will play Auburn for the championship Sunday in the Tacoma 
Dome. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, it was the Terrapins (29-3) who inspired a big run by the 
Volunteers in the second half, from which Maryland never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Carla Holmes hit a three-pointer for Maryland to give the Terrapins their only 
lead of the half, 42-41, at 12:55. That seemed to be the challenge the 
Volunteers needed. Tennessee reeled off 12 straight points and that, the 
Volunteers seemed to say, was that. 
</P>
<P>
"Tennessee is a smart team," Weller said. "If you get a little run on them, 
they are going to be patient and come back." 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee, which prides itself in this area, outrebounded Maryland, 43-36. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was the most important statistic," said Tennessee Coach Pat 
Summitt. "In the second half, it was all Tennessee." 
</P>
<P>
As usual, Tennessee's big front line was most impressive. Center Shelia Frost 
scored 25 points and Bridgette Gordon contributed 24. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Sheila Frost had one of, if not the best, games of her career," 
Summitt said. "She told me on the way over here, 'I'm going to play well 
tonight.' It made a difference." 
</P>
<P>
The first half was tight until Tennessee, trailing at 15-14, scored eight 
straight points, four by Gordon and four by Frost. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what this team has been able to do this year," Summitt said. "Put 
together strong runs."

IT'S FIRST ADVANCE WINS SANTA ANITA FEATURE

<P>
It's First Advance, making her first turf start, retook the lead from favored 
Lem's Peace in the final strides to win Friday's $41,000 allowance feature by a 
head at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Jockey Laffit Pincay sent It's First Advance to the front from the start in the 
mile race for 3-year-old fillies and opened a two-length lead coming off the 
clubhouse turn. Lem's Peace, ridden by Robbie Davis, closed the gap at the top 
of the stretch and took a brief lead in mid-stretch. 
</P>
<P>
But It's First Advance, carrying high weight of 117 pounds, regained the lead 
and finished in 1:38 1/5. Twain Harte, with Eddie Delahoussaye aboard, finished 
third, another two lengths back.

HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
LA JOLLA IN THE DARK AGAINST MISSION BAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The sun set only minutes after the Mission Bay baseball team's 17-0 victory 
over La Jolla Friday. The game at Mission Bay High School took 2 hours and 45 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The sun set on La Jolla's offense much earlier. After about, oh, seven pitches. 
</P>
<P>
J.T. Thomas went the distance for Mission Bay, allowing just one hit to pick up 
the victory and improve his record to 4-1. But Thomas wasn't overly impressed 
with himself. Neither was Dennis Pugh, his coach. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't pitch as well as he can," Pugh said. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a rough time," said Thomas, a senior right-hander. "My control was 
really wild today." 
</P>
<P>
His first seven pitches were balls. Then things got smoother. Thomas didn't 
allow La Jolla, which dropped to 0-2 in City Western League, to advance a 
runner past second base. Pugh has grown accustomed to seeing his pitcher 
struggle with control early in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"It's normal for him," Pugh said. "If he gets through that first inning and 
he's throwing well, he might be unbelievable. That's J.T." 
</P>
<P>
And that, after those seven pitches, was pretty much a wrap. Mission Bay (11-2, 
2-0) got the only runs it would need in the second inning, scoring four times. 
Catcher Tom Lafever tripled, knocking in one run. Thomas singled up the middle 
to score Lafever. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Bay picked up another run in the third, five in the fourth, two in the 
fifth and five in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
The only real question Mission Bay probably left in the minds of the scattered 
fans Friday was whether or not this type of game is to be expected. Mission 
Bay, the defending City Western champions, has been picked unanimously by the 
other coaches in the league to win the title. But by scores such as 17-0? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to beat anybody that way," Pugh said. "I just think the league is 
down a little bit. It's going to take some time (for the other teams) to catch 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Mission Bay collected 13 hits and committed no errors. DON PATTERSON

TOP RATINGS FOR SCHULLER, 'WORLD TOMORROW'; 
</P>
<P>
TWO TV MINISTRIES RISE ABOVE BIBLE BELT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, Times Religion Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After the 1987-88 televangelist scandals, it was no surprise that the Rev. 
Robert Schuller's weekly "Hour of Power" emerged atop the religious programming 
heap. 
</P>
<P>
The glass on the Crystal Cathedral was barely smudged during the "holy wars" 
period, but every preacher's moral and financial integrity was scrutinized. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Garden Grove pastor dropped from a high of 2 million viewers 
in 1986 to about 1.3 million, and he sounded the alarm for emergency donations 
last Christmastime. Schuller apparently bounced back, while several Bible Belt 
shepherds saw their living room flocks continue to shrivel. 
</P>
<P>
As Schuller marks the showing Sunday of his 1,000th consecutive telecast (a 
celebrity-laden program with Mother Teresa, the Rev. Billy Graham, President 
Bush and four ex-presidents) he enjoys the widest viewing audience of any 
syndicated religious show. 
</P>
<P>
But quietly edging upward to share part of the spiritual TV summit with 
Schuller is "The World Tomorrow" -- a half-hour program on current issues 
produced by the little-known Worldwide Church of God, headquartered in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Schuller ranks first in number of viewers -- some 1.63 million nationally, 
compared to 1.37 million for the second-place "The World Tomorrow," according 
to Arbitron, a company that tracks syndicated TV religious viewing four times a 
year. Those figures, from last November, came from diaries kept in selected 
households. 
</P>
<P>
But "The World Tomorrow" ranks first in the number of households that turn on 
that program, according to Arbitron. The advantage in household numbers 
apparently comes from the fact that the Pasadena-produced program is aired on 
232 U.S. stations -- 70 more than "Hour of Power." 
</P>
<P>
In the most recent tabulation, taken in February and released Thursday by 
Arbitron in New York City, Schuller was closing the gap in the household 
figures behind "The World Tomorrow." "World Tomorrow" was switched on in 
1,387,000 homes, a gain of 56,000 since November, while Schuller's program was 
watched in 1,368,000 homes, an increase of 73,000. 
</P>
<P>
Although Schuller and the big-name evangelists have been analyzed extensively, 
most published studies of religious television have paid little notice to "The 
World Tomorrow," although it had climbed to fourth place in viewing audience 
size by November, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Resembling a religious "MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour," the program has four 
alternating hosts who weave videotaped interviews and news footage in with 
commentary on subjects ranging from the AIDS crisis, environmental problems and 
divorce to "last days" prophecies. 
</P>
<P>
The answers, the program advises, are found in the Bible -- a claim that sounds 
like a standard, conservative Protestant approach. A close listener would 
detect distinctive interpretations in the non-trinitarian church founded by the 
late Herbert W. Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
The church observes a Saturday Sabbath and many Jewish holy days, but not, for 
instance, Christmas or Easter, because those holidays arose out of 
post-biblical traditions. Members are expected to contribute more than 10% of 
their incomes and to stay out of political life. 
</P>
<P>
The Arbitron figures do not give the full picture of religious television 
viewing because cable programs are not monitored. It is unknown whether some 
evangelists would rank higher if it were possible to add cable watching. At any 
rate, Schuller and "World Tomorrow" are also on some cable systems, so their 
numbers would climb as well. 
</P>
<P>
The success of two top-rated programs outside the "fundamentalist preacher" 
genre is seen by some observers as promising for religious television, 
regardless of how limited that audience is. Religious-programming audiences are 
substantially smaller than those of the lowest-rated network shows, industry 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Televangelists Jimmy Swaggart of Baton Rouge, La., and Oral Roberts of Tulsa, 
Okla., have suffered the most slippage in recent times. Both were viewed in 
fewer households in February than last November. 
</P>
<P>
Swaggart, reported to have had a liaison with a prostitute, confessed publicly 
to unspecified sins in February, 1988, and subsequently was defrocked by his 
denomination, the Assemblies of God. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts announced this week that he must have $11 million by May 6 or face 
financial collapse. The faith healer and university president attributed a 
decline in donations to scandals in other ministries. "I have never been a part 
of those scandals," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts never seemed to recover, however, from the furor and ridicule that 
erupted in early 1987, when he said that God would take his life unless he 
raised $8 million to provide scholarships to medical school students at his 
college by April 1 that year. 
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the realignments in ranking, Stewart M. Hoover, author of "Mass 
Media Religion," said in an interview: 
</P>
<P>
"There is no substitute for being in the game a long time and not ruffling 
feathers." 
</P>
<P>
Schuller's string of 1,000 consecutive telecasts goes back to his first 
program, in February, 1970. It is the longest-running worship service on 
television. Schuller said he launched "Hour of Power" at Graham's suggestion 
during the latter's 1969 crusade in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"The World Tomorrow," which had been on radio since 1934, has been on 
television even longer than Schuller. After a brief try on TV in 1955, the 
commentary program began its current run in March, 1968, church officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Controversy is no stranger to the Worldwide Church of God. Garner Ted 
Armstrong, for years the polished host of the radio and television program, was 
ousted from the church in a family squabble in 1978. Charges of financial 
irregularities led to state-imposed receivership of the church, but the case 
was dismissed in 1982. In the years before he died, at age 93 in 1986, the 
senior Armstrong had divorced his second wife after a brief marriage, then was 
embroiled in a libel and slander suit by her. 
</P>
<P>
But the stories about the Armstrongs did not usually become national news. Even 
today, the church only has 92,000 members and generally worships in rented 
halls. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Internal' Scandals 
</P>
<P>
"The scandals they went through were largely internal ones," said Hoover, who 
teaches in Temple University's school of communications. 
</P>
<P>
In Schuller's case, controversy has been relatively rare and mild when it has 
occurred. In 1987, a former employee revealed that six years earlier, the 
minister had sent a fund-raising letter purportedly written during a trip to 
China but actually composed months before Schuller left the United States. The 
mailing included a simulated photograph of Schuller standing on the Great Wall, 
holding a Chinese translation of one of his books. 
</P>
<P>
Schuller's formula for building an audience has been consistent through the 
years: upbeat "possibility-thinking" sermons, music typical of the large 
mainline church it is, and well-known guests. The 10,000-member congregation is 
aligned with the Reformed Church in America. 
</P>
<P>
In typical hyperbole, the 1,000th broadcast is called "an epic event" by 
Schuller Ministries. Besides the former presidents, Mother Teresa and Graham, 
the program will feature the Rev. Norman Vincent Peale, Bob Hope and Marisa 
Wayne, youngest daughter of actor John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Low-Profile Ministry 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the Worldwide Church of God, based at its Ambassador College 
campus in Pasadena, maintains a low profile except in local cultural events and 
certain overseas projects. 
</P>
<P>
Although it shares the expectancy of evangelical Protestant churches that Jesus 
Christ will return soon to earth, the Worldwide Church keeps to itself, 
believing it is the true church of God. 
</P>
<P>
The apocalyptic-tinged perspective of the television program is evident also in 
its monthly magazine, "The Plain Truth," which has a free circulation of 7 
million worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
David Hulme, one of the "World Tomorrow" moderators and director of public 
affairs, attributed the program's improved standing to a variety of reasons, 
including self-imposed prohibitions on political debate, asking for money and 
proselytizing. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not focused on personality, but on a message," Hulme said, "and if the 
message is relevant, then people are going to listen more." 
</P>
<P>
The "drug dilemma," the subject of this weekend's program, will air the views 
of four experts, including Dr. Robert du Pont, former head of the National 
Institute on Drug Abuse. 
</P>
<P>
The program on AIDS last fall included interviews with U.S. Surgeon General C. 
Everett Koop in Washington and World Health Organization spokesmen in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the church has also been able to negotiate better contracts and 
for better time slots on Saturdays and Sundays, Hulme said. The program has an 
annual budget of more than $17 million, according to Michael A. Snyder, 
assistant public affairs director. 
</P>

TOP TV RELIGIOUS PROGRAMS 
</P>
<P>
Two Southern California-based programs lead the rankings by Arbitron Co. of 
syndicated religious TV programs, excluding cable broadcasts, which are not 
monitored. The national viewing audience estimates are from last November.

AUSTRALIAN FIRM TO BUY MGM/UA FOR $1 BILLION; 
</P>
<P>
QINTEX GROUP TO ACQUIRE 4,000 FILMS; KERKORIAN TO RETAIN SOME ASSETS 
</P>

<P>
The United Artists movie studio, maker of Oscar-winning "Rain Man," will be 
sold to an Australian entertainment company for $1 billion under an agreement 
announced late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The deal would give Qintex Group, one of the makers of the recent CBS 
miniseries "Lonesome Dove," most of the assets of MGM-UA Communications Co., 
including rights to "Rain Man." Also included would be a library of 4,000 
movies, among them the "James Bond" and "Pink Panther" series, the video 
library and movie and television production and distribution facilities. 
</P>
<P>
MGM-UA's majority shareholder, Kirk Kerkorian, would retain control of the MGM 
name and TV and movie studios, as well as 34 MGM movies, including "Moonstruck" 
and "A Fish Called Wanda." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement between Qintex and Kirk Kerkorian is subject to unspecified 
government, shareholder and "third-party" approvals, according to a joint 
announcement by the two companies. 
</P>
<P>
MGM-UA officials refused to elaborate on a news release, which said the deal 
was expected to be complete in late summer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How Deal Would Work 
</P>
<P>
It is the second time this year Kerkorian has agreed to sell part of the 
company he assembled out of the former United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer 
studios. In addition to a collapsed deal to sell an interest in the MGM name to 
fellow Hollywood investor Burt Sugarman in July, Kerkorian has been publicly 
shopping all or part of MGM-UA for months. 
</P>
<P>
Kerkorian, who owns 82% of MGM-UA through his Tracinda Corp., pumped $180 
million of his own funds into the money-losing company in January. MGM-UA lost 
$39.5 million in the first quarter of 1989 and $48.7 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Under the complicated agreement with Qintex, Kerkorian will hang onto rights to 
the MGM name and roaring lion logo as well as movie and TV production units. 
Also remaining with MGM are 34 movies made since June 1986, including 
"Moonstruck," "A Fish Called Wanda," and "Willow;" 1,750 hours of TV 
programming including the ongoing shows "thirtysomething" and "In the Heat of 
the Night;" and the MGM headquarters building here. 
</P>
<P>
The deal is to work this way: Kerkorian sells 100% of MGM-UA to Qintex for $20 
a share, or about $1 billion. Then the company is split, and Kerkorian buys 
back what will be the new MGM -- the MGM movie and TV studios plus the 34 
movies in the MGM film and video libraries -- for $250 million. 
</P>
<P>
Further intertwining the now independent MGM and UA, Kerkorian is to invest $75 
million in Qintex, and the companies sign various distribution agreements.

GROUP SEEKS TO FIGHT BANKS' 'REDLINING'; 
</P>
<P>
ASKS THAT MORE MONEY BE REINVESTED IN MINORITY COMMUNITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A coalition of community organizations has requested a meeting with federal 
banking regulators and industry executives to discuss ways to persuade 
California banks to provide more loans to minorities and increase the 
availability of affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
The organization, called the Greenlining Coalition, asked Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan and Robert F. Erburu, chairman of the Federal Reserve 
Bank of San Francisco, to set a meeting within the next 30 days. The group 
asked that the chief executives of the state's largest banks be asked to 
attend. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the San Francisco Fed said Friday that the agency expects to 
respond quickly to the letter. He also said that recent San Francisco Fed 
studies have pointed out the pressing credit needs of some metropolitan areas 
in the state with high minority populations. 
</P>
<P>
The letter was dated Wednesday and said the group represents 16 organizations 
for minorities, consumers and the homeless, including the Urban League, the 
League of United Latin American Citizens and the San Francisco Black Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The group said it wants to discuss compliance with the federal Community 
Reinvestment Act by the state's big banks. 
</P>
<P>
The act requires financial institutions to provide loans and services to its 
community without discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the group said big banks should help finance more affordable 
housing, particularly for the homeless, preserve inner-city neighborhoods and 
assist minority-owned financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
"Not one federal official has raised an outcry over the fact that blacks have 
received less than half of 1% of the dollar value of recent bank loans," said 
George Dean, president of the California Council of Urban Leagues. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition also asked Federal Reserve officials to conduct random audits of 
loan portfolios at major banks in the state to ensure that they are complying 
with the CRA. 
</P>
<P>
The letter cited remarks made by Rep. Pete Stark (D-Oakland) that all banks and 
savings and loans "redline," a practice in which minority neighborhoods do not 
receive a fair share of loans. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony before a House committee on March 9, Stark said redlining is 
essentially impossible to detect, and he criticized the effectiveness of 
federal laws against the practice. 
</P>
<P>
California's big banks have consistently denied that they discriminate in 
lending. Many of the banks recently formed a consortium, under sponsorship of 
the San Francisco Fed, to pool money and provide loans for developers of 
low-cost housing in the state. The savings and loan industry has a similar 
coalition.

Resorts International Inc.: The North Miami, Fla.-based owner, developer and 
operator of hotel and casino operations reported a loss of $381 million for 
1988, contrasted with a profit of $10 million the previous year. Revenue held 
steady at $456 million. The firm attributed the results to a loss of $336 
million from the sale of the Taj Mahal Hotel and the payment of a fee related 
to the termination of a services agreement.

AUSTRALIAN GROUP BUYS 24.4% STAKE IN BARRIS FROM SUGARMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
An Australian joint venture that operates one of that country's top commercial 
television networks has purchased a 24.4% interest in Beverly Hills-based 
Barris Industries Inc. for $34.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Westfield Capital Corp. and Northern Star Holdings Ltd. acquired the stake 
previously held by financier Burt Sugarman's Giant Group Ltd. As part of the 
sale, Sugarman will resign as chairman of Barris, along with Giant's three 
other members of the Barris board. 
</P>
<P>
Sugarman's exit leaves Barris in the hands of Peter Guber and Jon Peters, the 
prolific Hollywood movie producing team whose latest effort, "Rain Man," just 
won four Oscars, including one for Best Picture. 
</P>
<P>
Guber and Peters -- who merged their Guber-Peters Co. with Barris in December, 
1987 -- will function as "joint managing directors" of the new company, said 
Frank Lowy, chairman of Westfield and Northern Star. "Guber and Peters are 
taking over operating control of Barris," Lowy said. "They will have five-year 
contracts, full operational responsibility and full creative and financial 
control." Lowy will become chairman of the new company, which will be renamed 
sometime in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"This new partnership makes Barris a global entertainment company concentrating 
totally on entertainment, movies, TV, video and music," Guber said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the purchase agreement, the Australian joint venture will have the 
right to name half of the members of Barris' board. In addition, the Australian 
rights to all television, movie and recording properties developed by Barris 
will be available to Northern Star's Network Ten Australia.

C&amp;S BANK EXPRESSES DOUBTS ABOUT NCNB BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<DATELINE>

<P>
Citizens &amp; Southern Corp. said Friday that it had "serious questions" about 
the terms of a surprise merger offer from North Carolina's NCNB Corp., and some 
analysts said the proposed merger of two of the Southeast's largest banking 
companies would face numerous obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at NCNB, however, insisted their offer of a stock swap was friendly 
and would benefit both companies. The C&amp;S board scheduled a special meeting 
for Monday in Atlanta to discuss the $2.4-billion proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte-based NCNB announced its unsolicited bid Thursday night, culminating 
a long-acknowledged desire to break into the Georgia banking market. 
</P>
<P>
The bid came four months after NCNB took control of Texas' largest bank. NCNB 
paid more than $200 million for a 20% stake in First RepublicBank Corp. last 
year after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. chose NCNB to manage and operate 
the financially ailing facility. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal to acquire C&amp;S would result in the creation of the nation's 
sixth-largest banking company with more than $75 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
In a three-page letter dated Thursday, NCNB proposed a tax-free exchange giving 
C&amp;S stockholders 1.075 shares of NCNB common stock for each share of 
C&amp;S common stock. NCNB stock closed Thursday at $36.25 and C&amp;S at 
$26.75. 
</P>
<P>
"Our remarkable franchise would leave our other competitors behind," NCNB 
Chairman Hugh L. McColl Jr. wrote. 
</P>
<P>
C&amp;S issued a statement saying the offer would have to be studied. 
</P>
<P>
"Any proposal involving NCNB stock raises a number of serious questions of 
value and regulatory approval that have to be carefully evaluated," the C&amp;S 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our senior managers are meeting and talking (about the proposal) but until the 
board meets on Monday there will be nothing substantive," said C&amp;S 
spokeswoman Karen Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas K. Brown, a banking industry analyst with Smith Barney in New York, said 
the stock exchange approach may not win favor with C&amp;S stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
"I would give the odds 60% against and 40% for, at this price," Brown said. "I 
think C&amp;S would conclude that it's too low." 
</P>
<P>
NCNB's stock has risen sharply over the last three months since the First 
RepublicBank deal, and Brown said it could begin to decline. 
</P>
<P>
"The critical concern there among investors is that (NCNB) bit off too much" in 
Texas, he said. "Now, can they do two (big deals) at one time? I suspect they 
cannot." 
</P>
<P>
Another obstacle to the deal, Brown said, is the contrast in styles between 
NCNB's and C&amp;S' management. 
</P>
<P>
"You have two distinctly different cultures," he said. "NCNB is hard-charging, 
aggressive. C&amp;S is what I call a community banking organization, more 
deliberate." 
</P>
<P>
The NCNB proposal calls for retaining the directors and management of C&amp;S, 
with the Atlanta-based bank operating in Georgia as an autonomous company. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, since everything's been proposed, it's quite possible it could go 
through -- either as proposed or with some modifications," said Rick Mueller, 
an analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. in Chicago. "I think when you look at it 
from the shareholders' standpoint, they'd prefer cash to stock. It really 
depends on the shareholders' position."

MCorp, the Texas bank holding company stripped of 20 of its 25 banks by federal 
regulators, filed suit Friday against the government agencies on grounds that 
10 to 14 of the banks seized were not insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed against the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., added another twist to the already 
complicated case that may not be resolved for months and could cost the 
government more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"The company asserts that 10 to 14 of those banks were not in fact insolvent," 
MCorp said in its lawsuit, which seeks $70 million that MCorp said it lost when 
the comptroller declared 20 MBanks insolvent Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
MCorp, which was Texas' second-largest bank holding company until its collapse, 
also filed a motion Friday in federal bankruptcy court in New York to convert 
an involuntary Chapter 7 liquidation proceeding filed against it into a Chapter 
11 petition. 
</P>
<P>
The Chapter 7 action, which set in motion the latest MCorp developments, was 
filed last week by three minor bondholders of the bank holding company.

Mutual Fund Sales Plummet: Net sales (sales minus redemptions) of stock, bond 
and income mutual funds in February totaled $573 million, down sharply from 
$1.5 billion in January, the Investment Company Institute reported. The decline 
reflected a massive shift of funds into money market mutual funds, as investors 
sought high yields on those funds that recently have averaged 9.46%. Net sales 
of stock funds in February totaled a negative $56.2 million, further evidence 
that small investors continue to shun equity markets.

PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: INVESTORS CAN CASH IN ON HIGH INTEREST RATES IF 
THEY READ THE SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OK, so you've locked in a comfy 9% on a six-month certificate of deposit. Or 
you've just bought that three-month Treasury bill paying a nice 9.25%. Or 
you've been lucky enough to pick a money market mutual fund earning a sweet 
10%. 
</P>
<P>
You're in savers' heaven. But should you try to go "long" and earn even more 
money? 
</P>
<P>
That is the question that many investors should be beginning to ask, now that 
rates on CDs, Treasury issues, money market funds and other short-term 
fixed-income investments have reached their highest levels in years. 
</P>
<P>
Rates on some of these may still go higher. CD rates, for example, may rise 
further in April, as savings institutions compete for billions of dollars in 
CDs expected to mature this month. April traditionally is the heaviest month 
for CD maturities and new purchases, in part because people need cash for tax 
payments or deposit their tax refunds. 
</P>
<P>
But if and when interest rates in the economy peak and begin to fall -- an 
event that some analysts say may be just around the corner -- you could earn a 
lot more by buying savings-oriented investments with longer maturities, such as 
mutual funds investing in long-term bonds. When interest rates fall, these 
longer-term vehicles gain in value, on top of paying interest. 
</P>
<P>
That's because investors will be willing to pay more for already issued 
investments that lock in higher interest rates than are available for new 
investments. A 30-year Treasury bond, for example, can gain as much as 10% in 
value for each 1 percentage point drop in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Investors in long-term bonds and bond mutual funds made as much as 30% to 40% 
in 1982, when banks' prime lending rate dropped five percentage points. In a 
recession, when business activity slows and interest rates tumble, long-term 
bonds can be among the best investments around. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the opposite is true if interest rates rise. When interest rates 
jump by one point, you can lose as much as 10% in long-term bonds. Investors 
learned this lesson painfully in 1987 and again recently when rates rose 
sharply. 
</P>
<P>
That is why it is important to wait until interest rates peak before you jump 
into longer-term fixed-income investments. 
</P>
<P>
How do you know that interest rates have peaked? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the surest and safest sign is to look for a drop in the prime rate, 
which now stands at 11.5% and has been rising steadily in recent months. Banks 
typically don't drop the prime until they are convinced that other interest 
rates are heading south. Thus, the prime lags other falling rates -- but is 
more reliable. 
</P>
<P>
"It's better to be a little late," Donald J. Phillips, editor Mutual Fund 
Values, a Chicago-based investment advisory service. "You can still catch 
plenty of the effect of lower rates even if you're not the first one on the 
bandwagon." 
</P>
<P>
A much quicker, but somewhat less reliable, sign is a decline in the so-called 
federal funds rate. That is what banks pay on reserves for overnight use. That 
rate, currently around 9.8%, will begin to move down if the Federal Reserve 
Board decides it is time to ease credit conditions and drive down other rates. 
</P>
<P>
Another quick sign will be falling investment yields on Treasury bills. You can 
also look for rates on CDs or money market funds. 
</P>
<P>
Another sign that interest rates may be beginning to peak is a sustained fall 
in the inflation rate. The Fed has been raising rates in order to fight rising 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
A small but growing number of analysts think an interest rate peak may be near 
or already has happened. They cite evidence that inflation may not be as bad as 
previously feared and that economic growth may be slowing. Both indicators 
would cause the Fed to ease interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Some forecasters are going even further. The UCLA Business Forecasting Project, 
for example, on Thursday predicted a national recession starting in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But they and other economists have cried wolf before. So conservative investors 
should wait until the evidence is more persuasive. 
</P>
<P>
Once you are convinced that rates are falling, where should you invest? Here 
are several options appropriate for small investors: 
</P>
<P>
* Long-term bond mutual funds. This is probably the easiest and most convenient 
way to play. And if you buy "no-load" funds that don't charge sales 
commissions, it is also the cheapest. And if you decide you've made a mistake 
and want to pull out, selling fund shares is relatively painless. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips of Mutual Fund Values suggests sticking to funds with high-quality 
issues, being wary of popular high-yield bond funds that invest in riskier 
"junk bonds." They yield more and can also gain in value if rates fall, but if 
the economy enters into a recession, more junk bonds will default, reducing 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
One high-quality long-term bond fund that Phillips recommends is Vanguard Fixed 
Income-U.S. Treasury Bond Fund (800-662-7447), which invests primarily in 
Treasury issues. 
</P>
<P>
If you're interested in the safety of government bonds but want more potential 
returns, Phillips suggests Benham Target Maturity 2005 (800-982-6150 in 
California), a fund that invests in long-term zero-coupon Treasury bonds. They 
rise dramatically when interest rates fall. 
</P>
<P>
Another sometimes mentioned alternative is Ginnie Mae funds, which invest in 
packages of home mortgages. However, investors often cannot enjoy the full 
fruits of declining interest rates because as mortgage rates fall, homeowners 
refinance at lower rates, reducing yields on Ginnie Maes. 
</P>
<P>
* Intermediate-term bond funds. As a less volatile compromise, consider buying 
these funds, with maturities generally between two and 10 years. While you 
won't earn as much price appreciation if interest rates fall, you won't lose as 
much if you guess wrong and rates head back up. 
</P>
<P>
By investing in intermediate maturities, "you can get most of the returns (of 
long-term bonds) without taking all of the risks," says Steve Janachowski of 
Brouwer &amp; Janachowski, a San Francisco money management firm. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Janachowski says, the bond market "is harder to time than the stock 
market, because it can turn around overnight. (Fed Chairman Alan) Greenspan 
could wake up one morning and be paranoid about inflation and put his foot on 
the brakes." 
</P>
<P>
Intermediate-term bond funds that Janachowski likes include Fidelity 
Intermediate Bond Fund (800-544-6666), with maturities of around 10 years, and 
Neuberger &amp; Berman Limited Maturity Bond Fund (800-367-0770), a 
conservative alternative with maturities of two to five years. 
</P>
<P>
Fund analyst Phillips also suggests Boston Co. Managed Income (800-225-5267) 
and Babson Bond Trust (800-422-2766). And he suggests Strong Income Fund 
(800-368-3863), whose managers try to time the bond market by shifting 
maturities, going shorter when rates rise and longer when rates fall. 
</P>
<P>
* Long- or intermediate-term Treasuries. Treasury bonds, with maturities of 
between 10 and 30 years, are easy to buy and sell, requiring minimum 
investments of as little as $1,000. And they are safe. Your principal, if you 
hold a Treasury bond to maturity, is backed by the full faith and credit of the 
U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
As a less volatile compromise, consider buying medium-term Treasury notes, with 
maturities of between two and 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
* Long- or intermediate-term municipal bonds. These are good if you're in a 
high tax bracket, since interest won't be subject to federal taxes and possibly 
state and local as well. Most small investors are better off in mutual funds or 
unit investment trusts rather than individual issues. 
</P>
<P>
Investment adviser Janachowski likes Fidelity Limited Term Municipal 
(800-544-6666), Vanguard Municipal Bond Fund -- Intermediate Term 
(800-662-7447) as well as Stein Roe Tax-Exempt Income Trust -- Managed 
Municipals (800-338-2550). 
</P>
<P>
* Long-term brokered CDs. These are conventional CDs issued by banks or savings 
and loans that are traded actively at stock brokerages just like bonds. 
Accordingly, like bonds, they rise and fall in value if sold before maturity, 
and you don't have to pay early withdrawal penalties. But they are still 
insured by federal deposit insurance agencies.

EXPANDING ARTS IN ORANGE COUNTY ;

Genoese architect Renzo Piano's schematic design for Newport Harbor Art 
Museum's new building, approved Thursday night by the museum's board of 
trustees, allows for massive future expansion of the building on its 10 
1/2-acre site at the corner of East Coast Highway and MacArthur Boulevard in 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Piano discussed his design in words that suggest a magic realm of nature and 
culture on Friday. The interior space of the one-story, $20-million museum will 
be defined by a series of walls aligned parallel to the Coast Highway. Set into 
the hillside, these walls will create a series of "fingers" extending from 
MacArthur Boulevard toward Avocado Road. (Museum officials are refusing to 
release any sketches or renderings of the plan.) 
</P>
<P>
The roof, which Piano calls a "flying carpet," will have several functions. It 
will be a porous membrane, letting in light and air. It will merge with the 
surrounding vegetation of the hillside. And it will serve as the entrance to 
the museum. In Piano's words, the museum will be a "microcosm, protected by an 
organic shelter," permitting visitors to move from outside to inside "without a 
big psychological separation." 
</P>
<P>
Visitors will park their cars above the museum -- next to land that will one 
day house a 12-acre park and the new location of the Newport Beach Public 
Library -- and walk to the roof of the museum. This vantage point will yield an 
unobstructed view of the ocean, above the level of the houses on the ocean side 
of the Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
And from the roof -- as Piano told an amused audience in his Friday lecture at 
the Pacific Design Center's "WestWeek '89" conference in Los Angeles -- 
visitors will "fall down into the museum," or rather, as he corrected himself, 
"come gently down" via an escalator that leads to the main hall of the museum. 
In other words, this building will have no "front door" as such and no 
traditional welcoming facade. 
</P>
<P>
Piano said the design was intended as a solution to the site's major problems: 
the noise of the traffic at the busy intersection and the lack of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, a "street" running through the center of the building will connect the 
"fingers" housing various departments and functions of the museum: the two 
galleries housing the permanent collection, the temporary exhibit gallery, the 
auditorium, restaurant, bookstore, education and staff support areas. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time you cross the 'fingers' you are in touch with different functions 
of the museum," Piano said. This device is intended to involve the viewer in a 
synergistic experience of the museum as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
And whereas the "fingers" are relatively compressed spaces, the street also 
will offer visitors multiple opportunities to experience the gardens that will 
surround and penetrate the museum.

AN EMIGRE ARTIST, EXILED 18 YEARS AGO, RETURNS AS A U.S. CITIZEN FOR MOSCOW,

<P>
When artist Mihail Chemiakin stepped off the plane from New York here last 
week, he was wearing his ragged old sheepskin coat -- the same one he wore 18 
years ago when he was sent into exile by Soviet authorities for his 
nonconformist style. 
</P>
<P>
That was Chemiakin's way of reminding them: "I have not changed my ideas, I 
have not compromised my principles. It is you who have had to change." 
</P>
<P>
And indeed the Soviet art scene has changed, perhaps as dramatically as the 
country's political scene, in the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
"Until the very day I got on the plane to Moscow, I could not think of 
returning to the Soviet Union," said Chemiakin, who now lives in New York and 
and later became an American citizen. "This was a land where everything I had 
done and wanted to do was forbidden, and not only forbidden but punished, 
savagely punished. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"But change has come -- big changes, exciting changes and, I hope, truly deep 
changes. I was still dubious, still apprehensive when I arrived here, returning 
as an artistic and political exile to what we call with such nostalgia the 
rodina -- the motherland -- but I think the changes are as sweeping as they are 
dramatic." 
</P>
<P>
While Chemiakin's works -- often symbolic, sometimes fantastic, occasionally 
grotesque and tortured -- go well beyond the mainstream of Soviet art even in 
its liberated forms today, they are clearly recognized for their intense 
creativity and artistic integrity. 
</P>
<P>
"Every artist has his own face, his own philosophy, his own view of life, his 
own feeling for our times, and now we recognize this, we finally recognize 
this," Tair Salakhov, first secretary of the Soviet Union of Artists, said in 
an interview. "For a long, long time we unfortunately had another view of art, 
another approach to culture." 
</P>
<P>
Chemiakin, whose attempts at private shows for his avant-garde works in the 
1960s were routinely broken up by the KGB, the Soviet security police, now has 
two major monthlong exhibitions. One is in Moscow and the other is in 
Leningrad, and both have been lavishly greeted by Soviet artists and 
intellectuals as a major cultural event and a homecoming for one of the 
country's premier artists. 
</P>
<P>
"Politically and culturally, this is a very important exhibition," Salakhov 
said. "Many people never believed that this could happen, that Mihail Chemiakin 
could return to the Soviet Union. For those who want to see in concrete actions 
that we are changing, that this is not just rhetoric, look at the exhibition of 
Mihail Chemiakin." 
</P>
<P>
Brutally interrogated, imprisoned in psychiatric institutions and even tortured 
for his attacks on Socialist Realism, the artistic orthodoxy here for decades, 
and for his refusal to bow to the authorities, Chemiakin is now feted by the 
official Union of Artists and senior government officials. 
</P>
<P>
"That Mihail Chemiakin has been invited back and honored after being persecuted 
for years and then forced into exile testifies to the changes that are under 
way in the Soviet Union," said Serge Sorokko, another Soviet emigre who has 
become Chemiakin's art dealer in the United States. "His work is now, as it was 
when he was exiled, totally at odds with Socialist Realism and that whole cast 
of mind. 
</P>
<P>
"His return reflects, of course, the political and cultural liberalization here 
under (President Mihail S.) Gorbachev, but it is also part of the country's 
desire to reach out and embrace its children who have done well in the West. 
They want to bring back the best of the emigre community in all the arts to 
restore the creativity and vitality that Russia used to have." 
</P>
<P>
The return of the emigres, among whom were many of the country's greatest 
artistic and scientific talents, has become a major feature in Soviet cultural 
and intellectual life in the past year: 
</P>
<P>
Ballerina Natalia Makarova returned to dance with Leningrad's Kirov Ballet last 
month, 19 years after she defected to the West. 
</P>
<P>
Yuri Lyubimov, who was fired as director of the country's most daring theater 
and stripped of his Soviet citizenship five years ago, is back at Moscow's 
Taganka Theater and producing previously banned plays. 
</P>
<P>
Andrei Sinyavsky, the dissident writer, returned for the funeral of his friend 
Yuli Daniel in January and expects to visit again. 
</P>
<P>
Film director Andrei Mikhailov-Konchalovsky has come back to work here. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union of Composers recently reinstated the renowned cellist Mstislav 
Rostropovich, who now conducts the National Symphony in Washington, and has 
invited him to return for performances this year or next. 
</P>
<P>
Invitations are also being extended, according to well-informed Soviet sources, 
to the poet Joseph Brodsky, winner of the 1987 Nobel Prize for Literature, to 
dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov, a defector from the Bolshoi Ballet, and to writers 
Vladimir Voinovich and Lev Kopelev. 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, there is no serious suggestion of inviting Alexander 
Solzhenitsyn, the Nobel laureate exiled in 1974 after publication of his "Gulag 
Archipelago." 
</P>
<P>
These and others had all gone into exile, some voluntarily as emigrants or 
defectors but many involuntarily, during what is now characterized as the 
"period of stagnation" under President Leonid I. Brezhnev, who led the country 
from 1964 until his death in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been arrested many times by the KGB," Chemiakin recalled in an 
interview. "They said my art was a threat to the security of the state, that it 
was subversive or seditious or some such. I had been put into psychiatric 
institutions for forced treatment. I had been sent to labor camps. I was 
repeatedly put into jail for what they called 'interrogation' or 
'administrative detention.' This went on and on. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The last time I was arrested I had a very polite conversation with a well 
spoken gentleman in Leningrad whom I took to be from the KGB. He said simply 
that I could either go back to the psychiatric hospital -- there were enough 
people who thought that my art was mad and that I must be insane, though this 
hardly mattered -- or I could go to prison and then to a labor camp for a long, 
long time. 
</P>
<P>
"The only other possibility was to go abroad. 'Face it,' this KGB man told me, 
'you cannot live here. They won't let you, we won't let you.' And so, I agreed 
to leave. I was only 27 then, and already half my life had been one kind of 
trouble or another with the authorities. It was all very quick. I was forbidden 
to tell my parents or my friends. I just packed up and left." 
</P>
<P>
Chemiakin, whose face and arms are heavily scarred from what associates 
described as self-inflicted wounds from that period, went on: "We were like 
nails. Those who could not be hammered flat were pulled out and either 
discarded abroad or thrown into the political trash bins here." 
</P>
<P>
Sorokko, who emigrated 10 years ago and is now a partner in the Bowles-Sorokko 
Galleries in Los Angeles and San Francisco, recalled how "anything that did not 
reflect Socialist Realism and promote the party's ideology and its political 
twists and turns" was characterized as "deviant," and this made "nonconformist" 
art seditious in the official view. 
</P>
<P>
"Art and culture as a whole were an ideological battlefield," Sorokko said. "If 
a work did not reflect the leading role of the Communist Party and all that the 
party put forward, it was subversive. If it did not portray what the party said 
was policy in the way that the party said it was portrayed, it was by 
definition nonconformist and thus forbidden. Chemiakin even got into trouble 
illustrating innocent things like Dostoyevsky's novels, Charles Dickens' novels 
and (Ernst) Hoffmann's fairy tales." 
</P>
<P>
Chemiakin, however, sees "politics, dirty, grubby politics," rather than 
ideological questions, as underlying his problems. 
</P>
<P>
"It was traditional to blame the authorities, the KGB and so forth," he said. 
"But the real battle then was within the Union of Artists in Leningrad. The 
Union of Artists was a huge pie around which many were trying to gather and 
feed from. Naturally, they tried not to let anyone else near that feast, and 
against those whose works were nonconformist their weapons were ideological. 
The KGB carried out all the nastiness while the people who set them on me 
remained in the shadows as 'honored workers of culture.' " 
</P>
<P>
Chemiakin, the Moscow-born son of a Soviet army colonel and a prominent Russian 
actress, went into exile in Paris in 1971, and was immediately hailed by art 
critics in Western Europe, where he had a series of successful exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
But Chemiakin, who is now 45, was disappointed when the French capital did not 
live up to his romantic idealization of it as the city of Ernest Hemingway and 
Edith Piaf, and in 1981 he moved to New York. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I saw New York, in 1975, I felt it was my city, my home," he 
said. "But it took me a few years to establish my name in Europe to give me a 
basis to move to New York." 
</P>
<P>
Although he left out drawings he describes as "erotic-grotesque," the selection 
of 160 works has been uncompromising for the exhibition at the new House of 
Artists at Moscow's prestigious Tretyakov Gallery, as well as for the 
retrospective show in Leningrad of earlier works. 
</P>
<P>
"What they did not like, I have brought back, and they have accepted me and my 
work," he said with pride. "I am very interested, for example, in the question 
of how beastly a person can become towards others, as in the twin themes of 
Hitlerism and Stalinism, and that is represented here." 
</P>
<P>
Chemiakin has been rewarded by huge crowds at the exhibition as well as the 
attendance of leading cultural figures at the opening. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, Chemiakin has always been a great artist," said Salakhov of the Union 
of Artists. "I personally love his works, and I appreciate his philosophy and 
his viewpoint on life. We can see that Chemiakin's will, his character as an 
artist, his courageous spirit have not been dissipated among all the numerous 
artistic movements in the West, but he kept it and enriched world art. 
</P>
<P>
"To bring his work back to the Soviet Union in two exhibitions that reflect him 
so well is a very important thing for us. These exhibitions will inevitably 
influence other artists and will have an impact on Soviet art as a whole. But 
we also hope that what he will see in Soviet art today will give him new food 
for thought. Our people are not standing still."

ROSS, HENLEY, BROWNE SPARK UNIVERSAL LINEUP

<TEXT>
<P>
Diana Ross will make her first Los Angeles-area concert appearances in five 
years when she headlines the Universal Amphitheatre for four nights beginning 
July 19. 
</P>
<P>
Ross -- whose shows will be part of her first tour since she became part owner 
of Motown Records -- was among 41 acts announced Wednesday for the 
amphitheater's spring through fall season. 
</P>
<P>
Also returning after lengthy hiatuses from touring are Don Henley, whose Sept. 
26 and 27 shows will be his first L.A. dates in four years, and Jackson Browne, 
whose Aug. 11-13 stand represents his first non-benefit L.A. shows in three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the 41 acts will be making multi-night stands. They include 
Dolly Parton (July 12-13), L.L. Cool J (July 25-26), Tom Petty &amp; the 
Heartbreakers (July 29-30), Randy Travis (Aug. 9-10), Kenny Rogers (Nov. 24-26) 
and Barry Manilow (Dec. 26-31). 
</P>
<P>
"It's the most (multi-night stints) we've had since we opened in '82," said 
Larry Vallon, the amphitheater's executive vice president, noting what he sees 
as a trend toward such stands in mid-size venues (the Universal holds 6,200) as 
an alternative to single shows at such larger arenas as the Forum or Los 
Angeles Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Also increased this year will be the the number of shows featuring the general 
admission, standing-only "Party in the Pit" area in front of the regular 
reserved seats. Introduced last year for several shows, including concerts by 
Keith Richards and Steel Pulse, the "party" tickets will be offered this year 
for such acts as Petty and L.L. Cool J. 
</P>
<P>
For some other shows, Vallon said, special themes will be adopted, a la Duran 
Duran's shows last month for which the amphitheater was decorated as a mid-'60s 
English dance club. One special event planned is Joan Baez's Dec. 16 show, 
which will mark the singer's 30th anniversary as a professional musician and 
will feature special guest appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Vallon said the 41 acts represent about half of the final amphitheater 
summer/fall lineup. Additional shows will be announced as acts are signed. 
</P>
<P>
The schedule also includes several non-pop music performances, with the Royal 
Danish Ballet (June 11), comic actress/singer Sandra Bernhard (Oct. 5) and 
comedian Steven Wright (Oct. 9). 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the announced schedule: 
</P>
<P>
April 29, Guy, Today and Salt-N-Pepa; May 17, a reggae fest with the Wailers 
and Third World; May 19-21, Willie Nelson; May 26-27, Roberto Carlos; June 2,

MORTON DOWNEY JR. SCUFFLES WITH TELEVISION CREW SEEKING INTERVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Incendiary talk show host Morton Downey Jr. reportedly struck a soundman in the 
head with a microphone Thursday when a television crew from the show "Inside 
Edition" confronted him for a surprise interview outside his New York office. 
</P>
<P>
The crew had hoped to speak to Downey about an alleged gold-mine scam, even 
though Downey had turned down a formal interview request. 
</P>
<P>
"Downey went absolutely berserk," said "Inside Edition" managing editor Charles 
Lachman, who was with the crew. "He began screaming, cursing, grabbed the boom 
mike and swung it into the soundman's head." 
</P>
<P>
Downey then climbed into his chauffeur-driven limousine and "drove off, giving 
the thumbs up sign" to the crowd, Lachman said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Downey said that the 56-year-old talk show host had "reacted" 
after the soundman struck him while thrusting the mike in his face.

PLANE CRASHES ON O.C. TENNIS COURT; 5 DIE; 
</P>
<P>
PILOT SEEMS TO VEER FROM CLUBHOUSE AS TENNIS PLAYERS FLEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A private plane carrying a Canadian family of five crashed onto a tennis court 
at the Newport Beach Tennis Club Friday morning, exploding in a fireball and 
killing all aboard. 
</P>
<P>
The plane narrowly missed tennis players and the clubhouse. No one on the 
ground was injured. 
</P>
<P>
The plane had taken off from John Wayne Airport at 8:33 a.m. One witness at the 
airport said that just after the takeoff, the plane appeared to be flying 
abnormally low with at least one engine backfiring. Soon afterward, smoke was 
seen spewing from the plane. 
</P>
<P>
Air traffic controllers observing the plane's apparent distress radioed the 
pilot, who responded in a clear and calm voice, "We have to come back," 
according to a federal investigator at the crash scene. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses at the tennis club said the plane turned but dove steeply toward the 
pricey Eastbluff residential community less than 2 miles from the end of the 
runway. It then nosed nearly straight down, in an apparent attempt to miss the 
tennis clubhouse, which contained an estimated 125 people. A shopping center 
and several schools are nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities identified the victims as pilot Anthony Ronald Deis, 35, his wife, 
Marilyn Aletha Deis, 34, and their three daughters -- Amanda Lynn, 10; Jaclyn 
Dawn, 7, and Kimberly Lisa, 5. All lived in Camrose, about 50 miles southeast 
of Edmonton, the capital of Alberta. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Deis was owner of three Richardson's Jewelry stores in Alberta, and his 
firm was listed as owner of the plane, a twin-engine, six-seat Piper Aerostar 
PA-60. 
</P>
<P>
The Piper Aerostar has had a history of engine-failure accidents during 
takeoffs and can be an unforgiving aircraft in the hands of an inexperienced 
pilot, according to aviation experts. 
</P>
<P>
Aviation Consumer magazine of Greenwich, Conn., said the Piper Aerostar has the 
highest accident rate among similar twin-engine aircraft. From 1977 to 1982, 
Aerostars were involved in 28 fatal accidents, and since 1983, the National 
Transportation Safety Board has recorded 20 fatal accidents involving the 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Piper Aircraft of Vero Beach, Fla., ended production of the Aerostar in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Friends said Anthony Deis had taken up flying in 1976, had well over 1,000 
hours of flying experience and had an advanced instrument rating. They said, 
however, that Deis had flown the Aerostar for less than a year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oil Line Investigated 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Deis' brother, Tom, a police officer in Medicine Hat, Canada, said he 
contacted police in Orange County and was told that a repaired oil line was 
being investigated as a possible cause of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
He said the repair was done at John Wayne Airport on Wednesday. Airport 
officials confirmed that the plane had been serviced during its stay in Orange 
County, but neither federal nor Newport Beach police investigators would 
comment on the possible cause of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Deis said his brother's family had taken off from Camrose on March 22 for 
an Easter vacation to meet friends in Orange County and tour Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
The family's flight plan filed Friday indicated they were returning to Alberta 
by way of Pocatello, Ida. 
</P>
<P>
The plane crashed about 20 yards from the corner of the clubhouse onto a tennis 
court where instructor Bernie Mitton was volleying with his students. 
</P>
<P>
Mitton, 34, of Irvine, who was treated for shock in a hospital emergency room 
but otherwise was unhurt, said one of his students shouted, "There's a plane 
coming!" He said he looked up and saw the plane falling nearly straight down. 
</P>
<P>
"I started to run into a corner, but it seemed like the plane just kept 
following me," Mitton said. "I ran out of the corner, and within seconds it 
crashed and immediately exploded and burst into flames. If I had stayed in that 
corner, I would have been dead. 
</P>
<P>
"As I ran away, it exploded behind me. You could feel the intensity of the 
heat." 
</P>
<P>
The plane hit with such force that only a propeller thrown to the side was 
easily recognizable as part of an airplane. 
</P>
<P>
The remains of the aircraft lay in a heap at the corner of the tennis court, 
where a chain-link boundary fence had been twisted and bent but contained the 
wreckage like a net. 
</P>
<P>
Little of the wreckage littered the adjoining court, where no one had been 
playing at the time of the crash. None of the wreckage was thrown to the other 
end of court where Mitton and his students had retreated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Steering Away 
</P>
<P>
The students, Bob and June Vermes of Irvine, said it appeared the pilot was 
trying to steer the falling plane away from the players. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he saw us and knew that he was coming toward this building," Bob 
Vermes said. "He veered into where he did and missed everybody." 
</P>
<P>
June Vermes said it appeared that "my husband actually was going in one 
direction and the plane was just veering as though the (pilot) was trying to 
avoid us, to miss us." 
</P>
<P>
Lois Jacobs, Ruth Bowman and Lisa Murdy, all of Newport Beach, were playing on 
a court about 50 yards away and saw the plane descending, while Mitton and his 
students scrambled to escape. 
</P>
<P>
The plane burst into "a huge ball of flame, then it exploded," Murdy said. 
</P>
<P>
"The explosion went straight up; it didn't spread out," Bowman said. "That's 
what saved them." 
</P>
<P>
Another of the club's six tennis instructors, Kevin Forbes, was two courts away 
from the crash and said he saw and heard four distinct explosions. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Rich, the National Transportation Safety Board's chief investigator at the 
crash scene, reviewed a recording of the conversation between the pilot and the 
control tower at John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
He said controllers noticed that the plane was not climbing properly and 
radioed the pilot, asking if there were any problems. Several seconds later, 
Deis responded: "We have to come back." Controllers then lost contact with the 
plane, Rich said. 
</P>
<P>
Deis gave no indication that the plane was experiencing mechanical difficulties 
or that he was suffering from any physical ailment or problem, Rich said. Deis' 
voice was calm, clear and had no tone of concern or alarm, he added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Danger Was Apparent 
</P>
<P>
Bill Parker, owner of the tennis club, said the possibility of such a crash had 
been apparent to him for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day I see these planes take off. I can't tell you how many times I've 
thought of what might happen." 
</P>
<P>
Parker said that if the crash had occurred later, all the tennis courts would 
have been full. "We're just incredibly lucky no one on the ground was hurt," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board dispatched half a dozen investigators 
and workers to the scene, who in the afternoon began the laborious task of 
scooping up the remains of the craft and loading it into a trailer that would 
carry it to a warehouse in Carson for inspection. 
</P>
<P>
Rich, the NTSB investigator, said the removal probably would not be completed 
before this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics said they treated about 20 people at the club for shock, but 
considered only four of the cases serious. The Orange County chapter of the 
American Red Cross sent a psychologist, four psychiatric technicians and two 
nurses to the scene to counsel witnesses.

ENGINE FAILURES PLAGUE AIRPLANE

<P>
Piper Aerostars, like the one that crashed near John Wayne Airport on Friday, 
have had a history of engine-failure accidents during takeoffs and can be an 
unforgiving aircraft in the hands of an inexperienced pilot, according to an 
aviation magazine specializing in private aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The Aviation Consumer said the Piper Aerostar has the highest accident rate 
among similar twin-engine small aircraft: with a fatal accident rate of 3.8 
accidents per 100,000 hours of flight. The rate is almost three times higher 
than the median accident rate of similar two-engine planes, according to the 
magazine based in Greenwich, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
"Few aircraft have gone through such dramatic highs and lows as the 
much-traveled Aerostar series. Although a hot performer, the aircraft has 
acquired a disastrous accident record," Aviation Consumer concluded in its 
recently published Used Aircraft Guide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aircraft Called Safe 
</P>
<P>
Piper company officials, however, say the aircraft is safe and has no design 
flaws or other problems that make it more hazardous than other twin-engine 
airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
The plane that crashed in Newport Beach on Friday, killing a Canadian family of 
five, was a twin-engine, six-seat Piper Aerostar PA-60. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Noland, an Aviation Consumer writer who specializes in Aerostar coverage, 
said the magazine conducted a safety study of the aircraft in 1984 and found 
that out of 18 similar twin-engine aircraft, the Aerostar ranked 17th in the 
rate of fatal crashes. 
</P>
<P>
And in the latest issue of the Aviation Consumer's used aircraft guide, the 
aircraft was ranked last among light twin-engine aircraft in safety. The number 
of fatal accidents of Aerostars is "about double that of the typical light twin 
and more than triple the rate of the Beach Baron, a closely comparable 
aircraft," according to the guide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accident Rate 
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, the National Transportation Safety Board has recorded 20 fatal 
accidents involving the aircraft. Matched with the number of hours flown, the 
fatal accident rate has risen to 4.6 per 100,000 hours, according to the 
Columbus Dispatch, an Ohio newspaper that investigated Aerostars after a fatal 
crash there. 
</P>
<P>
The Aerostar was designed by the Ted Smith Aircraft Co. in Santa Maria, Calif., 
in 1964 and first flew 3 years later. The company was sold to Piper Aircraft, 
along with the Aerostar design in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Production of the Aerostar was discontinued in 1985, Piper Aircraft spokesman 
Joe Ponte said. Industry observers said Aerostars and other light aircraft 
models were discontinued about the same period because of a slowdown in sales. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to criticism about the Aerostar, Ponte said that there is "nothing 
unusual about the aircraft" and that those who own the twin-engine planes "rave 
about them." 
</P>
<P>
"And it is not unusually difficult to fly," Ponte said, adding that an Aerostar 
club has branches throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
According to Aviation Consumer's Noland, Aerostars had problems in the 
fuel-delivery system that caused both engines to stop. And changes had to be 
made in its wings to correct stall characteristics that did not meet minimum 
Federal Aviation Administration requirements. 
</P>
<P>
A stall is an abrupt loss of wing lift when the angle of attack -- the angle at 
which the wing meets the air stream -- is too high. Both problems were fixed 
with modifications to existing aircraft after mandates from the FAA, Noland 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cessna's Record 
</P>
<P>
In the survey by Aviation Consumer, the twin-engine plane with the lowest fatal 
accident rate was the Cessna 414. It had a rate of 0.8 fatal accidents for each 
100,000 hours of flight time. The Beech 60 Duke and the Beech 76 Duchess fell 
in the middle of the 18-plane survey with fatal accident rates of 1.3 per 
100,000 hours. 
</P>
<P>
The Cessna 337 Skymaster was ranked 16th in the survey. It had a fatal accident 
rate of 2.5 per 100,000 hours, according to Noland and Aviation Consumer, which 
publishes twice monthly and is supported by its subscribers. The magazine, 
which is highly respected within the industry, carries no advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
In a survey of accidents involving the Aerostar between 1978 and 1982, Noland 
said he found that six of the fatal crashes followed engine failure after 
takeoff. The Beech Baron, a similar twin-engine aircraft, only had two crashes 
involving engine failure during or after takeoffs in the same 5-year period. 
Noland said he found that figure interesting because Barons had been flown 
three times as many hours during that period as were the Aerostars. 
</P>
<P>
Those six engine failures of Aerostars on takeoff during the 5-year period 
ending in 1982 happened at DuBois, Pa.; Hartford, Conn.; Sikeston, Mo.; Aspen, 
Colo.; Roanoke, Va., and Oxford, Conn. All the accidents resulted in deaths, 
Noland said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Aerostar was first produced, several different models known as the 
600 and 700 series have been manufactured. The various models are almost 
impossible to tell apart, but the later ones have more powerful turbo-charged 
engines and pressurized cabins. The later models are capable of flying at 280 
m.p.h., while the earlier 600s have a cruising speed of just over 250 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
San Diego Crash 
</P>
<P>
One of the most spectacular crashes of an Aerostar occurred in San Diego on 
Feb. 17, 1983. The pilot and four passengers died after the plane failed to 
gain altitude after takeoff from Montgomery Field and plunged into a nearby 
parking lot of a busy discount store. 
</P>
<P>
No one was hurt on the ground when the plane skidded across Balboa Avenue, one 
of the busier streets in San Diego, and landed in the parking lot, destroying 
three cars. The plane burst into flames. The pilot was severely burned and died 
the next day in a Utah hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The crash fanned an already simmering controversy over airport safety at 
Montgomery Field, which is surrounded by residences and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Another crash of an Aerostar in Columbus, Ohio, recently killed race driver Al 
Holbert. 
</P>
<P>
After that crash, the Columbus Dispatch quoted Piper spokesman Robert Scott, 
who himself had logged 3,000 hours in Aerostars, as saying the aircraft is very 
easy to fly. 
</P>
<P>
Noland said experienced pilots with a lot of hours in the Aerostar cockpit have 
the ability to deal with emergencies, especially those occurring during 
takeoffs and landings. 
</P>
<P>
But less experienced pilots can "get eaten alive" by the aircraft if they do 
not react quickly enough in emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
"The pilots in fatal Aerostar crashes, although generally of a broad flying 
experience, tended to have few hours in the Aerostar," according to the third 
edition of the Aviation Consumer Used Aircraft Guide. 
</P>
<P>
"Median experience was just 70 hours . . . compared to 300 hours . . . for 
pilots of fatal (crashes of Beech) Barons. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the Aerostar's fatal accidents are related to the design of the 
aircraft in our opinion," the guide said. "Weather played a surprisingly small 
role in Aerostar accidents, in contrast to most other aircraft." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CRASHES AT JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT 
</P>
<P>
Here's a chronology of plane crashes at John Wayne Airport: 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, July 22, 1979: Fullerton man dies when his single-engine plane crashes

mid-air and crashes into the sea 5 miles from Newport Beach. No survivors. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, Aug. 10, 1980: Single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza loses power while 
waiting to land at John Wayne Airport, hits a moving car and crashes in an 
intersection. Pilot, his wife and the four people in the car walk away with 
just several cuts. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
Friday, Sept. 17, 1982: Two private planes, a Cessna-210 single-engine and a 
twin-engine eight-passenger Beechcraft-200, collide over Orange County. One

PIPER AEROSTAR CRASH: HOW IT HAPPENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
1. A twin-engine, six-seat Piper Aerostar PA-60 from Camrose, Canada, took off 
from John Wayne Airport at 8:33 a.m. A witness said the plane was flying 
abnormally low, and an engine was backfiring just after takeoff. Soon 
afterward, smoke came from at least one engine. 
</P>
<P>
2. Air traffic controllers radioed the pilot, who responded by saying, "We have 
to come back." The pilot gave no indication there was any problem, and 
</P>
<P>
controllers received no other transmissions. The plane 
</P>
<P>
started to bank left to return to airport. 
</P>
<P>
3. During the turn, the plane dove steeply toward Eastbluff and the Newport 
Beach 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Club, less than 2 miles from the end of the runway. It then nosed nearly 
straight down and crashed. The family of five aboard the plane was killed as 
the plane exploded in the corner of Court 4, 20 yards from the clubhouse, 
narrowly missing several people. No one on the ground was injured.

TOWN MOURNS DEAD FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CAMROSE, Alberta 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The news first arrived by radio to this community of 14,000 people southeast of 
Edmonton: One of the best-known families in town had been wiped out in one 
tragic instant, ending what was supposed to be a special Easter vacation at 
Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
Don McLaren listened in tearful silence inside his shoe store on the 
community's main street. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a god-awful thing that has happened," he finally said. "He owns the 
store right next to mine." 
</P>
<P>
Not only was McLaren's neighbor, 35-year-old Anthony Deis, dead, but so was 
Deis' entire family -- his wife Marilyn, 34, and their three daughters, Amanda, 
10, Jaclyn, 7, and Kimberly, 5. A private plane with Anthony Deis at the wheel 
had crashed just after takeoff from John Wayne Airport in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Employees at the family's two jewelry stores in town were so distraught that 
manager James Cardiff closed shop and went home. 
</P>
<P>
On the sidewalks outside the shops, passers-by knew of the tragedy and talked 
about it in hushed tones. 
</P>
<P>
At the family's ranch east of town, the housekeeper cried uncontrollably and 
was speechless as she watched television news footage of the burned wreckage of 
her employer's plane. 
</P>
<P>
Blain Fowler, publisher of the town's weekly newspaper, said Deis was a "hard 
worker" who had built up a profitable business. It began when he acquired one 
of his father-in-law's jewelry stores. He then built the business up and was, 
according to a relative, financially comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
"These weren't poor people," Fowler said. "They had a multimillion-dollar 
business going, and Tony would take trips to Antwerp and Buenos Aires just to 
buy diamonds." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Frequent Flights 
</P>
<P>
Fowler said Deis had bought his twin-engine, six-seat Piper Aerostar last year 
to make frequent business and pleasure trips to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Deis' brother, Tom, a sergeant for the Medicine Hat City Police in Alberta, 
said the family had "planned this Easter holiday especially for the kids to go 
and see Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
The occasion also was to be a reunion with Al Porter, a Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police officer who had driven his family to Orange County from Northern 
Manitoba, Deis said. Anthony Deis had been an RCMP officer in British Columbia 
for 2 or 3 years, his brother said. 
</P>
<P>
Porter, his wife and two sons are probably on the road returning home and 
likely are unaware of the crash, Deis said. 
</P>
<P>
After Anthony Deis' father-in-law had set him up in the jewelry business with 
one store in Camrose, Deis had, in recent years, expanded to a second store in 
Camrose and a third in Lloydminster, Alberta, Tom Deis said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Comfortably Off 
</P>
<P>
"They were at a point they didn't have to look back," Tom Deis said. "He would 
have been retired by the age of 40." 
</P>
<P>
He said that as soon as news was broadcast about a Canadian-owned plane 
crashing in Southern California, fear grew among family members that it might 
be the Deis family that had died. Tom Deis said he used his police contacts to 
confirm that the worst had happened. 
</P>
<P>
"My brother was always so careful," Deis said. "He wouldn't touch a drink or 
anything before he was to fly. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose when it's your time, it's your time." 
</P>

BULLET GRAZES CHIN OF ASSEMBLYMAN'S WIFE 
</P>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The wife of Assembly Republican leader Ross Johnson of La Habra was slightly 
injured when a bullet shattered the windows of her van while she was driving 
along Interstate 80 near the state Capitol, his office said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Anne Richards, Johnson's press secretary, said doctors told them the "bullet 
grazed the chin" of Diane Johnson, 47, when she was driving to Davis from 
Sacramento early Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"She had some stitches, but she's fine now and back at work today (Friday)," 
Richards said. "Diane was really not aware of what happened. She thought she 
had been cut by flying glass." 
</P>
<P>
After the incident, she drove on to Davis and called the police. 
</P>
<P>
Richards said the Yolo County Sheriff's Department has no leads in the case, no 
suspects and the bullet has not be found. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if there were any political implications to the incident, she said, "No, 
we think it was just a plinker. They've had a lot of problems in that area with 
people shooting guns, according to the sheriff's office. 
</P>
<P>
"It's rural with fields and all. So we just assume it was a stray bullet of 
some kind." 
</P>
<P>
Diane Johnson was reared in La Habra and met her husband while both were 
students at Cal State Fullerton. He majored in history and she in library 
science, said Phil Miller, an aide in Ross Johnson's district office. 
</P>
<P>
She worked as a librarian at the county library in Santa Ana before Johnson's 
election to the Assembly in 1978, after which the family moved to Sacramento, 
Miller said. She currently is employed as a librarian in the Sacramento area. 
The couple have two teen-age daughters, Molly and Susan. 
</P>
<P>
When his wife was injured, Johnson was in Southern California. He returned to 
Sacramento and was working at his desk in the Capitol on Friday, according to 
Richards. 
</P>
<P>
A Yolo County sheriff's spokesman said the incident could have been a random 
sniping or an errant bullet from a recreational shooter. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said there have been several recent shootings involving 
automobiles in the area. People with guns sometimes use the unpopulated bypass 
next to the freeway for recreational shooting purposes, the spokesman added.

NEAR AIRPORT, RESIDENTS COMPLAIN OF PLANES VEERING OVER THEIR HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Chris and Sheri Dialynas thought they knew what to expect when they bought 
their expansive home in Santa Ana Heights with a spectacular view of the Upper 
Newport Bay, within a stone's throw of John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
But with Friday's crash of a twin-engine Piper Aerostar into the nearby Newport 
Beach Tennis Club, they said their worst fear since moving to their home 1 1/2 
years ago has come true. 
</P>
<P>
"We did research before we moved in about the danger from a crash, rather than 
just the noise problem," 34-year-old Chris Dialynas said Friday. "We knew we 
were on the fringe of the flight path, but we didn't expect to have planes 
flying chaotically over our home. The accident today confirms what we had come 
to expect. The planes have started cutting over our house more and more." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heard From House 
</P>
<P>
Sheri Dialynas said she saw the Piper go down Friday as she was putting her son 
in a stroller for a walk. The plane sputtered loudly and appeared to be only a 
few feet above her roof, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like something was wrong, but I didn't think it was going to crash. 
We're always nervous, and this confirms our fears," the 31-year-old mother 
said. "It doesn't make us feel very good." 
</P>
<P>
Residents who live, work and play around busy John Wayne Airport have long 
complained of its inconvenience and potential danger. But many say the 
situation has worsened in recent years, and they cite what they called 
"erratically" flying aircraft that often seem to veer from normal flight 
patterns to pass over their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Two homeowners groups, in fact, have sued the airport over noise problems and, 
as a result of subsequent negotiations, a limit of 55 flights a day at the 
airport was established in a settlement among the groups, the county and the 
city of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limit to Increase 
</P>
<P>
In 1990, the limit will be raised to 73 flights a day and it is estimated that 
the passenger load will exceed more than 8.4-million people a year. In the year 
2005, new flight limits will be set. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Federal Aviation Administration and John Wayne Airport have 
said they believe the field has one of the lowest accident rates in the United 
States. But there have been a number of midair near-collisions involving planes 
using John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
And several people have been killed or injured in numerous incidents at or near 
the airport in recent years. Planes have crashed and made emergency and 
crash-landings in vacant fields, the ocean and an empty baseball field. One 
plane even struck a moving car on a public street in the vicinity. 
</P>
<P>
There have been 62 accidents on runways, taxiways and aircraft parking areas of 
the airport itself since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The residents said Monday's crash has only heightened existing concerns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thoughts of Moving 
</P>
<P>
Solly Shatzen said he and his wife, Evelyn, have lived in their home on Vista 
Trucha, only a few hundred feet from the crash site, for 16 years. But Friday's 
crash is enough to make the couple consider moving, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Solly Shatzen was home when the plane crashed, and he said the impact "shook 
the house and windows like a 100-ton piece of equipment or something fell to 
the ground." 
</P>
<P>
"The noise was so loud that I was surprised that it was a small plane," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to pack up and leave tomorrow. But yes, it is a consideration. 
The airport was small when we moved here. But the way it's grown, it's much too 
large for an area like this. 
</P>
<P>
"The noise is a problem, but the other thing is, you know that one of them (the 
planes) is going to drop one day." 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn Shatzen, who, like her husband, is in the real estate business, 
described the skies over her home as "like gridlock on the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
"The skies will accommodate only so much," she said. "It's something to walk 
outside your house and see smoke and realize you're 100 feet from it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Courts Usually Full 
</P>
<P>
Pat Bates, 52, who lives off Vista Prada, was one of scores of residents who 
stopped by the tennis club to try to glimpse some of the wreckage from the 
crash. The sidewalk leading to the courts was blocked off, however, and 
onlookers huddled near the entrance, trying to peer through gaps in the green 
walls surrounding the tennis courts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame. It's heartbreaking, and it gives me the chills talking about 
it," Bates said. "We've all been concerned about the flight path the planes 
have been taking over the houses. We've complained, signed petitions, but 
nothing happens." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Bates, who said she uses the pool at the tennis club frequently, said it 
was fortunate the accident did not claim more lives. "The courts are usually 
full all the time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'You Always Think of That' 
</P>
<P>
Syd Ball of Newport Beach, who had been playing tennis on the court behind the 
crash site, said players at the club are well aware of the potential for such a 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
"You always think of that," said Ball, gazing upward. "It's like getting hit in 
a car, there's so bloody many of them (planes) up there." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Lappe, who has lived in a home on Vista Roma for several years, was one 
of the few residents who said the crash did not heighten her fears. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tragic thing to happen, but it doesn't really frighten me," she said. 
"I think the chances (of a plane crashing) are far less than (car crashes) on 
the freeway. I just don't think we can fear everything."

MAN JAILED AS 'CAREER CRIMINAL' IS FREE; 
</P>
<P>
NUMBER OF PEOPLE RALLIED TO SUPPORT OF COUNTY RESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Kevin J. Sherbondy, a San Clemente resident who drew widespread support in his 
appeal of an "unjustly harsh" 15-year sentence for having an antique gun while 
on probation, is a free man once more. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the first things I did was come home, turn on my stereo and have a 
drink of beer," said Sherbondy, 25, a handsome, dark-haired ex-surfer who was 
prosecuted as California's first "career criminal." 
</P>
<P>
Sherbondy was released Thursday after spending about 2 1/2 years in federal 
prison and nearly a week after a federal judge placed him on 5 years' 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Left With Grandparents 
</P>
<P>
Sherbondy left the Metropolitan Federal Detention Center in Los Angeles in a 
new pin-striped suit and drove home with Art and Ethel Sherbondy of San 
Clemente, the grandparents who raised him. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got to the sidewalk, I started walking faster and faster, just in case 
they found something to keep me in there," he said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinarily, a conviction for gun possession would not bring a mandatory, 
15-year federal prison sentence. But U.S. District Judge Harry L. Hupp imposed 
the sentence 2 years ago after federal prosecutors in Los Angeles pointed out 
that Sherbondy was eligible for the 15-year sentence -- without parole -- under 
a revised 1986 federal-sentencing law that became effective on the day of his 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to keep criminals off the streets, Congress passed legislation 
requiring a minimum 15-year term for any person possessing a firearm who 
previously had been convicted of three violent crimes or three serious drug 
offenses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Convicted 3 Times 
</P>
<P>
Sherbondy, who had been convicted three times, twice for armed robbery and once 
for threatening a witness, was prosecuted under the statute. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not a career criminal. He's only 23 years old (at the time of his 1986 
conviction). There's no way he could be a career criminal," said Dannie M. 
Martin, a fellow inmate in the federal prison at Lompoc, in a segment of the 
television program "Evening Magazine," which aired March 17. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it was Martin, a convicted bank robber, that Sherbondy now credits 
with helping him win his freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, who heard about Sherbondy's case, introduced himself in prison and 
wrote a convincing article about Sherbondy's plight that was published more 
than a year ago in the San Francisco Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
"After the article was published, I started getting 15 letters a day from 
people wanting to say hello or help me," Sherbondy said. 
</P>
<P>
Martin's story stirred interest among some Bay Area residents who said that 
they did not believe in sending a young man to jail for 15 years for owning an 
antique gun. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Began an Action Fund 
</P>
<P>
One of those residents, Edward LeClair, began a Sherbondy Action Assn. that 
attracted a list of prominent people, including several judges, and began 
raising money for an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"Ironically, a lot of my support has been from people in the Bay Area. I didn't 
even get any mail from anybody from Orange County," Sherbondy said. 
</P>
<P>
With $10,000, the association hired Dennis P. Riordan, a prominent San 
Francisco attorney who called the 15-year sentence "a terrible injustice." 
</P>
<P>
One of three brothers, Sherbondy said his life was always a struggle. He never 
knew his father, and his mother died when he was 8. He refers to his 
grandparents who raised him as Mom and Dad. 
</P>
<P>
When Sherbondy was 19, he was convicted of selling cocaine and robbing a 
suspected drug dealer at gunpoint. He was placed on probation, but less than a 
month later he robbed another suspected drug dealer at gunpoint and received a 
6-year prison sentence. He also was found guilty in 1984 of possessing a weapon 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Then in August, 1986, he was charged with trying to intimidate a witness in an 
acquaintance's drug case and pleaded guilty in exchange for probation. 
</P>
<P>
His new troubles began, according to his attorneys, when he split up with his 
girlfriend. She called the police soon afterward, telling them that he was on 
probation and informing them about a gun he kept on his bedpost. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities searched the condominium where he was living and found the gun Nov. 
17, 1986. That was the day that the new federal "career criminal" law took 
effect.

Rather 'Forget It' 
</P>
<P>
Of the ex-girlfriend who turned him in to authorities and told them about the 
gun, Sherbondy now says: "I believe that thinking about her is just wasteful 
energy. It's too negative. I'd just as soon forget it." 
</P>
<P>
But it's too soon to consider future plans, he said. The former Saddleback 
College student who made the dean's honor list said he will spend the next few 
weeks "kind of taking it easy." 
</P>
<P>
News of his release brought happy smiles to the people in the office of 
Huntington Beach attorney Barry A. Bisson, who also fought for Sherbondy's 
freedom, according to Michele Monroe, Bisson's legal assistant. 
</P>
<P>
"Out of many criminal appeals that I've seen here in this office, only three 
that I know of have cried out for justice. And of the three, only Mr. 
Sherbondy's was successful," Monroe said.

GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI: ANGELS COUNT THEIR BLESSINGS WITH ABBOTT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gene Wojciechowski

<TEXT>
<P>
There are probably a dozen good reasons why Jim Abbott shouldn't be on the 
Angels opening-day roster: Too young . . . too precious . . . too soon . . . 
too risky . . . too distracting . . . too nice . . . too vulnerable . . . too 
storybook . . . too desperate . . .too suspect . . . too unpolished . . . too 
convenient. 
</P>
<P>
Now for a retort: Too bad. 
</P>
<P>
After all, who cares about 12 good reasons calling for Abbott's departure to 
the minors when there is one great reason why he belongs in the majors? 
</P>
<P>
Quite simply, Abbott is ready. 
</P>
<P>
You remain skeptical, don't you? You wonder how Abbott, who looks as if he hung 
out at the campus malt shop, could possibly be ready to tour the American 
League. You notice that he is polite, thoughtful and sincere -- qualities 
usually seen in glee club members, not major league pitchers. So accommodating 
is Abbott that you don't know whether to laugh or frisk him for merit badges. 
</P>
<P>
You're also a tiny bit curious why Abbott, just 21, doesn't need a little 
seasoning, a little visit to the minors before he dons an Angel uniform. Since 
when does a guy get to go directly to the Big A before spending some time at 
double-A? 
</P>
<P>
And with all due respect, you say, the kid, bless his heart, was born with only 
one good hand. What happens if someone bunts? What about pickoff moves? And are 
you sure he's OK out there? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, well, Angel Manager Doug Rader had his doubts, too. Then Abbott started 
conducting these real quiet batting practices in Mesa. Simon and Garfunkel 
would have been proud, what with all the sounds of silence. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how it went: Abbott threw. Angel hitters swung. Angel hitters missed. 
</P>
<P>
Then Abbott made an appearance against the San Diego Padres' B-team in gusty, 
chilly Yuma . . . and mowed down the junior varsity like a Briggs and Stratton. 
</P>
<P>
Then he struck out Oakland Athletics he-man Jose Canseco in front of a packed 
house in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Then he struck out Padre outfielder Tony Gwynn, last season's National League 
batting champion, in front of a packed house in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Then he rested. 
</P>
<P>
Mind you, Abbott isn't the answer to Angel pitching woes, but he's a start. 
Better yet, he's a starter, which is nice, considering the state of the Angel 
rotation. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, I'm no expert, but Gwynn is. And it was Gwynn, with the count 1-2, who 
whiffed on a bodacious Abbott slider this week in exhibition play. If you're 
keeping a total -- and Gwynn was -- it was the outfielder's first strikeout of 
the spring. Sixty at-bats. One -- count 'em, one -- strikeout. 
</P>
<P>
"His ball moves a lot, that's a good sign," Gwynn said later. "He doesn't just 
throw it hard and lay it in there." 
</P>
<P>
Still unconvinced? So was Angel vice president Mike Port, who, like everyone 
else, expected Abbott to start the season in Midland. So was Angel pitching 
coach Marcel Lachemann, a man so thorough and careful he probably reads bottle 
cap instructions. 
</P>
<P>
But to the credit of the Angel bosses, they kept an open mind about Abbott. 
Abbott thanked them by pitching his way onto the team and into the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
This is no ordinary No. 1 free agent draft choice we're talking about here. 
Abbott is special, and not just because of a birth defect. He is one of the 
guys and, at the same time, one in a million. 
</P>
<P>
Sure he's young, but shortstop Gary Sheffield and outfielder Ken Griffey Jr., 
are younger -- and they'll begin the seasons as starters for the Milwaukee 
Brewers and Seattle Mariners, respectively. Funny, but no one is pacing the 
halls over their birth dates. 
</P>
<P>
But they played in the minors, you say. 
</P>
<P>
So what? Abbott played in Havana . . . in front of Fidel. He played in Seoul 
and has an Olympic gold medal to prove it. He played in the World Baseball 
Championships in Italy. And I'll bet he endured more, traveled more miles, 
consented to more interviews than Sheffield and Griffey combined last year. 
</P>
<P>
Too young? Too soon? Too nice? Too unpolished? As Rader might say, "Gimme a 
break." The only thing Abbott was guilty of this spring was being too good. 
</P>
<P>
And while we're at it, let's dispose of several other concerns, beginning with 
too distracting. Abbott might be a curiosity piece right now, but he isn't a 
sideshow. Watch him pitch for two minutes and you forget about his handicap and 
instead, remember his slider or cut fastball. He may have only one good hand, 
but, ah, is it ever attached to an absolutely golden left arm. 
</P>
<P>
As for too vulnerable -- forget it. Abbott's resolve is harder than carbon. He 
went from no-shot to long shot to starter in less than six weeks. That's not 
being vulnerable; it's being successful. 
</P>
<P>
He had help, of course. Dan Petry is struggling, as is Kirk McCaskill. Chuck 
Finley is unpredictable. When the opportunity presented itself, Abbott simply 
responded. In fact, if you asked Angel officials to rank their pitchers by 
talent, Abbott might finish as high as fifth, so questionable is the rotation 
and bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
Too precious? Too risky? Too convenient? Let me get this straight: the Angels 
drafted him first in 1988. They love his 90 m.p.h. fastball, his hard slider. 
So what's wrong with admitting he's gifted enough to pitch in the majors right 
now? And what's the risk? A bruised ego if he loses a few? 
</P>
<P>
One other point: What's the alternative? If not Abbott in the rotation, who 
then? Convenience has little to do with it. The Angels need him and Abbott has 
earned the chance. 
</P>
<P>
Which brings us to too desperate. Port may have his debatable methods, but he 
isn't a fool. You think Port would OK Abbott's selection to the Angel roster 
without first considering every possible angle? No way. 
</P>
<P>
And for those who think the whole thing is a publicity stunt, think again. 
Sure, the Angels' image needs a wax and buff job after last season, but that 
wasn't why they drafted Abbott. After all, a heartwarming story only goes so 
far. 
</P>
<P>
And remember that the Angels drew more than two million fans last season 
without Abbott. Abbott likely will nudge the figures upward, but only if he 
pitches well enough to stay for the season. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen good reasons why he doesn't belong, eh? Count again; your math is way 
off.

KENNEDY MAKES AN IMPRESSION ON LA QUINTA WITH 6-0 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kennedy High School scored six runs in the seventh inning Friday to stun host 
La Quinta, 6-0, stopping the Aztecs' unbeaten streak at 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy (10-3, 2-0) had six hits in the inning, including a two-run homer by 
designated hitter Ernie Franco. Pete Montera (5-0) pitched his third shutout of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
It was also the first victory in six games for Kennedy Coach Chris Pasqual 
against perennial power La Quinta. La Quinta (11-3-1, 1-1) has dominated play 
in the Garden Grove League for most of Coach Dave Demarest's 16 seasons, but it 
appears Kennedy might have the talent to unseat La Quinta this season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good feeling to beat La Quinta because Dave runs such a good program," 
Pasqual said. "I can remember the first time we played La Quinta four years ago 
and lost, 19-3. Our program has come a long way since then." 
</P>
<P>
Montera allowed three hits and struck out 12, including six in a row from the 
first to third innings. He mixed off-speed pitches inside with a slider that 
broke away. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured if I could keep throwing strikes, our hitters would come around 
eventually," said Montera, who allowed only one walk. "I felt good to beat the 
No. 1 guys, it was about time." 
</P>
<P>
Montera and La Quinta starter Jon Korzen were locked in a pitching duel for 
five innings before Korzen left the game with one out in the sixth after 
completing his allotted 70 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
"He had tendinitis in his shoulder, so we put a limit on his pitches," Demarest 
said. "I was hoping to get five innings out of him, but he did a good job of 
keeping us even until the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a good ballclub. Montera is a fine pitcher and they hit the ball. All 
they have to do is start believing in themselves and then they can beat 
anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy made believers out of La Quinta in the seventh. Consecutive singles by 
catcher Scott Wood, pinch-hitter Tom Deep and third baseman Paul Ruark off 
reliever Corey Giuliano (6-2) broke the tie. 
</P>
<P>
Franco's homer, a long drive over the left-center-field fence, was his third of 
the week and ended an afternoon of frustration. He had struck out in his three 
previous at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta had beaten Kennedy, 7-1, last week in the championship game of 
Anaheim Lions tournament, and the Aztecs had them frustrated early Friday by 
picking off three runners on first. 
</P>
<P>
In other Garden Grove League games: 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove 3, Bolsa Grande 2 -- Garden Grove (4-5-1, 1-1) scored three runs 
in the bottom of the third, two on a homer by Rob Wursthorn. Shawn Zingali 
(1-2) pitched a five-hitter, striking out four. Brian Nuez had a solo home run 
for Bolsa Grande (6-5, 0-2). 
</P>
<P>
Pacifica 6, Los Amigos 3 -- Pacifica (2-7, 2-0) scored four unearned runs, as 
Los Amigos made five errors at Los Amigos. Bobby Anderson and Kevin Ashworth 
each drove in runs for Pacifica. Al Talavera had two RBIs for Los Amigos (4-9, 
1-1). 
</P>
<P>
Santiago 8, Rancho Alamitos 2 -- Phil Gonzales (1-1) pitched a six-hitter for 
Santiago (4-6-1, 1-1).

BOTTLED WATER IS TAKEN OFF STORE SHELVES; 
</P>
<P>
NIAGARA BRAND FROM IRVINE PLANT CHECKED FOR UNSAFE CHEMICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
As many as 2,000 bottles of drinking water from an Irvine-based bottled-water 
company were removed from store shelves as company and state health officials 
continued Friday to test the product for potentially lethal levels of sodium 
fluoride, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Niagara Drinking Water Inc. recalled all of its 2 1/2-gallon bottles from about 
half a dozen stores in San Bernardino and Riverside counties and Las Vegas 
after the state Department of Health Services issued a warning Thursday that 
the water might be dangerously contaminated with sodium fluoride, state and 
company spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
State Health Director Kenneth W. Kizer had issued a warning to consumers not to 
drink Niagara-brand water in 2 1/2-gallon plastic containers after tests found 
the odorless and colorless chemical present in potentially lethal amounts in 
two bottles sold on March 2 and 3 at the Food 4 Less market in Moreno Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Members of one family that had purchased the water suffered upset stomachs, 
according to Frank Nava, chief of field operations in the Department of Health 
Service's food and drug unit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Became Ill 
</P>
<P>
"The other (family) actually threw up the water right away within minutes of 
having ingested it," he said. "The last word that we got is that they are 
fine." 
</P>
<P>
The source of the contamination was unknown, and testing was expected to 
continue until early next week. 
</P>
<P>
Only the 2 1/2-gallon bottles of Niagara water sold through retail outlets were 
recalled. The bulk of Niagara's water is sold in larger containers and 
delivered directly to homes, Diane Peykoff, Niagara's secretary-treasurer, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, we think it's an isolated case, but we are continuing to take 
additional samples and (are) waiting for the phone to ring and see if we get 
any additional illnesses," Nava said. 
</P>
<P>
"Any testing we provide for the remaining water will be done at a very fast 
pace," he added. "We're working to do that so they can get their product back 
on the shelf right away." 
</P>
<P>
Health officials are also sampling other brands stocked at the Moreno Valley 
store "as a precautionary measure," Nava said. The possibility of sabotage has 
not been ruled out, although Nava stressed that there is no evidence to 
indicate the contamination was deliberate. 
</P>
<P>
Sodium fluoride is sometimes added to drinking water to help prevent tooth 
decay. But Nava said in those cases, the chemical amounts to only 1 or 2 parts 
per million. The two confiscated bottles contained fluoride up to 450 p.p.m., 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"A baby would have to drink 16 ounces of it to be lethal," Nava said. "An adult 
would have to drink eight to 10 eight-ounce glasses." 
</P>
<P>
But before that is likely to happen, the water would cause vomiting, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kizer advised anyone who has consumed the water and believes that he or she has 
become ill to consult a physician and notify a county health department. 
</P>
<P>
Peykoff said she is confident that the water was not contaminated at the 
company's production plant. 
</P>
<P>
"I do feel comfortable in saying it (the contamination) did not come from our 
facility," she said. "We have tested every bottle that we have recalled and 
will continue to." 
</P>
<P>
Niagara's 2 1/2-gallon bottles do not normally contain the company's 
fluoridated water, Peykoff said. Fluoridated water sold by Niagara is processed 
in a separate room at the company's Irvine plant and is packaged only in 
5-gallon bottles, she added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Highly Treated 
</P>
<P>
Bottled drinking water is as likely to come from the tap of a municipal water 
system as from wells and springs, but it is so highly treated that it is 
virtually unrecognizable, spokesmen for bottled water companies said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Except for mountain spring water, which is simply filtered and sterilized, 
bottled-water producers use reverse osmosis and deionization to remove all 
minerals and other materials from the water. They then add small quantities of 
food-grade minerals to give it taste, treat it with ozone to kill 
microorganisms and bottle it. 
</P>
<P>
Some bottlers also add fluoride to help prevent tooth decay. That addition must 
be noted on the label, and it is usually highlighted because the fluoride is a 
selling point.

PROBLEMS ENGULF STAFF AND PATIENTS AS ANAHEIM HEALTH-CARE CLINIC CLOSES FOR 
GOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Last week, workers at the General Med clinic in Anaheim had to call six 
ambulances before they could get one that would agree to pick up 66-year-old 
William Shelly of Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Shelly, a retired Hughes Aircraft Co. employee, was experiencing problems 
related to a chronic heart condition. But word had spread within health-care 
circles that General Med was being shut down, and five ambulance operators in a 
row refused to take him to a hospital, according to Dr. Stanley Ermshar, Gen 
Med's chief of medicine. 
</P>
<P>
"Good care is critical for him," Ermshar said. And with future health coverage 
uncertain, "he's one classic example that could fall through the cracks and 
become a medical disaster." 
</P>
<P>
Shelly's experience was one of many cited Friday as the financially troubled 
health maintenance organization closed for good. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tell of Difficulties 
</P>
<P>
Several Gen Med employees at the Anaheim clinic related tales of difficulties 
they had encountered in providing care during the 3 weeks since the closing was 
announced. And a number of doctors, nurses and Gen Med members who gathered at 
the facility to draw attention to their concerns raised questions about the 
future of members' health care. 
</P>
<P>
On March 7, Maxicare Health Plans Inc. announced the closing of its 
Orange-based Family Health Services Inc. subsidiary, known in Orange County as 
Gen Med. Although it was owned by Maxicare, Gen Med was a separate health 
maintenance organization that operated independently of the HMO clinics 
affiliated with Maxicare. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare, which is experiencing severe financial problems of its own, said that 
Gen Med members will be able to receive care until May 1 at clinics that are 
part of Maxicare's existing network. 
</P>
<P>
The closing left 55,000 Gen Med members looking elsewhere for medical coverage. 
For most, it has meant the inconvenience of signing up for a new health plan 
offered by their employers. For a few who weren't covered under employer plans 
and had pre-existing medical conditions that other insurance companies wouldn't 
cover, it has meant either joining the troubled Maxicare network or going 
without medical coverage altogether. 
</P>
<P>
In a March 7 letter, Los Angeles-based Maxicare said that Gen Med members not 
covered by a group plan had until March 25 to convert to Maxicare coverage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worries About Treatment 
</P>
<P>
Blayne Perenteau, a Gen Med member who last week suffered a ruptured appendix, 
said he isn't sure where he'll go for post-operative care. He said he worries 
about the treatment he will receive at Maxicare clinics from doctors he has 
never met. And he said he is concerned that Maxicare will not honor his request 
for coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"They said March 7 they'd insure me," Perenteau said. "Now they filed 
bankruptcy. Based on what I've seen, I'm not too confident of what's to come." 
</P>
<P>
On March 16, Maxicare sought protection from its creditors in a Chapter 11 
bankruptcy filing that allows the company to continue operating under court 
supervision while seeking to reorganize. But analysts have raised serious 
questions about the company's ability to stay in business. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim resident Leon Randalls, a Gen Med member who has lung cancer, said he 
has called Maxicare's offices to see if he will be covered by Maxicare, but 
"they say they can't tell us for sure." 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare spokeswoman Tobi Nyberg said Friday that individual plan members who 
met the March 25 deadline will be covered under Maxicare plans. She added that 
coverage will be provided, even though "we had no legal obligation to take 
those people." Nyberg said that about 300 members were covered under 
individual, or non-group, policies instead of group plans offered by employers. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance industry analysts said that people who suffer from a chronic illness, 
such as Perenteau and Randalls, are not going to be accepted by other insurance 
companies, which carefully screen applicants. 
</P>
<P>
Some members said that even if Maxicare accepts them, they are concerned that 
the company's troubles might affect the care they receive. And they said they 
are concerned that their medical records might never reach their new doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors, nurses and staff members said problems with outside suppliers have 
increased in the days since Maxicare announced its intention to close Gen Med. 
They said the problem has become even more severe since the bankruptcy petition 
was filed. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors said that some ambulance services, oxygen companies and other medical 
suppliers have refused to provide requested goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. David Garcia, an internist at the Anaheim center, said that some 
health-care suppliers, including an Anaheim radiologist, have become "Good 
Samaritans" by taking Gen Med members without assurances that they'll be paid. 
</P>
<P>
Nyberg said that cases of supplier service refusal have been scattered and have 
been dealt with by the company. She also said that Maxicare will continue to 
meet its obligations to pay health-care providers. 
</P>
<P>
Although several dozen employees will stay with the company for the next couple 
of months for administrative duties, most of Gen Med's 500 employees, including 
about 300 in Orange County, received their final paycheck Friday. And many got 
much less than they expected. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors and nurses were told March 7 that they would receive severance pay as 
outlined in their contracts. But Maxicare said the bankruptcy filing prohibited 
it from honoring that commitment. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare said it received approval from the bankruptcy court to pay $2,000 to 
each employee for all wages, benefits and business expenses owed at the time of 
the bankruptcy filing. Nyberg said the $2,000 would not cover the claims of 
many employees. In addition, she said, vacation time accrued before Dec. 16 
will not be paid. 
</P>
<P>
Employees said they expect to stand in line with other creditors if they want 
payment. 
</P>
<P>
Gen Med workers, many of whom have taken other jobs, also have had to find new 
insurance coverage for themselves. For Dr. Anne Mazer, a Gen Med employee who 
is six-months pregnant, the insurance plan at her new company won't cover the 
medical expenses of her childbirth because it is a pre-existing condition. She 
said she will be able to pay about $750 in premiums to Maxicare to continue 
coverage with the company. 
</P>
<P>
"When you plan a baby, you don't plan on switching jobs and insurance companies 
after 6 months. I have no choice." 
</P>
<P>
Gen Med's last day was more confusing than anticipated because the company's 
phone system was prematurely shut down. Nyberg said Pacific Bell had been 
instructed to cut phone service at 5 p.m. Instead phone service had already 
been disconnected Friday morning. She said the phone company was working to 
restore the lines. 
</P>
<P>
"We were running out and calling patients on the pay phone," Garcia said. "It 
was very bad. . . . But it was appropriate."

INSPIRATION POINT GETS ARTY NEW LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sunbathers who gaze out to sea from the Corona del Mar coastal bluff called 
Inspiration Point found their turf invaded by a small crowd of people in 
citified dress Thursday afternoon. The occasion was the official dedication of 
Newport Beach's first Art in Public Places project. 
</P>
<P>
Formerly run-down and erosion-prone, the lookout point on Ocean Boulevard 
between Narcissus and Orchid streets was refurbished by Cunningham Design Inc. 
of Santa Barbara with artists Helen Mayer Harrison, Newton Harrison, Marcello 
Petrocelli and Paul Hobson. They were the co-winners of a 1987 design 
competition sponsored by the city's Arts Commission and the Parks, Beaches and 
Recreation Department. 
</P>
<P>
Called "Disappearing Path," the $310,300 project is nothing if not low-key. 
Replacing the former asphalt pathway, a steep, undulating sunken concrete 
walkway leads down from street level to a broad plateau and continues to the 
beach level below. The plateau offers sunbathers who want to linger a choice of 
concrete steps, boulders and simple-but-stylish teakwood benches on which to 
perch. 
</P>
<P>
Stripped of its scrubby tangle of ice plant (and also, inadvertently, of some 
native plants that should have remained on the site) the coastal bluff is now 
virtually bare. The site has been seeded with grass as a temporary 
erosion-control measure, but next winter a plant specialist will revegetate the 
area with coastal sagebrush, California buckwheat, black sage, lemonade berry 
and other native species. 
</P>
<P>
This replanting scheme, which will add texture and color as well as erosion 
control, is a key part of the project. Lloyd Dalton, a design engineer with the 
Newport Beach Public Works Department, explained that the delay in replanting 
is partly due to the fact that some of the plant materials have to be 
propagated from seeds rather than from cuttings, and most of the plants don't 
go to seed until August. 
</P>
<P>
The original "Disappearing Path" plan, budgeted by Cunningham Design at 
$402,770, would also have provided for the restructuring of the upper area of 
the site, adjacent to the road. This level was to have been lowered several 
feet and enhanced with seating and a fountain, all constructed with boulders. 
</P>
<P>
But the city's original budget for the project was only $152,661, so the design 
had to be scaled down. (The final costs for the walkway and landscaping were 
$202,800; the other $107,500 paid for restoration of the badly eroded bluff by 
the Public Works Department. Additional money for the project came from various 
Parks, Beaches and Recreation Department accounts.) 
</P>
<P>
Other less-visible parts of the project include a drip-irrigation system, the 
relocation of a sewer that runs under the site and the riprap, or grouted rock, 
that protects the end of the pathway from being washed out during storms. 
</P>
<P>
A chain-link fence at street level is a temporary device that will be removed 
as soon as the replanting is completed. But the temporary chain-link fence at 
the edge of the middle platform will be replaced this summer by a 42-inch-high 
safety railing because of potential liability problems. 
</P>
<P>
For maximum visibility and good looks, Cunningham Design would like to see 
stanchions supporting a railing made of horizontal stainless-steel cables 
("inspired by the lifeline on a yacht," according to principal partner Bob 
Cunningham). Dalton is concerned that such a design would cost too much, 
however, and a final decision on the design has not yet been made. The steep 
grade of the "disappearing path" -- which caused a few visitors to grumble 
several days ago -- was unchanged from that of the original trail, Dalton said. 
</P>
<P>
Landscape architect David Black, another Cunningham Design partner, called the 
project "very simple, very straightforward," with "a certain elegance of the 
forms." He said the architect-artist team "articulated the path in a way we 
felt was very artistic in terms of the curves. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously we had some constraints in budget, but we tried to do something 
functional yet creative. . . . I think we handled that in a sort of unobtrusive 
yet elegant way. They (the city) didn't want something outrageous or 
avant-garde."

PAUL STANLEY CUTS HIS SHOW DOWN TO SIZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUNCAN STRAUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The idea sounded simple enough: Kiss singer-guitarist Paul Stanley performing 
some solo shows in relatively smaller venues. The one Thursday at Anaheim's 
Celebrity Theatre suggested that these concerts will be every bit as tuneful 
(not very) and thoughtful (not very) as expected. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Stanley has been living down to expectations for years: The first 
Kiss record surfaced 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But at least these shows (he's at the Palace in Hollywood on Tuesday) aren't 
part of a shrewd, larger game plan to appeal to the baser instincts of 
adolescents and separate them from their record-buying dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Stanley is between Kiss albums and hasn't released a solo LP in a 
decade, so Thursday's performance really did seem like he wanted to play some 
smaller places just for fun. And backed by a quartet of hard-rock hotshots 
(including slick-domed lead guitarist Bob Kulick, brother of Kiss fret-grinder 
Bruce), Stanley raced through a rawking grab bag of Kiss songs, selections from 
that solo LP, an unrecorded tune, even a request or two. 
</P>
<P>
This anything-goes musical approach also enabled Stanley to cover considerable 
ground thematically, from the usual Kiss crotch-rock treatises to more tender, 
shattered-romance sagas -- like an accelerated version of "Tears Are Falling" 
-- to things in between (the unrecorded number discussed a couple who had a 
nice little relationship -- until it became a triangle). 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the quartet's full, forceful instrumental and vocal support, this all 
made for an energetic blast of rock 'n' roar, and it almost didn't matter that 
Stanley's voice is shot. 
</P>
<P>
Vocally, however, he is a gifted impressionist: A few times Thursday, he did 
things with his voice that sounded exactly like a car that won't start on a 
cold morning. 
</P>
<P>
Opening the show was D'Molls, a Los Angeles quartet whose garb, manner and 
music place them in that awkward category of Bands That May Have Thought 
"Spinal Tap" Was a Documentary. 
</P>
<P>
These guys achieved a nice Thin Lizzy-ish twin-guitar sound a few times, but at 
this point, most of their songs are merely rollicking rifforama with some 
pretty shaky lyrics -- even for the head-banging genre.

Charles Desmarais is the new director of the Laguna Art Museum. He is off to an 
excellent (start), most recently obtaining for the museum the David Park 
exhibition. This is a show that comes from the Whitney Museum of American Art 
in New York, and contains many works from an 11-year period of the Bay-area 
figurative painter. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Art Museum does so much for Orange County's cultural life. It is a 
pity that too few of the residents of Orange County support the museum. With 
membership one receives free entry to the museum, so by joining now, one can 
support the museum and be able to see the David Park exhibition. It closes May 
7. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Art Museum needs the funds to continue to perform its mission. Your 
readers should support this vital institution, and enjoy the privileges of 
membership by experiencing these important exhibitions.

ON THE WATERFRONT: NEWPORT DUNES GETTING SPRUCED UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Don't let the demolition of Newport Dunes send you into a panic. The 
1950s-style boat and trailer park isn't dead, it's just being reborn. 
</P>
<P>
After 10 years of planning and negotiating to win city, county and state 
approvals, renovation has finally begun on the 75-acre waterfront park, built 
in 1958 near Pacific Coast Highway in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the construction project is completed in a couple of years, the 
peeling paint and worn structures of old Newport Dunes will be replaced by a 
hotel, a 430-slip marina, a 444-space RV park, 400 dry-storage spaces for 
trailer boats, a swimming pool and an improved launch ramp. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase -- which includes everything but the hotel and marina -- should 
be completed by July 4, according to Lawrence H. Buxton, president of Courton 
&amp; Associates, the Newport Beach firm that designed the project. But the 
heavily used boat-launch ramp -- the only public launching ramp between Dana 
Point and Sunset Beach -- should reopen next month. 
</P>
<P>
"Newport Dunes provides a real service to the boating community," Buxton says. 
"It provides storage and launching. That's why (that phase) is getting finished 
first." 
</P>
<P>
Buxton, who has been working on the project since 1981, has a stack of 
documents more that a foot high that chronicles the history of the development, 
which sits on state tidelands and is owned by Orange County and located in 
Newport Beach. He successfully steered the development through dozens of local, 
state and federal agencies that had to give their approval. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really a complicated project," Buxton says. "We finally got concept 
approval in 1984 and then got the plans approved in 1988." 
</P>
<P>
Those plans call for 444 modern RV spaces with sewer and electrical hookups, 
instead of the Dunes' original 160 spaces, many of which had no services at 
all. The new RV park also will have cable-access television, laundry rooms and 
a shopping village, including a small grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is that people don't have to leave the area," Buxton says. "All 
services are provided on site." 
</P>
<P>
For beach visitors, there will be a parking lot that can accommodate 650 
vehicles. "The beach is very popular and is open to the public. For families, 
it is a nice, safe swimming beach," Buxton says. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase is expected to cost about $15 million, according to Buxton. At 
least $1 million of that will be spent on landscaping, which will make 
extensive use of mature trees, especially in the campgrounds. By the time the 
entire project, including hotel and marina, is completed, final cost will be 
about $45 million, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Dunes is owned and operated by the Evans Corp., which also owns the 
Bahia and the Catamaran hotels in San Diego. The corporation holds a 50-year 
lease on the county-owned land. 
</P>
<P>
The corporation also purchased the lease on the restaurant site, formerly 
occupied my Anthony's restaurant, which was torn down about 2 months ago. A new 
15,000-square-foot restaurant will be built on the site. 
</P>
<P>
The redesigned Newport Dunes will be built around the existing swimming lagoon, 
which will be ringed by a boardwalk connected to a pedestrian bridge that will 
stretch across the mouth of the lagoon. The 25-acre swimming area will have its 
own lifeguard station, a snack shop and recreation room. There will be 
restrooms and picnic tables along the beach surrounding the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
The outer perimeter will feature bike trails that will connect with the trails 
in Upper Newport bay. "That means you can ride to the beach without having to 
ride down Pacific Coast Highway or Jamboree Road," Buxton says. From the bike 
path in Upper Newport Bay, bicyclists could pedal through the Dunes and come 
out at the stoplight at Pacific Coast Highway and Bayside Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The redesigned Dunes also will feature a marine center with a boat-repair 
business, and a coffee shop and patio overlooking the boat-launching ramp, 
according to Buxton. The improved ramp will have two docks in the center to 
make it easier to launch boats, he says. 
</P>
<P>
When construction began in February, the nearly 400 boats stored at the Dunes 
were moved to the other side of the property for storage during the renovation. 
Near the relocated boats are a few die-hard campers who seem undisturbed by the 
half-dozen earth-moving machines working a short distance down the beach. The 
old asphalt parking lot has been dug up, crushed into a gravel-like consistency 
and piled high on the spot where the campgrounds used to be. The mountain of 
crushed asphalt will be reused in the project, according to Buxton. 
</P>
<P>

trouble-shoot common problems found in diesel engines will be offered beginning

PHOTOGRAPHY: HERE'S HOW TO SUCCESSFULLY SHOOT STRIKING SILHOUETTES -- IT'S 
SURPRISINGLY SIMPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Shooting a silhouette correctly can give you a striking picture -- especially 
in color. But too often, a silhouette is little more than a mistake -- the 
flash doesn't go off, the subject is backlighted or you forgot to correctly 
adjust your film speed. 
</P>
<P>
The first thing you should determine is what you are trying to accomplish. Is 
your silhouette the dominant part of the photograph or a small element giving 
an added dimension or character? 
</P>
<P>
A silhouette brings the image down to its simplest elements by eliminating the 
middle tones in your subject. It is also surprising how much information a 
simple silhouette can reveal -- a person heavy in thought, a young child 
frolicking on the beach or a winter snow scene of a naked tree. 
</P>
<P>
It is a method of bringing your information to the front but in a subtle way. A 
properly exposed and composed silhouette will bring drama and excitement to 
your images. 
</P>
<P>
Make sure there is a balance between your light and dark areas. The rules of 
composition still apply. Make sure your subject isn't stuck right in the center 
of your frame. Also remember that this style is used to create mood or emotion. 
Visualize as you create, though some of your best images will probably happen 
by experimentation -- bracket your exposure, change lenses and angles. 
</P>
<P>
The easiest rule to follow is to have your light source behind your subject. 
Put your subject in front of a window, in front of a sunset or in front of a 
white wall and direct the lights at the wall instead of your subject. 
</P>
<P>
Window light. Your exposure should be read off the window light. Take your 
light reading with the subject away from the window, then move your subject 
into position. In the case of a fully automatic camera, this will not be 
possible. Instead, compose your picture with a large portion of the window 
showing so that your light meter will be fooled and underexpose for the 
silhouette. If you have the time, experiment. Use a white piece of cardboard or 
reflective material to the side to bounce a small amount of light toward the 
subject. This will give just a hint of detail. 
</P>
<P>
The beach at sunset. Probably the most frequently photographed location for a 
silhouette is the beach. However, the beach gives light meters nightmares. With 
the bright relections off the ocean and the white sand, your camera will 
normally expose for this bright highlight area and underexpose your subject. 
This is perfect for silhouette but not if subject detail is important. 
</P>
<P>
Your best silhouettes will come at sunset. It is hard to do it wrong with the 
vibrant colors in the sky at this time of day. Your camera will probably give 
you an exposure that is fairly accurate as you point it toward the horizon. 
Your subject will be a shadowy figure because the exposure will be taken from 
the bright sky and setting sun. 
</P>
<P>
For an even more dramatic look, bracket your exposure if your camera has a 
manual setting. Try closing down at least one f-stop. The colors will become 
more intense as you underexpose film. This is especially true when shooting 
color slides. 
</P>
<P>
A white wall. This image may be shot against a wall in the home, a white bed 
sheet or a studio backdrop -- only your imagination will hold you back. You 
must direct your lighting toward the background and take your meter there. A 
good rule to follow is to have your background four f-stops brighter than your 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
If you're using color film, the style of light source and film type will 
produce different color backgrounds. With daylight balanced film, incandescent 
lights will produce a warm orange cast, fluorescent lights give a green cast 
and strobe lights produce a whiter cast. Try using color gels over strobes. 
This will add color to the background, giving you more flexibility, creativity 
and drama. 
</P>

BOOKS AND AUTHORS: MYSTERY THEATER AUDIENCE WILL HIT STREETS TO SOLVE WHODUNIT

Upchurch-Brown Booksellers in Laguna Beach, which regularly hosts book signings 
and other literary events, has embarked on its most ambitious project yet. 
</P>
<P>
Co-owners Mary Upchurch and Robert Brown have teamed with Laguna restaurateur 
Jules Swimmer to create Laguna Mysteries Inc., a mystery dinner theater in 
which the audience will literally take to the streets in the course of 
attempting to find out who-done-it. 
</P>
<P>
The first play in the audience-participation series, which will be presented on 
the last Saturday of each month, is "The Laguna Baron," written by Los Angeles 
playwright Julio Martinez. The debut performance on April 29 is sold out. 
</P>
<P>
As scripted, the mystery begins at the bookstore with an "author signing 
party." To search for clues, guests move on to several Laguna locations, 
stopping at Swimmer's Le Petit Gourmet Cafe for dinner. After dinner, it's back 
to the bookstore for the resolution of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
The play's 6-member cast is from the Comedy Company of Newport Beach. Despite 
the acting company's name, Brown emphasizes that the play is not a comedy. 
</P>
<P>
"Although it's set in 1989, it's more a 1930s-style mystery, and we use Laguna 
landmarks, history and architecture," he said. "It's a Laguna experience." 
</P>
<P>
Tickets are $48 per person and each performance, which lasts about 2 1/2 hours, 
is limited to 40 people. For reservations and information, call (714) 497-9742.
