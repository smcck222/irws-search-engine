New York City police acknowledged that 30 women arrested while demonstrating 
for AIDS research funds were strip-searched, and said at least two police 
matrons will face departmental charges. The treatment of the members of the 
AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power was "clearly improper" in light of the "minor 
charges" against them, said Alice McGillion, deputy police commissioner for 
public affairs. She said a strip-search is conducted only when there is 
"reasonable" belief that a suspect is armed or carrying drugs, and even then 
special permission is required. One of the demonstrators, Catherine Saalfield, 
23, of Manhattan, said she was ordered to strip in a cell at Manhattan's 7th 
Precinct, but "(police) never checked the pockets of my jacket. It was purely 
for intimidation and harassment."

The Pentagon was chided for making little progress toward major reform of the 
Defense Department. Rep. Nicholas Mavroules (D-Mass.), chairman of the House 
Armed Services investigations subcommittee, said "it has been 2 1/2 years since 
passage of the Goldwater-Nichols Act. At some point, 'trying to implement' the 
law becomes basic non-compliance with its provisions." The Goldwater-Nichols 
Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 strengthened the authority of 
the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in advising on the budget and 
evaluating preparedness by, among other things, shifting responsibilities from 
the members to the chairman and creating the position of vice chairman.

Two laid-off instructors at the TVA Power Operations Training Center at the 
Sequoyah Nuclear Plant near Chattanooga, Tenn., said they reported cheating on 
crucial examinations given to nuclear employees. Bill North, 41, and Jackie L. 
Shields, 48, both veteran TVA employees until last month, said they have asked 
a judge with the U.S. Merit System Protection Board to arbitrate their case. 
The former academic training coordinators said they will tell the judge about 
TVA workers they say cheated, some more than once, on written tests required by 
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. An NRC spokesman said the charges are 
serious and an investigation may begin today, the Chattanooga News-Free Press 
reported.

Budget cuts will probably not force elimination of the ranger horse patrol in 
Yosemite National Park, Rep. Richard H. Lehman (D-Sanger) said. But in a letter 
to park officials, Lehman, whose district includes a part of the park, said he 
believes the park can use entrance fees to finance the ranger horse patrol. 
Park officials said earlier they would have to disband the ranger horse patrol 
because of funding problems. At that time, park officials said a new law 
prohibited park entrance fees from being used to fund the horse patrol. 
However, Lehman said in his letter that he believes park officials 
misinterpreted the new law.

Bombs exploded near a troop truck in Yugoslavia's riot-torn Kosovo province and 
outside a Serbian newspaper office in Croatia, causing no injuries but sparking 
fears that ethnic Albanians may be resorting to guerrilla attacks in their 
fight against Serbian dominance, officials said. The blasts followed riots by 
Albanians in Kosovo last week that left 24 people dead. The riots erupted after 
officials in Serbia, the largest of Yugoslavia's six republics, imposed curbs 
on the southern province's autonomy to permit a crackdown on nationalists who 
are accused of persecuting local Serbs.

President Bush is expected to name Navy Adm. Richard H. Truly to head NASA, 
Administration sources said, which would make him the first astronaut to head 
the space agency. Truly, associate administrator for spaceflight at the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, is expected to be nominated for 
the post this week, said officials, who declined to be identified. He would 
succeed James C. Fletcher, who retired from the post after holding it for more 
than two years. Truly was pilot of the second space shuttle flight -- a two-day 
mission in 1981 -- and commander of the eighth flight, the first night launch 
and landing mission, in 1983. He is credited with playing a major role in 
returning the United States to manned spaceflight after the Challenger disaster 
on Jan. 28, 1986.

Three San Joaquin Valley sites have been added to the Environmental Protection 
Agency's Superfund list of the nation's most polluted areas. The expanded list 
was released in Washington and among 101 new entries were an old Southern 
California Edison pole dipping yard in Visalia and areas in Modesto and Turlock 
where soil and ground water are contaminated. Superfund status potentially 
makes available special funding to clean up the polluted sites which are 
considered the greatest long-term threat to humans and the environment.

A Paraguayan human rights group said it has discovered a clandestine cemetery 
holding the remains of up to 40 political dissidents killed under the 
government of deposed dictator Alfredo Stroessner. Francisco Jose de Vargas, 
president of the Committee of Churches, told Reuters news agency that the site 
in Colonia Esperanza, 44 miles northeast of Asuncion, consists of 30 to 40 
graves. "It is a sort of clandestine graveyard used between 1963 and 1976," De 
Vargas said, asserting that "they are political activists' graves, mostly 
liberals or communists, some of whom were arrested before they were murdered." 
Stroessner was toppled in a February coup after ruling Paraguay for 34 years.

NEWSMAKERS: MAUREEN REAGAN KEPT HER GRIM SECRET FOR 20 YEARS

 -- For more than 20 years, Maureen Reagan hid from her parents that she was 
beaten and abused by her first husband, the oldest child of former President 
Ronald Reagan and actress Jane Wyman reveals in her upcoming autobiography. "At 
the age of 20, I married a man who was about 10 years older than I was. It 
turned out to be the worst single mistake of my entire life," she writes in her 
book, "First Father, First Daughter," to be published later this month and 
excerpted this week in People magazine. "By the time I finally discovered the 
strength to leave him, I had been brutally beaten, abused, battered and kicked 
about the face and head by this man on more occasions than I care to count." 
Reagan, 48, who is now married to her third husband, declines to identify her 
first husband, except to say he was a Washington police officer and that she 
divorced him in 1962. The first her parents knew of the beatings was when she 
sent them manuscripts of her book last year.

 -- A record company that pulled out moldering stacks of Leonid I. Brezhnev's 
recorded speeches, dusted them off and put them up for sale was surprised to 
find it had a sellout on its hands, a Soviet newspaper reported. A stack of 500 
Brezhnev records recently pulled from the storage room of the state record 
company Melodiya in Moscow sold out immediately, Komsomolskaya Pravda said. And 
in Stavropol, hometown of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, copies of 
Brezhnev's record, "Topical Questions of Ideological Work of the Communist 
Party of the Soviet Union," were snatched up as soon as they reappeared on 
store shelves. A Melodiya director said the store had received no instructions 
from the government on what to do with the old records and had decided to sell 
them "to let people hear the way we lived" under Brezhnev. Brezhnev was Soviet 
president from 1964 until his death in 1982.

L.A. TAKES AIM AGAIN AT BLIGHTED DWELLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a new offensive against blight and substandard housing, a corps of city 
building inspectors are expected to converge today on South-Central Los Angeles 
with orders to find illegal and unsafe living conditions, including garages 
converted into makeshift homes. 
</P>
<P>
The house-by-house inspections mark a dramatic shift in city code enforcement 
policy, a result of pressure from community activists and City Councilman 
Robert Farrell, and a recent increase in the ranks of city building inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
It is the beginning of a "new pro-active approach" to neighborhood blight, said 
Milford Bliss, chief of the city's Building and Safety Department's Community 
Safety Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to expose the creeping blight in our neighborhoods," Bliss said. 
"We've got to use our policing powers to get property owners to reverse the 
downward spiral." 
</P>
<P>
In weeks ahead, a team of five inspectors will be walking onto the property of 
hundreds of single-family homes and duplexes in a 4-square-mile area bounded by 
81st and 111th streets, Central Avenue and Figueroa Street. Farrell and 
residents have identified this area as most in need of enforcement action 
because many of its houses are ramshackle and need structural repair. 
</P>
<P>
More than half the residents of the predominantly black and Latino area earn 
less than $15,000 a year and live in single-family homes that are between 20 
and 40 years old, according to 1988 statistics from The Times marketing 
research department. About 59% of the housing units in the area are occupied by 
renters. 
</P>
<P>
"These inspections are of fundamental importance to my district," Farrell said. 
"This is about preserving valuable housing stock." 
</P>
<P>
Carrying walkie-talkies to give them quick access to Building and Safety 
Department supervisors and police, inspectors will enter yards, garages, sheds, 
living rooms and kitchens to conduct the home inspections. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Seek Permission 
</P>
<P>
Under city law, the inspectors have the right to enter property if they suspect 
dangerous building conditions exist. However, officials said they would trod 
lightly on personal property and will first seek homeowner permission. 
</P>
<P>
If the owner refuses but inspectors still suspect hazardous conditions, the 
city can seek a special court order to gain access to the house. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell said he and his staff will review the results of the inspections and 
will decide which houses have the most serious problems. Orders to repair or 
clean up property then will be issued. 
</P>
<P>
The new campaign is supported by neighborhood leaders who have long worked on 
community clean-up campaigns. "We are sick and tired of people letting their 
houses go," said Ferdia Harris, 70, founder of the Council of Community Clubs. 
"If someone lives in a shanty they are going to have to fix it up. It's as 
simple as that." 
</P>
<P>
The inspection program will deal with three levels of violations. The easiest 
and least controversial will be ordering the removal of yard debris such as 
abandoned cars and appliances. 
</P>
<P>
More difficult to enforce will be orders forcing homeowners to repair 
structural defects in their homes, such as crumbling chimneys and porches or 
faulty wiring and plumbing. Low-interest or no-interest loans will be offered 
to pay for the repairs. Those who refuse to make the repairs could face 
misdemeanor charges. 
</P>
<P>
The most sensitive and controversial aspect of the program will be cracking 
down on dwellings that are occupied unlawfully and developing a city policy to 
deal with them, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Black-Market Housing 
</P>
<P>
Farrell and others expect the South-Central inspection to shed light on Los 
Angeles' black-market housing industry, in which a sub-strata of poor people 
live in garages, sheds or other illegally added structures. 
</P>
<P>
These dwellings, many of them converted garages, typically violate a number of 
city zoning and building laws. They flaunt zoning ordinances because they are 
second units on single-family house lots. They often pose sanitation, 
electrical and plumbing hazards. 
</P>
<P>
Although the number of such unlawful dwellings in the city has not been 
determined, a Times study in May, 1987, revealed that about 200,000 people live 
in 42,000 illegally converted garages throughout Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The city inspects illegal dwellings only when neighbors or tenants complain. 
Inspectors usually order the property owner to convert the dwelling back to its 
original use, forcing tenants out, Bliss said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Humanitarian Concern' 
</P>
<P>
Farrell said he will deal with tenants of such illegally converted dwellings 
with a "spirit of humanitarian concern." He said it is not the intent of the 
inspections to evict poor people who are struggling to find shelter. 
</P>
<P>
He would like to take advantage of a council-approved ordinance that forces 
property owners to pay up to $5,000 to relocate tenants evicted from illegal 
dwellings because of hazardous conditions. That measure is awaiting Mayor Tom 
Bradley's signature.

NEW UCLA CENTER TO STUDY REGIONAL URBAN PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK CLIFFORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reflecting a desire to play a more visible role in the region's policy-making 
arena, UCLA today announced the creation of a center to focus on many of the 
urban problems -- from transportation to land use -- facing local governments 
in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
A UCLA official said that the new Center for Regional Policy Studies will 
coordinate independent study on urban issues now under way at UCLA and provide 
a resource for community leaders who are trying to find new strategies for 
solving social and environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel the university should have an expanded role in helping to frame the 
public debates which are central to the process of regional renewal," said 
Richard Weinstein, dean of UCLA's Graduate School of Architecture and Urban 
Planning, where the center will be based. 
</P>
<P>
Weinstein said a goal of the center is to solve "the policy gridlock" -- the 
inability of the region's many governments to work together. Pursuit of that 
goal could put the center in the thick of a growing debate about the 
effectiveness of local government as it is now constituted. 
</P>
<P>
Weinstein does not shy away from expressing his skepticism of the current local 
government system. 
</P>
<P>
"With 162 separate political jurisdictions (in the five-county region around 
Los Angeles), we have the most balkanized political geography in the country, 
if not the world," he said. "At the same time, we confront issues like air 
pollution, traffic congestion, jobs and housing that do not respect the 
artificial political boundaries that we have created over the years." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Poverty, Land Use 
</P>
<P>
Weinstein said the center also will focus on regional poverty, on "the link 
between transportation, land use and environmental degradation" and on the 
structure of the region's economy. 
</P>
<P>
The center is being created with a $5-million endowment from UCLA alumni and 
home builders Ralph and Goldy Lewis. Weinstein said the facility, to be called 
the Lewis Center, will draw on more than 80 faculty members and 115 departments 
and professional schools at UCLA. A director for the center has yet to be 
chosen. 
</P>
<P>
With the center, UCLA becomes one of 95 universities throughout the country, 
including Cal State Long Beach, to establish a local research institute for 
urban policy studies.

Meadowland Stadium's in New Jersey and the Houston Astrodome's are larger -- 
the numbers still add up to a sellout crowd of 60,000-plus ticket holders and 
about 20,000 parking spaces. These figures have driven ACE Parking, the company 
that has handled stadium parking for 22 years, to strive for greater parking 
harmony this year. 
</P>
<P>
"The kinds of problems we're going to have will happen after 6 p.m.," said 
Scott Jones, president of ACE Parking. "If people can just try to plan to come 
early and come where the husband does not have to drive from work to meet the 
wife coming from home. Too many cars and not enough spaces . . .that's when the 
problem goes out to Friars Road. 
</P>
<P>
"People need to understand we've got a good luxury here," he added. "We've 
gotten spoiled. With normal games, you can leave half an hour before game time 
and breeze right in. With bigger games, we need more self-discipline." 
</P>
<P>
The parking lot will open at 1 p.m. and the stadium gates will open at 5 p.m., 
Jones said. Tailgaters who set up in more than one parking space must give up 
the extra space an hour and a half before the game, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres square off against the San Francisco Giants at 7:20 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
ACE has also created 2,000 more parking spaces by asking Padres management to 
eliminate the traditional opening-day fireworks. In past years, part of the lot 
had to be cordoned off to allow for fireworks fallout, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 cashiers and attendants will be on hand with eagerly outstretched 
palms to collect the $3 parking fee. ACE Parking officials will also be 
available at a customer-service window near Gate F to address any questions or 
concerns, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police will begin directing traffic at 4 p.m., an hour earlier than 
in years past, Jones said. Police will divert traffic from Mission Village 
Drive and help alleviate commuter traffic on Friars Road. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shuttle-Bus Service 
</P>
<P>
Further efforts to alleviate the parking crunch include an overflow lot at Taft 
Junior High School, 9191 Gramercy Drive, about half a mile from the stadium. 
Parking there is free. 
</P>
<P>
Shuttle buses will leave from Taft half an hour before the game starts and will 
leave 20 minutes after the game is over, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Transit will provide shuttle service to the game from several 
locations around town, beginning at 5 p.m. and making a last round one hour 
before game time. Pick up locations include the Downtown/Hillcrest area, east 
San Diego, La Mesa, El Cajon and North County. 
</P>
<P>
For specific locations and times, call San Diego Transit at 234-3004. In the 
North County-coastal area, call 722-6383, and in the North County-inland area, 
call 743-6383. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, shuttle fare is $2 one way and $4 for a round trip. From North 
County, the fare is $2.50 one way and $5 for a round trip.

PROFOUND RIGHTS QUESTIONS PRESENTED BY GENETIC TESTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK WEISS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The debate over genetic testing will involve profound questions about the 
boundaries between the rights of individuals and the rights of employers and 
insurers. The manner in which society answers these questions, experts say, 
will rival in significance earlier challenges in the civil rights and workers' 
rights arenas. 
</P>
<P>
The parallel is apt. Some of the earliest documented cases of discriminatory 
genetic screening relate to sickle-cell anemia, an inherited blood disease that 
affects blacks almost exclusively. 
</P>
<P>
This potentially fatal disease results from a single gene defect that causes a 
deformation of oxygen-carrying red blood cells. It became the object of 
widespread screening in the United States in the early 1970s, partly in 
response to demands by the black community for better health care. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately, however, observers recognized in the programs a 
double-edged sword, with evidence that some employers might be using test 
results to discriminate against blacks. Even "carriers" of the disease -- those 
whose chromosomes contain only one of two possible genes for the disease and 
who generally show no ill effects -- were sometimes denied jobs as airline 
pilots, deferred from some branches of the armed forces and saddled with higher 
insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
Several states have since passed laws against the misuse of sickle-cell 
screening. But those early cases put minorities on notice that genetic testing 
has more than therapeutic possibilities. And now, with the genes for other 
diseases and medical predispositions coming into focus, every individual 
becomes, in a sense, a minority member with particular odds of suffering a 
particular medical fate. RICK WEISS

TARGETING YUPPIE DRUG USERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William Bennett's first major decision on the war against drugs -- to 
concentrate on the "yuppie drug users" -- is a clearly misguided attempt and, 
although well-intentioned, reveals a crucial lack of understanding of the 
problems of urban communities (Part I, March 20). I do recognize that drug use 
and abuse, by any sector of our society, are wrong and of some concern. 
</P>
<P>
However, I must point out the following to Bennett: It is not yuppies who are 
selling drugs on our school campuses; it is not yuppies who are peddling drugs 
on every other corner in our community; it is not yuppies who have turned to 
prostitution so that they can get a quick high; it is not yuppies who are 
stealing from their family members to support their habit, and it is not 
yuppies who are engaging in nightly warfare over the establishments of turf for 
cocaine trafficking. The fact of the matter is that the most serious and the 
worst problems in our society resulting from drug addiction are not affecting 
yuppies. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett's position represents the very type of ivory-tower approach which we -- 
in the heart of the problem -- have always feared. I do not profess to have the 
answer, but I recognize that Bennett is starting at the wrong end. Any solution 
to the drug problem in our community will have to contain some combination of 
law enforcement, rehabilitation, punishment and early education about the 
dangers of drug use. These efforts must be directed to where the major problems 
exist -- the urban communities. If Bennett does not recognize this, then he is 
obviously not in touch with what is occurring in these communities.

'WHERE A NICKEL PAYS OFF'

<TEXT>
<P>
I was dismayed to read that SB 1221 proposes to raise the redemption value of 
bottles and cans. 
</P>
<P>
If your editorial writer had the misfortune to live in an apartment overlooking 
an alley (as I do) he would never have endorsed this bill. We are awakened 
every morning at dawn, sometimes earlier, by the first of a daylong procession 
of scavengers going through all the garbage cans in the alley. Twenty people a 
day is about average. 
</P>
<P>
The sound of supermarket baskets rattling down the alley, of cans and bottles 
being thrown out of garbage bins as the scavengers rummage around inside the 
bins, and the shooting-gallery effect of cans being stamped on to flatten them 
are enough to drive one mad. The fact that this routine ransacking of garbage 
is illegal is beside the point; the law is never enforced. And now, it seems, 
this madness is to be intensified and abetted, if the scavengers' monetary 
incentive is increased.

TARGETING YUPPIE DRUG USERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the "war on drugs" and Bennett's strategy for it: let's get one thing 
straight. The violence associated with the drug trade is not the fault of drug 
users, be they yuppie or otherwise. Rather, it is a direct result of the laws 
against drug use. This is a simple case of cause and effect. Originally, drugs 
were legal, and there was no drug-related violence. Then laws were passed 
against drug use, and a black market formed, dominated by organized crime and 
gangs, who use violent means to sustain their domination. If drugs were 
legalized again, the black market would disappear. Drug abuse is selfish and 
stupid, but is not the cause of drug-related violence. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, the violence is the fault of those like Bennett who have made drug use 
a moral issue, thus negating any possibility of drug legalization. Drug abuse 
is no more a moral issue than alcohol abuse; and alcohol is a legal drug (of 
which Bennnett reputedly consumed at least his share during his college days.) 
Drug abuse is a social issue, and it doesn't warrant the hysteria that is 
gripping this country. There are much more serious issues. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, there is a product in America, the abuse of which kills more 
people every year than Americans were killed in the entire Vietnam War. In 
addition, it causes millions of injuries, costs the nation hundreds of millions 
of dollars in social services, is a prime contributor to the greenhouse effect, 
and is a source of daily stress to most of the adult population. The product 
is, of course, the automobile. Cars are legal, and even considered beneficial 
to society. Which they are, but the car problem in America is far worse than 
the drug problem. So, until President Bush appoints a "car czar," why doesn't 
he give Bennett a real job -- like working on alleviating the problems that 
cause people to turn to drugs in the first place.

Hooray for Colman McCarthy! ("Bluster on Drugs, but That's No Solution," Op-Ed 
Page, March 21). It's been too long now that the "war against drugs" has been 
limited to "just say no" slogans and calls for more guns, military 
surveillance, and jails. Finally, McCarthy asks the fundamental question: Why? 
What are these people feeling that makes them want to deaden their senses? And 
not only those suffering the pain of poverty -- we all know that drug use knows 
no socioeconomic boundaries. There are big hurts out there, and until we stop 
the demand in this country for the drugs to treat those pains, we're going to 
have more dead, more wounded . . . more war.

'WHERE A NICKEL PAYS OFF' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I write in response to your editorial "Where a Nickel Pays Off" (March 20). 
</P>
<P>
The Beverage Container Recycling Act, which took effect in October, 1987, is 
aimed at recycling 65% of the roughly 11 billion aluminum, plastic and glass 
beverage containers consumed annually. 
</P>
<P>
The California bottle law is working. After the first two weeks in operation, 
609 million containers were redeemed across the state for their deposit value. 
Compared to the numbers of just two years ago, if we are now getting a 57% 
return rate on the empty aluminum cans, I consider the 1-cent deposit a 
tremendous success. 
</P>
<P>
Just because we haven't reached the 65% goal is no reason to increase the 
deposit to 5 cents. Let's be reminded that this proposal will not just get us 5 
cents back per can, but will also force us to pay 5 cents per can when the 
beverages are originally purchased. 
</P>
<P>
If we have to raise the deposit in 1990 to 2 cents per container, as the bill 
calls for, that's fine. Nevertheless, if we don't emphasize to the public the 
importance of recycling, the return rate won't increase. What California needs 
is a commitment to save and a "convenient" way to return these containers. 
Let's get larger corporations and the manufacturers of these products to help 
in staffing more centers. Upping the ante is not the answer.

THE WEST MUST DECIDE IF IT WOULD FEEL SECURE WITH AN INDEPENDENT EASTERN EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM PFAFF, William Pfaff is a Los Angeles Times syndicated columnist 
based in Paris. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III's remark last week that he is considering 
a proposal that "a new political arrangement for Eastern Europe" be discussed 
with Moscow brings Henry Kissinger back onto the U.S. foreign-policy scene. The 
proposal is Kissinger's. It has not been made public. 
</P>
<P>
Baker characterized the proposal as offering the Soviet Union a "type of 
formalized status in Eastern Europe" in exchange for greater freedom for the 
East European governments to run their own affairs. The West would promise not 
to exploit the situation to the Soviet Union's disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
Baker went on to ask, however, if this is a sensible thing to do "when 
countries in the region, like Poland and Hungary, are already moving towards a 
more Western orientation in their economies and political systems." His evident 
inclination to leave well enough alone is defensible, but possibly too 
complacent. 
</P>
<P>
It is true that the overactive and overambitious approach to complicated 
problems is dangerous, and has produced much grief for America. It is also true 
that the tide is running in the West's favor in Eastern Europe. But this is a 
turbulent tide with an undertow; it could, to press the metaphor, end in a 
riptide. 
</P>
<P>
There is merit in Kissinger's concern that the United States look for a way 
constructively to influence events in Eastern Europe and reduce some of the 
risks there. The question is how best to do it, and that depends on how you see 
the future of Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
There are two fundamentally different views of Eastern Europe held in the West. 
One says that the Soviet Union is there to stay. Like it or not, Eastern Europe 
is part of a Soviet ideological and security system that Moscow will not alter. 
As Leonid Brezhnev said to Alexander Dubcek after the 1968 Soviet invasion of 
Czechoslovakia, "Your frontier . . . is that of the Socialist camp. It is the 
result of the Second World War for which the U.S.S.R. paid a high cost. The 
Soviet Politburo does not have the right to place in jeopardy the results of 
that war." 
</P>
<P>
This view of Eastern Europe was held in the State Department a decade and a 
half ago, when Kissinger was in charge of U.S. foreign policy. At that time one 
of his associates described the aim of U.S. policy thusly: to "strive for an 
evolution that makes the relationship between the East Europeans and the Soviet 
Union an organic one" -- hence more stable, less prone to crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The other view of Eastern Europe holds that it is unreasonable and unhistorical 
to think that ancient and culturally autonomous nations -- Hungary, Poland and 
Bohemia (Czechoslovakia) -- historically linked to West European civilization, 
can indefinitely be deprived of their independence by the Soviet Union. The 
attempt to do so, in this view, is the cause of enduring instability in Europe, 
and in East-West relations. 
</P>
<P>
Despite 40 years of military occupation, the Soviet Union has failed to win the 
allegiance of any significant part of public opinion in the region. It enjoys 
less sympathy today than it did in the 1940s, when there were real, 
revolutionary Communist parties in Eastern Europe that genuinely believed in 
the Soviet Union as a workers' state and as the promise of a new and more just 
human order. Nothing remotely like that exists today. Every vital political 
force in Eastern Europe is directed against the Soviet Union and toward 
national independence. 
</P>
<P>
If you hold this view, you must conclude that the proper objective of the 
Western policy-maker is to bring about a replacement of the European security 
system, which rests ultimately on military compulsion, by one based on consent 
and mutual interest. 
</P>
<P>
Western guarantees of legitimate Soviet security concerns, and of NATO 
non-interference and non-exploitation of a changed situation, with mutual arms 
reductions, troop withdrawals, confidence-building measures, etc., all are ways 
to achieve that objective. But the objective must be clearly understood. It is 
not to make it possible for the Soviet Union to safely stay in Eastern Europe. 
It is to make it possible for it to safely leave. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of policy initiative from Washington has produced an uneasy situation 
in Western Europe, hinging on the debate -- or the lack of an open debate -- 
over Germany's role in Eastern Europe's evolution. The situation is developing 
more rapidly than Washington seems to appreciate, and West German and French 
policy-makers are concerned. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Baker chooses to let the situation develop without American 
intervention, the question of objective still must be answered. Do we look for 
security in an independent Eastern Europe? Or do we see an independent Eastern 
Europe as a threat to stability, hence to security? Kissinger has one answer. 
Others have another. The merit of his proposal is that it has confronted us 
with that question.

NEW CALIFORNIA BATTLE: HEALTH CARE FOR ALL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED SALZMAN, Ed Salzman is the consulting editor of Golden State Report 
magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even before the state Supreme Court decides the fate of last year's 
auto-insurance initiative, economic forces are stockpiling political arms for 
possible ballot-box warfare over a larger insurance issue -- health-care 
coverage for every citizen of California. 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, the immediate concern is insurance for 5.2 million Californians 
who fall between the cracks, uncovered by their employers and ineligible for 
government benefits. But a consumer coalition, fueled by recent successes with 
the initiative process, is expanding the debate by propounding a ballot measure 
that would guarantee all 28 million Californians state-provided health 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1916, when progressive Gov. Hiram Johnson proposed a universal 
health-insurance plan, Californians have periodically debated the issue, with 
doctors, hospitals and other health-care providers fighting successfully 
against what they call "socialized medicine." 
</P>
<P>
There is general agreement on the principle that every Californian is entitled 
to first-class health care without extreme economic hardship. From that point, 
the debate centers on the proper role of government in converting principle to 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
Should government guarantee health care to everyone as a basic human right or 
should its role be restricted to the aged, poor, blind and disabled? Should 
government force employers to insure all employees and their dependents? Should 
any public program include long-term care, prescriptions, eyeglasses and 
dentistry? 
</P>
<P>
Questions like these are now before the Legislature because the media have 
dramatized the fiscal plight of the uninsured, medical costs are rising much 
faster than inflation, and hard-pressed counties no longer wish to be the 
health provider of last resort. 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, the heat comes from a San Francisco-based coalition called Health 
Access, which is developing a universal health-insurance initiative for the 
1990 ballot. This 17-organization coalition is led by Lois Salisbury and 
Maryann O'Sullivan, attorneys with Public Advocates, a law firm specializing in 
pro-consumer class-action lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Under a draft of the initiative, the state would provide health insurance to 
every Californian "regardless of age, sex, health status or ability to pay." 
Every citizen would choose between a variety of health plans that limit choice 
of doctors and hospitals. A fee-for-service alternative would also be offered. 
Canada uses a similar system, as does the state for 600,000 active and retired 
employees and their families. 
</P>
<P>
The literally $64-billion question: How would this system be financed? The 
sponsors propose that the state go after funds now spent for the Medicare and 
Medi-Cal programs and also levy a payroll tax of undetermined size. 
</P>
<P>
For firms now providing coverage, the payroll tax presumably would be offset by 
elimination of health-insurance costs. Employers without health plans would 
feel the pinch. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is rife with problems that must be resolved: Will Uncle Sam be 
willing to turn over all Medicare payments to the state? Will quality of care 
be adversely affected by pressure to keep costs down? Will California become a 
magnet for the nation's chronically ill? The coalition is using a bill by 
Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles) as the vehicle for hearings designed 
to answer these and many other questions about the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
In theory, the proposal wouldn't eliminate the free-enterprise marketplace 
because the state would only be paying insurance premiums, not hiring doctors 
and running hospitals. But government and business would have an interest in 
keeping costs down, and that could intensify the squeeze the state applied to 
hospitals and physicians seven years ago in adopting health-care reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The California Medical Assn., which represents most California doctors, is 
attempting to defuse the Health Access plan by pushing a bill by Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), which would take a big bite out of the 
problem. Under the Brown bill, every business with five or more employees would 
be required to provide health insurance for workers (but not their dependents). 
</P>
<P>
That would place another 3 million Californians under the umbrella, leaving 2.2 
million uncovered. These include dependents of the 3 million, those who work in 
very small firms and self-employed persons. 
</P>
<P>
Jay D. Michael, the association's chief lobbyist, says his organization and its 
allies may place the plan on the ballot in 1990 if the Legislature rejects the 
Brown bill. The main opposition is from small businesses, which would be forced 
to pay billions of dollars to insure their employees. (Economists estimate 
annual health costs at between $2,000 and $2,500 per Californian.) 
</P>
<P>
That could produce a head-to-head conflict between rival health proposals 
reminiscent of last year's free-for-all over auto insurance. The doctors are 
betting that California voters won't buy a revolutionary plan if they can 
choose a less disruptive alternative that will solve 60% of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
If the ballot-box warfare materializes, Californians will find that feelings 
will run far deeper than was the case with auto insurance, which dealt 
primarily with dollars. The health-care controversy involves such basic values 
as freedom of individuals from fear of economic disaster, freedom of employers 
and employees to negotiate health benefits, and freedom of doctors and 
hospitals to operate without government restrictions.

IN AFGHAN ACT II, LET U.S. BE WARY OF FRIENDS' AIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
With the withdrawal of Soviet troops, the curtain fell on Act I of 
Afghanistan's latest drama. Act II, the competition of outsiders for influence 
over the new government, is now under way. How Afghanistan's future is resolved 
-- Act III -- will depend on whether influence becomes domination. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome may be even more important for the region's politics than was the 
superpower struggle over Afghanistan itself. Overreaching by some of the 
regional contenders for influence could prove destructive in terms of their 
broader security and other interests. The United States could lose much if the 
ambitions of its regional allies lead to developments that, instead of 
stabilizing Afghanistan, help to destabilize the entire region. 
</P>
<P>
There is precedent for this prediction. During the 1970s, Saudi Arabia and Iran 
tried to transform Afghanistan's politics and its foreign-policy orientation, 
in particular to bring about greater distance between Afghanistan and the 
Soviet Union. But this attempt only contributed to events that finally produced 
the Soviet invasion of 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Now there is risk that efforts by outsiders to impose a government of their 
liking in Kabul could have other unforeseen and potentially damaging 
consequences. At the very least, such efforts would delay national 
reconciliation in Afghanistan, and they could even lead to endemic civil war 
along the lines of Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
It is no secret that the interim government, formed by seven rebel groups, does 
not enjoy the support of the majority of the Afghans. For example, Shiite 
Muslims, who make up 15% to 25% of the population, are not represented in this 
government. Even the relatively moderate Afghan groups in Peshawar are not 
totally behind it, nor are many of the local rebel commanders. 
</P>
<P>
This lack of cohesion is caused in part by traditional Afghan rivalries. But 
the interim government is also widely viewed as the handmaiden of a 
collaboration between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, and therein lies its cardinal 
weakness. 
</P>
<P>
Both countries are pursuing major goals. Pakistan aspires to gain dominant 
influence over a future government in Kabul, in part to avoid difficulties like 
the persistent Afghan efforts to create an independent "Pushtunistan" out of 
Pakistani territory. The Saudis chiefly want to block any increase of Iranian 
influence. In addition to supporting the interim government, the Saudis have 
been promoting fundamentalist Wahabbi missionary activity in Afghanistan as 
part of broader religious proselytizing in south and central Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Such aggressively pursued ambitions are bound to generate responses by other 
states in the region. India is unlikely to sit still in the face of Pakistani 
efforts to turn Afghanistan into a satellite. Nor would Iran acquiesce to the 
disfranchisement of Shiite Muslims by the Sunni Muslim majority in a 
Saudi-Pakistan dominion over Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
It is conceivable that India and Iran would cooperate in blocking 
Saudi-Pakistan ambitions. Such cooperation would be facilitated if the current 
trend in Soviet-Iranian rapprochement continues, especially if their reported 
arms deal materializes. Backed by the Soviet Union, an Indo-Iranian alliance 
would shift the balance of regional power against Pakistan and would put it in 
a difficult strategic position by flanking it with two hostile neighbors. India 
and Iran could also manipulate Pakistan's Pathan and Baluchi minorities, thus 
increasing the chances for internal instability. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than risking these consequences, Pakistan should develop an Afghan 
policy that serves its legitimate interests. It does have a right to demand 
that a future Afghan government unequivocally recognize the current border and 
abandon any ambitions to create an independent Pushtunistan. But if Pakistan 
goes further, or if it aids and abets broader Saudi objectives, it will be 
asking for trouble -- for itself and for others, including the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Creating stability in Afghanistan and keeping its problems from spilling over 
onto the rest of the region require respect for two basic rules. First, a 
future Afghan government must be as representative of the country's diverse 
ethnic and religious makeup as possible, and it must not be dominated by a 
single group or political or religious tendency. Second, that government must 
be nonaligned, not only in regard to ties with the superpowers, but also in its 
relations with countries in the region. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, the United States is legitimately entitled to an adequate 
presence in a nonaligned Afghanistan. Beyond this goal, however, U.S. interests 
and the ambitions of its regional allies do not necessarily coincide. 
Certainly, the United States has no interest in seeing religious extremism 
spread in Afghanistan and Pakistan, whether Shiite or Wahabbi. Nor does it have 
an interest in seeing Pakistan's relations deteriorate with two important 
neighbors, India and Iran. And an Indo-Iranian cooperation blessed by the 
Soviets would not serve U.S. interests in South Asia. 
</P>
<P>
The United States is thus in the difficult position of relying on others to 
determine whether its interests in Afghanistan will be protected. While it 
attempts to sort out just what it wants there, it must be clear about what it 
does not want: to be misled by the parochial interests and ambitions of 
regional allies.

POLITICAL HEAT RISING IN 3RD, 7TH DISTRICTS; 
</P>
<P>
CHALLENGERS PIN HOPES ON FORCING CITY COUNCIL VETERANS INTO RUNOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Al Dib is a 55-year-old father of eight who sold his produce business and put 
$11,000 of his own money into his campaign to unseat veteran Los Angeles City 
Councilman Ernani Bernardi. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe me, I would never have run again if I didn't think I had a chance of 
winning," said Dib, who is making his fourth try for political office. He 
pledges that, if elected, he will drive around the San Fernando Valley's 7th 
District, assisting police in capturing drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Paul M. McKellips, a political newcomer opposing City Councilwoman Joy Picus, 
recently met privately with the 12-year incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
"I had never met her," he said. "I told her my biggest reason for running is I 
don't think any public official should stay in office for more than eight 
years. She seemed to understand my position. She was very friendly." 
</P>
<P>
Dib and McKellips are among 11 active challengers to Bernardi and Picus in the 
most competitive Valley races leading up to the April 11 municipal election. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Braude Unopposed 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Mike Woo and Zev Yaroslavsky, whose Westside districts were extended 
into the Valley in the 1986 realignment of council district boundaries, are 
favored to win reelection. Councilman Marvin Braude, who also represents part 
of the Valley, is unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates gained a spot on the ballot by collecting the signatures of 500 
voters and paying a $300 filing fee or, to avoid paying the fee, gathering 
1,000 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the contests have been relatively quiet. But the pace is expected to 
pick up considerably as a barrage of campaign mailers begin hitting homes. 
</P>
<P>
In the hottest Valley race, Bernardi faces six active challengers. They contend 
that the 77-year-old lawmaker is not well-known to voters in his largely new 
district, carved out by the City Council in the 1986 reapportionment. 
</P>
<P>
The district takes in Arleta, Pacoima and Sylmar and parts of Lake View 
Terrace, Mission Hills, Panorama City, Sepulveda, North Hollywood, Sun Valley 
and Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Want to Force Runoff 
</P>
<P>
The challengers hope to pull in enough votes to force the 28-year incumbent 
into a runoff. A candidate must get more than 50% of the vote to win the April 
election. Otherwise, the top two vote-getters will meet in June. 
</P>
<P>
Lyle Hall, a 49-year-old Los Angeles firefighter and former president of the 
firefighters union, appears to be Bernardi's most formidable opponent. He is 
supported by organized labor in a district with substantial union membership. 
</P>
<P>
Other candidates are Jules S. Bagneris III, 28, president of the Lake View 
Terrace Home Owners Assn.; Irene Tovar, 50, former head of the Hispanic Caucus 
of the state Democratic Party; Dib, past president of the Arleta Chamber of 
Commerce; Barry Gribs, 50, a drug therapy intern, and James Braun, 29, office 
manager for a construction company. Richard Yanez withdrew from the race and 
endorsed Hall, but his name will still appear on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Hall has attacked Bernardi for missing 29 of 135 council meetings between Feb. 
1, 1988, and Jan. 31, 1989, to tie for the worst attendance record. Bernardi 
was afflicted with a virus and was hospitalized after falling and hitting his 
head. His wife was also ill, causing him to miss additional meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"Ernie has been on the City Council for 28 years and, during the last 18 
months, his illnesses have made him a part-time councilman," Hall said in a 
campaign mailer sent to voters last week. "We need a councilman who will work 
full time for all of us." Bernardi replied that he is fully recovered and has 
resumed his busy schedule. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drug Center Backed 
</P>
<P>
Hall supports opening of the Nancy Reagan Center for drug rehabilitation in 
Lake View Terrace. The proposed facility is opposed by Bernardi and many of the 
area's residents who fear that it will bring crime to the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Bagneris, who was 8 months old when Bernardi was first elected in 1961, 
contends that the district needs a younger, more energetic councilman with 
fresh ideas. His name is pronounced Bon-er-eese, but even Bagneris has begun 
calling himself Bag-ner-is during the campaign because everyone else does. "Why 
fight?" he sighed. 
</P>
<P>
Bagneris, the son of a politically active minister from Pacoima, said he 
decided to run for office after attending a rally for 1968 presidential 
candidate Hubert H. Humphrey. He said Humphrey was seated next to him in a 
church pew and when the vice president got up to speak, he mentioned the 
7-year-old Bagneris by name. 
</P>
<P>
"My eyes lit up," Bagneris said. "It was then that I decided that I wanted to 
go into politics because politicians wanted to help people and they could make 
a difference." 
</P>
<P>
Bagneris, who is also a minister but works as a stockbroker, has preached that 
Bernardi exhibits a "lack of leadership, timidity, powerlessness that is not 
going to address our needs." He also says the councilman has been unable to 
close the Lopez Canyon Landfill in Lake View Terrace. Nearby homeowners 
complain about noise, odor and traffic congestion from the dump. 
</P>
<P>
"The residents around Mission Canyon Landfill had an effective and vociferous 
voice in the City Council, and they were able to close down that dump," 
Bagneris said, referring to a now-closed dump in Sepulveda Pass. "If we had 
such a voice in the City Council, we would be able to do the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
Bagneris has also blamed Bernardi for the poor condition of the 1,437-acre 
Hansen Dam recreation area, site of a once-popular lake that is now a stagnant 
pond. 
</P>
<P>
"I see no reason why the residents of the 7th District should not be able to 
enjoy the same type of quality facilities as those enjoyed by the residents of 
the area surrounding the Sepulveda Basin" in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi replied: "Challengers have a knack of making everything seem so simple 
and easy to resolve." 
</P>
<P>
On Lopez Canyon, Bernardi said he has sought to open landfills in other areas 
of the city but has been unsuccessful because of opposition from other council 
members who do not want the political headache of dumps in their districts. On 
Hansen Dam, Bernardi said the city is working on a plan to improve the area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little League Team 
</P>
<P>
Dib said he deserves to be elected because of his years of community service, 
ranging from donating food to poor families in Pacoima to sponsoring a Little 
League team in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
"I paid my dues in the area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you think your quality of life is as good as it is in Sherman Oaks, in 
Northridge, in Encino?" Dib asked at a recent candidates forum. "If you do, you 
should reelect Ernani Bernardi." Dib has promised, if elected, to push for 
building a monorail line from Sylmar to downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Tovar said she decided to run because Bernardi opposed the redistricting. 
</P>
<P>
"He has never really wanted to represent this district," she said. Bernardi 
said he merely opposed the political maneuvering that led to the remapping. 
</P>
<P>
Tovar has advocated reassigning more police from lower-crime areas to the 
northeast Valley. "Don't be deceived," she said. "We can have more police 
without more taxes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Makes It Even Worse' 
</P>
<P>
Gribs has said at candidate forums that throwing gang members in jail is not 
the way to reduce crime. 
</P>
<P>
"These gang members are from dysfunctional, alcoholic families," he said. "The 
first thing you do when you arrest these gang members and put them in jail is 
reinforce the feelings that they are not worthy of anything, that they are no 
good. . . . This makes it even worse. 
</P>
<P>
"What I propose is that we build or change the jails into locked treatment 
centers where we could keep them secure but treat them in a more loving, 
positive way. This would build their self-esteem." He supports opening of the 
Nancy Reagan Center. 
</P>
<P>
Braun has pledged that, if elected, he would seek a halt to all building in the 
district until new development plans can be prepared for each community. 
</P>
<P>
He has contended that Bernardi has become ineffective. "He has been a maverick 
for so long now" that he cannot obtain the support of his colleagues for 
programs that benefit the district, Braun said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3rd District Challengers 
</P>
<P>
In the West Valley's 3rd District, Picus, 58, faces five challengers led by 
Peter Ireland, 43, an aide to County Supervisor Deane Dana, and Jeanne Nemo, 
60, a Republican activist backed by County Supervisor Mike Antonovich. The 
others are Morton Diamond, 57, a hot dog vendor; McKellips, 30, a businessman, 
and Ron Rich, 40, an auto dealer. 
</P>
<P>
The district extends roughly from Balboa Boulevard to the western city limits 
between Roscoe Boulevard and the Ventura Freeway. It includes Canoga Park, 
Reseda, Tarzana, Warner Center, West Hills, Woodland Hills and west Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Ireland works for a pro-development supervisor. But he has campaigned on a 
slow-growth platform. 
</P>
<P>
"In the four years I have lived in my neighborhood, I have seen it get 
dramatically worse," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to pull back and take a strong, hard look at what the planning 
options are before we allow more to take place," he said. He advocates a halt 
to construction of any new large apartment and condominium complexes in 
single-family residential neighborhoods until development plans for each 
community can be reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Scale Back Warner Center' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid we're going to have to scale back Warner Center," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Picus responded: "We, in the West Valley, enjoy one of the lowest growth rates 
in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Ireland opposes a Picus-backed study of building of a light-rail line along 
Chandler and Victory boulevards. Instead, he favors construction of a 
light-rail line along Southern Pacific railroad tracks running diagonally 
across the Valley from Burbank to Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Ireland is also against development of an arts park in the Sepulveda Basin. 
Picus supports the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Nemo, a former teacher who sells real estate, ran against Picus in 1985 and 
finished second in a field of five with 21% of the vote. Picus won with 56%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lack of Leadership' 
</P>
<P>
Nemo has accused Picus of "a total lack of leadership on any major issue" and 
said she flip-flops on development issues, "depending on what group she is 
talking to at the moment." 
</P>
<P>
Nemo supports construction of a rail line on or along the Ventura Freeway. She 
said she would consider establishing a rubbish collection fee on single-family 
homes to raise money for additional police. 
</P>
<P>
"We are about the only major city that subsidizes trash collection," she said. 
"I think it is time that we started charging for that if that is the only way 
we can raise money to hire sufficient number of police." 
</P>
<P>
Picus supports a plan to increase the police force from the 7,677 officers to 
10,000 by 1993, but has not proposed a way to pay for the additional officers. 
However, she said she would need to "look at all the options" before 
considering a rubbish-collection charge. 
</P>
<P>
Nemo supports development of an arts park in the Sepulveda Basin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Care for Homeless 
</P>
<P>
McKellips has made caring for the homeless a major theme of his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I lived on the streets of Skid Row for two days," he said. "And I guarantee 
you there's not adequate housing." 
</P>
<P>
"We need to stop all development for a year," McKellips said. However, he said 
he supports the controversial office development proposed for the Warner Ridge, 
a hilly, 22-acre site at the eastern edge of Woodland Hills, because planning 
for the project has been under way for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather have 3,000 jobs on those 22 acres rather than 15 to 20 $800,000 
homes overlooking warehouse rooftops and air-conditioning units," he said. 
Picus said she favors construction of single-family homes on the property. 
</P>
<P>
McKellips supports the Chandler-Victory route for a light-rail line. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Failed to Settle Problem 
</P>
<P>
Rich said he decided to oppose Picus after the councilwoman failed to settle a 
problem that he was having with the Department of Water and Power. 
</P>
<P>
"I went into her office in downtown Los Angeles and they told me they were 
still looking at it," he said. "As I was walking down the hall, I bumped into 
someone and told him about my problem." The someone was Councilman Richard 
Alatorre, who resolved the problem in 48 hours, Rich said. Alatorre, however, 
has endorsed Picus. 
</P>
<P>
"I really wasn't going to run," Rich said. "My wife said, 'If you think you can 
make some changes, just do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Asked how his position on light rail differs from Picus', Rich said: "If she is 
supporting it, I'm not." He supports the use of diamond lanes on freeways, but 
only if new lanes are built. 
</P>
<P>
Rich also supports the Warner Ridge office development, conceding that "I'll 
probably lose a lot of votes" as a result. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arts Tax Criticized 
</P>
<P>
Rich said he doesn't oppose building of an arts park in the Sepulveda Basin as 
long as no public money is spent. He criticized the City Council for approving 
a 1% tax on private development to pay for the arts. 
</P>
<P>
"You got crime and gangs and everything, and here they are worried about arts," 
Rich said. "They don't have their priorities straight." 
</P>
<P>
Diamond said he decided to run after listening to his customers complain as 
they bought hot dogs. 
</P>
<P>
"You get to learn a lot selling hot dogs on the street listening to people," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond said he opposes building of a light-rail line or a subway anywhere in 
earthquake-prone Los Angeles. "What we need are mini-buses running throughout 
the Valley." He said that if elected, he would push for free bus service for 
senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"All my funds come from people on the street," he said. "I'm not supported by 
any developers."

VAN NUYS AIDS HOSPICE DEDICATED

Dick Brett, a church deacon, befriended five residents who died at Pioneer 
Home, the San Fernando Valley's first hospice for people with AIDS. But on 
Sunday, at a dedication of the 5-month-old home in Van Nuys, he and others 
spoke of hope. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hungry, and you gave me something to eat. . . . I was sick, and you 
looked after me," he said, quoting from the Bible to about 70 supporters 
gathered at the home at Haskell Avenue and Valerio Street. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Denise Eger of Temple Beth Chayim Chadashim in Los Angeles said he hoped 
for the day "when we'll never have to dedicate hospice homes, when there'll be 
a cure. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Brett, who leads AIDS support groups at Metropolitan Community Church in the 
Valley, said he has been touched by watching friendships develop between the 
residents, such as two named Michelle and Ben. "When he wasn't able to get out 
of bed, she would come visit, and when she couldn't get out of bed, she would 
yell over to him." Ben died last month, Brett said. Michelle is living with 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
The five-bed home, operated by Hospice Los Angeles/Long Beach, opened in 
November after seven months of planning and renovations, using $65,000 in 
private donations from the hospice organization and the Valley Business 
Alliance, an association of gay business people. 
</P>
<P>
Pioneer Home operates on a monthly budget of about $15,000 and has a staff of 
six. Its funding comes from Los Angeles County, private donations and medical 
insurance, Maceri said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the hospice opened, 12 residents have died, said Manager Robert Marsh. 
Residents, who have come from all over the county, are expected to live less 
than six months. 
</P>
<P>
Because AIDS victims often face rejection even by their families, more places 
like Pioneer Home are needed, said Larry Wine of Van Nuys, who volunteers for 
AIDS service groups. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Swicker, co-chairman of the Friends of Pioneer Home, said the hospice was 
a "a symbol of the coming of age of the San Fernando Valley" because the Valley 
has lacked the kind of AIDS service organizations that Los Angeles and West 
Hollywood have. 
</P>
<P>
"We shouldn't have to go over the hill for everything, including hospice care," 
he said. A hospice is to provide care in a home-like setting and allow 
residents to be as close as possible to loved ones, he said. "If you have to go 
to Hollywood, you've defeated half the purpose of a hospice." 
</P>
<P>
Hospice Los Angeles/Long Beach also has hospices in Hollywood and in Long 
Beach.

MISSING WOMAN, 77, FOUND IN SUNLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 77-year-old woman missing from a senior citizen day-care center in Sunland 
since last Tuesday has been found, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Lenore Jones, who suffers from memory loss, was found Saturday about 1:30 p.m. 
near Oro Vista Avenue and McGroarty Place in Sunland by two youths who were 
hiking, Los Angeles police Sgt. Ken Dionne said. The location is about 
three-fourths of a mile from the Canyon Senior Adult Day Care Center, from 
where Jones was reported missing.

MAN HELD IN VANDALIZING OF 6 POLICE CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A disgruntled Granada Hills man unleashed a furious attack with an ax handle on 
six Los Angeles police patrol cars Sunday night, smashing windows, headlights 
and light bars before he was subdued, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Lee Sarnecky, 25, shouted that he was angry because he had been ignored 
by front desk officers at the Los Angeles Police Department's Devonshire 
Division in the 10200 block of Etiwanda Avenue in Northridge, police said. 
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, he went to the parking lot behind the station, using an ax 
handle to dent hoods and doors and to break every window in six of the 12 
patrol cars parked there, said Connie Trout, a desk officer. 
</P>
<P>
Trout disputed the man's claim of having been ignored. "My partner and I have 
been on the front desk the whole night and he never entered the front door," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Officer John Hughes saw Sarnecky swinging the ax handle when he left the 
station about 7:15 p.m. Hughes returned for help and he and another officer 
wrestled the man to the ground, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Sarnecky was arrested on a charge of felony vandalism and was being held at the 
station in lieu of $5,000 bail.

AN UNBELIEVABLE TALE OF A FAMILY OF CARNIVAL FREAKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLYN SEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Geek Love by Katherine Dunn (Alfred A. Knopf: $18.95; 348 pages) 
</P>
<P>
First you have to imagine a carnival show, with a very lovable paterfamilias 
named Al (married to loving and tender Lillian), who, because the family's got 
to live some way, doses up his compliant wife on every horrid drug they can 
think of, so that their children won't have to learn a trade -- they'll be born 
with it, their very own "freak" career -- and the family will be able to stay 
together forever under a happy, traveling roof, an elite group of outcasts, 
journeying through the wasteland of "norms" that is heartland America. 
</P>
<P>
The narrator here is a middle child, Olympia, a nice girl who barely "made the 
cut." (Any normal children born to Lil and Al get abandoned by the roadside. 
Some of Al and Lil's kids, on the other hand, are too strange to live; they lie 
dead, floating in murky jars, where they too can be viewed for a modest fee.) 
</P>
<P>
Be that as it may, Olympia is run-of-the-mill: A hunchback Albino dwarf, bald, 
with bright red eyes. Oly's siblings include a pair of very sweet Siamese twins 
who share one torso, one set of legs, and late in the book have one enormous 
baby, Mumpo. Olympia also has a kind of thalidomide-variant older brother named 
Arturo who's made up of a torso, a pair of flippers and a very evil mind. 
Finally, she has a nice younger brother named Fortunato, or "Chick," who 
appears so "normal" that he's almost abandoned, but that would have been a big 
mistake on the part of Lil and Al, since Chick has telekinetic and healing 
powers, and is terribly nice besides. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seedy Boarding House 
</P>
<P>
The novel begins in the fictional present, when disaster has already befallen 
the traveling show. Olympia now lives in a seedy boardinghouse with her 
demented mother. Upstairs, totally unaware that the Albino dwarf she's 
acquainted with is actually her mother, Lil and Al's grandchild works as a 
stripper and lives a harmless, uneventful life. Young Miranda is beautiful and 
kind and has nothing to mark her as particularly strange except for a cute, 
curly tail. 
</P>
<P>
The plot, then, in the present, is: A large, rich, unattractive lesbian heiress 
to a fast-food fortune has been finding pretty girls and paying them to have 
their breasts removed -- to be chopped down past the essentials, as it were. 
This mean woman has almost persuaded Miranda to go along with the paring away 
procedure -- to have her tail removed. It's Olympia's God-given task to protect 
her child from this abomination. 
</P>
<P>
The large lesbian, ironically, has learned her bad tricks from a member of 
Olympia's family. The body (so to say) of "Geek Love" occurs in the past, when 
Arturo, the boy with the flippers and the bad disposition, invented a kind of 
ad-hoc religion that involved his followers getting their fingers and toes 
lopped off one at a time, then their thighs and forearms and so on, so that 
they might live, finally, in a nursing home with just their torso and head, in 
a state of P.I.P. ("Peace, Isolation and Purity"). Obviously, in the long run, 
no good could come of this, which is one reason Olympia lives away in that 
boardinghouse with her mother and daughter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Imitates Nathanael West 
</P>
<P>
The material here is straight Nathanael West: "Geek Love" is, in a sense, an 
uneasy marriage of West's "Miss Lonelyhearts" and "A Cool Million, or, the 
Dismantling of Lemuel Pitkin." The tone is something else: That a "freak" can 
experience love as well as a "norm" may be one message here -- except that 
Arturo is certainly the meanest freak who ever came down the pike. Another 
theme has to do with completion: How many body parts does it take to make a 
genuine human? 
</P>
<P>
I had a lot of trouble with this book -- although Katherine Dunn is a powerful 
and interesting writer. "Geek Love" is too long, too obviously derivative, and 
I had trouble believing all those "freaks" in the first place. Their souls, as 
well as their bodies, seemed out of kilter. I didn't believe the twins, or 
Arturo, or Lil or Al. And isn't that the first requirement of any carnival -- 
that the customer believe the glittery, murky life that, half-shaded, goes on 
behind the soiled curtains of the side show?

ON YOUR OWN: HOW TO BREAK AN ADDICTION TO A PERSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. HOWARD HALPERN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The following is a letter from a 32-year-old high-school teacher: 
</P>
<P>
"After four years I have finally ended (I hope) a very destructive relationship 
with my boyfriend. I knew Rod was bad for me -- he was untrustworthy, critical, 
mean and verbally abusive, but I couldn't get myself to leave him. I felt 
intensely in love with him, and when I would try to break it off, I would be 
miserable, panicky and would get physically sick. Despite resolving never to 
see him again, in a few days or weeks I'd call him. 
</P>
<P>
"What finally made me end it was watching Hedda Nussbaum describe the awful 
treatment she received from Joel Steinberg. Every time this horribly battered 
woman was asked why she stayed with him, she said that it was because she loved 
him. Rod never physically struck me, but the battering with words and the bad 
treatment that I suffered were too humiliating to write about. When I realized 
that I was just like Hedda, I thought: 'This is it. If I don't end it now, I am 
going down the drain.' 
</P>
<P>
"Despite all that, it's been hard to keep from calling him. I am terrified that 
I will weaken and that I will allow the whole cycle of abuse to start all over 
again. Is there something that I can tell myself that will make this period any 
easier?" 
</P>
<P>
The first thing that you need to realize is that you -- like many other men and 
women in similar situations -- are suffering from an addiction to this person. 
I mean that literally -- like an addiction to nicotine, alcohol or any other 
drug. Your addiction is rooted in feelings of insecurity, emptiness or 
inadequacy; and the belief that your connection to Rod is the only remedy for 
those feelings. He is your fix. Just as surely as a coke addict feels the need 
for cocaine, you feel the need for Rod. You are now going through withdrawal 
symptoms that can be as painful and debilitating as withdrawal from a 
substance. You have the same desire to reconnect as any addict has. 
</P>
<P>
In my book "How to Break Your Addiction to a Person" (Bantam: 1983) I call this 
powerful need to connect and remain connected "Attachment Hunger." It is a need 
that we all have as babies and that remains with us to some degree ever after. 
When our Attachment Hunger for a person is so strong that it overrides our 
judgment about what's in our own best interest, we become addicted. That's what 
happened with you and Rod -- your Attachment Hunger kept you there despite your 
knowledge that the relationship was harmful to you. Instead of feeling that 
without Rod you're a lost nobody, you have to begin to strengthen and expand 
your sense of your own growth and completeness as an individual. 
</P>
<P>
You ask what you can tell yourself to make this withdrawal period easier. In 
"How to Break Your Addiction to a Person" I list 25 "Addiction-Breaking 
Aphorisms." Here are a few of them: 
</P>
<P>
 -- You can live without this person (probably better). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Love is not enough (to make a good love relationship). 
</P>
<P>
 -- The intensity of your withdrawal symptoms does not indicate the strength of 
your love but the strength of your addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 -- You are a whole and valuable person apart from the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When you feel inadequate, incomplete or worthless apart from this person, 
it is a sign that childhood feelings are taking over. 
</P>
<P>
 -- This person is not the "one and only." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The pain of ending it won't last nearly as long as the pain of not ending 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If you end this bad relationship, you will be opening your life to new 
possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
There are several other things that you can do to get through this difficult 
period: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Write down all of the reasons that you decided to end the relationship, 
including as many instances as you can remember that made you feel demeaned, 
furious or depressed. During withdrawal it is easy to get what I call 
"Addiction Amnesia," a sort of nostalgia in which you forget all the bad and 
remember only the good. So whenever you feel the urge to get in touch with him, 
look at your record of unhappy events to remind yourself of why you ended the 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tell a friend or friends who you can count on for support that you are 
trying to break your addiction to Rod, and ask them to help you if you call. 
Then, when you are tempted to call Rod, call your friends instead and let them 
tell you why you shouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Get involved in activities that you enjoy. Do things that make you feel 
good about yourself and that you may have put off or suspended because you were 
so involved with Rod. Rediscover that the world is bigger than just your narrow 
preoccupation with this one person.

NEWMAN -- SERIOUS NOTE IN HIS IRONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Look up ironic in the dictionary and you'll find a picture of Randy Newman. 
Such is the quintessence of this singer-songwriter's picture-perfect brand of 
pungent wit that so waggishly defines the word. 
</P>
<P>
All right, so there's no such picture of Newman there. But where could Webster 
find a more illustrative model? 
</P>
<P>
Ponder the fact that Newman's chant-along anthem, "I Love L.A.," has seemingly 
become as integral a part of our culture as "The Star-Spangled Banner," 
recitable at will by most any local between 16 and 42, and the thing about it 
is there's not a sincere line in the song. 
</P>
<P>
Given his penchant for springing out of his verses with unsettling punch lines 
like a brilliantly perverse jack-in-the-box, Newman is the ideal choice for an 
April Fools' Day night out. An infrequent performer who tours sans band, he 
played one in a series of Southern California solo shows at the Coach House in 
San Juan Capistrano on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
As the Randy One himself is prone to point out, even his more serious 
compositions (especially the serious ones, it would seem) almost always have at 
least one or two key lines that act as an "escape clause," which adds an extra 
-- usually unpleasant -- layer of meaning to the proceedings. If he wasn't busy 
accompanying himself as pianist, he'd probably sing with his fingers crossed 
behind his back. 
</P>
<P>
At the Coach House, it was predictably Newman's most obvious barbs that went 
over the best with the sell-out crowd: laugh-out-loud looks at racism 
("Rednecks," "Roll With the Punches"), bigotry ("Short People"), depersonalized 
sex ("You Can Leave Your Hat On"), reactionary nihilism ("Political Science") 
and even spoiled rock stars not unlike Randy Newman ("My Life Is Good"). 
</P>
<P>
At times, the show had all the hallmarks of a Mark Russell concert, with a few 
hundred of the presumably politically correct chuckling themselves silly at 
familiar, intimately framed music-hall-style satire. 
</P>
<P>
Even during classics like 1972's hilarious "God's Song" -- a bitter 
fist-shaking at an empty cosmos that beat XTC's "Dear God" to the punch by 15 
years -- attendees chortled as if hearing all the funny lines for the first 
time. (Perhaps many of them were, which would explain why, when asked to sing 
along with his 1977 "Rider in the Rain," about a third seemed to be singing 
"Rider on the Range.") 
</P>
<P>
But with Newman, it's the songs at which an audience doesn't laugh out loud 
that linger the longest. 
</P>
<P>
Among the highlights Saturday was "Baltimore," a narrative so relentlessly 
depressive it's easy to understand how a resident of that city could consider 
it an act of war on Newman's part. 
</P>
<P>
His piano lines -- informed by classical as well as jazz, blues and pop 
influences -- are usually as formally elegant as his verses tend to be profane. 
And never did he find a more haunting melody than in the escalating riffs 
underlining this down-and-out ditty, capped by one of his simplest and least 
satirically charged sentiments: "Man, it's hard just to live." 
</P>
<P>
If that song was grim, Newman had two more -- both from his latest album, "Land 
of Dreams" -- that were positively scary. The ominous, vaguely murderous "Bad 
News From Home" produced a palpable hush among the otherwise cheerful crowd. 
Sample lines: "You can run but you can't hide / You said you love me but I know 
you lied." 
</P>
<P>
It's easier to find a lighter side in "I Want You to Hurt Like I Do," which the 
singer introduced as his "We Are the World." ("Michael Jackson would sing this 
here," he interjected during one verse.) A couple of Coach House patrons got a 
laugh out of Newman himself by getting into the anthem-ish spirit and swaying 
their arms in the air. But even the obviousness of the sarcasm doesn't disguise 
the fact that this is as self-consciously angry a song as it's possible to pen. 
</P>
<P>
If Newman seems susceptible to succumbing to his role as Rock's Premiere Funny 
Guy by running old novelty faves up the flag pole each time he performs, in the 
end he's capable of throwing enough curve balls to keep the inattentive alert. 
Introducing "Political Science" -- a gleeful paean to nuclear annihilation -- 
he quipped, "I played this in Europe and they thought it was a joke." The real 
April Fools' gag may be that Newman is so much more serious than even many of 
his fans know. 
</P>
<P>
Side note: Bemoaning a supposed lack of stardom, Newman noted: "I've come a 
long way from the Troubador 15 years ago. I'm playing at another Troubador 60 
miles south." The man doth protest too much; Aug. 26 finds him booked at the 
Universal Amphitheatre. Meanwhile, Newman -- who appeared Friday at the Ventura 
Theatre in Ventura and was due again Sunday at the Coach House -- headlines the 
Bacchanal in San Diego tonight and Tuesday.

Ella Fitzgerald, who will celebrate her 71st birthday April 25, will be honored 
April 28 in a gala tribute at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. Bill Cosby will host 
the event, which will raise funds for the Society of Singers, an organization 
launched in 1984 to offer financial and other assistance to singers in need. 
Among the performers set to participate are Mel Torme, Joe Williams, Dionne 
Warwick, George Shearing, the Pointer Sisters, Manhattan Transfer, Patti 
Austin, Carol Burnett, the Frank Capp/Nat Pierce Juggernaut big band, and an 
all-star jazz group led by the saxophonist Benny Carter, who discovered 
Fitzgerald when she was 15. During the evening the first of a series of annual 
trophies honoring lifetime achievements, to be known as "The Ellas," will be 
awarded. The first recipient will be Ella Fitzgerald herself; the award is 
tentatively set to be presented by Clint Eastwood. ALEENE MacMINN and Claudia

The Netherlands is trying to organize the largest exhibition ever of Vincent 
van Gogh's paintings next year to mark the 100th anniversary of his death. The 
Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, with approximately 200 Van Goghs in its own 
storerooms, is planning to borrow at least 120 others from abroad worth an 
estimated $3 billion. The Kroeller-Mueller Museum in Otterlo, 55 miles east of 
Amsterdam, and from which two Van Goghs were stolen last December, will exhibit 
at least 230 drawings flown in from all over the world. Organizer Frits Becht 
said security would be massive during the four-month exhibition that is to end 
July 30, 1990, the centenary anniversary of the Dutch painter's death. ALEENE

The Glasnost Film Festival, a package of 22 Soviet documentary films said to be 
uncensored and covering such themes as the Afghanistan war, Stalin's 
repressions, the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, alcoholism, religion and women's 
rights, is making its way across the United States. Playing on campuses and in 
art film theaters, the project is designed to provide Americans with a candid 
view of life in the Soviet Union. The festival previewed in Washington where 
"the audience could not believe what they were seeing -- that Russians could 
make such documentaries," said tour coordinator Michael Brainerd of the Citizen 
Exchange Council. The tour will end at UC Santa Barbara on May 5, and includes 
a stop in Los Angeles on May 1. ALEENE MacMINN and Claudia Puig

KHJ-TV Channel 9's weatherman Andrew Amador has been fired after six years on 
the air. Amador said that the parting came "as a shock" but he described it as 
amicable and said he received a "nice severance." Until Friday, Channel 9 had 
been the only local independent station to still use a weatherperson on its 
newscast, and news director Stephanie Rank Brady said that the station had 
decided to go without a weatherman for the time being. Channels 5, 11 and 13 
currently have one of their anchors give the weather forecast. For now, Channel 
9 will do the same. ALEENE MacMINN and Claudia Puig

LOVE IS ON THE RUN IN CORMAN'S 'CRIME ZONE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The love-on-the-run couple of the low-budget science-fiction melodrama, "Crime 
Zone" (citywide) are an ex-cop and and a hooker (Peter Nelson and Sherilyn 
Fenn) from a state-supported pleasure palace. And, though the movie probably 
didn't cost much, producer-director Luis Llosa and his designers try for a 
"Blade Runner" ambiance, wreathing the scenes in smoke and neon, purple glare 
and blue sizzle. 
</P>
<P>
In this film noir, science-fiction hell, everyone is manipulated, everything is 
a lie. The fugitive lovers, duped into a life of crime by a mysterious 
cigar-smoking smoothie (David Carradine), are "sub-grades," lower-class lumpen. 
They're trapped in the ultimate post-Holocaust fascist state: a city of night, 
where private sex is verboten and all criminals are given public electronic 
crucifixions on TV. Some sort of perpetual war is going on with an outside 
enemy state, but no one experiences everything directly. They're jammed up into 
rotting, dark tenements and they get everything secondhand, on TV, in 
bordellos, in electronic pool halls with neon tables and cues. 
</P>
<P>
It's another example of science fiction commenting on joyless or awful aspects 
of the present. Writer Daryl Chaney uses the usual rat-in-the-maze plot 
structure of these dystopian melodramas and Llosa keeps things racing along in 
a grim, punchy way, but the characters lack humor or life. As in many such 
stories about people fighting for their individuality in a mechanical future 
hell, robots seem to have taken over the character psychology. 
</P>
<P>
But, anytime a Z-budget thriller like "Crime Zone" (MPAA rated R for sex, 
violence, partial nudity and language) tries to make itself look like "Blade 
Runner," you have to applaud it for chutzpah. Executive producer Roger Corman 
is a past master at stretching a dollar, and the plucky Llosa and his 
production team keep everything in the dark, concentrating on the edges of 
rooms, bathed in colored swirls and splays of light. If they don't exactly 
triumph over the material and budget, at least they manage to stay in the 
ring.MICHAEL WILMINGTON

BALINESE DANCE TROUPE PERFORMS IN PASADENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Translations would have helped the unenlightened Westerner better appreciate 
the Dancers and Musicians of Bali presented by the Ambassador International 
Cultural Foundation at Pasadena Civic Auditorium on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The long, closing dramatic stretch in particular left a non-Balinese speaker 
with little to take in other than the striking, colorful, opulent costumes of 
the characters. 
</P>
<P>
But with at least one character courting or perhaps telling jokes to the 
audience, the experience must have been equally frustrating to the players who 
probably are used to more interaction or immediate response at home. 
</P>
<P>
For all its sinuous mirror images unfolding in leisurely, expansive time, even 
the dance-drama "Legon Keraton" evoked similar moments of frustration. The 
story was related by an (amplified) offstage singer taking various roles with 
effective throaty, hoarse and nasal chantings, as well as battle sounds a la 
Victor Borge. 
</P>
<P>
One got the impression that this was not arcane art intended to be remote from 
everyday people, as it turned out for many in the theater. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there were many moments to savor in watching the dancers so skillfully 
execute the distinctive Balinese style -- torsos twisted angularly, arms held 
in asymmetrical positions, fingers flexed outward, hands shimmering, eyes 
darting, bodies sinking from raised-toes to crouches close to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Westerners somewhat familiar with gamelan music got a few surprises. The brief 
opening instrumental piece revealed unexpected close-tone dissonances, 
call-and-response sequences and short, apparently discontinuous sections. CHRIS 
PASLES

CHAMBER VIRTUOSI SERIES' FINAL CONCERT OF SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Henri Temianka's California Chamber Virtuosi series at Pepperdine University, 
Malibu, ended its latest season Saturday night with adept musicianship and 
programming. The concert offered three substantial French pieces from the late 
Romantic era in celebration of the bicentennial of the French Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by the red, white and blue flags of both the United States and 
France, Temianka announced the program from the stage, giving lengthy 
descriptions of Paris and the close circle of composers there. His sweeping 
opinions sometimes startled. Less often, spurious information tended to detract 
from Temianka's charm, which otherwise helped to hold the audience's interest. 
</P>
<P>
Violinist Sergiu Schwartz and pianist Steven Gayer highlighted the evening with 
a mesmerizing performance of Cesar Franck's Violin Sonata. Phrases were 
carefully wrought and delivered with delicacy and warmth. 
</P>
<P>
In Franck's Piano Quintet, Michael Markman, violin; Donald McInnes, viola, and 
Timothy Landauer, cello, joined Schwartz and Mayer in a deft performance that 
romped fittingly. An equally fine performance of Debussy's Violin Sonata 
completed the program. GREGG WAGER

'RIDING THE EDGE' PACKS ACTION WITH ITS SILLINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About the nicest thing to be said about "Riding the Edge" (opened citywide 
Friday), another silly saga of an American teen going off to arid climes to 
rescue his dad from terrorists, is that it manages to avoid perpetuating at 
least half of the standard stereotypes about people of the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Not that it goes out of its way to present a positive or realistic view of the 
North African region or that there's much on screen to indicate that the film 
makers ever read about, much less visited, the picture's locale before setting 
it there. 
</P>
<P>
The father in peril this time is an engineer kidnaped from his research lab 
literally seconds after making a revolutionary advance in solar power. His 
competitors in the field give new meaning to the words hostile takeover and 
demand that their hostage's adventure-loving son be flown over from California 
to deliver the all-important microchip in person. 
</P>
<P>
Sonny would rather do things his way than the authorities', however, and takes 
off across the Sahara alone on his motorbike in search of pop, eventually with 
help from a beautiful American gal versed in martial arts and a cheerful, 
English-speaking local kid right out of "Rambo III." 
</P>
<P>
As the spunky love interest, Catherine Mary Stewart helps lend the low-budget 
project what measure of professionalism it has. As the equally handsome male 
lead, Raphael Sbarge pouts madly and looks and acts, as the Stewart character 
duly notes, like someone in urgent need of a spanking. 
</P>
<P>
Before tedium takes over entirely, two early scenes stand out: a motorcycle 
race through the gutted remains of Palos Verdes' Marineland, a sad sight 
indeed; and probably a first in motion picture history: a ransom note delivered 
by fax. 
</P>
<P>
For all its violence, "Riding the Edge" is relatively wholesome kiddie matinee 
fare at best, which makes it all the more curious why one single, 
out-of-character nasty word seems to have been thrown in solely to ensure an R 
rating. CHRIS WILLMAN

TAKES ON BRADLEY IN MAYORAL RACE; 
</P>
<P>
IN THE RING OR IN POLITICS, HOLDEN LOVES A FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY, Times City-County Bureau Chief 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To understand City Councilman Nate Holden's decision to run for mayor of Los 
Angeles, go back to 1945 to a gym in Elizabeth, N.J., when he was 16 and a 
novice boxer. 
</P>
<P>
"They had this black guy who looked like he weighed about, I guess about 200 
pounds, and I weighed about 167," Holden said. "They said, 'Can you beat this 
guy?' I said, 'Yeah, I can beat him.' I was watching the way he walked. Sized 
him up. So, they say, 'OK, you're on.' But instead of me fighting the black 
guy, they put me on with the champion, who was an Italian guy. In an Italian 
town." 
</P>
<P>
Those who have experienced the ferocity of ethnic fight fans and seen their 
hysteria influence referees and judges know the mischievousness of the 
double-cross inflicted on Holden. The only way a black fighter could have won 
that fight, in an arena filled with Italians, was to knock out his opponent. 
</P>
<P>
"So I went in and knocked him out, and they booed me." 
</P>
<P>
The story tells much about Nathan Nathaniel Holden, 59, a tall, gray-haired, 
dignified-looking man in a nicely conservative suit, a city councilman since 
1987 and a state senator from 1974 to 1978. 
</P>
<P>
This is a man who does not avoid a fight. In fact, he looks for one. After four 
years in a state Senate seat so safe he had virtually a lifetime job, he gave 
up Sacramento to enter a crowded Democratic primary for a congressional seat 
ultimately won by Julian C. Dixon. He has run for office eight times in the 
last 22 years, winning only twice. 
</P>
<P>
So when Holden decided to run against the heavily favored Mayor Tom Bradley 
this year, it came as no surprise to those who have watched Holden's frequent 
entrances into the political wars of Los Angeles, particularly those in the 
predominantly black South-Central and Southwestern sections -- his base. 
</P>
<P>
"Nate has a habit of going out and running for things before he has tested the 
waters of the office he holds," said Bradley supporter Ted Watkins of the Watts 
Labor Community Action Committee. 
</P>
<P>
As he showed that day in the New Jersey ring, Holden loves a fight. When City 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky looked at the polls, concluded that Bradley was 
unbeatable and pulled out, Holden jumped in. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Holden is ambitious. Critics have said that what he is really doing 
this year is getting publicity to help him run for Los Angeles County 
supervisor if Kenneth Hahn ever decides to retire from his South-Central, 
Southwestern Los Angeles seat. 
</P>
<P>
Untrue, Holden said. "My true motive is that, as I've said, is to challenge Tom 
Bradley, and to be the vehicle for the people who are unhappy with the way this 
government has been run the past 16 years." 
</P>
<P>
And he has been challenging since he joined the council. Where Bradley welcomes 
foreign investment in America, Holden has backed resolutions urging Congress to 
pass laws requiring restrictions on it. Holden has been a consistent critic of 
Bradley's housing authority. He introduced a resolution calling for an 
investigation of Bradley's personal finances. And he has accused the mayor of 
failing to provide Los Angeles police with enough narcotics investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this record of combat, Holden is a gentle, considerate, compassionate 
person much of the time. One day in City Hall he told his life story to a 
reporter. It was a richly anecdotal story of a black man, guided by a strong 
mother and good friends, in a slow, steady climb from a cold-water flat in 
Elizabeth. He remembered the names of friends who helped. 
</P>
<P>
But he also remembered the names of those who did not help. That is the other 
Nate Holden. Insults, harangues, orders, threats of revenge and promises of 
punishment erupt when he perceives that someone has crossed him. 
</P>
<P>
The nice Nate: 
</P>
<P>
Council President John Ferraro recalled the night that he and his wife, 
Margaret, who had suffered a stroke, were going to a dinner at the Century 
Plaza. "We were walking slowly. Margaret walked slowly," Ferraro said. "He 
(Holden) came over to help and he hovered over her like a bear hovers over a 
baby. The next morning he called me and said, 'John, I know what you are going 
through.' (Holden's mother had suffered a stroke.) Margaret loves the guy. He 
is gruff and he is rough, but he has a big heart." 
</P>
<P>
The mean Nate: 
</P>
<P>
Soon after his election to the council, Holden went over to Queen Anne Park, a 
city park in his district. It was a mess. On his car phone, he called the 
office of Recreation and Parks Director James Hadaway. Hadaway was not there. 
Holden ordered Hadaway's assistant to the park immediately. "You've got to be a 
little rough to get a response," he said. "They know who I am now." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores said she once saw Holden marking the name of 
everybody who went against him on a City Council vote. "It shows the 
vindictiveness that I don't think we have room for or that should be present on 
the council floor," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's often very difficult," said City Councilman Marvin Braude. "He has his 
own agenda. He takes off on city administrators. The assumption is they are 
always suspect. That's not always bad, but it depends on how it is done. If he 
can't get his own way, he has a strong tendency to blame the city 
administrators. . . . But he's learning. . . . I think he is less brusque, less 
demanding." 
</P>
<P>
The mean side comes directly from the young man in the ring, the victim of the 
double-cross. 
</P>
<P>
Even Holden seems aware of how difficult he can be. After post-World War II 
service in the Army military police in Germany, he said, it took him a long 
time "to adjust into civilian life. I guess I really never did." 
</P>
<P>
"What do you mean?" an interviewer asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, the aggressiveness," he said. " Toughness. Competitiveness. The 
competitive spirit is still there. You know, when they train you in the 
military, that's what you have to be. And you're gung ho. And I was." 
</P>
<P>
A hostile toughness comes out when he discusses the way black leaders refused 
to back him in unsuccessful races for Congress and in his election to the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
"They never helped me," he said, scowling at the memory. "Black voters got to 
know they could trust me, but the leaders, the black elected officials, didn't 
want a new guy on the block." 
</P>
<P>
Yet he persevered and, like young Holden the boxer, got his revenge. Ignored by 
big businesses and lobbyists who finance city politics when he ran against 
Bradley's choice for City Council in 1987, Holden won anyway. Once on the 
council, Holden played the political game skillfully. He immediately joined the 
winning side in a fight for the council presidency. The winner, John Ferraro, 
gave him an important committee chairmanship. And Holden cooly tapped those 
businesses who had brushed him off in the election. This time they gave, up to 
$5,000 in some cases. 
</P>
<P>
"Take from the rich, give to the poor," Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me 'you can't be the councilman,' City Hall is against me," he said 
one Sunday as he spoke at Southern Missionary Baptist Church. "Well, who is the 
councilman today? They said 'you can't be mayor.' City Hall is against me. God 
is with me." 
</P>
<P>
The end of this campaign is all furious motion, directed by Holden, alone, off 
the top of his head. Campaign headquarters is his car; the campaign 
communications network, his car phone. Calling press conferences, introducing 
resolutions demanding investigations of Bradley's fiscal affairs, phoning 
reporters from his car with tips. Holden is muscling himself onto the 
television screens and into the newspapers in the campaign's final days. 
</P>
<P>
That has been his tactic since the beginning of his campaign. His offer, early 
in the year, to pay $300 for every assault rifle turned in to him sent him onto 
the pages of People magazine. The money came from the campaign funds he raised 
from businesses after his election. 
</P>
<P>
The experts consider him a sure loser. Professional pollsters believe the race 
to be so one-sided that they have ignored it. 
</P>
<P>
But as he visits South-Central Los Angeles churches and appears before 
audiences of far less than 100 in San Fernando Valley mayoral candidates 
forums, Holden presents a slight, but troubling, threat to a mayor who wants to 
roll up a huge victory margin. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives the people who are outright hostile to the mayor a place to go," 
Braude said. "I think this is misguided. He (Bradley) deserves election. But it 
is a chance for Nate to sort of capture all the built-in, inevitable hostility 
to a mayor who has been in office four terms." 
</P>
<P>
To guard against the dangers presented by Holden and the other candidates, 
Bradley is planning to invest money from his substantial campaign treasury in a 
strong Election Day get-out-the vote drive. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign manager Christopher Humes said workers using between 50 and 70 
telephones will call registered voters. Mailings will be sent to potential 
Bradley supporters under the supervision of Richard Ross, one of the state 
Democratic Party's best-known direct-mail specialists. Neighborhood campaign 
offices have been set up, including three in South Los Angeles, a major part of 
Bradley's political base. 
</P>
<P>
And that is the area where Holden is directing his message most clearly and 
emotionally. He has emerged as a spokesman of the poor and middle class of 
South-Central and Southwestern Los Angeles, particularly of the working people 
who go to church on Sunday and mourn the deaths of children to drugs and gang 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
That message came through clearly on a Sunday at Greater Bethany Community 
Church at 8406 S. Hoover Ave., in a working- class area once all black, but 
becoming more Latino. As the Rev. Robert W. McMurray spoke to the congregation, 
a Latino man and woman baptized a man in the rear of the altar area. They were 
among the growing number of Latino congregants in the church. 
</P>
<P>
"Our neighborhood was mostly white at one time," McMurray said. "Then the 
blacks moved in and integrated it. Now the Hispanics. We're not moving. We're 
here to stay. . . . We hope we have a Hispanic congregation as large as this 
one. . . . They will interrupt our service any time (for baptism). It is the 
pause that refreshes." 
</P>
<P>
Later in his sermon, McMurray spoke of another reality, gangs in the territory 
of several "sets" of the Hoover Crips. How many gang veterans were at the 
service? he asked. Twelve young men stood up. 
</P>
<P>
Holden, who spends each Sunday visiting South-Central Los Angeles churches, 
spoke to the congregation. 
</P>
<P>
"Praise the Lord," he said. "Power from above. 
</P>
<P>
"We need problems solved all over our city," he said. "Something is wrong. But 
God is not going to revisit the place." 
</P>
<P>
As for his own campaign, "We are not running against anyone. We are running for 
an office, to change the city, to turn it around. . . . Sometimes you've just 
got to change. 
</P>
<P>
"I am going to do the Lord's work in City Hall." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Feverish Pursuit 
</P>
<P>
He pursues that goal with an intensity that contrasts strongly with Bradley's 
confident election-year stroll through the city. 
</P>
<P>
Before speaking at the church, Holden stopped for breakfast at Kite's, a 
popular restaurant on South Vermont Avenue, where busy waiters serve hot plates 
filled with spicy sausages, ham, bacon, eggs, grits and biscuits with gravy. 
Many of the patrons, black women, men and children, gave him a friendly "hello" 
as he walked to his table. 
</P>
<P>
But just as his sausages and eggs were served, a waiter brought him a note. 
"Mr. Holden," it said, "I was going to vote for you, but you shook every hand 
but mine. I am white." 
</P>
<P>
Holden got up. "Where is the guy?" he asked the waiter. The waiter pointed to 
the front of the restaurant. Holden walked quickly through the place, looking 
for a white face. He was glum when he came back. The man had left. 
</P>
<P>
"The worse thing I did this morning was I didn't shake that guy's hand," he 
said. During the day, he kept bringing it up, saying that he would have to go 
back to Kite's on Monday and try to find the man. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kenny Hahn Style 
</P>
<P>
The attention to the parks, the worry about every vote, is politics Kenny Hahn 
style. That is Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, Holden's mentor, the 
white Southern Baptist who has represented the largely black area running from 
expensive Windsor Hills east to Watts and Willowbrook for three decades. The 
Hahn method? Fix every pothole, build parks and swimming pools and health 
centers, put in street lights, reflect the religious and family values that 
guide the area's many churches and working-class families. 
</P>
<P>
Holden was Hahn's deputy for many years. "I think Nate is really 
constituent-oriented, and has a lot of concern about community groups and he 
learned that from Kenny Hahn, who works things the same way," Ferraro said. 
"And that is the way you stay in office, taking care of constituents." 
</P>
<P>
As Holden drives around his district, checking the parks, the street cleaning, 
growing angry about the potholes, he often stops and talks to his constituents. 
</P>
<P>
He is comfortable with them, as if they were neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
A woman told Holden that dealers were selling drugs outside her house. He 
listened understandingly and talked comfortably with the woman. 
</P>
<P>
"Take down her name, Mr. Massey," he told aide Ira Massey. At a church, Holden 
saw a man, and called him over. "Mr. Bradley (not the mayor,), how are you?" 
Holden asked. " I heard you last week talking about scholarships. I'll give you 
a thousand bucks." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grew Up With Them 
</P>
<P>
These are the kind of working-class people with whom Holden grew up. 
</P>
<P>
He was born in Macon, Ga. His neighborhood was racially mixed. "Even in the 
South, we had a mixed neighborhood where the whites and blacks kind of lived on 
the street and around the corner," he said. "A neighborhood where everyone was 
in the same class. Nobody was rich." 
</P>
<P>
His father was a brakeman in the Central of Georgia railroad yards. "I loved my 
dad," Holden said. "You know when he worked for the railroad, they used to go 
out there and they'd work and they'd have a certain odor because you're down 
there with that grease and diesels and so on. But his dirty shoes I even 
loved." 
</P>
<P>
When he was 10, his parents separated and his mother moved him and his brothers 
to Elizabeth, N.J., where his grandmother lived. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a mixed neighborhood, again," he said. "We lived there mostly with 
Italians and Polish people and Irish people." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shower at the Gym 
</P>
<P>
"My mother, she started working in a bakery, and then she started working for 
Singer Sewing Machine Co. We're at '41 and '42. She went for the defense 
industry. . . . Then we moved to a two-story place, little bigger, little 
better, still a cold-water flat. You had to heat your water. Of course, you 
could always get a shower at school, in the gym." 
</P>
<P>
After Holden was disqualified from boxing because he had fought as a 
professional, he joined the Army in 1946, lying about his age. "I had wanted to 
join when the war was going on," he said. "At 14, I first registered for the 
draft and I couldn't go because they discovered I was too young. I wanted to 
get into the military and get some basic training and take advantage of the GI 
Bill when I got out of the military. It was an opportunity for me." 
</P>
<P>
Holden wanted to be a designer, or an engineer, even when he was in junior high 
school. There, he said, "I was the best in the class in drafting. But this 
teacher gave me a rough time. At that time, a black could not get a job as a 
draftsman. So he was discouraging me. I knew he was trying to break my spirit 
so I wouldn't let him. He gave me a C and I transferred to another school and 
that teacher was just the opposite. He was fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
After Holden's military discharge, he finished high school and studied design 
and engineering at night. He worked for Bell Laboratories in New Jersey, and 
then moved West. Over the years, he said, he worked on the technical staff of 
several aerospace companies, including Hughes and Litton Industries. 
</P>
<P>
But politics became more of an interest. He joined the Alta Loma Democratic 
Club, part of the California Democratic Council, a grass-roots group of liberal 
reformers that had great influence in party affairs in the late 1950s and 
1960s. As the Vietnam War ripped the party apart, Holden joined the opposition 
to the war. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Draining Resources 
</P>
<P>
"The war was draining all the resources that were needed in order to rebuild 
the inner cities," he said. "There was a war in which everyone accepted the 
fact that we could not win and did not belong in. Everybody agrees to that fact 
now. I felt people should have the right to self-determination." 
</P>
<P>
In 1968, he ran and lost for Congress as an anti-war candidate. He became 
president of the California Democratic Council in 1970 and, over the year, made 
two more runs for Congress. Once, he said, black leadership betrayed him when 
he ran and lost against a white congressman. Then, in his race against now-Rep. 
Dixon (D-Los Angeles), white and black Democratic leaders in Sacramento 
double-crossed him, he said, by breaking a promise to stay neutral. 
</P>
<P>
All of that history, and bouncing back from all of those defeats, gives Holden 
a certain stability as he campaigns. He is intense, without the wild-eyed 
desperation of some other long-shot candidates. Some days, he seems down, when 
the press has not responded to his latest offering, and television or the 
newspapers have a story on Bradley. But a quick shot on the television news, or 
a story in the papers, cheers him up and he is on his one-vote-at-a-time way. 
</P>
<P>
One day, watching his boss work at that sort of politics, his aide, Ira Massey, 
advised, "Keep pecking away.' 
</P>
<P>
"Peck, peck, peck, peck," Holden replied.

OIL SPILL INTENSIFIES DEBATE ON DRILLING PERIL TO CARIBOU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD WOUTAT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The troubles faced by the fish and birds in Alaska's Prince William Sound 
because of the March 24 oil spill have intensified a debate on the future of 
about 180,000 caribou that wander the tundra about 800 miles to the north. 
</P>
<P>
That is where the oil industry wants to extend its search for oil -- and where 
environmentalists have planted a stake in the ground. Both sides say that the 
issue has been catapulted to the top of the environmental agenda in Congress by 
the recent oil disaster. 
</P>
<P>
A classic policy battle even before the accident off the port of Valdez, the 
argument is portrayed by the two sides in almost cosmic terms: the survival of 
North America's last complete ecosystem versus the nation's last best hope for 
another world-class oil field to protect the national security. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is the coastal plain of Alaska National Wildlife Refuge in northeast 
Alaska, a strip of land 100 miles wide by 18 to 40 miles deep that lies between 
the Beaufort Sea and the northernmost foothills of Alaska's Brooks Range. The 
coastal plain takes up 1.5 million acres of the 19-million-acre refuge. 
</P>
<P>
Congress must approve any commercial activity in the refuge and one of three 
bills on the issue -- opening the plain up for development -- was approved 12 
to 7 last month by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. It is 
sponsored by Sens. J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.), chairman of the committee, and 
the ranking minority member of the panel, Sen. James A. McClure (R-Ida.). 
</P>
<P>
The oil industry's supporters, including President Bush, insisted last week 
that it is illogical to link the tanker spill with the safety of oil drilling. 
Most of the nation's crude oil arrives by tanker and that will not change 
regardless of what development takes place in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
If oil were found on the coastal plain, it probably would enter production in 
10 years. With Prudhoe Bay production already entering its natural decline, the 
new oil would supplant it, prolonging rather than increasing the tanker traffic 
from Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not related," declared Walter J. Hickel, the former Interior secretary 
and ex-governor of Alaska who has long advocated the development of the state's 
rich resources. "The wildlife refuge is a drilling problem and Valdez is a 
tanker problem. But from a perception standpoint, I can well understand that 
it's going to be a problem." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Highlights Risks 
</P>
<P>
Opponents see the oil spill as a powerful argument to sway undecided lawmakers 
because it highlights the risks of the oil system versus the advantages of 
energy conservation or the development of cleaner forms of energy. 
</P>
<P>
Critics also said that the apparent snafus that both caused and followed the 
spill have seriously weakened the credibility of the oil industry, which has 
boasted until now of having operated in the Arctic for 20 years and produced 6 
billion barrels of crude oil without environmental disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"For days, everybody in the nation has been bombarded with these images from 
Valdez," said John Katz, the head of the state of Alaska's Washington office. 
"The oil spill is going to have a profound influence on decision-making in 
Washington." 
</P>
<P>
At a minimum, the spill could generate support for additional delays or for 
linkage of any congressional action opening up the refuge to such 
conservationist goals as tougher fuel economy standards for cars. 
</P>
<P>
"This dramatic spill will finally get the attention of a lot of people who 
haven't looked at it very hard until now," said former Sen. Gaylord Nelson 
(D-Wis.), an adviser to the Wilderness Society in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"We may very well have the votes, as a result of this, to at least refer it to 
the National Academy of Science for study." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Raises Questions 
</P>
<P>
Said an aide to Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez), whose Interior subcommittee 
has jurisdiction over all three pending House bills on the refuge: "Nobody's 
going to say: 'I changed my mind because of the spill.' But this raises a lot 
of questions about development. This is a major political event in addition to 
an ecological event." 
</P>
<P>
The refuge, established by Congress in two steps in 1960 and 1980, adjoins 
Canada's Yukon Territory and embraces several peaks in the Brooks Range, a 
virtually sacred region to such conservationists as the late Supreme Court 
Justice William O. Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
Oilmen have restricted their exploration target to the coastal plain, a flat to 
gently rolling, treeless piece of landscape -- "a flat, crummy place," as an 
Atlantic Richfield executive unwisely described it a few years ago -- said to 
overlie 26 major geologic structures. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation that completed creation of the wildlife refuge in 1980 also 
ordered a separate study of the biology and the oil potential of the coastal 
plain. A consortium of oil companies produced an optimistic report that led the 
Ronald Reagan Administration to recommend in April, 1987, that the plain be 
opened to oil exploration and development. 
</P>
<P>
The pro-development report by then-Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel has 
attracted almost as much debate as the coastal plain itself. Field biologists 
at Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service complained that the report was 
sanitized, understating the possibilities of environmental damage arising from 
oil development. 
</P>
<P>
The report conceded that the coastal plain has "outstanding Arctic habitats 
which support fish and wildlife species of national and international 
significance." But it concluded: "The public interest demands that the area be 
made available for oil and gas exploration and development. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
200 Species Present 
</P>
<P>
The plain has about 200 species of wildlife and fish, among them 500 musk oxen, 
100 brown bears, a few dozen wolves, 325,000 geese and 300,000 other wildfowl. 
</P>
<P>
But the chief concern is the Porcupine caribou herd, the continent's 
sixth-largest migratory herd of caribou, officially estimated at 180,000 
animals. They travel a route back and forth from a winter site in interior 
Canada to the Wildlife Refuge for a 6- to 10-week period each summer. 
</P>
<P>
Although another caribou herd appears to have prospered despite the huge oil 
field developments at Prudhoe Bay about 100 miles to the west, the Porcupine 
herd historically has used the coastal plain of the refuge as a calving ground. 
</P>
<P>
Studies show that when the animals do not reach the plain to calve -- which 
occurs if there is a late thaw, for instance -- there is a significantly higher 
death rate among the offspring. 
</P>
<P>
Protecting the normal calving ground has become a focus of the oil battle. 
Another bill before Congress -- introduced by Rep. Walter B. Jones (D-N.C.), 
chairman of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee -- would open 
most of the coastal plain but impose a 10-year moratorium on the calving ground 
itself for further study. 
</P>
<P>
In one example of the hazy scientific parameters of the debate, the very 
existence of a particular calving ground within the refuge and its boundaries 
is disputed. The whole concept was excised from the Interior Department report. 
Most of the caribou have not even reached the plain to calve in the last two 
years because of a late snow melt, biologists say. 
</P>
<P>
But David Klein, a wildlife biologist at the University of Alaska who has 
studied the Arctic for 30 years, says that the latest research on the Porcupine 
herd bolsters the calving ground theory by showing that the forage there is 
superior to that elsewhere. This helps explain the highly successful calving on 
the plain, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The geological facts are also unclear, and will be unless exploration is 
permitted. Exploration itself 
</P>
<P>
would not disrupt the plain much, says a new report by the Congressional Office 
of Technology Assessment, but development would mean a "major industrial 
infrastructure" comparable to that at Prudhoe Bay, but more modern. 
</P>
<P>
If there is oil at all, the Interior Department report said, it is likely to 
amount to about 3.2 billion barrels, which would make it the nation's 
third-largest discovery after Prudhoe Bay and the East Texas field. 
</P>
<P>
The report by the Office of Technology Assessment said that estimate is 
probably too low, although the oil industry repeatedly has been disappointed in 
the Arctic since the 1968 discovery of Prudhoe's 9 billion barrels. 
</P>
<P>
One exploratory well has been drilled by Chevron on part of the plain 
controlled by the native village of Kaktovik. Citing competitive reasons, 
Chevron recently won a court battle to keep results of the test well a secret. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oil Consumption Jumps 
</P>
<P>
If the oil spill casts the debate in a new light, so has the sharp decline in 
world oil prices of the last three years. It has helped cause a steep 
international jump in consumption, and in the United States has depressed oil 
production and driven the nation's dependence on foreign oil back up to 1970s, 
pre-oil-shock levels. 
</P>
<P>
The big oil companies have used this as ammunition in their campaign to win 
access to the wildlife refuge, triggering anew the old debate about whether the 
nation has an energy policy. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the Reagan Administration's relaxation of auto fuel economy 
standards has already caused the nation to consume an extra 300 million barrels 
or so. As vice president, George Bush headed a deregulation task force that 
advocated doing away with fuel economy standards altogether. 
</P>
<P>
If driving and car-purchasing habits went unchanged for as long as a new 
3.2-billion-barrel oil field is likely to remain in production, the relaxation 
in fuel economy standards would effectively swallow up all the new oil. 
</P>
<P>
Similar criticisms are leveled at the recent increases in highway speed limits, 
which have also boosted gasoline consumption. And the nation's low taxes on 
gasoline -- paltry compared to those levied in Europe and Japan -- have helped 
enlarge the country's appetite for oil. 
</P>
<P>
"The good thing that might come out of this spill is if it reminds people that 
energy and the environment are related and if they start examining some of 
these issues," said Jack Riggs, staff director of the House Energy and Commerce 
subcommittee on energy and power. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alaskans Reap Bonanza 
</P>
<P>
The fate of the federally owned wildlife refuge is not up to Alaskans, who have 
supported oil development and been rewarded with a financial bonanza over the 
last decade. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska's citizens, including its native groups, have seen billions of dollars 
in oil revenues used to extend better schools, roads, health care, 
communications and other hallmarks of modern life to the most remote sections 
of the rugged state. Every Alaskan even gets an annual lump-sum payment of 
several hundred dollars from the state's oil-fed financial reserves. 
</P>
<P>
But if they had a vote on the refuge today, state officials say, it would be a 
lot closer than it would have been before the spill. 
</P>
<P>
"There's really no relationship between the wildlife refuge and the question of 
whether we can move oil safely," says Sen. Frank H. Murkowski (R-Alaska), who 
remains a staunch advocate of development. "But Alaskans feel betrayed. The 
state had signed off on the adequacy of the oil industry's ability to avoid 
this kind of thing."

ATTACKS PROMPT CITY'S HOUSING CHIEF TO RESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN F. BUNTING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Telling associates that she "could not cope" with mounting criticism, Leila 
Gonzalez-Correa has resigned unexpectedly as the executive director of the Los 
Angeles City Housing Authority. 
</P>
<P>
"She had it," said Housing Commissioner Dori Pye, one of a few officials the 
embattled Gonzalez-Correa told of her decision over the weekend. "She is a 
fighter . . . (but) it was just a pyramid of critique that no human being could 
possibly endure." 
</P>
<P>
After learning late last week that her controversial plan to sell the Jordan 
Downs housing project in Watts was falling apart, Gonzalez-Correa submitted her 
resignation to the housing commissioners Friday before traveling to Florida on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Under Investigation 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez-Correa, 58, is under investigation by city officials for disregarding 
federal procurement regulations while awarding contracts to her acquaintances 
and to Mayor Tom Bradley's political supporters. 
</P>
<P>
She did not notify Bradley that she had resigned her $100,000-a-year position, 
the mayor said Sunday. While Bradley -- campaigning for reelection at a march 
against drugs and gang violence in South-Central Los Angeles -- said he would 
have no comment on Gonzalez-Correa's resignation, Deputy Mayor Mike Gage 
offered the following: 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor's reaction was that he appreciated her efforts in a very difficult 
job and respected her decision." 
</P>
<P>
The Times has learned that Gonzalez-Correa misled housing officials and tenants 
when she said the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development had set 
aside 700 federally subsidized housing certificates to allow a private 
developer to purchase and refurbish the dilapidated Jordan Downs and continue 
to provide shelter indefinitely for low-income tenants. HUD officials confirmed 
that there is no commitment to Los Angeles for 700 subsidies, and none is 
available now. 
</P>
<P>
"Again, here comes the misleading promises and false representations," said 
Claudia Moore, head of the Housing Authority's Residents Advisory Committee. 
"It was about time she got out. I don't see how the lady could have stayed." 
</P>
<P>
Gage on Sunday blamed a bureaucratic mix-up in Washington -- not 
Gonzalez-Correa -- for the lack of the 700 subsidies. He said the Bradley 
Administration would work to persuade new HUD Secretary Jack Kemp to restore 
the federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction to Gonzalez-Correa's surprise resignation ranged from relief among 
some city officials and tenants to dismay on the part of her supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably just as well that she resigned," said Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky. "But I don't think it solves the Housing Authority problem. The 
Housing Authority is bigger than Leila Gonzalez-Correa. It is an agency that is 
not only run amok, but has turned its back on the low-income tenants they 
house." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called 'a Disgrace' 
</P>
<P>
A shaken Pye said she is "very unhappy and very disgusted" over 
Gonzalez-Correa's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is a disgrace. I think it is a great tragedy. I think it is the 
biggest loss the Housing Authority has had in over 20 years," Pye said. "I felt 
she would manage to overcome the tremendous avalanche of unwarranted criticism 
because she is a strong person." 
</P>
<P>
Pye faulted the commissioners, who are appointed by Bradley to oversee the 
agency, for not giving Gonzalez-Correa any support since she was hired in 
October, 1986, to run the agency's 750 employees, $135-million budget and 21 
public housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Gonzalez-Correa kept her resignation a secret, sharing the news with 
only two managers, sources said. After failing to reach Chairman Carl D. Covitz 
by telephone, she told Vice Chairman Louis Janicich and Pye on Saturday of her 
plans, Pye said. "She simply said she could not cope with the criticism, the 
overwhelming opposition and lack of support she received from all of the board 
members," Pye said. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez-Correa wrote her resignation letter to Covitz, the former HUD 
undersecretary whom Bradley appointed chairman of the commission Feb. 7. 
Contacted Sunday, Covitz said, "I don't have a reaction." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Travel Plans 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez-Correa told colleagues she would spend the next couple of weeks 
attending a wedding in Florida, visiting her family in Puerto Rico and then 
vacationing in Spain, housing sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Since she had been under fire for her management practices over the last 
several weeks, Gonzalez-Correa had gone into virtual hiding and refused 
interviews by reporters. Last week, Gonzalez-Correa lashed out at a Times 
reporter in a brief telephone interview and complained that she had been 
unfairly attacked in the press. 
</P>
<P>
"It is really sad you are giving the Housing Authority really such a bad name," 
Gonzalez-Correa told the reporter. "People like you have to be dealt with." 
</P>
<P>
According to housing sources, Bradley's strong public rebuke of Gonzalez-Correa 
last week persuaded her that she no longer enjoyed the support of the mayor's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to a Times report that a Housing Authority manager had grilled a 
tenant leaderfor criticizing the agency in an interview with two Spanish 
language television stations, Bradley on Thursday issued a memo urging 
Gonzalez-Correa to stop any efforts to silence activist tenants. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter made public by the mayor, Bradley wrote to Gonzalez-Correa: "It is 
imperative that, from your office on down, the Housing Authority does 
everything it can to encourage, not discourage, tenant participation in the 
management of their communities." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez-Correa told associates that she knew the mayor's memo was intended to 
chastise her publicly when she did not hear from Bradley or his housing 
liaison, Gary Squires, after it was released to reporters, said sources who 
asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez-Correa also has been under fire for 
</P>
<P>
numerous other practices: 
</P>
<P>
* When she introduced her plans to sell Jordan Downs in February, 
Gonzalez-Correa failed to disclose that HUD had withheld $5 million in 
improvement funds for the project last fall. As part of the privatization plan, 
Gonzalez-Correa said she had a commitment from HUD for 700 subsidized 
certificates to keep the tenants on public housing assistance under a private 
landlord. 
</P>
<P>
"Although there certainly had been discussion and the subject had been explored 
in a preliminary way, there was never a firm, final commitment," said Dirk 
Murphy, special assistant to HUD's regional administrator in San Francisco. "To 
our knowledge, there is no other commitment that exists." 
</P>
<P>
With the loss of the federal subsidies, tenants at Jordan Downs now face the 
likelihood of losing the $13 million in physical improvements that were planned 
by a private developer, in addition to the $5 million taken away by HUD because 
of the privatization plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Residents Are Victims' 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate that the residents are the victims," Commissioner Ozie B. 
Gonzaque said Sunday. "This is another example of what happens when someone is 
determined to have a one-man show in an organization that requires teamwork. 
This is not an organization set up to be run and dictated by one person," added 
Gonzaque. 
</P>
<P>
* The Times reported in February that Gonzalez-Correa ignored federal 
contracting regulations on at least six occasions while awarding more than 
$200,000 of Housing Authority business to her acquaintances and to Bradley's 
political supporters without seeking competitive bids. 
</P>
<P>
The contracting practices are currently being investigated by Chief Legislative 
Analyst William McCarley, City Administrative Officer Keith Comrie and City 
Controller Rick Tuttle. HUD auditors are expected today to begin their 
comprehensive review of the Housing Authority's contracting practices under 
Gonzalez-Correa, said HUD spokesman Scott Reed. The audit is expected to last 
two weeks. Her resignation will not affect the audit, HUD officials said. 
</P>
<P>
* Gonzalez-Correa recently introduced a "written and oral communications" 
policy that would make it a violation of the Housing Authority personnel manual 
for employees to write or speak to commissioners, City Council members, 
government workers and reporters without the permission of the executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky introduced a motion last week that would have forced 
Gonzalez-Correa to appear before the full City Council to explain her proposed 
policy. The council was scheduled to vote on the motion this week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Search for Replacement 
</P>
<P>
Pye said the Housing Authority will have difficulty recruiting an administrator 
with Gonzalez-Correa's knowledge and resourcefulness. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a person who was going to cut corners and was not going to go through 
bureaucratic red tape," Pye said. "We'll get a lot of people who will go by the 
book and won't be anything other than puppets of the board. That's not what I'm 
hoping." 
</P>
<P>
But tenant leaders said they do not believe the search for a replacement will 
be so difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that now is the time for the mayor to take a good look at someone else 
who has sensitivity as far as the residents are concerned, will not come in and 
mislead the residents and will follow the rules and regulations of the Housing 
Authority," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOUSING AGENCY CHRONOLOGY 
</P>
<P>
Chronology of events at Los Angeles City Housing Authority: 
</P>
<P>
November, 1985: Executive Director Homer Smith -- under fire for five years for 
bad contracting practices, wasteful spending and dictatorial personnel moves -- 
resigns. 
</P>
<P>
June, 1986: The Los Angeles City Council votes to relinquish control of the 
Housing Authority to a board of commissioners after implementing a series of 
management reforms. 
</P>
<P>
October, 1986: Ending a nationwide search, Leila Gonzalez-Correa is named 
executive director and awarded a three-year contract that pays $100,000 in the 
third year. The appointment is her third top post at a housing authority in a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
May, 1987: The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development designates the 
Housing Authority "operationally troubled." Los Angeles is the only agency 
among 66 housing authorities in the Southern California region given such a 
designation in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
December, 1987: Tenant leaders from more than half of the city's 21 public 
housing projects accuse Gonzalez-Correa of not following through on promises to 
improve conditions for the 40,000 low-income people who live in city-run 
housing. They describe her first year at the agency as a "disappointment." 
</P>
<P>
March, 1988: Gonzalez-Correa acknowledges that, despite promising the City 
Council to "turn things around" in the housing projects, she has quietly been 
looking to become housing director in another city. 
</P>
<P>
April, 1988: Tenant leaders demand in a letter that Mayor Tom Bradley seek 
Gonzalez-Correa's resignation. More than 100 chanting residents and 
placard-carrying children from the projects march on City Hall demanding an end 
to slum-like conditions, lack of police protection and long-promised physical 
improvements in the projects. 
</P>
<P>
December, 1988: Bradley demands the resignation of Alvin Greene as chairman of 
the Housing Authority Board of Commissioners after it is disclosed that he 
failed to attend a board meeting for six months. Although Bradley reprimands 
two top aides for failing to inform him of Greene's attendance record, 
Gonzalez-Correa and Commissioner Dori Pye say the mayor was personally warned 
in advance about the absences. 
</P>
<P>
February, 1989: An investigation by The Times discloses that Gonzalez-Correa 
has disregarded federal contracting regulations while awarding more than 
$200,000 in Housing Authority business to her acquaintances and to the mayor's 
political supporters. 
</P>
<P>
February, 1989: Gonzalez-Correa announces her plan to sell the dilapidated 
Jordan Downs public housing project in Watts to a private developer. The plan 
is cautiously endorsed by Bradley and widely opposed by tenants, who fear they 
will lose their subsidized housing. The plan begins to fall apart and is 
criticized by several City Council members. 
</P>
<P>
March, 1989: City and federal officials agree to investigate contracting 
practices by the Housing Authority. 
</P>
<P>
March 31, 1989: Gonzalez-Correa quietly resigns.

AT LEAST 126 KILLED AS POLICE, REBELS BATTLE FOR 2ND DAY

WINDHOEK, Namibia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bloody battles between rebels and police that have imperiled the fragile U.N. 
framework for Namibian independence continued for a second day Sunday as the 
death toll rose to at least 126 and the authorities searched the northern bush 
for 400 to 600 more insurgents. 
</P>
<P>
The South African administrator general, who controls the territory's 
U.N.-monitored transition to nationhood, halted the demobilization of Namibia's 
army and reactivated two units to help the police control the guerrilla 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
The United Nations' two-day-old, $461-million plan to free Namibia from South 
Africa's 74-year rule is "still on stream," said Louis Pienaar, the South 
African administrator general. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
30 Separate Clashes 
</P>
<P>
Police counted more than 30 separate clashes Sunday with armed members of the 
South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), the group that had agreed to 
lay down its arms after 23 years of guerrilla conflict and participate in the 
U.N.-supervised elections. 
</P>
<P>
"Fresh armed contacts were established by the hour in the war zone," said 
Kierie du Rand, a police spokesman in Windhoek. In one clash, police killed 25 
heavily armed SWAPO guerrillas, he added, and in another, 17 SWAPO members 
died. 
</P>
<P>
Du Rand said Sunday night that at least 120 guerrillas and six police officers 
had died in two days of clashes. On Saturday, authorities said 38 SWAPO 
guerrillas and two policemen had been killed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.N. Team Investigates 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. special representative here, Martti Ahtisaari, met for 90 minutes with 
Pienaar, police officials and a four-member U.N. team that had flown to the 
area of the fighting, about 400 miles north of Windhoek, to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
A U.N. spokesman declined to comment, except to say that Ahtisaari has agreed 
with Pienaar's decision to activate Namibia's military forces. None of the 
1,000 U.N. peacekeeping troops in the country, part of what will be a 
4,650-member force, were involved in the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
The conflict, the first serious clashes in the north since September, 
apparently began shortly before a formal cease-fire was to take effect Saturday 
when about 150 SWAPO guerrillas crossed the Angola-Namibia border in three 
groups, police say. South Africa charges that the guerrillas were armed with 
automatic weapons and surface-to-air missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials said they did not know how many of the 400 to 600 armed 
guerrillas still roaming northern Namibia on Sunday had crossed the border from 
Angola. Some of the guerrillas, the authorities said, might already have been 
hiding inside Namibia. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows for sure why SWAPO guerrillas might have invaded the territory and 
threatened the first concrete steps toward their goal of an independent 
Namibia. 
</P>
<P>
Some political analysts have speculated that the incursions were launched by a 
renegade faction of SWAPO, unhappy with SWAPO leader Sam Nujoma's vow to 
support the Namibian peace process. Some hard-line SWAPO supporters thought 
that SWAPO, by agreeing to contest an election in Namibia, was giving away too 
much political ground for a group that the United Nations has identified as the 
"sole and authentic" representative of Namibia's people. 
</P>
<P>
SWAPO had been considered a likely winner of the territory's first free and 
fair national elections, set for November, and its international image has been 
badly shaken by the apparent violation of the peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Under that accord, SWAPO was to have confined its soldiers to bases north of 
the 16th Parallel in Angola, 150 miles north of the border. Within two months, 
under U.N. supervision, the guerrillas were to surrender their arms and return 
peacefully to Namibia. 
</P>
<P>
However, Western diplomats say that about 3,000 SWAPO fighters remain south of 
the 16th Parallel, and police reported that the two guerrillas captured 
Saturday said that about 300 SWAPO troops were near the border with Namibia. 
</P>
<P>
In its first statement since the fighting began, SWAPO said Sunday that its 
guerrillas had been "hunted down and attacked" by South African forces in the 
hours before the dawn cease-fire Saturday. The statement, issued at SWAPO 
headquarters in Luanda, Angola, acknowledged that SWAPO did not have complete 
control over the actions of its field soldiers but nevertheless contended they 
had been acting in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa's foreign minister, Roelof F. (Pik) Botha, contended that SWAPO 
commanders had issued orders for its members to cross the border. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not important what their aims were. They were well-armed," Botha said 
from Cape Town. He said that the U.N. Security Council should meet immediately 
to condemn SWAPO's actions. 
</P>
<P>
But Danny Tjongarero, acting chairman of SWAPO here in the Namibian capital, 
said thatSWAPO "had nothing to gain from crossing the border into Namibia. Let 
me assure you we will make our own investigation." 
</P>
<P>
SWAPO, in its headquarters statement, said that its troops were "under strict 
instructions not to initiate any act of military hostility." And it said that 
Nujoma, its president, had addressed a group of SWAPO guerrillas near the 
border in southern Angola on Friday, ordering them to observe the cease-fire 
"in letter and spirit." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Pienaar, however, said SWAPO had broken the cease-fire simply 
by being within 150 miles of the Namibian border. 
</P>
<P>
SWAPO and the Council of Churches also alleged Sunday that a South African 
military helicopter opened fire on youths wearing SWAPO T-shirts, killing at 
least six. They said the incident occurred Saturday in a remote area of 
northeastern Namibia. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa denied the allegation. Soldiers of the South African Defense 
Forces have remained confined to their bases since Saturday, in line with the 
U.N. peace guidelines, according to Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa has ruled this former German colony since 1915 -- and since 1966 
in defiance of the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, South Africa, Angola and Cuba approved a regional accord, 
adopting a 1978 U.N. plan for Namibian independence as part of a pact that also 
called for the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola by mid-1991. 
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. plan, South Africa -- with the consent of the U.N. secretary 
general -- is to conduct free and fair elections in Namibia in November. That 
election will choose a constituent assembly, which will draw up a new 
constitution for an independent Namibia.

PLO GIVES ARAFAT NEW TITLE: PRESIDENT

<P>
Not everyone may be ready to accept it, but as far as the Palestine Liberation 
Organization is concerned, it's now President Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
The PLO Executive Committee, meeting throughout the night, voted Sunday morning 
in Tunis to elect PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat president of the yet unborn 
Palestinian state, whose "independence" was proclaimed at a meeting of the 
Palestine National Council last November. 
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Hamid Sayegh, chairman of the council, which serves as the PLO's 
parliament in exile, said in Tunis that the vote for Arafat, who ran unopposed, 
was unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
The PLO leader, he said, will retain his position and duties as chairman of the 
guerrilla organization but will henceforth also be considered president of the 
yet-to-be formed Palestinian provisional government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Than a Symbol 
</P>
<P>
While Palestinian sources conceded that Arafat's election as head of a still 
hypothetical Palestinian state was of little practical consequence at the 
moment, they said its significance is still more than merely symbolic. 
</P>
<P>
One aim of the maneuver, they said, was to overcome protocol difficulties 
arising from the PNC's decision in November to declare an independent 
Palestinian state. The decision implied that this state should be established 
in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip but left the question of 
borders open, pending their negotiation at a U.N.-sponsored peace conference 
that the PLO hopes Israel will agree to attend. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 countries have recognized the Palestinian state and upgraded the 
status of the PLO missions in their capitals to embassies. This has created 
protocol problems, however, in the absence of a government to appoint the PLO's 
new "ambassadors." Palestinian sources said the decision to name Arafat 
president was taken to overcome these problems, as well as to make it easier 
for the PLO leader to communicate with heads of state on a diplomatically more 
equal footing. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said they hope the decision will also help bolster the PLO's claim 
to set up an independent state at a time when its diplomatic drive to gain 
wider recognition seems to be flagging. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arafat-Mitterrand Talks 
</P>
<P>
Crucial to the efforts to maintain this momentum, begun in December when Arafat 
renounced terrorism and recognized Israel's right to exist, are the 
negotiations that are currently under way for a meeting between Arafat and 
French President Francois Mitterrand, the sources added. If that meeting comes 
off, it will be Arafat's first with a major Western head of state. 
</P>
<P>
Arab diplomats in Cairo noted that efforts are also under way to try to upgrade 
the dialogue that the United States opened with the PLO last December by 
arranging a meeting between Arafat and Secretary of State James A. Baker III. 
The prospects for that meeting are slimmer, however. 
</P>
<P>
The Palestine National Council, when it met in Algiers in November, empowered 
the 77-member Central Council to establish a "provisional government" for the 
newly declared Palestinian state on paper. But subsequent attempts to do so 
have been stymied by differences within the PLO's rival factions over 
representation in the government. 
</P>
<P>
These rivalries were apparent at the latest Executive Committee meeting, where 
PLO sources said the debate was heated, with two hard-line groups, the Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Democratic Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine, criticizing Arafat for offering what they consider to 
be unacceptable concessions. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said the two groups particularly objected to Arafat's offer, made 
last month, to go to Jerusalem to negotiate directly with the Israeli 
leadership. The offer was rejected by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, 
who refuses to negotiate with the PLO and who said that Arafat would be 
arrested and sent to prison as a terrorist if he set foot in Israel.

Old money still dominates Britain, according to a survey published Sunday that 
shows Queen Elizabeth is still by far the richest person in the country with 
assets of $8.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Although the number of millionaires has risen from 5,000 to 20,000 in the last 
five years, the study of the richest 200 people in Britain showed more than 
half inherited their wealth, the Sunday Times said. Only 86 of the 200 made 
their fortunes themselves.

BATTLE FOR BEIRUT RAGES IN 'DOWNPOUR OF DEATH'

A withering hail of shells, rockets and mortar fire blasted Beirut on Sunday in 
one of the most ferocious blitzes of Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Shellfire hit the city's airport, and radio reports said the home of the U.S. 
ambassador was struck during fierce duels that began Saturday night between 
Syrian gunners and Christian army units. Police reported 13 people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
Syrian gunners and their Muslim militia allies poured more than 8,000 rounds -- 
at a rate of up to 100 per minute -- on East Beirut and the Christian suburbs 
northeast of the city in 24 hours, a police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Christian soldiers of the Lebanese army commander, Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, 
struck back with howitzers, firing at least 3,000 rounds on Syrian positions in 
Muslim West Beirut, the central mountains and east Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, the 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said eight people were killed and 20 wounded in East Beirut and 
five killed and seven wounded in West Beirut. The latest casualties raised the 
overall toll to at least 140 killed and more than 460 wounded in 26 days of 
fighting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Huddled in Shelters 
</P>
<P>
Casualties were low Sunday relative to the ferocity of the bombardment because 
throughout Beirut and its suburbs, tens of thousands of residents huddled in 
underground shelters. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care who's fighting who or why," screamed Yolla Chaker, a Christian, 
when she was reached by telephone at her apartment building's shelter. "This 
inferno, this downpour of death must stop." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a new day of terror and madness in our life," said Antoine Nehmeh, one of 
200 people in a shelter in East Beirut. "The whole area is trembling. People 
are on the verge of hysteria." 
</P>
<P>
"The belt of fire rings the area," said the Christian-run Voice of Lebanon 
radio station. "Until now no voice can rise above the thud of artillery shells. 
Syrian fire sows more terror among civilians." 
</P>
<P>
Acting Premier Salim Hoss, in an appeal broadcast by Muslim radio stations, 
suggested that he and Aoun should resign if it would help end the fighting. 
Hoss heads a mostly Muslim Cabinet vying for legitimacy with Aoun's Christian 
Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
"I appeal to all those pulling gun triggers to stop shooting at once, stop this 
blood bath, stop this massacre," Hoss said. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's Muslim fatalities included four soldiers stationed at the capital's 
international airport in southern Beirut, which was bombarded by Christian 
gunners. Police said that fires broke out at the airport, which was shut down 
23 days ago because of the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
The fighting began in early March when Aoun's forces blockaded militia-run 
harbors in an effort to collect taxes at five government ports. 
</P>
<P>
The Muslim militiamen and their Syrian allies retaliated by sealing off the 
region where Lebanon's 1 million Christians live.

NATO'S SUCCESS FORCING CHANGES; 
</P>
<P>
ON 40TH ANNIVERSARY, ALLIANCE IS MOVING TOWARD NEW STRATEGY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has been the most successful defense 
alliance of the century, perhaps any century, preserving peace in Europe in the 
nuclear age. Yet on the eve of its 40th anniversary, NATO is undergoing severe 
internal strains as it seeks a new strategy to counter the blandishments of 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
"We seem to be the victims of our own success," a senior official at NATO 
headquarters here remarked the other day. "If the Cold War is ending, it is 
ending on our terms. Yet we appear to be in disarray. Gorbachev is viewed as 
the good guy. We have got to change that perception, and whatever substance 
lies behind it." 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of NATO's problem -- and it will color the alliance's anniversary 
ceremonies Tuesday -- is Gorbachev's offer to sharply reduce troops and armor 
on the Central European front, the most heavily armed area in the world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Offer Is Only a Proposal 
</P>
<P>
NATO officials note that so far this offer is only a proposal, not an 
accomplished fact, yet it has left the West unsettled about how to respond. 
</P>
<P>
And the response, according to European military analysts, is the No. 1 problem 
facing the Western alliance today. 
</P>
<P>
According to every public opinion poll on the subject, the Gorbachev proposal 
holds enormous appeal for Europeans. In fact, his sweet-sounding statements 
appear to undercut NATO's very reason for being: to counter the military threat 
of the Soviet Union and its East European allies. 
</P>
<P>
"Gorbachev's popularity is a strange phenomenon," a veteran NATO planner said. 
"Here he is with a country in economic shambles, his European satellites 
breaking up, the minorities within the Soviet Union crumbling and his army 
pulling out of Afghanistan having lost a long war. For a guy with a pair of 
deuces in his hand, he is playing one hell of a game of poker." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Serious Rift 
</P>
<P>
The poker game has produced what could be a serious rift between West Germany 
and its principal allies, the United States and Britain, over the sensitive 
issue of modernizing short-range nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Washington and London want Bonn to make a public commitment to stationing on 
its soil a successor to the Lance missile, which has a range of 70 miles and 
will become obsolete in the mid-1990s. Such a German commitment, they argue, 
would help persuade the U.S. Congress to vote funds for a Lance 2. 
</P>
<P>
But West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, after backing and filling on the issue, 
now says that any such decision should be put off until after the West German 
national elections scheduled for December, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Because of this vacillation, many NATO officials say, Kohl has not demonstrated 
strong leadership, and this could jeopardize the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
NATO officials hope to resolve the modernization dispute before alliance 
leaders meet here May 29-30 in a summit conference, which will also take up 
such perennial questions as allied burden-sharing and possible U.S. troop cuts 
in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The Lance question ties in with another major difference between the West 
Germans and their NATO allies: negotiations with the Soviets on reducing 
short-range nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Missile Cutback Favored 
</P>
<P>
The West Germans, particularly Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, favor 
cutting back on short-range nuclear missiles and artillery shells, almost all 
of which are based in West Germany and, in the event of war, would be used 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Washington and London want to hold off such negotiations until after progress 
is made in the Vienna talks on reducing conventional arms. They fear that 
Gorbachev will offer to abolish all short-range nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"If Gorbachev offers a unilateral ban on short-range nuclear weapons," one 
strategist said, "the West Germans will find it very difficult not to go 
along." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Strategy Urged 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the May summit meeting, many observers believe that NATO must come up 
with a new strategy to deal with Soviet proposals if for no other reason than 
to pacify European public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question about it," said Francois Heisbourg, director of London's 
International Institute of Strategic Studies. "If NATO does not sketch out a 
strategy for the future, it will become an increasingly irrelevant body -- 
withering at best and, at worst, a deadening encumbrance." 
</P>
<P>
Frederick Bonnart, a strategic analyst and editor of the magazine, NATO's 
Sixteen Nations, said: "The danger today is that the initiative is slipping 
away from NATO toward Gorbachev. To get at the hearts and the minds of our 
electorates, NATO has to become more political, to tackle broader questions 
than military defense. The NATO summit declaration should make this clear." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Comprehensive Concept' 
</P>
<P>
NATO planners have been working on what they call a "comprehensive concept" 
that would spell out the alliance's view of arms control and force levels, one 
aspect of which was presented to the Warsaw Pact nations at the beginning of 
the Vienna talks. 
</P>
<P>
However, the comprehensive concept will deal mainly with arms matters rather 
than the wider political scene. 
</P>
<P>
The problem for both the comprehensive concept and a broader political 
declaration is to get agreement among the 16 members that is needed for any 
major policy decision. 
</P>
<P>
Such consensus has been necessary ever since NATO was founded. The North 
Atlantic Treaty was signed in Washington on April 4, 1949, by the 
representatives of 12 governments. West Germany, Greece, Turkey and Spain 
joined later. 
</P>
<P>
Today, as the threat from the East seems to have lessened, NATO officials say 
they must project a new policy, a longer-range vision. But how? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Road Map Into the Future' 
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner, a former West German defense minister, 
plans to issue a declaration at the summit meeting that will be "a political 
message, describing the way ahead, a sort of road map into the future, which 
clearly indicates our goals and our policy -- policy in a global context and 
policy of East-West relations." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, two documents are expected to emerge from the summit meeting that will 
help chart the future: a comprehensive concept of arms control and a wider 
declaration on NATO's political aims. 
</P>
<P>
Karsten Voigt, an arms specialist for West Germany's opposition Social 
Democratic Party, who supports NATO but is against short-range nuclear weapons, 
said recently: "Our real problem has been with NATO's success. We always asked 
for change in the East -- and now we are getting it. But it is confusing 
alliance members. I sometimes think NATO has been more comfortable with a 
reliable adversary in the East, rather than unreliable partners in the West." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Turning Back' 
</P>
<P>
One of the most respected diplomats at NATO headquarters, who asked not to be 
identified by name, offered this advice: "Nobody can predict the future. Nobody 
can say what Eastern Europe will be like in two or three years, or whether 
Gorbachev will last, or who would replace him. If we scrap our nuclear weapons, 
there is no turning back. 
</P>
<P>
"We in NATO should be sympathetic toward the East, but uninvolved and 
dispassionate, which is perhaps easier for the United States and Britain than 
for West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"We should simply be there -- a sturdy presence, strong, sensible, stable, 
predictable. For the East, we mustn't arouse hopes we can't fulfill. But we 
don't want to turn a cold shoulder, either. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a very difficult, perhaps dangerous, process. But that is the 
challenge for NATO." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NATO: 40 YEARS OF LOOKING EAST 
</P>
<P>
NATO was conceived as mutual defense group of nations to guard against 
possibility of Soviet Bloc invasion of Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Its organization is a complex alphabet-soup structure, both military and 
civilian, ranging from governing North Atlantic Council (NAC) at top down 
through regional military commands such as Allied Command, Atlantic, or ACLANT, 
responsible for the North Atlantic, down to sub-level commands such as Allied 
Forces Northern Europe (AFNORTH), covering Denmark, Norway and northern West 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Senior NATO civilian is secretary general, who heads North Atlantic Council. 
Senior military officer is supreme allied commander, Europe, who has always 
been American. 
</P>
<P>
NATO's doctrine is based on what is called "flexible response" allowing for the 
use of either conventional or nuclear forces, depending on the nature of any 
Warsaw Pact invasion.

U.S. TO RESTUDY ALASKA OIL DRILLING; 
</P>
<P>
WILL IMPOSE BETTER ACCIDENT SAFEGUARDS, EPA CHIEF SAYS 
</P>

<P>
The federal government will take a broad new look at the environmental impact 
of oil drilling in Alaska and will require better safeguards against accidents 
as a result of the massive oil spill in Prince William Sound, the head of the 
Environmental Protection Agency said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're going to take the environmental planning completely apart for 
every aspect of Alaska oil development and make sure that it is as sound, as 
careful as we can possibly make it," EPA Administrator William K. Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to look at our worst case and assume that it could happen," Reilly 
said in an interview on CBS' "Face the Nation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Says Planning Fell Short 
</P>
<P>
"The planning for this disaster did not anticipate anything like the magnitude 
of the spill that occurred," Reilly said. "I think the worst case that was 
talked about in the environmental impact assessment for the trans-Alaska 
pipeline and the shipments down that sound talked in the range of 140,000 
barrels. We had a 240,000-barrel spill -- and, in fact, that was less than a 
quarter of what was on that ship." 
</P>
<P>
The tanker Exxon Valdez, carrying 1.2 million barrels of oil that had been 
shipped by pipeline from Alaska's North Slope to the port city of Valdez, 
strayed out of normal sea lanes March 24 and ran aground, puncturing 10 of the 
ship's 15 oil compartments. 
</P>
<P>
By Sunday, the spilled oil -- 240,000 barrels equals about 10.1 million gallons 
-- had spread across an area the size of Rhode Island. Rescuers captured 
oil-smeared sea otters in airline dog cages and boxes of plywood and chicken 
wire and worked to clean them. "Beaches are getting hammered by oil," said 
Dennis Kelso, commissioner of the Alaska Department of Environmental 
Conservation. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly's promise of a strict review of Alaska oil drilling appeared to be at 
least partly in response to a threat by Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper to close the 
trans-Alaska pipeline, which carries almost one-fourth of the nation's oil 
supply, if a new plan for dealing with oil spills is not produced. 
</P>
<P>
"If they don't do it, we'll shut it down," Cowper said on ABC's "This Week With 
David Brinkley," although he acknowledged that the state may not have the 
authority to halt the pipeline's operations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suggests Broad Shift 
</P>
<P>
But Reilly also suggested a broad shift in the EPA's attitude since the Ronald 
Reagan Administration ended. He promised that his agency henceforth will pay 
more attention to environmentalists' warnings. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to take people seriously more than we have, perhaps, when critics 
other than the experts say these things can happen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blame Governments, Exxon 
</P>
<P>
Reilly and Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner said that the blame for 
inadequate emergency planning in the Alaska oil spill is shared by the federal 
and state governments as well as by Exxon, the operator of the tanker. 
</P>
<P>
Skinner, speaking on the Brinkley program, said he believes that Exxon bears 
the largest share of the responsibility for the spill, the first in the 12 
years of Alaska pipeline operation. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, over 15 years, in my opinion, the industry had gotten a little . . . 
cavalier about the thought that a spill of this magnitude would happen," he 
said. "And they didn't have enough equipment there, they didn't have enough of 
a lot of the things that you need. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Major Response Expected 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing that is supposed to happen is that within five hours (of an 
accident), a very major response put together by industry is supposed to be in 
place," Skinner said. "That did not happen." 
</P>
<P>
But Lee Raymond, Exxon's president, said charges that his company had acted too 
slowly to contain the spill are unfair. 
</P>
<P>
"We moved as fast as we could move," he said on the ABC program. He blamed the 
Coast Guard for refusing to allow oil industry experts to use chemical 
dispersing agents on the oil slick. The Coast Guard and Alaska state officials 
previously have said that dispersants would not have worked. 
</P>
<P>
Skinner confirmed that the Justice Department is considering federal criminal 
charges in the case -- not only against tanker Capt. Joseph Hazelwood, who 
already has been charged with three misdemeanors by Alaska authorities, but 
also against Exxon. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is evidence of guilt, there should be penalties imposed," Skinner 
said. FBI officials have said that Exxon could face potential criminal charges 
under the Clean Water Act, which outlaws "negligent discharge of a pollutant 
into navigable waters." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Skipper Still at Large 
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood, of Huntington, N. Y., remained at large Sunday, one day after Alaska 
officials asked authorities in New York to arrest him and extradite him to face 
three misdemeanor criminal charges of operating a ship while under the 
influence of alcohol, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil. 
</P>
<P>
According to documents filed in a court in Alaska, the first investigator to 
board the Exxon Valdez after the disaster asked Hazelwood what the problem was, 
and Hazelwood replied: "I think you're looking at it." 
</P>
<P>
EPA chief Reilly, despite his kind words for environmentalists, said that he 
still favors allowing oil companies to drill exploratory wells in the Alaskan 
National Wildlife Refuge, a move opposed by several environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, the oil and gas development on the North Slope has been 
conducted responsibly; environmental impact has been kept to a minimum there," 
he said. "And I think we have reason to believe that would be true in the 
refuge itself."

GHOSTS OF MAYORS PAST HAUNT CHICAGO VOTERS; 
</P>
<P>
ISSUES IN ELECTION CAMPAIGN TAKING BACK SEAT TO PRO-WASHINGTON, ANTI-DALEY 
SENTIMENTS

CHICAGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 20 years have passed since Mayor Richard J. Daley gave police the 
infamous "shoot to kill" order after rioting erupted in the city's poorest 
neighborhoods, and 13 years have passed since the legendary mayor died. 
</P>
<P>
But attend a political rally on Chicago's South Side or listen to current black 
political leaders speak, and you would think those turbulent times had never 
faded. 
</P>
<P>
In the campaign for Tuesday's mayoral election, the ghost of Richard J. Daley 
is almost as real a presence as the lingering Chicago winter that refuses to 
step aside for spring. 
</P>
<P>
That is because Daley's 46-year-old son, Richard M. Daley, is leading in the 
polls. Alderman Timothy C. Evans, a black who is the stronger of Daley's two 
opponents, has continually evoked Daley's father in trying to galvanize black 
voters who remember the 21 years of Daley rule as a time of "plantation 
politics," when blacks helped to keep the Democratic machine in power but 
received little in return from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Plantation Days' Recalled 
</P>
<P>
"Daley is getting ready to reopen his father's plantation," Evans told a 
cheering audience last week, "and the new machine is going to be just as bad as 
the old one, if not worse." 
</P>
<P>
Daley has been visibly stung by some of the more vicious attacks on his 
father's memory. He responded to Evans' comments last week by saying quietly: 
"It's a small person who does that. I'm proud of my father. I think he's proud 
of his father." 
</P>
<P>
Daley rarely mentions his father's name, although, before black audiences, he 
does sometimes speak respectfully of the late Mayor Harold Washington, Evans' 
mentor. 
</P>
<P>
But at the South Side rallies, vendors hawk buttons and T-shirts depicting the 
1968 "Shoot to Kill" headlines. In his speeches, Evans refers to the raid on 
Black Panther headquarters the same year. During that raid the police, in what 
a federal grand jury later called unprovoked shooting, killed two Panther 
leaders. Brochures and leaflets recall the rampant patronage and graft of the 
Daley years. 
</P>
<P>
This election, as all elections, is to determine Chicago's future, but for many 
voters the battle lines have been drawn across bitter memories of the past. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Politics of Memory' 
</P>
<P>
It is what political scientist and author Paul M. Green calls "the politics of 
memory," and who will be the next mayor may be determined, to a large extent, 
by how effectively Evans exploits that memory. 
</P>
<P>
Green predicted a Daley victory months ago, based on Daley's ability to 
distance himself from his father's image and appeal to a broad spectrum of 
voters, including white liberals who became disenchanted with the elder Daley 
during the 1960s. "The politics of memory in Chicago doesn't take you very 
far," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, though, it took Evans to the University of Illinois Pavilion and a 
mostly black crowd of 12,000 cheering, chanting supporters -- a thunderous 
replay of the shows of strength that helped propel Washington into office in 
1983 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
A listener would almost think it was an election battle between two ghosts, 
that the mayors Daley and Washington were squaring off in the firmament. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Washington Lives' 
</P>
<P>
"Right here we all are Harold Washington, because Harold Washington isn't 
dead!" one speaker told the crowd. "Harold Washington lives in all of us." 
</P>
<P>
Two gigantic portraits hung high above the stage. One was of Evans. The other 
was of Washington, who died in 1987 after five years in office. Evans, a 
Democrat running as an independent to fill Washington's unexpired term, has 
named his organization after him. 
</P>
<P>
The event was orchestrated not only to emphasize Evans' ties with a mayor who 
is venerated by blacks here, but also to place his own "crusade" for office in 
the continuum of the civil rights struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe in God and history and poetry," the Rev. Jesse Jackson intoned from 
the stage at one point, after the showing of a lengthy film linking Evans with 
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and to Washington. "On April 4, 1964, I was in 
Memphis," Jackson said. "Dr. King was crucified. We could do nothing about it. 
On April 4, 1989, the stone will be rolled away. . . . There will be a 
resurrection." 
</P>
<P>
In an atmosphere that more closely resembled a national political convention 
than a local rally, banners exhorted voters to "Remember Dr. King. Vote Harold 
Washington Party." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Third Candidate 
</P>
<P>
Issues have taken a definite back seat in the campaign, which also includes 
Edward R. Vrdolyak, a Republican and former alderman who has not risen above 
single digits in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
All of the candidates are for better schools and against drugs. They all say 
they want to stamp out gangs. All three say they want to help heal racial 
divisions in the city and run a fair government. They want to help create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Vrdolyak, the most conservative of the three, has tried to distinguish himself 
from his opponents by taking stands against school busing and charging that 
Daley and Evans both come from a "liberal Democratic" tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Daley, whose campaign has raised more than $6 million and has blanketed the 
airwaves with commercials, has been able to stay well above the fray despite 
being the main target of his two opponents. He has been attacked for skipping a 
debate, for accepting large contributions from developers and lawyers and for 
his record as Cook County state's attorney. He has been accused of being a 
racist and called "too dumb" to be mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, though, he has been attacked for being his father's son. 
</P>
<P>
Daley's looks, his pudgy frame and his blunt, inarticulate speaking style all 
are evocative of his father. So is his sometimes blustery, impatient manner. 
That he would inherit the blue-collar whites of his father's old constituency 
was a given. Many of those voters are as eager for a "resurrection" as are 
Washington's black supporters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strong in Affluent Areas 
</P>
<P>
But it was Daley's surprising strength in the affluent northern lake-front 
wards that helped seal his victory in last month's Democratic primary. He is 
counting on doing well there again on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Washington twice won elections as mayor with a combination of monolithic black 
support and enough votes from Latinos and white liberals to put him over the 
top. Strained relations between blacks and Jews since Washington's death have 
caused some Jewish voters to back Daley, however. 
</P>
<P>
William Singer, a former alderman, supported Washington and was a staunch foe 
of the elder Daley but now backs the younger Daley. He said many voters in his 
lake-front ward are distrustful of Evans. "People view the people around Tim as 
radical or racist," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Evans' campaign has been further hampered by factionalism that erupted in the 
black community after Washington's death. He has tried to overcome it by using 
Daley's name to unite black voters behind him. 
</P>
<P>
Daley, though, is not cooperating. He has attracted prominent blacks to his 
campaign.

REJECT ABC'S OFFER, NABET ASKS MEMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A major technicians union with nearly 2,500 members at ABC in Los Angeles, New 
York and elsewhere said Sunday it is recommending rejection of a four-year 
contract the network calls its "final offer." 
</P>
<P>
But no strike vote has been taken, and "we're not talking strike yet," added 
John Krieger of the National Assn. of Broadcast Employees and Technicians. 
</P>
<P>
The contract proposal covers ABC employees at its Hollywood studio, radio 
stations KABC-AM and KLOS-FM and KABC-TV Channel 7. Also covered are employees 
at ABC's New York and Washington operations and radio and TV stations in San 
Francisco, New York and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ballots to Be Mailed 
</P>
<P>
Ballots will be mailed out by April 17 and the results reported to ABC on May 
3, Krieger said. The main drawback in ABC's proposal is job security, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the offer provides for three years of job guarantees, there are 
provisions by which ABC could fire up to 400 employees, 100 of them in radio, 
Krieger said. 
</P>
<P>
That contention was disputed by Patty Matson, a Capital Cities/ABC Inc. 
spokeswoman in New York. She called ABC's job-guarantee offer "unprecedented" 
for a network and said only 100 to 120 employees are excluded from the 
guarantee -- 60 of those in radio. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2,150 NABET Members 
</P>
<P>
She said ABC employs 2,150 NABET members on a full-time basis, including 1,850 
in technical areas. 
</P>
<P>
Contract talks, held in San Diego since March 1, ended late Friday with ABC's 
offer. The union's five-member negotiating committee unanimously voted to urge 
rejection of the offer, which ABC wants ratified by May 15, Krieger said.

S.F. PRO-CHOICE MARCH DRAWS 20,000

At least 20,000 people marched through the downtown area Sunday in a noisy 
abortion rights demonstration that organizers called the largest "pro-choice" 
gathering ever held in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
Police estimated the crowd at 20,000, but organizers of the "March for Women's 
Lives" said more than 30,000 participated in the march and rally at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Connell, 59, of Santa Barbara, marched with her 85-year-old mother and 
30-year-old daughter. Their sign read: "Three generations for choice." 
</P>
<P>
"I think what's before us is a choice of whether abortion is safe and legal or 
whether abortion is unsafe and illegal," Connell said. "It's not whether 
there's going to be abortion." 
</P>
<P>
There was only a minor sprinkling of anti-abortion sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
On the steps of Los Angeles City Hall on Sunday, pro-choice activists drew 
outlines of women's bodies on the ground and placed red-stained clothes hangers 
within each in what the Action Alliance to Keep Abortion Safe and Legal called 
a "bleed-in." 
</P>
<P>
Alliance spokespersons said they hoped "to remind the public of the increased 
deaths which will result of our young women if the right to a safe and legal 
abortion is lost." 
</P>
<P>
Spokespersons added that they had spoken to city officials and agreed to pay 
for the clean-up. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday night, similar figures were rendered in front of The Times Mirror 
building, across from City Hall.

After Juli Inkster hit her tee shot on the par three, 17th hole Sunday at the 
$500,000 Nabisco Dinah Shore tournament, her playing partner, JoAnne Carner, 
had something to say. 
</P>
<P>
"She said, 'Take it easy on us. Relax. You're getting too far ahead,' " Inkster 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, the tournament at Mission Hills Country Club that belonged to 
Inkster since the opening round was virtually history. 
</P>
<P>
After getting a par at No. 17, Inkster birdied the par five, 526-yard 18th hole 
to increase her winning margin to five strokes. 
</P>
<P>
By winning, Inkster earned $80,000 and has now won three major LPGA 
tournaments. She previously won the Dinah Shore and the du Maurier Classic in 
1984. She has also won three U.S. amateur titles. 
</P>

Moreover, her margin of victory was the largest in the 18-year history of the 
Dinah Shore tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Inkster shot a one-under-par 71 Sunday for a 72-hole total of 279. Carner, with 
four consecutive rounds of 71, finished second in a tie with Tammie Green at 
284. Green shot a final round 69. 
</P>
<P>
"I love this course. It suits my game," Inkster said. "I'm usually like a 
Yo-Yo, good and bad. But I put four solid rounds together and putted extremely 
well." 
</P>
<P>
There wasn't much drama on another warm day in the desert. However, after 
Carner birdied the par five, 499-yard fifth hole and Inkster bogeyed it, the 
eventual winner had only a three-shot lead. 
</P>
<P>
Carner said that Inkster was faltering slightly at that juncture. Then, Inkster 
made a 20-foot putt to save par on the par four, 357-yard 12th hole. 
</P>
<P>
"That putt just brightened her day," Carner said. 
</P>
<P>
Inkster agreed that the 12th hole was instrumental to her victory. Playing 
confidently, she birdied the par four, 390-yard 16th hole after her approach 
shot landed three feet from the pin. And she punctuated her runaway victory 
with a 15-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole. 
</P>
<P>
Carner said that Inkster also made a great shot from the fairway on the par 
four, 375-yard sixth hole. 
</P>
<P>
"She was stymied by a palm tree and then hit a nine-iron over the tree and onto 
the green where she two putted to save par," Carner said. 
</P>
<P>
As the front runner, Inkster had only one concern before the final round: 
"Everybody is shooting at me and I have no one to shoot at." 
</P>
<P>
But she said she was calm on the way to the course Sunday. Her husband, Brian, 
the pro at Los Altos Country Club, probably was more nervous. But he stayed out 
of view of his wife until the final putt. 
</P>
<P>
Then, he joined her to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
Inkster, 28, said her victory here in 1984 got her career going and Sunday's 
win raised her game another notch. 
</P>
<P>
Inkster said that she was inspired by playing with Carner, who will celebrate 
her 50th birthday Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Carner and Green each earned $34,000 for their finish. 
</P>
<P>
When Carner teed off someone from the gallery yelled, "Happy 50th birthday." 
Then, someone else responded, shouting, "She's 39 and holding." 
</P>
<P>
Later, in the interview room, Carner, already a member of the LPGA Hall of Fame 
said: "If I were 39, I'd be leading by seven shots." 
</P>
<P>
It was Carner's best finish in the Dinah Shore and, when asked to describe her 
feelings, she said: "I feel great. I made enough money to go fishing." 
</P>
<P>
Inkster, who has 12 career victories since joining the tour in 1983, had mixed 
feelings about leading throughout the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great feeling, but it's tiring mentally," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Green, playing in a group two holes ahead of Inkster and Carner, was seemingly 
out of contention Saturday when she shot a 75. But she came back with a 69 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my best finish by far," said Green, an Ohio native who joined the tour in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
After bogeying the first hole, Green, 29, birdied the ninth, 11th, 14th and 
16th holes. So she had a chance if Inkster faltered. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have to look at the leader board because the crowd told me where I 
was," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't, however, a memorable tournament for Amy Alcott, the defending 
champion, and Nancy Lopez, an established tour star. 
</P>
<P>
Alcott, after shooting a 71 Thursday, had rounds of 78, 78 and 76 for a 72-hole 
total of 303. Lopez finished at 291, 12 strokes behind Inkster. 
</P>
<P>
Inkster, who plans to play in the AI Star-Centinela Hospital Classic April 
14-16 at Rancho Park, had one final observation: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the only one who has a chance to win the grand slam now," she said, 
referring to the four majors, the Dinah Shore, du Maurier, the Mazda LPGA 
Classic and the U.S. Women's Open.

ALL IS NOT WELL WITH THE KNICKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The Knicks display a veneer that suggests contentment. But in reality, they are 
not a happy bunch going into the final 10 games of the regular season. Behind 
closed doors, this young, promising club is distracted by internal problems, 
troubles that have divided the team and could very well sabotage its lofty 
playoff ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
Several Knicks told Newsday of recent bickering among teammates, general "bad 
attitudes" and an atmosphere quite at odds with the wonderful team chemistry 
they had spoken of earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a soap opera. You wouldn't expect this from a pro team," one player 
said. "Maybe in high school. We are here to win a championship, aren't we?" 
</P>
<P>
Veteran Trent Tucker said, "In a long season you hit some bumps in the road. 
It's mostly just some young egos clashing." 
</P>
<P>
In the past week, according to several players: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Guard Gerald Wilkins went into a tirade during a team meeting because of 
kidding from All-Star guard Mark Jackson regarding a published report that 
questioned Wilkins' passing or lack of it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Players who spoke on the condition of anonymity said they were being 
"frozen out" of the offense by the other players on the floor, and another 
player said some players might intentionally not be passing the ball to 
recently acquired Kiki Vandeweghe. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A key player sounded off because he was not granted a first-class seat on a 
flight from LaGuardia to Charlotte last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 -- More than one player has complained openly of decreased playing time since 
Vandeweghe's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
"It all could be detrimental. It could hurt us on the court if we don't get it 
together," one player said. 
</P>
<P>
"I just think it's been a long year and it's affecting us some," Jackson, a 
co-captain, said. "It's a part of growing. Right now, we have to take two steps 
back to get one step ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Rick Pitino, sensing turmoil, called a team meeting late last week to 
allow players to voice their grievances and clear the air. 
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Wilkins took center stage, according to players who were 
present, and spoke loudly about "not appreciating" Jackson's bringing up a 
short item in last Tuesday's New York Post that read, "At least one year-round 
Knick is grumbling about Gerald Wilkins' unwillingness to give up the ball . . 
. " 
</P>
<P>
Wilkins' outburst shocked the team. Jackson was angry and felt betrayed since 
it was not unusual for him and Wilkins to joke with one another. The two, who 
were at one time pretty close, have not had any further problems, but they 
haven't been buddy-buddy, either. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkins seemed to regret the incident and would only say, "I'd rather not get 
into specifics. As far as I'm concerned, there's not a lot to be concerned 
with." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said: "We just have to stay on course to get back to the team we were. 
We have to get back to enjoying the game and enjoying each other." 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Al Bianchi, who said he and Pitino recently discussed the 
team's inner troubles, added: "Rick has tried to put a stop to (the joking) 
because some kids can't handle it. And you know what? That joking goes over 
better when you're winning." 
</P>
<P>
Two Knicks said they felt they were being intentionally and mysteriously denied 
the ball by certain players. "Everybody on this team works hard and deserves to 
get the ball when he's open," one player said. "Sometimes that's not happening. 
Sometimes it's pretty obvious." 
</P>
<P>
Said another player: "Sometimes, I don't get any shots. And it's not because I 
wasn't open, either." 
</P>
<P>
Still another player suggested that Vandeweghe has not always received the ball 
when he's been open. "It's a shame. Guys are insecure," the player said. 
</P>
<P>
That same player said a key Knick got upset when he was not granted a 
first-class seat on the Easter flight to Charlotte. There were only eight 
first-class seats available and this player, who usually sits up front, had to 
sit in the coach section along with three teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"That was all about ego," the player said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, some players are getting particularly upset about their minutes being 
cut since Vandeweghe came aboard. After Thursday's win over Dallas, Charles 
Oakley said, "I'm trying to do things right. But you need time to get into the 
flow. . . . We brought in Kiki and everyone's minutes are cut." 
</P>
<P>
Forward Johnny Newman, whose time has been cut, would not address that issue 
directly. "Well, I think we are not clicking like we were before, for whatever 
reasons," Newman said. "I think we should acknowledge that and move on to 
correct it." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would, as a veteran, take measures to patch together the team, 
Sidney Green said, "As a veteran, I'll mind my own damn business." 
</P>
<P>
It is clear that these problems are a direct result of the Knicks' relative 
youth and inexperience at handling success. Also, their recent stretch of bad 
play -- six losses in their last 11 games, including three straight at one 
point -- has compounded the troubles. 
</P>
<P>
Several attempts to reach Pitino yesterday were unsuccessful. But Bianchi said, 
"Let's remember, we haven't won anything. We have to bust our tails to win it. 
We're trying to win in June. I can see that the guys are a little sideways, 
that something's not right. I understand. Guys get cranky, especially with a 
young group. It's winning and losing and they're mentally tired. Every team has 
a spell in the season that things get a little sideways, on and off the court. 
This is ours. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to get back on the right track. Some players may have to make some 
sacrifices. I think some of this is festered from getting Kiki. But it's not 
all related to Kiki. I sensed something prior to the trade. When you have 12 
egos, this kind of thing is going to happen."

NCAA BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: SETON HALL VS. MICHIGAN; 
</P>
<P>
LONG ROAD ENDS TONIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
WITH UNLIKELY MARCH OVER, MICHIGAN AND SETON HALL GET THE FINAL CALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
P.J. Carlesimo has been gone so long, so unexpectedly long, that he had to call 
the doorman at his apartment building to have him take in the overflowing mail. 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall left South Orange, N.J., on March 14, and the Pirates have been on 
the road since. 
</P>
<P>
The days of March also held far more than could have been imagined for Steve 
Fisher, the Michigan man who became coach just two days before the Wolverines' 
first-round game. Now, the slow-speaking coach who describes himself as "plain 
vanilla" is a victory away from becoming the first rookie coach to win a 
national championship. 
</P>
<P>
"Once again, yes, it's like a dream," Fisher said. "Don't wake me until 
Tuesday." 
</P>
<P>
One way or another, the road -- and one team's dream -- will end tonight when 
Seton Hall plays Michigan for the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
championship in the Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
One team will win its first NCAA championship, and one will go home with second 
place. Michigan has played for the championship twice -- in 1965 and 1976 -- 
and lost both times. Seton Hall is in the NCAA final for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
It is a game that will pit the overwhelming athleticism of a Michigan team that 
has tended to underachieve against a Seton Hall team so balanced that its 
leading scorer -- John Morton -- may be one of the lesser known starters. 
</P>
<P>
It will pit Fisher, a folksy man who will have to wait until after the season 
ends to learn if Athletic Director Bo Schembechler will hire him, against 
Carlesimo, the quick wit with the New York accent born to say the words 
basketball in the Garden, who swears that it wouldn't matter who coached these 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
While many people still press for an answer to the unanswerable question -- 
Would Michigan be here if Bill Frieder were still the coach? -- Carlesimo tends 
to think he and Fisher are both nice guys, but that the teams are the thing. 
</P>
<P>
"We're here because we have the best players in the country," Carlesimo said of 
his own team. "I understand how overrated a head coach's role is. If I couldn't 
coach tomorrow, my assistants could do the job just as well. I'm not belittling 
the job Steve has done at all. To handle the pressure and do the things he's 
done, that's been the hard part. The Xs and Os, anybody knew Fish could do 
that. But they have great players. With Bill or with Steve, I think they'd be 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Last year's championship matched Kansas and Oklahoma, two Big Eight teams who 
had seen each other play so much they were sick and tired of it. This year, 
Michigan (29-7) plays Seton Hall (31-6), a school only two Michigan starters -- 
Rumeal Robinson and Mike Griffin -- could locate before the tournament began. 
</P>
<P>
As late as midday Sunday, the players knew little more of each other than a few 
names -- the Michigan players mostly knew Andrew Gaze and Ramon Ramos, and 
Seton Hall players knew Glen Rice and Robinson, the point guard. But by the 
time practices were over, they knew plenty. 
</P>
<P>
The Michigan players had seen the beginning of Seton Hall's semifinal against 
Duke Saturday at their hotel before they left for the Kingdome to play Illinois 
in the second semifinal. Before they got on the bus, Seton Hall was down 18 
points. 
</P>
<P>
When they got to the Kingdome, Seton Hall was ahead. Michigan was impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw Seton Hall has a lot of class," Terry Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall, after finishing showers and interviews, caught only the second half 
of Michigan's game against Illinois, including Sean Higgins' game-winning 
basket off an offensive rebound. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw only the last part of the game," Gaze said. "That team can play." 
</P>
<P>
Carlesimo looks at Michigan and sees a team that he calls "scary," especially 
at forward, where Rice and Terry Mills play. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind playing a team that's bigger than us if we're quicker, or quicker 
than us if we're stronger," Carlesimo said. "The thing that's scary about 
Michigan is the combination of all three -- size, strength and quickness -- 
they present. . . . They're very, very well coached, they play good defense, 
they get the ball up and down the floor, they shoot the ball very well outside, 
and they can be an awesome rebounding team. But that's the kind of team you're 
going to play if you play for the national championship." 
</P>
<P>
It is a game likely to present some charged matchups. 
</P>
<P>
At point guard, Michigan's Robinson will go against Seton Hall's Gerald Greene, 
who kept the Pirates in the game with his penetration against Duke. 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall will have to contend with Rice, who averages 25 points a game and 
who gets a vote for player of the year from Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been as good as any player in America, maybe better than any player in 
America in the last five games," Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
Gaze, or perhaps John Morton, is likely to draw the defensive assignment on 
Rice. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'll have my hands full," Gaze said. 
</P>
<P>
Talented as it is, Michigan has not played this well all season. 
</P>
<P>
"We've all heard that statement that we don't play hard all the time, that 
Michigan doesn't play 40 minutes," Rice said. "Hopefully we can prove our 
character is solid." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Higgins said, Michigan's abundance of athletic ability sometimes 
hampered the team. 
</P>
<P>
"When you play on a team with a bunch of All-Americans out of high school, you 
find that you would wait for someone else to jump on the floor for a loose 
ball, wait for someone else to do it," Higgins said. "Last year, we waited for 
Gary Grant. This year a lot of us were waiting for Glen." 
</P>
<P>
But long about the end of the season, and most notedly long about the beginning 
of the tournament, Michigan started playing its best. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, for whatever reason, it's true, we have had sub-par performances 
in the tournament," center Loy Vaught said. "Our main goal is to silence all 
the critics. With one more win, I don't see how anybody can criticize us." 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall, by contrast, has no players with brilliant individual reputations 
-- at least not outside of the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the fact that our kids play unselfishly and because of the fact 
that defense is a big part of our game and because of our depth, it hurts their 
individual recognition," Carlesimo said. 
</P>
<P>
It's a team that can play as well with Anthony Avent, Michael Cooper and Frantz 
Volcy in off the bench, as it can with the starting lineup of Greene, Morton, 
Ramos, Gaze and Daryll Walker. 
</P>
<P>
And perhaps more than anything, it is a team that appreciates its good fortune. 
</P>
<P>
"Any of the teams we've played in the past three or four games could be here," 
Carlesimo said. "Indiana, UNLV, Duke. . . . This tournament has become a 
situation where 15, 20, maybe 25 teams have a legitimate chance when it starts 
to win the whole thing. To win six games, you have to be very, very good and 
very, very lucky."

THE RISE OR FALL; 
</P>
<P>
DODGERS COULD HAVE RECURRING DREAM OR TERRIBLE NIGHTMARE IN '89 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON EDES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is late on a Monday afternoon, Oct. 2, 1989, and Dodger Stadium is shrouded 
in shadows. It is the top of the ninth inning of a one-game playoff between the 
Dodgers and San Diego Padres to determine the champion of the National League 
West. Jay Howell, the Dodger reliever, is attempting to protect a one-run lead. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two outs. Roberto Alomar is on third, Tony Gwynn is on second. First 
base is open. The batter is Jack Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Scioscia, the Dodger catcher, looks into the dugout for a sign. Tom 
Lasorda, the manager, gives him the go-ahead to pitch to Clark. In the Padre 
dugout, Manager Jack McKeon flashes a wicked grin. Howell checks the runners, 
then delivers his pitch. It's a fastball, belt-high, headed for the middle of 
the plate. Clark swings, and . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Lasorda should have his share of nightmares this summer. This business 
of repeating as champions of big-league baseball is no stroll through the park 
-- no revelry in Riverfront, no soiree in Shea, no carnival in Candlestick, no 
barbecue in Busch, no whimsy in Wrigley. 
</P>
<P>
Has anyone heard Lasorda popping off this spring, guaranteeing back-to-back 
titles like his basketball counterpart, Pat Riley of the Lakers? Well, yes, 
actually, when Lasorda spoke in Vero Beach, Fla., at the 30th reunion dinner of 
the 1959 Dodgers, the first L.A.-based Dodger team to win a World Series. But 
the next day, Lasorda hastened to amend his remarks to a reporter. What he 
meant to say, Lasorda insisted, was that he hoped this team would become the 
first Dodger team to repeat, and the first in baseball since the New York 
Yankees whipped Lasorda's Dodgers in 1977 and '78. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers of the Duke and PeeWee, Jackie and Skoonj, Newk and Campy, never 
won two Series in a row. The Dodgers of Koufax and Drysdale, the Davis boys, 
Wills and Roseboro? Nope. Garv and the Penguin, Fergy and Reggie, Lopes and 
Russell? Uh-uh. 
</P>
<P>
So, the wise guys are looking pretty smug these days when they peg the Dodgers 
to take a classic fall, rather than wind up in the Fall Classic, again this 
season. Of course, these are the same wise guys who picked the Dodgers to 
finish no better than fourth in 1988, so go figure. 
</P>
<P>
What do we think? That not even Sylvester Stallone would dare to write a sequel 
to match last year's Orel IV, which co-starred Kirk Gibson as The Natural and 
featured a bunch of scene-stealers called Stuntmen. 
</P>
<P>
But scanning a diamond full of Dodgers, it's relatively easy to project a 
season of Lasorda's fondest dreams, or most terrifying nightmares. Herewith, 
position by position, are best-case and worst-case (in italics) scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
First base -- Eddie Murray returns to the city of his birth, Los Angeles, and 
terrorizes the National League the same way he tore up Little League in South 
Central Los Angeles. The switch-hitter shatters the club record for home runs 
of 33, held by Steve Garvey and Pedro Guerrero, drives in more than 100 runs, 
wins another Gold Glove, and is voted the team's "Good Guy" award by reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Murray is a $2-million bust, his once considerable skills continuing an 
erosion that began in Baltimore last season, when he was hitting .231 with four 
home runs in June and didn't recover until Frank Robinson, the manager, made 
him a designated hitter. New contact lenses don't help, his fielding reminds 
people of Pedro Guerrero, and he adds L.A. reporters to his hit list of media 
he won't speak to after someone reminds him that he batted just .228 with 
runners in scoring position last season, compared to his career average of 
.305. 
</P>
<P>
 Second base -- Willie Randolph, who didn't get as much as a phone call from 
the New York Yankees when he no longer figured in their plans, has the last 
laugh at the expense of George Steinbrenner. While Steve Sax yearns to break 
out of the Bronx Zoo, Randolph shows the same skills that made him a five-time 
All-Star, hitting close to .300, scoring nearly 100 runs, walking almost 80 
times and making Dodger pitchers wonder how they ever got by without his 
double-play touch behind them. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Randolph, who missed 52 games in 1988, breaks down a month into the 
season as either his a) knees, b) wrist or c) rib muscles give out on him. 
Randolph, who no longer can run, proves completely unsuited for the role of 
Dodger leadoff man, especially because he is hitting no higher than the .230 
average he finished with in 1988 and doesn't steal a base until just before the 
All-Star break. By July, when he turns 35, Randolph is replaced in the lineup 
by Mariano Duncan. 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop -- Alfredo Griffin proves that 1988 was an aberration, when he hit 
.199 and couldn't avoid being hit by Dwight Gooden's fastball, which fractured 
his right hand and caused him to miss 57 games. Griffin's average returns to 
the .258 range, which is what he hit in 12 seasons in the American League, and 
his play at short ranges from the steady to the spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Griffin, whose .141 average in day games last season was the worst in 
the National League, proves his performance was no fluke as his average drops 
below his playing weight. By July, Griffin is so bewildered at the plate that 
Lasorda contemplates replacing him with Mariano Duncan, except Duncan has 
already replaced Willie Randolph. So, Lasorda calls on Dave Anderson, the only 
National League player with 200 or more at-bats in each of the last four 
seasons to fail to hit .250 or better in any of those seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Third base -- Jeff Hamilton, finally providing stability at a position that 
has been tried by 22 Dodgers during the '80s, justifies Lasorda's description 
of him as the best third baseman in the league by batting a respectable .250, 
reaching double figures in home runs, and by showing off his bazooka for an 
arm. All of the above show why the Dodgers were 50-29-1 in his 80 starts last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Hamilton, given the starting job in spring training even though he has yet 
to convince skeptics he can hit big-league pitching, falters badly at the 
plate. He fails to match his 1988 ratio of one home run per every 50 at-bats, 
which is how he finished with six home runs. Afield, he continues a trend he 
began in Florida, when he made eight errors. By July, Hamilton is in 
Albuquerque and Tracy Woodson is the third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
Left field -- Kirk Gibson, ignoring his sore right knee, improves all of his 
numbers with Eddie Murray hitting behind him in the Dodger lineup and becomes 
the first National League player to win back-to-back MVP awards since Atlanta's 
Dale Murphy (1982-83). Gibson hits dramatic home runs, scores from second base 
on wild pitches, and terrorizes his teammates into winning. Even Orel Hershiser 
adopts his spiked-hair look. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson, who has averaged just over 100 games in his 10 big-league seasons, 
becomes a regular on the Dodger disabled list, as his right knee fails to hold 
up under the strain Gibson places on it. Gibson tries to play through the pain 
and tries every possible cure. With the pennant on the line in September, 
Lasorda reluctantly sends up Dave Anderson to pinch-hit for the crippled 
Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
Center field -- John Shelby. One of the most underrated Dodgers, Shelby quietly 
strings together another season like 1988, when he set career highs in games, 
at-bats, runs and triples, batted .263 and had a league-best 24-game hitting 
streak. After hitting only 10 home runs in 1988, Shelby returns to his 1987 
form, when he hit 21 homers for the Dodgers in just 120 games. 
</P>
<P>
 John Shelby, the easiest player to strike out in the league last season -- he 
averaged one strikeout for every 4.3 plate appearances -- continues the slump 
that began in the postseason, when he struck out 19 times in 12 games against 
the New York Mets and Oakland A's and batted .190. By July, Lasorda is forced 
to try Mike Davis in center. 
</P>
<P>
Right field -- Mike Marshall, a picture of contentment after signing a 
three-year deal with the Dodgers, makes a mockery of opposition attempts to 
pitch around Eddie Murray by driving in more than 100 runs to lead the team in 
RBIs for the second straight season, and hits more than 20 home runs for the 
fourth time as a Dodger. He also plays in 140-plus games for the third time in 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Marshall, caving in under the pressure of being the hitter opponents dare 
to beat them, strikes out more than 135 times, his most since he went down 137 
times in 1985. Back problems return to haunt him, limiting him to the 104 games 
he played in 1987. Before the end of the season, Lasorda is platooning him with 
Mike Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher -- Mike Scioscia, in the last year of his contract, responds by hitting 
.296, matching his career best in 1985. He also shows his home run off Dwight 
Gooden in the playoffs was no fluke by reaching double figures in home runs for 
the first time in his career. And, of course, he remains the world's foremost 
plate-blocker. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Scioscia fouls up his swing by trying to prove his home run off Dwight 
Gooden was no fluke. Fears about his marketability next winter, when the threat 
of a player strike will overshadow all negotiations, make him reluctant to risk 
an injury. That becomes apparent when 5-foot-6 Rafael Belliard runs over 
Scioscia at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitching -- Orel Hershiser, in the prime of his career at age 30, becomes the 
first pitcher to go through a season unscored upon. Tim Leary split-fingers his 
way to another half-dozen shutouts, Tim Belcher beats Tom Browning with a 
perfect game, Fernando Valenzuela revives Fernandomania, John Tudor reprises 
Tommy John, and Ramon Martinez -- recalled in July -- wins 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
In the bullpen, Jay Howell and Alejandro Pena record more KOs than Tyson, and 
Tim Crews, who was left off the postseason roster, and Ricky Horton make Brian 
Holton the answer to a trivia question. 
</P>
<P>
 Orel Hershiser strains his vocal cords with one too many interviews. His 
personal computer erases its memory. He loses the cheat sheet he carries with 
him to the mound. He needs therapy after giving up a home run to Ozzie Smith. 
Tim Leary shows why his teammates call him Norman Bates. Tim Belcher succumbs 
to the sophomore jinx. Fernando Valenzuela, his shoulder shot, causes Lasorda 
to curse the day he ever let Fernando throw 160 pitches in a single game. John 
Tudor, despite a gallant comeback attempt, chooses to retire. Ramon Martinez 
can't learn how to throw a curveball. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bullpen, Jay Howell is discovered to have tobacco juice stains on his 
glove, and is suspended by Bart Giamatti. Alejandro Pena takes too long between 
pitches, and is suspended by Giamatti. Tim Crews is inadvertently left off the 
regular-season roster. 
</P>
<P>
Bench -- Just as in 1988, the Stuntmen regularly save the day. 
</P>
<P>
No one thinks Mickey Hatcher is funny anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager -- Tommy Lasorda, a happy winner, gains 30 pounds by October. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Lasorda, an unhappy loser, gains 30 pounds by October. 
</P>
<P>
 Care to wager which scenario will come closer to being the truth in 1989?

JORDAN GETS AN OSCAR AS BULLS BEAT NEW JERSEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The fabulous Oscar Robertson, in his second season in the National Basketball 
Assn., averaged a triple-double a game. 
</P>
<P>
That was during the 1961-62 season when pro basketball was not yet recognized 
as a major sport and long before anyone came up with the idea of a 
triple-double. 
</P>
<P>
A 6-foot-5 guard, the Big O, as he was known, averaged 30.8 points, 12.5 
rebounds and 11.4 assists. He also averaged 44.4 minutes and when he was in the 
game, he handled the basketball all the time. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps if he sets his mind to it, Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls could 
match Robertson's feat. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, who has been the Bulls' point guard for the last 13 games, had his 
fifth consecutive triple-double Sunday at Chicago to lead the Bulls to a 106-95 
victory over outmanned New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-6 guard had 28 points, 14 rebounds and 12 assists to lead the Bulls 
to their 10th victory in the last 12 games. The Nets have lost 12 straight and 
13 of 14 away from home. 
</P>
<P>
There is no intention here of disparaging Robertson's achievement, but it 
couldn't happen in the fast-paced game of today. Also, the rebounds aren't 
available because shooters are so much better than they were in those days. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Jordan was not happy moving from shooting guard. He made the move 
because the Bulls needed a playmaker. Now, he's beginning to like the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to admit that my playing career could be extended," Jordan said. "I'm 
still learning the position. The key is I can go back and help out instead of 
being posted down low." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Doug Collins said it would be up to Jordan if he stays at point guard. He 
did point out that Jordan can pace himself better, is less likely to get hurt 
and doesn't have to cut and break for the basket as much. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Willis Reed of the Nets said, "It is becoming apparent these guys just 
don't want to play." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 117, Boston 100 -- Robert Parish, despite a severely bruised knee, 
made the first three baskets at Richfield, Ohio. He knew it was nothing to get 
excited about. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers' younger, healthier big man, Brad Daugherty wasn't even warm yet. 
Daugherty proceeded to score 20 of Cleveland's first 33 points and made 10 
consecutive shots before finally missing as the Cavaliers build a commanding 
65-51 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Harper took charge in the second half. Harper, faster and quicker than all 
the Celtics, had 13 of his 28 points in the first six minutes of the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics, 8-26 on the road, fell three back of Philadelphia in the fight for 
seventh place in the East and the right to avoid Detroit in the first round of 
the playoffs. It was the start of a four-game trip. The Celtics are three games 
ahead of Washington in the battle for the final playoff spot with 11 games 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Parish, obviously bothered by the knee, wound up with only 10 points, and on 
defense had no chance against Daugherty. 
</P>
<P>
However, a few days off did wonders for Kevin McHale and his sore feet. He came 
off the bench to score 34 points in 33 minutes. In his two games since his 
brief rest, he has 64 points. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the Celtics will have to go without their best player, Larry Bird, 
who has missed most of the season because of operations on both Achilles 
tendons. He hasn't worked out in three weeks and reportedly may need more 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 108, Houston 99 -- The Rockets have not won at Philadelphia in 15 
years. If they keep playing the way they did in this one, it will be at least 
that long again before they win. 
</P>
<P>
After a decent first quarter, the Rockets collapsed, and Charles Barkley and 
Hersey Hawkins shot them down. Except for Otis Thorpe, who had a career high 37 
points, the Rockets couldn't compete. 
</P>
<P>
While Houston center Akeem Olajuwon was scoring a season low 10 points, Barkley 
had 26 points and Hawkins scored 23 for the 76ers, who built a 62-47 halftime 
lead and coasted. 
</P>
<P>
The loss dropped the Rockets into a tie with Denver for second place in the 
Midwest Division. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas 98, Miami 96 -- Every game is a bitter, tough struggle, but the crippled 
Mavericks are gamely trying to win the last playoff spot in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Adrian Dantley banked in a 20-footer as time ran out at Miami to give the 
Mavericks the victory and put them half a game behind Portland. 
</P>
<P>
The Mavericks lost their sixth man Roy Tarpley because of a drug problem, 
7-foot-2 James Donaldson because of an injury and traded away Mark Aguirre. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 120, Golden State 103 -- Although they did not play well and shot 
only 44% from the field, the Bullets' slim chance to make the playoffs improved 
with the win at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
The Bullets kept alive their hopes because the Warriors played even worse. They 
shot only 41.4%, rebounded poorly and had 21 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Darrell Walker, with 16 points, 10 rebounds and 9 assists, barely missed a 
triple-double for the Bullets. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 132, Indiana 109 -- The Hawks led, 61-56, at halftime at Indianapolis, 
before scoring on 11 of their first 12 possessions in the second half to turn 
the game into a rout. 
</P>
<P>
Dominique Wilkins scored 19 of his 23 points after intermission and three other 
Hawks had more than 20 points. DAN HAFNER

SAN BERNARDINO HANDICAP;

<P>
PINCAY PICKS UP RUHLMANN, WINS STAKES RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The feeling was mutual -- and, after the running of the $320,600 San Bernardino 
Handicap, it also was mutuel. Trainer Charlie Whittingham was as happy about 
obtaining Laffit Pincay for one of his horses as Pincay was to be riding 
Ruhlmann in a rich stakes race. 
</P>
<P>
With Pincay replacing the ailing Pat Valenzuela, Ruhlmann showed Sunday that he 
is more than a miler by winning the 1 1/8-mile San Bernardino by 1 1/4 lengths, 
with Whittingham's other starter in the six-horse field, Lively One, finishing 
second before a crowd of 45,322. 
</P>
<P>
Ruhlmann broke the track record in his last start, running a mile in 1:33 2/5, 
but the 4-year-old colt had won only once in his career beyond a mile, so the 
bettors sent him off the 5-2 second choice, with Lively One favored at 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Lively One, carrying high weight of 120 pounds, a pound more than Ruhlmann, 
finished ahead of Saratoga Passage, the third-place horse, by 3 1/2 lengths. 
The mutuel payoffs were $7, $3.40 and $3.20 for Ruhlmann, $2.60 and $2.40 for 
Lively One and $3.40 for Saratoga Passage. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie Davis rode Lively One for Whittingham for the second straight race, 
after winning with the colt on March 18, another day when Valenzuela called in 
sick and missed a winning mount. 
</P>
<P>
"Pat was at the track and left when he said he started throwing up," steward 
Pete Pedersen said Sunday. "We'll take a look at a doctor's report regarding 
this absence. He seems to be getting sick at the worst time, on days when he's 
scheduled to ride important horses." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela has been riding well. Going into late March, his mounts had earned 
$1.5 million this year, which ranked him eighth nationally. 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham's barn is bulging with stakes horses and Valenzuela is scheduled to 
ride Sunday Silence, another of the trainer's talented colts, who will be one 
of the favorites in next Sunday's Santa Anita Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Before the San Bernardino, Whittingham said that Valenzuela was still the rider 
for Sunday Silence, but added: "If he doesn't ride him, there are plenty of 
other good riders around. He's got the call on the horse, but then he had the 
call for me last time (with Lively One) and wasn't here, just like today." 
</P>
<P>
When Pincay's agent, Tony Matos, heard that Valenzuela was sick Sunday, he 
called Whittingham and got the mount that gave the jockey his 14th stakes 
victory of the season, one more than Eddie Delahoussaye. 
</P>
<P>
"Nice pickup," Pincay said of Ruhlmann. "I found out that I'd ride him about 
the sixth race (an hour before the San Bernardino)." 
</P>
<P>
Pincay had never ridden Ruhlmann before. The colt, who began his career in 
France before record executive Jerry Moss bought him, won the El Camino Real 
Derby at Bay Meadows early last year, then didn't run another good race for 
almost seven months. He bled while running eighth as the favorite in the 
Florida Derby, then was eighth in the Santa Anita Derby before clipping another 
horse's heels and falling in the California Derby. 
</P>
<P>
"He never had a serious problem as bleeder," Moss said. "We ran him twice in 
New York (where anti-bleeding medication is prohibited) and he won both races 
there last fall." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after a ninth-place finish in the Breeders' Cup Sprint at Churchill 
Downs in November, Moss transferred Ruhlmann from Bobby Frankel's barn to 
Whittingham. Pay the Butler, winner of last year's Japan Cup for Moss, also 
went from Frankel to Whittingham. 
</P>
<P>
"My operation has gotten a lot bigger," Moss said. "For example, I've got 18 or 
19 mares that I'm breeding now. Bobby was the titular head of all that, and he 
did a good job. But I was looking for different ideas, different information." 
</P>
<P>
Ruhlmann's record mile came in his first start for Whittingham. 
</P>
<P>
"I brought him along slowly," Whittingham said. "A lot of horses improve when 
they turn four. He wasn't overly campaigned at three and with age, I think he 
settled down a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Ruhlmann was wet in the paddock, which is not unusual. He broke on top and 
raced comfortably ahead of Good Taste for three-quarters of a mile, with 
Triteamtri, the second-place finisher in the Santa Anita Handicap, in third. 
Good Taste finished fourth and Triteamtri finished last with his jockey, Gary 
Stevens, suspecting that he bled from the lungs. Frankel trains both Saratoga 
Passage and Triteamtri. 
</P>
<P>
Lively One was about 10 lengths back going down the backstretch, but by the 
time the field reached the eighth pole, Whittingham could head for the winner's 
circle, because one of his two horses was certain to be represented there. 
Lively One came rolling out of the far turn, but his stablemate had too big of 
a lead. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a strong, strong horse," Davis said of Lively One. "He must be one of 
the best in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Ruhlmann was clocked in 1:47 1/5. The Mr. Leader-Indian Maiden colt gave 
Whittingham his 10th win in the San Bernardino and the latest victory kind of 
figured. Whittingham won the stake in every odd-numbered year of this decade. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Besides Sunday Silence, other probables for the Santa Anita Derby are Houston, 
Music Merci, Hawkster, Flying Continental and Mr. Bolg, who won his second race 
in eight starts against allowance company on March 10. . . . Barmera, another 
horse Pat Valenzuela was scheduled to ride Sunday, won the fifth race under 
Martin Pedroza. . . . James Corral left Santa Anita on crutches after a horse 
reared in the paddock before the fourth race and fell on him. X-rays of his 
right knee were negative and the jockey will be examined again Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Wayne Lukas won his fifth stake in three days Sunday when Surging 
captured the Comely for 3-year-old fillies at Aqueduct. . . . Lukas' other 
winners were Imaginary Lady and Manastash Ridge at Oaklawn Park, Open Mind at 
Laurel and Seattle Smooth at Golden Gate Fields. . . . At the Fair Grounds 
Sunday, Exclusive Partner, trained by Richard Mandella and ridden by Fernando 
Toro, won the Gold Cup Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Alyone, considered the best prospect owners Dorothy and Clarence Scharbauer and 
trainer Jack Van Berg had for the Kentucky Derby, is no longer a contender 
after running eighth and fifth at Santa Anita in his only two starts. The 
Scharbauers, who won the 1987 Derby with Alysheba, another son of Alydar, did 
have a winner Sunday when Prince Colony, another 3-year-old, made his second 
start and beat maidens in the sixth race. . . . Belle Poitrine, who had to be 
pulled up by Pedroza in Saturday's Santa Barbara Handicap, suffered a minor 
knee injury when she hit the rail.

Former Texas A&amp;M football player George Smith reversed his field again, 
denying a published report that he was offered $30,000 to recant charges he was 
paid "hush money" for his silence about National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
rules violations at the university, the Bryan (Tex.) Eagle reported.

The newspaper said that in a Saturday night telephone interview from his home 
in Atlanta, Smith denied a report in Saturday's editions of the Dallas Morning

university official to recant earlier charges that former A&amp;M coach Jackie 
Sherrill broke NCAA rules.

ANGEL NOTEBOOK; 
</P>
<P>
ABBOTT SHOWS SOME MAJOR STUFF IN MINOR ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Still think this Jim Abbott business is nothing more than an Angel publicity 
stunt? 
</P>
<P>
Submitted for your perusal: Sunday afternoon's exhibition game between the 
Angels and their triple-A farm club, the Edmonton Trappers, at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Final score: Edmonton 13, Angels 1. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott pitched for Edmonton as part of Angel Manager Doug Rader's lend-lease 
program and limited his once and future teammates to three paltry singles 
through six scoreless innings, striking out one Wally Joyner in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk McCaskill and Vance Lovelace, among others, pitched for the Angels. 
Combined, McCaskill and Lovelace surrendered 12 runs and 11 hits in four 
innings. Combined, McCaskill and Lovelace faced 15 Trappers in the top of the 
fourth, allowing 13 to reach base and 10 to score. 
</P>
<P>
By the middle of the fourth inning, the major leaguers trailed the minor 
leaguers, 12-0. 
</P>
<P>
Yep, there you have it. The Angels are keeping Abbott around for the publicity. 
</P>
<P>
Losing games by 13-1 scores is bad publicity. 
</P>
<P>
If Abbott doesn't belong in the Angels' starting rotation, what's to be said 
for McCaskill, the projected No. 2 starter whose earned-run average has risen 
from 4.20 to 4.79 to 6.49 to 8.19 in his last three starts? 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, McCaskill wobbled into the fourth inning trailing, 2-0, and allowed 
eight straight batters to reach base. The only out he would record in the 
inning came when Edmonton's Dan Grunhard was thrown out attempting to stretch a 
double into a triple. 
</P>
<P>
His line for the day: 3 1/3 innings, eight hits, nine runs (eight earned), 
three walks, no strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
And if Abbott doesn't belong on this Angel pitching staff, what's to be said 
for Lovelace, who replaced McCaskill and yielded three runs on three hits and 
three walks before he could retire the side? 
</P>
<P>
Lovelace, a 25-year old left-handed reliever with no big-league experience, has 
made the Angels the new-fangled way -- pitching his way onto the roster with a 
9.00 spring ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Who says the Angels are desperate for pitching? 
</P>
<P>
After watching five pitchers on his opening-day staff, plus Edmonton-bound 
Stewart Cliburn, surrender a total of 17 hits, Rader took a deep sigh and 
summed up the afternoon thusly: 
</P>
<P>
"Abbott had a good tuneup. After that, it's pretty hard to find any more pluses 
on the whole deal." 
</P>
<P>
Rader had Abbott pitch for Edmonton in an attempt to have both McCaskill and 
Abbott work at least six innings. Abbott got his work in, but McCaskill 
succeeded only in getting Rader all worked up. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what to tell you," Rader said, shaking his head. "Obviously, he's 
not quite good enough yet. But regardless of how I feel, I think Kirk must be 
concerned -- and if I add my concern to that burden, it doesn't serve the kid 
any purpose." 
</P>
<P>
Rader shrugged off Lovelace's rocky outing, attributing it his recent 
hospitalization for an intestinal disorder. 
</P>
<P>
"Vance was weak," Rader said. "All we wanted to do today was get him some work. 
He was flat on his back for a few days, so I can certainly understand that one. 
</P>
<P>
"Mac is still a puzzle. . . . He throws a fastball and they hit it. He throws a 
breaking ball and it seems to bounce (in the dirt). And when he doesn't bounce 
it, he gets behind in the count. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how to straighten it out, other than to be supportive and hope he 
and Lach (pitching coach Marcel Lachemann) figure it out." 
</P>
<P>
Abbott, meanwhile, expressed relief after completing his longest -- and most 
effective -- outing of the spring. It was his first scoreless stint as an Angel 
and lowered his ERA to 3.91 and improved his record to 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel pressure to justify their decision to 
keep me," Abbott said. "The last thing I want to hear in three weeks is, 'He 
was here too early.' 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't think that's going to be the case. I feel like I deserve to be 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Rader seconds that opinion, saying, "His physical and emotional ability made 
that decision easy." 
</P>
<P>
That and the state of the 1989 Angel pitching staff.

MIKE DOWNEY: AT MICHIGAN, HIS ARTISTRY DOESN'T END ON THE COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
As he was touring the Louvre last summer, or pausing on his morning strolls of 
the boulevards of Paris to inspect the canvases of the various street artists, 
Rumeal Robinson thought a lot about how art imitates life, and the way life 
imitates art. 
</P>
<P>
He thought about the gallery he intends to open someday, the one that will 
enable him to exhibit the works of undiscovered geniuses such as himself. He 
made a mental memo that when the barnstorming University of Michigan basketball 
team returned from its European junket, he must submerge back into that 
makeshift studio in the basement of his Ann Arbor apartment building to 
complete that portrait of one of his professors that he had been putting off. 
</P>
<P>
Renoir, meet Rumeal. 
</P>
<P>
Already this young man has mastered the art of survival. He was homeless, 
abandoned by both parents as a child in Jamaica, then adopted by the parents of 
an American boy he barely knew. He also had a learning disability, and was 
forced to miss his freshman year of college basketball because his Scholastic 
Aptitude Test threw words at him that were beyond his scholastic aptitude. 
</P>
<P>
"Words like regatta. What did somebody like myself know what regatta meant?" 
Robinson remembered. "You're not going to see any regattas in Boston or the 
Bronx, the places where I spent most of my time. It's just like black history. 
I'm sure you wouldn't have known a lot about black history, if somebody had 
asked you about that on some test. You're not taught black history." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than pout, Robinson took advantage of his year of Proposition 
48-enforced idleness. He embraced collegiate life. He took art and psychology 
courses. He played basketball in an intramural league with pre-med and pre-law 
yuppies who convinced themselves that they could match jumpers with the Parade 
All-American from Patrick Ewing's high school in Cambridge, Mass., which amused 
Rumeal to no end. 
</P>
<P>
No one or nothing could keep this kid down. Athletically, he has risen to great 
heights, playing the playmaker's role for the Michigan team that will engage 
Seton Hall here tonight for college basketball's national championship, earning 
acclaim as the best junior guard in the land. Academically? Rumeal Robinson, 
product of Cambridge, Class of Prop. 48, will receive his degree in December 
from a university that fancies itself "the Harvard of the Midwest." 
</P>
<P>
"Masterpiece Theatre" was rarely so compelling. 
</P>
<P>
As an adolescent he whiled away balmy tropical days diving into the deep blue 
sea for lobsters. Often, little Rumeal reclined on the hot sand of Negril Beach 
until sundown, in no particular hurry to get home because nobody in particular 
was expecting him there. His father, Rupert, he never knew. His mother, Virus, 
took off for the mainland without him. A grandmother and some cousins looked 
after him, provided a bed, until he was 6, when Virus sent word from her new 
home near Boston, wanting there to be a mother-and-child reunion. 
</P>
<P>
It lasted two years. Then, again, she was gone. A foster family took Rumeal in. 
His mother reappeared. Back he moved with her. Just as abruptly, she split. 
Managing to scrape up enough money for fare to Jamaica, Rumeal returned to the 
island, in search of his father. When he got there, an aunt told him Rupert 
Robinson was dead. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, when he was 13, Rumeal was playing flag football with another boy 
named Donald Ford, who heard of his predicament. Louis Ford, a Boston 
letter-carrier, and his wife, Helen, listened to their son's story, then asked 
his friend if he cared to move in with the Fords and their other four children. 
Rumeal did. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Ford wept four years later when her latest arrival announced that he had 
chosen Michigan, so far away, over Villanova, which wasn't that long a drive 
from their Massachusetts home. She feared she might never again see Rumeal play 
the game he had come to play so well. When Michigan made it to this year's 
Final Four, the Fords could afford to send only Helen and one of the children 
to Seattle. They came to the game. 
</P>
<P>
After a Boston newspaper account chronicled the family's situation, a donor 
sprang for another ticket. Louis Ford hopped on a jet Saturday, flew 
cross-country, and arrived at Seattle's Kingdome with eight minutes remaining 
in Michigan's game against Illinois. Not until he reached the team's hotel 
afterward did Rumeal realize his foster father had, for the first time, seen 
him play a college game. 
</P>
<P>
Everything he has endured, Robinson said here Sunday, has "taught me to be a 
stronger person. I'm not going to dwell on the past. It was very sad to be so 
young and all alone, without a real home. A lot of older people came along to 
help me. The bad times? I honestly believe there aren't really any bad times. 
There are just some times that are better than other times." 
</P>
<P>
Few times have been better than the one he is having now. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson described it, as any person of his background might, as something on 
the order of receiving a new bicycle as a gift. At night, you want to ride it, 
but you can't, so you lay in bed and think about it, he said. Next morning, you 
can't wait to get back on. He thinks of the national tournament this way. 
</P>
<P>
From the end of last season, when Robinson threw 29 points, six assists and 
five rebounds at North Carolina in a losing cause in the West Regional in this 
very town, to the start of this season, when Rumeal outplayed Oklahoma's 
much-publicized Mookie Blaylock head to head, everything has been going his 
way. Even the ouster of the man who recruited him, Bill Frieder, never swayed 
him, although they were so close that Robinson was the first player Frieder 
phoned after accepting the Arizona State job. 
</P>
<P>
Although generally a sweetheart, Robinson sometimes can be cocky, almost 
overbearing, about his own abilities. He resents, for example, being compared 
to Gary Grant, the former Michigan guard now with the Clippers, even saying 
when he was younger: "I am the type of player who can do anything, like no one 
you've ever seen in the Midwest. I played in the shadow of Gary Grant for one 
year, but I have the ability to pass and shoot." 
</P>
<P>
Comparisons of any kind disturb Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody ever compared Julius Erving or Magic Johnson to anyone," he told the 
Detroit Free Press. "The only guy they ever compared me to was a guard in New 
York City who never played in college. He was shot eight times by the police -- 
in the wrong place at the wrong time -- and never played again. His name was 
Jimmy something." 
</P>
<P>
There is something about his manner, or maybe the listener's knowledge of his 
upbringing, that makes Robinson's words seem more fiercely independent than 
boastful. As when someone Sunday asked him which guards gave him trouble in the 
tough Big Ten Conference this season. Said Robinson: "I don't feel anybody did. 
The only thing that ever bothered me from playing my game is Rumeal Robinson. 
Me." 
</P>
<P>
Until you understand somebody, you shouldn't judge him. That is Robinson's 
advice. That is what unnerved him about those SAT questions, that they never 
take into account the cultural differences of a kid from Jamaica versus a kid 
from Seattle versus a kid from New York who, in Robinson's own words, rarely 
runs with the sort of friends who rush home to pick up a book, or even to eat 
supper at the same time as the rest of the family. 
</P>
<P>
"We were the first guinea pigs of that test," Robinson said, speaking also on 
behalf of teammate Terry Mills, with whom he roomed while Prop. 48 denied them 
freshman eligibility. "Nobody gave us a legitimate chance, from first grade on. 
Nobody said, 'There's going to be a test. If you fail it, you're out.' " He was 
considered intelligent enough to be accepted into college, but he was prejudged 
incapable of juggling schoolwork and basketball simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
Rumeal used the free time to refine his art. He specialized in flowers, Georgia 
O'Keeffe style, and landscapes. He worked in everything from oil to chalk. He 
studied everything from animators to amateurs to the masters. 
</P>
<P>
"It was amazing to see how well they drew in Paris. They have so much to draw 
in that city, the old architecture, the charm. The location is important. I 
could see myself doing a landscape of Detroit, but nobody would probably like 
it for 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Most artists aren't widely known until after their deaths. They should be 
known now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rumeal Robinson, himself a real piece of work, hopes his personal handiwork 
will direct Michigan to the national championship. If successful, perhaps he 
will go out and paint the town. If not, well, you know how these artists love 
to suffer. Maybe he will cut off an ear.

DESPITE MICHIGAN'S SUCCESS, FISHER'S JOB REMAINS IN LIMBO

<P>
A Michigan victory over Seton Hall tonight in the Kingdome would make Steve 
Fisher, the Wolverines' interim coach, the first rookie to guide a team to the 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. men's basketball championship. 
</P>
<P>
But would it remove the interim from his title? 
</P>
<P>
Bo Schembechler won't say. 
</P>
<P>
"He's done a great job, a wonderful job, and we're very pleased," the Michigan 
athletic director told reporters outside the locker room Saturday night after 
the Wolverines' 83-81 semifinal victory over Illinois, "but let's wait until 
Monday night (before) we talk about anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher, 44, was an anonymous assistant until March 15, when his former boss, 
Bill Frieder, announced on the eve of the NCAA tournament that he had accepted 
an offer to coach at Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler replaced Frieder immediately rather than let him coach the 
Wolverines in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan hasn't lost since. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never heard of an undefeated coach getting fired," Michigan forward Terry 
Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
It could happen this week. 
</P>
<P>
Frieder, who watched Saturday night's game on television from his Seattle hotel 
room, said he hadn't decided if he would attend tonight's game. "I don't want 
anything to detract from the players," he said. "I don't want to be besieged by 
the media. But I'd like to go as a fan, a Michigan alumnus and a former coach. 
I have strong feelings. I love them all." 
</P>
<P>
Most coaches favor Seton Hall to end Fisher's ride. 
</P>
<P>
"They've successfully kicked the living . . . out of (Bob) Knight, (Jerry) 
Tarkanian and (Mike) Krzyzewski," UCLA's Jim Harrick said of the Pirates, who 
beat Indiana, Nevada Las Vegas and Duke in their last three games. "I like The 
Hall." 
</P>
<P>
However, Terry Holland of Virgina, whose team lost to Michigan, 102-65, last 
week in the Southeast Regional final, said of the Wolverines: "If they shoot 
well, they can stay with anyone, including some NBA teams." 
</P>
<P>
Michigan has made 56.9% of its shots this season. The NCAA record is 57.2%, 
established by Missouri in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Coach P.J. Carlesimo of Seton Hall said that, in terms of style, Syracuse is 
the only team in the Big East that would compare to Michigan. Would the same 
things work against both teams? 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing worked against Syracuse," Carlesimo said. "We haven't made a dent 
against Syracuse. I think we're oh-for-the-decade." 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall has lost 18 consecutive games to the Orangemen and has beaten them 
only once in 21 meetings since the Big East was formed in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
What's the secret to guarding Michigan's Glen Rice? 
</P>
<P>
Sean Higgins said it's footwork. 
</P>
<P>
"He runs you through screens -- it's like bumper pool," said the Wolverines' 
sixth man, who frequently shadows Rice in practice. "I told him, 'I can't guard 
you.' He said, 'You have to learn to dance through.' 
</P>
<P>
"So, I learned to dance." 
</P>
<P>
Rice, who is averaging 30.6 points a game in the tournament, needs 25 points 
tonight to break the tournament record of 177, which was established in 1965 by 
Bill Bradley of Princeton. 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall was picked to finish seventh in the Big East. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you've got to understand that the intelligence factor of the other 
eight coaches in our league is not terribly high," Carlesimo joked. 
</P>
<P>
He said the depth and balance of the Pirates hurts them in terms of individual 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't understand how talented these people are," Carlesimo said of his 
players. "We have more good players than anybody in the country. That's why 
we're here. Their individual talents are overshadowed a little by the fact that 
they're a pretty good team." 
</P>
<P>
During his team's 95-78 victory over Duke Saturday, Seton Hall center Ramon 
Ramos was mistakenly introduced over the public-address system as Ramon Rivas. 
</P>
<P>
Rivas, who played last season at Temple, is a former boyhood teammate of Ramos, 
who is from Canovanas, Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a good friend -- we know each other very well," Ramos said. "But I like 
to be called by my own name."

FOOTNOTES: LEAD NOT INTO TEMPTATION

It's nearly noon on Saturday, the grocery cart is filled and you're finally in 
line at the checkout counter. The kids -- who have been up since 5:30 a.m. -- 
are ready to snap, and you're bracing for an unpleasant scene when they come 
face to face with their favorite treats. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of chocolate, candy and gum, some are finding crayons, flash cards, 
books and magazines. 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers at a handful of Lucky stores in San Diego and Orange counties have 
recently been given the option of exiting through a sugar-free checkout lane. 
The concept will spread to other stores later this year, according to Brian 
Carter, Lucky vice president. 
</P>
<P>
"We've all witnessed the parents with children in the cart," Carter said. "Now, 
if they choose, the temptation won't be there."

Want to buy stocks for nothing? 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Los Angeles-based brokerage Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards is 
offering a one-day promotion allowing investors to buy, free of commission, any 
of 23 stocks on its recommended list. 
</P>
<P>
The offer is among several marketing efforts by Bateman Eichler under Chief 
Executive Richard J. Capalbo, who went to the firm last year after serving as a 
marketing executive at Drexel Burnham Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
The offer is good only during market hours Thursday and applies only to 
purchases of the 23 stocks, which include Boeing, Walt Disney, Bank of America 
and Pacific Telesis. 
</P>
<P>
Bateman, of course, is offering no guarantees that those stocks will do well. 
And the free commissions apply only to purchases, not sales. "We're 
recommending you invest in these; that's why the offer is only on the buy 
side," Bateman executive Gene Meeker said.

Lashing Out at Torture 
</P>
<P>
Bob Stein has seen the wave of the future, and it's on an eyelash. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble with the common eyelash curler, says the former Hollywood makeup 
man, is that it hurts. It looks, and works, more like a medieval torture device 
than an instrument of beauty. 
</P>
<P>
"After years of suffering with that old steel tool that pinched the eyelids and 
broke eyelashes, I thought there must be another way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stein's answer: "Lady Wink," a white, spring-loaded plastic device that fits in 
the palm of your hand. He says he's sold 3,800 from his Venice business, mostly 
through beauty supply stores and salons, at $15 each. But space-age beauty will 
require an education. Lady Wink is packed with a 16-page instruction booklet.

PROSPECTING FOR CALIFORNIA GOLD;

DELEGATIONS FROM ACROSS U.S. TRY TO CASH IN ON STATE'S RICHES, LURE BUSINESSES 
AWAY

<P>
With their governor leading the charge, 40 officials from Oregon swooped down 
on California last week in a bold raid on the state's economic riches. 
</P>
<P>
The aggressive Oregonians called upon 70 firms in the Golden State and held a 
lavish reception at a downtown Los Angeles hotel -- where guests nibbled on 
Chinook salmon, sipped Oregon wines and watched videotaped testimonials -- in 
an effort to persuade companies to make the move north. 
</P>
<P>
"California is our No. 1 target," said Steve Petersen, deputy director of the 
Oregon Economic Development Department. "This is the first shot in a long-term 
effort." 
</P>
<P>
Oregon has joined the ranks of other states -- Arizona, Texas, Indiana and 
Colorado among them -- that want to boost their economies by taking home some 
of California's. This state's crowded and expensive cities have made it an 
attractive target for other regions that can promise businesses lower costs, 
tax incentives and congestion-free highways. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, many California officials seem more concerned about attracting 
business from the Far East than about losing companies to the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, California has rivaled -- even surpassed, some say -- the New 
York metropolitan area as the nation's most productive hunting ground for other 
cities and states hoping to attract disenchanted corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives from about 20 states, cities and utilities crisscross 
California during any given month, according to corporate relocation experts. 
In fact, while the Oregonians were in Los Angeles last week, a competing 
contingent from the Reno area was also passing through town. 
</P>
<P>
California corporate expatriates have accounted for up to 35% of the annual 
business start-ups in Nevada. "We get fat from the crumbs off your table and 
you don't even know it," said Andy Grose, executive director of Nevada's 
economic development commission. 
</P>
<P>
Many argue that California is big and strong enough -- the Los Angeles area 
alone created nearly 165,000 jobs last year -- to survive economic assaults 
from other states. "Look at the job growth we are having," said Bob Arnold, 
chairman of the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy. 
"It's just phenomenal. You will always see some spillover when you're this 
big." 
</P>
<P>
And that's just what many other states figure. "A lot of these states are 
getting hungry," said David Kolzow, an Orange County economic development 
consultant to cities. "And California has just continued to be a shining star 
in terms of economic growth." 
</P>
<P>
In high-profile delegations or two-member teams, officials from other states 
shop in California for specific companies. Houston wants to rebuild its economy 
-- badly weakened by low oil prices and a troubled real estate market -- with 
firms that would like to feed off its petrochemical industry and the nearby 
Johnson Space Center. Indiana wants high-tech firms to offset its reliance on 
heavy industry. Oregon's utilities are partial to big users of electrical 
power. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, one official joked, "We'll take any of your fine companies." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the raiders offer incentives that California cannot match -- like 
forgiving taxes -- and will help find and train new employees, including top 
executives. They will videotape neighborhoods and industrial sites to help 
prospects make up their minds to move as well as try to match them to cities 
fitting their land and labor needs. 
</P>
<P>
Growing firms are prime targets for job-hungry states. Other states are more 
likely to pick the fruits of corporate expansion -- new factories and 
distribution centers, for example -- than to lure away entire corporations. 
</P>
<P>
"We're finding a lot of small companies that are interested in talking to us 
because of the quality of life," said George H. Gault, an official in 
Colorado's economic development office. "They are tired of too many people, too 
much pollution." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looking Outside State 
</P>
<P>
It also helps when you are in a part of the country that is attractive to top 
managers. "If the owner likes to fish and hunt in the mountains, that's where 
the company goes," said Darrell Plummer, economic development representative 
for Sierra Pacific Resources, a Nevada utility holding company. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes a major high-profile company does jump the state line. Motel 6 moved 
its headquarters, for example, from the beaches of Santa Barbara to the 
flatlands of Dallas, where the company says it is easier to keep tabs on the 
nationwide chain. 
</P>
<P>
The many problems spawned by California's success -- high operating costs, 
slow-growth regulations, pollution controls and traffic congestion -- make it 
easier to attract firms, say the economic development officials of other 
states. A recent study by Location Management Services, a Palo Alto firm that 
helps companies locate new homes, found that of Southern California firms 
planning to move or to build new plants outside the region, about 70% said they 
were looking at sites outside the state. 
</P>
<P>
"It became clear that we would have a greater rate of success in California 
than we would have in the Northeast," said R. Wayne Snead, marketing director 
for a Houston economic development group, who found at least three California 
firms willing to relocate while on a recent prospecting tour. 
</P>
<P>
California companies also seem more receptive to the idea of moving than do 
firms in other high-cost parts of the nation, like Massachussetts. "They've got 
such a Stone Age mentality there," said Fred S. Lindsey, an official with the 
Indiana Department of Commerce who recently completed a two-week hunt for 
California high-tech firms. "They think anything west of Pennsylvania is still 
wild. They will tolerate the high cost of everything." 
</P>
<P>
But there is resistance. "Some of the Californians don't care what it is they 
are doing as long as they are doing it in California," Snead said. Houston has 
"a lot to offer, a lot of diversity. But we don't have the mountains with 
snow." 
</P>
<P>
And local California officials have been known to give a frosty reception to 
these economic prospectors. "I'm sure they are not too happy about us coming 
into their areas," said Oregon's Petersen. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, California offered little in the way of an organized 
counterattack to keep firms from moving or expanding across the state line. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the economic development programs are really not geared much to 
retaining business," said Kolzow, who himself is moving from Orange County to 
Dallas. And the public's attitude, he says, is often: "Who cares if they move 
out? They just cause congestion and pollution." 
</P>
<P>
California officials concede that they have their work cut out for them. "It's 
worrisome if I find that sometimes they (California firms) know more about what 
Arizona has to offer than what California has to offer," said Janet Turner, 
director of business development for the State Department of Commerce. "We're 
trying to make sure California firms know what opportunities exist within 
California." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Great Potential' 
</P>
<P>
The state has identified several industries that it wants to retain and are 
vulnerable to moving, including companies in aerospace, furniture making, 
apparel and plastics. Through industry associations, surveys and meetings, the 
state tries to find out who might leave and offer solutions and alternatives to 
unhappy corporations. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the department was tipped off that Los Angeles apparel maker Evy 
of California was ready to sign a lease for a new plant near Salt Lake City. 
Turner said the state recommended that Evy contact officials in several 
low-cost California towns. As a result, Evy opened a plant in Bakersfield in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
"Utah was excellent," said Evy President Kurt Krieser. "They were willing to do 
a lot, and there was a lot of building space." But after looking at 
Bakersfield, Krieser found that the city offered many of the low-cost benefits 
that Utah did and was several hundred miles closer to company headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"The agency showed us that there is great potential here," Krieser said. 
</P>
<P>
California has also won praise for its advertising campaign -- Discover the 
Californias -- that has helped raise awareness among business people 
nationwide. State officials also make annual corporate recruiting trips to New 
York and the Boston area and will soon begin making treks to Chicago, Turner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, many California officials are not so inclined. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, for example, has arranged trips to 
Kuala Lumpur and Britain to drum up investment here, but has all but ignored 
other parts of the United States. "We haven't concentrated in that area quite 
frankly," chamber President Ray Remy said. "We are interested in the 
international markets." 
</P>
<P>
And many argue that California -- rich and congested enough already -- should 
not trouble itself to go after new business. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're going five miles an hour on the San Diego Freeway," said Indiana's 
Lindsey, "who needs to go out and advertise?"

Brokerage Search Ruled Legal: A federal judge has ruled a four-day search of 
Blinder, Robinson &amp; Co.'s headquarters was legal and that federal 
prosecutors may keep the thousands of documents they seized. U.S. District 
Judge Zita L. Weinshienk denied a motion by attorneys for Blinder, who sought 
to have the documents returned to the investment firm. She said Blinder 
Robinson's attorneys failed to prove that a November search of the firm's 
Englewood, Colo., offices by 26 federal agents was unnecessary. Agents from the 
Internal Revenue Service and Securities and Exchange Commission converged on 
the headquarters Nov. 19 as part of a Las Vegas-based investigation into 
international stock fraud and money laundering.

COURT DISALLOWS FCC'S MINORITY PREFERENCE RULES

A federal appeals court has ruled as unconstitutional federal rules that give 
minorities preference in the purchase of "distressed" radio and television 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, in a 2-1 
vote Friday, said the Federal Communications Commission's "distress sale" 
rules, which allow quick sales at reduced rates of defunct or disenfranchised 
stations to minorities, violate the equal protection provisions of the Fifth 
Amendment to the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
The court remanded to the FCC a 1984 commission decision that denied Alan 
Shurberg and Shurberg Broadcasting a chance to compete for the purchase of 
WHCT-TV in Hartford, Conn., from the station's owner, Faith Center. 
</P>
<P>
The FCC had based its decision on its 1978 policy that allows licenses for 
bankrupt or disabled stations to be transferred to entities that have a 
significant minority ownership interest. Such transfers are made without FCC 
consideration of competing applications. 
</P>
<P>
But the appeals court said the FCC policy did not meet previous Supreme Court 
tests of minority set-aside programs, including one that preferences be given 
to minorities only after race-neutral efforts to increase minority ownership 
had failed. 
</P>
<P>
"The distress sale policy is not narrowly tailored to remedy past 
discrimination," Judge Laurence H. Silberman said in the majority opinion, 
"because its effect is unrelated to the need for such a remedy, and it provides 
no procedures for ensuring that the policy's beneficiaries have actually 
suffered from the effects of past discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dissenting Opinion 
</P>
<P>
"There is no indication, moreover, that the FCC sought to employ race-neutral 
programs to aid minorities before resorting to a racial set-aside," the court 
said, adding that the FCC policy also "imposes a heavy burden on innocent 
minorities by completely depriving them of opportunities to compete for unique 
television outlets." 
</P>
<P>
The FCC itself, in a 1987 case involving its "comparative preference" policy of 
giving special treatment to women seeking FM station licenses, had questioned 
the validity of that policy and had asked the court to remand the issue to the 
FCC for further study. 
</P>
<P>
Before the FCC could act to change its policy, Congress in December, 1987, 
passed, and then-President Reagan signed, an appropriations measure that 
prohibited the use of funds to study or change the distress sale policy. 
</P>
<P>
In a 43-page dissenting opinion to Friday's ruling, Chief Judge Patricia M. 
Wald said the distress sale policy legally worked to ensure diversity in 
programming and ownership.

Some Mortgage Rates Dip: Fixed-rate home mortgages are averaging 11.19%, 
according to a national survey released by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 
That was down from a rate of 11.22% last week. On one-year adjustable rate 
mortgages, lenders were asking an average initial rate of 9.31% this week, up 
from 9.3% the week before, Freddie Mac said.

Hunt Settles Lawsuits: Multimillionaire Lamar Hunt and other defendants have 
agreed to settle two lawsuits, one of them a class action, stemming from the 
alleged attempt by Hunt and his brothers to corner the silver market in 1979 
and 1980, Hunt's attorney reported. Hunt and other defendants, which include 
the giant investment firm Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., agreed to create a 
$58-million settlement pool to compensate members of the class, said attorney 
James T. Seigfreid. Hunt, owner of the Kansas City Chiefs professional football 
team, would contribute 4.7% of the settlement pool up to a maximum of $2.75 
million, Seigfreid said. Hunt, his brothers Nelson Bunker and William Herbert, 
and a number of other defendants were named in the suits filed in 1982 and 1984 
by people who claimed that they lost money in futures trading because of the 
alleged attempt to corner the silver market.

SMITHKLINE, BEECHAM CONFIRM MERGER TALKS 
</P>

SmithKline Beckman Corp. and Beecham PLC confirmed Sunday that the companies 
are discussing a merger of most of their operations that could create one of 
the world's largest pharmaceutical firms, but officials refused to give 
details. 
</P>
<P>
In a news release from the Philadelphia-based SmithKline, the companies said no 
agreement has been finalized and cautioned that there was no assurance any 
agreement would be reached. 
</P>
<P>
However, a Beecham official in London who asked not to be identified said the 
news release was a sign the companies "appear to have common ground." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the price of SmithKline stock jumped $5.25 after Beecham confirmed 
that it had hired the U.S. merger specialist Wasserstein, Perella &amp; Co. as 
a financial adviser. 
</P>
<P>
A report last week said Beecham, the British pharmaceutical and consumer 
products company, had held merger talks with SmithKline, a pharmaceutical and 
medical products company. The talks reportedly soured over questions about who 
would control the new firm. 
</P>
<P>
The companies said in the Sunday release that the entity created by a merger 
"would be governed by a board of directors drawn equally from both companies 
and with management selected from both companies." The release also said "major 
parts" of both businesses might be merged. 
</P>
<P>
Under such a merger, current SmithKline and Beecham shareholders would own the 
new entity equally, the news release said. 
</P>
<P>
The Beecham official said the companies have three common medicine divisions: 
prescription, over the counter and animal health. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are the parts that lend themselves to merger," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The official said he did not know how long the discussions had been going on, 
but "you can assume it's been for some time." 
</P>
<P>
An industry analyst said the tone of the announcement indicates that the 
companies are close to an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"I would judge from the tenor of the press release that they're in the advanced 
stages of the negotiations," said Richard Stover, an analyst with Alex Brown 
&amp; Sons in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The companies may have decided to confirm the merger talks were going on 
because "the rumors were just too intense," Stover said. 
</P>
<P>
Beecham's U.S. operations are based in Pittsburgh. Its products include 
Aqua-Fresh toothpaste, Sucrets lozenges, Geritol vitamins and Williams Lectric 
Shave lotion. 
</P>
<P>
SmithKline's major prescription drugs are Tagamet, an ulcer medication, and 
Dyazide, used to treat high blood pressure.

Bhopal Settlement Set Aside: India's supreme court set aside a $470-million 
settlement to victims of the Bhopal gas-leak disaster until it determines the 
validity of a law making the government the sole representative of all victims. 
But a spokesman for Union Carbide, which owned the plant where 3,400 people 
were killed in 1984, said Friday's action was not official. Justice Sabyasachi 
Mukherjee said the settlement "stands stayed for all practical purposes." 
Mukherjee presides over the five-judge panel hearing petitions challenging the 
constitutionality of a 1985 law that made the federal government the 
representative of all victims of the disaster.

GRAVE ADVICE SHAKING UP CITY OF ROSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mild tremors rocked Pasadena with the arrival of the current issue of the 
city's official newsletter, which offers suggestions on how to keep the genteel 
city smelling like roses after the Big One hits. 
</P>
<P>
Among the helpful earthquake hints residents received: Wrap human corpses in 
clean sheets and store in a cool place; and "bury human waste in trenches at 
least 2 feet deep and cover with a thin layer of lime. Use this same procedure 
in disposing of dead animals, increasing the depth to 3 to 4 feet (use only if 
service provided by veterinarians and the Humane Society is not available)." 
</P>
<P>
The information, derived in part from a booklet created by Libbey Lafferty of 
La Canada Flintridge, is based on the assumption that the city will have 
difficulty providing basic services -- including waste disposal -- for at least 
72 hours after a major quake, said Carol Brown Spencer, the city's public 
information officer. 
</P>
<P>
Jack and Jerry Siegal, who have owned and operated Jay's Antiques in Pasadena 
since 1947, were among the 53,000 households to receive the newsletter with 
their city utility bills. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It Scared Me a Lot' 
</P>
<P>
The October, 1987, Whittier quake knocked antiques off shelves in their store, 
which they're now preparing to have "earthquake-proofed." Since then, "I go to 
sleep every night hoping I'll be awake the next morning," Jerry Siegal said. 
</P>
<P>
Then the city newsletter arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"It scared me a lot," Jerry said. ". . . I put it down. I sort of felt funny 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
While they had taken the standard procedures -- storing canned goods and water 
-- neither had thought about such matters as disposing of sewage and bodies, 
they said. But both agreed that such concerns need to be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
Shaking people out of undue earthquake assurance was part of the plan, said 
Spencer, who compiled the four-page flyer. 
</P>
<P>
Other cities have used their official newsletters to educate residents about 
earthquake preparedness, but "I'm not sure that anyone has been as frank as 
I've been here," she said. ". . . By talking about things like sanitation and 
possible death, we get them to focus on the issue. I don't think it's going to 
be enough with the big quake just to have the flashlight by the bed." 
</P>
<P>
So, in addition to food and other emergency items, the newsletter suggests 
residents keep: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "A portable camp toilet, sturdy bucket or small trash can with 
tight-fitting lid to use as an emergency toilet -- with a good supply of 
plastic bag liners, twist ties, toilet paper and disinfectant. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Powdered chlorinated lime, household disinfectant, deodorant and 
insecticides -- may be added to the sewage. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ziplock plastic bags to meet short-term sanitary needs in the car or at 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Large plastic trash bags to use as sanitary receptacles for the smaller 
bags. Keep in large covered metal trash cans until disposal service is 
resumed." 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, people in Pasadena seem to think the information is a good 
idea. Anyone who has lived in the area any length of time has been rocked by at 
least small quakes. Many said they have had art objects topple and walls crack, 
but few knew anyone who has died in a quake, and none had experienced any of 
the real hardships recent quakes have inflicted on other parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
But at the Rose City Diner in Old Town Pasadena, for instance, the only 
memories some employees have of the October, 1987, quake is that it shook loose 
some of the thousands of cellophane-topped toothpicks and miniature parasols 
stuck into the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
Hostess Amy Hochstein, 25, giggled when she read the newsletter's advice on 
body disposal. "I don't know if I'll go and keep body bags in the pantry," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But, she added, such information isn't "gross or anything. It's necessary."

HOLLYWOOD GOES POETIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH ANN KRIER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Justine Bateman, star of "Family Ties" and the fast-track party circuit, wasn't 
dancing at Helena's. 
</P>
<P>
She was reading poetry. 
</P>
<P>
Smiling serenely, she recited "Ice," a romantic, confessional poem about a 
platinum blonde who abandons her fiance at a party where "guests could already 
hear her packing." 
</P>
<P>
On another night, actor Robert Downey Jr. cracked up an attentive industry 
crowd with his raunchy satire/erotic fantasy on an alternative scenario for 
"Gorillas in the Mist." 
</P>
<P>
And recently, Katey Sagal, "Married . . . With Children's" Spandex queen and 
mom, instructed her listeners that "we can never be all things to all people, 
but we can be all things to ourselves. Just for the fun of it." 
</P>
<P>
It's poetry, Hollywood style. And since last October, it's been served up 
weekly at Helena's, the West Temple Street private supper club known for its 
elite, New Hollywood clientele. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Celebrities Do Readings 
</P>
<P>
Here under the fuchsia lights each Wednesday night, entertainers such as Judd 
Nelson, Ed Begley Jr., Michael Des Barres, Harry Dean Stanton, Carl Reiner, 
Michael J. Pollard, Michael O'Keefe , Patti D'Arbanville and others have read 
their own work or that of established poets. 
</P>
<P>
Their performances have been so well received that other actors have agreed to 
read as well -- Melanie Griffith, Don Johnson, Charlie Sheen, Ally Sheedy, 
Rebecca De Mornay, Alfre Woodard, Rutger Hauer, Howard Hesseman and David 
Carradine among them. 
</P>
<P>
As poetry record producer Harvey Kubernik describes the weekly phenomenon, "New 
York had the beat poets. L.A. has the SAG (Screen Actors Guild) poets." 
</P>
<P>
What's more, serious literary figures have occasionally come by to share the 
upscale spotlight and listen at tables graced with Dendrobium orchids. 
</P>
<P>
Says Hubert Selby Jr., author of "Last Exit to Brooklyn" who's read several 
times at Helena's: "The thing is, everybody has a lot of fun. Most of the time, 
poetry readings are in less than hospitable surroundings. This makes it 
available to people rather than keeping it in some academic classroom." 
</P>
<P>
And L.A. poet Wanda Coleman, a medical transcriber who's won an Emmy for 
soap-opera writing and a Guggenheim fellowship for her poetry, recently gave 
such an intensely moving reading of her work that a producer in the audience 
later called to offer her an acting job. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, the presenters are called the Temple Street Poets because of the 
location. But they will temporarily become Poetry in Motion when Helena's 
closes for the month of April. The readings will continue on Tuesday nights at 
the Heartbreak Cafe on La Brea Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
(Former actress and dancer Helena Kallianiotes, who opened her club to the 
public and lowered food prices for the weekly readings, hasn't decided what 
she's going to do with her business in the interim. "They (city officials) want 
me to rebuild it and put in paraplegic bathrooms," she says. "Or I could go 
back to a lower capacity.") 
</P>
<P>
While club insiders say that the Helena's traffic on other nights has not been 
particularly stellar of late (with the star heat moving to the recently opened 
club, b.c.), the poetry readings have been standing room only. 
</P>
<P>
Audiences typically hear about 10 poets -- roughly a 50-50 mix between actors 
and non-actors -- performing for about seven minutes each. As Kubernik puts it, 
"Some of the stuff's like radiation. You get five- to 10-minute jolts." 
</P>
<P>
According to observers of the L.A. poetry scene, the weekly experiment at 
Helena's is unprecedented. Though a theme usually is assigned to each evening's 
presentations ("Ecstasy" and "All Dressed Up With No Place to Go" were explored 
recently), an abundant mix of styles and subjects has been addressed by the 
readers. And typically, plenty of uncensored verse on the unglamorous side of 
show business. 
</P>
<P>
"You get your share of the 'I've blown my audition' poems," says actor Michael 
O'Keefe, who recently read a freshly written commentary on "actresses as female 
impersonators," a poem he felt sure would insult the actresses in the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
O'Keefe had never performed the poem before, but it was received with wild 
applause and all-too-knowing laughter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Testing New Material 
</P>
<P>
Though some of the more established poets say they'd never risk reading a new, 
untested work before such a hip, demanding crowd, many of the actor/poets first 
expose their poetry to the public at Helena's. 
</P>
<P>
Katey Sagal, for instance, has long been a songwriter but only lately began 
writing and performing her poetry at the club. She claims she's not ready to 
have one of her poems published in a newspaper, but didn't mind performing them 
before her peers. "It's a risky thing to do," she acknowledges. "But 
everybody's such a ham, once you start, you get the bug." 
</P>
<P>
It's a new experience for many in the audience, too. 
</P>
<P>
"For a lot of people here, this is their first exposure to serious poetry -- 
they're finding it can be entertaining. It can make you laugh or cry. Some of 
the people in this room are making six figures a year, performing or directing 
or producing," says Kubernik, a long-time participant in L.A.'s poetry scene. 
</P>
<P>
"And they're hearing people who grew up in South Central L.A., like Wanda 
Coleman, who's been a welfare mother and still has to work a day job. . . . You 
see glimpses of light here you didn't know existed. I felt the room lift a 
bunch of times. And none of the stuff was moon/June poetry." 
</P>
<P>
Few poems are greeted with silence, demure applause or contemplative "hmmmmms." 
The folks here are demonstrative whether they're pleased (whistling, barking 
and clapping) or not (booing, hissing and shouting). 
</P>
<P>
Observes poet/actor Michael Lally, who organizes the weekly events with 
poet/producer Eve Brandstein: "The amazing thing is that a room full of mostly 
cynical Hollywood people spontaneously cries or bursts into applause or 
sometimes boos." 
</P>
<P>
One poet, whose work resembled a letter to Penthouse's Forum sprinkled with 
bits of animal torture, was not only booed but pelted with cries of "No, no, 
no" and "Sit down." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he left the stage, muttering, "I guess people are still eating." 
</P>
<P>
How good is the other stuff? 
</P>
<P>
Wanda Coleman declines to characterize the quality of the actors' poems, but 
she applauds their performances. "When they're actors, they deliver," she 
enthuses. "They really deliver, baby." 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the poets who read (a recent night) were not that strong," says Austin 
Straus, a respected L.A. poet who teaches poetry at UCLA Extension and, with 
Coleman, hosts "The Poetry Connexion" on KPFK-FM. "Writing poetry is part of 
finding yourself. The actors are trying to go through that process. I'm not 
going to criticize them for it. I like to see anybody making the effort." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, don't expect the actors who read at Helena's to forsake the 
celluloid trenches for the poetic life anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
Says O'Keefe, who's appeared in "Ironweed" and "Caddyshack": "My identity will 
always be as an actor, but it's nice to have something else. I like being 
perceived as a poet because most actors are perceived as having the IQ's of 
their bowling scores -- not very good bowling scores, I might add." 
</P>
<P>
A New Yorker, he reports that there is nothing in Manhattan that even 
approximates what happens at Helena's: "There's the poetry scene in New York, 
but it's not plugged into the acting scene." 
</P>
<P>
According to co-organizer Lally, who has published 20 books of poetry and acted 
on shows such as "L.A. Law," some poets were initially suspicious of reading at 
a private night club. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of poet friends of mine came and said, 'What is this (expletive)? 
Linen tablecloths!' " Lally recalls. "I said, 'Shut up. Who's to say we can't 
read in comfortable places where people spend a little money for dinner.' " 
</P>
<P>
Others have scoffed at the notion of the glitterati tackling the work of great 
poets, mocking, "Right. Sure. To be or not to be. That is the question, babe." 
</P>
<P>
Even co-organizer Brandstein had doubts about the project initially. 
</P>
<P>
"I was reluctant at first to do poetry with the slant we have: the Hollywood 
poet. My fear was it would get too trendy, too hip and not be about poetry, 
something I value in a spiritual way," says Brandstein, a producer and director 
who worked for 10 years as Norman Lear's vice president for talent development 
and casting. 
</P>
<P>
"But this is a culture, the Hollywood culture. And poets are the guardians of 
the culture. . . . I've had people tell me they go home and write after they 
leave here. There have been some really fine poems read here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Larger Audience 
</P>
<P>
And they reach ears that might not ever find themselves at a traditional poetry 
reading, points out Los Angeles poet Jack Grapes. 
</P>
<P>
In his view, Kallianiotes, Brandstein and Lally are "getting poetry out of the 
cloistered halls of academia and the pseudo-intellectual coffeehouse scene" and 
"bringing poetry to a larger audience." 
</P>
<P>
"The L.A. poetry scene is one of the best-kept secrets in the country," adds 
Grapes, who's considered one of L.A.'s leading poets and has acted on shows 
such as "Hill Street Blues" and "MASH." 
</P>
<P>
"If poetry is vital and good, as it is in this city, it will survive anything," 
he insists. ". . . So we get a different audience here. . . . At least the 
people here can afford to buy the poets' books. We should be doing our poetry 
at Chasen's and Ma Maison." 
</P>
<P>
A Cigarette's Life By Justine Bateman 
</P>
<P>
The flame compels it 
</P>
<P>
To turn a fiery red. 
</P>
<P>
Hypnotic, swirling smoke 
</P>
<P>
Is emitted from its head. 
</P>
<P>
With each hit, ignition 
</P>
<P>
More burning of the friend. 
</P>
<P>
The waste sect grows, and 
</P>
<P>
Finally descends. 
</P>
<P>
Devoured by the air, 
</P>

It's smothered by force

<P>
Ending its trite ballet.

STUCK WITH PERPLEXING ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS? CALL ECOLOGICAL DESIGNER JIM BELL 
FOR HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONNIE KOENENN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was almost 15 years ago while he was building custom houses that Jim Bell 
began to be converted. 
</P>
<P>
"I think all my life I've tried to see below the surface of things," he says. 
"The houses I was building looked nice, but they were energy hogs and they used 
too much water. I was becoming more aware of where the raw materials were 
coming from and what kind of ecological assaults were taking place. Even a 
material as simple as plywood was unhealthy, because of the glues. 
</P>
<P>
"I just got tired of building things that were stupid." 
</P>
<P>
So Bell -- who had played varsity basketball at Cal State Long Beach, received 
a degree in environmental design from San Diego State and become a journeyman 
carpenter -- changed his life. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to make a living in a way I could feel morally good about and a way 
that would potentially make the world better," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Bell, 47, today is a self-described "ecological designer" with an environmental 
focus that emphasizes problem-solving. 
</P>
<P>
He looks at house plans and asks questions like: Why is all the shower water 
going into the sewage system? Where can the rain runoff be collected and 
stored? How can solar heating be used? Where's the recycling system for table 
scraps? How can the landscape system produce edible food? 
</P>
<P>
These are uncommon considerations for builders or buyers in today's housing 
market. But Bell maintains it's only a matter of time before priorities start 
shifting. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the things we are doing are destroying the ecology, and at some point 
we have to pay the piper," he says. "It's better for the economy to do things 
ecologically right than to do things wrong and try to clean up afterward. We 
have a lot of ways to solve environmental problems right now and I want all 
developers to be considering them and using them." 
</P>
<P>
His concern is not limited to houses. "What I really want to do is redesign 
cities," he says, in his calm, no-nonsense manner. "We need to move away from 
ecologically damaging systems to sustainable systems in all aspects of our 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
He argues that this is possible, particularly in California, which he sees as a 
global leader in trying new ideas: "If just one California city would make a 
change over to ecologically sustainable systems, it would have a major impact." 
</P>
<P>
Bell's mission is to nudge that process along. "He's been ahead of his time for 
years," says longtime acquaintance Dave Burnight, director of San Diego State's 
campus ministry house. "Jim isn't flashy or charismatic. He doesn't look like 
any kind of prophet, but he gets things done. We contracted with him for 
consultant work for a new center because we want it to be a demonstration in 
itself of what we believe in: energy efficiency, solar usage and a place that 
invites community." 
</P>
<P>
Bell is not only a consultant. With a background of environmental research, he 
has become a builder, planner, publisher, teacher and speaker, and, working 
with private groups and public agencies, has designed everything from solar 
systems to edible landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
His projects are big and small. He won a Water Conservation Award from the City 
of San Diego for a 21-unit apartment project using flow-restricters on shower 
heads and faucets and one-gallon flush toilets, as well as drought-resistant 
landscaping. He is now working on a large-scale experimental system that 
recycles water for irrigation and nutrients for fertilizer in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Back-Yard Solar Oven 
</P>
<P>
For friends Mike and Pat McCoy of Imperial Beach, he built a back-yard solar 
oven. "Jim does a lot of practical things like that for his friends," Pat McCoy 
says. "He's been in the vanguard of planning solutions to some of these 
problems we are just starting to worry about. He made us see a long time ago 
that you can't keep throwing pollutants into the air and let landfills 
overflow." 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, Bell founded the Ecological Life Systems Institute, a nonprofit group 
that he runs on a $10,000 budget from a converted garage office at his home 
near Balboa Park. He pays himself "as little as possible" and relies heavily on 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to take Jim seriously," says Mary Clark, biology professor at San 
Diego State University, where Bell is guest lecturer in a Global Future course. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a lot of sound ideas and documentation about how San Diego could live 
within its own environmental income in a sustainable way. Some of the things 
might not work 100% but would certainly be a grand improvement on what we are 
now doing, so they are worth hearing and demonstrating. And he has done all 
this virtually on his own, without any big grants." 
</P>
<P>
Bell, a towering redhead who has maintained the trimness of his time in 
collegiate athletics, seems to be in a dozen places at once. He spends several 
days a week at the Ocean Beach Peoples' Food Cooperative, specializing in 
organically grown produce. 
</P>
<P>
The cooperative, of which he is board president, is an example of a trend whose 
time has come, he says, noting the recent public frenzy over pesticides: "It 
doesn't require any great leap of intellectual power to realize many of these 
ideas are common sense." 
</P>
<P>
He senses there are networks of entrepreneurs poised on the periphery of 
today's market, ready to introduce biodegradable plastics, nontoxic paints and 
glues, whole lines of organically grown produce and dozens of other nontoxic 
items. 
</P>
<P>
"I get all kinds of different catalogues with new products," he says. "It's 
just a matter of getting the free-enterprise system to work with us. I think 
people have been ready to listen for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego businessman Rick Cabados sought an environmental-minded consultant to 
design a mountain retreat and discovered Bell by word of mouth: "We wanted an 
ecologically planned community, an ashram, something that would be a model, and 
I just sort of sent the message out around town that I needed a consultant. All 
kinds of different people mentioned Jim Bell, and he has worked with us from 
the start. I knew what I wanted, but just needed the guidance and resource 
information and Jim was very helpful." 
</P>
<P>
Cabados' stucco-and-stone complex will have 6-inch walls, dual-glazed glass and 
solar heating. "We drilled our own well and have a generating system using 
propane, so it is clean," he says. "Jim sat down with the contractors and 
worked it all out -- he has done construction, so he could help with that end 
too. He is totally dedicated. He may be making a living at it now but this is 
out of love." 
</P>
<P>
Bell, who has lived in everything from a tent to a glorified camper (his 
current house is a conventional frame model), doesn't think he is making any 
sacrifices. 
</P>
<P>
"I get up every morning and do something I like to do," he says. "I want to 
live life from a real perspective. Some people would say I am unselfish, but I 
think I am selfish. I get tremendous public support." 
</P>
<P>
Another friend notes of him "that he is not a gloom-and-doom prophet," a 
personal assessment with which Bell agrees. He accentuates the positive. "My 
message," he says, "is that we have an infinity of opportunities, so many ways 
to solve these problems." 
</P>
<P>
He tries to spread his message by giving about 60 lectures a year, showing 
audiences how urban regions can be designed to provide for human wants and 
needs in ecologically sustainable ways. His audiences this month alone range 
from the Bonita Organic Garden Club to the group Beyond War. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, he brought his slide show to Los Angeles to the Cooperative 
Resources and Services Project, whose members also are involved in designing 
co-housing and shared housing projects. He was invited, said project director 
Lois Arkin, because he's "one of only a handful of people in the country 
incorporating practical ecological design into all aspects of the built 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
Bell is undaunted by the scope of his undertaking. "It is all very practical," 
he says. "The unique thing I do is focus on solutions to ecological problems. I 
show how an urban region can be redesigned to do everything it does now: 
provide employment; provide transportation (and) recreation opportunities; 
ensure plenty of energy, water and a secure food supply; but to accomplish all 
those things in ways that work with the natural system of our planet. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything I talk about is based on known technology," he adds. "I show people 
that the problem is not a lack of technology but a lack of consciousness -- a 
matter of not knowing what we have available." 
</P>
<P>
An obvious priority is for more efficient energy use. He shows audience slides 
of available technologies -- Japanese vans getting 80 miles per gallon, a 
Canadian housing project where foot-thick insulation reduces heating bills to a 
minimum, a refrigerator with the motor and compressor on top instead of 
underneath, cutting its energy use by almost 80%. 
</P>
<P>
A typical packet of material from his Ecological Life Systems includes: 
articles on biodegradable products now available; an extensive reading list on 
organic gardening; a proposal for the San Diego region's future water supply; 
and a draft of his plan for a Peace Ecology University where technologies would 
be demonstrated, nontoxic products would be sold and environmental groups 
nationwide could coordinate their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't think that is overly ambitious, and, despite his one-man office, he 
doesn't feel lonely. "I'm on the board of directors of five different 
organizations, all working one way or another toward the same thing. We are 
just building for the future. 
</P>
<P>
"My dream is that someone like me will be hired by Los Angeles or San Diego to

'SING' STARS IN TUNE AT PREMIERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It can be rough being young and popular in Hollywood. The night after the 61st 
Academy Awards presentation, there was Carrie Hamilton, a performer in the 
up-and-comers production number, out on the town again. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm exhausted," she said at the premiere of the movie "Sing." 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody from last night still has their makeup on -- you go to sleep propped 
up," the actress, dressed in shredded jeans, joked. "But I thought, 'I'm so 
tired, I wonder if anyone else is going to show up.' " 
</P>
<P>
Although it may have seemed like overkill to schedule a premiere the night 
after the movie industry's biggest bash of the year, plenty of people did show 
up, including Barbra Streisand, Quincy Jones and Brian De Palma, as well as a 
gaggle of the town's hippest young agents, managers and executives. 
</P>
<P>
They went Thursday to see the musical about a talent competition set in a 
Brooklyn high school from the same team -- producer Craig Zadan and 
screenwriter-lyricist Dean Pitchford -- who made the hit movie "Footloose." 
</P>
<P>
They then motored to b.c., the new nightclub, for food, drink and dancing in 
clusters. In Streisand's case, she was there showing her support for -- as they 
say in Hollywood -- her "very good friend" Richard Baskin, "Sing's" neophyte 
director. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just sort of calming down," said actor Christian Slater, who had appeared 
in the same production number as Hamilton and who stars in "Heathers," another 
new movie geared at young film-goers. 
</P>
<P>
Trekking into the Cinerama Dome, Slater seemed happy enough to trade in 
Wednesday night's limousine and tuxedo for jeans, a flannel Armstrong Sporting 
Goods jacket and his '88 Saab. Except for what he said seemed like a three-hour 
wait for his limo after the Governors Ball, he rated his first Oscar appearance 
"a blast," though he was deriding himself for not summoning the nerve to 
introduce himself backstage to his actor-hero Jack Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
"I choked and completely chickened out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Canadian actress Jessica Steen, a "Sing" star, was getting her first taste of 
Oscar fever. "I've never been in Hollywood for the Oscars before," she 
explained. "It's like a national holiday. Businesses come to a screeching halt, 
people arrive late to work the next day and it's been the sole topic of 
conversation at auditions today." 
</P>
<P>
It was at b.c., too. Eric Roberts had to remind someone that he had been a 
nominee for his performance in "Runaway Train." 
</P>
<P>
"They only remember the winners," he said philosophically, adding: "There is no 
winner. There's a chosen spokesman who gets to take home a trophy." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Vilanch -- the bearlike writer of the awards telecast script who spent 
the day writing yet another show, Saturday night's Cinematheque tribute to 
Steven Spielberg -- observed of the busy industry scene, which included 
publicist Irving "Swifty" Lazar's traditional bash: "We closed Swifty's at like 
3 a.m. I guess no good deed goes unpunished. When I called Allan (Oscar 
producer Carr), he was still asleep at noon." 
</P>
<P>
At the "Sing" party, Streisand sequestered herself in an area upstairs 
overlooking the dance floor. "She cried and gave me a big hug," Baskin said, 
relating her review of the movie. 
</P>
<P>
Downstairs, fielding waiters' passing trays of seared tuna and chicken 
brochettes, were Jennifer Grant, daughter of the late Cary Grant; Hollywood 
teen heartthrob Leif Garrett; actresses Lesley Ann Warren and Khrystyne Haje 
and actor Harvey Keitel and his wife, "Sing" star Lorraine Bracco. The buzz 
words on the movie: "Very important sound track." 
</P>
<P>
"I plan to do many more musicals," related producer Zadan. "It's a tradition 
that sort of died out in Hollywood and we're trying to resurrect it." 
</P>
<P>
Added writer Pitchford: "What's so interesting, is that when people think of 
Hollywood, they think musicals. They're the embodiment of the Hollywood 
fantasy." 
</P>
<P>
One of "Sing's" musical stars, the Betty-Boopish Rachel Sweet was just soaking 
it all in. "This whole week is very glamorous," she cooed. "It's definitely the 
coolest. I could get used to it."

PEOPLE: ARTIST AND HER USED PROM GOWNS FLY IN THE FACE OF CONVENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Alexandria Allan tells everyone that Gypsies dumped her in her parents' cradle. 
"You see, I don't think my parents understand me," she joked. "Or my neighbors. 
Or anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
That seems right, especially when she parades around in the used prom gowns she 
buys in thrift shops and cleverly dramatizes the formal dresses by attaching 
rubber bugs to them. 
</P>
<P>
"Clothes are an extension of myself," she said in an interview at her 
Huntington Beach home studio, where she creates what she calls her "terrible 
wearable" clothes and paints expressionistic and surrealistic art. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you like this?" Allan asked, twirling and showing off the secondhand prom 
gown she bought for $30. It has rubber tsetse flies strategically placed on the 
bodice. "Isn't this wild?" She sells the revamped dresses for $650. 
</P>
<P>
She said that while she wears and flaunts her used ball gowns at such affairs 
as gallery art shows, most people buy her outlandish clothes mainly to display 
them, although she said a few people have been brave enough to wear them. 
</P>
<P>
"I never went to a prom," she moaned. "No one wanted to date me because I was 
too far out in high school. I was different. People call me Alexandria the 
Great. You know, they named a city after me." 
</P>
<P>
Allan and others are exhibiting their artwork until Thursday at the Brea Civic 
and Cultural Center under the title "A Playful View of Reality." 
</P>
<P>
Her unusual clothing art includes a coat of arms that is a coat with a number 
of arms. She has a pink satin jacket decorated with green three-dimensional 
frogs. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought this was fun, so I went into shoes," she said, showing a pair of 
shoes made from aluminum and springs. And she made shoes on such high heels 
that "it looks like you're going to fall over." They're intended for spring and 
fall seasons, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Humor is a big part of her life, she said, adding that it provides a way to 
communicate. 
</P>
<P>
"I use this type of art to draw people in so I can invade their minds and make 
them think," said Allan, who holds master's degrees in speech therapy from USC 
and Cal State Long Beach. "Everyone knows I'm strange but very serious about 
what I do." 
</P>
<P>
In her other life, "the reputable one," as she calls it, Allan spent 12 years 
in the Compton Unified School District as a speech therapist working with 
severely handicapped children. "That finally began to tear and drain me." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Allan said, she finds herself "a serious customer in the dime store of 
life. No one ever took the dime store seriously. There are very important items 
in there, like nail polish, chewing gum, curtains, washrags and all sorts of 
things you can't do without in life." 
</P>
<P>
But her artwork is not all fun. "I work 9 to 5 just like a regular job," she 
said, adding that she sells half of what she creates -- to the delight of 
husband, Steven Allan, 45, a public defender in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Allan waltzed outside in her bug-laden ball gown, ostensibly to pick up the 
mail. "My neighbors think I'm strange," she said with a smile.

WRONG-WAY DRIVER, 76, KILLED IN FREEWAY CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A wrong-way driver was fatally injured on the Orange Freeway just north of 
Katella Avenue about 4:10 p.m. Sunday when his northbound car plowed head-on 
into a southbound pickup truck, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
The wrong-way driver was identified by the county coroner's office as Edward 
Phillips, 76, of Laguna Hills, who was pronounced dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the pickup was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange with 
"moderate injuries," said the CHP, which identified him only as a 48-year-old 
Placentia man. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the Phillips car became northbound in the southbound lanes. 
The CHP said investigators could not determine why or how the car got into the 
flow against traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"Several people (driving on the freeway) said they had to take evasive action 
to avoid being hit by him," a CHP dispatcher said.

OFFICER NEARLY STRUCK, THEN OVERTAKES SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Costa Mesa police officer who was nearly run down by man driving a 
four-wheel-drive pickup truck late Saturday afternoon on the Costa Mesa Freeway 
later caught and arrested a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Motorcycle Officer Marty Carver was off his bike near the shoulder of the 
freeway's southbound lanes about 5 p.m. when he saw a rust-colored, late-model 
Toyota truck barreling down the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Carver was trying to waive over the truck for the moving violation of driving 
on the shoulder when the vehicle aimed directly at him, according to police 
spokesman Allen Kent. 
</P>
<P>
The truck missed Carver by a few feet, then sped off down the freeway. Carver, 
unhurt, got on his motorcycle and chased the truck. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Paul Bishop, 34, of Costa Mesa was arrested less than a mile farther 
down the freeway, where he was caught in the late-afternoon traffic. Bishop, 
who did not resist arrest, was held on suspicion of assault against an officer 
with a deadly weapon.

POSTSCRIPT: SCUBA INSTRUCTOR HELPS THE HANDICAPPED DIVE RIGHT IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCILLE RENWICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Gatacre of San Clemente once dreamed about having a scuba-diving school 
where handicapped people -- amputees, the blind and quadriplegics -- could 
learn the joys of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning, people weren't accepting the idea and were saying that 
paraplegics can't dive," said Gatacre, who became handicapped in a freak 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
He proved them wrong. In the past several years, his nonprofit diving school 
has certified more than 40 handicapped students and nearly 140 diving 
instructors in 14 states and nine countries. 
</P>
<P>
Gatacre's life changed one morning in 1972 when his right arm suddenly was 
paralyzed. After sleeping on it for 12 hours straight, he had damaged several 
nerve endings. 
</P>
<P>
After the injury, he said, "I was trying to decide who I was. I felt physically 
unacceptable. Opening a can of soup was even hard for me. " 
</P>
<P>
After 6 months of therapy, Gatacre, then a biology student, recovered about 60% 
of the use of his arm. To help overcome the mental strain, he took scuba-diving 
lessons and got his diving certification. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, in 1974, Gatacre came up with the idea of teaching scuba-diving as 
a fun and therapeutic sport for other handicapped people. That year, he and a 
UC Irvine professor organized a pilot project teaching diving to handicapped 
students. The project continued for 3 years. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Gatacre decided to form his own school, the Handicapped Scuba Assn. 
Since then, he has taught scuba-diving to amputees, victims of paralysis and 
cerebral palsy, the blind and the mentally handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has a full-time job as a salesman for a small roofing company, 
Gatacre now travels most weekends of the year teaching classes around the 
country and world. In October, Gatacre and his wife Patricia set up a one-room 
office in San Clemente, but they still find themselves working but still find 
themselves working most of their nights at home. 
</P>
<P>
The classes provide scuba instructors with specialized medical knowledge to 
teach handicapped people to dive. The instructors also simulate various 
handicaps, from blindness to useless limbs. 
</P>
<P>
For Julie Mora, 30, who has been in a wheelchair since youth due to a 
neurological disorder, Gatacre's encouragement made the difference between 
success and failure. 
</P>
<P>
Mora, of Santa Barbara, said she had a bad experience with another school 
unfamiliar with handicapped people. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept flipping over and swimming upside down. It was real hard," she said. 
But when Gatacre "saw me start turning to one side, they knew to make some 
adjustments and that I'd be OK. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim said to me, 'You'll be able to do it, just give it time.' And I thought, 
'Never.' But after giving it some time I was able to swim on my own." 
</P>
<P>
John Cantrell of Eureka, who has had cerebral palsy since youth, also made 
frequent trips from his home to a swimming pool in San Juan Capistrano and the 
beaches in Laguna Beach to participate in Gatacre's scuba-diving classes 
because he couldn't find other instructors who were equipped to teach him. His 
wife, Julie, who is blind, also received instruction from Gatacre. 
</P>
<P>
"Having Jim behind us was the only thing that helped us pull through all the 
classes," said Julie Cantrell. "We spent so much money on phone bills (from 
Northern California) to get advice, support and coaching from him. . . . We 
couldn't have done it without him."

YOUTHS YELL GANG EPITHETS, SHOOT MAN IN HEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA LUTHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 18-year-old Buena Park man riding in a car through Westminster was shot in 
the head Saturday night at a stoplight after he and a friend were chased by two 
youths who drove up beside them and shouted gang epithets. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Arellano was also shot in the arm. He was listed in "extremely critical" 
condition Sunday at Humana Hospital in West Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first gang-related shooting of the year in Westminster, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Arellano and his best friend, Mario Garcia, had driven to Westminster to pick 
up Arellano's cousin when the shooting occurred at 10:40 p.m. at Hoover Street 
and Garden Grove Boulevard, according to the victim's brother, Fabian, who said 
he based his account on what police told him. 
</P>
<P>
Fabian Arellano said two youths in the other car pursued his brother's car, 
shouted the gang epithets and then "were shooting at both of them, and they 
were both ducking down." 
</P>
<P>
He said two bullets went through a window and struck his brother. Garcia was 
not injured. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster Police Lt. Richard Main said the suspects had apparently asked 
Garcia and Arellano if they were members of a gang. 
</P>
<P>
Before the two could finish saying they are not, the suspects opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like somebody was looking for trouble," Main said of the suspects. 
"It probably wouldn't have mattered what response they got." 
</P>
<P>
Police are seeking two Latino males who were driving a silver-gray Honda or 
Hyundai. 
</P>
<P>
Fabian Arellano said his brother is a senior at Western High School in Anaheim 
and has been accepted into a technical school in Arizona to study auto 
mechanics after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
Fabian and Frank are among six children of Manuel and Dolores Arellano.

<TEXT>
<P>
Joni Easterly of Katella High School and Rick Swanwick of Trabuco Hills were 
named The Times' Orange County girls' and boys' basketball players of the year, 
respectively, at an awards ceremony Sunday in the Anaheim Hilton and Towers. 
</P>
<P>
Easterly led Katella into the State Division II girls' championship game and 
averaged 22 points per game. She scored 19 points in the fourth quarter in 
Katella's 54-48 overtime victory over Muir for the Southern Section 4-A 
division title. 
</P>
<P>
Swanwick averaged 20.3 points and 13.5 rebounds per game to lead Trabuco Hills 
into the State Division III boys' championship game. He scored all 28 of his 
team's points in the second half in a 62-61 loss to Central Valley in the State 
title game. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Trakh, who coached Brea-Olinda to the State Division III championship, was 
named the county girls' coach of the year. Brea finished 31-2 under Trakh, with 
both losses in a New York tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Rainer Wulf of Trabuco Hills was named the county boys' coach of the year. 
Trabuco Hills finished 25-7 in only its fourth year of existence. 
</P>
<P>
The Times honored 240 players from Ventura to San Diego County. Each player 
received a certificate and plaque. George Yardley of Newport Beach, the first 
player to score 2,000 points in one season in the National Basketball Assn., 
was the guest speaker. TOM HAMILTON

Q&amp;A: ROBERT CLAY; 
</P>
<P>
AGE OF NON-COMMUNICATION; 
</P>
<P>
ADVERTISING/P.R. EXPERT FINDS SOCIETY AT A LOSS FOR WORDS

Robert Clay is a bit of an iconoclast. He is a marketing communications 
specialist who has shrunk his business at a time when the formation of big 
agencies seems to be the rule. He is a public relations and advertising man who 
in the early 1970s attempted to launch a nationwide boycott of retailers who 
advertised Christmas sales before the Thanksgiving season had ended. And he is 
a communicator who criticizes his industry, potential clients and the public at 
large for bringing about what he calls an era of non-communication. 
</P>
<P>
We are in an age, Clay says, marked by an aversion to reading, talking or 
thinking about substantive issues and by intentional and unintentional misuse 
of the English language. 
</P>
<P>
At 61, Clay is celebrating his 20th year as an independent advertising and 
public relations agency owner. He has taught his craft at Cal State Fullerton, 
is a former national director of the Public Relations Society of America and 
has a wall adorned with advertising and public relations awards. 
</P>
<P>
In his spare time, Clay speaks to industry and civic groups and is an avid 
amateur bicyclist. He has begun penning a book about marketing communications 
and is deep into the polishing of a book about cycling for fitness. 
</P>
<P>
He started his own agency in Tustin with $200 in borrowed money after stints as 
a radio news writer and a public relations executive for a life insurance 
company in his native Milwaukee, and as a trade publications editor, aerospace 
P.R. executive and independent magazine publisher in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
He began his company with one employee and expanded it to 15. Today, operating 
as Clay Communications Group in Lake Forest, he is assisted by only four other 
people. He said the shrinking of the firm, which specializes in work for 
developers, was caused by the Southern California real estate slump of 1981-83. 
When the downturn ended, he decided to stay small. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Times staff writer John O'Dell, Clay shared his views on 
how "non-communication" is affecting business and society, how his profession 
has contributed to the problem -- and what it can do about it. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You recently gave a speech in which you said we are in an era in which no 
one listens and no one communicates. That's pretty radical for an advertising 
and P.R. guy. What was the genesis? 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, I run into many frustrating problems in this business. It's not that 
no one communicates, but a good percentage of the people really are not that 
interested in communication. I constantly run into people who say: 'We don't 
want all that copy; people don't want to read so much.' It is an attitude I 
hear from very astute business people, over and over. 
</P>
<P>
I always hark back to the Mercedes Benz ads, which had a lot of copy. Because 
you have to have a lot of information to sell a big expensive piece of goods or 
a big ideA. I still believe that today. You have to present your case just as 
an attorney would present his case before a jury -- in a logical, step-by-step 
fashion -- to really do the job of communicating. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Am I reading more into what you were saying than I should? Or do you see a 
serious problem? Are people cutting themselves off from information that they 
should be getting? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think they're starving themselves and they're being starved. I talked 
about non-thinkers who would do anything to avoid being left alone to think. 
I'm amazed by so many examples of people who really don't want to think. They 
want to be entertained. This is the entertainment erA. Rather than being left 
alone to read a book, they would rather turn on the TV set. 
</P>
<P>
I am amazed to see families that don't see each other all year 'round get 
together for Christmas, open their Christmas presents, have dinner and then sit 
down to watch television together. These people must have so much to say to 
each other, but they don't want to think. 
</P>
<P>
We have TV commercials these days that rely on music and images of cool chicks 
and cool dudes who are living the good life, and you don't know whether they're 
selling cheese or beer or cars until you get to the logo at the end. I think 
that is symptomatic of our non-thinking age. I think a good percentage of the 
people want more and aren't getting it. It is a communications problem not only 
for business, but for society as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Does the problem for business go beyond not being able to deliver 
advertising messages? 
</P>
<P>
A. This refusal to think really causes a problem for American business because 
people don't want to think on the job. They won't absorb what they hear, what 
you tell them. They don't anticipate situations. 
</P>
<P>
Q. And what about the people you call non-talkers? 
</P>
<P>
A. They aren't silent, but they don't say anything. All you have to do is 
listen to the incredibly trivial talk while you're standing in line at a 
supermarket or in any other crowded situation. I think people just don't want 
to be bothered to think and express themselves. They talk in cliches and hollow 
phrases like 'have a nice day' -- which was a very pleasant sentiment until 
they beat it to death. 
</P>
<P>
From a communications standpoint, this means that you probably won't get a 
meaningful response from non-talkers. It's hard to get feedback because people 
have a hard time being really articulate. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is it that or is it a desire to have some privacy by not discussing ideas or 
things of any substance? 
</P>
<P>
A. That may be giving the people more credit than they merit. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You've described non-thinkers and non-talkers. What else is left? 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, we've got a lot of non-listeners. Some are people who are so intent 
upon making it big in the business world that they're usually trying to do two 
or three things at once. And in today's greed-driven society, some are just 
people so wrapped up in themselves, so egocentric, that they simply won't 
listen because they're preoccupied with what they're doing. 
</P>
<P>
We've also got non-readers. Intelligent, seemingly successful people who read 
as little as possible. They get their news from television, look at magazines 
for the pictures and never touch a book. Non-readers want brochures and ads 
with all pictures and few words. 
</P>
<P>
And this makes it difficult, because in order to sell an idea or a concept, you 
have to create awareness and understanding before you can create acceptance. 
The ultimate thing for the non-reader is a video brochure, which doesn't say as 
much, but does it in dramatic fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are we looking at the symptoms of something else or are we looking at the 
final stages of an illness in society? 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, I hope it's not the final stages. I think it's symptomatic of the fact 
that we are in this era of instant gratification and many people are terribly 
impatient about most everything. All you have to do is get in the fast lane of 
the freeway and hold up traffic by doing 10 miles over the speed limit. You'll 
find out quickly how impatient people are. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So how do we go about curing the problem? 
</P>
<P>
A. The great American tradition is that things have to get awful bad before 
somebody says: 'Hey! We gotta do something about it.' I think, unfortunately, 
that the quality of our society is going to have to go down even more before 
people get mad enough. This happened with semiautomatic rifles. Thirty kids 
getting injured finally caused something to happen. 
</P>
<P>
Americans are born in this great tradition of liberty and democracy, but one 
reason the Japanese are beating the hell out of us financially these days is 
because of their tremendous discipline. We are a very undisciplined society. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What should communications advisers like yourself be doing to try and impose 
on business the kind of discipline that you think is missing? 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, another great American tradition is speaking to the converted. And we 
in the communications industry are as guilty as everybody else in terms of 
speaking to believers. If we really want to do something for ourselves, society 
and business, what we ought to be doing is standing on street corners on soap 
boxes and talking about communications and talking about public responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
I think people in communications ought to have public-service programs to talk 
to people about communications. You know, do it for free. Instead of having 
these associations where we're always preaching to ourselves, we ought to go 
out and have free workshops for businesses of various sizes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. And what would you tell these businesses? 
</P>
<P>
A. First, I don't think all this means that business people and professional 
people should give up in their communications. They simply have to work harder. 
</P>
<P>
This means four things. Business owners personally have to put a lot of effort 
into their marketing communications programs. They can't delegate the job to 
somebody else in the company. It doesn't work that way. 
</P>
<P>
They also have to be willing to spend a reasonable amount. A lot of business 
people ask what the minimum is that they can get by with, and when you give 
them that figure they want to do it for 10% less. Less than the minimum! 
</P>
<P>
You must have also a well-thought-out program that has a good chance of 
reaching the people who will make the decisions that affect your future. You 
have to spoon-feed the people you're giving the information to, making a 
supreme effort to be as simple and as understandable as possible so they can't 
misconstrue anything. 
</P>
<P>
You must always make sure that your presentation and language are 
attention-getting, interesting and unmistakeably clear. Most managers today 
have a very short attention span. They're only looking till the next quarter. 
They're only looking at the bottom line, so what doesn't produce results for 
them immediately is something they just tend to ignore. There are some things 
that bring your customers in right away. But what you really need is a 
comprehensive marketing communications program that has long-range goals. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Isn't business just as guilty as the political system of selling flash and 
image over substance? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think they're probably equally guilty. I think the politicians learned 
well from advertising people. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you draw a distinction between advertising and public relations? And if 
so, what is it? 
</P>
<P>
A. The narrow, public concept of advertising is very well understood. Public 
relations is not well understood. If you need advertising, you go to an ad 
agency to design something that sells your product. Sophisticated advertisers 
know that there's a hell of a lot more to advertising agencies than that. They 
offer a comprehensive communications service. But most people, especially small 
business owners, do not know that. 
</P>
<P>
Public relations has never been able to explain itself, and it's one of my 
great frustrations. I've been involved with the Public Relations Society of 
America on a national level and I quit twice in frustration because they never 
did any P.R. for P.R. A lot of sophisticated people in marketing equate a blurb 
in the paper with P.R. That's publicity, which is the best-known aspect of 
public relations. 
</P>
<P>
But public relations is also a do-gooder kind of program. Your client does a 
good job in the community or a good job producing a product or service, and you 
tell the people about it to help give the client a good reputation. It's 
creating a broad base of understanding as opposed to zeroing in and selling a 
particular product or service. 
</P>
<P>
Q. A while ago, you got fed up with businesses that were holding Christmas 
sales even before Thanksgiving, and you sent out bumper stickers and a few 
other things urging a boycott of 'Christmas Spoilers.' It seemed at the time to 
be a fairly brave thing for a public relations and advertising person to do -- 
sort of biting the hand that feeds you. So why did you do it? 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, I really loved Christmas. It was the greatest time of the year, a time 
of happiness and joy. I just got frustrated with the premature promotion of 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
I came home from a meeting on Sept. 15., 1972, and I opened up the newspaper 
and I saw Santa Claus and I got mad. I was able to afford to have a couple of 
thousand bumper stickers printed and I sent these things to a bunch of people, 
including the local newspapers. And then I didn't think any more about it. 
</P>
<P>
They went out on a Thursday. On Monday morning I got a call from a newspaper in 
New Jersey and found out that a local story had been picked up by the 
Associated Press. We ended up being in 138 papers across the country. We did a 
half-hour television debate. I was hoping to ignite some group that really had 
the time to pursue this thing. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What happened? 
</P>
<P>
A. Roaring apathy. We did an opinion survey at South Coast Plaza to prepare for 
that television debate and found out that 91% of the people were opposed to 
early Christmas advertising. And 91% of the people said that they did not buy 
any more because of the early Christmas advertising. So why start advertising 
in September? Because of greed. Businesses have extended the season, but if you 
have steak every day you get awful tired of steak. 
</P>
<P>
In the same survey, we asked if people felt strongly enough about it to do 
anything. And only about 30% of the people said yes. They didn't say they'd 
boycott or anything like that, just that they wouldn't buy early. 
</P>
<P>
Q. To get back to your side of the business community, to the people who are 
supposed to be advising business on how to communicate: Is it that the public 
relations and advertising people aren't advising properly, or is it that the 
clients don't listen? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think the agencies would like to be the leaders, but I think that they are 
the followers now, in public relations particularly. Only when a company gets 
into real trouble, like Suzuki with the Samurai, then they go into a crisis 
management kind of thing and listen to the P.R. adviser. 
</P>
<P>
But I think most other times the client calls the shots too much and either 
isn't told or just doesn't listen and brushes off the recommendations. The 
clients often are very strong-willed entrepreneurs, and they don't like people 
telling them what to do. They think that they are really the experts. 
</P>
<P>
Of course they can't handle the details, but I've known a case of a chairman of 
board of a publicly held company in Orange County who wrote his own news 
releases because he thought he was saving money. Now you know that has got to 
be the biggest waste of time I can think of. 
</P>
<P>
People in the communications business can only be as good as their clients let 
them be. They have to ask for their freedom, but then the client has to give it 
to them.

ROCK IS READY TO ROLL BACK INTO SAN DIEGO STADIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jack Murphy Stadium has not played host to a major rock concert since 1983, 
when the legendary British band, The Who, came to town. 
</P>
<P>
The Dallas Cowboys visited a few days later, and the group playing host to them 
-- the San Diego Chargers -- said the playing field was in the worst condition 
possible for a professional football game. 
</P>
<P>
So, leverage was applied, and rock left the stadium indefinitely. Its departure 
meant the loss of a lot of money for the city, while rock lost the one local 
venue capable of staging such acts as Michael Jackson, Bruce Springsteen and 
the Rolling Stones. 
</P>
<P>
Well, now it looks as though rock is back, or will be by summer. Stadium 
manager Bill Wilson confirmed last month that he is negotiating with big-time 
promoters to return rock to the 60,000-seat stadium. 
</P>
<P>
And, according to Brian Murphy, a promoter with the Los Angeles-based Avalon 
Attractions, the group most likely to mark the return is, ironically, The Who. 
</P>
<P>
A city official who asked not to be identified confirmed that Murphy is right 
-- The Who may be booked for an August concert, while talks are being held with 
the Rolling Stones for a November show. The same official called the Stones' 
1981 appearance at the stadium the biggest 1-day payoff in city history -- more 
than $250,000 net profit. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's a wonderful idea -- big-time rock coming back to San Diego," 
said Murphy of Avalon Attractions. "And, we hope The Who will play there." 
</P>
<P>
Pressed for details, Murphy said he could "not comment further," nor would he 
confirm that he was the agent seeking to book The Who. 
</P>
<P>
"I've spoken very seriously and had heavy telephone conversations with a number 
of promoters," Wilson said. "We've made available certain dates in June and 
July, and, of course, August. We just need a window of 2 days on either end 
(before and after the concert) to get the field back in shape for baseball and 
football." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson pointed out that the Beach Boys and the KOOL Jazz Festival took place at 
the stadium during the ban on rock but with a restrictive caveat -- no one was 
allowed to sit on the field during those events. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said rock's full-scale return is feasible only with fans being allowed 
to sit on the field and in reserved seats. He said no promoter would accept the 
restriction of no seating on the field. He said the only way fans can sit on 
the field without destroying it is through the use of a new high-tech 
"geotextile" material -- not available in 1983 -- that covers and protects the 
turf even with thousands of bodies crunched upon it. 
</P>
<P>
"Geotextile is a three-eighths-inch felt material interwoven with polyester," 
said Steve Wightman, stadium turf manager. "It allows a pocket of air between 
the feet of the people and the grass. It's not perfect, but it allows the turf 
to breathe. It's the only way to minimize detrimental effects." 
</P>
<P>
Even with such protection, Wilson said, the City Council, which oversees the 
stadium, would never again permit "festival seating" -- fans being allowed to 
camp on the field without reserved seating, "Woodstock-style," as they did for 
the Rolling Stones concert 8 years ago. From now on, he said, on-the-field 
seating will be allowed only in chairs and only on a reserved basis. 
</P>
<P>
Stadium Authority Board member Mike Gotch favors the return of rock to keep the 
stadium fiscally fit, despite the hazards it poses to the turf and to stadium 
security. 
</P>
<P>
"The unofficial ban on rock guarantees that the stadium is a money loser every 
year," Gotch said, adding that he expects the authority board and the council 
to lift the ban. "With proper security and proper conditions being imposed on 
the promoter for cleanup of the site, then I believe it's time we took another 
look."

PACIFIC SYMPHONY FIDDLES WHILE SUBSCRIBERS BURN 
</P>

<P>
With less than a month before its next concerts, the Pacific Symphony still 
doesn't know what the program is going to be. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, music director Keith Clark was to lead the orchestra in Verdi's 
Requiem on April 26 and 27 at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa 
Mesa. Soloists were to have included soprano Aprile Millo and mezzo-soprano 
Dolora Zajic. 
</P>
<P>
But in a move to balance its budget, the orchestra in February "postponed" the 
Verdi work until next season, saving about $75,000, according to officials. 
</P>
<P>
So who and what is going to be on the April concerts? 
</P>
<P>
"Millo will appear, that's confirmed," says Louis G. Spisto, executive director 
of the Santa Ana-based orchestra. But he does not seem to know what she will be 
singing. 
</P>
<P>
"Miss Millo and conductor Keith Clark are finalizing details of her portion of 
the program, which will include Verdi arias," he says. "As far as Mr. Clark's 
part of the program, I don't know. Schubert's Eighth (Symphony) and 
(Stravinsky's) 'Petrouchka' have been mentioned." 
</P>
<P>
Clark, for his part, refers all program inquiries back to the Pacific Symphony 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
What's going on? 
</P>
<P>
In an era in which singers often know their contractual obligations years in 
advance -- and the Pacific itself knows its next year's season virtually to the 
last detail -- why are Pacific subscribers still in the dark about 3 weeks 
before the concerts, and nearly 2 months after the Requiem was canceled? 
</P>
<P>
Some insiders, who insist on anonymity, suggest that the delay represents the 
last vestiges of a power struggle between Spisto and Clark -- which led to 
Clark's removal as music director at the end of this season. 
</P>
<P>
One theory goes that Clark is stalling a decision as long as possible to 
embarrass Spisto and the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Others more sympathetic to the founding music director suggest that he was 
never consulted about the Requiem cancellation, feels justifiably hurt and 
considers a piecemeal program of operatic arias a poor substitute for what was 
originally announced. 
</P>
<P>
There are even a few iconoclasts who will whisper in your ear that the great 
Millo is not above playing her own diva games -- and is not helping matters 
with her demands and choices of repertory. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows the truth at this point. 
</P>
<P>
But one thing is certain. So far no one is a winner in the situation: not the 
subscribers, the public, Clark, Millo, Spisto or an orchestra that is trying to 
augment its professional reputation. 
</P>
<P>
Come on, guys, grow up. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, Spisto says Zajic had agreed to postpone her appearance with the 
orchestra until the 1990-91 season. But she is not listed among the soloists so 
far announced for the season. The Verdi Requiem is not on the schedule either. 
</P>
<P>
Stay tuned.

A record number of Vietnamese refugees and immigrants left for the United 
States last month under the Orderly Departure Program, the U.S. Embassy in 
Bangkok said today. 
</P>
<P>
The embassy put the number of refugees at 3,662, which is 1,401 more than 
January's previous monthly high. Among those leaving in March were 2,071 
Amerasian children fathered by American soldiers during the Vietnam War and 
their relatives, the embassy said. Since the program was established in 1979, 
84,483 Vietnamese have resettled in the United States under it, the embassy 
said.

<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court refused to revive a "clergy malpractice" lawsuit 
stemming from the 1979 suicide of a young man counseled by pastors of his 
church in Sunland. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, without comment today, left intact a California Supreme Court 
decision that threw out the suit against the Grace Community Church of the 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Nally, 24, of Tujunga committed suicide April 1, 1979, by shooting 
himself. His parents, Walter and Maria Nally, subsequently sued Grace Community 
Church, the largest Protestant church in Los Angeles County, and four church 
pastors. The wrongful-death suit alleged that the pastors had been negligent 
and had acted outrageously in failing to prevent the suicide. 
</P>
<P>
A state trial judge dismissed the suit, but a state appeals court reinstated it 
in a ruling that sent shock waves through the legal profession and the 
religious community. But the California Supreme Court killed the suit last Nov. 
23.

The Transportation Department today announced new measures to combat sky 
terrorism after a meeting with President Bush by relatives of Americans killed 
in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland.

Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner told a news conference that airlines 
will be required to acknowledge all Federal Aviation Administration security 
bulletins within 24 hours, and compliance with them would be mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
Such bulletins tell airlines of possible threats and recommend steps that can 
be taken to avert them. In the past, such recommendations generally have been 
advisory. Skinner also said airlines will be required to install equipment to 
detect plastic explosives in all high-risk airports throughout the world. (Bush

SIMMONS GETS 5.3% LOCKHEED STAKE;

FILING TO SEC HINTS DALLAS GROUP MAY TRY TO GET CONTROL

A group led by Harold Simmons, the Dallas-based financier, said today it had 
acquired a 5.3% stake in Lockheed Corp. and may seek control of the company, 
the eighth-biggest military supplier. 
</P>
<P>
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Simmons' group said it 
had been buying shares to acquire a significant equity interest and would 
review its stake continuously. 
</P>
<P>
"While the reporting persons do not currently have any plans to acquire control 
of the company by stock ownership or otherwise, they may consider seeking 
control of the company in the future," the filing said. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed, headquartered in Calabasas, Calif., has long been a rumored target 
for a takeover or restructuring because of the depressed price of its stock 
relative to the value of its assets, financial analysts have said. 
</P>
<P>
In a March 31 letter to Lockheed Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel 
Tellep, Simmons said he viewed Lockheed as well-managed. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no plans, or desire, to disrupt management. We expect to be a 
constructive, long-term shareholder," he said in the letter, a copy of which 
was included in the SEC filing. 
</P>
<P>
The Simmons group said it purchased a total of 2,467,200 shares from Jan. 31 to 
March 29 at prices ranging from $43.50 to $49 a share. The recent purchases 
brought the group's total stake to 3,147,800 shares, or about 5.3% of 
Lockheed's outstanding common stock. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed makes defense systems, propulsion and military aircraft and 
electronics equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The company won $3.53 billion in military contracts in fiscal 1988, making it 
the Pentagon's eighth-biggest supplier, according to figures released by the 
Defense Department last month. That was down from fourth place in the 
year-earlier period, when it won $5.57 billion in prime contracts. 
</P>
<P>
The company had no immediate comment on news of the Simmons stake. Lockheed's 
stock was trading up $2.75 at $49.50 a share on the New York Stock Exchange by 
early afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons is chairman and chief executive officer of Valhi Inc., a diversified 
holding company he has built up by identifying undervalued companies, taking 
them over, liquidating their unprofitable assets and retaining the rest. He now 
has interests, through subsidiaries, in chemicals, oil services, refined sugar, 
forest products, fast food and hardware products. Valhi earned $85.9 million on 
sales of $2.30 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons had said in December that Valhi owned $15 million worth of Lockheed's 
shares and that he was considering boosting his stake. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed is involved in many large defense projects, including production of 
the Trident I and Trident II missiles, the P-3 anti-submarine aircraft and the 
C-130 and C-5 cargo aircraft. It is also home of the so-called "Skunk Works" 
where the high-flying U-2 reconnaissance plane as well as high-speed jets were 
developed.

A Piedmont Airlines pilot alarmed by the sudden departure of a passenger just 
before takeoff returned today to Los Angeles International Airport, fearing 
that a bomb might be aboard. 
</P>
<P>
The 210 passengers aboard Baltimore-bound Piedmont Flight 1146 were ordered to 
use emergency chutes to evacuate the Boeing 767 jetliner when it touched down 
at 1:17 a.m., airport spokesman Lee Nichols said. 
</P>
<P>
Two passengers were treated for minor scrapes, and a co-pilot suffered a broken 
elbow while descending the crew's cockpit escape rope. 
</P>
<P>
The police bomb squad searched the aircraft and determined at 3:50 a.m. that 
there were no explosives aboard. Passengers were rerouted on other flights. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out that Vincent Gore of Santa Monica was celebrating his 29th 
birthday Sunday and decided it would be fun to travel by air, said Lt. Ruben 
Martinez of the Department of Airports police. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't have a ticket but he wanted to fly so he got on the plane," Martinez 
said. "Before the plane left, he told the stewardess, 'I decided I don't want 
to fly,' and he got off the plane." 
</P>
<P>
Gore was questioned and released, the lieutenant said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how Gore, who didn't have a ticket or boarding pass, managed to get on 
the jetliner, Piedmont spokesman Larry Pickett said: "That is being checked."

Israeli journalists said today they will refuse to report on Jewish settlers in 
the occupied territories after some settlers pretended to be correspondents by 
putting press signs on their vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Ronnie Shaked, head of Israeli journalists covering the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip, said correspondents have been put in greater danger in covering the 
15-month-old uprising because Palestinians now doubt the identity of real 
journalists. 
</P>
<P>
Militant settlers traveling in vans bearing press signs clashed several times 
with Palestinians last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Lately everyone wants to be a journalist. The police disguised as journalists. 
Now the settlers put up the press signs and in the name of journalism carry out 
activities no journalist would," Shaked said.

USE OF 'DRUG PROFILE' IN ARRESTS OKD; 
</P>
<P>
AGENTS CAN DETAIN SUSPICIOUS-APPEARING PEOPLE, JUSTICES RULE

<P>
The Supreme Court, giving the government another victory in the war on drugs, 
ruled today that drug agents may stop and detain airline passengers who match a 
"drug courier profile." 
</P>
<P>
If a passenger is carrying a large wad of cash, flying from a drug trafficking 
center such as Miami and traveling under an assumed name, drug agents are 
justified in stopping him for questioning and for examining his bags, the high 
court said. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling overturns a federal appeals court in California, which said 
government agents cannot stop passengers just because they may look like 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
By a 7-2 vote, the court ordered the reinstatement of a drug possession 
conviction of a man carrying 1,000 grams of cocaine when he was stopped by 
authorities at the Honolulu airport. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, Andrew Sokolow, matched a so-called "profile" that drug 
enforcement agents use to identify drug couriers. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, said there were 
sufficient factors to lead agents to reasonably suspect that Sokolow was 
engaged in criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Victory for Justice Dept. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that these factors may be set forth in a 'profile' does not somehow 
detract from their evidentiary significance as seen by a trained agent," 
Rehnquist said. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling is a victory for the Justice Department, which said a decision that 
threw out Sokolow's conviction could severely hamper the fight against 
narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
Sokolow was stopped by agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration on July 
25, 1984, as he returned to Hawaii from a trip to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said he aroused their suspicions three days earlier when he and a 
female companion departed from Honolulu airport for Miami. 
</P>
<P>
They said Sokolow, who appeared to be in his mid-20s, bought his plane tickets 
with $2,100 in cash taken from a roll of money that appeared to contain more 
than $4,000. He was wearing a black jumpsuit and a great deal of gold jewelry, 
he appeared nervous, and he and the woman with him carried four handbags on the 
plane without checking any luggage. 
</P>
<P>
The agents also suspected that he was using an alias because the name he gave 
the ticket agent was not the same as the name listed for the telephone number 
he gave the agent. 
</P>
<P>
Sokolow's behavior, dress and demeanor fit the profile of a drug courier, 
narcotics agents said. 
</P>
<P>
Sokolow pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and 
was sentenced to five years in prison. He appealed the conviction on the 
grounds that the cocaine should have been suppressed as evidence because 
authorities violated his constitutional rights against unlawful search and 
seizure when they stopped him upon his return to Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the conviction, ruling that 
suspicion of a crime "cannot be intuited from a hodgepodge assembly of factors 
about individual character." 
</P>
<P>
But the Supreme Court today said the accumulation of factors weighed by the 
agents was enough to permit them to question Sokolow.

Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker have moved into a retreat for "tired" ministers and 
will broadcast their religious television show from the 29-acre compound, the 
retreat's director said today. 
</P>
<P>
"Temporarily, they're staying with us," said Duane Starr at the Lake George 
Ministries Retreat. "Three weeks, a couple weeks, a week. They're looking to 
relocate. This is just short-term, in between." 
</P>
<P>
Starr said the retreat caters to clergymen who suffer burnout and need a place 
to recuperate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's for ministers who are tired, ministers who are fatigued and need a place 
to rest and relax and get away from their people just so they can get 
rejuvenated," Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not necessarily that they've been in trouble, not necessarily that they 
are going to be in trouble, but that they need a place to rest."

A tanker carrying 1,200 tons of fuel oil ran aground in the Rhine today, 
spilling an undetermined amount of its cargo and halting ship traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The vessel, Rhinetank 24, struck a stone embankment near the city of Oppenheim, 
25 miles southwest of Frankfurt, at 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Jochen Boehm confirmed that the ship sustained severe damage, 
and could break up. 
</P>
<P>
Water protection authorities surrounded the vessel with oil containment booms 
and were transferring the cargo to another ship, Boehm said. River traffic was 
halted at Oppenheim to prevent motion that could worsen the environmental 
damage, authorities said.

Renee Johnson said good riddance today to her reign as Mrs. Illinois. She said 
pageant officials wanted to make her up like a hooker. They claim they tried 
but failed to make her a lady. 
</P>
<P>
"I told my husband that if I ever mention entering a beauty contest again, that 
he should give me a good shake," said the 25-year-old Rockford woman. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was barred from the weekend ceremonies that crowned her successor, 
Barbara Trobar. 
</P>
<P>
Pageant Director Marcie Aceto said Johnson violated terms of her contract. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think she went on all of her appearances, but I really couldn't tell 
you all of them," Aceto said. "I can't remember them. I do know that I tried to 
make this woman a lady, and she couldn't even say thank you for what we turned 
her into." 
</P>
<P>
Aceto said Johnson "likes to use four-letter words and doesn't embody what I 
think a Mrs. Illinois should be." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson admitted she used "some foul words," but denied any contract 
violations. She said pageant officials tried to make her over. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a housewife," she said. "I didn't want blond streaks painted in my hair . 
. . They wanted me to dress in glitter clothes, and I wanted to be myself . . . 
I didn't want to end up looking like a hooker."

CHRYSLER OFFERS NO-INTEREST LOANS ON AUTOS

Chrysler Corp. escalated the car industry's cut-rate auto-financing wars today 
by offering interest-free loans on its cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
The zero-percent financing is the most drastic program yet offered by a U.S. 
auto maker in an attempt to spur sagging sales. 
</P>
<P>
The interest-free loans are based on repayment schedules of up to 24 months and 
will be given for 1988 and 1989 U.S. car and truck models. Chrysler said the 
sales incentive program has no expiration date. 
</P>
<P>
The company is also offering rates of 5.9% to 10.9% on longer-term loans, 
Chrysler said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Ford Motor Co. launched the latest salvo in the incentive wars by 
offering 2.9% short-term loans and expanding its other incentives. General 
Motors Corp. matched that program on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler, which is also offering cash incentive programs ranging from $300 to 
$2,000 per vehicle, said it has increased the incentives offered on a number of 
car and truck models. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett Bidwell, chairman of the Chrysler Motors Unit, said the auto maker does 
not plan to reduce its second-quarter production schedules and thinks that 
business will pick up due to the program. 
</P>
<P>
Several weeks ago, Chrysler had announced a program featuring 4.9% loans that 
at the time was its most extensive program since the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Bidwell said that program was created because the company saw that sales were 
softening. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. auto sales are down about 8% so far this year, and truck sales are off 
about 2%. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler acknowledged that the cost of the new round of incentive programs will 
have a slight negative impact on second-quarter results.

could face jail sentences of up to five years. Japan, which caught nearly 3,000 
whales a year up until 1987, banned commercial whaling in 1988 under an 
agreement with the International Whaling Commission. Because many Japanese 
still have a taste for whale, smuggling banned whale meat into the country has 
become a lucrative business.

The price of MCA Inc. stock shot higher today even as the Japanese electronics 
giant Sony Corp. denied reports that it is negotiating to buy the entertainment 
conglomerate that owns Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a rumor," said Jason Farrow, vice president for corporate 
communications at Sony's offices in New Jersey. "Sony is not negotiating with 
MCA." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles radio station KNX reported on Friday that a deal for Sony to buy 
MCA would be announced today. 
</P>
<P>
But Farrow, asked if an announcement is forthcoming, told a reporter, "You know 
better." 
</P>
<P>
In early trading on the New York Stock Exchange today, MCA was up $3.87 1/2 a 
share at $56.62 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
MCA President Sidney Sheinberg has refused to comment on the KNX report, which 
came on the heels of an announcement that the film studio United Artists was 
being sold for $1 billion to Australian-based Qintex Group. 
</P>
<P>
MCA, based in Universal City, Calif., is worth an estimated $5.5 billion.

Rick Majerus has resigned as Ball State's basketball coach to take the head 
coaching job at the University of Utah, Ball State's president announced today. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted him to stay. We made a strong counter offer, and we are disappointed 
he is leaving. But we will continue to compete successfully at the national 
level," said Ball State President John E. Worthen. 
</P>
<P>
Majerus, 41, had a 29-3 record in Ball State this season. He had two years 
remaining on his contract at the school, but Ball State Athletic Director Don 
Purvis previously had said the university would release the coach from his 
obligation. 
</P>
<P>
Majerus will succeed fired Ute basketball Coach Lynn Archibald.

SAN DIEGO YACHT CLUB TO APPEAL RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Yacht Club today announced that it will appeal a New York judge's 
ruling that forfeits the America's Cup to defeated New Zealand challenger 
Michael Fay. 
</P>
<P>
The nine-member SDYC board voted unanimously to take up the appeal after 
Saturday's recommendation by its organizer, the America's Cup Organizing 
Committee, to pursue the action. 
</P>
<P>
"As trustee, we feel our overriding responsibility is to protect the future 
viability of the America's Cup," yacht club Commodore Patrick Goddard said. "A 
sporting event cannot survive under the vague rule of the court's decision." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Our Preference' 
</P>
<P>
"Our decision to appeal was not an easy one and was reached with care and 
deliberation," he said. "Going to court is not our preference. For over 100 
years we have been sailors and competitors, and we believe that yacht races 
should be decided on the water." 
</P>
<P>
But Goddard said they believed that they had no choice, given the principle 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
Pending the New York court's final orders of its ruling last Tuesday, 
disqualifying the San Diego club's catamaran defense against Fay's monohull 
sloop, the America's Cup will remain in San Diego's hands. 
</P>
<P>
"We strongly feel that the court should not have the power to overturn the 
results of a sporting event seven months after it is over. . . . It is 
incomprehensible to us that a court would order the America's Cup be sent to a 
yacht club that has never won an America's Cup match," Goddard said. 
</P>
<P>
Goddard argued that all organized sports had governing bodies responsible for 
setting and administering the rules. 
</P>
<P>
"The court doesn't understand that we have such an authority in our sport. It 
is called the International Yacht Racing Union, and has a set of rules that the 
SDYC has adopted. The America's Cup match in 1988 was governed by those same 
rules," Goddard said, adding that Mercury Bay had agreed to the IYRU rules 
prior to the September races. 
</P>
<P>
Fay's challenge was launched under the banner of the Mercury Bay Boating Club. 
</P>
<P>
New York Supreme Court Judge Carmen Ciparick's ruling in favor of New Zealand 
merchant banker Fay said the yacht club's unprecedented catamaran defense was 
illegal under the Deed of Gift, a 102-year-old document that governs America's 
Cup matches. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Conner skippered the yacht club's 60-foot catamaran, Stars and Stripes, 
to an easy sweep of Fay's 133-foot, single-hulled sloop in the best-of-three 
series off San Diego last September. 
</P>
<P>
The New York court, which serves as arbiter of America's Cup disputes, ruled 
that use of the two-hulled catamaran created a gross mismatch and violated the 
spirit of the Deed of Gift. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal process could take about a year. That leaves adrift the fate of the 
next America's Cup race, which had been planned for 1991. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
24-Month Period 
</P>
<P>
An agreement that potential challengers adopted in January during a meeting in 
San Diego requires a minimum 24-month period between the end of litigation in 
this case and the next America's Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Even without an appeal, Fay's case would not officially be finished until final 
documents are completed and filed in several weeks. That would be too late for 
New Zealand to host a 1991 defense because the Deed of Gift requires all races 
in the Southern Hemisphere to begin by April 30. 
</P>
<P>
"Appeal or no appeal, 1991 was not likely," ACOC Executive Director Tom Ehman 
said. "An appeal now will not actually delay an event."

OPENING DAY; 
</P>
<P>
' . . . BUY ME SOME PEANUTS AND CRACKER JACK . . . '

Opening Day is not a good day to be an employer. 
</P>
<P>
Such annual afflictions as 24-hour plague, long-gone flu and elective brain 
surgery are laying up more employees today than on all the rest of the days of 
the year combined. 
</P>
<P>
Opening Day is not a good day to be a teacher. The behavior of students on this 
day is only slightly less sociopathic than that of rioting inmates -- or 
Christmas shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
Opening Day is, however, a great day to be a baseball fan. Because on this lone 
day, all things are possible: 
</P>
<P>
The Boston Red Sox will finally go all the way. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Cubs will finally go all the way. 
</P>
<P>
The Pittsburgh Pirates will win the division by 50 games. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Yankees will have only one manager. (Another good thing about 
Opening Day: you're allowed to get carried away.) 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Opening Day is always bright with promise. Yes, it is as personal an 
American celebration as Thanksgiving or the Fourth of July. It signals a subtle 
shift in the rhythm of our everyday lives. But it is more, much more. 
</P>
<P>
Opening Day is Presidents: 
</P>
<P>
William Howard Taft began the presidential custom of throwing out the first 
ball in 1910. Franklin D. Roosevelt did it eight times; Dwight D. Eisenhower, a 
former West Point outfielder, got the nod on seven occasions. Harry S. Truman 
had the best arm, make that arms. Truman was ambidextrous, and in the 1950 
opener he tossed out the first ball left-handed, then came back with a 
right-handed delivery. In comparison, Lyndon B. Johnson didn't have much of an 
arm, but had a major league appetite and woofed four hot dogs after his fling. 
</P>
<P>
Opening Day is great players: 
</P>
<P>
Ted Williams hitting .449 in 14 openers. 
</P>
<P>
Darryl Strawberry crushing one against the Montreal Expos in Olympic Stadium 
last year that was still going when it hit the 160-foot high cement ring 
surrounding the roof. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Feller throwing a no-hitter against the Chicago White Sox in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
Babe Ruth winning his first three starts as an Opening-Day pitcher for the Red 
Sox, and going on to hit .422 in 18 openers. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Maris clubbing two homers on his first Opening Day as a Yankee in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
Don Drysdale becoming the only pitcher with two home runs on Opening Day. 
</P>
<P>
Opening Day is the ballpark: 
</P>
<P>
The smell of fresh-cut grass. Hot dogs. New uniforms. Flapping flags. Faded 
caps atop graying heads. Kids with mitts tied to their belts. 
</P>
<P>
Opening Day is forever: 
</P>
<P>
No matter what they do to the game: the DH, the shag carpeting, the dome homes; 
no matter how boorish the players become: the sleaze, the drugs, the greed; 
baseball survives, even thrives. 
</P>
<P>
Opening Day is a big chill: 
</P>
<P>
"Play ball."
